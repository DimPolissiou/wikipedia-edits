The duo fittingly took the band name to maintain a British identity and take a small part of Britain to the United States. After playing hardly half a dozen shows together, The Shires caught the attention of [[Decca Records]], who signed them in the United Kingdom, and they secured a contract with American record label [[Universal Music Group Nashville]], thus becoming the first ever English country act to be signed to a major Nashville label.<ref name=\"The Sunday Times Article\">[http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/music/article1405270.ece The Sunday Times: That British twang, Country is being reborn in Bedford, not Nashville].

The duo fittingly took the band name to maintain a British identity and take a small part of Britain to the United States. After playing hardly half a dozen shows together, The Shires caught the attention of [[Decca Records]], who signed them in the United Kingdom, and they secured a contract with American record label [[Universal Music Group Nashville]], thus becoming the first ever English country act to be signed to a major Nashville label.<ref name=\"The Sunday Times Article\">[http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/music/article1405270.ece The Sunday Times: That British twang, Country is being reborn in Bedford, not Nashville].

The film features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Marlon Brando]], [[Al Pacino]], [[James Caan]], [[Richard Castellano]], [[Robert Duvall]], [[Sterling Hayden]], [[John Marley]], [[Richard Conte]], and [[Diane Keaton]]. The story, spanning from 1945 to 1955, chronicles the [[Corleone family]] under patriarch [[Vito Corleone]] (Brando), focusing on the transformation of one of his sons, [[Michael Corleone]] (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless [[American Mafia|mafia]] [[Crime boss|boss]].\n\n[[Paramount Pictures]] obtained the rights to the novel for the price of $80,000, before it gained popularity.<ref name=mjnytgnw>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DkwaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nigEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7006%2C4931444 |work=Milwaukee Journal |agency=(New York Times) |last=Allan |first=John H. |title='Godfather' gives boost to G&W profit picture |date=April 17, 1972 |page=16, part 2 |access-date=July 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121195947/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DkwaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nigEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7006%2C4931444 |archive-date=November 21, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"nytimes19720416\" /> Studio executives had trouble finding a director; their first few candidates turned down the position before Coppola signed on to direct the film. They and Coppola disagreed over the casting for several characters, in particular, Vito and Michael. Filming took place primarily on location around New York and in [[Sicily]], and was completed ahead of schedule. The musical score was composed principally by [[Nino Rota]], with additional pieces by [[Carmine Coppola]].\n\n''The Godfather'' premiered at the [[Loew's State Theatre (New York City)|Loew's State Theatre]] on March 14, 1972, and was released wider in the United States on March 24, 1972.

The film received universal acclaim from critics and audiences, with praise going toward the performances of its cast, particularly by Brando and Pacino, the directing, screenplay, cinematography, editing, score, and portrayal of the mafia. The film revitalized Brando's career, which was in decline during the 1960s. In addition to starring in films such as ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'', [[Superman (1978 film)|''Superman'']], and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', Brando was a catalyst in this film for the successful careers of Coppola, Pacino, and other relative newcomers in the cast. At the [[45th Academy Awards]], the film won the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Brando), and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (for Puzo and Coppola). In addition, the seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, Caan, and Duvall for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]], and Coppola for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].\n\nSince its release, ''The Godfather'' has been widely regarded as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest and most influential films ever made]], especially in the [[gangster film|gangster]] genre.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/what-is-the-godfather-effect-83473971/ |title=What is The Godfather Effect? |last=Gambino |first=Megan |date=January 31, 2012 |work=Smithsonian |access-date=September 10, 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910061138/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/what-is-the-godfather-effect-83473971/ |archive-date=September 10, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was selected for preservation in the U.S. [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] in 1990, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and is ranked the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|second-greatest film in American cinema]] (behind ''[[Citizen Kane]]'') by the [[American Film Institute]]. It was followed by sequels ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974) and ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990).\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1945 New York City, at his daughter [[Connie Corleone|Connie]]'s wedding to [[Carlo Rizzi (The Godfather)|Carlo]], [[Vito Corleone]] listens to requests in his role as [[Don (honorific)|don]] of the [[Corleone crime family]]. His youngest son, [[Michael Corleone|Michael]], who was a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] during [[World War II]], introduces his girlfriend, [[Kay Adams-Corleone|Kay Adams]], to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a [[popular singer]] and Vito's [[Godparent|godson]], seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his [[consigliere]], [[Tom Hagen]], to Los Angeles to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized [[Stud (animal)|stallion]].\n\nShortly before Christmas, drug baron [[List of The Godfather series characters#Virgil Sollozzo|Sollozzo]], backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, [[Luca Brasi]], to spy on them. Brasi is [[garrote]]d to death during his first meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later, Sollozzo has Vito gunned down in the street, then kidnaps Hagen. With Corleone first-born [[Sonny Corleone|Sonny]] in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo's deal, then releases him. The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi's bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca \"sleeps with the fishes\". Vito survives, and at the hospital, Michael thwarts another attempt on his father. Michael's jaw is broken by [[NYPD]] Capt. McCluskey, Sollozzo's unofficial bodyguard. Sonny retaliates with a [[Contract killing|hit]] on Tattaglia. Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey; feigning a desire to settle the dispute, Michael meets them in a [[The Bronx|Bronx]] restaurant, where after retrieving a handgun planted by [[Peter Clemenza|Clemenza]], a Corleone [[Caporegime|capo]], he kills both men.\n\nDespite a clampdown by the authorities, the [[Five Families (The Godfather)|Five Families]] erupt in open warfare, and Vito fears for his sons' safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]] is sheltered by [[Moe Greene]] in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks Carlo on the street for abusing Connie and threatens to kill him if it happens again. When it does, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and violently murdered by gangsters wielding [[submachine gun]]s. While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries [[List of The Godfather series characters#Apollonia Vitelli-Corleone|Apollonia]], but a [[car bomb]] intended for him takes her life.\n\nDevastated by Sonny's death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant don, [[Emilio Barzini|Barzini]], Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo too weak, Michael takes the family reins. He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Hagen is not a \"wartime consigliere\"; Vito agrees Hagen should \"have no part in what will happen\" in the coming battles with the rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, he is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family.\n\nIn 1955, Vito suffers a fatal heart attack. At the funeral, [[Salvatore Tessio|Tessio]], a Corleone capo, asks Michael to meet with Barzini, signaling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone hitmen murder the other New York City dons and Greene. Tessio is executed for his treachery and Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini; Clemenza immediately garrotes Carlo to death. Connie accuses Michael of the murder, telling Kay that Michael ordered all the killings. Kay is relieved when Michael finally denies it, but when the capos arrive, they address her husband as Don Corleone and she watches them pay reverence to Michael as the newly installed don as they close the door on her.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:TheGodfatherAlPacinoMarlonBrando.jpg|thumb|upright|Al Pacino as Michael Corleone and Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone|alt=A screenshot of Michael and Vito Corleone in ''The Godfather'']]\n{{castlist|\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Vito Corleone]]: [[crime boss]] and founder of the [[Corleone family]]\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Michael Corleone|Michael]]: one of Vito's sons\n* [[James Caan]] as [[Sonny Corleone|Sonny]]: one of Vito's sons\n* [[Richard Castellano]] as [[Peter Clemenza|Clemenza]]: a Corleone confidante\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as [[Tom Hagen]]: Corleone [[consigliere]] and lawyer\n* [[Sterling Hayden]] as Capt.

Together with a succession of mob-theme imitators, it has resulted in a stereotyped concept of Italian-American culture biased toward the criminal networks. The first film had the largest effect. Unlike any film before it, its portrayal of the many poor Italians who immigrated to the United States in the early decades of the 20th century is perhaps attributable to Coppola, and expresses his  understanding of their experience. The films explore the integration of fictional Italian-American criminals into American society. Though set in the period of mass Italian immigration to the U.S., the film explores the specific family of the Corleones, who live outside the law. Although some critics have considered the Corleone story to portray some universal elements of immigration, other critics have suggested that it resulted in viewers overly associating organized crime with Italian-American culture. Produced in a period of intense national cynicism and self-criticism, the film struck a chord about the dual identities felt by many descendants of immigrants.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]] |title=The Godfather: A Cultural Phenomenon |url=http://tags.library.upenn.edu/project/27508 |year=2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007060450/http://tags.library.upenn.edu/project/27508 |archivedate=October 7, 2008}}</ref> ''The Godfather'' increased Hollywood's negative portrayals of immigrant Italians in the aftermath of the film and was a recruiting tool for organized crime.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is The Godfather Effect? |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |first=Megan |last=Gambino |date=January 31, 2012 |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/What-is-The-Godfather-Effect.html |access-date=May 18, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423232235/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/What-is-The-Godfather-Effect.html |archive-date=April 23, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of a mafia \"Godfather\" was a creation of Mario Puzo, and the film resulted in this term being added to the common language.

The story, spanning from 1945 to 1955, chronicles the [[Corleone family]] under patriarch [[Vito Corleone]] (Brando), focusing on the transformation of one of his sons, [[Michael Corleone]] (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless [[American Mafia|mafia]] [[Crime boss|boss]].\n\n[[Paramount Pictures]] obtained the rights to the novel for the price of $80,000, before it gained popularity.<ref name=mjnytgnw>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DkwaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nigEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7006%2C4931444 |work=Milwaukee Journal |agency=(New York Times) |last=Allan |first=John H. |title='Godfather' gives boost to G&W profit picture |date=April 17, 1972 |page=16, part 2 |access-date=July 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121195947/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DkwaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nigEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7006%2C4931444 |archive-date=November 21, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"nytimes19720416\" /> Studio executives had trouble finding a director; their first few candidates turned down the position before Coppola signed on to direct the film.

The film received universal acclaim from critics and audiences, with praise going toward the performances of its cast, particularly by Brando and Pacino, the directing, screenplay, cinematography, editing, score, and portrayal of the mafia. The film revitalized Brando's career, which was in decline during the 1960s. In addition to starring in films such as ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'', [[Superman (1978 film)|''Superman'']], and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', Brando was a catalyst in this film for the successful careers of Coppola, Pacino, and other relative newcomers in the cast. At the [[45th Academy Awards]], the film won the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Brando), and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (for Puzo and Coppola).

It was followed by sequels ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974) and ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990).\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1945 New York City, at his daughter [[Connie Corleone|Connie]]'s wedding to [[Carlo Rizzi (The Godfather)|Carlo]], [[Vito Corleone]] listens to requests in his role as [[Don (honorific)|don]] of the [[Corleone crime family]]. His youngest son, [[Michael Corleone|Michael]], who was a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] during [[World War II]], introduces his girlfriend, [[Kay Adams-Corleone|Kay Adams]], to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a [[popular singer]] and Vito's [[Godparent|godson]], seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his [[consigliere]], [[Tom Hagen]], to Los Angeles to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized [[Stud (animal)|stallion]].\n\nShortly before Christmas, drug baron [[List of The Godfather series characters#Virgil Sollozzo|Sollozzo]], backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, [[Luca Brasi]], to spy on them. Brasi is [[garrote]]d to death during his first meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later, Sollozzo has Vito gunned down in the street, then kidnaps Hagen. With Corleone first-born [[Sonny Corleone|Sonny]] in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo's deal, then releases him. The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi's bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca \"sleeps with the fishes\". Vito survives, and at the hospital, Michael thwarts another attempt on his father. Michael's jaw is broken by [[NYPD]] Capt. McCluskey, Sollozzo's unofficial bodyguard. Sonny retaliates with a [[Contract killing|hit]] on Tattaglia. Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey; feigning a desire to settle the dispute, Michael meets them in a [[The Bronx|Bronx]] restaurant, where after retrieving a handgun planted by [[Peter Clemenza|Clemenza]], a Corleone [[Caporegime|capo]], he kills both men.\n\nDespite a clampdown by the authorities, the [[Five Families (The Godfather)|Five Families]] erupt in open warfare, and Vito fears for his sons' safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]] is sheltered by [[Moe Greene]] in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks Carlo on the street for abusing Connie and threatens to kill him if it happens again. When it does, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and violently murdered by gangsters wielding [[submachine gun]]s. While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries [[List of The Godfather series characters#Apollonia Vitelli-Corleone|Apollonia]], but a [[car bomb]] intended for him takes her life.\n\nDevastated by Sonny's death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant don, [[Emilio Barzini|Barzini]], Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo too weak, Michael takes the family reins. He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Hagen is not a \"wartime consigliere\"; Vito agrees Hagen should \"have no part in what will happen\" in the coming battles with the rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, he is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family.\n\nIn 1955, Vito suffers a fatal heart attack. At the funeral, [[Salvatore Tessio|Tessio]], a Corleone capo, asks Michael to meet with Barzini, signaling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone hitmen murder the other New York City dons and Greene. Tessio is executed for his treachery and Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini; Clemenza immediately garrotes Carlo to death. Connie accuses Michael of the murder, telling Kay that Michael ordered all the killings. Kay is relieved when Michael finally denies it, but when the capos arrive, they address her husband as Don Corleone and she watches them pay reverence to Michael as the newly installed don as they close the door on her.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:TheGodfatherAlPacinoMarlonBrando.jpg|thumb|upright|Al Pacino as Michael Corleone and Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone|alt=A screenshot of Michael and Vito Corleone in ''The Godfather'']]\n{{castlist|\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Vito Corleone]]: [[crime boss]] and founder of the [[Corleone family]]\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Michael Corleone|Michael]]: one of Vito's sons\n* [[James Caan]] as [[Sonny Corleone|Sonny]]: one of Vito's sons\n* [[Richard Castellano]] as [[Peter Clemenza|Clemenza]]: a Corleone confidante\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as [[Tom Hagen]]: Corleone [[consigliere]] and lawyer\n* [[Sterling Hayden]] as Capt.

Together with a succession of mob-theme imitators, it has resulted in a stereotyped concept of Italian-American culture biased toward the criminal networks. The first film had the largest effect. Unlike any film before it, its portrayal of the many poor Italians who immigrated to the United States in the early decades of the 20th century is perhaps attributable to Coppola, and expresses his  understanding of their experience. The films explore the integration of fictional Italian-American criminals into American society. Though set in the period of mass Italian immigration to the U.S., the film explores the specific family of the Corleones, who live outside the law. Although some critics have considered the Corleone story to portray some universal elements of immigration, other critics have suggested that it resulted in viewers overly associating organized crime with Italian-American culture. Produced in a period of intense national cynicism and self-criticism, the film struck a chord about the dual identities felt by many descendants of immigrants.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]] |title=The Godfather: A Cultural Phenomenon |url=http://tags.library.upenn.edu/project/27508 |year=2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007060450/http://tags.library.upenn.edu/project/27508 |archivedate=October 7, 2008}}</ref> ''The Godfather'' increased Hollywood's negative portrayals of immigrant Italians in the aftermath of the film and was a recruiting tool for organized crime.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is The Godfather Effect? |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |first=Megan |last=Gambino |date=January 31, 2012 |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/What-is-The-Godfather-Effect.html |access-date=May 18, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423232235/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/What-is-The-Godfather-Effect.html |archive-date=April 23, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of a mafia \"Godfather\" was a creation of Mario Puzo, and the film resulted in this term being added to the common language.

Instead, they chose to use the term \"digital inclusion,\" providing a definition:\nDigital Inclusion refers to the activities necessary to ensure that all individuals and communities, including the most disadvantaged, have access to and use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).  This includes 5 elements: 1) affordable, robust broadband internet service; 2) internet-enabled devices that meet the needs of the user; 3) access to digital literacy training; 4) quality technical support; 5) applications and online content designed to enable and encourage self-sufficiency, participation and collaboration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalinclusion.org/definitions/|title=NDIA|year=2017|accessdate=June 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSome people{{who|date=July 2019}} are concerned that people without access to the [[internet]] and other information and communication technologies will be disadvantaged, as they are unable or less able to [[Online shopping|shop online]], search for information online, or learn skills needed for [[High tech|technical jobs]]. This results in programs to give computers and related services to people without access.  However, a reverse divide is also happening, as poor and disadvantaged children and teenagers spend more time using digital devices for entertainment and less time interacting with people face-to-face compared to children and teenagers in well-off families.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/style/digital-divide-screens-schools.html|title=The Digital Gap Between Rich and Poor Kids Is Not What We Expected|last=Bowles|first=Nellie|date=2018-10-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nThe divide between differing countries or regions of the world is referred to as the [[#The global digital divide|global digital divide]],<ref name=\"NTIA95\" /><ref>Norris, P.

For example, \"the massive diffusion of narrow-band Internet and mobile phones during the late 1990s\" increased digital inequality, as well as \"the initial introduction of broadband DSL and cable modems during 2003\u20132004 increased levels of inequality\".<ref name=\"HilbertInfoInequality\"/> This is because a new kind of connectivity is never introduced instantaneously and uniformly to society as a whole at once, but diffuses slowly through social networks. As shown by the Figure, during the mid-2000s, communication capacity was more unequally distributed than during the late 1980s, when only fixed-line phones existed. The most recent increase in digital equality stems from the massive diffusion of the latest digital innovations (i.e. fixed and mobile broadband infrastructures, e.g. [[3G]] and fiber optics [[FTTH]]).<ref>SciDevNet (2014) How mobile phones increased the digital divide; http://www.scidev.net/global/data/scidev-net-at-large/how-mobile-phones-increased-the-digital-divide.html</ref>\nMeasurement methodologies of the digital divide, and more specifically an Integrated Iterative Approach General Framework (Integrated Contextual Iterative Approach \u2013 ICI) and the digital divide modeling theory under measurement model DDG (Digital Divide Gap) are  used to analyze the gap existing between developed and developing countries, and the gap among the 27 members-states of the European Union.<ref>Abdalhakim, Hawaf., (2009).

In 2001, fixed-line telecommunication penetration reached 70% of society in developed [[OECD]] countries and 10% of the developing world. This resulted in a ratio of 7 to 1 (divide in relative terms) or a difference of 60% (divide in measured in absolute terms). During the next decade, fixed-line penetration stayed almost constant in OECD countries (at 70%), while the rest of the world started a catch-up, closing the divide to a ratio of 3.5 to 1. The lower graph shows the divide not in terms of ICT devices, but in terms of kbit/s per inhabitant. While the average member of developed countries counted with 29 kbit/s more than a person in developing countries in 2001, this difference got multiplied by a factor of one thousand (to a difference of 2900 kbit/s). In relative terms, the fixed-line capacity divide was even worse during the introduction of broadband Internet at the middle of the first decade of the 2000s, when the OECD counted with 20 times more capacity per capita than the rest of the world.<ref name=\"HilbertInfoInequality\" /> This shows the importance of measuring the divide in terms of kbit/s, and not merely to count devices. The International Telecommunications Union concludes that \"the bit becomes a unifying variable enabling comparisons and aggregations across different kinds of communication technologies\".<ref name=\"ITUmeasuring2012\">[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/publications/idi/material/2012/MIS2012_without_Annex_4.pdf \"Chapter 5: Measuring communication capacity in bits and bytes\"], in Measuring the report Information Society 2012; ITU (International Telecommunication Union) (2012).</ref>\n\n===Skills and digital literacy===\nHowever, research shows that the digital divide is more than just an access issue and cannot be alleviated merely by providing the necessary equipment.

Each component can be looked at from different angles, which leads to a myriad of ways to look at (or define) the digital divide. For example, measurements for the intensity of usages, such as incidence and frequency, vary by study. Some report usage as access to Internet and ICTs while others report usage as having previously connected to the Internet. Some studies focus on specific technologies, others on a combination (such as [[Infostate]], proposed by [[Orbicom-UNESCO]], the [[Digital Opportunity Index]], or [[ITU]]'s [[ICT Development Index]]). Based on different answers to the questions of who, with which kinds of characteristics, connects how and why to what there are hundreds of alternatives ways to define the digital divide.<ref name=\"HilbertDigDiv2011\"/> \"The new consensus recognizes that the key question is not how to connect people to a specific network through a specific device, but how to extend the expected gains from new ICTs.\" <ref>Galperin, H.

The first of three reports is entitled \"Falling Through the Net: A Survey of the \u2018Have Nots\u2019 in Rural and Urban America\" (1995),<ref>National Telecommunications & Information Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce.

(1999). Falling through the net: Defining the digital divide. Washington, D.C. Retrieved from http://www.ntia.doc.gov/report/1999/falling-through-net-defining-digital-divide</ref>  The NTIA\u2019s final report attempted clearly to define the term digital divide; \"the digital divide\u2014the divide between those with access to new technologies and those without\u2014is now one of America's leading economic and civil rights issues.

Retrieved from http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fallingthru.html</ref> The economic gap really comes into play when referring to the older generations.\n\n===Racial gap===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}} \nAlthough many groups in society are affected by a lack of access to computers or the internet, communities of color are specifically observed to be negatively affected by the digital divide. This is evident when it comes to observing home-internet access among different races and ethnicities. 81% of Whites and 83 % of Asians have home internet access, compared to 70% of Hispanics, 68% of Blacks, 72% of American Indian/Alaska Natives, and 68% of Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders. Although income is a factor in home-internet access disparities, there are still racial and ethnic inequalities that are present among those within lower income groups. 58% of low income Whites are reported to have home-internet access in comparison to 51% of Hispanics and 50% of Blacks. This information is reported in a report titled \u201cDigital Denied: The Impact of Systemic Racial Discrimination on Home-Internet Adoption\u201d which was published by the DC-based public interest group Fress Press. The report concludes that structural barriers and discrimination that perpetuates bias against people of different races and ethnicities contribute to having an impact on the digital divide. The report also concludes that those who do not have internet access still have a high demand for it, and reduction in the price of home-internet access would allow for an increase in equitable participation and improve internet adoption by marginalized groups.<ref>https://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/legacy-policy/digital_denied_free_press_report_december_2016.pdf</ref>\n\nDigital censorship and algorithmic bias are observed to be present in the racial divide. Hate-speech rules as well as hate speech algorithms online platforms such as Facebook have favored white males and those belonging to elite groups in society over marginalized groups in society, such as women and people of color. In a collection of internal documents that were collected in a project conducted by ProPublica, Facebook\u2019s guidelines in regards to distinguishing hate speech and recognizing protected groups revealed slides that identified three groups, each one containing either female drivers, black children, or white men. When the question of which subset group is protected is presented, the correct answer was white men . Minority group language is negatively impacted by automated tools of hate detection due to human bias that ultimately decides what is considered hate speech and what is not. \n\nOnline platforms have also been observed to tolerate hateful content towards people of color but restrict content from people of color. Aboriginal memes on a Facebook page were posted with racially abusive content and comments depicting Aboriginal people as inferior. While the contents on the page were removed by the originators after an investigation conducted by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, Facebook did not delete the page and has allowed it to remain under the classification of controversial humor . However, a post by an African American woman addressing her uncomfortableness of being the only person of color in a small-town restaurant was met with racist and hateful messages. When reporting the online abuse to Facebook, her account was suspended by Facebook for three days for posting the screenshots while those responsible for the racist comments she received were not suspended. Shared experiences between people of color can be at risk of being silenced under removal policies for online platforms.\n\n===Disability gap===\nInequities in [[access to information]] technologies are present among individuals living with a disability in comparison to those who are not living with a disability. According to The Pew Research Center, 54% of households with a person who has a disability have home internet access compared to 81% of households that have home internet access and do not have a person who has a disability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2011/01/21/americans-living-with-disability-and-their-technology-profile/|title=Americans living with disability and their technology profile|last=NW|first=1615 L.

However, there is still a lack of access to technology and home internet access among those who have a cognitive and auditory disability as well. There is a concern of whether or not the increase in the use of information technologies will increase equality through offering opportunities for individuals living with disabilities or whether it will only add to the present inequalities and lead to individuals living with disabilities being left behind in society. Issues such as the perception of disabilities in society, Federal and state government policy, corporate policy, mainstream computing technologies, and real-time online communication have been found to contribute to the impact of the digital divide on individuals with disabilities .\n\nPeople with disabilities are also the targets of online abuse. Online disability hate crimes have increased by 33% across the UK between 2016-17 and 2017-18 according to a report published by [[Leonard Cheshire Disability|Leonard Cheshire]], a health and welfare charity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/10/online-hate-against-disabled-people-rises-by-a-third|title=Online hate crime against disabled people rises by a third|date=2019-05-10|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> Accounts of online hate abuse towards people with disabilities were shared during an incident in 2019 when model Katie Price's son was the target of online abuse that was attributed to him having a disability. In response to the abuse, a campaign was launched by Katie Price to ensure that Britain's MP's held those who are guilty of perpetuating online abuse towards those with disabilities accountable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-42964068/katie-price-calls-on-mps-to-make-online-abuse-criminal-offence|title='He can\u2019t speak to defend himself, I can'|website=BBC News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> Online abuse towards individuals with disabilities is a factor that can discourage people from engaging online which could prevent people from learning information that could improve their lives. Many individuals living with disabilities face online abuse in the form of accusations of benefit fraud and \u201cfaking\u201d their disability for financial gain, which in some cases leads to unnecessary investigations.\n\n===Gender gap===\n''Main article: [[Gender digital divide]]''\n\nA paper published by J. Cooper from Princeton University points out that learning technology is designed to be receptive to men instead of women. The reasoning for this is that most software engineers and programmers are men, and they communicate their learning software in a way that would match the reception of their recipient. The association of computers in education is normally correlated with the male gender, and this has an impact on the education of computers and technology among women, although it is important to mention that there are plenty of learning softwares that are designed to help women and girls learn technology. Overall, the study presents the problem of various perspectives in society that are a result of gendered socialization patterns that believe that computers are a part of the male experience since computers have traditionally presented as a toy for boys when they are children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.pcw.gov.ph/sites/default/files/digital%20divide%20special%20case%20of%20gender.pdf</ref> This divide is followed as children grow older and young girls are not encouraged as much to pursue degrees in IT and computer science. In 1990, the percentage of women in computing jobs was 36%, however in 2016, this number had fallen to 25%. This can be seen in the underrepresentation of women in IT hubs such as Silicon Valley (.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/why-is-silicon-valley-so-awful-to-women/517788/</ref>\n\nThere has also been the presence of algorithmic bias that has been shown in machine learning algorithms that are implemented by major companies.{{clarify |date=March 2020 |reason=\"Major companies\", plural, is claimed, but only a single company is mentioned and referenced.}} In 2015, Amazon had to abandon a recruiting algorithm that showed a difference between ratings that candidates received for software developer jobs as well as other technical jobs. As a result, it was revealed that Amazon's machine algorithm was biased against women and favored male resumes over female resumes. This was due to the fact that Amazon's computer models were trained to vet patterns in resumes over a 10 year period. During this ten year period, the majority of the resumes belong to male individuals, which is a reflection of male dominance across the tech industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G</ref>\n\n===LGBTQIA gap===\nA number of states, including some that have introduced new laws since 2010, notably censor voices from and content related to the LGBTQI community, posing serious consequences to access to information about sexual orientation and gender identity. Digital platforms play a powerful role in limiting access to certain content, such as YouTube's 2017 decision to classify non-explicit videos with LGBTQIA themes as \u2018restricted\u2019, a classification designed to filter out \u2018potentially inappropriate content\u2019.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hunt|first=Elle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/20/lgbt-community-anger-over-youtube-restrictions-which-make-their-videos-invisible|title=LGBT community anger over YouTube restrictions which make their videos invisible|date=2017-03-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The internet provides information that can create a safe space for marginalized groups such as the LGBTQIA community to connect with others and engage in honest dialogues and conversations that are affecting their communities. It can also be viewed as an agent of change for the LGBTQIA community and provide a means of engaging in social justice. It can allow for LGBTQIA individuals who may be living in rural areas or in areas where they are isolated to gain access to information that are not within their rural system as well as gaining information from other LGBT individuals. This includes information such as healthcare, partners, and news. GayHealth provides online medical and health information and Gay and Lesbians Alliance Against Defamation contains online publications and news that focus on human rights campaigns and issues focused on LGBTQIA issues. The Internet also allows LGBTQIA individuals to maintain anonymity. Lack of access to the internet can hinder these things, due to lack of broadband access in remote rural areas. LGBT Tech has emphasized launching newer technologies with 5G technology in order to help close the digital divide that can cause members of the LGBTQIA community to lose access to reliable and fast technology that can provide information on healthcare, economic opportunities, and safe communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lgbttech.org/post/the-potential-of-5g-to-reduce-the-digital-divide|title=The potential of 5G to reduce the digital divide|last=Director &amp;amp;amp;|first=Carlos Gutierrez-Deputy|date=2020-01-27|website=lgbttech|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n===Age gap===\n\nOlder adults, those ages 60 and up, face various barriers that contribute to their lack of access to information and communication technologies (ICTs).

They may be unable to afford internet access or lack transportation to use computers in public spaces, the benefits of which would be enhancing their health and reducing their social isolation and depression.

Since more than 40% of the world population lives on less than US$2 per day, and around 20% live on less than US$1 per day (or less than US$365 per year), these income segments would have to spend one third of their income on ICT (120/365 = 33%). The global average of ICT spending is at a mere 3% of income.<ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\"/> Potential solutions include driving down the costs of ICT, which includes low-cost technologies and shared access through [[Telecentre]]s.\n\nFurthermore, even though individuals might be capable of accessing the Internet, many are thwarted by barriers to entry, such as a lack of means to infrastructure or the inability to comprehend the information that the Internet provides. Lack of adequate infrastructure and lack of knowledge are two major obstacles that impede mass connectivity. These barriers limit individuals' capabilities in what they can do and what they can achieve in accessing technology. Some individuals can connect, but they do not have the knowledge to use what information ICTs and Internet technologies provide them. This leads to a focus on capabilities and skills, as well as awareness to move from mere access to effective usage of ICT.<ref name=\":2\">Karen Mossberger (2003). Virtual Inequality: Beyond the Digital Divide. Georgetown University Press</ref>\n\nThe [[United Nations]] is aiming to raise awareness of the divide by way of the [[World Information Society Day]] which has taken place yearly since May 17, 2006.<ref>[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/news-and-in-focus-articles/in-focus-articles/ United Nations Educational] UNDay</ref> It also set up the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Task Force in November 2001.<ref>[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/dev2353.doc.htm \"UN Information and Communication Technologies (ITC) Task Force Launched Today at Headquarters\"], Press Release, United Nations (New York), November 20, 2001</ref>  Later [[UN]] initiatives in this area are the [[World Summit on the Information Society]], which was set up in 2003, and the [[Internet Governance Forum]], set up in 2006.\n\nIn the year 2000, the [[United Nations Volunteers]] (UNV) programme launched its Online Volunteering service,<ref>[https://onlinevolunteering.org Online Volunteering]</ref> which uses ICT as a vehicle for and in support of volunteering. It constitutes an example of a volunteering initiative that effectively contributes to bridge the digital divide. ICT-enabled volunteering has a clear added value for development. If more people collaborate online with more development institutions and initiatives, this will imply an increase in person-hours dedicated to development cooperation at essentially no additional cost. This is the most visible effect of online volunteering for human development.<ref>Acevedo, Manuel. 2005.

The former describes phenomena such as the divided users' demographics that make up sites such as Facebook and Myspace or Word Press and Tumblr. Each of these sites hosts thriving communities that engage with otherwise [[marginalized]] populations. An example of this is the large online community devoted to Afrofuturism, a discourse that critiques dominant structures of power by merging themes of science fiction and blackness. Social media brings together minds that may not otherwise meet, allowing for the free exchange of ideas and empowerment of marginalized discourses.\n\n=== Libraries ===\n[[File:13394-Laptops Anytime Launch-6629 (10844113484).jpg|thumb|A laptop lending kiosk at [[Texas A&M University\u2013Commerce]]'s Gee Library]]\n\nAttempts to bridge the digital divide include a program developed in Durban, South Africa, where deficient access to technology and a lack of documented cultural heritage has motivated the creation of an \"online indigenous digital library as part of public library services.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Greyling | first1 = E. | last2 = Zulu | first2 = S. | year = 2010 | title = Content development in an indigenous digital library: A case study in community participation | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b4190d9002582db2c23292cf7828d9ca3d273016| journal = IFLA Journal | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 30\u20139 | doi = 10.1177/0340035209359570 }}</ref> This project has the potential to narrow the digital divide by not only giving the people of the Durban area access to this digital resource, but also by incorporating the community members into the process of creating it.\n\nTo address the divide [[The Gates Foundation]] started the Gates Library Initiative which provides training  assistance and guidance in libraries.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | last1 = Blau | first1 = A | year = 2002 | title = Access isn't enough: Merely connecting people and computers won't close the digital divide | url = | journal = American Libraries | volume = 33 | issue = 6| pages = 50\u201352 }}</ref>\n\nIn nations where poverty compounds effects of the digital divide, programs are emerging to counter those trends.  In Kenya, lack of funding, language, and technology illiteracy contributed to an overall lack of computer skills and educational advancement. This slowly began to change when foreign investment began.{{cn|date=August 2019}} In the early 2000s, the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] funded a revitalization project through the [[Kenya National Library Service]].  Those resources enabled public libraries to provide information and communication technologies to their patrons.  In 2012, public libraries in the [[Busia County|Busia]] and [[Kiberia]] communities introduced technology resources to supplement curriculum for primary schools. By 2013, the program expanded into ten schools.<ref>Pingo, Z. B. (2015). The transition from Camel Libraries to Digital Technologies in Kenya Public Libraries.

CI is concerned with ensuring the opportunity not only for ICT access at the community level but also, according to [[Michael Gurstein]], that the means for the \"effective use\" of ICTs for community betterment and empowerment are available.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gurstein|first=Michael|title=Effective use: A community informatics strategy beyond the digital divide|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/1107/1027|accessdate=June 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309051347/http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/1107/1027|archive-date=March 9, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Gurstein has also extended the discussion of the digital divide to include issues around access to and the use of \"open data\" and coined the term \"data divide\" to refer to this issue area.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gurstein|first=Michael|title=Open data: Empowering the empowered or effective data use for everyone?|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/3316/2764|accessdate=June 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124005256/http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/3316/2764|archive-date=November 24, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Implications==\n\n===Social capital===\nOnce an individual is connected, Internet connectivity and ICTs can enhance his or her future social and cultural capital. [[Social capital]] is acquired through repeated interactions with other individuals or groups of individuals. Connecting to the Internet creates another set of means by which to achieve repeated interactions. ICTs and Internet connectivity enable repeated interactions through access to social networks, chat rooms, and gaming sites. Once an individual has access to connectivity, obtains infrastructure by which to connect, and can understand and use the information that ICTs and connectivity provide, that individual is capable of becoming a \"digital citizen.\" <ref name=\"MossbergerRacePlace\"/>\n\n=== Economic disparity ===\nIn the United States, the research provided by Sungard Availability Services notes a direct correlation between a company's access to technological advancements and its overall success in bolstering the economy.<ref name=\"Forbes1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2016/07/16/lack-of-digital-cloud-opportunities-is-actually-embarrassing-for-employees-survey-suggests/|title=Lack Of Digital, Cloud Opportunities Is Actually Embarrassing For Employees, Survey Suggests|last=McKendrick|first=Joe|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-04-17}}</ref>&nbsp;The study, which includes over 2,000 IT executives and staff officers, indicates that 69 percent of employees feel they do not have access to sufficient technology in order to make their jobs easier, while 63 percent of them believe the lack of technological mechanisms hinders their ability to develop new work skills.<ref name=Forbes1/>&nbsp;Additional analysis provides more evidence to show how the digital divide also affects the economy in places all over the world.

[[Web 2.0]] technologies like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Blogs enable users to participate online and create content without having to understand how the technology actually works, leading to an ever-increasing digital divide between those who have the skills and understanding to interact more fully with the technology and those who are passive consumers of it.<ref name=\"Reilley\" /> Many are only nominal content creators through the use of Web 2.0, posting photos and status updates on Facebook, but not truly interacting with the technology.\n\nSome of the reasons for this production gap include material factors like the type of Internet connection one has and the frequency of access to the Internet. The more frequently a person has access to the Internet and the faster the connection, the more opportunities they have to gain the technology skills and the more time they have to be creative.<ref name=\"Schradie\">{{cite journal | last1 = Schradie | first1 = Jen | year = 2011 | title = The Digital Production Gap: The Digital Divide and Web 2.0 Collide | url = http://sociology.berkeley.edu/documents/newspage_docs/J.%20Schradie%20-%20The%20Digital%20Production%20Gap%20for%20Web%20Post%20Poetics.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120227005023/http://sociology.berkeley.edu/documents/newspage_docs/J.%20Schradie%20-%20The%20Digital%20Production%20Gap%20for%20Web%20Post%20Poetics.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2012-02-27 | journal = Poetics | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 145\u2013168 | doi = 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.003 }}</ref>\n\nOther reasons include cultural factors often associated with class and socioeconomic status.

The term \"digital divide\" does not necessarily mean that someone does not have technology; it could mean that there is simply a difference in technology.  These differences can refer to, for example, high-quality computers, fast Internet, technical assistance, or telephone services. The difference between all of these is also considered a gap.\n\nThere is a large inequality worldwide in terms of the distribution of installed telecommunication bandwidth. In 2014 only three countries (China, US, Japan) host 50% of the globally installed bandwidth potential (see pie-chart Figure on the right).<ref name=\"HilbertBitsDivide\"/> This concentration is not new, as historically only ten countries have hosted 70\u201375% of the global telecommunication capacity (see Figure). The U.S. lost its global leadership in terms of installed bandwidth in 2011, being replaced by China, which hosts more than twice as much national bandwidth potential in 2014 (29% versus 13% of the global total).<ref name=\"HilbertBitsDivide\"/>\n\n===Versus the digital divide===\nThe global digital divide is a special case of the digital divide; the focus is set on the fact that \"Internet has developed unevenly throughout the world\"<ref name=Guillen-2005/>{{rp|681}} causing some countries to fall behind in technology, education, labor, democracy, and tourism.  The concept of the digital divide was originally popularized regarding the disparity in Internet access between rural and urban areas of the United States of America; the ''global'' digital divide mirrors this disparity on an international scale.\n\nThe global digital divide also contributes to the inequality of access to goods and services available through technology.  Computers and the Internet provide users with improved education, which can lead to higher wages; the people living in nations with limited access are therefore disadvantaged.<ref>Krueger 1993; Attewell and Battle 1999.</ref> This global divide is often characterized as falling along what is sometimes called the [[North\u2013South divide]] of \"northern\" wealthier nations and \"southern\" poorer ones.\n\n===Obstacles to a solution===\nSome people argue that necessities need to be considered before achieving digital inclusion, such as an ample food supply and quality health care.  Minimizing the global digital divide requires considering and addressing the following types of access:\n\n====Physical access====\nInvolves \"the distribution of ICT devices per capita\u2026and land lines per thousands\".<ref name=Wilson-2004/>{{rp|306}}  Individuals need to obtain access to computers, landlines, and networks in order to access the Internet. This access barrier is also addressed in Article 21 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by the United Nations.\n\n====Financial access====\nThe cost of ICT devices, traffic, applications, technician and educator training, software, maintenance, and infrastructures require ongoing financial means.<ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\" />\nFinancial access and \"the levels of household income play a significant role in widening the gap\" <ref>\u201cDigital Divide.\u201d The Digital Divide, Stanford University, cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/digital-divide/start.html. Retrieved September 19, 2017.</ref>\n\n====Socio-demographic access====\nEmpirical tests have identified that several socio-demographic characteristics foster or limit ICT access and usage. Among different countries, educational levels and income are the most powerful explanatory variables, with age being a third one.<ref name=\"HilbertDigDiv2011\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin| title = The end justifies the definition: The manifold outlooks on the digital divide and their practical usefulness for policy-making | doi = 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.06.012 | journal = Telecommunications Policy | volume = 35 | issue = 8 | pages = 715\u2013736| year = 2011 | url = http://martinhilbert.net/ManifoldDigitalDivide_Hilbert_AAM.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\"/>\n\nWhile a Global Gender Gap in access and usage of ICT's exist, empirical evidence shows that this is due to unfavorable conditions concerning employment, education and income and not to technophobia or lower ability.

(March 21, 2014). Retrieved April 13, 2014, from http://www.internetworldstats.com/links10.htm</ref>\n\n*Economic equality \u2013 For example, the telephone is often seen as one of the most important components, because having access to a working telephone can lead to higher safety. If there were to be an emergency, one could easily call for help if one could use a nearby phone. In another example, many work-related tasks are online, and people without access to the Internet may not be able to complete work up to company standards. The Internet is regarded by some as a basic component of civic life that developed countries ought to guarantee for their citizens. Additionally, welfare services, for example, are sometimes offered via the Internet.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n*Social mobility \u2013 Computer and Internet use is regarded as being very important to development and success. However, some children are not getting as much technical education as others, because lower socioeconomic areas cannot afford to provide schools with computer facilities. For this reason, some kids are being separated and not receiving the same chance as others to be successful.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n*Democracy \u2013 Some people believe that eliminating the digital divide would help countries become healthier democracies. They argue that communities would become much more involved in events such as elections or decision making.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00418|title=Inclusion of excluded groups in decision-making in the development of technologies|last=Social Impact Open Repository|date=2011|website=SIOR|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905142527/http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00418|archive-date=September 5, 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=September 5, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n*Economic growth \u2013 It is believed that less-developed nations could gain quick access to economic growth if the information infrastructure were to be developed and well used. By improving the latest technologies, certain countries and industries can gain a competitive advantage.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n\nWhile these four arguments are meant to lead to a solution to the digital divide, there are a couple of other components that need to be considered. The first one is rural living versus suburban living. Rural areas used to have very minimal access to the Internet, for example. However, nowadays, power lines and satellites are used to increase the availability in these areas. Another component to keep in mind is disabilities. Some people may have the highest quality technologies, but a disability they have may keep them from using these technologies to their fullest extent.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n\nUsing previous studies (Gamos, 2003; Nsengiyuma & Stork, 2005; Harwit, 2004 as cited in James), James asserts that in developing countries, \"internet use has taken place overwhelmingly among the upper-income, educated, and urban segments\" largely due to the high literacy rates of this sector of the population.<ref name=James-2008>{{cite journal | last1 = James | first1 = J | year = 2008 | title = Digital Divide Complacency: Misconceptions and Dangers | journal = The Information Society | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 54\u201361 | doi = 10.1080/01972240701774790 }}</ref>{{rp|58}} As such, James suggests that part of the solution requires that developing countries first build up the literacy/language skills, [[computer literacy]], and technical competence that low-income and rural populations need in order to make use of ICT.\n\nIt has also been suggested that there is a correlation between democrat regimes and the growth of the Internet. One hypothesis by Gullen is, \"The more democratic the polity, the greater the Internet use...The government can try to control the Internet by monopolizing control\" and Norris ''et al.'' also contends, \"If there is less government control of it, the Internet flourishes, and it is associated with greater democracy and civil liberties.<ref name=PickAndAzari-2008>{{cite journal | last1 = Pick | first1 = J. | last2 = Azari | first2 = R. | year = 2008 | title = Global Digital Divide: Influence of Socioeconomic, Governmental, and Accessibility Factors on Information Technology | url = | journal = Information Technology for Development | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 91\u2013115 | doi=10.1002/itdj.20095}}</ref>\n\nFrom an economic perspective, Pick and Azari state that \"in developing nations\u2026foreign direct investment (FDI), primary education, educational investment, access to education, and government prioritization of ICT as all-important\".<ref name=PickAndAzari-2008/>{{rp|112}} Specific solutions proposed by the study include: \"invest in stimulating, attracting, and growing creative technical and scientific workforce; increase the access to education and digital literacy; reduce the gender divide and empower women to participate in the ICT workforce; emphasize investing in intensive Research and Development for selected metropolitan areas and regions within nations\".<ref name=PickAndAzari-2008/>{{rp|111}}\n\nThere are projects worldwide that have implemented, to various degrees, the solutions outlined above.  Many such projects have taken the form of Information Communications Technology Centers (ICT centers).  Rahnman explains that \"the main role of ICT intermediaries is defined as an organization providing effective support to local communities in the use and adaptation of technology.  Most commonly, an ICT intermediary will be a specialized organization from outside the community, such as a non-governmental organization, local government, or international donor. On the other hand, a social intermediary is defined as a local institution from within the community, such as a community-based organization.<ref>Rahman, H. (2006). ''Empowering Marginal Communities and Information Networking''. Hershey, Pennsylvania: Idea Group Publishing.</ref>{{rp|128}}\n\nOther proposed solutions that the Internet promises for developing countries are the provision of efficient communications within and among developing countries so that citizens worldwide can effectively help each other to solve their problems. Grameen Banks and Kiva loans are two microcredit systems designed to help citizens worldwide to contribute online towards entrepreneurship in developing communities. Economic opportunities range from entrepreneurs who can afford the hardware and broadband access required to maintain Internet caf\u00e9s to agribusinesses having control over the seeds they plant.\n\nAt the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the IMARA organization (from [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word for \"power\") sponsors a variety of outreach programs which bridge the Global Digital Divide. Its aim is to find and implement long-term, sustainable solutions which will increase the availability of educational technology and resources to domestic and international communities. These projects are run under the aegis of the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] (CSAIL) and staffed by MIT volunteers who give training, install and donate computer setups in greater [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Kenya]], Indian reservations the American Southwest such as the [[Navajo Nation]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]].

Amongst them, are its ability to offer a means of interacting with others, user-friendly features, and the fact that most sites are available at no cost.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/> The problem with social media, however, is that it can be accessible, provided that there is physical access.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/> Nevertheless, with its ability to encourage digital inclusion, social media can be used as a tool to bridge the global digital divide.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/>\n\nSome cities in the world have started programs to bridge the digital divide for their residents, school children, students, parents and the elderly. One such program, founded in 1996, was sponsored by the city of Boston and called the Boston Digital Bridge Foundation.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20021008225433/http://www.digitalbridgefoundation.org/ (Boston) Digital Bridge Foundation]</ref> It especially concentrates on school children and their parents, helping to make both equally and similarly knowledgeable about computers, using application programs, and navigating the Internet.<ref>[http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/Default.aspx?id=1479 \"Mayor Menino, Boston Digital Bridge Foundation Host Evening on the Bridge 2.0 Celebration\"], Mayor's Office, Boston, Press Release, September 26, 2002</ref><ref>[http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/default.aspx?id=4765 \"City of Boston Receives $4.3 Million Grant That Will Give Training, Computers and Opportunity to Underserved Communities\"], City of Boston press office, September 14, 2010</ref>\n\n===Free Basics===\n{{Main|Free Basics}}\n\nFree Basics is a partnership between social networking services company Facebook and six companies (Samsung, Ericsson, MediaTek, Opera Software, Nokia and Qualcomm) that plans to bring affordable access to selected Internet services to less developed countries by increasing efficiency, and facilitating the development of new business models around the provision of Internet access. In the whitepaper<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scontent-cdg2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/12057105_1001874746531417_622371037_n.pdf?oh=4a6afa24c125a3debe1784bcacefa8b4&oe=5B03C427|title=Is connectivity a human right?|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> realised by Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, connectivity is asserted as a \"human right\", and Internet.org is created to improve Internet access for people around the world.\n\n\"Free Basics provides people with access to useful services on their mobile phones in markets where internet access may be less affordable. The websites are available for free without data charges, and include content about news, employment, health, education and local information etc. By introducing people to the benefits of the internet through these websites, we hope to bring more people online and help improve their lives.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://info.internet.org/en/|title=Internet.org:About|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Free Basics is also accused of violating [[net neutrality]] for limiting access to handpicked services. Despite a wide deployment in numerous countries, it has been met with heavy resistance notably in India where the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India eventually banned it in 2016.\n\n===Satellite constellations===\n\nSeveral projects to bring internet to the entire world with a [[satellite constellation]] have been devised in the last decade, one of these being [[Starlink (satellite constellation)|Starlink]] by [[Elon Musk]]'s company [[SpaceX]]. Unlike Free Basics, it would provide people with a full internet access and would not be limited to a few selected services. In the same week Starlink was announced, serial-entrepreneur Richard Branson announced his own project [[OneWeb satellite constellation|OneWeb]], a similar constellation with approximately 700 satellites that has already procured communication frequency licenses for their broadcast spectrum and could possibly be operational as early as in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-satellite-entrepreneurs-20150117-story.html|title=Elon Musk and Richard Branson invest in satellite-Internet ventures|last=|first=|date=January 17, 2015|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe biggest hurdle to these projects is the astronomical, financial, and logistical cost of launching so many satellites. After the failure of previous satellite-to-consumer space ventures, satellite industry consultant Roger Rusch said \"It's highly unlikely that you can make a successful business out of this.\" Musk has publicly acknowledged this business reality, and indicated in mid-2015 that while endeavoring to develop this technically-complicated space-based communication system he wants to avoid overextending the company and stated that they are being measured in the pace of development.\n\n===One Laptop per Child===\n\n[[One Laptop per Child]] (OLPC) is another attempt to narrow the digital divide.<ref name=\"wiki.laptop.org\">[http://one.laptop.org/about/mission One Laptop Per Child]. (2009).</ref> This organization, founded in 2005, provides inexpensively produced \"XO\" laptops (dubbed the \"$100 laptop\", though actual production costs vary) to children residing in poor and isolated regions within developing countries. Each laptop belongs to an individual child and provides a gateway to digital learning and Internet access. The XO laptops are designed to withstand more abuse than higher-end machines, and they contain features in context to the unique conditions that remote villages present. Each laptop is constructed to use as little power as possible, have a sunlight-readable screen, and is capable of automatically networking with other XO laptops in order to access the Internet\u2014as many as 500 machines can share a single point of access.<ref name=\"wiki.laptop.org\"/>\n\n==World Summit on the Information Society==\n{{Main |World Summit on the Information Society}}\n\nSeveral of the 67 principles adopted at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] convened by the [[United Nations]] in Geneva in 2003 directly address the digital divide:<ref name=WSIS-03>[http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs/geneva/official/dop.html \"Declaration of Principles\"], WSIS-03/GENEVA/DOC/4-E, World Summit on the Information Society, Geneva, December 12, 2003</ref>\n:10. We are also fully aware that the benefits of the information technology revolution are today unevenly distributed between the developed and developing countries and within societies. We are fully committed to turning this digital divide into a digital opportunity for all, particularly for those who risk being left behind and being further marginalized.\n:11. We are committed to realizing our common vision of the Information Society for ourselves and for future generations. We recognize that young people are the future workforce and leading creators and earliest adopters of ICTs. They must therefore be empowered as learners, developers, contributors, entrepreneurs and decision-makers. We must focus especially on young people who have not yet been able to benefit fully from the opportunities provided by ICTs. We are also committed to ensuring that the development of ICT applications and operation of services respects the rights of children as well as their protection and well-being.\n:12. We affirm that development of ICTs provides enormous opportunities for women, who should be an integral part of, and key actors, in the Information Society. We are committed to ensuring that the Information Society enables women's empowerment and their full participation on the basis on equality in all spheres of society and in all decision-making processes. To this end, we should mainstream a gender equality perspective and use ICTs as a tool to that end.\n:13. In building the Information Society, we shall pay particular attention to the special needs of marginalized and vulnerable groups of society, including migrants, internally displaced persons and refugees, unemployed and underprivileged people, minorities and nomadic people. We shall also recognize the special needs of older persons and persons with disabilities.\n:14. We are resolute to empower the poor, particularly those living in remote, rural and marginalized urban areas, to access information and to use ICTs as a tool to support their efforts to lift themselves out of poverty.\n:15. In the evolution of the Information Society, particular attention must be given to the special situation of indigenous peoples, as well as to the preservation of their heritage and their cultural legacy.\n:16. We continue to pay special attention to the particular needs of people of developing countries, countries with economies in transition, Least Developed Countries, Small Island Developing States, Landlocked Developing Countries, Highly Indebted Poor Countries, countries and territories under occupation, countries recovering from conflict and countries and regions with special needs as well as to conditions that pose severe threats to development, such as natural disasters.\n:21. Connectivity is a central enabling agent in building the Information Society. Universal, ubiquitous, equitable and affordable access to ICT infrastructure and services, constitutes one of the challenges of the Information Society and should be an objective of all stakeholders involved in building it. Connectivity also involves access to energy and postal services, which should be assured in conformity with the domestic legislation of each country.\n:28. We strive to promote universal access with equal opportunities for all to scientific knowledge and the creation and dissemination of scientific and technical information, including open access initiatives for scientific publishing.\n:46. In building the Information Society, States are strongly urged to take steps with a view to the avoidance of, and refrain from, any unilateral measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that impedes the full achievement of economic and social development by the population of the affected countries, and that hinders the well-being of their population.\n\n==See also==\n{{Library resources box}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Achievement gap]]\n* [[Participation (decision making)#Civic opportunity gap|Civic opportunity gap]]\n* [[Computer technology for developing areas]]\n* [[Digital divide by country]]\n* [[Digital divide in Canada]]\n* [[Digital divide in China]]\n* [[Digital divide in South Africa]]\n* [[Digital divide in Thailand]]\n* [[Digital divide in the United States]]\n* [[Digital rights]]\n* [[Digital Society Day]] (October 17 in India)\n* [[Gender digital divide]]\n* [[Global Internet usage]]\n* [[Information society]]\n* [[International communication]]\n* [[Internet Geography|Internet geography]]\n* [[Internet governance]]\n* [[List of countries by Internet connection speeds]]\n* [[National broadband plans from around the world]]\n* [[NetDay]]\n* [[One Laptop per Child]]\n* [[Rural Internet]]\n* [[World Summit on the Information Society]]\n\n;Groups devoted to digital divide issues:\n* [[Center for Digital Inclusion]]\n* [[Digital Textbook]] a [[South Korea]]n Project that intends to distribute tablet notebooks to elementary school students.\n* [[Inveneo]]\n* [[TechChange]]\n* [[United Nations Information and Communication Technologies Task Force]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = I'd blush if I could: closing gender divides in digital skills through education\n| author = UNESCO, EQUALS Skills Coalition\n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = UNESCO\n| documentURL = https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000367416\n| license statement URL = \n| license = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist |30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Azam, M.

As shown by the Figure, during the mid-2000s, communication capacity was more unequally distributed than during the late 1980s, when only fixed-line phones existed. The most recent increase in digital equality stems from the massive diffusion of the latest digital innovations (i.e. fixed and mobile broadband infrastructures, e.g. [[3G]] and fiber optics [[FTTH]]).<ref>SciDevNet (2014) How mobile phones increased the digital divide; http://www.scidev.net/global/data/scidev-net-at-large/how-mobile-phones-increased-the-digital-divide.html</ref>\nMeasurement methodologies of the digital divide, and more specifically an Integrated Iterative Approach General Framework (Integrated Contextual Iterative Approach \u2013 ICI) and the digital divide modeling theory under measurement model DDG (Digital Divide Gap) are  used to analyze the gap existing between developed and developing countries, and the gap among the 27 members-states of the European Union.<ref>Abdalhakim, Hawaf., (2009).

In 2001, fixed-line telecommunication penetration reached 70% of society in developed [[OECD]] countries and 10% of the developing world. This resulted in a ratio of 7 to 1 (divide in relative terms) or a difference of 60% (divide in measured in absolute terms). During the next decade, fixed-line penetration stayed almost constant in OECD countries (at 70%), while the rest of the world started a catch-up, closing the divide to a ratio of 3.5 to 1. The lower graph shows the divide not in terms of ICT devices, but in terms of kbit/s per inhabitant. While the average member of developed countries counted with 29 kbit/s more than a person in developing countries in 2001, this difference got multiplied by a factor of one thousand (to a difference of 2900 kbit/s). In relative terms, the fixed-line capacity divide was even worse during the introduction of broadband Internet at the middle of the first decade of the 2000s, when the OECD counted with 20 times more capacity per capita than the rest of the world.<ref name=\"HilbertInfoInequality\" /> This shows the importance of measuring the divide in terms of kbit/s, and not merely to count devices. The International Telecommunications Union concludes that \"the bit becomes a unifying variable enabling comparisons and aggregations across different kinds of communication technologies\".<ref name=\"ITUmeasuring2012\">[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/publications/idi/material/2012/MIS2012_without_Annex_4.pdf \"Chapter 5: Measuring communication capacity in bits and bytes\"], in Measuring the report Information Society 2012; ITU (International Telecommunication Union) (2012).</ref>\n\n===Skills and digital literacy===\nHowever, research shows that the digital divide is more than just an access issue and cannot be alleviated merely by providing the necessary equipment.

New York: Neal-Schuman Publishers.</ref> Most commonly, a digital divide stems from poverty and the economic barriers that limit resources and prevent people from obtaining or otherwise using newer technologies.\n\nIn research, while each explanation is examined, others must be controlled in order to eliminate [[interaction effects]] or [[Mediation (statistics)|mediating variables]],<ref name=\"MossbergerRacePlace\">{{cite journal | last1 = Mossberger | first1 = Karen | last2 = Tolbert | first2 = Carolina J. | last3 = Gilbert | first3 = Michele | year = 2006 | title = Race, Place, and Information Technology (IT) | url = https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&context=ncdg| journal = Urban Affairs Review | volume = 41 | issue = 5| pages = 583\u2013620 | doi=10.1177/1078087405283511}}</ref> but these explanations are meant to stand as general trends, not direct causes. Each component can be looked at from different angles, which leads to a myriad of ways to look at (or define) the digital divide. For example, measurements for the intensity of usages, such as incidence and frequency, vary by study. Some report usage as access to Internet and ICTs while others report usage as having previously connected to the Internet. Some studies focus on specific technologies, others on a combination (such as [[Infostate]], proposed by [[Orbicom-UNESCO]], the [[Digital Opportunity Index]], or [[ITU]]'s [[ICT Development Index]]). Based on different answers to the questions of who, with which kinds of characteristics, connects how and why to what there are hundreds of alternatives ways to define the digital divide.<ref name=\"HilbertDigDiv2011\"/> \"The new consensus recognizes that the key question is not how to connect people to a specific network through a specific device, but how to extend the expected gains from new ICTs.\" <ref>Galperin, H.

The first of three reports is entitled \"Falling Through the Net: A Survey of the \u2018Have Nots\u2019 in Rural and Urban America\" (1995),<ref>National Telecommunications & Information Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce.

(1999). Falling through the net: Defining the digital divide. Washington, D.C. Retrieved from http://www.ntia.doc.gov/report/1999/falling-through-net-defining-digital-divide</ref>  The NTIA\u2019s final report attempted clearly to define the term digital divide; \"the digital divide\u2014the divide between those with access to new technologies and those without\u2014is now one of America's leading economic and civil rights issues.

Retrieved from http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fallingthru.html</ref> The economic gap really comes into play when referring to the older generations.\n\n===Racial gap===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}} \nAlthough many groups in society are affected by a lack of access to computers or the internet, communities of color are specifically observed to be negatively affected by the digital divide. This is evident when it comes to observing home-internet access among different races and ethnicities. 81% of Whites and 83 % of Asians have home internet access, compared to 70% of Hispanics, 68% of Blacks, 72% of American Indian/Alaska Natives, and 68% of Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders. Although income is a factor in home-internet access disparities, there are still racial and ethnic inequalities that are present among those within lower income groups. 58% of low income Whites are reported to have home-internet access in comparison to 51% of Hispanics and 50% of Blacks. This information is reported in a report titled \u201cDigital Denied: The Impact of Systemic Racial Discrimination on Home-Internet Adoption\u201d which was published by the DC-based public interest group Fress Press. The report concludes that structural barriers and discrimination that perpetuates bias against people of different races and ethnicities contribute to having an impact on the digital divide. The report also concludes that those who do not have internet access still have a high demand for it, and reduction in the price of home-internet access would allow for an increase in equitable participation and improve internet adoption by marginalized groups.<ref>https://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/legacy-policy/digital_denied_free_press_report_december_2016.pdf</ref>\n\nDigital censorship and algorithmic bias are observed to be present in the racial divide. Hate-speech rules as well as hate speech algorithms online platforms such as Facebook have favored white males and those belonging to elite groups in society over marginalized groups in society, such as women and people of color. In a collection of internal documents that were collected in a project conducted by ProPublica, Facebook\u2019s guidelines in regards to distinguishing hate speech and recognizing protected groups revealed slides that identified three groups, each one containing either female drivers, black children, or white men. When the question of which subset group is protected is presented, the correct answer was white men . Minority group language is negatively impacted by automated tools of hate detection due to human bias that ultimately decides what is considered hate speech and what is not. \n\nOnline platforms have also been observed to tolerate hateful content towards people of color but restrict content from people of color. Aboriginal memes on a Facebook page were posted with racially abusive content and comments depicting Aboriginal people as inferior. While the contents on the page were removed by the originators after an investigation conducted by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, Facebook did not delete the page and has allowed it to remain under the classification of controversial humor . However, a post by an African American woman addressing her uncomfortableness of being the only person of color in a small-town restaurant was met with racist and hateful messages. When reporting the online abuse to Facebook, her account was suspended by Facebook for three days for posting the screenshots while those responsible for the racist comments she received were not suspended. Shared experiences between people of color can be at risk of being silenced under removal policies for online platforms.\n\n===Disability gap===\nInequities in [[access to information]] technologies are present among individuals living with a disability in comparison to those who are not living with a disability. According to The Pew IReseaerch Center, 54% of households with a person who has a disability have home internet access compared to 81% of households that have home internet access and do not have a person who has a disability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2011/01/21/americans-living-with-disability-and-their-technology-profile/|title=Americans living with disability and their technology profile|last=NW|first=1615 L.

However, there is still a lack of access to technology and home internet access among those who have a cognitive and auditory disability as well. There is a concern of whether or not the increase in the use of information technologies will increase equality through offering opportunities for individuals living with disabilities or whether it will only add to the present inequalities and lead to individuals living with disabilities being left behind in society. Issues such as the perception of disabilities in society, Federal and state government policy, corporate policy, mainstream computing technologies, and real-time online communication have been found to contribute to the impact of the digital divide on individuals with disabilities .\n\nPeople with disabilities are also the targets of online abuse. Online disability hate crimes have increased by 33% across the UK between 2016-17 and 2017-18 according to a report published by [[Leonard Cheshire Disability|Leonard Cheshire]], a health and welfare charity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/10/online-hate-against-disabled-people-rises-by-a-third|title=Online hate crime against disabled people rises by a third|date=2019-05-10|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> Accounts of online hate abuse towards people with disabilities were shared during an incident in 2019 when model Katie Price's son was the target of online abuse that was attributed to him having a disability. In response to the abuse, a campaign was launched by Katie Price to ensure that Britain's MP's held those who are guilty of perpetuating online abuse towards those with disabilities accountable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-42964068/katie-price-calls-on-mps-to-make-online-abuse-criminal-offence|title='He can\u2019t speak to defend himself, I can'|website=BBC News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> Online abuse towards individuals with disabilities is a factor that can discourage people from engaging online which could prevent people from learning information that could improve their lives. Many individuals living with disabilities face online abuse in the form of accusations of benefit fraud and \u201cfaking\u201d their disability for financial gain, which in some cases leads to unnecessary investigations.\n\n===Gender gap===\n''Main article: [[Gender digital divide]]''\n\nA paper published by J. Cooper from Princeton University points out that learning technology is designed to be receptive to men instead of women. The reasoning for this is that most software engineers and programmers are men, and they communicate their learning software in a way that would match the reception of their recipient. The association of computers in education is normally correlated with the male gender, and this has an impact on the education of computers and technology among women, although it is important to mention that there are plenty of learning softwares that are designed to help women and girls learn technology. Overall, the study presents the problem of various perspectives in society that are a result of gendered socialization patterns that believe that computers are a part of the male experience since computers have traditionally presented as a toy for boys when they are children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.pcw.gov.ph/sites/default/files/digital%20divide%20special%20case%20of%20gender.pdf</ref> This divide is followed as children grow older and young girls are not encouraged as much to pursue degrees in IT and computer science. In 1990, the percentage of women in computing jobs was 36%, however in 2016, this number had fallen to 25%. This can be seen in the underrepresentation of women in IT hubs such as Silicon Valley (.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/why-is-silicon-valley-so-awful-to-women/517788/</ref>\n\nThere has also been the presence of algorithmic bias that has been shown in machine learning algorithms that are implemented by major companies.{{clarify |date=March 2020 |reason=\"Major companies\", plural, is claimed, but only a single company is mentioned and referenced.}} In 2015, Amazon had to abandon a recruiting algorithm that showed a difference between ratings that candidates received for software developer jobs as well as other technical jobs. As a result, it was revealed that Amazon's machine algorithm was biased against women and favored male resumes over female resumes. This was due to the fact that Amazon's computer models were trained to vet patterns in resumes over a 10 year period. During this ten year period, the majority of the resumes belong to male individuals, which is a reflection of male dominance across the tech industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G</ref>\n\n===LGBTQIA gap===\nA number of states, including some that have introduced new laws since 2010, notably censor voices from and content related to the LGBTQI community, posing serious consequences to access to information about sexual orientation and gender identity. Digital platforms play a powerful role in limiting access to certain content, such as YouTube's 2017 decision to classify non-explicit videos with LGBTQIA themes as \u2018restricted\u2019, a classification designed to filter out \u2018potentially inappropriate content\u2019.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hunt|first=Elle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/20/lgbt-community-anger-over-youtube-restrictions-which-make-their-videos-invisible|title=LGBT community anger over YouTube restrictions which make their videos invisible|date=2017-03-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The internet provides information that can create a safe space for marginalized groups such as the LGBTQIA community to connect with others and engage in honest dialogues and conversations that are affecting their communities. It can also be viewed as an agent of change for the LGBTQIA community and provide a means of engaging in social justice. It can allow for LGBTQIA individuals who may be living in rural areas or in areas where they are isolated to gain access to information that are not within their rural system as well as gaining information from other LGBT individuals. This includes information such as healthcare, partners, and news. GayHealth provides online medical and health information and Gay and Lesbians Alliance Against Defamation contains online publications and news that focus on human rights campaigns and issues focused on LGBTQIA issues. The Internet also allows LGBTQIA individuals to maintain anonymity. Lack of access to the internet can hinder these things, due to lack of broadband access in remote rural areas. LGBT Tech has emphasized launching newer technologies with 5G technology in order to help close the digital divide that can cause members of the LGBTQIA community to lose access to reliable and fast technology that can provide information on healthcare, economic opportunities, and safe communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lgbttech.org/post/the-potential-of-5g-to-reduce-the-digital-divide|title=The potential of 5G to reduce the digital divide|last=Director &amp;amp;amp;|first=Carlos Gutierrez-Deputy|date=2020-01-27|website=lgbttech|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n===Age gap===\n\nOlder adults, those ages 60 and up, face various barriers that contribute to their lack of access to information and communication technologies (ICTs).

The Facebook Divide, Facebook native, Facebook immigrants, and Facebook left-behind are concepts for social and business management research. Facebook Immigrants are utilizing Facebook for their accumulation of both bonding and bridging social capital.

In February 2018, the Facebook Divide Index was introduced at the ICMAPRANE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaipuria.ac.in/icmaprane2018/icmaprane-2018/ |title=ICMAPRANE 2018 |work=Jaipuria.ac.in |date=June 20, 2014 |accessdate=2018-10-26}}</ref> conference in Noida, India, to illustrate the Facebook Divide phenomenon.\n\n==Overcoming the divide==\n\nAn individual must be able to connect in order to achieve enhancement of social and [[cultural capital]] as well as achieve mass economic gains in productivity.{{Cn|date=August 2019}}  Therefore, access is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for overcoming the digital divide. Access to ICT meets significant challenges that stem from income restrictions. The borderline between ICT as a [[necessity good]] and ICT as a [[luxury good]] is roughly around the \"magical number\" of US$10 per person per month, or US$120 per year,<ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\">{{Cite journal| last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin| title = When is Cheap, Cheap Enough to Bridge the Digital Divide?

Since more than 40% of the world population lives on less than US$2 per day, and around 20% live on less than US$1 per day (or less than US$365 per year), these income segments would have to spend one third of their income on ICT (120/365 = 33%). The global average of ICT spending is at a mere 3% of income.<ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\"/> Potential solutions include driving down the costs of ICT, which includes low-cost technologies and shared access through [[Telecentre]]s.\n\nFurthermore, even though individuals might be capable of accessing the Internet, many are thwarted by barriers to entry, such as a lack of means to infrastructure or the inability to comprehend the information that the Internet provides. Lack of adequate infrastructure and lack of knowledge are two major obstacles that impede mass connectivity. These barriers limit individuals' capabilities in what they can do and what they can achieve in accessing technology. Some individuals can connect, but they do not have the knowledge to use what information ICTs and Internet technologies provide them. This leads to a focus on capabilities and skills, as well as awareness to move from mere access to effective usage of ICT.<ref name=\":2\">Karen Mossberger (2003).

It constitutes an example of a volunteering initiative that effectively contributes to bridge the digital divide. ICT-enabled volunteering has a clear added value for development. If more people collaborate online with more development institutions and initiatives, this will imply an increase in person-hours dedicated to development cooperation at essentially no additional cost. This is the most visible effect of online volunteering for human development.<ref>Acevedo, Manuel. 2005.

The former describes phenomena such as the divided users' demographics that make up sites such as Facebook and Myspace or Word Press and Tumblr. Each of these sites hosts thriving communities that engage with otherwise [[marginalized]] populations. An example of this is the large online community devoted to Afrofuturism, a discourse that critiques dominant structures of power by merging themes of science fiction and blackness. Social media brings together minds that may not otherwise meet, allowing for the free exchange of ideas and empowerment of marginalized discourses.\n\n=== Libraries ===\n[[File:13394-Laptops Anytime Launch-6629 (10844113484).jpg|thumb|A laptop lending kiosk at [[Texas A&M University\u2013Commerce]]'s Gee Library]]\n\nAttempts to bridge the digital divide include a program developed in Durban, South Africa, where deficient access to technology and a lack of documented cultural heritage has motivated the creation of an \"online indigenous digital library as part of public library services.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Greyling | first1 = E. | last2 = Zulu | first2 = S. | year = 2010 | title = Content development in an indigenous digital library: A case study in community participation | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b4190d9002582db2c23292cf7828d9ca3d273016| journal = IFLA Journal | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 30\u20139 | doi = 10.1177/0340035209359570 }}</ref> This project has the potential to narrow the digital divide by not only giving the people of the Durban area access to this digital resource, but also by incorporating the community members into the process of creating it.\n\nTo address the divide [[The Gates Foundation]] started the Gates Library Initiative which provides training  assistance and guidance in libraries.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | last1 = Blau | first1 = A | year = 2002 | title = Access isn't enough: Merely connecting people and computers won't close the digital divide | url = | journal = American Libraries | volume = 33 | issue = 6| pages = 50\u201352 }}</ref>\n\nIn nations where poverty compounds effects of the digital divide, programs are emerging to counter those trends.  In Kenya, lack of funding, language, and technology illiteracy contributed to an overall lack of computer skills and educational advancement. This slowly began to change when foreign investment began.{{cn|date=August 2019}} In the early 2000s, the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] funded a revitalization project through the [[Kenya National Library Service]].  Those resources enabled public libraries to provide information and communication technologies to their patrons.  In 2012, public libraries in the [[Busia County|Busia]] and [[Kiberia]] communities introduced technology resources to supplement curriculum for primary schools.

[[Social capital]] is acquired through repeated interactions with other individuals or groups of individuals. Connecting to the Internet creates another set of means by which to achieve repeated interactions. ICTs and Internet connectivity enable repeated interactions through access to social networks, chat rooms, and gaming sites.

[[Web 2.0]] technologies like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Blogs enable users to participate online and create content without having to understand how the technology actually works, leading to an ever-increasing digital divide between those who have the skills and understanding to interact more fully with the technology and those who are passive consumers of it.<ref name=\"Reilley\" /> Many are only nominal content creators through the use of Web 2.0, posting photos and status updates on Facebook, but not truly interacting with the technology.\n\nSome of the reasons for this production gap include material factors like the type of Internet connection one has and the frequency of access to the Internet. The more frequently a person has access to the Internet and the faster the connection, the more opportunities they have to gain the technology skills and the more time they have to be creative.<ref name=\"Schradie\">{{cite journal | last1 = Schradie | first1 = Jen | year = 2011 | title = The Digital Production Gap: The Digital Divide and Web 2.0 Collide | url = http://sociology.berkeley.edu/documents/newspage_docs/J.%20Schradie%20-%20The%20Digital%20Production%20Gap%20for%20Web%20Post%20Poetics.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120227005023/http://sociology.berkeley.edu/documents/newspage_docs/J.%20Schradie%20-%20The%20Digital%20Production%20Gap%20for%20Web%20Post%20Poetics.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2012-02-27 | journal = Poetics | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 145\u2013168 | doi = 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.003 }}</ref>\n\nOther reasons include cultural factors often associated with class and socioeconomic status.

The term \"digital divide\" does not necessarily mean that someone does not have technology; it could mean that there is simply a difference in technology.  These differences can refer to, for example, high-quality computers, fast Internet, technical assistance, or telephone services. The difference between all of these is also considered a gap.\n\nThere is a large inequality worldwide in terms of the distribution of installed telecommunication bandwidth. In 2014 only three countries (China, US, Japan) host 50% of the globally installed bandwidth potential (see pie-chart Figure on the right).<ref name=\"HilbertBitsDivide\"/> This concentration is not new, as historically only ten countries have hosted 70\u201375% of the global telecommunication capacity (see Figure). The U.S. lost its global leadership in terms of installed bandwidth in 2011, being replaced by China, which hosts more than twice as much national bandwidth potential in 2014 (29% versus 13% of the global total).<ref name=\"HilbertBitsDivide\"/>\n\n===Versus the digital divide===\nThe global digital divide is a special case of the digital divide; the focus is set on the fact that \"Internet has developed unevenly throughout the world\"<ref name=Guillen-2005/>{{rp|681}} causing some countries to fall behind in technology, education, labor, democracy, and tourism.  The concept of the digital divide was originally popularized regarding the disparity in Internet access between rural and urban areas of the United States of America; the ''global'' digital divide mirrors this disparity on an international scale.\n\nThe global digital divide also contributes to the inequality of access to goods and services available through technology.  Computers and the Internet provide users with improved education, which can lead to higher wages; the people living in nations with limited access are therefore disadvantaged.<ref>Krueger 1993; Attewell and Battle 1999.</ref> This global divide is often characterized as falling along what is sometimes called the [[North\u2013South divide]] of \"northern\" wealthier nations and \"southern\" poorer ones.\n\n===Obstacles to a solution===\nSome people argue that necessities need to be considered before achieving digital inclusion, such as an ample food supply and quality health care.  Minimizing the global digital divide requires considering and addressing the following types of access:\n\n====Physical access====\nInvolves \"the distribution of ICT devices per capita\u2026and land lines per thousands\".<ref name=Wilson-2004/>{{rp|306}}  Individuals need to obtain access to computers, landlines, and networks in order to access the Internet. This access barrier is also addressed in Article 21 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by the United Nations.\n\n====Financial access====\nThe cost of ICT devices, traffic, applications, technician and educator training, software, maintenance, and infrastructures require ongoing financial means.<ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\" />\nFinancial access and \"the levels of household income play a significant role in widening the gap\" <ref>\u201cDigital Divide.\u201d The Digital Divide, Stanford University, cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/digital-divide/start.html. Retrieved September 19, 2017.</ref>\n\n====Socio-demographic access====\nEmpirical tests have identified that several socio-demographic characteristics foster or limit ICT access and usage. Among different countries, educational levels and income are the most powerful explanatory variables, with age being a third one.<ref name=\"HilbertDigDiv2011\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin| title = The end justifies the definition: The manifold outlooks on the digital divide and their practical usefulness for policy-making | doi = 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.06.012 | journal = Telecommunications Policy | volume = 35 | issue = 8 | pages = 715\u2013736| year = 2011 | url = http://martinhilbert.net/ManifoldDigitalDivide_Hilbert_AAM.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\"/>\n\nWhile a Global Gender Gap in access and usage of ICT's exist, empirical evidence shows that this is due to unfavorable conditions concerning employment, education and income and not to technophobia or lower ability.

Further challenges include information overload and the ability to find and use reliable information.\n\n====Design access====\nComputers need to be accessible to individuals with different learning and physical abilities including complying with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 in the United States.<ref>[http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=Laws Section 508] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806075749/http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=Laws |date=August 6, 2013 }} (1998). United States Government.</ref>\n\n====Institutional access====\nIn illustrating institutional access, Wilson states \"the numbers of users are greatly affected by whether access is offered only through individual homes or whether it is offered through schools, community centers, religious institutions, cybercaf\u00e9s, or post offices, especially in poor countries where computer access at work or home is highly limited\".<ref name=Wilson-2004/>{{rp|303}}\n\n====Political access====\nGuillen & Suarez argue that \"democratic political regimes enable faster growth of the Internet than authoritarian or totalitarian regimes.\" <ref name=Guillen-2005/>{{rp|687}}  The Internet is considered a form of e-democracy, and attempting to control what citizens can or cannot view is in contradiction to this.

In another example, many work-related tasks are online, and people without access to the Internet may not be able to complete work up to company standards. The Internet is regarded by some as a basic component of civic life that developed countries ought to guarantee for their citizens. Additionally, welfare services, for example, are sometimes offered via the Internet.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n*Social mobility \u2013 Computer and Internet use is regarded as being very important to development and success. However, some children are not getting as much technical education as others, because lower socioeconomic areas cannot afford to provide schools with computer facilities. For this reason, some kids are being separated and not receiving the same chance as others to be successful.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n*Democracy \u2013 Some people believe that eliminating the digital divide would help countries become healthier democracies. They argue that communities would become much more involved in events such as elections or decision making.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00418|title=Inclusion of excluded groups in decision-making in the development of technologies|last=Social Impact Open Repository|date=2011|website=SIOR|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905142527/http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00418|archive-date=September 5, 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=September 5, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n*Economic growth \u2013 It is believed that less-developed nations could gain quick access to economic growth if the information infrastructure were to be developed and well used. By improving the latest technologies, certain countries and industries can gain a competitive advantage.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n\nWhile these four arguments are meant to lead to a solution to the digital divide, there are a couple of other components that need to be considered. The first one is rural living versus suburban living. Rural areas used to have very minimal access to the Internet, for example. However, nowadays, power lines and satellites are used to increase the availability in these areas. Another component to keep in mind is disabilities. Some people may have the highest quality technologies, but a disability they have may keep them from using these technologies to their fullest extent.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n\nUsing previous studies (Gamos, 2003; Nsengiyuma & Stork, 2005; Harwit, 2004 as cited in James), James asserts that in developing countries, \"internet use has taken place overwhelmingly among the upper-income, educated, and urban segments\" largely due to the high literacy rates of this sector of the population.<ref name=James-2008>{{cite journal | last1 = James | first1 = J | year = 2008 | title = Digital Divide Complacency: Misconceptions and Dangers | journal = The Information Society | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 54\u201361 | doi = 10.1080/01972240701774790 }}</ref>{{rp|58}} As such, James suggests that part of the solution requires that developing countries first build up the literacy/language skills, [[computer literacy]], and technical competence that low-income and rural populations need in order to make use of ICT.\n\nIt has also been suggested that there is a correlation between democrat regimes and the growth of the Internet. One hypothesis by Gullen is, \"The more democratic the polity, the greater the Internet use...The government can try to control the Internet by monopolizing control\" and Norris ''et al.'' also contends, \"If there is less government control of it, the Internet flourishes, and it is associated with greater democracy and civil liberties.<ref name=PickAndAzari-2008>{{cite journal | last1 = Pick | first1 = J. | last2 = Azari | first2 = R. | year = 2008 | title = Global Digital Divide: Influence of Socioeconomic, Governmental, and Accessibility Factors on Information Technology | url = | journal = Information Technology for Development | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 91\u2013115 | doi=10.1002/itdj.20095}}</ref>\n\nFrom an economic perspective, Pick and Azari state that \"in developing nations\u2026foreign direct investment (FDI), primary education, educational investment, access to education, and government prioritization of ICT as all-important\".<ref name=PickAndAzari-2008/>{{rp|112}} Specific solutions proposed by the study include: \"invest in stimulating, attracting, and growing creative technical and scientific workforce; increase the access to education and digital literacy; reduce the gender divide and empower women to participate in the ICT workforce; emphasize investing in intensive Research and Development for selected metropolitan areas and regions within nations\".<ref name=PickAndAzari-2008/>{{rp|111}}\n\nThere are projects worldwide that have implemented, to various degrees, the solutions outlined above.  Many such projects have taken the form of Information Communications Technology Centers (ICT centers).  Rahnman explains that \"the main role of ICT intermediaries is defined as an organization providing effective support to local communities in the use and adaptation of technology.  Most commonly, an ICT intermediary will be a specialized organization from outside the community, such as a non-governmental organization, local government, or international donor. On the other hand, a social intermediary is defined as a local institution from within the community, such as a community-based organization.<ref>Rahman, H. (2006). ''Empowering Marginal Communities and Information Networking''. Hershey, Pennsylvania: Idea Group Publishing.</ref>{{rp|128}}\n\nOther proposed solutions that the Internet promises for developing countries are the provision of efficient communications within and among developing countries so that citizens worldwide can effectively help each other to solve their problems. Grameen Banks and Kiva loans are two microcredit systems designed to help citizens worldwide to contribute online towards entrepreneurship in developing communities. Economic opportunities range from entrepreneurs who can afford the hardware and broadband access required to maintain Internet caf\u00e9s to agribusinesses having control over the seeds they plant.\n\nAt the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the IMARA organization (from [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word for \"power\") sponsors a variety of outreach programs which bridge the Global Digital Divide. Its aim is to find and implement long-term, sustainable solutions which will increase the availability of educational technology and resources to domestic and international communities. These projects are run under the aegis of the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] (CSAIL) and staffed by MIT volunteers who give training, install and donate computer setups in greater [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Kenya]], Indian reservations the American Southwest such as the [[Navajo Nation]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]]. The CommuniTech project strives to empower underserved communities through sustainable technology and education.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Fizz|first1=Robyn|last2=Mansur|first2=Karla|title=Helping MIT neighbors cross the 'digital divide'|newspaper=MIT Tech Talk|date=June 4, 2008|publisher=Cambridge: MIT|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2008/techtalk52-28.pdf|page=3}}</ref><ref>[http://imara.csail.mit.edu/ IMARA Project at MIT]</ref><ref>Fizz, Robyn, [http://ist.mit.edu/news/communitech \"CommuniTech Works Locally to Bridge the Digital Divide\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818173543/http://ist.mit.edu/news/communitech |date=August 18, 2011 }}, ''IST News'', MIT, April 8, 2011</ref> According to Dominik Hartmann of the MIT's Media Lab, interdisciplinary approaches are needed to bridge the global digital divide.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Hartmann|first1=Dominik|title=Building bridges|newspaper=D+C, development&cooperation|date=March 25, 2016|url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/innovative-interdisciplinary-approaches-needed-tackle-digital-divide-and-growing-inequality}}</ref>\n\nBuilding on the premise that any effective solution must be decentralized, allowing the local communities in developing nations to generate their content, one scholar has posited that social media\u2014like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter\u2014may be useful tools in closing the divide.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ali | first1 = Amir | year = 2011 | title = The Power of Social Media in Developing Nations: New Tools for Closing the Global Digital Divide and Beyond | url = http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/185-220.pdf | journal = Harvard Human Rights Journal | volume = 24 | issue =  | page = 1 | access-date = March 30, 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121114083745/http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/185-220.pdf | archive-date = November 14, 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref> As Amir Hatem Ali suggests, \"the popularity and generative nature of social media empower individuals to combat some of the main obstacles to bridging the digital divide\".<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/>{{rp|188}} Facebook\u2019s statistics reinforce this claim. According to Facebook, more than seventy-five percent of its users reside outside of the US.<ref name=FacebookStats-2011>[http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics \"Facebook Statistics\"], 2011. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018164409/http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics |date=October 18, 2007 }}</ref> Moreover, more than seventy languages are presented on its website.<ref name=FacebookStats-2011/> The reasons for the high number of international users are due to many the qualities of Facebook and other social media. Amongst them, are its ability to offer a means of interacting with others, user-friendly features, and the fact that most sites are available at no cost.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/> The problem with social media, however, is that it can be accessible, provided that there is physical access.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/> Nevertheless, with its ability to encourage digital inclusion, social media can be used as a tool to bridge the global digital divide.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/>\n\nSome cities in the world have started programs to bridge the digital divide for their residents, school children, students, parents and the elderly. One such program, founded in 1996, was sponsored by the city of Boston and called the Boston Digital Bridge Foundation.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20021008225433/http://www.digitalbridgefoundation.org/ (Boston) Digital Bridge Foundation]</ref> It especially concentrates on school children and their parents, helping to make both equally and similarly knowledgeable about computers, using application programs, and navigating the Internet.<ref>[http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/Default.aspx?id=1479 \"Mayor Menino, Boston Digital Bridge Foundation Host Evening on the Bridge 2.0 Celebration\"], Mayor's Office, Boston, Press Release, September 26, 2002</ref><ref>[http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/default.aspx?id=4765 \"City of Boston Receives $4.3 Million Grant That Will Give Training, Computers and Opportunity to Underserved Communities\"], City of Boston press office, September 14, 2010</ref>\n\n===Free Basics===\n{{Main|Free Basics}}\n\nFree Basics is a partnership between social networking services company Facebook and six companies (Samsung, Ericsson, MediaTek, Opera Software, Nokia and Qualcomm) that plans to bring affordable access to selected Internet services to less developed countries by increasing efficiency, and facilitating the development of new business models around the provision of Internet access. In the whitepaper<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scontent-cdg2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/12057105_1001874746531417_622371037_n.pdf?oh=4a6afa24c125a3debe1784bcacefa8b4&oe=5B03C427|title=Is connectivity a human right?|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> realised by Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, connectivity is asserted as a \"human right\", and Internet.org is created to improve Internet access for people around the world.\n\n\"Free Basics provides people with access to useful services on their mobile phones in markets where internet access may be less affordable. The websites are available for free without data charges, and include content about news, employment, health, education and local information etc. By introducing people to the benefits of the internet through these websites, we hope to bring more people online and help improve their lives.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://info.internet.org/en/|title=Internet.org:About|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Free Basics is also accused of violating [[net neutrality]] for limiting access to handpicked services. Despite a wide deployment in numerous countries, it has been met with heavy resistance notably in India where the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India eventually banned it in 2016.\n\n===Satellite constellations===\n\nSeveral projects to bring internet to the entire world with a [[satellite constellation]] have been devised in the last decade, one of these being [[Starlink (satellite constellation)|Starlink]] by [[Elon Musk]]'s company [[SpaceX]]. Unlike Free Basics, it would provide people with a full internet access and would not be limited to a few selected services. In the same week Starlink was announced, serial-entrepreneur Richard Branson announced his own project [[OneWeb satellite constellation|OneWeb]], a similar constellation with approximately 700 satellites that has already procured communication frequency licenses for their broadcast spectrum and could possibly be operational as early as in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-satellite-entrepreneurs-20150117-story.html|title=Elon Musk and Richard Branson invest in satellite-Internet ventures|last=|first=|date=January 17, 2015|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe biggest hurdle to these projects is the astronomical, financial, and logistical cost of launching so many satellites. After the failure of previous satellite-to-consumer space ventures, satellite industry consultant Roger Rusch said \"It's highly unlikely that you can make a successful business out of this.\" Musk has publicly acknowledged this business reality, and indicated in mid-2015 that while endeavoring to develop this technically-complicated space-based communication system he wants to avoid overextending the company and stated that they are being measured in the pace of development.\n\n===One Laptop per Child===\n\n[[One Laptop per Child]] (OLPC) is another attempt to narrow the digital divide.<ref name=\"wiki.laptop.org\">[http://one.laptop.org/about/mission One Laptop Per Child]. (2009).</ref> This organization, founded in 2005, provides inexpensively produced \"XO\" laptops (dubbed the \"$100 laptop\", though actual production costs vary) to children residing in poor and isolated regions within developing countries. Each laptop belongs to an individual child and provides a gateway to digital learning and Internet access. The XO laptops are designed to withstand more abuse than higher-end machines, and they contain features in context to the unique conditions that remote villages present. Each laptop is constructed to use as little power as possible, have a sunlight-readable screen, and is capable of automatically networking with other XO laptops in order to access the Internet\u2014as many as 500 machines can share a single point of access.<ref name=\"wiki.laptop.org\"/>\n\n==World Summit on the Information Society==\n{{Main |World Summit on the Information Society}}\n\nSeveral of the 67 principles adopted at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] convened by the [[United Nations]] in Geneva in 2003 directly address the digital divide:<ref name=WSIS-03>[http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs/geneva/official/dop.html \"Declaration of Principles\"], WSIS-03/GENEVA/DOC/4-E, World Summit on the Information Society, Geneva, December 12, 2003</ref>\n:10. We are also fully aware that the benefits of the information technology revolution are today unevenly distributed between the developed and developing countries and within societies. We are fully committed to turning this digital divide into a digital opportunity for all, particularly for those who risk being left behind and being further marginalized.\n:11. We are committed to realizing our common vision of the Information Society for ourselves and for future generations. We recognize that young people are the future workforce and leading creators and earliest adopters of ICTs. They must therefore be empowered as learners, developers, contributors, entrepreneurs and decision-makers. We must focus especially on young people who have not yet been able to benefit fully from the opportunities provided by ICTs. We are also committed to ensuring that the development of ICT applications and operation of services respects the rights of children as well as their protection and well-being.\n:12. We affirm that development of ICTs provides enormous opportunities for women, who should be an integral part of, and key actors, in the Information Society. We are committed to ensuring that the Information Society enables women's empowerment and their full participation on the basis on equality in all spheres of society and in all decision-making processes. To this end, we should mainstream a gender equality perspective and use ICTs as a tool to that end.\n:13. In building the Information Society, we shall pay particular attention to the special needs of marginalized and vulnerable groups of society, including migrants, internally displaced persons and refugees, unemployed and underprivileged people, minorities and nomadic people. We shall also recognize the special needs of older persons and persons with disabilities.\n:14. We are resolute to empower the poor, particularly those living in remote, rural and marginalized urban areas, to access information and to use ICTs as a tool to support their efforts to lift themselves out of poverty.\n:15. In the evolution of the Information Society, particular attention must be given to the special situation of indigenous peoples, as well as to the preservation of their heritage and their cultural legacy.\n:16. We continue to pay special attention to the particular needs of people of developing countries, countries with economies in transition, Least Developed Countries, Small Island Developing States, Landlocked Developing Countries, Highly Indebted Poor Countries, countries and territories under occupation, countries recovering from conflict and countries and regions with special needs as well as to conditions that pose severe threats to development, such as natural disasters.\n:21. Connectivity is a central enabling agent in building the Information Society. Universal, ubiquitous, equitable and affordable access to ICT infrastructure and services, constitutes one of the challenges of the Information Society and should be an objective of all stakeholders involved in building it. Connectivity also involves access to energy and postal services, which should be assured in conformity with the domestic legislation of each country.\n:28. We strive to promote universal access with equal opportunities for all to scientific knowledge and the creation and dissemination of scientific and technical information, including open access initiatives for scientific publishing.\n:46. In building the Information Society, States are strongly urged to take steps with a view to the avoidance of, and refrain from, any unilateral measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that impedes the full achievement of economic and social development by the population of the affected countries, and that hinders the well-being of their population.\n\n==See also==\n{{Library resources box}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Achievement gap]]\n* [[Participation (decision making)#Civic opportunity gap|Civic opportunity gap]]\n* [[Computer technology for developing areas]]\n* [[Digital divide by country]]\n* [[Digital divide in Canada]]\n* [[Digital divide in China]]\n* [[Digital divide in South Africa]]\n* [[Digital divide in Thailand]]\n* [[Digital divide in the United States]]\n* [[Digital rights]]\n* [[Digital Society Day]] (October 17 in India)\n* [[Gender digital divide]]\n* [[Global Internet usage]]\n* [[Information society]]\n* [[International communication]]\n* [[Internet Geography|Internet geography]]\n* [[Internet governance]]\n* [[List of countries by Internet connection speeds]]\n* [[National broadband plans from around the world]]\n* [[NetDay]]\n* [[One Laptop per Child]]\n* [[Rural Internet]]\n* [[World Summit on the Information Society]]\n\n;Groups devoted to digital divide issues:\n* [[Center for Digital Inclusion]]\n* [[Digital Textbook]] a [[South Korea]]n Project that intends to distribute tablet notebooks to elementary school students.\n* [[Inveneo]]\n* [[TechChange]]\n* [[United Nations Information and Communication Technologies Task Force]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = I'd blush if I could: closing gender divides in digital skills through education\n| author = UNESCO, EQUALS Skills Coalition\n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = UNESCO\n| documentURL = https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000367416\n| license statement URL = \n| license = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist |30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Azam, M.

At the age of fourteen, she finished formal education and worked in a garment factory making uniforms for the military. She married Douglas in 1948. Bobbi was the first of four children. The family lived in Chatham until 1956 and then moved to [[Ridgetown]], a small town in southwestern Ontario farm country. Young Bobbi was an excellent student who excelled at all sports, delivered newspapers, studied butterflies, served mass as a Catholic altar boy and learned to play the piano.

She successfully represented the club in interclub and Somerville Matches. Upon moving to Phoenix, she competed on the Western States Tour in 1997 and won a professional event at Palm Valley Golf Course. After moving to Gold Canyon, she became Senior Club Champion at Superstition Mountain Golf Club in 2008. After Lancaster's transition in 2012 and her unexpected unemployment and free time, she took up golf with renewed enthusiasm. She received permission from the [[USGA]] to compete as a female and promptly won the Papago Club Championship against some of the best players in Arizona. After several more victories, there were complaints that her prior status as a male gave her an unfair advantage around strength and distance. Bobbi basically handicapped herself and became a professional golfer in 2013. She competed on the Cactus Tour against elite players forty years younger. She enjoyed modest success and was instrumental in changing the Cactus Tour's female-at-birth gender policy. Bobbi then attempted to qualify for the LPGA Tour, under their new transgender policy, and competed in the [[LPGA Qualifying Tournament]] in 2013.

At the age of fourteen, she finished formal education and worked in a garment factory making uniforms for the military. She married Douglas in 1948. Bobbi was the first of four children. The family lived in Chatham until 1956 and then moved to [[Ridgetown]], a small town in southwestern Ontario farm country. Young Bobbi was an excellent student who excelled at all sports, delivered newspapers, studied butterflies, served mass as a Catholic altar boy and learned to play the piano. She was introduced to golf by her father, an excellent player, who was on the Board of Ridgetown Golf and Curling Club.<ref name=\"Boivin, MAR 2013\"/><ref name=\"Boivin, DEC 2013\"/> The Lancasters moved to [[Hamilton, Ontario]] in 1960 where Bobbi continued piano studies with the [[Royal Conservatory of Music]] and caddied.<ref name=\"Boivin, DEC 2013\"/> She became caddy champion at Hamilton Golf and C.C. at fourteen years of age and attended Cathedral Boys High School where she was taught by [[Jesuit priests]]. Bobbi dreamed of being a professional golfer, a biologist, a pianist or perhaps a priest.\n\n==Struggles==\nLancaster liked to [[Cross-dressing|cross-dress]] by wearing her cousin's dresses when they were not around<ref name=\"Boivin, DEC 2013\"/> and felt like a girl from the age of four or five. She hid these feelings from others because she knew she was different and had observed how badly others around her were treated because they were different. Her father was an abusive alcoholic who never knew of her struggles.<ref name=\"Boivin, DEC 2013\"/> At fourteen, Lancaster finally told a trusted parish priest about her desire to be a girl. She was told her thoughts and her cross-dressing were sinful. This news cemented Bobbi's decision to hide and she remained \"closeted\" until sixty years of age. She lived with a constant yearning to just live as the woman she knew herself to be. This led to depression and a near suicide in her fifties and ultimately culminated in the transition to life as Bobbi.<ref name=age62/>\n\n==Medical career==\nShe was an [[Ontario Scholar]] and received an academic scholarship to [[McMaster University]] in Hamilton, Ontario where she studied honors Biology (1969-1972).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} She received an Honor M for academic excellence and captained the men's varsity golf team to two [[OUAA]] Championships (1972 and 1974) She was accepted to [[McMaster University Medical School|McMaster Medical School]] in 1972 and ultimately was awarded an M.D. degree in 1978.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://fhs.mcmaster.ca/main/news/news_2017/trans_alumna_speaks_to_med_students.html |title=Transgender alumna speaks to med students |publisher=McMaster University \u2013 Faculty of Health Sciences |access-date=2018-03-14}}</ref> She completed her family medicine residency in 1980<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://issuu.com/macuniversity/docs/times_spring_2017 |title=The Butterfly Effect |magazine=McMaster Times |date=April 23, 2017 |pages=14\u201315 |via=Issuu |access-date=2018-03-14}}</ref> during which time she was elected Chief Resident.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Lancaster passed her board certification and practiced in Hamilton until 1991.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} She provided obstetrical care, looked after children, assisted in surgery, attended hospitalized patients, made house calls and provided medical care for all age groups.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} She served as an assistant clinical professor from 1981-1991 where she taught medical students and residents.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Lancaster was nominated as Canadian Family Practice Teacher of the Year in 1986.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} She served on many hospital committees and volunteered in the community.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Most notably she served as a Board of Director for the Hamilton Catholic Children's Aid Society and became president in 1984.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn 1991, Lancaster moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona]] where she became American Board Certified, established a family practice and continued to teach interns and residents at St. Joseph's Hospital.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} She took a leave of absence from practice in 2001 because she was struggling with depression and gender identity difficulties.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} During that time she volunteered at the [[Phoenix Art Museum]], [[Phoenix Zoo]] and [[Boyce Thompson Arboretum State Park|Boyce Thompson Arboretum]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Lancaster resumed her medical career and ultimately became medical director of Advanced Healthcare of Mesa and Scottsdale (medical-surgical rehabilitation facilities). She also became a medical director with Hospice of the Valley.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nShe ultimately lost these positions during her gender transition in 2012.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Lancaster then provided medical supervision of modified [[barium swallow]] studies (2012-2016) while she maintained her small concierge family practice in [[Gold Canyon, Arizona]] (2001 to present).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} She is a revered clinician and patients back in Hamilton, Ontario still wish she would return to care for them.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Golf career==\nShe graduated from Cathedral Boys High School in 1969 as one of the top students. She had captained the varsity golf team and had participated on the track and field team. She high jumped six feet in a city meet. Bobbi also participated in soccer, hockey and the chess club.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nLancaster excelled at golf from a young age, winning the prestigious [[Caddie|caddy]] championship at Hamilton Golf and C.C. in her early teens. At 11, she won a caddie tournament at the club, beating peers who were in their late teens.<ref name=\"Boivin, DEC 2013\"/> She also qualified for the Ontario Caddy Championship. During high school she captained the Cathedral Boys varsity team to multiple victories. She also won junior tournaments, interclub matches representing Chedoke Civic Golf Course and was victorious as a member of the [[CANUSA Games]] golf team. In her late teens and twenties, Bobbi won multiple club championships at Chedoke. She also qualified and competed in several Canadian and Ontario Amateur Championships as well as the Ontario Open, a professional event. Bobbi also captained the McMaster University Men's Varsity Golf Team<ref name=\"Boivin, DEC 2013\"/> to two OUAA Championships (1972 and 1974).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nWhen she began her medical career in 1980, Lancaster joined Hamilton Golf and C.C. where she quickly became club champion and three-time Sclater Bowl champion. She successfully represented the club in interclub and Somerville Matches. Upon moving to Phoenix, she competed on the Western States Tour in 1997 and won a professional event at Palm Valley Golf Course. After moving to Gold Canyon, she became Senior Club Champion at Superstition Mountain Golf Club in 2008. After Lancaster's transition in 2012 and her unexpected unemployment and free time, she took up golf with renewed enthusiasm. She received permission from the [[USGA]] to compete as a female and promptly won the Papago Club Championship against some of the best players in Arizona. After several more victories, there were complaints that her prior status as a male gave her an unfair advantage around strength and distance. Bobbi basically handicapped herself and became a professional golfer in 2013. She competed on the Cactus Tour against elite players forty years younger. She enjoyed modest success and was instrumental in changing the Cactus Tour's female-at-birth gender policy. Bobbi then attempted to qualify for the LPGA Tour, under their new transgender policy, and competed in the [[LPGA Qualifying Tournament]] in 2013. She failed in her attempt but did gain conditional status on the [[Symetra Tour]]. Various life events curtailed her golf adventures (see Media and Advocacy below) and she regained her amateur status in 2016. Bobbi still competes occasionally and represented Papago Golf Course in interclub matches in 2017. She is also once again their club champion.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Media==\nWhen Lancaster became a professional golfer and attempted to qualify for the LPGA Tour at sixty three years of age, her story garnered international media attention.<ref name=\"Boivin, MAR 2013\"/> It started after Paola Boivin (senior sports columnist for the ''[[Arizona Republic]]'') received a complaint from a fan about how inappropriate it was to see her playing on the Cactus Tour.<ref name=\"Boivin, MAR 2013\"/> This resulted in a full-length feature about her golf dreams, her personal life and her work as a physician. The story was picked up nationally and Boivin was nominated for a [[Sports Emmy Award|Sports Emmy]]. Following that article, stories appeared in the Canadian newspapers, ''Huffington Post'', ''USA Today'', ''Good Morning America'', ''Canadian Medical Post''.<ref name=\"Boivin, MAR 2013\"/> Bobbi agreed to interviews with TMZ Sports, Channel 12 News, ''New Times'' weekly newspaper, ''McMaster Times Alumnae'' magazine, ''Echo'' magazine, Freedom for All Americans and The League of Fans. There was a documentary that appeared on national television produced by the [[Golf Channel]] (interview conducted by multiple Emmy Award-winner [[Jimmy Roberts]]). There were also documentaries exploring Bobbi's life by [[Cronkite News Service|Cronkite News]], ''Sports Illustrated'' (golf.com) and the [[Human Rights Campaign]] (Arizona).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Advocacy==\nAs a result of the media attention, Lancaster has become a minor celebrity. She has been asked to give educational and motivational speeches to various groups including students at the University of Kansas, Arizona State University, Chandler and Gilbert Community Colleges, Stanford School of Law and McMaster School of Medicine. She has also given speeches to Phoenix Valley Leadership, the Arizona Women Lawyers Convention in Tucson, the Performing Artists Medical Association International Symposium (NYC 2016). Dr. Bobbi's efforts promoting awareness of transgender issues caught the attention of the Human Rights Campaign. She was awarded their 2015 Equality Award at a gala in Phoenix in 2015 where her famous Humpty Dumpty acceptance speech can be found on YouTube. She was elected to their national Board of Directors in 2016. She has worked tirelessly on their behalf, lobbying on Capitol Hill and at the Arizona State Capitol. Bobbi has participated in a White House Summit, at town hall meetings and has canvassed and phone-banked for pro-LGBTQ candidates.

The commander cuts a deal with Moon: if he and his fellow mercenary would bomb the Niaruna village from the air and drive them away, they will be given enough gasoline for their airplane to be allowed to leave.\n\nBorn-again Christian evangelist (and [[missionary]]) Martin Quarrier and his wife Hazel arrive with their son Billy, here to spread the Christian gospel to the primitive Niaruna indigenous natives. They arrive in M\u00e3e de Deus to meet fellow missionaries Leslie and Andy Huben, who live with a Niaruna helper. In town, they meet a [[Catholic]] priest who wants to re-establish a mission to the Niarunas, as the former missionary was killed by them.\n\nMoon and Wolf leave in their plane to attack the Niaruna. But upon seeing the community with his own eyes as well as an Indian firing an arrow at the plane, Moon has second thoughts. The plane returns to M\u00e3e de Deus.\n\nThat night, after a discussion with Wolf, Quarrier and the priest, Moon takes an Indian drug and begins hallucinating. He takes off alone in his plane and parachutes into the Niaruna village. Moon, a half-[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Cheyenne]], aligns himself with the Niarunas. He is accepted as \"Kisu-Mu\", one of the Niaruna gods, and begins to adapt to Niaruna life and culture.\n\nThe four evangelists travel upriver to establish their mission. Indians originally converted by the Catholics turn up, awaiting the arrival of the Niaruna. Eventually they do come and accept the gifts that the Quarriers offer, not staying long.\n\nYoung Billy dies of [[blackwater fever]] (a serious complication of [[malaria]]), causing Hazel to lose her sanity. She is returned to M\u00e3e de Deus. Martin becomes despondent, arguing with Leslie and gradually losing his faith.\n\nMeanwhile, Moon encounters Andy swimming nude. After they kiss, Moon catches her cold. He returns to the Niaruna camp and inadvertently infects everyone there. Much of the tribe becomes sick. Moon and the tribe's leaders go to the missionary Leslie to beg for drugs.\n\nLeslie refuses, but Martin agrees to provide the drugs. He travels to the Niaruna village with the missionaries' young helper. In the village, after Martin speaks with Moon, helicopters arrive to begin bombing. Martin survives the bombing, but is killed by his helper soon thereafter. Moon is exposed not as a god but as a man. He runs, ending up alone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tom Berenger]] as Lewis Moon\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Leslie Huben\n* [[Daryl Hannah]] as Andy Huben\n* [[Aidan Quinn]] as Martin Quarrier\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Hazel Quarrier\n* [[Tom Waits]] as Wolf\n* [[St\u00eanio Garcia]] as Boronai\n* [[Nelson Xavier]] as Father Xantes\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Dumont]] as Commander Guzman\n* Niilo Kivirinta as Billy Quarrier\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Background==\nProducer [[Saul Zaentz]] first tried to make this film in 1965. He discovered that [[MGM]] owned the rights to [[Peter Matthiessen]]'s novel.  Zaentz continued to try to buy the property every time there was a top executive change at MGM until 1989, when the new studio heads Jay Kanter and [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]] decided that MGM would not make the film. Zaentz then paid $1.4 million for the rights.<ref>IMDb. Ibid.</ref>\n\nThe picture was filmed in [[Bel\u00e9m]], [[Par\u00e1]], [[Brazil]]. It was released to theaters in the U.S. on December 6, 1991. While the film has been released to [[VHS]] and [[Laserdisc]], the film was never released on [[DVD]] nor [[Blu-ray]] anywhere (except for a 2013 DVD release in [[Spain]]). This is due to a rights issue with [[Universal Pictures]] (the distributor of the film) and [[Warner Bros.]] (current distributors of the Saul Zaentz library).\n\n==Critical reception==\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 57% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on reviews from 7 critics.<ref name=\"tomatoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/at_play_in_the_fields_of_the_lord/reviews/|title=At Play in the Fields of the Lord|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|access-date=6 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nNoted ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' critic [[Roger Ebert]] had read the novel and believed the film is true to its themes. Ebert makes the case that producer [[Saul Zaentz]] has a history of producing \"unfilmable\" source material. He wrote, \"Watching it, we are looking at a morality play about a world in which sincere people create unwitting mischief so that evil people can have their way. The movie essentially argues that all peoples have a right to worship their own gods without interference, but it goes further to observe that if your god lives in the land and the trees, then if we destroy your land, we kill your god. These messages are buried in the very fabric of the film, in the way it was shot, in its use of locations, and we are not told them, we absorb them.\"<ref>[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/at-play-in-the-fields-of-the-lord-1991 Ebert, Roger]. ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', film review, December 6, 1991. Accessed: July 30, 2013.</ref>\n\n[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' had mixed feelings about the film but did like the acting and the screenplay, and wrote, \"''At Play in the Fields of the Lord'' doesn't play smoothly, but it often plays well ... Mr. Lithgow and Miss Hannah, who grows more secure as an actress with every film, are fine in complex roles that are exceptionally well written ... Though the film features a spectacular penultimate sequence, it seems not to know how to end. It sort of drifts away, perhaps trying to soften its own well-earned pessimism.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0CE2DB1F3FF935A35751C1A967958260 Canby, Vincent].

Accessed: July 30, 2013.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA pair of explorers, Lewis Moon and Wolf, become stranded in ''M\u00e3e de Deus'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Mother of God''), an outpost in the deep [[Brazil]]ian [[Amazon River|Amazon River basin]], after their plane runs out of fuel.\n\nThe local police commander wants the Niaruna tribe, living upriver, to move their village so they won't be killed by gold miners moving into the area and cause trouble for him with the provincial government. The commander cuts a deal with Moon: if he and his fellow mercenary would bomb the Niaruna village from the air and drive them away, they will be given enough gasoline for their airplane to be allowed to leave.\n\nBorn-again Christian evangelist (and [[missionary]]) Martin Quarrier and his wife Hazel arrive with their son Billy, here to spread the Christian gospel to the primitive Niaruna indigenous natives. They arrive in M\u00e3e de Deus to meet fellow missionaries Leslie and Andy Huben, who live with a Niaruna helper. In town, they meet a [[Catholic]] priest who wants to re-establish a mission to the Niarunas, as the former missionary was killed by them.\n\nMoon and Wolf leave in their plane to attack the Niaruna. But upon seeing the community with his own eyes as well as an Indian firing an arrow at the plane, Moon has second thoughts. The plane returns to M\u00e3e de Deus.\n\nThat night, after a discussion with Wolf, Quarrier and the priest, Moon takes an Indian drug and begins hallucinating. He takes off alone in his plane and parachutes into the Niaruna village. Moon, a half-[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Cheyenne]], aligns himself with the Niarunas. He is accepted as \"Kisu-Mu\", one of the Niaruna gods, and begins to adapt to Niaruna life and culture.\n\nThe four evangelists travel upriver to establish their mission. Indians originally converted by the Catholics turn up, awaiting the arrival of the Niaruna. Eventually they do come and accept the gifts that the Quarriers offer, not staying long.\n\nYoung Billy dies of [[blackwater fever]] (a serious complication of [[malaria]]), causing Hazel to lose her sanity. She is returned to M\u00e3e de Deus. Martin becomes despondent, arguing with Leslie and gradually losing his faith.\n\nMeanwhile, Moon encounters Andy swimming nude. After they kiss, Moon catches her cold. He returns to the Niaruna camp and inadvertently infects everyone there. Much of the tribe becomes sick. Moon and the tribe's leaders go to the missionary Leslie to beg for drugs.\n\nLeslie refuses, but Martin agrees to provide the drugs. He travels to the Niaruna village with the missionaries' young helper. In the village, after Martin speaks with Moon, helicopters arrive to begin bombing. Martin survives the bombing, but is killed by his helper soon thereafter. Moon is exposed not as a god but as a man. He runs, ending up alone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tom Berenger]] as Lewis Moon\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Leslie Huben\n* [[Daryl Hannah]] as Andy Huben\n* [[Aidan Quinn]] as Martin Quarrier\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Hazel Quarrier\n* [[Tom Waits]] as Wolf\n* [[St\u00eanio Garcia]] as Boronai\n* [[Nelson Xavier]] as Father Xantes\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Dumont]] as Commander Guzman\n* Niilo Kivirinta as Billy Quarrier\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Background==\nProducer [[Saul Zaentz]] first tried to make this film in 1965. He discovered that [[MGM]] owned the rights to [[Peter Matthiessen]]'s novel.  Zaentz continued to try to buy the property every time there was a top executive change at MGM until 1989, when the new studio heads Jay Kanter and [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]] decided that MGM would not make the film. Zaentz then paid $1.4 million for the rights.<ref>IMDb. Ibid.</ref>\n\nThe picture was filmed in [[Bel\u00e9m]], [[Par\u00e1]], [[Brazil]]. It was released to theaters in the U.S. on December 6, 1991. While the film has been released to [[VHS]] and [[Laserdisc]], the film was never released on [[DVD]] nor [[Blu-ray]] anywhere (except for a 2013 DVD release in [[Spain]]). This is due to a rights issue with [[Universal Pictures]] (the distributor of the film) and [[Warner Bros.]] (current distributors of the Saul Zaentz library).\n\n==Critical reception==\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 57% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on reviews from 7 critics.<ref name=\"tomatoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/at_play_in_the_fields_of_the_lord/reviews/|title=At Play in the Fields of the Lord|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|access-date=6 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nNoted ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' critic [[Roger Ebert]] had read the novel and believed the film is true to its themes. Ebert makes the case that producer [[Saul Zaentz]] has a history of producing \"unfilmable\" source material. He wrote, \"Watching it, we are looking at a morality play about a world in which sincere people create unwitting mischief so that evil people can have their way. The movie essentially argues that all peoples have a right to worship their own gods without interference, but it goes further to observe that if your god lives in the land and the trees, then if we destroy your land, we kill your god. These messages are buried in the very fabric of the film, in the way it was shot, in its use of locations, and we are not told them, we absorb them.\"<ref>[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/at-play-in-the-fields-of-the-lord-1991 Ebert, Roger].

Accessed: July 30, 2013.</ref>\n\n[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[New York Times]]'' had mixed feelings about the film but did like the acting and the screenplay, and wrote, \"''At Play in the Fields of the Lord'' doesn't play smoothly, but it often plays well ... Mr. Lithgow and Miss Hannah, who grows more secure as an actress with every film, are fine in complex roles that are exceptionally well written ... Though the film features a spectacular penultimate sequence, it seems not to know how to end. It sort of drifts away, perhaps trying to soften its own well-earned pessimism.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0CE2DB1F3FF935A35751C1A967958260 Canby, Vincent].
