The player assumes the role of a pirate who completes voyages from different trading companies to become the ultimate pirate legend. ''Sea of Thieves'' is a [[first-person perspective|first-person]] [[cooperative gameplay|multiplayer]] game in which a group of players [[cooperative gameplay|cooperates]] with each other to explore an [[open world]] via a pirate ship. The game is described as a \"shared world adventure game\", which means groups of players will encounter each other regularly during their adventures.\n\nMost of Rare's employees worked on the title and the game was first conceptualized in 2014. The game was inspired by players of [[personal computer|PC]] games such as ''[[Eve Online]]'', ''[[DayZ (video game)|DayZ]]'' and ''[[Rust (video game)|Rust]]'', who used the tools provided by these games to create their own personal stories. The company explored different settings for the game, such as vampires and dinosaurs, though it eventually settled on the pirate theme, drawing inspirations from films including ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' and ''[[The Goonies]]''. The game features a progression system that only unlocks cosmetic items as the development team wanted to encourage both casual and experienced players to play together. Compared to Rare's other games, ''Sea of Thieves''{{'s}} development process was more transparent, with Rare inviting fans to test the game's early builds.\n\nMicrosoft released the game in March 2018 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Xbox One]]; it was also one of the earliest [[first-party]] games released for [[Xbox Game Pass]] subscribers. The game received generally mixed reviews upon release, with critics praising the game's ship combat, multiplayer gameplay, visuals, and game physics. Criticisms were directed at the game's lack of content, progression, and shallow gameplay. Rare envisioned the title as a \"[[game as a service]]\" and released numerous content updates after the game's release. The game is a commercial success and has attracted more than 10 million players as of January 2020. Microsoft declared the game the most successful new [[intellectual property]] (IP) they have released in the [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|generation]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sea of Thieves gameplay screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|In this gameplay screenshot, the player is firing cannonballs at a hostile pirate ship, which is controlled by another group of players.]]\n\n''Sea of Thieves'' is a [[first-person (video games)|first-person]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game.

Joe Neate, the game's executive director, described the game as an \"improv\" comedy, and added that the game is about going \"off-script\".<ref name=\"friendliest\"/> Rare shaped the world and the game's lore to reflect players' actions, including various [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]]s to celebrate their actions or achievements.

Therefore, the team introduced \"horizontal progression\", in which players would only earn cosmetic items as they achieve a higher rank; all items have the same attributes, so endgame content would not confer gameplay bonuses to experienced players. This progression system encourages more experienced players to assist novice players when they are completing voyages, and reduce the gap between the two experience levels.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/sea-of-thieves-has-fully-embraced-power-levelling-according-to-the-design-director-its-not-what-you-think/|title=Sea of Thieves 'fully embraces' power levelling, according to the design director (it's not what you think)|first=Connor|last=Sheridan|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=28 February 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> As a \"shared world\" adventure game, Rare opted to maintain the distance between each player group in a server rather than limiting the number of players a server can accommodate, so that players get to encounter other players regularly but not too frequently.{{efn|Chapman estimated that a player will see another player-controlled ships every 15 minutes to half an hour.}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/13/sea-of-thieves-doesnt-have-a-maximum-or-minimum-server-size|title=Sea of Thieves Has a Very Smart Approach to Server Size|first=Joe|last=Skrebels|work=[[IGN]]|date=13 February 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay was designed to test the player's [[soft skills]]. Players need to exercise their [[common sense]] in order to solve the challenges: for instance, players need to learn to read maps. To encourage players to develop these skills, the game does not feature a beginner's [[tutorial]] as the team wanted players to discover the game's mechanics by themselves.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> The team also intentionally avoided setting gameplay rules to encourage players to utilize their creativity.<ref name=\"solo play\">{{cite web|url=https://www.mcvuk.com/development-news/when-we-made-sea-of-thieves/|title=When We Made\u2026 Sea of Thieves|first=Marie|last=Dealessandri|work=[[MCVUK]]|date=20 June 2019|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> Despite this, Rare also included [[emergent gameplay]] in a more systemic manner by introducing shipwrecks and fonts that players can discover.

Jordan Devore from ''[[Destructoid]]'' noted that with a full crew, the game could get chaotic and situations could turn volatile very quickly. He added that cooperation with strangers could create unforgettable experiences for players which could be deeply satisfying.<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/> Peter Brown from ''[[GameSpot]]'' also enjoyed coordinating with other players and goofing around, though he remarked that some players were [[trolling]] others which caused the experience to be frustrating.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> Jeff Grubb from ''[[VentureBeat]]'' also enjoyed the game, saying that playing with strangers often created numerous hilarious moments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/20/sea-of-thieves-is-mesmerizing-and-hilarious/|title=Sea of Thieves is mesmerizing and hilarious|first=Jeff|last=Grubb|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=20 March 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> Kyle Hilliard from ''[[Game Informer]]'' stated that each session \"results in a story\" due to the emergent gameplay, and praised Rare for successfully creating an excellent \"pirate simulator\" and \"manufacturing a digital playground that is fun to explore\".<ref name=\"GIRev\"/>  Sam Loveridge from ''[[GamesRadar]]'' likewise commented that the game is \"an anecdote generator at its very best\" due to its emergent storytelling.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Brandin Tyrrel from ''[[IGN]]'' stated that \"''Sea of Thieves'' works well when treated like a [[chat room]] or a [[party game]], where it serves as catalyst for having a good time with the people you\u2019re with\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Tyrell |first=Brandin |date=27 March 2018 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/28/sea-of-thieves-review |title=Sea of Thieves Review |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay received generally negative reviews.

The player assumes the role of a pirate who completes voyages from different trading companies to become the ultimate pirate legend. ''Sea of Thieves'' is a [[first-person perspective|first-person]] [[cooperative gameplay|multiplayer]] game in which a group of players [[cooperative gameplay|cooperates]] with each other to explore an [[open world]] via a pirate ship. The game is described as a \"shared world adventure game\", which means groups of players will encounter each other regularly during their adventures.\n\nMost of Rare's employees worked on the title and the game was first conceptualized in 2014. The game was inspired by players of [[personal computer|PC]] games such as ''[[Eve Online]]'', ''[[DayZ (video game)|DayZ]]'' and ''[[Rust (video game)|Rust]]'', who used the tools provided by these games to create their own personal stories. The company explored different settings for the game, such as vampires and dinosaurs, though it eventually settled on the pirate theme, drawing inspirations from films including ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' and ''[[The Goonies]]''. The game features a progression system that only unlocks cosmetic items as the development team wanted to encourage both casual and experienced players to play together. Compared to Rare's other games, ''Sea of Thieves''{{'s}} development process was more transparent, with Rare inviting fans to test the game's early builds.\n\nMicrosoft released the game in March 2018 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Xbox One]]; it was also one of the earliest [[first-party]] games released for [[Xbox Game Pass]] subscribers. The game received generally mixed reviews upon release, with critics praising the game's ship combat, multiplayer gameplay, visuals, and game physics. Criticisms were directed at the game's lack of content, progression, and shallow gameplay. Rare envisioned the title as a \"[[game as a service]]\" and released numerous content updates after the game's release. The game is a commercial success and has attracted more than 10 million players as of January 2020. Microsoft declared the game the most successful new [[intellectual property]] (IP) they have released in the [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|generation]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sea of Thieves gameplay screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|In this gameplay screenshot, the player is firing cannonballs at a hostile pirate ship, which is controlled by another group of players.]]\n\n''Sea of Thieves'' is a [[first-person (video games)|first-person]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game.

The team believed that if a narrative campaign is included, incorporating players' actions into the game's lore would become difficult.<ref name=\"friendliest\"/><ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/>\n\nThe company explored different settings for the game, such as [[vampire]]s and [[dinosaur]]s, though it eventually settled on the [[piracy|pirate]] theme because it matched the game's core concept which encourages cooperation. Rare also saw less competition in the market.{{efn|Duncan elaborated that the team was thankful that they did not chose dinosaur as the setting due to the release of ''[[Ark: Survival Evolved]]'' (2017)}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/19/rare-considered-vampire-dinosaur-themes-for-sea-of-thieves-a-ign-unfiltered|title=Rare Considered Vampire, Dinosaur Themes for Sea of Thieves \u2014 IGN Unfiltered|first=Alex|last=Osborn|work=[[IGN]]|date=20 March 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> The pirate theme allows players to have the freedom to do what they want in the game's world and decide freely how they want to play and behave. The team looked at various sources for inspiration, including ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' and ''[[Black Sails (TV series)|Black Sails]]''. Designer Mike Chapman believed a lot of parallels can be drawn between ''Sea of Thieves'' and ''[[The Goonies]]'', in which a group of friends bond together while they search for treasure, creating a journey that all of them would fondly remember.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> Neate added that the game's goal was to evoke \"[a] sense of travel and exploration and discovery\".<ref name=\"voice\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/22/17971710/sea-of-thieves-lore-forsaken-shores-cursed-sails-worldbuilding|title=Sea of Thieves\u2019 lore is surprisingly deep, silly and refreshing|first=Cass|last=Marshall|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=22 October 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> The team implemented the \"infinite pirate generator\" instead of allowing players to customize their avatar as they feared that some players would create \"abominations\" that would not have fit the game's visual style.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/317084/How_Rare_designed_Sea_of_Thieves_infinite_pirate_generator.php|title=How Rare designed Sea of Thieves' infinite pirate generator|first=Jack|last=Yarwood|work=[[Gamasutra]]|date=27 April 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> The game features a stylized visual style with hand-painted textures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1025015/Visual-Adventures-on-Sea-of|title=Visual Adventures on 'Sea of Thieves'|work=GDC Vault|first=Ryan|last=Stevenson|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> Duncan added that the team chose this painted art style because they wanted it to be \"timeless\" and reflect the  \"joyful\" and \"delightful\" game world.<ref name=\"art\"/>\n\n===Gameplay design===\n\nRare noticed that in many multiplayer games, experienced players would focus on grinding for endgame content instead of playing with other players, while novice players would worry about their progression lagging significantly behind more experienced players. Therefore, the team introduced \"horizontal progression\", in which players would only earn cosmetic items as they achieve a higher rank; all items have the same attributes, so endgame content would not confer gameplay bonuses to experienced players. This progression system encourages more experienced players to assist novice players when they are completing voyages, and reduce the gap between the two experience levels.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/sea-of-thieves-has-fully-embraced-power-levelling-according-to-the-design-director-its-not-what-you-think/|title=Sea of Thieves 'fully embraces' power levelling, according to the design director (it's not what you think)|first=Connor|last=Sheridan|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=28 February 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> As a \"shared world\" adventure game, Rare opted to maintain the distance between each player group in a server rather than limiting the number of players a server can accommodate, so that players get to encounter other players regularly but not too frequently.{{efn|Chapman estimated that a player will see another player-controlled ships every 15 minutes to half an hour.}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/13/sea-of-thieves-doesnt-have-a-maximum-or-minimum-server-size|title=Sea of Thieves Has a Very Smart Approach to Server Size|first=Joe|last=Skrebels|work=[[IGN]]|date=13 February 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay was designed to test the player's [[soft skills]]. Players need to exercise their [[common sense]] in order to solve the challenges: for instance, players need to learn to read maps. To encourage players to develop these skills, the game does not feature a beginner's [[tutorial]] as the team wanted players to discover the game's mechanics by themselves.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> The team also intentionally avoided setting gameplay rules to encourage players to utilize their creativity.<ref name=\"solo play\">{{cite web|url=https://www.mcvuk.com/development-news/when-we-made-sea-of-thieves/|title=When We Made\u2026 Sea of Thieves|first=Marie|last=Dealessandri|work=[[MCVUK]]|date=20 June 2019|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> Despite this, Rare also included [[emergent gameplay]] in a more systemic manner by introducing shipwrecks and fonts that players can discover. Chapman described these locations of interest as the \"catalyst for stories\" which draw different players together, fostering cooperation or competition. Being attacked by [[sea monster]]s also add a layer of unpredictability to the game as these encounters are random.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> Due to the emergent gameplay, ''Sea of Thieves'' was also considered as a \"watachable and sharable game\", and the team hoped that this will lure players who watched the game on [[video game live streaming]] platforms such as [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] or [[Mixer (service)|Mixer]] to purchase it.<ref name=\"Watchable game\"/>\n\nWhile the game allows solo play, the game is designed to be a multiplayer game in which players cooperate with each other. Chapman added that [[cooperative gameplay]] enhances the experience because \"it makes sense in the world\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/06/14/sea-of-thieves-lets-you-captain-your-pirate-ship-solo-but-at-a-cost/|title=Sea of Thieves lets you captain your pirate ship solo \u2014 but at a cost|first=Jeff|last=Grubb|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=14 June 2016|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> The game does not feature any [[character class]] or specialization to encourage players to adopt different roles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-01-10-sea-of-thieves-devs-explain-how-its-design-encourages-cooperation|title=Sea of Thieves devs explain how its design encourages cooperation|first=Jeffery|last=Matulef|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=11 January 2017|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> The maximum crew size is four as Rare felt that if the group is too large, it does not reflect a sense of \"intimate friendship\" and players may splinter off and hinder inter-player communication.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/13/sea-of-thieves-dev-explains-why-the-maximum-crew-size-is-4-players|title=Sea of Thieves Dev Explains Why the Maximum Crew Size Is 4 Players|first=Joe|last=Skrebels|work=[[IGN]]|date=13 February 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> Neate described the game as a \"friendship creation tool\" and hoped that the game could become a platform where players can befriend strangers.<ref name=\"no secret\"/> Rare further added that they felt they have the responsibility to create a \"positive online social space\".<ref name=\"online space\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/rare-on-sea-of-thieves-online-we-have-a-responsibility-as-game-creators-to-make-a-positive-social-space/|title=Rare on Sea of Thieves: 'We have a responsibility to make a positive online social space'|first=Joe|last=Donnelly|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=20 March 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> Design changes were made to champion the concept of cooperation and friendship.

As defined by [[Karen Mossberger]], one of the authors of ''Digital Citizenship: The Internet, Society, and Participation'', digital citizens are \"those who use the internet regularly and effectively.\" They also have a comprehensive understanding of digital citizenship, which is the appropriate and responsible behavior when using technology.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=7fNHAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA742&lpg=PA742&dq=those+who+use+the+Internet+regularly+and+effectively|title=The 19th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering|isbn=978-3-642-37270-4|page=742|accessdate=6 June 2015|last1=Qi|first1=Ershi|last2=Shen|first2=Jiang|last3=Dou|first3=Runliang|date=2013-06-03}}</ref> Since digital citizenship evaluates the quality of an individual's response to membership in a digital community, it often requires the participation of all community members, both visible and those who are less visible.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/digitalcommunity0000ohle|url-access=registration|quote=those who use the Internet regularly and effectively.|title=Digital Community, Digital Citizen|publisher=SAGE Publications|last1=Ohler|first1=Jason B.|isbn=978-1412971447|page=[https://archive.org/details/digitalcommunity0000ohle/page/25 25]|accessdate=6 June 2015|date=2010-08-31}}</ref> A large part in being a responsible digital citizen encompasses digital literacy, etiquette, [[online safety]], and an acknowledgement of private versus public information.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.virtuallibrary.info/digital-citizenship.html|title=Digital Citizenship|website=Virtual Library|access-date=2018-11-05}}</ref>\n\nPeople characterizing themselves as digital citizens often use IT extensively, creating [[blogs]], using [[social networks]], and participating in [[Digital journalism|online journalism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/4678631.stm|title=Have Your Say - Are you a digital citizen?|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Although digital citizenship begins when any child, teen, and/or adult signs up for an email address, posts pictures online, uses [[e-commerce]] to buy merchandise online, and/or participates in any electronic function that is [[Business-to-business|B2B]] or [[B2C]], the process of becoming a digital citizen goes beyond simple internet activity. According to [[Thomas Humphrey Marshall]], a British sociologist known for his work on social citizenship, a primary framework of citizenship comprises three different traditions: liberalism, republicanism, and ascriptive hierarchy. Within this framework, the digital citizen needs to exist in order to promote equal economic opportunities and increase political participation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=T. H.|chapter=The Problem Stated with the Assistance of Alfred Marshall|title=Citizenship and Social Class|editor1=T. H. Marshall|editor2=T. Bottomore|pages=3\u201351|location=London|publisher=Pluto Perspectives|isbn=978-0745304762|date=January 1987}}</ref> In this way, digital technology helps to lower the [[barriers to entry]] for participation as a citizen within a society.\n\nHolistically, digital citizenship covers both a social and political point of view, utilized at a local level in school and other [[educational system]]s while also being debated upon on a national level. There are many means of participating as a digital citizen to advocate for causes or specific issues that are controversial, and being a digital citizen encompasses a level of responsibility that includes universal goals that should be followed.\n\n== Types of digital participation ==\nThe development of digital citizen participation can be divided into two main stages, the first being through information dissemination.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080710184539/http://www.businessofgovernment.org/pdfs/HolzerReport.pdf Restoring Trust in Government: The Potential of Digital Citizen Participation]</ref> Within information dissemination, one subcategory includes '''static information dissemination''', characterized largely by citizens who utilize read-only websites where they take control of data from credible sources in order to formulate judgments or facts. Many of these websites where credible information may be found are provided by the government. Another subcategory includes '''dynamic information dissemination''', which is more interactive and involves citizens as well as public servants. Both questions and answers can be communicated, and citizens have the opportunity to engage in question-and-answer dialogues through two-way communication platforms\n\nThe second stage of digital citizen participation is citizen deliberation, which evaluates what type of participation and role that they play when attempting to ignite some sort of policy change. For '''static citizen participants''', citizens can play a role by engaging in online polls as well as through complaints and recommendations sent up, mainly toward the government who can create changes in policy decisions. '''Dynamic citizen participants''' can deliberate amongst others on their thoughts and recommendations in town hall meetings or various media sites.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of participating in online debates through digital citizenship is that it incorporates [[sense of community|social inclusion]]. In a report on [[civic engagement]], citizen-powered democracy can be initiated either through information shared through the web, direct communication signals made by the state toward the public, and social media tactics from both private and public companies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dubow|first=Talitha|date=March 2017|title=Civic Engagement: How can digital technologies underpin citizen-powered democracy?|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/conf_proceedings/CF300/CF373/RAND_CF373.pdf|journal=RAND Corporation|pages=25}}</ref> In fact, it was found that the community-based nature of social media platforms allow individuals to feel more socially included and informed about political issues that peers have also been found to engage with, otherwise known as a \"second-order effect.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Voorveld|first=Hilde A. M.|last2=van Noort|first2=Guda|last3=Muntinga|first3=Dani\u00ebl G.|last4=Bronner|first4=Fred|date=2018-01-02|title=Engagement with Social Media and Social Media Advertising: The Differentiating Role of Platform Type|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=47|issue=1|pages=38\u201354|doi=10.1080/00913367.2017.1405754|issn=0091-3367}}</ref> Two types of opportunities rise as a result, the first being the ability to lower barriers that can make exchanges much easier. In addition, they have the chance to participate in transformative disruption, giving people who have a historically lower political engagement to mobilize in a much easier and convenient fashion.\n\nNonetheless, there are several challenges that face the presence of digital technologies in political participation. Both current as well as potential challenges can create significant risks for democratic processes. Not only is digital technology still seen as relatively ambiguous, it was also seen to have \"less inclusivity in democratic life.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fenwick|first=Tara|last2=Edwards|first2=Richard|date=2016-01-01|title=Exploring the impact of digital technologies on professional responsibilities and education|journal=European Educational Research Journal|volume=15|issue=1|pages=117\u2013131|doi=10.1177/1474904115608387|issn=1474-9041}}</ref> Demographic groups differ considerably in the use of technology, and thus, one group could potentially be more represented than another as a result of digital participation. Another primary challenge consists in the ideology of a \"[[filter bubble]]\" effect. Alongside a tremendous spread of false information, internet users could reinforce existing prejudices and assist in polarizing disagreements in the public sphere. This can lead to misinformed voting and decisions based on exposure rather than on pure knowledge. A [[communication technology]] director, Van Dijk, stated, \"Computerized information campaigns and mass public information systems have to be designed and supported in such a way that they help to narrow the gap between the 'information rich' and 'information poor' otherwise the spontaneous development of ICT will widen it.\" Access and equivalent amounts of knowledge behind digital technology must be equivalent in order for a fair system to put into place.\n[[File:2019 EITI Global Conference 2019 EITI Global Conference (48093042323).jpg|thumb|Hosted by the Government of France at the OECD Conference Centre in Paris, representatives discussed trust in data and how we can utilize data to spread openness in addressing environmental challenges.]]\nAlongside a lack of evidenced support for technology that can be proven to be safe for citizens, the [[OECD]] has identified five struggles for the online engagement of citizens:\n\n#'''Scale:''' To what extent can we allow every individual's voice to be heard, but also not be lost in the mass debate? This can be extremely challenging for the government, who may not effectively know how to listen and respond to each individual contribution.\n#'''Capacity:''' How can digital technology offer citizens with more information on public policy making? The opportunity for citizens to debate with one another is lacking for [[active citizenship]].\n#'''Coherence:''' The government is yet to design a more holistic view of policy-making cycle and the use of design technology to better prepare information from citizens in each stage of the policy-making cycle.\n#'''Evaluation:''' There is a greater need now than ever before to figure out whether or not online engagement can help meet the citizen as well as the government's objectives.\n#'''Commitment:''' Is the government committed to analyze and use citizen's public input, and how can this process be validated more regularly?\n\n== Developed states and developing countries ==\nHighly developed states possess the capacity to link their respective governments with digital sites. Such sites function in ways such as publicising recent legislation, current and future policy objectives; lending agency toward political candidates; and/or allowing citizens to voice themselves in a political way. Likewise, the emergence of these sites has been linked to increased voting advocacy. Lack of access to technology can be a serious obstacle in becoming a digital citizen, since many elementary procedures such as tax report filing, birth registration, and use of websites to support candidates in political campaigns ([[e-democracy]]) have become available solely via the internet. Furthermore, many cultural and commercial entities only publicize information on web pages. Non-digital citizens will not be able to retrieve this information, and this may lead to [[social isolation]] or [[economic stagnation]].\n\nThe gap between digital citizens and non-digital citizens is often referred as the [[digital divide]]. In [[developing countries]], digital citizens are fewer. They consist of the people who use technology to overcome local obstacles including development issues, corruption, and even military conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/gear/2005-08-28-cell-banks-africa_x.htm|title=Africa's cell phone boom creates a base for low-cost banking|work=usatoday.com}}</ref> Examples of such citizens include users of [[Ushahidi]] during the [[2007\u201308 Kenyan crisis|2007 disputed Kenyan election]] and protesters in the [[Arab Spring]] movements who used media to document repression of protests. Currently, the digital divide is a subject of academic debate as access to the internet has increased in these developing countries, but the place in which it is accessed (work, home, public library, etc.) has a significant effect on how such access will be used, if even in a manner related to citizenry. Recent scholarship has correlated the desire to be technologically proficient with greater belief in computer access equity, and thus, digital citizenship (Shelley, et al.).\n\nOn the other side of the divide, one example of a highly-developed digital technology program in a wealthy state is the [[e-Residency of Estonia]]. This form of digital residency allows both citizens and non-citizens of the state to pursue business opportunities in a digital business environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://e-resident.gov.ee/become-an-e-resident/|title=e-Residency Benefits {{!}} Digital Nomad, Freelancer, Startup Company|website=e-Residency|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> The application is simple; residents can fill out a form with their passport and photograph alongside the reason for applying. Following a successful application, the \"e-residency\" will allow them to register a company, sign documents, make online banking declarations, and file medical prescriptions online, though they will be tracked through financial footprints. The project plans to cover over 10 million e-residents by 2025 and {{as of|2019|04|lc=y|post=,}} there were over 54,000 participants from over 162 countries that have expressed an interest, contributing millions of dollars to the country's economy and assisting in access to any public service online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninaangelovska/2019/04/25/estonias-e-residency-contributed-e14m-to-its-economy-e-residency-2-0-will-be-a-true-forerunner/|title=Estonia's E-Residency Contributed \u20ac14M To Its Economy--'E-Residency 2.0 Will Be A True Forerunner'|last=Angelovska|first=Nina|website=Forbes|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> Other benefits include hassle-free administration, lower business costs, access to the European Union market, and a broad range of e-services. Though the programme is designed for entrepreneurs, Estonia hopes to value transparency and resourcefulness as a cause for other companies to implement similar policies domestically.\n\nNonetheless, Estonia's e-Residency system has been subject to criticism. Many have pointed out that [[tax treaties]] within their own countries will play a major role in preventing this idea from spreading to more countries. Another risk is politically for governments to sustain \"funding and legislative priorities across different coalitions of power.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kotka|first=Taavi|date=September 2015|title=Estonian e-Residency: Redefining the Nation-State in the Digital Era|url=https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/materials/publications/14883/workingpaperno3kotkavargaskorjus.pdf|journal=Cyber Studies Programme}}</ref> Most importantly, the threat of [[cyberattack]]s may disrupt the seemingly optimal idea of having a platform for eIDs, as Estonia suffered its own massive cyberattack in 2007 by Russian [[hacktivism|hacktivists]]. Today, the protection of digital services and databases is essential to national security, and many countries are still hesitant to take the next step forward to promote a new system that will change the scale of politics with all its citizens.\n\n== Other forms of digital divide ==\nWithin developed countries, the digital divide, other than economic differences, is attributed to educational levels. A study conducted by the United States [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]] determined that the gap in computer usage and internet access widened 7.8% and 25% between those with the most and least education, and it has been observed that those with college degrees or higher are 10 times more likely to have internet access at work when compared with those with only a high school education.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bezuidenhout|first=Louise M.|last2=Leonelli|first2=Sabina|last3=Kelly|first3=Ann H.|last4=Rappert|first4=Brian|date=2017-08-01|title=Beyond the digital divide: Towards a situated approach to open data|journal=Science and Public Policy|volume=44|issue=4|pages=464\u2013475|doi=10.1093/scipol/scw036|issn=0302-3427}}</ref>\n\nA digital divide often extends along specific racial lines as well. The difference in computer usage grew by 39.2% between White and Black households and by 42.6% between White and Hispanic households only three years ago.{{when?|date=March 2020}} Race can also affect the number of computers at school, and as expected, gaps between racial groups narrow at higher income levels while widening among households at lower economic levels. [[Racial disparities in education|Racial disparities]] have been proven to exist irrespective of income, and in a cultural study to determine reasons for the divide other than income, in accordance to the Hispanic community, computers were seen as a luxury, not a need. Participants collectively stated that computer activities isolated individuals and took away valuable time from family activities. In the African-American community, it was observed that they historically have had negative encounters with technological innovations, and with Asian-Americans, education was emphasized, and thus, there was a larger number of people who embraced the rise in [[Innovation|technological advances.]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dijk|first=Jan|date=August 2017|title=Digital Divide Research, Achievements, and Shortcomings|journal=Poetics|pages=34}}</ref>\n\nAn educational divide also takes place as a result of differences in the use of daily technology. In a report analyzed by the [[ACT (test)|ACT]] Center for Equity in Learning, \"85% of respondents reported having access to anywhere from two to five devices at home. The remaining one percent of respondents reported having access to no devices at home.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Raeal|date=August 2018|title=The Digital Divide and Educational Equity|url=https://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/R1698-digital-divide-2018-08.pdf|journal=ACT Center for Equity in Learning}}</ref> For the 14% of respondents with one device at home, many of them reported the need to share these devices with other household members, facing challenges that are often overlooked. The data all suggests that wealthier families have access to more devices. In addition, out of the respondents that only used one device at home, 24% of them lived in rural areas, and over half reported that this one device was a smartphone; this could make completing schoolwork assignments more difficult. The ACT recommended that underserved students need access to more devices and higher-quality networks, and educators should do their best to ensure that students can find as many electronic materials through their phones to not place a burden on family plans. \n\n==Engagement of youth==\n[[File:Inclusion Convention.jpg|thumb|At the 2018 Institutional Convention, Shola Mos-Shogbamimu, founder of the Convention, discusses the role of digital media in preventing the spread of sexual harassment and what measures can be taken to stop the spread of negativity in youth.]]\nA recent survey revealed that teenagers and young adults spend more time on the internet than watching TV. This has raised a number of concerns about how internet use could impact cognitive abilities.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mills |first1=Kathryn |title=Possible Effects of Internet Use on Cognitive Development in Adolescence |journal=Media and Communication |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=4 |doi=10.17645/mac.v4i3.516 |year=2016}}</ref> According to a study by Wartella et al., teens are concerned about how digital technologies may have an impact on their health.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wartella |first1=Ellen |last2=Rideout |first2=Vicky |last3=Montague |first3=Heather |last4=Beaudoin-Ryan |first4=Leanne |last5=Lauricella |first5=Alexis |title=Teens, Health and Technology: A National Survey |journal=Media and Communication |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=13 |doi=10.17645/mac.v4i3.515 |year=2016}}</ref> Digital youth can generally be viewed as the test market for the next generation's digital content and services. Sites such as [[Myspace]] and [[Facebook]] have come to the fore in sites where youth participate and engage with others on the internet. However, due to the lack of popularity of MySpace in particular, more young people are turning to websites such as [[Snapchat]], [[Instagram]], and [[YouTube]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/03/health/teens-tweens-media-screen-use-report/|title=Teens spend 9 hours a day using media, report says |first=Kelly |last=Wallace|work=CNN|access-date=2018-02-03}}</ref> It was reported that teenagers spend up to nine hours a day online, with the vast majority of that time spent on social media websites from mobile devices, contributing to the ease of access and availability to young people.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.socialmediatoday.com/marketing/how-much-time-do-people-spend-social-media-infographic|title=How Much Time Do People Spend on Social Media? [Infographic]|work=Social Media Today|access-date=2018-02-03}}</ref> Vast amounts of money are spent annually to research the demographic by hiring psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists in order to discover habits, values and fields of interest.\n\nParticularly in the United States, \"Social media use has become so pervasive in the lives of American teens that having a presence on a social network is almost synonymous with being online; 95% of all teens ages 12-17 are now online and 80% of those online teens are users of social media sites\".<ref>\"[http://www.pewinternet.org/2011/11/09/teens-kindness-and-cruelty-on-social-network-sites/ How American Teens Navigate the New World of 'digital Citizenship']\". Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project. Web. 23 Nov. 2011.</ref>{{Update inline|date=March 2020}} However, movements such as these appear to benefit strictly those wishing to advocate for their business towards youth. The critical time when young people are developing their civic identities is between the ages 15\u201322. During this time they develop three attributes, civic literacy, civic skills and civic attachment, that constitute civic engagement later reflected in political actions of their adult lives.\n\nFor youth to fully participate and realize their presence on the internet, a quality level of reading comprehension is required. \"The average government web site, for example, requires an eleventh-grade level of reading comprehension, even though about half of the U.S. population reads at an eighth-grade level or lower\".<ref name=\"mossberger-digital-citizenship\">{{cite book|title=Digital Citizenship - The Internet, Society & Participation|last1=Mossberger|first1=Karen|last2=Tolbert|first2=Caroline J.|last3=McNeal|first3=Ramona S. |author-link2=Caroline Tolbert|date=October 2007|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=978-0262633536}}</ref> So despite the internet being a place irrespective of certain factors such as race, religion, and class, education plays a large part in a person's capacity to present themselves online in a formal manner conducive towards their citizenry. Concurrently, education also affects people's motivation to participate online.\n\nStudents should be encouraged to utilize technology with responsibility and ethical digital citizenship promoted. Education on harmful viruses and other [[malware]] must be emphasized to protect resources. A student can be a successful digital citizen with the help of educators, parents, and school counselors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.educationworld.com/a_tech/responsible-student-technology-use.shtml|title=Help Kids Become Responsible Digital Citizens|publisher=educationworld.com}}</ref>\n\n==Limits on the use of data==\nInternational [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] guidelines state that \"personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which they are to be used, and to the extent necessary for those purposes should be accurate, complete, and kept up to date\". Article 8 prevents subjects to certain exceptions. Meaning that certain things cannot be published online revealing race, ethnicity, religion, political stance, health, and sex life. in the United States, this is enforced generally by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC)- but very generally. For example, the FTC brought an action against Microsoft for failing to properly protect customers' personal information.<ref>[http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/dsolove/Digital-Person/text/Digital-Person-CH1.pdf ''The Digital Person - Technology and Privacy in the Information Age'' - Chapter 1]</ref> In addition, many have described the United States as being in a [[cyberwarfare|cyberwar]] with Russia, and several Americans have credited Russia to their country's downfall in transparency and declining trust in the government. With several foreign users posting anonymous information through social media in order to gather a following, it is difficult to understand whom to target and what affiliation or root cause they may have of performing a particular action aimed to sway public opinion.\n\nThe FTC does play a significant role in protecting the digital citizen. However, individuals' public records are increasingly useful to the government and highly sought after. This material can help the government detect a variety of crimes such as fraud, drug distribution rings, terrorist cells. it makes it easier to properly profile a suspected criminal and keep an eye on them. Although there are a variety of ways to gather information on an individual through credit card history, employment history, and more, the internet is becoming the most desirable information gatherer thanks to its fa\u00e7ade of security and the amount of information that can be stored on the internet. [[Internet anonymity|Anonymity]] has proven to be very rare online as [[Internet service provider|ISP]]s can keep track of an individual's activity online.<ref>[http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/dsolove/Digital-Person/text/Digital-Person-CH9.pdf ''The Digital Person - Technology and Privacy in the Information Age'' - Chapter 9]</ref> Furthermore, an open internet as delegated by a state's government is necessary to instill a sense of trust, legitimacy, and participation in the state's citizenry. [[WikiLeaks]] represents an occurrence where particular political actors have criticized and taken citizen action toward revealing the government's unnecessary clandestine activity online. As stated by the a representative from the ''World Heritage Encyclopedia'', \"The benefit of transparency isn't just catching red-handed bastards. It's also about collaborating and coming together with a more engaged citizenry,\" and many critics have stated that the process in doing so will still take several years.\n\n==Three principles of digital citizenship==\nDigital citizenship is a term used to define the appropriate and responsible use of technology among users. Three principles were developed by Mark Ribble to teach digital users how to responsibly use technology to become a digital citizen: respect, educate, and protect.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.iste.org/explore/articleDetail?articleid=535|title=Digital citizenship is more important than ever|access-date=2018-10-22}}</ref> Each principle contains three of the nine elements of digital citizenship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalcitizenship.net/nine-elements.html|title=Nine Elements|website=Digital Citizenship|access-date=2018-10-22}}</ref>\n# '''Respect:''' the elements of etiquette, access, and law are used to respect other digital users.\n# '''Educate:''' the elements of literacy, communication, and commerce are used to learn about the appropriate use of the digital world.\n# '''Protect:''' the elements of rights and responsibilities, security, and health and wellness are used to remain safe in the digital and non-digital world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iste.org/explore/Lead-the-way/Digital-citizenship-is-more-important-than-ever?articleid=535|title=Digital citizenship is more important than ever {{!}} ISTE|website=www.iste.org|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\nWithin these three core principles, there are nine elements to also be considered in regards to digital citizenship. According to digitalcitizenship.net, these nine theme include:<ref>[http://www.digitalcitizenship.net/nine-elements.html Nine Themes of Digital Citizenship], digitalcitizenship.net</ref>\n\n#'''Digital access''': This is perhaps one of the most fundamental blocks to being a digital citizen. However, due to socioeconomic status, location, and other disabilities, some individuals may not have digital access. Recently, schools have been becoming more connected with the internet, often offering computers, and other forms of access. This can be offered through kiosks, community centers, and open labs. This most often is associated with the digital divide and factors associated with such. Digital access is available in many remote countries via cyber caf\u00e9s and small coffee shops.<ref>[http://www.iste.org/docs/excerpts/DIGCI2-excerpt.pdf Digital Citizenship in Schools - Excerpt]</ref>\n#'''[[Digital commerce]]''': This is the ability for users to recognize that much of the economy is regulated online. It also deals with the understanding of the dangers and benefits of online buying, using credit cards online, and so forth. As with the advantages and legal activities- there is also dangerous activities such as illegal downloads, gambling, drug deals, pornography, plagiarism, and so forth.\n#'''Digital communication''': This element deals with understanding the variety of online communication mediums such as email, instant messaging, Facebook messenger, the variety of apps, and so forth. There is a standard of etiquette associated with each medium.\n#'''[[Digital literacy]]''': This deals with the understanding of how to use various digital devices. For example, how to properly search for something on a search engine versus a database. How to use various online logs. Oftentimes many educational institutions will help form an individual's digital literacy.\n#'''[[Etiquette in technology|Digital etiquette]]''': As discussed in the third element, digital communication, this is the expectation that various mediums require a variety of etiquette. Certain mediums demand more appropriate behavior and language than others.\n#'''Digital law''': This is where enforcement occurs for illegal downloads, plagiarizing, hacking, creating viruses, sending spam, identity theft, [[cyberbullying]], and so forth.\n#'''Digital rights and responsibilities''': This is the set of rights digital citizens have such as privacy and free speech.\n#'''Digital health''': Digital citizens must be aware of the physical stress placed on their bodies by internet usage. They must be aware to not become overly dependent on the internet causing problems such as eye strain, headaches, and stress.\n#'''Digital security''': This simply means that citizens must take measures to be safe by practicing using secure passwords, virus protection, backing up data, and so forth.\n\n== Digital citizenship in education ==\nAccording to Mike Ribble, an author who has worked on the topic of digital citizenship for more than a decade, digital access is the first element that is prevalent in today's educational curriculum. He cited a widening gap between the impoverished and the wealthy, as 41% of African Americans and Hispanics use computers in the home when compared to 77% of white students. Other crucial digital elements include digital commerce, digital communication, digital literacy, and digital etiquette. He also emphasized that educators must understand that technology is important for all students, not just those who already have access to it, in order to decrease the digital divide that currently exists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://choraltech.wordpress.com/nine-elements-of-digital-citizenship-mike-ribble/|title=Nine Elements of Digital Citizenship \u2013 Mike Ribble|date=2017-09-10|website=Choraltech|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in research brought up by [[Common Sense Media]], approximately six out of 10 US K-12 teachers used some type of digital citizenship curriculum, and seven out of ten taught some sort of competency skill utilizing digital citizenship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://d1e2bohyu2u2w9.cloudfront.net/education/sites/default/files/tlr_component/common_sense_education_digital_citizenship_research_backgrounder.pdf|title=Teaching Digital Citizenship In Today's World|last=Steyer|first=Jim|date=Summer 2019|website=Common Sense K-12 Digital Citizenship Curriculum|url-status=live}}</ref> Many of the sections that these teachers focused in on included hate speech, cyberbullying, and digital drama. A problem with digital technology that still exists is that over 35% of students were observed to not possess the proper skills to critically evaluate information online, and these issues and statistics increased as the grade levels rose. Online videos such as those found on YouTube and Netflix have been used approximately by 60% of the K-12 teachers in classrooms, while educational tools such as Microsoft Office and Google G Suite have been used by around half of the teachers. Social media was used the least, at around 13% in comparison to other digital methods of education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/uploads/research/2019-educator-census-inside-the-21st-century-classroom_1.pdf|title=The Common Sense Census: Inside the 21st-Century Classroom |last1=Vega |first1=Vanessa |first2=Michael B. |last2=Robb |date=2019 |website=Common Sense Media |url-status=live}}</ref> When analyzing the social class differences between schools, it was found that Title I schools were more likely to utilize digital citizenship curricula than teachers in more affluent schools.\n\nIn the past two years, there has been a major shift to move students from digital citizenship to digital leadership in order to make a greater impact on online interactions. Though digital citizens take a responsible approach to act ethically, digital leadership is a more proactive approach, encompassing the \"use of internet and social media to improve the lives, well-being, and circumstances of others\" as part of one's daily life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teachthought.com/the-future-of-learning/moving-students-from-digital-citizenship-to-digital-leadership/|title=Moving Students From Digital Citizenship To Digital Leadership|date=2018-11-19|website=TeachThought|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> On February 2018, after the Valentine's Day shooting in [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting|Parkland, Florida]], students became dynamic digital citizens, using social media and other web platforms to engage proactively on the issue and push back against cyberbullies and misinformation. Students from [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School]] specifically rallied against gun violence, engaging in live tweeting, texting, videoing, and recording the attack as it happened, utilizing onside digital tools to not only witness what was happening at the time but to allow the world to witness it as well. This allowed the nation to see and react, and as a result, students built a webpage and logo for their new movement.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dillenbourg|first=Pierre|date=2016-06-01|title=The Evolution of Research on Digital Education|journal=International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education|volume=26|issue=2|pages=544\u2013560|doi=10.1007/s40593-016-0106-z|issn=1560-4306}}</ref> They gave interviews to major media outlets and at rallies and protects and coordinated a nationwide march online on March 24 against elected officials at meetings and town halls.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iste.org/explore/Digital-citizenship/Students-use-grief,-passion,-technology-to-create-a-movement|title=Students use grief, passion, technology to create a movement {{!}} ISTE|website=iste.org|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> The idea of this shift in youth is to express empathy beyond one's self, and moving to seeing this self in the digital company of others.\n\nNonetheless, several critics state that just as empathy can be spread to a vast number of individuals, hatred can be spread as well.

This can be through information creation, research, scholarly conversations, or simply plugging in keywords into a search engine.\n#'''Copyright, intellectual property respect, attribution:''' By knowing who published sources and whether or not content creation is credible, users can be better educated as to what and what not to believe when engaging in digital participation.\n#'''Health and wellness:''' A healthy community allows for an interactive conversation to take place between educated citizens who are knowledgeable about their environment.\n#'''Empowering student voice, agency, advocacy:''' Utilizing nonprofits as well as government-affiliated organizations in order to empower students to speak up for policy changes that need to be made. Currently, more than 10 different [[mobile applications]] aim to allow students the opportunity to speak up and advocate for rights online.\n#'''Safety, security and privacy:''' Addressing freedoms extended to everyone in a digital world and the balance between the [[right to privacy]] and the safety hazards that go along with it. This area of digital citizenship includes the assistance of students to understand when they are provided the right opportunities, including the proper access to the internet and products that are sold online. It is on the part of educators to assist students in understanding that it is crucial to protect others online.\n#'''Character education and ethics:''' Knowing that ethically speaking, everyone will come with different viewpoints online and it is crucial to remain balanced and moral in [[Targeted advertising|online behavior]].\n#'''Parenting:''' Emphasizing the efforts of educators, many want to continue preaching rules and policies addressing issues related to the online world. Cyberbullying, sexting, and other negative issues that are brought up are regulated by the School Resource Officers and other school counsel.\n\nAltogether, nine of these facets contribute to one another in the development of a healthy and effective education for digital technology and communication.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Civic technology]]\n* [[E-government]]\n* [[Open government]]\n* [[Service design]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/take-the-fbis-safe-online-surfing-internet-challenge Take the Safe Online Surfing Internet Challenge] ([[FBI]])\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Digital Citizen}}\n[[Category:Technology in society]]\n[[Category:Digital technology]]\n[[Category:Internet governance]]\n[[Category:Information revolution]]\n[[Category:Digital divide]]\n[[Category:Internet ethics]]\n[[Category:Digital media]]\n[[Category:Youth-led media]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Person using IT to engage in society, politics, and government}}\n[[File:Annual Federal Bullying Prevention Summit - Adam.jpg|thumb|Every year, the Federal Partners in Bullying Prevention hosts a summit to highlight its work to prevent cyberbullying, especially in schools and amongst students, in efforts to become responsible digital citizens.]]\nA '''digital citizen''' is a person using [[information technology]] (IT) in order to engage in society, politics, and government. As defined by [[Karen Mossberger]], author of ''Digital Citizenship: The Internet, Society, and Participation'', digital citizens are \"those who use the internet regularly and effectively.\" They also have a comprehensive understanding of digital citizenship, which is the appropriate and responsible behavior when using technology.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=7fNHAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA742&lpg=PA742&dq=those+who+use+the+Internet+regularly+and+effectively|title=The 19th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering|isbn=978-3-642-37270-4|page=742|accessdate=6 June 2015|last1=Qi|first1=Ershi|last2=Shen|first2=Jiang|last3=Dou|first3=Runliang|date=2013-06-03}}</ref> Since digital citizenship evaluates the quality of an individual's response to membership in a digital community, it often requires the participation of all community members, both visible and those who are less visible.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/digitalcommunity0000ohle|url-access=registration|quote=those who use the Internet regularly and effectively.|title=Digital Community, Digital Citizen|publisher=SAGE Publications|last1=Ohler|first1=Jason B.|isbn=978-1412971447|page=[https://archive.org/details/digitalcommunity0000ohle/page/25 25]|accessdate=6 June 2015|date=2010-08-31}}</ref> A large part in being a responsible digital citizen encompasses digital literacy, etiquette, [[online safety]], and an acknowledgement of private versus public information.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.virtuallibrary.info/digital-citizenship.html|title=Digital Citizenship|website=Virtual Library|access-date=2018-11-05}}</ref>\n\nPeople characterizing themselves as digital citizens often use IT extensively, creating [[blogs]], using [[social networks]], and participating in [[Digital journalism|online journalism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/4678631.stm|title=Have Your Say - Are you a digital citizen?|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Although digital citizenship begins when any child, teen, and/or adult signs up for an email address, posts pictures online, uses [[e-commerce]] to buy merchandise online, and/or participates in any electronic function that is [[Business-to-business|B2B]] or [[B2C]], the process of becoming a digital citizen goes beyond simple internet activity. According to [[Thomas Humphrey Marshall]], a British sociologist known for his work on social citizenship, a primary framework of citizenship comprises three different traditions: liberalism, republicanism, and ascriptive hierarchy. Within this framework, the digital citizen needs to exist in order to promote equal economic opportunities and increase political participation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=T. H.|chapter=The Problem Stated with the Assistance of Alfred Marshall|title=Citizenship and Social Class|editor1=T. H. Marshall|editor2=T. Bottomore|pages=3\u201351|location=London|publisher=Pluto Perspectives|isbn=978-0745304762|date=January 1987}}</ref> In this way, digital technology helps to lower the [[barriers to entry]] for participation as a citizen within a society.\n\nHolistically, digital citizenship covers both a social and political point of view, utilized at a local level in school and other [[educational system]]s while also being debated upon on a national level. There are many means of participating as a digital citizen to advocate for causes or specific issues that are controversial, and being a digital citizen encompasses a level of responsibility that includes universal goals that should be followed.\n\n== Types of digital participation ==\nThe development of digital citizen participation can be divided into two main stages, the first being through information dissemination.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080710184539/http://www.businessofgovernment.org/pdfs/HolzerReport.pdf Restoring Trust in Government: The Potential of Digital Citizen Participation]</ref> Within information dissemination, one subcategory includes '''static information dissemination''', characterized largely by citizens who utilize read-only websites where they take control of data from credible sources in order to formulate judgments or facts. Many of these websites where credible information may be found are provided by the government. Another subcategory includes '''dynamic information dissemination''', which is more interactive and involves citizens as well as public servants. Both questions and answers can be communicated, and citizens have the opportunity to engage in question-and-answer dialogues through two-way communication platforms\n\nThe second stage of digital citizen participation is citizen deliberation, which evaluates what type of participation and role that they play when attempting to ignite some sort of policy change. For '''static citizen participants''', citizens can play a role by engaging in online polls as well as through complaints and recommendations sent up, mainly toward the government who can create changes in policy decisions. '''Dynamic citizen participants''' can deliberate amongst others on their thoughts and recommendations in town hall meetings or various media sites.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of participating in online debates through digital citizenship is that it incorporates [[sense of community|social inclusion]]. In a report on [[civic engagement]], citizen-powered democracy can be initiated either through information shared through the web, direct communication signals made by the state toward the public, and social media tactics from both private and public companies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dubow|first=Talitha|date=March 2017|title=Civic Engagement: How can digital technologies underpin citizen-powered democracy?|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/conf_proceedings/CF300/CF373/RAND_CF373.pdf|journal=RAND Corporation|pages=25}}</ref> In fact, it was found that the community-based nature of social media platforms allow individuals to feel more socially included and informed about political issues that peers have also been found to engage with, otherwise known as a \"second-order effect.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Voorveld|first=Hilde A. M.|last2=van Noort|first2=Guda|last3=Muntinga|first3=Dani\u00ebl G.|last4=Bronner|first4=Fred|date=2018-01-02|title=Engagement with Social Media and Social Media Advertising: The Differentiating Role of Platform Type|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=47|issue=1|pages=38\u201354|doi=10.1080/00913367.2017.1405754|issn=0091-3367}}</ref> Two types of opportunities rise as a result, the first being the ability to lower barriers that can make exchanges much easier. In addition, they have the chance to participate in transformative disruption, giving people who have a historically lower political engagement to mobilize in a much easier and convenient fashion.\n\nNonetheless, there are several challenges that face the presence of digital technologies in political participation. Both current as well as potential challenges can create significant risks for democratic processes. Not only is digital technology still seen as relatively ambiguous, it was also seen to have \"less inclusivity in democratic life.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fenwick|first=Tara|last2=Edwards|first2=Richard|date=2016-01-01|title=Exploring the impact of digital technologies on professional responsibilities and education|journal=European Educational Research Journal|volume=15|issue=1|pages=117\u2013131|doi=10.1177/1474904115608387|issn=1474-9041}}</ref> Demographic groups differ considerably in the use of technology, and thus, one group could potentially be more represented than another as a result of digital participation. Another primary challenge consists in the ideology of a \"[[filter bubble]]\" effect. Alongside a tremendous spread of false information, internet users could reinforce existing prejudices and assist in polarizing disagreements in the public sphere. This can lead to misinformed voting and decisions based on exposure rather than on pure knowledge. A [[communication technology]] director, Van Dijk, stated, \"Computerized information campaigns and mass public information systems have to be designed and supported in such a way that they help to narrow the gap between the 'information rich' and 'information poor' otherwise the spontaneous development of ICT will widen it.\" Access and equivalent amounts of knowledge behind digital technology must be equivalent in order for a fair system to put into place.\n[[File:2019 EITI Global Conference 2019 EITI Global Conference (48093042323).jpg|thumb|Hosted by the Government of France at the OECD Conference Centre in Paris, representatives discussed trust in data and how we can utilize data to spread openness in addressing environmental challenges.]]\nAlongside a lack of evidenced support for technology that can be proven to be safe for citizens, the [[OECD]] has identified five struggles for the online engagement of citizens:\n\n#'''Scale:''' To what extent can we allow every individual's voice to be heard, but also not be lost in the mass debate? This can be extremely challenging for the government, who may not effectively know how to listen and respond to each individual contribution.\n#'''Capacity:''' How can digital technology offer citizens with more information on public policy making? The opportunity for citizens to debate with one another is lacking for [[active citizenship]].\n#'''Coherence:''' The government is yet to design a more holistic view of policy-making cycle and the use of design technology to better prepare information from citizens in each stage of the policy-making cycle.\n#'''Evaluation:''' There is a greater need now than ever before to figure out whether or not online engagement can help meet the citizen as well as the government's objectives.\n#'''Commitment:''' Is the government committed to analyze and use citizen's public input, and how can this process be validated more regularly?\n\n== Developed states and developing countries ==\nHighly developed states possess the capacity to link their respective governments with digital sites. Such sites function in ways such as publicising recent legislation, current and future policy objectives; lending agency toward political candidates; and/or allowing citizens to voice themselves in a political way. Likewise, the emergence of these sites has been linked to increased voting advocacy. Lack of access to technology can be a serious obstacle in becoming a digital citizen, since many elementary procedures such as tax report filing, birth registration, and use of websites to support candidates in political campaigns ([[e-democracy]]) have become available solely via the internet. Furthermore, many cultural and commercial entities only publicize information on web pages. Non-digital citizens will not be able to retrieve this information, and this may lead to [[social isolation]] or [[economic stagnation]].\n\nThe gap between digital citizens and non-digital citizens is often referred as the [[digital divide]]. In [[developing countries]], digital citizens are fewer. They consist of the people who use technology to overcome local obstacles including development issues, corruption, and even military conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/gear/2005-08-28-cell-banks-africa_x.htm|title=Africa's cell phone boom creates a base for low-cost banking|work=usatoday.com}}</ref> Examples of such citizens include users of [[Ushahidi]] during the [[2007\u201308 Kenyan crisis|2007 disputed Kenyan election]] and protesters in the [[Arab Spring]] movements who used media to document repression of protests. Currently, the digital divide is a subject of academic debate as access to the internet has increased in these developing countries, but the place in which it is accessed (work, home, public library, etc.) has a significant effect on how such access will be used, if even in a manner related to citizenry. Recent scholarship has correlated the desire to be technologically proficient with greater belief in computer access equity, and thus, digital citizenship (Shelley, et al.).\n\nOn the other side of the divide, one example of a highly-developed digital technology program in a wealthy state is the [[e-Residency of Estonia]]. This form of digital residency allows both citizens and non-citizens of the state to pursue business opportunities in a digital business environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://e-resident.gov.ee/become-an-e-resident/|title=e-Residency Benefits {{!}} Digital Nomad, Freelancer, Startup Company|website=e-Residency|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> The application is simple; residents can fill out a form with their passport and photograph alongside the reason for applying. Following a successful application, the \"e-residency\" will allow them to register a company, sign documents, make online banking declarations, and file medical prescriptions online, though they will be tracked through financial footprints. The project plans to cover over 10 million e-residents by 2025 and {{as of|2019|04|lc=y|post=,}} there were over 54,000 participants from over 162 countries that have expressed an interest, contributing millions of dollars to the country's economy and assisting in access to any public service online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninaangelovska/2019/04/25/estonias-e-residency-contributed-e14m-to-its-economy-e-residency-2-0-will-be-a-true-forerunner/|title=Estonia's E-Residency Contributed \u20ac14M To Its Economy--'E-Residency 2.0 Will Be A True Forerunner'|last=Angelovska|first=Nina|website=Forbes|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> Other benefits include hassle-free administration, lower business costs, access to the European Union market, and a broad range of e-services. Though the programme is designed for entrepreneurs, Estonia hopes to value transparency and resourcefulness as a cause for other companies to implement similar policies domestically.\n\nNonetheless, Estonia's e-Residency system has been subject to criticism. Many have pointed out that [[tax treaties]] within their own countries will play a major role in preventing this idea from spreading to more countries. Another risk is politically for governments to sustain \"funding and legislative priorities across different coalitions of power.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kotka|first=Taavi|date=September 2015|title=Estonian e-Residency: Redefining the Nation-State in the Digital Era|url=https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/materials/publications/14883/workingpaperno3kotkavargaskorjus.pdf|journal=Cyber Studies Programme}}</ref> Most importantly, the threat of [[cyberattack]]s may disrupt the seemingly optimal idea of having a platform for eIDs, as Estonia suffered its own massive cyberattack in 2007 by Russian [[hacktivism|hacktivists]]. Today, the protection of digital services and databases is essential to national security, and many countries are still hesitant to take the next step forward to promote a new system that will change the scale of politics with all its citizens.\n\n== Other forms of digital divide ==\nWithin developed countries, the digital divide, other than economic differences, is attributed to educational levels. A study conducted by the United States [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]] determined that the gap in computer usage and internet access widened 7.8% and 25% between those with the most and least education, and it has been observed that those with college degrees or higher are 10 times more likely to have internet access at work when compared with those with only a high school education.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bezuidenhout|first=Louise M.|last2=Leonelli|first2=Sabina|last3=Kelly|first3=Ann H.|last4=Rappert|first4=Brian|date=2017-08-01|title=Beyond the digital divide: Towards a situated approach to open data|journal=Science and Public Policy|volume=44|issue=4|pages=464\u2013475|doi=10.1093/scipol/scw036|issn=0302-3427}}</ref>\n\nA digital divide often extends along specific racial lines as well. The difference in computer usage grew by 39.2% between White and Black households and by 42.6% between White and Hispanic households only three years ago.{{when?|date=March 2020}} Race can also affect the number of computers at school, and as expected, gaps between racial groups narrow at higher income levels while widening among households at lower economic levels. [[Racial disparities in education|Racial disparities]] have been proven to exist irrespective of income, and in a cultural study to determine reasons for the divide other than income, in accordance to the Hispanic community, computers were seen as a luxury, not a need. Participants collectively stated that computer activities isolated individuals and took away valuable time from family activities. In the African-American community, it was observed that they historically have had negative encounters with technological innovations, and with Asian-Americans, education was emphasized, and thus, there was a larger number of people who embraced the rise in [[Innovation|technological advances.]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dijk|first=Jan|date=August 2017|title=Digital Divide Research, Achievements, and Shortcomings|journal=Poetics|pages=34}}</ref>\n\nAn educational divide also takes place as a result of differences in the use of daily technology. In a report analyzed by the [[ACT (test)|ACT]] Center for Equity in Learning, \"85% of respondents reported having access to anywhere from two to five devices at home. The remaining one percent of respondents reported having access to no devices at home.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Raeal|date=August 2018|title=The Digital Divide and Educational Equity|url=https://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/R1698-digital-divide-2018-08.pdf|journal=ACT Center for Equity in Learning}}</ref> For the 14% of respondents with one device at home, many of them reported the need to share these devices with other household members, facing challenges that are often overlooked. The data all suggests that wealthier families have access to more devices. In addition, out of the respondents that only used one device at home, 24% of them lived in rural areas, and over half reported that this one device was a smartphone; this could make completing schoolwork assignments more difficult. The ACT recommended that underserved students need access to more devices and higher-quality networks, and educators should do their best to ensure that students can find as many electronic materials through their phones to not place a burden on family plans. \n\n==Engagement of youth==\n[[File:Inclusion Convention.jpg|thumb|At the 2018 Institutional Convention, Shola Mos-Shogbamimu, founder of the Convention, discusses the role of digital media in preventing the spread of sexual harassment and what measures can be taken to stop the spread of negativity in youth.]]\nA recent survey revealed that teenagers and young adults spend more time on the internet than watching TV. This has raised a number of concerns about how internet use could impact cognitive abilities.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mills |first1=Kathryn |title=Possible Effects of Internet Use on Cognitive Development in Adolescence |journal=Media and Communication |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=4 |doi=10.17645/mac.v4i3.516 |year=2016}}</ref> According to a study by Wartella et al., teens are concerned about how digital technologies may have an impact on their health.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wartella |first1=Ellen |last2=Rideout |first2=Vicky |last3=Montague |first3=Heather |last4=Beaudoin-Ryan |first4=Leanne |last5=Lauricella |first5=Alexis |title=Teens, Health and Technology: A National Survey |journal=Media and Communication |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=13 |doi=10.17645/mac.v4i3.515 |year=2016}}</ref> Digital youth can generally be viewed as the test market for the next generation's digital content and services. Sites such as [[Myspace]] and [[Facebook]] have come to the fore in sites where youth participate and engage with others on the internet. However, due to the lack of popularity of MySpace in particular, more young people are turning to websites such as [[Snapchat]], [[Instagram]], and [[YouTube]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/03/health/teens-tweens-media-screen-use-report/|title=Teens spend 9 hours a day using media, report says |first=Kelly |last=Wallace|work=CNN|access-date=2018-02-03}}</ref> It was reported that teenagers spend up to nine hours a day online, with the vast majority of that time spent on social media websites from mobile devices, contributing to the ease of access and availability to young people.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.socialmediatoday.com/marketing/how-much-time-do-people-spend-social-media-infographic|title=How Much Time Do People Spend on Social Media? [Infographic]|work=Social Media Today|access-date=2018-02-03}}</ref> Vast amounts of money are spent annually to research the demographic by hiring psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists in order to discover habits, values and fields of interest.\n\nParticularly in the United States, \"Social media use has become so pervasive in the lives of American teens that having a presence on a social network is almost synonymous with being online; 95% of all teens ages 12-17 are now online and 80% of those online teens are users of social media sites\".<ref>\"[http://www.pewinternet.org/2011/11/09/teens-kindness-and-cruelty-on-social-network-sites/ How American Teens Navigate the New World of 'digital Citizenship']\". Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project. Web. 23 Nov. 2011.</ref>{{Update inline|date=March 2020}} However, movements such as these appear to benefit strictly those wishing to advocate for their business towards youth. The critical time when young people are developing their civic identities is between the ages 15\u201322. During this time they develop three attributes, civic literacy, civic skills and civic attachment, that constitute civic engagement later reflected in political actions of their adult lives.\n\nFor youth to fully participate and realize their presence on the internet, a quality level of reading comprehension is required. \"The average government web site, for example, requires an eleventh-grade level of reading comprehension, even though about half of the U.S. population reads at an eighth-grade level or lower\".<ref name=\"mossberger-digital-citizenship\">{{cite book|title=Digital Citizenship - The Internet, Society & Participation|last1=Mossberger|first1=Karen|last2=Tolbert|first2=Caroline J.|last3=McNeal|first3=Ramona S. |author-link2=Caroline Tolbert|date=October 2007|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=978-0262633536}}</ref> So despite the internet being a place irrespective of certain factors such as race, religion, and class, education plays a large part in a person's capacity to present themselves online in a formal manner conducive towards their citizenry. Concurrently, education also affects people's motivation to participate online.\n\nStudents should be encouraged to utilize technology with responsibility and ethical digital citizenship promoted. Education on harmful viruses and other [[malware]] must be emphasized to protect resources. A student can be a successful digital citizen with the help of educators, parents, and school counselors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.educationworld.com/a_tech/responsible-student-technology-use.shtml|title=Help Kids Become Responsible Digital Citizens|publisher=educationworld.com}}</ref>\n\n==Limits on the use of data==\nInternational [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] guidelines state that \"personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which they are to be used, and to the extent necessary for those purposes should be accurate, complete, and kept up to date\". Article 8 prevents subjects to certain exceptions. Meaning that certain things cannot be published online revealing race, ethnicity, religion, political stance, health, and sex life. in the United States, this is enforced generally by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC)- but very generally. For example, the FTC brought an action against Microsoft for failing to properly protect customers' personal information.<ref>[http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/dsolove/Digital-Person/text/Digital-Person-CH1.pdf ''The Digital Person - Technology and Privacy in the Information Age'' - Chapter 1]</ref> In addition, many have described the United States as being in a [[cyberwarfare|cyberwar]] with Russia, and several Americans have credited Russia to their country's downfall in transparency and declining trust in the government. With several foreign users posting anonymous information through social media in order to gather a following, it is difficult to understand whom to target and what affiliation or root cause they may have of performing a particular action aimed to sway public opinion.\n\nThe FTC does play a significant role in protecting the digital citizen. However, individuals' public records are increasingly useful to the government and highly sought after. This material can help the government detect a variety of crimes such as fraud, drug distribution rings, terrorist cells. it makes it easier to properly profile a suspected criminal and keep an eye on them. Although there are a variety of ways to gather information on an individual through credit card history, employment history, and more, the internet is becoming the most desirable information gatherer thanks to its fa\u00e7ade of security and the amount of information that can be stored on the internet. [[Internet anonymity|Anonymity]] has proven to be very rare online as [[Internet service provider|ISP]]s can keep track of an individual's activity online.<ref>[http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/dsolove/Digital-Person/text/Digital-Person-CH9.pdf ''The Digital Person - Technology and Privacy in the Information Age'' - Chapter 9]</ref> Furthermore, an open internet as delegated by a state's government is necessary to instill a sense of trust, legitimacy, and participation in the state's citizenry. [[WikiLeaks]] represents an occurrence where particular political actors have criticized and taken citizen action toward revealing the government's unnecessary clandestine activity online. As stated by the a representative from the ''World Heritage Encyclopedia'', \"The benefit of transparency isn't just catching red-handed bastards. It's also about collaborating and coming together with a more engaged citizenry,\" and many critics have stated that the process in doing so will still take several years.\n\n==Three principles of digital citizenship==\nDigital citizenship is a term used to define the appropriate and responsible use of technology among users. Three principles were developed by Mark Ribble to teach digital users how to responsibly use technology to become a digital citizen: respect, educate, and protect.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.iste.org/explore/articleDetail?articleid=535|title=Digital citizenship is more important than ever|access-date=2018-10-22}}</ref> Each principle contains three of the nine elements of digital citizenship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalcitizenship.net/nine-elements.html|title=Nine Elements|website=Digital Citizenship|access-date=2018-10-22}}</ref>\n# '''Respect:''' the elements of etiquette, access, and law are used to respect other digital users.\n# '''Educate:''' the elements of literacy, communication, and commerce are used to learn about the appropriate use of the digital world.\n# '''Protect:''' the elements of rights and responsibilities, security, and health and wellness are used to remain safe in the digital and non-digital world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iste.org/explore/Lead-the-way/Digital-citizenship-is-more-important-than-ever?articleid=535|title=Digital citizenship is more important than ever {{!}} ISTE|website=www.iste.org|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\nWithin these three core principles, there are nine elements to also be considered in regards to digital citizenship. According to digitalcitizenship.net, these nine theme include:<ref>[http://www.digitalcitizenship.net/nine-elements.html Nine Themes of Digital Citizenship], digitalcitizenship.net</ref>\n\n#'''Digital access''': This is perhaps one of the most fundamental blocks to being a digital citizen. However, due to socioeconomic status, location, and other disabilities, some individuals may not have digital access. Recently, schools have been becoming more connected with the internet, often offering computers, and other forms of access. This can be offered through kiosks, community centers, and open labs. This most often is associated with the digital divide and factors associated with such. Digital access is available in many remote countries via cyber caf\u00e9s and small coffee shops.<ref>[http://www.iste.org/docs/excerpts/DIGCI2-excerpt.pdf Digital Citizenship in Schools - Excerpt]</ref>\n#'''[[Digital commerce]]''': This is the ability for users to recognize that much of the economy is regulated online. It also deals with the understanding of the dangers and benefits of online buying, using credit cards online, and so forth. As with the advantages and legal activities- there is also dangerous activities such as illegal downloads, gambling, drug deals, pornography, plagiarism, and so forth.\n#'''Digital communication''': This element deals with understanding the variety of online communication mediums such as email, instant messaging, Facebook messenger, the variety of apps, and so forth. There is a standard of etiquette associated with each medium.\n#'''[[Digital literacy]]''': This deals with the understanding of how to use various digital devices. For example, how to properly search for something on a search engine versus a database. How to use various online logs. Oftentimes many educational institutions will help form an individual's digital literacy.\n#'''[[Etiquette in technology|Digital etiquette]]''': As discussed in the third element, digital communication, this is the expectation that various mediums require a variety of etiquette. Certain mediums demand more appropriate behavior and language than others.\n#'''Digital law''': This is where enforcement occurs for illegal downloads, plagiarizing, hacking, creating viruses, sending spam, identity theft, [[cyberbullying]], and so forth.\n#'''Digital rights and responsibilities''': This is the set of rights digital citizens have such as privacy and free speech.\n#'''Digital health''': Digital citizens must be aware of the physical stress placed on their bodies by internet usage. They must be aware to not become overly dependent on the internet causing problems such as eye strain, headaches, and stress.\n#'''Digital security''': This simply means that citizens must take measures to be safe by practicing using secure passwords, virus protection, backing up data, and so forth.\n\n== Digital citizenship in education ==\nAccording to Mike Ribble, an author who has worked on the topic of digital citizenship for more than a decade, digital access is the first element that is prevalent in today's educational curriculum. He cited a widening gap between the impoverished and the wealthy, as 41% of African Americans and Hispanics use computers in the home when compared to 77% of white students.

A problem with digital technology that still exists is that over 35% of students were observed to not possess the proper skills to critically evaluate information online, and these issues and statistics increased as the grade levels rose. Online videos such as those found on YouTube and Netflix have been used approximately by 60% of the K-12 teachers in classrooms, while educational tools such as Microsoft Office and Google G Suite have been used by around half of the teachers. Social media was used the least, at around 13% in comparison to other digital methods of education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/uploads/research/2019-educator-census-inside-the-21st-century-classroom_1.pdf|title=The Common Sense Census: Inside the 21st-Century Classroom |last1=Vega |first1=Vanessa |first2=Michael B. |last2=Robb |date=2019 |website=Common Sense Media |url-status=live}}</ref> When analyzing the social class differences between schools, it was found that Title I schools were more likely to utilize digital citizenship curricula than teachers in more affluent schools.\n\nIn the past two years, there has been a major shift to move students from digital citizenship to digital leadership in order to make a greater impact on online interactions.

Students from [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School]] specifically rallied against gun violence, engaging in live tweeting, texting, videoing, and recording the attack as it happened, utilizing onside digital tools to not only witness what was happening at the time but to allow the world to witness it as well.

Farming households lower their food costs substantially and can generate income by selling excess produce, which is significant, as urban poor commonly spend 50-70% of their income on food.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  In addition to farming jobs, peri-urban agriculture can spark a need for traders, input suppliers, processors, marketers, and others. Peri-urban agriculture gives women and other non-heads of household a low-barrier occupation through which to support their families, adding to household productivity and giving women an outlet to assert themselves.<ref name=\"URBAN AND PERI-URBAN AGRICULTURE\"/>\n\nProducing food in areas nearby to cities shortens supply chains, which aids quality and cost. The proximity of peri-urban farms to urban areas incurs cost savings compared to those in rural areas, as farms are still able to take advantage of [[economies of scale]], to an extent, and require less transportation infrastructure to bring food in from city outskirts.<ref name=\"link.springer.com\"/> Perishable products are more easily preserved. Peri-urban farms are also able to flexibly respond and market themselves to urban consumer demands, since they are able to be closer and more specialized, and are tightly linked to the urban economy.<ref name=\"tandfonline.com\"/>\n\n==Challenges==\n\nChallenges for peri-urban agriculture, like its benefits, arise from its proximity to densely built urban areas. Competition for resources with other urban sectors, aspects of agriculture that may be unpleasant for city dwellers, and quality of inputs must all be monitored.\n\nWise resource allocation is a quintessential struggle for agriculture, and is especially greater for peri-urban agriculture than rural agriculture due to its proximity to greater numbers of people and to existing stresses on the urban environment. Peri-urban agriculture uses land, water, labor, and energy that might be used by other urban economic sectors.<ref name=\"tandfonline.com\"/>\n\n===Outputs===\n\nPeri-urban agriculture produces some aspects that may be unpleasant for urban residents, including smells, noises, [[pollution]], and [[disease]].\n\nManagement of animal waste can be challenging, since [[manure]] may contain chemicals and heavy metals unsuitable for use as [[fertilizer]] \u2013 and may even be hazardous.

Historically, rural and urban land have been viewed as two separate [[economic systems]] with few interactions. Often, these arguments refer to the disappearance and [[urbanization]] of rural land. Peri-urban land falls along the continuum of urban to rural land and recognizes links between the two.<ref name=\"tandfonline.com\">[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3846/20294913.2014.871661#.VmH24HarTIU \"Rethinking of the relationship between agriculture and the \u201curban\u201d economy in Beijing: an input-output approach\"] Technological and Economic Development of Economy, 2014</ref>\n\n==Implementation==\n\nUrban and peri-urban agriculture is expected to become increasingly important for [[food security]] and [[nutrition]] as rural land is built up.

Farming households lower their food costs substantially and can generate income by selling excess produce, which is significant, as urban poor commonly spend 50-70% of their income on food.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  In addition to farming jobs, peri-urban agriculture can spark a need for traders, input suppliers, processors, marketers, and others. Peri-urban agriculture gives women and other non-heads of household a low-barrier occupation through which to support their families, adding to household productivity and giving women an outlet to assert themselves.<ref name=\"URBAN AND PERI-URBAN AGRICULTURE\"/>\n\nProducing food in areas nearby to cities shortens supply chains, which aids quality and cost. The proximity of peri-urban farms to urban areas incurs cost savings compared to those in rural areas, as farms are still able to take advantage of [[economies of scale]], to an extent, and require less transportation infrastructure to bring food in from city outskirts.<ref name=\"link.springer.com\"/> Perishable products are more easily preserved. Peri-urban farms are also able to flexibly respond and market themselves to urban consumer demands, since they are able to be closer and more specialized, and are tightly linked to the urban economy.<ref name=\"tandfonline.com\"/>\n\n==Challenges==\n\nChallenges for peri-urban agriculture, like its benefits, arise from its proximity to densely built urban areas. Competition for resources with other urban sectors, aspects of agriculture that may be unpleasant for city dwellers, and quality of inputs must all be monitored.\n\nWise resource allocation is a quintessential struggle for agriculture, and is especially greater for peri-urban agriculture than rural agriculture due to its proximity to greater numbers of people and to existing stresses on the urban environment. Peri-urban agriculture uses land, water, labor, and energy that might be used by other urban economic sectors.<ref name=\"tandfonline.com\"/>\n\n===Outputs===\n\nPeri-urban agriculture produces some aspects that may be unpleasant for urban residents, including smells, noises, [[pollution]], and [[disease]].\n\nManagement of animal waste can be challenging, since [[manure]] may contain chemicals and heavy metals unsuitable for use as [[fertilizer]] \u2013 and may even be hazardous.
