The Hall then opened a new Vancouver 2010 Gallery with the world's largest and broadest collection of 2010 Olympic and Paralympic artifacts, as well as a new Hall of Champions, the Hall's signature gallery.\n\nIn 2017 a replica of the news desk from the ''Sports Page'' television show was put on display in commemoration of its 40th anniversary.<ref>[http://www.news1130.com/2017/11/12/sports-page-set-bc-sports-hall-fame-exhibit/ \"Sports Page set for BC Sports Hall of Fame exhibit\"].

Once inducted, these individuals become known as Honoured Members and the teams are known as Honoured Teams of the BC Sports Hall of Fame.  The five major induction categories, each with its own set of criteria, are Athlete, Builder, Pioneer, Media and Team.<ref>[https://bc.ctvnews.ca/bc-sports-hall-of-fame-and-museum-to-induct-8-individuals-and-2-teams-1.348132 \"BC Sports Hall of Fame and Museum to Induct 8 Individuals and 2 Teams\"].

A member of the  board of trustees who submits a nomination may not vote on that nomination if and when it is brought to the board of trustees for approval.\n\nEach year nominations are accepted until October 1. All nominations are considered at an initial meeting at the beginning of November. The final selection process takes place in the middle of November and the names are released to the media in December.\n\nEach nomination is eligible for three consecutive years.

{"title_page": "Power Five conferences", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date = October 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn [[college football]], the term '''Power Five conferences''' refers to five [[athletic conference]]s whose members are part of the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) of [[NCAA Division I]], the highest level of collegiate football in the [[United States]]. The conferences are the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC), [[Big Ten Conference]], [[Big 12 Conference]], [[Pac-12 Conference]], and [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). The term \"Power Five\" is not defined by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), and the origin of the term is unknown. It has been used in its current meaning since at least 2006.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29339532/bcs_race_already_is_getting_ugly/ |title=BCS race already is getting ugly |first=John |last=Lindsey |agency=[[Scripps Howard News Service]] |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |page=F-2 |date=November 1, 2006 |accessdate=March 9, 2019 |via=newspapers.com}}</ref> The term is also occasionally used in other college sports, although in many non-football sports, most notably basketball, anywhere from six to eight conferences may be considered \"high-major\".\n\nThe Power Five conferences make up five of the ten conferences in FBS; the other FBS conferences are informally known as the [[Group of Five conferences|Group of Five]] ([[American Athletic Conference]] (the American or AAC), [[Conference USA]], [[Mid-American Conference]] (MAC), [[Mountain West Conference]], and the [[Sun Belt Conference]]).<ref name=BMcMurphy>{{cite news|last1=McMurphy|first1=Brett|title=Power Five coaches polled on games|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/11320309/majority-power-five-coaches-want-power-five-only-schedules|accessdate=December 9, 2014|publisher=ESPN|date=August 7, 2014}}</ref> The [[List of NCAA Division I FBS football programs|FBS consists of]] the Power Five, the Group of Five, and a small number of [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent]] schools (among those schools long-time independents [[Army Black Knights football|Army]], [[BYU Cougars football|Brigham Young University (BYU)]], and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]], along with other schools that typically stay independent for a few years before moving to a conference). Prior to the establishment of the [[College Football Playoff]] in 2014, the Power Five conferences, as well as the [[Big East Conference (1979-2013)|old Big East Conference]], were called Automatic Qualifying (AQ) conferences, because the champion of each conference received an automatic berth in one of the five [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS) [[bowl game]]s. The final college football season for which the BCS was in effect was the [[2013 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2013 season]]. With [[2010\u201313 Big East Conference realignment#Catholic 7|the split of the old Big East in 2013]], there are now five power conferences.\n\nThe conferences that comprise the Power Five are designated by the NCAA, individually by name, as \"autonomy conferences\". Section 5.3.2.1 of the NCAA Constitution grants such conferences autonomy \"to permit the use of resources to advance the legitimate educational or athletics-related needs of student-athletes and for legislative changes that will otherwise enhance student-athlete well-being\". Eleven areas of autonomy are listed, including promotional activities unrelated to athletics participation, pre-enrollment expenses and support, and financial aid.<ref name=bylaw>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D118.pdf |title=5.3.2.1 Process for Areas of Autonomy |work=2017\u201318 NCAA Division I Manual |page=33 |date=August 1, 2017 |accessdate=March 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Current conferences and teams==\nThe ten current FBS conferences are listed below.

However, five of the six former AQ conferences are now known as the \"Power Five conferences\": the [[Big Ten Conference]], the [[Big 12 Conference]], the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC), the [[Pac-12 Conference]], and the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). The sixth AQ conference, the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]], was split up during the [[2010\u20132014 NCAA conference realignment]], with five members joining P5 conferences, Notre Dame establishing a relationship with the ACC, the remaining non-football members forming the new [[Big East Conference]], and the remaining members forming the [[American Athletic Conference]]. It is unknown where the term \"Power Five Conference\" originated from; it is not officially documented anywhere by the NCAA.\n\nThe American, as well as [[Conference USA]] (C-USA), the [[Mid-American Conference]] (MAC), the [[Mountain West Conference]] (MW), and the [[Sun Belt Conference]] are known as the \"Group of Five\" (sometimes called the G5).\n\nThe FBS also has seven [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent schools]] as of the upcoming 2020 season: Notre Dame, Army, BYU, Liberty, New Mexico State, UConn, and UMass. Notre Dame is currently considered equal to the Power Five schools, being a full (with the exception of football) member of the ACC with an annual five-game football scheduling agreement with that conference; Notre Dame also has [[Notre Dame Football on NBC|its own national television contract]] and its own arrangement for access to the CFP-affiliated bowl games should it meet stated competitive criteria. All Power Five leagues that require their members to schedule at least one Power Five team in nonconference play (currently the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, SEC, and Pac-12) consider Notre Dame to be a Power Five opponent for such purposes. The ACC, Big Ten, and SEC also count BYU as a Power Five opponent for scheduling purposes, and the Big Ten and SEC count Army as well.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/12247690/acc-count-games-byu-cougars-nonleague-power-5-opponent |title=ACC: BYU to count as Power 5 team |first=Brett |last=McMurphy |website=ESPN.com |date=January 29, 2015 |accessdate=February 3, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"fornelli\">{{cite news|last1=Fornelli|first1=Tom|title=SEC will consider Notre Dame, BYU, and Army as Power Five opponents|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/eye-on-college-football/25114107/sec-to-consider-notre-dame-byu-and-army-as-power-five-opponents|accessdate=September 17, 2016|publisher=CBS|date=March 19, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"bmcmurphy\">{{cite news|last1=McMurphy|first1=Brett|title=Independents BYU, Army, Notre Dame can fulfill Power 5 quota for Big Ten|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/13716412/big-ten-approves-byu-army-notre-dame-nonconference-quota|accessdate=September 17, 2016|publisher=ESPN|date=September 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nTeams from the Power Five and the Group of Five play each other during the season, and sometimes also play against FCS teams.

The first realignment occurred in the 1990s, and resulted in the demise of the Southwest Conference, which was a member of the Bowl Coalition and at times considered equal to some of the Power Five conferences; as well as many schools giving up independent status to join conferences.  In the early 1990s, [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] left the Southwest Conference for the SEC; the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|original Big East Conference]] began sponsoring football, with eight former [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|football independents]] joining either for all sports or football only; and other major independents such as [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] (to the ACC), [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] (to the Big Ten), and [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina]] (to the SEC) joined major conferences. In the [[1996 NCAA conference realignment]], the SWC dissolved, and four Texas teams from that conference joined with the [[Big Eight Conference|Big 8]] schools to form the [[Big 12 Conference]]. \n\nDuring another [[2005 NCAA conference realignment|phase of realignment in 2005]], three schools ([[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]], [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami-FL]] and [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]]) jumped from the Big East to the ACC, and [[Temple Owls football|Temple]] also left the conference (before eventually returning in 2013).  The Big East responded by adding former basketball-only member Connecticut and three schools from C-USA.<ref name=MBostock>{{cite news|last1=Bostock|first1=Mike|title=Tracing the History of N.C.A.A. Conferences|url=https://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/11/30/football-conferences/|accessdate=December 9, 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=November 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\nCollege football underwent another [[2010\u20132014 NCAA conference realignment|major conference realignment]] from 2010 to 2014, as the Big Ten and Pac-10 sought to become large enough to stage championship games. Members of the original Big East left the conference to join the Big 12, Big Ten, and ACC. The Big 12 lost members to the SEC, the Pac-12, and the Big Ten, while the Big Ten also gained one former ACC member. The remaining members of the Big East [[2010\u201313 Big East Conference realignment#Catholic 7|split into two conferences]]: the [[American Athletic Conference]] (the American) and a new [[Big East Conference]] that does not sponsor football (only three of its 10 members sponsor football, all at the second-tier [[NCAA Division I#Football Championship Subdivision|Division I FCS]] level). The American, the football successor to the Big East, is no longer considered a power conference. Despite the major conference realignment from 2010 to 2014, relatively few schools dropped out of or joined the ranks of the power conferences. Two of the three non-AQ schools that had appeared in multiple BCS bowls [[2010\u201313 Mountain West Conference realignment|left the Mountain West Conference]] and joined a power conference, as [[Utah Utes football|Utah]] joined the Pac-12 and [[TCU Horned Frogs football|TCU]] joined the Big 12. Former Big East members [[UConn Huskies football|UConn]], Temple, [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]], and [[South Florida Bulls football|South Florida]] are all now part of The American; of those, only Temple was a founding member of the Big East in football.<ref name=MBostock/>\n\nAt present, six of the nine former members of the Southwest Conference are in Power Five conferences: Arkansas and [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]] are members of the SEC, while TCU, [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor]], [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas]], and [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech]] are members of the Big 12. [[Houston Cougars football|Houston]] and [[SMU Mustangs football|SMU]] are members of the American, while [[Rice Owls football|Rice]] is a member of Conference USA.\n\n==Under the BCS system==\nFrom 1998 to 2013, the top teams in Division I FBS played in the BCS. It consisted of four or five bowl games, with a [[BCS National Championship Game|national championship game]] either rotating among the bowl sites (prior to the 2006 season) or played as a separate game. The BCS succeeded two other systems that were put in place after the [[1991 NCAA Division I-A football season|1991 season]] in order to ensure that one [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national champion]] could be crowned at the end of the season. The original [[Bowl Coalition]] consisted of the SEC, the [[Big Eight Conference]] (later succeeded by the Big 12), the [[Southwest Conference]] (SWC), the ACC, the Big East, and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]]. The BCS added the Pac-10 (now known as the Pac-12) and the Big Ten, while the SWC dissolved in 1996. In 2013, the Big East split into two conferences, and its successor, the [[American Athletic Conference]] (The American), took the Big East's place for the 2013 season.\n\nIn addition to creating a national championship game, the BCS also created a set format for other major bowls. After the two top teams in the BCS rankings were matched up in the [[BCS National Championship Game]], the other three or (after the 2005 season) four bowls selected other top teams. The term \"BCS conference\" was used by many fans to refer to one of the six conferences whose champions received an automatic berth in one of the five BCS bowl games, although the BCS itself used the term \"automatic qualifying conference\" (AQ conference).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/faq |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 8, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228101556/http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/faq |archivedate=December 28, 2009 }}</ref> While the number of AQ conferences was technically variable,<ref>{{cite web |title=AQ conferences could grow by 1 in 2012 |work= Bowl Championship Series |date=April 22, 2010 |url= http://www.bcsfootball.org/news/story?id=5126859 }}</ref> the BCS always had six AQ conferences since its inception in 1998.

A sixth team, [[Johns Hopkins Blue Jays men's lacrosse|Johns Hopkins]], is a [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] member, but plays both men's and women's lacrosse in Division I and the Big Ten. It is also one of five D-III schools specifically allowed by the NCAA to offer scholarships in its Division I sports.\n* '''Pac-12''': Utah became the first Pac-12 school, and also the first Division I school west of the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]], to sponsor men's lacrosse as a varsity sport, launching its team in the 2018\u201319 school year (2019 season). The school has yet to announce a conference affiliation in that sport.\n\n'''Wrestling''':\n* '''Big 12''':  Four of the 10 full members sponsor wrestling.

Before 2012, this championship was also open to Division III schools, but explosive growth in the sport at that level in the 21st century led to the creation of a separate [[NCAA Division III Men's Volleyball Tournament|D-III championship]]. The only D-I all-sports league to sponsor the sport is the mid-major [[Big West Conference]]. With that in mind, the five Power Five schools with men's volleyball programs are aligned as follows:\n* '''Big Ten''': Ohio State and Penn State both play in single-sport leagues, respectively in the [[Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association]] and [[Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association]].\n* '''Pac-12''': All three members with men's volleyball programs\u2014Stanford, UCLA, and USC\u2014compete in the [[Mountain Pacific Sports Federation]] (MPSF).\n\n'''Men's Water Polo''': Only 25 Division I members sponsor varsity men's water polo.

All compete in the MPSF.\n\n'''Beach Volleyball''':\nA women-only sport at the NCAA level, beach volleyball is sponsored by only one Power Five conference, namely the Pac-12. Nine of that conference's schools sponsor the sport (with the exceptions being Colorado, Oregon State, and Washington State). Other Power Five schools that sponsor the sport are aligned as follows:\n* '''ACC''': [[Florida State Seminoles beach volleyball|Florida State]] competes in the [[Coastal Collegiate Sports Association]] (CCSA), a league that only sponsors beach volleyball plus men's and women's swimming & diving.\n* '''Big Ten''':  Nebraska competes as an independent.\n* '''Big 12''':  TCU launched a new varsity beach volleyball program for the 2018\u201319 school year (2019 season), which competes in the CCSA.\n* '''SEC''': [[LSU Tigers women's beach volleyball|LSU]] and South Carolina compete in the CCSA. Mississippi State has been approved by the NCAA to compete, but has yet to do so.\n\n'''Women's Field Hockey''':\n* '''Pac-12''': The two Pac-12 members that sponsor field hockey, California and Stanford, play in the [[America East Conference]].\n\n'''Women's Ice Hockey''':\n* '''ACC''': [[Boston College Eagles women's ice hockey|Boston College]] plays alongside its men's team in Hockey East. [[Syracuse Orange women's ice hockey|Syracuse]] plays in [[College Hockey America]] (CHA), a league that sponsors only women's ice hockey.\n* '''Big Ten''': Four Big Ten members sponsor women's ice hockey.

Both compete in the [[American Athletic Conference]].\n\n'''Women's Rowing''':\n* '''Big 12''':  Five of the 10 full members sponsor women's rowing. They are joined by Alabama and Tennessee, the only two SEC schools to sponsor the sport. These schools are listed in italics as part of the SEC.\n* '''SEC''': See Big 12 above.\n\n'''Women's Water Polo''': Only 33 Division I members sponsor varsity women's water polo. As with men's water polo, a large majority of the D-I schools that sponsor the sport are mid-major programs. The NCAA conducts a single national championship open to all member schools, regardless of division.\n* '''Big Ten''': The only two Big Ten schools that sponsor the sport, Indiana and Michigan, respectively compete in the MPSF and the varsity division of the [[Collegiate Water Polo Association]].\n* '''Pac-12''': Five Pac-12 schools\u2014the four California members, plus Arizona State\u2014compete in the MPSF.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|College football}}\n*[[Superconference]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n{{College Football Playoff navbox}}\n{{Bowl Championship Series navbox}}\n\n[[Category:NCAA Division I FBS football by conference| ]]\n[[Category:Bowl Championship Series]]\n[[Category:College Football Playoff]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date = October 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn [[college football]], the term '''Power Five conferences''' refers to five [[athletic conference]]s whose members are part of the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) of [[NCAA Division I]], the highest level of collegiate football in the [[United States]]. The conferences are the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC), [[Big Ten Conference]], [[Big 12 Conference]], [[Pac-12 Conference]], and [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). The term \"Power Five\" is not defined by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), and the origin of the term is unknown. It has been used in its current meaning since at least 2006.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29339532/bcs_race_already_is_getting_ugly/ |title=BCS race already is getting ugly |first=John |last=Lindsey |agency=[[Scripps Howard News Service]] |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |page=F-2 |date=November 1, 2006 |accessdate=March 9, 2019 |via=newspapers.com}}</ref> The term is also occasionally used in other college sports, although in many non-football sports, most notably basketball, anywhere from six to eight conferences may be considered \"high-major\".\n\nThe Power Five conferences make up five of the ten conferences in FBS; the other FBS conferences are informally known as the [[Group of Five conferences|Group of Five]] ([[American Athletic Conference]] (the American or AAC), [[Conference USA]], [[Mid-American Conference]] (MAC), [[Mountain West Conference]], and the [[Sun Belt Conference]]).<ref name=BMcMurphy>{{cite news|last1=McMurphy|first1=Brett|title=Power Five coaches polled on games|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/11320309/majority-power-five-coaches-want-power-five-only-schedules|accessdate=December 9, 2014|publisher=ESPN|date=August 7, 2014}}</ref> The [[List of NCAA Division I FBS football programs|FBS consists of]] the Power Five, the Group of Five, and a small number of [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent]] schools (among those schools long-time independents [[Army Black Knights football|Army]], [[BYU Cougars football|Brigham Young University (BYU)]], and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]], along with other schools that typically stay independent for a few years before moving to a conference). Prior to the establishment of the [[College Football Playoff]] in 2014, the Power Five conferences, as well as the [[Big East Conference (1979-2013)|old Big East Conference]], were called Automatic Qualifying (AQ) conferences, because the champion of each conference received an automatic berth in one of the five [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS) [[bowl game]]s. The final college football season for which the BCS was in effect was the [[2013 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2013 season]]. With [[2010\u201313 Big East Conference realignment#Catholic 7|the split of the old Big East in 2013]], there are now five power conferences.\n\nThe conferences that comprise the Power Five are designated by the NCAA, individually by name, as \"autonomy conferences\". Section 5.3.2.1 of the NCAA Constitution grants such conferences autonomy \"to permit the use of resources to advance the legitimate educational or athletics-related needs of student-athletes and for legislative changes that will otherwise enhance student-athlete well-being\". Eleven areas of autonomy are listed, including promotional activities unrelated to athletics participation, pre-enrollment expenses and support, and financial aid.<ref name=bylaw>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D118.pdf |title=5.3.2.1 Process for Areas of Autonomy |work=2017\u201318 NCAA Division I Manual |page=33 |date=August 1, 2017 |accessdate=March 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Current conferences and teams==\nThe ten current FBS conferences are listed below.

However, five of the six former AQ conferences are now known as the \"Power Five conferences\": the [[Big Ten Conference]], the [[Big 12 Conference]], the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC), the [[Pac-12 Conference]], and the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). The sixth AQ conference, the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]], was split up during the [[2010\u20132014 NCAA conference realignment]], with five members joining P5 conferences, Notre Dame establishing a relationship with the ACC, the remaining non-football members forming the new [[Big East Conference]], and the remaining members forming the [[American Athletic Conference]]. It is unknown where the term \"Power Five Conference\" originated from; it is not officially documented anywhere by the NCAA.\n\nThe American, as well as [[Conference USA]] (C-USA), the [[Mid-American Conference]] (MAC), the [[Mountain West Conference]] (MW), and the [[Sun Belt Conference]] are known as the \"Group of Five\" (sometimes called the G5).\n\nThe FBS also has seven [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent schools]] as of the upcoming 2020 season: Notre Dame, Army, BYU, Liberty, New Mexico State, UConn, and UMass. Notre Dame is currently considered equal to the Power Five schools, being a full (with the exception of football) member of the ACC with an annual five-game football scheduling agreement with that conference; Notre Dame also has [[Notre Dame Football on NBC|its own national television contract]] and its own arrangement for access to the CFP-affiliated bowl games should it meet stated competitive criteria. All Power Five leagues that require their members to schedule at least one Power Five team in nonconference play (currently the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, SEC, and Pac-12) consider Notre Dame to be a Power Five opponent for such purposes. The ACC, Big Ten, and SEC also count BYU as a Power Five opponent for scheduling purposes, and the Big Ten and SEC count Army as well.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/12247690/acc-count-games-byu-cougars-nonleague-power-5-opponent |title=ACC: BYU to count as Power 5 team |first=Brett |last=McMurphy |website=ESPN.com |date=January 29, 2015 |accessdate=February 3, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"fornelli\">{{cite news|last1=Fornelli|first1=Tom|title=SEC will consider Notre Dame, BYU, and Army as Power Five opponents|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/eye-on-college-football/25114107/sec-to-consider-notre-dame-byu-and-army-as-power-five-opponents|accessdate=September 17, 2016|publisher=CBS|date=March 19, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"bmcmurphy\">{{cite news|last1=McMurphy|first1=Brett|title=Independents BYU, Army, Notre Dame can fulfill Power 5 quota for Big Ten|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/13716412/big-ten-approves-byu-army-notre-dame-nonconference-quota|accessdate=September 17, 2016|publisher=ESPN|date=September 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nTeams from the Power Five and the Group of Five play each other during the season, and sometimes also play against FCS teams.

The first realignment occurred in the 1990s, and resulted in the demise of the Southwest Conference, which was a member of the Bowl Coalition and at times considered equal to some of the Power Five conferences; as well as many schools giving up independent status to join conferences.  In the early 1990s, [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] left the Southwest Conference for the SEC; the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|original Big East Conference]] began sponsoring football, with eight former [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|football independents]] joining either for all sports or football only; and other major independents such as [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] (to the ACC), [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] (to the Big Ten), and [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina]] (to the SEC) joined major conferences. In the [[1996 NCAA conference realignment]], the SWC dissolved, and four Texas teams from that conference joined with the [[Big Eight Conference|Big 8]] schools to form the [[Big 12 Conference]]. \n\nDuring another [[2005 NCAA conference realignment|phase of realignment in 2005]], three schools ([[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]], [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami-FL]] and [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]]) jumped from the Big East to the ACC, and [[Temple Owls football|Temple]] also left the conference (before eventually returning in 2013).  The Big East responded by adding former basketball-only member Connecticut and three schools from C-USA.<ref name=MBostock>{{cite news|last1=Bostock|first1=Mike|title=Tracing the History of N.C.A.A.

Members of the original Big East left the conference to join the Big 12, Big Ten, and ACC. The Big 12 lost members to the SEC, the Pac-12, and the Big Ten, while the Big Ten also gained one former ACC member. The remaining members of the Big East [[2010\u201313 Big East Conference realignment#Catholic 7|split into two conferences]]: the [[American Athletic Conference]] (the American) and a new [[Big East Conference]] that does not sponsor football (only three of its 10 members sponsor football, all at the second-tier [[NCAA Division I#Football Championship Subdivision|Division I FCS]] level). The American, the football successor to the Big East, is no longer considered a power conference. Despite the major conference realignment from 2010 to 2014, relatively few schools dropped out of or joined the ranks of the power conferences. Two of the three non-AQ schools that had appeared in multiple BCS bowls [[2010\u201313 Mountain West Conference realignment|left the Mountain West Conference]] and joined a power conference, as [[Utah Utes football|Utah]] joined the Pac-12 and [[TCU Horned Frogs football|TCU]] joined the Big 12. Former Big East members [[UConn Huskies football|UConn]], Temple, [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]], and [[South Florida Bulls football|South Florida]] are all now part of The American; of those, only Temple was a founding member of the Big East in football.<ref name=MBostock/>\n\nAt present, six of the nine former members of the Southwest Conference are in Power Five conferences: Arkansas and [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]] are members of the SEC, while TCU, [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor]], [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas]], and [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech]] are members of the Big 12. [[Houston Cougars football|Houston]] and [[SMU Mustangs football|SMU]] are members of the American, while [[Rice Owls football|Rice]] is a member of Conference USA.\n\n==Under the BCS system==\nFrom 1998 to 2013, the top teams in Division I FBS played in the BCS. It consisted of four or five bowl games, with a [[BCS National Championship Game|national championship game]] either rotating among the bowl sites (prior to the 2006 season) or played as a separate game. The BCS succeeded two other systems that were put in place after the [[1991 NCAA Division I-A football season|1991 season]] in order to ensure that one [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national champion]] could be crowned at the end of the season. The original [[Bowl Coalition]] consisted of the SEC, the [[Big Eight Conference]] (later succeeded by the Big 12), the [[Southwest Conference]] (SWC), the ACC, the Big East, and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]]. The BCS added the Pac-10 (now known as the Pac-12) and the Big Ten, while the SWC dissolved in 1996. In 2013, the Big East split into two conferences, and its successor, the [[American Athletic Conference]] (The American), took the Big East's place for the 2013 season.\n\nIn addition to creating a national championship game, the BCS also created a set format for other major bowls. After the two top teams in the BCS rankings were matched up in the [[BCS National Championship Game]], the other three or (after the 2005 season) four bowls selected other top teams. The term \"BCS conference\" was used by many fans to refer to one of the six conferences whose champions received an automatic berth in one of the five BCS bowl games, although the BCS itself used the term \"automatic qualifying conference\" (AQ conference).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/faq |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 8, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228101556/http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/faq |archivedate=December 28, 2009 }}</ref> While the number of AQ conferences was technically variable,<ref>{{cite web |title=AQ conferences could grow by 1 in 2012 |work= Bowl Championship Series |date=April 22, 2010 |url= http://www.bcsfootball.org/news/story?id=5126859 }}</ref> the BCS always had six AQ conferences since its inception in 1998.

The only D-I all-sports league to sponsor the sport is the mid-major [[Big West Conference]]. With that in mind, the five Power Five schools with men's volleyball programs are aligned as follows:\n* '''Big Ten''': Ohio State and Penn State both play in single-sport leagues, respectively in the [[Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association]] and [[Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association]].\n* '''Pac-12''': All three members with men's volleyball programs\u2014Stanford, UCLA, and USC\u2014compete in the [[Mountain Pacific Sports Federation]] (MPSF).\n\n'''Men's Water Polo''': Only 25 Division I members sponsor varsity men's water polo.

All compete in the MPSF.\n\n'''Beach Volleyball''':\nA women-only sport at the NCAA level, beach volleyball is sponsored by only one Power Five conference, namely the Pac-12. Nine of that conference's schools sponsor the sport (with the exceptions being Colorado, Oregon State, and Washington State). Other Power Five schools that sponsor the sport are aligned as follows:\n* '''ACC''': [[Florida State Seminoles beach volleyball|Florida State]] competes in the [[Coastal Collegiate Sports Association]] (CCSA), a league that only sponsors beach volleyball plus men's and women's swimming & diving.\n* '''Big Ten''':  Nebraska competes as an independent.\n* '''Big 12''':  TCU launched a new varsity beach volleyball program for the 2018\u201319 school year (2019 season), which competes in the CCSA.\n* '''SEC''': [[LSU Tigers women's beach volleyball|LSU]] and South Carolina compete in the CCSA.

Both compete in the [[American Athletic Conference]].\n\n'''Women's Rowing''':\n* '''Big 12''':  Five of the 10 full members sponsor women's rowing. They are joined by Alabama and Tennessee, the only two SEC schools to sponsor the sport. These schools are listed in italics as part of the SEC.\n* '''SEC''': See Big 12 above.\n\n'''Women's Water Polo''': Only 33 Division I members sponsor varsity women's water polo.
