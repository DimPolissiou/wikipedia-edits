He began releasing material as Four Tet in 1998 with the 36&nbsp;minute, 25&nbsp;second single \"[[Thirtysixtwentyfive]]\". Later that year, he released another single, the jazz-influenced \"Misnomer\". 1999's ''[[Dialogue (Four Tet album)|Dialogue]]'', again on Output, was Four Tet's first full-length album release and fused [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] drum lines with dissonant jazz samples. This was followed by the [[double A-side]] single \"Glasshead\"/\"Calamine\", which was to be Four Tet's last release on Output.\n\nIn late 1999, [[Warp Records]] released ''[[Warp 10: Influences, Classics, Remixes|Warp 10 + 3: Remixes]]'', a tenth-anniversary compilation of remixes of Warp tracks.

He began releasing material as Four Tet in 1998 with the 36&nbsp;minute, 25&nbsp;second single \"[[Thirtysixtwentyfive]]\". Later that year, he released another single, the jazz-influenced \"Misnomer\". 1999's ''[[Dialogue (Four Tet album)|Dialogue]]'', again on Output, was Four Tet's first full-length album release and fused [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] drum lines with dissonant jazz samples. This was followed by the [[double A-side]] single \"Glasshead\"/\"Calamine\", which was to be Four Tet's last release on Output.\n\nIn late 1999, [[Warp Records]] released ''[[Warp 10: Influences, Classics, Remixes|Warp 10 + 3: Remixes]]'', a tenth-anniversary compilation of remixes of Warp tracks.

The film stars [[Saoirse Ronan]] as [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] and [[Margot Robbie]] as her cousin [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], and chronicles the [[Rising of the North|1569 conflict between their two countries]]. [[Jack Lowden]], [[Joe Alwyn]], [[David Tennant]], and [[Guy Pearce]] also star in supporting roles.\n\n''Mary Queen of Scots'' had its world premiere on closing night of [[AFI Fest]] on 15 November 2018, was released in the United States on 7 December 2018, and was released in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2019. The film received mixed reviews, with praise for the performances (particularly Ronan and Robbie) and costumes, but was criticised for the screenplay and several historical inaccuracies.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.dailyedge.ie/saoirse-ronan-16-4350534-Nov2018/ |title=This is what the critics are saying about Saoirse Ronan's new movie, Mary Queen of Scots |first=Fionnuala |last=Jones |date=20 November 2018 |newspaper=[[TheJournal.ie|The Daily Edge]] |accessdate=3 December 2018}}</ref> The film received three nominations at the [[72nd British Academy Film Awards]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Bafta Film Awards 2019: All the nominees |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-46794243 |accessdate=9 January 2019 |work=BBC News |date=9 January 2019}}</ref> and two nominations, for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] and [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup and Hairstyling]], at the [[91st Academy Awards]]. For her performance, Robbie earned nominations for a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role|SAG Award]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|BAFTA Award]] for Best Supporting Actress.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1561, nineteen-year-old [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart]], [[Catholic]] Queen of [[Scotland]], returns to her home country from [[France]] following the death of her husband, [[Francis II of France|Francis II]], to take up her throne, where she is received by her half brother, the [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|Earl of Moray]]. In neighbouring [[England]], Mary's twenty-eight-year-old cousin [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] is [[Protestant]] Queen of England \u2013 unmarried, childless, and threatened by Mary's potential claim to her throne. Mary dismisses the cleric [[John Knox]] from her court. A Protestant and leader of the [[Scottish Reformation]], Knox views Mary as a danger to the kingdom's Protestant supremacy.\n\nSeeking to weaken her cousin's threat to her sovereignty, Elizabeth arranges for Mary, whom English Catholics recognize as their rightful Queen, to be married to an Englishman. She chooses [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]], whom she secretly loves; though he and Mary are unwilling, news of Elizabeth's [[smallpox]] convinces Mary to accept, provided she is named Elizabeth's heir apparent. Reluctant to let go of Dudley, Elizabeth sends [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]] to Scotland with the pretence of living under their religious freedom. Despite sensing an ulterior motive, Mary grows fond of Darnley and eventually accepts his marriage proposal.\n\nMary's impending marriage causes a constitutional crisis within both realms: Elizabeth is advised to oppose the marriage for fear that Darnley, an English noble, will elevate Mary's claim to the Crown; Mary's council is suspicious of Darnley, fearing an English takeover. Both kingdoms demand his return to England but Mary refuses, enraging Moray to mount a rebellion against her. Mary marries Darnley, only to discover him in bed with her friend and private secretary, [[David Rizzio]]. Mary quashes the rebel forces but spares Rizzio and Moray, and demands Darnley give her a child. When a child is conceived, Mary declares the child is \"heir to Scotland and England\" \u2013 offending the English.\n\nMoray colludes with Darnley's father [[Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox]], to undermine Mary. They spread rumours that her child was illegitimately fathered by Rizzio, driving John Knox to vehemently preach that Mary is an adulteress. Fearing these accusations and the possible discovery of his homosexuality, Darnley is coerced by the underminers to join them in murdering Rizzio, and reluctantly delivers the final blow.\n\nDiscovering the plot, Mary agrees to pardon the conspirators if presented with evidence that Darnley took part. She ultimately forgives Moray, and asks Elizabeth to be her child's godmother. They agree the child is heir presumptive, much to the English court's chagrin. Mary banishes Darnley but refuses to divorce him, despite the appeals of her council, which approaches her adviser and protector, the [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]], to have him killed.\n\nAfter Darnley's death, Mary is forced to flee without her child. Bothwell advises that her council have decided she must marry a Scotsman immediately\u2014and that Scotsman should be Bothwell himself.  Mary initially objects, suspecting he was involved with Darnley's murder, but after he threatens her and subsequently rapes her, she consents to the marriage. This induces Knox to preach to the Scots that Mary is a \"harlot\" who had her husband killed, leading Moray and her court to demand her abdication. Despite her objections, Mary eventually abdicates her throne and flees to England.\n\nElizabeth arranges a clandestine meeting, where Mary asks for help to take back her throne. Reluctant to go to war on behalf of a Catholic, Elizabeth instead promises a safe exile in England as long as Mary does not aid her enemies. Mary responds that if she does, it will only be because Elizabeth forced her to do so, and threatens that should Elizabeth murder her, she should remember that she \"murdered her own sister and queen\". Placing Mary under house arrest, Elizabeth receives compelling evidence that Mary [[Babington Plot|conspired with her enemies]] to have her assassinated. With no other choice, Elizabeth orders Mary's execution. As Mary is walked to the [[Scaffold (execution site)|scaffold]], a remorseful Elizabeth cries for Mary, who reveals a [[Liturgical colours|bright red dress]], implying herself a martyr. In her final thoughts, Mary wishes her son [[James VI and I|James]] well and hopes for peace upon his reign.\n\nA post-script reveals that upon Elizabeth's death in 1603, James became the first monarch to rule [[Union of the Crowns|both Scotland and England]].\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n* [[Saoirse Ronan]] as [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart]], the Queen of Scots and Elizabeth's cousin\n* [[Margot Robbie]] as [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], Mary's cousin and the Queen of England and Ireland\n* [[Jack Lowden]] as [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Henry Darnley]], Mary's second husband\n* [[Joe Alwyn]] as [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]], Elizabeth's counselor and lover\n* [[David Tennant]] as [[John Knox]], founder of the [[Church of Scotland]]\n* [[Guy Pearce]] as [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], advisor to Elizabeth\n* [[Gemma Chan]] as [[Bess of Hardwick]], a friend and confidante of Elizabeth and keeper of Mary\n* [[Martin Compston]] as [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Lord Bothwell]], Mary's third husband\n* [[Ismael Cruz C\u00f3rdova]] as [[David Rizzio]], Mary's close friend and confidant\n* [[Brendan Coyle]] as [[Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox|Earl of Lennox]], father of Lord Darnley\n* [[Ian Hart]] as [[John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane|Lord Maitland]], Lord Chancellor of Scotland\n* [[Adrian Lester]] as [[Thomas Randolph (ambassador)|Lord Randolph]], Elizabeth's ambassador to Scotland\n* [[James McArdle]] as the [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|James, Earl of Moray]], Regent of Scotland\n\nIn addition, [[Eileen O\u2019Higgins]], Izuka Hoyle and Liah O\u2019Prey are seen throughout the film as Mary's personal attendants, [[Mary Beaton]], [[Mary Seton]] and [[Mary Livingston]], respectively.

For her performance, Robbie earned nominations for a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role|SAG Award]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|BAFTA Award]] for Best Supporting Actress.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1561, nineteen-year-old [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart]], [[Catholic]] Queen of [[Scotland]], returns to her home country from [[France]] following the death of her husband, [[Francis II of France|Francis II]], to take up her throne, where she is received by her half brother, the [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|Earl of Moray]]. In neighbouring [[England]], Mary's twenty-eight-year-old cousin [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] is [[Protestant]] Queen of England \u2013 unmarried, childless, and threatened by Mary's potential claim to her throne. Mary dismisses the cleric [[John Knox]] from her court. A Protestant and leader of the [[Scottish Reformation]], Knox views Mary as a danger to the kingdom's Protestant supremacy.\n\nSeeking to weaken her cousin's threat to her sovereignty, Elizabeth arranges for Mary, whom English Catholics recognize as their rightful Queen, to be married to an Englishman. She chooses [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]], whom she secretly loves; though he and Mary are unwilling, news of Elizabeth's [[smallpox]] convinces Mary to accept, provided she is named Elizabeth's heir apparent. Reluctant to let go of Dudley, Elizabeth sends [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]] to Scotland with the pretence of living under their religious freedom. Despite sensing an ulterior motive, Mary grows fond of Darnley and eventually accepts his marriage proposal.\n\nMary's impending marriage causes a constitutional crisis within both realms: Elizabeth is advised to oppose the marriage for fear that Darnley, an English noble, will elevate Mary's claim to the Crown; Mary's council is suspicious of Darnley, fearing an English takeover. Both kingdoms demand his return to England but Mary refuses, enraging Moray to mount a rebellion against her. Mary marries Darnley, only to discover him in bed with her friend and private secretary, [[David Rizzio]]. Mary quashes the rebel forces but spares Rizzio and Moray, and demands Darnley give her a child. When a child is conceived, Mary declares the child is \"heir to Scotland and England\" \u2013 offending the English.\n\nMoray colludes with Darnley's father [[Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox]], to undermine Mary. They spread rumours that her child was illegitimately fathered by Rizzio, driving John Knox to vehemently preach that Mary is an adulteress. Fearing these accusations and the possible discovery of his homosexuality, Darnley is coerced by the underminers to join them in murdering Rizzio, and reluctantly delivers the final blow.\n\nDiscovering the plot, Mary agrees to pardon the conspirators if presented with evidence that Darnley took part. She ultimately forgives Moray, and asks Elizabeth to be her child's godmother. They agree the child is heir presumptive, much to the English court's chagrin. Mary banishes Darnley but refuses to divorce him, despite the appeals of her council, which approaches her adviser and protector, the [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]], to have him killed.\n\nAfter Darnley's death, Mary is forced to flee without her child. Bothwell advises that her council have decided she must marry a Scotsman immediately\u2014and that Scotsman should be Bothwell himself.  Mary initially objects, suspecting he was involved with Darnley's murder, but after he threatens her and subsequently rapes her, she consents to the marriage. This induces Knox to preach to the Scots that Mary is a \"harlot\" who had her husband killed, leading Moray and her court to demand her abdication. Despite her objections, Mary eventually abdicates her throne and flees to England.\n\nElizabeth arranges a clandestine meeting, where Mary asks for help to take back her throne. Reluctant to go to war on behalf of a Catholic, Elizabeth instead promises a safe exile in England as long as Mary does not aid her enemies. Mary responds that if she does, it will only be because Elizabeth forced her to do so, and threatens that should Elizabeth murder her, she should remember that she \"murdered her own sister and queen\". Placing Mary under house arrest, Elizabeth receives compelling evidence that Mary [[Babington Plot|conspired with her enemies]] to have her assassinated. With no other choice, Elizabeth orders Mary's execution. As Mary is walked to the [[Scaffold (execution site)|scaffold]], a remorseful Elizabeth cries for Mary, who reveals a [[Liturgical colours|bright red dress]], implying herself a martyr. In her final thoughts, Mary wishes her son [[James VI and I|James]] well and hopes for peace upon his reign.\n\nA post-script reveals that upon Elizabeth's death in 1603, James became the first monarch to rule [[Union of the Crowns|both Scotland and England]].\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n* [[Saoirse Ronan]] as [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart]], the Queen of Scots and Elizabeth's cousin\n* [[Margot Robbie]] as [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], Mary's cousin and the Queen of England and Ireland\n* [[Jack Lowden]] as [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Henry Darnley]], Mary's second husband\n* [[Joe Alwyn]] as [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]], Elizabeth's counselor and lover\n* [[David Tennant]] as [[John Knox]], founder of the [[Church of Scotland]]\n* [[Guy Pearce]] as [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], advisor to Elizabeth\n* [[Gemma Chan]] as [[Bess of Hardwick]], a friend and confidante of Elizabeth and keeper of Mary\n* [[Martin Compston]] as [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Lord Bothwell]], Mary's third husband\n* [[Ismael Cruz C\u00f3rdova]] as [[David Rizzio]], Mary's close friend and confidant\n* [[Brendan Coyle]] as [[Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox|Earl of Lennox]], father of Lord Darnley\n* [[Ian Hart]] as [[John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane|Lord Maitland]], Lord Chancellor of Scotland\n* [[Adrian Lester]] as [[Thomas Randolph (ambassador)|Lord Randolph]], Elizabeth's ambassador to Scotland\n* [[James McArdle]] as the [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|James, Earl of Moray]], Regent of Scotland\n\nIn addition, [[Eileen O\u2019Higgins]], Izuka Hoyle and Liah O\u2019Prey are seen throughout the film as Mary's personal attendants, [[Mary Beaton]], [[Mary Seton]] and [[Mary Livingston]], respectively.

It is the southern part of the [[North\u2013South Corridor, Adelaide|North\u2013South Corridor]] which extends the full length of Adelaide and is being built to urban freeway standard.\n\nThe Southern Expressway was built as a corridor to relieve heavy traffic from the major arterial, [[South Road, Adelaide|Main South Road]], in [[Adelaide]]'s south. It was originally built as a [[reversible lane|reversible one way freeway]], and was the world's longest after its completion in 2001. Between 2010 and 2014 it was expanded and it is now a regular 2-direction freeway.\n\nConstruction of the expressway also included the [[Adelaide Southern Veloway]] for cyclists, which runs alongside it for 7&nbsp;km, from Marion/Main South Road to the Reynella Interchange. South of the Reynella Interchange, the bikeway becomes a shared track for the remaining 12&nbsp;km of the expressway. The expressway crosses over the [[Coast to Vines Rail Trail]] at both [[Panalatinga Road, Adelaide|Panalatinga Road]] and at the expressway's southern end.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-construction===\n\nThe expressway is the southern part of a north-south freeway originally conceptualised under the [[Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study]] (MATS), completed in 1965, as a freeway bypassing the city from [[Dry Creek, South Australia|Dry Creek]] to [[Old Noarlunga, South Australia|Old Noarlunga]].<ref>[http://www.ozroads.com.au/SA/freewayplans.jpg MATS plan freeways], ozroads.com.au</ref> The MATS plan proved unpopular, and in 1971 all further highway construction in Adelaide was postponed for a period of ten years. In 1983 plans for the freeway north of [[Darlington, South Australia|Darlington]] were abandoned, and the land that had been set aside was progressively sold off.\n\nIn 1984 the state government announced plans to develop a \"third [[arterial road]]\" for the south. In 1987 the project was split into two phases, the first the upgrading of Main South Road and Marion Road in the Darlington area, and the second a new road from Darlington to [[Reynella, South Australia|Reynella]]. Phase one was completed in 1994 with the widening of Main South Road to eight lanes between Ayliffes Road and Seacombe Road, and the widening of Marion Road to six lanes between Main South Road and Sturt Road.\n\nPhase 2 became the expressway, which was to be constructed in two stages: from Darlington to Reynella, and from Reynella to Old Noarlunga. It was developed as a one-way reversible road with future duplication provided for in the roadworks base, to be constructed when the need arose. It used the remaining \"Noarlunga Freeway\" reservation, except for the northernmost kilometre where a new route through [[O'Halloran Hill, South Australia|O'Halloran Hill]] was chosen to provide high-quality links with [[Marion, South Australia|Marion]] and Main South Roads without interfering with existing infrastructure at [[Sturt, South Australia|Sturt]].\n\n===Construction of the reversible freeway===\n\nConstruction of the expressway commenced in July 1995 and the first stage was opened to traffic on 17 December 1997. Construction commenced on the second stage in February 1999 and was opened to traffic on 9 September 2001. The total cost of the reversible freeway was A$76.5m{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}.\n\n==== Promotional FM radio transmitter ====\nDuring its construction and for some time after its opening, the expressway was promoted via a dedicated [[Frequency modulation|FM]] radio station established by the Department of Transport broadcasting via a low-power FM transmitter in the immediate vicinity of the road.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www2.parliament.sa.gov.au/hansard_data/1995/LC/WH171095.lc.htm | title=Hansard 17&nbsp;October 1995 | author=The Hon.

The northbound (city-bound) direction occurred on weekday mornings (2:00 am \u2013 12:30 pm) and weekend evenings (2:00 pm \u2013 12:30 am), the southbound direction on weekday evenings (2:00 pm \u2013 12:30 am) and weekend mornings (2:00 am \u2013 12:30 pm).<ref>{{cite web|title=Southern Expressway|url=http://www.sa.gov.au/subject/transport,%20travel%20and%20motoring/Motoring/Roads+and+traffic/Road+network/Southern+Expressway|publisher=Government of South Australia|access-date=3 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503175026/http://www.sa.gov.au/subject/Transport%2C%2Btravel%2Band%2Bmotoring/Motoring/Roads%2Band%2Btraffic/Road%2Bnetwork/Southern%2BExpressway|archive-date=3 May 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It was closed 12:30\u20132:00 am and 12:30\u20132:00 pm, except for Saturday and Monday mornings when the direction remained unchanged. Weekday public holidays also operated under the weekend's opening times to accommodate tourists travelling to the [[Fleurieu Peninsula]]. During each closure all road signs, lights and boom gates changed over, and the road was inspected by a tow truck contractor for debris and car breakdowns.\n\n===Duplication===\nIn 2007 the [[Howard Government]] pledged $100m towards widening the expressway in its unsuccessful re-election bid.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,22263232-5006301,00.html PM's $100m pledge], Mark Kenny, The Advertiser, 18 August 2007.</ref>\n\nOn 17 February 2010, during the state election campaign, Premier [[Mike Rann]] announced that, if re-elected the expressway would be duplicated in a A$445m project.<ref>http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/in-depth/southern-expressway-to-be-doubled-announces-sa-premier-mike-rann/story-fn2sdwup-1225831294904</ref> However, the inclusion of a new A$75m interchange at [[Darlington, South Australia|Darlington]] was later scrapped, after the government planning for a major transport hub at Darlington discovered the need for a $50 million section of road that would have to be destroyed when the expressway was eventually duplicated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/new-southern-expressway-freeway-darlington-iinterchange-scrapped/story-e6frea83-1226119643674 |title=New Southern Expressway freeway Darlington interchange scrapped  |publisher=[[AdelaideNow]] |date=22 August 2011 |accessdate=22 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nOnce duplication was announced in 2010, construction started one year later in 2011. The first construction-related expressway closures were 3 consecutive days in January 2012, out of peak hours, but is the most disruption the road has experienced since the opening of Stage 2, with only day-long resurfacing of line-marking, and cycle rides disrupting the expressway previously.\n\nDue to the duplication of the Expressway, all of the bridges had to be widened to meet the new width of the road.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} Some road bridges were closed during the work needed, and others required a temporary lower speed limit for safety reasons. This caused some anger to residents and businesses.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/southern-expressway-upgrade-affects-trade-for-morphett-vale-businesses/story-e6frg6n6-1226647525627 Southern Expressway upgrade affects trade for Morphett Vale businesses], [[The Australian]], 21 May 2013</ref>\n\nThe new road was built entirely on the western side of the original roadway, and is four lanes wide between Reynella and Marion Road in the northbound.

The total cost of the reversible freeway was A$76.5m{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}.\n\n==== Promotional FM radio transmitter ====\nDuring its construction and for some time after its opening, the expressway was promoted via a dedicated [[Frequency modulation|FM]] radio station established by the Department of Transport broadcasting via a low-power FM transmitter in the immediate vicinity of the road.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www2.parliament.sa.gov.au/hansard_data/1995/LC/WH171095.lc.htm | title=Hansard 17&nbsp;October 1995 | author=The Hon.

The northbound (city-bound) direction occurred on weekday mornings (2:00 am \u2013 12:30 pm) and weekend evenings (2:00 pm \u2013 12:30 am), the southbound direction on weekday evenings (2:00 pm \u2013 12:30 am) and weekend mornings (2:00 am \u2013 12:30 pm).<ref>{{cite web|title=Southern Expressway|url=http://www.sa.gov.au/subject/transport,%20travel%20and%20motoring/Motoring/Roads+and+traffic/Road+network/Southern+Expressway|publisher=Government of South Australia|access-date=3 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503175026/http://www.sa.gov.au/subject/Transport%2C%2Btravel%2Band%2Bmotoring/Motoring/Roads%2Band%2Btraffic/Road%2Bnetwork/Southern%2BExpressway|archive-date=3 May 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It was closed 12:30\u20132:00 am and 12:30\u20132:00 pm, except for Saturday and Monday mornings when the direction remained unchanged. Weekday public holidays also operated under the weekend's opening times to accommodate tourists travelling to the [[Fleurieu Peninsula]]. During each closure all road signs, lights and boom gates changed over, and the road was inspected by a tow truck contractor for debris and car breakdowns.\n\n===Duplication===\nIn 2007 the [[Howard Government]] pledged $100m towards widening the expressway in its unsuccessful re-election bid.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,22263232-5006301,00.html PM's $100m pledge], Mark Kenny, The Advertiser, 18 August 2007.</ref>\n\nOn 17 February 2010, during the state election campaign, Premier [[Mike Rann]] announced that, if re-elected the expressway would be duplicated in a A$445m project.<ref>http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/in-depth/southern-expressway-to-be-doubled-announces-sa-premier-mike-rann/story-fn2sdwup-1225831294904</ref> However, the inclusion of a new A$75m interchange at [[Darlington, South Australia|Darlington]] was later scrapped, after the government planning for a major transport hub at Darlington discovered the need for a $50 million section of road that would have to be destroyed when the expressway was eventually duplicated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/new-southern-expressway-freeway-darlington-iinterchange-scrapped/story-e6frea83-1226119643674 |title=New Southern Expressway freeway Darlington interchange scrapped  |publisher=[[AdelaideNow]] |date=22 August 2011 |accessdate=22 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nOnce duplication was announced in 2010, construction started one year later in 2011. The first construction-related expressway closures were 3 consecutive days in January 2012, out of peak hours, but is the most disruption the road has experienced since the opening of Stage 2, with only day-long resurfacing of line-marking, and cycle rides disrupting the expressway previously.\n\nDue to the duplication of the Expressway, all of the bridges had to be widened to meet the new width of the road.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} Some road bridges were closed during the work needed, and others required a temporary lower speed limit for safety reasons. This caused some anger to residents and businesses.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/southern-expressway-upgrade-affects-trade-for-morphett-vale-businesses/story-e6frg6n6-1226647525627 Southern Expressway upgrade affects trade for Morphett Vale businesses], [[The Australian]], 21 May 2013</ref>\n\nThe new road was built entirely on the western side of the original roadway, and is four lanes wide between Reynella and Marion Road in the northbound.

[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Rodents and grasshoppers likely form the bulk of its diet, though it does kill snakes. \n\nAlthough the secretarybird occurs over a very large range, anecdotal observations and the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. The species is therefore classed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The secretarybird appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].<ref name=hackett2008/><ref name=ioc/>\n|align=right\n|cladogram={{Cladex| style=font-size:80%;line-height:75%;width:340px;\n|1={{clade\n   |1=[[Cathartidae]] \u2013 New World vultures (7 species)\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Sagittariidae]] \u2013 '''Secretarybird'''\n      |2={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Pandionidae]] \u2013 Ospreys (2 species)\n            |2=[[Accipitridae]] \u2013 Kites, hawks and eagles (256 species)\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n  }}\n}}\nThe German biologist Ragnar Kinzelbach has proposed that the secretarybird was depicted as ''bistarda deserti'' in the 13th century work ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'' penned by Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].

The earliest [[fossil]]s associated with the family are two species from the genus ''[[Pelargopappus]]''. The two species, from the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] respectively, were not discovered in Africa but France. The feet in these fossils are more like those of the Accipitridae; it is suggested that these characteristics are primitive features within the family.

Adults have a featherless red-orange face with pale brown irises and a yellow [[cere]]. The legs and feet are pinkish grey, the upper legs clad in black feathers. The toes are short and stout so that the bird is unable to grasp objects with its feet. The rear toe is small and the three forward facing toes are connected at the base by a small web.<ref name=hbwfamily/> Immature birds have yellow rather than orange bare skin on their faces, more brownish plumage, shorter tail feathers and greyish rather than brown irises.<ref name=brown1982/>\n\nAdults are normally silent; however, they can utter a deep guttural croaking noise when they are in nuptial displays or at nests.<ref name=brown1982/> Secretarybirds make this sound when greeting their mates or in a threat display or fight against other birds, sometimes throwing their head backwards at the same time. When alarmed, the secretarybird may emit a high-pitched croak. Mated pairs at the nest make soft clucking or whistling calls.<ref name=hbwfamily/>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n[[File:SerpentariusSkeleton.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Skeleton]]\nThe secretarybird is endemic to [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and is generally [[bird migration|non-migratory]], though it may be locally nomadic as it follows rainfall and the resulting abundance of prey.<ref name=hbwfamily/> Its range extends from [[Senegal]] to [[Somalia]] and south to [[Cape Province]], [[South Africa]].<ref name=brown1982/>\n\nThe species is also found at a variety of [[elevation]]s, from the [[coastal plain]]s to the highlands. The secretarybird prefers open [[grassland]]s, [[savanna]]s and [[shrubland]] ([[Karoo]]) rather than [[forest]]s and dense [[shrubbery]] which may impede its [[cursorial]] existence.<ref name=hbwfamily/> More specifically, it prefers areas with grass under {{cvt|0.5|m}} high and avoids those with grass over {{cvt|1|m}} high. It is rarer in grasslands in northern parts of its range that otherwise appear similar to areas in southern Africa where it is abundant, suggesting it may avoid hotter regions. It also avoids deserts.<ref name=brown1982/>\n\n== Behaviour and ecology ==\nSecretarybirds generally [[Bird#Resting and roosting|roost]] in trees of the genus ''[[Acacia]]'' or ''[[Balanites]]'', or even introduced pine trees in South Africa.<ref name=brown1982/> They set off 1\u20132 hours after dawn, generally after spending some time preening.<ref name=hbwfamily/> Mated pairs roost together but may forage separately, though often remain in sight of one another.

Their wings can flap, though in a slow laborious manner and requiring uplift to be sustained, otherwise they can become exhausted.

They can breed at any time of the year, more frequently in the late dry season. During courtship, they exhibit a nuptial display by soaring high with undulating flight patterns and calling with guttural croaking. Males and females can also perform a grounded display by chasing each other with their wings up and back, much like the way they defend their territory. They either mate on the ground or in trees.<ref name=brown1982>{{ cite book | editor1-last=Brown | editor1-first=L.H. | editor2-last=Urban | editor2-first=E.K. | editor3-last=Newman | editor3-first=K. | year=1982 | title=The Birds of Africa | volume=Volume 1 | location=London | publisher=Academic Press | isbn=978-0-12-137301-6 | pages=437\u2013440 }}</ref><!--p. 439-->\n\nThe nest is built by both sexes at the top of a dense thorny tree, often an ''Acacia'', at a height of between {{cvt|2.5|and|13|m|ft|sigfig=1}} above the ground.

Only with small prey items such as wasps will the bird use its bill to pick prey items directly. There are some reports that, when capturing snakes, a secretarybird will take flight with their prey and then drop them to their death, although this has not been verified.

This short time of contact suggests that the secretarybird relies on superior visual targeting to determine the precise location of the prey's head. Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency. It has been hypothesised that secretarybirds may have employed a similar hunting technique to the extinct [[Phorusrhacidae]] because they are anatomically similar (although they are not closely related).<ref name=portugal /><!-- cites previous 6 sentences -->\n\nSecretarybirds rarely encounter other predators, expect in the case of [[tawny eagle]]s which will [[Kleptoparasitism|steal their kills]].

[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Rodents and grasshoppers likely form the bulk of its diet, though it does kill snakes. \n\nAlthough the secretarybird occurs over a very large range, anecdotal observations and the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. The species is therefore classed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The secretarybird appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].<ref name=hackett2008/><ref name=ioc/>\n|align=right\n|cladogram={{Cladex| style=font-size:80%;line-height:75%;width:340px;\n|1={{clade\n   |1=[[Cathartidae]] \u2013 New World vultures (7 species)\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Sagittariidae]] \u2013 '''Secretarybird'''\n      |2={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Pandionidae]] \u2013 Ospreys (2 species)\n            |2=[[Accipitridae]] \u2013 Kites, hawks and eagles (256 species)\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n  }}\n}}\nThe German biologist Ragnar Kinzelbach has proposed that the secretarybird was depicted as ''bistarda deserti'' in the 13th century work ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'' penned by Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. He most likely gained knowledge of the bird from sources in Egypt. The 16th century French priest and traveller [[Andr\u00e9 Thevet]] also wrote a description of a mysterious bird in 1558 that has been likened by Kinzelbach to the species.<ref name=kinzelbach>{{cite journal |last1=Kinzelbach |first1=Ragnar K. |title=Pre-Linnaean pictures of the secretarybird, ''Sagittarius serpentarius'' (J.

The two species, from the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] respectively, were not discovered in Africa but France.

Adults have a featherless red-orange face with pale brown irises and a yellow [[cere]]. The legs and feet are pinkish grey, the upper legs clad in black feathers. The toes are short and stout so that the bird is unable to grasp objects with its feet. The rear toe is small and the three forward facing toes are connected at the base by a small web.<ref name=hbwfamily/> Immature birds have yellow rather than orange bare skin on their faces, more brownish plumage, shorter tail feathers and greyish rather than brown irises.<ref name=brown1982/>\n\nAdults are normally silent; however, they can utter a deep guttural croaking noise when they are in nuptial displays or at nests.<ref name=brown1982/> Secretarybirds make this sound when greeting their mates or in a threat display or fight against other birds, sometimes throwing their head backwards at the same time. When alarmed, the secretarybird may emit a high-pitched croak. Mated pairs at the nest make soft clucking or whistling calls.<ref name=hbwfamily/>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n[[File:SerpentariusSkeleton.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Skeleton]]\nThe secretarybird is endemic to [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and is generally [[bird migration|non-migratory]], though it may be locally nomadic as it follows rainfall and the resulting abundance of prey.<ref name=hbwfamily/> Its range extends from [[Senegal]] to [[Somalia]] and south to [[Cape Province]], [[South Africa]].<ref name=brown1982/>\n\nThe species is also found at a variety of [[elevation]]s, from the [[coastal plain]]s to the highlands. The secretarybird prefers open [[grassland]]s, [[savanna]]s and [[shrubland]] ([[Karoo]]) rather than [[forest]]s and dense [[shrubbery]] which may impede its [[cursorial]] existence.<ref name=hbwfamily/> More specifically, it prefers areas with grass under {{cvt|0.5|m}} high and avoids those with grass over {{cvt|1|m}} high. It is rarer in grasslands in northern parts of its range that otherwise appear similar to areas in southern Africa where it is abundant, suggesting it may avoid hotter regions. It also avoids deserts.<ref name=brown1982/>\n\n== Behaviour and ecology ==\nSecretarybirds generally [[Bird#Resting and roosting|roost]] in trees of the genus ''[[Acacia]]'' or ''[[Balanites]]'', or even introduced pine trees in South Africa.<ref name=brown1982/> They set off 1\u20132 hours after dawn, generally after spending some time preening.<ref name=hbwfamily/> Mated pairs roost together but may forage separately, though often remain in sight of one another.

Their wings can flap, though in a slow laborious manner and requiring uplift to be sustained, otherwise they can become exhausted.

They can breed at any time of the year, more frequently in the late dry season. During courtship, they exhibit a nuptial display by soaring high with undulating flight patterns and calling with guttural croaking. Males and females can also perform a grounded display by chasing each other with their wings up and back, much like the way they defend their territory. They either mate on the ground or in trees.<ref name=brown1982>{{ cite book | editor1-last=Brown | editor1-first=L.H. | editor2-last=Urban | editor2-first=E.K. | editor3-last=Newman | editor3-first=K. | year=1982 | title=The Birds of Africa | volume=Volume 1 | location=London | publisher=Academic Press | isbn=978-0-12-137301-6 | pages=437\u2013440 }}</ref><!--p. 439-->\n\nThe nest is built by both sexes at the top of a dense thorny tree, often an ''Acacia'', at a height of between {{cvt|2.5|and|13|m|ft|sigfig=1}} above the ground.

Only with small prey items such as wasps will the bird use its bill to pick prey items directly. There are some reports that, when capturing snakes, a secretarybird will take flight with their prey and then drop them to their death, although this has not been verified.

This short time of contact suggests that the secretarybird relies on superior visual targeting to determine the precise location of the prey's head. Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency. It has been hypothesised that secretarybirds may have employed a similar hunting technique to the extinct [[Phorusrhacidae]] because they are anatomically similar (although they are not closely related).<ref name=portugal /><!-- cites previous 6 sentences -->\n\nSecretarybirds rarely encounter other predators, expect in the case of [[tawny eagle]]s which will [[Kleptoparasitism|steal their kills]].

Fulfilling the wish of his father, the young Muhammad took learning and scholarship very seriously and traveled far and wide to attend the lectures of renowned scholars and acquire the knowledge, an exercise highly encouraged in his Islamic faith. At a young age, he moved to [[Nishapur]] to study philosophy under Farid al-Din Damad and mathematics under [[Muhammad Hasib]].<ref name=\"HistMuslimPhil\">Siddiqi, Bakhtyar Husain. \"Nasir al-Din Tusi\".

Between [[Ptolemy]] and [[Copernicus]], he is considered by many{{who|date=April 2014}} to be one of the most eminent astronomers of his time. His famous student ''Shams ad-Din Al-Bukhari'' <ref name=\"Shams\"/> was the teacher of [[Byzantine]] scholar ''[[Gregory Choniades]],'' <ref name=\"Chioniadis\">{{MathGenealogy|id=201288}}</ref> who had in turn trained [[astronomer]] ''[[Manuel Bryennios]]'' <ref name=\"Bryennios\">{{MathGenealogy|id=184632}}</ref> about 1300 in [[Constantinople]].\n\nFor his planetary models, he invented a geometrical technique called a [[Tusi-couple]], which generates linear motion from the sum of two circular motions. He used this technique to replace [[Ptolemy]]'s problematic [[equant]]<ref>Craig G.

Although it doesn't mean that he was a supporter of mobility of the earth, as he and his 16th-century commentator [[al-Birjandi|al-B\u012brjand\u012b]], maintained that the earth's immobility could be demonstrated, only by physical principles found in natural philosophy.<ref>{{Citation | last = Ragep | first = F.

He defended a version of Aristotle's ''[[scala naturae]]'', in which he placed man above animals, plants, minerals, and the elements. He described \"[[grass]]es which grow without sowing or cultivation, by the mere mingling of elements,\"<ref name=\"NEp44\">Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;44.</ref> as closest to minerals. Among plants, he considered the [[date-palm]] as the most highly developed, since \"it only lacks one thing further to reach (the stage of) an animal: to tear itself loose from the soil and to move away in the quest for nourishment.\"<ref name=\"NEp44\" />\n\nThe lowest animals \"are adjacent to the region of plants: such are those animals which propagate like grass, being incapable of mating [...], e.g. [[earthworm]]s, and certain [[insect]]s\".<ref>Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;45.</ref> The animals \"which reach the stage of perfection [...] are distinguished by fully developed weapons\", such as antlers, horns, teeth, and claws. Tusi described these organs as adaptations to each species's lifestyle, in a way anticipating [[natural theology]]. He continued:\n\n{{quote|\"The noblest of the species is that one whose sagacity and perception is such that it accepts discipline and instruction: thus there accrues to it the perfection not originally created in it. Such are the schooled [[horse]] and the trained [[falcon]]. The greater this faculty grows in it, the more surpassing its rank, until a point is reached where the (mere) observation of action suffices as instruction: thus, when they see a thing, they perform the like of it by mimicry, without training [...]. This is the utmost of the animal degrees, and the first of the degrees of Man in contiguous therewith.\"<ref>Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;45f.</ref>}}\n\nThus, in this paragraph, Tusi described different types of [[learning]], recognising [[observational learning]] as the most advanced form, and correctly attributing it to certain animals.\n\nTusi seems to have perceived man as belonging to the animals, since he stated that \"the Animal Soul [comprising the faculties of perception and movement ...] is restricted to individuals of the animal species\", and that, by possessing a \"Human Soul, [...] mankind is distinguished and particularized among ''other'' animals.\"<ref>Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M.

Fulfilling the wish of his father, the young Muhammad took learning and scholarship very seriously and traveled far and wide to attend the lectures of renowned scholars and acquire the knowledge, an exercise highly encouraged in his Islamic faith.

His model for the planetary system is believed to be the most advanced of his time, and was used extensively until the development of the heliocentric model in the time of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. Between [[Ptolemy]] and [[Copernicus]], he is considered by many{{who|date=April 2014}} to be one of the most eminent astronomers of his time.

He defended a version of Aristotle's ''[[scala naturae]]'', in which he placed man above animals, plants, minerals, and the elements. He described \"[[grass]]es which grow without sowing or cultivation, by the mere mingling of elements,\"<ref name=\"NEp44\">Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;44.</ref> as closest to minerals. Among plants, he considered the [[date-palm]] as the most highly developed, since \"it only lacks one thing further to reach (the stage of) an animal: to tear itself loose from the soil and to move away in the quest for nourishment.\"<ref name=\"NEp44\" />\n\nThe lowest animals \"are adjacent to the region of plants: such are those animals which propagate like grass, being incapable of mating [...], e.g. [[earthworm]]s, and certain [[insect]]s\".<ref>Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;45.</ref> The animals \"which reach the stage of perfection [...] are distinguished by fully developed weapons\", such as antlers, horns, teeth, and claws. Tusi described these organs as adaptations to each species's lifestyle, in a way anticipating [[natural theology]]. He continued:\n\n{{quote|\"The noblest of the species is that one whose sagacity and perception is such that it accepts discipline and instruction: thus there accrues to it the perfection not originally created in it. Such are the schooled [[horse]] and the trained [[falcon]]. The greater this faculty grows in it, the more surpassing its rank, until a point is reached where the (mere) observation of action suffices as instruction: thus, when they see a thing, they perform the like of it by mimicry, without training [...].
