The [[Macedonian Greeks]] and Serbs followed, in general, the directives coming from their respective centers of national agitation, while by the Bulgarians the term ''Macedonian'' was acquiring the significance of a certain political loyalty, that progressively constructed a particular spirit of ''[[Regionalism (politics)|regional]]'' identity.<ref>We, the People: Politics of National Peculiarity in Southeastern Europe, Diana Mishkova, Central European University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|963-9776-28-9}}, p. 108.</ref> The [[Balkan Wars]] (1912\u20131913) and [[Balkans Campaign (World War I)|World War I]] (1914\u20131918) left Ottoman Macedonia divided between [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and resulted in significant changes in its ethnic composition. The immediate effect of the partition of Ottoman Macedonia were the nationalistic campaigns in areas under Greek and Serbian administration, which expelled Bulgarian churchmen and teachers and closed Bulgarian schools and churches. As a consequence a sizable part of the Slavic population of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek]] and Serbian (later Yugoslav Macedonia), fled to Bulgaria or was resettled there by virtue of a population exchange agreements ([[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]], [[Politis-Kalfov Protocol]]). Within Greece, the Macedonian Slavs were designated \"Slavophone Greeks\", while within Serbia (later within [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]) they were officially treated as \"South Serbs\". In both countries, schools and the media were used to disseminate the national ideologies and identities, and also the languages, of the new ruling nations, the Greeks and the Serbs. These cultural measures were reinforced by steps to alter the composition of the population: Serb colonists were implanted in Yugoslav Macedonia, while in Greek Macedonia, the mass settlement of [[Greek refugees]] from [[Anatolia]] definitively reduced the Slav population to minority status.<ref>Nationality on the Balkans.

The [[Macedonian Greeks]] and Serbs followed, in general, the directives coming from their respective centers of national agitation, while by the Bulgarians the term ''Macedonian'' was acquiring the significance of a certain political loyalty, that progressively constructed a particular spirit of ''[[Regionalism (politics)|regional]]'' identity.<ref>We, the People: Politics of National Peculiarity in Southeastern Europe, Diana Mishkova, Central European University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|963-9776-28-9}}, p. 108.</ref> The [[Balkan Wars]] (1912\u20131913) and [[Balkans Campaign (World War I)|World War I]] (1914\u20131918) left Ottoman Macedonia divided between [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and resulted in significant changes in its ethnic composition. The immediate effect of the partition of Ottoman Macedonia were the nationalistic campaigns in areas under Greek and Serbian administration, which expelled Bulgarian churchmen and teachers and closed Bulgarian schools and churches. As a consequence a sizable part of the Slavic population of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek]] and Serbian (later Yugoslav Macedonia), fled to Bulgaria or was resettled there by virtue of a population exchange agreements ([[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]], [[Politis-Kalfov Protocol]]). Within Greece, the Macedonian Slavs were designated \"Slavophone Greeks\", while within Serbia (later within [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]) they were officially treated as \"South Serbs\". In both countries, schools and the media were used to disseminate the national ideologies and identities, and also the languages, of the new ruling nations, the Greeks and the Serbs. These cultural measures were reinforced by steps to alter the composition of the population: Serb colonists were implanted in Yugoslav Macedonia, while in Greek Macedonia, the mass settlement of [[Greek refugees]] from [[Anatolia]] definitively reduced the Slav population to minority status.<ref>Nationality on the Balkans.

policy===\n==== Kashmir ====\nIn September 2008, Swamy stridently retorted against the contentions of some Indian columnists who voiced their opinions in favor of \"peacefully\" surrendering Kashmir to Pakistan. He said,\n\n:\"I would say that the silent suffering majority of India wants none of this. The 'Kashmir issue,' in fact, can no more be solved by dialogue either with the Pakistanis or the Hurriyat, leave alone the constitutional impossibility of allowing it to secede. [...]Kashmir, in fact, is now our [[History of Kashmir|defining identity]]. It is a touchstone for our resolve to preserve our national integrity. The population of that State may be majority Muslim but the land and its history is predominantly Hindu. For our commitment to the survival of the ancient civilisation of India and the composite culture that secularists talk of, we have not only to win that coming inevitable war but also resolve never to part with Kashmir. [...]\n\n:Pakistanis often cite the United Nations resolutions on Kashmir to argue for a plebiscite. This obfuscates the fact of accession of the State to India. The legality of the Instrument of Accession signed in favour of India by the then Maharaja of J&K, Hari Singh, on 26 October 1947 has to prevail anyway.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/article1345324.ece |location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu |title=Kashmir defines Indian identity |date=25 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n==== Tamil Nadu politics ====\nSwamy is well known for his critical views against the \"Aryan versus Dravidian\" politics of [[Periyar E.

policy===\n==== Kashmir ====\nIn September 2008, Swamy stridently retorted against the contentions of some Indian columnists who voiced their opinions in favor of \"peacefully\" surrendering Kashmir to Pakistan. He said,\n\n:\"I would say that the silent suffering majority of India wants none of this. The 'Kashmir issue,' in fact, can no more be solved by dialogue either with the Pakistanis or the Hurriyat, leave alone the constitutional impossibility of allowing it to secede. [...]Kashmir, in fact, is now our [[History of Kashmir|defining identity]]. It is a touchstone for our resolve to preserve our national integrity. The population of that State may be majority Muslim but the land and its history is predominantly Hindu. For our commitment to the survival of the ancient civilisation of India and the composite culture that secularists talk of, we have not only to win that coming inevitable war but also resolve never to part with Kashmir. [...]\n\n:Pakistanis often cite the United Nations resolutions on Kashmir to argue for a plebiscite. This obfuscates the fact of accession of the State to India. The legality of the Instrument of Accession signed in favour of India by the then Maharaja of J&K, Hari Singh, on 26 October 1947 has to prevail anyway.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/article1345324.ece |location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu |title=Kashmir defines Indian identity |date=25 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n==== Tamil Nadu politics ====\nSwamy is well known for his critical views against the \"Aryan versus Dravidian\" politics of [[Periyar E.

It is often confused with [[Lorraine Franconian]], a more distantly related [[Franconian languages|Franconian]] dialect spoken in the northwest corner of Alsace and in neighbouring [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]. Like other dialects and languages, Alsatian has also been influenced by outside sources. Words of [[Yiddish]] origin can be found in Alsatian, and modern conversational Alsatian includes adaptations of French words and English words, especially concerning new technologies.\n\nMany speakers of Alsatian could, if necessary, write in reasonable [[standard German]]. For most this would be rare and confined to those who have learned German at school or through work. As with other dialects, various factors determine when, where, and with whom one might converse in Alsatian. Some dialect speakers are unwilling to speak standard German, at times, to certain outsiders and prefer to use French. In contrast, many people living near the border with [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], will speak their dialect with a Swiss person from that area, as they are mutually intelligible for the most part; similar habits may apply to conversations with people of the nearby German [[Markgr\u00e4flerland]]. Some street names in Alsace may use Alsatian spellings (they were formerly displayed only in French but are now bilingual in some places, especially [[Strasbourg]] and [[Mulhouse]]).\n\n==Speakers==\n\n<div style=\"display:flex; flex-flow: row wrap; text-align: left;\">\n{{Inline block|width=38em|style= padding: 0.5em; margin: 0.5em; flex: 38em;|2=div|1=\n{{Side box |metadata=No<!--This makes the box display on the mobile site-->\n| position = left\n| below = Percentage of Alsatian speakers in Alsace.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.olcalsace.org/fr/observer-et-veiller/le-dialecte-en-chiffres|title=Le dialecte en chiffres {{!}} www.OLCAlsace.org|website=www.olcalsace.org|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-ethnologie-francaise-2003-3-page-363.htm#|title=Le dialecte alsacien : \u00e9tat des lieux|last=Denis|first=Marie-No\u00eble|date=2003|website=[[Cairn.info]]}}</ref>\n| abovestyle = text-align:center\n| text = {{Graph:Chart\n | type = area\n | width = 400\n | xAxisTitle = Year\n | xType = date\n | xAxisAngle = -40\n | x = 1900, 1946, 1962, 1979, 1986, 1991, 1997, 2001, 2012\n | yAxisTitle = Speakers (%)\n | yAxisMax = 100\n | yAxisMin = 0\n | yGrid= \n | y1 = 95, 91, 86.3, 74.7, 71.7, 67, 63, 61, 43\n}}\n}}\n{{clr}}}}\n{{Inline block|width=38em|style= padding: 0.5em; margin: 0.5em; flex: 38em;|2=div|1=\n[[File:Rue du Sauvage.JPG|thumb|right|175px|A bilingual ([[French language|French]] and Alsatian) sign in [[Mulhouse]].]]\n}}\n</div>\n\n=== Status of Alsatian in France ===\nSince 1992, the constitution of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] states that [[French language|French]] is the official language of the Republic. However, Alsatian, along with other [[regional language]]s, is recognized by the [[French government]] in the official list of [[languages of France]].  France is a signatory to the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] but has never ratified the law and has not given regional languages the support that would be required by the charter.  The policies of the Paris government have had the deliberate effect of greatly weakening the prevalence of native languages in France that are not \"French.\"{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}  As a result, the Alsatian dialect of German has gone from being the prevalent language of the region to one in decline.  A 1999 [[INSEE]] [[Statistical survey|survey]] counted 548,000 adult speakers of Alsatian in [[France]], making it the second most-spoken regional language in the country (after [[Occitan language|Occitan]]). Like all regional languages in France, however, the transmission of Alsatian is declining. While 43% of the adult population of Alsace speaks Alsatian, its use has been largely declining amongst the youngest generations.\n\nA dialect of Alsatian German is spoken in the United States by a group known as the [[Swiss Amish]], whose ancestors emigrated there in the middle of the 19th century. The approximately 7,000 speakers are located mainly in [[Allen County, Indiana]], with \"daughter settlements\"{{ref|a|[Note 1]}} elsewhere.<ref>Chad Thompson: ''The Languages of the Amish of Allen County, Indiana: Multilingualism and Convergence'', in Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 36, No. 1 (Spring, 1994), pp. 69-91</ref>\n\n==Orthography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"table-layout: fixed; width: 85em; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background: #eaaff3; font-weight: normal;\" colspan=\"32\" | '''[[Capital letters|Majuscule forms]]'''\n|-\n| [[A]] || [[B]] || [[C]] || [[D]] || [[E]] || [[F]] || [[G]] || [[H]] || [[I]] || [[J]] || [[K]] || [[L]] || [[M]] || [[N]] || [[O]] || [[P]] || [[Q]] || [[R]] || [[S]] || [[T]] || [[U]] || [[V]] || [[W]] || [[X]] || [[Y]] || [[Z]] || [[\u00c4]] || [[\u00c0]] || [[\u00c9]] || [[\u00d6]] || [[\u00dc]] || [[\u00d9]]\n|-\n! style=\"background: #e7f4ff; font-weight: normal;\" colspan=\"32\" | '''[[Lower case|Minuscule forms]]'''\n|-\n| a || b || c || d || e || f || g || h || i || j || k || l || m || n || o || p || q || r || s || t || u || v || w || x || y|| z || \u00e4 || \u00e0 || \u00e9 || \u00f6 || \u00fc || \u00f9\n|-\n! style=\"background: #a4a4ff; font-weight: normal;\" colspan=\"32\" | '''[[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]'''\n|-\n| {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/\u0259/}} || {{IPA|/b\u0325/}} || {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/\u0261\u030a/}} || {{IPA|/d\u0325/}} || {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/\u0259/}} || {{IPA|/f/}} || {{IPA|/\u0261\u030a/}} || {{IPA|/h/}} || {{IPA|/\u026a/}} || {{IPA|/j/}} || {{IPA|/k/}} || {{IPA|/l/}} || {{IPA|/m/}} || {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/\u014b/}} || {{IPA|/o/}} || {{IPA|/p/}} || {{IPA|/k/}} || {{IPA|/\u0281/}}, {{IPA|/\u0281\u031e/}}, {{IPA|/\u0280/}} || {{IPA|/s/}} || {{IPA|/t/}} || {{IPA|/\u028a/}} || {{IPA|/v/}}, {{IPA|/f/}}|| {{IPA|/\u028b/}}, {{IPA|/v/}} || {{IPA|/ks/}} || {{IPA|/\u028f/, /y\u02d0/, /\u026a/, /i\u02d0/}}  || {{IPA|/z/}} || {{IPA|/\u025b/}} || {{IPA|/\u0251/}}, {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/\u025b/}} || {{IPA|/\u0153/}} || {{IPA|/y/}} ||  {{IPA|/u/}}\n|}\n\n''C'', ''Q'', and ''X'' are only used in loanwords.

Its [[lenis|lenes]] are, however, [[voice (phonetics)|voiceless]] as in all Southern German varieties. Therefore, they are here transcribed {{IPA|/b\u0325/}}, {{IPA|/d\u0325/}}, {{IPA|/\u0261\u030a/}}.

In southern dialects, there is a tendency to pronounce it {{IPA|/x/}} in all positions, and in Strasbourg the palatal allophone tends to conflate with the phoneme {{IPA|/\u0283/}}.

It is often confused with [[Lorraine Franconian]], a more distantly related [[Franconian languages|Franconian]] dialect spoken in the northwest corner of Alsace and in neighbouring [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]. Like other dialects and languages, Alsatian has also been influenced by outside sources. Words of [[Yiddish]] origin can be found in Alsatian, and modern conversational Alsatian includes adaptations of French words and English words, especially concerning new technologies.\n\nMany speakers of Alsatian could, if necessary, write in reasonable [[standard German]]. For most this would be rare and confined to those who have learned German at school or through work. As with other dialects, various factors determine when, where, and with whom one might converse in Alsatian. Some dialect speakers are unwilling to speak standard German, at times, to certain outsiders and prefer to use French. In contrast, many people living near the border with [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], will speak their dialect with a Swiss person from that area, as they are mutually intelligible for the most part; similar habits may apply to conversations with people of the nearby German [[Markgr\u00e4flerland]]. Some street names in Alsace may use Alsatian spellings (they were formerly displayed only in French but are now bilingual in some places, especially [[Strasbourg]] and [[Mulhouse]]).\n\n==Speakers==\n\n<div style=\"display:flex; flex-flow: row wrap; text-align: left;\">\n{{Inline block|width=38em|style= padding: 0.5em; margin: 0.5em; flex: 38em;|2=div|1=\n{{Side box |metadata=No<!--This makes the box display on the mobile site-->\n| position = left\n| below = Percentage of Alsatian speakers in Alsace.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.olcalsace.org/fr/observer-et-veiller/le-dialecte-en-chiffres|title=Le dialecte en chiffres {{!}} www.OLCAlsace.org|website=www.olcalsace.org|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-ethnologie-francaise-2003-3-page-363.htm#|title=Le dialecte alsacien : \u00e9tat des lieux|last=Denis|first=Marie-No\u00eble|date=2003|website=[[Cairn.info]]}}</ref>\n| abovestyle = text-align:center\n| text = {{Graph:Chart\n | type = area\n | width = 400\n | xAxisTitle = Year\n | xType = date\n | xAxisAngle = -40\n | x = 1900, 1946, 1962, 1979, 1986, 1991, 1997, 2001, 2012\n | yAxisTitle = Speakers (%)\n | yAxisMax = 100\n | yAxisMin = 0\n | yGrid= \n | y1 = 95, 91, 86.3, 74.7, 71.7, 67, 63, 61, 43\n}}\n}}\n{{clr}}}}\n{{Inline block|width=38em|style= padding: 0.5em; margin: 0.5em; flex: 38em;|2=div|1=\n[[File:Rue du Sauvage.JPG|thumb|right|175px|A bilingual ([[French language|French]] and Alsatian) sign in [[Mulhouse]].]]\n}}\n</div>\n\n=== Status of Alsatian in France ===\nSince 1992, the constitution of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] states that [[French language|French]] is the official language of the Republic. However, Alsatian, along with other [[regional language]]s, is recognized by the [[French government]] in the official list of [[languages of France]].  France is a signatory to the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] but has never ratified the law and has not given regional languages the support that would be required by the charter.  The policies of the Paris government have had the deliberate effect of greatly weakening the prevalence of native languages in France that are not \"French.\"{{fact|date=July 2018}}  As a result, the Alsatian dialect of German has gone from being the prevalent language of the region to one in decline.  A 1999 [[INSEE]] [[Statistical survey|survey]] counted 548,000 adult speakers of Alsatian in [[France]], making it the second most-spoken regional language in the country (after [[Occitan language|Occitan]]). Like all regional languages in France, however, the transmission of Alsatian is declining. While 43% of the adult population of Alsace speaks Alsatian, its use has been largely declining amongst the youngest generations.\n\nA dialect of Alsatian German is spoken in the United States by a group known as the [[Swiss Amish]], whose ancestors emigrated there in the middle of the 19th century. The approximately 7,000 speakers are located mainly in [[Allen County, Indiana]], with \"daughter settlements\"{{ref|a|[Note 1]}} elsewhere.<ref>Chad Thompson: ''The Languages of the Amish of Allen County, Indiana: Multilingualism and Convergence'', in Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 36, No. 1 (Spring, 1994), pp. 69-91</ref>\n\n==Orthography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"table-layout: fixed; width: 85em; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background: #eaaff3; font-weight: normal;\" colspan=\"32\" | '''[[Capital letters|Majuscule forms]]'''\n|-\n| [[A]] || [[B]] || [[C]] || [[D]] || [[E]] || [[F]] || [[G]] || [[H]] || [[I]] || [[J]] || [[K]] || [[L]] || [[M]] || [[N]] || [[O]] || [[P]] || [[Q]] || [[R]] || [[S]] || [[T]] || [[U]] || [[V]] || [[W]] || [[X]] || [[Y]] || [[Z]] || [[\u00c4]] || [[\u00c0]] || [[\u00c9]] || [[\u00d6]] || [[\u00dc]] || [[\u00d9]]\n|-\n! style=\"background: #e7f4ff; font-weight: normal;\" colspan=\"32\" | '''[[Lower case|Minuscule forms]]'''\n|-\n| a || b || c || d || e || f || g || h || i || j || k || l || m || n || o || p || q || r || s || t || u || v || w || x || y|| z || \u00e4 || \u00e0 || \u00e9 || \u00f6 || \u00fc || \u00f9\n|-\n! style=\"background: #a4a4ff; font-weight: normal;\" colspan=\"32\" | '''[[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]'''\n|-\n| {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/\u0259/}} || {{IPA|/b\u0325/}} || {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/\u0261\u030a/}} || {{IPA|/d\u0325/}} || {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/\u0259/}} || {{IPA|/f/}} || {{IPA|/\u0261\u030a/}} || {{IPA|/h/}} || {{IPA|/\u026a/}} || {{IPA|/j/}} || {{IPA|/k/}} || {{IPA|/l/}} || {{IPA|/m/}} || {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/\u014b/}} || {{IPA|/o/}} || {{IPA|/p/}} || {{IPA|/k/}} || {{IPA|/\u0281/}}, {{IPA|/\u0281\u031e/}}, {{IPA|/\u0280/}} || {{IPA|/s/}} || {{IPA|/t/}} || {{IPA|/\u028a/}} || {{IPA|/v/}}, {{IPA|/f/}}|| {{IPA|/\u028b/}}, {{IPA|/v/}} || {{IPA|/ks/}} || {{IPA|/\u028f/, /y\u02d0/, /\u026a/, /i\u02d0/}}  || {{IPA|/z/}} || {{IPA|/\u025b/}} || {{IPA|/\u0251/}}, {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} || {{IPA|/\u025b/}} || {{IPA|/\u0153/}} || {{IPA|/y/}} ||  {{IPA|/u/}}\n|}\n\n''C'', ''Q'', and ''X'' are only used in loanwords.

In southern dialects, there is a tendency to pronounce it {{IPA|/x/}} in all positions, and in Strasbourg the palatal allophone tends to conflate with the phoneme {{IPA|/\u0283/}}.
