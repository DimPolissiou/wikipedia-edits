The C&WJR built this {{convert|7|mi|30|ch|km }} line to connect the C&WJR with Carlisle and beyond. The line was double track from Workington to {{stnlnk|Seaton|Cumbria}}, then single through Great Broughton to Linefoot.\n\nMost stations on C&WJR lines had heavy industrial neighbours, such as ironworks next to Cleator Moor West, or served primarily industrial workforces, such as Keekle Colliers' Platform. Great Broughton, however, was a fairly isolated country village, though there were small collieries nearby.\n\n==History==\nThe C&WJR was built in the late 1870s, being one of the fruits of the rapid industrialisation of West Cumberland in the second half of the nineteenth century, specifically being born as a reaction to oligopolistic behaviour by the [[London and North Western Railway|London and North Western]] and [[Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railway]]s.{{sfn|Anderson|2002|p=309}}\n\nIt was originally intended to drive the line northwards across country to meet the [[Caledonian Railway]] and cross into Scotland by the [[Solway viaduct|Solway Viaduct]], but an accommodation was made with the LNWR leading to the intended northern extension being greatly watered down to three lines:\n* a {{convert|1|mi|54|ch|km }} link from {{rws|Workington Central}} to {{rws|Siddick Junction}} which opened in 1880\n* a {{convert|30|ch|km }} link from Cloffocks Junction to the [[Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway|CKPR]] line which opened in March 1885, and\n* the \"Northern Extension\" through Great Broughton to Linefoot.{{sfn|McGowan Gradon|2004|p=59}}\n\nAll lines in the area were primarily aimed at mineral traffic, notably iron ore, coal and limestone, none more so than the Northern Extension, which passed through open country. Passenger services were provided calling at Great Broughton, but they were so unsuccessful they petered out after a mere two months. The C&WJR earned the local name \"The Track of the Ironmasters\".{{sfn|Anderson|2002|p=313}}\n\nThe founding Act of Parliament of June 1878 confirmed the company's agreement with the [[Furness Railway]] that the latter would operate the line for one third of the receipts.{{sfn|Marshall|1981|p=117}}\n\nAll C&WJR's lines were heavily graded. Almost all of the first three miles of the Northern Extension from Calva Junction through Seaton was rising at 1 in 70, with gentler slopes thereafter to the extension's summit at Great Broughton{{sfn|McGowan Gradon|2004|p=64}} This favoured loaded coal and coke trains heading for Workington..\n\nThe Northern Extension became part of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] at the [[Railways Act 1921|Grouping]] of 1923.\n\nLike any business tied to one or few industries, the C&WJR was particularly at the mercy of trade fluctuations and technological change. The Cumberland iron industry led the charge in the nineteenth century, but became less and less competitive as time passed and local ore became worked out and harder to win, taking the fortunes of the railway with it. The peak year was 1909, when the C&WJR handled 1,644,514 tons of freight.{{sfn|McGowan Gradon|2004|p=50}} Ominously for the line, that tonnage was down to just over 800,000 by 1922, bringing receipts of \u00a383,349, compared with passenger fares totalling \u00a36,570.{{sfn|Suggitt|2008|p=65}}\n\nThe high water mark for tonnage on the C&WJR was 1909, the high water mark for progress was 1913, with the opening of the Harrington and Lowca line for passenger traffic. A chronology of the line's affairs from 1876 to 1992 has almost no entries before 1914 which fail to include \"opened\" or \"commenced\". After 1918 the position was reversed, when the litany of step-by-step closures and withdrawals was relieved only by a control cabin and a signalbox being erected at [[Harrington Junction]] in 1919.\n\n==Services==\nC&WJR passenger trains consisted of antiquated Furness stock hauled largely by elderly Furness engines{{sfn|Anderson|2002|p=314}}{{sfn|McGowan Gradon|2004|pp=40 & 42}} referred to as \"rolling ruins\" by one author after a footplate ride in 1949.{{sfn|McGowan Gradon|2004|p=51}}\n\nNo Sunday passenger service was ever provided on any C&WJR line.\n\nThe Northern Extension had three stations: {{rws|Seaton|Cumbria}}, Great Broughton and {{rws|Linefoot}}, the last being run jointly with the [[Maryport and Carlisle Railway]] (MCR). A passenger service was provided to Seaton over two periods: 1888 to 1897 and 1907 to 1922. The service in the first period appears to have been out and back over the {{convert|2|mi|19|ch|km }} to {{rws|Workington Central}}. This was reduced to Wednesdays and Saturdays only (Workington Market Days) from March 1891 and to Saturdays only from January 1894, being withdrawn completely in July 1897.{{sfn|McGowan Gradon|2004|p=68}}{{sfn|Butt|1995|p=207}}\n\nThe company tried again ten years later, with what appears to have been another daily out and back from Workington Central. From 1 September 1908 this was extended, on Saturdays only, to Great Broughton and Linefoot, making those outposts qualify as stations having had a publicly advertised passenger service. That experiment failed, as they disappeared from the timetable in December of that year, leaving Seaton as the only Northern extension station with a public passenger service. Both Great Broughton and Linefoot stations remained open for goods traffic.\n\nThe W&CJR ran many workmen's trains. Three collieries were served by the Northern Extension - Camerton, Buckhill and Alice Pit. No source lists any station, halt or workmen's service to this last, which was at the northern end of the line near Linefoot Junction. The 1920 Working Time Table lists Alice Pit, but shows no booked services of any description.\n\n{{rws|Camerton Colliery Halt}} and {{rws|Buckhill Colliery Halt}} both had workmen's services at some point,{{sfn|Croughton|Kidner|Young|1982|pp=55 & 53}} but they are not mentioned in the May 1920 Working Time Table. Indeed, Camerton Colliery is not mentioned at all.{{sfn|Haynes|1920|loc=Tables}}\n\nThe 1920 Working Time Table shows no Goods (as opposed to mineral) trains or \"Through goods\" trains booked to call at or pass Great Broughton in either direction.{{sfn|Haynes|1920|loc=Tables}}\n\n==Rundown and closure==\nThe West Cumberland iron and steel industry was heavily dependent on supplies of coke from the Northumberland and Durham coalfields. The Northern Extension allowed \"a large proportion\" of this traffic to be routed away from Maryport and the coastal line. Likewise the short chord between Workington Bridge and Cloffocks Junction allowed Durham coke traffic to reach the furnaces via {{rws|Cockermouth}} then the C&WJR.{{sfn|McGowan Gradon|2004|loc=p.11, Note 8}} These must have suffered a significant decline, as by 1920 there were just two booked mineral workings each way each weekday between Linefoot and Workington through Great Broughton.{{sfn|Haynes|1920|loc=Tables}} It is therefore no surprise that the line north of Buckhill Colliery closed on 1 September 1921, closing Great Broughton and its residual goods traffic with it.{{sfn|McGowan Gradon|2004|p=59}}\n\nThe final stationmaster at Great Broughton was Joseph W Allason who retired, aged 78, on closure of the station after 42 years service.{{sfn|McGowan Gradon|2004|p=69}}\n\n==Afterlife==\nThe trtack was lifted before the [[Second World War]].

The C&WJR built this {{convert|7|mi|30|ch|km }} line to connect the C&WJR with Carlisle and beyond. The line was double track from Workington to {{stnlnk|Seaton|Cumbria}}, then single through Great Broughton to Linefoot.\n\nMost stations on C&WJR lines had heavy industrial neighbours, such as ironworks next to Cleator Moor West, or served primarily industrial workforces, such as Keekle Colliers' Platform. Great Broughton, however, was a fairly isolated country village, though there were small collieries nearby.\n\n==History==\nThe C&WJR was built in the late 1870s, being one of the fruits of the rapid industrialisation of West Cumberland in the second half of the nineteenth century, specifically being born as a reaction to oligopolistic behaviour by the [[London and North Western Railway|London and North Western]] and [[Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railway]]s.{{sfn|Anderson|2002|p=309}}\n\nIt was originally intended to drive the line northwards across country to meet the [[Caledonian Railway]] and cross into Scotland by the [[Solway viaduct|Solway Viaduct]], but an accommodation was made with the LNWR leading to the intended northern extension being greatly watered down to three lines:\n* a {{convert|1|mi|54|ch|km }} link from {{rws|Workington Central}} to {{rws|Siddick Junction}} which opened in 1880\n* a {{convert|30|ch|km }} link from Cloffocks Junction to the [[Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway|CKPR]] line which opened in March 1885, and\n* the \"Northern Extension\" through Great Broughton to Linefoot.{{sfn|McGowan Gradon|2004|p=59}}\n\nAll lines in the area were primarily aimed at mineral traffic, notably iron ore, coal and limestone, none more so than the Northern Extension, which passed through open country. Passenger services were provided calling at Great Broughton, but they were so unsuccessful they petered out after a mere two months. The C&WJR earned the local name \"The Track of the Ironmasters\".{{sfn|Anderson|2002|p=313}}\n\nThe founding Act of Parliament of June 1878 confirmed the company's agreement with the [[Furness Railway]] that the latter would operate the line for one third of the receipts.{{sfn|Marshall|1981|p=117}}\n\nAll C&WJR's lines were heavily graded. Almost all of the first three miles of the Northern Extension from Calva Junction through Seaton was rising at 1 in 70, with gentler slopes thereafter to the extension's summit at Great Broughton{{sfn|McGowan Gradon|2004|p=64}} This favoured loaded coal and coke trains heading for Workington..\n\nThe Northern Extension became part of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] at the [[Railways Act 1921|Grouping]] of 1923.\n\nLike any business tied to one or few industries, the C&WJR was particularly at the mercy of trade fluctuations and technological change. The Cumberland iron industry led the charge in the nineteenth century, but became less and less competitive as time passed and local ore became worked out and harder to win, taking the fortunes of the railway with it. The peak year was 1909, when the C&WJR handled 1,644,514 tons of freight.{{sfn|McGowan Gradon|2004|p=50}} Ominously for the line, that tonnage was down to just over 800,000 by 1922, bringing receipts of \u00a383,349, compared with passenger fares totalling \u00a36,570.{{sfn|Suggitt|2008|p=65}}\n\nThe high water mark for tonnage on the C&WJR was 1909, the high water mark for progress was 1913, with the opening of the Harrington and Lowca line for passenger traffic. A chronology of the line's affairs from 1876 to 1992 has almost no entries before 1914 which fail to include \"opened\" or \"commenced\". After 1918 the position was reversed, when the litany of step-by-step closures and withdrawals was relieved only by a control cabin and a signalbox being erected at [[Harrington Junction]] in 1919.\n\n==Services==\nC&WJR passenger trains consisted of antiquated Furness stock hauled largely by elderly Furness engines{{sfn|Anderson|2002|p=314}}{{sfn|McGowan Gradon|2004|pp=40 & 42}} referred to as \"rolling ruins\" by one author after a footplate ride in 1949.{{sfn|McGowan Gradon|2004|p=51}}\n\nNo Sunday passenger service was ever provided on any C&WJR line.\n\nThe Northern Extension had three stations: {{rws|Seaton|Cumbria}}, Great Broughton and {{rws|Linefoot}}, the last being run jointly with the [[Maryport and Carlisle Railway]] (MCR). A passenger service was provided to Seaton over two periods: 1888 to 1897 and 1907 to 1922. The service in the first period appears to have been out and back over the {{convert|2|mi|19|ch|km }} to {{rws|Workington Central}}. This was reduced to Wednesdays and Saturdays only (Workington Market Days) from March 1891 and to Saturdays only from January 1894, being withdrawn completely in July 1897.{{sfn|McGowan Gradon|2004|p=68}}{{sfn|Butt|1995|p=207}}\n\nThe company tried again ten years later, with what appears to have been another daily out and back from Workington Central. From 1 September 1908 this was extended, on Saturdays only, to Great Broughton and Linefoot, making those outposts qualify as stations having had a publicly advertised passenger service. That experiment failed, as they disappeared from the timetable in December of that year, leaving Seaton as the only Northern extension station with a public passenger service. Both Great Broughton and Linefoot stations remained open for goods traffic.\n\nThe W&CJR ran many workmen's trains. Three collieries were served by the Northern Extension - Camerton, Buckhill and Alice Pit. No source lists any station, halt or workmen's service to this last, which was at the northern end of the line near Linefoot Junction. The 1920 Working Time Table lists Alice Pit, but shows no booked services of any description.\n\n{{rws|Camerton Colliery Halt}} and {{rws|Buckhill Colliery Halt}} both had workmen's services at some point,{{sfn|Croughton|Kidner|Young|1982|pp=55 & 53}} but they are not mentioned in the May 1920 Working Time Table. Indeed, Camerton Colliery is not mentioned at all.{{sfn|Haynes|1920|loc=Tables}}\n\nThe 1920 Working Time Table shows no Goods (as opposed to mineral) trains or \"Through goods\" trains booked to call at or pass Great Broughton in either direction.{{sfn|Haynes|1920|loc=Tables}}\n\n==Rundown and closure==\nThe West Cumberland iron and steel industry was heavily dependent on supplies of coke from the Northumberland and Durham coalfields. The Northern Extension allowed \"a large proportion\" of this traffic to be routed away from Maryport and the coastal line. Likewise the short chord between Workington Bridge and Cloffocks Junction allowed Durham coke traffic to reach the furnaces via {{rws|Cockermouth}} then the C&WJR.{{sfn|McGowan Gradon|2004|loc=p.11, Note 8}} These must have suffered a significant decline, as by 1920 there were just two booked mineral workings each way each weekday between Linefoot and Workington through Great Broughton.{{sfn|Haynes|1920|loc=Tables}} It is therefore no surprise that the line north of Buckhill Colliery closed on 1 September 1921, closing Great Broughton and its residual goods traffic with it.{{sfn|McGowan Gradon|2004|p=59}}\n\nThe final stationmaster at Great Broughton was Joseph W Allason who retired, aged 78, on closure of the station after 42 years service.{{sfn|McGowan Gradon|2004|p=69}}\n\n==Afterlife==\nThe trtack was lifted before the [[Second World War]].

It follows his fourteen-year exile to the forest by his father King [[Dasharatha]], on request of his step-mother [[Kaikeyi]]. His travels across forests in India with his wife [[Sita]] and brother [[Lakshmana]], the kidnapping of his wife by [[Ravana]], the great king of [[Lanka]], resulting in a war with him, and Ram's eventual return to [[Ayodhya]] to be crowned king. This is the culmination point of the epic. It is the most sacred book, and is read by millions of people every year. \n\nThere have been many attempts to unravel the epic's historical growth and compositional layers; various recent scholars' estimates for the earliest stage of the text range from the 7th to 4th centuries BCE, with later stages extending up to the 3rd century CE.<ref name=\"Brockington1998\">{{cite book|author=J.

It consists of nearly 24,000 [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] (mostly set in the [[Shloka]]/[[Anustubh]] meter), divided into six Kands (Adi (Bala) Kand, Ayodhya Kand, Aranya Kand, Kishkindha Kand, Sundara Kand, Lanka Kand) and about 500 sargas (chapters). Uttar kand which is also read today in ramayan is a part of kakbhusundi garud samvad and is not a part of original valkimi ramayan <ref>https://valmikiramayan.net/</ref>. In [[Hindu]] tradition, it is considered to be the ''Adi-kavya'' (first poem). It depicts the duties of relationships, portraying ideal characters like the ideal father, the ideal servant, the ideal brother, the ideal husband and the ideal king. ''Ramayana'' was an important influence on later [[Sanskrit]] poetry and Hindu life and culture. Like ''Mahabharata'', ''Ramayana'' presents the teachings of ancient Hindu sages in narrative [[allegory]], interspersing philosophical and ethical elements. The characters [[Rama]], [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]], [[Hanuman]],  and [[Ravana]] are all fundamental to the cultural consciousness of the [[South Asian]] nations of [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], and the [[South-East Asian]] countries of [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Indonesia]].\n\nThere are many [[Versions of Ramayana|versions of ''Ramayana'']] in Indian languages, besides Buddhist, Sikh, and [[Rama in Jainism|Jain]] adaptations. There are also [[Cambodia]]n, [[Indonesia]]n, [[Philippines|Filipino]], [[Thailand|Thai]], [[Laos|Lao]], [[Myanmar|Burmese]], and [[Malaysia]]n versions of the tale.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe name ''Ramayana'' means \"Rama\" + \"Aayana\" , where as Rama is name of Lord or God and Aayana means Path or Way. The literal meaning of the name is \"the journey of R\u0101ma\" or \"the career of R\u0101ma\" or in other words path or way taken or chosen by Rama during the human life cycle form at earth, during [[Hindu units of time|Treta Yuga]] [[Hindu units of time|(869000 years ago)]] in Jambudweep(Java Plum)/Aryavart/India.<ref>Robert Goldman and Sally Sutherland Goldman, 'R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a', in ''Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism'', ed. by Knut A.

The text survives in several thousand partial and complete manuscripts, the oldest of which is a [[palm-leaf manuscript]] found in Nepal and dated to the 11th century CE. A Times of India report dated 18 December 2015 informs about the discovery of a 6th-century manuscript of the ''Ramayana'' at the Asiatic Society library, [[Kolkata]].<ref name=\"Dasa Griba Rakshash Charitram Vadha\">{{cite news|last1=Mukherjee Pandey|first1=Jhimli|title=6th-century Ramayana found in Kolkata, stuns scholars|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/6th-century-Ramayana-found-in-Kolkata-stuns-scholars/articleshow/50227724.cms|accessdate=20 December 2015|agency=TNN|newspaper=timesofindia.indiatimes.com|date=18 Dec 2015 <!-- 09.08AM IST --> }}</ref> The ''Ramayana'' text has several regional renderings, recensions and sub recensions. Textual scholar [[Robert P. Goldman]] differentiates two major regional revisions: the northern (n) and the southern (s). Scholar [[Romesh Chunder Dutt]] writes that \"the ''Ramayana'', like the ''Mahabharata'', is a growth of centuries, but the main story is more distinctly the creation of one mind.\"\n\nThere has been discussion as to whether the first and the last volumes (Bala Kand and Uttara Kand) of Valmiki's ''Ramayana'' were composed by the original author. Most Hindus still believe they are integral parts of the book, in spite of some style differences and narrative contradictions between these two volumes and the rest of the book.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nRetellings include [[Kambar (poet)|Kamban]]'s ''[[Ramavataram]]'' in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] (c. 11th\u201312th century), [[Gona Budda Reddy]]'s ''Ramayanam'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] (c. 13th century), [[Madhava Kandali]]'s [[Saptakanda Ramayana]] in [[Assamese language|Assamese]] (c. 14th century), [[Krittibas Ojha]]'s [[Krittivasi Ramayan]] (also known as ''Shri Ram Panchali'') in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] (c. 15th century), [[Sarala Das]]' [[Vilanka Ramayana]] (c. 15th century)<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=The History of Medieval Vaishnavism in Orissa|author=Mukherjee, P.|date=1981|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=9788120602298|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7LFzfbhmJcMC&pg=PA74|page=74|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"google2\">{{cite book|title=Living Thoughts of the Ramayana|date=2002|publisher=Jaico Publishing House|isbn=9788179920022|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BMyxwk5g3NEC&pg=PT7|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"google3\">{{cite book|title=A Critical Inventory of R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a Studies in the World: Foreign languages|author1=Krishnamoorthy, K.|author2=Mukhopadhyay, S.|author3=Sahitya Akademi|date=1991|publisher=Sahitya Akademi in collaboration with Union Academique Internationale, Bruxelles|isbn=9788172015077|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NgeTtWkD0VkC&pg=PR27|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"google4\">{{cite book|title=R\u0101makath\u0101 and Other Essays|author1=Bulcke, C.|author2=Pras\u0101da, D.|date=2010|publisher=Vani Prakashan|isbn=9789350001073|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cvE4wF-cfX0C&pg=PA116|page=116|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref> and Balarama Dasa's ''Dandi Ramayana'' (also known as the ''Jagamohan Ramayana'') (c. 16th century) both in [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Sant (religion)|sant]] [[Eknath]]'s [[Bhavarth Ramayan]] (c. 16th century) in [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Tulsidas]]' [[Ramcharitamanas]] (c. 16th century) in [[Awadhi]] (which is an eastern form of [[Hindi]]) and [[Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan]]'s [[Adhyathmaramayanam]] in [[Malayalam]].\n\n==Period==\n\n[[File:Avatars.jpg|thumb|Rama (left third from top) depicted in the [[Dashavatara]], the ten avatars of [[Vishnu]]. Painting from [[Jaipur]], now at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]]]\n\nIn terms of narrative time, the action of the ''Ramayana'' predates the ''[[Mahabharata]]''. However, the general cultural background of the ''Ramayana'' is one of the post-[[urbanization]] periods of the eastern part of north [[India]], while the ''Mahabharata'' reflects the Kuru areas west of this, from the [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] to the late [[Vedas|Vedic]] period.\n\nBy tradition, the text belongs to the [[Treta Yuga]], second of the four eons ([[Yuga]]) of [[Hindu]] chronology. [[Rama]] is said to have been born in the [[Hindu units of time|Treta Yuga (869000 years ago)]] to king [[Dasharatha]] in the [[Ikshvaku dynasty]].\n\nThe names of the characters (Rama, Sita, Dasharatha, [[Janaka]], [[Vashista]], [[Vishwamitra]]) are all known only in the late [[Vedic]] literature.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} For instance, a king named Janaka appears in a lengthy dialogue in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad '']] with no reference to Rama or the ''Ramayana''.<ref>''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad ''4:1:1; trans. Swami Prabhavananda, commentary by Abbot George Burke (Swami Nirmalananda Giri), online at https://ocoy.org/dharma-for-christians/upanishads-for-awakening/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad/janaka-and-yajnavalkya-1/</ref> However, nowhere in the surviving Vedic poetry is there a story similar to the ''Ramayana of Valmiki''. According to the modern [[academic]] view, [[Vishnu]], who, according to [[Bala Kanda]], was incarnated as [[Rama]], first came into prominence with the epics themselves and further, during the puranic period of the later 1st millennium CE. Also, in the epic Mahabharata, there is a version of the ''Ramayana'' known as ''Ramopakhyana''.

Once, Kaikeyi saved Dasaratha in a war and as a reward, she got the privilege from Dasaratha to fulfil two of her wishes at any time of her lifetime. She made use of the opportunity and forced Dasharatha to make their son Bharata crown prince and send Rama into exile for 14 years.

This blood was collected in a pot and was buried in Earth, so She is called the daughter of Mother Earth, adopted by King Janaka, and Rama's beloved wife. Rama went to [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] and got a chance to marry her by breaking the Shiv Dhanush (bow) while trying to tie a knot to it in a competition organized by King Janaka of [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]]. The competition was to find the most suitable husband for Sita and many princes from different states competed to win her. Sita is the [[avatar]] of goddess [[Lakshmi]], the consort of Vishnu. Sita is portrayed as the epitome of female purity and virtue. She follows her husband into exile and is abducted by the Lanka's king Ravana. She is imprisoned on the island of [[Lanka]], until Rama rescues her by defeating Ravana.

Dasharatha was the King of Ayodhya. He had three wives: Kaushalya, Kaikeyi and Sumitra. He was childless for a long time and anxious to have an heir, so he performs a fire sacrifice known as ''Putra-kameshti Yajna''. As a consequence, Rama was first born to Kaushalya, Bharata was born to Kaikeyi, Lakshmana and Shatrughna were born to Sumitra. These sons are endowed, to various degrees, with the essence of the Supreme Trinity Entity [[Vishnu]]; Vishnu had opted to be born into mortality to combat the demon [[Ravana]], who was oppressing the gods, and who could only be destroyed by a mortal. The boys were reared as the princes of the realm, receiving instructions from the scriptures and in warfare from Vashistha. When Rama was 16 years old, sage Vishwamitra comes to the court of Dasharatha in search of help against demons who were disturbing sacrificial rites. He chooses Rama, who is followed by Lakshmana, his constant companion throughout the story. Rama and Lakshmana receive instructions and supernatural weapons from Vishwamitra and proceed to destroy [[Tataka]] and many other demons.\n\n[[Janaka]] was the King of [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]]. One day, a female child was found in the field by the King in the deep furrow dug by his plough. Overwhelmed with joy, the King regarded the child as a \"miraculous gift of God\". The child was named Sita, the Sanskrit word for furrow. Sita grew up to be a girl of unparalleled beauty and charm. The King had decided that who ever could lift and wield the heavy bow, presented to his ancestors by [[Shiva]], could marry Sita. Sage Vishwamitra takes Rama and Lakshmana to Mithila to show the bow. Then Rama desires to lift it and goes on to wield the bow and when he draws the string, it broke.<ref>{{cite book|title=CANTO LXVII.: THE BREAKING OF THE BOW.|publisher=sacredtexts.com|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rama/ry067.htm|accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref> Marriages were arranged between the sons of Dasharatha and daughters of Janaka. Rama marries Sita, [[Lakshmana]] to [[Urmila]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]] to [[Mandavi]] and [[Shatrughna]] to [[Shrutakirti]].

On the eve of the great event, Kaikeyi \u2013 her jealousy aroused by [[Manthara]], a wicked maidservant \u2013 claims two boons that Dasharatha had long ago granted her. Kaikeyi demands Rama to be exiled into the wilderness for fourteen years, while the succession passes to her son Bharata. The heartbroken king, constrained by his rigid devotion to his given word, accedes to Kaikeyi's demands. Rama accepts his father's reluctant decree with absolute submission and calm self-control which characterises him throughout the story. He is joined by Sita and Lakshmana. When he asks Sita not to follow him, she says, \"the forest where you dwell is Ayodhya for me and Ayodhya without you is a veritable hell for me.\" After Ram's departure, King Dasharatha, unable to bear the grief, passes away. Meanwhile, Bharata who was on a visit to his maternal uncle, learns about the events in Ayodhya. Bharata refuses to profit from his mother's wicked scheming and visits Rama in the forest. He requests Rama to return and rule. But Rama, determined to carry out his father's orders to the letter, refuses to return before the period of exile.\n[[File:Rama leaving for fourteen years of exile from Ayodhya.jpg|thumb|800px|center|<center>Rama leaving for fourteen years of exile from Ayodhya.</center>]]\n\n===''Aranya Kanda''===\n\n{{Main|Aranya Kanda}}\n\n[[File:Ravi Varma-Ravana Sita Jathayu.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ravana]] fights [[Jatayu]] as he carries off the kidnapped Sita.

At the [[Panchavati]] forest they are visited by a [[rakshasi]] named [[Shurpanakha]], sister of Ravana. She tries to seduce the brothers and, after failing, attempts to kill Sita. Lakshmana stops her by cutting off her nose and ears. Hearing of this, her brothers [[Khara (Ramayana)|Khara]] and Dushan organise an attack against the princes. Rama defeats Khara and his raskshasas.\n\nWhen the news of these events reach Ravana, he resolves to destroy Rama by capturing Sita with the aid of the ''rakshasa'' [[Maricha]]. Maricha, assuming the form of a golden deer, captivates Sita's attention. Entranced by the beauty of the deer, Sita pleads with Rama to capture it. Rama, aware that this is the ploy of the demons, cannot dissuade Sita from her desire and chases the deer into the forest, leaving Sita under Lakshmana's guard. After some time, Sita hears Rama calling out to her; afraid for his life, she insists that Lakshmana rush to his aid. Lakshmana tries to assure her that Rama cannot be hurt that easily and that it is best if he continues to follow Ram's orders to protect her. On the verge of hysterics, Sita insists that it is not she but Rama who needs Lakshman's help. He obeys her wish but stipulates that she is not to leave the cottage or entertain any stranger. He draws a chalk outline, the [[Lakshmana rekha|Lakshmana rekha]], around the cottage and casts a spell on it that prevents anyone from entering the boundary but allows people to exit. With the coast finally clear, Ravana appears in the guise of an ascetic requesting Sita's hospitality. Unaware of her guest's plan, Sita is tricked into leaving the rekha and is then forcibly carried away by Ravana.<ref>Rajarajan, R.K.K.

At Lanka, Sita is kept under the guard of ''rakshasis''. Ravana asks Sita to marry him, but she refuses, being eternally devoted to Rama.

Rama and Lakshmana meet Hanuman, the biggest devotee of Rama, greatest of ape heroes and an adherent of [[Sugriva]], the banished pretender to the throne of Kishkindha. Rama befriends Sugriva and helps him by killing his elder brother [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] thus regaining the kingdom of Kishkindha, in exchange for helping Rama to recover Sita. However Sugriva soon forgets his promise and spends his time in enjoying his powers. The clever former ape queen [[Tara (Ramayana)|Tara]] (wife of Vali) calmly intervenes to prevent an enraged Lakshmana from destroying the ape citadel. She then eloquently convinces Sugriva to honour his pledge. Sugriva then sends search parties to the four corners of the earth, only to return without success from north, east and west.

After learning about Sita, Hanuman [[shapeshifting|assumes]] a gargantuan form and makes a colossal leap across the sea to Lanka. On the way he meets with many challenges like facing a Gandharva kanya who comes in the form of a demon to test his abilities. He encounters a mountain named Mainakudu who offers Hanuman assistance and offers him rest. Hanuman refuses because there is little time remaining to complete the search for Sita.\n\nAfter entering into Lanka, he finds a demon, Lankini, who protects all of Lanka. Hanuman fights with her and subjugates her in order to get into Lanka. In the process Lankini, who had an earlier vision/warning from the gods that the end of Lanka nears if someone defeats Lankini. Here, Hanuman explores the demons' kingdom and spies on Ravana. He locates Sita in Ashoka grove, where she is being wooed and threatened by Ravana and his rakshasis to marry Ravana. Hanuman reassures Sita, giving Ram's signet ring as a sign of good faith. He offers to carry Sita back to Ram; however, she refuses and says that it is not the dharma, stating that Ramyana will not have significance if Hanuman carries her to Rama \u2013 \"When Rama is not there Ravana carried Sita forcibly and when Ravana was not there, Hanuman carried Sita back to Ram\". She says that Rama himself must come and avenge the insult of her abduction.\n\nHanuman then wreaks havoc in Lanka by destroying trees and buildings and killing Ravana's warriors. He allows himself to be captured and delivered to Ravana. He gives a bold lecture to Ravana to release Sita. He is condemned and his tail is set on fire, but he escapes his bonds and leaping from roof to roof, sets fire to Ravana's citadel and makes the giant leap back from the island.

Having received Hanuman's report on Sita, Rama and Lakshmana proceed with their allies towards the shore of the southern sea. There they are joined by Ravana's renegade brother [[Vibhishana]]. The apes named [[Nala]] and [[Nila (Ramayana)|Nila]] construct a floating bridge (known as [[Adam's Bridge|Rama Setu]])<ref>Rajarajan, R.K.K.

The princes and their army cross over to Lanka. A lengthy war ensues. During a battle, Ravana's son [[Indrajit]] hurls a powerful weapon at Lakshmana, who is badly wounded. So Hanuman assumes a gigantic form and flies from Lanka to the Himalayas. Upon reaching Mount Sumeru, Hanuman was unable to identify the herb that could cure Lakshmana and so decided to bring the entire mountain back to Lanka. Eventually, the war ends when Rama kills Ravana. Rama then installs Vibhishana on the throne of Lanka.\n\nOn meeting Sita, Rama asks her to undergo an Agni Pariksha (test of fire) to prove her chastity, as he wants to get rid of the rumors surrounding her purity. When Sita plunges into the sacrificial fire, [[Agni]], lord of fire raises Sita, unharmed, to the throne, attesting to her innocence. The episode of ''Agni Pariksha'' varies in the versions of Ramayana by Valmiki and [[Tulsidas]]. In [[Tulsidas]]'s [[Ramacharitamanas]], Sita was under the protection of Agni (see [[Maya Sita|Maya Sita]]) so it was necessary to bring her out before reuniting with Rama.\n\n=== ''Uttara Kanda'' ===\nUttara Kanda is the last book of Ramayana. It is a book of kakbhusundi-garud samvad. This book was added by tulsidas as tulsidas listened the ramayan from kakbhusundi and garud .It depicts Ram's reign of [[Ayodhya (Ramayana)|Ayodhya]], birth of [[Lava (Ramayana)|Luv]] and [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kush]], the [[Ashvamedha]] [[yajna]] and last days of Rama. At the expiration of his term of exile, Rama returns to Ayodhya with Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman, where the coronation is performed. On being asked to prove his devotion to Rama, Hanuman tears his chest open and to everyone's surprise, there is an image of Rama and Sita inside his chest. Rama rules Ayodhya and the reign is called 'Ram-rajya' (a place where the common folk are happy, fulfilled and satisfied).\n\n=== ''Luv kush Kanda'' ===\nThis is a kanda which was not written in original valmiki ramayan and nor by tulsidas.<ref>https://valmikiramayan.net/</ref>\nThis is totally an chapter added afterwards and no authentication of this chapter is seen in original ramayana of tulsidas and valmiki. \nIn this Chapter as time passes in reign of rama, spies start getting rumours that people are questioning Sita's purity as she stayed in the home of another man for a year without her husband. The common folk start gossiping about Sita and question Ram's decision to make her Queen. Rama is extremely distraught on hearing the news, but finally tells Lakshmana that \"Purity of the Queen of Ayodhya has to be above any gossip and rumour. Take Sita to a forest outside Ayodhya and leave her there. Also tell her not to identify herself as the Queen of Ayodhya as that would be an insult to our forefathers\". Lakshmana reluctantly drops Sita in a forest for another exile.\n\nSita finds refuge in Sage [[Valmiki]]'s ashRama, where she gives birth to twin boys, Luv and Kush. [[Shambuka]], a [[shudra]] ascetic, is slain by Rama for attempting to perform penance. This act of Shambuka is perceived by Rama as an act in violation of [[dharma]] as he believes that the bad [[karma]], resulting from this act, caused the death of a [[Brahmin]]'s son in his kingdom.<ref>Government of Maharashtra, ''Nasik District Gazeteer: History - Ancient Period'' {{cite web |url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/nasik/005%20History/001%20AncientPeriod.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107163101/http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/nasik/005%20History/001%20AncientPeriod.htm |archivedate=7 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }} (text credited to Mahamahopadhyaya Dr. V.

Luv and Kusha capture the horse (sign of the yajna) and defeat the whole army of Ayodhya which come to protect the horse. Later on, both the brothers defeat [[Lakshmana]], Bharat, Shatrughan and other warriors and take Hanuman as prisoner. Finally Rama himself arrives and defeats the 2 mighty brothers. Valmiki updates Sita about this development and advises both the brothers to go to Ayodhya and tell the story of Sita's sacrifice to the common folks. Both brothers arrive at Ayodhya but face many difficulties while convincing the people. Hanuman helps both the brothers in this task . At one point of time, Valmiki brings Sita forward. Seeing Sita, Rama realises that Luv and Kush are his own sons. Again complicit Nagarsen (One of the primaries who instigated the hatred towards Sita) challenged Sita's character and asked her to prove her purity. Sita is overflown with emotions and decides to go back to the mother earth from where she emerged. She prays to [[Bh\u016bmi|Bhoomidevi]] (Goddess of Earth), the ground breaks into half and closes after Sita vanishes into it. Rama rules Ayodhya for many years and finally takes samadhi into River [[Sarayu]] along with his 3 brothers and leaves the world.

In particular, the ''Ramayana'' related in north India differs in important respects from that preserved in south India and the rest of southeast Asia. There is an extensive tradition of oral storytelling based on ''Ramayana'' in [[Indonesia]], [[Cambodia]], [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Maldives]].\n\n===India===\nThere are diverse regional versions of the ''Ramayana'' written by various authors in India. Some of them differ significantly from each other. During the 12th century, [[Kambar (poet)|Kamban]] wrote [[Ramavataram]], known popularly as [[Kambaramayanam]] in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], but references to [[Ramayana in Tamil literature|Ramayana story appear in Tamil literature]] as early as 300 BC. A [[Telugu language|Telugu]] version, [[Ranganatha Ramayanam]], was written by [[Gona Budda Reddy]] in the 14th century. The earliest translation to a regional Indo-Aryan language is the early 14th century [[Saptakanda Ramayana]] in [[Assamese language|Assamese]] by [[Madhava Kandali]]. Valmiki's ''Ramayana'' inspired [[Sri Ramacharit Manas]] by [[Tulsidas]] in 1576, an epic [[Awadhi]] (a dialect of Hindi) version with a slant more grounded in a different realm of Hindu literature, that of [[bhakti]]; it is an acknowledged masterpiece of India, popularly known as ''Tulsi-krita Ramayana''. [[Gujarat]]i poet Premanand wrote a version of the ''Ramayana'' in the 17th century. Other versions include [[Krittivasi Ramayan]], a [[Bengali language|Bengali]] version by [[Krittibas Ojha]] in the 15th century; [[Vilanka Ramayana]] by 15th century poet [[Sarala Dasa]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC|publisher=Infobase Publishing|date=1 January 2006|isbn=9780816075645|first=Constance|last=Jones|first2=James D.|last2=Ryan}}</ref> and ''[[Dandi Ramayana]]'' (also known as ''[[Jagamohana Ramayana]]'') by 16th century poet Balarama Dasa, both in [[Odia language|Odia]]; a Torave Ramayana in [[Kannada]] by 16th-century poet Narahari; [[Adhyathmaramayanam]], a [[Malayalam]] version by [[Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan]] in the 16th century; in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] by Sridhara in the 18th century; in [[Maithili language|Maithili]] by Chanda Jha in the 19th century; and in the 20th century, Rashtrakavi [[Kuvempu]]'s [[Sri Ramayana Darshanam]] in [[Kannada]].\n\nThere is a sub-plot to the ''Ramayana'', prevalent in some parts of India, relating the adventures of [[Ahiravan]] and Mahi Ravana, evil brother of Ravana, which enhances the role of Hanuman in the story. Hanuman rescues Rama and Lakshmana after they are kidnapped by the Ahi-Mahi Ravana at the behest of Ravana and held prisoner in a cave, to be sacrificed to the goddess [[Kali]]. [[Adbhuta Ramayana]] is a version that is obscure but also attributed to [[Valmiki]] \u2013 intended as a supplementary to the original [[Valmiki Ramayana]]. In this variant of the narrative, Sita is accorded far more prominence, such as elaboration of the events surrounding her birth \u2013 in this case to [[Ravana]]'s wife, [[Mandodari]] as well as her conquest of Ravana's older brother in the [[Mahakali]] form.\n\n====Early references in Tamil literature====\n{{main|Ramayana in Tamil literature}}\nEven before [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]] wrote the [[Ramavataram]] in Tamil in the 12th century AD, there are many ancient references to the story of Ramayana, implying that the story was familiar in the Tamil lands even before the Common Era.

Rama (called R\u0101mapa\u1e47\u1e0dita in this version) was the son of Kaushalya, first wife of Dasharatha. Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a (Lakkha\u1e47a) was a sibling of Rama and son of Sumitra, the second wife of Dasharatha.  Sita was the wife of Rama. To protect his children from his wife Kaikeyi, who wished to promote her son Bharata, Dasharatha sent the three to a hermitage in the Himalayas for a twelve-year exile. After nine years, Dasharatha died and Lakkha\u1e47a and Sita returned; R\u0101mapa\u1e47\u1e0dita, in deference to his father's wishes, remained in exile for a further two years. This version does not include the abduction of S\u012bt\u0101.There is no Ravan in this version i.e. no Ram-ravan war.\n\nIn the explanatory commentary on J\u0101taka, R\u0101mapa\u1e47\u1e0dita is said to have been a previous incarnation of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and Sita an incarnation of [[Yasodhar\u0101]].\n\nBut, [[Ravana]] appears in other Buddhist literature, the [[Lankavatara Sutra]].\n\n====Jain version====\n\n{{main|Rama in Jainism|Salakapurusa}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n[[Jain]] versions of the ''Ramayana'' can be found in the various [[Jain agama (disambiguation)|Jain agama]]s like Ravisena's [[Padma Purana|Padmapurana]] (story of Padmaja and [[Rama]], Padmaja being the name of [[Sita]]), [[Hemacandra]]'s [[Salakapurusa|Trisastisalakapurusa charitra]] (hagiography of 63 illustrious persons), Sanghadasa's ''Vasudevahindi'' and ''Uttarapurana'' by Gunabhadara. According to [[Jain cosmology]], every [[Kalachakra (Jainism)|half time cycle]] has nine sets of [[Balarama]], [[Vasudeva]] and prativasudeva. Rama, [[Lakshmana]] and [[Ravana]] are the eighth [[Balarama|baladeva]], [[vasudeva]] and [[prativasudeva]] respectively. [[Padmanabh Jaini]] notes that, unlike in the Hindu Puranas, the names Baladeva and Vasudeva are not restricted to [[Balarama]] and [[Krishna]] in Jain Puranas. Instead they serve as names of two distinct classes of mighty brothers, who appear nine times in each half time cycle and jointly rule half the earth as half-[[chakravartin]]s. Jaini traces the origin of this list of brothers to the ''jinacharitra'' (lives of jinas) by [[Acharya Bhadrabahu]] (3d\u20134th century BCE).\n\nIn the Jain epic of ''Ramayana'', it is not Rama who kills Ravana as told in the Hindu version. Perhaps this is because Rama, a liberated Jain Soul in his last life, is unwilling to kill.<ref name=\"A.K\">{{cite book|last1=Ramanujan|first1=A.K|title=The Collected Essays of A.K. Ramanujan|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New Delhi|page=145|edition=4. impr.|url=http://www.trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/three-hundred-Ramayanas-A-K-Ramanujan.pdf}}</ref> Instead, it is Lakshmana who kills Ravana.<ref name=\"A.K\"/> In the end, Rama, who led an upright life, renounces his kingdom, becomes a [[Jain monasticism|Jain monk]] and attains [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]]. On the other hand, Lakshmana and Ravana go to [[Naraka (Jainism)|Hell]]. However, it is predicted that ultimately they both will be reborn as upright persons and attain liberation in their future births. According to [[Jain texts]], Ravana will be the future [[Tirthankara]] (omniscient teacher) of Jainism.\n\nThe Jain versions have some variations from Valmiki's ''Ramayana''. Dasharatha, the king of Saketa had four queens: Aparajita, Sumitra, Suprabha and Kaikeyi. These four queens had four sons. Aparajita's son was Padma and he became known by the name of Rama. Sumitra's son was Narayana: he came to be known by another name, lakshmana. Kaikeyi's son was Bharata and Suprabha's son was Shatrughna. Furthermore, not much was thought of Ram's fidelity to Sita. According to the Jain version, Rama had four chief queens: Maithili, Prabhavati, Ratinibha, and Sridama. Furthermore, Sita takes renunciation as a Jain ascetic after Rama abandons her and is reborn in heaven. Rama, after lakshman's death, also renounces his kingdom and becomes a Jain monk. Ultimately, he attains [[Kevala Jnana]] omniscience and finally liberation. Rama predicts that Ravana and Lakshmana, who were in the [[Naraka (Jainism)|fourth hell]], will attain liberation in their future births. Accordingly, Ravana is the future tirthankara of the next half ascending time cycle and Sita will be his [[Ganadhara]].\n\n====Sikh version====\n\nIn [[Guru Granth Sahib]], there is a description of two types of ''Ramayana''. One is a spiritual ''Ramayana'' which is the actual subject of Guru Granth Sahib, in which Ravana is ego, Sita is ''budhi'' (intellect), Rama is inner soul and Laxman is ''mann'' (attention, mind). Guru Granth Sahib also believes in the existence of [[Dashavatara]] who were kings of their times which tried their best to restore order to the world. King Rama (Ramchandra) was one of those who is not covered in Guru Granth Sahib. Guru Granth Sahib states:\n:\u0a39\u0a41\u0a15\u0a2e\u0a3f \u0a09\u0a2a\u0a3e\u0a0f \u0a26\u0a38 \u0a05\u0a09\u0a24\u0a3e\u0a30\u0a3e\u0965\n:\u0939\u0941\u0915\u092e\u093f \u0909\u092a\u093e\u090f \u0926\u0938 \u0905\u0909\u0924\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0965\n:By [[hukam]] (supreme command), he created his ten incarnations\nThis version of the ''Ramayana'' was written by [[Guru Gobind Singh]], which is part of [[Dasam Granth]].\n\nHe also said that the almighty, invisible, all prevailing God created great numbers of Indras, Moons and Suns, Deities, Demons and sages, and also numerous saints and Brahmanas (enlightened people). But they too were caught in the noose of death (Kaal) ([[transmigration of the soul]]). This is similar to the explanation in [[Bhagavad Gita]] which is part of the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.<ref>[https://www.bhagavad-gita.us/bhagavad-gita-11-32/ Bhagavad Gita 11.32]</ref>\n\n===Nepal===\n\nBesides being the site of discovery of the oldest surviving manuscript of the ''Ramayana'', Nepal gave rise to two regional variants in mid 19th \u2013 early 20th century. One, written by [[Bhanubhakta Acharya]], is considered the first epic of [[Nepali language]], while the other, written by [[Siddhidas Mahaju]] in [[Nepal Bhasa]] was a foundational influence in the [[Nepal Bhasa renaissance]].\n\n[[Bhanubhakta Ramayana|Ramayana]] written by [[Bhanubhakta Acharya]] is one of the most popular verses in Nepal. The popularization of the ''Ramayana'' and its tale, originally written in [[Sanskrit Language]] was greatly enhanced by the work of Bhanubhakta. Mainly because of his writing of Nepali Ramayana, Bhanubhakta is also called ''Aadi Kavi'' or ''The Pioneering Poet''.\n\n===Southeast Asian===\n\n====Cambodia====\n\n[[File:Sita Ravana Cambodia.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cambodian classical dancers as Sita and Ravana, the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh (c. 1920s)]]\nThe Cambodian version of the ''Ramayana'', [[Reamker]] ({{lang-km|\u179a\u17b6\u1798\u1780\u17c1\u179a\u17d2\u178a\u17b7\u17cd}} - ''Glory of Ram''), is the most famous story of Khmer literature since the [[Kingdom of Funan]] era. It adapts the Hindu concepts to Buddhist themes and shows the balance of good and evil in the world. The Reamker has several differences from the original ''Ramayana'', including scenes not included in the original and emphasis on [[Hanuman]] and [[Sovanna Maccha]], a retelling which influences the Thai and Lao versions. Reamker in Cambodia is not confined to the realm of literature but extends to all Cambodian art forms, such as sculpture, [[Khmer classical dance]], [[Theatre of Cambodia|theatre]] known as ''lakhorn luang'' (the foundation of the royal ballet), poetry and the mural and bas-reliefs seen at the [[Silver Pagoda]] and [[Angkor Wat]].\n\n====Indonesia====\n\n[[File:Ramayana Java.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Lakshmana]], Rama and Sita during their exile in [[Dandaka Forest]] depicted in [[Javanese dance]]]]\nThere are several Indonesian adaptations of Ramayana, including the Javanese ''[[Kakawin Ramayana]]''<ref>{{cite web |title=Ramayana Kakawin Vol. 1 | work=archive.org | url=https://archive.org/details/RamayanaKakawinVol.1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/b0274d0f-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad|title=The Kakawin Ramayana -- an old Javanese rendering of the  \u2026|website=www.nas.gov.sg|access-date=2017-12-13}}</ref> and Balinese ''Ramakavaca''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DN4xDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA277&lpg=PA277&dq=ramakavaca+Bali&source=bl&ots=0D7IBVmozt&sig=rVa66uSls2okxDlH5v_BEINcceg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwioxueFvYvYAhUEmJQKHWGNBH8Q6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=ramakavaca%20Bali&f=false|title=ABC of Hinduism|last=Bhalla|first=Prem P.|date=2017-08-22|publisher=Educreation Publishing|page=277|language=en}}</ref> The first half of ''[[Kakawin Ramayana]]'' is similar to the original Sanskrit version, while the latter half is very different.

Each year, many devout pilgrims trace their journey through India and Nepal, halting at each of the holy sites along the way. The poem is not seen as just a literary monument, but serves as an integral part of Hinduism and is held in such reverence that the mere reading or hearing of it or certain passages of it, is believed by Hindus to free them from sin and bless the reader or listener.\n\nAccording to Hindu tradition, Rama is an incarnation ([[Avatar]]) of god [[Vishnu]]. The main purpose of this incarnation is to demonstrate the righteous path ([[dharma]]) for all living creatures on earth.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\nMultiple modern, English-language adaptations of the epic exist, namely [[Scion of Ikshvaku|Rama Chandra Series]] by [[Amish Tripathi]], [[Ashok Banker#Ramayana Series|Ramayana Series]] by [[Ashok Banker]] and a mythopoetic novel, ''Asura: Tale of the Vanquished'' by [[Anand Neelakantan]].

It consists of nearly 24,000 [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] (mostly set in the [[Shloka]]/[[Anustubh]] meter), divided into six Kands (Adi (Bala) Kand, Ayodhya Kand, Aranya Kand, Kishkindha Kand, Sundara Kand, Lanka Kand) and about 500 sargas (chapters). Uttar kand which is also read today in ramayan is a part of kakbhusundi garud samvad and is not a part of original valkimi ramayan <ref>https://valmikiramayan.net/</ref>. In [[Hindu]] tradition, it is considered to be the ''Adi-kavya'' (first poem). It depicts the duties of relationships, portraying ideal characters like the ideal father, the ideal servant, the ideal brother, the ideal husband and the ideal king. ''Ramayana'' was an important influence on later [[Sanskrit]] poetry and Hindu life and culture. Like ''Mahabharata'', ''Ramayana'' presents the teachings of ancient Hindu sages in narrative [[allegory]], interspersing philosophical and ethical elements. The characters [[Rama]], [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]], [[Hanuman]],  and [[Ravana]] are all fundamental to the cultural consciousness of the [[South Asian]] nations of [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], and the [[South-East Asian]] countries of [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Indonesia]].\n\nThere are many [[Versions of Ramayana|versions of ''Ramayana'']] in Indian languages, besides Buddhist, Sikh, and [[Rama in Jainism|Jain]] adaptations. There are also [[Cambodia]]n, [[Indonesia]]n, [[Philippines|Filipino]], [[Thailand|Thai]], [[Laos|Lao]], [[Myanmar|Burmese]], and [[Malaysia]]n versions of the tale.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe name ''Ramayana'' means \"Rama\" + \"Aayana\" , where as Rama is name of Lord or God and Aayana means Path or Way.

Rama went to [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] and got a chance to marry her by breaking the Shiv Dhanush (bow) while trying to tie a knot to it in a competition organized by King Janaka of [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]]. The competition was to find the most suitable husband for Sita and many princes from different states competed to win her. Sita is the [[avatar]] of goddess [[Lakshmi]], the consort of Vishnu. Sita is portrayed as the epitome of female purity and virtue. She follows her husband into exile and is abducted by the Lanka's king Ravana.

Dasharatha was the King of Ayodhya. He had three wives: Kaushalya, Kaikeyi and Sumitra. He was childless for a long time and anxious to have an heir, so he performs a fire sacrifice known as ''Putra-kameshti Yajna''. As a consequence, Rama was first born to Kaushalya, Bharata was born to Kaikeyi, Lakshmana and Shatrughna were born to Sumitra. These sons are endowed, to various degrees, with the essence of the Supreme Trinity Entity [[Vishnu]]; Vishnu had opted to be born into mortality to combat the demon [[Ravana]], who was oppressing the gods, and who could only be destroyed by a mortal. The boys were reared as the princes of the realm, receiving instructions from the scriptures and in warfare from Vashistha. When Rama was 16 years old, sage Vishwamitra comes to the court of Dasharatha in search of help against demons who were disturbing sacrificial rites. He chooses Rama, who is followed by Lakshmana, his constant companion throughout the story. Rama and Lakshmana receive instructions and supernatural weapons from Vishwamitra and proceed to destroy the demons: [[Tataka]] and many more.\n\n[[Janaka]] was the King of [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]]. One day, a female child was found in the field by the King in the deep furrow dug by his plough. Overwhelmed with joy, the King regarded the child as a \"miraculous gift of God\". The child was named Sita, the Sanskrit word for furrow. Sita grew up to be a girl of unparalleled beauty and charm. The King had decided that who ever could lift and wield the heavy bow, presented to his ancestors by [[Shiva]], could marry Sita. Sage Vishwamitra takes Rama and Lakshmana to Mithila to show the bow. Then Rama desires to lift it and goes on to wield the bow and when he draws the string, it broke.<ref>{{cite book|title=CANTO LXVII.: THE BREAKING OF THE BOW.|publisher=sacredtexts.com|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rama/ry067.htm|accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref> Marriages were arranged between the sons of Dasharatha and daughters of Janaka.

On the eve of the great event, Kaikeyi \u2013 her jealousy aroused by [[Manthara]], a wicked maidservant \u2013 claims two boons that Dasharatha had long ago granted her. Kaikeyi demands Rama to be exiled into the wilderness for fourteen years, while the succession passes to her son Bharata. The heartbroken king, constrained by his rigid devotion to his given word, accedes to Kaikeyi's demands. Rama accepts his father's reluctant decree with absolute submission and calm self-control which characterises him throughout the story. He is joined by Sita and Lakshmana. When he asks Sita not to follow him, she says, \"the forest where you dwell is Ayodhya for me and Ayodhya without you is a veritable hell for me.\" After Ram's departure, King Dasharatha, unable to bear the grief, passes away. Meanwhile, Bharata who was on a visit to his maternal uncle, learns about the events in Ayodhya. Bharata refuses to profit from his mother's wicked scheming and visits Rama in the forest. He requests Rama to return and rule.

At the [[Panchavati]] forest they are visited by a [[rakshasi]] named [[Shurpanakha]], sister of Ravana. She tries to seduce the brothers and, after failing, attempts to kill Sita. Lakshmana stops her by cutting off her nose and ears. Hearing of this, her brothers [[Khara (Ramayana)|Khara]] and Dushan organise an attack against the princes. Rama defeats Khara and his raskshasas.\n\nWhen the news of these events reach Ravana, he resolves to destroy Rama by capturing Sita with the aid of the ''rakshasa'' [[Maricha]]. Maricha, assuming the form of a golden deer, captivates Sita's attention. Entranced by the beauty of the deer, Sita pleads with Rama to capture it. Rama, aware that this is the ploy of the demons, cannot dissuade Sita from her desire and chases the deer into the forest, leaving Sita under Lakshmana's guard. After some time, Sita hears Rama calling out to her; afraid for his life, she insists that Lakshmana rush to his aid. Lakshmana tries to assure her that Rama cannot be hurt that easily and that it is best if he continues to follow Ram's orders to protect her. On the verge of hysterics, Sita insists that it is not she but Rama who needs Lakshman's help. He obeys her wish but stipulates that she is not to leave the cottage or entertain any stranger. He draws a chalk outline, the [[Lakshmana rekha|Lakshmana rekha]], around the cottage and casts a spell on it that prevents anyone from entering the boundary but allows people to exit. With the coast finally clear, Ravana appears in the guise of an ascetic requesting Sita's hospitality. Unaware of her guest's plan, Sita is tricked into leaving the rekha and is then forcibly carried away by Ravana.<ref>Rajarajan, R.K.K.

Rama befriends Sugriva and helps him by killing his elder brother [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] thus regaining the kingdom of Kishkindha, in exchange for helping Rama to recover Sita.

On the way he meets with many challenges like facing a Gandharva kanya who comes in the form of a demon to test his abilities. He encounters a mountain named Mainakudu who offers Hanuman assistance and offers him rest. Hanuman refuses because there is little time remaining to complete the search for Sita.\n\nAfter entering into Lanka, he finds a demon, Lankini, who protects all of Lanka. Hanuman fights with her and subjugates her in order to get into Lanka. In the process Lankini, who had an earlier vision/warning from the gods that the end of Lanka nears if someone defeats Lankini. Here, Hanuman explores the demons' kingdom and spies on Ravana. He locates Sita in Ashoka grove, where she is being wooed and threatened by Ravana and his rakshasis to marry Ravana. Hanuman reassures Sita, giving Ram's signet ring as a sign of good faith.

The apes named [[Nala]] and [[Nila (Ramayana)|Nila]] construct a floating bridge (known as [[Adam's Bridge|Rama Setu]])<ref>Rajarajan, R.K.K. (2014) Reflections on \"R\u0101ma-Setu\" in South Asian Tradition.

The princes and their army cross over to Lanka. A lengthy war ensues. During a battle, Ravana's son [[Indrajit]] hurls a powerful weapon at Lakshmana, who is badly wounded. So Hanuman assumes a gigantic form and flies from Lanka to the Himalayas. Upon reaching Mount Sumeru, Hanuman was unable to identify the herb that could cure Lakshmana and so decided to bring the entire mountain back to Lanka. Eventually, the war ends when Rama kills Ravana. Rama then installs Vibhishana on the throne of Lanka.\n\nOn meeting Sita, Rama asks her to undergo an Agni Pariksha (test of fire) to prove her chastity, as he wants to get rid of the rumors surrounding her purity. When Sita plunges into the sacrificial fire, [[Agni]], lord of fire raises Sita, unharmed, to the throne, attesting to her innocence. The episode of ''Agni Pariksha'' varies in the versions of Ramayana by Valmiki and [[Tulsidas]]. In [[Tulsidas]]'s [[Ramacharitamanas]], Sita was under the protection of Agni (see [[Maya Sita|Maya Sita]]) so it was necessary to bring her out before reuniting with Rama.\n\n=== ''Uttara Kanda'' ===\nUttara Kanda is the last book of Ramayana. It is a book of kakbhusundi-garud samvad. This book was added by tulsidas as tulsidas listened the ramayan from kakbhusundi and garud .It depicts Ram's reign of [[Ayodhya (Ramayana)|Ayodhya]], birth of [[Lava (Ramayana)|Luv]] and [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kush]], the [[Ashvamedha]] [[yajna]] and last days of Rama. At the expiration of his term of exile, Rama returns to Ayodhya with Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman, where the coronation is performed. On being asked to prove his devotion to Rama, Hanuman tears his chest open and to everyone's surprise, there is an image of Rama and Sita inside his chest. Rama rules Ayodhya and the reign is called 'Ram-rajya' (a place where the common folk are happy, fulfilled and satisfied).\n\n=== ''Luv kush Kanda'' ===\nThis is a kanda which was not written in original valmiki ramayan and nor by tulsidas.<ref>https://valmikiramayan.net/</ref>\nThis is totally an chapter added afterwards and no authentication of this chapter is seen in original ramayana of tulsidas and valmiki. \nIn this Chapter as time passes in reign of rama, spies start getting rumours that people are questioning Sita's purity as she stayed in the home of another man for a year without her husband. The common folk start gossiping about Sita and question Ram's decision to make her Queen. Rama is extremely distraught on hearing the news, but finally tells Lakshmana that \"Purity of the Queen of Ayodhya has to be above any gossip and rumour. Take Sita to a forest outside Ayodhya and leave her there. Also tell her not to identify herself as the Queen of Ayodhya as that would be an insult to our forefathers\". Lakshmana reluctantly drops Sita in a forest for another exile.\n\nSita finds refuge in Sage [[Valmiki]]'s ashRama, where she gives birth to twin boys, Luv and Kush. [[Shambuka]], a [[shudra]] ascetic, is slain by Rama for attempting to perform penance. This act of Shambuka is perceived by Rama as an act in violation of [[dharma]] as he believes that the bad [[karma]], resulting from this act, caused the death of a [[Brahmin]]'s son in his kingdom.<ref>Government of Maharashtra, ''Nasik District Gazeteer: History - Ancient Period'' {{cite web |url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/nasik/005%20History/001%20AncientPeriod.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107163101/http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/nasik/005%20History/001%20AncientPeriod.htm |archivedate=7 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }} (text credited to Mahamahopadhyaya Dr. V.

Luv and Kusha capture the horse (sign of the yajna) and defeat the whole army of Ayodhya which come to protect the horse. Later on, both the brothers defeat [[Lakshmana]], Bharat, Shatrughan and other warriors and take Hanuman as prisoner. Finally Rama himself arrives and defeats the 2 mighty brothers. Valmiki updates Sita about this development and advises both the brothers to go to Ayodhya and tell the story of Sita's sacrifice to the common folks. Both brothers arrive at Ayodhya but face many difficulties while convincing the people. Hanuman helps both the brothers in this task . At one point of time, Valmiki brings Sita forward. Seeing Sita, Rama realises that Luv and Kush are his own sons. Again complicit Nagarsen (One of the primaries who instigated the hatred towards Sita) challenged Sita's character and asked her to prove her purity. Sita is overflown with emotions and decides to go back to the mother earth from where she emerged. She prays to [[Bh\u016bmi|Bhoomidevi]] (Goddess of Earth), the ground breaks into half and closes after Sita vanishes into it. Rama rules Ayodhya for many years and finally takes samadhi into River [[Sarayu]] along with his 3 brothers and leaves the world. He goes back to [[Vaikuntha|Vaikunth]] in his [[Vishnu]] form.\n\n==Versions==\n\n{{see also|Versions of Ramayana}}\n\n[[File:Wat phra keaw ramayana fresco.jpg|thumb|right|The epic story of ''Ramyana'' was adopted by several cultures across Asia.

[[Prambanan]] Trimurti temple near [[Yogyakarta]], [[Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]\n\nAs in many oral epics, multiple versions of the ''Ramayana'' survive. In particular, the ''Ramayana'' related in north India differs in important respects from that preserved in south India and the rest of southeast Asia. There is an extensive tradition of oral storytelling based on ''Ramayana'' in [[Indonesia]], [[Cambodia]], [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Maldives]].\n\n===India===\nThere are diverse regional versions of the ''Ramayana'' written by various authors in India. Some of them differ significantly from each other. During the 12th century, [[Kambar (poet)|Kamban]] wrote [[Ramavataram]], known popularly as [[Kambaramayanam]] in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], but references to [[Ramayana in Tamil literature|Ramayana story appear in Tamil literature]] as early as 300 BC. A [[Telugu language|Telugu]] version, [[Ranganatha Ramayanam]], was written by [[Gona Budda Reddy]] in the 14th century. The earliest translation to a regional Indo-Aryan language is the early 14th century [[Saptakanda Ramayana]] in [[Assamese language|Assamese]] by [[Madhava Kandali]]. Valmiki's ''Ramayana'' inspired [[Sri Ramacharit Manas]] by [[Tulsidas]] in 1576, an epic [[Awadhi]] (a dialect of Hindi) version with a slant more grounded in a different realm of Hindu literature, that of [[bhakti]]; it is an acknowledged masterpiece of India, popularly known as ''Tulsi-krita Ramayana''. [[Gujarat]]i poet Premanand wrote a version of the ''Ramayana'' in the 17th century. Other versions include [[Krittivasi Ramayan]], a [[Bengali language|Bengali]] version by [[Krittibas Ojha]] in the 15th century; [[Vilanka Ramayana]] by 15th century poet [[Sarala Dasa]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC|publisher=Infobase Publishing|date=1 January 2006|isbn=9780816075645|first=Constance|last=Jones|first2=James D.|last2=Ryan}}</ref> and ''[[Dandi Ramayana]]'' (also known as ''[[Jagamohana Ramayana]]'') by 16th century poet Balarama Dasa, both in [[Odia language|Odia]]; a Torave Ramayana in [[Kannada]] by 16th-century poet Narahari; [[Adhyathmaramayanam]], a [[Malayalam]] version by [[Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan]] in the 16th century; in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] by Sridhara in the 18th century; in [[Maithili language|Maithili]] by Chanda Jha in the 19th century; and in the 20th century, Rashtrakavi [[Kuvempu]]'s [[Sri Ramayana Darshanam]] in [[Kannada]].\n\nThere is a sub-plot to the ''Ramayana'', prevalent in some parts of India, relating the adventures of [[Ahiravan]] and Mahi Ravana, evil brother of Ravana, which enhances the role of Hanuman in the story. Hanuman rescues Rama and Lakshmana after they are kidnapped by the Ahi-Mahi Ravana at the behest of Ravana and held prisoner in a cave, to be sacrificed to the goddess [[Kali]]. [[Adbhuta Ramayana]] is a version that is obscure but also attributed to [[Valmiki]] \u2013 intended as a supplementary to the original [[Valmiki Ramayana]]. In this variant of the narrative, Sita is accorded far more prominence, such as elaboration of the events surrounding her birth \u2013 in this case to [[Ravana]]'s wife, [[Mandodari]] as well as her conquest of Ravana's older brother in the [[Mahakali]] form.\n\n====Early references in Tamil literature====\n{{main|Ramayana in Tamil literature}}\nEven before [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]] wrote the [[Ramavataram]] in Tamil in the 12th century AD, there are many ancient references to the story of Ramayana, implying that the story was familiar in the Tamil lands even before the Common Era.

Rama (called R\u0101mapa\u1e47\u1e0dita in this version) was the son of Kaushalya, first wife of Dasharatha. Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a (Lakkha\u1e47a) was a sibling of Rama and son of Sumitra, the second wife of Dasharatha.  Sita was the wife of Rama. To protect his children from his wife Kaikeyi, who wished to promote her son Bharata, Dasharatha sent the three to a hermitage in the Himalayas for a twelve-year exile. After nine years, Dasharatha died and Lakkha\u1e47a and Sita returned; R\u0101mapa\u1e47\u1e0dita, in deference to his father's wishes, remained in exile for a further two years. This version does not include the abduction of S\u012bt\u0101.There is no Ravan in this version i.e. no Ram-ravan war.\n\nIn the explanatory commentary on J\u0101taka, R\u0101mapa\u1e47\u1e0dita is said to have been a previous incarnation of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and Sita an incarnation of [[Yasodhar\u0101]].\n\nBut, [[Ravana]] appears in other Buddhist literature, the [[Lankavatara Sutra]].\n\n====Jain version====\n\n{{main|Rama in Jainism|Salakapurusa}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n[[Jain]] versions of the ''Ramayana'' can be found in the various [[Jain agama (disambiguation)|Jain agama]]s like Ravisena's [[Padma Purana|Padmapurana]] (story of Padmaja and [[Rama]], Padmaja being the name of [[Sita]]), [[Hemacandra]]'s [[Salakapurusa|Trisastisalakapurusa charitra]] (hagiography of 63 illustrious persons), Sanghadasa's ''Vasudevahindi'' and ''Uttarapurana'' by Gunabhadara. According to [[Jain cosmology]], every [[Kalachakra (Jainism)|half time cycle]] has nine sets of [[Balarama]], [[Vasudeva]] and prativasudeva. Rama, [[Lakshmana]] and [[Ravana]] are the eighth [[Balarama|baladeva]], [[vasudeva]] and [[prativasudeva]] respectively. [[Padmanabh Jaini]] notes that, unlike in the Hindu Puranas, the names Baladeva and Vasudeva are not restricted to [[Balarama]] and [[Krishna]] in Jain Puranas. Instead they serve as names of two distinct classes of mighty brothers, who appear nine times in each half time cycle and jointly rule half the earth as half-[[chakravartin]]s. Jaini traces the origin of this list of brothers to the ''jinacharitra'' (lives of jinas) by [[Acharya Bhadrabahu]] (3d\u20134th century BCE).\n\nIn the Jain epic of ''Ramayana'', it is not Rama who kills Ravana as told in the Hindu version. Perhaps this is because Rama, a liberated Jain Soul in his last life, is unwilling to kill.<ref name=\"A.K\">{{cite book|last1=Ramanujan|first1=A.K|title=The Collected Essays of A.K. Ramanujan|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New Delhi|page=145|edition=4. impr.|url=http://www.trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/three-hundred-Ramayanas-A-K-Ramanujan.pdf}}</ref> Instead, it is Lakshmana who kills Ravana.<ref name=\"A.K\"/> In the end, Rama, who led an upright life, renounces his kingdom, becomes a [[Jain monasticism|Jain monk]] and attains [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]]. On the other hand, Lakshmana and Ravana go to [[Naraka (Jainism)|Hell]]. However, it is predicted that ultimately they both will be reborn as upright persons and attain liberation in their future births. According to [[Jain texts]], Ravana will be the future [[Tirthankara]] (omniscient teacher) of Jainism.\n\nThe Jain versions have some variations from Valmiki's ''Ramayana''. Dasharatha, the king of Saketa had four queens: Aparajita, Sumitra, Suprabha and Kaikeyi. These four queens had four sons. Aparajita's son was Padma and he became known by the name of Rama. Sumitra's son was Narayana: he came to be known by another name, lakshmana. Kaikeyi's son was Bharata and Suprabha's son was Shatrughna. Furthermore, not much was thought of Ram's fidelity to Sita. According to the Jain version, Rama had four chief queens: Maithili, Prabhavati, Ratinibha, and Sridama. Furthermore, Sita takes renunciation as a Jain ascetic after Rama abandons her and is reborn in heaven. Rama, after lakshman's death, also renounces his kingdom and becomes a Jain monk. Ultimately, he attains [[Kevala Jnana]] omniscience and finally liberation. Rama predicts that Ravana and Lakshmana, who were in the [[Naraka (Jainism)|fourth hell]], will attain liberation in their future births. Accordingly, Ravana is the future tirthankara of the next half ascending time cycle and Sita will be his [[Ganadhara]].\n\n====Sikh version====\n\nIn [[Guru Granth Sahib]], there is a description of two types of ''Ramayana''. One is a spiritual ''Ramayana'' which is the actual subject of Guru Granth Sahib, in which Ravana is ego, Sita is ''budhi'' (intellect), Rama is inner soul and Laxman is ''mann'' (attention, mind). Guru Granth Sahib also believes in the existence of [[Dashavatara]] who were kings of their times which tried their best to restore order to the world. King Rama (Ramchandra) was one of those who is not covered in Guru Granth Sahib. Guru Granth Sahib states:\n:\u0a39\u0a41\u0a15\u0a2e\u0a3f \u0a09\u0a2a\u0a3e\u0a0f \u0a26\u0a38 \u0a05\u0a09\u0a24\u0a3e\u0a30\u0a3e\u0965\n:\u0939\u0941\u0915\u092e\u093f \u0909\u092a\u093e\u090f \u0926\u0938 \u0905\u0909\u0924\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0965\n:By [[hukam]] (supreme command), he created his ten incarnations\nThis version of the ''Ramayana'' was written by [[Guru Gobind Singh]], which is part of [[Dasam Granth]].\n\nHe also said that the almighty, invisible, all prevailing God created great numbers of Indras, Moons and Suns, Deities, Demons and sages, and also numerous saints and Brahmanas (enlightened people). But they too were caught in the noose of death (Kaal) ([[transmigration of the soul]]). This is similar to the explanation in [[Bhagavad Gita]] which is part of the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.<ref>[https://www.bhagavad-gita.us/bhagavad-gita-11-32/ Bhagavad Gita 11.32]</ref>\n\n===Nepal===\n\nBesides being the site of discovery of the oldest surviving manuscript of the ''Ramayana'', Nepal gave rise to two regional variants in mid 19th \u2013 early 20th century. One, written by [[Bhanubhakta Acharya]], is considered the first epic of [[Nepali language]], while the other, written by [[Siddhidas Mahaju]] in [[Nepal Bhasa]] was a foundational influence in the [[Nepal Bhasa renaissance]].\n\n[[Bhanubhakta Ramayana|Ramayana]] written by [[Bhanubhakta Acharya]] is one of the most popular verses in Nepal. The popularization of the ''Ramayana'' and its tale, originally written in [[Sanskrit Language]] was greatly enhanced by the work of Bhanubhakta. Mainly because of his writing of Nepali Ramayana, Bhanubhakta is also called ''Aadi Kavi'' or ''The Pioneering Poet''.\n\n===Southeast Asian===\n\n====Cambodia====\n\n[[File:Sita Ravana Cambodia.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cambodian classical dancers as Sita and Ravana, the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh (c. 1920s)]]\nThe Cambodian version of the ''Ramayana'', [[Reamker]] ({{lang-km|\u179a\u17b6\u1798\u1780\u17c1\u179a\u17d2\u178a\u17b7\u17cd}} - ''Glory of Ram''), is the most famous story of Khmer literature since the [[Kingdom of Funan]] era. It adapts the Hindu concepts to Buddhist themes and shows the balance of good and evil in the world. The Reamker has several differences from the original ''Ramayana'', including scenes not included in the original and emphasis on [[Hanuman]] and [[Sovanna Maccha]], a retelling which influences the Thai and Lao versions. Reamker in Cambodia is not confined to the realm of literature but extends to all Cambodian art forms, such as sculpture, [[Khmer classical dance]], [[Theatre of Cambodia|theatre]] known as ''lakhorn luang'' (the foundation of the royal ballet), poetry and the mural and bas-reliefs seen at the [[Silver Pagoda]] and [[Angkor Wat]].\n\n====Indonesia====\n\n[[File:Ramayana Java.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Lakshmana]], Rama and Sita during their exile in [[Dandaka Forest]] depicted in [[Javanese dance]]]]\nThere are several Indonesian adaptations of Ramayana, including the Javanese ''[[Kakawin Ramayana]]''<ref>{{cite web |title=Ramayana Kakawin Vol. 1 | work=archive.org | url=https://archive.org/details/RamayanaKakawinVol.1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/b0274d0f-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad|title=The Kakawin Ramayana -- an old Javanese rendering of the  \u2026|website=www.nas.gov.sg|access-date=2017-12-13}}</ref> and Balinese ''Ramakavaca''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DN4xDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA277&lpg=PA277&dq=ramakavaca+Bali&source=bl&ots=0D7IBVmozt&sig=rVa66uSls2okxDlH5v_BEINcceg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwioxueFvYvYAhUEmJQKHWGNBH8Q6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=ramakavaca%20Bali&f=false|title=ABC of Hinduism|last=Bhalla|first=Prem P.|date=2017-08-22|publisher=Educreation Publishing|page=277|language=en}}</ref> The first half of ''[[Kakawin Ramayana]]'' is similar to the original Sanskrit version, while the latter half is very different.

The story ushered in the tradition of the next thousand years of massive-scale works in the rich diction of regal courts and Hindu temples. It has also inspired much secondary literature in various languages, notably [[Kambaramayanam]] by [[Tamils|Tamil]] poet [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]] of the 12th century, [[Telugu language]] ''Molla Ramayanam'' by poet [[Molla (poet)|Molla]] and [[Ranganatha Ramayanam]] by poet Gona Budda Reddy, 14th century [[Kannada]] poet [[Narahari]]'s Torave Ramayana and 15th century [[Bengali people|Bengali]] poet [[Krittibas Ojha]]'s [[Krittivasi Ramayan]], as well as the 16th century [[Awadhi]] version, [[Ramacharitamanas]], written by [[Tulsidas]].\n\nRamayanic scenes have also been depicted through [[terracottas]], [[stone sculpture]]s, [[Bronze|bronzes]] and [[paintings]].<ref name=\"B.

Each year, many devout pilgrims trace their journey through India and Nepal, halting at each of the holy sites along the way.
