In 1347, the area was conquered by the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] of [[Gulbarga]]. By this time the city was being referred as Vijapur or Bijapur.\n\nIn 1518, the Bahmani Sultanate split into five splinter states known as the [[Deccan sultanates]], one of which was Bijapur, ruled by the kings of the [[Adil Shahi]] dynasty (1490\u20131686). The city of Bijapur owes much of its greatness to Yusuf Adil Shah, the founder of the independent Bijapur Sultanate. The rule of this dynasty ended in 1686, when Bijapur was conquered by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Aurangzeb]]. In 1724 the [[Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]] established his independence in the Deccan, and included Bijapur within his dominions. In 1760, the Nizam suffered a defeat by the [[Maratha]]s, and ceded the region of Bijapur to the [[Maratha]] [[Peshwa]]. After the 1818 defeat of the Peshwa by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]], Bijapur passed into the hands of the [[British East India Company]], and was assigned to the [[princely state]] of [[Satara State|Satara]].\n\nIn 1848 the territory of Satara, along with Bijapur, was annexed to Britain's [[Bombay Presidency]] when the last ruler died without a male heir. The British carved a new district by the name Kaladagi. The district included present-day Bijapur and Bagalkot districts. Bijapur was made the administrative headquarters of the district in 1885, when the headquarters were moved from Bagalkot. After India's Independence in 1947, the district became part of [[Bombay state]] and was reassigned to [[Mysore state]], later Karnataka, in 1956. The former southern taluks of the district were separated in 1997 to form Bagalkot District.\n\nThe citadel, built by Yusuf Adil Shah, a mile (2&nbsp;km) in circuit, is of great strength, well built of the most massive materials, and encompassed by a ditch 100&nbsp;yards wide, formerly supplied with water, but now nearly filled up with rubbish, so that its original depth cannot be discovered. Within the citadel are the remains of both Hindu temples and old mosques, which prove that Bijapur was an important town. The fort, which was completed by Au Adil Shah in 1566, is surrounded by a wall 6&nbsp;m. in circumference. This wall is from 30 to 50&nbsp;ft (10 to 15&nbsp;m) high, and is strengthened with 96 massive bastions of various designs. In addition there are ten others at the various gateways. The width is about 25&nbsp;ft (8&nbsp;m); from bastion to bastion runs a battlemented curtained wall about 10&nbsp;ft (3&nbsp;m) high. The whole is surrounded by a deep [[moat]] 30 to 40&nbsp;ft (10 to 12&nbsp;m) broad. Inside these walls the Bijapur kings bade defiance to all comers. Outside the walls are the remains of a vast city, now for the most part in ruins, but the innumerable tombs, mosques, caravanserais and other edifices, which have resisted the havoc of time, afford abundant evidence of the ancient splendour of the place.\n\n[[Badami]], [[Aihole]], and [[Pattadakal]], near Bijapur, are noted for their historical temples in the [[Chalukya]] architectural style.\n\n===Administrative History===\n[[File:Bijapur district 1896.jpg|thumb|Bijapur district 1896]]\nUnder the [[British Raj]], Bijapur District was part of the [[Bombay Presidency]].

It is bounded on the east by [[Gulbarga District]], on the southeast by [[Raichur District]], on the south and southwest by [[Bagalkot District]], and on the west by [[Belgaum District]], and by the [[Maharashtra]] of [[Sangli]] on the northwest and [[Sholapur]] on the north, Sangli on the north-west (both of [[Maharashtra]] state).\n\nIt consists 5.49% of Karnataka state area. It lies between 15 x 50 and 17 x 28 North Latitude and 74 x 54 and 76 x 28 East Longitude. The administrative headquarters and chief town is Bijapur.\n\nGeographically, the district lies in the tract of the [[Deccan Plateau]]s. The lands of the district can be broadly divided into three zones: the northern belt consisting of the northern parts of Bijapur Taluks of Indi and Sindagi; the central belt consisting of Bijapur city; the southern belt consisting of the rich alluvial plains of the Krishna Rivers parted from the central belt by a stretch of barren Trap. The northern belt is a succession of low rolling uplands without much vegetation, gently rounded and falling into intermediate narrow valleys. The upland soil being shallow, the villagers are generally confined to the banks of the streams and are far away from one another. The Don River Valley has plains and consists of rich tracks of deep black soils stretching from west to east in the central part of the district.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ground Water Information Booklet, Bijapur District, Karnataka|publisher=Central Ground Water Board, Ministry of Water Resources, Government of India|date=July 2008|page=8|url=http://cgwb.gov.in/District_Profile/karnataka/Bijapur-brochure.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806231341/http://cgwb.gov.in/District_Profile/karnataka/Bijapur-brochure.pdf|archivedate=6 August 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Across the Krishna River is a rich plain crossed from west to east by two lines of sandstone hills. Further south towards [[Badami]] and southwest to east by two lines of [[sandstone]] hills. Further south towards Badami and southwest of Hunagund, the hills increase the number and the [[Vertisol|black soil]] gives way to the red\n\nThere are 34 rain gauge stations in Bijapur District. The average annual rainfall for the district is 553&nbsp;mm with 37.2 rainy days. The monsoon generally breaks in the district during June and lasts till October. The highest mean monthly rainfall is 149&nbsp;mm in the month of September and lowest is 3&nbsp;mm in February. The annual rainfall variation in the district is marginal from place to place.\n\nThe soils of Bijapur District can be categorized as a low to moderately yielding area (1000 to 8000&nbsp;L/h) 72.2% of district falling in this category. From considerable part of the district (9%) poor yielding (less than 1000&nbsp;L/h sources) or non\u2013feasible areas have been reported. The talukas having largest poor yielding area, are Muddebihal (19%) followed by Indi (15%), Bijapur and sindagi (13% each), Basavan Bagewadi (4%). Low yielding areas (1000 to 4000&nbsp;L/h source) in the district constitute about 40% of the district, with the largest being Basavan Bagewadi (54%) and smallest in Indi taluka Moderate yields (4000 to 8000&nbsp;L/h source) are reported from 36% of the district, highest being in Bijapur with 70% of the area, and lowest being in Sindagi with 19% of the taluka. High yielding areas (more than 8000&nbsp;L/h sources) over 15% of the district. The smallest area under this category are in Sindagi Taluka (2% each) and largest is in Muddebihal (29% each) where very lengthy contact zones occur between traps and other formations\n\nOn the basis of projections from this information, the main parameters affecting water quality in Bijapur can be expected to be brackishness (salinity) and hardness (PH). Salinity affects the district in high to low groundwater problem areas and occurs in areas all along the major and minor river courses and stream courses.\n[[File:BijapurDistrict Map 2006.JPG|thumb|200px|Political map of the Bijapur district]]\n\nIn 2014, Sajjade Peeran Mushrif became the first Mayor of the historical City Bijapur.<ref name=\"B-live\" />\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Bijapur District (2011)<ref>http://www.census2011.co.in/data/religion/district/247-bijapur.html</ref>\n|label1 = [[Hinduism]]\n|value1 = 82.07\n|color1 = Orange\n|label2 = [[Islam]]\n|value2 = 16.97\n|color2 = Green\n|label3 = [[Christianity]]\n|value3 = 0.11\n|color3 = DodgerBlue\n|label4 = [[Jainism]]\n|value4 = 0.40\n|color4 = Brown\n|label5 = [[Buddhism]]\n|value5 = 0.02\n|color5 = Yellow\n|label6 = [[Sikhism]]\n|value6 = 0.03\n|color6 = DarkKhaki\n|label7 = Other\n|value7 = 0.02\n|color7 = GreenYellow\n|label8 = Not religious\n|value8 = 0.39\n|color8 = Black\n}}\nAccording to the [[2011 census of India|2011 census]] Bijapur district, Karnataka has a [[Demographics of India|population]] of 2,177,331,<ref name=districtcensus>{{cite web | url = http://www.census2011.co.in/district.php | title = District Census 2011 | accessdate = 2011-09-30 | year = 2011 | publisher = Census2011.co.in}}</ref> roughly equal to the nation of [[Latvia]]<ref name=\"cia\">{{cite web | author = US Directorate of Intelligence | title = Country Comparison:Population | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html | accessdate = 2011-10-01 | quote = Latvia 2,204,708 July 2011 est. }}</ref> or the US state of [[New Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |title=2010 Resident Population Data |publisher=U.

In 1347, the area was conquered by the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] of [[Gulbarga]]. By this time the city was being referred as Vijapur or Bijapur.\n\nIn 1518, the Bahmani Sultanate split into five splinter states known as the [[Deccan sultanates]], one of which was Bijapur, ruled by the kings of the [[Adil Shahi]] dynasty (1490\u20131686). The city of Bijapur owes much of its greatness to Yusuf Adil Shah, the founder of the independent Bijapur Sultanate. The rule of this dynasty ended in 1686, when Bijapur was conquered by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Aurangzeb]]. In 1724 the [[Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]] established his independence in the Deccan, and included Bijapur within his dominions. In 1760, the Nizam suffered a defeat by the [[Maratha]]s, and ceded the region of Bijapur to the [[Maratha]] [[Peshwa]]. After the 1818 defeat of the Peshwa by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]], Bijapur passed into the hands of the [[British East India Company]], and was assigned to the [[princely state]] of [[Satara State|Satara]].\n\nIn 1848 the territory of Satara, along with Bijapur, was annexed to Britain's [[Bombay Presidency]] when the last ruler died without a male heir. The British carved a new district by the name Kaladagi. The district included present-day Bijapur and Bagalkot districts. Bijapur was made the administrative headquarters of the district in 1885, when the headquarters were moved from Bagalkot. After India's Independence in 1947, the district became part of [[Bombay state]] and was reassigned to [[Mysore state]], later Karnataka, in 1956. The former southern taluks of the district were separated in 1997 to form Bagalkot District.\n\nThe citadel, built by Yusuf Adil Shah, a mile (2&nbsp;km) in circuit, is of great strength, well built of the most massive materials, and encompassed by a ditch 100&nbsp;yards wide, formerly supplied with water, but now nearly filled up with rubbish, so that its original depth cannot be discovered. Within the citadel are the remains of both Hindu temples and old mosques, which prove that Bijapur was an important town. The fort, which was completed by Au Adil Shah in 1566, is surrounded by a wall 6&nbsp;m. in circumference. This wall is from 30 to 50&nbsp;ft (10 to 15&nbsp;m) high, and is strengthened with 96 massive bastions of various designs. In addition there are ten others at the various gateways. The width is about 25&nbsp;ft (8&nbsp;m); from bastion to bastion runs a battlemented curtained wall about 10&nbsp;ft (3&nbsp;m) high. The whole is surrounded by a deep [[moat]] 30 to 40&nbsp;ft (10 to 12&nbsp;m) broad. Inside these walls the Bijapur kings bade defiance to all comers. Outside the walls are the remains of a vast city, now for the most part in ruins, but the innumerable tombs, mosques, caravanserais and other edifices, which have resisted the havoc of time, afford abundant evidence of the ancient splendour of the place.\n\n[[Badami]], [[Aihole]], and [[Pattadakal]], near Bijapur, are noted for their historical temples in the [[Chalukya]] architectural style.\n\n===Administrative History===\n[[File:Bijapur district 1896.jpg|thumb|Bijapur district 1896]]\nUnder the [[British Raj]], Bijapur District was part of the [[Bombay Presidency]]. At the time of Indian independence, 1948, Bijapur District became part of [[Bombay State]].

It is bounded on the east by [[Gulbarga District]], on the southeast by [[Raichur District]], on the south and southwest by [[Bagalkot District]], and on the west by [[Belgaum District]], and by the [[Maharashtra]] of [[Sangli]] on the northwest and [[Sholapur]] on the north, Sangli on the north-west (both of [[Maharashtra]] state).\n\nIt consists 5.49% of Karnataka state area. It lies between 15 x 50 and 17 x 28 North Latitude and 74 x 54 and 76 x 28 East Longitude. The administrative headquarters and chief town is Bijapur.\n\nGeographically, the district lies in the tract of the [[Deccan Plateau]]s. The lands of the district can be broadly divided into three zones: the northern belt consisting of the northern parts of Bijapur Taluks of Indi and Sindagi; the central belt consisting of Bijapur city; the southern belt consisting of the rich alluvial plains of the Krishna Rivers parted from the central belt by a stretch of barren Trap. The northern belt is a succession of low rolling uplands without much vegetation, gently rounded and falling into intermediate narrow valleys. The upland soil being shallow, the villagers are generally confined to the banks of the streams and are far away from one another. The Don River Valley has plains and consists of rich tracks of deep black soils stretching from west to east in the central part of the district.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ground Water Information Booklet, Bijapur District, Karnataka|publisher=Central Ground Water Board, Ministry of Water Resources, Government of India|date=July 2008|page=8|url=http://cgwb.gov.in/District_Profile/karnataka/Bijapur-brochure.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806231341/http://cgwb.gov.in/District_Profile/karnataka/Bijapur-brochure.pdf|archivedate=6 August 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Across the Krishna River is a rich plain crossed from west to east by two lines of sandstone hills. Further south towards [[Badami]] and southwest to east by two lines of [[sandstone]] hills. Further south towards Badami and southwest of Hunagund, the hills increase the number and the [[Vertisol|black soil]] gives way to the red\n\nThere are 34 rain gauge stations in Bijapur District. The average annual rainfall for the district is 553&nbsp;mm with 37.2 rainy days. The monsoon generally breaks in the district during June and lasts till October. The highest mean monthly rainfall is 149&nbsp;mm in the month of September and lowest is 3&nbsp;mm in February. The annual rainfall variation in the district is marginal from place to place.\n\nThe soils of Bijapur District can be categorized as a low to moderately yielding area (1000 to 8000&nbsp;L/h) 72.2% of district falling in this category. From considerable part of the district (9%) poor yielding (less than 1000&nbsp;L/h sources) or non\u2013feasible areas have been reported. The talukas having largest poor yielding area, are Muddebihal (19%) followed by Indi (15%), Bijapur and sindagi (13% each), Basavan Bagewadi (4%). Low yielding areas (1000 to 4000&nbsp;L/h source) in the district constitute about 40% of the district, with the largest being Basavan Bagewadi (54%) and smallest in Indi taluka Moderate yields (4000 to 8000&nbsp;L/h source) are reported from 36% of the district, highest being in Bijapur with 70% of the area, and lowest being in Sindagi with 19% of the taluka. High yielding areas (more than 8000&nbsp;L/h sources) over 15% of the district. The smallest area under this category are in Sindagi Taluka (2% each) and largest is in Muddebihal (29% each) where very lengthy contact zones occur between traps and other formations\n\nOn the basis of projections from this information, the main parameters affecting water quality in Bijapur can be expected to be brackishness (salinity) and hardness (PH). Salinity affects the district in high to low groundwater problem areas and occurs in areas all along the major and minor river courses and stream courses.\n[[File:BijapurDistrict Map 2006.JPG|thumb|200px|Political map of the Bijapur district]]\n\nIn 2014, Sajjade Peeran Mushrif became the first Mayor of the historical City Bijapur.<ref name=\"B-live\" />\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Bijapur District (2011)<ref>http://www.census2011.co.in/data/religion/district/247-bijapur.html</ref>\n|label1 = [[Hinduism]]\n|value1 = 82.07\n|color1 = Orange\n|label2 = [[Islam]]\n|value2 = 16.97\n|color2 = Green\n|label3 = [[Christianity]]\n|value3 = 0.11\n|color3 = DodgerBlue\n|label4 = [[Jainism]]\n|value4 = 0.40\n|color4 = Brown\n|label5 = [[Buddhism]]\n|value5 = 0.02\n|color5 = Yellow\n|label6 = [[Sikhism]]\n|value6 = 0.03\n|color6 = DarkKhaki\n|label7 = Other\n|value7 = 0.02\n|color7 = GreenYellow\n|label8 = Not religious\n|value8 = 0.39\n|color8 = Black\n}}\nAccording to the [[2011 census of India|2011 census]] Bijapur district, Karnataka has a [[Demographics of India|population]] of 2,177,331,<ref name=districtcensus>{{cite web | url = http://www.census2011.co.in/district.php | title = District Census 2011 | accessdate = 2011-09-30 | year = 2011 | publisher = Census2011.co.in}}</ref> roughly equal to the nation of [[Latvia]]<ref name=\"cia\">{{cite web | author = US Directorate of Intelligence | title = Country Comparison:Population | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html | accessdate = 2011-10-01 | quote = Latvia 2,204,708 July 2011 est. }}</ref> or the US state of [[New Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |title=2010 Resident Population Data |publisher=U.

Within the city [[Tata Sumo]], [[Tata Indica]] and Tempo Trax<ref>[http://www.forcemotors.com/html/productdetails.aspx?id=67&root=1 Tempo Trax]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715103549/http://www.forcemotors.com/html/productdetails.aspx?id=67&root=1 |date=15 July 2006 }}</ref> are used as taxis by local operators. Autos and [[Tonga (carriage)|Tongas]] are still popular mode of local transport in the city. Cycle Rickshaws are used only to transport materials and people hardly ever travel by them.\n\n==Lchan Singh==\n\nOff late Bijapur district has produced some of the best known Road Cyclists in the national circuit. Premalata Sureban was part of the Indian contingent at the Perlis Open '99 in Malaysia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportal.nic.in/front.asp?maincatid=38&headingid=120 |accessdate=6 February 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011844/http://sportal.nic.in/front.asp?maincatid=38&headingid=120 |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\n[[B. R. Ambedkar|Dr. B.R.Ambedkar]] Sports complex serves as the main centre for all activities related to sports. Facilities are available in the single sports complex for track and field events, [[volleyball]], [[basketball]], [[cricket]] and a velodrome for cycling. Apart from the government-managed infrastructure the private trust run BLDEA's Medical and Engineering college campus has also access to the facilities for fitness and sports. It can be noted that the popular games in the rural areas are [[Kabaddi]] and [[Kho Kho]] apart from [[Cricket]]. Cricket is still popular among local youth however having a winning team of volleyball and [[Association football|football]] is a matter of prestige for all the schools and colleges.\n\nEvery year the district administration organizes the Dasara Sports Meet during the [[Navrati|Dasara]] festival to identify and nurture the talent of the future.\n\n==Art and culture==\n\nNavaraspur was the auditorium of the Adil Shahs, it is about 10&nbsp;km outside the city limits. The ruins of the site are still visible. Every year the local administration organizes the Navaraspur Festival to attract tourists. Great personalities like [[Bhimsen Joshi]], [[Ustad Alla Rakha]], [[Zakir Hussain (musician)|Zakir Hussain]], Mallikarjun Mansur, [[Gangubai Hangal]] and many more have performed in this festival.\n\n* '''Shri Shiddeshwar Temple''' situated at the heart of the city is a holy place for Hindus which is also a very beautiful tourist place to visit. During [[Makar Sankranti]] an annual fare is organized by Shri Siddheshwar Temple. This fair is well known for the cattle market which is organized outside the city limits. Farmers from neighboring villages and even some parts of Maharashtra come to trade in cattle. During this period fireworks display will be held.\n* '''The Kittur Rani Chenamma Theatre''' still stages dramas by professionals. However, due to the decrease in the patronage the drama companies are closing down. [[Ninasam]], (Shri Nilakanteshwara Nataka Sangha), an experimental theatre troupe started by [[K. V. Subbanna]], visited Bijapur and showcased their art during the Ninasam ''\"Tirugata\"'' (meaning: Wandering in [[Kannada]]). '''Kandgal Hanumantharayara Ranga Mandira''', on the station road, serves as the centre of art of culture. During summer many workshops on theatre are held at this auditorium under the sponsorship of the local administration.\n\n==Traditions==\n\n\n===Hinduism===\nThere are [[Smartha]]s and [[Vaishnava]]s as well as [[Veerashaiva]]s among them. A few hindu families in Bijapur District have modelled their religious life after the Lingayats.\n\n[[Jayatirtha]] (1365\u20131387), a prominent dvaita saint who is also known as the 'Teekacharya' lived in [[Mangalwedha]] propagated the [[Madhva Sampradaya|Madhva philosophy]] in the region.

Campine continues into the Netherlands, not shown here.<br />{{legend|#FCF75E|Campine}}]]\nThe '''Campine''' ([[French language|French]]) or '''De Kempen''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]) is a [[natural region]] situated chiefly in north-eastern [[Belgium]] and parts of the south-eastern [[Netherlands]] which once consisted mainly of extensive [[moorland|moors]], tracts of sandy [[Heath (habitat)|heath]], and [[wetland]]s. It encompasses a large northern and eastern portion of [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp province]] and adjacent parts of [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]] in Belgium, as well as portions of the Dutch province of [[North Brabant]] (area southwest of [[Eindhoven]]) and Dutch [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] around [[Weert]].\n\nToday the Campine is becoming a popular touristic destination. Old farms have been transformed into bed-and-breakfast hotels, the restaurant and caf\u00e9 business is very active, and an extensive cycle touring network has come into existence over the past few years.\n\nPart of the Campine is protected as the ''[[Hoge Kempen National Park|Hoge Kempen Nationaal Park]]'' (High Campine National Park). It is located in the east of the [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian province of Limburg]], between [[Genk]] and the [[Meuse River|Meuse]] valley and was opened in March 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countdown2010.net/article/first-national-park-opened-milestone-for-belgiums-countdown-2010 |title=First National Park opened \u2013 Milestone for Belgium\u2019s Countdown 2010 |publisher=countdown2010 |date=2006-03-23 |accessdate=2008-09-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224193324/http://www.countdown2010.net/article/first-national-park-opened-milestone-for-belgiums-countdown-2010 |archivedate=2011-02-24 }}</ref> \nCovering almost {{convert|60|km2}}, it forms part of the [[Natura 2000]] network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurosite-nature.org/IMG/pdf/057_bpn_poster_hkempen.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012131700/http://www.eurosite-nature.org/IMG/pdf/057_bpn_poster_hkempen.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-10-12 |title=The National Park Hoge Kempen |publisher=Eurosite |format=pdf |accessdate=2008-09-18 }}</ref> The area is mostly [[heathland]] and [[Temperate coniferous forest|pine forest]].\nIn May 2011 it was placed on UNESCO's Tentative List for consideration as a World Heritage Site.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Campine / Kempen derives from the [[Latin]] Campinia or Campina, meaning \"region of fields\" (''campus'' means \"field\"). The inhabitants of the Campine region are known as ''Kempenaars''.\n\n==Culture==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:VanGielFrans Painting 070611.jpg|thumb|''Campine'', a landscape by [[Frans Van Giel]]]] -->\nThe region, described as ''a desolate flat land'' often appears in the books of the prominent Flemish writer [[Hendrik Conscience]] (1812\u20131883), who spent much of his childhood there. Another author who has written many novels playing in the Campine was [[Georges Eekhoud]] (1854\u20131927). In 1837 [[Victor Hugo]] made a journey through Belgium and visited the Campine and the towns of [[Lier, Belgium|Lier]] and [[Turnhout]], and wrote about his journey.<ref>Camby, J. (1935) ''Victor Hugo en Belgique''. Paris: L'Ecran du Monde</ref> During the [[interbellum]] [[Felix Timmermans]], [[Stijn Streuvels]], [[Jozef Simons]] and the poet Jozef De Voght wrote about the Belgian Campine. The painters [[Jakob Smits]] (1855\u20131928) and [[Frans Van Giel]] (1892\u20131975) painted many Campine landscapes.\n\nThe region is rich in folk tales, such as the stories about the [[Buckriders]] (Dutch: ''Bokkenrijders'') and those concerning the [[Gnome King Kyri\u00eb|gnome king Kyri\u00eb]] (Dutch: ''Kabouterkoning Kyri\u00eb'').\n\nThe ''Museum Kempenland'' in Eindhoven has a considerable and historically important art collection of painters, draughtsmen, sculptors, blacksmiths and other craftsmen from this region. Much of the architectural, agrarian and historical and cultural heritage of the Campine can be visited in the open-air museum of [[Bokrijk]]. The old way of living and the Campine dialects have been the topic of scientific research.<ref>Bont, Antonius Petrus de (1958) ''Dialekt van Kempenland'' 3 Deel [in ?5 vols.] Assen: van Gorcum, 1958-60. 1962, 1985</ref> In the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] era the name of the region was [[Toxandria]] or Taxandria.\n\n==History==\nThe Campine is an area in the Belgian provinces Antwerp, Limburg and the extreme north of the province [[Flemish Brabant]], and in the south of the Dutch province Noord-Brabant. It stretches from the east of the city of [[Antwerp]] and towards the west of Eindhoven. Farther east the Campine is in the [[Groote Peel]], a region which is geographically related to the Campine. The south border is formed by the river [[Demer]], and the east border by the valley of the river [[Meuse]]. The ''Campine plateau'' is part of the Campine region. The ''Campine Basin'', which extends from Belgium into the Netherlands, is formed by the [[Devonian]] and [[Carboniferous]] sedimentary rocks on the northern flank of the Brabant [[Massif]].\n\nIn historical times, it is the reputed original territory of the [[Celtici|Cempsii]] who along the [[Eburones]], [[Bituriges]] and other Loire Celtic and Belgian tribes of the Iron Age - according to the Classic Greek writers reports- were leading a large train of mixed peoples behind them in their migration into the Iberian peninsula at the end of the [[Hallstatt Culture|Hallstatt]] period, looking for more benign and akin lands mostly propitiated after a combination of factors came about in those centuries: the increased aggressive pressure from the new [[La Tene Culture]] ethnic groups from further South the Rhine in their rise and expansion across much wider areas in  Europe, and as result of the climatic worsening precisely too during those centuries which altered all the animal and plant life over Northern Europe for other folks, vital for their growing and harvest seasons, that will push many irremediably into migrations too across the Rhine into the area and beyond from the North and East. The Portuguese city of [[Sesimbra]] and others in central Portugal still bear their names, legacy of their important presence once settled in the region.\n\nSince it was a region with a poor sandy soil, there are only a few old or large cities in the region. Most of those cities are located at the outer rim of the region, such as [[Hasselt]], [[Diest]], [[Aarschot]], [[Lier, Belgium|Lier]] (the self-styled ''gate of the Campine'', a title also claimed by the Northern-Brabant [[Oirschot]]), [[Breda]], [[Tilburg]], [[Eindhoven]], [[Maaseik]], and [[Maastricht]]. [[Turnhout]] is an exception. West of Turnhout [[clay]] was used for the production of [[barge]], which is one of the reasons why the ''Noord-Kempens Canal'' was dug to Antwerp. Also the more central [[Herentals]] was an historical industrial center, thanks to its textile industry of which the ''Lakenhal'' on the main market place is a remaining monument. The printing industry in [[Turnhout]] is historically important, with companies such as [[Brepols]] and more recently [[Cartamundi]].\n\nThe region was sparsely populated, and therefore chosen by monks who were looking for silence, such as those of the abbeys of [[Achel Abbey|Achel]], [[Brecht Abbey|Brecht]], [[Zundert]], [[Postel Abbey|Postel]], [[Westmalle Abbey|Westmalle]] and [[Tongerlo Abbey|Tongerlo]]. In the 19th and 20th centuries, industry established itself in the region, such as the [[metallurgy]] in [[Balen]]-[[Overpelt]]-[[Lommel]]. In 1872 the ''Sabli\u00e8res et Carri\u00e8res R\u00e9unies'' (SCR), now [[Sibelco]], was founded to extract the [[silica]] sand layers in [[Mol, Belgium|Mol]] for industrial applications ([[glass]]). In 1891, the [[Philips|Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V.]] was founded in Eindhoven (Noord-Brabant).\n\nIn the 20th century, the first nuclear installation in Belgium, the [[SCK\u2022CEN]], was built in [[Mol, Belgium|Mol]] in 1962. The European [[Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements]] (IRMM) was founded in [[Geel]] in 1957. Pharmaceutical industry was founded in [[Beerse]] in the 1960s, with [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] and more recently with [[Genzyme]] in [[Geel]]. [[Soudal]] ([[silicon]]) in Turnhout and [[Ravago]] ([[plastics]]) in [[Arendonk]] became leading companies in their markets. Wide open spaces with scarce population also led to the establishment of several military bases, such as the army installations at [[Leopoldsburg]] and [[Brasschaat]], and the air bases of [[Kleine Brogel Air Base|Kleine Brogel]], [[Zoersel-Oostmalle Airfield|Oostmalle]], [[Weelde Air Base|Weelde]] and [[Zutendaal Air Base|Zutendaal]].\n\nDue to the exploitation of the Campine [[coal]] basin, especially after [[World War II]], new industrial activity was established, such as in Geel, [[Beringen, Belgium|Beringen]] and [[Genk]]. The Belgian village of [[Malle]] is called ''Heart of the Campine''', while [[Westerlo]] and [[Kasterlee]] are called ''Pearl of the Campine''. The most picturesque villages in the Dutch, Northern-Brabant Campine are [[Oirschot]], [[Eersel]] and [[Hilvarenbeek]]. The other villages have lost much of their historical elements in their course towards industrialisation. In the Dutch Campine eight villages are located which are known under the name ''acht zaligheden'' (E: ''eight blessed ones''). The denomination ''zaligheden'' has been borrowed from the ''sel'', which is at the end of the name of seven of these eight villages ''selligheden'').\n[[File:Mechelse Hei 050806.JPG|thumb|right|Mechelse Hei ([[Maasmechelen]] heath)]]\n\nIn the Campine there are  still a number of bunches, [[marsh]]es, [[heathland]]s and [[pasture]]s. Large areas of the region were also covered with [[pine]] which was used in the [[Coal mining|coalmines]] of [[Wallonia]] and Limburg. The first pine in the Campine was sown in the ''Gierlebos'' in [[Vosselaar]] by Adriaan Ghys for [[Amalia of Solms-Braunfels|Amalia van Solms]] in 1667.<ref>Harry De Kok, Het Turnhout Van Toen, Publ. Marc Van de Wiel, Bruges, 1987, p.112</ref> Where the Campine, up to around 1960 includes mainly heathland, [[oak]] grove and marsh, these were modified by heavy fertilisation and building activities and were gradually changed into a rather small-scale landscape. Here and there still up to several dozen acres of large heathland - and forests, such as the [[Kalmthoutse Heide]] (E: Kalmthout heathland) at [[Kalmthout]], Belgium, the ''De Maten'' in Genk, ''De Zegge'' ([[Geel]]), ''Zwart Water'' ([[Kasterlee|Lichtaart]]), the ''Zwart Water'' [[moorland|moor]]s (Turnhout), the ''Liereman'' ([[Oud-Turnhout]]) and the [[Prinsenpark]] ([[Retie]]). The [[Nature reserve|natural reserves]] ''De Teut'' in [[Zonhoven]] and ''Ter Haagdoornheide'' in [[Houthalen-Helchteren]] and the ''Nationaal Park Hoge Kempen''. At the border with Belgium in the Dutch part of Campine near [[Bladel]] there is natural landscape area with heathland such as [[Cartierheide]] and ''De Pals'' and ''Kroonvense Heide''. To the North, the area between [[Boxtel]] and [[Oisterwijk]] is called ''Kampina''. In a number of villages one can still see the typical Campine ''langgevelboerderijen'' (''long-facade farms'').\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Kempenaar singer [[Louis Neefs]] released the relatively well known song \"M'n dorp in de Kempen\" (\"My village in the Campine\") in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muziekarchief.be/trackdetails.php?ID=10208|title=Mijn dorpje in de Kempen|website=muziekarchief.be}}</ref>\n*'''SS.

It encompasses a large northern and eastern portion of [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp province]] and adjacent parts of [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]] in Belgium, as well as portions of the Dutch province of [[North Brabant]] (area southwest of [[Eindhoven]]) and Dutch [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] around [[Weert]].\n\nToday the Campine is becoming a popular touristic destination. Old farms have been transformed into bed-and-breakfast hotels, the restaurant and caf\u00e9 business is very active, and an extensive cycle touring network has come into existence over the past few years.\n\nPart of the Campine is protected as the ''[[Hoge Kempen National Park|Hoge Kempen Nationaal Park]]'' (High Campine National Park). It is located in the east of the [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian province of Limburg]], between [[Genk]] and the [[Meuse River|Meuse]] valley and was opened in March 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countdown2010.net/article/first-national-park-opened-milestone-for-belgiums-countdown-2010 |title=First National Park opened \u2013 Milestone for Belgium\u2019s Countdown 2010 |publisher=countdown2010 |date=2006-03-23 |accessdate=2008-09-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224193324/http://www.countdown2010.net/article/first-national-park-opened-milestone-for-belgiums-countdown-2010 |archivedate=2011-02-24 }}</ref> \nCovering almost {{convert|60|km2}}, it forms part of the [[Natura 2000]] network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurosite-nature.org/IMG/pdf/057_bpn_poster_hkempen.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012131700/http://www.eurosite-nature.org/IMG/pdf/057_bpn_poster_hkempen.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-10-12 |title=The National Park Hoge Kempen |publisher=Eurosite |format=pdf |accessdate=2008-09-18 }}</ref> The area is mostly [[heathland]] and [[Temperate coniferous forest|pine forest]].\nIn May 2011 it was placed on UNESCO's Tentative List for consideration as a World Heritage Site.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Campine / Kempen derives from the [[Latin]] Campinia or Campina, meaning \"region of fields\" (''campus'' means \"field\"). The inhabitants of the Campine region are known as ''Kempenaars''.\n\n==Culture==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:VanGielFrans Painting 070611.jpg|thumb|''Campine'', a landscape by [[Frans Van Giel]]]] -->\nThe region, described as ''a desolate flat land'' often appears in the books of the prominent Flemish writer [[Hendrik Conscience]] (1812\u20131883), who spent much of his childhood there. Another author who has written many novels playing in the Campine was [[Georges Eekhoud]] (1854\u20131927). In 1837 [[Victor Hugo]] made a journey through Belgium and visited the Campine and the towns of [[Lier, Belgium|Lier]] and [[Turnhout]], and wrote about his journey.<ref>Camby, J. (1935) ''Victor Hugo en Belgique''. Paris: L'Ecran du Monde</ref> During the [[interbellum]] [[Felix Timmermans]], [[Stijn Streuvels]], [[Jozef Simons]] and the poet Jozef De Voght wrote about the Belgian Campine. The painters [[Jakob Smits]] (1855\u20131928) and [[Frans Van Giel]] (1892\u20131975) painted many Campine landscapes.\n\nThe region is rich in folk tales, such as the stories about the [[Buckriders]] (Dutch: ''Bokkenrijders'') and those concerning the [[Gnome King Kyri\u00eb|gnome king Kyri\u00eb]] (Dutch: ''Kabouterkoning Kyri\u00eb'').\n\nThe ''Museum Kempenland'' in Eindhoven has a considerable and historically important art collection of painters, draughtsmen, sculptors, blacksmiths and other craftsmen from this region. Much of the architectural, agrarian and historical and cultural heritage of the Campine can be visited in the open-air museum of [[Bokrijk]]. The old way of living and the Campine dialects have been the topic of scientific research.<ref>Bont, Antonius Petrus de (1958) ''Dialekt van Kempenland'' 3 Deel [in ?5 vols.] Assen: van Gorcum, 1958-60. 1962, 1985</ref> In the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] era the name of the region was [[Toxandria]] or Taxandria.\n\n==History==\nThe Campine is an area in the Belgian provinces Antwerp, Limburg and the extreme north of the province [[Flemish Brabant]], and in the south of the Dutch province Noord-Brabant. It stretches from the east of the city of [[Antwerp]] and towards the west of Eindhoven. Farther east the Campine is in the [[Groote Peel]], a region which is geographically related to the Campine. The south border is formed by the river [[Demer]], and the east border by the valley of the river [[Meuse]]. The ''Campine plateau'' is part of the Campine region. The ''Campine Basin'', which extends from Belgium into the Netherlands, is formed by the [[Devonian]] and [[Carboniferous]] sedimentary rocks on the northern flank of the Brabant [[Massif]].\n\nIn historical times, it is the reputed original territory of the [[Celtici|Cempsii]] who along the [[Eburones]], [[Bituriges]] and other Loire Celtic and Belgian tribes of the iron Age - according to the Classic Greek writers reports- were leading a large train of mixed peoples behind them in their migration into the Iberian peninsula at the end of the [[Hallstatt Culture|Hallstatt]] period, looking for more benign and akin lands mostly propitiated after a combination of factors came about in those centuries: the increased aggressive pressure from the new [[La Tene Culture]] ethnic groups from further South the Rhine in their rise and expansion across much wider areas in  Europe, and as result of the climatic worsening precisely too during those centuries which altered all the animal and plant life over Northern Europe for other folks, vital for their growing and harvest seasons, that will push many irremediably into migrations too across the Rhine into the area and beyond from the North and East. The Portuguese city of [[Sesimbra]] and others in central Portugal still bear their names, legacy of their important presence once settled in the region.\n\nSince it was a region with a poor sandy soil, there are only a few old or large cities in the region. Most of those cities are located at the outer rim of the region, such as [[Hasselt]], [[Diest]], [[Aarschot]], [[Lier, Belgium|Lier]] (the self-styled ''gate of the Campine'', a title also claimed by the Northern-Brabant [[Oirschot]]), [[Breda]], [[Tilburg]], [[Eindhoven]], [[Maaseik]], and [[Maastricht]]. [[Turnhout]] is an exception. West of Turnhout [[clay]] was used for the production of [[barge]], which is one of the reasons why the ''Noord-Kempens Canal'' was dug to Antwerp. Also the more central [[Herentals]] was an historical industrial center, thanks to its textile industry of which the ''Lakenhal'' on the main market place is a remaining monument. The printing industry in [[Turnhout]] is historically important, with companies such as [[Brepols]] and more recently [[Cartamundi]].\n\nThe region was sparsely populated, and therefore chosen by monks who were looking for silence, such as those of the abbeys of [[Achel Abbey|Achel]], [[Brecht Abbey|Brecht]], [[Zundert]], [[Postel Abbey|Postel]], [[Westmalle Abbey|Westmalle]] and [[Tongerlo Abbey|Tongerlo]]. In the 19th and 20th centuries, industry established itself in the region, such as the [[metallurgy]] in [[Balen]]-[[Overpelt]]-[[Lommel]]. In 1872 the ''Sabli\u00e8res et Carri\u00e8res R\u00e9unies'' (SCR), now [[Sibelco]], was founded to extract the [[silica]] sand layers in [[Mol, Belgium|Mol]] for industrial applications ([[glass]]). In 1891, the [[Philips|Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V.]] was founded in Eindhoven (Noord-Brabant).\n\nIn the 20th century, the first nuclear installation in Belgium, the [[SCK\u2022CEN]], was built in [[Mol, Belgium|Mol]] in 1962. The European [[Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements]] (IRMM) was founded in [[Geel]] in 1957. Pharmaceutical industry was founded in [[Beerse]] in the 1960s, with [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] and more recently with [[Genzyme]] in [[Geel]]. [[Soudal]] ([[silicon]]) in Turnhout and [[Ravago]] ([[plastics]]) in [[Arendonk]] became leading companies in their markets. Wide open spaces with scarce population also led to the establishment of several military bases, such as the army installations at [[Leopoldsburg]] and [[Brasschaat]], and the air bases of [[Kleine Brogel Air Base|Kleine Brogel]], [[Zoersel-Oostmalle Airfield|Oostmalle]], [[Weelde Air Base|Weelde]] and [[Zutendaal Air Base|Zutendaal]].\n\nDue to the exploitation of the Campine [[coal]] basin, especially after [[World War II]], new industrial activity was established, such as in Geel, [[Beringen, Belgium|Beringen]] and [[Genk]]. The Belgian village of [[Malle]] is called ''Heart of the Campine''', while [[Westerlo]] and [[Kasterlee]] are called ''Pearl of the Campine''. The most picturesque villages in the Dutch, Northern-Brabant Campine are [[Oirschot]], [[Eersel]] and [[Hilvarenbeek]]. The other villages have lost much of their historical elements in their course towards industrialisation. In the Dutch Campine eight villages are located which are known under the name ''acht zaligheden'' (E: ''eight blessed ones''). The denomination ''zaligheden'' has been borrowed from the ''sel'', which is at the end of the name of seven of these eight villages ''selligheden'').\n[[File:Mechelse Hei 050806.JPG|thumb|right|Mechelse Hei ([[Maasmechelen]] heath)]]\n\nIn the Campine there are  still a number of bunches, [[marsh]]es, [[heathland]]s and [[pasture]]s. Large areas of the region were also covered with [[pine]] which was used in the [[Coal mining|coalmines]] of [[Wallonia]] and Limburg. The first pine in the Campine was sown in the ''Gierlebos'' in [[Vosselaar]] by Adriaan Ghys for [[Amalia of Solms-Braunfels|Amalia van Solms]] in 1667.<ref>Harry De Kok, Het Turnhout Van Toen, Publ. Marc Van de Wiel, Bruges, 1987, p.112</ref> Where the Campine, up to around 1960 includes mainly heathland, [[oak]] grove and marsh, these were modified by heavy fertilisation and building activities and were gradually changed into a rather small-scale landscape. Here and there still up to several dozen acres of large heathland - and forests, such as the [[Kalmthoutse Heide]] (E: Kalmthout heathland) at [[Kalmthout]], Belgium, the ''De Maten'' in Genk, ''De Zegge'' ([[Geel]]), ''Zwart Water'' ([[Kasterlee|Lichtaart]]), the ''Zwart Water'' [[moorland|moor]]s (Turnhout), the ''Liereman'' ([[Oud-Turnhout]]) and the [[Prinsenpark]] ([[Retie]]). The [[Nature reserve|natural reserves]] ''De Teut'' in [[Zonhoven]] and ''Ter Haagdoornheide'' in [[Houthalen-Helchteren]] and the ''Nationaal Park Hoge Kempen''. At the border with Belgium in the Dutch part of Campine near [[Bladel]] there is natural landscape area with heathland such as [[Cartierheide]] and ''De Pals'' and ''Kroonvense Heide''. To the North, the area between [[Boxtel]] and [[Oisterwijk]] is called ''Kampina''. In a number of villages one can still see the typical Campine ''langgevelboerderijen'' (''long-facade farms'').\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Kempenaar singer [[Louis Neefs]] released the relatively well known song \"M'n dorp in de Kempen\" (\"My village in the Campine\") in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muziekarchief.be/trackdetails.php?ID=10208|title=Mijn dorpje in de Kempen|website=muziekarchief.be}}</ref>\n*'''SS.

At least one of the ships encountered difficulties near [[Jamaica]] and ran out of supplies, causing its captain to send twenty of his crew ashore.  Eventually, the ''Roebuck'', ''Red Lion'', and ''Dorothy'' continued to the Outer Banks, arriving by mid-June.  The ''Red Lion'' left about thirty men on Croatoan Island and departed for privateering in Newfoundland.  In the meantime, Grenville established contact with local Spanish authorities, in the hopes of obtaining fresh provisions.  When the Spanish failed to deliver the promised supplies, Grenville suspected they would soon attack, so he and his ships abandoned the temporary fort.<ref name=\"Quinn 1985\"/>{{rp|60,64}}\n\n[[File:Cabo Rojo fort 26 May 1585.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Collecting salt in Salinas Bay.]]\nGrenville captured two Spanish ships in the [[Mona Passage]], adding them to his fleet.

Lane again built fortifications to protect his men as they brought the salt aboard.

While there his party made contact with the [[Chesapeake people|Chesepeake]] villages of Chesepioc and Skic\u00f3ak.  The Secotans had described Skic\u00f3ak as the largest city in the region, possibly leading the English to expect something like the wealthy [[Inca Empire|Inca]] and [[Aztecs|Aztec]] kingdoms encountered by the Spanish.

Some of the Secotan suspected the disease was caused by supernatural forces unleashed by the English.  When Wingina fell sick, his own people could not treat him, but he recovered after requesting prayers from the English.  Impressed, Wingina asked the colonists to share this power with other stricken communities, which only hastened the spread of disease.  The epidemic likely had a severe impact on the fall harvest, at a time when Lane's colony would be heavily dependent on its neighbors to supplement its limited food supply.<ref name=\"secrettoken\"/>{{rp|64\u201365}}<ref name=\"Horn 2010\"/>{{rp|89-91}}\n\n===Hostilities and Food Shortages===\n[[File:A chiefe Herowan.jpg|thumb|Portrait of a [[weroance]], which may have been [[Wingina]]]]\nBy spring relations between the Secotan and the colony were strained, most likely due to the colony's overreliance on Secotan food.  The death of Granganimeo, who had been a powerful advocate for the colony, apparently helped to turn Wingina against the English.  Wingina changed his name to \"Pemisapan\" (\"one who watches\"), suggesting a newly cautious and vigilant policy, and established a new temporary tribal capital on Roanoke Island.  The English did not initially recognize these developments represented a threat to their interests.<ref name=\"Kupperman 2007\"/>{{rp|75-76}}\n\nIn March, Lane consulted Pemisapan about a plan to explore the mainland, beyond Secotan territory.  Pemisapan supported the plan and advised Lane that the [[Chowanoke]] leader Menatonon was meeting with his allies to plan an attack on the English, and that three thousand warriors had gathered at Choanoac.  At the same time, Pemisapan sent word to Menatonon that the English would be coming, ensuring both sides would expect hostilities.  When Lane's well-armed party arrived at Choanoac, he found representatives of the Chowanoke, Mangoak, [[Weapemeoc Indians|Weapemeoc]], and Moratuc.  Since this gathering was not planning an attack, Lane caught them by surprise.

He described a rich and powerful king to the northeast (presumably the leader of the [[Powhatan]]), warning that Lane should bring a considerable force if he sought to make contact.  Menatonon also corroborated rumors Lane had heard about a sea just beyond the head of the [[Roanoke River]], apparently confirming English hopes of finding access to the Pacific Ocean.

During their absence, rumors had spread that they'd been killed, and Pemisapan had been preparing to withdraw the Secotan from Roanoke Island and leave the colony to starve.  There was no sign of Grenville's resupply fleet, which had not yet even left England.  According to Lane, Pemisapan was so surprised that Lane returned alive from the Roanoke River mission that he reconsidered his plans.  Ensenore, an elder among Pemisapan's council, argued in favor of the English.  Later, an envoy for Menatonon informed Lane that the Weapemeoc leader Okisko has pledged fealty to Queen Elizabeth and Walter Raleigh.  This shift in the balance of power in the region further deterred Pemisapan from following through on his plans against the colony.  He instead ordered his people to sow crops and build [[fishing weir]]s for the colony.<ref name=\"Kupperman 2007\"/>{{rp|80-82}}\n\nThe renewed accord between the English and the Secotan was short-lived.  On April 20 Ensenore died, depriving the colony of its last advocate in Pemisapan's inner circle.  Wanchese had risen to become a senior advisor, and his time among the English had convinced him that they were a threat.  Pemisapan evacuated the Secotan from Roanoke, destroyed the fishing weirs, and ordered them not to sell food to the English.  Left to their own devices the English had no way to produce enough food to sustain the colony.  Lane ordered his men to break up into small groups to forage and beg for food in the Outer Banks and the mainland.<ref name=\"Kupperman 2007\"/>{{rp|82}}\n\nLane continued to keep Skiko as a hostage.  Although Pemisapan met regularly with Skiko and believed him sympathetic to the anti-English cause, Skiko sought to honor his father's intention of maintaining relations with the colony.  Skiko informed Lane that Pemisapan planned to organize a war council meeting on June 10 with various regional powers.  With the copper the Secotan had gained from trading with the colony, Pemisapan was able to offer substantial inducements to other tribes to side with him in a final offensive against the English.  Oksiko declined to get involved, although individual Weapemeocs were permitted to participate.  The plan of attack was to ambush Lane and other key leaders as they slept at the colony, and then signal for a general attack on the rest.  Based on this information, Lane sent disinformation to the Secotan indicating that an English fleet had arrived, to force Pemisapan's hand.<ref name=\"Kupperman 2007\"/>{{rp|83-84}}\n\nForced to accelerate his schedule by the possibility of English reinforcements, Pemisapan gathered as many allies as he could for a meeting on May 31 at Dasamongueponke.  That evening, Lane attacked the warriors posted at Roanoke, hoping to prevent them from alerting the mainland the following morning.  On June 1, Lane, his top officers, and twenty-five men visited Dasamongueponke under the pretense of discussing a Secotan attempt to free Skiko.  Once they were admitted into the council, Lane gave the signal for his men to attack.

The fleet was set to launch in March 1588, but unfavorable winds kept them in port until Grenville received new orders to stay and defend England.  Two of the smaller ships in Grenville's fleet, the ''Brave'' and the ''Roe'', were deemed unsuitable for combat, and White was permitted to take them to Roanoke.

Gonz\u00e1lez failed to find anything in Chesapeake, but on the way back he chanced to discover Port Ferdinando along the Outer Banks. The port appeared abandoned, and there were no signs of activity on Roanoke Island. Gonz\u00e1lez left without conducting a thorough investigation.  Although the Spanish believed Gonz\u00e1lez had located the secret English base, the defeat of the Spanish Armada prevented Phillip from immediately ordering an attack upon it. In 1590, a plan was made to destroy the Roanoke colony and set up a Spanish colony in Chesapeake Bay, but this was merely disinformation designed to misdirect English intelligence.<ref name=\"secrettoken\"/>{{rp|95\u201398}}\n\n===1590 relief mission===\n{{further|Watts' West Indies and Virginia expedition}}\n[[File:Ruins of the English Settlement at Roanoke.jpg|thumb|John White at the ruins of the Roanoke colony, 1590]]\nEventually, Walter Raleigh arranged passage for White on a privateering expedition organised by [[John Watts (merchant)|John Watts]].  The fleet of six ships would spend the summer of 1590 raiding Spanish outposts in the Caribbean, but the flagship ''Hopewell'' and the ''Moonlight'' would split off to take White to his colony.<ref name=\"secrettoken\"/>{{rp|97}}  At the same time, however, Raleigh was in the process of turning the venture over to new investors.<ref name=\"secrettoken\"/>{{rp|98}}\n\nThe ''Hopewell'' and ''Moonlight'' anchored at Croatoan Island on August 12, but there is no indication that White used the time to contact the Croatan for information.

On August 17 they sighted a fire on the north end of Roanoke Island and rowed towards it, but they reached the island after nightfall and decided not to risk coming ashore. The men spent the night in their anchored boats, singing English songs in hopes that the colonists would hear.<ref name=\"secrettoken\"/>{{rp|xvii-xix}}\n\nWhite and the others made landfall on the morning of August 18 (his granddaughter's third birthday). The party found fresh tracks in the sand, but were not contacted by anyone. They also discovered the letters \"CRO\" carved into a tree.  Upon reaching the site of the colony, White noted the area had been fortified with a palisade. Near the entrance of the fencing, the word \"CROATOAN\" was carved in one of the posts.<ref name=\"secrettoken\"/>{{rp|xix}}  White was certain these two inscriptions meant that the colonists had peacefully relocated to Croatoan Island, since they had agreed in 1587 that the colonists would leave a \"secret token\" indicating their destination, or a [[cross patt\u00e9e]] as a [[duress code]].<ref name=\"White 1590\">{{cite book |author-last=White |author-first=John |author-link=John White (colonist and artist) |chapter=The fift voyage of M.

The ''Moonlight'' set off for England, but the crew of the ''Hopewell'' offered a compromise with White, in which they would spend winter in the Caribbean and return to the Outer Banks in the spring of 1591.  This plan fell through, though, when the ''Hopewell'' was blown off course, forcing them to stop for supplies in the Azores.

They described to him a place called \"Ocanahonan\", where men wore European-style clothing; and \"Anone\", which featured walled houses.  Later, after Smith returned to the colony, he made arrangements with Wowinchopunk, the king of the [[Paspahegh]], to investigate \"Panawicke\", another place reportedly inhabited by men in European dress.  The colony produced a crude map of the region with labels for these villages.  The map also featured a place called \"Pakrakanick\" with a note indicating \"Here remayneth 4 men clothed that came from Roonocok to Ocanahawan.\"<ref name=\"Fullam 2017\"/>{{rp|128\u2013133}}\n\nIn the summer of 1608 Smith sent a letter about this information, along with the map, back to England.

Her interest in the disappearance of the 1587 colony motivated various projects to establish a genetic link between the colonists and potential Native American descendants. Examining [[Autosome|autosomal DNA]] for this purpose is unreliable, as so little of the colonists' genetic material would remain after five or six generations. However, testing of [[Y chromosome]]s and [[Mitochondrial DNA]] is more reliable over large spans of time. The main challenge of this work is to obtain a genetic point of comparison, either from the remains of a Lost Colonist or one of their descendants. While it is conceivable to sequence DNA from 430-year-old bones, there are as yet no bones from the Lost Colony to work with.

When White returned to the colony in 1590, there was no sign of battle or withdrawal under duress, although the site was fortified.  There were no human remains or graves reported in the area, suggesting everyone left alive.

Little is known about the pinnace, but ships of its size were capable of making the trip, although they typically did so alongside other vessels.<ref name=\"Fullam 2017\"/>{{rp|83\u201384}}\n\nThe colonists may have feared that a standard route across the Atlantic Ocean, with a stop in the Caribbean, would risk a Spanish attack.  Nevertheless, it was feasible for the colonists to attempt a direct course to England.  In 1563, French settlers at the failed [[Charlesfort-Santa Elena Site#Charlesfort (1562\u20131563)|Charlesfort]] colony built a crude boat and successfully (albeit desperately) returned to Europe.  Alternatively, the Roanoke colonists could have sailed north along the coast, in the hopes of making contact with English fishing fleets in the [[Gulf of Maine]].<ref name=\"Fullam 2017\"/>{{rp|85\u201389}}\n\nThe pinnace would not have been large enough to carry all of the colonists.  Additionally, the provisions needed for a transatlantic voyage would further restrict the number of passengers.  The colonists may have possessed the resources to construct another seaworthy vessel, using local lumber and spare parts from the pinnace.  Considering the ships built by survivors of the 1609 ''Sea Venture'' shipwreck, it is at least possible that the Lost Colonists could produce a second ship that, with the pinnace, could transport most of their party.<ref name=\"Fullam 2017\"/>{{rp|84\u201390}}  Even in these ideal conditions, however, at least some colonists would remain in Virginia, leaving open the question of what became of them.<ref name=\"Stick1983\"/>{{rp|244}}\n\n===Powhatan attack at Chesapeake Bay===\n[[File:Powhatan john smith map.jpg|thumb|Chief Powhatan, detail of map published by John Smith (1612)]]\n[[David Beers Quinn]] concluded that the 1587 colonists sought to relocate to their original destination\u2014Chesapeake Bay\u2014using the pinnace and other small boats to transport themselves and their belongings.  A small group would have been stationed at Croatoan to await John White's return and direct him to the transplanted colony.  Following White's failure to locate any of the colonists, the main body of the colonists would have quickly assimilated with the [[Chesapeake people|Chesepians]], while the lookouts on Croatoan would have blended into the Croatan tribe.\n\nQuinn suggested that Samuel Mace's 1602 voyage might have ventured into Chesepeake Bay and kidnapped Powhatans to bring back to England.  From there these abductees would be able to communicate with Thomas Harriot, and might reveal that Europeans were living in the region.  Quinn evidently believed circumstances such as these were necessary to explain optimism about the colonists' survival after 1603.\n\nAlthough Strachey accused Wahunsenacawh of slaughtering the colonists and Chesepians in separate passages, Quinn decided that these events occurred in a single attack on an integrated community, in April 1607.  He supposed that Wahunsenacawh could have been seeking revenge for the speculative kidnappings by Mace.  In Quinn's estimation, John Smith was the first to learn of the massacre, but for political considerations he quietly reported it directly to King James rather than revealing it in his published writings.<ref name=\"Quinn 1985\"/>{{rp|341\u2013377}}\n\nDespite Quinn's reputation on the subject, his peers had reservations about his theory, which relies heavily on the accounts of Strachey and Purchas.<ref name=\"secrettoken\"/>{{rp|132}}\n\n===Spanish attack===\n\nWhile preparing to compose [[The Lost Colony (play)|a 1937 drama]] about the Lost Colony, [[Paul Green (playwright)|Paul Green]] noticed that Spanish records from the period contained an abundance of references to Raleigh and his settlements.<ref name=\"Betts 1938\">{{cite magazine |last=Betts |first=Robert E. |title=The Lost Colony |magazine=The Cornhill Magazine |volume=158 |number=943 |date=July 1938 |pages=50\u201367 |location=London |publisher=John Murray |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.185179/page/n59 |access-date=September 14, 2019}}</ref>{{rp|63\u201364}}  Green's play ends with the colonists leaving Roanoke Island to evade an approaching Spanish ship, leaving the audience to wonder if the Spanish found them.<ref name=\"secrettoken\"/>{{rp|353}}\n\nSpanish forces knew of English plans to establish a new Virginia base in 1587, and were searching for it before White's colonists had even arrived.  The Spanish Empire had included most of North America in their Florida claim, and did not recognize England's right to colonize Roanoke or Chesapeake Bay.

The purpose of this plot, she argued, was to undermine Walter Raleigh, whose activities supposedly interfered with Walsingham's covert machinations to make England a Protestant world power at the expense of Spain and other Catholic nations.

However, the colonists would quickly spread European diseases among their hosts, decimating the Chowanoke and thereby destabilizing the balance of power in the region.  From there Miller reasoned that the Chowanoke were attacked, with the survivors taken captive, by the \"Mandoag\", a powerful nation to the west that the Jamestown colonists only knew from the vague accounts of their neighbors.<ref name=\"Miller2002\"/>{{rp|227\u2013237}}  She concluded that the Mandoag were the [[Eno people|Eno]], who traded the remaining Lost Colonists as slaves until they were dispersed throughout the region.<ref name=\"Miller2002\"/>{{rp|255\u2013260}}\n\nMiller's theory has been challenged based on Walsingham's considerable financial support of Raleigh's expeditions, and the willingness of Fernandes to bring John White back to England instead of abandoning him with the other colonists.<ref name=\"Fullam 2017\"/>{{rp|29\u201330}}\n\n===Secret operation at Beechland===\nLocal legends in Dare County refer to an abandoned settlement called \"Beechland\", located within what is now the [[Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge]].

In this view, the colony was not truly abandoned until the secret of the colony's location died with Raleigh in 1618.  After that point, McMullan argued, the colonists would have begun to assimilate with the Croatan at Beechland.<ref name=\"McMullan 2010\"/>\n\nThis theory largely depends upon oral traditions and unsubstantiated reports about Beechland, as well as a 1651 map that depicts a sassafras tree near the Alligator River.  A significant problem is that Raleigh supposedly planned a sassafras farm in 1587 to capitalize on a dramatic increase in crop prices, so that he could quickly compensate for the great expense of the failed 1585 colony.<ref name=\"McMullan 2010\"/>  This overlooks the fact that Richard Grenville's privateering recovered the cost of the 1585 expedition.<ref name=\"secrettoken\"/>{{rp|60}}  Additionally, sassafras prices did not skyrocket in value until the late 1590s, well after the establishment of the 1587 colony.<ref name=\"secrettoken\"/>{{rp|112}}\n\n===CORA tree===\n\nIn 2006, writer Scott Dawson proposed that a [[Quercus virginiana|Southern live oak tree]] on Hatteras Island, which bears the faint inscription \"CORA\" in its bark, might be connected to the Lost Colony.  The CORA tree had already been the subject of local legends, most notably a story about a witch named \"Cora\" that was popularized in a 1989 book by [[Charles H. Whedbee]].  Nevertheless, Dawson argued that the inscription might represent another message from the colonists, similar to the \"CROATOAN\" inscription at Roanoke.<ref name=\"Fullam 2017\"/>{{rp|71-72}}  If so, \"CORA\" might indicate that the colonists left Croatoan Island to settle with the [[Coree]] (also known as the Coranine) on the mainland near [[Lake Mattamuskeet]].<ref name=\"Gabriel-Powell 2016\"/>{{rp|128}}\n\nA 2009 study to determine the age of the CORA tree was inconclusive.  Damage to the tree, caused by lightning and decay, has made it impossible to obtain a valid core sample for tree-ring dating.  Even if the tree dates back to the 16th century, though, establishing the age of the inscription would be another matter.<ref name=\"Fullam 2017\"/>{{rp|72-73}}\n\n===Dare Stones===\n{{Main|Dare Stones}}\nFrom 1937 to 1941, a series of [[Virginia Dare#Eleanor Dare Stones|inscribed stones]] was discovered that were claimed to have been written by [[Eleanor Dare]], mother of [[Virginia Dare]].

The  [[Secotan]], who controlled Roanoke Island and the mainland between Albemarle Sound and the Pamlico River, soon made contact with the English and established friendly relations.

The intended number of colonists is unknown, but approximately six hundred men were sent in the voyage, with probably about half intended to remain at the colony, to be followed by a second wave later.

At least one of the ships encountered difficulties near [[Jamaica]] and ran out of supplies, causing its captain to send twenty of his crew ashore.  Eventually, the ''Roebuck'', ''Red Lion'', and ''Dorothy'' continued to the Outer Banks, arriving by mid-June.  The ''Red Lion'' left about thirty men on Croatoan Island and departed for privateering in Newfoundland.  In the meantime, Grenville established contact with local Spanish authorities, in the hopes of obtaining fresh provisions.  When the Spanish failed to deliver the promised supplies, Grenville suspected they would soon attack, so he and his ships abandoned the temporary fort.<ref name=\"Quinn 1985\"/>{{rp|60,64}}\n\n[[File:Cabo Rojo fort 26 May 1585.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Collecting salt in Salinas Bay.]]\nGrenville captured two Spanish ships in the [[Mona Passage]], adding them to his fleet.  Lane took one of these ships to [[Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico|Salinas Bay]], where he captured salt mounds collected by the Spanish.  Lane again built fortifications to protect his men as they brought the salt aboard.  Grenville's ships then sailed to [[La Isabela]], where the Spanish set aside hostilities to trade with the well-armed English fleet.  On June 7, Grenville left Hispanola to continue to the Outer Banks.<ref name=\"Quinn 1985\"/>{{rp|60\u201363}}\n\nThe fleet sailed through an inlet at Wococon Island (near present-day [[Ocracoke Inlet]]) on June 26.

The wreck of the ''Tiger'', however, made that impossible.  The remaining provisions could not support a settlement as large as had been planned.  Moreover, the shallow inlets of the Outer Banks made the region unsuitable for a base to support large ships.  The colony's top priority would now be to locate a better harbor.<ref name=\"Kupperman 2007\"/>{{rp|20}}\n\nAfter repairs, the ''Tiger'' continued with the rest of the fleet to Port Ferdinando, where they reunited with the ''Roebuck'' and the ''Dorothy''.

While there his party made contact with the [[Chesapeake people|Chesepeake]] villages of Chesepioc and Skic\u00f3ak.  The Secotans had described Skic\u00f3ak as the largest city in the region, possibly leading the English to expect something like the wealthy [[Inca Empire|Inca]] and [[Aztecs|Aztec]] kingdoms encountered by the Spanish.

Some of the Secotan suspected the disease was caused by supernatural forces unleashed by the English.  When Wingina fell sick, his own people could not treat him, but he recovered after requesting prayers from the English.  Impressed, Wingina asked the colonists to share this power with other stricken communities, which only hastened the spread of disease.  The epidemic likely had a severe impact on the fall harvest, at a time when Lane's colony would be heavily dependent on its neighbors to supplement its limited food supply.<ref name=\"secrettoken\"/>{{rp|64\u201365}}<ref name=\"Horn 2010\"/>{{rp|89-91}}\n\n===Hostilities and Food Shortages===\n[[File:A chiefe Herowan.jpg|thumb|Portrait of a [[weroance]], which may have been [[Wingina]]]]\nBy spring relations between the Secotan and the colony were strained, most likely due to the colony's overreliance on Secotan food.  The death of Granganimeo, who had been a powerful advocate for the colony, apparently helped to turn Wingina against the English.  Wingina changed his name to \"Pemisapan\" (\"one who watches\"), suggesting a newly cautious and vigilant policy, and established a new temporary tribal capital on Roanoke Island.  The English did not initially recognize these developments represented a threat to their interests.<ref name=\"Kupperman 2007\"/>{{rp|75-76}}\n\nIn March, Lane consulted Pemisapan about a plan to explore the mainland, beyond Secotan territory.  Pemisapan supported the plan and advised Lane that the [[Chowanoke]] leader Menatonon was meeting with his allies to plan an attack on the English, and that three thousand warriors had gathered at Choanoac.  At the same time, Pemisapan sent word to Menatonon that the English would be coming, ensuring both sides would expect hostilities.  When Lane's well-armed party arrived at Choanoac, he found representatives of the Chowanoke, Mangoak, [[Weapemeoc Indians|Weapemeoc]], and Moratuc.  Since this gathering was not planning an attack, Lane caught them by surprise.

He described a rich and powerful king to the northeast (presumably the leader of the [[Powhatan]]), warning that Lane should bring a considerable force if he sought to make contact.  Menatonon also corroborated rumors Lane had heard about a sea just beyond the head of the [[Roanoke River]], apparently confirming English hopes of finding access to the Pacific Ocean.

During their absence, rumors had spread that they'd been killed, and Pemisapan had been preparing to withdraw the Secotan from Roanoke Island and leave the colony to starve.  There was no sign of Grenville's resupply fleet, which had not yet even left England.  According to Lane, Pemisapan was so surprised that Lane returned alive from the Roanoke River mission that he reconsidered his plans.  Ensenore, an elder among Pemisapan's council, argued in favor of the English.  Later, a envoy for Menatonon informed Lane that the Weapemeoc leader Okisko has pledged fealty to Queen Elizabeth and Walter Raleigh.  This shift in the balance of power in the region further deterred Pemisapan from following through on his plans against the colony.  He instead ordered his people to sow crops and build [[fishing weir]]s for the colony.<ref name=\"Kupperman 2007\"/>{{rp|80-82}}\n\nThe renewed accord between the English and the Secotan was short-lived.  On April 20 Ensenore died, depriving the colony of its last advocate in Pemisapan's inner circle.  Wanchese had risen to become a senior advisor, and his time among the English had convinced him that they were a threat.  Pemisapan evacuated the Secotan from Roanoke, destroyed the fishing weirs, and ordered them not to sell food to the English.  Left to their own devices the English had no way to produce enough food to sustain the colony.  Lane ordered his men to break up into small groups to forage and beg for food in the Outer Banks and the mainland.<ref name=\"Kupperman 2007\"/>{{rp|82}}\n\nLane continued to keep Skiko as a hostage.  Although Pemisapan met regularly with Skiko and believed him sympathetic to the anti-English cause, Skiko sought to honor his father's intention of maintaining relations with the colony.  Skiko informed Lane that Pemisapan planned to organize a war council meeting on June 10 with various regional powers.  With the copper the Secotan had gained from trading with the colony, Pemisapan was able to offer substantial inducements to other tribes to side with him in a final offensive against the English.  Oksiko declined to get involved, although individual Weapemeocs were permitted to participate.  The plan of attack was to ambush Lane and other key leaders as they slept at the colony, and then signal for a general attack on the rest.  Based on this information, Lane sent disinformation to the Secotan indicating that an English fleet had arrived, to force Pemisapan's hand.<ref name=\"Kupperman 2007\"/>{{rp|83-84}}\n\nForced to accelerate his schedule by the possibility of English reinforcements, Pemisapan gathered as many allies as he could for a meeting on May 31 at Dasamongueponke.  That evening, Lane attacked the warriors posted at Roanoke, hoping to prevent them from alerting the mainland the following morning.  On June 1, Lane, his top officers, and twenty-five men visited Dasamongueponke under the pretense of discussing a Secotan attempt to free Skiko.  Once they were admitted into the council, Lane gave the signal for his men to attack.

Four of the English were away gathering oysters when two of the attackers, appearing unarmed, approached the encampment and asked to meet with two Englishmen peacefully.  One of the Native Americans concealed a wooden sword, which he used to kill an Englishman.  Another 28 attackers revealed themselves, but the other Englishman escaped to warn his unit.  The natives attacked with flaming arrows, setting fire to the house where the English kept their food stores, and forcing the men to take up whatever arms were handy.  A second Englishman was killed; the remaining nine retreated to the shore, and fled the island on their boat.  They found their four compatriots returning from the creek, picked them up, and continued into Port Ferdinando.

The fleet was set to launch in March 1588, but unfavorable winds kept them in port until Grenville received new orders to stay and defend England.  Two of the smaller ships in Grenville's fleet, the ''Brave'' and the ''Roe'', were deemed unsuitable for combat, and White was permitted to take them to Roanoke.  The ships departed on April 22, but the captains of the ships attempted to capture several Spanish ships on the outward-bound voyage (in order to improve their profits).<ref name=\"Quinn 1985\"/>{{rp|302}}<ref name=\"Kupperman 2007\"/>{{rp|121\u2013122}}  On May 6 they were attacked by French pirates near Morocco.

Gonz\u00e1lez failed to find anything in Chesapeake, but on the way back he chanced to discover Port Ferdinando along the Outer Banks. The port appeared abandoned, and there were no signs of activity on Roanoke Island. Gonz\u00e1lez left without conducting a thorough investigation.  Although the Spanish believed Gonz\u00e1lez had located the secret English base, the defeat of the Spanish Armada prevented Phillip from immediately ordering an attack upon it. In 1590, a plan was made to destroy the Roanoke colony and set up a Spanish colony in Chesapeake Bay, but this was merely disinformation designed to misdirect English intelligence.<ref name=\"secrettoken\"/>{{rp|95\u201398}}\n\n===1590 relief mission===\n{{further|Watts' West Indies and Virginia expedition}}\n[[File:Ruins of the English Settlement at Roanoke.jpg|thumb|John White at the ruins of the Roanoke colony, 1590]]\nEventually, Walter Raleigh arranged passage for White on a privateering expedition organised by [[John Watts (merchant)|John Watts]].  The fleet of six ships would spend the summer of 1590 raiding Spanish outposts in the Caribbean, but the flagship ''Hopewell'' and the ''Moonlight'' would split off to take White to his colony.<ref name=\"secrettoken\"/>{{rp|97}}  At the same time, however, Raleigh was in the process of turning the venture over to new investors.<ref name=\"secrettoken\"/>{{rp|98}}\n\nThe ''Hopewell'' and ''Moonlight'' anchored at Croatoan Island on August 12, but there is no indication that White used the time to contact the Croatan for information.  On the evening of August 15, while anchored at the north end of [[Hatteras Island]], the crews sighted plumes of smoke on Roanoke Island; the following morning, they investigated another column of smoke on the southern end of Hatteras, but found nothing.<ref name=\"secrettoken\"/>{{rp|98}} White's landing party spent the next two days attempting to cross [[Pamlico Sound]] with considerable difficulty and loss of life.  On August 17 they sighted a fire on the north end of Roanoke Island and rowed towards it, but they reached the island after nightfall and decided not to risk coming ashore. The men spent the night in their anchored boats, singing English songs in hopes that the colonists would hear.<ref name=\"secrettoken\"/>{{rp|xvii-xix}}\n\nWhite and the others made landfall on the morning of August 18 (his granddaughter's third birthday). The party found fresh tracks in the sand, but were not contacted by anyone. They also discovered the letters \"CRO\" carved into a tree.  Upon reaching the site of the colony, White noted the area had been fortified with a palisade. Near the entrance of the fencing, the word \"CROATOAN\" was carved in one of the posts.<ref name=\"secrettoken\"/>{{rp|xix}}  White was certain these two inscriptions meant that the colonists had peacefully relocated to Croatoan Island, since they had agreed in 1587 that the colonists would leave a \"secret token\" indicating their destination, or a [[cross patt\u00e9e]] as a [[duress code]].<ref name=\"White 1590\">{{cite book |author-last=White |author-first=John |author-link=John White (colonist and artist) |chapter=The fift voyage of M.

However, the ''Hopewell'''s anchor cable snapped, leaving the ship with only one working cable and anchor.  The search mission could not continue given the considerable risk of shipwreck.  The ''Moonlight'' set off for England, but the crew of the ''Hopewell'' offered a compromise with White, in which they would spend winter in the Caribbean and return to the Outer Banks in the spring of 1591.  This plan fell through, though, when the ''Hopewell'' was blown off course, forcing them to stop for supplies in the Azores.

They described to him a place called \"Ocanahonan\", where men wore European-style clothing; and \"Anone\", which featured walled houses.  Later, after Smith returned to the colony, he made arrangements with Wowinchopunk, the king of the [[Paspahegh]], to investigate \"Panawicke\", another place reportedly inhabited by men in European dress.  The colony produced a crude map of the region with labels for these villages.  The map also featured a place called \"Pakrakanick\" with a note indicating \"Here remayneth 4 men clothed that came from Roonocok to Ocanahawan.\"<ref name=\"Fullam 2017\"/>{{rp|128\u2013133}}\n\nIn the summer of 1608 Smith sent a letter about this information, along with the map, back to England.

Her interest in the disappearance of the 1587 colony motivated various projects to establish a genetic link between the colonists and potential Native American descendants. Examining [[Autosome|autosomal DNA]] for this purpose is unreliable, as so little of the colonists' genetic material would remain after five or six generations. However, testing of [[Y chromosome]]s and [[Mitochondrial DNA]] is more reliable over large spans of time. The main challenge of this work is to obtain a genetic point of comparison, either from the remains of a Lost Colonist or one of their descendants. While it is conceivable to sequence DNA from 430-year-old bones, there are as yet no bones from the Lost Colony to work with.

When White returned to the colony in 1590, there was no sign of battle or withdrawal under duress, although the site was fortified.  There were no human remains or graves reported in the area, suggesting everyone left alive.

Little is known about the pinnace, but ships of its size were capable of making the trip, although they typically did so alongside other vessels.<ref name=\"Fullam 2017\"/>{{rp|83\u201384}}\n\nThe colonists may have feared that a standard route across the Atlantic Ocean, with a stop in the Caribbean, would risk a Spanish attack.  Nevertheless, it was feasible for the colonists to attempt a direct course to England.  In 1563, French settlers at the failed [[Charlesfort-Santa Elena Site#Charlesfort (1562\u20131563)|Charlesfort]] colony built a crude boat and successfully (albeit desperately) returned to Europe.  Alternatively, the Roanoke colonists could have sailed north along the coast, in the hopes of making contact with English fishing fleets in the [[Gulf of Maine]].<ref name=\"Fullam 2017\"/>{{rp|85\u201389}}\n\nThe pinnace would not have been large enough to carry all of the colonists.  Additionally, the provisions needed for a transatlantic voyage would further restrict the number of passengers.  The colonists may have possessed the resources to construct another seaworthy vessel, using local lumber and spare parts from the pinnace.  Considering the ships built by survivors of the 1609 ''Sea Venture'' shipwreck, it is at least possible that the Lost Colonists could produce a second ship that, with the pinnace, could transport most of their party.<ref name=\"Fullam 2017\"/>{{rp|84\u201390}}  Even in these ideal conditions, however, at least some colonists would remain in Virginia, leaving open the question of what became of them.<ref name=\"Stick1983\"/>{{rp|244}}\n\n===Powhatan attack at Chesapeake Bay===\n[[File:Powhatan john smith map.jpg|thumb|Chief Powhatan, detail of map published by John Smith (1612)]]\n[[David Beers Quinn]] concluded that the 1587 colonists sought to relocate to their original destination\u2014Chesapeake Bay\u2014using the pinnace and other small boats to transport themselves and their belongings.  A small group would have been stationed at Croatoan to await John White's return and direct him to the transplanted colony.  Following White's failure to locate any of the colonists, the main body of the colonists would have quickly assimilated with the [[Chesapeake people|Chesepians]], while the lookouts on Croatoan would have blended into the Croatan tribe.\n\nQuinn suggested that Samuel Mace's 1602 voyage might have ventured into Chesepeake Bay and kidnapped Powhatans to bring back to England.  From there these abductees would be able to communicate with Thomas Harriot, and might reveal that Europeans were living in the region.  Quinn evidently believed circumstances such as these were necessary to explain optimism about the colonists' survival after 1603.\n\nAlthough Strachey accused Wahunsenacawh of slaughtering the colonists and Chesepians in separate passages, Quinn decided that these events occurred in a single attack on an integrated community, in April 1607.  He supposed that Wahunsenacawh could have been seeking revenge for the speculative kidnappings by Mace.

However, the colonists would quickly spread European diseases among their hosts, decimating the Chowanoke and thereby destabilizing the balance of power in the region.  From there Miller reasoned that the Chowanoke were attacked, with the survivors taken captive, by the \"Mandoag\", a powerful nation to the west that the Jamestown colonists only knew from the vague accounts of their neighbors.<ref name=\"Miller2002\"/>{{rp|227\u2013237}}  She concluded that the Mandoag were the [[Eno people|Eno]], who traded the remaining Lost Colonists as slaves until they were dispersed throughout the region.<ref name=\"Miller2002\"/>{{rp|255\u2013260}}\n\nMiller's theory has been challenged based on Walsingham's considerable financial support of Raleigh's expeditions, and the willingness of Fernandes to bring John White back to England instead of abandoning him with the other colonists.<ref name=\"Fullam 2017\"/>{{rp|29\u201330}}\n\n===Secret operation at Beechland===\nLocal legends in Dare County refer to an abandoned settlement called \"Beechland\", located within what is now the [[Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge]].

All records suggesting the colony's intended destination was Chesapeake Bay, and that England had lost contact with the colony, were supposedly falsified to conceal the operation from Spanish operatives and other potential competitors.<ref name=\"McMullan 2010\">{{cite thesis |type=M.A. in History |last=McMullan |first=Philip S., Jr. |date=October 28, 2010 |title=Beechland and the Lost Colony |publisher=North Carolina State University |url=http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/resolver/1840.16/6486 |access-date=September 5, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"secrettoken\"/>{{rp|263}}\n\nAccording to McMullan, Raleigh quietly re-established contact with the colony by 1597, and his sassafras expeditions were simply picking up the colonists' harvests.  In this view, the colony was not truly abandoned until the secret of the colony's location died with Raleigh in 1618.  After that point, McMullan argued, the colonists would have begun to assimilate with the Croatan at Beechland.<ref name=\"McMullan 2010\"/>\n\nThis theory largely depends upon oral traditions and unsubstantiated reports about Beechland, as well as a 1651 map that depicts a sassafras tree near the Alligator River.  A significant problem is that Raleigh supposedly planned a sassafras farm in 1587 to capitalize on a dramatic increase in crop prices, so that he could quickly compensate for the great expense of the failed 1585 colony.<ref name=\"McMullan 2010\"/>  This overlooks the fact that Richard Grenville's privateering recovered the cost of the 1585 expedition.<ref name=\"secrettoken\"/>{{rp|60}}  Additionally, sassafras prices did not skyrocket in value until the late 1590s, well after the establishment of the 1587 colony.<ref name=\"secrettoken\"/>{{rp|112}}\n\n===CORA tree===\n\nIn 2006, writer Scott Dawson proposed that a [[Quercus virginiana|Southern live oak tree]] on Hatteras Island, which bears the faint inscription \"CORA\" in its bark, might be connected to the Lost Colony.  The CORA tree had already been the subject of local legends, most notably a story about a witch named \"Cora\" that was popularized in a 1989 book by [[Charles H. Whedbee]].  Nevertheless, Dawson argued that the inscription might represent another message from the colonists, similar to the \"CROATOAN\" inscription at Roanoke.<ref name=\"Fullam 2017\"/>{{rp|71-72}}  If so, \"CORA\" might indicate that the colonists left Croatoan Island to settle with the [[Coree]] (also known as the Coranine) on the mainland near [[Lake Mattamuskeet]].<ref name=\"Gabriel-Powell 2016\"/>{{rp|128}}\n\nA 2009 study to determine the age of the CORA tree was inconclusive.  Damage to the tree, caused by lightning and decay, has made it impossible to obtain a valid core sample for tree-ring dating.  Even if the tree dates back to the 16th century, though, establishing the age of the inscription would be another matter.<ref name=\"Fullam 2017\"/>{{rp|72-73}}\n\n===Dare Stones===\n{{Main|Dare Stones}}\nFrom 1937 to 1941, a series of [[Virginia Dare#Eleanor Dare Stones|inscribed stones]] was discovered that were claimed to have been written by [[Eleanor Dare]], mother of [[Virginia Dare]].

Todd predicts the fall of the United States as the sole [[superpower]].\n\nTodd examines the fundamental weaknesses of the US to conclude that, contrary to American [[conventional wisdom]], America is fast losing its grip on the world stage in economic, military and ideological terms.<ref name=\"Penkith2004\"/>\n\n==1976 prediction of Soviet collapse==\nTodd attracted attention in 1976 when, aged 25, he [[Predictions of Soviet collapse|predicted the fall of the Soviet Union]], based on indicators such as increasing [[infant mortality|infant-mortality]] rates. In the late 1970s Todd was widely pronounced \"[[anti-communist]]\", just as, following the publication of ''After the Empire'', he has been attacked as \"[[anti-American]]\". He challenges these labels and describes himself as a historian and anthropologist first; and it was his concern as a historian, rather than political passion, that motivated him to write ''After the Empire''. In late 2002 he believed that the world was about to repeat the same mistake that it had made in regard to the Soviet Union during the 1970s\u2014misinterpreting an expansion in US military activity as a sign of its increasing power, when in fact this aggression masks a decline.<ref name=\"Short2004\"/>\n\n==Post Cold War geopolitical climate==\nTodd writes that the United States became an empire not by strategy but by accident, following the sudden collapse of its main adversary, the Soviet Union. With the globalization of investment, it then indulged in the luxury of conspicuous consumption using incoming capital while going deeper and deeper into debt. In reality America is like a crumbling [[Roman empire]]\u2014overextended with excessive arms spending, inequality and disgruntlement at home.<ref name=\"Short2004\"/>  To keep the rest of the world in line, and prevent its creditors calling in their debts, all America needs to do then is to wield a big stick.<ref name=\"Penkith2004\"/>\n\n\"The real America is too weak to take on anyone except military midgets,\" Todd states.

In substance and rune, Todd's writing bears a strong resemblance to that of conservative intellectuals, like [[Robert Kagan]], who proclaim the inevitability of American dominance. But Todd's thesis is the exact opposite of the [[neocon]]s'...Like the neocons' worldview, Todd's theory combines a wishful vision of the future and nationalistic triumphalism in a way that sidesteps the facts...We and our allies are, in a word, interdependent. That may sound dull and 'interdependence' won't sell many books.

It asks why 'America is now commonly perceived as a [[narcissistic]], warmongering bully. How did a country that until recently played an essential role in building international order suddenly become a symbol of global disorder?'...I doubt that anyone will sign up for all of Emmanuel Todd's analysis, but this is a brave and challenging book which contains a great deal of truth.\"<ref name=\"Short2004\" />\n*\"''After the Empire'' is silly, mean-spirited, and anti-Semitic bile, bigoted to a degree that borders on racist condescension. It is poorly written and foolishly argued. When Todd thinks he has data supporting an argument, he uses them; when he wants to extend the argument to an area where there are inadequate data, he offers sweeping intuitions...\"<ref name = \"Kaplan2004\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Ideocracy]]\n*[[List of predictions]]\n*[[Political midlife crisis]]\n*[[State collapse]]\n*[[Thucydides Trap]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Booklist2003\">{{cite journal |date=November 15, 2003 |title =Todd, Emmanuel.

Todd also believes that Europe should rearrange geopolitical balance around an Eurasian pole consisting of an Europe led by a trio of France, Germany and the United Kingdom, relying on Russia to provide military support as well as oil and natural gas.<ref name=\"Booklist2003\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n*\"[Todd] has written what may be the most important work since [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s [[The End of History and the Last Man]] (1992)\"<ref name = \"lastman\">{{cite journal\n| date =January 15, 2004\n| title =Todd, Emmanuel.

In substance and rune, Todd's writing bears a strong resemblance to that of conservative intellectuals, like [[Robert Kagan]], who proclaim the inevitability of American dominance. But Todd's thesis is the exact opposite of the [[neocon]]s'...Like the neocons' worldview, Todd's theory combines a wishful vision of the future and nationalistic triumphalism in a way that sidesteps the facts...We and our allies are, in a word, interdependent. That may sound dull and 'interdependence' won't sell many books. But unlike the theories of Todd and the neocons, it happens to be true.\"<ref name = \"wm\">{{cite journal\n| first =Alexander \n| last =Kirshner \n| date =January 1, 2004\n| title =Eiffel cower: France's answer to the neocons\n| journal =Washington Monthly\n| url =http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-20240127_ITM\n}}</ref>\n*\"I would recommend this extraordinary book to everyone troubled by US neo-imperialism. It asks why 'America is now commonly perceived as a [[narcissistic]], warmongering bully. How did a country that until recently played an essential role in building international order suddenly become a symbol of global disorder?'...I doubt that anyone will sign up for all of Emmanuel Todd's analysis, but this is a brave and challenging book which contains a great deal of truth.\"<ref name=\"Short2004\" />\n*\"''After the Empire'' is silly, mean-spirited, and anti-Semitic bile, bigoted to a degree that borders on racist condescension. It is poorly written and foolishly argued. When Todd thinks he has data supporting an argument, he uses them; when he wants to extend the argument to an area where there are inadequate data, he offers sweeping intuitions...\"<ref name = \"Kaplan2004\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Ideocracy]]\n*[[List of predictions]]\n*[[Political midlife crisis]]\n*[[State collapse]]\n*[[Thucydides Trap]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Booklist2003\">{{cite journal |date=November 15, 2003 |title =Todd, Emmanuel.
