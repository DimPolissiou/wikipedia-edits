Most physicians, however, feared the possibility of smallpox fatally spreading and the social implications of deliberately infecting others. \n\nZabdiel Boylston of [[Harvard University]] was the only doctor who positively responded to Mather's call to action, beginning America's first public campaign of inoculation. On 26 June 1721, Boylston first inoculated his six year-old son Thomas, and then his 36 year-old slave and the slave's two year old son.<ref name= minardi>{{cite journal| title= The Boston Inoculation Controversy of 1721-1722: An Incident in the History of Race |journal = The William and Mary Quarterly|volume = 61|issue = 1| publisher= Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture | page= 57\u201382 | first= Margo | last= Minardi | date= January 2004 |jstor = 3491675|doi = 10.2307/3491675}}</ref>  To the doctor's relief, all survived relatively mild cases of smallpox without disability or disfigurement.

But a tutor at Harvard inspired by his research, Thomas Robie, continued vaccinating patients at Spectacle Island. One of his patients was another tutor, Nicholas Sevier, who returned to Harvard sixteen days after he was inoculated to report on the success of his procedure.

Inoculation also evoked anger from dubious physicians. William Douglass was a vehement inoculation opponent who published anti-inoculation pamphlets in response to Mather's experiment. One pamphlet published in ''The New England Courant'' read \"Some have been carrying about instruments of inoculation, and bottles of poisonous humor, to infect all who were willing to submit to it.

Boylston was ridiculed and satirized in the newspapers, portrayed as a [[Quackery|quack]] by Douglass and a French local physician named Dalhonde.<ref name=\"thatcher\" />    \n\nVariolation did present an inherent risk of death for 2% of those undergoing the procedure. This provided fertile ground for voices opposed to it. Furious rumors swirled around inoculation as ''The New England Courant'' published Douglass and Dalhonde's sensationalist articles against inoculation. <ref name= thatcher/> One article by Douglass darkly joked about using smallpox in inoculations to kill off surrounding native communities.<ref name=\"buhr\" /> Inoculation made Boylston notorious, and a colonial government that rejected the notion of inoculation was deeply skeptical of his and Mather's experiment. The [[Boston City Council]] summoned Boylston in early August to explain, and the Council condemned inoculation and ordered him to desist immediately.

Most physicians, however, feared the possibility of smallpox fatally spreading and the social implications of deliberately infecting others. \n\nZabdiel Boylston of [[Harvard University]] was the only doctor who positively responded to Mather's call to action, beginning America's first public campaign of inoculation.

{"title_page": "Rankenheim", "text_new": "'''Rankenheim''' is a [[mansion]] on Zemminsee in [[Gro\u00df K\u00f6ris]], [[Brandenburg]], approx. 50 kilometres south of [[Berlin]]. In [[Nazi Germany]] it was used as a camp for [[Teacher education|educating teachers]]. After 1945 it became a temporary hospital and eventually a place for \"maladjusted children\" during the GDR regime -  it is now a youth village. The surrounding district of Gro\u00df K\u00f6ris is called Rankenheim.\n\n==History==\nFriedrich Wilhelm Ranke was a Prussian councillor, brother of the historian [[Leopold von Ranke]]. Since 1843 he bought in Gro\u00df K\u00f6ris and neighbouring communities land where he built a brick factory and a bakery et al. and cut peat. In 1865 he built on a parcel of 15 hectare on the banks of Zemminsee a mansion, stables and outbuildings.<ref>Markus Vette: Wilhelm Ranke, 2014, pp 62.</ref> After Ranke's death on 16 June 1871, the property was transferred to a community of heirs, who sold it. After several changes of ownership of Rankenheim fell to [[Dresdner Bank]].\n\n[[File:Rankenheim auf der Karte der Provinz Brandenburg (Brockhaus 1894).png|thumb|Rankenheim on a map from Brockhaus, 1894]]\n\n==Third Reich era==\nDresdner Bank transferred Rankenheim 1935 to the \"Jubilee Foundation for Education\" which repurposed Rankenheim as a training camp for the \"Central Institute of Education\". Initially, the Institute carried out so-called 'National Political Courses' for students, as they were carried out in many places in Germany in camp school for indoctrination and disciplining of youth. Everyday life in the camps \"was strictly regulated and followed - as with all forms of Nazi camp education. A detailed service plan in which military training and ideological indoctrination played a prominent role.\"<ref>\u201eCamp and column are building the new reform of education\u201c - Nationalpolitische Lehrg\u00e4nge.[http://www.jugend1918-1945.de/thema.aspx?s=5102&m=965&open=5102]</ref>\n\nThe same time Rankenheim served as a \"Reichs seat for teacher instruction\" of the Central Institute, that conducted teacher training camps on behalf of the Nazi Ministry of Education. The first of these camps took place in October 1935 under the direction of Hans Reinerth and Alfred Pudelko.<ref>Deutsche Wissenschaft, Erziehung und Volksbildung - 1.1935, S. 160 f [http://goobiweb.bbf.dipf.de/viewer/resolver?urn=urn:nbn:de:0111-bbf-spo-8152211].</ref> In other camps, among others Rudolf Benze and [[Bernhard Kummer]] contributed their [[racism|racist ideas]], but also well known lecturers like the [[Indo-European studies|Indo-Germanist]] [[Kurt Stegmann of Pritzwald]] gave lectures here.<ref>Anastasia Antipova, Gerd Simon: Chronologie Stegmann, Kurt (von Pritzwald), 2011 [https://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/gerd.simon/ChrStegmann13.pdf]</ref>\n\nIn the beginning these camps were also held in the Western German [[Kettwig|Essen-Kettwig]]. When Germany started the [[World War II|war]] Rankenheim became the only place for teacher camps. The aim of these camps was to retrain all teachers to the National Socialist education ideology and to reorganize of the school system. 80-100 teachers from all over Germany were trained in several days (usually eight days) events with appeals, fatigue duty, sport, marches (or excursions) and (relatively short) lectures. Topics were such as \"military training in math and science classes\" whose goal was summarized as follows: \"It is always important to focus the students - according to their age and their kind - on the important things for the life and the self-assertion of the German people in his small lebensraum and thereby evoke their joyful willingness to full commitment to the maintenance of German soil and life.\"<ref>Kupsch: Bericht \u00fcber den Lehrgang \"Wehrerziehung im mathem. und naturwissenschaftlichen Unterricht\" in der Schulungsst\u00e4tte Rankenheim des Zentralinstituts f\u00fcr Erziehung und Unterricht, Berlin.

In [[Nazi Germany]] it was used as a camp for [[Teacher education|educating teachers]]. After 1945 it became a temporary hospital and eventually a place for \"maladjusted children\" during the GDR regime -  it is now a youth village. The surrounding district of Gro\u00df K\u00f6ris is called Rankenheim.\n\n==History==\nFriedrich Wilhelm Ranke was a Prussian councillor, brother of the historian [[Leopold von Ranke]]. Since 1843 he bought in Gro\u00df K\u00f6ris and neighbouring communities land where he built a brick factory and a bakery et al. and cut peat. In 1865 he built on a parcel of 15 hectare on the banks of Zemminsee a mansion, stables and outbuildings.<ref>Markus Vette: Wilhelm Ranke, 2014, pp 62.</ref> After Ranke's death on 16 June 1871, the property was transferred to a community of heirs, who sold it. After several changes of ownership of Rankenheim fell to [[Dresdner Bank]].\n\n[[File:Rankenheim auf der Karte der Provinz Brandenburg (Brockhaus 1894).png|thumb|Rankenheim on a map from Brockhaus, 1894]]\n\n==Third Reich era==\nDresdner Bank transferred Rankenheim 1935 to the \"Jubilee Foundation for Education\" which repurposed Rankenheim as a training camp for the \"Central Institute of Education\". Initially, the Institute carried out so-called 'National Political Courses' for students, as they were carried out in many places in Germany in camp school for indoctrination and disciplining of youth. Everyday life in the camps \"was strictly regulated and followed - as with all forms of Nazi camp education. A detailed service plan in which military training and ideological indoctrination played a prominent role.\"<ref>\u201eCamp and column are building the new reform of education\u201c - Nationalpolitische Lehrg\u00e4nge.[http://www.jugend1918-1945.de/thema.aspx?s=5102&m=965&open=5102]</ref>\n\nThe same time Rankenheim served as a \"Reichs seat for teacher instruction\" of the Central Institute, that conducted teacher trainings camps on behalf of the Nazi Ministry of Education. The first of these camps took place in October 1935 under the direction of Hans Reinerth and Alfred Pudelko.<ref>Deutsche Wissenschaft, Erziehung und Volksbildung - 1.1935, S. 160 f [http://goobiweb.bbf.dipf.de/viewer/resolver?urn=urn:nbn:de:0111-bbf-spo-8152211].</ref> In other camps, among others Rudolf Benze and [[Bernhard Kummer]] contributed their [[racism|racist ideas]], but also well known lecturers like the [[Indo-European studies|Indo-Germanist]] [[Kurt Stegmann of Pritzwald]] gave lectures here.<ref>Anastasia Antipova, Gerd Simon: Chronologie Stegmann, Kurt (von Pritzwald), 2011 [https://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/gerd.simon/ChrStegmann13.pdf]</ref>\n\nIn the beginning these camps were also held in the Western German [[Kettwig|Essen-Kettwig]]. When Germany started the [[World War II|war]] Rankenheim became the only place for teacher camps. The aim of these camps was to retrain all teachers to the National Socialist education ideology and to reorganize of the school system. 80-100 teachers from all over Germany were trained in several days (usually eight days) events with appeals, fatigue duty, sport, marches (or excursions) and (relatively short) lectures. Topics were such as \"military training in math and science classes\" whose goal was summarized as follows: \"It is always important to focus the students - according to their age and their kind - on the important things for the life and the self-assertion of the German people in his small lebensraum and thereby evoke their joyful willingness to full commitment to the maintenance of German soil and life.\"<ref>Kupsch: Bericht \u00fcber den Lehrgang \"Wehrerziehung im mathem. und naturwissenschaftlichen Unterricht\" in der Schulungsst\u00e4tte Rankenheim des Zentralinstituts f\u00fcr Erziehung und Unterricht, Berlin.
