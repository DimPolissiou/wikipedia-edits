Formerly placed in the [[Old World flycatcher]] [[family (biology)|family]], Muscicapidae, it is now separated with some other \"odd flycatchers\" as the new family [[Stenostiridae]] (Beresford ''et al.'' 2005, Fuchs ''et al.'' 2006). It is the only member of the genus '''''Stenostira'''''.\n\nIt is an endemic resident breeder in southern [[Africa]] in [[Botswana]], [[South Africa]],  [[Lesotho]] and [[Namibia]], and a vagrant to [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Swaziland]].\n\n''Stenostira scita'' is a common seasonal [[bird migration|migrant]], breeding in [[karoo]] scrub and [[fynbos]] in the southern highlands, and migrating north in to spend the southern winter in thorn scrub at lower altitudes.\n\n==Description==\nThe fairy flycatcher is 11\u201312&nbsp;cm in length. The adult is pale grey above with a black mask through the eye and a white [[supercilium]]. The wings are black with a long white stripe, and the long black tail has white sides. The throat is white, the breast is pale grey, and the belly is white with a pinkish-grey wash to its centre. The sexes are alike, but the juvenile is browner than the adult. The eye is brown and the bill and legs are black.\n\n==Behaviour==\nThe fairy flycatcher is monogamous unless its mate dies, when it will seek a new partner. It builds an open cup nest from thin stems and other plant material and lined with plant down. It is placed in the branches of a tree or shrub but well concealed. The female lays two or three green eggs.<ref>{{cite journal|author=James, H.
