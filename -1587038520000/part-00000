Installation of fabric filters with efficiency of 99.9% at power units Nos.4 and 5 of Reftinskaya GRES with capacity of 300 MW each will prevent emission of about of 30,000 tons of ash into the atmosphere per year, and together with power unit No.7 that was previously put into operation about 40,000 tons of ash per year at the maximum load. Within power unit technical refurbishment advanced technologies, many of them were applied for the first time in Russia, were used. So, to ensure optimal flue gas cleaning modes at each power unit 300 MW, 14,600 ash collecting \"bags\" were installed. For this, a total of 3,000 tons of steel structures of electrostatic filters were dismantled. At the same time, as part of the modernization works, low-emission burners were installed at power unit No.5 to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. In addition to improving the environmental parameters of the power units, modernization also made it possible to increase the reliability and efficiency of equipment and reduce fuel consumption.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tass.ru/ural-news/2111857|title=\u041c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u0420\u0424 \u0420\u0435\u0444\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0413\u0420\u042d\u0421 \u0441\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u044b\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0441\u044b \u0437\u043e\u043b\u044b \u043d\u0430 40 \u0442\u044b\u0441. \u0442\u043e\u043d\u043d \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0434|website=\u0422\u0410\u0421\u0421|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref>\n\nOn 29 September 2015, Enel Russia solemnly presented one of its largest environmental projects \u2013 dry ash removal system at Reftinskaya GRES. At the moment, it is the first such system used in power plants in Russia. Enel Russia invested in this project more than RUB 12.5 bln. First time in Russia, the traditional, hydraulic method of ash and slag waste removal at the coal-fired power plant has been replaced by a new, \"dry\" method. It will increase significantly the volume of industrial utilization of ash generated as a by-product of the coal-fired power plant. Dry ash can be widely used in areas such as road construction, agriculture, and production of construction materials. Railway is provided to new dry ash removal system that makes it possible to send dry ash both by road and by rail. Potentially the DARS will allow shipping the entire amount of ash produced at the power plant to industrial consumers, and its amount is up to five million tons per year. The entire non-demanded volume of dry ash is transported using the tubular belt conveyor (TBC), length 4.5&nbsp;km, to the ash disposal area, where the ash stack is leveled and compacted. Dusting is prevented by surface water irrigation. Next, soil is laid on the prepared surface sown with herbs. Implementation of DARS complex will reduce significantly water consumption for ash storage, making it possible to continue to use the existing ash disposal area No.2 of Reftinskaya GRES within following 35 years and save hundreds of forest hectares from deforestation. Reftinskaya GRES DARS project was implemented within the Environmental Agreement signed between Enel Russia and the Government of the Sverdlovsk Region at INNOPROM in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.energyland.info/analitic-show-140270|title=Energyland.info \u2013 \u0410\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430. \u0418\u0437\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0442 \u0437\u043e\u043b\u044b \u0432\u0441\u0443\u0445\u0443\u044e|website=www.energyland.info|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2017, new gas cleaning system allowing modern electrostatic filters to prevent emission of 13 thousand tons of ash into the atmosphere per year was installed at power unit No.1 of Reftinskaya GRES.

Konakovskaya GRES construction started in 1962, and on 10 January 1965, the first power unit was put into operation. This date is considered the day of KGRES foundation. The power plant was built in two phases: 4 power units with turbo-units with capacity of 300 MW each. Konakovskaya GRES construction was fully completed in 1969. The main fuel is natural gas; the backup fuel is fuel oil.\n\n== Prospects ==\n'''Reftinskaya GRES'''\n\n[[Reftinskaya GRES]] is a coal-fired thermal power plant with a total installed electric capacity of 3,800 MW. It consists of 6 power units of 300 MW and 4 power units of 500 MW. Its installed heat capacity is 350 Gcal/h. Ekibastuz coal is used as main fuel at [[Reftinskaya GRES]]. The first unit was put into operation on 28 December 1970, and the last one - on 21 December 1980.\n\nReftinskaya GRES provides power supply to consumers in the Ural region with power output to the Interconnected Power System (IPS) of Russia. The share of electricity generated by Reftinskaya GRES of the total electricity consumed by Sverdlovsk region is about 40%. Reftinskaya GRES will continue to be in temporary operation by PJSC Enel Russia within transition period necessary to complete the transaction with Kuzbassenergo JSC that obtained the right to Power Plant possession on 1 October 2019.\n\nPJSC Enel Russia continues to implement major projects in the field of environmental protection improving the safety of works, and introduction of energy-efficient technologies. Modern fabric filters with the efficiency almost 30 times higher than that of previously installed electrostatic precipitators are installed at Reftinskaya GRES. In 2013, the first fabric filter was installed at power unit No.5. Installation of such equipment will lead to reduction in the content of dust particles in emissions by almost 98%, and the amount of nitric oxide - by 30%. In the near future, the Company plans to modernize other power units of the power plant. In particular, at the moment fabric filters are in process of installation at power units Nos.7 and 4. The second large-scale environmental project of Reftinskaya GRES is reconstruction of the dry ash removal system: conversion from the hydraulic method to dry ash removal. After implementation of the system, the volume of used water resources will significantly decrease and the possibility of using ash for industrial purposes will increase.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://midural.ru/news/list/document49992/|website=midural.ru|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> In 2014, Reftinskaya GRES become the winner of EcoResponsibility Competition established by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the Sverdlovsk Region for implementation of measures in the field of environmental protection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ruscable.ru/news/2014/09/30/Reftinskaya_GRES_stala_pobeditelem_konkursa_Ekootv/|title=\u0420\u0435\u0444\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0413\u0420\u042d\u0421 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0430 \"\u042d\u043a\u043e\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\"|website=www.ruscable.ru|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref>\n\nThe main Sredneuralskaya GRES projects are related to power plant district heating system modernization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eanews.ru/news/energetics_zhkh/s_7_po_27_iyulya_v_verhney_pyishme_sredneuralske_i_chasti_ekaterinburga_otklyuchat_goryachuyu_vodu|title=\u0421 7 \u043f\u043e 27 \u0438\u044e\u043b\u044f \u0432 \u0412\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u041f\u044b\u0448\u043c\u0435, \u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u0438 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0415\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0430\u0442 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0447\u0443\u044e \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0443|website=\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0430\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \"\u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e-\u0410\u0437\u0438\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\"|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> Sredneuralskaya GRES implements a five-year plan for Isetskoye reservoir stocking with fish.

At the moment, it is the first such system used in power plants in Russia. Enel Russia invested in this project more than RUB 12.5 bln. First time in Russia, the traditional, hydraulic method of ash and slag waste removal at the coal-fired power plant has been replaced by a new, \"dry\" method. It will increase significantly the volume of industrial utilization of ash generated as a by-product of the coal-fired power plant. Dry ash can be widely used in areas such as road construction, agriculture, and production of construction materials. Railway is provided to new dry ash removal system that makes it possible to send dry ash both by road and by rail. Potentially the DARS will allow shipping the entire amount of ash produced at the power plant to industrial consumers, and its amount is up to five million tons per year. The entire non-demanded volume of dry ash is transported using the tubular belt conveyor (TBC), length 4.5&nbsp;km, to the ash disposal area, where the ash stack is leveled and compacted. Dusting is prevented by surface water irrigation. Next, soil is laid on the prepared surface sown with herbs. Implementation of DARS complex will reduce significantly water consumption for ash storage, making it possible to continue to use the existing ash disposal area No.2 of Reftinskaya GRES within following 35 years and save hundreds of forest hectares from deforestation. Reftinskaya GRES DARS project was implemented within the Environmental Agreement signed between Enel Russia and the Government of the Sverdlovsk Region at INNOPROM in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.energyland.info/analitic-show-140270|title=Energyland.info - \u0410\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430. \u0418\u0437\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0442 \u0437\u043e\u043b\u044b \u0432\u0441\u0443\u0445\u0443\u044e|website=www.energyland.info|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2017, new gas cleaning system allowing modern electrostatic filters to prevent emission of 13 thousand tons of ash into the atmosphere per year was installed at power unit No.1 of Reftinskaya GRES.

He contributed to the compilation of the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary from 1982 until its completion in 2010 and partook in the Ziyaret Tepe archaeological expedition as Senior Epigraphist in 2001\u20132006.\n\n== Research ==\n\n=== Overview ===\nThe main focus of Parpola's research has been on the study of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in all its aspects (language, literature, history, geography, society, religion, royal ideology and sciences), but he has also contributed to the study of the [[Indus script]], [[Sumerian language]], [[Jewish mysticism]] and [[Assyrian nationalism|Assyrian identity]] in post-empire times, among others. In 1986 he initiated a long-term international research project to edit Neo-Assyrian sources (The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project),<ref>Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project, see http://www.helsinki.fi/science/saa/, retrieved 2016-05-17</ref> which has resulted in a 19-volume series of standard text editions (State Archives of Assyria)<ref>State Archives of Assyria, see http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/, retrieved 2016-05-17</ref> and in a digital corpus of texts written in the Neo-Assyrian language. The published series contains cuneiform texts, transcriptions and translations of first hand records written by civil servants, professionals and administrators and are considered to be an important source accessible to scholars of many disciplines. In 1998, Parpola started the [[Melammu Project]], an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] project that investigates the continuity, transformation and diffusion of [[Mesopotamia]]n culture in the classical world and thereafter.\n\n=== \"The Assyrian roots of Christianity\" ===\nParpola, in a study published in 2004 entitled: [https://www.academia.edu/9468007/Mount_Nisir_and_the_Foundations_of_the_Assyrian_Church Mount ''Nisir and the Foundations of the Assyrian Church'']'','' argues that the [[Christian Church|Christian church]] was \"..built on foundations laid by [[Assyria]]..\", and that \"..the continuity and survival of Assyrian ideas in Christianity must be taken seriously.\". He comes to this conclusion by assessing what he considers to be parallels in both [[Christianity]] and the [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]], and states that [[Assyriology|Assyriologists]] generally avoid and reject the belief structure and central components in regards to ancient Mesopotamia.\n\n== Academic honours ==\n* Finnish Professor of the Year, 1992.<ref>See Finnish pages of the Finnish Union of University Professors, http://www.professoriliitto.fi/professorit/vuoden-professori/, retrieved 2016-05-17</ref>\n* J.

Between 1973 and 1976 he was Docent of Assyriology and Research Fellow at the University of Helsinki, and from 1977 to 1979 Associate Professor of Assyriology with tenure at the Oriental Institute<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://oi.uchicago.edu/|title=The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago|access-date=2016-05-17}}</ref> of the [[University of Chicago]]. He was appointed Extraordinary Professor of Assyriology at the University of Helsinki in 1978 and has directed the University\u2019s Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project<ref>[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/saa/ Neo-Assyrian Corpus Project] at the University of Helsinki</ref> since 1986. He taught at the University of Padua as Visiting Professor in Spring 1995, and worked as Research Fellow in the Institute for Advanced Studies, Hebrew University<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.as.huji.ac.il/|title=The Institute for Advanced Studies|website=www.as.huji.ac.il|access-date=2016-05-17}}</ref> in 1999. He contributed to the compilation of the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary from 1982 until its completion in 2010 and partook in the Ziyaret Tepe archaeological expedition as Senior Epigraphist in 2001\u20132006.\n\n== Research ==\n\n=== Overview ===\nThe main focus of Parpola's research has been on the study of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in all its aspects (language, literature, history, geography, society, religion, royal ideology and sciences), but he has also contributed to the study of the [[Indus script]], [[Sumerian language]], [[Jewish mysticism]] and [[Assyrian nationalism|Assyrian identity]] in post-empire times, among others. In 1986 he initiated a long-term international research project to edit Neo-Assyrian sources (The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project),<ref>Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project, see http://www.helsinki.fi/science/saa/, retrieved 2016-05-17</ref> which has resulted in a 19-volume series of standard text editions (State Archives of Assyria)<ref>State Archives of Assyria, see http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/, retrieved 2016-05-17</ref> and in a digital corpus of texts written in the Neo-Assyrian language. The published series contains cuneiform texts, transcriptions and translations of first hand records written by civil servants, professionals and administrators and are considered to be an important source accessible to scholars of many disciplines. In 1998, Parpola started the [[Melammu Project]], an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] project that investigates the continuity, transformation and diffusion of [[Mesopotamia]]n culture in the classical world and thereafter.\n\n=== \"The Assyrian roots of Christianity\" ===\nParpola, in a study published in 2004 entitled: [https://www.academia.edu/9468007/Mount_Nisir_and_the_Foundations_of_the_Assyrian_Church Mount ''Nisir and the Foundations of the Assyrian Church'']'','' argues that the [[Christian Church|Christian church]] was \"..built on foundations laid by [[Assyria]]..\", and that \"..the continuity and survival of Assyrian ideas in Christianity must be taken seriously.\". He comes to this conclusion by assessing what he considers to be parallels in both [[Christianity]] and the [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]], and states that [[Assyriology|Assyriologists]] generally avoid and reject the belief structure and central components in regards to ancient Mesopotamia.\n<br />\n\n== Academic honours ==\n* Finnish Professor of the Year, 1992.<ref>See Finnish pages of the Finnish Union of University Professors, http://www.professoriliitto.fi/professorit/vuoden-professori/, retrieved 2016-05-17</ref>\n* J.

It is located in the [[Vale of White Horse]] near the [[River Thames]], across the road from the twelfth-century [[Norman architecture|Norman]] Hall and the [[Manor House (Sutton Courtenay)|Manor House]]. The Abbey has been recognised by the [[Historic buildings council|Historic Building Council for England]] (now [[Historic England]]) as a building of outstanding historic and [[architecture|architectural]] interest.<ref name=abbeyarchives>The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay archives.</ref> It is considered to be a \u2018textbook\u2019 example of the English medieval [[manor house]]{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} and has been a [[listed building#Grade I|Grade I-listed]] building since 1952.<ref name=listed />\n\nThe Abbey has its origins in the thirteenth century as a [[clergy house|rectory]] of [[Abingdon Abbey]], a [[Benedictines|Benedictine]] [[monastery]] up north in [[Abingdon-on-Thames]]. Several construction phases took place during the Middle Ages, carried out by prominent figures like [[Solomon of Rochester]], [[Thomas Beckington]] and [[William Say (priest)|William Say]], but it wasn't until the seventeenth century that the current plan was completed.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}} It was probably during the [[Victorian era]] that the house acquired the name 'The Abbey'.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> From 1495 to 1867, The Abbey was in possession of [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel]] at [[Windsor Castle]], who leased the estate among others to [[John Fettiplace (politician died 1580)|John Fettiplace]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}}\n\nAfter being inhabited by [[Evelyn St. Croix Fleming]], the estate was bought by [[David Astor]] in 1958, who leased it to the [[Ockenden International|Ockenden Venture]] which offered sanctuary to refugees and displaced children. In the 70s, The Abbey was lent to the exiled Bishop [[Colin Winter]] to house the [[Namibia International Peace Centre]]. In 1978, the [[Astor family]] sold the house and in 1980 it came into possession of The New Era Centre, a [[foundation (nonprofit)|non-profit charity]] led by Dr. [[Fred Blum]] and Bishop [[Stephen Verney]].<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The New Era Centre used The Abbey as a [[retreat (spiritual)|spiritual retreat]] and conference centre, and changed its name to '''The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay''' in the 1990s.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> \n\nThe Abbey, Sutton Courtenay is a residential centre in which a [[spiritualism|spiritual]] community offers hospitality to people seeking [[personal development|personal growth]], spiritual refreshment and [[healing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=278687&subid=0|title=The Abbey Sutton Courtenay Limited|website=[[Charity Commission for England and Wales]]|access-date=20 March 2020}}</ref> The Abbey also runs a programme of events for the public in the areas of spirituality, personal development, education, music and the arts.<ref name=abingdon />\n\n== Buildings ==\n[[File:Plan_of_The_Abbey,_Sutton_Courtenay.png|thumb|A plan of the main building (ground floor).]]\nThe Abbey forms a [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] with an inner [[courtyard]]. It has 28 rooms and a [[great hall]].<ref name=abbeyarchives /> The building has two storeys and is constructed from stone and timber with clay roof tiles. Originally, the roof would have been thatched. Four ranges are arranged around the central courtyard. The oldest part of The Abbey was originally built in timber frame and consisted of the north and west ranges, parts of which were later encased in stone to stabilise the structure.\n\nNowadays, there is also a guest house which is used for customers, conference guests and visitors. It is adjacent to the main house and it has its own kitchen with a dining area. The guest house has nine rooms in total, five twins and four single rooms.<ref name=abbeystaying>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/staying-at-the-abbey/|title=Staying at The Abbey|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2020}}</ref>\n\nThe main entrance to The Abbey was through the rear door of a cross passage which served to separate the great hall from the service wing. Nowadays, the main entrance is on the east side with a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] arch, a 1980s insertion replacing a narrow door, leading to the courtyard.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}}\n\nNineteenth-century accounts of the site show many inaccuracies.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} [[Edward Blore]] made sketches of the interior of the hall and of the house as seen from the northwest, which served as the basis of the engravings published by [[John Henry Parker]] in 1853.{{sfn|Parker|1853|p=272}} Parker also published a plan, but this was inaccurate in detail.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} [[Peter Spencer Spokes]] and John M.

The wing is largely timber-framed. On the ground floor at the southwest end, the wing seems to incorporate a stone wall of an earlier structure, in which lateral chimney stacks have been built with fire places dating from the nineteenth century. The plastered stone wall on the south side, which is of timber above the first floor, is an underbuilding for an [[overhang (architecture)|overhang]]. The north wall consists of large [[ashlar]] blocks suggesting that that was done between the fifteenth and seventeenth century and it had a three-light [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]] window. Its timber-framed north wall is also the south wall of the great hall. The [[dormer]] roof between the truss of the great hall and the service wing is done in a thirteenth-century technique. The roof of the service wing itself, however, is post-medieval.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=228}} Today, the service wing houses the [[solitary confinement|meditation room]] and accommodation.<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\nThe great hall was originally timber-framed and integrated with the contemporary service wing. It was cased in stone between 1320 and 1340 to prevent deforming of the base crucks under [[shear stress]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=232}} The hall has two equal [[bay (architecture)|bays]] and the four two-light windows have been replaced in the twentieth century by three-light Perpendicular windows. The stonework of the northern doorway was largely renewed in the nineteenth century. It has wave-moulded [[jamb]]s, [[voussoir]]s and an [[ogee]]-scroll [[hood mould]]. The original southern doorway was less important and similar in style, but with [[chamfer]]ed jambs. The east wall abuts the north range with a straight joint, while the joint of the north range with the west wall is obscured by plaster. The doorway in the east wall has been rebuilt in brick.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=228}} The west wall of the hall is [[battlement|castellated]] and probably early nineteenth century.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The great hall survives open to the roof, with one cruck truss carrying a [[king post]] which is unique in that it was never hidden by a ceiling.<ref name=abbeyhistory>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/history/|title=The Abbey - 800 Years of History|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2020}}</ref> The workmanship of the timber structure is of exceptional quality. The main timbers are made from very large trees carefully sawn to avoid waney edges.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=231}} All four posts have been made from the same tree. The structure has nineteenth- and twentieth-century renovations.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=232}} It has a wooden floor and can accommodate up to sixty people seated.<ref name=abbeystaying />\n\n=== North range ===\n[[File:Library, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay 01.jpg|thumb|The library.]]\nIn the courtyard between the north and west range is a timber-framed staircase outshut, dating from before the stone casing of the early fourteenth century. The stair is modern and leads to a door on the first floor of the north range. The outshut roof was probably repaired in the seventeenth century with an inserted [[purlin]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=233}}\n\nThe northern range is roofed in six bays. The western three bays were originally also built in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, while the eastern three bays of the northern range have timber work in the roof that indicates a fifteenth-century date.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=233}}\n\nThe finish of the timbers of the three western bays in the north range is of inferior quality to that of the hall. On the ground floor was a [[parlour]] now used as a dining room, located under the two most western bays. The walls of this parlour vary in size. The west wall contains a three-light Perpendicular window, the north wall contains three two-light ones. The present fireplace is modern but there must have been a chimney since the fifteenth century.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=234}} East of the parlour, the floor level rises and there is a [[cross passage]]. The door at the north end of the passage became blocked and was reopened only in the 1980s. East to the passage, under the third bay from the west, is a lodged floor. Originally, the bay was divided in a room to the north and a narrow room or corridor to the south.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=235}} The first floor was intended as a [[great chamber]], the second most important room in a medieval English manor house. This chamber was entered through a door from the staircase outshut. It is dominated by two fourteenth-century two-light [[transom (architecture)|transom]] windows in the west [[gable]] and in the north wall. The reveals of a third window also remain in the north wall.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The present fireplace has [[musician]] [[corbel]]s from the fifteenth century.{{sfn |Wood |1965 |p=XVIIE (plate)}} It had the same open roof structure as the great hall until probably the seventeenth century, when the space was divided into two rooms, with a corridor on the south side of the eastern room. These rooms now serve as the library and dining room respectively.<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\n[[File:Solar, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The [[solar (room)|solar]].]]\nOn the ground floor of the three eastern bays, the third bay from the east was probably open to the roof and is nowadays part of the same room with the third bay from the west (the room east of the parlour). It has a small [[lancet window]] in the northern wall at the base of the chimney. The two eastern most bays formed one room and has a modern partition from a corridor to the south. The north and east walls are both from stone, and at the east end of the northern wall is a blocked window. The other two windows are modern. An overhang projected northwards to the room. The present timber south wall replaced a stone wall, remains of which were found during [[plumbing]] operations in 1987-8.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=236}} On the first floor there was a [[solar (room)|solar]] in the second and third bay from the east which was to the south divided from the dining room by a timber-framed partition. On the north side, there are two nineteenth- or twentieth-century Gothic windows flanking a large chimney with a fireplace. There may have been a partition in the middle of the room before the fireplace was built. The solar has a partition to the east behind which was a [[chapel]] and a door from the north to the east range.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=235}}\n\n=== East range ===\n[[File:Arch, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|East entrance looking into the courtyard.]]\nThe east range, which today holds the entrance archway, was constructed around 1500 and contains three bays. The modern gatehouse, at the northern end of the east range, has a lancet window in its east wall. It has a jettied timber frame upper on existing stone walls.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> \n\nSouth of the archway, the wall was timber framed but later partially infilled with brick and rubble as far as the chimney, where it abuts the south range. This timber framed wall is on a different alignment than the gatehouse, probably to unite with the south wall of the southeastern block, which may have been a wall around the building rather than part of a building.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}}\n\nThe roof of the southern bay of the east range was black-smokened and may have served as a kitchen or [[brewhouse]] at some time into which a chimney was later inserted.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}}\n\n=== South range ===\n[[File:Hearth, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The Hearth, a meeting room in the south range.]]\nThe adjoining southeast corner block appears to have been roofed, probably in the seventeenth century, to connect the east range with the south range, completing the plan to create a courtyard.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}} \n\nThe south range, extending the service wing, was added during the mid-sixteenth century. The two storey structure consisting of three bays was open to the eaves and once served as a kitchen.<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\nNowadays, the southeast corner block contains a meeting room called 'The Hearth', seating up to eighteen people.<ref name=abbeystaying /> The south range is now used as The Abbey\u2019s administration office.\n\n== Grounds ==\n[[File:Avenue1, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The lime tree avenue.]]\n[[File:Courtyard2, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The courtyard garden.]]\nIn 1804, Francis Justice, who was in possession of the estate at the time, was allotted over two acres on the green north of the house.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=224}} As a result of this enlargement of the [[curtilage]], The Abbey now stands in the midst of extensive grounds and is approached by an [[avenue (landscape)|avenue]] of [[Tilia|lime trees]] across the enclosure allotment, leading near to the east of the house. Although the avenue across the grounds appears to have existed before the enclosure (some trees are older than 1804) the house stood on the eastern edge of its curtilage until 1798. The old boundary wall survives, only circa two meters beyond the east wall of the house.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} Nowadays, The Abbey consists of six acres of grounds which are of [[archaeology|archaeological]] importance because the remains of ancillary buildings underlie the gardens.<ref name=abbeyarchives /> The [[perimeter]] is marked by old stone walls, dead hedging and wooden fencing.\n\nSome four and a half acres of the land are used as gardens. On the north lawn, there is a [[Platanus|plane tree]] surrounded by [[Narcissus (plant)|daffodils]]. Here grow [[Rhododendron|rhododendrons]], [[Acer campestre|field maple]] (with a gnarled [[bark (botany)|bark]]), [[bramble]], [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[beech]], [[Acer pseudoplatanus|sycamore]], [[oak]], [[Hedera|ivy]] and various [[Pinophyta|conifers]]. There are also [[Lauraceae|laurels]], winter-flowering ''[[Viburnum]]'', [[Symphoricarpos|snowberry]], a young [[Prunus serrulata|Japanese cherry]] and [[maple]]. A trunk and several branches from an old [[Fagus sylvatica#Cultivation|copper beech]] serve as a place for [[fungus|fungi]] and [[lichen]]s to grow on. Under the trees, there is a purpose built woodstore. On the west lawn, there is a [[Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia|London planetree]]. The south lawn has a [[labyrinth]] in it, where the [[maypole]] is erected. This lawn as young [[Sequoioideae|redwood]] and several varieties of [[apple]] and [[plum]] trees. Furthermore, The Abbey has mature [[live oak]], [[Taxus baccata|yew]], [[Prunus avium|wild cherry]], [[Prunus subg. Padus|bird cherry]], [[Morus (plant)|mulberry]] and a [[Cedrus libani|cedar of Lebanon]]. In 1991, a project was completed which took care for the trees and [[transplanting|transplanted]] various species around the grounds. There is also a small secluded [[orchard]] adjacent to the grounds, where honey is produced from The Abbey's own [[mason bee|mason]] and [[honey bee]]s. The guest house area contains ivy, yew, apple, [[Euonymus|spindle]], [[Sambucus|elder]] and [[Viburnum lantana|wayfarer]] together with many [[Rosa setigera|climbing roses]], [[Salvia officinalis|sage]] and [[fern]]s.<ref name=abbeygrounds>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/grounds/|title=The Abbey Grounds|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|access-date=19 March 2020|date=2020}}</ref>\n\nThe courtyard garden has a [[Ficus|fig tree]], ''[[Magnolia]]'', [[rose]]s and a medieval style flower bed surrounded by a mature ''[[Buxus]]'' hedging. This garden was restored during the 1990s with [[gravel]]led paths and redesigned by B. Vellacot, a local volunteer. Around the main building there are flower beds with plants such as ''[[Fuchsia]]'', [[Lavandula|lavender]], [[Vinca|periwinkle]], [[Brunnera macrophylla|Siberian bugloss]], sage, [[Helichrysum italicum|curry plants]], [[catnip]], [[rosemary]], [[Jasminum nudiflorum|winter jasmine]] and [[Spiraea|spirea]]. There is also a herb bed near the kitchen underneath a [[Betula pendula|silver birch]]. The walled [[kitchen garden]] has a [[wildflower]] meadow, a cut flower bed, a [[strawberry]] bed and trees including [[olive]], [[Ficus|fig]], [[Prunus cerasus|morello cherry]], [[damson]], plum, [[pear]], [[quince]] and [[greengage]].

In the eleventh century, [[William the Conquerer]] granted the estate of Sutton to the [[House of Courtenay]], and the village became Sutton Courtenay.<ref name=abbeyarchives /> In 1090, King [[William II of England]] granted the [[All Saints' Church, Sutton Courtenay|church of Sutton]] and its lands and [[tithe]]s to the monks of Abingdon Abbey.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}}\n\nAbingdon Abbey constructed The Abbey as a [[monastic grange]], used as an administrative centre for the abbey's land and tithe holdings.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> However, the owner of the hide of land, Alwi the priest (whose father owned the land before him according to the [[Domesday Book]]), agreed with the [[abbot]] that he should retain Sutton with reversion first to his son and thereafter to the abbey, on condition of giving in [[Milton, Vale of White Horse|Milton]] chapelry immediately.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=28}} Almost certainly in the late twelfth century, Abingdon Abbey took two thirds of the tithes and the [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] the remaining third.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=104-5}} In 1258, following a dispute, the land was formally appropriated to the abbey and a [[clergy house|vicarage]] was ordained.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=106}} As it was close to Abingdon Abbey, it was probably run by the monks themselves rather than being left to a steward.<ref name=berkshirehistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/castles/scourtenay_abbey.html|title=The Abbey at Sutton Courtenay|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2004|work=Royal Berkshire History|author=David Nash Ford}}</ref> In 1278, however, [[Hugh de Courtenay]], Lord of the [[Manor House (Sutton Courtenay)|Manor of Sutton]], sued the abbey for [[advowson]].

Many of these men rarely visited Sutton, leaving the running of The Abbey to various underlings. William Steele, rector in 1371, left money to each of his four servants in Sutton. Robert of Walsham, rector from 1372 to 1384 and Dean of [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], may have resided intermittently. His successor John Yernemouth was rector from 1384 to 1397 and did not reside but hired a chaplain to perform his duties. John Yernemouth was the [[chaplain]] of Prince [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England]]. He left the rectory to William Brouns, father of Bishop [[Thomas Brunce|Thomas Brouns]], and two others sometime before 1394. By then, the building had become ruinous and badly roofed. Walter Medford, later [[Archdeacon of Berkshire]], was rector from 1397 to 1413 and may well have used the house. His successor, Nicholas Colnet, also may have resided at the rectory. Colnet was the doctor of King [[Henry V of England]] and was rector until 1420. He left money to the church and poor of Sutton.<ref>[[Berkshire Record Office]], D/EP 7/123.</ref> [[Thomas Beckington]], rector since 1420 and secretary of King [[Henry VI of England]], stayed at Sutton twice in 1442 and perhaps on other occasions.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=224}} The ceiling of the solar is attributed to Beckington.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> In 1442, he was accompanied by [[William Say (priest)|William Say]], who succeeded him as rector when Beckington became [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]] in 1443.{{sfn |Fletcher |1990 |p=60-2}} In 1444, Say obtained license to celebrate divine office in the house.

In 1984, after The Abbey was improved to a habitable state, the first two resident community members moved in. Stephen Verney extensively discussed, and believed in, the role Buddhist practice and philosophy could play in increasing connectivity with a Christian deity, and it was this belief which led many of The New Era Centre\u2019s early pursuits.<ref name=abbeyarchives /> Blum spent decades researching, interviewing and publishing on [[Mahatma Gandhi]]\u2019s life works and legacy.

Sourcing funding was difficult, and some potential investors remained unconvinced that the founders high ideals could lead to anything other than a misuse of funds. However, Blum and Verney remained committed to their project, disputing each critical point. Much of the work was carried out in a co-operative form, such as the 'work camp' of 1981, a community of enthusiastic volunteers. Volunteers from organisations such as [[WWOOF]] UK and [[HelpX]] still play a vital role in keeping The Abbey alive.

The north wall consists of large [[ashlar]] blocks suggesting that that was done between the fifteenth and seventeenth century and it had a three-light [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]] window. Its timber-framed north wall is also the south wall of the great hall. The [[dormer]] roof between the truss of the great hall and the service wing is done in a thirteenth-century technique. The roof of the service wing itself, however, is post-medieval.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=228}} Today, the service wing houses the [[solitary confinement|meditation room]] and accommodation.<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\nThe great hall was originally timber-framed and integrated with the contemporary service wing. It was cased in stone between 1320 and 1340 to prevent deforming of the base crucks under [[shear stress]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=232}} The hall has two equal [[bay (architecture)|bays]] and the four two-light windows have been replaced in the twentieth century by three-light Perpendicular windows. The stonework of the northern doorway was largely renewed in the nineteenth century. It has wave-moulded [[jamb]]s, [[voussoir]]s and an [[ogee]]-scroll [[hood mould]]. The original southern doorway was less important and similar in style, but with [[chamfer]]ed jambs. The east wall abuts the north range with a straight joint, while the joint of the north range with the west wall is obscured by plaster. The doorway in the east wall has been rebuilt in brick.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=228}} The west wall of the hall is [[battlement|castellated]] and probably early nineteenth century.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The great hall survives open to the roof, with one cruck truss carrying a [[king post]] which is unique in that it was never hidden by a ceiling.<ref name=abbeyhistory>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/history/|title=The Abbey - 800 Years of History|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2020}}</ref> The workmanship of the timber structure is of exceptional quality.

The stair is modern and leads to a door on the first floor of the north range. The outshut roof was probably repaired in the seventeenth century with an inserted [[purlin]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=233}}\n\nThe northern range is roofed in six bays. The western three bays were originally also built in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, while the eastern three bays of the northern range have timber work in the roof that indicates a fifteenth-century date.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=233}}\n\nThe finish of the timbers of the three western bays in the north range is of inferior quality to that of the hall. On the ground floor was a [[parlour]] now used as a dining room, located under the two most western bays. The walls of this parlour vary in size. The west wall contains a three-light Perpendicular window, the north wall contains three two-light ones. The present fireplace is modern but there must have been a chimney since the fifteenth century.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=234}} East of the parlour, the floor level rises and there is a [[cross passage]]. The door at the north end of the passage became blocked and was reopened only in the 1980s. East to the passage, under the third bay from the west, is a lodged floor. Originally, the bay was divided in a room to the north and a narrow room or corridor to the south.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=235}} The first floor was intended as a [[great chamber]], the second most important room in a medieval English manor house. This chamber was entered through a door from the staircase outshut. It is dominated by two fourteenth-century two-light [[transom (architecture)|transom]] windows in the west [[gable]] and in the north wall. The reveals of a third window also remain in the north wall.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The present fireplace has [[musician]] [[corbel]]s from the fifteenth century.{{sfn |Wood |1965 |p=XVIIE (plate)}} It had the same open roof structure as the great hall until probably the seventeenth century, when the space was divided into two rooms, with a corridor on the south side of the eastern room.

It has a small [[lancet window]] in the northern wall at the base of the chimney. The two eastern most bays formed one room and has a modern partition from a corridor to the south. The north and east walls are both from stone, and at the east end of the northern wall is a blocked window. The other two windows are modern. An overhang projected northwards to the room. The present timber south wall replaced a stone wall, remains of which were found during [[plumbing]] operations in 1987-8.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=236}} On the first floor there was a [[solar (room)|solar]] in the second and third bay from the east which was to the south divided from the dining room by a timber-framed partition. On the north side, there are two nineteenth- or twentieth-century Gothic windows flanking a large chimney with a fireplace. There may have been a partition in the middle of the room before the fireplace was built. The solar has a partition to the east behind which was a [[chapel]] and a door from the north to the east range.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=235}}\n\n=== East range ===\n[[File:Arch, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|East entrance looking into the courtyard.]]\nThe east range, which today holds the entrance archway, was constructed around 1500 and contains three bays. The modern gatehouse, at the northern end of the east range, has a lancet window in its east wall. It has a jettied timber frame upper on existing stone walls.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> \n\nSouth of the archway, the wall was timber framed but later partially infilled with brick and rubble as far as the chimney, where it abuts the south range. This timber framed wall is on a different alignment than the gatehouse, probably to unite with the south wall of the southeastern block, which may have been a wall around the building rather than part of a building.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}}\n\nThe roof of the southern bay of the east range was black-smokened and may have served as a kitchen or [[brewhouse]] at some time into which a chimney was later inserted.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}}\n\n=== South range ===\n[[File:Hearth, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The Hearth, a meeting room in the south range.]]\nThe adjoining southeast corner block appears to have been roofed, probably in the seventeenth century, to connect the east range with the south range, completing the plan to create a courtyard.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}} \n\nThe south range, extending the service wing, was added during the mid-sixteenth century. The two storey structure consisting of three bays was open to the eaves and once served as a kitchen.<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\nNowadays, the southeast corner block contains a meeting room called 'The Hearth', seating up to eighteen people.<ref name=abbeystaying /> The south range is now used as The Abbey\u2019s administration office.\n\n== Grounds ==\n[[File:Avenue1, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The lime tree avenue.]]\n[[File:Courtyard2, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The courtyard garden.]]\nIn 1804, Francis Justice, who was in possession of the estate at the time, was allotted over two acres on the green north of the house.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=224}} As a result of this enlargement of the [[curtilage]], The Abbey now stands in the midst of extensive grounds and is approached by an [[avenue (landscape)|avenue]] of [[Tilia|lime trees]] across the enclosure allotment, leading near to the east of the house.

There are also [[Lauraceae|laurels]], winter-flowering ''[[Viburnum]]'', [[Symphoricarpos|snowberry]], a young [[Prunus serrulata|Japanese cherry]] and [[maple]]. A trunk and several branches from an old [[Fagus sylvatica#Cultivation|copper beech]] serve as a place for [[fungus|fungi]] and [[lichen]]s to grow on. Under the trees, there is a purpose built woodstore. On the west lawn, there is a [[Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia|London planetree]]. The south lawn has a [[labyrinth]] in it, where the [[maypole]] is erected. This lawn as young [[Sequoioideae|redwood]] and several varieties of [[apple]] and [[plum]] trees. Furthermore, The Abbey has mature [[live oak]], [[Taxus baccata|yew]], [[Prunus avium|wild cherry]], [[Prunus subg.

In the eleventh century, [[William the Conquerer]] granted the estate of Sutton to the [[House of Courtenay]], and the village became Sutton Courtenay.<ref name=abbeyarchives /> In 1090, King [[William II of England]] granted the [[All Saints' Church, Sutton Courtenay|church of Sutton]] and its lands and [[tithe]]s to the monks of Abingdon Abbey.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}}\n\nAbingdon Abbey constructed The Abbey as a [[monastic grange]], used as an administrative centre for the abbey's land and tithe holdings.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> However, the owner of the hide of land, Alwi the priest (whose father owned the land before him according to the [[Domesday Book]]), agreed with the [[abbot]] that he should retain Sutton with reversion first to his son and thereafter to the abbey, on condition of giving in [[Milton, Vale of White Horse|Milton]] chapelry immediately.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=28}} Almost certainly in the late twelfth century, Abingdon Abbey took two thirds of the tithes and the [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] the remaining third.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=104-5}} In 1258, following a dispute, the land was formally appropriated to the abbey and a [[clergy house|vicarage]] was ordained.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=106}} As it was close to Abingdon Abbey, it was probably run by the monks themselves rather than being left to a steward.<ref name=berkshirehistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/castles/scourtenay_abbey.html|title=The Abbey at Sutton Courtenay|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2004|work=Royal Berkshire History|author=David Nash Ford}}</ref> In 1278, however, [[Hugh de Courtenay]], Lord of the [[Manor House (Sutton Courtenay)|Manor of Sutton]], sued the abbey for [[advowson]].

Many of these men rarely visited Sutton, leaving the running of The Abbey to various underlings. William Steele, rector in 1371, left money to each of his four servants in Sutton. Robert of Walsham, rector from 1372 to 1384 and Dean of [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], may have resided intermittently. His successor John Yernemouth was rector from 1384 to 1397 and did not reside but hired a chaplain to perform his duties. John Yernemouth was the [[chaplain]] of Prince [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England]]. He left the rectory to William Brouns, father of Bishop [[Thomas Brunce|Thomas Brouns]], and two others sometime before 1394. By then, the building had become ruinous and badly roofed. Walter Medford, later [[Archdeacon of Berkshire]], was rector from 1397 to 1413 and may well have used the house. His successor, Nicholas Colnet, also may have resided at the rectory. Colnet was the doctor of King [[Henry V of England]] and was rector until 1420.

After months of torrential rain that hindered work, the house was sold in 1980 to The New Era Centre, a [[foundation (nonprofit)|non-profit charity]] established by Dr [[Fred Blum]] in 1967. During his lifetime, Blum became a member of the [[Quakers]], whilst maintaining his Jewish heritage. In 1963, Blum resigned from his academic posts in the [[United States]] and pursued a future based in the United Kingdom.{{sfn |Mehta |2011 |p=56}} In 1969, he met Bishop [[Stephen Verney]] at a conference in [[Coventry]] where Verney was doing [[reconciliation (theology)|reconciliation]] work. They became friends, \u201clike brothers\u201d, and Verney became a [[trustee]] and significant supporter and contributor to the creation and work of The New Era Centre at The Abbey, which became a [[charitable organization|registered charity]] on 20 December 1979. Verney was a well-connected individual, and frequently communicated with the politician [[Roy Jenkins]].<ref name=abbeyarchives /> The residential community of The New Era Centre in The Abbey was dedicated on 4 October 1981 as a space to explore and work towards the synthesis of [[Christianity]] and more contemporary understandings of societal transformation. In 1984, after The Abbey was improved to a habitable state, the first two resident community members moved in. Stephen Verney extensively discussed, and believed in, the role Buddhist practice and philosophy could play in increasing connectivity with a Christian deity, and it was this belief which led many of The New Era Centre\u2019s early pursuits.<ref name=abbeyarchives /> Blum spent decades researching, interviewing and publishing on [[Mahatma Gandhi]]\u2019s life works and legacy. So too did The Abbey welcome [[India]]n thinkers, such as the social activist and spiritual leader [[Vimala Thakar]] who, in the 1980s, led a seminar here. Among the earliest events taking place at The Abbey was the annual [[Gandhi Foundation]] Summer School that continued to be held there. Much of Blum's work can now be found in The Abbey's library. {{sfn |Mehta |2011 |p=58}}\n\n[[File:The Abbey ruinous state.jpg |thumb|The Abbey in a ruinous state, around 1979.]]\nTwentieth-century landowners had to contend with various states of disrepair, and few have had either the capital or the will to sustain the business. Upon the purchase of The Abbey by The New Era Centre in 1980, a monumental effort was required to source volunteer labour, both locally and from abroad. Sourcing funding was difficult, and some potential investors remained unconvinced that the founders high ideals could lead to anything other than a misuse of funds. However, Blum and Verney remained committed to their project, disputing each critical point. Much of the work was carried out in a co-operative form, such as the 'work camp' of 1981, a community of enthusiastic volunteers. Volunteers from organisations such as [[WWOOF]] UK and [[HelpX]] still play a vital role in keeping The Abbey alive. Blum died in January 1990 and Verney continued the work at The Abbey, but retired in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/volunteering/|title=Volunteering|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|date=2020|access-date=20 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1991, the charity was re-named 'The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay'.
