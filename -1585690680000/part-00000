As a singer, she placed 30 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|country songs]] chart, was a [[Grand Ole Opry]] member and was nominated for several major awards. As a writer, she wrote poems and published an autobiography. Additionally, she was married to American country songwriter [[Harlan Howard]].\n\nHoward was mostly raised in [[West Plains, Missouri]]. The family moved to various homes during her childhood. Marrying in her teens, Howard and her husband relocated various times. This included [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Illinois]] and Missouri. She took several part-time jobs to support her growing family, which now included three children. Howard would divorce her first husband in 1953. She met and married her second husband the same year. Moving to his military base, the couple and her three children lived a suburban lifestyle. In 1955, Howard discovered that he was a [[bigamist]] and she resettled with her children in [[Los Angeles]], California. \n\nIn 1957, she met and married Harlan Howard. Early in their marriage, he discovered that she could sing. Impressed by her voice, Harlan arranged for her to record [[demo (music)|demonstration tapes]]. These tapes were heard by other country artists and led to her first recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Howard had her first major country hit in 1960 with \"[[The One You Slip Around With]]\". As her husband's songwriting became more successful, Howard's recording career followed suit. She had her biggest success after signing with [[Decca Records]]. Howard had major hits with the singles \"[[Evil on Your Mind]]\" (1966) and \"[[My Son (song)|My Son]]\" (1968). She also had several hits after teaming up with [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]], including the number 1 hit \"[[For Loving You]]\" (1967). The pair continued recording and touring together until the mid 1970s.\n\nBy 1973, two of Howard's children had died and she divorced Harlan Howard. In a depressive state, she nearly gave up her career. Upon the encouragement of other performers, she released several more albums and singles into the 1980s. At the same time, she began devoting time to other interests including writing. In 1987, Howard published her best-selling autobiography entitled ''Sunshine and Shadow''. She also started writing poems and short stories and remained active in other ways. This included making regular appearances on the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. She also worked with [[United States Military]] veterans through various programs. She donated to charities and spoke at fundraisers.\n\n==Early life==\n===1929\u20131945: Childhood and teenage years===\nJan Howard was born Lula Grace Johnson in [[West Plains, Missouri]], the daughter of Linnie and Rolla Johnson.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://usobit.com/obituaries-2020/03/jan-howard-march-13-1929-march-28-2020/|title=Jan Howard March 13 1929 March 28 2020|publisher=United States Obituary Notice|accessdate=2020-03-29}}</ref> She was the eighth of 11 children.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} Two of her siblings died before the age of two.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=6}} Howard's father was a [[bricklayer|brick mason]] who received employment assistance from the [[Works Progress Administration]] during the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=4}} In her early childhood, the family moved frequently as her father found work and better housing. They lived in nearby towns such as [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Birch Tree, Missouri|Birch Tree]] and [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]].{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=3-11}} When she was eight years old, the family briefly returned to West Plains. After returning, Howard was [[raped]] by a family friend. In her 1987 autobiography, she commented on the experience: \"My body was violated and my mind was damaged in a way I wasn't to know the full extent of for years to come.\"{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=3-11}} She kept it a secret from her family for many years.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}}\n\nIn her childhood, she developed an interest in listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] radio broadcasts with her father. In 2003, she recalled memories of listening with her father, \"The first time I heard the Opry I was eight or nine years old. My dad used to tune it in on the radio on Saturday nights, but he only listened enough to hear [[Texas Ruby]]. She was his favorite.\"{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} In 1943, Howard's mother temporarily separated from her father. To help support the family, Howard worked as a dishwasher in a local cafe. Because the cafe owner could not afford to pay her, he gave Howard's family food for weekly meals. At age 16, she took a new job at a drugstore called Model Drugs.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=36-38}} \n[[File:West Plains Washington Avenue.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A downtown view of [[West Plains, Missouri]], the hometown of Howard.]] \n\nIn 1945, she married Mearle Wood and subsequently dropped out of high school.{{sfn|Trott, Walt|2012|p=250}} Wood enrolled in the military soon after their marriage began. Finding military housing for his wife, Wood resettled the couple to [[Waynesville, Missouri]]. In their first home together, they shared a house with another military couple. She briefly returned to her parents' house after discovering Wood was engaging in an affair. However, when Wood was re-stationed in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], Howard reunited with him in his new location.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=54}}\n\n===1946\u20131957: Early adulthood===\nHoward gave birth to three sons between the late 1940s and early 1950s.{{sfn|Trott, Walt|2012|p=250}} The young family continued to move as Wood took on various jobs. Among the cities they lived in were [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], [[Pittsburg, Kansas]] and [[Greeley, Colorado]].{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=66-68}} While in Greeley, the family's house caught on fire. According to Howard she woke to the smell of smoke in the middle of the night and saved her three children from the fumes. Wood was not present at the time of the incident.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=80}} Towards the end of their marriage, the family moved back to West Plains. Howard later revealed in 1987 that Wood was physically abusive, especially at the end of their marriage. During one incident, Wood held a butcher knife to Howard's throat, nearly killing her. The same day, Howard and her three sons fled to live with her siblings in Oklahoma.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} \"Until midnight, Mom and Daddy kept us hidden. Then, with as much money as we could spare, we boarded a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] for Oklahoma City,\" Howard wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=101}} In 1953, she divorced Wood.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}}\n\nWhile living with her brother, Howard became acquainted with his friend, Lowell \"Smitty\" Smith. Smith was also an active member of the [[United States Military|military]]. Developing a romantic affection, the two married in 1953.<ref name=\"Popular Music\">{{cite book |last1=Larkin |first1=Colin |title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music |date=1992}}</ref>{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} Living with Smith and her three sons on a military base, the family lived a suburban lifestyle. Howard also got a part-time job in the \"tea room\" of the Morehouse Fashion Department Store. In 1954, she gave birth to a fourth child named Janet Louise Smith. The child had a series of medical problems and died shortly after being born.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=114-116}} In her autobiography, Howard recalled the experience: \"They were closing the top of the incubator. The realization hit me. The baby was dead,\" Howard wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=115}}\n\nThe Smith family then moved to a base in [[Warrensburg, Missouri]], where they rented a newly-built home. The couple bought furniture on credit to decorate the home.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=121}} During this time, she became pregnant again and eventually [[miscarriage|miscarried]] the child.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} Shortly after the miscarriage, Smith was re-stationed in [[Panama]]. Howard arranged for their furniture to be sent to Panama while Smith moved there. Howard and her children were to meet him there within a few months after.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=127-28}} Shortly after Smith left, she discovered that he was still married to another woman. Upon realizing this, she ended the relationship and moved with her sons to [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1955.<ref name=\"Popular Music\"/>\n\nHoward worked a series of part-time jobs upon moving to Los Angeles. For a short time, she worked as a cocktail waitress in a strip club. \"I must have had thirty jobs in the next thirty days,\" Howard wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=137}} After several months, she got a job as a secretary. She later recalled that the position was challenging because she could not \"type or take [[shorthand]]\". In 1957, she met aspiring country music songwriter [[Harlan Howard]]. The pair met through her friend's association with country artist [[Wynn Stewart]] (Stewart was also a friend of Harlan Howard's).{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} Within a month of meeting, the couple were married on May 10, 1957 in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].{{sfn|Trott, Walt|2012|p=250}}\n\n==Singing career==\n===1958\u20131963: Early success===\nAt home, Jan would often sing to herself while her husband was out working. Coming home early one day, Harlan heard her singing while she was washing dishes. \"I didn't know you could sing,\" Harlan said.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|pp=227-28}} The same day, he accompanied Jan on guitar while she sang his composition \"Mommy for a Day\". Harlan realized he could use Jan's singing voice for [[demo (music)|demo]] records. The Howards recorded the song's demo in their bathroom in [[Gardena, California]]. The song was sent to a publisher in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] where it was recorded and made a hit by [[Kitty Wells]].{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=164-65}} Howard also sang the demos for \"Pick Me Up on Your Way Down\" and \"I Wish I Could Fall in Love Again\". Both songs were recorded by [[Charlie Walker (musician)|Charlie Walker]]. Harlan brought Jan's demo tapes to Joe Johnson of [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Johnson liked the songs however, Harlan would not let Johnson take them unless he signed Jan to the label. Johnson agreed and she officially signed with Challenge in 1958.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=166-67}}{{sfn|Trott, Walt|2012|p=250}} After signing, the label changed her name from \"Lula Grace Howard\" to \"Jan Howard\".{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=228}}\n[[File:Jan Howard--Most Promising Female Vocalist.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Early publicity photo of Howard in an ad from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', 1960.]]\n\nJan and Stewart's first recording, \"Yankee Go Home\", was released on Challenge Records in 1959.<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\">{{cite web |last1=Brennan |first1=Sandra |title=Jan Howard: Biography & History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/jan-howard-mn0000214907 |website=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref> The duo also released a second single together entitled \"Wrong Company\".

From interacting with other country artists at clubs, Jan was presented with performance opportunities of her own. Among her first engagements was singing on the regional television show ''[[Town Hall Party]]''. However, Jan had fears about performing. In her autobiography, Howard recalled the experience at the show. \"The band started 'Pick Me Up on Your Way Down' and someone pushed me onstage. After that, everything was a total blank...If I'd been given warning, I'd have been long gone.\"{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=174-75}}\n\nThe success of \"Wrong Company\" prompted Joe Johnson to find Jan a solo release. Johnson chose the song \"[[The One You Slip Around With]]\", which was co-written by Harlan Howard and Fuzzy Owen. On the record, Jan also sang the third-part harmony.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=175}} Released in late 1959, the song became a major hit by February 1960, reaching number 13 on the ''Billboard'' country sides chart.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"The One You Slip Around With\" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/jan-howard/chart-history/CSI/song/837400 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref> She recalled hearing the song on the radio for the first time: \"For once, I was proud of what I heard but it was as though I was listening to someone else, not me.\"{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=175}} The song's success helped Howard receive the \"Most Promising Country Female\" award from ''Billboard'' and ''Jukebox Operators''.{{sfn|Trott, Walt|2012|p=250}} Also in 1960, the Howard family moved to Nashville where Jan regularly appeared on the \"Prince Albert\" segment of the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/> Howard met several country artists while playing there regularly, notably [[Patsy Cline]].{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=131}}\n\nThe Howards bought a four-bedroom home located in [[Madison, Tennessee|Madison]], a suburb of the city. Harlan converted the home's garage into a den where he could use it as songwriting space.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=189}} Still on Challenge Records, Jan continued to record demo material for her husband. Among the demos she performed on was \"[[I Fall to Pieces]]\", which Harlan composed with [[Hank Cochran]].{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=132-40}} Jan liked the song so much that she wanted to record it for her own label. However, Harlan offered the track to Patsy Cline first. Cline's version became a hit.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=189-90}} When not recording demos or at her new home, Jan toured package shows with other country artists. Among the first tours she embarked on was in [[Florida]] alongside [[June Carter]], [[Skeeter Davis]], [[George Jones]], [[Buck Owens]] and [[Faron Young]].{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=189-99}}\n\nIn 1962, [[Capitol Records]] bought Jan's recording contract from Challenge.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=207}} According to Jan, her first Capitol sessions with an unnamed producer were \"a disaster\". Frustrated with the sessions, she called [[Ken Nelson (American record producer)|Ken Nelson]] and asked him to record her instead. Nelson agreed and sent her to Los Angeles for their next session. At Capitol, it was suggested that she would be marketed as towards [[pop music|pop]] rather than country. This prompted Nelson to have her record a mix of pop standards and country covers.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=207}} From the sessions, Howard's debut studio album was released in 1962, ''[[Sweet and Sentimental]]''. The album featured covers of various songs, including her husband's \"[[He Called Me Baby]]\" and \"[[Heartaches by the Number]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Jan Howard with the Jordanaires - ''Sweet and Sentimental'' (1962, Vinyl) |url=https://www.discogs.com/Jan-Howard-With-The-Jordanaires-Sweet-And-Sentimental/release/7981669 |website=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref> Although at Capitol for several years, Howard only had one charting single with the label: a cover of \"I Wish I Was a Single Girl Again\".

Finding herself touring frequently, she hired a housekeeper to take care of domestic needs.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=233}} Harlan also found a booking agent for her shows. He arranged for Hubert Long (owner of the \"Hubert Long Talent Agency\") to work with his wife.

In a 2015 interview, Howard explained that she still wrote a \"little bit of everything\" including songs, poems and short stories. She also stated that she had started three fiction novels that had yet to be completed. \"I need to put those together, I need to go through them. And I found things in there that I forgot I wrote and I said 'oh, this is pretty good' or 'this is bad'.

As a realtor, she sold several homes including one to local Nashville musician Jimmy Capps.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=229}} Howard remained a real estate agent for only a short period of time.

From Howard's efforts, she received the \"Gold Medal of Merit Award\" from the Veterans of Foreign Wars. \"I never want to be in the forefront of anything like this, but it\u2019s worth it to bring attention to those who gave so much.

He would frequently come by to say hello and have a soda. The two spent more time together, eventually becoming a couple and marrying.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=41-43}} Howard later said that she did not want to marry Wood, however, her mother encouraged their courtship. \"I felt like I was dressing for a funeral. And in a way, I was. The funeral of my girlhood,\" she wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=41-43}} Her second marriage to Lowell \"Smitty\" Smith lasted only two years after discovering that he was a [[bigamist]].{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=228}} \n\nIn her third marriage to Harlan Howard, Jan's three children legally were adopted by him and took on his last name.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=215}} In the mid-1960s, the couple owned a publishing company in Nashville called \"Wilderness Music\". Together, they bought an older home, renovated it and turned it into a series of offices for the company.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=230}} Jan later commented that Harlan took control of the Wilderness when they divorced. According to Harlan, the company and its music were his \"brainchildren\". Upset about the situation, Jan said to her divorce lawyers, \"I don't want anything. Just the divorce.\"{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=291}} Following her divorce, she became closer to her divorce lawyer, Jack Norman. A licensed pilot, Norman took her on plane rides and also spent many nights at her home. The two became romantically involved while Norman was still married.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=305-09}} Their affair carried on into the mid 1970s.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=485}} In 1990, she remarried for a fourth time to Dr. Maurice Acree, Jr.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=228}} Only married for a short period of time, Acree died in 2013, according to an obituary from ''[[The Tennessean]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Maurice Acree OBITUARY |url=https://obits.tennessean.com/obituaries/tennessean/obituary.aspx?n=maurice-m-acree&pid=164078081 |website=[[The Tennesseean]] |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Children===\nFrom her first marriage, Howard gave birth to three sons: Jimmy, Carter (Corky) and David.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|pp=227-29}} As a young child, Jimmy was hospitalized in critical condition with [[spinal meningitis]]. Within four weeks, he recovered from the illness.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=171-72}} During the Vietnam War in 1968, Jimmy was drafted into the military. Once he received his draft notice, Carter volunteered for the army. \"If Jimmy's going, I'm going,\" he said to Howard.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=321}} After being sent to basic training, the military was supposed to let Jimmy come home, but they refused. Upset about the situation, Howard discussed the situation with her friend and country DJ, [[Ralph Emery]]. Through the assistance of Emery, Howard got in contact with [[Richard Fulton|Congressman Richard Fulton]]. Emery found Fulton at a restaurant at nine o'clock the same night when he contacted him. It was Fulton who got permission from the military to send Jimmy home for 21 days. In her autobiography, Howard recounted the phone call she received from Jimmy the day he came home, \"Mom! What did you do? The Secretary of the Army himself called down here! My sergeant came and got me and said, 'Howard! Go call your mother, then be prepared to work you ass off!'\"{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=321}} Howard also recalled Jimmy's nervousness as he prepared for Vietnam. The evening before his departure, he sat at her bedside explaining his nervousness and anxieties. The next evening, he flew out at three o'clock in the morning.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=339}} \n{{quote box\n |quote  = The world was black. I prayed for death.

Realizing the reasons for them being there, she began screaming and crying. Howard remembered the days following Jimmy's death in her autobiography. She recalled going through the days and weeks by \"forcing\" herself to keep going. She had trouble eating and sleeping, taking pills on a regular basis to help her through the anxieties and grief. \"I was crying when I woke up, and crying when I went to sleep,\" she wrote in 1987. One morning, Howard made the decision to dispose of all her medicine and continue on with her life. \"As I walked into the den and saw the relief on Corky and David's faces, my efforts were worthwhile,\" she wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=360-61}}\n\nHoward's youngest son, David, began abusing [[substance abuse|drugs]] in the years following Jimmy's death.<ref name=\"Gazette 2\">{{cite news |last1=Edwardsd |first1=Joe |title=Personal Setbacks Make Her Stronger |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&dat=19810404&id=AWRGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zegMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2414,1548685&hl=en |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |publisher=[[Schenectady Gazette]] |date=1981}}</ref> Prior to this, he had been employed at the ''[[Opryland USA]]'' theme park, where he appeared as an actor in several shows. This included a major role in the cast of the play ''[[I Hear America Singing]]''.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=412-13}} Howard then began noticing changes in his behavior, including coming home late at night and having symptoms of [[depression (mood)|depression]]. When she would ask David he would reply by saying that he was \"just tired.\" She also noticed that he began associating with people who provided David with substances.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=432}} She eventually had him see a [[psychiatrist]] for his personal setbacks, but only found out that he was using the time for other reasons.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=435}} One morning in 1972, Howard found David in his bedroom dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She recalled that the next several days were a \"blur\". Devastated by her son's suicide, she stayed in bed for days at a time. After many weeks of grieving, Howard cleaned out his room and sold his [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. \"When everything was done, I took one last look around, walked out, and closed the door on the past. But it would never be locked,\" she wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=461-67}}\n\nIn the years following David's and Jimmy's deaths, Howard's middle son Carter began working with military veterans. He also owned his own business and became a real estate broker in Nashville.<ref name=\"Gazette 2\"/>\n\n===Other personal challenges===\nThe psychological trauma of Howard's childhood affected her as she entered her adult years.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=228}} After giving birth to her third child, she would cry uncontrollably. \"There were many times my heart would pound so hard I thought it would pop out of my chest,\" Howard commented. Howard's sister took her to see a doctor who explained that she was having a \"[[nervous breakdown]]\". To calm her anxieties, he prescribed Howard a strong pharmaceutical drug that she was told take four times per day.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=86}} In the early 1960s, she was rushed to the hospital after experiencing intense bleeding. Doctors told her that after giving birth to a stillborn baby and a previous operation, Howard had a strong possibility of developing [[cancer]] if she did not have her [[uterus]] removed. Howard got surgery completed at the [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center|UCLA Medical Center]] in Los Angeles and within three weeks she was back to a normal routine.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=163}}\n\nHer trauma followed her into her marriage with Harlan Howard. While married, her weight dropped below 97 pounds and she would pace their home at night. This prompted Harlan to institutionalize Jan.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=228}} In her autobiography, she recounted being brought into a hospital room with doctors and nurses. She recalled that she was screaming and shouting until a nurse gave her a shot which put her \"six feet under\". A doctor diagnosed her with having [[paroxysmal tachycardia]] and sent her home. He also ordered her to seek [[therapy|counseling]] services from a psychiatrist. According to her psychiatrist, she developed a series of phobias from the traumatic experiences in her childhood.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=186-87}} After moving to Nashville, she continued having depressive episodes. One evening in 1962, she took a handful of sleeping pills and was rushed to the hospital. While at the hospital, her blood pressure dropped significantly low and was in critical condition. When she awoke, she recalled seeing [[Maybelle Carter|Mother Maybelle Carter]] feeding her. \"Little by little I felt stronger and knew, thank God, that I was going to live,\" she wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=227}}\n\nYears later, Howard reflected on her life experiences: \"One thing I want to make clear is that I'm not a martyr. I can't stand self-pity. I don't deserve and don't want any kind of pity...There are a lot of people who have gone through worse things than I have.\"{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=229}}\n\nHoward died on March 28, 2020, fifteen days after her 91st birthday, in [[Gallatin, Tennessee]]. \"We were all so lucky so many nights to hear her voice on stage and to catch up with her backstage.

'''Lula Grace Johnson'''; March 13, 1929 \u2013 March 28, 2020) was an American [[country music]] singer, songwriter, and author. As a singer, she placed 30 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|country songs]] chart, was a [[Grand Ole Opry]] member and was nominated for several major awards. As a writer, she wrote poems and published an autobiography. Additionally, she was married to American country songwriter [[Harlan Howard]].\n\nHoward was mostly raised in [[West Plains, Missouri]]. The family moved to various homes during her childhood. Marrying in her teens, Howard and her husband relocated various times. This included [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Illinois]] and Missouri. She took several part-time jobs to support her growing family, which now included three children. Howard would divorce her first husband in 1953. She met and married her second husband the same year. Moving to his military base, the couple and her three children lived a suburban lifestyle. In 1955, Howard discovered that he was a [[bigamist]] and she resettled with her children in [[Los Angeles]], California. \n\nIn 1957, she met and married Harlan Howard. Early in their marriage, he discovered that she could sing. Impressed by her voice, Harlan arranged for her to record [[demo (music)|demonstration tapes]]. These tapes were heard by other country artists and led to her first recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Howard had her first major country hit in 1960 with \"[[The One You Slip Around With]]\". As her husband's songwriting became more successful, Howard's recording career followed suit. She had her biggest success after signing with [[Decca Records]]. Howard had major hits with the singles \"[[Evil on Your Mind]]\" (1966) and \"[[My Son (song)|My Son]]\" (1968). She also had several hits after teaming up with [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]], including the number 1 hit \"[[For Loving You]]\" (1967). The pair continued recording and touring together until the mid 1970s.\n\nBy 1973, two of Howard's children had died and she divorced Harlan Howard. In a depressive state, she nearly gave up her career. Upon the encouragement of other performers, she released several more albums and singles into the 1980s. At the same time, she began devoting time to other interests including writing. In 1987, Howard published her best-selling autobiography entitled ''Sunshine and Shadow''.

From interacting with other country artists at clubs, Jan was presented with performance opportunities of her own. Among her first engagements was singing on the regional television show ''[[Town Hall Party]]''. However, Jan had fears about performing. In her autobiography, Howard recalled the experience at the show. \"The band started 'Pick Me Up on Your Way Down' and someone pushed me onstage.

At Capitol, it was suggested that she would be marketed as towards [[pop music|pop]] rather than country. This prompted Nelson to have her record a mix of pop standards and country covers.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=207}} From the sessions, Howard's debut studio album was released in 1962, ''[[Sweet and Sentimental]]''.

Howard got surgery completed at the [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center|UCLA Medical Center]] in Los Angeles and within three weeks she was back to a normal routine.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=163}}\n\nHer trauma followed her into her marriage with Harlan Howard. While married, her weight dropped below 97 pounds and she would pace their home at night. This prompted Harlan to institutionalize Jan.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=228}} In her autobiography, she recounted being brought into a hospital room with doctors and nurses. She recalled that she was screaming and shouting until a nurse gave her a shot which put her \"six feet under\". A doctor diagnosed her with having [[paroxysmal tachycardia]] and sent her home. He also ordered her to seek [[therapy|counseling]] services from a psychiatrist. According to her psychiatrist, she developed a series of phobias from the traumatic experiences in her childhood.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=186-87}} After moving to Nashville, she continued having depressive episodes. One evening in 1962, she took a handful of sleeping pills and was rushed to the hospital. While at the hospital, her blood pressure dropped significantly low and was in critical condition. When she awoke, she recalled seeing [[Maybelle Carter|Mother Maybelle Carter]] feeding her. \"Little by little I felt stronger and knew, thank God, that I was going to live,\" she wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=227}}\n\nYears later, Howard reflected on her life experiences: \"One thing I want to make clear is that I'm not a martyr. I can't stand self-pity. I don't deserve and don't want any kind of pity...There are a lot of people who have gone through worse things than I have.\"{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=229}}\n\nHoward died on March 28, 2020, fifteen days after her 91st birthday, in [[Gallatin, Tennessee]]. \"We were all so lucky so many nights to hear her voice on stage and to catch up with her backstage. We\u2019re all better for having had her in our lives,\" said Dan Rogers, Vice President of the Grand Ole Opry.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Paulson |first1=Dave |title=Jan Howard, Opry member and country

{"title_page": "Personal Load Carrying Equipment", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n'''Personal Load Carrying Equipment''' ('''PLCE''') is one of several current tactical [[webbing#Military|webbing]] systems of the [[British Armed Forces]]. Dependent upon the year of design, and the [[decade]] of introduction, the webbing system was designated, and is commonly referred to, as either the ''85 Pattern'', the ''90 Pattern'' or the ''95 Pattern'' webbing.\n\nThe basic configuration consists of a belt, a shoulder harness and a number of individual pouches. Associated with the PLCE webbing system is a series of other similar load carrying equipment, individual items and rucksacks that are produced of the same materials and feature high interoperability.\n\n==Purpose==\nThe purpose of the '''''PLCE''''' webbing system is to retain the means by which a British soldier may  operate for 48 hours or conduct a mission-specific task. Items and components may include a variety of munitions and weapon ancillaries, a three-fold [[entrenching tool]], a [[bayonet]], food and water (including a means to heat water and prepare food), [[CBRN|Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear ''(CBRN)'']] protective clothing and communications equipment. Soldiers will also often carry other personal items such as waterproof clothing and spare socks.\n\n==History==\nThe '''''PLCE''''' webbing system had replaced the Type [[58 Pattern webbing|58 Pattern]] webbing, which was [[Olive (color)#Olive drab|Olive drab]] (OD/OG)  in colour and made of [[canvas]] material. This system, after having been introduced to the forces in 1960, and considered long outdated by 1980, was still being part of the standard issue equipment of the [[British Armed Forces]] during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.\n\nTo overcome the common issues associated with canvas materials, such as shrinking and accelerated decomposition in damp climate conditions, arctic climate conditions, or constant exposure to wet terrain, military load bearing systems, outside of the range of use by the British Armed Forces, had been revised to incorporate or be produced of newer and tougher materials.\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], the [[United States Armed Forces]] had introduced and serviced the M-1967 [[Modernized Load-Carrying Equipment]] (MLCE) in 1968, and later the [[All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment]] (ALICE) in 1974. Both systems had incorporated non-decomposing synthetic fabrics and were produced of highly durable [[nylon]] material.\n\nFollowing this influential lead, and reconsidering the progression and renewal of military load bearing systems around the world, Britain developed the Type [[72 pattern webbing|72 Pattern webbing]], which mainly consisted of two ammunition pouches, to be worn on the front, and a field pack, to be worn on the back, produced of [[Polyurethane]]-coated nylon and [[Butyl rubber]]. This system was never generally issued, but was a Troop Trials Equipment.\n\nThe [[National People's Army]] (''Nationale Volksarmee'') of the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] designed and introduced the [[UTV webbing|''Uniformtrageversuch'' 85-90]] (UTV 85-90), resembling, with the exception of the clothing system, a modified duplicate of the British Type [[58 Pattern webbing]], inheriting very similar features in appearance and function. The shoulder harness was of identical design, the belt had featured the use of identical buckles, and Type 58 Pattern C-hooks had been incorporated in all components. Complementary items, such as pouches, had been changed in design and size, to meet [[Warsaw Pact]] requirements. The webbing system and components were produced of a more robust [[Nylon]] material, and featured the [[Strichtarn]] camouflage pattern. Whilst this late improvement was observed by the British Armed Forces, and being found to be an affront, especially against the [[British Army of the Rhine]] (BAOR), no further considerations have been made, as the testing of prototypic PLCE equipment was already underway.\n\n==85 Pattern==\nDevelopments resumed with the progression of the firearms development and introduction of the [[SA80]] family of British small arms. Trials of experimental '''''PLCE''''' webbing and [[Combat Body Armour]] (CBA) were conducted with selected units in 1984 and 1985. Being very similar to the first standard issue PLCE webbing system, it used snaps of proprietary design for closure on all pouches{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.\n\n==90 Pattern==\nSeven years after the [[Falklands War|Falklands Conflict]], the first standard issue PLCE webbing was introduced in 1989, it was designated the Type ''90 Pattern'' webbing and was [[Olive (color)#Olive drab|Olive (OD/OG)]]  in colour.\n\nThe original components used Type [[58 Pattern webbing|58 Pattern]] C-hooks for the belt attachment, and angled D-rings for the shoulder harness attachment on the ammunition pouches. There were separate left and right pouches. The first utility pouches in production, had additional belt attachments for high mounting, similar to the ammunition pouches of the [[1937 Pattern Web Equipment]] or Type [[44 Pattern]] webbing. Later produced PLCE webbing of the Type 90 Pattern incorporates ambidextrous yoke fittings and the standard PLCE webbing belt attachments (see below).\n\nThe PLCE webbing system was also adopted by the [[Danish Defence|Danish Defence Forces]] (''Forsvaret'') in the [[M84 camouflage pattern|M84]] camouflage pattern and by the [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Defence Forces of Ireland]] (''\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann'') in Olive drab. The Permanent and Reserve Defence Forces now employ the [[Integrated Protection and Load Carrying System]] (IPLCS).\n\nMany other countries still issue, or have issued similar load bearing systems. By way of example, in its year of introduction to the forces, the [[United States Armed Forces]] have adopted the [[Individual Integrated Fighting System]] (IIFS).\n\nThe newest variant of the PLCE webbing system, of the Type 90 Pattern, has been in production since 1992 and features the [[Disruptive Pattern Material]] (DPM) camouflage pattern as being an integral feature of the now partially obsolete [[Combat Soldier 95]] (\"Soldier 95\") clothing system. The official designation remained unchanged.\n\n==95 Pattern==\nWith the introduction of the [[Combat Soldier 95]] (CS95 or \"Soldier 95\") clothing system in 1995, the common misconception arose that a complete revision of the Type 90 Pattern PLCE webbing system was taking place.\n\nThe clothing system underwent final development and entered troop trials in between the years 1992 and 1995. Garments were specifically manufactured for these trials, yet the PLCE webbing system issued, officially remained of the Type 90 Pattern.\n\nDue to confusion, or for the sake of convenience, individual components of the webbing system, were now, as of 1995, unofficially designated, described, and specified as the '''Type 95 Pattern''' webbing, as having been widely understood to be part of the Combat Soldier 95 clothing system. No such official change of designation had taken place.\n\nThe only array of PLCE components that could be considered of the unofficial Type 95 Pattern, are those components produced during or after the year of 1995.\n\n==Construction==\nThe PLCE webbing system is produced from double-layered 1000 [[Denier (unit)|Denier]] internally rubberised [[Cordura]] [[Nylon]], a long lasting and hard wearing fabric. [[Olive (color)#Olive drab|Olive]] webbing of the same material (\"1000 D\") is being incorporated, along with a variety of hard wearing plastic fasteners [[Illinois Tool Works#ITW companies|(ITW Nexus)]], [[Hook and loop fastener]]s ([[Velcro]]) and anti-magnetic press stud fasteners (\"Pull the Dot\").\n\nThe pouches are opened and closed with Spanish Tab fasteners, they can be closed in two different ways, quick release or secure. Small sections of [[Velcro]], sewn on the inside of the lids of the pouches, and the top front section of the pouches, allow for easy and effortless fastening. Added silencer strips allow to cover them when not needed.\n\nA standard ammunition pouch as issued (\"Pouch, Ammunition, Universal, DPM, IRR.\") has two pockets; single pocket versions (\"Pouch, Ammunition (Other Arms), DPM, IRR.\") are available for those individuals not required to carry as much ammunition. Pouches designated to hold ammunition initially contained a dividing strip to hold two magazines in separate compartments and eliminate rattle. Some soldiers, especially infantry soldiers, often removed these dividing strips to make it easier to insert and remove magazines. They also found that three magazines would then fit comfortably and without excessive noise, giving a total capacity of twelve magazines per person in a standard fighting configuration. Later issue ammunition pouches were manufactured without dividers, as eight magazines was not thought to be sufficient for sustained firefights with the enemy. Without dividers, each pouch can now alternatively contain one grenade.\n\nInfrared Reflective (IRR) coating and dyes are incorporated in all fabric and webbing of the PLCE webbing system, which replicates the near-infrared reflectance of natural foliage.\nFor example, green foliage is highly reflective to near-infrared light and thus appears white when viewed through IR optics (or bright green through night vision). The IRR camouflage pattern therefore works correctly when viewed through infrared [[night vision]] optics just as it does in visible light. Non IRR fabric would appear as a solid colour dependant on it's reflectance and the camouflage pattern would be lost.\n\n==Order of Dress==\nThe [[Infantry Trials and Development Unit]] (ITDU) based in [[Warminster#Military|Warminster]], conducted trials with the PLCE webbing system. It had decided for the system to be fit for purpose, and divided the system into three orders of dress:\n\n* Assault Order.\nThe Assault Order consists of the very essentials needed to conduct a military task in the theatre of war. Ammunition, the water bottle, the entrenching tool, the bayonet, the helmet, and [[CBRN]] (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear) protective clothing (stowed in one of the detachable side pouches of the rucksack) is to be carried on operations and patrols of only short duration.\n* Combat Order.\nThe Combat Order is the Assault Order in addition to the means of stowage for rations and personal equipment, that enable the British soldier to live and fight for a period of 24 hours. The second side pouch of the rucksack is now carried. In practice, the patrol packs are used by many units and individual soldiers instead of the side pouches, as they are to be found larger in size and more convenient.\n* Marching Order.\nThe Marching Order is the Combat Order in addition to the carrying of the rucksack (Bergen) and is the fighting load required for operations of up to the duration of two weeks, without means of resupply, except for ammunition, rations and water. The complete Bergen (with side pouches attached) is being carried.\n\n==Configuration==\nThe initial basis of the '''''PLCE''''' webbing system is the belt; it features two D-rings at the back to attach to the shoulder harness, and many rows of narrow vertical slots sewn into the fabric. Two or more front pouches (ammunition or utility) attach to the belt; these have belt loops and feature T-Bar plastic tab attachments to provide more stability and security when connected to the belt. Every major component of the '''''PLCE''''' webbing system features two T-Bar plastic tab attachments.\n\nThe six-point shoulder harness attaches to the two D-rings on the belt and the two A-rings on each front pouch chosen. This benefits the distribution of weight and allows for a more comfortable carry, than provided with the use of a four-point shoulder harness. Pouches that are to be worn on the back (field pack, utility, water bottle, respirator, wire cutter, entrenching tool) attach to the belt using the same loop and tab system.\n\nThe detachable side pouches of a Bergen (''Pouch, Side, Rucksack, DPM, IRR.'') can be attached to the dedicated shoulder harness (''Yoke, Pouch Side, Rucksack, DPM, IRR.'') to construct a day-sack.\n\n==Scaling==\nIn the year 1997, the [[Defence Clothing & Textile Agency|Defence Clothing & Textile Agency (''DCTA'')]] had decided, that Type ''90 Pattern (Infantry)'' equipment was to be scaled and issued in the following capacity.\n \n*01. ''1x Carrier, Entrenching Tool.''\n*02. ''2x Pouch Side, Rucksack.''\n*03. ''1x Carrier, Water Canteen.''\n*04. ''2x Pouch, Ammunition, Universal.''\n*05. ''1x Pouch, Utility.''\n*06. ''1x Haversack, Respirator.''\n*07. ''1x Yoke, Main.''\n*08. ''1x Yoke, Pouch Side, Rucksack.''\n*09. ''2x Strap, Pouch Side, Yoke.''\n*10. ''1x Belt, Waist (of appropriate size).''\n*11. ''2x Strap, Utility, O/D, IRR.''\n*12. ''1x Bayonet, Frog, DPM, IRR.''\n*13. ''1x Rucksack (Infantry) (of appropriate size).''\n*14. ''1x Bag, Insertion, Rucksack.''\n*15. ''2x Bag, Insertion, Pouch, Side, Rucksack.''\n*16. ''1x Bag, Transparent, PLCE, Rucksack.''\n*17. ''2x Bag, Transparent, PLCE, Pouch, Side, Rucksack.''\n\nThe standard issue accoutrement today, dependent upon the branch of service, was changed to the capacity of two front pouches (''Pouch, Ammunition, Universal, DPM, IRR.'') instead of one. To this, privately purchased water bottle or utility pouches and hip pads are often added. The entrenching tool pouch (''Carrier, Entrenching Tool Case, DPM, IRR.'') is sometimes used as an alternative water bottle pouch.\n\nMulti Terrain Pattern (MTP) PLCE is replacing all Disruptive Pattern Material (DPM) PLCE as the core issued webbing equipment for the British Armed Forces, this program started in 2015.\n\n==Components==\nThe following example of individual components, are all current issue items of the [[British Armed Forces]], however many Commercial variants are available.\n* Webbing:\n** Yoke, Main, DPM, IRR.

Two triple ammunition pouches are situated on the left hand side of the coat, along with a utility pouch, small utility pouch and a zippered pocket with an internal holster. The right side is similar but with three large utility pouches, along with a small utility pouch and again a zippered pocket with notepad holder. All pouches open and close with [[Illinois Tool Works#ITW companies|ITW Nexus]] clips as well as having storm seals.\n\nThe vest is adjusted through four ladderlock fasteners and webbing, the shoulders are adjustable with [[Velcro]] material. The concept is to gain a secure load carrying system that fits over body armour comfortably. There are various types of this vest depending upon the year of manufacture. The originals are as described above but newer models have loops on the left side for the bayonet frog, clips for a large hydration pouch, name patches on the left side, and a small utility pouch. Most recently, the Spanish tab fasteners are being incorporated again, instead of the [[Illinois Tool Works#ITW companies|ITW Nexus]] clips.\n\nThe standard issue assault vest, depending on the operational requirements, is available in either the [[Disruptive Pattern Material#Later developments|Disruptive Pattern Material (''DPM'')]] camouflage pattern, or the [[Desert DPM (''DDPM'')]] camouflage pattern. Commercial variants are available in multiple colours, such as Black, Green, or the American [[Desert Camouflage Uniform|Desert Camouflage Uniform (''DCU'')]] camouflage pattern.\n\n==Criticism==\nThe main criticism of the '''''PLCE''''' webbing system amongst members of the [[British Armed Forces]], is that the belt is prone to slipping. Some soldiers opt to change the plastic buckle for a [[Roll-Pin]] type, whereby the belt is threaded and tightened each time it is put on.\n\n==Future==\nIn 2015, ''VIRTUS'' the  Personal Protective Equipment and Load Carriage System, began being issued to high readiness units.\n\nDue to the introduction and constant improvement of protective equipment, such as the [[Osprey body armour|Osprey Body Armour (''OBA'')]], the PLCE webbing system is incompatible so Osprey Mk 4 has a MOLLE belt and under armour Yoke to allow Osprey pouches to be used as belt equipment.\n\nAfter the first introduction in 1989, PLCE in its current MTP form is still Britain's core issue webbing equipment which is compatible with ECBA armour and Mk 6 and 7 helmet, with Osprey issued to non-deployed infantry, leaving Virtus issued to deployed Infantry Commando and Parachute Units.\n\nMost other nations are developing, or have developed more modular load bearing systems, such as the [[MOLLE (military)|Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment (''MOLLE'')]] which is being widely employed by most branches of the [[United States Armed Forces]]. Following this major improvement, the [[Pouch Attachment Ladder System|Pouch Attachment Ladder System (''PALS'')]] had been incorporated into the [[Osprey body armour|Osprey Body Armour (''OBA'')]] platform, which is currently being issued to British troops on operations world-wide.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/PLCE PLCE on the 'Army Rumour Service' Encyclopedia]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bataleur 90]], South African equivalent\n*[[Niemoller battle jacket]], South African battle vest\n*[[List of webbing equipment]]\n\n[[Category:British Army equipment]]\n[[Category:Personal military carrying equipment]]\n[[Category:Luggage]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n'''Personal Load Carrying Equipment''' ('''PLCE''') is one of several current tactical [[webbing#Military|webbing]] systems of the [[British Armed Forces]]. Dependent upon the year of design, and the [[decade]] of introduction, the webbing system was designated, and is commonly referred to, as either the ''85 Pattern'', the ''90 Pattern'' or the ''95 Pattern'' webbing.\n\nThe basic configuration consists of a belt, a shoulder harness and a number of individual pouches. Associated with the PLCE webbing system is a series of other similar load carrying equipment, individual items and rucksacks that are produced of the same materials and feature high interoperability.\n\n==Purpose==\nThe purpose of the '''''PLCE''''' webbing system is to retain the means by which a British soldier may  operate for 48 hours or conduct a mission-specific task. Items and components may include a variety of munitions and weapon ancillaries, a three-fold [[entrenching tool]], a [[bayonet]], food and water (including a means to heat water and prepare food), [[CBRN|Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear ''(CBRN)'']] protective clothing and communications equipment. Soldiers will also often carry other personal items such as waterproof clothing and spare socks.\n\n==History==\nThe '''''PLCE''''' webbing system had replaced the Type [[58 Pattern webbing|58 Pattern]] webbing, which was [[Olive (color)#Olive drab|Olive drab]] (OD/OG)  in colour and made of [[canvas]] material. This system, after having been introduced to the forces in 1960, and considered long outdated by 1980, was still being part of the standard issue equipment of the [[British Armed Forces]] during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.\n\nTo overcome the common issues associated with canvas materials, such as shrinking and accelerated decomposition in damp climate conditions, arctic climate conditions, or constant exposure to wet terrain, military load bearing systems, outside of the range of use by the British Armed Forces, had been revised to incorporate or be produced of newer and tougher materials.\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], the [[United States Armed Forces]] had introduced and serviced the M-1967 [[Modernized Load-Carrying Equipment]] (MLCE) in 1968, and later the [[All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment]] (ALICE) in 1974. Both systems had incorporated non-decomposing synthetic fabrics and were produced of highly durable [[nylon]] material.\n\nFollowing this influential lead, and reconsidering the progression and renewal of military load bearing systems around the world, Britain developed the Type [[72 pattern webbing|72 Pattern webbing]], which mainly consisted of two ammunition pouches, to be worn on the front, and a field pack, to be worn on the back, produced of [[Polyurethane]]-coated nylon and [[Butyl rubber]]. This system was never generally issued, but was a Troop Trials Equipment.\n\nThe [[National People's Army]] (''Nationale Volksarmee'') of the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] designed and introduced the [[UTV webbing|''Uniformtrageversuch'' 85-90]] (UTV 85-90), resembling, with the exception of the clothing system, a modified duplicate of the British Type [[58 Pattern webbing]], inheriting very similar features in appearance and function. The shoulder harness was of identical design, the belt had featured the use of identical buckles, and Type 58 Pattern C-hooks had been incorporated in all components. Complementary items, such as pouches, had been changed in design and size, to meet [[Warsaw Pact]] requirements. The webbing system and components were produced of a more robust [[Nylon]] material, and featured the [[Strichtarn]] camouflage pattern. Whilst this late improvement was observed by the British Armed Forces, and being found to be an affront, especially against the [[British Army of the Rhine]] (BAOR), no further considerations have been made, as the testing of prototypic PLCE equipment was already underway.\n\n==85 Pattern==\nDevelopments resumed with the progression of the firearms development and introduction of the [[SA80]] family of British small arms. Trials of experimental '''''PLCE''''' webbing and [[Combat Body Armour]] (CBA) were conducted with selected units in 1984 and 1985. Being very similar to the first standard issue PLCE webbing system, it used snaps of proprietary design for closure on all pouches{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.\n\n==90 Pattern==\nSeven years after the [[Falklands War|Falklands Conflict]], the first standard issue PLCE webbing was introduced in 1989, it was designated the Type ''90 Pattern'' webbing and was [[Olive (color)#Olive drab|Olive (OD/OG)]]  in colour.\n\nThe original components used Type [[58 Pattern webbing|58 Pattern]] C-hooks for the belt attachment, and angled D-rings for the shoulder harness attachment on the ammunition pouches. There were separate left and right pouches. The first utility pouches in production, had additional belt attachments for high mounting, similar to the ammunition pouches of the [[1937 Pattern Web Equipment]] or Type [[44 Pattern]] webbing. Later produced PLCE webbing of the Type 90 Pattern incorporates ambidextrous yoke fittings and the standard PLCE webbing belt attachments (see below).\n\nThe PLCE webbing system was also adopted by the [[Danish Defence|Danish Defence Forces]] (''Forsvaret'') in the [[M84 camouflage pattern|M84]] camouflage pattern and by the [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Defence Forces of Ireland]] (''\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann'') in Olive drab. The Permanent and Reserve Defence Forces now employ the [[Integrated Protection and Load Carrying System]] (IPLCS).\n\nMany other countries still issue, or have issued similar load bearing systems. By way of example, in its year of introduction to the forces, the [[United States Armed Forces]] have adopted the [[Individual Integrated Fighting System]] (IIFS).\n\nThe newest variant of the PLCE webbing system, of the Type 90 Pattern, has been in production since 1992 and features the [[Disruptive Pattern Material]] (DPM) camouflage pattern as being an integral feature of the now partially obsolete [[Combat Soldier 95]] (\"Soldier 95\") clothing system. The official designation remained unchanged.\n\n==95 Pattern==\nWith the introduction of the [[Combat Soldier 95]] (CS95 or \"Soldier 95\") clothing system in 1995, the common misconception arose that a complete revision of the Type 90 Pattern PLCE webbing system was taking place.\n\nThe clothing system underwent final development and entered troop trials in between the years 1992 and 1995. Garments were specifically manufactured for these trials, yet the PLCE webbing system issued, officially remained of the Type 90 Pattern.\n\nDue to confusion, or for the sake of convenience, individual components of the webbing system, were now, as of 1995, unofficially designated, described, and specified as the '''Type 95 Pattern''' webbing, as having been widely understood to be part of the Combat Soldier 95 clothing system. No such official change of designation had taken place.\n\nThe only array of PLCE components that could be considered of the unofficial Type 95 Pattern, are those components produced during or after the year of 1995.\n\n==Construction==\nThe PLCE webbing system is produced from double-layered 1000 [[Denier (unit)|Denier]] internally rubberised [[Cordura]] [[Nylon]], a long lasting and hard wearing fabric. [[Olive (color)#Olive drab|Olive]] webbing of the same material (\"1000 D\") is being incorporated, along with a variety of hard wearing plastic fasteners [[Illinois Tool Works#ITW companies|(ITW Nexus)]], [[Hook and loop fastener]]s ([[Velcro]]) and anti-magnetic press stud fasteners (\"Pull the Dot\").\n\nThe pouches are opened and closed with Spanish Tab fasteners, they can be closed in two different ways, quick release or secure. Small sections of [[Velcro]], sewn on the inside of the lids of the pouches, and the top front section of the pouches, allow for easy and effortless fastening. Added silencer strips allow to cover them when not needed.\n\nA standard ammunition pouch as issued (\"Pouch, Ammunition, Universal, DPM, IRR.\") has two pockets; single pocket versions (\"Pouch, Ammunition (Other Arms), DPM, IRR.\") are available for those individuals not required to carry as much ammunition. Pouches designated to hold ammunition initially contained a dividing strip to hold two magazines in separate compartments and eliminate rattle. Some soldiers, especially infantry soldiers, often removed these dividing strips to make it easier to insert and remove magazines. They also found that three magazines would then fit comfortably and without excessive noise, giving a total capacity of twelve magazines per person in a standard fighting configuration. Later issue ammunition pouches were manufactured without dividers, as eight magazines was not thought to be sufficient for sustained firefights with the enemy. Without dividers, each pouch can now alternatively contain one grenade.\n\nInfrared Reflective (IRR) coating and dyes are incorporated in all fabric and webbing of the PLCE webbing system, which replicates the near-infrared reflectance of natural foliage.\nFor example, green foliage is highly reflective to near-infrared light and thus appears white when viewed through IR optics (or bright green through night vision). The IRR camouflage pattern therefore works correctly when viewed through infrared [[night vision]] optics just as it does in visible light. Non IRR fabric would appear as a solid colour dependant on it's reflectance and the camouflage pattern would be lost.\n\n==Order of Dress==\nThe [[Infantry Trials and Development Unit]] (ITDU) based in [[Warminster#Military|Warminster]], conducted trials with the PLCE webbing system. It had decided for the system to be fit for purpose, and divided the system into three orders of dress:\n\n* Assault Order.\nThe Assault Order consists of the very essentials needed to conduct a military task in the theatre of war. Ammunition, the water bottle, the entrenching tool, the bayonet, the helmet, and [[CBRN]] (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear) protective clothing (stowed in one of the detachable side pouches of the rucksack) is to be carried on operations and patrols of only short duration.\n* Combat Order.\nThe Combat Order is the Assault Order in addition to the means of stowage for rations and personal equipment, that enable the British soldier to live and fight for a period of 24 hours. The second side pouch of the rucksack is now carried. In practice, the patrol packs are used by many units and individual soldiers instead of the side pouches, as they are to be found larger in size and more convenient.\n* Marching Order.\nThe Marching Order is the Combat Order in addition to the carrying of the rucksack (Bergen) and is the fighting load required for operations of up to the duration of two weeks, without means of resupply, except for ammunition, rations and water. The complete Bergen (with side pouches attached) is being carried.\n\n==Configuration==\nThe initial basis of the '''''PLCE''''' webbing system is the belt; it features two D-rings at the back to attach to the shoulder harness, and many rows of narrow vertical slots sewn into the fabric. Two or more front pouches (ammunition or utility) attach to the belt; these have belt loops and feature T-Bar plastic tab attachments to provide more stability and security when connected to the belt. Every major component of the '''''PLCE''''' webbing system features two T-Bar plastic tab attachments.\n\nThe six-point shoulder harness attaches to the two D-rings on the belt and the two A-rings on each front pouch chosen. This benefits the distribution of weight and allows for a more comfortable carry, than provided with the use of a four-point shoulder harness. Pouches that are to be worn on the back (field pack, utility, water bottle, respirator, wire cutter, entrenching tool) attach to the belt using the same loop and tab system.\n\nThe detachable side pouches of a Bergen (''Pouch, Side, Rucksack, DPM, IRR.'') can be attached to the dedicated shoulder harness (''Yoke, Pouch Side, Rucksack, DPM, IRR.'') to construct a day-sack.\n\n==Scaling==\nIn the year 1997, the [[Defence Clothing & Textile Agency|Defence Clothing & Textile Agency (''DCTA'')]] had decided, that Type ''90 Pattern (Infantry)'' equipment was to be scaled and issued in the following capacity.\n \n*01. ''1x Carrier, Entrenching Tool.''\n*02. ''2x Pouch Side, Rucksack.''\n*03. ''1x Carrier, Water Canteen.''\n*04. ''2x Pouch, Ammunition, Universal.''\n*05. ''1x Pouch, Utility.''\n*06. ''1x Haversack, Respirator.''\n*07. ''1x Yoke, Main.''\n*08. ''1x Yoke, Pouch Side, Rucksack.''\n*09. ''2x Strap, Pouch Side, Yoke.''\n*10. ''1x Belt, Waist (of appropriate size).''\n*11. ''2x Strap, Utility, O/D, IRR.''\n*12. ''1x Bayonet, Frog, DPM, IRR.''\n*13. ''1x Rucksack (Infantry) (of appropriate size).''\n*14. ''1x Bag, Insertion, Rucksack.''\n*15. ''2x Bag, Insertion, Pouch, Side, Rucksack.''\n*16. ''1x Bag, Transparent, PLCE, Rucksack.''\n*17. ''2x Bag, Transparent, PLCE, Pouch, Side, Rucksack.''\n\nThe standard issue accoutrement today, dependent upon the branch of service, was changed to the capacity of two front pouches (''Pouch, Ammunition, Universal, DPM, IRR.'') instead of one. To this, privately purchased water bottle or utility pouches and hip pads are often added. The entrenching tool pouch (''Carrier, Entrenching Tool Case, DPM, IRR.'') is sometimes used as an alternative water bottle pouch.\n\nMulti Terrain Pattern (MTP) PLCE is replacing all Disruptive Pattern Material (DPM) PLCE as the core issued webbing equipment for the British Armed Forces, this program started in 2015.\n\n==Components==\nThe following example of individual components, are all current issue items of the [[British Armed Forces]], however many Commercial variants are available.\n* Webbing:\n** Yoke, Main, DPM, IRR.

Following this major improvement, the [[Pouch Attachment Ladder System|Pouch Attachment Ladder System (''PALS'')]] had been incorporated into the [[Osprey body armour|Osprey Body Armour (''OBA'')]] platform, which is currently being issued to British troops on operations world-wide.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/PLCE PLCE on the 'Army Rumour Service' Encyclopedia]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Battaleur 90]], South African equivalent\n*[[Niemoller battle jacket]], South African battle vest\n*[[List of webbing equipment]]\n\n[[Category:British Army equipment]]\n[[Category:Personal military carrying equipment]]\n[[Category:Luggage]]\n", "name_user": "Bellowhead678", "label": "safe", "comment": "Battaleur->Bataleur -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Load_Carrying_Equipment"}
