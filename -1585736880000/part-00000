Each episode is written as if it were a \"real\" incident that Wells had investigated with his girlfriend, Jane Robbins, and as if it had served as an inspiration for a short story.\n\nEach short story adaptation is presented as a flashback to 1893 within a [[frame story]] set in 1946, near to the end of Wells's life, when he is interviewed by members of a secret military research institute interested in his past exploits.<ref>https://variety.com/2001/tv/reviews/the-infinite-worlds-of-h-g-wells-1200469661/</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe filming was done as a full period costume drama, and also took full advantage of notable London locations.  These included the [[London Underground]], where scenes from ''Brownlow's Newspaper'' were shot at the disused [[Aldwych tube station]].\n\n==Actual historical events and places==\nThe miniseries' opening premise is that in 1893 Wells was scientifically untrained, and single. In reality he was neither of those things in 1893. He had studied Zoology and Geology at the Normal School of Science in [[London]], gaining a second-class zoology degree in 1887, but failing the final geology examination. He then taught science in schools in [[Wrexham]] and London whilst studying to re-take both subjects, eventually gaining first-class honours in Zoology and second-class in Geology in 1890. He then secured a teaching post at the University Correspondence College, and in 1891 he married his cousin, Isabel Mary Wells. Wells began writing to supplement his teaching income, and in 1893 met Amy Catherine Robbins one of his students. Disliking the name \"Amy\", he called her \"Jane\". In 1894 Wells left his wife to live with Jane, and they married later that year, after his divorce from Isabel.\n\nAt the opening of the miniseries Amy Robbins is instead called Jane Robbins and is shown to be a teacher of Biology, with Wells initially one of her two potential suitors \u2014 the other being a member of the college staff. Wells is portrayed as a single man, a jobbing journalist and aspiring fiction writer with just five stories to his name.\n\nThe Imperial College of Science \u2014 where Jane Robbins is depicted as teaching \u2014 did not exist in 1893. In 1890 the Normal School of Science \u2014 where Wells had studied \u2014 became the [[Royal College of Science]], which in 1907 was amalgamated with other institutions to form the [[Imperial College of Science and Technology]].\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Main cast===\n*[[Tom Ward]] - [[H.

Each episode is written as if it were a \"real\" incident that Wells had investigated with his girlfriend, Jane Robbins, and as if it had served as an inspiration for a short story.\n\nEach short story adaptation is presented as a flashback to 1893 within a [[frame story]] set in 1946, near to the end of Wells's life, when he is interviewed by members of a secret military research institute interested in his past exploits.<ref>https://variety.com/2001/tv/reviews/the-infinite-worlds-of-h-g-wells-1200469661/</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe filming was done as a full period costume drama, and also took full advantage of notable London locations.  These included the [[London Underground]], where scenes from ''Brownlow's Newspaper'' were shot at the disused [[Aldwych tube station]].\n\n==Actual historical events and places==\nThe miniseries' opening premise is that in 1893 Wells was scientifically untrained, and single. In reality he was neither of those things in 1893. He had studied Zoology and Geology at the Normal School of Science in [[London]], gaining a second-class zoology degree in 1887, but failing the final geology examination. He then taught science in schools in [[Wrexham]] and London whilst studying to re-take both subjects, eventually gaining first-class honours in Zoology and second-class in Geology in 1890. He then secured a teaching post at the University Correspondence College, and in 1891 he married his cousin, Isabel Mary Wells. Wells began writing to supplement his teaching income, and in 1893 met Amy Catherine Robbins one of his students. Disliking the name \"Amy\", he called her \"Jane\". In 1894 Wells left his wife to live with Jane, and they married later that year, after his divorce from Isabel.\n\nAt the opening of the miniseries Amy Robbins is instead called Jane Robbins and is shown to be a teacher of Biology, with Wells initially one of her two potential suitors \u2014 the other being a member of the college staff. Wells is portrayed as a single man, a jobbing journalist and aspiring fiction writer with just five stories to his name.\n\nThe Imperial College of Science \u2014 where Jane Robbins is depicted as teaching \u2014 did not exist in 1893. In 1890 the Normal School of Science \u2014 where Wells had studied \u2014 became the [[Royal College of Science]], which in 1907 was amalgamated with other institutions to form the [[Imperial College of London|Imperial College of Science and Technology]].\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Main cast===\n*[[Tom Ward]] - [[H.

The show was originally hosted by [[Steve Burns]], who left in 2002 and was replaced by [[Donovan Patton]] until 2006. The show follows an animated blue-spotted dog named Blue as she leaves a trail of clues/paw prints for the host and the viewers, in order to figure out her plans for the day. ''Blue's Clues'' became the highest-rated show for preschoolers on American commercial television and was critical to Nickelodeon's growth. It has been called \"one of the most successful, critically acclaimed, and ground-breaking [[preschool]] television series of all time.\"<ref name=\"tenyears-1\"/> A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] called ''[[Blue's Room]]'' premiered in 2004.\n\nThe show's producers and creators presented material in a [[narrative]] format instead of the more traditional [[magazine]] format, used repetition to reinforce its curriculum, and structured every episode the same way. They used research about child development and young children's viewing habits that had been conducted in the thirty years since the debut of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' in the U.S. and revolutionized the genre by inviting their viewers' involvement. Research was part of the creative and decision-making process in the production of the show and was integrated into all aspects and stages of the creative process. ''Blue's Clues'' was the first [[cutout animation]] series for preschoolers and resembles a storybook in its use of primary colors and its simple [[construction paper]] shapes of familiar objects with varied colors and textures. Its home-based setting is familiar to American children but has a look unlike other children's TV shows. A live production of ''Blue's Clues'', which used many of the production innovations developed by the show's creators, toured the U.S. starting in 1999. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances.\n\nBy 2002, ''Blue's Clues'' had received several awards for excellence in children's programming, educational software, and licensing, and had been nominated for nine [[Emmy Awards]]. It has been syndicated in 120 countries and translated into 15 languages. Regional versions of the show featuring local hosts have been produced in other countries. It was one of the first preschool shows to incorporate [[American Sign Language]] into its content. The show's extensive use of research in its development and production process inspired several research studies that have provided evidence for its effectiveness as a learning tool.\n\n''Blue's Clues'' was the longest-running Nick Jr. series until it was surpassed by ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' in 2011. In March 2018, Nickelodeon announced a reboot of the series titled ''[[Blue's Clues & You!]]'', which premiered on November 11, 2019.\n\n==History==\nBy 1990, parents, teachers, and media experts had been criticizing \"the lack of quality fare for children on commercial television\" for many years.<ref>Osborne, p. 1</ref>  Up to that point, [[PBS]] was the only source for quality children's television; other broadcasters voluntarily set educational standards for their programming and \"were expected to regulate themselves\", but it led to little change in the quality of children's programs.<ref name=\"tracy-5\"/><ref name=\"calvert-278\">{{cite journal |last1=Calvert |first1=Sandra L |last2=Kotler |first2=Jennifer A. |title=Lessons from children's television: The impact of the Children's Television Act on children's learning |journal=Applied Developmental Psychology |date=2003 |volume=24 |issue=3 |page=278 |doi=10.1016/S0193-3973(03)00060-1 |citeseerx=10.1.1.727.4871 }}</ref>  By the time ''Blue's Clues'' premiered in 1996, there was a large amount of TV shows for children, but most of them were violent and designed to sell action toys and other products.<ref>Tracy, p. 6</ref><ref>Osborne, p. 2</ref> According to author Diane Tracy in her 2002 book ''Blue's Clues for Success'', \"The state of children's television was pretty dismal.\"<ref name=\"tracy-5\">Tracy, p. 5</ref>{{refn|group=note|Tracy's book is a business guide based on Nickelodeon and the history of ''Blue's Clues''.

To help the audience unlock the puzzle, Blue leaves behind a series of clues, which are objects marked with one of her paw prints. In between the discovery of the clues, Steve plays a series of [[games]] \u2014 mini-puzzles \u2014 with the audience that are thematically related to the overall puzzle&nbsp;... As the show unfolds, Steve and Blue move from one animated set to another, jumping through magical doorways, leading viewers on a journey of discovery, until, at the end of the story, Steve returns to the living room. There, at the climax of the show, he sits down in a comfortable chair to think \u2014 a chair known, of course, in the literal world of ''Blue's Clues'', as the Thinking Chair. He puzzles over Blue's three clues and attempts to come up with the answer.<ref name=\"gladwell-122\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nNickelodeon researcher Daniel R. Anderson called the structure of ''Blue's Clues'' a game that presented its viewers with increasingly challenging and developmentally appropriate problems to solve.<ref name=\"anderson-181\"/> Early episodes focused on basic subjects such as colors and numbers, but later the programs focused on [[Mathematics|math]], [[physics]], [[anatomy]], and [[astronomy]].<ref name=\"schmelzer\"/> The show's producers believed that comprehension and attention were strongly connected, so they wrote the episodes to encourage and increase their viewers' attention. They used content and production characteristics such as pacing which gave children time to respond,<ref name=\"watchlearn\"/> as well as \"camera techniques, children's voices, musical cues, sound effects, clear transitions, repeatable dialogue, and visuals.\"<ref name=\"anderson-181\"/> Participation, in the form of spoken or physical response from the audience, and the mastery of thinking skills were encouraged by the use of repetition, both within the structure of individual episodes and across multiple episodes.<ref name=\"watchlearn\"/> The producers used a variety of formal features, which were auditory, and content features, which consisted of invitations given to the audience, such as \"Will you help?\" The features were also in the form of both recurrent and unique formats and content. The purpose of the recurrent formats and content, which were similar in every episode, was to increase viewers' attention, comprehension, and participation during key educational lessons.<ref name=\"crawley-267\"/>\n\nNickelodeon originally aired the same episode daily for five days before showing the next one. The producers believed this telecast strategy empowered young children by giving them many opportunities to master the content and problems presented to them.<ref name=\"repetition\"/><ref name=\"crawley-265\"/>\n\n==Educational goals==\nThe creators' and producers' goals were to \"empower, challenge, and build the self-esteem of preschoolers\"<ref name=\"anderson-180\"/> while entertaining them. Kessler, Santomero and Johnson were influenced by ''[[Sesame Street]]'', the first children's television program to utilize a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum developed from research.<ref name=\"truglio-234\"/> \"We wanted to learn from ''Sesame Street'' and take it one step further,\" Santomero said.<ref name=\"gladwell-111\"/>  Like ''Sesame Street'', [[Formative assessment|formative research]] which the producers called their \"secret sauce,\"<ref name=\"tracy-67\"/> was used during all aspects of the creative and decision-making process during the production of ''Blue's Clues''.<ref name=\"tracy-66\"/><ref name=\"tracy-70\"/> In addition to a curriculum that emphasized reasoning skills relevant to preschoolers' everyday lives, the producers wanted to include audience participation, called by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' its \"call and response style,\"<ref name=\"schmelzer\"/> that encouraged mastery of the information presented, positive reinforcement, and [[Prosocial behavior|prosocial]] messages.<ref name=\"anderson-180\"/> In their first brainstorming sessions in 1994, Santomero, Kessler, and Johnson decided to promote mastery rather than rote learning or memorizing, make sure that their viewers knew the answers to the puzzles with which they were presented, and include elements of surprise and play. By 2001, the show's research team consisted of head researcher Alice Wilder, Alison Sherman, Karen Leavitt, and Koshi Dhingra.<ref name=\"bugs-3\"/>{{refn|Alice Wilder joined the team shortly after its debut and, according to Tracy, reinvented the role of research in children's television, as well as helping to train the writers and animators to trust and use research.<ref name=\"tracy-68\"/>|group=note}} The research team and creators worked collaboratively.<ref name=\"tracy-72\"/>\n\nUnlike ''Sesame Street'', which tested a third of its episodes,<ref name=\"gladwell-127\"/> the ''Blue's Clues'' research team field tested every episode three times with children aged between two to six in preschool environments such as [[Head Start Program|Head Start]] programs, public schools, and private day care centers. There were three phases of testing: content evaluation, video evaluations, and content analysis.<ref name=\"anderson-182\"/> In their tests of the pilot, conducted throughout the New York City area with over 100 children aged from three to seven,<ref name=\"tracy-21\"/> the show was \"immediately successful.\"<ref name=\"tenyears-1\"/>  They found that as the pilot progressed, children's attention was not only captured and sustained, but they became excited and actively participated with what they saw, to the point that they stood up to get closer to the television and spoke back to the host.<ref name=\"tracy-2223\"/> The producers and researchers also consulted outside advisers, who were chosen based on their expertise and the needs of each script. As Anderson stated, the formative research team served \"as a liaison between the feedback provided by the preschoolers and outside advisers and the production team, including writers, talent, producers, directors, element artists, and animators.\"<ref name=\"anderson-182\"/>\n\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 30em\n|border    = 1px\n|align     = right\n|bgcolor   = #c6dbf7\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = When I believed we had the best show on television that could educate preschoolers and positively impact their lives, I was relentless.

They wanted to provide their viewers with more \"authentic learning opportunities\"<ref name=\"bugs-3\"/> by placing problem-solving tasks within the stories they told, by slowly increasing the difficulty of these tasks, and by inviting their involvement.<ref name=\"bugs-3\"/><ref name=\"anderson2-35\"/> These learning opportunities included the use of [[mnemonics]] in the form of mantras and songs, and what Tracy called \"metacognitive wrap-up\"<ref name=\"tracy-40\"/> at the end of each episode, in which the lessons were summarized and rehearsed. The producers wanted to foster their audience's sense of empowerment by eliciting their assistance for the show's host and by encouraging their identification with the character Blue, who served as a stand-in for the typical preschooler.<ref name=\"tracy-2122\"/>\n\n''Sesame Street'' reflected the prevailing view that preschoolers had short attention spans; it featured a magazine-like format<ref name=\"watchlearn\"/> consisting of varied segments.<ref name=\"truglio-234\"/> Based on research conducted over the 30 years since the launch of ''Sesame Street'' by theorists like Anderson, the producers of ''Blue's Clues'' wanted to develop a show that took advantage of children's intellectual and behavioral activity when watching television. Previous children's television programs presented their content with little input from their viewers, but ''Blue's Clues'' was one of the first children's shows to actively invite its viewers' involvement. Its creators believed that if children were more involved in what they were viewing, they would attend to its content longer than previously expected\u2014for up to a half hour\u2014and learn more. They also dropped the magazine format for a more traditional [[narrative]] format. As ''Variety'' magazine stated, \"...&nbsp;The choice for ''Blue's Clues'' became to tell one story, beginning to end, camera moving left-to-right like reading a storybook, transitions from scene to scene as obvious as the turning of a page.\"<ref name=\"interactive\"/> Every episode of ''Blue's Clues'' was structured in this way.<ref name=\"interactive\"/>\n\nThe pace of ''Blue's Clues'' was deliberate, and its material was presented clearly.<ref name=\"tubefortots\"/> Similar to ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'', which also inspired the producers,<ref name=\"tracy-18\"/> this was done was in the use of pauses that were \"long enough to give the youngest time to think, short enough for the oldest not to get bored.\"<ref name=\"interactive\"/> The length of the pauses, which was estimated from formative research, gave children enough time to process the information and solve the problem. After pausing, child voice-overs provided the answers so that they were given to children who had not come up with the solution and helped encourage viewer participation. Researcher Alisha M. Crawley and her colleagues stated that the show was \"unique in making overt involvement a systematic research-based design element.\"<ref name=\"crawley-265\"/> In 2002, the success of ''Blue's Clues'' inspired the producers of ''Sesame Street'' to change its format and add more interactive segments.<ref name=\"schmelzer\"/> ''Blue's Clues'' also differed from ''Sesame Street'' by not using cultural references or humor aimed at adults, as this could confuse preschoolers but, instead, made the show literal, which the producers felt would better hold the children's attention.<ref name=\"tracy-19\"/> The structure of each episode was repetitive, designed to provide preschoolers with comfort and predictability.<ref name=\"tracy-40\"/>\n\n==Production==\n''Blue's Clues'' was set in the home\u2014the environment that was most familiar and secure for preschoolers\u2014and looked like no other children's television show.<ref name=\"tracy-18\"/> Each episode was in development, from idea development to final production, for approximately one year. Writers created a goal sheet, which identified their objectives based on the show's curriculum and audience needs. Script drafts, once developed and approved by the show's creators and research team, were tested at public and private schools, day care centers, preschools, and Head Start programs by three researchers, who would narrate the story in the form of a storybook and take notes about the children's responses. The writers and creators revised the scripts based on this feedback. A rough video, in which the host performed from the revised script in front of a blue screen with no animation, was filmed and retested. The script was revised based on the audiences' responses, tested a third time with animation and music added, and incorporated into future productions.<ref name=\"tracy-8284\"/>\n\nMost of the show's production was done in-house, rather than by outside companies as was customary for children's TV shows.<ref name=\"tracy-103\"/> The show's creators understood that the look and visual design of the show would be integral to children's attachment with it.<ref name=\"tracy-95\"/> Johnson expanded on the \"cut-out\" style she had created during her college years. ''Blue's Clues'' was the first animated series for preschoolers that utilized simple cut-out construction paper shapes of familiar objects with a wide variety of colors and textures, resembling a storybook.<ref name=\"tracy-41\"/> Johnson also used primary colors and organized each room of the home setting into groups. The green-striped shirt worn by the show's original host, Steve, was inspired by [[Fruit Stripe]] [[Chewing gum|gum]].<ref name=\"tracy-42\"/> The goals were to make the show look natural and simplistic; as Tracy put it, \"freshly cut and glued together with a vivid array of textures, colors, and shadows\"<ref name=\"tracy-4243\"/> similar to picture book illustrations. The music, produced by composer Michael Rubin and pianist Nick Balaban, was simple, had a natural sound, and exposed children to a wide variety of genres and instruments. According to Tracy, the music empowered children and gave the show \"a sense of playfulness, a sense of joy, and a sense of the fantastic\".<ref name=\"tracy-51\"/> Rubin and Balaban encouraged the musicians who performed for the show to improvise.<ref name=\"tracy-5052\"/>\n\nThe host performed each episode in front of a \"[[Chroma key|blue screen]]\", with animation added later.<ref name=\"tracy-45\"/> The show's digital design department combined high-tech and low-tech methods by creating and photographing three-dimensional objects, then cutting them out and placing them into the background.<ref name=\"tracy-103\"/> This made the objects look more real and added perspective and depth.<ref name=\"tracy-43\"/> Their animation technique was at that time a new technology. Johnson hired artist Dave Palmer and production company Big Pink to create the animation from simple materials like fabric, paper, or pipe-cleaners, and scan them into a [[Macintosh]] computer so that they could be animated using inexpensive computer software such as [[Media 100]], Ultimatte, [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] and [[Adobe After Effects|After Effects]],<ref name=\"tracy-100\"/>{{refn|[[Adobe Systems]] was surprised that their products were being used in the production of a children's television show. According to Tracy, \"Not even the developers of the software knew it could be used to create character animation on the scale ''Blue's Clues'' was using it\".<ref name=\"tracy-106\"/> Adobe later requested that the show's animators join their client development group, and made several changes and improvements to their software as a result.|group=note}} instead of being repeatedly redrawn as in traditional animation.<ref name=\"tracy-94\"/> Johnson credited Kessler with the idea of using the Macintosh.<ref name=\"carter\"/>  The result was something that looked different from anything else on television at the time, and the producers were able to animate two episodes in eight weeks, as compared to the sixteen weeks necessary to create a single episode by traditional methods.<ref name=\"tracy-94\"/> Their process looked like traditional cut-out animation, but was faster, more flexible, and less expensive, and it allowed them to make changes based on feedback from test audiences.<ref name=\"tracy-101\"/> Unlike traditional animation environments, which tended to be highly structured, the animators were given information about the characters and goals of the scenes they would animate, and then given the freedom to work out the timing and look of each scene themselves, as long as their creations were true to the characters and to the story.<ref name=\"tracy-105\"/> By 1999, the show's animation department consisted of Palmer, 20 animators, 11 digital designers, and 5 art directors and model makers. By 2002, Nickelodeon had built a \"state-of-the-art\"<ref name=\"tracy-109\"/> $6 million digital animation studio that housed 140 people, including 70 animators.<ref name=\"tracy-107\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nRatings for ''Blue's Clues'' were high during its first season, and it was Nickelodeon's most popular preschool program.<ref name=\"anderson2-35\"/> It has been described as the first commercial television show for preschoolers that was both educational and profitable.<ref name=\"tracy-35\"/> Its creators met regularly with businesses that developed ''Blue's Clues'' merchandise and products to ensure toys that were educational and met \"the same high&nbsp;... standards as the show.\"<ref name=\"tracy-35\"/> Products, like the show, were heavily tested prior to marketing.<ref name=\"tracy-156\"/>{{refn|In order to keep the integrity of the ''Blue's Clues'' brand intact, a branding guide \"bible\" called ''Blue's Clues 101'' was created that explained the show and provided examples of products that both correctly and incorrectly reflected it.<ref name=\"tracy-155\"/>|group=note}} ''Blue's Clues'' had sold almost 40 million units of its 45 VHS and DVD titles by 1998<ref name=\"skein\"/> and generated over $1 billion in product licensing in 2000.<ref name=\"tracy-3\"/> More than ten million ''Blue's Clues'' books were in print by 2001 and over three million copies of six CD-ROM titles based on the show had been sold.<ref name=\"tracy-4\"/> Seven ''Blue's Clues'' titles sold at least 1 million copies each.<ref name=\"skein\"/> The show's first [[direct-to-video]] production was ''[[Blue's Big Musical Movie]]'' (2000), featuring [[Ray Charles]] and [[The Persuasions]]; it received mostly positive reviews<ref name=\"goodall\"/> and has sold over 3 million copies since 2006.<ref name=\"skein\"/> The launch of ''Blue's Clues'' products at [[FAO Schwarz]]'s flagship store in New York City was the most successful product launch in the store's history and was attended by over 7,000 people.<ref name=\"tracy-5\"/> By 2002, ''Blue's Clues'' had received several awards for children's programming, educational software, and licensing<ref name=\"tracy-4\"/> and been nominated for nine [[Emmy Award]]s.<ref name=\"tracy-xi\"/> It also won a [[Peabody Award]] in 2001.<ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/blues-clues 61st Annual Peabody Awards], May 2002.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ray Charles (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Ray Charles]], shown here in 1990, appeared in the popular ''Blue's Clues'' VHS ''Blue's Big Musical Movie''. It was his final film role prior to his death four years later, in 2004.]]\n\nStarting in 1999, a live production of ''Blue's Clues'' toured the U.S. to positive reviews.<ref name=\"tracy-53\"/> Johnson compared the show's audience participation with that of ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]''.<ref name=\"skiddoos\"/> As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances.<ref name=\"tracy-53\"/> The creators of the TV show were involved in all aspects of the live show, aiming to translate the bond between the TV show's audience and its cast to the stage<ref name=\"tracy-55\"/> and to provide young audiences with their first theatrical experience.<ref name=\"skiddoos\"/> The creators chose Jonathan Hochwald as the live show's producer,<ref name=\"tracy-53\"/> Gip Hoppe as its director, and Dave Gallo as its set designer. Neither Hoppe nor Gallo had any previous experience in children's theater.<ref name=\"tracy-54\"/> Nick Balaban and Michael Rubin, who wrote the music for the TV show, composed the live show's soundtrack.<ref name=\"tracy-55\"/> The producers were concerned with children's response to the host, who was played by Tom Mizer (a different actor than the host of the TV show), but his young audience enthusiastically accepted and embraced him.<ref name=\"tracy-56\"/> Actors were encouraged to improvise and respond to the audience, which resulted in changes throughout the show's run. The show's script included humor that both children and their parents could enjoy.<ref name=\"tracy-5657\"/>\n\nRegional versions of the show, featuring native hosts, have been produced in other countries. In the United Kingdom it was hosted by [[Kevin Duala]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/5DTr0qKGWk6Z2wXdr8lyXtD/kevin-duala|title=The One Show - Kevin Duala - BBC One|website=BBC}}</ref> and the Korean version became part of [[popular culture|pop culture]] in [[South Korea]].<ref name=\"tracy-5960\"/> In total, the show was syndicated in 120 countries, and was translated into 15 languages.<ref name=\"schmelzer\"/> In 2000, it became one of the first preschool shows to incorporate [[American Sign Language]] into its content, with between five and ten signs used consistently in each episode.<ref name=\"lee\"/> ''Blue's Clues'' won an award from the Greater Los Angeles Agency on Deafness (GLAD) for promoting deaf awareness in the media.<ref name=\"tracy-58\"/>\n\n==Influence==\nThe show's extensive use of research in its development and production process inspired several studies that provided evidence for its effectiveness as a learning tool. Field tests showed that the attention and comprehension of young viewers increased with each repeat viewing.<ref name=\"gladwell-125126\"/> In 1999, Anderson and a team of researchers, some of which were his colleagues at Nickelodeon, studied how episode repetition affected comprehension, audience participation, and visual attention. The researchers tested whether repeated viewings of the show resulted in mastery over the material presented, or whether viewers would habituate or become bored.<ref name=\"anderson-183\"/> They discovered that audience participation was lower for the first few viewings, because children paid more attention to unfamiliar material, and because it was more cognitively demanding to understand and solve the problems presented. After five viewings, more of the viewers' cognitive resources were available for interaction and participation, so they answered more questions. Episode repetition seemed to empower viewers, as shown in their enthusiastic efforts to solve the problems presented to them.<ref name=\"anderson-184\"/> Repetition, which the researchers called \"an inexpensive tool to maximize comprehension,\"<ref name=\"anderson-192\"/> improved comprehension, held children's attention, and increased audience participation.<ref name=\"media-51\"/> Children were not only tolerant of repetition, they were \"positively enthusiastic\"<ref name=\"anderson-192\"/> about it. [[Nielsen ratings]] of the show's first season, when the same episode was shown daily, were flat over the five-day period, which indicated to Anderson that young children did not tire of its repetition or of its complexity over time.<ref name=\"anderson2-35\"/> Anderson and Crawley felt that the telecast strategy helped increase the show's ratings and called it a success.<ref name=\"effect-636\"/>\n\nIn 2000, another team of researchers, including Anderson, Crawley, and other Nickelodeon colleagues, studied whether experienced ''Blue's Clues'' viewers interacted more with the show than less-frequent viewers and whether regular viewers of the show interacted more with other shows than did children who were not.<ref name=\"anderson184185\"/> They found that when the content of a program was new and challenging, children paid more attention, and when it was familiar, either from previous viewings or in a format they recognized, they instead interacted more. In short, they found that \"interaction in ''Blue's Clues'' to some extent reflects mastery.\"<ref name=\"anderson185186\"/> A similar study, also conducted in 2000 by many of the same researchers, found that experienced ''Blue's Clues'' viewers interacted more with other educational programs than did inexperienced viewers, which proved that watching ''Blue's Clues'' changed the way children watch television.<ref name=\"anderson-186\"/> Researcher Shalom M. Fisch, however, stated that although the show attempted to be \"participatory,\" it could not truly be so, because unlike interactive computer games, the viewers' responses could not change or influence what occurred on-screen.<ref name=\"learning\"/>\n\nJennings Bryant conducted a two-year longitudinal study of the effects of ''Blue's Clues'' at the [[University of Alabama]] in 2001 to ascertain whether or not the show's curriculum goals were achieved. He compared regular viewers and non-viewers and found that the show's episode repetition strategy improved children's comprehension while holding their attention and increasing their participation, which suggested that watching ''Blue's Clues'' increased children's learning and social interactions. At the end of the study, regular viewers outperformed the non-viewers, solving problems more successfully and systematically.<ref name=\"media-46\"/> Anderson stated, \"Given the program's large audience, it appears that the program is not only doing well, but it is also doing good.\"<ref name=\"anderson-192\"/>\n\n[[File:MarleeMatlinMay09.jpg|thumb|right|Actress [[Marlee Matlin]], shown here in 2009, appeared in several ''Blue's Clues'' episodes introducing American Sign Language to its young viewers.]]\n\nIn 2002, Crawley, Anderson, Kiersten Clark, and their colleagues conducted another study on the effects of ''Blue's Clues'', this time researching whether more experienced viewers mastered the content and cognitive challenges faster and easier than first-time viewers. They surmised that experienced viewers would comprehend and interact more with the recurring and familiar segments of the show designed to aid comprehension,<ref name=\"crawley266268\"/> but they found that familiarity with the structure of an individual episode did not provide experienced viewers with an advantage over the inexperienced viewers. Crawley and Anderson also studied whether experienced viewers of ''Blue's Clues'' interacted more with other children's TV shows<ref name=\"crawley-274275\"/> and whether the viewing behaviors they learned from ''Blue's Clues'' could be transferred to other shows.<ref name=\"crawley-278\"/> They found that although experienced viewers of ''Blue's Clues'' interacted with an episode of another series, they did not spend more time watching it than viewers unfamiliar with the show. The researchers stated, \"It is apparent that, although preschoolers learn to enthusiastically engage in overt audience participation, they do not, by and large, have a metacognitive understanding of why they do so.\"<ref name=\"crawley-278\"/> The 2002 studies demonstrated that experience with watching one TV series affects how children watch other programs, especially in the way they interact with them.<ref name=\"crawley-278\"/> They also showed that since children are selective in the material they attend to and that their interaction increases with comprehension and mastery, children tend to pay more attention to novel information and interact more with material they have seen before and mastered. The researchers predicted that since shows like ''Blue's Clues'' help children feel empowered to learn, it could have long-term effects in motivating children to learn and provide them with a lifelong love of learning.<ref name=\"crawley-279\"/>\n\nErin Ryan and her colleagues performed a 2009 study on the effect of the use of American Sign Language (ASL) in ''Blue's Clues'' episodes. They analyzed 16 episodes over two weeks for the content and frequency of the signs used and found a high incidence of ASL usage by various characters, but that it was inconsistent, especially in the connection between English words and their corresponding signs.<ref name=\"ryan-17\"/><ref name=\"ryan-20\"/> The purpose of signed communication and its connection with ASL and the Deaf community was not clearly explained, either. The researchers speculated that hearing children with no previous ASL exposure would be familiarized with ASL and the deaf by these episodes, thus reducing the stigma attached to deafness and hard of hearing individuals. Based on other research about the positive effects of teaching ASL to hearing children, the researchers also speculated that it could lead to an increase of vocabulary skills and IQ, as well as improve interpersonal communication. They surmised that deaf children would feel more included and less isolated and be provided with the opportunity to view positive models of ASL and deaf people.<ref name=\"ryan-17\"/>\n\nGeorgene L. Troseth and her colleagues at [[Vanderbilt University]] studied how toddlers use information gained from prerecorded video and from interactions with a person through closed-circuit video, and found that two-year-olds do not learn as much from prerecorded videos because the videos lack social cues and personal references.<ref name=\"troseth-786\"/> Two-year-olds who viewed a pretaped video with instructions about how to find a toy in an adjoining room by a non-interactive researcher did not use the information, even though they smiled and responded to questions. Troseth speculated that their research had implications for interactive educational shows like ''Blue's Clues'', which although was \"on the right track\"<ref name=\"troseth-796\"/> due to the way in which the host invites interaction with the show's viewers, did not provide children with the social cues to solve real-world problems. Troseth stated that repetition, repeated exposure, and familiarity with the show's host may increase children's ability to learn facts and to use strategies they learn from ''Blue's Clues'' to solve new problems. Her research suggested that ''Blue's Clues'' engaged young children and elicited their active participation because they mimicked social interaction.<ref name=\"troseth-796\"/> A longitudinal study published in 2005 found that early exposure to ''Blue's Clues'' to children between six and thirty months of age was positively linked with vocabulary and expressive language later learned.<ref name=\"media-49\"/>\n\n==2019 reboot==\n{{Main|Blue's Clues & You!}}\nIn March 2018, Nickelodeon announced a reboot of the series, with a new host and 20 new episodes.

The show was originally hosted by [[Steve Burns]], who left in 2002 and was replaced by [[Donovan Patton]] until 2006. The show follows an animated blue-spotted dog named Blue as she leaves a trail of clues/paw prints for the host and the viewers, in order to figure out her plans for the day. ''Blue's Clues'' became the highest-rated show for preschoolers on American commercial television and was critical to Nickelodeon's growth. It has been called \"one of the most successful, critically acclaimed, and ground-breaking [[preschool]] television series of all time.\"<ref name=\"tenyears-1\"/> A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] called ''[[Blue's Room]]'' premiered in 2004.\n\nThe show's producers and creators presented material in a [[narrative]] format instead of the more traditional [[magazine]] format, used repetition to reinforce its curriculum, and structured every episode the same way. They used research about child development and young children's viewing habits that had been conducted in the thirty years since the debut of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' in the U.S. and revolutionized the genre by inviting their viewers' involvement. Research was part of the creative and decision-making process in the production of the show and was integrated into all aspects and stages of the creative process. ''Blue's Clues'' was the first [[cutout animation]] series for preschoolers and resembles a storybook in its use of primary colors and its simple [[construction paper]] shapes of familiar objects with varied colors and textures. Its home-based setting is familiar to American children but has a look unlike other children's TV shows. A live production of ''Blue's Clues'', which used many of the production innovations developed by the show's creators, toured the U.S. starting in 1999. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances.\n\nBy 2002, ''Blue's Clues'' had received several awards for excellence in children's programming, educational software, and licensing, and had been nominated for nine [[Emmy Awards]]. It has been syndicated in 120 countries and translated into 15 languages. Regional versions of the show featuring local hosts have been produced in other countries. It was one of the first preschool shows to incorporate [[American Sign Language]] into its content.

To help the audience unlock the puzzle, Blue leaves behind a series of clues, which are objects marked with one of her paw prints. In between the discovery of the clues, Steve plays a series of [[games]] \u2014 mini-puzzles \u2014 with the audience that are thematically related to the overall puzzle&nbsp;... As the show unfolds, Steve and Blue move from one animated set to another, jumping through magical doorways, leading viewers on a journey of discovery, until, at the end of the story, Steve returns to the living room. There, at the climax of the show, he sits down in a comfortable chair to think \u2014 a chair known, of course, in the literal world of ''Blue's Clues'', as the Thinking Chair. He puzzles over Blue's three clues and attempts to come up with the answer.<ref name=\"gladwell-122\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nNickelodeon researcher Daniel R. Anderson called the structure of ''Blue's Clues'' a game that presented its viewers with increasingly challenging and developmentally appropriate problems to solve.<ref name=\"anderson-181\"/> Early episodes focused on basic subjects such as colors and numbers, but later the programs focused on [[Mathematics|math]], [[physics]], [[anatomy]], and [[astronomy]].<ref name=\"schmelzer\"/> The show's producers believed that comprehension and attention were strongly connected, so they wrote the episodes to encourage and increase their viewers' attention. They used content and production characteristics such as pacing which gave children time to respond,<ref name=\"watchlearn\"/> as well as \"camera techniques, children's voices, musical cues, sound effects, clear transitions, repeatable dialogue, and visuals.\"<ref name=\"anderson-181\"/> Participation, in the form of spoken or physical response from the audience, and the mastery of thinking skills were encouraged by the use of repetition, both within the structure of individual episodes and across multiple episodes.<ref name=\"watchlearn\"/> The producers used a variety of formal features, which were auditory, and content features, which consisted of invitations given to the audience, such as \"Will you help?\" The features were also in the form of both recurrent and unique formats and content. The purpose of the recurrent formats and content, which were similar in every episode, was to increase viewers' attention, comprehension, and participation during key educational lessons.<ref name=\"crawley-267\"/>\n\nNickelodeon originally aired the same episode daily for five days before showing the next one. The producers believed this telecast strategy empowered young children by giving them many opportunities to master the content and problems presented to them.<ref name=\"repetition\"/><ref name=\"crawley-265\"/>\n\n==Educational goals==\nThe creators' and producers' goals were to \"empower, challenge, and build the self-esteem of preschoolers\"<ref name=\"anderson-180\"/> while entertaining them. Kessler, Santomero and Johnson were influenced by ''[[Sesame Street]]'', the first children's television program to utilize a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum developed from research.<ref name=\"truglio-234\"/> \"We wanted to learn from ''Sesame Street'' and take it one step further,\" Santomero said.<ref name=\"gladwell-111\"/>  Like ''Sesame Street'', [[Formative assessment|formative research]] which the producers called their \"secret sauce,\"<ref name=\"tracy-67\"/> was used during all aspects of the creative and decision-making process during the production of ''Blue's Clues''.<ref name=\"tracy-66\"/><ref name=\"tracy-70\"/> In addition to a curriculum that emphasized reasoning skills relevant to preschoolers' everyday lives, the producers wanted to include audience participation, called by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' its \"call and response style,\"<ref name=\"schmelzer\"/> that encouraged mastery of the information presented, positive reinforcement, and [[Prosocial behavior|prosocial]] messages.<ref name=\"anderson-180\"/> In their first brainstorming sessions in 1994, Santomero, Kessler, and Johnson decided to promote mastery rather than rote learning or memorizing, make sure that their viewers knew the answers to the puzzles with which they were presented, and include elements of surprise and play. By 2001, the show's research team consisted of head researcher Alice Wilder, Alison Sherman, Karen Leavitt, and Koshi Dhingra.<ref name=\"bugs-3\"/>{{refn|Alice Wilder joined the team shortly after its debut and, according to Tracy, reinvented the role of research in children's television, as well as helping to train the writers and animators to trust and use research.<ref name=\"tracy-68\"/>|group=note}} The research team and creators worked collaboratively.<ref name=\"tracy-72\"/>\n\nUnlike ''Sesame Street'', which tested a third of its episodes,<ref name=\"gladwell-127\"/> the ''Blue's Clues'' research team field tested every episode three times with children aged between two to six in preschool environments such as [[Head Start Program|Head Start]] programs, public schools, and private day care centers. There were three phases of testing: content evaluation, video evaluations, and content analysis.<ref name=\"anderson-182\"/> In their tests of the pilot, conducted throughout the New York City area with over 100 children aged from three to seven,<ref name=\"tracy-21\"/> the show was \"immediately successful.\"<ref name=\"tenyears-1\"/>  They found that as the pilot progressed, children's attention was not only captured and sustained, but they became excited and actively participated with what they saw, to the point that they stood up to get closer to the television and spoke back to the host.<ref name=\"tracy-2223\"/> The producers and researchers also consulted outside advisers, who were chosen based on their expertise and the needs of each script. As Anderson stated, the formative research team served \"as a liaison between the feedback provided by the preschoolers and outside advisers and the production team, including writers, talent, producers, directors, element artists, and animators.\"<ref name=\"anderson-182\"/>\n\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 30em\n|border    = 1px\n|align     = right\n|bgcolor   = #c6dbf7\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = When I believed we had the best show on television that could educate preschoolers and positively impact their lives, I was relentless.

They wanted to provide their viewers with more \"authentic learning opportunities\"<ref name=\"bugs-3\"/> by placing problem-solving tasks within the stories they told, by slowly increasing the difficulty of these tasks, and by inviting their involvement.<ref name=\"bugs-3\"/><ref name=\"anderson2-35\"/> These learning opportunities included the use of [[mnemonics]] in the form of mantras and songs, and what Tracy called \"metacognitive wrap-up\"<ref name=\"tracy-40\"/> at the end of each episode, in which the lessons were summarized and rehearsed. The producers wanted to foster their audience's sense of empowerment by eliciting their assistance for the show's host and by encouraging their identification with the character Blue, who served as a stand-in for the typical preschooler.<ref name=\"tracy-2122\"/>\n\n''Sesame Street'' reflected the prevailing view that preschoolers had short attention spans; it featured a magazine-like format<ref name=\"watchlearn\"/> consisting of varied segments.<ref name=\"truglio-234\"/> Based on research conducted over the 30 years since the launch of ''Sesame Street'' by theorists like Anderson, the producers of ''Blue's Clues'' wanted to develop a show that took advantage of children's intellectual and behavioral activity when watching television. Previous children's television programs presented their content with little input from their viewers, but ''Blue's Clues'' was one of the first children's shows to actively invite its viewers' involvement. Its creators believed that if children were more involved in what they were viewing, they would attend to its content longer than previously expected\u2014for up to a half hour\u2014and learn more. They also dropped the magazine format for a more traditional [[narrative]] format. As ''Variety'' magazine stated, \"...&nbsp;The choice for ''Blue's Clues'' became to tell one story, beginning to end, camera moving left-to-right like reading a storybook, transitions from scene to scene as obvious as the turning of a page.\"<ref name=\"interactive\"/> Every episode of ''Blue's Clues'' was structured in this way.<ref name=\"interactive\"/>\n\nThe pace of ''Blue's Clues'' was deliberate, and its material was presented clearly.<ref name=\"tubefortots\"/> Similar to ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'', which also inspired the producers,<ref name=\"tracy-18\"/> this was done was in the use of pauses that were \"long enough to give the youngest time to think, short enough for the oldest not to get bored.\"<ref name=\"interactive\"/> The length of the pauses, which was estimated from formative research, gave children enough time to process the information and solve the problem. After pausing, child voice-overs provided the answers so that they were given to children who had not come up with the solution and helped encourage viewer participation. Researcher Alisha M. Crawley and her colleagues stated that the show was \"unique in making overt involvement a systematic research-based design element.\"<ref name=\"crawley-265\"/> In 2002, the success of ''Blue's Clues'' inspired the producers of ''Sesame Street'' to change its format and add more interactive segments.<ref name=\"schmelzer\"/> ''Blue's Clues'' also differed from ''Sesame Street'' by not using cultural references or humor aimed at adults, as this could confuse preschoolers but, instead, made the show literal, which the producers felt would better hold the children's attention.<ref name=\"tracy-19\"/> The structure of each episode was repetitive, designed to provide preschoolers with comfort and predictability.<ref name=\"tracy-40\"/>\n\n==Production==\n''Blue's Clues'' was set in the home\u2014the environment that was most familiar and secure for preschoolers\u2014and looked like no other children's television show.<ref name=\"tracy-18\"/> Each episode was in development, from idea development to final production, for approximately one year. Writers created a goal sheet, which identified their objectives based on the show's curriculum and audience needs. Script drafts, once developed and approved by the show's creators and research team, were tested at public and private schools, day care centers, preschools, and Head Start programs by three researchers, who would narrate the story in the form of a storybook and take notes about the children's responses. The writers and creators revised the scripts based on this feedback. A rough video, in which the host performed from the revised script in front of a blue screen with no animation, was filmed and retested. The script was revised based on the audiences' responses, tested a third time with animation and music added, and incorporated into future productions.<ref name=\"tracy-8284\"/>\n\nMost of the show's production was done in-house, rather than by outside companies as was customary for children's TV shows.<ref name=\"tracy-103\"/> The show's creators understood that the look and visual design of the show would be integral to children's attachment with it.<ref name=\"tracy-95\"/> Johnson expanded on the \"cut-out\" style she had created during her college years. ''Blue's Clues'' was the first animated series for preschoolers that utilized simple cut-out construction paper shapes of familiar objects with a wide variety of colors and textures, resembling a storybook.<ref name=\"tracy-41\"/> Johnson also used primary colors and organized each room of the home setting into groups. The green-striped shirt worn by the show's original host, Steve, was inspired by [[Fruit Stripe]] [[Chewing gum|gum]].<ref name=\"tracy-42\"/> The goals were to make the show look natural and simplistic; as Tracy put it, \"freshly cut and glued together with a vivid array of textures, colors, and shadows\"<ref name=\"tracy-4243\"/> similar to picture book illustrations. The music, produced by composer Michael Rubin and pianist Nick Balaban, was simple, had a natural sound, and exposed children to a wide variety of genres and instruments. According to Tracy, the music empowered children and gave the show \"a sense of playfulness, a sense of joy, and a sense of the fantastic\".<ref name=\"tracy-51\"/> Rubin and Balaban encouraged the musicians who performed for the show to improvise.<ref name=\"tracy-5052\"/>\n\nThe host performed each episode in front of a \"[[Chroma key|blue screen]]\", with animation added later.<ref name=\"tracy-45\"/> The show's digital design department combined high-tech and low-tech methods by creating and photographing three-dimensional objects, then cutting them out and placing them into the background.<ref name=\"tracy-103\"/> This made the objects look more real and added perspective and depth.<ref name=\"tracy-43\"/> Their animation technique was at that time a new technology. Johnson hired artist Dave Palmer and production company Big Pink to create the animation from simple materials like fabric, paper, or pipe-cleaners, and scan them into a [[Macintosh]] computer so that they could be animated using inexpensive computer software such as [[Media 100]], Ultimatte, [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] and [[Adobe After Effects|After Effects]],<ref name=\"tracy-100\"/>{{refn|[[Adobe Systems]] was surprised that their products were being used in the production of a children's television show. According to Tracy, \"Not even the developers of the software knew it could be used to create character animation on the scale ''Blue's Clues'' was using it\".<ref name=\"tracy-106\"/> Adobe later requested that the show's animators join their client development group, and made several changes and improvements to their software as a result.|group=note}} instead of being repeatedly redrawn as in traditional animation.<ref name=\"tracy-94\"/> Johnson credited Kessler with the idea of using the Macintosh.<ref name=\"carter\"/>  The result was something that looked different from anything else on television at the time, and the producers were able to animate two episodes in eight weeks, as compared to the sixteen weeks necessary to create a single episode by traditional methods.<ref name=\"tracy-94\"/> Their process looked like traditional cut-out animation, but was faster, more flexible, and less expensive, and it allowed them to make changes based on feedback from test audiences.<ref name=\"tracy-101\"/> Unlike traditional animation environments, which tended to be highly structured, the animators were given information about the characters and goals of the scenes they would animate, and then given the freedom to work out the timing and look of each scene themselves, as long as their creations were true to the characters and to the story.<ref name=\"tracy-105\"/> By 1999, the show's animation department consisted of Palmer, 20 animators, 11 digital designers, and 5 art directors and model makers. By 2002, Nickelodeon had built a \"state-of-the-art\"<ref name=\"tracy-109\"/> $6 million digital animation studio that housed 140 people, including 70 animators.<ref name=\"tracy-107\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nRatings for ''Blue's Clues'' were high during its first season, and it was Nickelodeon's most popular preschool program.<ref name=\"anderson2-35\"/> It has been described as the first commercial television show for preschoolers that was both educational and profitable.<ref name=\"tracy-35\"/> Its creators met regularly with businesses that developed ''Blue's Clues'' merchandise and products to ensure toys that were educational and met \"the same high&nbsp;... standards as the show.\"<ref name=\"tracy-35\"/> Products, like the show, were heavily tested prior to marketing.<ref name=\"tracy-156\"/>{{refn|In order to keep the integrity of the ''Blue's Clues'' brand intact, a branding guide \"bible\" called ''Blue's Clues 101'' was created that explained the show and provided examples of products that both correctly and incorrectly reflected it.<ref name=\"tracy-155\"/>|group=note}} ''Blue's Clues'' had sold almost 40 million units of its 45 VHS and DVD titles by 1998<ref name=\"skein\"/> and generated over $1 billion in product licensing in 2000.<ref name=\"tracy-3\"/> More than ten million ''Blue's Clues'' books were in print by 2001 and over three million copies of six CD-ROM titles based on the show had been sold.<ref name=\"tracy-4\"/> Seven ''Blue's Clues'' titles sold at least 1 million copies each.<ref name=\"skein\"/> The show's first [[direct-to-video]] production was ''[[Blue's Big Musical Movie]]'' (2000), featuring [[Ray Charles]] and [[The Persuasions]]; it received mostly positive reviews<ref name=\"goodall\"/> and has sold over 3 million copies since 2006.<ref name=\"skein\"/> The launch of ''Blue's Clues'' products at [[FAO Schwarz]]'s flagship store in New York City was the most successful product launch in the store's history and was attended by over 7,000 people.<ref name=\"tracy-5\"/> By 2002, ''Blue's Clues'' had received several awards for children's programming, educational software, and licensing<ref name=\"tracy-4\"/> and been nominated for nine [[Emmy Award]]s.<ref name=\"tracy-xi\"/> It also won a [[Peabody Award]] in 2001.<ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/blues-clues 61st Annual Peabody Awards], May 2002.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ray Charles (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Ray Charles]], shown here in 1990, appeared in the popular ''Blue's Clues'' VHS ''Blue's Big Musical Movie''. It was his final film role prior to his death four years later, in 2004.]]\n\nStarting in 1999, a live production of ''Blue's Clues'' toured the U.S. to positive reviews.<ref name=\"tracy-53\"/> Johnson compared the show's audience participation with that of ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]''.<ref name=\"skiddoos\"/> As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances.<ref name=\"tracy-53\"/> The creators of the TV show were involved in all aspects of the live show, aiming to translate the bond between the TV show's audience and its cast to the stage<ref name=\"tracy-55\"/> and to provide young audiences with their first theatrical experience.<ref name=\"skiddoos\"/> The creators chose Jonathan Hochwald as the live show's producer,<ref name=\"tracy-53\"/> Gip Hoppe as its director, and Dave Gallo as its set designer. Neither Hoppe nor Gallo had any previous experience in children's theater.<ref name=\"tracy-54\"/> Nick Balaban and Michael Rubin, who wrote the music for the TV show, composed the live show's soundtrack.<ref name=\"tracy-55\"/> The producers were concerned with children's response to the host, who was played by Tom Mizer (a different actor than the host of the TV show), but his young audience enthusiastically accepted and embraced him.<ref name=\"tracy-56\"/> Actors were encouraged to improvise and respond to the audience, which resulted in changes throughout the show's run. The show's script included humor that both children and their parents could enjoy.<ref name=\"tracy-5657\"/>\n\nRegional versions of the show, featuring native hosts, have been produced in other countries. In the United Kingdom it was hosted by [[Kevin Duala]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/5DTr0qKGWk6Z2wXdr8lyXtD/kevin-duala|title=The One Show - Kevin Duala - BBC One|website=BBC}}</ref> and the Korean version became part of [[popular culture|pop culture]] in [[South Korea]].<ref name=\"tracy-5960\"/> In total, the show was syndicated in 120 countries, and was translated into 15 languages.<ref name=\"schmelzer\"/> In 2000, it became one of the first preschool shows to incorporate [[American Sign Language]] into its content, with between five and ten signs used consistently in each episode.<ref name=\"lee\"/> ''Blue's Clues'' won an award from the Greater Los Angeles Agency on Deafness (GLAD) for promoting deaf awareness in the media.<ref name=\"tracy-58\"/>\n\n==Influence==\nThe show's extensive use of research in its development and production process inspired several studies that provided evidence for its effectiveness as a learning tool. Field tests showed that the attention and comprehension of young viewers increased with each repeat viewing.<ref name=\"gladwell-125126\"/> In 1999, Anderson and a team of researchers, some of which were his colleagues at Nickelodeon, studied how episode repetition affected comprehension, audience participation, and visual attention. The researchers tested whether repeated viewings of the show resulted in mastery over the material presented, or whether viewers would habituate or become bored.<ref name=\"anderson-183\"/> They discovered that audience participation was lower for the first few viewings, because children paid more attention to unfamiliar material, and because it was more cognitively demanding to understand and solve the problems presented. After five viewings, more of the viewers' cognitive resources were available for interaction and participation, so they answered more questions. Episode repetition seemed to empower viewers, as shown in their enthusiastic efforts to solve the problems presented to them.<ref name=\"anderson-184\"/> Repetition, which the researchers called \"an inexpensive tool to maximize comprehension,\"<ref name=\"anderson-192\"/> improved comprehension, held children's attention, and increased audience participation.<ref name=\"media-51\"/> Children were not only tolerant of repetition, they were \"positively enthusiastic\"<ref name=\"anderson-192\"/> about it. [[Nielsen ratings]] of the show's first season, when the same episode was shown daily, were flat over the five-day period, which indicated to Anderson that young children did not tire of its repetition or of its complexity over time.<ref name=\"anderson2-35\"/> Anderson and Crawley felt that the telecast strategy helped increase the show's ratings and called it a success.<ref name=\"effect-636\"/>\n\nIn 2000, another team of researchers, including Anderson, Crawley, and other Nickelodeon colleagues, studied whether experienced ''Blue's Clues'' viewers interacted more with the show than less-frequent viewers and whether regular viewers of the show interacted more with other shows than did children who were not.<ref name=\"anderson184185\"/> They found that when the content of a program was new and challenging, children paid more attention, and when it was familiar, either from previous viewings or in a format they recognized, they instead interacted more. In short, they found that \"interaction in ''Blue's Clues'' to some extent reflects mastery.\"<ref name=\"anderson185186\"/> A similar study, also conducted in 2000 by many of the same researchers, found that experienced ''Blue's Clues'' viewers interacted more with other educational programs than did inexperienced viewers, which proved that watching ''Blue's Clues'' changed the way children watch television.<ref name=\"anderson-186\"/> Researcher Shalom M. Fisch, however, stated that although the show attempted to be \"participatory,\" it could not truly be so, because unlike interactive computer games, the viewers' responses could not change or influence what occurred on-screen.<ref name=\"learning\"/>\n\nJennings Bryant conducted a two-year longitudinal study of the effects of ''Blue's Clues'' at the [[University of Alabama]] in 2001 to ascertain whether or not the show's curriculum goals were achieved. He compared regular viewers and non-viewers and found that the show's episode repetition strategy improved children's comprehension while holding their attention and increasing their participation, which suggested that watching ''Blue's Clues'' increased children's learning and social interactions. At the end of the study, regular viewers outperformed the non-viewers, solving problems more successfully and systematically.<ref name=\"media-46\"/> Anderson stated, \"Given the program's large audience, it appears that the program is not only doing well, but it is also doing good.\"<ref name=\"anderson-192\"/>\n\n[[File:MarleeMatlinMay09.jpg|thumb|right|Actress [[Marlee Matlin]], shown here in 2009, appeared in several ''Blue's Clues'' episodes introducing American Sign Language to its young viewers.]]\n\nIn 2002, Crawley, Anderson, Kiersten Clark, and their colleagues conducted another study on the effects of ''Blue's Clues'', this time researching whether more experienced viewers mastered the content and cognitive challenges faster and easier than first-time viewers. They surmised that experienced viewers would comprehend and interact more with the recurring and familiar segments of the show designed to aid comprehension,<ref name=\"crawley266268\"/> but they found that familiarity with the structure of an individual episode did not provide experienced viewers with an advantage over the inexperienced viewers. Crawley and Anderson also studied whether experienced viewers of ''Blue's Clues'' interacted more with other children's TV shows<ref name=\"crawley-274275\"/> and whether the viewing behaviors they learned from ''Blue's Clues'' could be transferred to other shows.<ref name=\"crawley-278\"/> They found that although experienced viewers of ''Blue's Clues'' interacted with an episode of another series, they did not spend more time watching it than viewers unfamiliar with the show. The researchers stated, \"It is apparent that, although preschoolers learn to enthusiastically engage in overt audience participation, they do not, by and large, have a metacognitive understanding of why they do so.\"<ref name=\"crawley-278\"/> The 2002 studies demonstrated that experience with watching one TV series affects how children watch other programs, especially in the way they interact with them.<ref name=\"crawley-278\"/> They also showed that since children are selective in the material they attend to and that their interaction increases with comprehension and mastery, children tend to pay more attention to novel information and interact more with material they have seen before and mastered. The researchers predicted that since shows like ''Blue's Clues'' help children feel empowered to learn, it could have long-term effects in motivating children to learn and provide them with a lifelong love of learning.<ref name=\"crawley-279\"/>\n\nErin Ryan and her colleagues performed a 2009 study on the effect of the use of American Sign Language (ASL) in ''Blue's Clues'' episodes. They analyzed 16 episodes over two weeks for the content and frequency of the signs used and found a high incidence of ASL usage by various characters, but that it was inconsistent, especially in the connection between English words and their corresponding signs.<ref name=\"ryan-17\"/><ref name=\"ryan-20\"/> The purpose of signed communication and its connection with ASL and the Deaf community was not clearly explained, either. The researchers speculated that hearing children with no previous ASL exposure would be familiarized with ASL and the deaf by these episodes, thus reducing the stigma attached to deafness and hard of hearing individuals. Based on other research about the positive effects of teaching ASL to hearing children, the researchers also speculated that it could lead to an increase of vocabulary skills and IQ, as well as improve interpersonal communication. They surmised that deaf children would feel more included and less isolated and be provided with the opportunity to view positive models of ASL and deaf people.<ref name=\"ryan-17\"/>\n\nGeorgene L. Troseth and her colleagues at [[Vanderbilt University]] studied how toddlers use information gained from prerecorded video and from interactions with a person through closed-circuit video, and found that two-year-olds do not learn as much from prerecorded videos because the videos lack social cues and personal references.<ref name=\"troseth-786\"/> Two-year-olds who viewed a pretaped video with instructions about how to find a toy in an adjoining room by a non-interactive researcher did not use the information, even though they smiled and responded to questions. Troseth speculated that their research had implications for interactive educational shows like ''Blue's Clues'', which although was \"on the right track\"<ref name=\"troseth-796\"/> due to the way in which the host invites interaction with the show's viewers, did not provide children with the social cues to solve real-world problems. Troseth stated that repetition, repeated exposure, and familiarity with the show's host may increase children's ability to learn facts and to use strategies they learn from ''Blue's Clues'' to solve new problems. Her research suggested that ''Blue's Clues'' engaged young children and elicited their active participation because they mimicked social interaction.<ref name=\"troseth-796\"/> A longitudinal study published in 2005 found that early exposure to ''Blue's Clues'' to children between six and thirty months of age was positively linked with vocabulary and expressive language later learned.<ref name=\"media-49\"/>\n\n==2019 reboot==\n{{Main|Blue's Clues & You!}}\nIn March 2018, Nickelodeon announced a reboot of the series, with a new host and 20 new episodes.

Additionally, a study in 1989 reported that Cultivated Australian English speakers were being rated higher than Broad Australian English speakers in intelligence, competence, reliability, honesty, and status.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Introducing Sociolinguistics|last=Mesthrie|first=Rajend|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0748638444|location=Edinburgh|pages=148}}</ref> In comparison, Broad Australian English speakers are rated higher in terms of humorousness and talkativity, similar to what was found in a study in 1975 comparing regional British accents to RP (Received Pronunciation).<ref name=\":0\" /> Cultivated Australian English also has some similarities to [[Received Pronunciation]] and the [[Transatlantic accent]] as well.

Cultivated Australian is spoken by [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Geoffrey Rush]] and was spoken by [[Malcolm Fraser]].\n\n=== Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander English ===\n{{Main|Australian Aboriginal English}}\n\nAustralian Aboriginal English refers to a dialect of Australian English used by a large proportion of Indigenous Australians. It is made up of a range of forms which developed differently in different parts of Australia, and are said to vary along a continuum, from forms close to Standard Australian English to more non-standard forms. There are distinctive features of accent, grammar, words and meanings, as well as language use. The dialect is not to be confused with [[Australian Kriol language]], which is not mutually intelligible with Australian English but in fact a separate language spoken by over 30,000 people. On the [[Torres Strait Islands]], a distinctive dialect known as [[Torres Strait English]], the furthest extent of which is [[Torres Strait Creole]], is spoken.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/ethnocultural-voices |title=ethnocultural voices &#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=29 July 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Ethnocultural varieties ===\n\nThe ethnocultural dialects are diverse accents in Australian English that are spoken by the [[Minority group|minority]] groups, which are of non-English speaking background.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/australian-english |title=Australian English &#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref> A massive immigration from Asia has made a large increase in diversity and the will for people to show their cultural identity within the Australian context.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/australian-english-defined |title=Australian English defined &#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=25 October 2009 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref> These ethnocultural varieties contain features of General Australian English as adopted by the children of immigrants blended with some non-English language features, such as the [[Afro-Asiatic]] and [[Asian languages]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In the 1960s, major cities such as Sydney and Melbourne received large numbers of immigrants from Southern Europe and the Middle East (Italians, Greeks, Lebanese, Maltese, Croats, Jews etc.), the second generation of these immigrants can also have a distinct accent, in a similar situation as the east coast of the United States with descendants of European migrants having the \"Jersey accent\".{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Regional variation==\nAlthough relatively homogeneous, some regional variations in Australian English are notable. The dialects of English spoken in the eastern states, where the majority of the population lives, differ somewhat to that spoken in [[South Australian English|South Australia]] and [[Western Australian English|Western Australia]]. Another notable dialect is [[Torres Strait English]], spoken by the inhabitants of the Torres Strait Islands. Torres Strait English, as distinct from Torres Strait Creole, developed separately to, but has been significantly influenced by, General Australian English.\n\nThe regional varieties of English can be distinguished in terms of vocabulary and phonology. With each local dialect taking words from various sources such as British, Irish and American English as well as local [[Indigenous Australian languages|Aboriginal languages]], it is in vocabulary where regional varieties are most distinct from each other. Regional phonological features may be inherited due to differing settlement patterns or may have developed locally.\n\n===Vocabulary===\nRegional variation in Australia consists primarily of differences in vocabulary rather than tone or accent.\n\nThere are differences in the [[Australian English vocabulary#Beer glasses|names of beer glasses]] from one area to another. In the 2000s, however, the range of glass sizes in actual use has been greatly reduced. In [[New South Wales]], [[wikt:Appendix:Australian English terms for clothing#Swimwear|swimwear]] is known as ''swimmers'' or ''cossie'' and, in Queensland, it is ''togs''. In most other areas,<!--Victoria and South Australia according to \"Australian English\"--> the term ''bathers'' dominates. What is referred to by schoolchildren as a bag in most parts of Australia is known as a \"port\" by some Queenslanders. Further, the processed meat known as \"devon\" on the East Coast is known as \"polony\" on the West Coast, while in Central Australia (South Australia and the Northern Territory), the term \"fritz\" is used.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nMany regional variations are due to Australians' passion for sport and the differences in non-linguistic traditions from one state to another: the word ''football'' refers to the most popular code of football in different States or regions, or even ethnic groups within them. [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorians]] start a game of [[Australian rules football]] with a ''ball up'', Western Australians with a ''bounce down''; [[New South Wales]] people and [[Queensland]]ers start a game of [[rugby league]] football or [[rugby union]] football with a ''kick off'', as do soccer players across Australia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nFrom 2004, the national governing body for Association football, (the [[Football Federation Australia]]), has promoted the use of \"football\" in place of \"soccer\". Several media outlets have adopted this use,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foxsports.news.com.au/football/ |title=Foxsports |publisher=Foxsports.news.com.au |date=7 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/football/ |title=Sydney Morning Herald |newspaper=Smh.com.au |date=23 December 2012}}</ref> while others have stuck with \"soccer\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/sport/ |title=Daily Telegraph |work=News.com.au }}</ref><ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/sport/soccer Herald Sun] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205185547/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/sport/soccer |date=5 December 2006 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/soccer/ The Courier-Mail] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205185248/http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/soccer/ |date=5 December 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=15 |title=West Australian |publisher=Thewest.com.au |access-date=15 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619020913/http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=15 |archive-date=19 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/sport/soccer/ The Advertiser] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202012719/http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/sport/soccer/ |date=2 February 2007 }}</ref> However, use of [[football (word)|the word \"football\"]] to mean either [[Australian rules football|Australian football]] or [[rugby league]], depending on the major code of the state, remains the standard usage in Australia. In all places, the specific name or nickname of the code (\"soccer\", \"league\", \"union\" or \"Aussie rules\") can often be heard used for disambiguation.\n\nThe slang word ''footy'' has been traditionally associated with either Australian rules football (Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania, Northern Territory) or rugby league football (New South Wales, Queensland). Prominent examples in popular culture are ''[[The Footy Show (disambiguation)|The Footy Show]]''s; also FootyTAB, a betting wing of the NSW [[Totalisator Agency Board|TAB]].\n\nFor many Australians, the verb ''barrack'' (or the accompanying noun form ''barracker''), is used to denote following a team or club. Barrack has its origins in British English, although in the UK it now usually means to jeer or denigrate an opposing team or players. The expression \"root (or rooting) for a team\", as used in the United States, is not generally used in Australia (''root'' is slang for [[sexual intercourse]] in Australia).<ref>[http://www.traveller.com.au/its-rooted-aussie-terms-that-foreigners-just-wont-get-38nlc \"It's rooted: Aussie terms that foreigners just won't get\"], Tim Richards, http://www.traveller.com.au</ref>\n\nThere are many regional variations for describing social classes or [[subculture]]s. A ''[[bogan]]'' is also referred to as a ''bevan'' in Queensland. These variations, however, have almost completely been replaced by the term ''bogan''.\n\nDistinctive grammatical patterns also exist such as the use of the interrogative ''eh?'' and the position of the word ''but'' at the end of a sentence in Queensland (\"But I don't like him\" becomes \"I don't like him but\").{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Phonology===\n\n;Variation between {{IPA|/\u0250\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}\nThere exists significant regional variation in terms of the extent to which the [[Phonological history of English short A#Trap.E2.80.93bath split|trap\u2013bath split]] has taken hold particularly before {{IPA|/nd/}} (especially the suffix ''-mand''), {{IPA|/ns/}}, {{IPA|/nt/}}, {{IPA|/nt\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/mpl/}}. In words like ''chance'', ''plant'', ''branch'', ''sample'' and ''demand'', the majority of Australians use {{IPA|/\u00e6\u02d0/}} (as in ''bad''). Some, however, use {{IPA|/\u0250\u02d0/}} (as in ''cart'') in these words, particularly in South Australia, which had a different settlement chronology and type from other parts of the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}. In parts of Victoria and South Australia, ''castle'' rhymes with ''hassle'' rather than ''parcel''.

It is made up of a range of forms which developed differently in different parts of Australia, and are said to vary along a continuum, from forms close to Standard Australian English to more non-standard forms. There are distinctive features of accent, grammar, words and meanings, as well as language use. The dialect is not to be confused with [[Australian Kriol language]], which is not mutually intelligible with Australian English but in fact a separate language spoken by over 30,000 people. On the [[Torres Strait Islands]], a distinctive dialect known as [[Torres Strait English]], the furthest extent of which is [[Torres Strait Creole]], is spoken.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/ethnocultural-voices |title=ethnocultural voices &#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=29 July 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Ethnocultural varieties ===\n\nThe ethnocultural dialects are diverse accents in Australian English that are spoken by the [[Minority group|minority]] groups, which are of non-English speaking background.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/australian-english |title=Australian English &#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref> A massive immigration from Asia has made a large increase in diversity and the will for people to show their cultural identity within the Australian context.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/australian-english-defined |title=Australian English defined &#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=25 October 2009 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref> These ethnocultural varieties contain features of General Australian English as adopted by the children of immigrants blended with some non-English language features, such as the [[Afro-Asiatic]] and [[Asian languages]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In the 1960s, major cities such as Sydney and Melbourne received large numbers of immigrants from Southern Europe and the Middle East (Italians, Greeks, Lebanese, Maltese, Croats, Jews etc.), the second generation of these immigrants can also have a distinct accent, in a similar situation as the east coast of the United States with descendants of European migrants having the \"Jersey accent\".{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Regional variation==\nAlthough relatively homogeneous, some regional variations in Australian English are notable. The dialects of English spoken in the eastern states, where the majority of the population lives, differ somewhat to that spoken in [[South Australian English|South Australia]] and [[Western Australian English|Western Australia]]. Another notable dialect is [[Torres Strait English]], spoken by the inhabitants of the Torres Strait Islands. Torres Strait English, as distinct from Torres Strait Creole, developed separately to, but has been significantly influenced by, General Australian English.\n\nThe regional varieties of English can be distinguished in terms of vocabulary and phonology. With each local dialect taking words from various sources such as British, Irish and American English as well as local [[Indigenous Australian languages|Aboriginal languages]], it is in vocabulary where regional varieties are most distinct from each other. Regional phonological features may be inherited due to differing settlement patterns or may have developed locally.\n\n===Vocabulary===\nRegional variation in Australia consists primarily of differences in vocabulary rather than tone or accent.\n\nThere are differences in the [[Australian English vocabulary#Beer glasses|names of beer glasses]] from one area to another. In the 2000s, however, the range of glass sizes in actual use has been greatly reduced. In [[New South Wales]], [[wikt:Appendix:Australian English terms for clothing#Swimwear|swimwear]] is known as ''swimmers'' or ''cossie'' and, in Queensland, it is ''togs''. In most other areas,<!--Victoria and South Australia according to \"Australian English\"--> the term ''bathers'' dominates. What is referred to by schoolchildren as a bag in most parts of Australia is known as a \"port\" by some Queenslanders. Further, the processed meat known as \"devon\" on the East Coast is known as \"polony\" on the West Coast, while in Central Australia (South Australia and the Northern Territory), the term \"fritz\" is used.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nMany regional variations are due to Australians' passion for sport and the differences in non-linguistic traditions from one state to another: the word ''football'' refers to the most popular code of football in different States or regions, or even ethnic groups within them. [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorians]] start a game of [[Australian rules football]] with a ''ball up'', Western Australians with a ''bounce down''; [[New South Wales]] people and [[Queensland]]ers start a game of [[rugby league]] football or [[rugby union]] football with a ''kick off'', as do soccer players across Australia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nFrom 2004, the national governing body for Association football, (the [[Football Federation Australia]]), has promoted the use of \"football\" in place of \"soccer\". Several media outlets have adopted this use,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foxsports.news.com.au/football/ |title=Foxsports |publisher=Foxsports.news.com.au |date=7 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/football/ |title=Sydney Morning Herald |newspaper=Smh.com.au |date=23 December 2012}}</ref> while others have stuck with \"soccer\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/sport/ |title=Daily Telegraph |work=News.com.au }}</ref><ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/sport/soccer Herald Sun] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205185547/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/sport/soccer |date=5 December 2006 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/soccer/ The Courier-Mail] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205185248/http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/soccer/ |date=5 December 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=15 |title=West Australian |publisher=Thewest.com.au |access-date=15 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619020913/http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=15 |archive-date=19 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/sport/soccer/ The Advertiser] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202012719/http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/sport/soccer/ |date=2 February 2007 }}</ref> However, use of [[football (word)|the word \"football\"]] to mean either [[Australian rules football|Australian football]] or [[rugby league]], depending on the major code of the state, remains the standard usage in Australia. In all places, the specific name or nickname of the code (\"soccer\", \"league\", \"union\" or \"Aussie rules\") can often be heard used for disambiguation.\n\nThe slang word ''footy'' has been traditionally associated with either Australian rules football (Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania, Northern Territory) or rugby league football (New South Wales, Queensland). Prominent examples in popular culture are ''[[The Footy Show (disambiguation)|The Footy Show]]''s; also FootyTAB, a betting wing of the NSW [[Totalisator Agency Board|TAB]].\n\nFor many Australians, the verb ''barrack'' (or the accompanying noun form ''barracker''), is used to denote following a team or club. Barrack has its origins in British English, although in the UK it now usually means to jeer or denigrate an opposing team or players. The expression \"root (or rooting) for a team\", as used in the United States, is not generally used in Australia (''root'' is slang for [[sexual intercourse]] in Australia).<ref>[http://www.traveller.com.au/its-rooted-aussie-terms-that-foreigners-just-wont-get-38nlc \"It's rooted: Aussie terms that foreigners just won't get\"], Tim Richards, http://www.traveller.com.au</ref>\n\nThere are many regional variations for describing social classes or [[subculture]]s. A ''[[bogan]]'' is also referred to as a ''bevan'' in Queensland. These variations, however, have almost completely been replaced by the term ''bogan''.\n\nDistinctive grammatical patterns also exist such as the use of the interrogative ''eh?'' and the position of the word ''but'' at the end of a sentence in Queensland (\"But I don't like him\" becomes \"I don't like him but\").{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Phonology===\n\n;Variation between {{IPA|/\u0250\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}\nThere exists significant regional variation in terms of the extent to which the [[Phonological history of English short A#Trap.E2.80.93bath split|trap\u2013bath split]] has taken hold particularly before {{IPA|/nd/}} (especially the suffix ''-mand''), {{IPA|/ns/}}, {{IPA|/nt/}}, {{IPA|/nt\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/mpl/}}. In words like ''chance'', ''plant'', ''branch'', ''sample'' and ''demand'', the majority of Australians use {{IPA|/\u00e6\u02d0/}} (as in ''bad''). Some, however, use {{IPA|/\u0250\u02d0/}} (as in ''cart'') in these words, particularly in South Australia, which had a different settlement chronology and type from other parts of the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}. In parts of Victoria and South Australia, ''castle'' rhymes with ''hassle'' rather than ''parcel''.

in Australia|Local government areas]] (LGAs) are the main units of local government in Australia. They may be termed cities, shires, councils or other names, and all function similarly. Local Government Areas cover around 90 per cent of the nation. Significant sections of South Australia and New South Wales are unincorporated, that is, have no defined local government, along with the ACT and smaller sections of Northern Territory and Victoria. Brisbane, which covers multiple LGAs, is the only state capital city with a local government area covering a significant portion of its urban area. Other capital cities are serviced by LGAs which cover a much smaller proportion of their total urban areas.\n\nThe following table lists local government areas ranked by order based on the estimated population as sourced from the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] product  ''Regional Population Growth, Australia, 2017-18 (catalog 3218.0)''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"

in Australia|Local government areas]] (LGAs) are the main units of local government in Australia. They may be termed cities, shires, councils or other names, and all function similarly. Local Government Areas cover around 90 per cent of the nation. Significant sections of South Australia and New South Wales are unincorporated, that is, have no defined local government, along with the ACT and smaller sections of Northern Territory and Victoria. Brisbane, which covers multiple LGAs, is the only state capital city with a local government area covering a significant portion of its urban area. Other capital cities are serviced by LGAs which cover a much smaller proportion of their total urban areas.\n\nThe following table lists local government areas ranked by order based on the estimated population as sourced from the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] product  ''Regional Population Growth, Australia, 2017-18 (catalog 3218.0)''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"

The coal-fired [[Congella Power Station]] in [[Durban]] and [[Salt River Power Station]] in Cape Town were the first power stations built by Eskom, both complete in mid-1928.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eskom.co.za/sites/heritage/Pages/Congella-Power-Station.aspx|title=Congella Power Station|website=eskom.co.za|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref>\n\nOne of Eskom's first power plants was a coal-fired 128 MW station in [[Witbank]] completed in 1935 to provide power to the mining industry.  The plant was built and run in partnership with the privately owned [[Victoria Falls and Transvaal Power Company]] which owned a number of other power plants across the country.  Thanks to state support Eskom was able to buy out the Victoria Falls and Transvaal Power Company in 1948 for \u00a314.5 million (roughly equivalent to \u00a32.55 billion in 2017).

Due to its financial situation government appointed Dr. W.J. de Villiers to chair a commission that recommended a number of financial and organisational changes for the company to adopt. This led to the company abandoning its no-profit objective and to raise funds by taking out international loans.

This phenomenon is referred to as \"[[Linking and intrusive R|linking R]]\". Many non-rhotic speakers also insert an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] {{IPA|/r/}} between vowels when the first vowel is one that can occur before syllable-final ''r'' (''drawring'' for ''drawing''). This so-called \"[[Linking and intrusive R|intrusive R]]\" has been stigmatized, but nowadays many speakers of [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP) frequently \"intrude\" an [[epenthetic]] {{IPA|/r/}} at word boundaries, especially where one or both vowels is [[schwa]]; for example ''the idea of it'' becomes ''the idea-r-of it'', ''Australia and New Zealand'' becomes ''Australia-r-and New Zealand'', the formerly well-known [[India Office|''India-r-Office'']] and \"Laura Norder\" (Law and Order). The typical alternative used by RP speakers (and some rhotic speakers as well) is to insert a [[glottal stop]] where an intrusive R would otherwise be placed.<ref>Wells, ''Accents of English'', 1:224-225.</ref><ref>{{citation|last=Gimson|first=Alfred Charles|editor-last=Cruttenden|editor-first=Alan|year=2014|title=Gimson's Pronunciation of English|pages=119\u2013120|publisher=Routledge|edition=8th|isbn=978-1-4441-8309-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2nMAgAAQBAJ\n}}</ref>\n\nFor non-rhotic speakers, what was historically a vowel plus {{IPA|/r/}} is now usually realized as a [[long vowel]]. This is called [[compensatory lengthening]], lengthening that occurs after the elision of a sound. So in RP and many other non-rhotic accents ''card, fern, born'' are pronounced {{IPA|[k\u0251\u02d0d]}}, {{IPA|[f\u025c\u02d0n]}}, {{IPA|[b\u0254\u02d0n]}} or similar (actual pronunciations vary from accent to accent). This length may be retained in phrases, so while ''car'' pronounced in isolation is {{IPA|[k\u0251\u02d0]}}, ''car owner'' is {{IPA|[\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0r\u0259\u028an\u0259]}}. But a final schwa usually remains short, so ''water'' in isolation is {{IPA|[w\u0254\u02d0t\u0259]}}. In RP and similar accents the vowels {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} (or {{IPA|/\u028a/}}), when followed by ''r'', become [[diphthong]]s ending in schwa, so ''near'' is {{IPA|[n\u026a\u0259]}} and ''poor'' is {{IPA|[p\u028a\u0259]}}, though these have other realizations as well, including monophthongal ones; once again, the pronunciations vary from accent to accent. The same happens to [[diphthong]]s followed by R, though these may be considered to end in {{IPA|/\u0259r/}} in rhotic speech, and it is the {{IPA|/\u0259r/}} that reduces to schwa as usual in non-rhotic speech: ''tire'' said in isolation is {{IPA|[ta\u026a\u0259]}} and ''sour'' is {{IPA|[sa\u028a\u0259]}}.<ref>''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''</ref>  For some speakers, some long vowels alternate with a [[diphthong]] ending in schwa, so ''wear'' may be {{IPA|[w\u025b\u0259]}} but ''wearing''  {{IPA|[\u02c8w\u025b\u02d0\u0279\u026a\u014b]}}.\n\nEven General American speakers commonly drop the {{IPA|/r/}} in non-final unstressed syllables when another syllable in the same word also contains {{IPA|/r/}}; this may be referred to as ''R-dissimilation''.

Many varieties of [[Indian English]] are rhotic owing to the underlying [[phonotactics]] of the native [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] and [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] languages<ref name=\"wells\" /> whilst some tend to be non-rhotic. In the case of the Philippines, this may be explained because the [[Philippine English|English]] that is spoken there is heavily influenced by the American dialect. In addition, many East Asians (in Mainland China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan) who have a good command of English generally have rhotic accents because of the influence of [[American English]]. This excludes [[Hong Kong]], whose RP English dialect is a result of its almost 150-year-history as a British Crown colony (later British dependent territory). The lack of consonant /r/ in Cantonese also contributes to the phenomenon (although rhoticity started to exist due to the handover in 1997 and influence by US and East Asian entertainment industry). However, many older (and younger) speakers among South and East Asians speak non-rhotic.\n\nOther Asian regions with non-rhotic English are Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Mehmet|last1=Demirezen|year=2012|title= Which /r/ are you using as an English teacher? rhotic or non-rhotic?|url=https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/277811/1-s2.0-S1877042812X0017X/1-s2.0-S1877042812016710/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEB0aCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIGLPfrckiP6JfY8%2F%2Fe2vzr1MwFPRyGZkn2yAaDs7%2BVAuAiEAl7RsBD22HGiOPAfx91Re2uEydfUT2pygLt7WCw89QaIq0AIIdhACGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDJw1CKFf0EJGm3uuTCqtAjtO2VgEetQnP%2FtEoBjaPqtP44HzjXLKSgwTexfhXpJRN4issG9aLCZJJou3RUivP8EBgd89TL98KnXnK3ljYnRavPHVrStcqKTdmA6K5hC806kkigumNf8D7v391mGbP75e6rFX0HM27wwCQt8sFzR5OguTqBHfG%2BaJRIOSqaMZdsn8UQCCzwjfGdyheIzJ18QDF4Sz2hWBsxHgXHLVqf%2BSpaMifPPsvudGGLDBra31EkpFI40P0er32pIoZVWFMrPLJXrqiRIjuwdzRoNwoKaCDo0fLzz5rA6JqEuZCjbDi5oL4xe2WO6p%2Fp9ljZwJv%2B%2B7p5ooHaeZwQvj6d0rktk%2Bg8EKqzorApQnxL5E%2BreUVtiGtGRRdlX6abz3fAen%2Fksz2VDxJTM%2B%2FvRJs70w8PHd7wU6zwJ3yHV7bRNCy6NT4wTIoxaTfn02PWfTiTGF20p67yqjnaaN52Rn5dsrTiDKoUs8D2C7PJl4wLM5p0lnqQPiYL%2FxhKCrMsDKNL9mOf6N6dWssH0kKJHLTP7TxANyV0DNqBVVuyCFeMxTbY6PQh4JU%2FoXXb2mE40TSh9bz6RVQnqkwWQ4WYnz1dHje%2FKdmUX8SAGoZ8%2FbIvOTuAL%2FNMQ3peuxGItuR9bdcxM4V9lHyocFFfvNAB5D65tnQFUQgjji9aRF14DWYF45L9Yxo5KSImAvW%2FX8v4zUjjmfLFpWgeSv11x%2FyxdiHUIJ5ezNvoqg07fXQatNMlwMjWBKAwFfZkbPplBC4AMD8ZsTDQOCuyMZhsCnjGxBFw6eR%2Fls1rgmfPdRBTJQhobAwLYyVa5bA0DBq6p7ctyHq8EFRiNcNhPbhaDJ9EJj88Py4OF2wQhRIQ%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20191216T133057Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTY7RXQQVVV%2F20191216%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=bbb45797896ef9114665520f1348e5fb7b276910b62cb38400497407cfcd18ba&hash=f0c45400446ad742aa106eef3b931c6a56fbb631e1154a01b58fbe56aa55d78b&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S1877042812016710&tid=spdf-7313d5f7-c9d2-4a04-a6df-b2dc0a1b6cc4&sid=a7c2684792d533422428cee211468d64af78gxrqa|work=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|volume=46|pages=2659\u20132663|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.05.542|ISSN=1877-0428|OCLC=931520939}}</ref> A typical Malaysian's English would be almost totally non-rhotic due to the nonexistence of rhotic endings in both languages of influence, whereas a more educated Malaysian's English may be non-rhotic due to Standard Malaysian English being based on RP ([[Received Pronunciation]]).

Pronunciation and variation in African English accents are largely affected by native African language influences, level of education and exposure to Western influences. The English accents spoken in the coastal areas of West Africa are primarily non-rhotic as are the underlying varieties of Niger-Congo languages spoken in that part of West Africa. Rhoticity may be present in English spoken in areas where rhotic Afro-Asiatic or Nilo Saharan languages are spoken across northern West Africa and in the Nilotic regions of East Africa. More modern trends show an increasing American influence on African English pronunciation particularly among younger urban affluent populations, where the American rhotic 'r' may be over-stressed in informal communication to create a pseudo-Americanised accent. By and large official spoken English used in post colonial African countries is non-rhotic. Standard [[Liberian English]] is also non-rhotic because liquids are lost at the end of words or before consonants.<ref>Brinton, Lauren and Leslie Arnovick. ''The English Language: A Linguistic History''. Oxford University Press: Canada, 2006</ref> South African English is mostly [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]], especially Cultivated dialect based on RP, except for some Broad varieties spoken in the [[Cape Province]] (typically in -''er'' suffixes, as in ''writ'''er'''''). It appears that postvocalic {{IPA|/r/}} is entering the speech of younger people under the influence of [[American English]], and maybe an influence of Scottish dialect brought by Scottish settlers.{{sfnp|Bowerman|2004|p=940}}{{sfnp|Lass|2002|p=121}}\n\n=== Australia ===\nStandard [[Australian English]] is non-rhotic. A degree of rhoticity has been observed in a particular sublect of [[Australian Aboriginal English]] spoken on the coast of [[South Australia]], especially in speakers from the [[Point Pearce]] and [[Raukkan]] settlements. These speakers realise /r/ as [\u0279] in the preconsonantal [[postvocalic]] position \u2013 after a vowel but before another a consonant \u2013 but only within [[word stem|stems]].

This up-gliding variant historically occurred in some non-rhotic dialects of [[American English]] and is particularly associated with the early twentieth-century (but now extinct or moribund) dialects of [[New York City]], [[New Orleans]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]],<ref>{{Harvp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=259}}</ref> likely developing in the prior century. In fact, in speakers born before [[World War I]], this sound apparently predominated throughout [[Older Southern American English|older speech of the Southern United States]], ranging from \"South Carolina to Texas and north to eastern Arkansas and the southern edge of Kentucky.\"<ref>{{harvp|Thomas|2006|p=8}}</ref> This variant happened only before a consonant, so, for example, ''stir'' was never {{IPA|[st\u0259\u026a]}};<ref>{{harvp|Wells|1982|pp=508 ff}}</ref> rather ''stir'' would have been pronounced {{IPA|[st\u025c(r)]}}.\n\n=== Coil\u2013curl merger ===\nIn some cases, particularly in New York City, the {{sc2|NURSE}} sound gliding from a schwa upwards even led to a [[phonemic merger]] of the vowel classes associated with the [[General American]] phonemes {{IPA|/\u0254\u026a/}} as in {{sc2|CHOICE}} with the {{IPA|/\u025cr/}} of {{sc2|NURSE}}; thus, words like ''coil'' and ''curl'', as well as ''voice'' and ''verse'', were homophones. The merged vowel was typically a diphthong {{IPA|[\u0259\u026a]}}, with a mid central starting point, rather than the back rounded starting point of {{IPA|/\u0254\u026a/}} of {{sc2|CHOICE}} in most other accents of English. The merger is responsible for the \"Brooklynese\" stereotypes of ''bird'' sounding like ''boid'' and ''thirty-third'' sounding like ''toity-toid''.

In rhotic dialects, [[spelling pronunciation]] has caused these words to be pronounced rhotically anyway.

(It should, however, be pointed out that this particular term is not used in modern American English. It harkens back to a time when one teacher taught all grades in a rural district and was used to refer to that person in a polite formal way by the community.)\n\n== See also ==\n*[[English-language vowel changes before historic /r/]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin|35em}}\n* {{cite book |title= The Cambridge History of the English Language, Volume VI: English in North America |last= Fisher |first= John Hurt |publisher = Cambridge University Press |year=2001 |editor-last= Algeo |editor-first = John |location= Cambridge | pages = 59\u201385 |chapter= British and American, Continuity and Divergence |quote=| ref = harv | isbn = 0-521-26479-0 |via=| authorlink=John Hurt Fisher }}\n*{{cite journal\n |last=Gick \n |first=Bryan \n |year=1999 \n |title=A gesture-based account of intrusive consonants in English \n |journal=Phonology \n |volume=16 \n |issue=1 \n |pages=29\u201354 \n |url=http://idiom.ucsd.edu/~bakovic/camba_files/phonoloblog/gick-intrusive-consonants-ph99.pdf \n |ref=harv \n |doi=10.1017/s0952675799003693 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412043850/http://idiom.ucsd.edu/~bakovic/camba_files/phonoloblog/gick-intrusive-consonants-ph99.pdf \n |archivedate=2013-04-12 \n}}\n*{{cite book\n|last=Kurath\n|first=H.\n|year=1964\n|title=A Phonology and Prosody of Modern English\n|place=Heidelberg\n|publisher=Carl Winter\n|ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book | title=The Atlas of North American English | last2=Ash | first2=Sharon | last3=Boberg | first3=Charles | publisher=Mouton de Gruyter | year=2006 | isbn=3-11-016746-8| location=Berlin |pages=|quote=|via=|first1=William | last1=Labov | ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book| title=The Cambridge History of the English Language, Volume III: 1476\u20131776 | last=Lass | first=Roger | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-521-26476-6| editor-last=Lass | editor-first=Roger | location=Cambridge | pages=56\u2013186 | chapter=Phonology and Morphology |quote=|ref=harv |via=}}\n* {{Cite web|url=http://www.rehabmed.ualberta.ca/spa/phonology/features.htm|title=Phonological Features of African American Vernacular English (AAVE)|last=Pollock, Bailey, Berni, Fletcher, Hinton, Johnson, Roberts, & Weaver|first=|date=17 March 2001|publisher=|access-date=8 November 2016}}\n* {{cite book | title=Language in the British Isles | last=Trudgill | first=Peter | publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=1984 |isbn=| location=Cambridge |pages=|quote=|via=| authorlink=Peter Trudgill }}\n* {{cite book | title=Accents of English |last=Wells |first=J.

The English actor and linguist [[John Walker (lexicographer)|John Walker]] used the spelling ''ar'' to indicate the long vowel of ''aunt'' in his 1775 rhyming dictionary.<ref name=\"Labov, Ash, and Boberg 2006: 47\"/> In his influential ''Critical Pronouncing Dictionary and Expositor of the English Language'' (1791), Walker reported, with a strong tone of disapproval, that \"... the ''r'' in ''lard'', ''bard'', [...] is pronounced so much in the throat as to be little more than the middle or Italian ''a'', lengthened into ''baa'', ''baad''....\"{{sfnp|Lass|1999|p=115}} Americans returning to England after the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1783 reported surprise at the significant changes in fashionable pronunciation.{{sfnp|Fisher|2001|p=73}}  \n\nBy the early 19th century, the southern British standard was fully transformed into a non-rhotic variety, though it continued to be variable as late as the 1870s.{{sfnp|Lass|1999|p=115}} The extent of rhoticity across England in the mid-19th century is summarized as widespread in the book ''New Zealand English: its Origins and Evolution'':\n:[T]he only areas of England ... for which we have ''no'' evidence of rhoticity in the mid-nineteenth century lie in two separate corridors.

This phenomenon is referred to as \"[[Linking and intrusive R|linking R]]\". Many non-rhotic speakers also insert an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] {{IPA|/r/}} between vowels when the first vowel is one that can occur before syllable-final ''r'' (''drawring'' for ''drawing''). This so-called \"[[Linking and intrusive R|intrusive R]]\" has been stigmatized, but nowadays many speakers of [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP) frequently \"intrude\" an [[epenthetic]] {{IPA|/r/}} at word boundaries, especially where one or both vowels is [[schwa]]; for example ''the idea of it'' becomes ''the idea-r-of it'', ''Australia and New Zealand'' becomes ''Australia-r-and New Zealand'', the formerly well-known [[India Office|''India-r-Office'']] and \"Laura Norder\" (Law and Order). The typical alternative used by RP speakers (and some rhotic speakers as well) is to insert a [[glottal stop]] where an intrusive R would otherwise be placed.<ref>Wells, ''Accents of English'', 1:224-225.</ref><ref>{{citation|last=Gimson|first=Alfred Charles|editor-last=Cruttenden|editor-first=Alan|year=2014|title=Gimson's Pronunciation of English|pages=119\u2013120|publisher=Routledge|edition=8th|isbn=978-1-4441-8309-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2nMAgAAQBAJ\n}}</ref>\n\nFor non-rhotic speakers, what was historically a vowel plus {{IPA|/r/}} is now usually realized as a [[long vowel]]. This is called [[compensatory lengthening]], lengthening that occurs after the elision of a sound. So in RP and many other non-rhotic accents ''card, fern, born'' are pronounced {{IPA|[k\u0251\u02d0d]}}, {{IPA|[f\u025c\u02d0n]}}, {{IPA|[b\u0254\u02d0n]}} or similar (actual pronunciations vary from accent to accent). This length may be retained in phrases, so while ''car'' pronounced in isolation is {{IPA|[k\u0251\u02d0]}}, ''car owner'' is {{IPA|[\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0r\u0259\u028an\u0259]}}. But a final schwa usually remains short, so ''water'' in isolation is {{IPA|[w\u0254\u02d0t\u0259]}}. In RP and similar accents the vowels {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} (or {{IPA|/\u028a/}}), when followed by ''r'', become [[diphthong]]s ending in schwa, so ''near'' is {{IPA|[n\u026a\u0259]}} and ''poor'' is {{IPA|[p\u028a\u0259]}}, though these have other realizations as well, including monophthongal ones; once again, the pronunciations vary from accent to accent. The same happens to [[diphthong]]s followed by R, though these may be considered to end in {{IPA|/\u0259r/}} in rhotic speech, and it is the {{IPA|/\u0259r/}} that reduces to schwa as usual in non-rhotic speech: ''tire'' said in isolation is {{IPA|[ta\u026a\u0259]}} and ''sour'' is {{IPA|[sa\u028a\u0259]}}.<ref>''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''</ref>  For some speakers, some long vowels alternate with a [[diphthong]] ending in schwa, so ''wear'' may be {{IPA|[w\u025b\u0259]}} but ''wearing''  {{IPA|[\u02c8w\u025b\u02d0\u0279\u026a\u014b]}}.\n\nEven General American speakers commonly drop the {{IPA|/r/}} in non-final unstressed syllables when another syllable in the same word also contains {{IPA|/r/}}; this may be referred to as ''R-dissimilation''. Examples include the dropping of the first {{IPA|/r/}} in the words ''surprise'', ''governor'' and ''caterpillar''.

Many varieties of [[Indian English]] are rhotic owing to the underlying [[phonotactics]] of the native [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] and [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] languages<ref name=\"wells\" /> whilst some tend to be non-rhotic. In the case of the Philippines, this may be explained because the [[Philippine English|English]] that is spoken there is heavily influenced by the American dialect. In addition, many East Asians (in Mainland China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan) who have a good command of English generally have rhotic accents because of the influence of [[American English]]. This excludes [[Hong Kong]], whose RP English dialect is a result of its almost 150-year-history as a British Crown colony (later British dependent territory). The lack of consonant /r/ in Cantonese also contributes to the phenomenon (although rhoticity started to exist due to the handover in 1997 and influence by US and East Asian entertainment industry). However, many older (and younger) speakers among South and East Asians speak non-rhotic.\n\nOther Asian regions with non-rhotic English are Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Mehmet|last1=Demirezen|year=2012|title= Which /r/ are you using as an English teacher? rhotic or non-rhotic?|url=https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/277811/1-s2.0-S1877042812X0017X/1-s2.0-S1877042812016710/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEB0aCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIGLPfrckiP6JfY8%2F%2Fe2vzr1MwFPRyGZkn2yAaDs7%2BVAuAiEAl7RsBD22HGiOPAfx91Re2uEydfUT2pygLt7WCw89QaIq0AIIdhACGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDJw1CKFf0EJGm3uuTCqtAjtO2VgEetQnP%2FtEoBjaPqtP44HzjXLKSgwTexfhXpJRN4issG9aLCZJJou3RUivP8EBgd89TL98KnXnK3ljYnRavPHVrStcqKTdmA6K5hC806kkigumNf8D7v391mGbP75e6rFX0HM27wwCQt8sFzR5OguTqBHfG%2BaJRIOSqaMZdsn8UQCCzwjfGdyheIzJ18QDF4Sz2hWBsxHgXHLVqf%2BSpaMifPPsvudGGLDBra31EkpFI40P0er32pIoZVWFMrPLJXrqiRIjuwdzRoNwoKaCDo0fLzz5rA6JqEuZCjbDi5oL4xe2WO6p%2Fp9ljZwJv%2B%2B7p5ooHaeZwQvj6d0rktk%2Bg8EKqzorApQnxL5E%2BreUVtiGtGRRdlX6abz3fAen%2Fksz2VDxJTM%2B%2FvRJs70w8PHd7wU6zwJ3yHV7bRNCy6NT4wTIoxaTfn02PWfTiTGF20p67yqjnaaN52Rn5dsrTiDKoUs8D2C7PJl4wLM5p0lnqQPiYL%2FxhKCrMsDKNL9mOf6N6dWssH0kKJHLTP7TxANyV0DNqBVVuyCFeMxTbY6PQh4JU%2FoXXb2mE40TSh9bz6RVQnqkwWQ4WYnz1dHje%2FKdmUX8SAGoZ8%2FbIvOTuAL%2FNMQ3peuxGItuR9bdcxM4V9lHyocFFfvNAB5D65tnQFUQgjji9aRF14DWYF45L9Yxo5KSImAvW%2FX8v4zUjjmfLFpWgeSv11x%2FyxdiHUIJ5ezNvoqg07fXQatNMlwMjWBKAwFfZkbPplBC4AMD8ZsTDQOCuyMZhsCnjGxBFw6eR%2Fls1rgmfPdRBTJQhobAwLYyVa5bA0DBq6p7ctyHq8EFRiNcNhPbhaDJ9EJj88Py4OF2wQhRIQ%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20191216T133057Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTY7RXQQVVV%2F20191216%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=bbb45797896ef9114665520f1348e5fb7b276910b62cb38400497407cfcd18ba&hash=f0c45400446ad742aa106eef3b931c6a56fbb631e1154a01b58fbe56aa55d78b&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S1877042812016710&tid=spdf-7313d5f7-c9d2-4a04-a6df-b2dc0a1b6cc4&sid=a7c2684792d533422428cee211468d64af78gxrqa|work=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|volume=46|pages=2659\u20132663|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.05.542|ISSN=1877-0428|OCLC=931520939}}</ref> A typical Malaysian's English would be almost totally non-rhotic due to the nonexistence of rhotic endings in both languages of influence, whereas a more educated Malaysian's English may be non-rhotic due to Standard Malaysian English being based on RP ([[Received Pronunciation]]).

But one current change that seems to be taking place is that Brunei English is becoming rhotic, partly influenced by American English and partly influenced by the rhoticity of Standard Malay, also influenced by languages of [[Indians in Brunei]] ([[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]) (rhoticity is also used by [[ethnic Chinese in Brunei|Chinese Bruneians]]), although English in neighboring Malaysia, Singapore, and Australia remains non-rhotic; rhoticity in Brunei English is equal to Philippine and Indian dialects of English and Scottish and Irish dialects.

Pronunciation and variation in African English accents are largely affected by native African language influences, level of education and exposure to Western influences. The English accents spoken in the coastal areas of West Africa are primarily non-rhotic as are the underlying varieties of Niger-Congo languages spoken in that part of West Africa. Rhoticity may be present in English spoken in areas where rhotic Afro-Asiatic or Nilo Saharan languages are spoken across northern West Africa and in the Nilotic regions of East Africa. More modern trends show an increasing American influence on African English pronunciation particularly among younger urban affluent populations, where the American rhotic 'r' may be over-stressed in informal communication to create a pseudo-Americanised accent. By and large official spoken English used in post colonial African countries is non-rhotic. Standard [[Liberian English]] is also non-rhotic because liquids are lost at the end of words or before consonants.<ref>Brinton, Lauren and Leslie Arnovick. ''The English Language: A Linguistic History''. Oxford University Press: Canada, 2006</ref> South African English is mostly [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]], especially Cultivated dialect based on RP, except for some Broad varieties spoken in the [[Cape Province]] (typically in -''er'' suffixes, as in ''writ'''er'''''). It appears that postvocalic {{IPA|/r/}} is entering the speech of younger people under the influence of [[American English]], and maybe an influence of Scottish dialect brought by Scottish settlers.{{sfnp|Bowerman|2004|p=940}}{{sfnp|Lass|2002|p=121}}\n\n=== Australia ===\nStandard [[Australian English]] is non-rhotic. A degree of rhoticity has been observed in a particular sublect of [[Australian Aboriginal English]] spoken on the coast of [[South Australia]], especially in speakers from the [[Point Pearce]] and [[Raukkan]] settlements. These speakers realise /r/ as [\u0279] in the preconsonantal [[postvocalic]] position \u2013 after a vowel but before another a consonant \u2013 but only within [[word stem|stems]].

It has been speculated that this feature may derive from the fact that many of the first settlers in coastal South Australia \u2013 including [[Cornish English|Cornish]] tin-miners, [[Scottish English|Scottish]] missionaries, and [[American English|American]] whalers \u2013 spoke rhotic varieties.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Postvocalic R in an Australian English dialect|first=Peter|last=Sutton|year=1989|volume=9|issue=1|journal=Australian Journal of Linguistics}}</ref>\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nAlthough New Zealand English is predominantly non-rhotic, [[Southland Region|Southland]] and parts of [[Otago]] in the far south of New Zealand's [[South Island]] are rhotic from apparent Scottish influence.<ref>Clark, L., \"[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&objectid=11763319 Southland dialect study to shed light on language evolution],\" ''[[New Zealand Herald]], 9 Dec 2016.

This up-gliding variant historically occurred in some non-rhotic dialects of [[American English]] and is particularly associated with the early twentieth-century (but now extinct or moribund) dialects of [[New York City]], [[New Orleans]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]],<ref>{{Harvp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=259}}</ref> likely developing in the prior century. In fact, in speakers born before [[World War I]], this sound apparently predominated throughout [[Older Southern American English|older speech of the Southern United States]], ranging from \"South Carolina to Texas and north to eastern Arkansas and the southern edge of Kentucky.\"<ref>{{harvp|Thomas|2006|p=8}}</ref> This variant happened only before a consonant, so, for example, ''stir'' was never {{IPA|[st\u0259\u026a]}};<ref>{{harvp|Wells|1982|pp=508 ff}}</ref> rather ''stir'' would have been pronounced {{IPA|[st\u025c(r)]}}.\n\n=== Coil\u2013curl merger ===\nIn some cases, particularly in New York City, the {{sc2|NURSE}} sound gliding from a schwa upwards even led to a [[phonemic merger]] of the vowel classes associated with the [[General American]] phonemes {{IPA|/\u0254\u026a/}} as in {{sc2|CHOICE}} with the {{IPA|/\u025cr/}} of {{sc2|NURSE}}; thus, words like ''coil'' and ''curl'', as well as ''voice'' and ''verse'', were homophones. The merged vowel was typically a diphthong {{IPA|[\u0259\u026a]}}, with a mid central starting point, rather than the back rounded starting point of {{IPA|/\u0254\u026a/}} of {{sc2|CHOICE}} in most other accents of English. The merger is responsible for the \"Brooklynese\" stereotypes of ''bird'' sounding like ''boid'' and ''thirty-third'' sounding like ''toity-toid''. This merger is known for the word ''soitanly'', used often by the [[Three Stooges]] comedian [[Curly Howard]] as a variant of ''certainly'' in comedy [[short subject|shorts]] of the 1930s and 1940s. The songwriter [[Sam M. Lewis]], a native New Yorker, rhymed ''returning'' with ''joining'' in the lyrics of the English-language version of ''[[Gloomy Sunday]]''.

In rhotic dialects, [[spelling pronunciation]] has caused these words to be pronounced rhotically anyway. Examples include:\n* ''Er'', used in non-rhotic dialects to indicate a [[filled pause]], which most rhotic dialects would instead convey with ''uh'' or ''eh''.\n* The game [[Parcheesi]], from Indian [[Pachisi]].\n* British English slang words:\n** ''char'' for ''cha'' from the [[Mandarin Chinese]] pronunciation of {{zh|t=\u8336}} (= \"[[tea]]\" (the drink)){{Citation needed|reason=Please prove that 'char' isn't an adoption of the Gwoyeu Romatzyh spelling 'char' for \u8336 (where '-r' signals a syllable in the second tone the same way the acute accent of Pinyin 'ch\u00e1' does)|date=June 2018}}\n* In [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s books:\n** ''dorg'' instead of ''dawg'' for a [[drawl]]ed pronunciation of ''dog''.\n** Hindu god name [[Kamadeva|Kama]] misspelled as ''[[Karma]]'' (which is a concept in several Asian religions, not a god).\n** [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] {{wikt-lang|hi|\u0915\u093e\u0917\u093c\u091c\u093c}} / {{nq|{{wikt-lang|ur|\u06a9\u0627\u063a\u0630}}}} ''{{transl|ur|IAST|k\u0101ghaz}}'' (\"paper\") spelled as ''kargaz''.\n* The donkey [[Eeyore]] in [[A.A. Milne]]'s stories, whose name comes from the sound that donkeys make, commonly spelled ''hee-haw'' in American English.\n* ''Burma'' and ''Myanmar'' for [[Burmese language|Burmese]] {{IPA|[b\u0259m\u00e0]}} and {{IPA|[mj\u00e0mm\u00e0]}}.\n* Transliteration of Cantonese words and names, such as ''[[char siu]]'' ({{zh|t=\u53c9\u71d2|j=caa\u00b9 siu\u00b9}}) and [[Wong Kar-wai]] ({{zh|t=\u738b\u5bb6\u885e|j=Wong\u2074 Gaa1wai\u2076}})\n* The spelling of ''schoolmarm'' for ''school ma'am'', which Americans pronounce with the rhotic consonant. (It should, however, be pointed out that this particular term is not used in modern American English. It harkens back to a time when one teacher taught all grades in a rural district and was used to refer to that person in a polite formal way by the community.)\n\n== See also ==\n*[[English-language vowel changes before historic /r/]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin|35em}}\n* {{cite book |title= The Cambridge History of the English Language, Volume VI: English in North America |last= Fisher |first= John Hurt |publisher = Cambridge University Press |year=2001 |editor-last= Algeo |editor-first = John |location= Cambridge | pages = 59\u201385 |chapter= British and American, Continuity and Divergence |quote=| ref = harv | isbn = 0-521-26479-0 |via=| authorlink=John Hurt Fisher }}\n*{{cite journal\n |last=Gick \n |first=Bryan \n |year=1999 \n |title=A gesture-based account of intrusive consonants in English \n |journal=Phonology \n |volume=16 \n |issue=1 \n |pages=29\u201354 \n |url=http://idiom.ucsd.edu/~bakovic/camba_files/phonoloblog/gick-intrusive-consonants-ph99.pdf \n |ref=harv \n |doi=10.1017/s0952675799003693 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412043850/http://idiom.ucsd.edu/~bakovic/camba_files/phonoloblog/gick-intrusive-consonants-ph99.pdf \n |archivedate=2013-04-12 \n}}\n*{{cite book\n|last=Kurath\n|first=H.\n|year=1964\n|title=A Phonology and Prosody of Modern English\n|place=Heidelberg\n|publisher=Carl Winter\n|ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book | title=The Atlas of North American English | last2=Ash | first2=Sharon | last3=Boberg | first3=Charles | publisher=Mouton de Gruyter | year=2006 | isbn=3-11-016746-8| location=Berlin |pages=|quote=|via=|first1=William | last1=Labov | ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book| title=The Cambridge History of the English Language, Volume III: 1476\u20131776 | last=Lass | first=Roger | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-521-26476-6| editor-last=Lass | editor-first=Roger | location=Cambridge | pages=56\u2013186 | chapter=Phonology and Morphology |quote=|ref=harv |via=}}\n* {{Cite web|url=http://www.rehabmed.ualberta.ca/spa/phonology/features.htm|title=Phonological Features of African American Vernacular English (AAVE)|last=Pollock, Bailey, Berni, Fletcher, Hinton, Johnson, Roberts, & Weaver|first=|date=17 March 2001|publisher=|access-date=8 November 2016}}\n* {{cite book | title=Language in the British Isles | last=Trudgill | first=Peter | publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=1984 |isbn=| location=Cambridge |pages=|quote=|via=| authorlink=Peter Trudgill }}\n* {{cite book | title=Accents of English |last=Wells |first=J.

Australian Aboriginal English is spoken among Aboriginal people generally, but is especially evident in what are called \"discrete communities\", i.e. ex-government or mission reserves such as the [[Deed of Grant in Trust|DOGIT communities]] in Queensland. Because most Aboriginal Australians live in urban and rural areas with strong social interaction across assumed rural and urban and remote divides, many urban people also use Aboriginal English. <!-- See the extensive research of Diana Eades for information on the impacts of these linguistic communities on the relationship between Indigenous people and Australian institutions such as the legal system. -->\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Auxiliary verbs===\nAboriginal English does not make use of [[auxiliary verb]]s, such as ''to be'' and ''to have'', or [[copula (linguistics)|copulas]] to link things together. For example, the Aboriginal English equivalent of ''\"We are working\"'' would be ''\"We workin'\"''. Linguists do not regard this as \"just dropping words out\", but as a fundamental change to the way in which English is constructed.<ref name=\"NSWBoS-what-is-aboriginal-english-like\">{{cite web |url=http://ab-ed.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/go/aboriginal-english/what-is-aboriginal-english-like |title=What is Aboriginal English like, and how would you recognise it? |publisher=NSW Board of Studies |date=November 7, 2015 |access-date=November 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Pronouns===\nAlthough ''he'' and ''him'' are masculine pronouns in standard English, in Aboriginal English, particularly in northern Australia, it may also be used for females and inanimate objects. The distinction between ''he'' as the [[nominative]] form and ''him'' as the oblique form is not always observed, and ''him'' may be found as the subject of a verb.\n\n===\"Fellow\"===\nIn some forms of Aboriginal English, ''fellow'' (also spelt ''fella'', ''feller'', ''fullah'', ''fulla'', ''balla'' etc.) is used in combination with adjectives or numerals, e.g. ''big fella business'' = \"important business\", ''one-feller girl'' = \"one girl\". This can give it an adverbial meaning, e.g. ''sing out big fella'' = \"call out loudly\". It is also used with pronouns to indicate the plural, e.g. ''me fella'' = \"we\" or \"us\", ''you fella'' = \"you all\".\n\n==Lexicon==\n===''Balanda''===\n''[[List of English words of Malay origin#B|Balanda]]'' is a word used by the [[Yol\u014bu]] people for European people; originally from the [[Makassar]] language, via the [[Malay language|Malay]] \"orang belanda\" ([[Dutch person]]).<ref name=\"walkerzorc1981\">{{cite journal |author1= Walker, Alan |author2=Zorc, R. David |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1981 |title=Austronesian Loanwords in Yolngu-Matha of Northeast Arnhem Land |journal=Aboriginal History |volume=5 |pages=109\u2013134  }}</ref>\n\n===Business===\nMany Aboriginal people use the word ''business'' in a distinct way, to mean ''matters''. Funeral and mourning practices are commonly known as ''Sorry Business''. Financial matters are referred to as ''Money Business'', and the secret-sacred rituals distinct to each sex are referred to as ''Women's Business'' and ''Men's Business''. \"Secret women's business\" was at the centre of the [[Hindmarsh Island Bridge]] controversy.\n\n===Camp===\nMany Aboriginal people refer to their house as their camp, particularly in [[Central Australia]] and the [[Top End]] of the [[Northern Territory]].\n\n===Cheeky===\n\"Cheeky\" may be used to describe a dog or other animal that's likely to bite or attack.\n\n===Dardy===\nDardy, meaning \"cool\", is used amongst South West Australian Aboriginal peoples. This word has also been adopted by non-Indigenous Australian teens, particularly in the skateboarding subculture. Many Australian teens also use the word to describe something worth buying.\n\n===Deadly===\nDeadly is used by many Aboriginal people to mean excellent, or very good, in the same way that ''wicked'' is by many young English speakers. [[Deadly Awards|The Deadlys]] were awards for outstanding achievement by Aboriginal and [[Torres Strait Islander people]].  \n\nThis usage is not exclusive to Aboriginal people.  It is commonly heard in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Gammon===\n[[Victorian era]] English word for ''pretend''. Still used by some Australian Aboriginal people to mean joking generally. Gammoning \u2013 usually pronounced ''Gam'in'''. This word is widely used across the Northern Territory of Australia by both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians and is now gaining usage elsewhere in Australia.\n\nAustralian language expert, Sidney J. Baker, lists \"gammon\" used by \"whitefellas\" as \"falsehood\".\n\n===''Gubbah''===\n''Gubbah'' is a term used by some Aboriginal people to refer to white people. The ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]]'' has it as \"''n. Colloq. (derog.)'' an Aboriginal term for a white man.\" Also, \"''gubba, n. Colloq. (derog.)'' 1. a white man. 2. a peeping tom. [Aboriginal: white demon].\" It is also said to be a shortening of the word \"government man\", which is itself 19th-century slang for \"convict\". Another theory is that it is a contraction of \"Governor\". It has also been suggested the word is the \"diminutive of garbage\".<ref>Wilkes, G.A. ''A Dictionary of Australian Colloquialisms'' (Sydney: Fontana/Collins, 1978, p. 167</ref> It is often used pejoratively and even considered unreasonably rude within urban Aboriginal circles.\n\n===Humbug===\nWhereas [[humbug]] in broader English (see [[Charles Dickens]]'s [[Ebenezer Scrooge|Scrooge]] character) means nonsensical, or unimportant information, humbug in Aboriginal English means to pester with inane or repetitive requests. The [[Warumpi Band]]'s most recent album is entitled ''Too Much Humbug''. In the [[Northern Territory]], humbug is used by both black and white in this latter, Aboriginal way.\nThe most commonly recognised definition of [[humbug]], refers to an Aboriginal person asking a relative for money. Humbugging can become a serious burden where the traditional culture is one of communal ownership and strong obligations between relatives.\n\n===Mob===\nColloquially used to mean a group of Aboriginal people associated with an extended family group, clan group or wider community group, from a particular place or country. It is used to connect and identify the person and where they are from.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadlystory.com/page/tools/aboriginal-cultural-support-planning/cultural-planning---frequently-asked-questions/what-is-the-difference-between-mob-clan-tribe-language-group|title=What is the difference between mob, clan, tribe, language group?|website=Deadly Story|access-date=23 October 2019}}</ref> \"My mob\" means my people, or extended family.\n\nMob is often used to refer to a [[Australian Aboriginal languages|language group]], as in ''that [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]] mob''.\n\nThe term is also found in the name of [[hip-hop]] group, [[The Wilcannia Mob]], from the town of [[Wilcannia]] in [[New South Wales]] .\n\n=== Rubbish===\nWhile \"rubbish\" as an adjective in many dialects of English means wrong, stupid, or useless, in the north of Australia, \"rubbish\" is usually used to describe someone who is too old or too young to be active in the local culture. Another use is meaning something is \"not dangerous\"; for example, non-venomous snakes are all considered to be \"rubbish\", while in contrast, venomous snakes are \"cheeky\". In both cases, \"rubbish\" approximately means \"inert\".\n\n===Yarn===\nEnglish word for a [[shaggy dog story|long story]], often with incredible or unbelievable events. Originally a sailors' expression, \"to spin a yarn\", in reference to stories told while performing mundane tasks such as spinning [[yarn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=yarn|title=Online etymology dictionary}}</ref> In [[Australian English]], and particularly among Aboriginal people, has become a verb, to talk. Often, ''Yarnin''.\n\n===Unna===\nOften conjoined with the word \"deadly\", \"unna\" means \"ain't it?\" This word is used frequently in the 1998 novel ''[[Deadly, Unna?]]'' by [[Phillip Gwynne]].\n\n==Phonology==\n{{IPA notice|section}}\nSutton (1989) documents that some speakers of Aboriginal English in the area around [[Adelaide]] have an uncommon degree of [[Rhoticity in English|rhoticity]], relative to both other AAE speakers and Standard Australian English speakers (which are generally non-rhotic). These speakers realise /r/ as [\u0279] in the preconsonantal [[postvocalic]] position \u2013 after a vowel but before another a consonant \u2013 within [[word stem|stems]]. For example: [bo\u02d0\u0279d] \"board\", [t\u0320\u0283\u025c\u0279t\u0320\u0283] \"church\", [p\u025c\u0279\u03b8] \"Perth\"; but [fl\u00e6\u02d0] \"flour\", [d\u0252kt\u0259] \"doctor\", [j\u026a\u0259z] \"years\". Sutton speculates that this feature may derive from the fact that many of the first settlers in coastal South Australia \u2013 including [[Cornish English|Cornish]] tin-miners, [[Scottish English|Scottish]] missionaries, and [[American English|American]] whalers \u2013 spoke rhotic varieties. Many of his informants grew up in [[Point Pearce]] and [[Point McLeay]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Postvocalic R in an Australian English dialect|first=Peter|last=Sutton|year=1989|volume=9|issue=1|journal=Australian Journal of Linguistics|pages=161\u2013163|doi=10.1080/07268608908599416}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Australia}}\n*[[Australian Aboriginal Pidgin English]]\n*[[Australian English]]\n*[[Australian Aboriginal languages]]\n*[[Australian Kriol language|Kriol]]\n*[[List of English words of Australian Aboriginal origin]]\n*[[Neo-Nyungar]]\n*[[Torres Strait Creole]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n*{{cite book |last=Arthur |first=J.

Linguists do not regard this as \"just dropping words out\", but as a fundamental change to the way in which English is constructed.<ref name=\"NSWBoS-what-is-aboriginal-english-like\">{{cite web |url=http://ab-ed.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/go/aboriginal-english/what-is-aboriginal-english-like |title=What is Aboriginal English like, and how would you recognise it? |publisher=NSW Board of Studies |date=November 7, 2015 |access-date=November 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Pronouns===\nAlthough ''he'' and ''him'' are masculine pronouns in standard English, in Aboriginal English, particularly in northern Australia, it may also be used for females and inanimate objects. The distinction between ''he'' as the [[nominative]] form and ''him'' as the oblique form is not always observed, and ''him'' may be found as the subject of a verb.\n\n===\"Fellow\"===\nIn some forms of Aboriginal English, ''fellow'' (also spelt ''fella'', ''feller'', ''fullah'', ''fulla'', ''balla'' etc.) is used in combination with adjectives or numerals, e.g. ''big fella business'' = \"important business\", ''one-feller girl'' = \"one girl\". This can give it an adverbial meaning, e.g. ''sing out big fella'' = \"call out loudly\". It is also used with pronouns to indicate the plural, e.g. ''me fella'' = \"we\" or \"us\", ''you fella'' = \"you all\".\n\n==Lexicon==\n===''Balanda''===\n''[[List of English words of Malay origin#B|Balanda]]'' is a word used by the [[Yol\u014bu]] people for European people; originally from the [[Makassar]] language, via the [[Malay language|Malay]] \"orang belanda\" ([[Dutch person]]).<ref name=\"walkerzorc1981\">{{cite journal |author1= Walker, Alan |author2=Zorc, R. David |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1981 |title=Austronesian Loanwords in Yolngu-Matha of Northeast Arnhem Land |journal=Aboriginal History |volume=5 |pages=109\u2013134  }}</ref>\n\n===Business===\nMany Aboriginal people use the word ''business'' in a distinct way, to mean ''matters''. Funeral and mourning practices are commonly known as ''Sorry Business''. Financial matters are referred to as ''Money Business'', and the secret-sacred rituals distinct to each sex are referred to as ''Women's Business'' and ''Men's Business''. \"Secret women's business\" was at the centre of the [[Hindmarsh Island Bridge]] controversy.\n\n===Camp===\nMany Aboriginal people refer to their house as their camp, particularly in [[Central Australia]] and the [[Top End]] of the [[Northern Territory]].\n\n===Cheeky===\n\"Cheeky\" may be used to describe a dog or other animal that's likely to bite or attack.\n\n===Dardy===\nDardy, meaning \"cool\", is used amongst South West Australian Aboriginal peoples. This word has also been adopted by non-Indigenous Australian teens, particularly in the skateboarding subculture. Many Australian teens also use the word to describe something worth buying.\n\n===Deadly===\nDeadly is used by many Aboriginal people to mean excellent, or very good, in the same way that ''wicked'' is by many young English speakers. [[Deadly Awards|The Deadlys]] were awards for outstanding achievement by Aboriginal and [[Torres Strait Islander people]].  \n\nThis usage is not exclusive to Aboriginal people.  It is commonly heard in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Gammon===\n[[Victorian era]] English word for ''pretend''. Still used by some Australian Aboriginal people to mean joking generally. Gammoning \u2013 usually pronounced ''Gam'in'''. This word is widely used across the Northern Territory of Australia by both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians and is now gaining usage elsewhere in Australia.\n\nAustralian language expert, Sidney J. Baker, lists \"gammon\" used by \"whitefellas\" as \"falsehood\".\n\n===''Gubbah''===\n''Gubbah'' is a term used by some Aboriginal people to refer to white people. The ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]]'' has it as \"''n. Colloq. (derog.)'' an Aboriginal term for a white man.\" Also, \"''gubba, n. Colloq. (derog.)'' 1. a white man. 2. a peeping tom. [Aboriginal: white demon].\" It is also said to be a shortening of the word \"government man\", which is itself 19th-century slang for \"convict\". Another theory is that it is a contraction of \"Governor\". It has also been suggested the word is the \"diminutive of garbage\".<ref>Wilkes, G.A. ''A Dictionary of Australian Colloquialisms'' (Sydney: Fontana/Collins, 1978, p. 167</ref> It is often used pejoratively and even considered unreasonably rude within urban Aboriginal circles.\n\n===Humbug===\nWhereas [[humbug]] in broader English (see [[Charles Dickens]]'s [[Ebenezer Scrooge|Scrooge]] character) means nonsensical, or unimportant information, humbug in Aboriginal English means to pester with inane or repetitive requests. The [[Warumpi Band]]'s most recent album is entitled ''Too Much Humbug''. In the [[Northern Territory]], humbug is used by both black and white in this latter, Aboriginal way.\nThe most commonly recognised definition of [[humbug]], refers to an Aboriginal person asking a relative for money. Humbugging can become a serious burden where the traditional culture is one of communal ownership and strong obligations between relatives.\n\n===Mob===\nColloquially used to mean a group of Aboriginal people associated with an extended family group, clan group or wider community group, from a particular place or country. It is used to connect and identify the person and where they are from.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadlystory.com/page/tools/aboriginal-cultural-support-planning/cultural-planning---frequently-asked-questions/what-is-the-difference-between-mob-clan-tribe-language-group|title=What is the difference between mob, clan, tribe, language group?|website=Deadly Story|access-date=23 October 2019}}</ref> \"My mob\" means my people, or extended family.\n\nMob is often used to refer to a [[Australian Aboriginal languages|language group]], as in ''that [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]] mob''.\n\nThe term is also found in the name of [[hip-hop]] group, [[The Wilcannia Mob]], from the town of [[Wilcannia]] in [[New South Wales]] .\n\n=== Rubbish===\nWhile \"rubbish\" as an adjective in many dialects of English means wrong, stupid, or useless, in the north of Australia, \"rubbish\" is usually used to describe someone who is too old or too young to be active in the local culture. Another use is meaning something is \"not dangerous\"; for example, non-venomous snakes are all considered to be \"rubbish\", while in contrast, venomous snakes are \"cheeky\". In both cases, \"rubbish\" approximately means \"inert\".\n\n===Yarn===\nEnglish word for a [[shaggy dog story|long story]], often with incredible or unbelievable events. Originally a sailors' expression, \"to spin a yarn\", in reference to stories told while performing mundane tasks such as spinning [[yarn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=yarn|title=Online etymology dictionary}}</ref> In [[Australian English]], and particularly among Aboriginal people, has become a verb, to talk. Often, ''Yarnin''.\n\n===Unna===\nOften conjoined with the word \"deadly\", \"unna\" means \"ain't it?\" This word is used frequently in the 1998 novel ''[[Deadly, Unna?]]'' by [[Phillip Gwynne]].\n\n==Phonology==\n{{IPA notice|section}}\nSutton (1989) documents that some speakers of Aboriginal English in the area around [[Adelaide]] have an uncommon degree of [[Rhoticity in English|rhoticity]], relative to both other AAE speakers and Standard Australian English speakers (which are generally non-rhotic). These speakers realise /r/ as [\u0279] in the preconsonantal [[postvocalic]] position \u2013 after a vowel but before another a consonant \u2013 within [[word stem|stems]]. For example: [bo\u02d0\u0279d] \"board\", [t\u0320\u0283\u025c\u0279t\u0320\u0283] \"church\", [p\u025c\u0279\u03b8] \"Perth\"; but [fl\u00e6\u02d0] \"flour\", [d\u0252kt\u0259] \"doctor\", [j\u026a\u0259z] \"years\". Sutton speculates that this feature may derive from the fact that many of the first settlers in coastal South Australia \u2013 including [[Cornish English|Cornish]] tin-miners, [[Scottish English|Scottish]] missionaries, and [[American English|American]] whalers \u2013 spoke rhotic varieties. Many of his informants grew up in [[Point Pearce]] and [[Point McLeay]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Postvocalic R in an Australian English dialect|first=Peter|last=Sutton|year=1989|volume=9|issue=1|journal=Australian Journal of Linguistics|pages=161\u2013163|doi=10.1080/07268608908599416}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Australia}}\n*[[Australian Aboriginal Pidgin English]]\n*[[Australian English]]\n*[[Australian Aboriginal languages]]\n*[[Australian Kriol language|Kriol]]\n*[[List of English words of Australian Aboriginal origin]]\n*[[Neo-Nyungar]]\n*[[Torres Strait Creole]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n*{{cite book |last=Arthur |first=J.
