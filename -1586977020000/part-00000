In addition to traditional private equity funds, KKR sponsors investment funds that invest in growth equity and core equity. The firm also manages and sponsors investment funds that invest capital in real assets, such as infrastructure, energy and real estate.<ref name=2017Form10K />\n\n===Private Markets===\nKKR has raised 23 private and growth equity funds with approximately $102.9 billion of capital commitments through December 31, 2017. Its private equity investment strategy typically seeks to engage primarily in management buyouts, build-ups, or other investments with a view to acquire a controlling or significant influence. The firm has sourced several smaller growth equity investments and expanded the business by launching dedicated growth equity funds.\n\nKKR's first dedicated growth equity fund, launched in 2016, invests in the technology, media and telecommunications sector, primarily in the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel. In 2016, KKR also launched its second dedicated growth equity fund to pursue investments in the health care sector, also primarily in the United States. As of December 31, 2017, they have received $2.0 billion of capital commitments to these strategies.\n\nIn 2017, they further expanded on their private equity business by making their first core equity investment, targeting investments that have a longer holding period and a lower risk profile.\n\n''Energy''\n\nKKR's energy business aims to deliver current returns to fund investors through distributions generated by producing and selling oil and natural gas reserves and capital appreciation, and targets real asset investments across the upstream and midstream segments of the oil and gas industry. KKR invests in these energy strategies primarily through the KKR Energy Income and Growth Fund. As of December 31, 2017, they have received $2.9 billion of capital commitments to their energy funds and $1.0 billion of capital commitments to this strategy through separately managed accounts.\n\n''Infrastructure''\n\nKKR's infrastructure platform seeks to achieve returns including current income through the acquisition and operational improvement of assets important to the functioning of the economy. The platform has made investments in parking, alternative energy, district heating and contracted electricity generation, water and wastewater, locomotive transportation, midstream and telecommunications infrastructure. As of December 31, 2017, KKR had received $4.1 billion of capital commitments to its infrastructure funds and $1.1 billion of capital commitments to this strategy through separately managed accounts and co-investment vehicles.\n\n''Real Estate''\n{{Infobox company\n| name = KKR Real Estate Finance Trust Inc.\n| traded_as = {{NYSE|KREF}}<br>[[Russell 2000 Index]] component\n}}\nKKR's real estate platform targets real estate equity primarily in the United States and Western Europe. The firm's equity investments include direct investments in real property, debt, special situations transactions and businesses with significant real estate holdings. As of December 31, 2017, KKR has received $3.9 billion of capital commitments through its real estate equity investment funds.\n\nKKR's real estate credit platform provides capital services for complex real estate transactions with a focus on commercial mortgage-backed securities, whole loans and subordinated debt. As of December 31, 2017, KKR managed approximately $2.2 billion of assets in its real estate credit strategy, which include KKR Real Estate Finance Trust Inc. (\"KREF\"), a NYSE-listed real estate investment trust (\"REIT\"), and $1.1 billion of capital commitments through a real estate credit fund.\n\n===Public Markets===\n''Credit''\n\nKKR's credit business invests capital in leveraged credit strategies, including leveraged loans, high-yield bonds, opportunistic credit and revolving credit strategies, and alternative credit strategies, including special situations and private credit strategies such as direct lending and private opportunistic credit (or mezzanine) investment strategies.\n\n''Hedge Funds''\n\nKKR's hedge fund business consists of strategic manager partnerships with third-party hedge fund managers in which KKR owns a minority stake. As of December 31, 2017, the strategic manager partnerships with third-party hedge fund managers accounted for $26.2 billion of AUM.\n\n''BDCs''\n\nIn December 2017, FS Investments and KKR announced they are pooling together more than $18 billion in private capital to invest in mid-sized businesses, in a push to do bigger deals which are out of reach for other alternative lenders.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Franklin |first1=Joshua |title=FS Investments moves lending platform from Blackstone to KKR |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kkr-fs-investments-funds/fs-investments-moves-lending-platform-from-blackstone-to-kkr-idUSKBN1E601O |work=Reuters |date=December 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Capital Markets===\nKKR's capital markets business mainly arranges debt and equity transactions for the firm, its portfolio companies, and third parties.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tan |first1=Gillian |title=KKR: Either a Borrower or Lender Be |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-07-27/kkr-earnings-gain-with-capital-markets-push |publisher=Bloomberg |date=July 27, 2017}}</ref> KKR's capital markets group raised $815 million of debt needed to close the purchase of Mills Fleet Farm in 2016.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Scigliuzzo |first1=Davide |title=KKR reaps reward from going it alone |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/kkr-capital-markets-idUSL1N1BP258 |work=Reuters |date=October 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Principal Activities===\nThe Principal Activities segment uses KKR's balance sheet assets to support its investment management and capital markets businesses.

In addition to traditional private equity funds, KKR sponsors investment funds that invest in growth equity and core equity. The firm also manages and sponsors investment funds that invest capital in real assets, such as infrastructure, energy and real estate.<ref name=2017Form10K />\n\n===Private Markets===\nKKR has raised 23 private and growth equity funds with approximately $102.9 billion of capital commitments through December 31, 2017. Its private equity investment strategy typically seeks to engage primarily in management buyouts, build-ups, or other investments with a view to acquire a controlling or significant influence. The firm has sourced several smaller growth equity investments and expanded the business by launching dedicated growth equity funds.\n\nKKR's first dedicated growth equity fund, launched in 2016, invests in the technology, media and telecommunications sector, primarily in the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel. In 2016, KKR also launched its second dedicated growth equity fund to pursue investments in the health care sector, also primarily in the United States. As of December 31, 2017, they have received $2.0 billion of capital commitments to these strategies.\n\nIn 2017, they further expanded on their private equity business by making their first core equity investment, targeting investments that have a longer holding period and a lower risk profile.\n\n''Energy''\n\nKKR's energy business aims to deliver current returns to fund investors through distributions generated by producing and selling oil and natural gas reserves and capital appreciation, and targets real asset investments across the upstream and midstream segments of the oil and gas industry. KKR invests in these energy strategies primarily through the KKR Energy Income and Growth Fund. As of December 31, 2017, they have received $2.9 billion of capital commitments to their energy funds and $1.0 billion of capital commitments to this strategy through separately managed accounts.\n\n''Infrastructure''\n\nKKR's infrastructure platform seeks to achieve returns including current income through the acquisition and operational improvement of assets important to the functioning of the economy. The platform has made investments in parking, alternative energy, district heating and contracted electricity generation, water and wastewater, locomotive transportation, midstream and telecommunications infrastructure. As of December 31, 2017, KKR had received $4.1 billion of capital commitments to its infrastructure funds and $1.1 billion of capital commitments to this strategy through separately managed accounts and co-investment vehicles.\n\n''Real Estate''\n{{Infobox company\n| name = KKR Real Estate Finance Trust Inc.\n| traded_as = {{NYSE|KREF}}<br>[[Russell 2000 Index]] component\n}}\nKKR's real estate platform targets real estate equity primarily in the United States and Western Europe.

(\"KREF\"), a NYSE-listed real estate investment trust (\"REIT\"), and $1.1 billion of capital commitments through a real estate credit fund.\n\n===Public Markets===\n''Credit''\n\nKKR's credit business invests capital in leveraged credit strategies, including leveraged loans, high-yield bonds, opportunistic credit and revolving credit strategies, and alternative credit strategies, including special situations and private credit strategies such as direct lending and private opportunistic credit (or mezzanine) investment strategies.\n\n''Hedge Funds''\n\nKKR's hedge fund business consists of strategic manager partnerships with third-party hedge fund managers in which KKR owns a minority stake. As of December 31, 2017, the strategic manager partnerships with third-party hedge fund managers accounted for $26.2 billion of AUM.\n\n''BDCs''\n\nIn December 2017, FS Investments and KKR announced they are pooling together more than $18 billion in private capital to invest in mid-sized businesses, in a push to do bigger deals which are out of reach for other alternative lenders.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Franklin |first1=Joshua |title=FS Investments moves lending platform from Blackstone to KKR |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kkr-fs-investments-funds/fs-investments-moves-lending-platform-from-blackstone-to-kkr-idUSKBN1E601O |work=Reuters |date=December 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Capital Markets===\nKKR's capital markets business mainly arranges debt and equity transactions for the firm, its portfolio companies, and third parties.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tan |first1=Gillian |title=KKR: Either a Borrower or Lender Be |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-07-27/kkr-earnings-gain-with-capital-markets-push |publisher=Bloomberg |date=July 27, 2017}}</ref> KKR's capital markets group raised $815 million of debt needed to close the purchase of Mills Fleet Farm in 2016.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Scigliuzzo |first1=Davide |title=KKR reaps reward from going it alone |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/kkr-capital-markets-idUSL1N1BP258 |work=Reuters |date=October 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Principal Activities===\nThe Principal Activities segment uses KKR's balance sheet assets to support its investment management and capital markets businesses.

KKR's partners in the acquisition were [[Silver Lake Partners]], [[Bain Capital]], [[Goldman Sachs Capital Partners]], [[Blackstone Group]], [[Providence Equity Partners]], and [[TPG Capital]]. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of [[RJR Nabisco]] in 1988.
