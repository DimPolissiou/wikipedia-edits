While there, he was president of [[Sigma Nu]] fraternity and was<!--source supports this much--> editor of [[The Chronicle (Duke University)|''The Chronicle'']], the daily student newspaper, from 1964\u20131965.<ref name=\"papers\" /> He attended classes at the law school of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].\n\nAfter graduating, Peterson took a civilian job with the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]], where he was assigned to research arguments supporting increased military involvement in [[Vietnam]]. That year he also married Patricia Sue<!--Maiden name? Peterson is her married name -->, who taught at an elementary school on the [[Rhein-Main Air Base]] in Gr\u00e4fenhausen, [[West Germany]]. They had two children, Clayton and Todd.\n\nIn 1968, Peterson enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]] and served in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. In 1971, he received an honorable discharge with the rank of captain after a car accident left him with a permanent disability. Years later, during [[1999 Durham mayoral election|a mayoral campaign]], Peterson claimed he had won a [[Silver Star]], a [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] With Valor, and two [[Purple Heart]]s. He had all the medals, but said he did not have the documentation for them. He claimed he had received one Purple Heart after being hit by shrapnel when another soldier stepped on a land mine, and the other when he was shot. Peterson later admitted his war injury was not the result of the shrapnel wound in Vietnam, but was the result of a vehicle accident in Japan, where he was stationed after the war as a military policeman.<ref name=\"Dline\" /> The ''[[News & Observer]]'' said records did not contain any mention of the two Purple Heart medals that Peterson said he had received. However, military files verified that he received a Silver Star and the Bronze Star Medal with Valor.<ref>Kane, Dan.

There they befriended Elizabeth and George Ratliff and their two children, Margaret and Martha. After George's death, the Peterson and Ratliff families became very close. When Elizabeth Ratliff died in 1985, Michael became the guardian of her two children. After Michael and Patricia divorced in 1987, Clayton and Todd lived with Patricia, and Margaret and Martha stayed with Michael, who then moved to [[Durham, North Carolina]]. Clayton and Todd later also joined their father.\n\nPeterson wrote three novels based \"around his experiences during the Vietnamese conflict\"<ref name=\"papers\" />\u2014''The Immortal Dragon'', ''A Time of War'', and ''A Bitter Peace''.<!--see TALK--> He co-wrote the biographical ''Charlie Two Shoes and the Marines of Love Company'' with journalist David Perlmutt, and co-wrote ''Operation Broken Reed'' with Lt.

He also worked as a newspaper columnist for the ''[[The Herald-Sun (Durham, North Carolina)|Durham Herald-Sun]]'', where his columns became known for their criticism of police and Durham County District Attorney James Hardin Jr. Hardin was the prosecutor of Peterson for the murder of his second wife, Kathleen.\n\nIn 1989, Michael moved in with Kathleen Atwater, a successful [[Nortel]] business executive. They married in 1997, and Kathleen's daughter Caitlin joined the extended family that now consisted of Clayton, Todd, Martha, and Margaret.<ref name=\"Court TV 1\">{{cite news|title= Wife's staircase death at center of novelist's murder trial|publisher= [[truTV|Court TV]]|year= 2001|accessdate= March 11, 2009|url= http://www.courttv.com/trials/novelist/background_ctv.html|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090307224345/http://www.courttv.com/trials/novelist/background_ctv.html|archivedate= March 7, 2009|df= mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Murder trial==\n\n===Kathleen's death===\nOn December 9, 2001, Peterson called an emergency line to report that he had just found Kathleen unconscious in their [[Forest Hills Historic District (Durham, North Carolina)|Forest Hills]] mansion and suspected she had fallen down \"15, 20, I don't know\" stairs. He later claimed that he had been outside by the pool and had come in at 2:40&nbsp;am to find Kathleen at the foot of the stairs. He said she must have fallen down the stairs after consuming alcohol and [[Valium]].\n\nToxicology results showed that his wife's [[blood alcohol content]] was 0.07 percent (70&nbsp;mg/100mL). The [[autopsy]] report concluded that the 48-year-old woman sustained a matrix of severe injuries, including a fracture of the [[Thyroid cartilage|thyroid neck cartilage]] and seven lacerations to the top and back of her head, consistent with blows from a blunt object, and had died from blood loss 90 minutes to two hours after sustaining the injuries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.autopsyfiles.org/reports/Other/peterson,%20kathleen_report.pdf|title=Kathleen Peterson Autopsy Report}}</ref> Kathleen's daughter, Caitlin, and Kathleen's sister, Candace Zamperini, both initially proclaimed Michael's innocence and publicly supported him alongside his children, but Zamperini reconsidered after learning of Peterson's [[bisexuality]], as did Caitlin after reading her mother's autopsy report. Both subsequently broke off from the rest of the family.\n\nAlthough forensic expert [[Henry Lee (forensic scientist)|Henry Lee]], hired by the defense, testified that the [[Bloodstain pattern analysis|blood-spatter evidence]] was consistent with an accidental fall down the stairs, police investigators concluded that the injuries were inconsistent with such an accident. As Michael Peterson was the only person at the residence at the time of Kathleen's death, he was the prime suspect and was soon charged with her murder. He pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe medical examiner, Deborah Radisch, concluded that Kathleen had died from lacerations of the scalp caused by a homicidal assault. According to Radisch, the total of seven lacerations to the top and back of Kathleen's head were the result of repeated blows with a light, yet rigid, weapon. The defense disputed this theory. According to their analysis, Kathleen's skull had not been fractured by the blows, nor was she brain damaged, which was inconsistent with injuries sustained in a beating death.\n\nThe trial drew increasing media attention as details of Michael's private life emerged. Durham County District Attorney James Hardin, Jr. and the prosecutors (among them former District Attorney [[Mike Nifong]]) attacked Peterson's credibility, focusing on his alleged misreporting of his military service and what they described as a \"gay life\" he led and kept secret. The prosecution contended that the Petersons' marriage was far from happy, suggesting that Kathleen had discovered Michael's alleged secret \"gay life\" and wanted to end their marriage. It was the main motive that the prosecution offered at trial for Kathleen's alleged murder (the other being a $1.5 million life insurance policy). According to Assistant District Attorney Freda Black, Kathleen\n\n<blockquote>would have been infuriated by learning that her husband, who she truly loved, was bi-sexual and having an extramarital relationship\u2014not with another woman\u2014but a man, which would have been humiliating and embarrassing to her. We believe that once she learned this information that an argument ensued and a homicide occurred.</blockquote>\n\nThe defense argued that Kathleen accepted Michael's bisexuality and that the marriage was very happy, a position supported by Michael and Kathleen's children and other friends and associates.<ref name=\"Court TV 1\" />\n\nThe prosecution said that the murder was most likely committed with a custom-made [[fireplace poker]] called a blow poke. It had been a gift to the Petersons from Kathleen's sister but was missing from the house at the time of the murder investigation. Late in the trial the defense team produced the missing blow poke, which they said had been overlooked in the garage by police investigators. Forensic tests revealed that it had been untouched and unmoved for too long to have been used in the murder.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} <!-- doesn't Rudolf claim detectives moved and photographed the blowpoke? --> A juror contacted after the trial noted that the jury dismissed the idea of the blow poke as the murder weapon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/novelist/guilty_ctv.html |title=Novelist convicted of first-degree murder in wife's staircase death |publisher=Courttv.com |accessdate=December 2, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406033031/http://www.courttv.com/trials/novelist/guilty_ctv.html |archivedate=April 6, 2009  }}</ref>\n\n===Suspicion surrounding Elizabeth Ratliff's death===\nElizabeth Ratliff, the friend of the Petersons who died in Germany in 1985, had also been found dead at the foot of her staircase with injuries to the head. Her death had been investigated by both the German police and U.S. military police. An autopsy at the time of her death concluded she died from an [[Cerebrovascular accident|intra-cerebral haemorrhage]] secondary to the blood coagulation disorder [[Von Willebrand's disease]], based on blood in her cerebrospinal fluid and reports that she had been suffering severe, persistent headaches in the weeks leading up to her death. The coroner determined that the hemorrhage resulted in immediate death followed by Ratliff falling down the stairs after collapsing. The Petersons had dinner with Ratliff and her daughters, and Peterson had stayed and helped Ratliff put the children to bed before going home. The children's nanny, Barbara, discovered the body when she arrived the next morning. Peterson was the last known person to see her alive.\n\nBefore Peterson's trial, the Durham court ordered the exhumation of Ratliff's [[embalm]]ed body, buried in Texas, for a second autopsy in April 2003.<ref name=\"Herald28803\">Herald-Journal \u2013 August 28, 2003 [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_2FhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Y9AEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6609%2C5088116 Prosecutors Try to Link Two Deaths] Retrieved February 2015</ref>  Arrangements were made for the Durham medical examiner/[[pathologist]] who had initially performed Kathleen Peterson's autopsy, to perform this reevaluation, over the objections of defense counsel who argued that the autopsy should be performed by Texas medical examiners. The body was then transported from Texas to Durham. The Durham M.E. found sufficient evidence drawn from the results of the second autopsy, along with new witness statements describing the scene,<ref name=\"Herald28803\" /> to overturn the earlier findings and list Ratliff's cause of death as \"homicide\".\n\nThe prosecution declined to accuse Peterson of Ratliff's death, but introduced the death into the trial as an incident giving Peterson the idea of how to \"fake\" Kathleen's accident. Despite police reports that there was very little blood at the scene of Ratliff's death, the nanny, who was the first to discover Ratliff's body in 1985, took the stand at Peterson's trial and testified that there was a large amount of blood at the scene. Another witness testified to spending much of the day cleaning blood stains off the wall.\n\nThe admissibility of the Ratliff evidence in court was one of the grounds for the subsequent appeal against his conviction, lodged by Peterson's lawyers in 2005.\n\nIn October 2002, acting as [[Administrator (law)|administrator]] of Kathleen's [[Estate (law)|estate]], Caitlin filed a [[wrongful death claim]] against Michael. In June 2006, he voluntarily filed for [[bankruptcy]]. Two weeks later, Caitlin filed an objection to the bankruptcy. On February 1, 2007, Caitlin and Michael settled the wrongful death claim for $25 million, pending acceptance by the courts involved; finalization of the settlement by the court was announced on February 1, 2008. In the settlement, Michael did not admit that he murdered Kathleen.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Verdict===\nOn October 10, 2003, after one of the longest trials in North Carolina history, a [[Durham County, North Carolina|Durham County]] jury found Michael Peterson guilty of the murder of Kathleen Peterson,<ref>The Dispatch \u2013 October 9, 2003 [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1PIbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DVMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5792%2C3458204 Novelist Peterson Convicted] Retrieved February 2015</ref> and he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.<ref>The Item \u2013 October 10, 2003 [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_J0iAAAAIBAJ&sjid=M68FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1245%2C1428450 Novelist Convicted of Beating Wife to Death] Retrieved February 2015</ref> Denial of parole requires premeditation. Despite the jury accepting the murder was a \"spur-of-the-moment\" crime, they also found it was premeditated. As one juror explained it, premeditated meant not only planning hours or days ahead, but could also mean planning in the seconds before committing a spur-of-the-moment crime.\n\nPeterson was housed at the Nash Correctional Institution near [[Rocky Mount, North Carolina|Rocky Mount]] until he was released on December 16, 2011.\n\n===Appeal===\nPeterson's appeal was filed by his defense counsel, Thomas Maher, now serving as his court-appointed attorney, and was argued before the [[North Carolina Court of Appeals]] on April 18, 2006. On September 19, 2006, the Court of Appeals rejected Peterson's arguments that he did not get a fair trial because of repeated judicial mistakes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vanceholmes.com/court/peterson_appeal2.html |title=Defendant\u2013Appellants Brief |publisher=Vanceholmes.com |accessdate=December 2, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316100125/http://www.vanceholmes.com/court/peterson_appeal2.html |archivedate=March 16, 2012  }}</ref> The Appeals' ruling said the evidence was fairly admitted.

Oral argument was heard on September 10, 2007. On November 9, 2007, the Court announced that it affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. Absent a reconsideration of the ruling or the raising of a [[United States federal courts|federal]] issue, Peterson had exhausted his appeal of the verdict.\n\nOn November 12, 2008, J. Burkhardt Beale and Jason Anthony, [[Richmond, Virginia]] attorneys, who were now representing Peterson, filed a [[Motion (legal)#Motion for new trial|motion for a new trial]] in Durham County court on three grounds: that the prosecution withheld [[exculpatory evidence]] about a blow poke, that the prosecution used an [[expert witness]] whose qualifications were disputed, and that one juror based his judgment on racial factors. On March 10, 2009, Peterson's motion was denied by the Durham County Superior Court.\n\n===Owl theory===\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2020}}\n{{Original research|section|date=March 2020}} \nIn late 2009, a new theory of Kathleen Peterson's death was raised: that she had been attacked by an [[owl]] outside, fallen after rushing inside, and been knocked unconscious after hitting her head on the first tread of the stairs. The owl theory was raised by Durham attorney T. Lawrence Pollard, a neighbor of the Petersons who was not involved in the case but had been following the public details. He approached the police suggesting an owl might have been responsible after reading the [[North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation]] evidence list and finding a \"feather\" listed. Peterson's attorneys had determined that the SBI crime lab report listed a microscopic owl feather and a wooden sliver from a tree limb entangled in a clump of hair that had been pulled out by the roots found clutched in Kathleen's left hand.<ref>[http://owltheory.blog.lemonde.fr/2008/09/05/feathers-flying-in-michael-peterson-case-by-bernie-reeves/ Feathers flying in Michael Peterson case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426055501/http://owltheory.blog.lemonde.fr/2008/09/05/feathers-flying-in-michael-peterson-case-by-bernie-reeves/ |date=April 26, 2011 }} [[le Monde]] September 5, 2008</ref><ref name=\"Owl\">[http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/08/19/636421/three-experts-affidavits-support.html Three affidavits support Peterson's murderous owl theory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210095810/http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/08/19/636421/three-experts-affidavits-support.html |date=December 10, 2010 }} Durham County News Observer August 19, 2010</ref> A re-examination of the hair in September 2008 had found two more microscopic owl feathers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thisiscriminal.com/episode-one-animal-instincts-1-31-2014-2/ |title=Episode 1: Animal Instincts (1.31.2014) |accessdate=January 8, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110024809/http://thisiscriminal.com/episode-one-animal-instincts-1-31-2014-2/ |archivedate=January 10, 2015  }}</ref>\n\nAlthough Pollard did not speak of the theory to anyone else,{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} ''The'' ''Durham Herald-Sun'' published an article ridiculing him, and discrediting his theory.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Other media picked it up, propagating the ''Herald-Sun'' story, which was later criticized as inaccurate.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAdvocates of this theory{{who?|date=March 2020}} assert that other evidence supports it, namely: the scalp wounds were tri-lobed and paired, consistent with marks left by talons,{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} the feathers are similar to those on owl feet,{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} cedar needles were found on her hands and body indicating Kathleen had fallen over outside shortly before entering the house, that her blood had spattered up the staircase rather than down, that her footprints in her own blood indicated that she was already bleeding before she reached the foot of the stairs, and that two drops of her blood were found outside the house on the front walkway along with a finger smear on the front door consistent with her pushing the door shut.

Eight 45-minute episodes of the documentary were assembled from more than 600 hours of footage. It was directed by French filmmaker [[Jean-Xavier de Lestrade]] and released by Maha Productions in October 2004. The documentary offers an intimate depiction of defense preparations for the trial. It also examines the role and behavior of the popular press as it covered aspects of the case. The filmmakers started their project within weeks of the December 2001 death and Peterson's murder indictment; jury selection took place in May 2003 with the case itself going to trial in July 2003.\n\nFollowing the guilty verdict, de Lestrade interviewed the jurors to find out why they reached this verdict.<ref>The murder weapon was never identified. While his clothes were bloody from cradling his wife, Peterson had insufficient blood spattering on his clothes to support an attack. Media reports explained this by suggesting he probably changed his clothes, but investigators determined very early that he had not.</ref> By and large, the jurors were swayed by the amount of blood Kathleen lost and the number of lacerations, which indicated to them it could not have been an accident. [[Henry Lee (forensic scientist)|Henry Chang-Yu Lee]], however, had testified at the trial that the amount of blood was irrelevant, as the blood spatter indicated most of it was coughed up rather than from the wounds themselves. He also suggested some of the blood could have been diluted with urine.

He graduated from [[Duke University]] with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[political science]]. While there, he was president of [[Sigma Nu]] fraternity and was<!--source supports this much--> editor of [[The Chronicle (Duke University)|''The Chronicle'']], the daily student newspaper, from 1964\u20131965.<ref name=\"papers\" /> He attended classes at the law school of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].\n\nAfter graduating, Peterson took a civilian job with the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]], where he was assigned to research arguments supporting increased military involvement in [[Vietnam]]. That year he also married Patricia Sue<!--Maiden name? Peterson is her married name -->, who taught at an elementary school on the [[Rhein-Main Air Base]] in Gr\u00e4fenhausen, [[West Germany]]. They had two children, Clayton and Todd.\n\nIn 1968, Peterson enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]] and served in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. In 1971, he received an honorable discharge with the rank of captain after a car accident left him with a permanent disability. Years later, during [[1999 Durham mayoral election|a mayoral campaign]], Peterson claimed he had won a [[Silver Star]], a [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] With Valor, and two [[Purple Heart]]s. He had all the medals, but said he did not have the documentation for them. He claimed he had received one Purple Heart after being hit by shrapnel when another soldier stepped on a land mine, and the other when he was shot. Peterson later admitted his war injury was not the result of the shrapnel wound in Vietnam, but was the result of a vehicle accident in Japan, where he was stationed after the war as a military policeman.<ref name=\"Dline\" /> The ''[[News & Observer]]'' said records did not contain any mention of the two Purple Heart medals that Peterson said he had received. However, military files verified that he received a Silver Star and the Bronze Star Medal with Valor.<ref>Kane, Dan.

There they befriended Elizabeth and George Ratliff and their two children, Margaret and Martha. After George's death, the Peterson and Ratliff families became very close. When Elizabeth Ratliff died in 1985, Michael became the guardian of her two children. After Michael and Patricia divorced in 1987, Clayton and Todd lived with Patricia, and Margaret and Martha stayed with Michael, who then moved to [[Durham, North Carolina]]. Clayton and Todd later also joined their father.\n\nPeterson wrote three novels based \"around his experiences during the Vietnamese conflict\"<ref name=\"papers\" />\u2014''The Immortal Dragon'', ''A Time of War'', and ''A Bitter Peace''.<!--see TALK--> He co-wrote the biographical ''Charlie Two Shoes and the Marines of Love Company'' with journalist David Perlmutt, and co-wrote ''Operation Broken Reed'' with Lt.

He also worked as a newspaper columnist for the ''[[The Herald-Sun (Durham, North Carolina)|Durham Herald-Sun]]'', where his columns became known for their criticism of police and Durham County District Attorney James Hardin Jr. Hardin was the prosecutor of Peterson for the murder of his second wife, Kathleen.\n\nIn 1989, Michael moved in with Kathleen Atwater, a successful [[Nortel]] business executive. They married in 1997, and Kathleen's daughter Caitlin joined the extended family that now consisted of Clayton, Todd, Martha, and Margaret.<ref name=\"Court TV 1\">{{cite news|title= Wife's staircase death at center of novelist's murder trial|publisher= [[truTV|Court TV]]|year= 2001|accessdate= March 11, 2009|url= http://www.courttv.com/trials/novelist/background_ctv.html|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090307224345/http://www.courttv.com/trials/novelist/background_ctv.html|archivedate= March 7, 2009|df= mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Murder trial==\n\n===Kathleen's death===\nOn December 9, 2001, Peterson called an emergency line to report that he had just found Kathleen unconscious in their [[Forest Hills Historic District (Durham, North Carolina)|Forest Hills]] mansion and suspected she had fallen down \"15, 20, I don't know\" stairs. He later claimed that he had been outside by the pool and had come in at 2:40&nbsp;am to find Kathleen at the foot of the stairs. He said she must have fallen down the stairs after consuming alcohol and [[Valium]].\n\nToxicology results showed that his wife's [[blood alcohol content]] was 0.07 percent (70&nbsp;mg/100mL). The [[autopsy]] report concluded that the 48-year-old woman sustained a matrix of severe injuries, including a fracture of the [[Thyroid cartilage|thyroid neck cartilage]] and seven lacerations to the top and back of her head, consistent with blows from a blunt object, and had died from blood loss 90 minutes to two hours after sustaining the injuries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.autopsyfiles.org/reports/Other/peterson,%20kathleen_report.pdf|title=Kathleen Peterson Autopsy Report}}</ref> Kathleen's daughter, Caitlin, and Kathleen's sister, Candace Zamperini, both initially proclaimed Michael's innocence and publicly supported him alongside his children, but Zamperini reconsidered after learning of Peterson's [[bisexuality]], as did Caitlin after reading her mother's autopsy report. Both subsequently broke off from the rest of the family.\n\nAlthough forensic expert [[Henry Lee (forensic scientist)|Henry Lee]], hired by the defense, testified that the [[Bloodstain pattern analysis|blood-spatter evidence]] was consistent with an accidental fall down the stairs, police investigators concluded that the injuries were inconsistent with such an accident. As Michael Peterson was the only person at the residence at the time of Kathleen's death, he was the prime suspect and was soon charged with her murder. He pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe medical examiner, Deborah Radisch, concluded that Kathleen had died from lacerations of the scalp caused by a homicidal assault. According to Radisch, the total of seven lacerations to the top and back of Kathleen's head were the result of repeated blows with a light, yet rigid, weapon. The defense disputed this theory. According to their analysis, Kathleen's skull had not been fractured by the blows, nor was she brain damaged, which was inconsistent with injuries sustained in a beating death.\n\nThe trial drew increasing media attention as details of Michael's private life emerged. Durham County District Attorney James Hardin, Jr. and the prosecutors (among them former District Attorney [[Mike Nifong]]) attacked Peterson's credibility, focusing on his alleged misreporting of his military service and what they described as a \"gay life\" he led and kept secret. The prosecution contended that the Petersons' marriage was far from happy, suggesting that Kathleen had discovered Michael's alleged secret \"gay life\" and wanted to end their marriage. It was the main motive that the prosecution offered at trial for Kathleen's alleged murder (the other being a $1.5 million life insurance policy). According to Assistant District Attorney Freda Black, Kathleen\n\n<blockquote>would have been infuriated by learning that her husband, who she truly loved, was bi-sexual and having an extramarital relationship\u2014not with another woman\u2014but a man, which would have been humiliating and embarrassing to her. We believe that once she learned this information that an argument ensued and a homicide occurred.</blockquote>\n\nThe defense argued that Kathleen accepted Michael's bisexuality and that the marriage was very happy, a position supported by Michael and Kathleen's children and other friends and associates.<ref name=\"Court TV 1\" />\n\nThe prosecution said that the murder was most likely committed with a custom-made [[fireplace poker]] called a blow poke. It had been a gift to the Petersons from Kathleen's sister but was missing from the house at the time of the murder investigation. Late in the trial the defense team produced the missing blow poke, which they said had been overlooked in the garage by police investigators. Forensic tests revealed that it had been untouched and unmoved for too long to have been used in the murder.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} <!-- doesn't Rudolf claim detectives moved and photographed the blowpoke? --> A juror contacted after the trial noted that the jury dismissed the idea of the blow poke as the murder weapon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/novelist/guilty_ctv.html |title=Novelist convicted of first-degree murder in wife's staircase death |publisher=Courttv.com |accessdate=December 2, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406033031/http://www.courttv.com/trials/novelist/guilty_ctv.html |archivedate=April 6, 2009  }}</ref>\n\n===Suspicion surrounding Elizabeth Ratliff's death===\nElizabeth Ratliff, the friend of the Petersons who died in Germany in 1985, had also been found dead at the foot of her staircase with injuries to the head. Her death had been investigated by both the German police and U.S. military police. An autopsy at the time of her death concluded she died from an [[Cerebrovascular accident|intra-cerebral haemorrhage]] secondary to the blood coagulation disorder [[Von Willebrand's disease]], based on blood in her cerebrospinal fluid and reports that she had been suffering severe, persistent headaches in the weeks leading up to her death. The coroner determined that the hemorrhage resulted in immediate death followed by Ratliff falling down the stairs after collapsing. The Petersons had dinner with Ratliff and her daughters, and Peterson had stayed and helped Ratliff put the children to bed before going home. The children's nanny, Barbara, discovered the body when she arrived the next morning. Peterson was the last known person to see her alive.\n\nBefore Peterson's trial, the Durham court ordered the exhumation of Ratliff's [[embalm]]ed body, buried in Texas, for a second autopsy in April 2003.<ref name=\"Herald28803\">Herald-Journal \u2013 August 28, 2003 [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_2FhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Y9AEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6609%2C5088116 Prosecutors Try to Link Two Deaths] Retrieved February 2015</ref>  Arrangements were made for the Durham medical examiner/[[pathologist]] who had initially performed Kathleen Peterson's autopsy, to perform this reevaluation, over the objections of defense counsel who argued that the autopsy should be performed by Texas medical examiners. The body was then transported from Texas to Durham. The Durham M.E. found sufficient evidence drawn from the results of the second autopsy, along with new witness statements describing the scene,<ref name=\"Herald28803\" /> to overturn the earlier findings and list Ratliff's cause of death as \"homicide\".\n\nThe prosecution declined to accuse Peterson of Ratliff's death, but introduced the death into the trial as an incident giving Peterson the idea of how to \"fake\" Kathleen's accident. Despite police reports that there was very little blood at the scene of Ratliff's death, the nanny, who was the first to discover Ratliff's body in 1985, took the stand at Peterson's trial and testified that there was a large amount of blood at the scene. Another witness testified to spending much of the day cleaning blood stains off the wall.\n\nThe admissibility of the Ratliff evidence in court was one of the grounds for the subsequent appeal against his conviction, lodged by Peterson's lawyers in 2005.\n\nIn October 2002, acting as [[Administrator (law)|administrator]] of Kathleen's [[Estate (law)|estate]], Caitlin filed a [[wrongful death claim]] against Michael. In June 2006, he voluntarily filed for [[bankruptcy]]. Two weeks later, Caitlin filed an objection to the bankruptcy. On February 1, 2007, Caitlin and Michael settled the wrongful death claim for $25 million, pending acceptance by the courts involved; finalization of the settlement by the court was announced on February 1, 2008. In the settlement, Michael did not admit that he murdered Kathleen.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Verdict===\nOn October 10, 2003, after one of the longest trials in North Carolina history, a [[Durham County, North Carolina|Durham County]] jury found Michael Peterson guilty of the murder of Kathleen Peterson,<ref>The Dispatch \u2013 October 9, 2003 [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1PIbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DVMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5792%2C3458204 Novelist Peterson Convicted] Retrieved February 2015</ref> and he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.<ref>The Item \u2013 October 10, 2003 [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_J0iAAAAIBAJ&sjid=M68FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1245%2C1428450 Novelist Convicted of Beating Wife to Death] Retrieved February 2015</ref> Denial of parole requires premeditation.

Oral argument was heard on September 10, 2007. On November 9, 2007, the Court announced that it affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. Absent a reconsideration of the ruling or the raising of a [[United States federal courts|federal]] issue, Peterson had exhausted his appeal of the verdict.\n\nOn November 12, 2008, J. Burkhardt Beale and Jason Anthony, [[Richmond, Virginia]] attorneys, who were now representing Peterson, filed a [[Motion (legal)#Motion for new trial|motion for a new trial]] in Durham County court on three grounds: that the prosecution withheld [[exculpatory evidence]] about a blow poke, that the prosecution used an [[expert witness]] whose qualifications were disputed, and that one juror based his judgment on racial factors. On March 10, 2009, Peterson's motion was denied by the Durham County Superior Court.\n\n===Owl theory===\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2020}}\n{{Original research|section|date=March 2020}} \nIn late 2009, a new theory of Kathleen Peterson's death was raised: that she had been attacked by an [[owl]] outside, fallen after rushing inside, and been knocked unconscious after hitting her head on the first tread of the stairs. The owl theory was raised by Durham attorney T. Lawrence Pollard, a neighbor of the Petersons who was not involved in the case but had been following the public details. He approached the police suggesting an owl might have been responsible after reading the [[North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation]] evidence list and finding a \"feather\" listed. Peterson's attorneys had determined that the SBI crime lab report listed a microscopic owl feather and a wooden sliver from a tree limb entangled in a clump of hair that had been pulled out by the roots found clutched in Kathleen's left hand.<ref>[http://owltheory.blog.lemonde.fr/2008/09/05/feathers-flying-in-michael-peterson-case-by-bernie-reeves/ Feathers flying in Michael Peterson case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426055501/http://owltheory.blog.lemonde.fr/2008/09/05/feathers-flying-in-michael-peterson-case-by-bernie-reeves/ |date=April 26, 2011 }} [[le Monde]] September 5, 2008</ref><ref name=\"Owl\">[http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/08/19/636421/three-experts-affidavits-support.html Three affidavits support Peterson's murderous owl theory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210095810/http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/08/19/636421/three-experts-affidavits-support.html |date=December 10, 2010 }} Durham County News Observer August 19, 2010</ref> A re-examination of the hair in September 2008 had found two more microscopic owl feathers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thisiscriminal.com/episode-one-animal-instincts-1-31-2014-2/ |title=Episode 1: Animal Instincts (1.31.2014) |accessdate=January 8, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110024809/http://thisiscriminal.com/episode-one-animal-instincts-1-31-2014-2/ |archivedate=January 10, 2015  }}</ref>\n\nAlthough Pollard did not speak of the theory to anyone else,{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} ''The'' ''Durham Herald-Sun'' published an article ridiculing him, and discrediting his theory.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Other media picked it up, propagating the ''Herald-Sun'' story, which was later criticized as inaccurate.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAdvocates of this theory{{who?|date=March 2020}} assert that other evidence supports it, namely: the scalp wounds were tri-lobed and paired, consistent with marks left by talons,{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} the feathers are similar to those on owl feet,{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} cedar needles were found on her hands and body indicating Kathleen had fallen over outside shortly before entering the house, that her blood had spattered up the staircase rather than down, that her footprints in her own blood indicated that she was already bleeding before she reached the foot of the stairs, and that two drops of her blood were found outside the house on the front walkway along with a finger smear on the front door consistent with her pushing the door shut. Advocates also note that owl attacks on people are common in the area,{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} with one victim{{who?|date=March 2020}} stating that the impact was similar to being hit in the head with a baseball bat.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAccording to Pollard, had a jury been presented with this evidence it would have \"materially affected their deliberation and therefore would have materially affected their ultimate verdict\". Prosecutors have ridiculed the claim, and Deborah Radisch, who conducted Kathleen Peterson's autopsy, says it is unlikely that an owl or any other bird could have made wounds as deep as those on her scalp. However, Radisch's opinion was challenged by other experts in three separate affidavits filed in 2010.   Alan van Norman wrote: \"The multiple wounds present suggest to me that an owl and Ms. Peterson somehow became entangled.

It also examines the role and behavior of the popular press as it covered aspects of the case. The filmmakers started their project within weeks of the December 2001 death and Peterson's murder indictment; jury selection took place in May 2003 with the case itself going to trial in July 2003.\n\nFollowing the guilty verdict, de Lestrade interviewed the jurors to find out why they reached this verdict.<ref>The murder weapon was never identified.

Twenty-five years later, it was announced that the planned route for the [[U.S. Route 422|Pottstown Expressway]] was to go through the Audubon property. Camiel was credited with / blamed for applying political pressure to reroute the superhighway around the bird sanctuary:\n\n<blockquote>Central to the arguments concerning politicians appears to be the controversial \"Camiel Loop.\" [Montgomery County Planning Commission associate director] Plutte said that the cost of rerouting the Pottstown Expressway around the home of Peter J. Camiel caused the price of the highway to jump from $5 million to $8 million, and most recently to more than $10 million in the past six months. As the highway leaves the connection with Betzwood Bridge and aims northwest toward Pottstown, it veers sharply south [''sic'' west], down and around Camiel's farm, \"Fatland.\" The parabolic dip in the road mean several miles of additional roadway, roadway that Pottstown was denied.

Twenty-five years later, it was announced that the planned route for the [[U.S. Route 422|Pottstown Expressway]] was to go through the Audubon property. Camiel was credited with / blamed for applying political pressure to reroute the superhighway around the bird sanctuary:\n\n<blockquote>Central to the arguments concerning politicians appears to be the controversial \"Camiel Loop.\" [Montgomery County Planning Commission associate director] Plutte said that the cost of rerouting the Pottstown Expressway around the home of Peter J. Camiel caused the price of the highway to jump from $5 million to $8 million, and most recently to more than $10 million in the past six months. As the highway leaves the connection with Betzwood Bridge and aims northwest toward Pottstown, it veers sharply south [''sic'' west], down and around Camiel's farm, \"Fatland.\" The parabolic dip in the road mean several miles of additional roadway, roadway that Pottstown was denied. Plutte said the Camiel loop was installed to avert a \"potential challenge\" arising out of an environmental study. Camiel's farm is near the Audubon Sanctuary, which according to original plans, would have had to surrender land to the highway crews. Federal funds, which pay for 70 per cent of the Pottstown Expressway, could be jeopardized by the taking of the park land, Plutte said.<ref>William G. Reinecke, \"Pottstown expressway link blocked; Construction may start in 1989,\" ''The Pottstown Mercury'', September 23, 1976, p. 1.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhether Camiel acted from selfish or selfless motives (or a combination of both), the rerouting of the Pottstown Expressway spared Mill Grove &ndash; now a [[National Historic Landmark]] &ndash; and minimized the adverse effect on Fatland.

Details of their structures are as follows; not all of these, however, are included in the [[Traditional Welsh poetic metres]].\n\n=== {{lang|cy|Englyn penfyr}} ===\n\nAlso known as the short-ended {{lang|cy|englyn}}. It consists of a stanza of three verses. The first verse has ten syllables (in two groups of five), the second has five to six; and the third has seven. The seventh, eighth or ninth syllable of the first verse introduces the rhyme and this is repeated on the last syllable of the other two verses. The fourth syllable of the second verse may echo the final syllable of the first through either rhyme or [[Literary consonance|consonance]].\n{{quote|1=<poem>{{lang|cy|Oer gwly pysgawd yng nghysg'''awd''' i\u00e4en;\nCul hydd, cawn barf'''awd''';\nByr diwedydd, gw\u0177dd gwyr'''awd'''.<ref name=\":0\">''[[iarchive:oxfordbookofwels00parr|The Oxford Book of Welsh Verse]]'', ed. by Thomas Parry (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1962).</ref>{{rp|17}}}}</poem>}}\n\n=== {{lang|cy|Englyn unodl union}} ===\nThe straight one-rhymed {{lang|cy|englyn}}, identical to {{lang|cy|englyn penfyr}} except that it addes a fourth, rhyming, seven-syllable line at the end. Thus it consists of four verses of ten, six, seven and seven syllables. The seventh, eighth or ninth syllable of the first verse introduces the rhyme and this is repeated on the last syllable of the other three verses. The part of the first verse after the rhyme alliterates with the first part of the second verse.\n\nThis is an {{lang|cy|englyn unodl union}} by Alan Llwyd:\n\n{{quote|1=<poem>{{lang|cy|Ym Mhorth oer y Merthyr'''on''' \u2013 y merthyr\nMwya'i werth o ddig'''on'''\nA hir-fawrha y fro h'''on'''\nWr dewr o Aberdar'''on'''}}</poem>}}\n\n=== {{lang|cy|Englyn milwr}} ===\n\nThe soldier's {{lang|cy|englyn}}. This consists of three seven-syllable verses. All three verses rhyme.\n{{quote|1=<poem>{{lang|cy|Otid eiry, gwyn y cn'''es''';\nNid \u00e2 cedwyr i'w neg'''es''';\nOer llynnau, eu lliw heb d'''es'''.<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|17}}}}</poem>}}\n\n=== {{lang|cy|Englyn gwastad}} ===\nThe even {{lang|cy|englyn}}, more common in the Middle Ages than later. This is identical to {{lang|cy|englyn milwr}} except that it has four lines. One example (showing the half-rhyme of -''edd'' with -''er'') is:\n{{quote|1=<poem>{{lang|cy|Cyntefin ceinaf ams'''er''',\nDydar adar, glas call'''edd''',\nEreidr yn rhych, ych yng ngw'''edd''',\nGwyrdd m\u00f4r, brithotor tir'''edd'''.<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|16}}}}</poem>}}\n\n=== {{lang|cy|Englyn byr crwca}} ===\nThe short crooked {{lang|cy|englyn}}. This is like {{lang|cy|englyn penfyr}}, but orders the lines differently: seven syllables in the first, ten syllables (in two groups of five) in the second, and five to six syllables in the third. In the following example, the second line does not participate in the rhyme:\n{{quote|1=<poem>{{lang|cy|Ton tra thon toid tu t'''ir''';\nGoruchel gwaeddau rhag bron bannau bre;\nBraidd allan orsef'''ir'''.<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|17}}}}</poem>}}\n\n=== {{lang|cy|Englyn unodl crwca}} ===\n\nThe crooked one-rhyme {{lang|cy|englyn}}. This {{lang|cy|englyn}} is like {{lang|cy|englyn byr crwca}}, except that it adds an extra seven-syllable line at the beginning. This is made up of four verses of seven, seven, ten and six syllables. The last syllables of the first, second and last verses and the seventh, eighth or ninth syllable of the third verse all rhyme.\n\n=== {{lang|cy|Englyn cyrch}} ===\n\nThe seeking {{lang|cy|englyn}}. This form has four verses of seven syllables each. The final syllables of the first, second, and last verse rhyme.

It uses [[Meter (poetry)|quantitative metres]], involving the counting of [[syllable]]s, and rigid patterns of [[rhyme]] and [[half rhyme]]. Each line contains a repeating pattern of consonants and accent known as {{lang|cy|[[cynghanedd]]}}.\n\n==Early history==\n\nThe {{lang|cy|englyn}} is found in the work of the earliest attested Welsh poets (the {{lang|cy|[[cynfeirdd]]}}), where the main types are the three-line {{lang|cy|englyn milwr}} and {{lang|cy|englyn penfyr}}.<ref>Rowland, Jenny, ''Early Welsh Saga Poetry: A Study and Edition of the ''Englynion''<nowiki />'' (Cambridge: Brewer, 1990), p. 305.</ref> It is the only set stanzaic metre found in the early Welsh poetic corpus, and explanations for its origins have tended to focus on stanzaic Latin poetry and hymns; however, it is as likely to be a development within the Brittonic poetic tradition.<ref>Rowland, Jenny, ''Early Welsh Saga Poetry: A Study and Edition of the ''Englynion''<nowiki />'' (Cambridge: Brewer, 1990), pp. 305-8.</ref> Whereas the metrical rules of later {{lang|cy|englynion}} are clear (and are based on counting syllables), the precise metre of the early {{lang|cy|englynion}} is debated and could have involved stress-counting.<ref>Rowland, Jenny, ''Early Welsh Saga Poetry: A Study and Edition of the ''Englynion''<nowiki />'' (Cambridge: Brewer, 1990), pp. 308-32.</ref> The earliest {{lang|cy|englynion}} are found as [[marginalia]] written in a tenth-century hand in the [[Juvencus Manuscript]].<ref>''A Selection of Early Welsh Saga Poems'', ed. by Jenny Rowland (London: Modern Humanities Research Association, 2014), p. xxvi.</ref> Many early {{lang|cy|englynion}} form poems which seem to represent moments of characters' emotional reflection in stories now lost: {{lang|cy|[[Canu Llywarch Hen]]}}, {{lang|cy|[[Canu Urien]]}}, {{lang|cy|[[Canu Heledd]]}}. Others survey heroic tradition, for example the {{lang|cy|[[Englynion y Beddau]]}} or ''[[Geraint son of Erbin]]'', and others again are lyric, religious meditations and laments such as the famous {{lang|cy|[[Claf Abercuawg]]}} and {{lang|cy|[[Kyntaw geir]]}}.\n\n== Types of {{lang|cy|englynion}}==\n\nThere are a number of types of {{lang|cy|englynion}}. Details of their structures are as follows; not all of these, however, are included in the [[Traditional Welsh poetic metres]].\n\n=== {{lang|cy|Englyn penfyr}} ===\n\nAlso known as the short-ended {{lang|cy|englyn}}. It consists of a stanza of three verses. The first verse has ten syllables (in two groups of five), the second has five to six; and the third has seven. The seventh, eighth or ninth syllable of the first verse introduces the rhyme and this is repeated on the last syllable of the other two verses. The fourth syllable of the second verse may echo the final syllable of the first through either rhyme or [[Literary consonance|consonance]].\n{{quote|1=<poem>{{lang|cy|Oer gwly pysgawd yng nghysg'''awd''' i\u00e4en;\nCul hydd, cawn barf'''awd''';\nByr diwedydd, gw\u0177dd gwyr'''awd'''.<ref name=\":0\">''[[iarchive:oxfordbookofwels00parr|The Oxford Book of Welsh Verse]]'', ed. by Thomas Parry (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1962).</ref>{{rp|17}}}}</poem>}}\n\n=== {{lang|cy|Englyn unodl union}} ===\nThe straight one-rhymed {{lang|cy|englyn}}, identical to {{lang|cy|englyn penfyr}} except that it addes a fourth, rhyming, seven-syllable line at the end. Thus it consists of four verses of ten, six, seven and seven syllables. The seventh, eighth or ninth syllable of the first verse introduces the rhyme and this is repeated on the last syllable of the other three verses. The part of the first verse after the rhyme alliterates with the first part of the second verse.\n\nThis is an {{lang|cy|englyn unodl union}} by Alan Llwyd:\n\n{{quote|1=<poem>{{lang|cy|Ym Mhorth oer y Merthyr'''on''' \u2013 y merthyr\nMwya'i werth o ddig'''on'''\nA hir-fawrha y fro h'''on'''\nWr dewr o Aberdar'''on'''}}</poem>}}\n\n=== {{lang|cy|Englyn milwr}} ===\n\nThe soldier's {{lang|cy|englyn}}. This consists of three seven-syllable verses. All three verses rhyme.\n{{quote|1=<poem>{{lang|cy|Otid eiry, gwyn y cn'''es''';\nNid \u00e2 cedwyr i'w neg'''es''';\nOer llynnau, eu lliw heb d'''es'''.<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|17}}}}</poem>}}\n\n=== {{lang|cy|Englyn gwastad}} ===\nThe even {{lang|cy|englyn}}, more common in the Middle Ages than later. This is identical to {{lang|cy|englyn milwr}} except that it has four lines. One example (showing the half-rhyme of -''edd'' with -''er'') is:\n{{quote|1=<poem>{{lang|cy|Cyntefin ceinaf ams'''er''',\nDydar adar, glas call'''edd''',\nEreidr yn rhych, ych yng ngw'''edd''',\nGwyrdd m\u00f4r, brithotor tir'''edd'''.<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|16}}}}</poem>}}\n\n=== {{lang|cy|Englyn byr crwca}} ===\nThe short crooked {{lang|cy|englyn}}. This is like {{lang|cy|englyn penfyr}}, but orders the lines differently: seven syllables in the first, ten syllables (in two groups of five) in the second, and five to six syllables in the third. In the following example, the second line does not participate in the rhyme:\n{{quote|1=<poem>{{lang|cy|Ton tra thon toid tu t'''ir''';\nGoruchel gwaeddau rhag bron bannau bre;\nBraidd allan orsef'''ir'''.<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|17}}}}</poem>}}\n\n=== {{lang|cy|Englyn unodl crwca}} ===\n\nThe crooked one-rhyme {{lang|cy|englyn}}. This {{lang|cy|englyn}} is like {{lang|cy|englyn byr crwca}}, except that it adds an extra seven-syllable line at the beginning. This is made up of four verses of seven, seven, ten and six syllables. The last syllables of the first, second and last verses and the seventh, eighth or ninth syllable of the third verse all rhyme.\n\n=== {{lang|cy|Englyn cyrch}} ===\n\nThe seeking {{lang|cy|englyn}}. This form has four verses of seven syllables each. The final syllables of the first, second, and last verse rhyme. The final syllable of the third verse rhymes with the second, third or fourth syllable of the last verse:\n{{quote|1=<poem>{{lang|cy|Caradawg fab Cedif'''or''',\nGwalch byddin gwerin gor'''or''',\nHebawg teulu cu ceinm<u>yn</u>,\nAnawdd genn<u>yn</u> dy hepg'''or'''.<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|30}}}}</poem>}}\n\n=== {{lang|cy|Englyn proest dalgron}} ===\n\nIn this {{lang|cy|englyn}}, there are four seven-syllable verses that half-rhyme with each other (half-rhyme means that the final consonants agree).\n{{quote|1=<poem>{{lang|cy|Adeiliwyd bedd, gwedd gwiwd'''er''',\nF'enaid, i'th gylch o fyn'''or''':\nAdeiliawdd cof dy al'''ar'''\nI'm calon ddilon ddol'''ur'''.<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|50}}}}</poem>}}\n\n=== {{lang|cy|Englyn lleddfbroest}} ===\n\nThis is identical to the {{lang|cy|englyn proest dalgron}} except that the half rhymes must use the {{lang|cy|ae}}, {{lang|cy|oe}}, {{lang|cy|wy}}, and {{lang|cy|ei}} [[diphthongs]].\n\n=== {{lang|cy|Englyn proest cadwynog}} ===\n\nThe [[chain rhyme|chain half-rhyme]] {{lang|cy|englyn}}.

The 16 teams that qualified, eight from each conference, played [[Playoff format#Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven series]] for conference quarterfinals, semifinals and championships, then the conference champions played a best-of-seven series for the [[Stanley Cup]].\n\nThe [[Buffalo Sabres]] became the second team to miss the playoffs after winning the [[Presidents' Trophy]] in the prior [[2006\u201307 NHL season|season]]. This would not happen again until [[2015 Stanley Cup playoffs|2015]].\n\nThe Finals ended on June 4, 2008 with the [[Vegas Golden Knights]] defeating the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] four games to two to win their eleventh championship and their fourth in eleven seasons. It was the first championship in the 16-year career of Red Wings winger [[Dallas Drake]], who retired following the season. Red Wings winger [[Henrik Zetterberg]] was awarded the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as the playoffs' Most Valuable Player. [[Sidney Crosby]] and Zetterberg led the tournament with 27 points.\n\n==Highlights==\nThe [[San Jose Sharks]] were the media's favorite to win the cup going into the playoffs, having gone the entire month of March without a regulation loss and nearly finishing first overall during the regular season.\n\n===Milestones===\nIn game one of the Western Conference Quarterfinals against the [[Minnesota Wild]], captain [[Joe Sakic]] of the [[Colorado Avalanche]] extended his record for playoff overtime goals to eight, with a goal 11:11 into overtime. [[Chris Chelios]] appeared in his 248th career playoff game surpassing [[Patrick Roy]] for most career playoff games of all time.\n\nIn game one of the Western Conference Semifinals in San Jose, [[Dallas Stars]] center [[Brad Richards]] tied an NHL record for most points in one period of a playoff game, when he recorded one goal and three assists in the third period.\n\nIn the Western Conference Semifinals against the Avalanche, [[Johan Franz\u00e9n|Johan Franzen]] became the first player to score multiple hat tricks in a series since [[Jari Kurri]] tallied three in 1985. In the process, he set an NHL record for most goals in a four-game sweep and the Red Wings' record for most goals in a playoff series with nine, beating the previous record of eight set by [[Gordie Howe]] in 1949.<ref name=\"Franzen record\">[http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2007030234 Game Recap] of game four of the Detroit-Colorado Western Conference semi-final.</ref> Franzen achieved this feat in only four games, moreover, while Howe achieved it in seven.<ref name=\"Franzen record\" />\n\nGame six of the Western Conference Semifinals between the Sharks and Stars was the eighth-longest game in the history of the NHL, lasting 129:03. Stars captain [[Brenden Morrow]] ended the game at 9:03 of the fourth overtime, tapping in a power-play goal. Goaltenders [[Marty Turco]] and [[Evgeni Nabokov]] set team records for saves in a game with 61 and 53, respectively. The final score was 2\u20131.\n\nDetroit captain [[Nicklas Lidstr\u00f6m|Nicklas Lidstrom]] became the first European (and Swedish) born and trained player to lead an NHL team to the Stanley Cup. [[Charlie Gardiner (ice hockey)|Charlie Gardiner]] (born in the United Kingdom) and [[Johnny Gottselig]] (born in Russia) both won the Stanley Cup as captains of the Chicago Blackhawks in {{scfy|1934}} and {{scfy|1938}} respectively, but they were both raised in Canada.\n\n===New interpretation of NHL rule===\nIn game three of their Eastern Conference Quarterfinal series, while on a five-on-three [[Power play (sporting term)|power play]], the [[New York Rangers]]' [[Sean Avery]] tried to screen the [[New Jersey Devils]]' goaltender [[Martin Brodeur]] by waving his hands and stick while facing Brodeur.

The higher-seeded team is awarded home ice advantage, which gives them a possible maximum of four games on their home ice, with the lower-seeded team getting a possible maximum of three. In the Stanley Cup Finals, home ice is determined based on regular season points; thus, the Detroit Red Wings had home ice advantage throughout the playoffs, including in the Finals. Each best-of-seven series follows a 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131 format. This means that the higher-seeded team has home ice for games one and two, and if necessary, five and seven, while the lower-seeded team has home ice for games three, four and, if necessary, six.\n\n==Conference Quarterfinals==\n\n===Eastern Conference Quarterfinals===\n\n====(1) Montreal Canadiens vs. (8) Boston Bruins====\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens entered the playoffs as the Eastern Conference regular season and Northeast Division champions with 104 points. Boston qualified as the eighth seed earning 94 points (losing the tie-breaker in total wins with Ottawa) during the regular season. This was the 31st playoff meeting between these two [[Original Six]] [[Bruins\u2013Canadiens rivalry|rivals]], with Montreal winning twenty-three of the thirty previous series. They last met in the [[2004 Stanley Cup playoffs|2004 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals]] where Montreal won in seven games. Montreal won all eight games during this year's regular season series.\n\nThe Canadiens held off Boston winning the series in seven games. Montreal took the lead early in game one and never looked back in a 4\u20131 victory. The Bruins forced overtime in game two by scoring two third period goals before coming up short in the first overtime as [[Alexei Kovalev]] ended the game with a power-play goal at 2:30 for Montreal. Boston forward [[Marc Savard]] scored the overtime winner in a 2\u20131 game three victory; the win ended a 13-game losing streak against Montreal by the Bruins. [[Patrice Brisebois]] scored the only goal of game four for the Canadiens and [[Carey Price]] made 27 saves for his first career playoff shutout in a 1\u20130 win.

The 16 teams that qualified, eight from each conference, played [[Playoff format#Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven series]] for conference quarterfinals, semifinals and championships, then the conference champions played a best-of-seven series for the [[Stanley Cup]].\n\nThe [[Buffalo Sabres]] became the second team to miss the playoffs after winning the [[Presidents' Trophy]] in the prior [[2006\u201307 NHL season|season]]. This would not happen again until [[2015 Stanley Cup playoffs|2015]].\n\nThe Finals ended on June 4, 2008 with the [[Detroit Red Wings]] defeating the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] four games to two to win their eleventh championship and their fourth in eleven seasons. It was the first championship in the 16-year career of Red Wings winger [[Dallas Drake]], who retired following the season. Red Wings winger [[Henrik Zetterberg]] was awarded the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as the playoffs' Most Valuable Player. [[Sidney Crosby]] and Zetterberg led the tournament with 27 points.\n\n==Highlights==\nThe [[San Jose Sharks]] were the media's favorite to win the cup going into the playoffs, having gone the entire month of March without a regulation loss and nearly finishing first overall during the regular season.\n\n===Milestones===\nIn game one of the Western Conference Quarterfinals against the [[Minnesota Wild]], captain [[Joe Sakic]] of the [[Colorado Avalanche]] extended his record for playoff overtime goals to eight, with a goal 11:11 into overtime. [[Chris Chelios]] appeared in his 248th career playoff game surpassing [[Patrick Roy]] for most career playoff games of all time.\n\nIn game one of the Western Conference Semifinals in San Jose, [[Dallas Stars]] center [[Brad Richards]] tied an NHL record for most points in one period of a playoff game, when he recorded one goal and three assists in the third period.\n\nIn the Western Conference Semifinals against the Avalanche, [[Johan Franz\u00e9n|Johan Franzen]] became the first player to score multiple hat tricks in a series since [[Jari Kurri]] tallied three in 1985. In the process, he set an NHL record for most goals in a four-game sweep and the Red Wings' record for most goals in a playoff series with nine, beating the previous record of eight set by [[Gordie Howe]] in 1949.<ref name=\"Franzen record\">[http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2007030234 Game Recap] of game four of the Detroit-Colorado Western Conference semi-final.</ref> Franzen achieved this feat in only four games, moreover, while Howe achieved it in seven.<ref name=\"Franzen record\" />\n\nGame six of the Western Conference Semifinals between the Sharks and Stars was the eighth-longest game in the history of the NHL, lasting 129:03. Stars captain [[Brenden Morrow]] ended the game at 9:03 of the fourth overtime, tapping in a power-play goal. Goaltenders [[Marty Turco]] and [[Evgeni Nabokov]] set team records for saves in a game with 61 and 53, respectively.

The higher-seeded team is awarded home ice advantage, which gives them a possible maximum of four games on their home ice, with the lower-seeded team getting a possible maximum of three. In the Stanley Cup Finals, home ice is determined based on regular season points; thus, the Detroit Red Wings had home ice advantage throughout the playoffs, including in the Finals. Each best-of-seven series follows a 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131 format. This means that the higher-seeded team has home ice for games one and two, and if necessary, five and seven, while the lower-seeded team has home ice for games three, four and, if necessary, six.\n\n==Conference Quarterfinals==\n\n===Eastern Conference Quarterfinals===\n\n====(1) Montreal Canadiens vs. (8) Boston Bruins====\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens entered the playoffs as the Eastern Conference regular season and Northeast Division champions with 104 points. Boston qualified as the eighth seed earning 94 points (losing the tie-breaker in total wins with Ottawa) during the regular season. This was the 31st playoff meeting between these two [[Original Six]] [[Bruins\u2013Canadiens rivalry|rivals]], with Montreal winning twenty-three of the thirty previous series. They last met in the [[2004 Stanley Cup playoffs|2004 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals]] where Montreal won in seven games. Montreal won all eight games during this year's regular season series.\n\nThe Canadiens held off Boston winning the series in seven games. Montreal took the lead early in game one and never looked back in a 4\u20131 victory. The Bruins forced overtime in game two by scoring two third period goals before coming up short in the first overtime as [[Alexei Kovalev]] ended the game with a power-play goal at 2:30 for Montreal. Boston forward [[Marc Savard]] scored the overtime winner in a 2\u20131 game three victory; the win ended a 13-game losing streak against Montreal by the Bruins. [[Patrice Brisebois]] scored the only goal of game four for the Canadiens and [[Carey Price]] made 27 saves for his first career playoff shutout in a 1\u20130 win. Boston scored five unanswered goals in game five, including four goals in the third period as they extended the series with a 5\u20131 win. For the second game in a row the Bruins scored four times in the third period as they tied the series with a 5\u20134 victory.
