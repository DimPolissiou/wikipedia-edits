He talks his daughter's fianc\u00e9e, Tom Garrett (Dana Andrews), into participating in a hoax, in an attempt to expose the ineptitude of the city's hard-line district attorney. The plan is for Tom to plant clues that will lead to his arrest for the murder of a female nightclub dancer, Patty Gray. Once Tom is found guilty, Spencer is to reveal the setup and humiliate the District Attorney.\n\nTom agrees to the plan, but unforeseen events put a snag in the scheme: Spencer dies in a car accident before he can testify, and photographic evidence intended to clear Tom at his trial is burned to an unrecognizable state. Tom is found guilty and placed on death row in prison. In time to prove the two men's intentions, written testimony by the dead man is discovered.  Because of this, Tom is to be pardoned. \n\nHowever, while talking to his fianc\u00e9e Susan (Joan Fontaine), Tom slips, revealing he knows the late woman's real name; this leads him to confess.  Patty Gray the murder victim, is actually Emma Blucher, Tom Garrett's estranged wife, who had reneged on her promise to divorce him in Mexico. As this was preventing Garrett from marrying Susan, he murdered Emma. Garrett's pardon is canceled before the [[Double jeopardy#United States|double jeopardy]] rule comes into effect, and the film closes with him being led back to his cell.  We are given to assume that his execution goes ahead as scheduled.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dana Andrews]] as Tom Garrett\n* [[Joan Fontaine]] as Susan Spencer \n* [[Sidney Blackmer]] as Austin Spencer \n* [[Shepperd Strudwick]] as Jonathan Wilson\n* [[Arthur Franz]] as Bob Hale \n* [[Philip Bourneuf]] as DA Roy Thompson\n* [[Edward Binns]] as Lt.

{"title_page": "List of 1980s American television episodes with LGBT themes", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2015}}\nWith the onset of the [[AIDS]] epidemic, '''American television episodes with LGBT themes''' sometimes featured LGBT characters, especially gay men, as a way for series to address the epidemic. Legal dramas like ''[[L.A. Law]]'' and ''[[Law & Order]]'' included [[euthanasia]] storylines centered on the deaths of gay men with AIDS. Sitcoms would occasionally broach the subject, but for the most part followed the pattern that had developed during the 1970s, with episodes following one of a handful of plot devices: a character close to a lead character would unexpectedly come out, forcing the characters to confront their own issues with homosexuality; a lead character is mistaken for gay; a lead character pretends to be gay; or, less frequently, a recurring character from the series comes out. In the first instance, it was rare that the gay character would ever make another appearance.<ref>Tropiano, p. 191, 212, 224</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margins:auto; width=95%;\"\n!width=\"30\"|Year\n!width=\"190\"|Series\n!width=\"50\"|Network\n!width=\"230\"|Episode\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Synopsis\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| align=center|1980\n| ''[[Lou Grant]]''\n| [[CBS]]\n| \"Cover-Up\"\n| A teacher ([[Andrew Rubin]])) at a private school is falsely accused of sexual misconduct with a male student.

Legal dramas like ''[[L.A. Law]]'' and ''[[Law & Order]]'' included [[euthanasia]] storylines centered on the deaths of gay men with AIDS. Sitcoms would occasionally broach the subject, but for the most part followed the pattern that had developed during the 1970s, with episodes following one of a handful of plot devices: a character close to a lead character would unexpectedly come out, forcing the characters to confront their own issues with homosexuality; a lead character is mistaken for gay; a lead character pretends to be gay; or, less frequently, a recurring character from the series comes out. In the first instance, it was rare that the gay character would ever make another appearance.<ref>Tropiano, p. 191, 212, 224</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margins:auto; width=95%;\"\n!width=\"30\"|Year\n!width=\"190\"|Series\n!width=\"50\"|Network\n!width=\"230\"|Episode\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Synopsis\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| align=center|1980\n| ''[[Lou Grant]]''\n| [[CBS]]\n| \"Cover-Up\"\n| A teacher ([[Andrew Rubin]])) at a private school is falsely accused of sexual misconduct with a male student.

Bioregions, by contrast are human regions, informed by nature but with a social and political element. In this way bioregionalism is simply [[political localism]] with an ecological foundation.\n\n==Overview==\nThe term was coined by Allen Van Newkirk, founder of the Institute for Bioregional Research, in 1975,<ref>{{Cite book |last=McGinnis |first=Michael Vincent |title=Bioregionalism |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |isbn=041515444-8 |location=London and New York |page=22}}</ref> given currency by [[Peter Berg (bioregionalist)|Peter Berg]] and [[Raymond Dasmann]] in the early 1970s,<ref>Berg, Peter and Raymond Dasmann, \"Reinhabiting California,\" ''The Ecologist'' 7, no. 10 (1977)</ref> and has been advocated by writers such as David Haenke<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mongillo |first=John F. |url=https://books.google.com/?id=n42Rf_ibaMcC&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=david+haenke#v=onepage |title=Environmental Activists |last2=Booth |first2=Bibi |year=2001 |isbn=9780313308840}}</ref> and [[Kirkpatrick Sale]].<ref>Anderson, Walter Truett.

This perspective seeks to:\n*Ensure that political boundaries match ecological boundaries.<ref>Davidson, S.

''Shield Country: The Life and Times of the Oldest Piece of the Planet'', Red Deer Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-88995-191-8}}</ref>\n\n'''Bioregional mapping''' is a powerful tool to increase understanding, change the story and influence policy.  A good bioregional map shows layers of geology, flora, fauna, and inhabitation over time. All the interdisciplinary content that is integrated in this kind of map makes it a great communication tool to illustrate an ecological approach. One of the best examples of a richly communicative bioregional map is David McClosky's [http://cascadia-institute.org/ new map of Cascadia].\n\nSome thinkers disagree that [[deep ecology]] thinking leads to bioregionalism <ref>{{Cite journal |last=Davidson |first=Stewart |year=2007 |title=The Troubled Marriage of Deep Ecology and Bioregionalism |journal=Environmental Values |publisher=White Horse Press |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=313\u2013332 |doi=10.3197/096327107X228373 |jstor=30302156}}</ref> or that bioregionalism is a practicable way of organising human society  <ref>Brennan, Andrew, (1998) [https://brill.com/view/journals/wo/2/3/article-p215_6.xml Bioregionalism- a Misplaced Project?]  Worldviews: Global Religions, Culture, and Ecology Volume 2: Issue 3</ref>\n\n==Relationship to environmentalism==\n\nBioregionalism, while akin to [[environmentalism]] in certain aspects, such as a desire to live in harmony with [[nature]], differs in certain ways from classical, 20th century environmentalism.<ref name=\"pbopd\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sustainable-city.org/intervws/berg.htm |title=Peter Berg of Planet Drum |date=1998-02-12 |publisher=Sustainable-city.org |access-date=2012-11-08}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Peter Berg, bioregionalism is [[proactive]], and is based on forming a harmony between human culture and the natural environment, rather than being [[protest]]-based like the original environmental movement. Also, while classical environmentalists saw human industry as the [[enemy]] of nature and nature as a victim needing to be saved; bioregionalists see humanity and its culture as a part of nature, focusing on building a positive, sustainable relationship with the environment, rather than a focus on preserving and segregating the [[wilderness]] from the world of humanity.<ref name=\"pbopd\" />\n\n==In politics==\nNorth American Bioregional Assemblies have been bi-annual gatherings of bioregionalists throughout North America since 1984 and have given rise to national level [[Green Parties]]. In addition, bioregionalism spawned the sustainability movement{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. The tenets of bioregionalism are often used by green movements, which oppose political organizations whose boundaries conform to existing electoral districts.  This problem is perceived to result in elected representatives voting in accordance with their constituents, some of whom may live outside a defined bioregion, and may run counter to the well-being of the bioregion.\n\nAt the local level, several bioregions have congresses that meet regularly. For instance, the Ozark Plateau bioregion hosts a yearly Ozark Area Community Congress, better known as OACC, which has been meeting every year since 1980,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ozarkareacommunitycongress.org/ |title=About OACC Ozark Area Community Congress |website=OACC Ozark Area Community Congress |access-date=1 February 2013}}</ref> most often on the first weekend in October. The Kansas Area Watershed, \"KAW\" was founded in 1982 and has been meeting regularly since that time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kawcouncil.wordpress.com/about/history/ |title=Kansas Area Watershed Council History |date=8 March 2009 |access-date=1 February 2013}}</ref> KAW holds a yearly meeting, usually in the spring.\n\nThe government of the Canadian province of Alberta has recently made major amendments to its land-use policies including a separate \"land-use framework\" document for each major [[river basin]] within the province.  This is supported by local initiatives such as the [[Beaver Hills (Alberta)|Beaver Hills]] Initiative, which seeks to create a large [[biosphere reserve]] encompassing [[Elk Island National Park]] and the surrounding area.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.beaverhills.ca/ |title=Home {{!}} Beaver Hills Initiative |website=www.beaverhills.ca |language=en |access-date=2017-02-21}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cascadia (independence movement)]]\n* [[Deep ecology]]\n* [[Eco-communalism]]\n* [[Ecological footprint]]\n* [[\u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus]]\n* [[Geo-fence]]\n* [[Grassroots democracy]]\n* [[Green anarchism]]\n* [[List of ecoregions]]\n* [[Permaculture]]\n* [[Social ecology (theory)|Social ecology]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Alexander, D.

Bioregions, by contrast are human regions, informed by nature but with a social and political element. In this way bioregionalism is simply [[political localism]] with an ecological foundation.\n\n==Overview==\nThe term was coined by Allen Van Newkirk, founder of the Institute for Bioregional Research, in 1975,<ref>{{Cite book |last=McGinnis |first=Michael Vincent |title=Bioregionalism |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |isbn=041515444-8 |location=London and New York |page=22}}</ref> given currency by [[Peter Berg (bioregionalist)|Peter Berg]] and [[Raymond Dasmann]] in the early 1970s,<ref>Berg, Peter and Raymond Dasmann, \"Reinhabiting California,\" ''The Ecologist'' 7, no. 10 (1977)</ref> and has been advocated by writers such as David Haenke<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mongillo |first=John F. |url=https://books.google.com/?id=n42Rf_ibaMcC&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=david+haenke#v=onepage |title=Environmental Activists |last2=Booth |first2=Bibi |year=2001 |isbn=9780313308840}}</ref> and [[Kirkpatrick Sale]].<ref>Anderson, Walter Truett.

This perspective seeks to:\n*Ensure that political boundaries match ecological boundaries.<ref>Davidson, S.

A good bioregional map shows layers of geology, flora, fauna, and inhabitation over time. All the interdisciplinary content that is integrated in this kind of map makes it a great communication tool to illustrate an ecological approach. One of the best examples of a richly communicative bioregional map is David McClosky's [http://cascadia-institute.org/ new map of Cascadia].\n\nSome thinkers disagree that [[deep ecology]] thinking leads to bioregionalism <ref>{{Cite journal |last=Davidson |first=Stewart |year=2007 |title=The Troubled Marriage of Deep Ecology and Bioregionalism |journal=Environmental Values |publisher=White Horse Press |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=313\u2013332 |doi=10.3197/096327107X228373 |jstor=30302156}}</ref> or that bioregionalism is a practicable way of organising human society  <ref>Brennan, Andrew, (1998) [https://brill.com/view/journals/wo/2/3/article-p215_6.xml Bioregionalism- a Misplaced Project?]  Worldviews: Global Religions, Culture, and Ecology Volume 2: Issue 3</ref>\n\n==Relationship to environmentalism==\n\nBioregionalism, while akin to [[environmentalism]] in certain aspects, such as a desire to live in harmony with [[nature]], differs in certain ways from classical, 20th century environmentalism.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sustainable-city.org/intervws/berg.htm |title=Peter Berg of Planet Drum |date=1998-02-12 |publisher=Sustainable-city.org |access-date=2012-11-08}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Peter Berg, bioregionalism is [[proactive]], and is based on forming a harmony between human culture and the natural environment, rather than being [[protest]]-based like the original environmental movement. Also, while classical environmentalists saw human industry as the [[enemy]] of nature and nature as a victim needing to be saved; bioregionalists see humanity and its culture as a part of nature, focusing on building a positive, sustainable relationship with the environment, rather than a focus on preserving and segregating the [[wilderness]] from the world of humanity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sustainable-city.org/intervws/berg.htm |title=Peter Berg of Planet Drum |date=1998-02-12 |publisher=Sustainable-city.org |access-date=2012-11-08}}</ref>\n\n==In politics==\nNorth American Bioregional Assemblies have been bi-annual gatherings of bioregionalists throughout North America since 1984 and have given rise to national level [[Green Parties]]. In addition, bioregionalism spawned the sustainability movement{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. The tenets of bioregionalism are often used by green movements, which oppose political organizations whose boundaries conform to existing electoral districts.  This problem is perceived to result in elected representatives voting in accordance with their constituents, some of whom may live outside a defined bioregion, and may run counter to the well-being of the bioregion.\n\nAt the local level, several bioregions have congresses that meet regularly. For instance, the Ozark Plateau bioregion hosts a yearly Ozark Area Community Congress, better known as OACC, which has been meeting every year since 1980,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ozarkareacommunitycongress.org/ |title=About OACC Ozark Area Community Congress |website=OACC Ozark Area Community Congress |access-date=1 February 2013}}</ref> most often on the first weekend in October. The Kansas Area Watershed, \"KAW\" was founded in 1982 and has been meeting regularly since that time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kawcouncil.wordpress.com/about/history/ |title=Kansas Area Watershed Council History |date=8 March 2009 |access-date=1 February 2013}}</ref> KAW holds a yearly meeting, usually in the spring.\n\nThe government of the Canadian province of Alberta has recently made major amendments to its land-use policies including a separate \"land-use framework\" document for each major [[river basin]] within the province.  This is supported by local initiatives such as the [[Beaver Hills (Alberta)|Beaver Hills]] Initiative, which seeks to create a large [[biosphere reserve]] encompassing [[Elk Island National Park]] and the surrounding area.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.beaverhills.ca/ |title=Home {{!}} Beaver Hills Initiative |website=www.beaverhills.ca |language=en |access-date=2017-02-21}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cascadia (independence movement)]]\n* [[Deep ecology]]\n* [[Eco-communalism]]\n* [[Ecological footprint]]\n* [[\u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus]]\n* [[Geo-fence]]\n* [[Grassroots democracy]]\n* [[Green anarchism]]\n* [[List of ecoregions]]\n* [[Permaculture]]\n* [[Social ecology (theory)|Social ecology]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Alexander, D.

He had only taken over as Villa boss before the quarter-finals after the shock resignation of Villa boss [[Ron Saunders]].\n\nOne of the most memorable incidents of the final occurred after 10 minutes when veteran goalkeeper [[Jimmy Rimmer]] suffered a repeat of a recurring shoulder injury. His replacement, [[Nigel Spink]], subsequently made only his second first team appearance for the club. His performance in helping prevent Bayern from scoring throughout the match was subsequently highly praised, and is seen by many as the making of a player who would be Villa's first choice goalkeeper for the following 10 seasons.<ref>{{citeweb|url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2016/may/26/aston-villa-european-cup-relegated-1982|title=How Aston Villa won the European Cup (and were then relegated five years later)|date=26 May 2016|work=Guardian|accessdate=27 May 2016}}</ref>\t\n\nAlso memorably Bayern Munich did find the net with three minutes of play remaining, although the goal was ruled offside. Villa also got the ball in the net for a second time a few seconds before the end of the match but this goal was also disallowed.\n\n[[Brian Moore (commentator)|Brian Moore]]'s commentary of the winning goal is displayed on a giant banner across the North Stand of [[Villa Park]]:\n{{cquote|Shaw, Williams, prepared to venture down the left.
