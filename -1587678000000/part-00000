These land disputes included estates his father held [[Tenant-in-chief|in-chief]] from the crown and others which he had held from the Peverel family as [[Lord|overlords]].\n\nOther lawsuits concerned Whittington Castle held by the Peverels during the reign of King Stephen. Although he won the right to Whittington in or about 1195, he never received formal legal ''[[seisin]]'' and it remained in Welsh hands at the time of his death in 1197.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 35</ref>\n\n[[Whittington Castle]] lies on the English side of [[Offa's Dyke]], which during the Norman era and before was the border between England and [[Wales]]. The site was fortified as a castle by [[William Peverel]] in 1138, in support of Empress Matilda, the daughter of King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] (1100\u20131135), in her struggle (known as [[The Anarchy]]) for the throne against King Stephen (1135\u20131154), grandson of [[William the Conqueror]]. In the late 1140s the [[Marcher lord|lordship]] of [[Whittington, Shropshire|Whittington]], like [[Oswestry]] and Overton ceased to be part of England and became part of the [[Kingdom of Powys]] and a Welsh [[marcher lord]]ship.<ref>P.

After his father's death in 1197 Fulk III offered [[feudal relief|relief]] of \u00a3100 for the inheritance of Whittington. However Maurice of Powis (d.1200), the son of Roger of Powis, who had offered half that amount, on 11 April 1200 was granted Whittington by [[John, King of England|King John]]. Again, after Maurice's death in August 1200, King John granted it to Maurice's heirs.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 36</ref>\n\nIt is not known why King John refused to recognise Fulk's claim to Whittington as his rightful inheritance but by April 1201 Fulk was in open rebellion against the King. He was accompanied by approximately fifty-two followers including his brothers William, Phillip and John, his cousins, and by the family's many tenants and allies in the Marches.<ref name=\"FFWOCH97\"/><ref name=\"Sidney Painter 1964 p. 52\"/>\n\nFulk's rebellion is not related in detail by chroniclers but was clearly considerable as in the spring of 1201, while King John crossed into [[Normandy]] and [[Poitou]] to suppress a revolt by the [[Lusignan dynasty|Lusignans]],<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) p. 157</ref> he ordered [[Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent|Hubert de Burgh]], with 100 knights, to counter the rebellion of Fulk and William Marsh, a [[Somerset]]shire knight who was raiding shipping off the coast of [[Devon]].<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pp. 48, 84</ref>\n\nIn July 1202 Fulk and his men are reported to have taken refuge in [[Stanley Abbey]] in Wiltshire. Another man, Gilbert de Duure, is mentioned in records as \"...having been an outlaw associated with Fulk Fitz Warin\".  Yet another, Eustace de Kivilly, was pardoned earlier in 1202 by King John for \"being associated with Fulk\".<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 38</ref>\n\nAfter many years of being an outlaw, on 11 November 1203 Fulk was pardoned together with over thirty of his followers, including his brothers William,  Phillip and John and his cousins. In October 1204, on payment of a fine of 200 marks, Fulk at last received \"right and inheritance\" in Whittington.<ref>A. Kemp-Welch (translator), L. Brandin (ed.), ''The History of Fulk Fitz-Warine'' (Alexander Moring Ltd., De La More Press, London 1904), p. xii.</ref> Whittington Castle thereafter descended in the [[Baron FitzWarin|FitzWarin family]], all subsequent holders bearing the first-name Fulk, until the death of [[Fulk XI FitzWarin, 7th Baron FitzWarin]] (1405\u20131420) in 1420.<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pps. 51\u201352</ref>\n\nIn 1207 Fulk III was clearly highly regarded by many of the king's barons as evidenced by the identity of men known to have provided surety for Fulk's fine of 1,200 marks to marry the heiress daughter of Robert le Vavasur. The suretors included the Peverels, [[Alan Basset]], [[William de Braose (died 1230)|William de Braose]] (d.1230), a de Lacy, [[William Longesp\u00e9e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury]] and [[Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford]].<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 39</ref>\n\nOn 9 February 1214, when King John again set sail for [[Poitou]], Fulk was among the barons who accompanied him. He is believed then to have been  a vassal of [[Geoffrey FitzGeoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex|Geoffrey de Mandeville]], Earl of Gloucester.<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pp. 280, 294.</ref>\n\nIn 1215 Fulk was one of many giving great trouble to the [[Sheriff of Shropshire]]. Before 1216 and the accession of the infant King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (1216\u20131272), John's son, Fulk's manor of Alveston had been seized by the crown and in the following year 1217 all of his other lands in Gloucestershire were likewise seized. By 1218 however Fulk had made peace and his lands were ordered restored by the regents of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]].<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 41, 43</ref>\n\nBy 1220 Fulk had regained some favour with the young King Henry III and had been allowed to rebuild and fortify Whittington. In 1223 however it fell to [[Llywelyn the Great]], prince of Wales. Fulk  regained it the following year although his disputes with Llywelyn continued and more of Fulk's lands were seized.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 42</ref>\n\nBy 1228 a truce seems to have been reached between Fulk and Llywelyn following the intervention of the king.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 41</ref>\n\nThroughout these years Fulk's relations with the King were changeable and seemed to be directly dependent on the state of affairs in Wales. As a marcher lord Fulk's role as a protector of the English border against the Welsh was vital to the English King. He arbitrated several border disputes on behalf of the King and although there were more personal disagreements, there were no more rebellions on the part of Fulk III.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 42, 43, 45</ref>\n\n==Marriages and progeny==\nFulk III FitzWarin married twice:\n*Firstly, in about 1207, to [[Maud le Vavasour, Baroness Butler|Maud le Vavasour]] (d.1226), (''alias'' Matilda), daughter of Robert le Vavasour and widow of the powerful Lancashire baron Theobald Walter.<ref>George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage of England Scotland Ireland Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant Extinct or Dormant, ed.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

Before 1216 and the accession of the infant King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (1216\u20131272), John's son, Fulk's manor of Alveston had been seized by the crown and in the following year 1217 all of his other lands in Gloucestershire were likewise seized.

In 1223 however it fell to [[Llywelyn the Great]], prince of Wales. Fulk  regained it the following year although his disputes with Llywelyn continued and more of Fulk's lands were seized.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 42</ref>\n\nBy 1228 a truce seems to have been reached between Fulk and Llywelyn following the intervention of the king.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 41</ref>\n\nThroughout these years Fulk's relations with the King were changeable and seemed to be directly dependent on the state of affairs in Wales. As a marcher lord Fulk's role as a protector of the English border against the Welsh was vital to the English King. He arbitrated several border disputes on behalf of the King and although there were more personal disagreements, there were no more rebellions on the part of Fulk III.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 42, 43, 45</ref>\n\n==Marriages and progeny==\nFulk III FitzWarin married twice:\n*Firstly, in about 1207, to [[Maud le Vavasour, Baroness Butler|Maud le Vavasour]] (d.1226), (''alias'' Matilda), daughter of Robert le Vavasour and widow of the powerful Lancashire baron Theobald Walter.<ref>George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage of England Scotland Ireland Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant Extinct or Dormant, ed.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

It is a generalization of the notion of a \"[[Line (mathematics)|straight line]]\" to a more general setting. \n\nThe terms \"geodesic\" and \"[[geodetic]]\" come from ''[[geodesy]]'', the science of measuring the size and shape of [[Earth]], while many of the underlying principles can be applied to any [[Spheroid|spheroidal]] geometry. In the original sense, a geodesic was the shortest route between two points on the Earth's [[Planetary surface|surface]]. For a [[spherical Earth]], it is a [[line segment|segment]] of a [[great circle]].  The term has been generalized to include measurements in much more general mathematical spaces; for example, in [[graph theory]], one might consider a [[Distance (graph theory)|geodesic]] between two [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]]/nodes of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]].\n\nIn a Riemannian manifold or submanifold geodesics are characterised by the property of having vanishing [[geodesic curvature]]. More generally, in the presence of an [[affine connection]], a geodesic is defined to be a curve whose [[Tangent space|tangent vector]]s remain parallel if they are [[parallel transport|transported]] along it. Applying this to the [[Levi-Civita connection]] of a [[Riemannian metric]] recovers the previous notion.\n\nGeodesics are of particular importance in [[general relativity]].  Timelike [[geodesics in general relativity]] describe the motion of [[free fall]]ing [[test particles]].\n\n==Introduction==\nThe shortest path between two given points in a curved space, assumed to be a [[differential manifold]], can be defined by using the [[equation]] for the [[Arc length|length]] of a [[curve]] (a function ''f'' from an [[open interval]] of '''[[Real number line|R]]''' to the space), and then minimizing this length between the points using the [[calculus of variations]]. This has some minor technical problems, because there is an infinite dimensional space of different ways to parameterize the shortest path. It is simpler to restrict the set of curves to those that are parameterized \"with constant speed\" 1, meaning that  the distance from ''f''(''s'') to ''f''(''t'') along the curve equals |''s''&minus;''t''|. Equivalently, a different quantity may be used, termed the energy of the curve; minimizing the energy leads to the same equations for a geodesic (here \"constant velocity\" is a consequence of minimization).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Intuitively, one can understand this second formulation by noting that an [[elastic band]] stretched between two points will contract its length, and in so doing will minimize its energy.  The resulting shape of the band is a geodesic.\n\nIt is possible that several different curves between two points minimize the distance, as is the case for two diametrically opposite points on a sphere. In such a case, any of these curves is a geodesic.\n\nA contiguous segment of a geodesic is again a geodesic.\n\nIn general, geodesics are not the same as \"shortest curves\" between two points, though the two concepts are closely related. The difference is that geodesics are only ''locally'' the shortest distance between points, and are parameterized with \"constant speed\". Going the \"long way round\" on a [[great circle]] between two points on a sphere is a geodesic but not the shortest path between the points. The map ''t''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''t''<sup>2</sup> from the unit interval on the real number line to itself gives the shortest path between 0 and 1, but is not a geodesic because the velocity of the corresponding motion of a point is not constant.\n\nGeodesics are commonly seen in the study of [[Riemannian geometry]] and more generally [[metric geometry]]. In [[general relativity]], geodesics in [[spacetime]] describe the motion of [[point particle]]s under the influence of gravity alone. In particular, the path taken by a falling rock, an orbiting [[satellite]], or the shape of a [[planetary orbit]] are all geodesics in curved spacetime. More generally, the topic of [[sub-Riemannian geometry]] deals with the paths that objects may take when they are not free, and their movement is constrained in various ways.\n\nThis article presents the mathematical formalism involved in defining, finding, and proving the existence of geodesics, in the case of [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] and [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s.  The article [[geodesic (general relativity)]] discusses the special case of general relativity in greater detail.\n\n===Examples===\n[[File:Transpolar geodesic on a triaxial ellipsoid case A.svg|thumb|right|200px|\nA [[geodesics on a triaxial ellipsoid|geodesic on a triaxial ellipsoid]].]]\n[[File:Insect on a torus tracing out a non-trivial geodesic.gif|thumb|right|If an insect is placed on a surface and continually walks \"forward\", by definition it will trace out a geodesic.]]\nThe most familiar examples are the straight lines in [[Euclidean geometry]]. On a  [[sphere]], the images of geodesics are the  [[great circle]]s. The shortest path from point ''A'' to point ''B'' on a sphere is given by the shorter [[arc (geometry)|arc]] of the great circle passing through ''A'' and ''B''. If ''A'' and ''B'' are [[antipodal point]]s, then there are ''infinitely many'' shortest paths between them.  [[Geodesics on an ellipsoid]] behave in a more complicated way than on a sphere; in particular, they are not closed in general (see figure).\n\n==Metric geometry==\nIn [[metric geometry]], a geodesic is a curve which is everywhere [[locally]] a [[distance]] minimizer. More precisely, a [[curve]] {{nowrap|''\u03b3'' : ''I'' \u2192 ''M''}} from an interval ''I'' of the reals to the [[metric space]] ''M'' is a '''geodesic''' if there is a [[mathematical constant|constant]] {{nowrap|''v'' \u2265 0}} such that for any {{nowrap|''t'' \u2208 ''I''}} there is a neighborhood ''J'' of ''t'' in ''I'' such that for any {{nowrap|''t''<sub>1</sub>,\u2009''t''<sub>2</sub> \u2208 ''J''}} we have\n\n:<math>d(\\gamma(t_1),\\gamma(t_2)) = v \\left| t_1 - t_2 \\right| .</math>\n\nThis generalizes the notion of geodesic for Riemannian manifolds. However, in metric geometry the geodesic considered is often equipped with [[Curve#Lengths of curves|natural parameterization]], i.e. in the above identity ''v''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and\n\n:<math>d(\\gamma(t_1),\\gamma(t_2)) = \\left| t_1 - t_2 \\right| .</math>\n\nIf the last equality is satisfied for all {{nowrap|''t''<sub>1</sub>, ''t''<sub>2</sub> \u2208 ''I''}}, the geodesic is called a '''minimizing geodesic''' or '''shortest path'''.\n\nIn general, a metric space may have no geodesics, except constant curves. At the other extreme, any two points in a [[length metric space]] are joined by a minimizing sequence of [[rectifiable path]]s, although this minimizing sequence need not converge to a geodesic.\n\n==Riemannian geometry==\nIn a [[Riemannian manifold]] ''M'' with [[metric tensor]] ''g'', the length ''L'' of a continuously differentiable curve \u03b3&nbsp;:&nbsp;[''a'',''b'']&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''M'' is defined by\n:<math>L(\\gamma)=\\int_a^b \\sqrt{  g_{\\gamma(t)}(\\dot\\gamma(t),\\dot\\gamma(t)) }\\,dt.</math>\nThe distance ''d''(''p'',\u2009''q'') between two points ''p'' and ''q'' of ''M'' is defined as the [[infimum]] of the length taken over all continuous, piecewise continuously differentiable curves \u03b3&nbsp;:&nbsp;[''a'',''b'']&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''M'' such that \u03b3(''a'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p'' and \u03b3(''b'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''q''. In Riemannian geometry, all geodesics are locally distance-minimizing paths, but the converse is not true. In fact, only paths that are both locally distance minimizing and parameterized proportionately to arc-length are geodesics. Another equivalent way of defining geodesics on a Riemannian manifold, is to define them as the minima of the following [[action (physics)|action]] or [[energy functional]]\n:<math>E(\\gamma)=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_a^b g_{\\gamma(t)}(\\dot\\gamma(t),\\dot\\gamma(t))\\,dt.</math>\nAll minima of ''E'' are also minima of ''L'', but ''L'' is a bigger set since paths that are minima of ''L'' can be arbitrarily re-parameterized, while minima of ''E'' cannot.\nFor a piecewise <math>C^1</math> curve (more generally, a <math>W^{1,2}</math> curve), the [[Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality]] gives\n:<math>L(\\gamma)^2 \\le 2(b-a)E(\\gamma)</math>\nwith equality if and only if <math>g(\\gamma',\\gamma')</math> is equal to a constant a.e.  It happens that minimizers of <math>E(\\gamma)</math> also minimize <math>L(\\gamma)</math>, because they turn out to be affinely parameterized, and the inequality is an equality.  The usefulness of this approach is that the problem of seeking minimizers of ''E'' is a more robust variational problem.  Indeed, ''E'' is a \"convex function\" of <math>\\gamma</math>, so that within each isotopy class of \"reasonable functions\", one ought to expect existence, uniqueness, and regularity of minimizers.  In contrast, \"minimizers\" of the functional <math>L(\\gamma)</math> are generally not very regular, because arbitrary reparameterizations are allowed.\n\nThe [[Euler\u2013Lagrange equation]]s of motion for the functional ''E'' are then given in local coordinates by\n:<math>\\frac{d^2x^\\lambda }{dt^2} + \\Gamma^{\\lambda}_{\\mu \\nu }\\frac{dx^\\mu }{dt}\\frac{dx^\\nu }{dt} = 0,</math>\nwhere <math>\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu}</math> are the [[Christoffel symbols]] of the metric.  This is the '''geodesic equation''', discussed [[#Affine geodesics|below]].\n\n===Calculus of variations===\n\nTechniques of the classical [[calculus of variations]] can be applied to examine the energy functional ''E''.  The [[first variation]] of energy is defined in local coordinates by\n\n:<math>\\delta E(\\gamma)(\\varphi) = \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right|_{t=0} E(\\gamma + t\\varphi).</math>\n\nThe [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s of the first variation are precisely the geodesics.  The [[second variation]] is defined by\n\n:<math>\\delta^2 E(\\gamma)(\\varphi,\\psi) = \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial s \\, \\partial t} \\right|_{s=t=0} E(\\gamma + t\\varphi + s\\psi).</math>\n\nIn an appropriate sense, zeros of the second variation along a geodesic \u03b3 arise along [[Jacobi field]]s.  Jacobi fields are thus regarded as variations through geodesics.\n\nBy applying variational techniques from [[classical mechanics]], one can also regard [[geodesics as Hamiltonian flows]].  They are solutions of the associated [[Hamilton equation]]s, with (pseudo-)Riemannian metric taken as [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]].\n\n==Affine geodesics==\n{{See also|Geodesics in general relativity}}\nA '''geodesic''' on a [[Differentiable manifold|smooth manifold]]  ''M'' with an [[affine connection]]  \u2207 is defined as a [[curve]] \u03b3(''t'') such that [[parallel transport]] along the curve preserves the tangent vector to the curve, so\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> \\nabla_{\\dot\\gamma} \\dot\\gamma= 0</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nat each point along the curve,  where <math>\\dot\\gamma</math> is the derivative with respect to <math>t</math>.  More precisely, in order to define the covariant derivative of <math>\\dot\\gamma</math> it is necessary first to extend <math>\\dot\\gamma</math> to a continuously differentiable [[vector field]] in an [[open set]].  However, the resulting value of ({{EquationNote|1}}) is independent of the choice of extension.\n\nUsing [[local coordinates]] on ''M'', we can write the '''geodesic equation''' (using the [[summation convention]]) as\n:<math>\\frac{d^2\\gamma^\\lambda }{dt^2} + \\Gamma^{\\lambda}_{\\mu \\nu }\\frac{d\\gamma^\\mu }{dt}\\frac{d\\gamma^\\nu }{dt} = 0\\ ,</math>\nwhere <math>\\gamma^\\mu = x^\\mu \\circ \\gamma (t)</math> are the coordinates of the curve \u03b3(''t'') and <math>\\Gamma^{\\lambda }_{\\mu \\nu }</math> are the [[Christoffel symbol]]s of the connection \u2207.  This is an [[ordinary differential equation]] for the coordinates.  It has a unique solution, given an initial position and an initial velocity.  Therefore, from the point of view of [[classical mechanics]], geodesics can be thought of as trajectories of [[free particle]]s in a manifold. Indeed, the equation <math> \\nabla_{\\dot\\gamma} \\dot\\gamma= 0</math> means that the [[Acceleration (differential geometry)|acceleration vector]] of the curve has no components in the direction of the surface (and therefore it is perpendicular to the tangent plane of the surface at each point of the curve). So, the motion is completely determined by the bending of the surface. This is also the idea of general relativity where particles move on geodesics and the bending is caused by the gravity.\n\n===Existence and uniqueness===\nThe ''local existence and uniqueness theorem'' for geodesics states that geodesics on a smooth manifold with an [[affine connection]] exist, and are unique.  More precisely:\n\n:For any point ''p'' in ''M'' and for any vector ''V'' in ''T<sub>p</sub>M'' (the [[tangent space]] to ''M'' at ''p'') there exists a unique geodesic <math>\\gamma \\,</math> : ''I'' &rarr; ''M'' such that\n::<math>\\gamma(0) = p \\,</math> and\n::<math>\\dot\\gamma(0) = V,</math>\n:where ''I'' is a maximal [[open interval]] in '''R''' containing 0.\n\nThe proof of this theorem follows from the theory of  [[ordinary differential equation]]s, by noticing that the geodesic equation is a second-order ODE. Existence and uniqueness then follow from the [[Picard&ndash;Lindel\u00f6f theorem]] for the solutions of ODEs with prescribed initial conditions. \u03b3 depends [[smooth function|smoothly]] on both ''p'' and&nbsp;''V''.  \n\nIn general, ''I'' may not be all of '''R''' as for example for an open disc in '''R'''<sup>2</sup>. Any {{mvar|\u03b3}} extends to all of {{mvar|\u211d}} if and only if {{mvar|M}} is [[geodesic manifold|geodesically complete]].\n\n===Geodesic flow===\nGeodesic [[Flow (mathematics)|flow]] is a local '''R'''-[[Group action (mathematics)|action]] on the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM'' of a manifold ''M'' defined in the following way\n\n:<math>G^t(V)=\\dot\\gamma_V(t)</math>\n\nwhere ''t''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''R''', ''V''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''TM'' and <math>\\gamma_V</math> denotes the geodesic with initial data <math>\\dot\\gamma_V(0)=V</math>. Thus,  ''<math>G^t</math>''(''V'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;exp(''tV'') is the [[exponential map (Riemannian geometry)|exponential map]] of the vector ''tV''.  A closed orbit of the geodesic flow corresponds to a [[closed geodesic]] on&nbsp;''M''.\n\nOn a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold, the geodesic flow is identified with a [[Hamiltonian flow]] on the cotangent bundle.  The [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] is then given by the inverse of the (pseudo-)Riemannian metric, evaluated against the [[canonical one-form]]. In particular the flow preserves the (pseudo-)Riemannian metric <math>g</math>, i.e.\n\n: <math>g(G^t(V),G^t(V))=g(V,V). \\, </math>\n\nIn particular, when ''V'' is a unit vector, <math>\\gamma_V</math> remains unit speed throughout, so the geodesic flow is tangent to the [[unit tangent bundle]].  [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]] implies invariance of a kinematic measure on the unit tangent bundle.\n\n===Geodesic spray===\nThe geodesic flow defines a family of curves in the [[tangent bundle]]. The derivatives of these curves define a [[vector field]]  on the [[total space]] of the tangent bundle, known as the [[spray (mathematics)|geodesic spray]].\n\nMore precisely, an affine connection gives rise to a splitting of the [[double tangent bundle]] TT''M'' into [[horizontal bundle|horizontal]] and [[vertical bundle]]s:\n:<math>TTM = H\\oplus V.</math>\nThe geodesic spray is the unique horizontal vector field ''W'' satisfying\n:<math>\\pi_* W_v = v\\,</math>\nat each point ''v''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;T''M''; here \u03c0<sub>\u2217</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;TT''M''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;T''M'' denotes the [[pushforward (differential)]] along the projection \u03c0&nbsp;:&nbsp;T''M''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''M'' associated to the tangent bundle.\n\nMore generally, the same construction allows one to construct a vector field for any [[Ehresmann connection]] on the tangent bundle.  For the resulting vector field to be a spray (on the deleted tangent bundle T''M''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;{0}) it is enough that the connection be equivariant under positive rescalings: it need not be linear.  That is, (cf. [[Ehresmann connection#Vector bundles and covariant derivatives]]) it is enough that the horizontal distribution satisfy\n:<math>H_{\\lambda X} = d(S_\\lambda)_X H_X\\,</math>\nfor every ''X''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;T''M''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;{0} and \u03bb&nbsp;>&nbsp;0.  Here ''d''(''S''<sub>\u03bb</sub>) is the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] along the scalar homothety <math>S_\\lambda: X\\mapsto \\lambda X.</math>  A particular case of a non-linear connection arising in this manner is that associated to a [[Finsler manifold]].\n\n===Affine and projective geodesics===\nEquation ({{EquationNote|1}}) is invariant under affine reparameterizations; that is, parameterizations of the form\n:<math>t\\mapsto at+b</math>\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are constant real numbers. Thus apart from specifying a certain class of embedded curves, the geodesic equation also determines a preferred class of parameterizations on each of the curves. Accordingly, solutions of ({{EquationNote|1}}) are called geodesics with '''affine parameter'''.\n\nAn affine connection is ''determined by'' its family of affinely parameterized geodesics, up to [[torsion tensor|torsion]] {{harv|Spivak|1999|loc=Chapter 6, Addendum I}}.  The torsion itself does not, in fact, affect the family of geodesics, since the geodesic equation depends only on the symmetric part of the connection.  More precisely, if <math>\\nabla, \\bar{\\nabla}</math> are two connections such that the difference tensor\n:<math>D(X,Y) = \\nabla_XY-\\bar{\\nabla}_XY</math>\nis [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]], then <math>\\nabla</math> and <math>\\bar{\\nabla}</math> have the same geodesics, with the same affine parameterizations. Furthermore, there is a unique connection having the same geodesics as  <math>\\nabla</math>, but with vanishing torsion.\n\nGeodesics without a particular parameterization are described by a [[projective connection]].\n\n==Computational methods==\nEfficient solvers for the minimal geodesic problem on surfaces posed as [[eikonal equation]]s have been proposed by Kimmel and others.<ref>{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Kimmel |first2=A. |last2=Amir |first3=A.

It is a generalization of the notion of a \"[[Line (mathematics)|straight line]]\" to a more general setting. \n\nThe terms \"geodesic\" and \"[[geodetic]]\" come from ''[[geodesy]]'', the science of measuring the size and shape of [[Earth]]. In the original sense, a geodesic was the shortest route between two points on the Earth's [[Planetary surface|surface]]. For a [[spherical Earth]], it is a [[line segment|segment]] of a [[great circle]].  The term has been generalized to include measurements in much more general mathematical spaces; for example, in [[graph theory]], one might consider a [[Distance (graph theory)|geodesic]] between two [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]]/nodes of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]].\n\nIn a Riemannian manifold or submanifold geodesics are characterised by the property of having vanishing [[geodesic curvature]]. More generally, in the presence of an [[affine connection]], a geodesic is defined to be a curve whose [[Tangent space|tangent vector]]s remain parallel if they are [[parallel transport|transported]] along it. Applying this to the [[Levi-Civita connection]] of a [[Riemannian metric]] recovers the previous notion.\n\nGeodesics are of particular importance in [[general relativity]].  Timelike [[geodesics in general relativity]] describe the motion of [[free fall]]ing [[test particles]].\n\n==Introduction==\nThe shortest path between two given points in a curved space, assumed to be a [[differential manifold]], can be defined by using the [[equation]] for the [[Arc length|length]] of a [[curve]] (a function ''f'' from an [[open interval]] of '''[[Real number line|R]]''' to the space), and then minimizing this length between the points using the [[calculus of variations]]. This has some minor technical problems, because there is an infinite dimensional space of different ways to parameterize the shortest path. It is simpler to restrict the set of curves to those that are parameterized \"with constant speed\" 1, meaning that  the distance from ''f''(''s'') to ''f''(''t'') along the curve equals |''s''&minus;''t''|. Equivalently, a different quantity may be used, termed the energy of the curve; minimizing the energy leads to the same equations for a geodesic (here \"constant velocity\" is a consequence of minimization).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Intuitively, one can understand this second formulation by noting that an [[elastic band]] stretched between two points will contract its length, and in so doing will minimize its energy.  The resulting shape of the band is a geodesic.\n\nIt is possible that several different curves between two points minimize the distance, as is the case for two diametrically opposite points on a sphere. In such a case, any of these curves is a geodesic.\n\nA contiguous segment of a geodesic is again a geodesic.\n\nIn general, geodesics are not the same as \"shortest curves\" between two points, though the two concepts are closely related. The difference is that geodesics are only ''locally'' the shortest distance between points, and are parameterized with \"constant speed\". Going the \"long way round\" on a [[great circle]] between two points on a sphere is a geodesic but not the shortest path between the points. The map ''t''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''t''<sup>2</sup> from the unit interval on the real number line to itself gives the shortest path between 0 and 1, but is not a geodesic because the velocity of the corresponding motion of a point is not constant.\n\nGeodesics are commonly seen in the study of [[Riemannian geometry]] and more generally [[metric geometry]]. In [[general relativity]], geodesics in [[spacetime]] describe the motion of [[point particle]]s under the influence of gravity alone. In particular, the path taken by a falling rock, an orbiting [[satellite]], or the shape of a [[planetary orbit]] are all geodesics in curved spacetime. More generally, the topic of [[sub-Riemannian geometry]] deals with the paths that objects may take when they are not free, and their movement is constrained in various ways.\n\nThis article presents the mathematical formalism involved in defining, finding, and proving the existence of geodesics, in the case of [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] and [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s.  The article [[geodesic (general relativity)]] discusses the special case of general relativity in greater detail.\n\n===Examples===\n[[File:Transpolar geodesic on a triaxial ellipsoid case A.svg|thumb|right|200px|\nA [[geodesics on a triaxial ellipsoid|geodesic on a triaxial ellipsoid]].]]\n[[File:Insect on a torus tracing out a non-trivial geodesic.gif|thumb|right|If an insect is placed on a surface and continually walks \"forward\", by definition it will trace out a geodesic.]]\nThe most familiar examples are the straight lines in [[Euclidean geometry]]. On a  [[sphere]], the images of geodesics are the  [[great circle]]s. The shortest path from point ''A'' to point ''B'' on a sphere is given by the shorter [[arc (geometry)|arc]] of the great circle passing through ''A'' and ''B''. If ''A'' and ''B'' are [[antipodal point]]s, then there are ''infinitely many'' shortest paths between them.  [[Geodesics on an ellipsoid]] behave in a more complicated way than on a sphere; in particular, they are not closed in general (see figure).\n\n==Metric geometry==\nIn [[metric geometry]], a geodesic is a curve which is everywhere [[locally]] a [[distance]] minimizer. More precisely, a [[curve]] {{nowrap|''\u03b3'' : ''I'' \u2192 ''M''}} from an interval ''I'' of the reals to the [[metric space]] ''M'' is a '''geodesic''' if there is a [[mathematical constant|constant]] {{nowrap|''v'' \u2265 0}} such that for any {{nowrap|''t'' \u2208 ''I''}} there is a neighborhood ''J'' of ''t'' in ''I'' such that for any {{nowrap|''t''<sub>1</sub>,\u2009''t''<sub>2</sub> \u2208 ''J''}} we have\n\n:<math>d(\\gamma(t_1),\\gamma(t_2)) = v \\left| t_1 - t_2 \\right| .</math>\n\nThis generalizes the notion of geodesic for Riemannian manifolds. However, in metric geometry the geodesic considered is often equipped with [[Curve#Lengths of curves|natural parameterization]], i.e. in the above identity ''v''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and\n\n:<math>d(\\gamma(t_1),\\gamma(t_2)) = \\left| t_1 - t_2 \\right| .</math>\n\nIf the last equality is satisfied for all {{nowrap|''t''<sub>1</sub>, ''t''<sub>2</sub> \u2208 ''I''}}, the geodesic is called a '''minimizing geodesic''' or '''shortest path'''.\n\nIn general, a metric space may have no geodesics, except constant curves. At the other extreme, any two points in a [[length metric space]] are joined by a minimizing sequence of [[rectifiable path]]s, although this minimizing sequence need not converge to a geodesic.\n\n==Riemannian geometry==\nIn a [[Riemannian manifold]] ''M'' with [[metric tensor]] ''g'', the length ''L'' of a continuously differentiable curve \u03b3&nbsp;:&nbsp;[''a'',''b'']&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''M'' is defined by\n:<math>L(\\gamma)=\\int_a^b \\sqrt{  g_{\\gamma(t)}(\\dot\\gamma(t),\\dot\\gamma(t)) }\\,dt.</math>\nThe distance ''d''(''p'',\u2009''q'') between two points ''p'' and ''q'' of ''M'' is defined as the [[infimum]] of the length taken over all continuous, piecewise continuously differentiable curves \u03b3&nbsp;:&nbsp;[''a'',''b'']&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''M'' such that \u03b3(''a'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p'' and \u03b3(''b'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''q''. In Riemannian geometry, all geodesics are locally distance-minimizing paths, but the converse is not true. In fact, only paths that are both locally distance minimizing and parameterized proportionately to arc-length are geodesics. Another equivalent way of defining geodesics on a Riemannian manifold, is to define them as the minima of the following [[action (physics)|action]] or [[energy functional]]\n:<math>E(\\gamma)=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_a^b g_{\\gamma(t)}(\\dot\\gamma(t),\\dot\\gamma(t))\\,dt.</math>\nAll minima of ''E'' are also minima of ''L'', but ''L'' is a bigger set since paths that are minima of ''L'' can be arbitrarily re-parameterized, while minima of ''E'' cannot.\nFor a piecewise <math>C^1</math> curve (more generally, a <math>W^{1,2}</math> curve), the [[Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality]] gives\n:<math>L(\\gamma)^2 \\le 2(b-a)E(\\gamma)</math>\nwith equality if and only if <math>g(\\gamma',\\gamma')</math> is equal to a constant a.e.  It happens that minimizers of <math>E(\\gamma)</math> also minimize <math>L(\\gamma)</math>, because they turn out to be affinely parameterized, and the inequality is an equality.  The usefulness of this approach is that the problem of seeking minimizers of ''E'' is a more robust variational problem.  Indeed, ''E'' is a \"convex function\" of <math>\\gamma</math>, so that within each isotopy class of \"reasonable functions\", one ought to expect existence, uniqueness, and regularity of minimizers.  In contrast, \"minimizers\" of the functional <math>L(\\gamma)</math> are generally not very regular, because arbitrary reparameterizations are allowed.\n\nThe [[Euler\u2013Lagrange equation]]s of motion for the functional ''E'' are then given in local coordinates by\n:<math>\\frac{d^2x^\\lambda }{dt^2} + \\Gamma^{\\lambda}_{\\mu \\nu }\\frac{dx^\\mu }{dt}\\frac{dx^\\nu }{dt} = 0,</math>\nwhere <math>\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu}</math> are the [[Christoffel symbols]] of the metric.  This is the '''geodesic equation''', discussed [[#Affine geodesics|below]].\n\n===Calculus of variations===\n\nTechniques of the classical [[calculus of variations]] can be applied to examine the energy functional ''E''.  The [[first variation]] of energy is defined in local coordinates by\n\n:<math>\\delta E(\\gamma)(\\varphi) = \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right|_{t=0} E(\\gamma + t\\varphi).</math>\n\nThe [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s of the first variation are precisely the geodesics.  The [[second variation]] is defined by\n\n:<math>\\delta^2 E(\\gamma)(\\varphi,\\psi) = \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial s \\, \\partial t} \\right|_{s=t=0} E(\\gamma + t\\varphi + s\\psi).</math>\n\nIn an appropriate sense, zeros of the second variation along a geodesic \u03b3 arise along [[Jacobi field]]s.  Jacobi fields are thus regarded as variations through geodesics.\n\nBy applying variational techniques from [[classical mechanics]], one can also regard [[geodesics as Hamiltonian flows]].  They are solutions of the associated [[Hamilton equation]]s, with (pseudo-)Riemannian metric taken as [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]].\n\n==Affine geodesics==\n{{See also|Geodesics in general relativity}}\nA '''geodesic''' on a [[Differentiable manifold|smooth manifold]]  ''M'' with an [[affine connection]]  \u2207 is defined as a [[curve]] \u03b3(''t'') such that [[parallel transport]] along the curve preserves the tangent vector to the curve, so\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> \\nabla_{\\dot\\gamma} \\dot\\gamma= 0</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nat each point along the curve,  where <math>\\dot\\gamma</math> is the derivative with respect to <math>t</math>.  More precisely, in order to define the covariant derivative of <math>\\dot\\gamma</math> it is necessary first to extend <math>\\dot\\gamma</math> to a continuously differentiable [[vector field]] in an [[open set]].  However, the resulting value of ({{EquationNote|1}}) is independent of the choice of extension.\n\nUsing [[local coordinates]] on ''M'', we can write the '''geodesic equation''' (using the [[summation convention]]) as\n:<math>\\frac{d^2\\gamma^\\lambda }{dt^2} + \\Gamma^{\\lambda}_{\\mu \\nu }\\frac{d\\gamma^\\mu }{dt}\\frac{d\\gamma^\\nu }{dt} = 0\\ ,</math>\nwhere <math>\\gamma^\\mu = x^\\mu \\circ \\gamma (t)</math> are the coordinates of the curve \u03b3(''t'') and <math>\\Gamma^{\\lambda }_{\\mu \\nu }</math> are the [[Christoffel symbol]]s of the connection \u2207.  This is an [[ordinary differential equation]] for the coordinates.  It has a unique solution, given an initial position and an initial velocity.  Therefore, from the point of view of [[classical mechanics]], geodesics can be thought of as trajectories of [[free particle]]s in a manifold. Indeed, the equation <math> \\nabla_{\\dot\\gamma} \\dot\\gamma= 0</math> means that the [[Acceleration (differential geometry)|acceleration vector]] of the curve has no components in the direction of the surface (and therefore it is perpendicular to the tangent plane of the surface at each point of the curve). So, the motion is completely determined by the bending of the surface. This is also the idea of general relativity where particles move on geodesics and the bending is caused by the gravity.\n\n===Existence and uniqueness===\nThe ''local existence and uniqueness theorem'' for geodesics states that geodesics on a smooth manifold with an [[affine connection]] exist, and are unique.  More precisely:\n\n:For any point ''p'' in ''M'' and for any vector ''V'' in ''T<sub>p</sub>M'' (the [[tangent space]] to ''M'' at ''p'') there exists a unique geodesic <math>\\gamma \\,</math> : ''I'' &rarr; ''M'' such that\n::<math>\\gamma(0) = p \\,</math> and\n::<math>\\dot\\gamma(0) = V,</math>\n:where ''I'' is a maximal [[open interval]] in '''R''' containing 0.\n\nThe proof of this theorem follows from the theory of  [[ordinary differential equation]]s, by noticing that the geodesic equation is a second-order ODE. Existence and uniqueness then follow from the [[Picard&ndash;Lindel\u00f6f theorem]] for the solutions of ODEs with prescribed initial conditions. \u03b3 depends [[smooth function|smoothly]] on both ''p'' and&nbsp;''V''.  \n\nIn general, ''I'' may not be all of '''R''' as for example for an open disc in '''R'''<sup>2</sup>. Any {{mvar|\u03b3}} extends to all of {{mvar|\u211d}} if and only if {{mvar|M}} is [[geodesic manifold|geodesically complete]].\n\n===Geodesic flow===\nGeodesic [[Flow (mathematics)|flow]] is a local '''R'''-[[Group action (mathematics)|action]] on the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM'' of a manifold ''M'' defined in the following way\n\n:<math>G^t(V)=\\dot\\gamma_V(t)</math>\n\nwhere ''t''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''R''', ''V''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''TM'' and <math>\\gamma_V</math> denotes the geodesic with initial data <math>\\dot\\gamma_V(0)=V</math>. Thus,  ''<math>G^t</math>''(''V'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;exp(''tV'') is the [[exponential map (Riemannian geometry)|exponential map]] of the vector ''tV''.  A closed orbit of the geodesic flow corresponds to a [[closed geodesic]] on&nbsp;''M''.\n\nOn a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold, the geodesic flow is identified with a [[Hamiltonian flow]] on the cotangent bundle.  The [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] is then given by the inverse of the (pseudo-)Riemannian metric, evaluated against the [[canonical one-form]]. In particular the flow preserves the (pseudo-)Riemannian metric <math>g</math>, i.e.\n\n: <math>g(G^t(V),G^t(V))=g(V,V). \\, </math>\n\nIn particular, when ''V'' is a unit vector, <math>\\gamma_V</math> remains unit speed throughout, so the geodesic flow is tangent to the [[unit tangent bundle]].  [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]] implies invariance of a kinematic measure on the unit tangent bundle.\n\n===Geodesic spray===\nThe geodesic flow defines a family of curves in the [[tangent bundle]]. The derivatives of these curves define a [[vector field]]  on the [[total space]] of the tangent bundle, known as the [[spray (mathematics)|geodesic spray]].\n\nMore precisely, an affine connection gives rise to a splitting of the [[double tangent bundle]] TT''M'' into [[horizontal bundle|horizontal]] and [[vertical bundle]]s:\n:<math>TTM = H\\oplus V.</math>\nThe geodesic spray is the unique horizontal vector field ''W'' satisfying\n:<math>\\pi_* W_v = v\\,</math>\nat each point ''v''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;T''M''; here \u03c0<sub>\u2217</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;TT''M''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;T''M'' denotes the [[pushforward (differential)]] along the projection \u03c0&nbsp;:&nbsp;T''M''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''M'' associated to the tangent bundle.\n\nMore generally, the same construction allows one to construct a vector field for any [[Ehresmann connection]] on the tangent bundle.  For the resulting vector field to be a spray (on the deleted tangent bundle T''M''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;{0}) it is enough that the connection be equivariant under positive rescalings: it need not be linear.  That is, (cf. [[Ehresmann connection#Vector bundles and covariant derivatives]]) it is enough that the horizontal distribution satisfy\n:<math>H_{\\lambda X} = d(S_\\lambda)_X H_X\\,</math>\nfor every ''X''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;T''M''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;{0} and \u03bb&nbsp;>&nbsp;0.  Here ''d''(''S''<sub>\u03bb</sub>) is the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] along the scalar homothety <math>S_\\lambda: X\\mapsto \\lambda X.</math>  A particular case of a non-linear connection arising in this manner is that associated to a [[Finsler manifold]].\n\n===Affine and projective geodesics===\nEquation ({{EquationNote|1}}) is invariant under affine reparameterizations; that is, parameterizations of the form\n:<math>t\\mapsto at+b</math>\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are constant real numbers. Thus apart from specifying a certain class of embedded curves, the geodesic equation also determines a preferred class of parameterizations on each of the curves. Accordingly, solutions of ({{EquationNote|1}}) are called geodesics with '''affine parameter'''.\n\nAn affine connection is ''determined by'' its family of affinely parameterized geodesics, up to [[torsion tensor|torsion]] {{harv|Spivak|1999|loc=Chapter 6, Addendum I}}.  The torsion itself does not, in fact, affect the family of geodesics, since the geodesic equation depends only on the symmetric part of the connection.  More precisely, if <math>\\nabla, \\bar{\\nabla}</math> are two connections such that the difference tensor\n:<math>D(X,Y) = \\nabla_XY-\\bar{\\nabla}_XY</math>\nis [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]], then <math>\\nabla</math> and <math>\\bar{\\nabla}</math> have the same geodesics, with the same affine parameterizations. Furthermore, there is a unique connection having the same geodesics as  <math>\\nabla</math>, but with vanishing torsion.\n\nGeodesics without a particular parameterization are described by a [[projective connection]].\n\n==Computational methods==\nEfficient solvers for the minimal geodesic problem on surfaces posed as [[eikonal equation]]s have been proposed by Kimmel and others.<ref>{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Kimmel |first2=A. |last2=Amir |first3=A.

The first installment in the ''[[Fatal Frame]]'' series, it released in 2001 in Japan and 2002 in North America and Europe. An enhanced port for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] was released in 2002 in North America and 2003 in Japan and Europe. The game was published for both systems by Tecmo in Japan and North America. In Europe, the PlayStation 2 version was published by [[Wanadoo]], and the Xbox version by [[Microsoft]]. It was re-released in North America on the [[PlayStation Network]] in 2013.\n\nSet in the year 1986, the story follows siblings Miku and Mafuyu Hinasaki. When Mafuyu disappears while searching for a famous novelist in the haunted Himuro Mansion, his sister Miku goes to find him. During her exploration of the mansion, she discovers clues as to the fate of those who entered, must fight hostile ghosts, and discover the truth behind a dark ritual that took place there. The gameplay focuses on the siblings exploring the mansion, and fighting off hostile ghosts using a special camera.\n\nDevelopment began after the PlayStation 2 hardware was introduced to Tecmo, using the codename \"''Project Zero''\". The concept was created by [[Makoto Shibata]] based on his own spiritual experiences. Together with producer Keisuke Kikuchi, Shibata worked on creating the scariest gaming experience possible. Multiple aspects of its style and production were influenced by this development wish. First announced in 2001 under its working title, it was eventually announced for release in Western territories a month after its Japanese release, where it was marketed as being based on a true story. The game received generally positive reviews, while the port drew praise for its improved visuals. As of 2015, four more games in the ''[[Fatal Frame]]'' series have been released.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{Further|Fatal Frame#Series gameplay}}\n[[File:Fatal Frame (Project Zero) Gameplay - Battle.jpg|left|thumb|A battle with a hostile ghost, with the main character viewing it through the Camera Obscura. Miku's health, the camera ammunition, and ghost indicator are shown.]]\n''Fatal Frame / Project Zero'' is a [[survival horror]] video game set within an abandoned Japanese mansion, divided into four chapters and a prologue which act as levels and tutorial respectively. The player controls Miku Hinasaki for the majority of the game, with its opening featuring Miku's brother Mafuyu as the player character. Each part of the mansion includes a map of its layout, and each level is rendered in real-time instead of using pre-rendered backgrounds.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> During navigation, players guide the characters through multiple rooms, each with a semi-fixed camera perspective that changes depending on a character's position. Environments are invariably dark, with exploration being possible through the use of a flashlight. During exploration, various items can be found scattered through environments: these include documents and [[Compact Cassette|cassette recordings]] expanding on elements of the story, health items, and other objects. In some areas, the main character must also solve puzzles to progress. Progress is saved at savepoints through the mansion, and at the end of each chapter.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/><ref name=\"GSpyReview\"/><ref name=\"GSreviewPS2\"/><ref>{{cite book | title=Project Zero PlayStation 2 Instruction Manual ''(UK)'' | year=2003| publisher=[[Wanadoo]] | chapter=Save/Load | page=20 | id=SLES-50821}}</ref>\n\nHostile ghosts can only be fought using the Camera Obscura, an antique camera that can capture ghosts. Ghosts in environments are sensed using a character's \"sixth sense\", and will drain a character's health on contact. When using the Camera, the view switches to a first-person view: the Camera Obscura is moved with the right analog stick on a controller, while the character can be moved with the left stick while maintaining a view through the Camera. Holding a ghost in view enables greater damage, but ghosts fade in and out of view as they approach. The most damage is dealt when the ghost is very close. The amount of damage taken is converted into points, which are used to upgrade the camera for faster reload time or greater damage with each shot, or adding secondary powers such as staggering ghosts when shooting them. Points are also gained by photographing benign ghosts that appear in set spots around the mansion.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/><ref name=\"GSpyReview\"/><ref name=\"GSreviewPS2\"/><ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/> Film, the Camera's ammunition, can be found throughout the mansion or be replenished at a save point: it comes in various grades, with higher-quality grades dealing higher damage while consequently being rarer.<ref>{{cite book | title=Project Zero PlayStation 2 Instruction Manual ''(UK)'' | year=2003| publisher=[[Wanadoo]] | chapter=Item Descriptions | page=30 | id=SLES-50821}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe story, set in the year 1986,<ref>{{cite video game|title=Fatal Frame / Project Zero |developer=[[Tecmo]]|publisher=Tecmo / [[Wanadoo]]|scene=|level=Intro: Himuro|date=4 March 2002 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|quote=}}</ref> focuses on Miku and Mafuyu Hinasaki, siblings with the ability to see supernatural events.

Further exploration through the mansion turns up information on a dark ritual that took place within Himuro Mansion: a chosen shrine maiden was torn apart using ropes attached to her limbs and neck in the so-called \"Strangling Ritual\", then the ropes that killed her were used to seal the Hell Gate, a portal to the afterlife that keeps a dark force known as \"the Malice\" and the dead from escaping into the living world.<ref name= \"FFstory\">{{cite book |script-title=ja:\u96f6(zero) \u96f6~\u7d05\u3044\u8776~\u6050\u6016\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u6028\u970a\u306e\u523b|publisher=[[Jitsugyo no Nihon Sha]] |isbn=978-4408616230 |date=17 June 2004|pages=36\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThe last time the ritual was performed, the sacrifice was Kirie Himuro. Shortly before she took part in the ritual, she fell in love with a visitor to the mansion. Fearing that Kirie would not want to perform the ritual, the Master of the Himuro Mansion has the visitor killed and lies to Kirie, telling her that the visitor has left. However, she does find out the visitor's fate and as feared does not want to perform the ritual. This caused the ritual to fail and the Malice to leak out, killing everyone in Himuro Mansion and causing the ghosts to remain there and attack anyone who explored there. Mafuyu was captured by Kirie due to his resemblance to her lover. Miku finally reaches the chamber of the Hell Gate, where she confronts Kirie's corrupted spirit. With her spirit calmed using an artifact called the Holy Mirror, Kirie accepts her duty as the Rope Shrine Maiden, keeping the Malice at bay for eternity.<ref name= \"FFstory\"/> The ending then diverges depending on the game's difficulty. In the \"Normal Mode\" ending, Mafuyu stays behind with Kirie to keep her spirit company while Miku escapes the mansion. In the \"Hard Mode\" ending, Kirie convinces Mafuyu to escape with his sister. In both endings, the spirits trapped in the mansion are freed, while Miku loses her sixth sense.<ref>{{cite book |script-title=ja:\u96f6(zero) \u96f6~\u7d05\u3044\u8776~\u6050\u6016\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u6028\u970a\u306e\u523b|publisher=[[Jitsugyo no Nihon Sha]] |isbn=978-4408616230 |date=17 June 2004|pages=42\u201343}} [http://fftranslations.atspace.co.uk/fbendingff.html Translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709151937/http://fftranslations.atspace.co.uk/fbendingff.html |date=2015-07-09 }}</ref> A third ending, exclusive to the Xbox version, sees the spirits of Kirie's lover returning to her while Miku and Mafuyu escape.

The concept came to Shibata inspired by his own dreams and encounters with what he felt were supernatural occurrences.<ref name=\"PlayStationShibata\"/> Development began when the [[PlayStation 2]] hardware was first introduced to Tecmo, under the codename \"Project Zero\". One of the things they drew inspiration from was the positive reception of polygon characters in the ''[[Silent Hill]]'' series, using this to go a step further and create the sense of seeing things off-screen. The ultimate goal was to create as frightening an atmosphere as possible.<ref name=\"PlayStationShibata\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/05/01/fatal-frame-behind-the-lens-of-the-ps2-horror-classic/|title=Fatal Frame: Behind the Lens of the PS2 Horror Classic|last=Shibata|first=Makoto|publisher=[[PlayStation Blog]]|date=1 May 2013|access-date=21 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003024408/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/05/01/fatal-frame-behind-the-lens-of-the-ps2-horror-classic/|archive-date=3 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The staff included multiple developers from the ''Deception'' series.<ref name=\"ZeroKikuchi\"/> According to character designer and CGI director Jin Hasegawa, the game's key colors are black and white: white represented hope, while black represented fear. During early development, a large amount of effort went into adjusting the lighting and shading, with the most obvious in-game representation of the key colors and desired effect being Miku's torch piercing the darkness inside the mansion.<ref name= \"ZeroGuide\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tecmo.co.jp/product/zero/zero_staff_c3.htm|script-title=ja:\u9577\u8c37\u5ddd\u4ec1 - \u767d\u3068\u9ed2|publisher=Zero Japanese Website|date=2002|access-date=27 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041206214849/http://www.tecmo.co.jp/product/zero/zero_staff_c3.htm|archive-date=6 December 2004|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition to black and white, a third key color represented through Miku's clothing was red, representing life.<ref name=\"ZeroKikuchi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tecmo.co.jp/product/zero/zero_staff_i1.htm|script-title=ja:\u83ca\u5730\u5553\u4ecb \u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc|publisher=Zero Japanese Website|date=2002|access-date=24 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617030302/http://www.tecmo.co.jp/product/zero/zero_staff_i1.htm|archive-date=17 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The composer and sound director was Shigekiyo Okuda. During the concept development, one of the main concepts was using [[stereophonic sound]] to reinforce the atmosphere. Due to the nature of the project, Okuda considered it important that they convey a three-dimensional feeling using sound projected from both left and right. After testing out multiple middleware and commercial sound tools, the team settled on Arnis Sound Technologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tecmo.co.jp/product/zero/zero_staff_c9.htm|script-title=ja:\u5965\u7530\u91cd\u6e05 - \u97f3\u97ff\u6f14\u51fa\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066|publisher=Zero Japanese Website|date=2002|access-date=27 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307215633/http://www.tecmo.co.jp/product/zero/zero_staff_c9.htm|archive-date=7 March 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe setting of the game in a classical Japanese mansion originated from Shibata's early ideas for settings within the ''Deception'' series, although these ideas were passed over as it limited the possibilities for the series' trap-setting gameplay.<ref name= \"ZeroMaking\">{{cite book |script-title=ja:\u96f6(zero) \u96f6~\u7d05\u3044\u8776~\u6050\u6016\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u6028\u970a\u306e\u523b|publisher=[[Jitsugyo no Nihon Sha]] |isbn=978-4408616230 |date=17 June 2004|pages=78\u201382}}</ref> When creating the atmosphere, the team watched both high and low-budget Japanese horror films, and war films.<ref name= \"ZeroStaffInterview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tecmo.co.jp/product/zero/zero_staff_id1.htm|script-title=ja:\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30d5\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u300e\u96f6\u304c\u751f\u307e\u308c\u305f\u7406\u7531\u300f|trans-title=Staff Interview: Why Zero Was Born|publisher=Zero Japanese Website|date=2002|access-date=21 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619145008/http://www.tecmo.co.jp/product/zero/zero_staff_id1.htm|archive-date=19 June 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The story was the first part of the game to be completed.<ref name= \"ZeroMaking\"/> The setting was originally going to be in the then-present day, but as the team wanted to create a feeling of isolation through a lack of modern technology such as mobile phones, the setting was changed to the 1980s.<ref name= \"ZeroGuide\">{{cite book |script-title=ja:\u96f6\u2010zero\u2010\u30d1\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9|publisher=[[SoftBank|SoftBank Creative]] |isbn=978-4797318722 |date=January 2001|pages=146\u2013151}}</ref> Some scenes were considered too graphic for the game and were cut: two cited examples were a flashback showing the head of the Himuro house committing [[seppuku]], and another was a scene showing Kirie being torn apart during the Strangling Ritual.

Ultimately, they decided to have a type of offensive power, which resulted in the Camera's creation.

The first installment in the ''[[Fatal Frame]]'' series, it released in 2001 in Japan and 2002 in North America and Europe. An enhanced port for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] was released in 2002 in North America and 2003 in Japan and Europe. The game was published for both systems by Tecmo in Japan and North America. In Europe, the PlayStation 2 version was published by [[Wanadoo]], and the Xbox version by [[Microsoft]]. It was re-released in North America on the [[PlayStation Network]] in 2013.\n\nSet in the year 1986, the story follows siblings Miku and Mafuyu Hinasaki. When Mafuyu disappears while searching for a famous novelist in the haunted Himuro Mansion, his sister Miku goes to find him. During her exploration of the mansion, she discovers clues as to the fate of those who entered, must fight hostile ghosts, and discover the truth behind a dark ritual that took place there. The gameplay focuses on the siblings exploring the mansion, and fighting off hostile ghosts using a special camera.\n\nDevelopment began after the PlayStation 2 hardware was introduced to Tecmo, using the codename \"''Project Zero''\". The concept was created by [[Makoto Shibata]] based on his own spiritual experiences. Together with producer Keisuke Kikuchi, Shibata worked on creating the scariest gaming experience possible. Multiple aspects of its style and production were influenced by this development wish. First announced in 2001 under its working title, it was eventually announced for release in Western territories a month after its Japanese release, where it was marketed as being based on a true story. The game received generally positive reviews, while the port drew praise for its improved visuals. As of 2015, four more games in the ''[[Fatal Frame]]'' series have been released.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{Further|Fatal Frame#Series gameplay}}\n[[File:Fatal Frame (Project Zero) Gameplay - Battle.jpg|left|thumb|A battle with a hostile ghost, with the main character viewing it through the Camera Obscura. Miku's health, the camera ammunition, and ghost indicator are shown.]]\n''Fatal Frame / Project Zero'' is a [[survival horror]] video game set within an abandoned Japanese mansion, divided into four chapters and a prologue which act as levels and tutorial respectively. The player controls Miku Hinasaki for the majority of the game, with its opening featuring Miku's brother Mafuyu as the player character. Each part of the mansion includes a map of its layout, and each level is rendered in real-time instead of using pre-rendered backgrounds.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> During navigation, players guide the characters through multiple rooms, each with a semi-fixed camera perspective that changes depending on a character's position. Environments are invariably dark, with exploration being possible through the use of a flashlight. During exploration, various items can be found scattered through environments: these include documents and [[Compact Cassette|cassette recordings]] expanding on elements of the story, health items, and other objects. In some areas, the main character must also solve puzzles to progress. Progress is saved at savepoints through the mansion, and at the end of each chapter.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/><ref name=\"GSpyReview\"/><ref name=\"GSreviewPS2\"/><ref>{{cite book | title=Project Zero PlayStation 2 Instruction Manual ''(UK)'' | year=2003| publisher=[[Wanadoo]] | chapter=Save/Load | page=20 | id=SLES-50821}}</ref>\n\nHostile ghosts can only be fought using the Camera Obscura, an antique camera that can capture ghosts. Ghosts in environments are sensed using a character's \"sixth sense\", and will drain a character's health on contact. When using the Camera, the view switches to a first-person view: the Camera Obscura is moved with the right analog stick on a controller, while the character can be moved with the left stick while maintaining a view through the Camera. Holding a ghost in view enables greater damage, but ghosts fade in and out of view as they approach. The most damage is dealt when the ghost is very close. The amount of damage taken is converted into points, which are used to upgrade the camera for faster reload time or greater damage with each shot, or adding secondary powers such as staggering ghosts when shooting them. Points are also gained by photographing benign ghosts that appear in set spots around the mansion.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/><ref name=\"GSpyReview\"/><ref name=\"GSreviewPS2\"/><ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/> Film, the Camera's ammunition, can be found throughout the mansion or be replenished at a save point: it comes in various grades, with higher-quality grades dealing higher damage while consequently being rarer.<ref>{{cite book | title=Project Zero PlayStation 2 Instruction Manual ''(UK)'' | year=2003| publisher=[[Wanadoo]] | chapter=Item Descriptions | page=30 | id=SLES-50821}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe story, set in the year 1986,<ref>{{cite video game|title=Fatal Frame / Project Zero |developer=[[Tecmo]]|publisher=Tecmo / [[Wanadoo]]|scene=|level=Intro: Himuro|date=4 March 2002 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|quote=}}</ref> focuses on Miku and Mafuyu Hinasaki, siblings with the ability to see supernatural events.

Further exploration through the mansion turns up information on a dark ritual that took place within Himuro Mansion: a chosen shrine maiden was torn apart using ropes attached to her limbs and neck in the so-called \"Strangling Ritual\", then the ropes that killed her were used to seal the Hell Gate, a portal to the afterlife that keeps a dark force known as \"the Malice\" and the dead from escaping into the living world.<ref name= \"FFstory\">{{cite book |script-title=ja:\u96f6(zero) \u96f6~\u7d05\u3044\u8776~\u6050\u6016\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u6028\u970a\u306e\u523b|publisher=[[Jitsugyo no Nihon Sha]] |isbn=978-4408616230 |date=17 June 2004|pages=36\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThe last time the ritual was performed, the sacrifice was Kirie Himuro. Shortly before she took part in the ritual, she fell in love with a visitor to the mansion. Fearing that Kirie would not want to perform the ritual, the Master of the Himuro Mansion has the visitor killed and lies to Kirie, telling her that the visitor has left. However, she does find out the visitor's fate and as feared does not want to perform the ritual. This caused the ritual to fail and the Malice to leak out, killing everyone in Himuro Mansion and causing the ghosts to remain there and attack anyone who explored there. Mafuyu was captured by Kirie due to his resemblance to her lover. Miku finally reaches the chamber of the Hell Gate, where she confronts Kirie's corrupted spirit. With her spirit calmed using an artifact called the Holy Mirror, Kirie accepts her duty as the Rope Shrine Maiden, keeping the Malice at bay for eternity.<ref name= \"FFstory\"/> The ending then diverges depending on the game's difficulty. In the \"Normal Mode\" ending, Mafuyu stays behind with Kirie to keep her spirit company while Miku escapes the mansion. In the \"Hard Mode\" ending, Kirie convinces Mafuyu to escape with his sister. In both endings, the spirits trapped in the mansion are freed, while Miku loses her sixth sense.<ref>{{cite book |script-title=ja:\u96f6(zero) \u96f6~\u7d05\u3044\u8776~\u6050\u6016\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u6028\u970a\u306e\u523b|publisher=[[Jitsugyo no Nihon Sha]] |isbn=978-4408616230 |date=17 June 2004|pages=42\u201343}} [http://fftranslations.atspace.co.uk/fbendingff.html Translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709151937/http://fftranslations.atspace.co.uk/fbendingff.html |date=2015-07-09 }}</ref> A third ending, exclusive to the Xbox version, sees the spirits of Kirie's lover returning to her while Miku and Mafuyu escape.

The concept came to Shibata inspired by his own dreams and encounters with what he felt were supernatural occurrences.<ref name=\"PlayStationShibata\"/> Development began when the [[PlayStation 2]] hardware was first introduced to Tecmo, under the codename \"Project Zero\". One of the things they drew inspiration from was the positive reception of polygon characters in the ''[[Silent Hill]]'' series, using this to go a step further and create the sense of seeing things off-screen. The ultimate goal was to create as frightening an atmosphere as possible.<ref name=\"PlayStationShibata\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/05/01/fatal-frame-behind-the-lens-of-the-ps2-horror-classic/|title=Fatal Frame: Behind the Lens of the PS2 Horror Classic|last=Shibata|first=Makoto|publisher=[[PlayStation Blog]]|date=1 May 2013|access-date=21 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003024408/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/05/01/fatal-frame-behind-the-lens-of-the-ps2-horror-classic/|archive-date=3 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The staff included multiple developers from the ''Deception'' series.<ref name=\"ZeroKikuchi\"/> According to character designer and CGI director Jin Hasegawa, the game's key colors are black and white: white represented hope, while black represented fear.

During the concept development, one of the main concepts was using [[stereophonic sound]] to reinforce the atmosphere. Due to the nature of the project, Okuda considered it important that they convey a three-dimensional feeling using sound projected from both left and right. After testing out multiple middleware and commercial sound tools, the team settled on Arnis Sound Technologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tecmo.co.jp/product/zero/zero_staff_c9.htm|script-title=ja:\u5965\u7530\u91cd\u6e05 - \u97f3\u97ff\u6f14\u51fa\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066|publisher=Zero Japanese Website|date=2002|access-date=27 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307215633/http://www.tecmo.co.jp/product/zero/zero_staff_c9.htm|archive-date=7 March 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe setting of the game in a classical Japanese mansion originated from Shibata's early ideas for settings within the ''Deception'' series, although these ideas were passed over as it limited the possibilities for the series' trap-setting gameplay.<ref name= \"ZeroMaking\">{{cite book |script-title=ja:\u96f6(zero) \u96f6~\u7d05\u3044\u8776~\u6050\u6016\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u6028\u970a\u306e\u523b|publisher=[[Jitsugyo no Nihon Sha]] |isbn=978-4408616230 |date=17 June 2004|pages=78\u201382}}</ref> When creating the atmosphere, the team watched both high and low-budget Japanese horror films, and war films.<ref name= \"ZeroStaffInterview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tecmo.co.jp/product/zero/zero_staff_id1.htm|script-title=ja:\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30d5\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u300e\u96f6\u304c\u751f\u307e\u308c\u305f\u7406\u7531\u300f|trans-title=Staff Interview: Why Zero Was Born|publisher=Zero Japanese Website|date=2002|access-date=21 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619145008/http://www.tecmo.co.jp/product/zero/zero_staff_id1.htm|archive-date=19 June 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The story was the first part of the game to be completed.<ref name= \"ZeroMaking\"/> The setting was originally going to be in the then-present day, but as the team wanted to create a feeling of isolation through a lack of modern technology such as mobile phones, the setting was changed to the 1980s.<ref name= \"ZeroGuide\">{{cite book |script-title=ja:\u96f6\u2010zero\u2010\u30d1\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9|publisher=[[SoftBank|SoftBank Creative]] |isbn=978-4797318722 |date=January 2001|pages=146\u2013151}}</ref> Some scenes were considered too graphic for the game and were cut: two cited examples were a flashback showing the head of the Himuro house committing [[seppuku]], and another was a scene showing Kirie being torn apart during the Strangling Ritual.
