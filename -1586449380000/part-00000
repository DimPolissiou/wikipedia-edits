He wakes on the last day of his 7th grade year, a peaceful year at Meriwether College Prep. There he has become friends with Tyson, a homeless child that the school has taken on as a form of charity. In gym class, during a game of dodgeball, Percy is attacked by a gang of [[Laestrygonians]], but is saved by Tyson and Annabeth, who was on her way back to Camp Half-Blood after having dreams about the Camp in danger. The three take a magical taxi driven by the [[Graeae]] to Long Island. Upon reaching the camp, they see a group of campers lead by Clarisse LaRue battling a pair of [[Khalkotauroi|Colchis bulls]]. Tyson is granted permission to move past the camp's boundary in order to save Percy once again. It is revealed that he is a baby [[Cyclops]] and a half brother of Percy, as he is also a son of Poseidon. An unknown enemy has weakened the protective walls of Camp Half-Blood by poisoning the tree of the demigod Thalia, leaving the campers vulnerable to future monster attacks. Camp counsellor Chiron is accused of poisoning the tree and fired, though the only evidence against him is that his father is Kronos. Before leaving, Chiron notes that only the [[Golden Fleece]] could save the camp.\n\nDue to his charm and skill with a sword, [[Tantalus]] becomes the new camp counsellor. As a reward for winning the chariot race, Tantalus sends Clarisse LaRue to find the Golden Fleece and forbids anyone else from leaving camp without his permission. After having a talk with the god Hermes about the fate of his son Luke, Percy leaves camp with Annabeth and Tyson to find Grover. With the help of a hippocampus that Tyson names Rainbow, the trio reach the Princess Andromeda, a cruise ship filled with monsters and demigods that have allied with the titan Kronos. On the ship, they are captured by Luke Castellan, and learn that he is working to revive Kronos. The trio narrowly escapes on an emergency lifeboat, and take shelter in a hideout that Annabeth, Thalia, and Luke built as children. There, a hydra finds and attacks them, but they are saved by Clarisse on her ship the ''CSS Birmingham.''\n\nAnnabeth, Percy, and Tyson join Clarisse's quest and journey to the Bermuda Triangle (also known as Sea of Monsters). In order to enter the Sea of Monsters, the ship tries to pass between [[Charybdis]] and [[Scylla]], who attack and destroy it. It appears that Tyson and Clarisse are killed in action, so Percy and Annabeth board a life raft and head to the nearest island. Like Odysseus, after travelling through the narrow strait that Charybdis and Scylla guarded, the two land on the island of the witch-queen Circe. Realizing she has turned dozens of men into guinea pigs, they escape on the famous [[Queen Anne's Revenge|Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge]], a former pirate ship. Percy and Annabeth pass the Sirens, and Annabeth confesses her insecurities to Percy. They reach the island of Percy's half brother, the cyclops [[Polyphemus]]. Before journeying to the centre of the island, Percy and Annabeth meet Grover pretending to be a female cyclops to trick Polyphemus into not eating him. They also learn that Clarisse and Tyson are alive. They find the Golden Fleece and narrowly escape to the mainland while fighting Polyphemus. Percy gives the Golden Fleece to Clarisse as a token of friendship, as it was her quest. She takes a plane to Camp Half-Blood, but the others are soon captured by Luke Castellan. Percy manages to send a message to Camp Half-Blood in which Luke admits to poisoning the tree of Thalia. The elders see their mistake and reinstate Chiron as camp counsellor. When Luke finds out, he challenges Percy to a duel. As Luke was the best swordsman in camp before he left, he wins easily. As Luke is about to finish off Percy and the rest of the group, a group of centaurs called the Party Ponies, led by Chiron, appear and whisk the group to safety.

He wakes on the last day of his 7th grade year, a peaceful year at Meriwether College Prep. There he has become friends with Tyson, a homeless child that the school has taken on as a form of charity. In gym class, during a game of dodgeball, Percy is attacked by a gang of [[Laestrygonians]], but is saved by Tyson and Annabeth, who was on her way back to Camp Half-Blood after having dreams about the Camp in danger. The three take a magical taxi driven by the [[Graeae]] to Long Island. Upon reaching the camp, they see a group of campers lead by Clarisse LaRue battling a pair of [[Khalkotauroi|Colchis bulls]]. Tyson is granted permission to move past the camp's boundary in order to save Percy once again. It is revealed that he is a baby [[Cyclops]] and a half brother of Percy, as he is also a son of Poseidon. An unknown enemy has weakened the protective walls of Camp Half-Blood by poisoning the tree of the demigod Thalia, leaving the campers vulnerable to future monster attacks. Camp counsellor Chiron is accused of poisoning the tree and fired, though the only evidence against him is that his father is Kronos. Before leaving, Chiron notes that only the [[Golden Fleece]] could save the camp.\n\nDue to his charm and skill with a sword, [[Tantalus]] becomes the new camp counsellor. As a reward for winning the chariot race, Tantalus sends Clarisse LaRue to find the Golden Fleece and forbids anyone else from leaving camp without his permission. After having a talk with the god Hermes about the fate of his son Luke, Percy leaves camp with Annabeth and Tyson to find Grover. With the help of a hippocampus that Tyson names Rainbow, the trio reach the Princess Andromeda, a cruise ship filled with monsters and demigods that have allied with the titan Kronos. On the ship, they are captured by Luke Castellan, and learn that he is working to revive Kronos. The trio narrowly escapes on an emergency lifeboat, and take shelter in a hideout that Annabeth, Thalia, and Luke built as children. There, a hydra finds and attacks them, but they are saved by Clarisse on her ship the ''CSS Birmingham.''\n\nAnnabeth, Percy, and Tyson join Clarisse's quest and journey to the Bermuda Triangle (also known as Sea of Monsters). In order to enter the Sea of Monsters, the ship tries to pass between [[Charybdis]] and [[Scylla]], who attack and destroy it. It appears that Tyson and Clarisse are killed in action, so Percy and Annabeth board a life raft and head to the nearest island. Like Odysseus, after travelling through the narrow strait that Charybdis and Scylla guarded, the two land on the island of the witch-queen Circe. Realizing she has turned dozens of men into guinea pigs, they escape on the famous [[Queen Anne's Revenge|Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge]], a former pirate ship. Percy and Annabeth pass the Sirens, and Annabeth confesses her insecurities to Percy. They reach the island of Percy's half brother, the cyclops [[Polyphemus]]. Before journeying to the centre of the island, Percy and Annabeth meet Grover pretending to be a female cyclops to trick Polyphemus into not eating him. They also learn that Clarisse and Tyson are alive. They find the Golden Fleece and narrowly escape to the mainland while fighting Polyphemus. Percy gives the Golden Fleece to Clarisse as a token of friendship, as it was her quest. She takes a plane to Camp Half-Blood, but the others are soon captured by Luke Castellan. Percy manages to send a message to Camp Half-Blood in which Luke admits to poisoning the tree of Thalia. The elders see their mistake and reinstate Chiron as camp counsellor. When Luke finds out, he challenges Percy to a duel. As Luke was the best swordsman in camp before he left, he wins easily. As Luke is about to finish off Percy and the rest of the group, a group of centaurs called the Party Ponies, led by Chiron, appear and whisk the group to safety. The Golden Fleece is hung on the tree of Thalia, and the tree is cured. However, the Fleece's magic is too strong and resurrects Thalia, providing another possible demigod for the Great Prophecy.\n\n==Major characters==\n{{Main|List of Camp Half-Blood characters}}\n\n; [[Percy Jackson]]: The son of [[Poseidon]]; a 13-year-old [[demigod]] who goes to the island of [[Polyphemus]] in the [[Bermuda Triangle]] to find [[List of Camp Half-Blood characters#Grover Underwood|Grover]] and recover the [[Golden Fleece]].

He was also known by his [[nom de plume]] '''Nestor \u017du\u010dni''' as a [[war poet]].\n\n==Biography==\nVivid pictures of Proka Jovki\u0107's boyhood are to be found in the pages of his poems, published in Serbian newspapers in San Francisco before the First Balkan War of 1912. Born in Lali\u0107, Serbia, and spending most of his early years on its streets and on nearby farms, Jovki\u0107 saw little more of schools than two or three years at a Lali\u0107 grammar school but as a youth he enrolled at the [[Grandes \u00e9coles]] in Belgrade. While growing up he wanted to learn everything about life and that wanderlust took him across the Atlantic Ocean in 1903. Going there he was forced to work rather than study. That's where his real education came in work on ships and ranches and in roaming much of the United States and Canada as an itinerant worker.  It was from Ellis Island and New York City that he went to Oakland, California, and published his first poetry book under a pseudonym of Nestor \u017du\u010dni (Nestor the Embittered). Of all prominent Serbian writers of that period, only Proka Jovki\u0107 brought to his literary work so varied and adventurous a background.\n\nEarly resolved to be a poet and journalist, Jovki\u0107 found his best material in New York, Oakland, San Francisco, and Chicago. Distressed by the inequalities he found in the United States of America, Jovki\u0107 wrote a collection of poems, most of which he previously published in Serbian ethnic newspapers and magazines in San Francisco. That collection of poems was published under the penname of Nestor \u017du\u010dni (Nestor the Embittered). These were the poems of a rebellious worker who felt upon his own shoulders the exploitation of rough modern capitalism in America. His poetry was not of a very refined nature, but there was in it temperament, poetical force, and revolutionary spirit. He wrote enthusiastically in the San Francisco-based newspaper ''Srpska Nezavisnost'' (Serb Independence) about Archimandrite Sebastian Dabovich, a Serbian Orthodox missionary who was born in San Francisco in 1867. In New York City, he befriended the likes of [[Nikola Tesla]] and [[Mihailo Pupin]], the two most prominent Serbs of their day.

Much of his writing expressed the social protest reflected in this activity, notably Nestor \u017du\u010dni (Nestor the Embittered), his first book of collected poems.\n\nEncouraged by positive reviews of [[Jovan Skerli\u0107]] from back home (in [[Belgrade]]), he soon published his second book ''Poezije neba i zemlje'' (Poetry of Heaven and Earth, first published in San Francisco, 1910). After moving back to Serbia to join the army in the First Balkan War, he published his third and final poetry book -- ''Kniga borbe i \u017eivota'' (The Book of Battles and Life Struggles, 1912) in Serbia.

The epithet \u201cthe poet-torch\u201d underlines the character of his poetry; his work was greatly influenced by the tempestuous events at the turn of the century in his native land menaced by war. Under the impact of [[Maxim Gorki]] and owing to the resemblance of their lives, he coined the pseudonym Nestor \u017du\u0107ni (Nestor the Embittered), which denotes the bitterness of one's existence. (Some have unfairly compared him with [[Jack London]]). This literary Bohemian earned his bread first as a typographer and then as an editor of the daily Serb Independence in San Francisco. Creator of the new sensibility in patriotic poetry, his poems of exile and national struggle were enflamed. The literary revolt, pronounced in his verses, inspired the Promethean ''Pesme Nezadovoljnika i Roba'' (Poem to a Beggar).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Milutin Boji\u0107]]\n* [[Vladislav Petkovi\u0107 Dis]]\n* [[Milo\u0161 Crnjanski]]\n* [[Du\u0161an Vasiljev]]\n* [[Ljubomir Mici\u0107]],\n* [[Rastko Petrovi\u0107]]\n* [[Stanislav Vinaver]]\n* [[Branislav Milosavljevi\u0107]]\n\n==References==\n* [[Jovan Skerli\u0107]], ''Istorija nove srpske knji\u017eevnosti// (Belgrade, 1914 and 1921), page 465\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jovkic, Proka}}\n[[Category:1886 births]]\n[[Category:1915 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Od\u017eaci]]\n[[Category:Serbian male poets]]\n[[Category:Serbian journalists]]\n[[Category:Serbian soldiers]]\n[[Category:Deaths from typhus]]\n[[Category:Infectious disease deaths in Serbia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox person\n| name        = Proka Jovki\u0107\n| image       = \n| alt         = \n| caption     = \n| birth_name  = <!-- only use if different from name -->\n| birth_date  = {{Birth date|1886|08|27|df=yes}}\n| birth_place = [[Lali\u0107]], [[Austria-Hungary]]\n| death_date  = {{Death date and age|1915|04|27|1886|08|27|df=yes}}\n| death_place = [[Ni\u0161]], [[Kingdom of Serbia]]\n| death_cause = [[Typhus]]\n| nationality = Serbian\n| occupation  = Writer\n}}\n'''Proka Jovki\u0107''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]: \u041f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u0408\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0438\u045b; 27 August 1886 \u2013 27 April 1915) was a Serbian poet, journalist and soldier of the early part of the 20th century who lived and wrote in the [[United States of America]] (1903 to 1911), and in [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] from 1911 until his untimely death during the [[Great War]] of [[typhus]] in [[Ni\u0161]] in 1915. He was also known by his [[nom de plume]] '''Nestor \u017du\u010dni''' as a [[war poet]].\n\n==Biography==\nVivid pictures of Proka Jovki\u0107's boyhood are to be found in the pages of his poems, published in Serbian newspapers in San Francisco before the First Balkan War of 1912. Born in Lali\u0107, Serbia, and spending most of his early years on its streets and on nearby farms, Jovki\u0107 saw little more of schools than two or three years at a Lali\u0107 grammar school but as a youth he enrolled at the [[Grandes \u00e9coles]] in Belgrade. While growing up he wanted to learn everything about life and that wanderlust took him across the Atlantic Ocean in 1903. Going there he was forced to work rather than study. That's where his real education came in work on ships and ranches and in roaming much of the United States and Canada as an itinerant worker.  It was from Ellis Island and New York City that he went to Oakland, California, and published his first poetry book under a pseudonym of Nestor \u017du\u010dni (Nestor the Embittered). Of all prominent Serbian writers of that period, only Proka Jovki\u0107 brought to his literary work so varied and adventurous a background.\n\nEarly resolved to be a poet and journalist, Jovki\u0107 found his best material in New York, Oakland, San Francisco, and Chicago. Distressed by the inequalities he found in the United States of America, Jovki\u0107 wrote a collection of poems, most of which he previously published in Serbian ethnic newspapers and magazines in San Francisco. That collection of poems was published under the penname of Nestor \u017du\u010dni (Nestor the Embittered). These were the poems of a rebellious worker who felt upon his own shoulders the exploitation of rough modern capitalism in America. His poetry was not of a very refined nature, but there was in it temperament, poetical force, and revolutionary spirit. He wrote enthusiastically in the San Francisco-based newspaper ''Srpska Nezavisnost'' (Serb Independence) about Archimandrite Sebastian Dabovich, a Serbian Orthodox missionary who was born in San Francisco in 1867. In New York City, he befriended the likes of [[Nikola Tesla]] and [[Mihailo Pupin]], the two most prominent Serbs of their day. Jovki\u0107's output was soon eagerly sought by popular newspapers and magazines, and collected in book form.\n\nJovki\u0107's life as an itinerant worker had made him a rebel and study had made him a [[socialist]]. Much of his writing expressed the social protest reflected in this activity, notably Nestor \u017du\u010dni (Nestor the Embittered), his first book of collected poems.\n\nEncouraged by positive reviews of [[Jovan Skerli\u0107]] from back home (in [[Belgrade]]), he soon published his second book ''Poezije neba i zemlje'' (Poetry of Heaven and Earth, first published in San Francisco, 1910).
