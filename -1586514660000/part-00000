{"title_page": "Interferometric scattering microscopy", "text_new": "\n\nInterferometric Scattering (iSCAT) refers to a class of methods that detect and image a subwavelength object by interfering the light scattered by it with a reference light field. The underlying physics is shared by other conventional interferometric methods such as phase contrast or differential interference contrast, or reflection interference microscopy. The key feature of iSCAT is the detection of elastic scattering from subwavelength particles, also known as Rayleigh scattering, in addition to reflected or transmission signals from supra-wavelength objects. Typically, the challenge is the detection of tiny signals on top of large and complex, speckle-like backgrounds. iSCAT has been used to investigate nanoparticles such as viruses, proteins, lipid vesicles, DNA, exosomes, metal nanoparticles, semiconductor quantum dots, charge carriers and single organic molecules without the need for a fluorescent label.{{clear}}\n\n==Historical Background==\n[[File:ISCAT setup configurations.svg|thumb|507x507px|Typical iSCAT configurations where either the reflected light from the cover-slip (a, c) or the transmitted light through the sample (b, c) is used as a reference field.

He was the sixth son of [[Yixuan, Prince Chun|Prince Chun]], a paternal half-uncle of the [[Puyi|Xuantong Emperor]], a half first cousin of the [[Tongzhi Emperor]], and a paternal half-brother of the [[Guangxu Emperor]].\n\n==Life==\nZaixun was adopted into the lineage of his relative, [[Yizhi]] (\u5955\u8a8c; 1827\u20131850), because Yizhi had no son to succeed him. In 1887, he was made a [[Royal and noble ranks of the Qing dynasty#Male members|''buru bafen fuguo gong'']], and was subsequently promoted to [[Royal and noble ranks of the Qing dynasty#Male members|''feng'en fuguo gong'']] in 1889 and [[Royal and noble ranks of the Qing dynasty#Male members|''feng'en zhenguo gong'']] in 1890. In 1900, Zaixun's predecessor, [[Zaiyi]], who succeeded Yizhi as \"Prince Rui of the Second Rank\" (later renamed to \"Prince Duan of the Second Rank\"), was stripped off his title of nobility and exiled to [[Xinjiang]] for his role in the [[Boxer Rebellion]].

He started working on a sequel, ''[[Battle Royale II: Requiem]]'', but he died of [[prostate cancer]] on January 12, 2003, after shooting only one scene with Kitano. His son [[Kenta Fukasaku]], who wrote the screenplay for both films, completed the film in 2003.\n\n''Battle Royale'' became a cultural phenomenon, and has been highly influential in global [[popular culture]]. Since the film's release, the term \"[[battle royal]]e\" has been redefined to refer to a fictional narrative genre and/or mode of entertainment inspired by the film, where a select group of people are instructed to kill each other off until there is a triumphant survivor. It has inspired numerous media, including films, manga, anime, comics, visual novels, and video games; the [[battle royale game]] genre, for example, is named after the film.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nFollowing a major [[Lost Decade (Japan)|recession]], the [[Japanese government]] has passed the \"BR ACT\u201d to control Japan's unruly youth. Middle school student Shuya Nanahara copes with life after his father committed [[suicide in Japan|suicide]]. Noriko Nakagawa is the only student regularly attending class 3-B. Their teacher, Kitano, resigns after being wounded by Yoshitoki Kuninobu, Shuya's best friend.\n\nOne year later, class 3-B takes a field trip, but they are gassed and taken to a remote island. Kitano reappears surrounded by [[Japanese Self-Defense Forces|JSDF soldiers]], explaining to the class that they are chosen to participate in the annual Battle Royale as a result of the Act: they have three days to fight to the death until a victor emerges, while explosive collars will kill uncooperative students or those within daily \"danger zones\". Each student is provided rations, water, a map of the island, compass, flashlight, and a random weapon. Kitano personally kills two of the students for disobedience, one of them being Kuninobu, who dies from collar detonation.\n\nThe first six hours see twelve deaths, four by suicide, and eight caused by the desperate, psychotic Mitsuko Souma and psychopathic volunteer Kazuo Kiriyama. Transfer student Shogo Kawada lets Shuya go after killing one student, while Shuya accidentally kills a student, Oki, which is witnessed by Yuko Sakaki, while basketball player Shinji Mimura plots to hack into the military's computer system to disrupt the program. Amid shifting loyalties and violent confrontations, Shuya promises to keep Noriko safe as Yoshitoki secretly loved her. He carries her to a clinic, where Kawada reveals that he won a previous Battle Royale at the cost of his girlfriend, Keiko Onuki, whose death he seeks to avenge. When Kiriyama attacks, Shuya entrusts Kawada to protect Noriko and runs as a distraction. Shuya is wounded by  Kiriyama's [[Uzi]]. However, he is saved by Hiroki Sugimura, a martial artist who has recently had his friend Takako Chigusa die in his arms, and is on a personal mission to find his [[unrequited love]], Kayoko Kotohiki.\n\nShuya awakens in the island's lighthouse, bandaged by female class representative Yukie Utsumi, who has a crush on him. Five other girls are also hiding in the building, including Yuko, who attempts to poison Shuya out of fear of Shuya possibly killing them like he did Tatsumichi Oki. However, Yuka accidentally eats the food, leading to a shootout between the girls. Yuko is the only survivor; horrified and realizing her mistake, she apologizes to Shuya and commits suicide. Shuya finds Noriko and Kawada, and they set out to find Mimura.\n\nNow only ten players left, Hiroki is killed by Kotohiki, who is then killed by Mitsuko. Kiriyama kills Mitsuko with her own weapon, making Noriko the last surviving girl.  Mimura and two others, Yutaka Seto and Keita Iijima, infiltrate the military's computer system, but Kiriyama kills them, but not before Mirmura uses his homemade bomb to explode the base to hide all evidence. When Kawada, Noriko and Shuya arrive at the hackers' burning base, Kawada confronts and kills Kiriyama, who had his eyes burned out by the explosion, by detonating the collar with his shotgun, but in turn is seriously injured by Kiriyama's [[Uzi]].\n\nOn the morning of the final day, Kawada, aware of the collars' internal microphones, seemingly kills Shuya and Noriko by shooting them. Suspicious, Kitano ends the game and dismisses the troops, intent on personally killing the supposed victor. Kitano realizes that Kawada hacked the system months beforehand, and has disabled Shuya and Noriko's tracking devices. The three survivors confront Kitano in the headquarters, and he unveils a homemade painting of the massacred class depicting Noriko as the sole survivor. He reveals that he was unable to bear the hatred between him and his students, having been rejected by his daughter, and confesses that he always thought of Noriko as a daughter. He asks her to kill him, but Shuya shoots him after he threatens her with a gun. As he falls, Kitano shoots, revealing the gun to be a water pistol. Kitano's daughter calls him; after an argument, he shoots the phone with an actual gun before dying of his wounds.\n\nShuya, Noriko and Kawada leave the island on a boat, but Kawada dies from the injuries, happy that he found friendship. Shuya and Noriko are declared fugitive murderers, and are last seen on the run in the direction of [[Shibuya Station]]. Noriko gives Shuya the Seto Dragon Claw [[butterfly knife]] Kuninobu used to injure Kitano at the beginning of the film.

At that time, his class was made to work in a munitions factory. In July 1945, the factory came under artillery fire. The children could not escape so they dived under each other for cover. The surviving members of the class had to dispose of the corpses.

When the interviewer told Fukasaku that he asked the question specifically because of the word \"run\" in the concluding text, which the interviewer described as \"very positive\", Fukasaku explained that he developed the concept throughout the film. Fukasaku interpreted the interviewer's question as having \"a stronger meaning\" than \"a simple message.\" He further explained that the film simply contains his \"words to the next generation\", so the viewer should decide whether to take the words as advice or as a warning.<ref name=\"BRBritishInterview\"/><ref name=\"Midnighteyeint\">\"[http://www.midnighteye.com/interviews/kinji_fukasaku.shtml Kinji Fukasaku]\", ''Midnight Eye''</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe [[film score]] of ''Battle Royale'' was composed, arranged and conducted by [[Masamichi Amano]], performed by the [[Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra]] and features several pieces of [[Western classical music]] along with Amano's original compositions.

Unusually, the extra material includes scenes newly filmed after the release of the original. Inserted scenes include (but are not limited to):\n* Flashbacks to a basketball game which is used as a framework for the entire story.\n* A flashback that expands on a likely contributor to Mitsuko Souma's [[mental illness]] or sociopathy. She comes home from school to find her mother drunk with a strange man, who tries to molest her. She then pushes him down the staircase to his death.\n* Three epilogues (referred to as \"requiems\"). The first is an extension of the basketball scene, showing the students of Class 3-B winning their game. It also spotlights Mitsuko's apparent social anxiety and alienation from the classmates in 3-B. The second is a vision of Nobu telling Shuya to take care of Noriko (a replay of a hallucination seen earlier in the special version of the film). The third is a scene between Kitano and Noriko, who talk casually by a riverbank; parts of this scene (a dream sequence) also appear in the original version of the film, but with the dialogue muted whereas in the requiem it is audible and reveals a friendship or other relationship that may or may not have existed between Noriko and Kitano.\n* Added shots of the lighthouse after the shoot-out.\n* Added reaction shots in the classroom, and extensions to existing shots.\n* Extra CGI throughout the film.\n\n===3D theatrical re-release===\nThe film was released to theaters in [[3-D film|3D]] in Japan on November 20, 2010.

He started working on a sequel, ''[[Battle Royale II: Requiem]]'', but he died of [[prostate cancer]] on January 12, 2003, after shooting only one scene with Kitano. His son [[Kenta Fukasaku]], who wrote the screenplay for both films, completed the film in 2003.\n\n''Battle Royale'' became a cultural phenomenon, and has been highly influential in global [[popular culture]]. Since the film's release, the term \"[[battle royal]]e\" has been redefined to refer to a fictional narrative genre and/or mode of entertainment inspired by the film, where a select group of people are instructed to kill each other off until there is a triumphant survivor. It has inspired numerous media, including films, manga, anime, comics, visual novels, and video games; the [[battle royale game]] genre, for example, is named after the film.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nFollowing a major [[Lost Decade (Japan)|recession]], the [[Japanese government]] has passed the \"BR ACT\u201d to control Japan's unruly youth. Middle school student Shuya Nanahara copes with life after his father committed [[suicide in Japan|suicide]]. Noriko Nakagawa is the only student regularly attending class 3-B. Their teacher, Kitano, resigns after being wounded by Yoshitoki Kuninobu, Shuya's best friend.\n\nOne year later, class 3-B takes a field trip, but they are gassed and taken to a remote island. Kitano reappears surrounded by [[Japanese Self-Defense Forces|JSDF soldiers]], explaining to the class that they are chosen to participate in the annual Battle Royale as a result of the Act: they have three days to fight to the death until a victor emerges, while explosive collars will kill uncooperative students or those within daily \"danger zones\". Each student is provided rations, water, a map of the island, compass, flashlight, and a random weapon. Kitano personally kills two of the students for disobedience, one of them being Kuninobu, who dies from collar detonation.\n\nThe first six hours see twelve deaths, four by suicide, and eight caused by the desperate, psychotic Mitsuko Souma and psychopathic volunteer Kazuo Kiriyama. Transfer student Shogo Kawada lets Shuya go after killing one student, while Shuya accidentally kills a student, Oki, which is witnessed by Yuko Sakaki, while basketball player Shinji Mimura plots to hack into the military's computer system to disrupt the program. Amid shifting loyalties and violent confrontations, Shuya promises to keep Noriko safe as Yoshitoki secretly loved her. He carries her to a clinic, where Kawada reveals that he won a previous Battle Royale at the cost of his girlfriend, Keiko Onuki, whose death he seeks to avenge. When Kiriyama attacks, Shuya entrusts Kawada to protect Noriko and runs as a distraction. Shuya is wounded by  Kiriyama's [[Uzi]]. However, he is saved by Hiroki Sugimura, a martial artist who has recently had his friend Takako Chigusa die in his arms, and is on a personal mission to find his [[unrequited love]], Kayoko Kotohiki.\n\nShuya awakens in the island's lighthouse, bandaged by female class representative Yukie Utsumi, who has a crush on him. Five other girls are also hiding in the building, including Yuko, who attempts to poison Shuya out of fear of Shuya possibly killing them like he did Tatsumichi Oki. However, Yuka accidentally eats the food, leading to a shootout between the girls. Yuko is the only survivor; horrified and realizing her mistake, she apologizes to Shuya and commits suicide. Shuya finds Noriko and Kawada, and they set out to find Mimura.\n\nNow only ten players left, Hiroki is killed by Kotohiki, who is then killed by Mitsuko. Kiriyama kills Mitsuko with her own weapon, making Noriko the last surviving girl.  Mimura and two others, Yutaka Seto and Keita Iijima, infiltrate the military's computer system, but Kiriyama kills them, but not before Mirmura uses his homemade bomb to explode the base to hide all evidence. When Kawada, Noriko and Shuya arrive at the hackers' burning base, Kawada confronts and kills Kiriyama, who had his eyes burned out by the explosion, by detonating the collar with his shotgun, but in turn is seriously injured by Kiriyama's uzi.\n\nOn the morning of the final day, Kawada, aware of the collars' internal microphones, seemingly kills Shuya and Noriko by shooting them. Suspicious, Kitano ends the game and dismisses the troops, intent on personally killing the supposed victor. Kitano realizes that Kawada hacked the system months beforehand, and has disabled Shuya and Noriko's tracking devices. The three survivors confront Kitano in the headquarters, and he unveils a homemade painting of the massacred class depicting Noriko as the sole survivor. He reveals that he was unable to bear the hatred between him and his students, having been rejected by his daughter, and confesses that he always thought of Noriko as a daughter. He asks her to kill him, but Shuya shoots him after he threatens her with a gun. As he falls, Kitano shoots, revealing the gun to be a water pistol. Kitano's daughter calls him; after an argument, he shoots the phone with an actual gun before dying of his wounds.\n\nShuya, Noriko and Kawada leave the island on a boat, but Kawada dies from the injuries, happy that he found friendship. Shuya and Noriko are declared fugitive murderers, and are last seen on the run in the direction of [[Shibuya Station]].

The surviving members of the class had to dispose of the corpses.

When the interviewer told Fukasaku that he asked the question specifically because of the word \"run\" in the concluding text, which the interviewer described as \"very positive\", Fukasaku explained that he developed the concept throughout the film. Fukasaku interpreted the interviewer's question as having \"a stronger meaning\" than \"a simple message.\" He further explained that the film simply contains his \"words to the next generation\", so the viewer should decide whether to take the words as advice or as a warning.<ref name=\"BRBritishInterview\"/><ref name=\"Midnighteyeint\">\"[http://www.midnighteye.com/interviews/kinji_fukasaku.shtml Kinji Fukasaku]\", ''Midnight Eye''</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe [[film score]] of ''Battle Royale'' was composed, arranged and conducted by [[Masamichi Amano]], performed by the [[Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra]] and features several pieces of [[Western classical music]] along with Amano's original compositions.

Unusually, the extra material includes scenes newly filmed after the release of the original. Inserted scenes include (but are not limited to):\n* Flashbacks to a basketball game which is used as a framework for the entire story.\n* A flashback that expands on a likely contributor to Mitsuko Souma's [[mental illness]] or sociopathy. She comes home from school to find her mother drunk with a strange man, who tries to molest her. She then pushes him down the staircase to his death.\n* Three epilogues (referred to as \"requiems\"). The first is an extension of the basketball scene, showing the students of Class 3-B winning their game. It also spotlights Mitsuko's apparent social anxiety and alienation from the classmates in 3-B. The second is a vision of Nobu telling Shuya to take care of Noriko (a replay of a hallucination seen earlier in the special version of the film). The third is a scene between Kitano and Noriko, who talk casually by a riverbank; parts of this scene (a dream sequence) also appear in the original version of the film, but with the dialogue muted whereas in the requiem it is audible and reveals a friendship or other relationship that may or may not have existed between Noriko and Kitano.\n* Added shots of the lighthouse after the shoot-out.\n* Added reaction shots in the classroom, and extensions to existing shots.\n* Extra CGI throughout the film.\n\n===3D theatrical re-release===\nThe film was released to theaters in [[3-D film|3D]] in Japan on November 20, 2010.
