[[Richard Booth]] opened his first shop there in 1962, and by the 1970s Hay had gained the nickname \"The Town of Books\".  \n\n===Hay Festival===\n{{main|Hay Festival}}\nSince 1988, Hay-on-Wye has been the venue for a [[literary festival]], now sponsored by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, which draws a claimed 80,000 visitors over ten days at the end of May or beginning of June to see and hear big literary names from all over the world. An annual literature festival held in [[Hay-on-Wye]], [[Powys]], [[Wales]], for ten days from May to June. Devised by Norman, Rhoda and [[Peter Florence]] in 1988, the festival was described by [[Bill Clinton]] in 2001 as \"The [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] of the mind\". [[Tony Benn]] said: \"In my mind it's replaced Christmas\". Peter Florence continues to be director of the Festival.\n\nThe Festival is reported to have directly generated \u00a383 million in Hay-On-Wye's economy over the last ten years (2019). \n\nFrom its inception, the festival was held at a variety of venues around Hay, including the local Primary School, until 2005 when it moved to a unified location in the West of the town, as well as classical music concerts in St Mary's Church.\n\n==Location==\nThe town lies on the south-east bank of the [[River Wye]] and is within the north-easternmost tip of the [[Brecon Beacons National Park]], just north of the [[Black Mountains, Wales|Black Mountains]]. The town is just on the [[Wales-England border|Welsh side of the border]] with [[Herefordshire]], [[England]], here defined by the Dulas Brook. Where the brook joins the River Wye just north of the town, the border continues northwards along the river. The Wye was the boundary between the former counties and districts of [[Radnorshire]] and [[Brecknockshire]].\n\nThe adjacent village of [[Cusop]] lies on the English side of the Dulas Brook. The nearest city is [[Hereford]], [[county town]] of Herefordshire, some {{convert|22|mi|km}} to the east.\n\nThe Royal Mail depot in Hay is a sub-office of Hereford, and therefore although in Wales has an English postal address, being part of the HR3 postcode.\n[[File:Hayfestival-2016-welcomesign.jpg|thumb|Hay Festival welcome sign 2016|alt=]]\n\n==Governance==\nHay-on-Wye is a Welsh [[community (Wales)|community]] with a Town Council. Its boundary follows the English border/Dulas Brook from the River Wye southeastwards for just over a kilometre, turns south-west to a point just south of Oakfield house, thence north to Greenpit Farm and north westwards, enclosing the Hay Showground and meeting the National Park boundary near the B4350, Brecon Road. From this point, it follows the National Park boundary to the River Wye and the river back to the Dulas Brook.<ref name=ovw>{{cite web | title=Community and Town Council Boundaries | publisher=One Voice Wales | url=http://www.onevoicewales.org.uk/local_councils/index_html?set_language=en | accessdate=6 April 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302022128/http://www.onevoicewales.org.uk/local_councils/index_html?set_language=en | archivedate=2 March 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Town Council consists of a Mayor, Deputy Mayor and eight councillors.<ref>{{cite web | title=List of Hay Town Council | publisher=Hay-on-Wye Town Council | work= | url=http://www.hay-on-wye.co.uk/council/ | date= | accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nHay also participates in the election of a councillor to Powys County Council as part of a larger county division.\n\n==Transportation==\nThe B4350 runs through the town and the B4351 links it with the main [[A438]] from Brecon to Hereford, on the far side of the River Wye. The town was formerly served at [[Hay-on-Wye railway station]] by the train services which closed in 1963 under the [[Beeching Axe]].{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nThere is a semi-regular bus that links Hay to Brecon (and then Cardiff) and to Hereford.\n\n==Other activities==\nHay Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1903. The club continued on its nine-hole course until the onset of World War 2.<ref>[http://www.golfsmissinglinks.co.uk/index.php/wales-64/1050-hay-golf-club \"Hay Golf Club\"], \"Golf\u2019s Missing Links\".</ref>\n\nThe town's football club is called Hay St. Mary's, and they currently play in the Spar Mid Wales League First Division.\n\nHay was named one of the best places to live in Wales in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=These towns have been named as the best places to live in Wales|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/towns-named-best-places-wales-12719747|publisher=Wales Online}}</ref>\n\n===HowTheLightGetsIn Festival===\n{{Main|HowTheLightGetsIn Festival}}\n[[File:HowTheLightGetsIn Festival Hay-on-Wye 2018 site.jpg|alt=HowTheLightGetsIn Festival, Hay-on-Wye, 2018|thumb|[[HowTheLightGetsIn Festival]], Hay-on-Wye, 2018]]\nHay also hosts the world\u2019s largest philosophy and music festival, HowTheLightGetsIn, which occurs annually in Hay-on-Wye in May. HowTheLightGetsIn attracts a footfall of over 30,000 each year. It aims \"to get philosophy out of the academy and into people's lives\" by bringing together philosophers, writers, academics, comedians and musicians for a festival of debate, talks, music, workshops, and late night parties.\n\nSpeakers at the festival have included [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Brian Eno]], [[Kimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw|Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw]], [[Philip Pullman]], [[Diane Abbott]], [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Laurie Penny]], among others. Music headliners have included [[Clean Bandit]], [[Hot Chip]], and [[Donovan]]. Comedians have included [[James Acaster]], [[Sara Pascoe|Sarah Pascoe]], and [[Phil Wang]].\n\n==History==\nHay-on-Wye, like [[Builth Wells]], has two [[Normans|Norman]] [[castle]]s within a short distance of each other. It seems likely that Hay was first fortified by [[William Fitzosbern, 1st Earl of Hereford|William Fitz Osbern]] during his [[Norman invasion of Wales|penetration]] of south-east Wales in the summer of 1070, when he defeated three Welsh kings. The history of the site then continues through the lordships of the de Neufmarch\u00e9s, which was confirmed at the Battle of [[Brecon]] in 1093, and also the Gloucester/Hereford families until 1165, when the district of [[Brycheiniog]] passed into the hands of the [[William de Braose, 1st Lord of Bramber|de Braose]] dynasty of [[Marcher Lord]]s. In 1230 Hay Castle passed to the de Bohuns and the local history, including the battle near Hay in 1231, is continued through the [[Mortimer]] Wars of the 1260s and the battle near Brecon in 1266 down to the death of Earl [[Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford|Humphrey de Bohun]] in 1298.\n\n===First castle===\nLying close to [[St Mary\u2019s Church, Hay-on-Wye|St Mary's Church]] on the western edge of Hay-on-Wye is a small but well-preserved [[motte-and-bailey|motte]]. The site overlooks a gorge and small stream, locally known as The Loggin Brook, that flows into the River Wye, which was undoubtedly one reason for the construction of a [[motte and bailey]] castle there. A recently levelled platform under the car park to the north east may have once have housed the castle's [[Ward (fortification)|bailey]]. This little fortress was probably the work of William Revel, a [[knight]] of [[Bernard de Neufmarch\u00e9]] who is usually referred to as Bernard Newmarch, and may later have been the seat for the [[manorialism|manor]] or [[commote]] of Melinog. Other than this, the motte has no further recorded history.\n\n===Stone castle===\n{{main|Hay Castle}}\nThe main fortress within Hay-on-Wye was situated on the great site commanding the town and river under the current ruins of the castle and [[mansion]]. This was undoubtedly the 'castello de haia' handed to [[Miles of Gloucester, 1st Earl of Hereford]], in 1121 with [[Sibyl de Neufmarch\u00e9]], the daughter of [[Bernard de Neufmarch\u00e9]]. It is most likely that the [[keep]] stood by this time. It is therefore possible that this is the oldest [[Norman architecture|Norman]] tower in Wales, dating to the onslaught of [[William Fitzosbern, 1st Earl of Hereford|William Fitz Osbern]] in 1070. During the [[anarchy]] (1136\u201354) in the reign of [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] a series of [[charter]]s were passed by the Gloucesters concerning the castle. In 1165 the last of Miles of Gloucester's male descendants was killed at nearby [[Bronllys Castle]] and Hay-on-Wye Castle passed into the hands of [[William de Braose, 3rd Lord of Bramber]] and of [[New Radnor]] and [[Buellt]]. The de Braose dynasty were energetic lords and probably built the core of the [[gatehouse]] which now stands besides the keep. In the summer of 1198 a major English army formed here before marching off to victory at the Battle of [[Painscastle]] some four miles to the north.\n\nIn 1230 the last de Braose of Brecon, [[William de Braose (died 1230)|William de Braose]] was hanged by Prince [[Llywelyn ab Iorwerth]] and Brecon lordship with Hay-on-Wye passed into the hands of the de Bohuns. Taking advantage of this in 1231, Prince Llywelyn ravaged the lands of his de Bohun in-laws during which Hay-on-Wye town was burnt, although the castle survived the onslaught. The castle saw service in the [[Second Barons' War|Barons' War]] of 1263 to 1266, changing hands three times, once being surrendered to the great [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester]]. With the conquest of Wales by [[Edward I of England|King Edward I Longshanks]] life became more peaceful in this [[Welsh Marches|Marcher]] town.\n\nAround 1401 both town and castle suffered damage by the forces of [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]], although the castle was listed as defensible against the Welsh in 1403. The fortress later passed to the [[Baron Stafford|earls of Stafford]], who were to become the unlucky [[Duke of Buckingham|dukes of Buckingham]] during the [[Wars of the Roses]]. The castle was repaired during the conflicts of the 1460s, although its military use would have been somewhat dubious against cannon.\n\nIn the 1660s, James Boyle of Hereford built a new mansion on the north side of the castle, and most of the curtain wall was demolished to improve the views. The mansion is now used for second-hand bookselling.\n\n===Remains of castle===\n[[File:Hay Castle - geograph.org.uk - 61858.jpg|thumb|left|Hay Castle and Mansion]]\nThe keep is roughly {{convert|30|ft|m|spell=in}} square, and once had four storeys. The corners of the tower have been much rebuilt, probably due to insecure foundations. The entire south east corner of the tower has been replaced and it is possible that when first constructed there was a spiral stair here to allow access to the upper floors. This tower is similar to the keep found at [[Goodrich Castle]].\n\nSome time in the 12th century the strong [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]] with gate was added to the site. This gateway is one of the finest carved castle gateways in Wales and is comparable with the much more ornate work at Newcastle near [[Bridgend]]. The two gates hanging within the gateway, although of different ages, would appear to be very old&nbsp;\u2014 the gates at [[Chepstow Castle]] have been [[dendrochronological]]ly dated to the reign of [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] (1154\u201389).\n\nProbably during the troubles of the [[Second Barons' War|Barons' War]] a small tower was added in front of the gateway to make a proper [[gatehouse]] complete with [[portcullis]]. The portcullis mechanism mounted on the wall walk was reached via a flight of steps up over the back of the gate passageway, which also allowed access to the wall walks.\n\nHay-on-Wye has a clock tower has an identical twin clock tower in [[Knighton, Powys|Knighton]]. \n[[File:Hay-on-Wye, Clock Tower.jpg|thumb|The Clock Tower, Hay]]\n\n==Twinning==\n\nHay-on-Wye is [[town twinning|twinned]] with [[Redu]], a village in the [[Municipalities of Belgium|Belgian municipality]] of [[Libin, Belgium|Libin]], and with [[Timbuktu]], [[Mali]], [[West Africa]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/mid/6337935.stm Hay-on-Wye is twinned with Timbuktu]\n, '''BBC News''', 7 February 2007, 15:53 GMT, accessed 8 February 2007.</ref>\n\n==King of Hay-on-Wye==\n[[File:Richard George William Pitt Booth.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Booth]] in 1984]]\nOn 1 April 1977, [[bibliophile]] [[Richard Booth]] conceived a publicity stunt in which he declared Hay-on-Wye to be an 'independent kingdom' with himself as its monarch and a National Anthem written by [[Les Penning]].

Peter Florence continues to be director of the Festival.\n\nThe Festival is reported to have directly generated \u00a383 million in Hay-On-Wye's economy over the last ten years (2019). \n\nFrom its inception, the festival was held at a variety of venues around Hay, including the local Primary School, until 2005 when it moved to a unified location in the West of the town, as well as classical music concerts in St Mary's Church.\n\n==Location==\nThe town lies on the south-east bank of the [[River Wye]] and is within the north-easternmost tip of the [[Brecon Beacons National Park]], just north of the [[Black Mountains, Wales|Black Mountains]]. The town is just on the [[Wales-England border|Welsh side of the border]] with [[Herefordshire]], [[England]], here defined by the Dulas Brook. Where the brook joins the River Wye just north of the town, the border continues northwards along the river. The Wye was the boundary between the former counties and districts of [[Radnorshire]] and [[Brecknockshire]].\n\nThe adjacent village of [[Cusop]] lies on the English side of the Dulas Brook. The nearest city is [[Hereford]], [[county town]] of Herefordshire, some {{convert|22|mi|km}} to the east.\n\nThe Royal Mail depot in Hay is a sub-office of Hereford, and therefore although in Wales has an English postal address, being part of the HR3 postcode.\n[[File:Hayfestival-2016-welcomesign.jpg|thumb|Hay Festival welcome sign 2016|alt=]]\n\n==Governance==\nHay-on-Wye is a Welsh [[community (Wales)|community]] with a Town Council. Its boundary follows the English border/Dulas Brook from the River Wye southeastwards for just over a kilometre, turns south-west to a point just south of Oakfield house, thence north to Greenpit Farm and north westwards, enclosing the Hay Showground and meeting the National Park boundary near the B4350, Brecon Road. From this point, it follows the National Park boundary to the River Wye and the river back to the Dulas Brook.<ref name=ovw>{{cite web | title=Community and Town Council Boundaries | publisher=One Voice Wales | url=http://www.onevoicewales.org.uk/local_councils/index_html?set_language=en | accessdate=6 April 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302022128/http://www.onevoicewales.org.uk/local_councils/index_html?set_language=en | archivedate=2 March 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Town Council consists of a Mayor, Deputy Mayor and eight councillors.<ref>{{cite web | title=List of Hay Town Council | publisher=Hay-on-Wye Town Council | work= | url=http://www.hay-on-wye.co.uk/council/ | date= | accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nHay also participates in the election of a councillor to Powys County Council as part of a larger county division.\n\n==Transportation==\nThe B4350 runs through the town and the B4351 links it with the main [[A438]] from Brecon to Hereford, on the far side of the River Wye. The town was formerly served at [[Hay-on-Wye railway station]] by the train services which closed in 1963 under the [[Beeching Axe]].{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nThere is a semi-regular bus that links Hay to Brecon (and then Cardiff) and to Hereford.\n\n==Other activities==\nHay Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1903.

HowTheLightGetsIn attracts a footfall of over 30,000 each year. It aims \"to get philosophy out of the academy and into people's lives\" by bringing together philosophers, writers, academics, comedians and musicians for a festival of debate, talks, music, workshops, and late night parties.\n\nSpeakers at the festival have included [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Brian Eno]], [[Kimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw|Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw]], [[Philip Pullman]], [[Diane Abbott]], [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Laurie Penny]], among others. Music headliners have included [[Clean Bandit]], [[Hot Chip]], and [[Donovan]]. Comedians have included [[James Acaster]], [[Sara Pascoe|Sarah Pascoe]], and [[Phil Wang]].\n\n==History==\nHay-on-Wye, like [[Builth Wells]], has two [[Normans|Norman]] [[castle]]s within a short distance of each other. It seems likely that Hay was first fortified by [[William Fitzosbern, 1st Earl of Hereford|William Fitz Osbern]] during his [[Norman invasion of Wales|penetration]] of south-east Wales in the summer of 1070, when he defeated three Welsh kings. The history of the site then continues through the lordships of the de Neufmarch\u00e9s, which was confirmed at the Battle of [[Brecon]] in 1093, and also the Gloucester/Hereford families until 1165, when the district of [[Brycheiniog]] passed into the hands of the [[William de Braose, 1st Lord of Bramber|de Braose]] dynasty of [[Marcher Lord]]s. In 1230 Hay Castle passed to the de Bohuns and the local history, including the battle near Hay in 1231, is continued through the [[Mortimer]] Wars of the 1260s and the battle near Brecon in 1266 down to the death of Earl [[Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford|Humphrey de Bohun]] in 1298.\n\n===First castle===\nLying close to [[St Mary\u2019s Church, Hay-on-Wye|St Mary's Church]] on the western edge of Hay-on-Wye is a small but well-preserved [[motte-and-bailey|motte]]. The site overlooks a gorge and small stream, locally known as The Loggin Brook, that flows into the River Wye, which was undoubtedly one reason for the construction of a [[motte and bailey]] castle there. A recently levelled platform under the car park to the north east may have once have housed the castle's [[Ward (fortification)|bailey]]. This little fortress was probably the work of William Revel, a [[knight]] of [[Bernard de Neufmarch\u00e9]] who is usually referred to as Bernard Newmarch, and may later have been the seat for the [[manorialism|manor]] or [[commote]] of Melinog. Other than this, the motte has no further recorded history.\n\n===Stone castle===\n{{main|Hay Castle}}\nThe main fortress within Hay-on-Wye was situated on the great site commanding the town and river under the current ruins of the castle and [[mansion]]. This was undoubtedly the 'castello de haia' handed to [[Miles of Gloucester, 1st Earl of Hereford]], in 1121 with [[Sibyl de Neufmarch\u00e9]], the daughter of [[Bernard de Neufmarch\u00e9]]. It is most likely that the [[keep]] stood by this time. It is therefore possible that this is the oldest [[Norman architecture|Norman]] tower in Wales, dating to the onslaught of [[William Fitzosbern, 1st Earl of Hereford|William Fitz Osbern]] in 1070. During the [[anarchy]] (1136\u201354) in the reign of [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] a series of [[charter]]s were passed by the Gloucesters concerning the castle. In 1165 the last of Miles of Gloucester's male descendants was killed at nearby [[Bronllys Castle]] and Hay-on-Wye Castle passed into the hands of [[William de Braose, 3rd Lord of Bramber]] and of [[New Radnor]] and [[Buellt]]. The de Braose dynasty were energetic lords and probably built the core of the [[gatehouse]] which now stands besides the keep. In the summer of 1198 a major English army formed here before marching off to victory at the Battle of [[Painscastle]] some four miles to the north.\n\nIn 1230 the last de Braose of Brecon, [[William de Braose (died 1230)|William de Braose]] was hanged by Prince [[Llywelyn ab Iorwerth]] and Brecon lordship with Hay-on-Wye passed into the hands of the de Bohuns. Taking advantage of this in 1231, Prince Llywelyn ravaged the lands of his de Bohun in-laws during which Hay-on-Wye town was burnt, although the castle survived the onslaught. The castle saw service in the [[Second Barons' War|Barons' War]] of 1263 to 1266, changing hands three times, once being surrendered to the great [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester]]. With the conquest of Wales by [[Edward I of England|King Edward I Longshanks]] life became more peaceful in this [[Welsh Marches|Marcher]] town.\n\nAround 1401 both town and castle suffered damage by the forces of [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]], although the castle was listed as defensible against the Welsh in 1403. The fortress later passed to the [[Baron Stafford|earls of Stafford]], who were to become the unlucky [[Duke of Buckingham|dukes of Buckingham]] during the [[Wars of the Roses]]. The castle was repaired during the conflicts of the 1460s, although its military use would have been somewhat dubious against cannon.\n\nIn the 1660s, James Boyle of Hereford built a new mansion on the north side of the castle, and most of the curtain wall was demolished to improve the views. The mansion is now used for second-hand bookselling.\n\n===Remains of castle===\n[[File:Hay Castle - geograph.org.uk - 61858.jpg|thumb|left|Hay Castle and Mansion]]\nThe keep is roughly {{convert|30|ft|m|spell=in}} square, and once had four storeys. The corners of the tower have been much rebuilt, probably due to insecure foundations. The entire south east corner of the tower has been replaced and it is possible that when first constructed there was a spiral stair here to allow access to the upper floors. This tower is similar to the keep found at [[Goodrich Castle]].\n\nSome time in the 12th century the strong [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]] with gate was added to the site. This gateway is one of the finest carved castle gateways in Wales and is comparable with the much more ornate work at Newcastle near [[Bridgend]]. The two gates hanging within the gateway, although of different ages, would appear to be very old&nbsp;\u2014 the gates at [[Chepstow Castle]] have been [[dendrochronological]]ly dated to the reign of [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] (1154\u201389).\n\nProbably during the troubles of the [[Second Barons' War|Barons' War]] a small tower was added in front of the gateway to make a proper [[gatehouse]] complete with [[portcullis]]. The portcullis mechanism mounted on the wall walk was reached via a flight of steps up over the back of the gate passageway, which also allowed access to the wall walks.\n\nHay-on-Wye has a clock tower has an identicle twin clock tower in [[Knighton, Powys|Knighton]]. \n[[File:Hay-on-Wye, Clock Tower.jpg|thumb|The Clock Tower, Hay]]\n\n==Twinning==\n\nHay-on-Wye is [[town twinning|twinned]] with [[Redu]], a village in the [[Municipalities of Belgium|Belgian municipality]] of [[Libin, Belgium|Libin]], and with [[Timbuktu]], [[Mali]], [[West Africa]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/mid/6337935.stm Hay-on-Wye is twinned with Timbuktu]\n, '''BBC News''', 7 February 2007, 15:53 GMT, accessed 8 February 2007.</ref>\n\n==King of Hay-on-Wye==\n[[File:Richard George William Pitt Booth.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Booth]] in 1984]]\nOn 1 April 1977, [[bibliophile]] [[Richard Booth]] conceived a publicity stunt in which he declared Hay-on-Wye to be an 'independent kingdom' with himself as its monarch and a National Anthem written by [[Les Penning]].

{"title_page": "Infantry of the British Army", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n{{British Army Arms}}\n[[File:British Army Infantry Recruiting areas.png|thumb|right|Recruiting areas of British line infantry regiments]]\nThe '''Infantry of the British Army''', part of the [[Structure of the British Army|structure]] of the [[British Army]], comprises 49 [[infantry]] [[battalion]]s, from 19 [[regiment]]s. Of these, 33 battalions are part of the [[Standing army|Regular army]] and the remaining 16 a part of the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]]. The British Army's Infantry forms a highly flexible organisation, taking on a variety of roles, including armoured, [[Mechanized infantry|mechanised]], [[air assault]] and [[Light infantry|light]].\n\n==Recruitment and training==\n===Recruitment===\nTraditionally, regiments that form the combat arms of the British Army (cavalry and infantry) recruit from specific areas of the country. Infantry regiments had been assigned specific areas from which they would recruit from by the mid eighteenth century. These were formalised under the [[Cardwell Reforms]] that began in the 1860s. Under this scheme, single battalion infantry regiments were amalgamated into two battalion regiments, then assigned to a depot and associated recruiting area (which would usually correspond to all or part of a county). The recruiting area (usually) would then become part of the regiment's title. It was this that gave rise to the concept of the \"county regiment\", with the local infantry regiment becoming part of the fabric of its local area.\n\nOver time, regiments have been amalgamated further, which has led to recruiting areas of individual regiments increasing in size. Often, these amalgamations have been between regiments whose recruiting areas border each other. However, there have been occasions where regiments of a similar type, but from widely different areas, have been amalgamated. Two modern examples have been the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (amalgamated from the county regiments of Northumberland, Warwickshire, [[City of London]] and Lancashire, all of which were regiments of [[fusiliers]]) and The Light Infantry (amalgamated from the county regiments of Cornwall, Somerset, Shropshire, South Yorkshire and Durham, all of which were regiments of [[light infantry]]).\n\nSince September 2007, when the most recent reforms were completed, the infantry has consisted of 18 separate regiments. The five regiments of foot guards recruit from their respective [[home nations]] (with the exception of the Coldstream Guards, which recruits from the counties through which the regiment marched between Coldstream and London). Scotland, Ireland and Wales each have a single regiment of [[line infantry]] from which they recruit (though the battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland recruit from the areas they recruited from when they were separate regiments), while England has seven line infantry and rifles regiments. The Parachute Regiment recruits nationally, while the Royal Gurkha Rifles recruits most of its serving personnel from [[Nepal]], and the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]] recruits from the [[UK]] and [[Commonwealth nations]]\n\nBefore the [[Second World War]], infantry recruits were required to be at least {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall. They initially enlisted for seven years with the colours and a further five years with the reserve. They trained at their own regimental depot.<ref>[[War Office]], ''His Majesty's Army'', 1938</ref>\n\n===Training===\nUnlike the other trades in the army, which have separate units for basic training and specialised training, new recruits into the infantry undergo a single course at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre Catterick]]. This course, called the \"Combat Infantryman's Course\" (CIC), lasts 26 weeks as standard and teaches recruits both the basics of soldiering (Phase 1 training) and the specifics of soldiering in the infantry (Phase 2 training). On completion of the CIC, the newly qualified infantry soldier will then be posted to his battalion.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Andrew|title=British Army Phase 1: Initial Military Training|url=http://bootcampmilitaryfitnessinstitute.wordpress.com/military-training/armed-forces-of-the-united-kingdom/british-army-phase-1-initial-military-training/|accessdate=27 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nFor some infantry units, the CIC is longer, due to specific additional requirements for individual regiments:\n*The Foot Guards CIC has an additional two-week enhanced drill course.\n*The Parachute Regiment CIC has an additional two-week [[P Coy|Pre-Parachute Selection]] (PPS) course.\n*The Brigade of Gurkhas CIC combines the Common Military Syllabus with the CIC, together with courses on British culture and the [[English Language]]. The Gurkha CIC lasts 37 weeks.\n\nNew officers conduct their Phase 1 training at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]. Phase 2 training for officers, which is encompassed by the '''Platoon Commander's Battle Course''', is run at the [[Infantry Battle School]] at Brecon in Wales. It is here that leadership and tactics are taught to new platoon commanders. New NCOs and Warrant Officers are also sent on courses at Brecon when they come up for promotion. This encompasses Phase 3 training. Phase 3 training is also undertaken at the Support Weapons School at Warminster, where new officers, NCOs and soldiers are trained in the use of support weapons (mortars, anti-tank weapons) and in communications.\n\nTerritorial Infantrymen undertake preliminary training at [[Regional training centre|Regional Training Centres]] prior to attending a two-week CIC(TA) at Catterick.\n\n===Headquarters Infantry===\nHeadquarters Infantry, which is located at [[Waterloo Lines]] on Imber Road in [[Warminster]], is responsible for recruiting, manning and training policy of the Infantry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/23300.aspx|title=Headquarters Infantry|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Divisions of infantry==\n\nThe majority of the infantry in the British Army is divided for administrative purposes into four divisions. These are not the same as the ready and regenerative divisions (see below), but are based on either the geographical recruiting areas of the regiments, or the type of regiments:\n*The [[Guards Division]] has the five regiments of [[Foot Guards]].\n*The [[Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division]] has the infantry regiments from [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Ireland]].\n*The [[King's Division]] has the regiments from the north of [[England]].\n*The [[Queen's Division]] has the regiments from the east of England and the remaining regiment of [[Fusilier]]s.\n\nA further division, the [[Light Division]], grouped together [[The Light Infantry]] and [[The Royal Green Jackets]] until they were amalgamated to form [[The Rifles]] in 2007, while the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] merged with the [[Scottish Division]] in 2017 to become The Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division.\n\n===Regular army===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Guards Division!!Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division!!King's Division!!Queen's Division\n|-\n|[[Grenadier Guards]]<br />(GREN GDS)|||[[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]<br />(SCOTS)||[[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment<br />(King's, Lancashire and Border)]]<br />(LANCS)||[[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment<br />(Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]<br />(PWRR)\n|-\n|[[Coldstream Guards]]<br />(CLDM GDS)||[[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]<br />(R WELSH)||[[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment<br />(14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]<br />(YORKS)||[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers|The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]<br />(RRF)\n|-\n|[[Scots Guards]]<br />(SG)||[[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling),<br /> 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]]<br />(R IRISH)||[[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshires,<br />Worcesters and Foresters, and Staffords)]]<br />(MERCIAN) ||[[Royal Anglian Regiment|The Royal Anglian Regiment]]<br />(R ANGLIAN)\n|-\n|[[Irish Guards]]<br />(IG)|| || ||[[Royal Gibraltar Regiment|The Royal Gibraltar Regiment]]<br />(RG)\n|-\n|[[Welsh Guards]]<br />(WG)|| || ||\n|}\n\nThere are further infantry units in the army that are not grouped in the various divisions:\n* [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]] (PARA)\n* [[Royal Gurkha Rifles|The Royal Gurkha Rifles]] (RGR)\n* [[The Rifles]] (RIFLES)\n\n===Army Reserve===\n*[[52nd Lowland Volunteers|52nd Lowland]], 6th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*[[51st Highland Volunteers|51st Highland]], 7th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*[[London Regiment (1993)|The London Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's, Lancashire and Border)]]\n*5th Battalion, [[The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Royal Anglian Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th & 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshire, Worcesters & Foresters, and Staffords)]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]\n*2nd Battalion, [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th & Ulster Defence Regiment)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]]\n*6th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*7th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*8th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n\n[[File:British Infantry 2020 Refine.png|thumb|center|920px|British Army Infantry Organization after Army 2020 Refine reform (click to enlarge)]]\n\n\n==Types of infantry==\n\n===Operations===\nWithin the British Army, there are six main types of infantry:\n*'''Armoured Infantry''' - armoured infantry are equipped with the [[Warrior Tracked Armoured Vehicle|Warrior]] armoured personnel carrier, a tracked vehicle that can deploy over all terrain.\n*'''Mechanised Infantry''' - mechanised infantry (or \"protected mobility infantry) are equipped with wheeled armoured vehicles for transporting troops. This is divided into \"heavy protected mobility infantry\" (with large vehicles such as [[Cougar (vehicle)|Mastiff]]), and \"light protected mobility infantry\" (with smaller vehicles such as [[Ocelot (vehicle)|Foxhound]]).\n*'''Light Infantry''' - light infantry are not equipped with armoured vehicles; such units may specialise in jungle and/or arctic warfare\n*'''Air Assault Infantry''' - air assault infantry are trained to be deployed using [[helicopter]]s, parachute or aircraft.\n*'''Specialised Infantry''' - infantry configured to undertake training, mentoring and assistance to indigenous forces in partner nations.\n*'''Public duties''' - infantry on public duties are essentially light infantry units undertaking primarily ceremonial tasks.\n\n===Traditions===\nThe infantry is traditionally divided into three types:\n*'''[[Foot Guards]]''' - foot guards are those infantry regiments that were formed specifically to provide close guard to the King. Soldiers in the guards were usually the best trained and equipped members of the infantry. However, they would fight in the same way as ordinary regiments.\n*'''[[Line Infantry]]''' - line infantry refers to those regiments that historically fought in linear formations, unlike light troops, who fought in loose order.  The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw expansion of the roles of the infantry. To this end, the [[company (military unit)|companies]] stationed on each flank of an infantry battalion were specialist units, with a company of [[light infantry]] trained as skirmishers to operate independently on the battlefield, and a company of [[grenadiers]], who were usually the biggest and strongest men in the battalion, operating as the lead assault troops.\n*'''[[Light Infantry]]/[[Rifle regiment|Rifles]]''' - in the late eighteenth century, the development of the [[Baker rifle]] led to the commissioning by the British Army of regiments specially trained to use the new weapon. These regiments would operate as skirmishers and [[marksman|sharpshooters]] on the edges of the field of battle. These regiments wore green rather than red tunics to enable them to blend in more with the environment, thus giving them the nickname \"green jackets\".\n\nThe tactical distinctions between infantry regiments disappeared in the late nineteenth century, but remain in tradition. In the order of precedence, the five regiments of foot guards are ranked above the ten regiments of traditional line infantry, who are ranked above the two remaining regiments of rifles.\n\n==Divisions and brigades==\nBattalions are attached permanently (semi-permanently for light role battalions) to formations.

World War]], reductions in the size of the infantry led to the amalgamation of the existing [[regimental depot]]s, together with their operational battalions, into geographically based infantry depots, each designated by a letter of the alphabet from A to O (not including I). In 1948, upon the further reduction of line infantry and rifle regiments to a single battalion, the 14 infantry depots were renamed as geographical brigades (with the exception of Depot J, which was the brigade for those regiments designated as \"light infantry\", and Depot O, which was for the two regiments of rifles<ref>Whitaker's Almanack 1956, p. 471</ref> ). These brigades assumed the administrative functions from the individual regimental depots, essentially forming what amounted to a multi-battalion regiment. This was taken a stage further following the [[1957 Defence White Paper]], when each brigade adopted a single cap badge that would be worn by all of the regiments under its administration. This led to discussions within the government regarding the flexibility of the infantry under the then present regimental system, as well as the difficulty of potentially making reductions to the size of the army owing to the emotive nature of the amalgamation of regiments into single battalions. This led to the concept of the \"[[large regiment]]\", which would use the existing brigades as the basis of new, multi-battalion infantry regiments, amalgamating the existing single-battalion regiments en masse, with each of them becoming a battalion of the new formation.<ref>More adaptations forecast in the Army: study of \"large regiment\" basis for infantry, ''The Times'', 9 March 1962</ref> This process had to a certain degree begun in the [[East Anglian Brigade|East Anglian]] and [[Green Jackets Brigade]]s, which had redesignated the regiments they were responsible for from their old names to numbered designations.<ref>Bigger infantry regiments planned by War Office, ''The Times'', 16 March 1962</ref> These two became the first large regiments as the Royal Anglian Regiment and [[Royal Green Jackets]] in 1964 and 1966 respectively.<ref>First of new large regiments, ''The Times'', 25 February 1964</ref><ref>New Green Jackets Regiment, ''The Times'', 29 May 1965</ref> Four further large regiments (The [[Queen's Regiment]], Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, [[Royal Irish Rangers]] and [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]]) were formed between 1966 and 1968, before the process was halted - the brigade system was abolished, with instead all of the remaining infantry regiments grouped into six administrative divisions.\n\nThe amalgamations into large regiments coincided with a planned reduction in the size of the infantry - the intention was that the junior battalion of each large regiment or brigade (prior to the implementation of the divisional structure) would be removed, whether by amalgamation or disbanding. This saw plans for the creation of four new single battalion infantry regiments:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Wales]] - [[South Wales Borderers]] and [[Welch Regiment]]\n*[[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]] - [[Lancashire Regiment]] and [[Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)]]\n*[[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot)]] - [[Worcestershire Regiment]] and [[Sherwood Foresters]]\n*Royal Regiment of Gloucestershire and Hampshire - [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] and [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]]\n\nAt the same time, three more single battalion regiments elected to disband rather than amalgamate:\n*[[The Cameronians|The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)]]\n*[[York and Lancaster Regiment]]\n*[[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's)]]\n\nThree of the regimental amalgamations, two of the regimental disbandments, plus another three of the planned disbandings of large regiment battalions, took place between 1968 and 1970. However, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 General Election]] saw a change of administration, with the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Heath ministry|government]] electing to review the plans. The outcome of this saw the planned amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment and Royal Hampshire Regiment rescinded, together with plans to disband another four infantry battalions completely. Instead, six battalions were reduced in size to a single company:\n*2nd Battalion, [[Scots Guards]] (2nd Battalion Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsguards.co.uk/history1.htm |title=History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=Scots Guards Association |access-date=2 September 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Royal Hampshire Regiment (Minden Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1rhamps.com/rhamps/rhamps.html |title=Royal Hampshire Regiment from 1946-1992 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Royal Hampshire Regiment |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Balaclava Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://argylls1945to1971.co.uk/AandSH_BalaklavaCoy.htm |title= 1st Battalion The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Balaklava Company 1971|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=28 January 2015 |website=The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders History from 1945 to 1971 |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Queen's Regiment (Albuhera Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://queensregimentalassociation.org/queens-forebears.html |title=The Queen's Regiment: Formation and Forebears |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=The Queen's Regiment Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment (Tiger Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vikingveterans.com/history-of-the-1st-battalion-the-royal-anglian-regiment/ |title=History of the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website=Viking Veterans |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*3rd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets (R Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |title=The Royal Green Jackets: The Formation and Origins of the Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=February 2009 |website=greenjackets-net.org.uk |publisher=Royal Green Jackets Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |page=31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401111607/http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |archive-date=1 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe battalions of the Scots Guards, Royal Hampshire Regiment, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and Royal Green Jackets were subsequently reconstituted.\n\n===Delivering Security in a Changing World (2003)===\n{{main|Delivering Security in a Changing World}}\n[[HM Treasury]] asked for major cuts in the strength of the infantry in 2003, with at least ten battalions to be disbanded. This proved so unacceptable that, in November 2003, there was consideration to instead reducing each battalion to two rifle companies (with the third to come from the TA).<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/11/24/narmy24.xml News - Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By March 2004, ECAB had shown that the maximum number of battalions it was possible to cut was four. This was finally officially announced as part of the army [[Delivering Security in a Changing World|re-organisation]]. The [[arms plot]] system would be abolished; instead, individual battalions would be given fixed roles. To ensure that officers and men could continue to gain the variety of skills that the arms plot provided, the restructuring would also see a series of amalgamations of the remaining single battalion infantry regiments into large regiments. In addition, the regular army will lose four battalions. The roles are divided up as follows:\n*Armoured Infantry - 8 battalions (including Land Warfare Training Battalion)\n*Mechanised Infantry - 3 battalions\n*Light Role Infantry (including public duties and Gurkhas) - 20 battalions\n*Air Assault Infantry - 4 battalions\n*Commando Infantry - 1 battalion\n*Territorial Army Infantry - 14 battalions\n\nThe reorganisation was a hybrid of the systems used to organise the regular infantry in [[Australian Army|Australia]] and [[Canadian Army|Canada]]. Australia's regular infantry encompasses eight battalions in a single large regiment, the [[Royal Australian Regiment]] - this system is the one undertaken by the [[Scottish Division]] and the [[Light Division]]. Canada's regular infantry has three regiments, each of three battalions, which is how the [[King's Division]] and the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] will be restructured (albeit with one regiment of three battalions and one of two battalions each).\n\nIn addition to the army's infantry battalions, there are three further battalion-sized commando infantry units, which are part of the [[Royal Marines]], as well as eight field squadrons (each larger than an infantry company) of the [[RAF Regiment]], who have responsibility for the ground defence of air assets and are under the control of the [[Royal Air Force]].\n\nThe majority of infantry battalions are attached to one of the deployable brigades. However, there are a number of formations that exist to administer those infantry battalions that are not assigned to deployable brigades, but are instead available for independent deployment on [[roulement]] tours.\n\n====Guards Division====\nEach battalion in the five single battalion regiments of the Guards Division has a fixed role:\n*Armoured Infantry ([[Scots Guards|1 SG]]) - 1\n*Light Role/Public Duties ([[Grenadier Guards|1 GREN GDS]], [[Coldstream Guards|1 COLDM GDS]], [[Irish Guards|1 IG]], [[Welsh Guards|1 WG]]) - 4\n\nTwo battalions will be assigned as general light role battalions, with the other two assigned to public duties.

The ultimate conclusion of this process was to reduce the size of the [[British Army]] from approximately 102,000 to approximately 82,000 by 2020. The detail of the process was subsequently announced as ''[[Future of the British Army (Army 2020)|Army 2020]]'' in July 2012. As part of this, the infantry was reduced in size from 36 regular battalions to 31. Of the five to be withdrawn, two were armoured infantry units, two general light infantry and one a specialist air assault infantry battalion. The withdrawal of two armoured infantry battalions is to bring this into line with the planned future operational structure, intended to see three \"armoured infantry brigades\", each with a pair of infantry battalions, forming the core of the Army's \"reaction forces\". These two battalions, along with the two light infantry battalions, will be disbanded and their personnel distributed among the remaining battalions of each regiment. The air assault battalion will be reduced to company strength, with the intention that it is assigned as a permanent [[public duties]] unit in Scotland.\n\nThe affected regiments were:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n**The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland - Reduced to an incremental company and assigned to [[public duties]] in Scotland.\n*[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n*[[Yorkshire Regiment|Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot) (Green Howards) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 3rd Battalions. 3 YORKS will eventually be renamed as 1 YORKS. 1 YORKS will eventually be renumbered as 2 YORKS.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194816/http://www.dwr.org.uk/news.php?id=2&nw=239 Duke of Wellington's Regiment]</ref>\n*[[Mercian Regiment]]\n**3rd Battalion, The Mercian Regiment (Staffords) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 2nd Battalions.\n*[[Royal Welsh]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Welsh (Royal Regiment of Wales) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n\nIn addition, the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]] was transferred to the administration of the [[Prince of Wales' Division]].\n\n===Army 2020 Refine===\nUnder a further review called [[Future of the British Army (Army 2020 Refine)|Army 2020 Refine]], the 1st Battalion, Scots Guards and the 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland will be equipped with [[Mechanised Infantry Vehicle]]s and form the core of the first Strike Brigade under the Reaction Force.

Two notable ones depicting the modern British Army have been ''[[Spearhead (TV series)|Spearhead]]'' from the period of the late 1970s, and ''[[Soldier Soldier]]'' from the early to mid-1990s. Both are seen as reasonably accurate depictions of life in the army at those times, and both are centred on a fictional infantry regiment.

Of these, 33 battalions are part of the [[Standing army|Regular army]] and the remaining 16 a part of the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]]. The British Army's Infantry forms a highly flexible organisation, taking on a variety of roles, including armoured, [[Mechanized infantry|mechanised]], [[air assault]] and [[Light infantry|light]].\n\n==Recruitment and training==\n===Recruitment===\nTraditionally, regiments that form the combat arms of the British Army (cavalry and infantry) recruit from specific areas of the country. Infantry regiments had been assigned specific areas from which they would recruit from by the mid eighteenth century. These were formalised under the [[Cardwell Reforms]] that began in the 1860s. Under this scheme, single battalion infantry regiments were amalgamated into two battalion regiments, then assigned to a depot and associated recruiting area (which would usually correspond to all or part of a county). The recruiting area (usually) would then become part of the regiment's title. It was this that gave rise to the concept of the \"county regiment\", with the local infantry regiment becoming part of the fabric of its local area.\n\nOver time, regiments have been amalgamated further, which has led to recruiting areas of individual regiments increasing in size. Often, these amalgamations have been between regiments whose recruiting areas border each other. However, there have been occasions where regiments of a similar type, but from widely different areas, have been amalgamated. Two modern examples have been the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (amalgamated from the county regiments of Northumberland, Warwickshire, [[City of London]] and Lancashire, all of which were regiments of [[fusiliers]]) and The Light Infantry (amalgamated from the county regiments of Cornwall, Somerset, Shropshire, South Yorkshire and Durham, all of which were regiments of [[light infantry]]).\n\nSince September 2007, when the most recent reforms were completed, the infantry has consisted of 18 separate regiments. The five regiments of foot guards recruit from their respective [[home nations]] (with the exception of the Coldstream Guards, which recruits from the counties through which the regiment marched between Coldstream and London). Scotland, Ireland and Wales each have a single regiment of [[line infantry]] from which they recruit (though the battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland recruit from the areas they recruited from when they were separate regiments), while England has seven line infantry and rifles regiments. The Parachute Regiment recruits nationally, while the Royal Gurkha Rifles recruits most of its serving personnel from [[Nepal]], and the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]] recruits from the [[UK]] and [[Commonwealth nations]]\n\nBefore the [[Second World War]], infantry recruits were required to be at least {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall. They initially enlisted for seven years with the colours and a further five years with the reserve. They trained at their own regimental depot.<ref>[[War Office]], ''His Majesty's Army'', 1938</ref>\n\n===Training===\nUnlike the other trades in the army, which have separate units for basic training and specialised training, new recruits into the infantry undergo a single course at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre Catterick]]. This course, called the \"Combat Infantryman's Course\" (CIC), lasts 26 weeks as standard and teaches recruits both the basics of soldiering (Phase 1 training) and the specifics of soldiering in the infantry (Phase 2 training). On completion of the CIC, the newly qualified infantry soldier will then be posted to his battalion.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Andrew|title=British Army Phase 1: Initial Military Training|url=http://bootcampmilitaryfitnessinstitute.wordpress.com/military-training/armed-forces-of-the-united-kingdom/british-army-phase-1-initial-military-training/|accessdate=27 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nFor some infantry units, the CIC is longer, due to specific additional requirements for individual regiments:\n*The Foot Guards CIC has an additional two-week enhanced drill course.\n*The Parachute Regiment CIC has an additional two-week [[P Coy|Pre-Parachute Selection]] (PPS) course.\n*The Brigade of Gurkhas CIC combines the Common Military Syllabus with the CIC, together with courses on British culture and the [[English Language]]. The Gurkha CIC lasts 37 weeks.\n\nNew officers conduct their Phase 1 training at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]. Phase 2 training for officers, which is encompassed by the '''Platoon Commander's Battle Course''', is run at the [[Infantry Battle School]] at Brecon in Wales. It is here that leadership and tactics are taught to new platoon commanders. New NCOs and Warrant Officers are also sent on courses at Brecon when they come up for promotion. This encompasses Phase 3 training. Phase 3 training is also undertaken at the Support Weapons School at Warminster, where new officers, NCOs and soldiers are trained in the use of support weapons (mortars, anti-tank weapons) and in communications.\n\nTerritorial Infantrymen undertake preliminary training at [[Regional training centre|Regional Training Centres]] prior to attending a two-week CIC(TA) at Catterick.\n\n===Headquarters Infantry===\nHeadquarters Infantry, which is located at [[Waterloo Lines]] on Imber Road in [[Warminster]], is responsible for recruiting, manning and training policy of the Infantry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/23300.aspx|title=Headquarters Infantry|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Divisions of infantry==\n\nThe majority of the infantry in the British Army is divided for administrative purposes into four divisions. These are not the same as the ready and regenerative divisions (see below), but are based on either the geographical recruiting areas of the regiments, or the type of regiments:\n*The [[Guards Division]] has the five regiments of [[Foot Guards]].\n*The [[Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division]] has the infantry regiments from [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Ireland]].\n*The [[King's Division]] has the regiments from the north of [[England]].\n*The [[Queen's Division]] has the regiments from the east of England and the remaining regiment of [[Fusilier]]s.\n\nA further division, the [[Light Division]], grouped together [[The Light Infantry]] and [[The Royal Green Jackets]] until they were amalgamated to form [[The Rifles]] in 2007, while the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] merged with the [[Scottish Division]] in 2017 to become The Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division.\n\n===Regular army===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Guards Division!!Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division!!King's Division!!Queen's Division\n|-\n|[[Grenadier Guards]]<br />(GREN GDS)|||[[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]<br />(SCOTS)||[[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment<br />(King's, Lancashire and Border)]]<br />(LANCS)||[[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment<br />(Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]<br />(PWRR)\n|-\n|[[Coldstream Guards]]<br />(CLDM GDS)||[[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]<br />(R WELSH)||[[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment<br />(14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]<br />(YORKS)||[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers|The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]<br />(RRF)\n|-\n|[[Scots Guards]]<br />(SG)||[[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling),<br /> 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]]<br />(R IRISH)||[[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshires,<br />Worcesters and Foresters, and Staffords)]]<br />(MERCIAN) ||[[Royal Anglian Regiment|The Royal Anglian Regiment]]<br />(R ANGLIAN)\n|-\n|[[Irish Guards]]<br />(IG)|| || ||[[Royal Gibraltar Regiment|The Royal Gibraltar Regiment]]<br />(RG)\n|-\n|[[Welsh Guards]]<br />(WG)|| || ||\n|}\n\nThere are further infantry units in the army that are not grouped in the various divisions:\n* [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]] (PARA)\n* [[Royal Gurkha Rifles|The Royal Gurkha Rifles]] (RGR)\n* [[The Rifles]] (RIFLES)\n\n===Army Reserve===\n*[[52nd Lowland Volunteers|52nd Lowland]], 6th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*[[51st Highland Volunteers|51st Highland]], 7th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*[[London Regiment (1993)|The London Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's, Lancashire and Border)]]\n*5th Battalion, [[The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Royal Anglian Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th & 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshire, Worcesters & Foresters, and Staffords)]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]\n*2nd Battalion, [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th & Ulster Defence Regiment)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]]\n*6th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*7th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*8th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n\n[[File:British Infantry 2020 Refine.png|thumb|center|920px|British Army Infantry Organization after Army 2020 Refine reform (click to enlarge)]]\n\n\n==Types of infantry==\n\n===Operations===\nWithin the British Army, there are six main types of infantry:\n*'''Armoured Infantry''' - armoured infantry are equipped with the [[Warrior Tracked Armoured Vehicle|Warrior]] armoured personnel carrier, a tracked vehicle that can deploy over all terrain.\n*'''Mechanised Infantry''' - mechanised infantry (or \"protected mobility infantry) are equipped with wheeled armoured vehicles for transporting troops. This is divided into \"heavy protected mobility infantry\" (with large vehicles such as [[Cougar (vehicle)|Mastiff]]), and \"light protected mobility infantry\" (with smaller vehicles such as [[Ocelot (vehicle)|Foxhound]]).\n*'''Light Infantry''' - light infantry are not equipped with armoured vehicles; such units may specialise in jungle and/or arctic warfare\n*'''Air Assault Infantry''' - air assault infantry are trained to be deployed using [[helicopter]]s, parachute or aircraft.\n*'''Specialised Infantry''' - infantry configured to undertake training, mentoring and assistance to indigenous forces in partner nations.\n*'''Public duties''' - infantry on public duties are essentially light infantry units undertaking primarily ceremonial tasks.\n\n===Traditions===\nThe infantry is traditionally divided into three types:\n*'''[[Foot Guards]]''' - foot guards are those infantry regiments that were formed specifically to provide close guard to the King. Soldiers in the guards were usually the best trained and equipped members of the infantry. However, they would fight in the same way as ordinary regiments.\n*'''[[Line Infantry]]''' - line infantry refers to those regiments that historically fought in linear formations, unlike light troops, who fought in loose order.  The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw expansion of the roles of the infantry. To this end, the [[company (military unit)|companies]] stationed on each flank of an infantry battalion were specialist units, with a company of [[light infantry]] trained as skirmishers to operate independently on the battlefield, and a company of [[grenadiers]], who were usually the biggest and strongest men in the battalion, operating as the lead assault troops.\n*'''[[Light Infantry]]/[[Rifle regiment|Rifles]]''' - in the late eighteenth century, the development of the [[Baker rifle]] led to the commissioning by the British Army of regiments specially trained to use the new weapon. These regiments would operate as skirmishers and [[marksman|sharpshooters]] on the edges of the field of battle. These regiments wore green rather than red tunics to enable them to blend in more with the environment, thus giving them the nickname \"green jackets\".\n\nThe tactical distinctions between infantry regiments disappeared in the late nineteenth century, but remain in tradition. In the order of precedence, the five regiments of foot guards are ranked above the ten regiments of traditional line infantry, who are ranked above the two remaining regiments of rifles.\n\n==Divisions and brigades==\nBattalions are attached permanently (semi-permanently for light role battalions) to formations.

World War]], reductions in the size of the infantry led to the amalgamation of the existing [[regimental depot]]s, together with their operational battalions, into geographically based infantry depots, each designated by a letter of the alphabet from A to O (not including I). In 1948, upon the further reduction of line infantry and rifle regiments to a single battalion, the 14 infantry depots were renamed as geographical brigades (with the exception of Depot J, which was the brigade for those regiments designated as \"light infantry\", and Depot O, which was for the two regiments of rifles<ref>Whitaker's Almanack 1956, p. 471</ref> ). These brigades assumed the administrative functions from the individual regimental depots, essentially forming what amounted to a multi-battalion regiment. This was taken a stage further following the [[1957 Defence White Paper]], when each brigade adopted a single cap badge that would be worn by all of the regiments under its administration. This led to discussions within the government regarding the flexibility of the infantry under the then present regimental system, as well as the difficulty of potentially making reductions to the size of the army owing to the emotive nature of the amalgamation of regiments into single battalions. This led to the concept of the \"[[large regiment]]\", which would use the existing brigades as the basis of new, multi-battalion infantry regiments, amalgamating the existing single-battalion regiments en masse, with each of them becoming a battalion of the new formation.<ref>More adaptations forecast in the Army: study of \"large regiment\" basis for infantry, ''The Times'', 9 March 1962</ref> This process had to a certain degree begun in the [[East Anglian Brigade|East Anglian]] and [[Green Jackets Brigade]]s, which had redesignated the regiments they were responsible for from their old names to numbered designations.<ref>Bigger infantry regiments planned by War Office, ''The Times'', 16 March 1962</ref> These two became the first large regiments as the Royal Anglian Regiment and [[Royal Green Jackets]] in 1964 and 1966 respectively.<ref>First of new large regiments, ''The Times'', 25 February 1964</ref><ref>New Green Jackets Regiment, ''The Times'', 29 May 1965</ref> Four further large regiments (The [[Queen's Regiment]], Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, [[Royal Irish Rangers]] and [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]]) were formed between 1966 and 1968, before the process was halted - the brigade system was abolished, with instead all of the remaining infantry regiments grouped into six administrative divisions.\n\nThe amalgamations into large regiments coincided with a planned reduction in the size of the infantry - the intention was that the junior battalion of each large regiment or brigade (prior to the implementation of the divisional structure) would be removed, whether by amalgamation or disbanding. This saw plans for the creation of four new single battalion infantry regiments:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Wales]] - [[South Wales Borderers]] and [[Welch Regiment]]\n*[[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]] - [[Lancashire Regiment]] and [[Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)]]\n*[[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot)]] - [[Worcestershire Regiment]] and [[Sherwood Foresters]]\n*Royal Regiment of Gloucestershire and Hampshire - [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] and [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]]\n\nAt the same time, three more single battalion regiments elected to disband rather than amalgamate:\n*[[The Cameronians|The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)]]\n*[[York and Lancaster Regiment]]\n*[[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's)]]\n\nThree of the regimental amalgamations, two of the regimental disbandments, plus another three of the planned disbandings of large regiment battalions, took place between 1968 and 1970. However, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 General Election]] saw a change of administration, with the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Heath ministry|government]] electing to review the plans. The outcome of this saw the planned amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment and Royal Hampshire Regiment rescinded, together with plans to disband another four infantry battalions completely. Instead, six battalions were reduced in size to a single company:\n*2nd Battalion, [[Scots Guards]] (2nd Battalion Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsguards.co.uk/history1.htm |title=History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=Scots Guards Association |access-date=2 September 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Royal Hampshire Regiment (Minden Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1rhamps.com/rhamps/rhamps.html |title=Royal Hampshire Regiment from 1946-1992 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Royal Hampshire Regiment |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Balaclava Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://argylls1945to1971.co.uk/AandSH_BalaklavaCoy.htm |title= 1st Battalion The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Balaklava Company 1971|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=28 January 2015 |website=The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders History from 1945 to 1971 |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Queen's Regiment (Albuhera Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://queensregimentalassociation.org/queens-forebears.html |title=The Queen's Regiment: Formation and Forebears |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=The Queen's Regiment Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment (Tiger Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vikingveterans.com/history-of-the-1st-battalion-the-royal-anglian-regiment/ |title=History of the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website=Viking Veterans |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*3rd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets (R Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |title=The Royal Green Jackets: The Formation and Origins of the Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=February 2009 |website=greenjackets-net.org.uk |publisher=Royal Green Jackets Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |page=31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401111607/http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |archive-date=1 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe battalions of the Scots Guards, Royal Hampshire Regiment, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and Royal Green Jackets were subsequently reconstituted.\n\n===Delivering Security in a Changing World (2003)===\n{{main|Delivering Security in a Changing World}}\n[[HM Treasury]] asked for major cuts in the strength of the infantry in 2003, with at least ten battalions to be disbanded. This proved so unacceptable that, in November 2003, there was consideration to instead reducing each battalion to two rifle companies (with the third to come from the TA).<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/11/24/narmy24.xml News - Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By March 2004, ECAB had shown that the maximum number of battalions it was possible to cut was four. This was finally officially announced as part of the army [[Delivering Security in a Changing World|re-organisation]]. The [[arms plot]] system would be abolished; instead, individual battalions would be given fixed roles. To ensure that officers and men could continue to gain the variety of skills that the arms plot provided, the restructuring would also see a series of amalgamations of the remaining single battalion infantry regiments into large regiments. In addition, the regular army will lose four battalions. The roles are divided up as follows:\n*Armoured Infantry - 8 battalions (including Land Warfare Training Battalion)\n*Mechanised Infantry - 3 battalions\n*Light Role Infantry (including public duties and Gurkhas) - 20 battalions\n*Air Assault Infantry - 4 battalions\n*Commando Infantry - 1 battalion\n*Territorial Army Infantry - 14 battalions\n\nThe reorganisation was a hybrid of the systems used to organise the regular infantry in [[Australian Army|Australia]] and [[Canadian Army|Canada]]. Australia's regular infantry encompasses eight battalions in a single large regiment, the [[Royal Australian Regiment]] - this system is the one undertaken by the [[Scottish Division]] and the [[Light Division]]. Canada's regular infantry has three regiments, each of three battalions, which is how the [[King's Division]] and the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] will be restructured (albeit with one regiment of three battalions and one of two battalions each).\n\nIn addition to the army's infantry battalions, there are three further battalion-sized commando infantry units, which are part of the [[Royal Marines]], as well as eight field squadrons (each larger than an infantry company) of the [[RAF Regiment]], who have responsibility for the ground defence of air assets and are under the control of the [[Royal Air Force]].\n\nThe majority of infantry battalions are attached to one of the deployable brigades. However, there are a number of formations that exist to administer those infantry battalions that are not assigned to deployable brigades, but are instead available for independent deployment on [[roulement]] tours.\n\n====Guards Division====\nEach battalion in the five single battalion regiments of the Guards Division has a fixed role:\n*Armoured Infantry ([[Scots Guards|1 SG]]) - 1\n*Light Role/Public Duties ([[Grenadier Guards|1 GREN GDS]], [[Coldstream Guards|1 COLDM GDS]], [[Irish Guards|1 IG]], [[Welsh Guards|1 WG]]) - 4\n\nTwo battalions will be assigned as general light role battalions, with the other two assigned to public duties.

The ultimate conclusion of this process was to reduce the size of the [[British Army]] from approximately 102,000 to approximately 82,000 by 2020. The detail of the process was subsequently announced as ''[[Future of the British Army (Army 2020)|Army 2020]]'' in July 2012. As part of this, the infantry was reduced in size from 36 regular battalions to 31. Of the five to be withdrawn, two were armoured infantry units, two general light infantry and one a specialist air assault infantry battalion. The withdrawal of two armoured infantry battalions is to bring this into line with the planned future operational structure, intended to see three \"armoured infantry brigades\", each with a pair of infantry battalions, forming the core of the Army's \"reaction forces\". These two battalions, along with the two light infantry battalions, will be disbanded and their personnel distributed among the remaining battalions of each regiment. The air assault battalion will be reduced to company strength, with the intention that it is assigned as a permanent [[public duties]] unit in Scotland.\n\nThe affected regiments were:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n**The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland - Reduced to an incremental company and assigned to [[public duties]] in Scotland.\n*[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n*[[Yorkshire Regiment|Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot) (Green Howards) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 3rd Battalions. 3 YORKS will eventually be renamed as 1 YORKS. 1 YORKS will eventually be renumbered as 2 YORKS.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194816/http://www.dwr.org.uk/news.php?id=2&nw=239 Duke of Wellington's Regiment]</ref>\n*[[Mercian Regiment]]\n**3rd Battalion, The Mercian Regiment (Staffords) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 2nd Battalions.\n*[[Royal Welsh]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Welsh (Royal Regiment of Wales) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n\nIn addition, the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]] was transferred to the administration of the [[Prince of Wales' Division]].\n\n===Army 2020 Refine===\nUnder a further review called [[Future of the British Army (Army 2020 Refine)|Army 2020 Refine]], the 1st Battalion, Scots Guards and the 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland will be equipped with [[Mechanised Infantry Vehicle]]s and form the core of the first Strike Brigade under the Reaction Force. Five infantry battalions will undertake the new specialist infantry role; these units will provide an increased contribution to countering terrorism and building stability overseas, and will number around 300 personnel. Four of these battalions, 1st Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland; 2nd Battalion, The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment; 2nd Battalion, The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment; and 4th Battalion, The Rifles, will be existing battalions, while the fifth will be formed as a new battalion of the Royal Gurkha Rifles <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2016-12-15/HCWS367/|title=Strategic Defence and Security Review - Army: Written statement - HCWS367|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/defence-committee/sdsr-2015-and-the-army/oral/34418.html|title=Oral evidence: SDSR 2015 and the Army, HC 108|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=17 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.janes.com/article/81826/uk-to-recruit-more-gurkha-soldiers |title=UK to recruit more Gurkha soldiers |last=Ripley |first=Tim |date=18 July 2018|website=Jane's 360 |publisher= |access-date=20 July 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n====Guards Division====\n*Heavy Protected Mobility Infantry (1 SG) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (1 COLDM GDS, 1 IG) - 2\n*Light Role/Public Duties (1 GREN GDS, 1 WG) - 2\n*Public Duties (2 GREN GDS, 2 COLDM GDS, 2 SG){{ref|Alpha|\u03b1}}\n*Army Reserve (LONDONS) - 1\n<small>All five battalions will periodically rotate roles</small>\n\n====Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division====\n*Armoured Infantry (1 R WELSH) - 1\n*Heavy Protected Mobility Infantry (4 SCOTS) - 1\n*Light Protected Mobility Infantry (3 SCOTS, 1 R IRISH) - 2\n*Light Role Infantry (2 SCOTS) - 1\n*Specialised Training Infantry (1 SCOTS) - 1\n*Public Duties - (5 SCOTS){{ref|Alpha|\u03b1}}\n*Army Reserve - (6 SCOTS, 7 SCOTS, 3 R WELSH, 2 R IRISH) - 4\n\n====King's Division====\n*Armoured Infantry (1 YORKS, 1 MERCIAN) - 2\n*Light Protected Mobility Infantry (2 YORKS) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (1 LANCS, 2 MERCIAN) - 2\n*Specialised Training Infantry (2 LANCS) - 1\n*Army Reserve (4 LANCS, 4 YORKS, 4 MERCIAN) - 3\n\n====Queen's Division====\n*Armoured Infantry (1 PWRR, 1 RRF) - 2\n*Light Protected Mobility Infantry (2 R ANGLIAN) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (1 R ANGLIAN) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (Home Defence) (1 RG) - 1\n*Specialised Training Infantry (2 PWRR) - 1\n*Army Reserve (3 PWRR, 4 PWRR, 5 RRF, 3 R ANGLIAN) - 4\n\n====The Rifles====\n*Armoured Infantry (5 RIFLES) - 1\n*Light Protected Mobility Infantry (3 RIFLES) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (1 RIFLES, 2 RIFLES) - 2\n*Specialised Training Infantry (4 RIFLES) - 1\n*Army Reserve (6 RIFLES, 7 RIFLES, 8 RIFLES) - 3\n\n====Other infantry regiments====\n*Light Role Infantry (1 RGR, 2 RGR) - 2\n*Parachute Infantry (2 PARA, 3 PARA, 4 PARA) - 2\n*Specialised Training Infantry (3 RGR) - 1\n<small>:{{note|Alpha|\u03b1}} These are the battalions represented by the [[British Army incremental infantry companies|four incremental companies]]</small>\n\n==Other regiments==\n\n===Disbanded regiments===\nOver time, a handful of infantry regiments have disappeared from the roll through disbandment rather than amalgamation.

The more recent depiction of the British Army came in the film ''[[The Mark of Cain (2007 film)|The Mark of Cain]]'', which featured an infantry regiment deployed to [[Iraq]], and the difficulties it faced.\n\n*[[Loamshire Regiment|The Loamshire Regiment]]\nThe Loamshire Regiment is used by the British Army as the [[placeholder name]] in the provision of examples for its procedures, for example in the method of addressing letters to members of the forces produced by the [[British Forces Post Office]].\n\n==Order of precedence==\n{{S-start}}\n{{order of precedence |\n  before= [[Royal Corps of Signals]]| |\n  title= [[British Army Order of Precedence|Order of precedence]]|\n  after= [[Special Air Service]]\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|War}}\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20040913102237/http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/organisation/organisation.htm\n\n{{The British Army}}\n{{British Infantry}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Infantry Of The British Army}}\n[[Category:British administrative corps]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Wiltshire]]\n", "name_user": "Hammersfan", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e6th (United Kingdom) Division", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry_of_the_British_Army"}
{"title_page": "Klein quartic", "text_new": "[[File:Order-7 triangular tiling.svg|thumb|The Klein quartic is a quotient of the [[order-7 triangular tiling]].]]{{Short description|Compact Riemann surface of genus 3}}\n[[File:Heptagonal tiling.svg|thumb|Dually, the Klein quartic is a quotient of the dual tiling, the [[order-3 heptagonal tiling]].]]\n\nIn [[hyperbolic geometry]], the '''Klein quartic''', named after [[Felix Klein]], is a [[compact space|compact]] [[Riemann surface]] of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] {{math|3}} with the highest possible order [[automorphism group]] for this genus, namely order {{math|168}} orientation-preserving automorphisms, and {{math|336}} automorphisms if orientation may be reversed.  As such, the Klein quartic is the [[Hurwitz surface]] of lowest possible genus; see [[Hurwitz's automorphisms theorem]].  Its (orientation-preserving) automorphism group is isomorphic to [[PSL(2,7)|{{math|PSL(2, 7)}}]], the second-smallest non-abelian [[simple group]]. The quartic was first described in {{Harv|Klein|1878b}}.\n\nKlein's quartic occurs in many branches of mathematics, in contexts including [[representation theory]], [[homology theory]], [[octonion multiplication]], [[Fermat's last theorem]], and the [[Stark-Heegner theorem]] on [[imaginary quadratic number field]]s of [[class number (number theory)|class number]] one; see {{Harv|Levy|1999}} for a survey of properties.\n\nOriginally, the \"Klein quartic\" referred specifically to the subset of the [[complex projective plane]] {{math|'''P'''<sup>2</sup>('''C''')}} defined by [[#As an algebraic curve|an algebraic equation]]. This has a specific [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian metric]] (that makes it a minimal surface in {{math|'''P'''<sup>2</sup>('''C''')}}), under which its [[Gaussian curvature]] is not constant. But more commonly (as in this article) it is now thought of as any Riemann surface that is conformally equivalent to this algebraic curve, and especially the one that is a quotient of the [[hyperbolic plane]] {{math|'''H'''<sup>2</sup>}} by a certain [[cocompact]] group {{mvar|G}} that acts [[Group action (mathematics)#Types of actions|freely]] on {{math|'''H'''<sup>2</sup>}} by isometries. This gives the Klein quartic a Riemannian metric of constant curvature {{math|\u22121}} that it inherits from {{math|'''H'''<sup>2</sup>}}. This set of conformally equivalent Riemannian surfaces is precisely the same as all compact Riemannian surfaces of genus 3 whose conformal automorphism group is isomorphic to the unique simple group of order 168. This group is also known as {{math|PSL(2, 7)}}, and also as the isomorphic group {{math|PSL(3, 2)}}. By [[covering space]] theory, the group {{mvar|G}} mentioned above is isomorphic to the [[fundamental group]] of the compact surface of genus {{math|3}}.\n\n== Closed and open forms ==\nIt is important to distinguish two different forms of the quartic. The ''[[Closed manifold|closed]]'' quartic is what is generally meant in geometry; topologically it has genus 3 and is a [[compact space]]. The ''[[open manifold|open]]'' or \"punctured\" quartic is of interest in number theory; topologically it is a genus 3 surface with 24 punctures, and geometrically these punctures are [[Cusp neighborhood|cusps]]. The open quartic may be obtained (topologically) from the closed quartic by puncturing at the 24 centers of the tiling by regular heptagons, as discussed below. The open and closed quartics have different metrics, though they are both hyperbolic and complete<ref>{{Harv|Levy|1999|loc=p. 24}}</ref> \u2013 geometrically, the cusps are \"points at infinity\", not holes, hence the open quartic is still complete.\n\n==As an algebraic curve==\nThe Klein quartic can be viewed as a [[projective variety|projective]] [[algebraic curve]] over the [[complex number]]s {{math|'''C'''}}, defined by the following quartic equation in [[homogeneous coordinates]] {{math|[''x'':''y'':''z'']}} on {{math|'''P'''<sup>2</sup>('''C''')}}:\n\n:<math>x^3y + y^3z + z^3x = 0.</math>\n\nThe locus of this equation in {{math|'''P'''<sup>2</sup>('''C''')}} is the original Riemannian surface that Klein described.\n\n==Quaternion algebra construction==\nThe compact Klein quartic can be constructed as the quotient of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] by the action of a suitable [[Fuchsian group]] {{math|\u0393(''I'')}} which is the principal [[congruence subgroup]] associated with the ideal <math>I=\\langle \\eta-2\\rangle</math> in the ring of algebraic integers {{math|'''Z'''(''\u03b7'')}} of the field {{math|'''Q'''(''\u03b7'')}} where {{math|''\u03b7'' {{=}} 2 cos(2''\u03c0''/7)}}.  Note the identity\n\n:<math>(2-\\eta)^3= 7(\\eta-1)^2,</math>\n\nexhibiting {{math|2 \u2013 ''\u03b7''}} as a prime factor of 7 in the ring of algebraic integers.\n\nThe group {{math|\u0393(''I'')}} is a subgroup of the [[(2,3,7) triangle group|(2,3,7)]] hyperbolic [[triangle group]].  Namely, {{math|\u0393(''I'')}} is a subgroup of the group of elements of unit norm in the quaternion algebra generated as an associative algebra by the generators {{mvar|i,j}} and relations\n\n:<math>i^2=j^2=\\eta, \\qquad ij=-ji.</math>\n\nOne chooses a suitable [[Hurwitz quaternion order]] <math>\\mathcal Q_{\\mathrm{Hur}}</math> in the quaternion algebra, {{math|\u0393(''I'')}} is then the group of norm 1 elements in <math>1+I\\mathcal Q_{\\mathrm{Hur}}</math>.  The least absolute value of a trace of a hyperbolic element in {{math|\u0393(''I'')}} is <math>\\eta^2+3\\eta+2</math>, corresponding the value 3.936 for the [[systolic geometry|systole]] of the Klein quartic, one of the highest in this genus.\n\n==Tiling==\n[[File:3-7 kisrhombille.svg|thumb|The tiling of the quartic by reflection domains is a quotient of the [[3-7 kisrhombille]].]]\nThe Klein quartic admits tilings connected with the symmetry group (a \"[[Regular map (graph theory)|regular map]]\"<ref name=\"scholl\"/>), and these are used in understanding the symmetry group, dating back to Klein's original paper. Given a [[fundamental domain]] for the group action (for the full, orientation-reversing symmetry group, a (2,3,7) triangle), the reflection domains (images of this domain under the group) give a tiling of the quartic such that the automorphism group of the tiling equals the automorphism group of the surface \u2013 reflections in the lines of the tiling correspond to the reflections in the group (reflections in the lines of a given fundamental triangle give a set of 3 generating reflections). This tiling is a quotient of the [[order-3 bisected heptagonal tiling]] of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] (the [[universal cover]] of the quartic), and all Hurwitz surfaces are tiled in the same way, as quotients.\n\nThis tiling is uniform but not regular (it is by [[scalene triangle]]s), and often regular tilings are used instead. A quotient of any tiling in the [[Uniform tilings in hyperbolic plane#The .5B7.2C3.5D .287 3 2.29 group family|(2,3,7) family]] can be used (and will have the same automorphism group); of these, the two regular tilings are the tiling by 24 regular hyperbolic [[heptagon]]s, each of degree 3 (meeting at 56 vertices), and the dual tiling by 56 [[equilateral triangle]]s, each of degree 7 (meeting at 24 vertices). The order of the automorphism group is related, being the number of polygons times the number of edges in the polygon in both cases.\n:24 &times; 7 = 168\n:56 &times; 3 = 168\nThe covering tilings on the hyperbolic plane are the [[order-3 heptagonal tiling]] and the [[order-7 triangular tiling]].\n\nThe automorphism group can be augmented (by a symmetry which is not realized by a symmetry of the tiling) to yield the [[Mathieu group]] M<sub>24</sub>.<ref name=\"richter\"/>\n\nCorresponding to each ''tiling'' of the quartic (partition of the quartic variety into subsets) is an [[abstract polyhedron]], which abstracts from the geometry and only reflects the combinatorics of the tiling (this is a general way of obtaining an [[abstract polytope]] from a tiling) \u2013 the vertices, edges, and faces of the polyhedron are equal as sets to the vertices, edges, and faces of the tiling, with the same incidence relations, and the (combinatorial) automorphism group of the abstract polyhedron equals the (geometric) automorphism group of the quartic. In this way the geometry reduces to combinatorics.\n\n=== Affine quartic ===\nThe above is a tiling of the ''projective'' quartic (a closed manifold); the affine quartic has 24 cusps (topologically, punctures), which correspond to the 24 vertices of the regular triangular tiling, or equivalently the centers of the 24 heptagons in the heptagonal tiling, and can be realized as follows.\n\nConsidering the action of {{math|SL(2, '''R''')}} on the [[Poincar\u00e9 half-plane model|upper half-plane model]] {{math|'''H'''<sup>2</sup>}} of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] by [[M\u00f6bius transformation]]s, the affine Klein quartic can be realized as the quotient {{math|\u0393(7)\\'''H'''<sup>2</sup>}}. (Here {{math|\u0393(7)}} is the [[congruence subgroup]] of {{math|SL(2, '''Z''')}} consisting of matrices that are congruent to the identity matrix when all entries are taken [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 7.)\n\n== Fundamental domain and pants decomposition ==\nThe Klein quartic can be obtained as the quotient of the hyperbolic plane by the action of a Fuchsian group. The [[fundamental domain]] is a regular 14-gon, which has area <math>8\\pi</math> by the [[Gauss-Bonnet theorem]]. This can be seen in the adjoining figure, which also includes the 336 (2,3,7) triangles that tessellate the surface and generate its group of symmetries.\n[[File:Fundamental domain of Klein quartic.svg|thumb|right|The fundamental domain of the Klein quartic. The surface is obtained by associating sides with equal numbers.]]\nWithin the tessellation by (2,3,7) triangles is a tessellation by 24 regular heptagons. The systole of the surface passes through the midpoints of 8 heptagon sides; for this reason it has been referred to as an \"eight step geodesic\" in the literature, and is the reason for the title of the book in the section below. All the coloured curves in the figure showing the pants decomposition are systoles, however, this is just a subset; there are 21 in total. The length of the systole is \n:<math>16\\sinh^{-1}\\left(\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\csc^2\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{7}\\right)-4}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{7}\\right)\\right)\\approx3.93594624883.</math>\n\nAn equivalent closed formula is\n\n:<math>8\\cosh^{-1}\\left(\\tfrac{3}{2}-2\\sin^2\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{7}\\right)\\right).</math>\n\nWhilst the Klein quartic maximises the symmetry group for surfaces of genus 3, it does not maximise the systole length. The conjectured maximiser is the surface referred to as \"M3\" {{Harv|Schmutz|1993}}. M3 comes from a tessellation of (2,3,12) triangles, and its systole has multiplicity 24 and length\n:<math>2\\cosh^{-1}\\left(2+\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\approx3.9833047820988736.</math>\n\n[[File:Kleinpants.png|thumb|right|A pants decomposition of the Klein quartic. The figure on the left shows the boundary geodesics in the (2,3,7) tessellation of the fundamental domain. In the figure to the right, the pants have each been coloured differently to make it clear which part of the fundamental domain belongs to which pair of pants.]]\n\nThe Klein quartic can be decomposed into four [[pair of pants (mathematics)|pairs of pants]] by cutting along six of its systoles. This decomposition gives a symmetric set of [[Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates]], where the length parameters are all equal to the length of the systole, and the twist parameters are all equal to <math>\\tfrac{1}{8}</math> of the length of the systole. In particular, taking <math>l(S)</math> to be the systole length, the coordinates are\n\n:<math>\\left\\{l(S),\\tfrac{l(S)}{8};l(S),\\tfrac{l(S)}{8};l(S),\\tfrac{l(S)}{8};l(S),\\tfrac{l(S)}{8};l(S),\\tfrac{l(S)}{8};l(S),\\tfrac{l(S)}{8}\\right\\}.</math>\n\nThe [[cubic graph]] corresponding to this pants decomposition is the tetrahedral graph, that is, the graph of 4 nodes, each connected to the other 3. The tetrahedral graph is similar to the graph for the projective [[Fano plane]]; indeed, the automorphism group of the Klein quartic is isomorphic to that of the Fano plane.\n\n== Spectral theory ==\n\n[[File:Kleineigenspacevsmall.png|thumb|right|The eight functions corresponding to the first positive eigenvalue of the Klein quartic. The functions are zero along the light blue lines. These plots were produced in [[FreeFEM++]].]]\n\nLittle has been proved about the [[spectral theory]] of the Klein quartic, however, it has been conjectured that the it maximises the first positive eigenvalue of the Laplace operator among all compact Riemann surfaces of genus 3 with constant negative curvature. This conjecture comes from the fact that the Klein quartic has the largest symmetry group of surfaces in its topological class, much like the [[Bolza surface]] in genus 2. Eigenvalues of the Klein quartic have been calculated to varying degrees of accuracy. The first 15 distinct positive eigenvalues are shown in the following table, along with their multiplicities.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Numerical computations of the first 15 positive eigenvalues of the Klein quartic\n|-\n!

The resulting models most often have either tetrahedral (order 12) or octahedral (order 24) symmetries; the remaining order 7 symmetry cannot be as easily visualized, and in fact is the title of Klein's paper.\n\n[[File:The Eightfold Way - Silvio Levy - cover.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Eightfold Way'' \u2013 sculpture by [[Helaman Ferguson]] and accompanying book.]]\nMost often, the quartic is modeled either by a smooth genus 3 surface with tetrahedral symmetry (replacing the edges of a regular tetrahedron with tubes/handles yields such a shape), which have been dubbed \"tetruses\",<ref name=\"sequin\" /> or by polyhedral approximations, which have been dubbed \"tetroids\";<ref name=\"sequin\" /> in both cases this is an ''embedding'' of the shape in 3 dimensions. The most notable smooth model (tetrus) is the sculpture ''The Eightfold Way'' by [[Helaman Ferguson]] at the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] in [[Berkeley, California]], made of marble and serpentine, and unveiled on November 14, 1993. The title refers to the fact that starting at any vertex of the triangulated surface and moving along any edge, if you alternately turn left and right when reaching a vertex, you always return to the original point after eight edges.  The acquisition of the sculpture led in due course to the publication of a book of papers {{Harv|Levy|1999}}, detailing properties of the quartic and containing the first English translation of Klein's paper. Polyhedral models with tetrahedral symmetry most often have [[convex hull]] a [[truncated tetrahedron]] \u2013 see {{Harv|Schulte|Wills|1985}} and {{Harv|Scholl|Sch\u00fcrmann|Wills|2002}} for examples and illustrations. Some of these models consist of 20 triangles or 56 triangles (abstractly, the [[regular skew polyhedron]] {3,7|,4}, with 56 faces, 84 edges, and 24 vertices), which cannot be realized as equilateral, with twists in the arms of the tetrahedron; while others have 24 heptagons \u2013 these heptagons can be taken to be planar, though non-convex,<ref name=\"schulte\">{{Harv|Schulte|Wills|1985}}</ref> and the models are more complex than the triangular ones because the complexity is reflected in the shapes of the (non-flexible) heptagonal faces, rather than in the (flexible) vertices.<ref name=\"scholl\"/>\n\n[[File:Small cubicuboctahedron.png|thumb|The [[small cubicuboctahedron]] is a polyhedral immersion of the tiling of the Klein quartic with octahedral symmetry.]]\nAlternatively, the quartic can be modeled by a polyhedron with octahedral symmetry: Klein modeled the quartic by a shape with octahedral symmetries and with points at infinity (an \"open polyhedron\"),<ref name=\"westendorp\" /> namely three [[hyperboloid]]s meeting on orthogonal axes,<ref name=\"scholl\"/> while it can also be modeled as a closed polyhedron which must be ''immersed'' (have self-intersections), not embedded.<ref name=\"scholl\"/> Such polyhedra may have various convex hulls, including the [[truncated cube]],<ref name=\"egan\">[http://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/KleinQuartic/KleinQuartic.html Klein's Quartic Curve], by Greg Egan</ref> the [[snub cube]],<ref name=\"schulte\"/> or the [[rhombicuboctahedron]], as in the [[small cubicuboctahedron]] at right.<ref name=\"richter\">{{Harv|Richter}}</ref> The small cubicuboctahedron immersion is obtained by joining some of the triangles (2 triangles form a square, 6 form an octagon), which can be visualized by [http://homepages.wmich.edu/~drichter/images/mathieu/hypercolors.jpg coloring the triangles] (the corresponding tiling is topologically but not geometrically the [[:File:Uniform tiling 443-t01.png|3 4 &#124; 4 tiling]]).

The resulting dessin is a \"platonic\" dessin, meaning edge-transitive and \"clean\" (each white point has valence 2).\n\n==Related surfaces==\nThe Klein quartic is related to various other surfaces.\n\nGeometrically, it is the smallest [[Hurwitz surface]] (lowest genus); the next is the [[Macbeath surface]] (genus 7), and the following is the [[First Hurwitz triplet]] (3 surfaces of genus 14). More generally, it is the most symmetric surface of a given genus (being a Hurwitz surface); in this class, the [[Bolza surface]] is the most symmetric genus 2 surface, while [[Bring's surface]] is a highly symmetric genus 4 surface \u2013 see [[Riemann surface#Isometries of Riemann surfaces|isometries of Riemann surfaces]] for further discussion.\n\nAlgebraically, the (affine) Klein quartic is the [[modular curve]] X(7) and the projective Klein quartic is its compactification, just as the dodecahedron (with a cusp in the center of each face) is the modular curve X(5); this explains the relevance for number theory.\n\nMore subtly, the (projective) Klein quartic is a [[Shimura curve]] (as are the Hurwitz surfaces of genus 7 and 14), and as such parametrizes [[Principally polarized abelian variety|principally polarized abelian varieties]] of dimension 6.<ref>Elkies, section 4.4 (pp. 94\u201397) in {{Harv|Levy|1999}}.</ref>\n\nThere are also other [[quartic surface]]s of interest \u2013 see [[Quartic surface#Special quartic surfaces|special quartic surfaces]].\n\nMore exceptionally, the Klein quartic forms part of a \"[[ADE classification#Trinities|trinity]]\" in the sense of [[Vladimir Arnold]], which can also be described as a [[McKay correspondence]].

As such, the Klein quartic is the [[Hurwitz surface]] of lowest possible genus; see [[Hurwitz's automorphisms theorem]].  Its (orientation-preserving) automorphism group is isomorphic to [[PSL(2,7)|{{math|PSL(2, 7)}}]], the second-smallest non-abelian [[simple group]]. The quartic was first described in {{Harv|Klein|1878b}}.\n\nKlein's quartic occurs in many branches of mathematics, in contexts including [[representation theory]], [[homology theory]], [[octonion multiplication]], [[Fermat's last theorem]], and the [[Stark-Heegner theorem]] on [[imaginary quadratic number field]]s of [[class number (number theory)|class number]] one; see {{Harv|Levy|1999}} for a survey of properties.\n\nOriginally, the \"Klein quartic\" referred specifically to the subset of the [[complex projective plane]] {{math|'''P'''<sup>2</sup>('''C''')}} defined by [[#As an algebraic curve|an algebraic equation]]. This has a specific [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian metric]] (that makes it a minimal surface in {{math|'''P'''<sup>2</sup>('''C''')}}), under which its [[Gaussian curvature]] is not constant. But more commonly (as in this article) it is now thought of as any Riemann surface that is conformally equivalent to this algebraic curve, and especially the one that is a quotient of the [[hyperbolic plane]] {{math|'''H'''<sup>2</sup>}} by a certain [[cocompact]] group {{mvar|G}} that acts [[Group action (mathematics)#Types_of_actions|freely]] on {{math|'''H'''<sup>2</sup>}} by isometries. This gives the Klein quartic a Riemannian metric of constant curvature {{math|\u22121}} that it inherits from {{math|'''H'''<sup>2</sup>}}. This set of conformally equivalent Riemannian surfaces is precisely the same as all compact Riemannian surfaces of genus 3 whose conformal automorphism group is isomorphic to the unique simple group of order 168. This group is also known as {{math|PSL(2, 7)}}, and also as the isomorphic group {{math|PSL(3, 2)}}. By [[covering space]] theory, the group {{mvar|G}} mentioned above is isomorphic to the [[fundamental group]] of the compact surface of genus {{math|3}}.\n\n== Closed and open forms ==\nIt is important to distinguish two different forms of the quartic. The ''[[Closed manifold|closed]]'' quartic is what is generally meant in geometry; topologically it has genus 3 and is a [[compact space]]. The ''[[open manifold|open]]'' or \"punctured\" quartic is of interest in number theory; topologically it is a genus 3 surface with 24 punctures, and geometrically these punctures are [[Cusp neighborhood|cusps]]. The open quartic may be obtained (topologically) from the closed quartic by puncturing at the 24 centers of the tiling by regular heptagons, as discussed below. The open and closed quartics have different metrics, though they are both hyperbolic and complete<ref>{{Harv|Levy|1999|loc=p. 24}}</ref> \u2013 geometrically, the cusps are \"points at infinity\", not holes, hence the open quartic is still complete.\n\n==As an algebraic curve==\nThe Klein quartic can be viewed as a [[projective variety|projective]] [[algebraic curve]] over the [[complex number]]s {{math|'''C'''}}, defined by the following quartic equation in [[homogeneous coordinates]] {{math|[''x'':''y'':''z'']}} on {{math|'''P'''<sup>2</sup>('''C''')}}:\n\n:<math>x^3y + y^3z + z^3x = 0.</math>\n\nThe locus of this equation in {{math|'''P'''<sup>2</sup>('''C''')}} is the original Riemannian surface that Klein described.\n\n==Quaternion algebra construction==\nThe compact Klein quartic can be constructed as the quotient of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] by the action of a suitable [[Fuchsian group]] {{math|\u0393(''I'')}} which is the principal [[congruence subgroup]] associated with the ideal <math>I=\\langle \\eta-2\\rangle</math> in the ring of algebraic integers {{math|'''Z'''(''\u03b7'')}} of the field {{math|'''Q'''(''\u03b7'')}} where {{math|''\u03b7'' {{=}} 2 cos(2''\u03c0''/7)}}.  Note the identity\n\n:<math>(2-\\eta)^3= 7(\\eta-1)^2,</math>\n\nexhibiting {{math|2 \u2013 ''\u03b7''}} as a prime factor of 7 in the ring of algebraic integers.\n\nThe group {{math|\u0393(''I'')}} is a subgroup of the [[(2,3,7) triangle group|(2,3,7)]] hyperbolic [[triangle group]].  Namely, {{math|\u0393(''I'')}} is a subgroup of the group of elements of unit norm in the quaternion algebra generated as an associative algebra by the generators {{mvar|i,j}} and relations \n\n:<math>i^2=j^2=\\eta, \\qquad ij=-ji.</math>\n\nOne chooses a suitable [[Hurwitz quaternion order]] <math>\\mathcal Q_{\\mathrm{Hur}}</math> in the quaternion algebra, {{math|\u0393(''I'')}} is then the group of norm 1 elements in <math>1+I\\mathcal Q_{\\mathrm{Hur}}</math>.  The least absolute value of a trace of a hyperbolic element in {{math|\u0393(''I'')}} is <math>\\eta^2+3\\eta+2</math>, corresponding the value 3.936 for the [[systolic geometry|systole]] of the Klein quartic, one of the highest in this genus.\n\n==Tiling==\n[[File:3-7 kisrhombille.svg|thumb|The tiling of the quartic by reflection domains is a quotient of the [[3-7 kisrhombille]].]]\nThe Klein quartic admits tilings connected with the symmetry group (a \"[[Regular map (graph theory)|regular map]]\"<ref name=\"scholl\"/>), and these are used in understanding the symmetry group, dating back to Klein's original paper. Given a [[fundamental domain]] for the group action (for the full, orientation-reversing symmetry group, a (2,3,7) triangle), the reflection domains (images of this domain under the group) give a tiling of the quartic such that the automorphism group of the tiling equals the automorphism group of the surface \u2013 reflections in the lines of the tiling correspond to the reflections in the group (reflections in the lines of a given fundamental triangle give a set of 3 generating reflections). This tiling is a quotient of the [[order-3 bisected heptagonal tiling]] of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] (the [[universal cover]] of the quartic), and all Hurwitz surfaces are tiled in the same way, as quotients.\n\nThis tiling is uniform but not regular (it is by [[scalene triangle]]s), and often regular tilings are used instead. A quotient of any tiling in the [[Uniform_tilings_in_hyperbolic_plane#The_.5B7.2C3.5D_.287_3_2.29_group_family|(2,3,7) family]] can be used (and will have the same automorphism group); of these, the two regular tilings are the tiling by 24 regular hyperbolic [[heptagon]]s, each of degree 3 (meeting at 56 vertices), and the dual tiling by 56 [[equilateral triangle]]s, each of degree 7 (meeting at 24 vertices). The order of the automorphism group is related, being the number of polygons times the number of edges in the polygon in both cases.\n:24 &times; 7 = 168\n:56 &times; 3 = 168\nThe covering tilings on the hyperbolic plane are the [[order-3 heptagonal tiling]] and the [[order-7 triangular tiling]].\n\nThe automorphism group can be augmented (by a symmetry which is not realized by a symmetry of the tiling) to yield the [[Mathieu group]] M<sub>24</sub>.<ref name=\"richter\"/>\n\nCorresponding to each ''tiling'' of the quartic (partition of the quartic variety into subsets) is an [[abstract polyhedron]], which abstracts from the geometry and only reflects the combinatorics of the tiling (this is a general way of obtaining an [[abstract polytope]] from a tiling) \u2013 the vertices, edges, and faces of the polyhedron are equal as sets to the vertices, edges, and faces of the tiling, with the same incidence relations, and the (combinatorial) automorphism group of the abstract polyhedron equals the (geometric) automorphism group of the quartic. In this way the geometry reduces to combinatorics.\n\n=== Affine quartic ===\nThe above is a tiling of the ''projective'' quartic (a closed manifold); the affine quartic has 24 cusps (topologically, punctures), which correspond to the 24 vertices of the regular triangular tiling, or equivalently the centers of the 24 heptagons in the heptagonal tiling, and can be realized as follows.\n\nConsidering the action of {{math|SL(2, '''R''')}} on the [[Poincar\u00e9 half-plane model|upper half-plane model]] {{math|'''H'''<sup>2</sup>}} of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] by [[M\u00f6bius transformation]]s, the affine Klein quartic can be realized as the quotient {{math|\u0393(7)\\'''H'''<sup>2</sup>}}. (Here {{math|\u0393(7)}} is the [[congruence subgroup]] of {{math|SL(2, '''Z''')}} consisting of matrices that are congruent to the identity matrix when all entries are taken [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 7.)\n\n== Fundamental domain and pants decomposition ==\nThe Klein quartic can be obtained as the quotient of the hyperbolic plane by the action of a Fuchsian group. The [[fundamental domain]] is a regular 14-gon, which has area <math>8\\pi</math> by the [[Gauss-Bonnet theorem]]. This can be seen in the adjoining figure, which also includes the 336 (2,3,7) triangles that tessellate the surface and generate its group of symmetries.\n[[File:Fundamental domain of Klein quartic.svg|thumb|right|The fundamental domain of the Klein quartic. The surface is obtained by associating sides with equal numbers.]]\nWithin the tessellation by (2,3,7) triangles is a tessellation by 24 regular heptagons. The systole of the surface passes though the midpoints of 8 heptagon sides; for this reason it has been referred to as an \"eight step geodesic\" in the literature, and is the reason for the title of the book in the section below. All the coloured curves in the figure showing the pants decomposition are systoles, however, this is just a subset; there are 21 in total. The length of the systole is \n:<math>16\\sinh^{-1}\\left(\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\csc^2\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{7}\\right)-4}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{7}\\right)\\right)\\approx3.93594624883.</math>\n\nAn equivalent closed formula is\n\n:<math>8\\cosh^{-1}\\left(\\tfrac{3}{2}-2\\sin^2\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{7}\\right)\\right).</math>\n\nWhilst the Klein quartic maximises the symmetry group for surfaces of genus 3, it does not maximise the systole length. The conjectured maximiser is the surface referred to as \"M3\" {{Harv|Schmutz|1993}}. M3 comes from a tessellation of (2,3,12) triangles, and its systole has multiplicity 24 and length\n:<math>2\\cosh^{-1}\\left(2+\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\approx3.9833047820988736.</math>\n\n[[File:Kleinpants.png|thumb|right|A pants decomposition of the Klein quartic. The figure on the left shows the boundary geodesics in the (2,3,7) tessellation of the fundamental domain. In the figure to the right, the pants have each been coloured differently to make it clear which part of the fundamental domain belongs to which pair of pants.]]\n\nThe Klein quartic can be decomposed into four [[pair of pants (mathematics)|pairs of pants]] by cutting along six of its systoles. This decomposition gives a symmetric set of [[Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates]], where the length parameters are all equal to the length of the systole, and the twist parameters are all equal to <math>\\tfrac{1}{8}</math> of the length of the systole. In particular, taking <math>l(S)</math> to be the systole length, the coordinates are\n\n:<math>\\left\\{l(S),\\tfrac{l(S)}{8};l(S),\\tfrac{l(S)}{8};l(S),\\tfrac{l(S)}{8};l(S),\\tfrac{l(S)}{8};l(S),\\tfrac{l(S)}{8};l(S),\\tfrac{l(S)}{8}\\right\\}.</math>\n\nThe [[cubic graph]] corresponding to this pants decomposition is the tetrahedral graph, that is, the graph of 4 nodes, each connected to the other 3. The tetrahedral graph is similar to the graph for the projective [[Fano plane]]; indeed, the automorphism group of the Klein quartic is isomorphic to that of the Fano plane.\n\n== Spectral theory ==\n\n[[File:Kleineigenspacevsmall.png|thumb|right|The eight functions corresponding to the first positive eigenvalue of the Klein quartic. The functions are zero along the light blue lines. These plots were produced in [[FreeFEM++]].]]\n\nLittle has been proved about the [[spectral theory]] of the Klein quartic, however, it has been conjectured that the it maximises the first positive eigenvalue of the Laplace operator among all compact Riemann surfaces of genus 3 with constant negative curvature. This conjecture comes from the fact that the Klein quartic has the largest symmetry group of surfaces in its topological class, much like the [[Bolza surface]] in genus 2. Eigenvalues of the Klein quartic have been calculated to varying degrees of accuracy. The first 15 distinct positive eigenvalues are shown in the following table, along with their multiplicities.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Numerical computations of the first 15 positive eigenvalues of the Klein quartic\n|-\n!

The resulting models most often have either tetrahedral (order 12) or octahedral (order 24) symmetries; the remaining order 7 symmetry cannot be as easily visualized, and in fact is the title of Klein's paper.\n\n[[File:The Eightfold Way - Silvio Levy - cover.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Eightfold Way'' \u2013 sculpture by [[Helaman Ferguson]] and accompanying book.]]\nMost often, the quartic is modeled either by a smooth genus 3 surface with tetrahedral symmetry (replacing the edges of a regular tetrahedron with tubes/handles yields such a shape), which have been dubbed \"tetruses\",<ref name=\"sequin\" /> or by polyhedral approximations, which have been dubbed \"tetroids\";<ref name=\"sequin\" /> in both cases this is an ''embedding'' of the shape in 3 dimensions. The most notable smooth model (tetrus) is the sculpture ''The Eightfold Way'' by [[Helaman Ferguson]] at the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] in [[Berkeley, California]], made of marble and serpentine, and unveiled on November 14, 1993. The title refers to the fact that starting at any vertex of the triangulated surface and moving along any edge, if you alternately turn left and right when reaching a vertex, you always return to the original point after eight edges.  The acquisition of the sculpture led in due course to the publication of a book of papers {{Harv|Levy|1999}}, detailing properties of the quartic and containing the first English translation of Klein's paper. Polyhedral models with tetrahedral symmetry most often have [[convex hull]] a [[truncated tetrahedron]] \u2013 see {{Harv|Schulte|Wills|1985}} and {{Harv|Scholl|Sch\u00fcrmann|Wills|2002}} for examples and illustrations. Some of these models consist of 20 triangles or 56 triangles (abstractly, the [[regular skew polyhedron]] {3,7|,4}, with 56 faces, 84 edges, and 24 vertices), which cannot be realized as equilateral, with twists in the arms of the tetrahedron; while others have 24 heptagons \u2013 these heptagons can be taken to be planar, though non-convex,<ref name=\"schulte\">{{Harv|Schulte|Wills|1985}}</ref> and the models are more complex than the triangular ones because the complexity is reflected in the shapes of the (non-flexible) heptagonal faces, rather than in the (flexible) vertices.<ref name=\"scholl\"/>\n\n[[File:Small cubicuboctahedron.png|thumb|The [[small cubicuboctahedron]] is a polyhedral immersion of the tiling of the Klein quartic with octahedral symmetry.]]\nAlternatively, the quartic can be modeled by a polyhedron with octahedral symmetry: Klein modeled the quartic by a shape with octahedral symmetries and with points at infinity (an \"open polyhedron\"),<ref name=\"westendorp\" /> namely three [[hyperboloid]]s meeting on orthogonal axes,<ref name=\"scholl\"/> while it can also be modeled as a closed polyhedron which must be ''immersed'' (have self-intersections), not embedded.<ref name=\"scholl\"/> Such polyhedra may have various convex hulls, including the [[truncated cube]],<ref name=\"egan\">[http://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/KleinQuartic/KleinQuartic.html Klein's Quartic Curve], by Greg Egan</ref> the [[snub cube]],<ref name=\"schulte\"/> or the [[rhombicuboctahedron]], as in the [[small cubicuboctahedron]] at right.<ref name=\"richter\">{{Harv|Richter}}</ref> The small cubicuboctahedron immersion is obtained by joining some of the triangles (2 triangles form a square, 6 form an octagon), which can be visualized by [http://homepages.wmich.edu/~drichter/images/mathieu/hypercolors.jpg coloring the triangles] (the corresponding tiling is topologically but not geometrically the [[:File:Uniform tiling 443-t01.png|3 4 &#124; 4 tiling]]). This immersion can also be used to geometrically construct the [[Mathieu group]] M<sub>24</sub> by adding to PSL(2,7) the permutation which interchanges opposite points of the bisecting lines of the squares and octagons.<ref name=\"richter\" />\n\n==Dessin d'enfants==\nThe [[dessin d'enfant]] on the Klein quartic associated with the quotient map by its automorphism group (with quotient the Riemann sphere) is precisely the 1-skeleton of the order-3 heptagonal tiling.<ref>{{citation | last = le Bruyn | first = Lieven | title = The best rejected proposal ever | date = 7 March 2007 | url = http://www.neverendingbooks.org/index.php/the-best-rejected-proposal-ever.html | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140227065015/http://www.neverendingbooks.org/index.php/the-best-rejected-proposal-ever.html | archivedate = 27 February 2014 }}.</ref> That is, the quotient map is ramified over the points {{math|0, 1728}}, and {{math|\u221e}}; dividing by 1728 yields a [[Belyi function]] (ramified at {{math|0, 1}}, and {{math|\u221e}}), where the 56 vertices (black points in dessin) lie over 0, the midpoints of the 84 edges (white points in dessin) lie over 1, and the centers of the 24 heptagons lie over infinity. The resulting dessin is a \"platonic\" dessin, meaning edge-transitive and \"clean\" (each white point has valence 2).\n\n==Related surfaces==\nThe Klein quartic is related to various other surfaces.\n\nGeometrically, it is the smallest [[Hurwitz surface]] (lowest genus); the next is the [[Macbeath surface]] (genus 7), and the following is the [[First Hurwitz triplet]] (3 surfaces of genus 14). More generally, it is the most symmetric surface of a given genus (being a Hurwitz surface); in this class, the [[Bolza surface]] is the most symmetric genus 2 surface, while [[Bring's surface]] is a highly symmetric genus 4 surface \u2013 see [[Riemann_surface#Isometries_of_Riemann_surfaces|isometries of Riemann surfaces]] for further discussion.\n\nAlgebraically, the (affine) Klein quartic is the [[modular curve]] X(7) and the projective Klein quartic is its compactification, just as the dodecahedron (with a cusp in the center of each face) is the modular curve X(5); this explains the relevance for number theory.\n\nMore subtly, the (projective) Klein quartic is a [[Shimura curve]] (as are the Hurwitz surfaces of genus 7 and 14), and as such parametrizes [[Principally polarized abelian variety|principally polarized abelian varieties]] of dimension 6.<ref>Elkies, section 4.4 (pp. 94\u201397) in {{Harv|Levy|1999}}.</ref>\n\nThere are also other [[quartic surface]]s of interest \u2013 see [[Quartic surface#Special quartic surfaces|special quartic surfaces]].\n\nMore exceptionally, the Klein quartic forms part of a \"[[ADE classification#Trinities|trinity]]\" in the sense of [[Vladimir Arnold]], which can also be described as a [[McKay correspondence]]. In this collection, the [[projective special linear group]]s PSL(2,5), PSL(2,7), and PSL(2,11) (orders 60, 168, 660) are analogous, corresponding to [[icosahedral symmetry]] (genus 0), the symmetries of the Klein quartic (genus 3), and the [[buckyball surface]] (genus 70).<ref name=\"martin\">{{citation | last1 = Martin | first2 = Pablo | last2 = Singerman | first1 = David | title = From Biplanes to the Klein quartic and the Buckyball | url = http://www.neverendingbooks.org/DATA/biplanesingerman.pdf | date = April 17, 2008 }}</ref> These are further connected to many other exceptional phenomena, which is elaborated at \"[[ADE classification#Trinities|trinities]]\".\n\n==See also==\n*[[Gr\u00fcnbaum\u2013Rigby configuration]]\n*[[Shimura curve]]\n*[[Hurwitz surface]]\n*[[Bolza surface]]\n*[[Bring's curve]]\n*[[Macbeath surface]]\n*[[First Hurwitz triplet]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Literature==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite journal | ref={{Harvid|Klein|1878b}}| last=Klein | first = F. | authorlink = Felix Klein| year = 1878| title = Ueber die Transformation siebenter Ordnung der elliptischen Functionen|trans-title=On the order-seven transformation of elliptic functions| doi = 10.1007/BF01677143| journal = Mathematische Annalen | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 428\u2013471| url=https://zenodo.org/record/1635511 }} Translated in {{Cite book | editor1-last=Levy | editor1-first=Silvio | year=1999  | title= The Eightfold Way | url=http://www.msri.org/communications/books/Book35/index.html | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=978-0-521-66066-2 | mr=1722410 | ref=harv}}\n*{{citation|authorlink=Noam Elkies|last=Elkies|first= N.|chapter= Shimura curve computations|title=  Algorithmic number theory (Portland, OR, 1998)|pages= 1\u201347|series= Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume= 1423|publisher= Springer|place= Berlin|year=1998|arxiv=math.NT/0005160|mr=1726059|doi=10.1007/BFb0054850|isbn=978-3-540-64657-0}}\n*{{Citation | editor1-last=Levy | editor1-first=Silvio | title= The Eightfold Way | url=http://www.msri.org/communications/books/Book35/index.html | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | series=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute Publications | isbn=978-0-521-66066-2 | mr=1722410 | year=1999 | volume=35}}.

Kraft sold its ice cream brands to [[Unilever]] in 1993, while retaining the rights to the name for yogurt products.<ref name=History />\n\n==Ice cream==\nPrior to 2006,<ref name=\"Tara Gum\" /> Breyers was known for producing [[ice cream]] with a small number of [[Natural foods|all-natural]] ingredients. \n\nIn recent years, as part of [[cost reduction|cost-cutting]] measures since their move from [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]], to Unilever's U.S. headquarters in [[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]],<ref name=\"Green Bay\" /> Unilever has reformulated many of its flavors with nontraditional, additive ingredients, significantly changing the taste and texture of their desserts as a result.<ref name=\"Tara Gum\" /> Following similar practices by several of their competitors, and to the consternation of many former customers,<ref name=\"Tara Gum\" /> Breyers' list of ingredients has expanded to include thickeners, low-cost sweeteners, food coloring and low-cost additives \u2014 including natural additives such as [[tara gum]]<ref name=\"Natural Vanilla\" /> and [[Locust bean gum|carob bean gum]];<ref name=\"Creamy Vanilla\" /> artificial additives such as [[maltodextrin]] and [[propylene glycol]];<ref name=\"Oreo Cookies\" /> and common artificially separated and extracted ingredients such as [[corn syrup]], [[whey]], and others.<ref name=\"Creamy Vanilla\" /><ref name=\"Oreo Cookies\" />  An ingredient list for Breyers Frozen Dairy Dessert may now include up to forty ingredients:\n\n{{quote|Ingredients: milk, skim milk, sugar, corn syrup, cream, maltodextrin, whey, cellulose gel, mono & diglycerides, guar gum, cellulose gum, natural flavor, carob bean gum, carrageenan. caramel swirl: sugar, water, corn syrup, [[high fructose corn syrup]], non fat milk solids, butter, salt, molasses, pectin, soy lecithin, sodium citrate, natural flavor, lactic acid, potassium sorbate. waffle cone pieces: fudge coating (sugar, coconut oil, cocoa powder, nonfat milk powder, whole milk powder, anhydrous milkfat, soy lecithin, vanilla), waffle cones (unenriched wheat flour, sugar, corn starch, palm and/or soybean oil, bamboo fiber, soy lecithin, natural flavor, soy flour, salt), natural flavor.}}\n\nOne result of these cost-cutting practices has been that many of Breyers' products no longer contain enough milk and cream to meet labeling requirements for ice cream, and are now labeled \"Frozen Dairy Dessert\" in the United States<ref name=\"Frozen Dairy Dessert\" /> and \"Frozen Dessert\" in Canada.<ref name=Canada /><ref name=Canada2 />\n\nFor several decades over 30% of Breyers products, including most of its products sold in the [[northeastern U.S.]], were produced in a large plant outside [[Boston]], in [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]], [[Massachusetts]]. As part of cost-cutting by Unilever, the plant was closed in March 2011.<ref name=Framingham />\n\n==Marketing==\nIn the 1980s, when Breyers produced all-natural ice cream, the company ran a television advertising campaign in [[North America]] featuring a child who attempted to read an ingredients list from another ice cream brand and experienced extreme difficulty pronouncing several listed artificial additives. The child then turned to the Breyers list and quickly rattled off the four ingredients on the label of their vanilla ice cream: [[milk]], [[cream]], [[sugar]], and [[vanilla]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Confusion with Dreyer's==\nIn the [[Western U.S.]] and [[Texas]],<ref name=IceCream /> Breyers ice cream is sometimes confused with [[Dreyer's]] ice cream.{{cn|date=September 2014}}  Henry Breyer founded ''Breyers'' in 1908 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], while  William Dreyer and Joseph Edy co-founded Edy's Grand Ice Cream in 1928 in [[Oakland, California]].

As part of cost-cutting by Unilever, the plant was closed in March 2011.<ref name=Framingham />\n\n==Marketing==\nIn the 1980s, when Breyers produced all-natural ice cream, the company ran a television advertising campaign in [[North America]] featuring a child who attempted to read an ingredients list from another ice cream brand and experienced extreme difficulty pronouncing several listed artificial additives. The child then turned to the Breyers list and quickly rattled off the four ingredients on the label of their vanilla ice cream: [[milk]], [[cream]], [[sugar]], and [[vanilla]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Confusion with Dreyer's==\nIn the [[Western U.S.]] and [[Texas]],<ref name=IceCream /> Breyers ice cream is sometimes confused with [[Dreyer's]] ice cream.{{cn|date=September 2014}}  Henry Breyer founded ''Breyers'' in 1908 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], while  William Dreyer and Joseph Edy co-founded Edy's Grand Ice Cream in 1928 in [[Oakland, California]].

The waterway links [[Llangollen]] in [[Denbighshire]], north Wales, with [[Hurleston]] in south [[Cheshire]], via the town of [[Ellesmere, Shropshire]]. The name, which was coined in the 1980s, is a modern designation for parts of the historic [[Ellesmere Canal]] and the Llangollen navigable feeder, both of which became part of the [[Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company|Shropshire Union Canals]] in 1846.\n\nThe Ellesmere Canal was proposed by industrialists at [[Ruabon]] and [[Brymbo]], and two disconnected sections were built. The northern section ran from Ellesmere Port on the [[River Mersey]] to [[Chester]], where it joined the [[Chester Canal]], and opened in 1795. Work on the southern section began at Frankton, with a line southwards to Llanymynech, and subsequently, a second section was built westwards towards Trevor. This involved crossing the [[River Ceiriog|Afon Ceiriog]] and the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]], which was achieved by building two vast aqueducts, using iron troughs to contain the water. The Ceiriog was crossed at [[Chirk]], and [[Chirk Aqueduct]] opened in 1801, to exploit local supplies of iron and coal. The canal then passed through [[Chirk Tunnel]], and reached the southern end of [[Pontcysyllte Aqueduct]] in 1802, which was not completed until 1805. To join the two halves up, a heavily engineered route from [[Trevor Basin]] via Ruabon and Brymbo to the River Dee at Chester was planned, but very little of it was built. Instead, the present route from Frankton to Hurleston Junction on the Chester Canal was constructed, and opened in 1805. As the route never reached the water reservoir at [[Moss Valley, Wrexham]] (built in 1786), a navigable feeder was built to Llantisilio where the [[Horseshoe Falls (Wales)|Horseshoe Falls]] weir was constructed on the River Dee to supply the canal.\n\nAs part of the Shropshire Union system, the canal from Hurleston to Llangollen thrived until the end of the First World War, after which it saw very little traffic. Navigation was formally abandoned under the terms of an Act of Abandonment obtained by the owners, the [[London Midland and Scottish Railway]], in 1944, but the channel was retained as it still supplied water to the main line of the Shropshire Union, and subsequently to the Mid & South East Cheshire Water Board. This arrangement was due to end in 1954, but as there was no alternative supply of water, the powers were extended. Early pioneering cruises of the waterway were made by [[L.T.C. Rolt|Tom Rolt]] in 1947 and 1949, and despite being officially closed, a number of boats started to use it. There was a growing campaign to reopen it, but it was still designated as one of the 'waterways having insufficient commercial prospects to justify their retention for navigation' under government papers published in 1955 and 1958. It was not until the passing of the Transport Act 1968 that the route was finally designated as a cruiseway, and its future was secured. As leisure use of the canals grew, the route was rebranded as \"The Llangollen Canal\" in the 1980s, and it has become one of the most popular routes for holidaymakers. Its importance in the history of the British canal system was recognised in 2009, when the {{convert|11|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch from Gledrid Bridge near Rhoswiel to Horseshoe Falls including Pontcysyllte and Chirk aqueducts was declared a [[World Heritage site]] by [[UNESCO]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Camlas ellesmere.png|thumb|left|Map showing the planned route for the [[Ellesmere Canal]] between Chester and [[Shrewsbury]]. The feeder to Llangollen was never envisaged in the original proposal.]]\nA grand plan for the Ellesmere Canal was first proposed in 1791 by a small group of industrialists who owned coal mines, iron mines and other works near Ruabon. They wanted to link their area to the [[River Mersey]] in the north and the [[River Severn]] to the south. The northward section would link up with the [[Chester Canal]] and hence the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]] before continuing to the Mersey at Netherpool (now [[Ellesmere Port]]). The southerly section of the waterway would pass through [[Overton-on-Dee|Overton]] before heading towards [[Shrewsbury]]. There would be branches to Bersham and Brymbo, where there were ironworks, to Llanymynech, where limestone was being quarried, and it would run past [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]] to Prees. A rival group proposed a branch from the Chester Canal to reach Ruabon, via Whitchurch, with additional lines to Llanymynech and Shrewsbury. There was support for the plans of the first group, and work began, but twelve years later, the plans of the second group had largely been implemented.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |pp=166-167}}\n\nJohn Duncombe, an engineer who was one of the original promoters, and Joseph Turner estimated that the main line to Netherpool and to Shrewsbury would cost \u00a367,456, while the whole scheme, including the branches, would cost \u00a3171,098.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |pp=167-169}} The promoters then decided they needed an engineer with a track record to advise them, and engaged the services of [[William Jessop]], to be assisted by Duncombe and William Turner. Jessop proposed a somewhat different route south of Chester. It was the time of [[Canal Mania]], and when subscriptions were opened, 1,234 subscribers offered a total of \u00a3967,700, of which \u00a3245,500 was actually accepted. In February 1793, the two groups decided to work together, and a host of deviations and alterations were made to the plans, for which an [[Act of Parliament]] was obtained on 30 April 1793. A capital of \u00a3400,000 was authorised, with powers to raise an additional \u00a3100,000 if required, and Jessop was appointed as engineer, to be assisted by Duncombe, Thomas Denson and William Turner. On 30 October, [[Thomas Telford]] was also engaged.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |pp=168-169}}\n\nWork began on the route southwards from Netherpool in November 1793, and packet boats started to run along it from 1 July 1795, although it was not quite finished. Three locks to connect it to the Mersey were completed in early 1796, and coal was first carried to Chester in February. The connection to the Chester Canal took a little longer, and was completed in January 1797.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=169}} The company were keen to develop the trade in limestone from Llanymynech, and cutting of the canal southwards from Frankton began in early 1794. At the time, plans for the Montgomeryshire Canal were before Parliament, which would continue southwards from Carreghofa, just beyond Llanymynech. With four locks at Frankton, and another three at Aston, the line to Carreghofa was opened in autumn 1796, and a good trade in limestone northwards, and goods southwards to the Montgomeryshire Canal, developed.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=169}}\n\nProgress north-westwards from Frankton towards [[Trevor Basin|Trevor]] was hampered by the need to cross two rivers, the Afon Ceiriog at Chirk and the Dee at Pontcysyllte. Both would require tall aqueducts, but to save construction costs at Pontcysylle, plans were drawn up for three locks at each end, to reduce the height of the main arches by {{convert|50|ft|m}}. However, on 14 July 1795 Jessop proposed that the aqueduct should be built {{convert|125|ft|m}} above the Dee, and that the costs should be saved by using an iron trough. He also proposed a similar trough at Chirk, instead of an embankment at Pont-faen, writing that \"instead of an obstruction it would be a romantic feature in the view\", and this was a major factor in persuading the landowner to allow it to be built at Chirk, rather than at Pont-faen. The foundation stone for Pontcysyllte was laid on 25 July 1795, although the committee did not formally approve the new plans until 10 August.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |pp=170-171}}\n\nAgain, the company was keen to get trade moving on the canal, and pressed on with the line from Chirk to Frankton. The Vron Ironworks were at Chirk, with coal mines nearby, and goods from Ruabon could also be brought there by road, until the canal was completed. Work started on the Chirk aqueduct in January 1796, and when finished, it was {{convert|600|ft|m}} long with ten arches, each with a span of {{convert|40|ft|m}}, carrying the canal {{convert|70|ft|m}} above the Afon Ceiriog. It was constructed with a cast-iron bottom to the trough, but the sides were of masonry, an unusual choice given the decision to use a cast-iron trough at Pontcysyllte. The {{convert|8|mi|km|adj=on}} section from Chirk to Frankton included six locks and was completed in 1801. The section onwards through [[Chirk Tunnel|Chirk]] and Whitehouses tunnels, to reach the southern end of Pontcysyllte, opened in June 1802.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=173}}\n\nIn July 1795, the company hired contractors to start work on the branch from Hordley, near Frankton locks, to Westoncommon, which was completed in 1797. A wharf, public house, stables and other features were constructed near Westoncommon, and four lime kilns were built, to burn lime from Llanymynech using coal from Chirk. Plans for this branch to continue onwards to Shrewsbury were dropped, because lime from Weston would have to compete with that brought along the Shrewsbury Canal, and coal to supply the domestic market at Shrewsbury would not be available until Pontcysyllte aqueduct was completed. It did not appear that the route would be profitable, and this remained true when the plans were reconsidered subsequently.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |pp=173-174}}\n\n===Joining the two halves===\n{{Llangollen Canal map}}\nPlans for joining the southern sections to the northern one were revisited by Telford in 1795, and after approval by Jessop, were authorised by Act of Parliament in 1796. They involved a heavily engineered line from Trevor to Chester, via [[Ruabon]] to the Dee at Chester, with a branch to [[Coed Talon]], which would serve the [[Brymbo]] ironworks near Ffrwd. Locks would lift the line by {{convert|76|ft|m}} from Trevor basin to Plas Kynaston, after which it would run on the level to Poolmouth and the junction with the Coed Talon Branch. It would then descend through a long flight of locks, roughly following the line of the later Chester to Wrexham railway, to enter the Dee opposite the branch to the Chester Canal. A second branch would run from Pulford to Farndon and Holt. Just over {{convert|2|mi|km}} of the Coed Talon branch was built, to a basin near Ffrwd, and although it was filled with water, it seems that it was never used, and was filled in again from 1809.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=174}}\n\nIn early 1794, a shareholder and a local landowner took out a patent for a canal lift, and offered to build a trial one. If it proved successful, then the Ellesmere company would pay for it, and if not, the inventors would meet the costs. A site was chosen on the proposed line, and by May 1796, it was ready for trials to begin. John Rennie and Jessop examined it, but like several similar ideas of the time, it was not felt to be robust enough to withstand the rigours of daily use. The company eventually paid \u00a3200 to the inventors, one quarter of the actual costs.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=174}} Jessop decided in 1800 that the route between Trevor and Chester should be abandoned, due to the changes in circumstances, and coal being available in Chester from a number of other locations.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=176}}\n\nThe Chester Canal, which had not been a financial success, had hoped that links with the Ellesmere Canal would improve their prospects, but when the Ellesmere Act of 1796 had failed to mention any connection with the Chester Canal, they had taken action, and had cut off the water supply to the northern section from Chester to Ellesmere Port. When agreement was reached on a new line from [[Frankton Junction]] to [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]], the water supply was reinstated, and work on the new line started in February 1797. The work was difficult, as it had to cross Whixall Moss, and a {{convert|261|ft|m|adj=on}} tunnel was required near [[Ellesmere, Shropshire|Ellesmere]]. It also included a branch to Prees Higher Heath, but only {{convert|3.75|mi|km|0}} of this was built, terminating at Quina Brook, where the company built some limekilns. By 1804, the main line had reached Tilstock Park, some {{convert|4|mi|km}} short of Whitchurch.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |pp=177-178}}\n\nFurther agreement had been reached in 1802 on a route from Tilstock Park to [[Hurleston Junction]], on which work started immediately. It was completed on 25 March 1805. In order to keep the system supplied with water, an Act of Parliament obtained in 1804 had authorised the construction of a navigable feeder from the north end of Pontcysyllte aqueduct to LLangollen on onwards to Llantisilo, where the [[Horseshoe Falls (Wales)|Horseshoe Falls]] weir would be constructed on the River Dee. Once this opened in 1808, the system was not short of water. The Ellesmere company attempted to buy out the Chester Canal in 1804, but the offer had been refused. In 1813, they agreed to an amalgamation, on terms much worse than those offered in 1804, and the two companies became one from 1 July 1813.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |pp=178-179}}\n\nThe network expanded with the opening of the Middlewich Branch on 1 September 1833,{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=181}} and the completion on the [[Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal]] from Nantwich Basin to Autherley on 2 March 1835.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=186}} In May 1845, the Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company obtained an Act of Parliament to enable them to absorb the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, the Montgomeryshire Canal, the [[Shrewsbury Canal]] and the [[Shropshire Canal]]. The name was changed to the [[Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company]] in 1846, with powers to build a number of railways or convert their canals into railways,{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |pp=232-233}} but this vision was short-lived, and they agreed to a lease with the [[London and North Western Railway]] in late 1846. An Act of Parliament was obtained to authorise this in 1847, but was not formally enacted until 1857.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |pp=233-234}} This ended their aspirations to build railways, but they remained remarkably independent despite railway control.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=235}} The Shropshire Union was absorbed by the London and North Western Railway in late 1922, which itself became part of the [[London Midland and Scottish Railway]] soon afterwards.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |pp=249-250}}\n\n===Decline===\nAfter the takeover by the London Midland and Scottish Railway, regular maintenance was often not carried out, and gradually the canals silted up, so that boats could not operate with full loads. Traffic declined, and was significantly affected by a breach that occurred at the Perry Aqueduct, about {{convert|1|mi|km}} to the south of Frankton locks, which effectively closed the Montgomeryshire Canal to all traffic.{{sfn |Nicholson |2006 |p=65}} Traffic beyond Frankton to Llangollen had ceased in 1937, and the Frankton to Hurleston section was not used after 1939. The London Midland and Scottish Railway obtained an Act of Abandonment in 1944, allowing it to close {{convert|175|mi|km}} of canals, including much of the Shropshire Union system. However, the line from Hurleston to Llangollen and onwards to Llantisilio was saved, as it was the main supply of water to the rest of the system.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=251}}\n\nOn 6 September 1945, due to inadequate maintenance, the canal breached its banks east of [[Llangollen]] near [[Sun Bank Halt]]. The flow of hundreds of tons of water washed away the embankment of the railway further down the hill, creating a crater which was {{convert|40|yd|m}} long and {{convert|50|ft|m}} deep.{{sfn |McKnight |1987 |p=28}} This caused the first traffic of the morning, a mail and goods train composed of 16 carriages and two vans, to crash into the breach, killing one and injuring two engine crew.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.llangollen-railway.co.uk/hist/accid.html |work=The Llangollen Railway's History |title=1945: The Sun Bank Halt Accident |publisher=Llangollen Railway |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101023203/http://www.llangollen-railway.co.uk/hist/accid.html |archivedate=1 January 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northeast/sites/denbighshire/pages/int-eist1.shtml |title=BBC News \u2013 North East Wales |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> Despite the canal being officially closed, the breach was repaired, so that water could continue to reach the main line at Hurleston. The use of the canal as a water supply channel was further bolstered by an agreement with what became the Mid & South East Cheshire Water Board,{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=251}} who used it to supply water to their Hurleston reservoir, and agreed to maintain it.\n\n== Restoration ==\nAlthough there had been little traffic since the end of the First World War, the channel had remained watered, because it supplied the main line of the Shropshire Union Canal. In the period after the Second World War, there was growing interest in using the canals for leisure cruising, and the pioneer [[L. T. C. Rolt|Tom Rolt]] attempted to cruise the canal in 1947.{{sfn |Davies |2005 |p=84}} Rolt's boat was ''Cressy'', which had been converted at Frankton to steam power, and on which Rolt had sailed westwards from Frankton Junction with Kyrle Willans after its conversion in 1930. At that time they had failed to reach Pontcysyllte.{{sfn |Bolton |1990 |p=36}} On this occasion, he was joined by a small cruiser named ''Heron'', crewed by the Grundy family from Liverpool. The state of the canal was poor, and several of the locks were disintegrating, but despite low water levels and thick weed growth, both boats eventually reached Ellesmere. They then found that the water supply had been cut off due to a broken culvert near Chirk. After several weeks of being stranded, Rolt talked to the Chester office, and they arranged for water to be let down the canal, to enable the boats to return to Hurleston.{{sfn |Bolton |1990 |pp=37-38}} On a second attempt two years later, Rolt and his wife reached Pontcysyllte,{{sfn |Davies |2005 |p=84}} which they crossed accompanied by the actor [[Hugh Griffith]] and his wife Gunde. The Rolts moored for nearly three months just beyond the aqueduct, near the site where their boat had been built during the First World War.{{sfn |Bolton |1990 |pp=36,56}} In August they were joined by Roger Calvert and his family, who were attempting to reach the top of the canal in a home-made boat, which was pulled by a donkey. The Rolts travelled with them for part of the journey.{{sfn |Bolton |1990 |p=58}} Edward Wilson, another canal enthusiast, reached Trevor in his boat in 1952, and the [[Inland Waterways Association]] held a rally at Llangollen later that year.{{sfn |Davies |2005 |p=84}}\n\nBy 1954, the Llangollen Canal was in a curious position. Under the terms of the LMSR Act of abandonment, obtained in 1944, navigation had been abandoned, but the right to sell water had been retained. This was to be for a period of ten years, during which those who bought the water were required to make alternative arrangements, which they failed to do. Since the nationalisation of the canals in 1948, the canal had been managed by the [[British Transport Commission]], who had to obtain Parliamentary approval to extend this arrangement. Meanwhile, a number of pleasure boats had ventured onto the canal, and there was a growing campaign to reopen the canal for navigation. A committee to spearhead this had been formed, and was chaired by the clerk for Wrexham Rural District Council, Trevor Williams. More than thirty other organisations were supporting the move, including the British Travel and Holidays Association.{{sfn |Bolton |1990 |pp=110-111}}\n\nIn 1955, the Board of Survey, a committee chaired by Lord Rusholme, had produced a report on the future of the canals under the control of the British Transport Commission, which they had divided into three categories. There were {{convert|336|mi|km}} of 'waterways to be developed', another {{convert|994|mi|km}} of 'waterways to be retained', and finally {{convert|771|mi|km}} of 'waterways having insufficient commercial prospects to justify their retention for navigation'. The Llangollen Canal was placed in the latter category, since it was still officially disused.{{sfn |Bolton |1990 |pp=116-117}} This was followed in 1958 by the Bowes Report, which suggested that the first two categories should be classified as Class A and Class B waterways, with Class B waterways put back into good working order and retained for 25 years, to attract private investment. The Llangollen Canal was still in the final category, but the report at least suggested that there should be a right of appeal against closure, and gave the first hints that such canals could be retained because of their social value for recreation.{{sfn |Bolton |1990 |p=163}}\n\nHugh McKnight, the editor of the Inland Waterways Association's ''Bulletin'', wrote an optimistic report in 1966, pointing to the achievements of the first 20 years of the organisation's existence, mentioning the changes in public opinion concerning the canals, and pointing particularly to the growth in leisure use on the Llangollen Canal and the Oxford Canal.{{sfn |Bolton |1990 |p=229}} Official attitudes changed, and the provisions of the Transport Act 1968 placed the canals under the control of the [[British Waterways Board]], who were tasked with maintaining, developing and running them for the benefit of users.{{sfn |Bolton |1990 |p=233}} The whole of the branch from Hurleston Junction to Llantisilio, just below Horseshoe Falls, was listed in the Act as a cruising waterway, meaning that its future was no longer in jeopardy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/73/schedule/12 |title=Transport Act 1968 |publisher=The National Archives |at=Schedule 12 Part II Cruising Waterways |year=1968 |accessdate=13 March 2018}}</ref> As use by leisure craft grew, the \"Llangollen Branch of the Shropshire Union\" became popular due to its aqueducts and scenery. The canal was later renamed the Llangollen Canal, becoming one of the most popular canals for holidaymakers in Britain.{{sfn |Mosse |2010 |p=248}} The name is now used for the entire route from Hurleston to Llangollen, even though it was never described in this way during its commercial life.{{sfn |Nicholson |2006 |p=17}} It is not entirely clear when the name was first applied, since it was listed as the \"Welsh Canal\", a branch of the Shropshire Union, in 1985. At that time, potential boaters were advised that the canal was a water supply channel, and that they should submit an application containing full details and dimensions of their boat if they wanted to cruise on it. Nevertheless, they were instructed that British Waterways were keen to see leisure use of the canal, and that it could be quite congested in the summer season.{{sfn |Edwards |1985 |p=304}} Its origins as parts of two separate canals can be seen from the fact that the bridges are numbered from 1 at Hurleston to 70 at Rowsons Bridge, just past Frankton Junction. Continuing along the route to Llangollen, bridge numbering restarts at 1, while bridges 71 and upwards continue along what is now the Montgomery Canal, but was formerly the Ellesmere Branch to Llanymynech, where it joined the Montgomeryshire Canal.{{sfn |Nicholson |2006 |pp=29,67}}\n\nA notable feature of the canal is the [[Pontcysyllte Aqueduct]], built by [[Thomas Telford]]. Opened in 1805, the aqueduct is more than {{convert|300|m}} long and {{convert|38|m}} above the valley floor. It has 19 stone arches, each with a 45-foot (14 metre) span. Another aqueduct carries the canal over the [[Ceiriog Valley|River Ceiriog]] at [[Chirk]], and there are tunnels nearby at Whitehouses, Chirk, and Ellesmere.\n\nThe canal also forms the boundary on two sides of the [[Fenn's, Whixall and Bettisfield Mosses NNR|Fenn's, Whixall and Bettisfield Mosses National Nature Reserve]]. In 2009 an eleven-mile section of the canal from Gledrid Bridge near Rhoswiel through to the [[Horseshoe Falls (Wales)|Horseshoe Falls]], which includes [[Chirk Aqueduct]] and [[Pontcysyllte Aqueduct]], was declared a [[World Heritage site]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/architecture_and_design/article6594604.ece |title=Unesco names Pontcysyllte aqueduct as UK's latest World Heritage site |date=28 June 2009 |accessdate=12 January 2010 |newspaper=The Times |location=London}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Llangollen canal wharf.jpg|Llangollen canal wharf.\nFile:pontcysyllte aqueduct arp.jpg|A [[narrowboat]] traverses the [[Pontcysyllte Aqueduct]].\n</gallery>\n\n== Route ==\n=== Hurleston to Frankton Junction ===\n{{Ellesmere Canal Hurleston Branch map|Hurleston to Frankton Junction}}\n\nThe canal at Hurleston Junction rises from the Shropshire Union Canal main line, through four adjacent locks, with a total rise of {{convert|34|ft|3|in|m}}.{{sfn |Nicholson |2006 |p=18}} The canal had been an early pioneer in the use of iron lock gates, instead of the more traditional wooden ones, and this material was first used on the locks at Frankton in 1819.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=179}} The four locks here have a mixture of wooden and metal gates. All were built by the engineer J Fletcher around 1805. Lock 1 has metal lower gates, and a wooden upper gate, while gates at both ends of lock 2 are made of metal.

After another mile (1.6&nbsp;km), there is a lift bridge just before the entrance to the Whitchurch Arm, which served the town of [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]].

The reserve is also a designated [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]], a European [[Special Area of Conservation]] and a Wetland of International Importance under the [[Ramsar site|Ramsar Convention]]. The bogs were drained using powers enshrined in Enclosure Acts dating from 1777 and 1823, and further drainage took place when the canal was built in 1804, and again in 1863 when a railway was built along the north-western margins. Commercial peat cutting using mechanised cutters began in 1968, but extraction ceased in 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iucn-uk-peatlandprogramme.org/sites/www.iucn-uk-peatlandprogramme.org/files/NNR_Fenns_Whixall_leaflet.pdf |title=Fenn's, Whixall and Bettisfield Mosses National Nature Reserve |publisher=Natural England |pp=4\u20135 |accessdate=13 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313214315/http://www.iucn-uk-peatlandprogramme.org/sites/www.iucn-uk-peatlandprogramme.org/files/NNR_Fenns_Whixall_leaflet.pdf |archive-date=13 March 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe technical difficulties of cutting a canal through Whixall Moss were many, but Jessop and Telford decided on a direct route across the moss, rather than building a bypass that skirted round the edge of the area.

For historic reasons the bridge numbering continues down the Montgomery Canal and a second bridge numbering series for the Llangollen Canal begins with Rowson's Bridge (which is numbered both 1W and 70). The \"W\" addition was part of a Minimum Safety Standards scheme instigated by British Waterways, to avoid possible confusion, especially for emergency services, of having different bridges on the same canal with the same number. British Waterways consulted with the Inland Waterways Association and the Shropshire Union Canal Society before finally deciding to add the \"W\", and at the same time as the numbers were altered, it ensured that all bridges carried a number on both sides. The work was due to be completed by July 2008, but there were delays due to manufacturing difficulties with the new castings.{{sfn |Minifie |2008 |p=56}}\n\nThe Llangollen Canal passes through [[Hindford]], [[St Martin's, Shropshire|Saint Martin's]], [[Preesgweene]], [[Chirk Bank]], [[Chirk]] and [[Froncysyllte]], and includes the [[Chirk Aqueduct]], the [[Chirk Tunnel]] and the [[Pontcysyllte Aqueduct]].\n\n<gallery perrow=\"3\">\nFile:FranktonJunction-01s.jpg|[[Frankton Junction]]\nFile:NewMartonBottomLock 01s.jpg|New Marton Bottom Lock\nFile:NewMartonTopLock 01s.jpg|New Marton Top Lock\nFile:Y Waun AqueductWales.JPG|[[Chirk Aqueduct]]\nFile:Chirk tunnel.jpg|[[Chirk Tunnel]]\nFile:TrevorBasin-01s.jpg|[[Trevor Basin]]\n</gallery>\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Trevor Basin to Horseshoe Falls ===\n{{Ellesmere Canal Llangollen Branch map|Trevor Basin to Horseshoe Falls}}\nThis section was built as a navigable feeder and is both shallow and narrow.

The waterway links [[Llangollen]] in [[Denbighshire]], north Wales, with [[Hurleston]] in south [[Cheshire]], via the town of [[Ellesmere, Shropshire]]. The name, which was coined in the 1980s, is a modern designation for parts of the historic [[Ellesmere Canal]] and the Llangollen navigable feeder, both of which became part of the [[Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company|Shropshire Union Canals]] in 1846.\n\nThe Ellesmere Canal was proposed by industrialists at [[Ruabon]] and [[Brymbo]], and two disconnected sections were built. The northern section ran from Ellesmere Port on the [[River Mersey]] to [[Chester]], where it joined the [[Chester Canal]], and opened in 1795. Work on the southern section began at Frankton, with a line southwards to Llanymynech, and subsequently, a second section was built westwards towards Trevor. This involved crossing the [[River Ceiriog|Afon Ceiriog]] and the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]], which was achieved by building two vast aqueducts, using iron troughs to contain the water. The Ceiriog was crossed at [[Chirk]], and [[Chirk Aqueduct]] opened in 1801, to exploit local supplies of iron and coal. The canal then passed through [[Chirk Tunnel]], and reached the southern end of [[Pontcysyllte Aqueduct]] in 1802, which was not completed until 1805. To join the two halves up, a heavily engineered route from [[Trevor Basin]] via Ruabon and Brymbo to the River Dee at Chester was planned, but very little of it was built. Instead, the present route from Frankton to Hurleston Junction on the Chester Canal was constructed, and opened in 1805. As the route never reached the water reservoir at [[Moss Valley, Wrexham]] (built in 1786), a navigable feeder was built to Llantisilio where the [[Horseshoe Falls (Wales)|Horseshoe Falls]] weir was constructed on the River Dee to supply the canal.\n\nAs part of the Shropshire Union system, the canal from Hurleston to Llangollen thrived until the end of the First World War, after which it saw very little traffic. Navigation was formally abandoned under the terms of an Act of Abandonment obtained by the owners, the [[London Midland and Scottish Railway]], in 1944, but the channel was retained as it still supplied water to the main line of the Shropshire Union, and subsequently to the Mid & South East Cheshire Water Board. This arrangement was due to end in 1954, but as there was no alternative supply of water, the powers were extended. Early pioneering cruises of the waterway were made by [[L.T.C. Rolt|Tom Rolt]] in 1947 and 1949, and despite being officially closed, a number of boats started to use it. There was a growing campaign to reopen it, but it was still designated as one of the 'waterways having insufficient commercial prospects to justify their retention for navigation' under government papers published in 1955 and 1958. It was not until the passing of the Transport Act 1968 that the route was finally designated as a cruiseway, and its future was secured. As leisure use of the canals grew, the route was rebranded as \"The Llangollen Canal\" in the 1980s, and it has become one of the most popular routes for holidaymakers. Its importance in the history of the British canal system was recognised in 2009, when the {{convert|11|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch from Gledrid Bridge near Rhoswiel to Horseshoe Falls including Pontcysyllte and Chirk aqueducts was declared a [[World Heritage site]] by [[UNESCO]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Camlas ellesmere.png|thumb|left|Map showing the planned route for the [[Ellesmere Canal]] between Chester and [[Shrewsbury]]. The feeder to Llangollen was never envisaged in the original proposal.]]\nA grand plan for the Ellesmere Canal was first proposed in 1791 by a small group of industrialists who owned coal mines, iron mines and other works near Ruabon. They wanted to link their area to the [[River Mersey]] in the north and the [[River Severn]] to the south. The northward section would link up with the [[Chester Canal]] and hence the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]] before continuing to the Mersey at Netherpool (now [[Ellesmere Port]]). The southerly section of the waterway would pass through [[Overton-on-Dee|Overton]] before heading towards [[Shrewsbury]]. There would be branches to Bersham and Brymbo, where there were ironworks, to Llanymynech, where limestone was being quarried, and it would run past [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]] to Prees. A rival group proposed a branch from the Chester Canal to reach Ruabon, via Whitchurch, with additional lines to Llanymynech and Shrewsbury. There was support for the plans of the first group, and work began, but twelve years later, the plans of the second group had largely been implemented.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |pp=166-167}}\n\nJohn Duncombe, an engineer who was one of the original promoters, and Joseph Turner estimated that the main line to Netherpool and to Shrewsbury would cost \u00a367,456, while the whole scheme, including the branches, would cost \u00a3171,098.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |pp=167-169}} The promoters then decided they needed an engineer with a track record to advise them, and engaged the services of [[William Jessop]], to be assisted by Duncombe and William Turner. Jessop proposed a somewhat different route south of Chester. It was the time of [[Canal Mania]], and when subscriptions were opened, 1,234 subscribers offered a total of \u00a3967,700, of which \u00a3245,500 was actually accepted. In February 1793, the two groups decided to work together, and a host of deviations and alterations were made to the plans, for which an [[Act of Parliament]] was obtained on 30 April 1793. A capital of \u00a3400,000 was authorised, with powers to raise an additional \u00a3100,000 if required, and Jessop was appointed as engineer, to be assisted by Duncombe, Thomas Denson and William Turner. On 30 October, [[Thomas Telford]] was also engaged.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |pp=168-169}}\n\nWork began on the route southwards from Netherpool in November 1793, and packet boats started to run along it from 1 July 1795, although it was not quite finished. Three locks to connect it to the Mersey were completed in early 1796, and coal was first carried to Chester in February. The connection to the Chester Canal took a little longer, and was completed in January 1797.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=169}} The company were keen to develop the trade in limestone from Llanymynech, and cutting of the canal southwards from Frankton began in early 1794. At the time, plans for the Montgomeryshire Canal were before Parliament, which would continue southwards from Carreghofa, just beyond Llanymynech. With four locks at Frankton, and another three at Aston, the line to Carreghofa was opened in autumn 1796, and a good trade in limestone northwards, and goods southwards to the Montgomeryshire Canal, developed.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=169}}\n\nProgress north-westwards from Frankton towards [[Trevor Basin|Trevor]] was hampered by the need to cross two rivers, the Afon Ceiriog at Chirk and the Dee at Pontcysyllte. Both would require tall aqueducts, but to save construction costs at Pontcysylle, plans were drawn up for three locks at each end, to reduce the height of the main arches by {{convert|50|ft|m}}. However, on 14 July 1795 Jessop proposed that the aqueduct should be built {{convert|125|ft|m}} above the Dee, and that the costs should be saved by using an iron trough. He also proposed a similar trough at Chirk, instead of an embankment at Pont-faen, writing that \"instead of an obstruction it would be a romantic feature in the view\", and this was a major factor in persuading the landowner to allow it to be built at Chirk, rather than at Pont-faen. The foundation stone for Pontcysyllte was laid on 25 July 1795, although the committee did not formally approve the new plans until 10 August.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |pp=170-171}}\n\nAgain, the company was keen to get trade moving on the canal, and pressed on with the line from Chirk to Frankton. The Vron Ironworks were at Chirk, with coal mines nearby, and goods from Ruabon could also be brought there by road, until the canal was completed. Work started on the Chirk aqueduct in January 1796, and when finished, it was {{convert|600|ft|m}} long with ten arches, each with a span of {{convert|40|ft|m}}, carrying the canal {{convert|70|ft|m}} above the Afon Ceiriog. It was constructed with a cast-iron bottom to the trough, but the sides were of masonry, an unusual choice given the decision to use a cast-iron trough at Pontcysyllte. The {{convert|8|mi|km|adj=on}} section from Chirk to Frankton included six locks and was completed in 1801. The section onwards through [[Chirk Tunnel|Chirk]] and Whitehouses tunnels, to reach the southern end of Pontcysyllte, opened in June 1802.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=173}}\n\nIn July 1795, the company hired contractors to start work on the branch from Hordley, near Frankton locks, to Westoncommon, which was completed in 1797. A wharf, public house, stables and other features were constructed near Westoncommon, and four lime kilns were built, to burn lime from Llanymynech using coal from Chirk. Plans for this branch to continue onwards to Shrewsbury were dropped, because lime from Weston would have to compete with that brought along the Shrewsbury Canal, and coal to supply the domestic market at Shrewsbury would not be available until Pontcysyllte aqueduct was completed. It did not appear that the route would be profitable, and this remained true when the plans were reconsidered subsequently.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |pp=173-174}}\n\n===Joining the two halves===\n{{Llangollen Canal map}}\nPlans for joining the southern sections to the northern one were revisited by Telford in 1795, and after approval by Jessop, were authorised by Act of Parliament in 1796. They involved a heavily engineered line from Trevor to Chester, via [[Ruabon]] to the Dee at Chester, with a branch to [[Coed Talon]], which would serve the [[Brymbo]] ironworks near Ffrwd. Locks would lift the line by {{convert|76|ft|m}} from Trevor basin to Plas Kynaston, after which it would run on the level to Poolmouth and the junction with the Coed Talon Branch. It would then descend through a long flight of locks, roughly following the line of the later Chester to Wrexham railway, to enter the Dee opposite the branch to the Chester Canal. A second branch would run from Pulford to Farndon and Holt. Just over {{convert|2|mi|km}} of the Coed Talon branch was built, to a basin near Ffrwd, and although it was filled with water, it seems that it was never used, and was filled in again from 1809.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=174}}\n\nIn early 1794, a shareholder and a local landowner took out a patent for a canal lift, and offered to build a trial one. If it proved successful, then the Ellesmere company would pay for it, and if not, the inventors would meet the costs. A site was chosen on the proposed line, and by May 1796, it was ready for trials to begin. John Rennie and Jessop examined it, but like several similar ideas of the time, it was not felt to be robust enough to withstand the rigours of daily use. The company eventually paid \u00a3200 to the inventors, one quarter of the actual costs.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=174}} Jessop decided in 1800 that the route between Trevor and Chester should be abandoned, due to the changes in circumstances, and coal being available in Chester from a number of other locations.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=176}}\n\nThe Chester Canal, which had not been a financial success, had hoped that links with the Ellesmere Canal would improve their prospects, but when the Ellesmere Act of 1796 had failed to mention any connection with the Chester Canal, they had taken action, and had cut off the water supply to the northern section from Chester to Ellesmere Port. When agreement was reached on a new line from [[Frankton Junction]] to [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]], the water supply was reinstated, and work on the new line started in February 1797. The work was difficult, as it had to cross Whixall Moss, and a {{convert|261|ft|m|adj=on}} tunnel was required near [[Ellesmere, Shropshire|Ellesmere]]. It also included a branch to Prees Higher Heath, but only {{convert|3.75|mi|km|0}} of this was built, terminating at Quina Brook, where the company built some limekilns. By 1804, the main line had reached Tilstock Park, some {{convert|4|mi|km}} short of Whitchurch.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |pp=177-178}}\n\nFurther agreement had been reached in 1802 on a route from Tilstock Park to [[Hurleston Junction]], on which work started immediately. It was completed on 25 March 1805. In order to keep the system supplied with water, an Act of Parliament obtained in 1804 had authorised the construction of a navigable feeder from the north end of Pontcysyllte aqueduct to LLangollen on onwards to Llantisilo, where the [[Horseshoe Falls (Wales)|Horseshoe Falls]] weir would be constructed on the River Dee. Once this opened in 1808, the system was not short of water. The Ellesmere company attempted to buy out the Chester Canal in 1804, but the offer had been refused. In 1813, they agreed to an amalgamation, on terms much worse than those offered in 1804, and the two companies became one from 1 July 1813.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |pp=178-179}}\n\nThe network expanded with the opening of the Middlewich Branch on 1 September 1833,{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=181}} and the completion on the [[Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal]] from Nantwich Basin to Autherley on 2 March 1835.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=186}} In May 1845, the Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company obtained an Act of Parliament to enable them to absorb the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, the Montgomeryshire Canal, the [[Shrewsbury Canal]] and the [[Shropshire Canal]]. The name was changed to the [[Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company]] in 1846, with powers to build a number of railways or convert their canals into railways,{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |pp=232-233}} but this vision was short-lived, and they agreed to a lease with the [[London and North Western Railway]] in late 1846. An Act of Parliament was obtained to authorise this in 1847, but was not formally enacted until 1857.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |pp=233-234}} This ended their aspirations to build railways, but they remained remarkably independent despite railway control.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=235}} The Shropshire Union was absorbed by the London and North Western Railway in late 1922, which itself became part of the [[London Midland and Scottish Railway]] soon afterwards.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |pp=249-250}}\n\n===Decline===\nAfter the takeover by the London Midland and Scottish Railway, regular maintenance was often not carried out, and gradually the canals silted up, so that boats could not operate with full loads. Traffic declined, and was significantly affected by a breach that occurred at the Perry Aqueduct, about {{convert|1|mi|km}} to the south of Frankton locks, which effectively closed the Montgomeryshire Canal to all traffic.{{sfn |Nicholson |2006 |p=65}} Traffic beyond Frankton to Llangollen had ceased in 1937, and the Frankton to Hurleston section was not used after 1939. The London Midland and Scottish Railway obtained an Act of Abandonment in 1944, allowing it to close {{convert|175|mi|km}} of canals, including much of the Shropshire Union system. However, the line from Hurleston to Llangollen and onwards to Llantisilio was saved, as it was the main supply of water to the rest of the system.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=251}}\n\nOn 6 September 1945, due to inadequate maintenance, the canal breached its banks east of [[Llangollen]] near [[Sun Bank Halt]]. The flow of hundreds of tons of water washed away the embankment of the railway further down the hill, creating a crater which was {{convert|40|yd|m}} long and {{convert|50|ft|m}} deep.{{sfn |McKnight |1987 |p=28}} This caused the first traffic of the morning, a mail and goods train composed of 16 carriages and two vans, to crash into the breach, killing one and injuring two engine crew.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.llangollen-railway.co.uk/hist/accid.html |work=The Llangollen Railway's History |title=1945: The Sun Bank Halt Accident |publisher=Llangollen Railway |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101023203/http://www.llangollen-railway.co.uk/hist/accid.html |archivedate=1 January 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northeast/sites/denbighshire/pages/int-eist1.shtml |title=BBC News \u2013 North East Wales |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> Despite the canal being officially closed, the breach was repaired, so that water could continue to reach the main line at Hurleston. The use of the canal as a water supply channel was further bolstered by an agreement with what became the Mid & South East Cheshire Water Board,{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=251}} who used it to supply water to their Hurleston reservoir, and agreed to maintain it.\n\n== Restoration ==\nAlthough there had been little traffic since the end of the First World War, the channel had remained watered, because it supplied the main line of the Shropshire Union Canal. In the period after the Second World War, there was growing interest in using the canals for leisure cruising, and the pioneer [[L. T. C. Rolt|Tom Rolt]] attempted to cruise the canal in 1947.{{sfn |Davies |2005 |p=84}} Rolt's boat was ''Cressy'', which had been converted at Frankton to steam power, and on which Rolt had sailed westwards from Frankton Junction with Kyrle Willans after its conversion in 1930. At that time they had failed to reach Pontcysyllte.{{sfn |Bolton |1990 |p=36}} On this occasion, he was joined by a small cruiser named ''Heron'', crewed by the Grundy family from Liverpool. The state of the canal was poor, and several of the locks were disintegrating, but despite low water levels and thick weed growth, both boats eventually reached Ellesmere. They then found that the water supply had been cut off due to a broken culvert near Chirk. After several weeks of being stranded, Rolt talked to the Chester office, and they arranged for water to be let down the canal, to enable the boats to return to Hurleston.{{sfn |Bolton |1990 |pp=37-38}} On a second attempt two years later, Rolt and his wife reached Pontcysyllte,{{sfn |Davies |2005 |p=84}} which they crossed accompanied by the actor [[Hugh Griffith]] and his wife Gunde. The Rolts moored for nearly three months just beyond the aqueduct, near the site where their boat had been built during the First World War.{{sfn |Bolton |1990 |pp=36,56}} In August they were joined by Roger Calvert and his family, who were attempting to reach the top of the canal in a home-made boat, which was pulled by a donkey. The Rolts travelled with them for part of the journey.{{sfn |Bolton |1990 |p=58}} Edward Wilson, another canal enthusiast, reached Trevor in his boat in 1952, and the [[Inland Waterways Association]] held a rally at Llangollen later that year.{{sfn |Davies |2005 |p=84}}\n\nBy 1954, the Llangollen Canal was in a curious position. Under the terms of the LMSR Act of abandonment, obtained in 1944, navigation had been abandoned, but the right to sell water had been retained. This was to be for a period of ten years, during which those who bought the water were required to make alternative arrangements, which they failed to do. Since the nationalisation of the canals in 1948, the canal had been managed by the [[British Transport Commission]], who had to obtain Parliamentary approval to extend this arrangement. Meanwhile, a number of pleasure boats had ventured onto the canal, and there was a growing campaign to reopen the canal for navigation. A committee to spearhead this had been formed, and was chaired by the clerk for Wrexham Rural District Council, Trevor Williams. More than thirty other organisations were supporting the move, including the British Travel and Holidays Association.{{sfn |Bolton |1990 |pp=110-111}}\n\nIn 1955, the Board of Survey, a committee chaired by Lord Rusholme, had produced a report on the future of the canals under the control of the British Transport Commission, which they had divided into three categories. There were {{convert|336|mi|km}} of 'waterways to be developed', another {{convert|994|mi|km}} of 'waterways to be retained', and finally {{convert|771|mi|km}} of 'waterways having insufficient commercial prospects to justify their retention for navigation'. The Llangollen Canal was placed in the latter category, since it was still officially disused.{{sfn |Bolton |1990 |pp=116-117}} This was followed in 1958 by the Bowes Report, which suggested that the first two categories should be classified as Class A and Class B waterways, with Class B waterways put back into good working order and retained for 25 years, to attract private investment. The Llangollen Canal was still in the final category, but the report at least suggested that there should be a right of appeal against closure, and gave the first hints that such canals could be retained because of their social value for recreation.{{sfn |Bolton |1990 |p=163}}\n\nHugh McKnight, the editor of the Inland Waterways Association's ''Bulletin'', wrote an optimistic report in 1966, pointing to the achievements of the first 20 years of the organisation's existence, mentioning the changes in public opinion concerning the canals, and pointing particularly to the growth in leisure use on the Llangollen Canal and the Oxford Canal.{{sfn |Bolton |1990 |p=229}} Official attitudes changed, and the provisions of the Transport Act 1968 placed the canals under the control of the [[British Waterways Board]], who were tasked with maintaining, developing and running them for the benefit of users.{{sfn |Bolton |1990 |p=233}} The whole of the branch from Hurleston Junction to Llantisilio, just below Horseshoe Falls, was listed in the Act as a cruising waterway, meaning that its future was no longer in jeopardy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/73/schedule/12 |title=Transport Act 1968 |publisher=The National Archives |at=Schedule 12 Part II Cruising Waterways |year=1968 |accessdate=13 March 2018}}</ref> As use by leisure craft grew, the \"Llangollen Branch of the Shropshire Union\" became popular due to its aqueducts and scenery. The canal was later renamed the Llangollen Canal, becoming one of the most popular canals for holidaymakers in Britain.{{sfn |Mosse |2010 |p=248}} The name is now used for the entire route from Hurleston to Llangollen, even though it was never described in this way during its commercial life.{{sfn |Nicholson |2006 |p=17}} It is not entirely clear when the name was first applied, since it was listed as the \"Welsh Canal\", a branch of the Shropshire Union, in 1985. At that time, potential boaters were advised that the canal was a water supply channel, and that they should submit an application containing full details and dimensions of their boat if they wanted to cruise on it. Nevertheless, they were instructed that British Waterways were keen to see leisure use of the canal, and that it could be quite congested in the summer season.{{sfn |Edwards |1985 |p=304}} Its origins as parts of two separate canals can be seen from the fact that the bridges are numbered from 1 at Hurleston to 70 at Rowsons Bridge, just past Frankton Junction. Continuing along the route to Llangollen, bridge numbering restarts at 1, while bridges 71 and upwards continue along what is now the Montgomery Canal, but was formerly the Ellesmere Branch to Llanymynech, where it joined the Montgomeryshire Canal.{{sfn |Nicholson |2006 |pp=29,67}}\n\nA notable feature of the canal is the [[Pontcysyllte Aqueduct]], built by [[Thomas Telford]]. Opened in 1805, the aqueduct is more than {{convert|300|m}} long and {{convert|38|m}} above the valley floor. It has 19 stone arches, each with a 45-foot (14 metre) span. Another aqueduct carries the canal over the [[Ceiriog Valley|River Ceiriog]] at [[Chirk]], and there are tunnels nearby at Whitehouses, Chirk, and Ellesmere.\n\nThe canal also forms the boundary on two sides of the [[Fenn's, Whixall and Bettisfield Mosses NNR|Fenn's, Whixall and Bettisfield Mosses National Nature Reserve]]. In 2009 an eleven-mile section of the canal from Gledrid Bridge near Rhoswiel through to the [[Horseshoe Falls (Wales)|Horseshoe Falls]], which includes [[Chirk Aqueduct]] and [[Pontcysyllte Aqueduct]], was declared a [[World Heritage site]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/architecture_and_design/article6594604.ece |title=Unesco names Pontcysyllte aqueduct as UK's latest World Heritage site |date=28 June 2009 |accessdate=12 January 2010 |newspaper=The Times |location=London}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Llangollen canal wharf.jpg|Llangollen canal wharf.\nFile:pontcysyllte aqueduct arp.jpg|A [[narrowboat]] traverses the [[Pontcysyllte Aqueduct]].\n</gallery>\n\n== Route ==\n=== Hurleston to Frankton Junction ===\n{{Ellesmere Canal Hurleston Branch map|Hurleston to Frankton Junction}}\n\nThe canal at Hurleston Junction rises from the Shropshire Union Canal main line, through four adjacent locks, with a total rise of {{convert|34|ft|3|in|m}}.{{sfn |Nicholson |2006 |p=18}} The canal had been an early pioneer in the use of iron lock gates, instead of the more traditional wooden ones, and this material was first used on the locks at Frankton in 1819.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=179}} The four locks here have a mixture of wooden and metal gates. All were built by the engineer J Fletcher around 1805. Lock 1 has metal lower gates, and a wooden upper gate, while gates at both ends of lock 2 are made of metal.

The railway and the nearby [[Grindley Brook Halt railway station]] closed in 1957,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shropshirehistory.com/railways/stations.htm|title=Stations|work=Shropshire History|accessdate=10 March 2018}}</ref> and goods traffic ceased in 1963, but the massive embankments and bridge remain. Immediately afterwards, the canal passes through three locks and a three-chamber staircase lock, attended during summer months by a [[lock keeper]]. The six locks raise the level of the canal by {{convert|38|ft|11|in|m}}. After another mile (1.6&nbsp;km), there is a lift bridge just before the entrance to the Whitchurch Arm, which served the town of [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]]. Part of it remains open, and is used for moorings.{{sfn |Nicholson |2006 |pp=22-23}} The section from the main line to Sherryman's Bridge was opened on 6 July 1808, and in 1811 a further extension into the town reached Castle Well.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=178}} The arm remained closed when the canal reopened in the 1950s, but Whitchurch Town Council looked at ways of bringing boats back into the town in the early 1980s{{sfn |Squires |2008 |p=113}} and the embryonic [[Whitchurch Waterway Trust]] was formed in 1986, with the aim of reopening the arm, of which around {{convert|0.75|mi|km}} was left, the rest having been built over in the 1950s.{{sfn |Squires |2008 |p=113}} This was achieved in October 1993, and the trust are hopeful that a new route into the town can be constructed.{{sfn |Squires |2008 |pp=118, 134}}\n\nBetween bridges 42 and 47, the canal skirts the eastern edge and then passes through and the southern edge of Whixall Moss, part of the [[Fenn's, Whixall and Bettisfield Mosses National Nature Reserve]]. With a combined area of nearly {{convert|2500|acre|km2}}, they form the third largest area of raised peat bog in the United Kingdom. The reserve is also a designated [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]], a European [[Special Area of Conservation]] and a Wetland of International Importance under the [[Ramsar site|Ramsar Convention]]. The bogs were drained using powers enshrined in Enclosure Acts dating from 1777 and 1823, and further drainage took place when the canal was built in 1804, and again in 1863 when a railway was built along the north-western margins. Commercial peat cutting using mechanised cutters began in 1968, but extraction ceased in 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iucn-uk-peatlandprogramme.org/sites/www.iucn-uk-peatlandprogramme.org/files/NNR_Fenns_Whixall_leaflet.pdf |title=Fenn's, Whixall and Bettisfield Mosses National Nature Reserve |publisher=Natural England |pp=4\u20135 |accessdate=13 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313214315/http://www.iucn-uk-peatlandprogramme.org/sites/www.iucn-uk-peatlandprogramme.org/files/NNR_Fenns_Whixall_leaflet.pdf |archive-date=13 March 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe technical difficulties of cutting a canal through Whixall Moss were many, but Jessop and Telford decided on a direct route across the moss, rather than building a bypass that skirted round the edge of the area.

The current boats maintain a long tradition, which was first offered to visitors in 1884.{{sfn |Nicholson |2006 |p=33}} The towpath beside the feeder is in good condition, and walkers can reach the weir at Horseshoe Falls.{{sfn |Nicholson |2006 |pp=33-34}} [[British Waterways]] maintains a gravel [[shoal]] immediately upstream of the marina entrance past Llangollen Wharf. This maintains a draught which most [[narrowboat]]s cannot pass, but which is passable by the shallow draughted trip boats.\n\nIn 2005, a marina was constructed by British Waterways, just upstream from Llangollen Wharf, to relieve the acute shortage of casual moorings, and provides 33 berths. About {{convert|100|yd|m}} downstream of the wharf there are about a dozen visitor moorings complete with individual electricity and water pedestals at each. Similar pedestals have also been installed at the marina berths. Mooring in Llangollen is restricted to 48 hours, and a charge is made both at the marina and the visitor moorings, which are below bridge 45.{{sfn |Nicholson |2006 |p=34}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|Transport|Cheshire}}\n*[[Canals of the United Kingdom]]\n*[[History of the British canal system]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n  |last=Bolton |first=David\n  |title=Race Against Time\n  |date=1990\n  |publisher=Methuen\n  |isbn=978-0-413-63470-2\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |last=Davies |first=Robert\n  |title=Llangollen and Pontcysyllte\n  |date=August 2005\n  |publisher=Waterways World\n  |issn=0309-1422\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |last=Denton |first=John Horsley\n  |title=Montgomershire Canal and the Llanymynech Branch of the Ellesmere Canal\n  |year=1984\n  |publisher=Lapal Publications\n  |isbn=978-0-9509238-1-9\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book \n  |first=L A |last=Edwards\n  |title=Inland Waterways of Great Britain (6th Ed)\n  |publisher=Imray Laurie Norie and Wilson\n  |year=1985\n  |isbn=978-0-85288-081-4\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |last=Goss |first=Keith\n  |title=WW Guide to the Llangollen Canal\n  |date=July 2009\n  |publisher=Waterways World\n  |issn=0309-1422\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book \n  |first=Charles |last=Hadfield \n  |title=The Canals of the West Midlands \n  |publisher=David and Charles \n  |year=1985 \n  |isbn=978-0-7153-8644-6\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book\n  |first=Hugh |last=McKnight\n  |title=The Shell Book of Inland Waterways\n  |publisher=[[David & Charles]]\n  |year=1987\n  |isbn=978-0-7153-8239-4\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |last=Minifie |first=Michael\n  |title=Renumbered Bridges\n  |date=December 2008\n  |publisher=Waterways World\n  |issn=0309-1422\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |last=Minifie |first=Michael\n  |title=Llangollen Canal\n  |date=January 2010\n  |publisher=Waterways World\n  |issn=0309-1422\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book\n  |first=Jonathan |last=Mosse\n  |title=Waterways of Britain\n  |publisher=Times Books\n  |year=2010\n  |isbn=978-0-00-787363-0\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book\n  |last=Nicholson\n  |authorlink=Nicholson Guides\n  |title=Nicholson Guides Vol 4: Four Counties and the Welsh Canals\n  |publisher=Harper Collins\n  |year=2006\n  |isbn=978-0-00-721112-8\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |last=Waterways World\n  |title=Canal Guide 2 \u2013 Llangollen and Montgomery Canals\n  |year=2005\n  |publisher=Waterways World\n  |isbn=978-1-870002-89-9\n  |ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110610093308/http://www.northwalesborderlands.co.uk/explore-north-wales-borderlands/heritage.aspx Llangollen Canal] \u2013 North Wales Borderlands website\n\n{{Canals of Britain}}\n\n{{Coord|52.9722|N|3.1711|W|display=title|region:GB_type:river}}\n\n[[Category:Llangollen Canal| ]]\n[[Category:Canals in Cheshire]]\n[[Category:Canals in Shropshire]]\n[[Category:Canals in Wales]]\n[[Category:Shropshire Union Canal]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Cheshire]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Denbighshire]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Shropshire]]\n[[Category:Transport in Denbighshire]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHurleston to Frankton Junction:Typo fixing, replaced: passes though  \u2192  passes through", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llangollen_Canal"}

Following an order from occupying authorities to remove Polish inscriptions from the tombstones, [[Hitler Youth]] militias destroyed Polish tombstones, beating inscriptions and damaging the fence. In particular, on a Sunday of April 1942, [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] troops stormed the cemetery, smearing Polish gravestones with cement and destroying metal elements of the graves<ref name=\"GP\"/>.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1964, burials were carried out anew in family graves and in neglected places from the 19th century, which were no more tended. Finally, the last burial took place on July 11, 1964. The cemetery was then declared closed on July 15, 1964, by Bydgoszcz authorities and renamed ''Municipal cemetery''.\nIn the late 1970s, urbanization plans regarding the area where [[Marshal Ferdinand Foch Street in Bydgoszcz|Focha]], Kruszwicka, [[Nakielska street in Bydgoszcz|Nakielska]] and Grunwaldzka streets meet imposed to bulldoze a northern strip of the cemetery. Work started in 1978: it included reconstructing the fence, razing chapels and exhumating some graves. The operation was badly carried out and several errors led to the destruction of a 17th century chapel, the lost of many [[Crypt#Burial_vaults|family crypts]] -some of them being work of art edifices- and the demolition of the caretaker's house. The [[wrought iron]] grating elements of the main entry gate were returned to the [[Poor Clares' Church, Bydgoszcz|church of the Poor Clares]] where it originated from.\n\nThose misbehaviours triggered the establishment of a ''Social Committee for the Rescue of Starofarny Cemetery Monuments'', headed by architect Stefan Klajbor, which succeeded in listing the cemetery on the '''[[Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship]] Heritage List''' (No.601242 A/879, June 28, 1983).<ref name=\"class\">zabytek-kujawsko-pomorskie-data dost\u0119pu=28.02.2014</ref> In 1985, [[List of Catholic dioceses in Poland|Metropolitan Curia]] in [[Gniezno]] handed over the management of ''Starofarny Cmentarz'' to Bydgoszcz administrative authorities.<ref name=\"MAJ\"/>\nIn 1991, a restoration plan of the facility was launched, comprising, among others:\n* a reconstruction of the fence;\n* tending the corner of [[Franco-Prussian War|1870 French soldier]] tombs; \n* rebuilding the 17th century chapel. \nSince 1998, the work has been supported by private funds collected locally during [[All Saints' Day]]. \nIn 2018, further contributions also made possible additional renovations such as fencing and family chapels.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bydgoszcz.wyborcza.pl/bydgoszcz/5,48722,24118736.html |title=Sikorski i Bruski z puszkami.

Following an order from occupying authorities to remove Polish inscriptions from the tombstones, [[Hitler Youth]] militias destroyed Polish tombstones, beating inscriptions and damaging the fence. In particular, on a Sunday of April 1942, [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] troops stormed the cemetery, smearing Polish gravestones with cement and destroying metal elements of the graves<ref name=\"GP\"/>.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1964, burials were carried out anew in family graves and in neglected places from the 19th century, which were no more tended. Finally, the last burial took place on July 11, 1964. The cemetery was then declared closed on July 15, 1964, by Bydgoszcz authorities and renamed ''Municipal cemetery''.\nIn the late 1970s, urbanization plans regarding the area where [[Marshal Ferdinand Foch Street in Bydgoszcz|Focha]], Kruszwicka, [[Nakielska street in Bydgoszcz|Nakielska]] and Grunwaldzka streets meet imposed to bulldoze a northern strip of the cemetery. Work started in 1978: it included reconstructing the fence, razing chapels and exhumating some graves. The operation was badly carried out and several errors led to the destruction of a 17th century chapel, the lost of many [[Crypt#Burial_vaults|family crypts]] -some of them being work of art edifices- and the demolition of the caretaker's house. The [[wrought iron]] grating elements of the main entry gate were returned to the [[Poor Clares' Church, Bydgoszcz|church of the Poor Clares]] where it originated from.\n\nThose misbehaviours triggered the establishment of a ''Social Committee for the Rescue of Starofarny Cemetery Monuments'', headed by architect Stefan Klajbor, which succeeded in listing the cemetery on the '''[[Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship]] Heritage List''' (No.601242 A/879, June 28, 1983).<ref name=\"class\">zabytek-kujawsko-pomorskie-data dost\u0119pu=28.02.2014</ref> In 1985, [[List of Catholic dioceses in Poland|Metropolitan Curia]] in [[Gniezno]] handed over the management of ''Starofarny Cmentarz'' to Bydgoszcz administrative authorities.<ref name=\"MAJ\"/>\nIn 1991, a restoration plan of the facility was launched, comprising, among others:\n* a reconstruction of the fence;\n* tending the corner of [[Franco-Prussian War|1870 French soldier]] tombs; \n* rebuilding the 17th century chapel. \nSince 1998, the work has been supported by private funds collected locally during [[All Saints' Day]]. \nIn 2018, further contributions also made possible additional renovations such as fencing and family chapels.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bydgoszcz.wyborcza.pl/bydgoszcz/5,48722,24118736.html |title=Sikorski i Bruski z puszkami.

The construction of the church, funded partly by [[Antoni Laubitz]], the bishop of [[Gniezno]], began in 1936: the design was realized a year earlier by [[Pozna\u0144]] architect Stefan Cybichowski.<ref name=\"padova\"/> The edifice was not completed at the start of [[WWII]] and had been used by Nazi forces as a warehouse for construction tools, while religious services were held back in the initial chapel.\nAfter the war, the church was left devastated and shelled, but after a hasty renovation, it had been consecrated anew by bishop [[August Hlond]] on December 1, 1945.<ref name=\"padova\"/>\n\nThe massive brick church has three [[nave]]s, with a semi-circular northern [[chancel]]. The highlight of the building is the high square [[steeple]], visible from Grunwaldzka street crossing.

However, Twardowski, willing to ouwit the devil, includes a special clause in the contract, stating that Satan will own Twardowski's soul only if he visits Rome \u2013 a place the sorcerer never intends to go to. The devil's trick relied on luring the sorcerer into a newly built tavern called ''Rome Inn''.\n\nLegend has it that Pan Twardowski spent some time in [[Bydgoszcz]], where, as a celebration as well as a touristic attraction, a figure was recently mounted in a window of a tenement, overseeing the [[Old Market square, Bydgoszcz|Old Market square]]. Every day at 13:13 and 21:13, third storey window at No.15 opens and Pan Twardowski appears, accompanied by music and a devilish laughter.
