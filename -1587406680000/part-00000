It resulted in the Blue Jays finishing third in the [[American League]] East with a record of 80 wins and 82 losses. This was the first 162-game season since 1993 that Blue Jays hitters would combine for less than 1,000 strikeouts.\n\n==Offseason==\n*January 6, 2005: [[Ken Huckaby]] was signed as a Free Agent with the Toronto Blue Jays.<ref name=autogenerated1>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/h/huckake01.shtml Ken Huckaby Statistics - Baseball-Reference.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*January 10, 2005: Billy Koch was signed as a Free Agent with the Toronto Blue Jays.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/k/kochbi01.shtml</ref>\n\n==Regular season==\n\n===Summary===\nOn February 2, 2005, several days after finalizing the purchase of SkyDome by [[Rogers Communications]], Rogers renamed the stadium to the [[Rogers Centre]]. In spite of the best efforts of the new ownership, a wide majority of Blue Jays fans continued (and still continue) to refer to the stadium as SkyDome. By the start of the season, Rogers had upgraded the stadium with a new \"[[Jumbotron|JumboTron]]\" videoboard and added other [[State of the art|state-of-the-art]] video screens around the stadium. Furthermore, the [[AstroTurf]] surface was replaced by the more natural-looking [[FieldTurf]]. Owner [[Edward Samuel Rogers|Ted Rogers]] also promised a payroll increase to $210 million over the next three years, which allowed the team to have a team payroll of $70 million per year.\n\nThe Blue Jays finished [[spring training]] with a 16&ndash;10 record. Among the stars of spring training was Gabe Gross, who tied the Jays' record for most home runs in spring training with eight (the previous record breaker was long time Blue Jay [[Carlos Delgado]]). The Jays were able to translate their success in spring training into an excellent start\u2014the team led the AL East from early to mid-April and held their record around .500 until late August. The Jays were hit with the injury bug when third baseman Corey Koskie broke his finger, taking him out of the lineup, but the club was pleasantly surprised with the performance of rookie call-up [[Aaron Hill (baseball)|Aaron Hill]] in his stead.\n\nOn July 8, just prior to the All-Star break, Blue Jays ace [[Roy Halladay]] was struck on the shin by a line drive from Texas left fielder [[Kevin Mench]] and was placed on the DL with a fractured leg. The injury cost Halladay his chance to be the American League starter in the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] in [[Detroit]]; his place on the All-Star squad was taken by Red Sox pitcher [[Matt Clement]]. Though Halladay's injury was hoped to be minor, the recovery process was met with constant delays, and Halladay eventually would prove to be out for the rest of the season. Team management officially announced that he would miss the rest of the season in August. The Halladay injury is seen by many as the negative turning point in the Jays season; the team had been in serious [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] contention at the time, but afterwards fell out of the race and failed to make the playoffs for the 12th consecutive year.\n\nOn July 22, Toronto traded utility infielder [[John McDonald (infielder)|John McDonald]] to the [[Detroit Tigers]] for cash considerations. This gave the Blue Jays an open spot on the roster so that [[Aaron Hill (baseball)|Aaron Hill]] could stay with the team when [[Corey Koskie]] returned from injury.\n\nOn July 28, Toronto played in the longest game in franchise history, innings-wise, an 18-inning marathon against the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] at Rogers Centre. The Jays won 2\u20131, after nearly five hours of play when [[Orlando Hudson]] hit a line drive past a drawn in infield, scoring [[Alex R\u00edos]] from third base.\n\nThe shutdown of Halladay for the remainder of the season seemed to affect the performance of the Jays. They went on a slump that brought their record under .500 in the beginning of September. From there, the Blue Jays finished the season 80\u201382 while receiving glimpses of the future from September call-ups [[Guillermo Quir\u00f3z]], [[John-Ford Griffin]], and [[Shaun Marcum]]. Marcum made himself noteworthy by posting an ERA of 0.00 over 5 relief appearances and 8 innings in September. Griffin hit his first career home run in the last game of the season and ended up going 4 for 13.\n\n[[Josh Towers]] also stepped up, showing largely unseen potential going 7\u20135 with a 2.91 ERA in the 2nd half of the year and a 13\u201312, 3.71 ERA season overall, making him arguably the unlikely ace of the Jays rotation with Halladay injured and [[Gustavo Chac\u00edn]] faltering somewhat after the All-Star break.\n\nThe 2005 Jays inability to score with men in scoring position was a turning point in many games that ended up as losses, also contributing to the 80&ndash;82 record, although as a positive, the team did improve by 13 wins and returned to their usual 80-win plateau.\n\nOn October 9, the Jays, along with their fans, mourned the loss of inaugural broadcaster [[Tom Cheek]]. Cheek, 66, succumbed to [[Brain tumor|brain cancer]] after just over a year-long battle. Cheek had broadcast 4,306 consecutive games since the first day of the franchise. His streak was ended in June 2004 when he took time off to visit his ailing father.\n\nIn the off-season, general manager J. P. Ricciardi began to make good use of the money that had been granted to the Jays by Rogers Communications before the season. Rogers had given Ricciardi $210 million over three years, which became $75 million a season to spend, $25 million more than the previous year. Ricciardi fulfilled the team's need for a stable [[closer (baseball)|closer]] by signing former [[Baltimore Orioles]] standout [[B. J. Ryan]] to the richest contract ever for a reliever \u2013 a 5-year, $47 million on November 28. Following that, the club awarded a 5-year, $55 million contract to highly coveted starting pitcher [[A. J. Burnett]], formerly of the [[Florida Marlins]], on December 6.\n\nOn December 23, 2005, [[Sportsnet|Rogers Sportsnet]] reported that the Jays added a much needed 30 plus home run hitter to their lineup by getting third baseman and 2002 World Series MVP [[Troy Glaus]] and minor league shortstop Sergio Santos in a trade with the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. In return, the Diamondbacks received second baseman and 2005 [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove Award]] winner [[Orlando Hudson]] and pitcher [[Miguel Batista]]. Glaus passed a team physical on December 26, and the trade was officially announced the next day. On the same day as the announcement of the Glaus deal, the Jays acquired solid-hitting first baseman [[Lyle Overbay]] and right-handed pitching prospect [[Ty Taubenheim]] in a trade with the Milwaukee Brewers; with pitcher [[Dave Bush]], pitching prospect [[Zach Jackson (pitcher, born 1983)|Zach Jackson]], and outfielder [[Gabe Gross]] going to Milwaukee. Glaus and Overbay were both introduced to the Toronto media together a few days later.\n\n===Season standings===\n{{2005 AL East Standings}}\n\n=== Record vs. opponents ===\n{{2005 AL Record vs.

It resulted in the Blue Jays finishing third in the [[American League]] East with a record of 80 wins and 82 losses. This was the first 162-game season since 1993 that Blue Jays hitters would combine for less than 1,000 strikeouts.\n\n==Offseason==\n*January 6, 2005: [[Ken Huckaby]] was signed as a Free Agent with the Toronto Blue Jays.<ref name=autogenerated1>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/h/huckake01.shtml Ken Huckaby Statistics - Baseball-Reference.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*January 10, 2005: Billy Koch was signed as a Free Agent with the Toronto Blue Jays.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/k/kochbi01.shtml</ref>\n\n==Regular season==\n\n===Summary===\nOn February 2, 2005, several days after finalizing the purchase of SkyDome by [[Rogers Communications]], Rogers renamed the stadium to the [[Rogers Centre]]. In spite of the best efforts of the new ownership, a wide majority of Blue Jays fans continued (and still continue) to refer to the stadium as SkyDome. By the start of the season, Rogers had upgraded the stadium with a new \"[[Jumbotron|JumboTron]]\" videoboard and added other [[State of the art|state-of-the-art]] video screens around the stadium. Furthermore, the [[AstroTurf]] surface was replaced by the more natural-looking [[FieldTurf]]. Owner [[Edward Samuel Rogers|Ted Rogers]] also promised a payroll increase to $210 million over the next three years, which allowed the team to have a team payroll of $70 million per year.\n\nThe Blue Jays finished [[spring training]] with a 16&ndash;10 record. Among the stars of spring training was Gabe Gross, who tied the Jays' record for most home runs in spring training with eight (the previous record breaker was long time Blue Jay [[Carlos Delgado]]). The Jays were able to translate their success in spring training into an excellent start\u2014the team led the AL East from early to mid-April and held their record around .500 until late August. The Jays were hit with the injury bug when third baseman Corey Koskie broke his finger, taking him out of the lineup, but the club was pleasantly surprised with the performance of rookie call-up [[Aaron Hill (baseball)|Aaron Hill]] in his stead.\n\nOn July 8, just prior to the All-Star break, Blue Jays ace [[Roy Halladay]] was struck on the shin by a line drive from Texas left fielder [[Kevin Mench]] and was placed on the DL with a fractured leg. The injury cost Halladay his chance to be the American League starter in the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] in [[Detroit]]; his place on the All-Star squad was taken by Red Sox pitcher [[Matt Clement]]. Though Halladay's injury was hoped to be minor, the recovery process was met with constant delays, and Halladay eventually would prove to be out for the rest of the season. Team management officially announced that he would miss the rest of the season in August. The Halladay injury is seen by many as the negative turning point in the Jays season; the team had been in serious [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] contention at the time, but afterwards fell out of the race and failed to make the playoffs for the 12th consecutive year.\n\nOn July 22, Toronto traded utility infielder [[John McDonald (infielder)|John McDonald]] to the [[Detroit Tigers]] for cash considerations. This gave the Blue Jays an open spot on the roster so that [[Aaron Hill (baseball)|Aaron Hill]] could stay with the team when [[Corey Koskie]] returned from injury.\n\nOn July 28, Toronto played in the longest game in franchise history, innings-wise, an 18-inning marathon against the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] at Rogers Centre. The Jays won 2\u20131, after nearly five hours of play when [[Orlando Hudson]] hit a line drive past a drawn in infield, scoring [[Alex R\u00edos]] from third base.\n\nThe shutdown of Halladay for the remainder of the season seemed to affect the performance of the Jays. They went on a slump that brought their record under .500 in the beginning of September. From there, the Blue Jays finished the season 80\u201382 while receiving glimpses of the future from September call-ups [[Guillermo Quir\u00f3z]], [[John-Ford Griffin]], and [[Shaun Marcum]]. Marcum made himself noteworthy by posting an ERA of 0.00 over 5 relief appearances and 8 innings in September. Griffin hit his first career home run in the last game of the season and ended up going 4 for 13.\n\n[[Josh Towers]] also stepped up, showing largely unseen potential going 7\u20135 with a 2.91 ERA in the 2nd half of the year and a 13\u201312, 3.71 ERA season overall, making him arguably the unlikely ace of the Jays rotation with Halladay injured and [[Gustavo Chac\u00edn]] faltering somewhat after the All-Star break.\n\nThe 2005 Jays inability to score with men in scoring position was a turning point in many games that ended up as losses, also contributing to the 80&ndash;82 record, although as a positive, the team did improve by 13 wins and returned to their usual 80-win plateau.\n\nOn October 9, the Jays, along with their fans, mourned the loss of inaugural broadcaster [[Tom Cheek]]. Cheek, 66, succumbed to [[Brain tumor|brain cancer]] after just over a year-long battle. Cheek had broadcast 4,306 consecutive games since the first day of the franchise. His streak was ended in June 2004 when he took time off to visit his ailing father.\n\nIn the off-season, general manager J. P. Ricciardi began to make good use of the money that had been granted to the Jays by Rogers Communications before the season. Rogers had given Ricciardi $210 million over three years, which became $75 million a season to spend, $25 million more than the previous year. Ricciardi fulfilled the team's need for a stable [[closer (baseball)|closer]] by signing former [[Baltimore Orioles]] standout [[B. J. Ryan]] to the richest contract ever for a reliever \u2013 a 5-year, $47 million on November 28. Following that, the club awarded a 5-year, $55 million contract to highly coveted starting pitcher [[A. J. Burnett]], formerly of the [[Florida Marlins]], on December 6.\n\nOn December 23, 2005, [[Sportsnet|Rogers Sportsnet]] reported that the Jays added a much needed 30 plus home run hitter to their lineup by getting third baseman and 2002 World Series MVP [[Troy Glaus]] and minor league shortstop Sergio Santos in a trade with the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. In return, the Diamondbacks received second baseman and 2005 [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove Award]] winner [[Orlando Hudson]] and pitcher [[Miguel Batista]]. Glaus passed a team physical on December 26, and the trade was officially announced the next day. On the same day as the announcement of the Glaus deal, the Jays acquired solid-hitting first baseman [[Lyle Overbay]] and right-handed pitching prospect [[Ty Taubenheim]] in a trade with the Milwaukee Brewers; with pitcher [[Dave Bush]], pitching prospect [[Zach Jackson (pitcher, born 1983)|Zach Jackson]], and outfielder [[Gabe Gross]] going to Milwaukee. Glaus and Overbay were both introduced to the Toronto media together a few days later.\n\n===Season standings===\n{{2005 AL East Standings}}\n\n=== Record vs. opponents ===\n{{2005 AL Record vs.

Ignored by her fellow mean girls, Kacey finds a new way to express herself through music by becoming the lead singer of the pop/hip-hop band, Gravity 4 with Stevie ([[Lulu Antariksa]]), Zander ([[Max Schneider]]), Nelson ([[Noah Crawford]]), and Kevin ([[Christopher O'Neal]]). The success of the band, now renamed Gravity 5, begins a rivalry with Kacey's former group The Perfs, a rival band featuring her former friends, and now archrivals, Molly ([[Samantha Boscarino]]) and Grace ([[Halston Sage]]).\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n* Kacey Simon ([[Cymphonique Miller]]) is the former queen of The Perfs (perf is the abbreviation for \"perfect\"), and is the lead singer of Gravity 5. Kacey is confident, bold, somewhat self-centered, and now on a constant campaign to take her new friends and bandmates to the top of the school social ladder. She can sing and dance and she's proving to Gravity 5 that she also knows how to be a true friend. In the pilot, Molly and Grace refer to her as \"The Queen of Braces and Glasses.\" Although she ridicules the Gravity 5 band members at first, she soon joins them due to Zander's influence, has a much clearer view, and learns that she should just be herself and make friends that love her for who she is, not because of her popularity. Kacey is shown to be very feminine and fashionable and prefers to wear dresses and skirts and not T-shirts or jeans. But she still acts selfish to her friends, and she often gets them into trouble which she also gets them out of. Her and Molly's last names are references to 1960s singing duo [[Simon & Garfunkel]]. In \"How to Rock a Part Time Job\" her middle name is revealed to be Marie.\n* Molly Garfunkel ([[Samantha Boscarino]]) is the new Queen of the Perfs and the antagonist of the series. Molly is every bit as competitive, strong, popular, and radiant as Kacey, but she's also an evil mastermind plotting to bury Kacey once and for all, as demonstrated in the pilot episode when she humiliated Kacey in front of a particularly large crowd, only to be stopped by Zander, or when she texts Kacey's crush in front of Kacey, and unfortunately, Stevie, who shoots Molly down for [[harassing]] Kacey. Molly used to be Kacey's best friend, but after Kacey realizes Molly only liked her because she was perfect, Kacey quits the Perfs for good, which results in Molly hating her so much. Molly can be insecure in how she always trying to beat Kacey and prove herself to be the best queen bee to the school. It is possible that Molly was waiting for the perfect moment to get Kacey out of the picture so that she could be the most popular girl in school. Molly is an angel to her friends, showing her soft, sweet, warm and golden type of personality to fellow Perf Grace King, but she is extremely critical and snarky to the Gravity 5 band members. She also has a crush on Zander as seen in \"High School Sensation\" when she goes to stand next to Zander and when she says goodbye to Zander. She's also shown to care about her friendship with Grace in \"How to Rock Cee Lo\" and comes to realize how important Grace's friendship is after Grace temporarily leaves \"The Perfs\" after Molly pushed Grace too far with her snarkiness. Over the course of the series, she is seen to have a softer side for Gravity 5 (probably because of her crush on Zander).\n* Zander Robbins ([[Max Schneider]]) is the new kid in school and is the guitarist, keyboardist and DJ for Gravity 5. Zander is cool, handsome, sometimes [[vanity|vain]], and naive of the cliquish behavior of The Perfs, but he is also confident, optimistic, loyal and is the one that holds the band together. A running gag in the show is that he can't stop staring at himself in the mirror and hitting on girls, however, he mostly puts his friends first before anything. It is hinted that he and Kacey share one of the closest friendships in the group, as demonstrated when he sees Kacey being humiliated by Molly and Grace, and despite being one of the victims of Kacey being mean and nasty to, Zander comes to her rescue and offers her a place in Gravity 4. Although he cares about Kacey and intends to help her with her problems, Zander is not afraid to refuse or tell Kacey what she does wrong, as demonstrated in the episode \"How to Rock a Messy Bet\" Zander, on all occasions, sticks up for his friends even though he could be easily distracted at times. He also plays the ukulele and knows how to be a team player, always treating everyone like an equal and never looking down on anybody, even the Perfs, which can sometimes make him a bit of a wuss. Zander might like Stevie, but he's also found in episode, \"How to Rock a High School Sensation\" to seem to have a crush on Molly. In \"How to Rock a Yearbook\", Zander is found to constantly take bad yearbook pictures and has a little sister.\n* Stevie Baskara ([[Lulu Antariksa]]) is Gravity 5's smart, strong-headed, tough bass player. The guys like her because she is attractive and cool, but they fear her because she can and will crush them to have them respect her. She's not afraid to be herself, even if it means being a sarcastic tomboy. In \"How to Rock a Messy Bet\" it is revealed that she has four older brothers and in \"How to Rock a Secret Agent\" the only clothes she gets offered are sweat pants and sweat socks and that her middle name is Raina, her favorite color is ocean blue, and her birthday is February 8. A running gag in the show is that The Perfs constantly refer to her as \"Loserberry,\" much to her discomfort. Stevie is always more than willing to stick up for her friends even if it does mean being a little aggressive in behavior. She is said to have problems with \"slamming\" people, meaning that if you say something that will offend her, she will make a nasty come-back. Although usually fearless, Stevie could also be afraid of things as well, as demonstrated in \"How to Rock a Messy Bet\" when she practically jumped into Zander's arms after hearing something growl in the bands' practice room. Stevie's tough exterior also wilts whenever there is a new guy she is found to like. Then she gets really shy around the guy and Kacey usually does her best to help Stevie. Sometimes, Stevie's crushes will think Kacey's advances are meant from Kacey when she is really speaking for Stevie. She is also accomplished in playing the violin and the cello and on many occasions does so for many songs. Stevie is also said to have only two pairs of shoes, but one pair being completely destroyed by Kevin and Nelson in the episode \"How to Rock a Prank\". In \"How to Rock a Lunch Table,\" it is revealed she hates being woken up a 6:30&nbsp;a.m. because she claims that she should be \"drooling on her pillow.\" She may have a crush on Zander, who is her best friend. However, both characters have usually been shown to like other classmates. She's found to hold a job at Danny Mango's in \"How to Rock a Part-Time Job\" and seems to have stopped working for the school lunch program from the earlier episodes.\n* Grace King ([[Halston Sage]]) is queen bee Molly's gorgeous but naive sidekick, in the mean girl group The Perfs. Although she tries to follow Molly's evil lead, Grace just doesn't have it in her to be mean and in \"How to Rock Cee Lo\" Grace temporarily leaves \"The Perfs\" after Molly pushed her too far with her snarkiness. Whenever excited, Grace claps her hands together and squeals \"Yeah!\" which is possibly a catchphrase of hers. She has a big crush on Nelson. In the final aired episode, How to Rock Christmas, Nelson and Grace both kiss each other on the cheek. In the final production order episode, How to Rock a Tennis Ball, they end the episode with their arms around each other. In \"How To Rock a Uniform\" Grace is caught staring at Nelson, also in this episode they spend a lot of time with each other and in \"High School Sensation\" when she goes to stand next to him.\n* Nelson Baxter ([[Noah Crawford]]) is the tech-savvy, sci-fi loving keyboard player for Gravity 5, and also Kevin's best friend. Nelson is confident when talking about the ladies, but completely tongue-tied when he is face to face with them, which makes him extremely [[socially awkward]]. It is revealed in \"How to Rock a Messy Bet,\" that he and Kevin are addicted to the game \"Furious Pigeons,\" which is a parody of the game [[Angry Birds]], so addicted that they catapulted classmate Andy Bartlet half-way across the school. He is treasurer of the science club with a love for video games. He has a big crush on Grace. When Grace wants something he does it. In the final aired episode, How to Rock Christmas, Nelson and Grace both kiss each other on the cheek. In the final production order episode, How to Rock a Tennis Ball, they end the episode with their arms around each other. In \"How To Rock a Uniform\" Grace is caught staring at Nelson, also in this episode they spend a lot of time with each other and in \"High School Sensation\" when she goes to stand next to him. In \"How to Rock a Lunch Table,\" it is shown that he still sleeps with his baby blanket, Captain Blankie. In \"How to Rock a Birthday Party\", Kacey and Nelson are both found to share a birthday and to have known each other since grade school.\n* Kevin Reed ([[Christopher O'Neal]]) is the drummer for Gravity 5 and Nelson's best friend. He is food obsessed, awkward with the ladies and athletic enough to make every sports team, just not good enough to actually play, partly because of his laziness. When trying to talk to girls, he always passes out, which he gets pretty emotional over; in the pilot, he says, \"I ''was'' gonna kiss Kim Davis after we won, but now, I kiss no one!\" He is demonstrated as a terrible liar and a bit of a nervous wreck. He also has a crush on Kacey, as implied through his come-ons and numerous compliments towards her (although he might also have a crush on Molly). In the episode \"How to Rock an Election\", he is shown to be somewhat of a skilled rapper, and is also very funny and random. In \"How to Rock a Lunch Table,\" it is shown that he still sleeps with a [[stuffed animal]], named \"Mikey the [[Manatee]].\"\n\n===Recurring===\n* Andy Bartlet (Jacob Houston) is a student who goes to Brewster High School. He has a crush on Kacey and Stevie, and he often tries to flirt with them. He is also revealed to sometimes do things that disgust other people.\n*Mr. March ([[Kirk Fox]]) is the history teacher at Brewster High School. He often tries to talk like a \"young person\". His catch phrase is \"What's up?!\" In the pilot, Zander creates a diversion claiming that Mr. March got his head stuck in the faculty toilet in order to save Kacey from a crowd taking picture of her in her dorky glasses and braces.\n*Dahlia (HaleyAnn Johnson) is a student who goes to Brewster High School. She has an obsessive crush on Zander. She is otherwise very normal, doing things such as moderating the Class President debate and working on the school newspaper.\n* Mall Cop (Jason Sims-Prewitt) is an ill-tempered mall cop. He is occasionally irritated by Gravity 5's antics. He was also a Security Guard for Cee Lo Green at his concert.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |background=#1F367C |overall=5 |title=27 |director=17 |writer=23 |airdate=13 |prodcode=5 |viewers=10 |country=US |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |Title           = How to Rock Braces and Glasses\n |DirectedBy      = [[Eric Dean Seaton]]\n |WrittenBy       = ''Teleplay and Television Story by:''<br />[[Jim O'Doherty]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|2|4}}\n |ProdCode        = 101\n |Viewers         = 3.3<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/07/nickelodeon-wins-the-week-with-kids-and-total-viewers/119072/ |title=Nickelodeon Wins the Week with Kids and Total Viewers \u2013 Ratings &#124; TVbytheNumbers |publisher=Tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-08}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = After getting braces and glasses, Kacey Simon ([[Cymphonique Miller]]) falls from the popular group.

Kacey thinks giving up her phone will be a piece of cake. Stevie is forced to pair up with The Perfs for chemistry without \"slamming\" them, and gets help from Molly, who convinces Kacey's crush and one of the hottest boys in school, Tony Cardella, to text her, which he does to ask her out. Kevin and Nelson try to find a way to satisfy their need of their favorite game, \"Furious Pidgeons\". Zander has to go on without looking in a mirror, as he's always \"checking himself out\" and showing a little vanity. Kacey breaks everyone in the band except for Stevie. Then, Molly, knowing that Kacey won't break anytime soon, begins to text Tony, trying to make Kacey uncomfortable, but Stevie defends Kacey from further harassment by shooting a nasty comment at Molly (which is slamming, meaning she lost the bet). In the end, Kacey wins the bet, and she and Tony head off to get smoothies at the mall happily. Kacey then tells Tony that he should come to her gig, which he does.\n\n''Note'': The episode's fictional game, Furious Pigeons, is a parody of [[Angry Birds]].\n''Song featured'': \"Go With Gravity\"\n |LineColor       = 1F367C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = How to Rock a Guest List\n |DirectedBy      = [[Rich Correll]]\n |WrittenBy       = Bill Martin & Mike Schiff\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|2|11}}\n |ProdCode        = 106\n |Viewers         = 2.9<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/14/nickelodeons-victorious-and-how-to-rock-score-basic-cables-top-spots-with-tweens/119987/ |title=Nickelodeon\u2019s Victorious and How to Rock Score Basic Cable\u2019s Top Spots with Tweens \u2013 Ratings &#124; TVbytheNumbers |publisher=Tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com |accessdate=2012-02-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218005830/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/14/nickelodeons-victorious-and-how-to-rock-score-basic-cables-top-spots-with-tweens/119987/ |archivedate=2012-02-18 }}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = When Justin Cole, the most popular guy in school, hands out invitations for his party, the biggest party of the year, Kacey stands up for Gravity 5 to be invited too.

Ignored by her fellow mean girls, Kacey finds a new way to express herself through music by becoming the lead singer of the pop/hip-hop band, Gravity 4 with Stevie ([[Lulu Antariksa]]), Zander ([[Max Schneider]]), Nelson ([[Noah Crawford]]), and Kevin ([[Christopher O'Neal]]). The success of the band, now renamed Gravity 5, begins a rivalry with Kacey's former group The Perfs, a rival band featuring her former friends, and now archrivals, Molly ([[Samantha Boscarino]]) and Grace ([[Halston Sage]]).\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n* Kacey Simon ([[Cymphonique Miller]]) is the former queen of The Perfs (perf is the abbreviation for \"perfect\"), and is the lead singer of Gravity 5. Kacey is confident, bold, somewhat self-centered, and now on a constant campaign to take her new friends and bandmates to the top of the school social ladder. She can sing and dance and she's proving to Gravity 5 that she also knows how to be a true friend. In the pilot, Molly and Grace refer to her as \"The Queen of Braces and Glasses.\" Although she ridicules the Gravity 5 band members at first, she soon joins them due to Zander's influence, has a much clearer view, and learns that she should just be herself and make friends that love her for who she is, not because of her popularity. Kacey is shown to be very feminine and fashionable and prefers to wear dresses and skirts and not T-shirts or jeans. But she still acts selfish to her friends, and she often gets them into trouble which she also gets them out of. Her and Molly's last names are references to 1960s singing duo [[Simon & Garfunkel]]. In \"How to Rock a Part Time Job\" her middle name is revealed to be Marie.\n* Molly Garfunkel ([[Samantha Boscarino]]) is the new Queen of the Perfs and the antagonist of the series. Molly is every bit as competitive, strong, popular, and radiant as Kacey, but she's also an evil mastermind plotting to bury Kacey once and for all, as demonstrated in the pilot episode when she humiliated Kacey in front of a particularly large crowd, only to be stopped by Zander, or when she texts Kacey's crush in front of Kacey, and unfortunately, Stevie, who shoots Molly down for [[harassing]] Kacey. Molly used to be Kacey's best friend, but after Kacey realizes Molly only liked her because she was perfect, Kacey quits the Perfs for good, which results in Molly hating her so much. Molly can be insecure in how she always trying to beat Kacey and prove herself to be the best queen bee to the school. It is possible that Molly was waiting for the perfect moment to get Kacey out of the picture so that she could be the most popular girl in school. Molly is an angel to her friends, showing her soft, sweet, warm and golden type of personality to fellow Perf Grace King, but she is extremely critical and snarky to the Gravity 5 band members. She also has a crush on Zander as seen in \"High School Sensation\" when she goes to stand next to Zander and when she says goodbye to Zander. She's also shown to care about her friendship with Grace in \"How to Rock Cee Lo\" and comes to realize how important Grace's friendship is after Grace temporarily leaves \"The Perfs\" after Molly pushed Grace too far with her snarkiness. Over the course of the series, she is seen to have a softer side for Gravity 5 (probably because of her crush on Zander).\n* Zander Robbins ([[Max Schneider]]) is the new kid in school and is the guitarist, keyboardist and DJ for Gravity 5. Zander is cool, handsome, sometimes [[vanity|vain]], and naive of the cliquish behavior of The Perfs, but he is also confident, optimistic, loyal and is the one that holds the band together. A running gag in the show is that he can't stop staring at himself in the mirror and hitting on girls, however, he mostly puts his friends first before anything. It is hinted that he and Kacey share one of the closest friendships in the group, as demonstrated when he sees Kacey being humiliated by Molly and Grace, and despite being one of the victims of Kacey being mean and nasty to, Zander comes to her rescue and offers her a place in Gravity 4. Although he cares about Kacey and intends to help her with her problems, Zander is not afraid to refuse or tell Kacey what she does wrong, as demonstrated in the episode \"How to Rock a Messy Bet\" Zander, on all occasions, sticks up for his friends even though he could be easily distracted at times. He also plays the ukulele and knows how to be a team player, always treating everyone like an equal and never looking down on anybody, even the Perfs, which can sometimes make him a bit of a wuss. Zander might like Stevie, but he's also found in episode, \"How to Rock a High School Sensation\" to seem to have a crush on Molly. In \"How to Rock a Yearbook\", Zander is found to constantly take bad yearbook pictures and has a little sister.\n* Stevie Baskara ([[Lulu Antariksa]]) is Gravity 5's smart, strong-headed, tough bass player. The guys like her because she is attractive and cool, but they fear her because she can and will crush them to have them respect her. She's not afraid to be herself, even if it means being a sarcastic tomboy. In \"How to Rock a Messy Bet\" it is revealed that she has four older brothers and in \"How to Rock a Secret Agent\" the only clothes she gets offered are sweat pants and sweat socks and that her middle name is Raina, her favorite color is ocean blue, and her birthday is February 8. A running gag in the show is that The Perfs constantly refer to her as \"Loserberry,\" much to her discomfort. Stevie is always more than willing to stick up for her friends even if it does mean being a little aggressive in behavior. She is said to have problems with \"slamming\" people, meaning that if you say something that will offend her, she will make a nasty come-back. Although usually fearless, Stevie could also be afraid of things as well, as demonstrated in \"How to Rock a Messy Bet\" when she practically jumped into Zander's arms after hearing something growl in the bands' practice room. Stevie's tough exterior also wilts whenever there is a new guy she is found to like. Then she gets really shy around the guy and Kacey usually does her best to help Stevie. Sometimes, Stevie's crushes will think Kacey's advances are meant from Kacey when she is really speaking for Stevie. She is also accomplished in playing the violin and the cello and on many occasions does so for many songs. Stevie is also said to have only two pairs of shoes, but one pair being completely destroyed by Kevin and Nelson in the episode \"How to Rock a Prank\". In \"How to Rock a Lunch Table,\" it is revealed she hates being woken up a 6:30&nbsp;a.m. because she claims that she should be \"drooling on her pillow.\" She may have a crush on Zander, who is her best friend. However, both characters have usually been shown to like other classmates. She's found to hold a job at Danny Mango's in \"How to Rock a Part-Time Job\" and seems to have stopped working for the school lunch program from the earlier episodes.\n* Grace King ([[Halston Sage]]) is queen bee Molly's gorgeous but naive sidekick, in the mean girl group The Perfs. Although she tries to follow Molly's evil lead, Grace just doesn't have it in her to be mean and in \"How to Rock Cee Lo\" Grace temporarily leaves \"The Perfs\" after Molly pushed her too far with her snarkiness. Whenever excited, Grace claps her hands together and squeals \"Yeah!\" which is possibly a catchphrase of hers. She has a big crush on Nelson. In the final aired episode, How to Rock Christmas, Nelson and Grace both kiss each other on the cheek. In the final production order episode, How to Rock a Tennis Ball, they end the episode with their arms around each other. In \"How To Rock a Uniform\" Grace is caught staring at Nelson, also in this episode they spend a lot of time with each other and in \"High School Sensation\" when she goes to stand next to him.\n* Nelson Baxter ([[Noah Crawford]]) is the tech-savvy, sci-fi loving keyboard player for Gravity 5, and also Kevin's best friend. Nelson is confident when talking about the ladies, but completely tongue-tied when he is face to face with them, which makes him extremely [[socially awkward]]. It is revealed in \"How to Rock a Messy Bet,\" that he and Kevin are addicted to the game \"Furious Pigeons,\" which is a parody of the game [[Angry Birds]], so addicted that they catapulted classmate Andy Bartlet half-way across the school. He is treasurer of the science club with a love for video games. He has a big crush on Grace. When Grace wants something he does it. In the final aired episode, How to Rock Christmas, Nelson and Grace both kiss each other on the cheek. In the final production order episode, How to Rock a Tennis Ball, they end the episode with their arms around each other. In \"How To Rock a Uniform\" Grace is caught staring at Nelson, also in this episode they spend a lot of time with each other and in \"High School Sensation\" when she goes to stand next to him. In \"How to Rock a Lunch Table,\" it is shown that he still sleeps with his baby blanket, Captain Blankie. In \"How to Rock a Birthday Party\", Kacey and Nelson are both found to share a birthday and to have known each other since grade school.\n* Kevin Reed ([[Christopher O'Neal]]) is the drummer for Gravity 5 and Nelson's best friend. He is food obsessed, awkward with the ladies and athletic enough to make every sports team, just not good enough to actually play, partly because of his laziness. When trying to talk to girls, he always passes out, which he gets pretty emotional over; in the pilot, he says, \"I ''was'' gonna kiss Kim Davis after we won, but now, I kiss no one!\" He is demonstrated as a terrible liar and a bit of a nervous wreck. He also has a crush on Kacey, as implied through his come-ons and numerous compliments towards her (although he might also have a crush on Molly). In the episode \"How to Rock an Election\", he is shown to be somewhat of a skilled rapper, and is also very funny and random. In \"How to Rock a Lunch Table,\" it is shown that he still sleeps with a [[stuffed animal]], named \"Mikey the [[Manatee]].\"\n\n===Recurring===\n* Andy Bartlet (Jacob Houston) is a student who goes to Brewster High School. He has a crush on Kacey and Stevie, and he often tries to flirt with them. He is also revealed to sometimes do things that disgust other people.\n*Mr. March ([[Kirk Fox]]) is the history teacher at Brewster High School. He often tries to talk like a \"young person\". His catch phrase is \"What's up?!\" In the pilot, Zander creates a diversion claiming that Mr. March got his head stuck in the faculty toilet in order to save Kacey from a crowd taking picture of her in her dorky glasses and braces.\n*Dahlia (HaleyAnn Johnson) is a student who goes to Brewster High School. She has an obsessive crush on Zander. She is otherwise very normal, doing things such as moderating the Class President debate and working on the school newspaper.\n* Mall Cop (Jason Sims-Prewitt) is an ill-tempered mall cop. He is occasionally irritated by Gravity 5's antics. He was also a Security Guard for Cee Lo Green at his concert.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |background=#1F367C |overall=5 |title=27 |director=17 |writer=23 |airdate=13 |prodcode=5 |viewers=10 |country=US |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |Title           = How to Rock Braces and Glasses\n |DirectedBy      = [[Eric Dean Seaton]]\n |WrittenBy       = ''Teleplay and Television Story by:''<br />[[Jim O'Doherty]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|2|4}}\n |ProdCode        = 101\n |Viewers         = 3.3<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/07/nickelodeon-wins-the-week-with-kids-and-total-viewers/119072/ |title=Nickelodeon Wins the Week with Kids and Total Viewers \u2013 Ratings &#124; TVbytheNumbers |publisher=Tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-08}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = After getting braces and glasses, Kacey Simon ([[Cymphonique Miller]]) falls from the popular group.

Kacey thinks giving up her phone will be a piece of cake. Stevie is forced to pair up with The Perfs for chemistry without \"slamming\" them, and gets help from Molly, who convinces Kacey's crush and one of the hottest boys in school, Tony Cardella, to text her, which he does to ask her out. Kevin and Nelson try to find a way to satisfy their need of their favorite game, \"Furious Pidgeons\". Zander has to go on without looking in a mirror, as he's always \"checking himself out\" and showing a little vanity. Kacey breaks everyone in the band except for Stevie. Then, Molly, knowing that Kacey won't break anytime soon, begins to text Tony, trying to make Kacey uncomfortable, but Stevie defends Kacey from further harassment by shooting a nasty comment at Molly (which is slamming, meaning she lost the bet). In the end, Kacey wins the bet, and she and Tony head off to get smoothies at the mall happily. Kacey then tells Tony that he should come to her gig, which he does.\n\n''Note'': The episode's fictional game, Furious Pigeons, is a parody of [[Angry Birds]].\n''Song featured'': \"Go With Gravity\"\n |LineColor       = 1F367C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = How to Rock a Guest List\n |DirectedBy      = [[Rich Correll]]\n |WrittenBy       = Bill Martin & Mike Schiff\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|2|11}}\n |ProdCode        = 106\n |Viewers         = 2.9<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/14/nickelodeons-victorious-and-how-to-rock-score-basic-cables-top-spots-with-tweens/119987/ |title=Nickelodeon\u2019s Victorious and How to Rock Score Basic Cable\u2019s Top Spots with Tweens \u2013 Ratings &#124; TVbytheNumbers |publisher=Tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com |accessdate=2012-02-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218005830/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/14/nickelodeons-victorious-and-how-to-rock-score-basic-cables-top-spots-with-tweens/119987/ |archivedate=2012-02-18 }}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = When Justin Cole, the most popular guy in school, hands out invitations for his party, the biggest party of the year, Kacey stands up for Gravity 5 to be invited too.

Launching into action, Kacey schools her bandmates on being cool, but later learns that asking her friends to change is the wrong approach, because at the party, things go downhill: Zander starts to get sweaty, Kevin and Nelson are fooling around (such as wanting to get into the [[V.I.P.]] area by forcing Zander to fake an injury and playing with the chocolate fountain), and Stevie, learning the Justin likes her and finds her cool, starts leg wrestling him. After Kacey freaks out, Justin nearly kicks her out, saying her band mates are already cool and that she's actually being uncool by trying to change them, and despite Kacey constantly trying to force them into being something they're not, her friends stand by her and stick up for her, saying that if Kacey's out, they're out.\n\n''Song featured'': \"Hey Now\"\n |LineColor       = 1F367C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |Title           = How to Rock a Statue\n |DirectedBy      = Rich Correll\n |WrittenBy       = Erica Spates & <br />Sam Littenberg-Weisberg\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|2|18}}\n |ProdCode        = 107\n |Viewers         = 2.6<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thevoiceoftv.com/nielsen-tv-ratings/saturday-february-18-2012-cable-finals/ |title=Saturday February 18, 2012 Cable Finals |accessdate=2015-12-07 }}{{dead link|date=April 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = When Zander enters a school art contest to impress his latest crush Dana Blaire, Kacey offers to \"help\" by being his muse.

Manjaro uses three sets of [[software repository|repositories]]: The unstable repositories contain the most [[Bleeding edge technology|bleeding edge]] Arch packages, possibly one or two days delayed; the testing repositories contain packages from the unstable repositories synchronized every week, which provides an initial screening; and the stable repositories contain only packages that are deemed stable by the development team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/Repositories_and_Servers|title=Repositories and Servers|website=Manjaro Wiki|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425184849/http://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/Repositories_and_Servers|archive-date=2013-04-25|url-status=live|access-date=2013-01-08}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|January 2019}}, non-security related package updates derived from the [[Arch Linux]] stable branch to the Manjaro stable branch typically have a lag of a few weeks.<ref name=\"Fossbytes2018\"/><ref name=\"Lag\" group=\"Note\"/>\n\n==History==\nManjaro was first released on July 10, 2011.<ref name=ForumRelease/> By mid 2013, Manjaro was in the beta stage, though key elements of the final system had all been implemented such as: a GUI installer (then an [[Antergos]] installer fork); a package manager (Pacman) with its choice of frontends; Pamac ([[GTK]]) for [[Xfce]] desktop and Octopi ([[Qt (software)|Qt]]) for its [[Openbox]] edition; MHWD ('''M'''anjaro '''H'''ard'''W'''are '''D'''etection, for detection of [[Free software|free]] & [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] video drivers); and Manjaro Settings Manager (for system-wide settings, user management, and graphics driver installation and management).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/Manjaro_Hardware_Detection_Overview|title= Mhwd page on the Manjaro Wiki|access-date= 2013-01-08|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140102183957/http://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/Manjaro_Hardware_Detection_Overview|archive-date= 2014-01-02|url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n[[GNOME Shell]] support was dropped with the release of version 0.8.3. in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://manjaro.org/2012/12/24/manjaro-0-8-3-has-been-unleashed-2/|title=Manjaro 0.8.3 has been unleashed!|last=Carl|date=2012-12-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531085431/https://manjaro.org/2012/12/24/manjaro-0-8-3-has-been-unleashed-2/|archive-date=2013-05-31|url-status=dead|access-date=2013-04-24}}</ref> However, efforts within Arch Linux made it possible to restart the Cinnamon/GNOME edition as a community edition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://manjaro.org/2013/05/13/manjaro-0-8-5-2-community-releases-unleashed-kde-cinnamon-mate/|title=Manjaro 0.8.5.2 Community Releases unleashed (KDE, Cinnamon, MATE)|date=2013-05-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903082223/https://manjaro.org/2013/05/13/manjaro-0-8-5-2-community-releases-unleashed-kde-cinnamon-mate/|archive-date=2018-09-03|url-status=dead|access-date=2013-05-29}}</ref> An official release offering the [[GNOME desktop]] environment was reinstated in March 2017.<ref name=\"relManjaro170gnome\"/>\n\nDuring the development of Manjaro 0.9.0 at the end of August 2015, the Manjaro team decided to switch to year and month designations for the Manjaro version scheme instead of numbers.

The distribution worked smoothly and worked well with both my physical hardware and my virtual environment. I also enjoyed Manjaro's habit of telling me when new software (particularly new versions of the Linux kernel) was available.\nI fumbled a little with Manjaro's settings panel and finding some settings, but in the end I was pleased with the range of configuration I could achieve with the distribution.

The distribution worked smoothly and worked well with both my physical hardware and my virtual environment. I also enjoyed Manjaro's habit of telling me when new software (particularly new versions of the Linux kernel) was available.\nI fumbled a little with Manjaro's settings panel and finding some settings, but in the end I was pleased with the range of configuration I could achieve with the distribution.

Charlestown was laid out in 1629 by engineer [[Thomas Graves (engineer)|Thomas Graves]], one of its earliest settlers, in the reign of [[Charles I of England]]. It was originally a separate town and the first capital of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].\n\nCharlestown became a city in 1848 and was annexed by Boston on January 5, 1874. With that, it also switched from [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]], to which it had belonged since 1643, to [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]. It has had a substantial [[Irish Americans|Irish-American]] population since the migration of [[Irish people]] during the [[Great Irish Famine]] of the 1840s. Since the late 1980s, the neighborhood has changed dramatically because of its proximity to downtown and its colonial architecture. A mix of [[yuppie]] and [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] [[gentrification]] has influenced much of the area, as it has in many of Boston's neighborhoods, but Charlestown still maintains a strong Irish-American population and [[Charlestown Townies|\"Townie\" identity]].\n\nIn the 21st century, Charlestown's diversity has expanded dramatically, along with growing rates of the very poor and very wealthy. Today Charlestown is a largely residential neighborhood, with much housing near the waterfront, overlooking the Boston skyline. Charlestown is home to many historic sites, hospitals and organizations, with access from the Orange Line [[Sullivan Square]] or Community College stops or the I-93 expressway.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Bunker Hill Monument and Statue.JPG|thumb|upright|left|The Bunker Hill Monument and William Prescott Statue]]\n{{US Census population\n| 1800 = 2751\n| 1810 = 4959\n| 1820 = 6591\n| 1830 = 8783\n| 1840 = 11484\n| 1850 = 17216\n| 1860 = 25065\n| 1870 = 28323\n}}\n\nThomas and Jane Walford<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kristinhall.org/fambly/Walford/WalfordName.html|title=Walford Family Line|accessdate=2009-05-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005170609/http://kristinhall.org/fambly/Walford/WalfordName.html|archive-date=2011-10-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> were the original English settlers of the peninsula between the [[Charles (river, Massachusetts)|Charles]] and the [[Mystic River|Mystic]]. They were given a grant by Sir Robert Gorges, with whom they had settled at [[Wessagusset Colony|Wessagusset]] ([[Weymouth, Massachusetts|Weymouth]]) in September 1623 and arrived at what they called Mishawaum in 1624. [[John Endicott]], first governor of [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], sent William, Richard and Ralph Sprague to Mishawaum to lay out a settlement. Thomas Walford, acting as an interpreter with the Massachusetts Indians, negotiated with the local [[sachem]] [[Wonohaquaham]] for Endicott and his people to settle there. Although Walford had a virtual monopoly on the region's available [[fur trading|furs]], he welcomed the newcomers and helped them in any way he could, unaware that his Episcopalian religious beliefs would cause him to be banished from Massachusetts to [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]], [[New Hampshire]], within three years.\n\nOriginally a [[Puritan]] English city during the Colonial era, Charlestown proper was founded in 1628 and settled July 4, 1629, by [[Thomas Graves (engineer)|Thomas Graves]], [[Increase Nowell]], Simon Hoyt, the Rev. Francis Bright, Ralph, Richard and [[William Sprague (1609\u20131675)|William Sprague]], and about 100 others who preceded the [[Great Migration (Puritan)|Great Migration]].

It is also the terminus of the [[Charlestown Bridge]] and the former [[Warren Bridge]], and was formerly a stop on the [[Charlestown Elevated]]. The [[Central Artery]] was built between 1951 and 1954, routing elevated ramps through City Square. The Central Artery North Area (CANA) project moved these underground, into the City Square Tunnel, making way for a revitalized surface park.\n\n[[Thompson Square (Charlestown, Boston)|Thompson Square]] is located at the confluence of Main Street, Dexter Row, Green Street, and Austin Street. It was also formerly a stop on the [[Charlestown Elevated]].\n\nA small portion of Charlestown is north of the Mystic River, containing the northern approach to the Malden Bridge and now the entrance to [[Encore Boston Harbor]] (which made jusrisdiction over the casino a matter of dispute).

The building was one of the first built after the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. The Tavern took its name from Dr. [[Joseph Warren]], American Patriot who played a key role in the American Revolution and was killed in the Battle of Bunker Hill. It was Warren who directed Paul Revere and William Dawes to send the message to Samuel Adams and John Hancock that the British were setting out to raid the town of Concord. Warren's friend Captain Eliphelet Newell decided to build a tavern named after his friend. George Washington visited the tavern when he came to Massachusetts to visit his friend Benjamin Frothingham.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} After the Tavern was closed in 1813, the building served other purposes, and then was saved in the 1970s.

Charlestown was laid out in 1629 by engineer [[Thomas Graves (engineer)|Thomas Graves]], one of its earliest settlers, in the reign of [[Charles I of England]]. It was originally a separate town and the first capital of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].\n\nCharlestown became a city in 1848 and was annexed by Boston on January 5, 1874. With that, it also switched from [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]], to which it had belonged since 1643, to [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]. It has had a substantial [[Irish Americans|Irish-American]] population since the migration of [[Irish people]] during the [[Great Irish Famine]] of the 1840s. Since the late 1980s, the neighborhood has changed dramatically because of its proximity to downtown and its colonial architecture. A mix of [[yuppie]] and [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] [[gentrification]] has influenced much of the area, as it has in many of Boston's neighborhoods, but Charlestown still maintains a strong Irish-American population and [[Charlestown Townies|\"Townie\" identity]].\n\nIn the 21st century, Charlestown's diversity has expanded dramatically, along with growing rates of the very poor and very wealthy. Today Charlestown is a largely residential neighborhood, with much housing near the waterfront, overlooking the Boston skyline. Charlestown is home to many historic sites, hospitals and organizations, with access from the Orange Line [[Sullivan Square]] or Community College stops or the I-93 expressway.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Bunker Hill Monument and Statue.JPG|thumb|upright|left|The Bunker Hill Monument and William Prescott Statue]]\n{{US Census population\n| 1800 = 2751\n| 1810 = 4959\n| 1820 = 6591\n| 1830 = 8783\n| 1840 = 11484\n| 1850 = 17216\n| 1860 = 25065\n| 1870 = 28323\n}}\n\nThomas and Jane Walford<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kristinhall.org/fambly/Walford/WalfordName.html|title=Walford Family Line|accessdate=2009-05-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005170609/http://kristinhall.org/fambly/Walford/WalfordName.html|archive-date=2011-10-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> were the original English settlers of the peninsula between the [[Charles (river, Massachusetts)|Charles]] and the [[Mystic River|Mystic]]. They were given a grant by Sir Robert Gorges, with whom they had settled at [[Wessagusset Colony|Wessagusset]] ([[Weymouth, Massachusetts|Weymouth]]) in September 1623 and arrived at what they called Mishawaum in 1624. [[John Endicott]], first governor of [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], sent William, Richard and Ralph Sprague to Mishawaum to lay out a settlement. Thomas Walford, acting as an interpreter with the Massachusetts Indians, negotiated with the local [[sachem]] [[Wonohaquaham]] for Endicott and his people to settle there. Although Walford had a virtual monopoly on the region's available [[fur trading|furs]], he welcomed the newcomers and helped them in any way he could, unaware that his Episcopalian religious beliefs would cause him to be banished from Massachusetts to [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]], [[New Hampshire]], within three years.\n\nOriginally a [[Puritan]] English city during the Colonial era, Charlestown proper was founded in 1628 and settled July 4, 1629, by [[Thomas Graves (engineer)|Thomas Graves]], [[Increase Nowell]], Simon Hoyt, the Rev. Francis Bright, Ralph, Richard and [[William Sprague (1609\u20131675)|William Sprague]], and about 100 others who preceded the [[Great Migration (Puritan)|Great Migration]].

It is also the terminus of the [[Charlestown Bridge]] and the former [[Warren Bridge]], and was formerly a stop on the [[Charlestown Elevated]]. The [[Central Artery]] was built between 1951 and 1954, routing elevated ramps through City Square. The Central Artery North Area (CANA) project moved these underground, into the City Square Tunnel, making way for a revitalized surface park.\n\n[[Thompson Square (Charlestown, Boston)|Thompson Square]] is located at the confluence of Main Street, Dexter Row, Green Street, and Austin Street.

It was Warren who directed Paul Revere and William Dawes to send the message to Samuel Adams and John Hancock that the British were setting out to raid the town of Concord. Warren's friend Captain Eliphelet Newell decided to build a tavern named after his friend. George Washington visited the tavern when he came to Massachusetts to visit his friend Benjamin Frothingham.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} After the Tavern was closed in 1813, the building served other purposes, and then was saved in the 1970s.
