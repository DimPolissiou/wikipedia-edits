It is similar to the [[Indian locomotive class WAP-7|WAP-7]] class locomotive but features a different [[gear ratio]], which makes it suitable for heavy freight operations. In November 1998, the [[Chittaranjan Locomotive Works]] (CLW) started producing these with indigenous components. The first of which, named '''Navyug (New Era)''', was produced on 14 November 1998. Like the [[Indian Locomotive Class WAP-5|WAP-5 units]], the WAG-9 has GTO [[thyristor]] converters and three-phase asynchronous motors.\n\nNewer versions of the WAG-9 feature full [[Insulated-gate bipolar transistor]] (IGBT) traction control; the debut model was the ''WAG-9 31248''. The class as a whole is denoted by the WAG-9i prefix in its model number, although there is a technical variant of this class named WAG-9H, with the \"H\" meaning \"Heavy\".\n\nThe WAG-9H/9Hi locomotives are the second heaviest in regular service in India, the only freight-dedicated three-phase AC locomotives in the country, and the only electric locomotives in India fitted with IGBT. They are also the freight locomotives with the highest operational speed in India.\n[[File:BHILAI based WAG9H 31283 standing in Katihar goods yard.jpg|thumb|Bhilai based WAG9H standing at Katihar goods yard]]\n[[File:LDH_based_WAG9HC_32523_with_BCNA_entering_Katihar.jpg|thumb|Ludhiana based WAG9HC with BCNA entering Katihar]]\n[[File:Gomoh based WAG-9 loco - 31049 with BOX - type freight rake.jpg|thumb|280px|Gomoh based WAG-9 loco - 31049 with BOX - type freight rake]]\n[[File:WAG9-31179.jpg|thumb|280px|Indian Railways WAG-9 class AC electric locomotive no. 31179 pauses at Agra Fort railway station (Indian Railways station code AF), at the head of a heavily laden eastbound coal train.]]\n[[File:LGD based WAG-9 Locomotives at Ghatkesar 02.JPG|thumb|280px|[[Lallaguda]] based WAG-9 Locomotives at [[Ghatkesar]]]]\n[[File:WAG 9 - Navshatak.JPG|thumb|280px|WAG 9 - Navshatak]]\n[[File:WAG 9 at Vasai Road Station.jpg|thumb|280px|WAG 9 at [[Vasai Road railway station|Vasai Road]]]]\n\n==Introduction==\nThe WAG-9 [[locomotive]] is referred to as the \"Heavy Haul\" freight locomotive of the Indian Railways (IR). It was conceived in response to the extreme growth in the rail freight transportation sector, which is considered to be of great importance to the growth of the [[economy of India]]. The need for more [[electrification]] and electric locomotives in India had increased. Around 60-65% of the freight haulage of the IR takes place on the electrified section of the Golden Quadrilateral (Indian Railways) and diagonals (which account for 25% of the route). These are very busy routes, so clearance is a necessity. Electrical powers give it a great sectional clearance ability. Thus, these locomotives are important for the Indian Railways.\n\nThese locomotives have entered the [[Western Railway zone]] of [[Mumbai]]. The first 22 units were imported from [[Adtranz]] (ABB). Of these, the first six were fully assembled and rest were in kit form. Again in the kit form, seven were completely knocked down and the rest were partially assembled. CLW started producing these traction motors on 1 November 1999. The units built by ABB have double-pan [[Pantograph (transport)|pantographs]] while the CLW built units have single pan pantographs which are common in India. This class had a capacity to MU several units, but IR restricts them to two, because of dynamic loading restriction on most bridges. Regenerative brakes provide about 260&nbsp;kN of braking effort.\n\nThe WAG-9H also has different application software than the WAG-9. The first WAG-9H was commissioned on 30 June 2000. The #30130 prototype was housed at [[Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Gomoh railway station|Gomoh]] (GMO). This was then converted back to standard WAG-9 in 2002. This unit has a livery of twin white stripes on green, instead of yellow stripe on green, seen on the other WAG-9(x)s.\n\nThe WAG-9i was introduced in 2010, and was #31215. It was homed at the GMO shed. With IGBT, even if one traction motor failed, other traction motors can function with a total output of 5500&nbsp;hp.\n\nNewer WAG-9 units have \"CLW Glorious 50 years\" marked on their sides. Some WAG-9(x)s are fitted with a solid cowcatcher while others are fitted with grilled cowcatchers. Some have American style flasher lamps while others have Indian style flasher lamps. http://elocos.railnet.gov.in/Study_Material/TSD_3Ph.pdf.\n\n== Operations ==\nWAG-9 has quickly become one of the important locos in the Indian railways. With its higher power, this locomotive has replaced WAG-7 which was the main electric loco before WAG-9's arrival. Applications where twin WAG-7s were required are now handled by a single WAG-9. This includes both leading a long consist and for banking operations.  The regenerative braking capabilities of WAG-9 has also helped reduce the electricity consumption. The original WAG-9 had some wheel slippage incidents while hauling heavy load. This was rectified through the introduction of WAG-9H and subsequently using WAG-9i. This has significantly reduced the issue that were associated with the original version.\n\n<br /> Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW) turned out its first 9,000&nbsp;hp WAG-9 freight locomotive on 31 March 2019, the last day of the financial year. This 9,000&nbsp;hp version of the WAG-9H has been classified by IR as WAG-9 HH. The first H stands for higher axle load and the second H stands for the higher power rating. The class has been allocated a block of serial numbers starting with 90001, the number of the first unit. The decision to upgrade the power output of the WAG-9 was taken to partly meet the demands of the upcoming electrified Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (WDFC). The upgraded locomotive class will also augment hauling capacity on the existing network of the Indian Railways.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.railpost.in/new-9000-hp-wag-9-hh-locomotive-rolls-out-of-clw/|title=New 9,000 hp WAG-9 HH Locomotive Rolls Out of CLW|last=|first=|last2=|date=2019-04-02|website=RailPost.in - Indian Railways News & Analysis|accessdate=2019-04-05|last3=|first3=|last4=|last5=|first5=}}</ref>\n\n== Future Developments ==\nWAG-9s are modified to have high-reach pantographs. This is to enable them carry double-stack containers in electrified sections. In such sections, the Overhead wires are placed in a higher position. Another version with 9000&nbsp;hp is also under development.\n\n==Technical specifications==\nThe WAG-9 technical specifications are:<ref>[http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2e.html#loco Indian AC electric loco information]</ref>\n{| class=wikitable\n|Traction Motors\n|ABB's 6FRA 6068 (850&nbsp;kW, 2180V, 1283/2484 rpm, 270/310A.

It is similar to the [[Indian locomotive class WAP-7|WAP-7]] class locomotive but features a different [[gear ratio]], which makes it suitable for heavy freight operations. In November 1998, the [[Chittaranjan Locomotive Works]] (CLW) started producing these with indigenous components. The first of which, named '''Navyug (New Era)''', was produced on 14 November 1998. Like the [[Indian Locomotive Class WAP-5|WAP-5 units]], the WAG-9 has GTO [[thyristor]] converters and three-phase asynchronous motors.\n\nNewer versions of the WAG-9 feature full [[Insulated-gate bipolar transistor]] (IGBT) traction control; the debut model was the ''WAG-9 31248''. The class as a whole is denoted by the WAG-9i prefix in its model number, although there is a technical variant of this class named WAG-9H, with the \"H\" meaning \"Heavy\".\n\nThe WAG-9H/9Hi locomotives are the second heaviest in regular service in India, the only freight-dedicated three-phase AC locomotives in the country, and the only electric locomotives in India fitted with IGBT. They are also the freight locomotives with the highest operational speed in India.\n[[File:BHILAI based WAG9H 31283 standing in Katihar goods yard.jpg|thumb|Bhilai based WAG9H standing at Katihar goods yard]]\n[[File:LDH_based_WAG9HC_32523_with_BCNA_entering_Katihar.jpg|thumb|Ludhiana based WAG9HC with BCNA entering Katihar]]\n[[File:Gomoh based WAG-9 loco - 31049 with BOX - type freight rake.jpg|thumb|280px|Gomoh based WAG-9 loco - 31049 with BOX - type freight rake]]\n[[File:WAG9-31179.jpg|thumb|280px|Indian Railways WAG-9 class AC electric locomotive no. 31179 pauses at Agra Fort railway station (Indian Railways station code AF), at the head of a heavily laden eastbound coal train.]]\n[[File:LGD based WAG-9 Locomotives at Ghatkesar 02.JPG|thumb|280px|[[Lallaguda]] based WAG-9 Locomotives at [[Ghatkesar]]]]\n[[File:WAG 9 - Navshatak.JPG|thumb|280px|WAG 9 - Navshatak]]\n[[File:WAG 9 at Vasai Road Station.jpg|thumb|280px|WAG 9 at [[Vasai Road railway station|Vasai Road]]]]\n\n==Introduction==\nThe WAG-9 [[locomotive]] is referred to as the \"Heavy Haul\" freight locomotive of the Indian Railways (IR). It was conceived in response to the extreme growth in the rail freight transportation sector, which is considered to be of great importance to the growth of the [[economy of India]]. The need for more [[electrification]] and electric locomotives in India had increased. Around 60-65% of the freight haulage of the IR takes place on the electrified section of the Golden Quadrilateral (Indian Railways) and diagonals (which account for 25% of the route). These are very busy routes, so clearance is a necessity. Electrical powers give it a great sectional clearance ability. Thus, these locomotives are important for the Indian Railways.\n\nThese locomotives have entered the [[Western Railway zone]] of [[Mumbai]]. The first 22 units were imported from [[Adtranz]] (ABB). Of these, the first six were fully assembled and rest were in kit form. Again in the kit form, seven were completely knocked down and the rest were partially assembled. CLW started producing these traction motors on 1 November 1999. The units built by ABB have double-pan [[Pantograph (transport)|pantographs]] while the CLW built units have single pan pantographs which are common in India. This class had a capacity to MU several units, but IR restricts them to two, because of dynamic loading restriction on most bridges. Regenerative brakes provide about 260&nbsp;kN of braking effort.\n\nThe WAG-9H also has different application software than the WAG-9. The first WAG-9H was commissioned on 30 June 2000. The #30130 prototype was housed at [[Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Gomoh railway station|Gomoh]] (GMO). This was then converted back to standard WAG-9 in 2002. This unit has a livery of twin white stripes on green, instead of yellow stripe on green, seen on the other WAG-9(x)s.\n\nThe WAG-9i was introduced in 2010, and was #31215. It was homed at the GMO shed. With IGBT, even if one traction motor failed, other traction motors can function with a total output of 5500&nbsp;hp.\n\nNewer WAG-9 units have \"CLW Glorious 50 years\" marked on their sides. Some WAG-9(x)s are fitted with a solid cowcatcher while others are fitted with grilled cowcatchers. Some have American style flasher lamps while others have Indian style flasher lamps. http://elocos.railnet.gov.in/Study_Material/TSD_3Ph.pdf.\n\n== Operations ==\nWAG-9 has quickly become one of the important locos in the Indian railways. With its higher power, this locomotive has replaced WAG-7 which was the main electric loco before WAG-9's arrival. Applications where twin WAG-7s were required are now handled by a single WAG-9. This includes both leading a long consist and for banking operations.  The regenerative braking capabilities of WAG-9 has also helped reduce the electricity consumption. The original WAG-9 had some wheel slippage incidents while hauling heavy load. This was rectified through the introduction of WAG-9H and subsequently using WAG-9i. This has significantly reduced the issue that were associated with the original version.\n\n<br /> Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW) turned out its first 9,000&nbsp;hp WAG-9 freight locomotive on 31 March 2019, the last day of the financial year. This 9,000&nbsp;hp version of the WAG-9H has been classified by IR as WAG-9 HH. The first H stands for higher axle load and the second H stands for the higher power rating. The class has been allocated a block of serial numbers starting with 90001, the number of the first unit. The decision to upgrade the power output of the WAG-9 was taken to partly meet the demands of the upcoming electrified Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (WDFC).

It is the sixth and final sequel to the [[Young and Dangerous (film series)|''Young and Dangerous'' film series]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nChicken ([[Jordan Chan]]) is set to marry the daughter of a Japanese [[yakuza]] boss ([[Sonny Chiba]]). When Chicken is set up, his old pals return to clear his name.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story starts with Chan Ho-Nam ([[Ekin Cheng]]) still being paranoid about the horrific death and his relationship with Smartie ([[Gigi Lai]]) which constantly gives him nightmares. After having Mei Ling ([[Shu Qi]]) hinting that she wants to marry Ho-Nam, Ho-Nam shown little to no reaction due to the fear of losing another loved ones. That night, Ho-Nam goes to his pub only to be noticed that Chicken ([[Jordan Chan]]) was set up by Taiwan's San Leun Triad to be married into a Yakuza family as a political marriage. At that wedding day at Japan, Ho-Nam met with Akira Kusakari ([[Roy Cheung]]), the Yakuza leader's adopted son. At the wedding venue, Hung Hing's attending members were met by Chicken's cousin and one of the district leader the Taiwanese gang San Leun, Koh Chi-Wah ([[Blackie Ko]]) who then introduced to the son of San Leun's dragonhead, Lui Fu-Kawn ([[Peter Ho]]) and after the meeting, the wedding start and ended in hilarity.\n\nAfter the wedding, Hung Hing's attending members like Ben-Hon ([[Wan Yeung-ming|Vincent Wan]]) and Sister 13 ([[Sandra Ng]]) followed Chi-Wah to a restaurant to celebrate. Out of happiness for his cousin and the recent victory of [[Chen Shui-bian]] as the new Taiwanese president, he over enthusiastically sang a Hokkien song which irate a bunch of Chinese nationals behind the group which soon turned into a brawl with the Chinese splashing tea on Chi-Wah. Chicken and Akira stopped the brawl in time and the next day, Chiang Tin-Yeung ([[Alex Man]]) finally met Ichio Kusakari ([[Sonny Chiba]]) and Ichio discussed about a tripartite alliance between them, Hung Hing and San Leun but Chiang announces his retirement to return to Thailand and declares that his position and all affairs of Hung Hing will be passed on to Ho-Nam. Hearing of Chiang's plans for retirement, Ichio too thought of retiring and leaving the business to the younger generation where he picked Chicken as his successor. After the meeting, Ichio praised Hung Hing's members for their strength and agility and curiously asked if they knew anything about Kendo. Chiang jokingly told Ichio that he may pass some knowledge to them where soon, a Kendo match was held and Ho-Nam took the plate and fought Ichio. Ichio managed to initially beat Ho-Nam by disarming him. Not be seen as a loser or a weakling, Ho-Nam used his countless battle skills on the streets of Hong Kong into good use by tying his weapon to his hand and fought mostly single-handedly as he is accustomed to and forced Ichio into a draw. Back in Taiwan, San Leun was also having a meeting to talk about the new leadership of the gang. Fu-Kwan denied the request to be the new dragonhead as his long period of stay in the US has made him unfamiliar with Taiwan despite being Taiwanese so Chi-Wah recommended Chicken due to his contribution to the gang but Chicken himself also denied the request as he had no ambitions to be the dragonhead and stated that \"Picking a dragonhead shouldn't be about his nationality or whether he's a Taiwanese or can he speak Min-Nan language but more of courage and tenacity\". Due to the constant rejection from another gang leader to appoint Chicken as the new suggested dragonhead, Chi-Wah again nearly came up to brawl with the other person. A few days later had passed and Fu-Kwan was met with an accident. As the dispute about the new San Leun's leadership contention wasn't settled, Chicken was instantly blamed for causing the crash but as he arrived at the hospital after receiving the news, he declared he's not the one to do it and Fu-Kwan believes him. Despite the infighting, Chicken was brought to a meeting with an old Taiwanese mafia boss who told the present that the situation is changing and the new government wants nothing but for the gangsters to cooperate with them. Chicken went to ask a veteran gang leader on his views. After that, both Chicken and Chi-Wah went to a karaoke lounge to have fun and a bunch of girls flirted with them. Suddenly, a girl that was on top of Chicken took out a dagger and tried to stab at Chicken, who saw the dagger, fought her off and both guys flee the lounge. Both fled towards a road but found both sides to be surrounded by gangsters of unknown origin and the two guys instantly fought their way out. However, Chi-Wah blocked the gangsters off for Chicken to run away only for him to be hit in the head and laying on the ground with Chicken fighting to get him out but failed and saw Chi-Wah being beaten to death while being extricated. At the same time, Nanako ([[Anya Wu]]), Chicken's wife, was alone at home and Akira came to visit drunk. While Nanako was taking care of him, he professed that he had always loved Nanako but it was his father's mistake to not let them be together and forcefully raped Nanako.\n\nWhile taking care of his still-shaken wife, Chicken's buddies, Ho-Nam and friends, came to Taiwan to find out what was happening. Knowing how the current politics is useless and in disarray and his support, Chi-Wah, dead, Ho-Nam declares his full support for Chicken together with Dai-Tau/Big Head ([[Chin Kar-Lok]]) and Pou-Pan ([[Jerry Lamb]]). However, Chicken told Ho-Nam not to worry as he'll settle his own issue and their arrival to support him had already made him happy. Ho-Nam then went to meet Mei Ling who was shopping. She's late due to buying a watch for Ho-Nam but with Ho-Nam passing the watch back to her, in a fit of anger, she storms off and at the corner of his eye, he saw a girl that looked very much like Smartie. Curious, he followed her to her workplace at an kindergarten and both had a chat and learnt that her name is Rong Yu and she's also from Hong Kong and both became friends. At the safehouse where Chicken was hiding, his underling noticed a bunch of cars approaching the house and in a panic, shouted that their under attack. Whilst preparing for an ambush, it turned out that the \"unknown personal\" was Ichio sitting on a wheelchair who came to look for Nanako and Chicken. After comforting Nanako, Ichio explained to Chicken that Akira was a traitor who sold the Yakuza's evil deeds to the police and Akira was the cause of his disability. Vowing for vengeance for both Ichio and Nanako, Chicken promises to kill Akira. At the meantime, Fu-Kwan was released from hospital and it was revealed that the assassination attempt on Chicken and Chi-Wah was all along orchestrated by Fu-Kwan to rid Chicken from San Leun. Ho-Nam then met with Fu-Kwan who questioned San Leun's internal conflict and their intentions on dealing with Chicken. Fu-Kwan, again lied and said that he had never doubted Chicken to be the one that caused him to be hospitalized but directly after Ho-Nam left the meeting, it was shown that both Akira and Fu-Kwan had always been working with each other in getting rid of Chicken. Ho-Nam then went to meet with Rong Yu and Mei Ling, who had always sensed that Ho-Nam was odd, followed him in the shadows and noticed both Rong Yu and Ho-Nam together. Mei Ling then followed Rong Yu back to the kindergarten where she voiced her displeasure about her relationship to Rong Yu.\n\nAt the funeral of another contender of the leadership of San Luen (The one that had bad blood and gave advice to Chicken earlier in the show), things escalate out of control when Chicken entered the funeral hall and the whole of San Luen mobbing him. To control the situation, Ho-Nam took out a pistol and fired warning shots in the air. At the same time, Ichio entered the hall and declared that till Chicken is deemed the traitor, his life will be in Ichio's hands and if Chicken is found guilty, he will end Chicken's life himself. After the funeral, Chicken and Hung Hing's other members discuss plans on crippling Fu-Kwan's rising power. Knowing that he's already aligned himself with the new government and had planned to rename San Leun something else, they estimated that attacking Fu-Kwan head-on will be suicidal due to his ties with the government. During Chen Shui-bian's inauguration day, Fu-Kwan gave a speech on his ambitions of incorporating all gangs in Taiwan into an umbrella cooperation and plans to combine both Chi-Wah's \"Black Panther Gang\" and Chicken's \"Venom Snake Gang\" into a new entity with Akira at the helm. Chicken and the whole of Hung Hing bursts into the arena and Chicken declared Fu-Kwan the betrayer of San Leun with a traitor spilling out that the assassinations that had happened were all plotted by Fu-Kwan. With his family in Hung Hing's hands (The ploy Hung Hing came out with to threaten Fu-Kwan's power), the strategist of the gang had no choice but to spill the beans that what Chicken and the traitor who accused Fu-Kwan was right as everything that's happening to San Leun was done by Fu-Kwan. Soon after, the official who negotiated with Fu-Kwan also declared that the deal between San Leun and the government is off due to the ridiculous request of Fu-Kwan. Sensing defeat, Fu-Kwan slowly backs away from the crowd only to pull a pistol and firing a few rounds before fleeing with Akira. Ho-Nam and the rest gave chase. Akira nearly escaped but only to land himself in a hall where Ichio was waiting with Chicken for him. Surrounded by both ends, Akira instantly acts pitiful and asks for forgiveness. However, Ichio was having none of it and threw Akira a [[Wakizashi]] to commit hara-riki but instead of using it on himself, he flipped the dagger towards Ichio only to be disarmed by Ichio himself and dropped the dagger. Chicken then promptly took the dagger and stabbed Akira to death. At the same time, Ho-Nam was still chasing Fu-Kwan and both of them were driving themselves into a head-on collision. Both were not injured and soon climbed on top of their cars and continued fighting. Ho-Nam beats him easily but Fu-Kwan again draws his pistol on Ho-Nam. Ho-Nam, having no fear, inches closer to Fu-Kwan's barrel and few seconds later, the police arrives to arrest Fu-Kwan.\n\nThe story ends with Ichio thanking the Taiwanese official for his assistance and revealed that Ichio himself can actually speak Mandrin all along.\n\n==Notes==\n* Notable absences: Tai Fei, Prince, Chan Yiu\n* Although they normally portrayed as Tai-tin Yee and Chow Pan/Banana Skin (who are the good guys) respectively, Michael Tse and Jason Chu took the roles as Lui Fu-kwan's henchmen, who were also named Michael and Jason respectively.\n* Roy Cheung makes his third appearance, this time as Akira Kusakari, a villain who was adopted by Ichio.\n* As Chicken marries Nanako in this movie, many fans who followed the series wondered whatever happened between Chicken and Wasabi (Karen Mok) because he proposed to her in ''[[Young and Dangerous 4]]''. As it was revealed in ''[[Those Were the Days...

When Chicken is set up, his old pals return to clear his name.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story starts with Chan Ho-Nam ([[Ekin Cheng]]) still being paranoid about the horrific death and his relationship with Smartie ([[Gigi Lai]]) which constantly gives him nightmares. After having Mei Ling ([[Shu Qi]]) hinting that she wants to get married to Ho-Nam, Ho-Nam shown little to no reaction due to the fear of losing another loved ones. That night, Ho-Nam goes to his pub only to be noticed that Chicken ([[Jordan Chan]]) was set up by Taiwan's San Leun Triad to be married into a Yakuza family as a political marriage. At that wedding day at Japan, Ho-Nam met with Akira Kusakari ([[Roy Cheung]]), the Yakuza leader's adopted son. At the wedding venue, Hung Hing's attending members were met by Chicken's cousin and one of the district leader the Taiwanese gang San Leun, Koh Chi-Wah ([[Blackie Ko]]) who then introduced to the son of San Leun's dragonhead, Lui Fu-Kawn ([[Peter Ho]]) and after the meeting, the wedding start and ended in hilarity.\n\nAfter the wedding, Hung Hing's attending members like Ben-Hon ([[Wan Yeung-ming|Vincent Wan]]) and Sister 13 ([[Sandra Ng]]) followed Chi-Wah to a restaurant to celebrate. Out of happiness for his cousin and the recent victory of [[Chen Shui-bian]] as the new Taiwanese president, he over enthusiastically sang a Hokkien song which irate a bunch of Chinese nationals behind the group which soon turned into a brawl with the Chinese splashing tea on Chi-Wah. Chicken and Akira stopped the brawl in time and the next day, Chiang Tin-Yeung ([[Alex Man]]) finally met Ichio Kusakari ([[Sonny Chiba]]) and Ichio discussed about a tripartite alliance between them, Hung Hing and San Leun but Chiang announces his retirement to return to Thailand and declares that his position and all affairs of Hung Hing will be passed on to Ho-Nam. Hearing of Chiang's plans for retirement, Ichio too thought of retiring and leaving the business to the younger generation where he picked Chicken as his successor. After the meeting, Ichio praised Hung Hing's members for their strength and agility and curiously asked if they knew anything about Kendo. Chiang jokingly told Ichio that he may pass some knowledge to them where soon, a Kendo match was held and Ho-Nam took the plate and fought Ichio. Ichio managed to initially beat Ho-Nam by disarming him. Not be seen as a loser or a weakling, Ho-Nam used his countless battle skills on the streets of Hong Kong into good use by tying his weapon to his hand and fought mostly singlehandedly like how he's used to and managed to force Ichio into a draw. Back in Taiwan, San Leun was also having a meeting to talk about the new leadership of the gang. Fu-Kwan denied the request to be the new dragonhead as his long period of stay in the US has made him unfamiliar with Taiwan despite being Taiwanese so Chi-Wah recommended Chicken due to his contribution to the gang but Chicken himself also denied the request as he had no ambitions to be the dragonhead and stated that \"Picking a dragonhead shouldn't be about his nationality or whether he's a Taiwanese or can he speak Min-Nan language but more of courage and tenacity\". Due to the constant rejection from another gang leader to appoint Chicken as the new suggested dragonhead, Chi-Wah again nearly came up to brawl with the other person. A few days later had passed and Fu-Kwan was met with an accident. As the dispute about the new San Leun's leadership contention wasn't settled, Chicken was instantly blamed for causing the crash but as he arrived at the hospital after receiving the news, he declared he's not the one to do it and Fu-Kwan believes him. Despite the infightings, Chicken was brought to a meeting with an old Taiwanese mafia boss who told the present that the situation is changing and the new government wants nothing but for the gangsters to cooperate with them. Chicken went to ask a veteran gang leader on his views. After that, both Chicken and Chi-Wah went to a karaoke lounge to have fun and a bunch of girls flirted with them. Suddenly, a girl that was on top of Chicken took out a dagger and tried to stab at Chicken, who saw the dagger, fought her off and both guys flee the lounge. Both fled towards a mainroad but found both sides to be surrounded by gangsters of unknown origin and the two guys instantly fought their way out. However, Chi-Wah blocked the gangsters off for Chicken to run away only for him to be hit in the head and laying on the ground with Chicken fighting to get him out but failed and saw Chi-Wah being beaten to death while being extricated. At the same time, Nanako ([[Anya Wu]]), Chicken's wife, was alone at home and Akira came to visit drunk. While Nanako was taking care of him, he professed that he had always loved Nanako but it was his father's mistake to not let them be together and forcefully raped Nanako.\n\nWhile taking care of his still-shaken wife, Chicken's buddies, Ho-Nam and friends, came to Taiwan to find out what was happening. Knowing how the current politics is useless and in disarray and his support, Chi-Wah, dead, Ho-Nam declares his full support for Chicken together with Dai-Tau/Big Head ([[Chin Kar-Lok]]) and Pou-Pan ([[Jerry Lamb]]). However, Chicken told Ho-Nam not to worry as he'll settle his own issue and their arrival to support him had already made him happy. Ho-Nam then went to meet Mei Ling who was shopping. She's late due to buying a watch for Ho-Nam but with Ho-Nam passing the watch back to her, in a fit of anger, she storms off and at the corner of his eye, he saw a girl that looked very much like Smartie. Curious, he followed her to her workplace at an kindergarten and both had a chat and learnt that her name is Rong Yu and she's also from Hong Kong and both became friends. At the safehouse where Chicken was hiding, his underling noticed a bunch of cars approaching the house and in a panic, shouted that their under attack. Whilst preparing for an ambush, it turned out that the \"unknown personal\" was Ichio sitting on a wheelchair who came to look for Nanako and Chicken. After comforting Nanako, Ichio explained to Chicken that Akira was a traitor who sold the Yakuza's evil deeds to the police and Akira was the cause of his disability. Vowing for vengeance for both Ichio and Nanako, Chicken promises to kill Akira. At the meantime, Fu-Kwan was released from hospital and it was revealed that the assassination attempt on Chicken and Chi-Wah was all along orchestrated by Fu-Kwan to rid Chicken from San Leun. Ho-Nam then met with Fu-Kwan who questioned San Leun's internal conflict and their intentions on dealing with Chicken. Fu-Kwan, again lied and said that he had never doubted Chicken to be the one that caused him to be hospitalized but directly after Ho-Nam left the meeting, it was shown that both Akira and Fu-Kwan had always been working with each other in getting rid of Chicken. Ho-Nam then went to meet with Rong Yu and Mei Ling, who had always sensed that Ho-Nam was odd, followed him in the shadows and noticed both Rong Yu and Ho-Nam together. Mei Ling then followed Rong Yu back to the kindergarten where she voiced her displeasure about her relationship to Rong Yu.\n\nAt the funeral of another contender of the leadership of San Luen (The one that had bad blood and gave advice to Chicken earlier in the show), things escalate out of control when Chicken entered the funeral hall and the whole of San Luen mobbing him. To control the situation, Ho-Nam took out a pistol and fired warning shots in the air. At the same time, Ichio entered the hall and declared that till Chicken is deemed the traitor, his life will be in Ichio's hands and if Chicken is found guilty, he will end Chicken's life himself. After the funeral, Chicken and Hung Hing's other members discuss plans on crippling Fu-Kwan's rising power. Knowing that he's already aligned himself with the new government and had planned to rename San Leun something else, they estimated that attacking Fu-Kwan head-on will be suicidal due to his ties with the government. During Chen Shui-bian's inauguration day, Fu-Kwan gave a speech on his ambitions of incorporating all gangs in Taiwan into an umbrella cooperation and plans to combine both Chi-Wah's \"Black Panther Gang\" and Chicken's \"Venom Snake Gang\" into a new entity with Akira at the helm. Chicken and the whole of Hung Hing bursts into the arena and Chicken declared Fu-Kwan the betrayer of San Leun with a traitor spilling out that the assassinations that had happened were all plotted by Fu-Kwan. With his family in Hung Hing's hands (The ploy Hung Hing came out with to threaten Fu-Kwan's power), the strategist of the gang had no choice but to spill the beans that what Chicken and the traitor who accused Fu-Kwan was right as everything that's happening to San Leun was done by Fu-Kwan. Soon after, the official who negotiated with Fu-Kwan also declared that the deal between San Leun and the government is off due to the ridiculous request of Fu-Kwan. Sensing defeat, Fu-Kwan slowly backs away from the crowd only to pull a pistol and firing a few rounds before fleeing with Akira. Ho-Nam and the rest gave chase. Akira nearly escaped but only to land himself in a hall where Ichio was waiting with Chicken for him. Surrounded by both ends, Akira instantly acts pitiful and asks for forgiveness. However, Ichio was having none of it and threw Akira a [[Wakizashi]] to commit hara-riki but instead of using it on himself, he flipped the dagger towards Ichio only to be disarmed by Ichio himself and dropped the dagger. Chicken then promptly took the dagger and stabbed Akira to death. At the same time, Ho-Nam was still chasing Fu-Kwan and both of them were driving themselves into a head-on collision. Both were not injured and soon climbed on top of their cars and continued fighting. Ho-Nam beats him easily but Fu-Kwan again draws his pistol on Ho-Nam. Ho-Nam, having no fear, inches closer to Fu-Kwan's barrel and few seconds later, the police arrives to arrest Fu-Kwan.\n\nThe story ends with Ichio thanking the Taiwanese official for his assistance and revealed that Ichio himself can actually speak Mandrin all along.\n\n==Notes==\n* Notable absences: Tai Fei, Prince, Chan Yiu\n* Although they normally portrayed as Tai-tin Yee and Chow Pan/Banana Skin (who are the good guys) respectively, Michael Tse and Jason Chu took the roles as Lui Fu-kwan's henchmen, who were also named Michael and Jason respectively.\n* Roy Cheung makes his third appearance, this time as Akira Kusakari, a villain who was adopted by Ichio.\n* As Chicken marries Nanako in this movie, many fans who followed the series wondered whatever happened between Chicken and Wasabi (Karen Mok) because he proposed to her in ''[[Young and Dangerous 4]]''. As it was revealed in ''[[Those Were the Days...

In [[geology]], a valley or '''[[Dale (origin)|dale]]''' is a [[Depression (geology)|depression]] that is longer than it is wide. The terms [[U-shaped valley|U-shaped]] and V-shaped are descriptive terms of [[geography]] to characterize the form of valleys. Most valleys belong to one of these two main types or a mixture of them, at least with respect to the [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of the slopes or hillsides.<ref>[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/earth/surface-of-the-earth/valleys/ Valleys on National Geographic]</ref>\n\n==Valley terminology==\nA valley in its broadest geographic sense is also known as a ''dale''. Other terms used for valleys are: \n\n* ''Vale'': A valley through which a river runs.\n* ''[[Dell (landform)|Dell]]'': A small, secluded and often wooded valley.\n* ''[[Glen]]'': A long valley bounded by gently sloped concave sides.\n* ''[[Strath]]'': A wide, flat valley through which a river runs.\n* [[Cove (Appalachian Mountains)|Mountain ''cove'']]: A small valley, closed at one or both ends, in the central or southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] which sometimes results from the erosion of a [[Cove (Appalachian Mountains)|geologic window]]. \n* ''Hollow'': A term used sometimes for a small valley surrounded by mountains or [[ridge]]s.\n* ''cwm'' (also spelled ''[[combe]]'' or ''coombe''): A deep, narrow valley.\n* A [[steephead valley]] is a deep, narrow, flat bottomed valley with an abrupt ending.\n* Erosional valley: A valley formed by [[erosion]].\n* Structural valley: A valley formed by geologic events such as drop faults or the rise of highlands.<ref name=NPS>{{cite web|title=Early History, Santa Clara County|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/santaclara/history.htm|website=National Park Service|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=January 16, 2015|quote=Santa Clara Valley is a structural valley, created by mountain building, as opposed to an erosional valley, or one which has undergone the wearing away of the earth's surface by natural agents.}}</ref>\n* [[Dry valley]]: A valley not created by sustained surface water flow.\n* [[Longitudinal valley]]: An elongated valley found between two almost parallel mountain chains.\n\nSimilar geological structures, such as [[canyon]]s, [[ravine]]s, gorges, [[gully|gullies]], [[chine]]s and [[kloof]]s, are not usually referred to as valleys.\n\n==River valleys {{anchor|River valleys}}== <!-- {R to section} redirect target, \"[[River valley]]\" -->\n{{for|a comprehensive list of river valleys|Category:River valleys}}\n{{further|River phenomenon}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\n[[File:Palakaria-and-Belchin-3.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Valley of Palakaria river springing from [[Vitosha]] Mountain, seen in the background, in [[Geography of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]]]\nA valley formed by [[River|flowing water]], called ''[[fluvial]] valley'' or ''river valley'', is usually V-shaped. The exact shape will depend on the characteristics of the stream flowing through it. Rivers with steep gradients, as in [[mountain range]]s, produce steep walls and a bottom. Shallower slopes may produce broader and gentler valleys. However, in the lowest stretch of a river, where it approaches its [[base level]], it begins to deposit sediment and the valley bottom becomes a [[floodplain]].\n\nSome broad ''V'' examples are:\n* [[North America]]: [[Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park]], and others in [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon NP]]\n* [[Europe]]:\n** Austria: narrow passages of upper [[Inn valley]] (Inntal), affluents of [[Enns River|Enns]]\n** Switzerland: [[Napf]] region, Zurich Oberland, [[Engadin]]\n** Germany: affluents to the middle reaches of [[Rhine]] and [[Moselle River|Mosel]]\n\nSome of the first human [[complex society|complex societies]] originated in river valleys, such as that of the [[Nile]], [[Tigris\u2013Euphrates river system|Tigris-Euphrates]], [[Indus]], [[Ganges]], [[Yangtze]], [[Yellow River]], [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], and arguably [[Amazon River|Amazon]]. In [[prehistory]], the rivers were used as a source of [[fresh water]] and food (fish and game), as well as a place to wash and a sewer. The proximity of water moderated [[temperature]] extremes and provided a source for [[irrigation]], stimulating the development of [[agriculture]]. Most of the [[cradle of civilization|first civilizations]] developed from these river valley communities.\n\n===Vales {{Anchor|Vale}}===\n\nIn [[geography]], a ''vale'' is a wide river valley, usually with a particularly wide [[flood plain]] or flat valley bottom.\n\nIn Southern England, vales commonly occur between the [[escarpment]] slopes of pairs of [[Southern England Chalk Formation|chalk formation]]s, where the chalk dome has been [[erosion|eroded]], exposing less [[Geological resistance|resistant]] underlying rock, usually [[claystone]]. An example is the [[Vale of White Horse]] in Oxfordshire.\n\n==Rift valleys==\n{{main article|Rift valley}}\n\nRift valleys, such as the [[Albertine Rift]] and [[Gregory Rift]] are formed by the expansion of the [[Earth]]'s crust due to [[Plate tectonics|tectonic]] activity beneath the Earth's surface.\n\n==Glacial valleys==\n[[File:Tal-y-llyn-valley-Dolgoch-01.jpg|thumb|U-shaped valley on the [[Afon Fathew]] near [[Dolgoch Falls|Dolgoch]], Wales]]\n[[File:YosemiteFromPlane.JPG|thumb|[[Yosemite Valley]] from an airplane]]\n[[File:Glacial Valley MtHoodWilderness.jpg|thumb|upright|A glaciated valley in the [[Mount Hood Wilderness]] showing a characteristic U-shape, the bottom's rocky 'rubble' accretion and the broad shoulders]]\nThere are various forms of valley associated with glaciation that may be referred to as glacial valleys.\n\n===U-shaped or trough valley===\n[[File:Pirin ezera Pano Chairski ezera.jpg|A panoramic view of two merging U-shaped valleys in [[Pirin]] mountain, [[Geography of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]|thumb]]\n{{main article|U-shaped valley}}\nA valley carved by [[glacier]]s is normally U-shaped and resembles a trough. This trough valley becomes visible upon the recession of the glacier that forms it. When the ice recedes or thaws, the valley remains, often littered with small boulders that were transported within the ice. Floor gradient does not affect the valley's shape, it is the glacier's size that does. Continuously flowing glaciers \u2013 especially in the [[ice age]] \u2013 and large-sized glaciers carve wide, deep incised valleys, sometimes with [[valley step]]s that reflect differing erosion rates.\n\nExamples of U-shaped valleys are found in every mountainous region that has experienced [[glaciation]], usually during the [[Pleistocene]] [[Ice Age|ice ages]].\nMost present U-shaped valleys started as V-shaped before glaciation. The glaciers carved it out wider and deeper, simultaneously changing the shape. This proceeds through the glacial erosion processes of glaciation and [[Abrasion (geology)|abrasion]], which results in large rocky material (glacial till) being carried in the glacier. A material called boulder clay is deposited on the floor of the valley. As the ice melts and retreats, the valley is left with very steep sides and a wide, flat floor. A [[river]] or [[stream]] may remain in the valley. This replaces the original stream or river and is known as a [[misfit stream]] because it is smaller than one would expect given the size of its valley.\n\nOther interesting glacially carved valleys include:\n* [[Yosemite Valley]] (United States)\n* [[Side valley]]s of the Austrian river [[Salzach]] for their parallel directions and hanging mouths.\n* Some Scottish glens full with bushes and flowers.\n* That of the [[St. Mary River (Montana-Alberta)|St. Mary River]] in [[Glacier National Park (United States)|Glacier National Park]] in [[Montana]], USA.\n\n===Tunnel valley===\n{{main article|Tunnel valley}}\nA tunnel valley is a large, long, U-shaped valley originally cut under the glacial ice near the margin of continental ice sheets such as that now covering Antarctica and formerly covering portions of all continents during past glacial ages.<ref name=J>{{Cite journal  | last =   J\u00f8rgensen | first =Flemming   | authorlink =   |author2=Peter B.E.

They served as subglacial drainage pathways carrying large volumes of melt water. Their cross-sections exhibit steep-sided flanks similar to fjord walls, and their flat bottoms are typical of subglacial glacial erosion.\n\n===Meltwater valley===\n{{main article|Urstromtal}}\nIn northern Central Europe, the Scandinavian ice sheet during the various ice ages advanced slightly uphill against the lie of the land. As a result, its meltwaters flowed parallel to the ice margin to reach the North Sea basin, forming huge, flat valleys known as ''[[Urstromt\u00e4ler]]''. Unlike the other forms of glacial valley, these were formed by glacial meltwaters.\n\n{{Wide image|Hooker Valley in Aoraki-Mount Cook National Park.jpg|1080px|New Zealand's Hooker Valley at [[Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park]], with [[Hooker Glacier (New Zealand)|Hooker Glacier]]'s terminus at [[Hooker Lake]] in the background}}\n\n==Transition forms and valley shoulders==\n[[File:Paria View at Bryce Canyon NP.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Look from Paria View to a valley in [[Bryce Canyon]], [[Utah]], with very striking shoulders]]\nDepending on the [[topography]], the [[rock type]]s and the [[climate]], a variety of transitional forms between V-, U- and plain valleys can form. Their bottoms can be broad or narrow, but characteristic is also the type of valley shoulder. The broader a mountain valley, the lower its shoulders are located in most cases. An important exception are canyons where the shoulder almost is near the top of the valley's slope. In the Alps \u2013 e.g. the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrolean]] [[Inn River|Inn]] valley \u2013 the shoulders are quite low (100\u2013200 meters above the bottom). Many villages are located here (esp. at the sunny side) because the climate is very mild: even in winter when the valley's floor is completely filled with fog, these villages are in [[Sunlight|sunshine]].\n\nIn some stress-tectonic regions of the [[Rocky mountains|Rockies]] or the Alps (e.g. [[Salzburg]]) the [[side valley]]s are parallel to each other, and additionally they are [[hanging valleys|hanging]]. The brooks flow into the river in form of deep canyons or [[waterfall]]s. Usually this fact is the result of a violent erosion of the former valley shoulders, a special genesis found also at [[ar\u00eate]]s and glacial [[cirque]]s, at every Scottish glen, or in a northern [[fjord]].\n\n==Hanging valleys==\n[[File:Closeup of Bridalveil Fall seen from Tunnel View in Yosemite NP.JPG|thumb|upright|Bridal Veil Falls in [[Yosemite National Park]] flowing from a hanging valley.]]\n[[File:\u0418\u0431\u044a\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e \u0435\u0437\u0435\u0440\u043e.jpg|thumb|Hanging valley, [[Ibar (river)]] valley, [[Rila]] Mountain, [[Bulgaria]]]]\n\nA hanging valley is a [[tributary]] valley that is higher than the main valley. They are most commonly associated with U-shaped valleys when a tributary glacier flows into a glacier of larger volume. The main glacier erodes a deep U-shaped valley with nearly vertical sides while the tributary glacier, with a smaller volume of ice, makes a shallower U-shaped valley. Since the surfaces of the glaciers were originally at the same [[elevation]], the shallower valley appears to be 'hanging' above the main valley. Often, waterfalls form at or near the outlet of the upper valley.<ref>{{cite web| title =Glossary of Glacier Terminology| work =| publisher =U.S. Geological Survey| date =May 28, 2004| url =http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1216/h/h.html| accessdate = 2007-05-24 }}</ref>\n\nHanging valleys also occur in fjord systems under water. The branches of [[Sognefjord]] are for instance much shallower than the main fjord. The mouth of [[Fj\u00e6rlandsfjord]] is about 400 meters deep while the main fjord is 1200 meters nearby. The mouth of [[Ikjefjord]] is only 50 meters deep while the main fjord is around 1300 meters at the same point.<ref>Nesje, A., & Whillans, I. M. (1994). Erosion of Sognefjord, Norway.

The exact shape will depend on the characteristics of the stream flowing through it. Rivers with steep gradients, as in [[mountain range]]s, produce steep walls and a bottom. Shallower slopes may produce broader and gentler valleys. However, in the lowest stretch of a river, where it approaches its [[base level]], it begins to deposit sediment and the valley bottom becomes a [[floodplain]].\n\nSome broad ''V'' examples are:\n* [[North America]]: [[Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park]], and others in [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon NP]]\n* [[Europe]]:\n** Austria: narrow passages of upper [[Inn valley]] (Inntal), affluents of [[Enns River|Enns]]\n** Switzerland: [[Napf]] region, Zurich Oberland, [[Engadin]]\n** Germany: affluents to the middle reaches of [[Rhine]] and [[Moselle River|Mosel]]\n\nSome of the first human [[complex society|complex societies]] originated in river valleys, such as that of the [[Nile]], [[Tigris\u2013Euphrates river system|Tigris-Euphrates]], [[Indus]], [[Ganges]], [[Yangtze]], [[Yellow River]], [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], and arguably [[Amazon River|Amazon]]. In [[prehistory]], the rivers were used as a source of [[fresh water]] and food (fish and game), as well as a place to wash and a sewer. The proximity of water moderated [[temperature]] extremes and provided a source for [[irrigation]], stimulating the development of [[agriculture]]. Most of the [[cradle of civilization|first civilizations]] developed from these river valley communities.\n\n===Vales {{Anchor|Vale}}===\n\nIn [[geography]], a ''vale'' is a wide river valley, usually with a particularly wide [[flood plain]] or flat valley bottom.\n\nIn Southern England, vales commonly occur between the [[escarpment]] slopes of pairs of [[Southern England Chalk Formation|chalk formation]]s, where the chalk dome has been [[erosion|eroded]], exposing less [[Geological resistance|resistant]] underlying rock, usually [[claystone]].\n\n==Rift valleys==\n{{main article|Rift valley}}\n\nRift valleys, such as the [[Albertine Rift]] and [[Gregory Rift]] are formed by the expansion of the [[Earth]]'s crust due to [[Plate tectonics|tectonic]] activity beneath the Earth's surface.\n\n==Glacial valleys==\n[[File:Tal-y-llyn-valley-Dolgoch-01.jpg|thumb|U-shaped valley on the [[Afon Fathew]] near [[Dolgoch Falls|Dolgoch]], Wales]]\n[[File:YosemiteFromPlane.JPG|thumb|[[Yosemite Valley]] from an airplane]]\n[[File:Glacial Valley MtHoodWilderness.jpg|thumb|upright|A glaciated valley in the [[Mount Hood Wilderness]] showing a characteristic U-shape, the bottom's rocky 'rubble' accretion and the broad shoulders]]\nThere are various forms of valley associated with glaciation that may be referred to as glacial valleys.\n\n===U-shaped or trough valley===\n[[File:Pirin ezera Pano Chairski ezera.jpg|A panoramic view of two merging U-shaped valleys in [[Pirin]] mountain, [[Geography of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]|thumb]]\n{{main article|U-shaped valley}}\nA valley carved by [[glacier]]s is normally U-shaped and resembles a trough. This trough valley becomes visible upon the recession of the glacier that forms it. When the ice recedes or thaws, the valley remains, often littered with small boulders that were transported within the ice. Floor gradient does not affect the valley's shape, it is the glacier's size that does. Continuously flowing glaciers \u2013 especially in the [[ice age]] \u2013 and large-sized glaciers carve wide, deep incised valleys, sometimes with [[valley step]]s that reflect differing erosion rates.\n\nExamples of U-shaped valleys are found in every mountainous region that has experienced [[glaciation]], usually during the [[Pleistocene]] [[Ice Age|ice ages]].\nMost present U-shaped valleys started as V-shaped before glaciation. The glaciers carved it out wider and deeper, simultaneously changing the shape. This proceeds through the glacial erosion processes of glaciation and [[Abrasion (geology)|abrasion]], which results in large rocky material (glacial till) being carried in the glacier. A material called boulder clay is deposited on the floor of the valley. As the ice melts and retreats, the valley is left with very steep sides and a wide, flat floor. A [[river]] or [[stream]] may remain in the valley. This replaces the original stream or river and is known as a [[misfit stream]] because it is smaller than one would expect given the size of its valley.\n\nOther interesting glacially carved valleys include:\n* [[Yosemite Valley]] (United States)\n* [[Side valley]]s of the Austrian river [[Salzach]] for their parallel directions and hanging mouths.\n* Some Scottish glens full with bushes and flowers.\n* That of the [[St. Mary River (Montana-Alberta)|St. Mary River]] in [[Glacier National Park (United States)|Glacier National Park]] in [[Montana]], USA.\n\n===Tunnel valley===\n{{main article|Tunnel valley}}\nA tunnel valley is a large, long, U-shaped valley originally cut under the glacial ice near the margin of continental ice sheets such as that now covering Antarctica and formerly covering portions of all continents during past glacial ages.<ref name=J>{{Cite journal  | last =   J\u00f8rgensen | first =Flemming   | authorlink =   |author2=Peter B.E.

They served as subglacial drainage pathways carrying large volumes of melt water. Their cross-sections exhibit steep-sided flanks similar to fjord walls, and their flat bottoms are typical of subglacial glacial erosion.\n\n===Meltwater valley===\n{{main article|Urstromtal}}\nIn northern Central Europe, the Scandinavian ice sheet during the various ice ages advanced slightly uphill against the lie of the land. As a result, its meltwaters flowed parallel to the ice margin to reach the North Sea basin, forming huge, flat valleys known as ''[[Urstromt\u00e4ler]]''. Unlike the other forms of glacial valley, these were formed by glacial meltwaters.\n\n{{Wide image|Hooker Valley in Aoraki-Mount Cook National Park.jpg|1080px|New Zealand's Hooker Valley at [[Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park]], with [[Hooker Glacier (New Zealand)|Hooker Glacier]]'s terminus at [[Hooker Lake]] in the background}}\n\n==Transition forms and valley shoulders==\n[[File:Paria View at Bryce Canyon NP.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Look from Paria View to a valley in [[Bryce Canyon]], [[Utah]], with very striking shoulders]]\nDepending on the [[topography]], the [[rock type]]s and the [[climate]], a variety of transitional forms between V-, U- and plain valleys can form. Their bottoms can be broad or narrow, but characteristic is also the type of valley shoulder. The broader a mountain valley, the lower its shoulders are located in most cases. An important exception are canyons where the shoulder almost is near the top of the valley's slope. In the Alps \u2013 e.g. the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrolean]] [[Inn River|Inn]] valley \u2013 the shoulders are quite low (100\u2013200 meters above the bottom). Many villages are located here (esp. at the sunny side) because the climate is very mild: even in winter when the valley's floor is completely filled with fog, these villages are in [[Sunlight|sunshine]].\n\nIn some stress-tectonic regions of the [[Rocky mountains|Rockies]] or the Alps (e.g. [[Salzburg]]) the [[side valley]]s are parallel to each other, and additionally they are [[hanging valleys|hanging]]. The brooks flow into the river in form of deep canyons or [[waterfall]]s. Usually this fact is the result of a violent erosion of the former valley shoulders, a special genesis found also at [[ar\u00eate]]s and glacial [[cirque]]s, at every Scottish glen, or in a northern [[fjord]].\n\n==Hanging valleys==\n[[File:Closeup of Bridalveil Fall seen from Tunnel View in Yosemite NP.JPG|thumb|upright|Bridal Veil Falls in [[Yosemite National Park]] flowing from a hanging valley.]]\n[[File:\u0418\u0431\u044a\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e \u0435\u0437\u0435\u0440\u043e.jpg|thumb|Hanging valley, [[Ibar (river)]] valley, [[Rila]] Mountain, [[Bulgaria]]]]\n\nA hanging valley is a [[tributary]] valley that is higher than the main valley. They are most commonly associated with U-shaped valleys when a tributary glacier flows into a glacier of larger volume. The main glacier erodes a deep U-shaped valley with nearly vertical sides while the tributary glacier, with a smaller volume of ice, makes a shallower U-shaped valley. Since the surfaces of the glaciers were originally at the same [[elevation]], the shallower valley appears to be 'hanging' above the main valley. Often, waterfalls form at or near the outlet of the upper valley.<ref>{{cite web| title =Glossary of Glacier Terminology| work =| publisher =U.S. Geological Survey| date =May 28, 2004| url =http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1216/h/h.html| accessdate = 2007-05-24 }}</ref>\n\nHanging valleys also occur in fjord systems under water. The branches of [[Sognefjord]] are for instance much shallower than the main fjord. The mouth of [[Fj\u00e6rlandsfjord]] is about 400 meters deep while the main fjord is 1200 meters nearby.

The region of North Karnataka was more under so-called Elephant, Lion, Horse and Bull Maharatis.  Again, later Shatavahana branch and Later Kuras moved southward to establish only in Banavasi. The region of Dakshina Kannada (modern Udupi and Mangalore district) was free from any such an external influence and appears to have been under the strict control of Alupa kings in the ancient times.\n\nThe rule over Uttara Kannada region, with Banavasi as its capital was by [[Chutu]] clan followed by the [[Shatavahana]] branch which governed for Siri, Siva, Pulumavi and Yajna Satakarnis, prior to the Kadambas. With the Kadambas rule from Banavasi, Karnataka saw developments in the field of art and culture. Land of Karnataka saw more and more epigraphs that recorded the activities of the past, mostly erected in the temple premises. The first clear mention of Alupas comes from the [[Halmidi]] inscription of 450 CE where their possible early ruler Pashupathi of Alapa (Alupa) gana is mentioned. Pashupathi was the contemporary of the Kadambas. Hence for historical record, we can safely assume that the dynastic formation of Alupas took place around 5th century CE. Their royal emblem was the double fish and they claimed to belong to the ''Pandyavamsha'' and ''Soma Kula'' (lunar).<ref name=\"kula\">Kamath (2001), p94</ref> Their coins carried the dynastic title \"Sri Pandya Dhananjaya\" which means \"Arjuna among the Pandyas\".\n\n==Land==\n[[File:Tulunadu.png|thumb| A Regional Map of Tulunadu in [[Karnataka]].Tulunadu also Includes [[Kasaragod district]] of [[Kerala]] state.|left]]\nAlthough Alupas controlled part of Uttara Kannada and Shimoga of Karnataka and northern part of Kerala during the zenith, the core region consisted of the modern Tulunadu which comprises Mangalore and Udupi district (earlier it used to be a single district ''Dakshina Kannada'', also known as South Canara.  In the ancient times, the region was referred as ''Alvakheda'' and during the later part of the reign, the region was referred as ''Tulunadu''. The term Tulunadu is still practised today while referring to the region.\n\n'''1. Alvakheda'''<br />\nThe term Alvakheda could be seen in several of ancient inscriptions of the Alupas. The region of Alvakheda encompassed the modern Tulunadu and part of Uttara Kannada up to Ankola on the coastal north and Banavasi on the interior west of Uttara Kannada District. Also, the region of Humcha in the Shimoga district, and the land of Kasaragod in Kerala up to the Payasvini river was the boundary in the south. The term Alvakheda is not seen in the inscriptions during the Vijayanagara period, when the region of Barakuru and Mangalore were two separate provinces under the administration of Governors who started controlling the territory without interfering in the autonomy of the Alupas.\n\n'''2. Tulunadu'''<br />\nThe region stretches from Mangalore in the south all the way to Baindoor in the north. On the west is the Arabian sea and on the east is the Western Ghat that fences the land like a fort that formed a heaven for the ruler. More than it, number of rivers that crisscrossed near Mangalore, Udyavara and Barkur made this land fertile. The western ghats, the thick forests and the towns along the shoreline of Arabian sea established several sea ports for trade with the Romans and Arabs.  Trade routes from with the Romans were well established as early as the 2nd century CE and with the Arabs around 7th century CE. The Netravati in Mangalore and Seethanadi in Barakur are the main rivers that run in the capital cities of Alupas.  Other rivers such as Suvarnanadi, Shambhavi in Karkala and Mulki, Gurupura river, Pavanje, Nandini and numerous streams all running from east to west.  The region of Puttur, Sullia, Belthangady and Puttur, Karkala are the Malnad region and supported as an agricultural backbone of the kingdom and the region of Mangalore, Udupi and Kundapur are the coastal regions that supported more of marine activities though agriculture is the other occupation.\n\nAn old Malayalam inscription ([[Ramanthali inscriptions]]), dated to 1075 CE, mentioning king Kunda Alupa, can be found at Ramanthali near [[Kannur|Cannanore]], Kerala. <ref>Narayanan, M. G. S. ''Perum\u0101\u1e37s of Kerala.'' Thrissur (Kerala): CosmoBooks, 2013. 483.</ref>\n\n==Political history==\nThe history of clan emerges from obscurity during the rise of [[Badami]] [[Chalukya]] in the Aihole and Mahakuta inscriptions which claims the Alupas had accepted Chalukya overlordship and become their feudatory.<ref name=\"kula\"/> They ruled initially from [[Mangalore]] and other times from Udyavara in [[Udupi]] and later [[Barkur]]. Their first regular full-length inscription is the ''Vaddarase'' inscription in Kannada is dated to early 7th century. They maintained marital relations with their overlords over the centuries.<ref name=\"oldest\">Kamath (2001), p97</ref>\n\nAlupas rule confined to the modern districts of Udupi, Mangalore and parts of Shimoga and Uttara Kannada districts in the state of Karanataka and part of northern Kerala (Kasaragod district) up to Payashvini river. In the history of India, no other single dynasty has ever ruled for over thousands years. The record that breaks this exception goes to the Alupas who ruled their territory for nearly thousand years.  Alupas though originated as a ruler to the coastal region of Karnataka around the beginning of the Christian era, it is only around the 5th century they made their debut as a dynasty as witnessed in the epigraph of Halmidi. The last ruler's name that we see in the epigraph of Venupura (Moodubidre), belong to the 14th century CE. There are over two hundred stone epigraphs left behind this dynasty and only about one hundred and twenty epigraphs have been read and deciphered so far. The finest record of the early Kannada script is seen in the 7th-century CE copper plate of Belmannu.  There is yet another set of five copper plates that surfaced in the beginning of 2007, but no information is known about the ruler, provenance within the district of Udupi or its content.\n\nAlupas put coins into circulation in 8th century CE and continued the tradition till 14th century CE. Their coins carried the dynastic emblem of \"Two fishes over a spread Lotus flower, below a royal umbrella\". Nearly 180 unique coins have been known so far, of which around 175 coins are published in the book written by Prabhu and Pai. The detailed history, with proper reference pointers is also seen in the same book.\n\n==Epigraphs==\n[[File:M Govinda Pai Regional Research Centre Udupi 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright|300px|The Vaddarse Old Kannada inscription (650 AD) of King Aluvarasa I]]\n\nThe earliest known [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copper plate inscription]] in Kannada language is attributed to Aluvarasa II, called the Belamannu plates and is dated the early 8th century, according to Dr. Gururaj Bhat.<ref name=\"oldest\"/> This full-length Kannada copper plates in Old Kannada script (early 8th century CE) belongs to the Alupa King Aluvarasa II from Belmannu, Karkala Taluk, Udupi District, and displays the double crested fish, the royal emblem of Alupa kings.

The temple has several finest bronze statues installed by the King Kundavarma, which bears inscriptions of him dated 968 CE. In the inscription of Lokeshwara statue, king Kundavarma is compared to Arjuna in bravery.\n\n3. '''Sri Mahishamardini Temple, Neelavara'''<br />\nIn times, Alupas changed their capital from Mangalore to Udyavara, Udyavara to Mangalore and then again to Barkur depending on the political situation and demand. To be in centre to their ruling place, they even shifted their capital to Barakur from where they could look after the vast territory which spread up to Ankola in the North Kanara (Uttara Kannada District).  During this period, they patronised several temples in the surrounding areas of Barakuru (which was their captiral). Neelavara Kshetra is one such a holy place where Mahishasuramardini temple has several Alupa inscriptions of later period.\n\n4. '''Sri Panchalingeshwara Temple, Vittla'''<br />\nThis temple is one of the oldest temple of Alupa territory, built during 7th century CE. The architecture of the temple is in line with that of Sri Ananteshwara temple which is the oldest temple built by the Alupas. The architecture is unique and is an innovation of 7th century. The Havyakha Brahmins of Uttara Kannada were attracted during 7th century CE by the Alupas and were given Agraharas for imparting Vedic knowledge to the people of Alvakheda.  The Alupas built many temples and allowed these Brahmins to take care of it. The legend says that there were hundreds of temples that every day there is a festival in one or other temple of the region.  The temple of Vittla Panchalingeshwara is one of the oldest structure which was renovated by the later local dynasties such as Heggades.\n\n5. '''Sri Anantheshwara Temple, Udupi'''<br />\nDiagonally opposite to the main entrance of the Sri Krishna Mutt, and adjacent to the Chandramouleeshwara Temple, stands one of the oldest Alupa temple namely '''''[[Udupi Anantheshwara Temple|Sri Anantheswara Temple]]'''''.  An old belief is that lighting a lamp at the ancient Anantheshwara Temple takes away evil and sins. It is one of the biggest temple in Udupi. The main idol is Linga, whose adornment makes it to look like a Face of Lord Siva. From a small window on the left, the site where Madhvacharya disappeared is seen.\n\nBoth Sri Vittla Panchalingeshwara and Sri Udupi Anantheshwara Temple have Elephant-back type curvilinear structure. Another temple of similar architecture is also seen in Aihole Durga temple, appears to be a structure of 7th century CE. So, tagging it to any architectural style is ruled out unless more detailed study or research is done on this topic. The unique noteworthy feature of the architecture of South Canara temples is their roof.  Being in a landscape of high rainfall, the temple roofs evolved from grass, clay tiles and eventually with the copper-plates.\n\n==Coinage==\nThe Alupas as a feudatory of the [[Western Chalukyas]] in coastal Karnataka issued coins with [[Kannada]] and [[Devanagari|Nagari]] inscriptions on them. Coins with Kannada legends seem to have minted in Mangalore and those with Nagari legend at the Udupi mint. Kannada was their language of administration. The Pagodas and Fanams were the common coinage of all the Alupa kings.  The obverse of the coins carried the royal emblem \"Two Fishes\" and the reverse had the legend \"Sri Pandya Dhanamjaya\"  either in Nagari or old (Hale) Kannada.<ref name=\"oldest\"/>\n\nThis paragraph is about the inscription found at Neelavara temple of Udupi district. This is all about the grant in \"Gadyana\" denomination. The Alupas while ruling from Barakuru showed great interest in the development of temple. This record is of the Alupa ruler Veerapandyadeva, dated 1258 CE mentions about his instruction to \"neeruvara munnuru\" i.e. Neeruvara-300, the modern Neelavara village Assembly. It states that after paying 100 gadyanas (coins) to the palace and 30 gadyanas to Adhikari, remaining 30 gadyanas, should be used by the village assembly for its expense. Yet another inscription of Veerapandyadeva's queen Ballamahadevi, the next ruler is also seen here. The record mentions that when Ballamahadevi was ruling her kingdom with the help of samastapradanas, Deshi purushas, Bahattara niyogis and Rishi Purohita, she gave a grant to Niruvara Bhagavati, out of 100 honnus that is paid to the palace. This inscription was written by Keshava Senabhova as mentioned in the epigraph.\n\nThe Alupas were one of the three dynasties that issued gold coins as early as 8th century CE. The gold that used to mint coins came from trade with the Romans, Arabs and from the adjacent kingdom of Gangas. No other ancient dynasties of the south have issued that many varieties of gold coins as Alupas and Gangas did.  The coins of both Gangas and Alupas have inscriptions that helps in dating the period of issue. Unfortunately these coins have not drawn much attention compared to that of Chalukyas or Hoysals. But for sure, they have inspired later dynasties as a prototype or basis to issue coins.  Shown below is the hand-drawing of some of the Pandya Gadyanas (Alupa coins) obverse image.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Dr. Suryanath U.

The region of North Karnataka was more under so-called Elephant, Lion, Horse and Bull Maharatis.  Again, later Shatavahana branch and Later Kuras moved southward to establish only in Banavasi. The region of Dakshina Kannada (modern Udupi and Mangalore district) was free from any such an external influence and appears to have been under the strict control of Alupa kings in the ancient times.\n\nThe rule over Uttara Kannada region, with Banavasi as its capital was by [[Chutu]] clan followed by the [[Shatavahana]] branch which governed for Siri, Siva, Pulumavi and Yajna Satakarnis, prior to the Kadambas. With the Kadambas rule from Banavasi, Karnataka saw developments in the field of art and culture. Land of Karnataka saw more and more epigraphs that recorded the activities of the past, mostly erected in the temple premises. The first clear mention of Alupas comes from the [[Halmidi]] inscription of 450 CE where their possible early ruler Pashupathi of Alapa (Alupa) gana is mentioned. Pashupathi was the contemporary of the Kadambas. Hence for historical record, we can safely assume that the dynastic formation of Alupas took place around 5th century CE. Their royal emblem was the double fish and they claimed to belong to the ''Pandyavamsha'' and ''Soma Kula'' (lunar).<ref name=\"kula\">Kamath (2001), p94</ref> Their coins carried the dynastic title \"Sri Pandya Dhananjaya\" which means \"Arjuna among the Pandyas\".\n\n==Land==\n[[File:Tulunadu.png|thumb| A Regional Map of Tulunadu in [[Karnataka]].Tulunadu also Includes [[Kasaragod district]] of [[Kerala]] state.|left]]\nAlthough Alupas controlled part of Uttara Kannada and Shimoga of Karnataka and northern part of Kerala during the zenith, the core region consisted of the modern Tulunadu which comprises Mangalore and Udupi district (earlier it used to be a single district ''Dakshina Kannada'', also known as South Canara.  In the ancient times, the region was referred as ''Alvakheda'' and during the later part of the reign, the region was referred as ''Tulunadu''. The term Tulunadu is still practised today while referring to the region.\n\n'''1. Alvakheda'''<br />\nThe term Alvakheda could be seen in several of ancient inscriptions of the Alupas. The region of Alvakheda encompassed the modern Tulunadu and part of Uttara Kannada up to Ankola on the coastal north and Banavasi on the interior west of Uttara Kannada District. Also, the region of Humcha in the Shimoga district, and the land of Kasaragod in Kerala up to the Payasvini river was the boundary in the south. The term Alvakheda is not seen in the inscriptions during the Vijayanagara period, when the region of Barakuru and Mangalore were two separate provinces under the administration of Governors who started controlling the territory without interfering in the autonomy of the Alupas.\n\n'''2. Tulunadu'''<br />\nThe region stretches from Mangalore in the south all the way to Baindoor in the north. On the west is the Arabian sea and on the east is the Western Ghat that fences the land like a fort that formed a heaven for the ruler. More than it, number of rivers that crisscrossed near Mangalore, Udyavara and Barkur made this land fertile. The western ghats, the thick forests and the towns along the shoreline of Arabian sea established several sea ports for trade with the Romans and Arabs.  Trade routes from with the Romans were well established as early as the 2nd century CE and with the Arabs around 7th century CE. The Netravati in Mangalore and Seethanadi in Barakur are the main rivers that run in the capital cities of Alupas.  Other rivers such as Suvarnanadi, Shambhavi in Karkala and Mulki, Gurupura river, Pavanje, Nandini and numerous streams all running from east to west.  The region of Puttur, Sullia, Belthangady and Puttur, Karkala are the Malnad region and supported as an agricultural backbone of the kingdom and the region of Mangalore, Udupi and Kundapur are the coastal regions that supported more of marine activities though agriculture is the other occupation.\n\nAn old Malayalam inscription ([[Ramanthali inscriptions]]), dated to 1075 CE, mentioning king Kunda Alupa, can be found at Ramanthali near [[Kannur|Cannanore]], Kerala. <ref>Narayanan, M. G. S. ''Perum\u0101\u1e37s of Kerala.'' Thrissur (Kerala): CosmoBooks, 2013. 483.</ref>\n\n==Political history==\nThe history of clan emerges from obscurity during the rise of [[Badami]] [[Chalukya]] in the Aihole and Mahakuta inscriptions which claims the Alupas had accepted Chalukya overlordship and become their feudatory.<ref name=\"kula\"/> They ruled initially from [[Mangalore]] and other times from Udyavara in [[Udupi]] and later [[Barkur]]. Their first regular full-length inscription is the ''Vaddarase'' inscription in Kannada is dated to early 7th century. They maintained marital relations with their overlords over the centuries.<ref name=\"oldest\">Kamath (2001), p97</ref>\n\nAlupas rule confined to the modern districts of Udupi, Mangalore and parts of Shimoga and Uttara Kannada districts in the state of Karanataka and part of northern Kerala (Kasaragod district) up to Payashvini river. In the history of India, no other single dynasty has ever ruled for over thousands years. The record that breaks this exception goes to the Alupas who ruled their territory for nearly thousand years.  Alupas though originated as a ruler to the coastal region of Karnataka around the beginning of the Christian era, it is only around the 5th century they made their debut as a dynasty as witnessed in the epigraph of Halmidi. The last ruler's name that we see in the epigraph of Venupura (Moodubidre), belong to the 14th century CE. There are over two hundred stone epigraphs left behind this dynasty and only about one hundred and twenty epigraphs have been read and deciphered so far. The finest record of the early Kannada script is seen in the 7th-century CE copper plate of Belmannu.  There is yet another set of five copper plates that surfaced in the beginning of 2007, but no information is known about the ruler, provenance within the district of Udupi or its content.\n\nAlupas put coins into circulation in 8th century CE and continued the tradition till 14th century CE. Their coins carried the dynastic emblem of \"Two fishes over a spread Lotus flower, below a royal umbrella\". Nearly 180 unique coins have been known so far, of which around 175 coins are published in the book written by Prabhu and Pai. The detailed history, with proper reference pointers is also seen in the same book.\n\n==Epigraphs==\n[[File:M Govinda Pai Regional Research Centre Udupi 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright|300px|The Vaddarse Old Kannada inscription (650 AD) of King Aluvarasa I]]\n\nThe earliest known [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copper plate inscription]] in Kannada language is attributed to Aluvarasa II, called the Belamannu plates and is dated the early 8th century, according to Dr. Gururaj Bhat.<ref name=\"oldest\"/> This full-length Kannada copper plates in Old Kannada script (early 8th century CE) belongs to the Alupa King Aluvarasa II from Belmannu, Karkala Taluk, Udupi District, and displays the double crested fish, the royal emblem of Alupa kings.

The Panchalingeshwara temple at Barkur, Brahmalingeshwara temple at Brahamavar, Koteshwara temple at Kotinatha and the Sadashiva temple at Suratkal are attributed to them. They used sculptural styles from their various overlords over the centuries.<ref name=\"oldest\"/>\n\n1. '''Sri Rajarajeshwari Temple, Polali'''\n[[File:Polali Shri Rajarajeshwari.jpg|thumb| Clay [[Murti]] of the Goddess Rajarajeshwari at the temple patronized by the Alupas]]\nIn modern Mangalore District, [[Polali Rajarajeshwari Temple]] is one of the oldest temple that has the earliest inscription of the Alupa dynasty, written in 8th-century Kannada. The temple is dedicated to Sri Rajarashewari, and Alupa kings enriched this temple during throughout their rule.\n\n2. '''Sri Manjunatheshwara Temple, Kadri'''\n[[File:Kadri temple.JPG|thumb|The Kadri Manjunath temple was built and patronized by the Alupas]]\nIn modern Mangalore district, Kadri has the other important and old temple that belonged to the era of Alupas. The temple has several finest bronze statues installed by the King Kundavarma, which bears inscriptions of him dated 968 CE. In the inscription of Lokeshwara statue, king Kundavarma is compared to Arjuna in bravery.\n\n3. '''Sri Mahishamardini Temple, Neelavara'''<br />\nIn times, Alupas changed their capital from Mangalore to Udyavara, Udyavara to Mangalore and then again to Barkur depending on the political situation and demand. To be in centre to their ruling place, they even shifted their capital to Barakur from where they could look after the vast territory which spread up to Ankola in the North Kanara (Uttara Kannada District).  During this period, they patronised several temples in the surrounding areas of Barakuru (which was their captiral). Neelavara Kshetra is one such a holy place where Mahishasuramardini temple has several Alupa inscriptions of later period.\n\n4. '''Sri Panchalingeshwara Temple, Vittla'''<br />\nThis temple is one of the oldest temple of Alupa territory, built during 7th century CE. The architecture of the temple is in line with that of Sri Ananteshwara temple which is the oldest temple built by the Alupas. The architecture is unique and is an innovation of 7th century. The Havyakha Brahmins of Uttara Kannada were attracted during 7th century CE by the Alupas and were given Agraharas for imparting Vedic knowledge to the people of Alvakheda.  The Alupas built many temples and allowed these Brahmins to take care of it. The legend says that there were hundreds of temples that every day there is a festival in one or other temple of the region.  The temple of Vittla Panchalingeshwara is one of the oldest structure which was renovated by the later local dynasties such as Heggades.\n\n5. '''Sri Anantheshwara Temple, Udupi'''<br />\nDiagonally opposite to the main entrance of the Sri Krishna Mutt, and adjacent to the Chandramouleeshwara Temple, stands one of the oldest Alupa temple namely '''''[[Udupi Anantheshwara Temple|Sri Anantheswara Temple]]'''''.  An old belief is that lighting a lamp at the ancient Anantheshwara Temple takes away evil and sins. It is one of the biggest temple in Udupi. The main idol is Linga, whose adornment makes it to look like a Face of Lord Siva. From a small window on the left, the site where Madhvacharya disappeared is seen.\n\nBoth Sri Vittla Panchalingeshwara and Sri Udupi Anantheshwara Temple have Elephant-back type curvilinear structure. Another temple of similar architecture is also seen in Aihole Durga temple, appears to be a structure of 7th century CE. So, tagging it to any architectural style is ruled out unless more detailed study or research is done on this topic. The unique noteworthy feature of the architecture of South Canara temples is their roof.  Being in a landscape of high rainfall, the temple roofs evolved from grass, clay tiles and eventually with the copper-plates.\n\n==Coinage==\nThe Alupas as a feudatory of the [[Western Chalukyas]] in coastal Karnataka issued coins with [[Kannada]] and [[Devanagari|Nagari]] inscriptions on them. Coins with Kannada legends seem to have minted in Mangalore and those with Nagari legend at the Udupi mint. Kannada was their language of administration. The Pagodas and Fanams were the common coinage of all the Alupa kings.  The obverse of the coins carried the royal emblem \"Two Fishes\" and the reverse had the legend \"Sri Pandya Dhanamjaya\"  either in Nagari or old (Hale) Kannada.<ref name=\"oldest\"/>\n\nThis paragraph is about the inscription found at Neelavara temple of Udupi district. This is all about the grant in \"Gadyana\" denomination. The Alupas while ruling from Barakuru showed great interest in the development of temple. This record is of the Alupa ruler Veerapandyadeva, dated 1258 CE mentions about his instruction to \"neeruvara munnuru\" i.e. Neeruvara-300, the modern Neelavara village Assembly. It states that after paying 100 gadyanas (coins) to the palace and 30 gadyanas to Adhikari, remaining 30 gadyanas, should be used by the village assembly for its expense. Yet another inscription of Veerapandyadeva's queen Ballamahadevi, the next ruler is also seen here. The record mentions that when Ballamahadevi was ruling her kingdom with the help of samastapradanas, Deshi purushas, Bahattara niyogis and Rishi Purohita, she gave a grant to Niruvara Bhagavati, out of 100 honnus that is paid to the palace. This inscription was written by Keshava Senabhova as mentioned in the epigraph.\n\nThe Alupas were one of the three dynasties that issued gold coins as early as 8th century CE. The gold that used to mint coins came from trade with the Romans, Arabs and from the adjacent kingdom of Gangas. No other ancient dynasties of the south have issued that many varieties of gold coins as Alupas and Gangas did.  The coins of both Gangas and Alupas have inscriptions that helps in dating the period of issue. Unfortunately these coins have not drawn much attention compared to that of Chalukyas or Hoysals. But for sure, they have inspired later dynasties as a prototype or basis to issue coins.  Shown below is the hand-drawing of some of the Pandya Gadyanas (Alupa coins) obverse image.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Dr. Suryanath U.

It was fought on 19 September 1356 in Nouaill\u00e9, near the city of [[Poitiers]] in [[Aquitaine]], western France. [[Edward, the Black Prince]], led an army of [[Kingdom of England|English]], [[Principality of Wales|Welsh]], [[Duchy of Brittany|Breton]] and [[Duchy of Gascony|Gascon]] troops, many of them veterans of the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]]. They were attacked by a larger French force led by [[King John II of France]], which included allied [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] forces. The French were heavily defeated; an English counter-attack captured King John, along with [[Philip the Bold|his youngest son]], and much of the French nobility who were present.{{sfn|Blockmans|Prevenier|1999|pp=14\u201315}}\n\nThe effect of the defeat on France was catastrophic, leaving [[Charles V of France|Dauphin Charles]] to rule the country. Charles faced [[Jacquerie|populist revolts across the kingdom]] in the wake of the battle, which had destroyed the prestige of the French upper-class. The Edwardian phase of the war ended four years later in 1360, [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny|on favourable terms for England]].\n\nPoitiers was the second major English victory of the [[Hundred Years' War]], coming a decade after the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] and about half a century before the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. The town and battle were often referred to as ''Poictiers'' in contemporaneous recordings, a name commemorated by [[HMS Poictiers|several warships of the Royal Navy]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Kendall B.

Edward had been reluctant to pay homage to Philip in his role as [[Duke of Aquitaine]], resulting in Philip's confiscation of those lands in 1337, an act which provoked war between the two nations. Three years later, Edward declared himself [[King of France]]. The war had begun well for the English. They had achieved naval domination early in the conflict at the [[Battle of Sluys]] in 1340,<ref>Henri de Wailly. Introduction by Emmanuel Bourassin, ''Crecy 1346: Anatomy of a Battle'' (Blandford Press, Poole, Dorset 1987) p. 10</ref> devastated the south west of France during the [[Gascon campaign of 1345]] and [[Lancaster's chevauch\u00e9e of 1346|Lancaster's chevauch\u00e9e]] the following year, inflicted a severe defeat on the French army at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] in 1346, and [[Siege of Calais (1346\u20131347)|captured Calais in 1347]].\n\nIn the late 1340s and early 1350s, the [[Black Death]] had devastated the population of Western Europe, even claiming Philip's wife, [[Joan the Lame|Queen Joan]], as well as one of Edward's daughters, also named [[Joan of England (1335\u20131348)|Joan]]; due to the disruption caused by the plague, all significant military campaigning was brought to a halt. Philip himself died in 1350, and was succeeded by his son, who was crowned King John II. In 1355, Edward III laid out plans for a second major campaign. His eldest son, [[Edward, the Black Prince]], now an experienced soldier following the Cr\u00e9cy campaign, landed at [[Bordeaux]] in Aquitaine, leading his army on a march through southern France to [[Carcassonne]]. Unable to take the heavily fortified settlement, Edward withdrew back to Bordeaux. In early 1356, the [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Duke of Lancaster]] led an army through [[Normandy]], while Edward led his army on a great [[chevauch\u00e9e]] from Bordeaux on 8 August 1356.<ref>William W. Lace, ''The Hundred Years' War'' {{ISBN|978-1-56006-233-2}}, 1/1994</ref>\n\nEdward's forces met little resistance, sacking numerous settlements, until they reached the [[Loire]] river at [[Tours]]. They were unable to take the castle or burn the town due to a heavy rainstorm. This delay allowed King John to attempt to pin down and destroy Edward's army. John, who had been besieging [[Breteuil, Eure|Breteuil]] in [[Normandy]], organised the bulk of his army at [[Chartres]] to the north of Tours. In order to increase the speed of his army's march, he dismissed between 15,000 and 20,000 of his lower quality infantry, just as Edward turned back to Bordeaux.<ref>Jonathan Sumption, ''The Hundred Years' War: Vol. 2: Trial by Fire'' (London: Faber, 2001), pp. 223, 227\u2013228</ref> The French rode hard and cut in front of the English army, crossing the bridge over the Vienne at Chauvigny. Learning of this, the Black Prince quickly moved his army south.

He deployed his front line of longbowmen behind a particularly prominent thick hedge, through which the road ran at right angles. The Earl of Douglas, commanding the Scottish division in the French army, advised King John that the attack should be delivered on foot, with horses being particularly vulnerable to English arrows. John heeded this advice, his army leaving its baggage behind and forming up on foot in front of the English. The English gained vantage points on the natural high ground in order for their longbowmen to have an advantage over the heavily armoured French troops.{{citation needed|date = September 2018}}\n\n==== English army ====\nThe English army was led by [[Edward, the Black Prince]], and composed primarily of English and Welsh troops, though there was a large contingent of [[Duchy of Gascony|Gascon]] and [[Duchy of Brittany|Breton]] soldiers with the army. Edward's army consisted of approximately 2,000 [[longbow]]men, 3,000 [[men-at-arms]], and a force of 1,000 Gascon infantry.\n\nLike the earlier engagement at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]], the power of the English army lay in the [[longbow]], a tall, thick self-bow made of yew. Longbows had demonstrated their effectiveness against massed infantry and cavalry in several battles, such as [[Battle of Falkirk|Falkirk]] in 1298, [[Battle of Halidon Hill|Halidon Hill]] in 1333, and [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] in 1346. Poitiers was the second of three major English victories of the [[Hundred Years' War]] attributed to the longbow, though its effectiveness against armoured French knights and men-at-arms has been disputed.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Strickland|first1= Matthew|last2= Hardy|first2= Robert|date= 2005|pages= 272\u2013278|title = The Great Warbow: From Hastings to the Mary Rose|publisher = Sutton Publishing|isbn = 9780750931670}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|ref=harv |last=Kaiser |first=Robert E. |date=December 2003 |title=Medieval Military Surgery |journal=Medieval History Magazine|volume=1 |issue=4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rogers |first1=Clifford J.|title=The Efficacy of the Medieval Longbow: A Reply to Kelly DeVries|journal=War in History|date=1998|volume=5|issue=2 |pages= 233\u201342 |url=https://www.academia.edu/13146838/_The_Efficacy_of_the_Medieval_Longbow_A_Reply_to_Kelly_DeVries_War_in_History_5_no._2_1998_233-42}}</ref>\n\n[[Geoffrey the Baker]] wrote that the English archers under the Earl of Salisbury \"made their arrows prevail over the [French] knights' armour\",<ref>Edward Maunde Thompson, ''Chronicle of Geoffrey le Baker'', (Oxford at the Clarendon Press 1889) p. 147 (\"''coegerunt sagittas armis militaribus prevalere''\")</ref> but the bowmen on the other flank, under Warwick, were initially ineffective against the mounted French men-at-arms who enjoyed the double protection of steel plate armour and large leather shields.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barber|first=Richard|title=The Life and Campaigns of the Black Prince|year=1986|publisher=Boydell Press|location=Woodbridge|isbn=0-85115-435-2|page=76}}</ref> Once Warwick's archers redeployed to a position where they could hit the unarmored sides and backs of the horses, however, they quickly routed the cavalry force opposing them.

The English army's divisions were led by [[Edward, the Black Prince]], the [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], the [[William de Montagu, 2nd Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]], Sir John Chandos and [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch|Captal de Buch]].\n\n==== French army ====\nThe French army was led by King John, and was composed largely of native French soldiers, though there was a contingent of [[Holy Roman Empire|German knights]], and a large force of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] soldiers. The latter force was led by the [[William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas|Earl of Douglas]] and fought in the King's own division.<ref>William F. Skene, ''John of Fordun\u2019s Chronicle of the Scottish Nation'', (Edinburgh Edmonston and Douglas 1872), p. 365</ref> The French army at the battle comprised approximately 8,000 men-at-arms and 3,000 common infantry, though John had made the decision to leave behind the vast majority of his infantry, numbering up to 20,000, in order to overtake and force the English to battle.\n\nThe French army was arrayed in three \"battles\" or divisions. The vanguard was led by the [[Charles V of France|Dauphin Charles]], the second by the [[Philip, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], while the third, the largest, was led by the King himself.\n\n=== Negotiations ===\nPrior to the battle, the local prelate, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[H\u00e9lie de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord (cardinal)|H\u00e9lie de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]] attempted to broker a truce between the two sides, as recorded in the writings of the English commander, Sir John Chandos.<ref>Mildred K. Pope; Eleanor C. Lodge, ''Life of the Black Prince by the Herald of Sir John Chandos'' (Oxford, UK Clarendon Press 1910), p. 857</ref> Attending the conference on the French side were King John, the [[Earl of Tankerville|Count of Tankerville]], the Archbishop of Sens, and [[Jean II de Talaru|Jean de Talaru]]. Representing the English were the [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], the [[Robert d'Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earl of Suffolk]], [[Bartholomew de Burghersh, 2nd Baron Burghersh|Bartholomew de Burghersh]], [[James Audley]], and Sir John Chandos. The English offered to hand over all of the war booty they had taken on their raids throughout France, as well as a seven-year truce. John, who believed his force could easily overwhelm the English, declined their proposal. John's counter suggestion that the Black Prince and his army should surrender was flatly rejected.  An account of the meeting was recorded in the writings of the life of Sir [[John Chandos]] and were made in the final moments of a meeting of both sides in an effort to avoid the bloody conflict at Poitiers during The Hundred Years' War.  The extraordinary narrative occurred just before that battle and reads as follows: {{cquote|... The conference attended by the King of France, Sir John Chandos, and many other prominent people of the period, The King, to prolong the matter and to put off the battle, assembled and brought together all the barons of both sides. Of speech there he (the King) made no stint. There came the [[Earl of Tankerville|Count of Tancarville]], and, as the list says, the Archbishop of Sens (Guillaume de Melun) was there, he of [[Taurus Mountains|Taurus]], of great discretion, Charny, Bouciquaut, and Clermont; all these went there for the council of the King of France. On the other side there came gladly the [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], the hoary-headed (white or grey headed) [[Robert d'Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earl of Suffolk]] was there, and [[Bartholomew de Burghersh, 2nd Baron Burghersh|Bartholomew de Burghersh]], most privy to the Prince, and [[James Audley|Audeley]] and [[John Chandos|Chandos]], who at that time were of great repute. There they held their parliament, and each one spoke his mind. But their counsel I cannot relate, yet I know well, in very truth, as I hear in my record, that they could not be agreed, wherefore each one of them began to depart. Then said Geoffroi de Charny: 'Lords,' quoth he, 'since so it is that this treaty pleases you no more, I make offer that we fight you, a hundred against a hundred, choosing each one from his own side; and know well, whichever hundred be discomfited, all the others, know for sure, shall quit this field and let the quarrel be. I think that it will be best so, and that God will be gracious to us if the battle be avoided in which so many valiant men will be slain.<ref>''[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924013109149/cu31924013109149_djvu.txt ''Life of the Black Prince by the Herald of Sir.

The attack was a disaster, with many of the knights shot down or killed by English soldiery. According to [[Froissart's Chronicles|Froissart]], the English archers then shot their bows at the massed French infantry.<ref>https://www.britishbattles.com/one-hundred-years-war/battle-of-poitiers/</ref> The Dauphin's division reached the English line. Exhausted by a long march in heavy equipment and harassed by the hail of arrows, the division was repulsed after approximately two hours of combat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.eckerd.edu/~oberhot/poitiers.htm |title=Battle of Poitiers |first=Tom |last=Oberhofer |publisher=[[Eckerd College]] |access-date=2018-09-17 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe retreating vanguard collided with the advancing division of the [[Philip, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], throwing the French army into chaos. Seeing the Dauphin's troops falling back, Orl\u00e9ans' division fell back in confusion. The third, and strongest, division led by the King advanced, and the two withdrawing divisions coalesced and resumed their advance against the English. Believing that the retreat of the first two French divisions marked the withdrawal of the French, Edward had ordered a force under [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch|Captal de Buch]] to pursue. Sir John Chandos urged the Prince to launch this force upon the main body of the French army under the King. Seizing upon this idea, Edward ordered all his men-at-arms and knights to mount for the charge, while de Buch's men, already mounted, were instructed to advance around the French left flank and rear.<ref>This section reflects the traditional narrative of the battle, which relies to a substantial extent on the chronicle of Jean Froissart.

With the French stunned by the attack, the impetus carried the English and Gascon forces right into their line. Simultaneously, de Buch's mobile reserve of mounted troops fell upon the French left flank and rear. With the French army fearful of encirclement, their cohesion disintegrated as many soldiers attempted to flee the field. Low on arrows, the English and Welsh archers abandoned their bows and ran forward to join the mel\u00e9e. Around this time, King John and his son, [[Philip the Bold]], found themselves surrounded. As written by Froissart, an exiled French knight fighting with the English, Sir Denis Morbeke of Artois approached the king, requesting the King's surrender. The King is said to have replied, \"To whom shall I yield me? Where is my cousin the Prince of Wales? If I might see him, I would speak with him\". Denis replied; \"Sir, he is not here; but yield you to me and I shall bring you to him\". The king handed him his right gauntlet, saying; \"I yield me to you\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Froissart |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Froissart |editor-first=Charles |editor-last=Eliot |title=Chronicle and Romance: Froissart, Malory, Holinshed |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.126239 |accessdate=2018-09-17| year=1910 |page=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.126239/page/n56 52] |chapter=The Battle of Poitiers |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the surrender of the King and his son Philip, the French army broke up and left the field, ending the battle.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\nFollowing the battle, Edward resumed his march back to the English stronghold at Bordeaux. [[Jean de Venette]], a Carmelite friar, vividly describes the chaos that ensued following the battle. The demise of the French nobility at the battle, only ten years from the catastrophe at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]], threw the kingdom into chaos. The realm was left in the hands of the [[Charles V of France|Dauphin Charles]], who faced [[Jacquerie|popular rebellion across the kingdom]] in the wake of the defeat. Jean writes that the French nobles brutally repressed the rebellions, robbing, despoiling, and pillaging the peasants' goods. [[Free company|Mercenary companies]] hired by both sides added to the destruction, plundering the peasants and the churches.<ref>Jean Birdsall, Richard A. Newhall, ''The Chronicles of Jean de Venette '' (Columbia University Press 1953) p. 6</ref>\n\nCharles, to the misery of the French peasantry, began to raise additional funds to pay for the [[ransom]] of his father, and to continue the war effort. Capitalising on the discontent in France, [[Edward III of England|King Edward]] assembled his army at [[Calais]] in 1359 and led his army on a campaign against [[Rheims]]. Unable to take Rheims or the French capital, [[Paris]], Edward moved his army to [[Chartres]]. Later, the Dauphin Charles offered to open negotiations, and Edward agreed.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]] was ratified on 24 October 1360, ending the Edwardian phase of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In it, Edward agreed to renounce his claims to the French throne, in exchange for full sovereign rights over an expanded Aquitaine and Calais, essentially restoring the former [[Angevin Empire]].<ref>Hersch Lauterpacht, \"Volume 20 of International Law Reports, Cambridge University Press, 1957, {{ISBN|0-521-46365-3}}, p. 118</ref>\n\n== Nobles and men-at-arms present ==\n=== English ===\n[[Jean Froissart|Froissart]] states that these men fought with the Black Prince:\n* [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick]]\n* [[William de Ufford, 2nd Earl of Suffolk]]\n* [[William de Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury]]\n* [[John de Vere, 7th Earl of Oxford]]<ref>Edward Maunde Thompson, ''Chronicle of Geoffrey le Baker'', (Oxford at the Clarendon Press 1889) p. 248</ref>\n* [[Reginald de Cobham, 1st Baron Cobham]]\n* [[Edward le Despencer, 1st Baron le Despencer]]<ref>David Nicolle, Graham Turner, ''Poitiers 1356: The Capture of a King'' (U.K. Osprey Publishing, 2004), p. 10</ref>\n* [[James Audley|Lord James Audley]]\n* Lord Peter Audley\n* [[Thomas de Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley|Thomas, Lord Berkeley]]\n* [[Ralph Basset, 4th Baron Basset of Drayton|Ralph, Lord Basset]]\n* [[Fulke FitzWarine, 3rd Baron FitzWarine|Fulk, Lord FitzWarin]]\n* Lord Delaware\n* Lord Manne\n* [[John de Willoughby, 3rd Baron Willoughby de Eresby|John, Lord Willoughby]]\n* Lord Bartholomew de Burghersh\n* [[Thomas Felton (died 1381)|Thomas, Lord of Felton]]<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Felton, * Thomas (d.1381)|volume=18|page=308}}</ref>\n* Lord Richard of Pembroke\n* Lord Stephen of Cosington\n* Lord Bradetane\n* Lord of Pommiers\n* Lord of [[Langoiran|Languiran]]\n* [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch|Captal of Buch]]\n* Lord John the 69th of Caumont\n* Lord de [[Lesparre-M\u00e9doc|Lesparre]]\n* Lord of [[Rauzan]]\n* Lord of Condon\n* Lord of [[Montferrand (district of Clermont-Ferrand)|Montferrand]]\n* Lord of [[Landiras]]\n* Lord Soudic of Latrau\n* Lord Eustace d'Aubrecicourt\n* Lord John of Ghistelles\n* Lord Daniel Pasele\n* Lord Denis of Amposta<ref>John Bourchier; G.

It was fought on 19 September 1356 in Nouaill\u00e9, near the city of [[Poitiers]] in [[Aquitaine]], western France. [[Edward, the Black Prince]], led an army of [[Kingdom of England|English]], [[Principality of Wales|Welsh]], [[Duchy of Brittany|Breton]] and [[Duchy of Gascony|Gascon]] troops, many of them veterans of the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]]. They were attacked by a larger French force led by [[King John II of France]], which included allied [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] forces. The French were heavily defeated; an English counter-attack captured King John, along with [[Philip the Bold|his youngest son]], and much of the French nobility who were present.{{sfn|Blockmans|Prevenier|1999|pp=14\u201315}}\n\nThe effect of the defeat on France was catastrophic, leaving [[Charles V of France|Dauphin Charles]] to rule the country. Charles faced [[Jacquerie|populist revolts across the kingdom]] in the wake of the battle, which had destroyed the prestige of the French upper-class. The Edwardian phase of the war ended four years later in 1360, [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny|on favourable terms for England]].\n\nPoitiers was the second major English victory of the [[Hundred Years' War]], coming a decade after the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] and about half a century before the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. The town and battle were often referred to as ''Poictiers'' in contemporaneous recordings, a name commemorated by [[HMS Poictiers|several warships of the Royal Navy]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Kendall B. Tarte|title=Writing Places: Sixteenth-century City Culture and the Des Roches Salon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFPvOm09BhwC&pg=PA134|year=2007|publisher=Associated University Presse|isbn=978-0-87413-965-5|page=134}}</ref>\n\n== Campaign background ==\nFollowing the death of [[Charles IV of France]] in 1328, [[Philip VI of France|Philip]], Count of Valois, had been chosen as his successor and crowned King Philip VI of France, superseding his closest male relative and legal successor, [[Edward III of England]]. Edward had been reluctant to pay homage to Philip in his role as [[Duke of Aquitaine]], resulting in Philip's confiscation of those lands in 1337, an act which provoked war between the two nations. Three years later, Edward declared himself [[King of France]]. The war had begun well for the English. They had achieved naval domination early in the conflict at the [[Battle of Sluys]] in 1340,<ref>Henri de Wailly. Introduction by Emmanuel Bourassin, ''Crecy 1346: Anatomy of a Battle'' (Blandford Press, Poole, Dorset 1987) p. 10</ref> devastated the south west of France during the [[Gascon campaign of 1345]] and [[Lancaster's chevauch\u00e9e of 1346|Lancaster's chevauch\u00e9e]] the following year, inflicted a severe defeat on the French army at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] in 1346, and [[Siege of Calais (1346\u20131347)|captured Calais in 1347]].\n\nIn the late 1340s and early 1350s, the [[Black Death]] had devastated the population of Western Europe, even claiming Philip's wife, [[Joan the Lame|Queen Joan]], as well as one of Edward's daughters, also named [[Joan of England|Joan]]; due to the disruption caused by the plague, all significant military campaigning was brought to a halt. Philip himself died in 1350, and was succeeded by his son, who was crowned King John II. In 1355, Edward III laid out plans for a second major campaign. His eldest son, [[Edward, the Black Prince]], now an experienced soldier following the Cr\u00e9cy campaign, landed at [[Bordeaux]] in Aquitaine, leading his army on a march through southern France to [[Carcassonne]]. Unable to take the heavily fortified settlement, Edward withdrew back to Bordeaux. In early 1356, the [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Duke of Lancaster]] led an army through [[Normandy]], while Edward led his army on a great [[chevauch\u00e9e]] from Bordeaux on 8 August 1356.<ref>William W. Lace, ''The Hundred Years' War'' {{ISBN|978-1-56006-233-2}}, 1/1994</ref>\n\nEdward's forces met little resistance, sacking numerous settlements, until they reached the [[Loire]] river at [[Tours]]. They were unable to take the castle or burn the town due to a heavy rainstorm. This delay allowed King John to attempt to pin down and destroy Edward's army. John, who had been besieging [[Breteuil, Eure|Breteuil]] in [[Normandy]], organised the bulk of his army at [[Chartres]] to the north of Tours. In order to increase the speed of his army's march, he dismissed between 15,000 and 20,000 of his lower quality infantry, just as Edward turned back to Bordeaux.<ref>Jonathan Sumption, ''The Hundred Years' War: Vol. 2: Trial by Fire'' (London: Faber, 2001), pp. 223, 227\u2013228</ref> The French rode hard and cut in front of the English army, crossing the bridge over the Vienne at Chauvigny. Learning of this, the Black Prince quickly moved his army south. Historians disagree over whether the outnumbered English commander was seeking battle or trying to avoid it.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rogers|first1=Clifford J.|title=War Cruel and Sharp: English Strategy under Edward III|date=2000|publisher=Boydell and Brewwer|location=Woodbridge|pages=348\u2013373}}</ref> In any case, after preliminary manoeuvres and failed negotiations for a truce, the two armies faced-off, both ready for battle, near [[Poitiers]] on Monday, 19 September 1356.\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:Battle-poitiers(1356).jpg|300px|thumb|Battle of Poitiers (miniature of Froissart)]][[File:Battle of Poitiers.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Battle of Poitiers]] 1356. The oriflamme carried by [[Geoffroy de Charny]] can be seen on the top left.]]\n\n=== Preparations ===\nEdward arrayed his army in a defensive posture among the hedges and orchards of the area, in front of the forest of Nouaill\u00e9. He deployed his front line of longbowmen behind a particularly prominent thick hedge, through which the road ran at right angles. The Earl of Douglas, commanding the Scottish division in the French army, advised King John that the attack should be delivered on foot, with horses being particularly vulnerable to English arrows. John heeded this advice, his army leaving its baggage behind and forming up on foot in front of the English. The English gained vantage points on the natural high ground in order for their longbowmen to have an advantage over the heavily armoured French troops.{{citation needed|date = September 2018}}\n\n==== English army ====\nThe English army was led by [[Edward, the Black Prince]], and composed primarily of English and Welsh troops, though there was a large contingent of [[Duchy of Gascony|Gascon]] and [[Duchy of Brittany|Breton]] soldiers with the army. Edward's army consisted of approximately 2,000 [[longbow]]men, 3,000 [[men-at-arms]], and a force of 1,000 Gascon infantry.\n\nLike the earlier engagement at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]], the power of the English army lay in the [[longbow]], a tall, thick self-bow made of yew. Longbows had demonstrated their effectiveness against massed infantry and cavalry in several battles, such as [[Battle of Falkirk|Falkirk]] in 1298, [[Battle of Halidon Hill|Halidon Hill]] in 1333, and [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] in 1346. Poitiers was the second of three major English victories of the [[Hundred Years' War]] attributed to the longbow, though its effectiveness against armoured French knights and men-at-arms has been disputed.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Strickland|first1= Matthew|last2= Hardy|first2= Robert|date= 2005|pages= 272\u2013278|title = The Great Warbow: From Hastings to the Mary Rose|publisher = Sutton Publishing|isbn = 9780750931670}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|ref=harv |last=Kaiser |first=Robert E. |date=December 2003 |title=Medieval Military Surgery |journal=Medieval History Magazine|volume=1 |issue=4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rogers |first1=Clifford J.|title=The Efficacy of the Medieval Longbow: A Reply to Kelly DeVries|journal=War in History|date=1998|volume=5|issue=2 |pages= 233\u201342 |url=https://www.academia.edu/13146838/_The_Efficacy_of_the_Medieval_Longbow_A_Reply_to_Kelly_DeVries_War_in_History_5_no._2_1998_233-42}}</ref>\n\n[[Geoffrey the Baker]] wrote that the English archers under the Earl of Salisbury \"made their arrows prevail over the [French] knights' armour\",<ref>Edward Maunde Thompson, ''Chronicle of Geoffrey le Baker'', (Oxford at the Clarendon Press 1889) p. 147 (\"''coegerunt sagittas armis militaribus prevalere''\")</ref> but the bowmen on the other flank, under Warwick, were initially ineffective against the mounted French men-at-arms who enjoyed the double protection of steel plate armour and large leather shields.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barber|first=Richard|title=The Life and Campaigns of the Black Prince|year=1986|publisher=Boydell Press|location=Woodbridge|isbn=0-85115-435-2|page=76}}</ref> Once Warwick's archers redeployed to a position where they could hit the unarmored sides and backs of the horses, however, they quickly routed the cavalry force opposing them.

Green, ''The Battle of Poitiers 1356'', (Tempus Publishing, Charleston, S.C., 2002)</ref><ref>Edward Maunde Thompson, ''Chronicle of Geoffrey le Baker'', (Oxford at the Clarendon Press 1889) p. 304</ref>\n\nThe English army was an experienced force; many archers were veterans of the earlier [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]], and two of the key commanders, [[John Chandos|Sir John Chandos]], and [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch|Captal de Buch]] were both experienced soldiers. The English army's divisions were led by [[Edward, the Black Prince]], the [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], the [[William de Montagu, 2nd Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]], Sir John Chandos and [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch|Captal de Buch]].\n\n==== French army ====\nThe French army was led by King John, and was composed largely of native French soldiers, though there was a contingent of [[Holy Roman Empire|German knights]], and a large force of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] soldiers. The latter force was led by the [[William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas|Earl of Douglas]] and fought in the King's own division.<ref>William F. Skene, ''John of Fordun\u2019s Chronicle of the Scottish Nation'', (Edinburgh Edmonston and Douglas 1872), p. 365</ref> The French army at the battle comprised approximately 8,000 men-at-arms and 3,000 common infantry, though John had made the decision to leave behind the vast majority of his infantry, numbering up to 20,000, in order to overtake and force the English to battle.\n\nThe French army was arrayed in three \"battles\" or divisions. The vanguard was led by the [[Charles V of France|Dauphin Charles]], the second by the [[Philip, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], while the third, the largest, was led by the King himself.\n\n=== Negotiations ===\nPrior to the battle, the local prelate, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[H\u00e9lie de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord (cardinal)|H\u00e9lie de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]] attempted to broker a truce between the two sides, as recorded in the writings of the English commander, Sir John Chandos.<ref>Mildred K. Pope; Eleanor C. Lodge, ''Life of the Black Prince by the Herald of Sir John Chandos'' (Oxford, UK Clarendon Press 1910), p. 857</ref> Attending the conference on the French side were King John, the [[Earl of Tankerville|Count of Tankerville]], the Archbishop of Sens, and [[Jean II de Talaru|Jean de Talaru]]. Representing the English were the [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], the [[Robert d'Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earl of Suffolk]], [[Bartholomew de Burghersh, 2nd Baron Burghersh|Bartholomew de Burghersh]], [[James Audley]], and Sir John Chandos. The English offered to hand over all of the war booty they had taken on their raids throughout France, as well as a seven-year truce. John, who believed his force could easily overwhelm the English, declined their proposal. John's counter suggestion that the Black Prince and his army should surrender was flatly rejected.  An account of the meeting was recorded in the writings of the life of Sir [[John Chandos]] and were made in the final moments of a meeting of both sides in an effort to avoid the bloody conflict at Poitiers during The Hundred Years' War.  The extraordinary narrative occurred just before that battle and reads as follows: {{cquote|... The conference attended by the King of France, Sir John Chandos, and many other prominent people of the period, The King, to prolong the matter and to put off the battle, assembled and brought together all the barons of both sides. Of speech there he (the King) made no stint. There came the [[Earl of Tankerville|Count of Tancarville]], and, as the list says, the Archbishop of Sens (Guillaume de Melun) was there, he of [[Taurus Mountains|Taurus]], of great discretion, Charny, Bouciquaut, and Clermont; all these went there for the council of the King of France. On the other side there came gladly the [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], the hoary-headed (white or grey headed) [[Robert d'Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earl of Suffolk]] was there, and [[Bartholomew de Burghersh, 2nd Baron Burghersh|Bartholomew de Burghersh]], most privy to the Prince, and [[James Audley|Audeley]] and [[John Chandos|Chandos]], who at that time were of great repute. There they held their parliament, and each one spoke his mind. But their counsel I cannot relate, yet I know well, in very truth, as I hear in my record, that they could not be agreed, wherefore each one of them began to depart. Then said Geoffroi de Charny: 'Lords,' quoth he, 'since so it is that this treaty pleases you no more, I make offer that we fight you, a hundred against a hundred, choosing each one from his own side; and know well, whichever hundred be discomfited, all the others, know for sure, shall quit this field and let the quarrel be. I think that it will be best so, and that God will be gracious to us if the battle be avoided in which so many valiant men will be slain.<ref>''[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924013109149/cu31924013109149_djvu.txt ''Life of the Black Prince by the Herald of Sir.

The attack was a disaster, with many of the knights shot down or killed by English soldiery. According to [[Froissart's Chronicles|Froissart]], the English archers then shot their bows at the massed French infantry.<ref>https://www.britishbattles.com/one-hundred-years-war/battle-of-poitiers/</ref> The Dauphin's division reached the English line. Exhausted by a long march in heavy equipment and harassed by the hail of arrows, the division was repulsed after approximately two hours of combat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.eckerd.edu/~oberhot/poitiers.htm |title=Battle of Poitiers |first=Tom |last=Oberhofer |publisher=[[Eckerd College]] |access-date=2018-09-17 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe retreating vanguard collided with the advancing division of the [[Philip, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], throwing the French army into chaos. Seeing the Dauphin's troops falling back, Orl\u00e9ans' division fell back in confusion. The third, and strongest, division led by the King advanced, and the two withdrawing divisions coalesced and resumed their advance against the English. Believing that the retreat of the first two French divisions marked the withdrawal of the French, Edward had ordered a force under [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch|Captal de Buch]] to pursue. Sir John Chandos urged the Prince to launch this force upon the main body of the French army under the King. Seizing upon this idea, Edward ordered all his men-at-arms and knights to mount for the charge, while de Buch's men, already mounted, were instructed to advance around the French left flank and rear.<ref>This section reflects the traditional narrative of the battle, which relies to a substantial extent on the chronicle of Jean Froissart.

Rogers, [https://www.academia.edu/34425406/The_Battle_of_Poitiers_1356_English_Version_ \"The Battle of Poitiers, 1356\"] (English-language version of  \"La batalla de Poitiers (1356)\", ''Desperta  Ferro.

With the French stunned by the attack, the impetus carried the English and Gascon forces right into their line. Simultaneously, de Buch's mobile reserve of mounted troops fell upon the French left flank and rear. With the French army fearful of encirclement, their cohesion disintegrated as many soldiers attempted to flee the field. Low on arrows, the English and Welsh archers abandoned their bows and ran forward to join the mel\u00e9e. Around this time, King John and his son, [[Philip the Bold]], found themselves surrounded. As written by Froissart, an exiled French knight fighting with the English, Sir Denis Morbeke of Artois approached the king, requesting the King's surrender. The King is said to have replied, \"To whom shall I yield me? Where is my cousin the Prince of Wales? If I might see him, I would speak with him\". Denis replied; \"Sir, he is not here; but yield you to me and I shall bring you to him\". The king handed him his right gauntlet, saying; \"I yield me to you\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Froissart |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Froissart |editor-first=Charles |editor-last=Eliot |title=Chronicle and Romance: Froissart, Malory, Holinshed |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.126239 |accessdate=2018-09-17| year=1910 |page=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.126239/page/n56 52] |chapter=The Battle of Poitiers |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the surrender of the King and his son Philip, the French army broke up and left the field, ending the battle.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\nFollowing the battle, Edward resumed his march back to the English stronghold at Bordeaux. [[Jean de Venette]], a Carmelite friar, vividly describes the chaos that ensued following the battle. The demise of the French nobility at the battle, only ten years from the catastrophe at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]], threw the kingdom into chaos. The realm was left in the hands of the [[Charles V of France|Dauphin Charles]], who faced [[Jacquerie|popular rebellion across the kingdom]] in the wake of the defeat. Jean writes that the French nobles brutally repressed the rebellions, robbing, despoiling, and pillaging the peasants' goods. [[Free company|Mercenary companies]] hired by both sides added to the destruction, plundering the peasants and the churches.<ref>Jean Birdsall, Richard A. Newhall, ''The Chronicles of Jean de Venette '' (Columbia University Press 1953) p. 6</ref>\n\nCharles, to the misery of the French peasantry, began to raise additional funds to pay for the [[ransom]] of his father, and to continue the war effort. Capitalising on the discontent in France, [[Edward III of England|King Edward]] assembled his army at [[Calais]] in 1359 and led his army on a campaign against [[Rheims]]. Unable to take Rheims or the French capital, [[Paris]], Edward moved his army to [[Chartres]].
