The song was released on May 8, 2017, as a promotional single through [[Kidinakorner]] and [[Interscope Records|Interscope]]. It later became the third single from the band's third studio album, ''[[Evolve (Imagine Dragons album)|Evolve]]'', on October 6, 2017. It was also the official theme song for [[World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.|WWE]]'s [[Pay-Per-View|PPV]] event [[Battleground (2017)|Battleground]], in addition to its inclusion in the video game ''[[Madden NFL 18]]''. The song was sent to US [[contemporary hit radio]] on February 13, 2018.\n\n==Background==\nThe song was announced alongside the name and album art of ''[[Evolve (Imagine Dragons album)|Evolve]]'' via Twitter on May 9, 2017.<ref>{{cite news|last=Da'Shan Smith|date=May 9, 2017|title=Imagine Dragons Are Ready to 'Evolve' With Upcoming Album & Tour, Share New Song 'Whatever It Takes'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7791817/imagine-dragons-evolve-new-album-tour-whatever-it-takes|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=May 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2017, they performed the song on ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/VIDEO-Imagine-Dragons-Performs-Whatever-It-Takes-on-LATE-NIGHT-20171031|title=Imagine Dragons Performs 'Whatever It Takes' on LATE NIGHT|work=Broadway World|date=October 31, 2017|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2018, Imagine Dragons asked [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] to stop using \"Whatever It Takes\" on their conference website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kqradio.com/index.php/2018/02/16/imagine-dragons-asks-conservative-group-to-stop-using-whatever-it-takes/|title=Imagine Dragons asks conservative group to stop using \"Whatever It Takes\"|publisher=Q95|date=February 16, 2018|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wixx.com/news/articles/2018/feb/16/imagine-dragons-asks-conservative-group-to-stop-using-whatever-it-takes/|title=Imagine Dragons asks conservative group to stop using \"Whatever It Takes\"|publisher=WIXX 101|date=February 16, 2018|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn May 30, 2018, they performed the song live before game two of the [[2018 Stanley Cup Finals]] at [[T-Mobile Arena]] in their hometown of [[Las Vegas]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Imagine Dragons rock Cup Final before Game 2|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/imagine-dragons-perform-before-stanley-cup-final-game-2/c-298855920|publisher=NHL Enterprises, L.P.|website=NHL.com|date=May 30, 2018|accessdate=January 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA)'s [[Utah Jazz]] frequently play the song prior to tip-off of every home game at [[Vivint Smart Home Arena]] in [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Walden|first=Eric|title=Utah Jazz sleepwalk past Cleveland Cavaliers, 115-99, for sixth straight victory|url=https://www.sltrib.com/sports/2019/01/19/live-jazz-take-cavs/|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=January 19, 2019|access-date=March 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nA music video for the song was released on October 12, 2017. It was directed by [[Matt Eastin]] and Aaron Hymes. Eastin had also previously directed the music videos for Imagine Dragons' songs \"[[On Top of the World (Imagine Dragons song)|On Top of the World]]\", \"[[Roots (Imagine Dragons song)|Roots]]\", and \"[[Believer (Imagine Dragons song)|Believer]]\". The video begins with lead singer [[Dan Reynolds (singer)|Dan Reynolds]] swimming through a room filled with water. It then cuts to a scene in which Reynolds and the band are playing in the same room; however, it is not filled with water in this scene. As they perform the chorus of the song, the roof crumbles and rain starts pouring in. Throughout the video, the rain persists and the room eventually fills completely with water. However, the band still plays. As Reynolds sings, objects such as boxing gloves and keys float by him along with two people who are seemingly sirens, tugging at him from both sides. Before the final chorus, the music stops and the band floats lifelessly on the water. When they break into song again, the stage has completely changed as the room is no longer underwater, but on fire as the band plays on it. As the video ends, everything is on fire and the music stops.<ref>{{cite news|date=October 12, 2017|title=Imagine Dragons - Whatever It Takes|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOsM-DYAEhY|work=[[YouTube]]|access-date=October 12, 2017}}</ref> The video won the [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video]] award.\nIts official music video has received over 673 million views and 4 million likes as of March 2020\n\n==Critical reception==\n''[[The Guardian]]'' writes that \"Whatever It Takes\" was \"written with a sports highlights package in mind (\"I love the adrenaline in my veins\", wails frontman Dan Reynolds, before chart pop's current obligatory chorus of \"woah-ohs\" enters).\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/22/imagine-dragons-evolve-review-lifeless-electronic-tinged-arena-rock|title=Imagine Dragons: Evolve review \u2013 lifeless electronic-tinged arena rock|magazine=[[The Guardian]]|last=Davies|first=Hannah J|date=June 22, 2017|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial performance==\nAs of May 15, 2018, the song has peaked at number 12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=\"Hot100\"/><ref name=\"No.24\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8252366/drake-gods-plan-hot-100-eighth-week-number-one|title=Drake's 'God's Plan' Tops Billboard Hot 100 for Eighth Week|work=Billboard|last=Trust|first=Gary|date=March 19, 2018|accessdate=March 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Digital download<ref name=\"Spotify\">{{cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/album/0rL2wjUf2m2xi12K4KOY2b|title=Whatever It Takes by Imagine Dragons on Spotify|website=[[Spotify]]|access-date=May 10, 2017}}</ref>\n| title1 = Whatever It Takes\n| length1 = 3:21\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline = CD single<ref>{{cite web|title=Whatever It Takes (2-Track)|url=https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B076L8DG5K|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n| title1 = Whatever It Takes \n| length1 = 3:22\n| title2 = Thunder \n| note2 = official remix\n| length2 = 3:17\n}}\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

The song was released on May 8, 2017, as a promotional single through [[Kidinakorner]] and [[Interscope Records|Interscope]]. It later became the third single from the band's third studio album, ''[[Evolve (Imagine Dragons album)|Evolve]]'', on October 6, 2017. It was also the official theme song for [[World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.|WWE]]'s [[Pay-Per-View|PPV]] event [[Battleground (2017)|Battleground]], in addition to its inclusion in the video game ''[[Madden NFL 18]]''. The song was sent to US [[contemporary hit radio]] on February 13, 2018.\n\n==Background==\nThe song was announced alongside the name and album art of ''[[Evolve (Imagine Dragons album)|Evolve]]'' via Twitter on May 9, 2017.<ref>{{cite news|last=Da'Shan Smith|date=May 9, 2017|title=Imagine Dragons Are Ready to 'Evolve' With Upcoming Album & Tour, Share New Song 'Whatever It Takes'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7791817/imagine-dragons-evolve-new-album-tour-whatever-it-takes|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=May 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2017, they performed the song on ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/VIDEO-Imagine-Dragons-Performs-Whatever-It-Takes-on-LATE-NIGHT-20171031|title=Imagine Dragons Performs 'Whatever It Takes' on LATE NIGHT|work=Broadway World|date=October 31, 2017|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2018, Imagine Dragons asked [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] to stop using \"Whatever It Takes\" on their conference website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kqradio.com/index.php/2018/02/16/imagine-dragons-asks-conservative-group-to-stop-using-whatever-it-takes/|title=Imagine Dragons asks conservative group to stop using \"Whatever It Takes\"|publisher=Q95|date=February 16, 2018|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wixx.com/news/articles/2018/feb/16/imagine-dragons-asks-conservative-group-to-stop-using-whatever-it-takes/|title=Imagine Dragons asks conservative group to stop using \"Whatever It Takes\"|publisher=WIXX 101|date=February 16, 2018|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn May 30, 2018, they performed the song live before game two of the [[2018 Stanley Cup Finals]] at [[T-Mobile Arena]] in their hometown of [[Las Vegas]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Imagine Dragons rock Cup Final before Game 2|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/imagine-dragons-perform-before-stanley-cup-final-game-2/c-298855920|publisher=NHL Enterprises, L.P.|website=NHL.com|date=May 30, 2018|accessdate=January 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA)'s [[Utah Jazz]] frequently play the song prior to tip-off of every home game at [[Vivint Smart Home Arena]] in [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Walden|first=Eric|title=Utah Jazz sleepwalk past Cleveland Cavaliers, 115-99, for sixth straight victory|url=https://www.sltrib.com/sports/2019/01/19/live-jazz-take-cavs/|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=January 19, 2019|access-date=March 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nA music video for the song was released on October 12, 2017. It was directed by [[Matt Eastin]] and Aaron Hymes. Eastin had also previously directed the music videos for Imagine Dragons' songs \"[[On Top of the World (Imagine Dragons song)|On Top of the World]]\", \"[[Roots (Imagine Dragons song)|Roots]]\", and \"[[Believer (Imagine Dragons song)|Believer]]\". The video begins with lead singer [[Dan Reynolds (singer)|Dan Reynolds]] swimming through a room filled with water. It then cuts to a scene in which Reynolds and the band are playing in the same room; however, it is not filled with water in this scene. As they perform the chorus of the song, the roof crumbles and rain starts pouring in. Throughout the video, the rain persists and the room eventually fills completely with water. However, the band still plays. As Reynolds sings, objects such as boxing gloves and keys float by him along with two people who are seemingly sirens, tugging at him from both sides. Before the final chorus, the music stops and the band floats lifelessly on the water. When they break into song again, the stage has completely changed as the room is no longer underwater, but on fire as the band plays on it. As the video ends, everything is on fire and the music stops.<ref>{{cite news|date=October 12, 2017|title=Imagine Dragons - Whatever It Takes|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOsM-DYAEhY|work=[[YouTube]]|access-date=October 12, 2017}}</ref> The video won the [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video]] award.\nIts official music video has received over 673 million views and 4 million likes as of March 2020\n\n==Critical reception==\n''[[The Guardian]]'' writes that \"Whatever It Takes\" was \"written with a sports highlights package in mind (\"I love the adrenaline in my veins\", wails frontman Dan Reynolds, before chart pop's current obligatory chorus of \"woah-ohs\" enters).\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/22/imagine-dragons-evolve-review-lifeless-electronic-tinged-arena-rock|title=Imagine Dragons: Evolve review \u2013 lifeless electronic-tinged arena rock|magazine=[[The Guardian]]|last=Davies|first=Hannah J|date=June 22, 2017|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial performance==\nAs of May 15, 2018, the song has peaked at number 12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=\"Hot100\"/><ref name=\"No.24\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8252366/drake-gods-plan-hot-100-eighth-week-number-one|title=Drake's 'God's Plan' Tops Billboard Hot 100 for Eighth Week|work=Billboard|last=Trust|first=Gary|date=March 19, 2018|accessdate=March 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Digital download<ref name=\"Spotify\">{{cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/album/0rL2wjUf2m2xi12K4KOY2b|title=Whatever It Takes by Imagine Dragons on Spotify|website=[[Spotify]]|access-date=May 10, 2017}}</ref>\n| title1 = Whatever It Takes\n| length1 = 3:21\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline = CD single<ref>{{cite web|title=Whatever It Takes (2-Track)|url=https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B076L8DG5K|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n| title1 = Whatever It Takes \n| length1 = 3:22\n| title2 = Thunder \n| note2 = official remix\n| length2 = 3:17\n}}\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Poland's Institute of National Remembrance (''Instytut Pami\u0119ci Narodowej'', or ''IPN'') had recently been created as an independent successor to the Commission for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes in Poland, formed only after the collapse of the Soviet empire. Its major role was the promotion of historical research on topics that had been banned for over 40 years under communist rule (1945\u201389), including anti-semitic pogroms in Soviet-occupied Poland.\n\nAs its first project, the IPN investigated the Jedwabne pogrom in response to a heated debate among leading historians following the publication, first in the Polish language, of ''S\u0105siedzi'' (English edition, ''Neighbors'', 2001) by the Polish-American historian {{nobreak|[[Jan T.

He said the murderers had been incited by German occupiers, but they alone carried the burden of guilt for their crimes.

Living among us also are Holocaust survivors whose lives were saved as a result of the brave actions of their Polish neighbors,\" he said.

Ignatiew,<ref name=\"Findings\"/> the IPN stated its principal \"Findings of Investigation S 1 / 00 / Zn into the Murder of Polish Citizens of Jewish Origin in the Town of Jedwabne on 10 July 1941\":\n\n* The perpetrators of the crime ''sensu stricto'' were Polish residents of Jedwabne and the environs; responsibility for the crime ''sensu largo'' could be ascribed to the Germans. The IPN found that Poles played a \"decisive role\" in the massacre, but the massacre was \"instigated by the Germans\". The massacre was carried out in full view of the Germans, who were armed and had control of the town, and the Germans did not intervene and halt the killings. IPN wrote: \"The presence of German military policemen... and other uniformed Germans... was tantamount to consent to, and tolerance of, the crime.\"\n* At least 340 Jewish victims were killed in the pogrom, in two groups of which the first contained 40 to 50 men, and the second about 300 persons. The exact number of victims could not be determined. The previously estimated figure of 1,600 was \"highly unlikely, and was not confirmed in the course of the investigation.\"<ref>Antony Polonsky and Joanna B.

The majority of Jedwabne residents were \"utterly passive,\" the IPN found, and did not participate in the massacre. The IPN wrote: \"On the basis of the evidence gathered in the investigation, it is not possible to determine the reasons for the passivity of most of the town in the face of the crime. In particular, it cannot be determined whether this passivity resulted from acceptance of the crime or from intimidation by the brutality of the perpetrators' acts.\"<ref name=\"books.google1\"/><ref>Polonsky and Michlic, ''The Neighbors Respond'', 2004</ref>\n* A number of witnesses had testified that the Germans drove the group of Jewish victims from Jedwabne's town square to the barn where they were killed (these testimonies are found in the expanded 203-page ''Findings'' published in June 2003).  IPN could neither conclusively prove nor disprove these accounts. \"Witness testimonies vary considerably on this question.\"\n* \"A group of Jewish people survived\" the massacre.  Several dozen \u2014 according to several sources, about a hundred \u2014 Jews lived in a ghetto in Jedwabne until November 1942, when they were transferred by the Germans to a ghetto in \u0141om\u017ca, and eventually deported to Treblinka, where they were killed.

Gross writes that \"it is not just a question of character that plays itself out in this drama, but also the logic of incentives one encounters within the totalitarian regimes of the twentieth century\".<ref>''Neighbors'', p.117</ref>\n\nGross recognized that German forces were in Jedwabne during the massacre.<!-- insufficient referencing --> and that German occupying forces had control of the town: \"At the time, the undisputed bosses over life and death in Jedwabne were the Germans.

Big Boss despised his role as figurehead, especially since Zero's vision placed no value on loyalty to ideals and people, something The Boss treasured above all else. When Big Boss learns that his own DNA was being used for Zero's \"Les Enfants Terribles\" project, this proved to be the final straw.

He intends to use MSF to live out The Boss's final will, a world where soldiers are free to choose their own fights on their own terms, and not at the whim of a government. On Colombia's Barranquilla coast, two representatives of the Costa Rican government ([[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Paz|Paz Ortega Andrade]] and [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Zadornov|Ramon G\u00e1lvez Mena]]) seek to hire MSF to liberate Costa Rica from [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Coldman|Coldman]]'s CIA Peace Sentinel unit that has established bases in the country. Snake accepts the mission after G\u00e1lvez hands him an audio cassette with a recording of The Boss's voice. Following Kaz's advice, the MSF takes over an offshore research platform in the Caribbean as their base of operations in a bid to expand the group's capabilities. Over the course of the story, Snake comes to learn about the true purpose of Coldman's [[Metal Gear (weapon)#Peace Walker|Peace Walker]] prototypes (Pupa, Chrysalis, Cocoon, and Peace Walker) and gradually lets go of his guilt for The Boss's death after encountering an AI replica, finally accepting his Big Boss title.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker|year=2010|developer=Kojima Productions|publisher=Konami|quote='''Naked Snake''': I won't make the same choice as her.

After Big Boss killed G\u00e1lvez out of self-defense, Paz pilots ZEKE to launch a nuclear strike on the Eastern Coast of the United States as part of an insurance policy if Big Boss refused to obey [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Cipher|Cipher]]. After hearing the ultimatum, Big Boss refuses and fights ZEKE in order to stop Paz. He is victorious, but ZEKE is heavily damaged and Paz is ejected into the Caribbean Sea. After ZEKE's destruction, Kaz tells Big Boss of being aware of the plot from the beginning, and used it to spur the growth of MSF. Big Boss and Kaz realize they'll no longer be able to be away from the outside world unless they reveal their true nature. Big Boss rejects this idea, stating that his \"life shall be different from The Boss's\". After this conversation, Big Boss gives a speech to the MSF soldiers, telling them that if the times demand it, they will be vigilantes, criminals and terrorists, but they will be the ones to choose their battles and their causes, not governments.\n\nBig Boss plays a central role in ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes]]'' and ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]''. He is on a mission to rescue a [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Chico|child soldier]] and Pacifica Ocean from an American [[black site]] on Cuban soil; Big Boss believes that Pacifica can be converted to MSF's cause. Big Boss's rescue is successful and the medic found a bomb implanted inside Pacifica who is sacrificed to save everyone from another bomb which causes an explosive concussion wave which causes the helicopter to crash into the Caribbean Sea as MSF is destroyed by an [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#XOF|invading paramilitary force]] led by [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Skull Face|Skull Face]]. Big Boss comes out of his coma and poses as \"Ishmael\", a patient in the hospital where [[Venom Snake]] is also being treated, and aids in an escape when the hospital is attacked by Skull Face's forces.

Naked Snake also appears as a playable character in ''[[Super Bomberman R]]''.\n\n==Creation and design==\nIn ''[[Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake]]'', Big Boss's visual appearance was inspired by actor [[Sean Connery]]. But for the ports of the game's re-released version, the original design was replaced by [[Yoji Shinkawa]]'s design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/metal-gear-retrospective?pager.offset=2&cId=|publisher=1UP.com|accessdate=February 18, 2012|author=Parish, Jeremy|title=Gear Up!

But with the differences that unlike Solid Snake, Naked Snake was a rookie and thus acted more naive. Shinkawa stated having no difficulties in designing Naked Snake as basically a revised version of Solid Snake.

Big Boss despised his role as figurehead, especially since Zero's vision placed no value on loyalty to ideals and people, something The Boss treasured above all else. When Big Boss learns that his own DNA was being used for Zero's \"Les Enfants Terribles\" project, this proved to be the final straw.

Big Boss and Kaz realize they'll no longer be able to be away from the outside world unless they reveal their true nature. Big Boss rejects this idea, stating that his \"life shall be different from The Boss's\".
