{"title_page": "Video game design", "text_new": "{{More footnotes|date=February 2018}}\n\n{{Video game industry}}\n'''Video game design''' is the process of designing the content and rules of [[video game]]s in the [[Game development#Pre-production|pre-production stage]]<ref>[[#BrSch|Brathwaite, Schreiber 2009]], p. 2</ref> and designing the gameplay, environment, storyline, and characters in the [[Video game development#Production|production stage]]. The designer of a game is very much like the director of a film; the designer is the visionary of the game and controls the artistic and technical elements of the game in fulfillment of their vision.<ref>[http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=1699 The Making of a Great Modern Game Designer] Glassner, Andrew. ''Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics''.</ref> Video game design requires artistic and technical competence as well as writing skills.<ref>[[#AdRol|Adams, Rollings 2003]], pp. 20, 22-25</ref> As the industry has aged and embraced alternative production methodologies such as agile, the role of a principal game designer has begun to separate - some studios emphasising the auteur model while others emphasising a more team oriented model. Within the [[video game industry]], video game design is usually just referred to as \"[[game design]]\", which is a more general term elsewhere.\n\nVideo game programmers have also sometimes comprised the entire design team. This is the case of such noted designers as [[Sid Meier]], [[John Romero]], [[Chris Sawyer]] and [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]]. A notable exception to this policy was [[Coleco]], which from its very start separated the function of design and programming.\n\nAs games became more complex and [[home computer|computers]] and [[video game console|console]]s became more powerful, the job of the game designer became separate from the lead programmer. Soon game complexity demanded team members focused on game design. Many early veterans chose the game design path eschewing programming and delegating those tasks to others.\n\nWith very complex games, such as [[MMORPG]]s, or a big budget action or sports title, designers may number in the dozens. In these cases, there are generally one or two principal designers and many junior designers who specify subsets or subsystems of the game. In larger companies like [[Electronic Arts]], each aspect of the game (control, level design) may have a separate producer, lead designer and several general designers. They may also come up with a plot for the game.\n\n== Overview ==\n{{see also|Game design}}\n\n<!-- THIS PARAGRAPH IS USED in Game Development article as well, be sure to update. -->Video game design starts with an idea,<ref name=\"Bates3\">[[#Bates|Bates 2004]], p. 3</ref><ref>[[#AdRol|Adams, Rollings 2003]], pp. 29-30</ref><ref>[[#Bethke|Bethke 2003]], p. 75</ref><ref>[[#Chand|Chandler 2009]], p. 3</ref> often a modification on an existing concept.<ref name=\"Bates3\"/><ref>[[#AdRol|Adams, Rollings 2003]], pp. 31-33</ref> The game idea may fall within one or several [[Game genre|genres]]. Designers often experiment with mixing genres.<ref>[[#Bates|Bates 2004]], p. 6</ref><ref>[[#Oxland|Oxland 2004]], p. 25</ref> The game designer usually produces an initial game proposal document containing the concept, gameplay, feature list, setting and story, target audience, requirements and schedule, staff and budget estimates.<ref>[[#Bates|Bates 2004]], pp. 14-16</ref>\n\nMany decisions are made during the course of a game's development about the game's design; it is the responsibility of the designer to decide which elements will be implemented, based on, for example, consistency with the game's vision, budget or hardware limitations.<ref>[[#Bates|Bates 2004]], p. 160</ref> Design changes may have a significant positive or negative impact on required resources.<ref>[[#Bates|Bates 2004]], pp. 160-161</ref>\n\nThe designer may use [[scripting language]]s to implement and preview design ideas without necessarily modifying the game's [[codebase]].<ref>[[#Bates|Bates 2004]], p. 161</ref><ref>[[#Oxland|Oxland 2004]], pp. 297-298</ref>\n\nA game designer often plays video games and demos to follow the game market development.<ref>[[#Bates|Bates 2004]], pp. 161-162</ref>\n\nIt is common for the game designer's name to misleadingly be given an undue amount of association to the game, neglecting the rest of the development team.<ref name=\"Bates 2004, p. 162\">[[#Bates|Bates 2004]], p. 162</ref>\n\nFunding game publishers must be taken into account, who may have specific expectations from a game<ref>[[#Bates|Bates 2004]], p. 12</ref> as most video games are ''market-driven'' \u2014 developed to sell for profit.<ref>[[#AdRol|Adams, Rollings 2003]], pp. 47-48</ref> However, if financial issues do not influence designer's decisions, the game becomes ''design-'' or ''designer-driven''; few games are designed this way because of lack of funding.<ref>[[#AdRol|Adams, Rollings 2003]], pp. 48-49</ref> Alternatively, a game may be ''technology-driven'', such as [[Quake (video game)|Quake]] (1996),<ref name=\"AdRol51\">[[#AdRol|Adams, Rollings 2003]], p. 51</ref> to show off a particular hardware achievement or to market the [[game engine]].<ref name=\"AdRol51\"/> Finally, a game may be ''art-driven'', such as ''[[Myst]]'' (1993),<ref name=\"AdRol52\">[[#AdRol|Adams, Rollings 2003]], p. 52</ref> mainly to show off impressive visuals designed by artists.<ref name=\"AdRol52\"/>\n\nIn ''Rules of Play'' (2004), Katie Salen and Eric Zimmermann write:\n{{cquote|A game designer is a particular kind of designer, much like a graphic designer, industrial designer, or architect.  A game designer is not necessarily a programmer, visual designer, or project manager, although sometimes he or she can also play these roles in the creation of a game.  A game designer might work alone or as part of a larger team. A game designer might create card games, social games, video games, or any other kind of game. The focus of a game designer is designing game play, conceiving and designing rules and structures that result in an experience for players.\n\nThus game design, as a discipline, requires a focus on games in and of themselves. Rather than placing games in the service of another field such as sociology, literary criticism, or computer science, our aim is to study games within their own disciplinary space. Because game design is an emerging discipline, we often borrow from other areas of knowledge \u2014 from mathematics and cognitive science; from semiotics and cultural studies. We may not borrow in the most orthodox manner, but we do so in the service of helping to establish a field of game design proper.}}\n\n== Game designer ==\n\nA game designer is a person who designs [[gameplay]], conceiving and designing the rules and structure of a [[game]].<ref>[[#SalZim|Salem, Zimmerman 2003]]</ref><ref>[[#Oxland|Oxland 2004]], p. 292</ref><ref>[[#MoNov|Moore, Novak 2010]], p. 74</ref> Many designers start their career in testing departments, other roles in game development or in classroom conditions,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyfa.edu/game-design-school/|title=Game Design School in New York & Los Angeles - NYFA|author=|date=|website=www.nyfa.edu}}</ref> where mistakes by others can be seen first-hand.<ref>[[#Bates|Bates 2004]], p. 179</ref>\n\n* '''Lead designer''' coordinates the work of other designers and is the main visionary of the game.<ref>[[#Oxland|Oxland 2004]], pp. 292-296</ref><ref name=\"Bethke40\">[[#Bethke|Bethke 2003]], p. 40</ref> Lead designer ensures team communication, makes large design decisions, and presents design outside of the team.<ref>[[#Oxland|Oxland 2004]], pp. 293-294</ref> Often the lead designer is technically and artistically astute.<ref>[[#Oxland|Oxland 2004]], pp. 294, 295</ref> Keeping well-presented documentation also falls within the lead designer responsibilities.<ref>[[#Oxland|Oxland 2004]], pp. 295-296</ref> Lead designer may be the founder of a game development company or a promoted employee.\n* '''[[Game mechanics]] designer'''<!--as named in ref--> or '''systems designer''' designs and [[game balance|balances]] the game's rules.<ref name=\"Bethke40\"/>\n* '''[[Level designer]]''' or '''environment designer''' is a position becoming prominent in the recent years.<ref name=\"Bates 2004, p. 162\"/> Level designer is the person responsible for creating game environment, [[level (video gaming)|levels]], and missions.<ref name=\"MoNov76\">[[#MoNov|Moore, Novak 2010]], p. 76</ref><ref name=\"ShahArt1\">[[#ShahArt|Shahrani 2006]], part I</ref><ref name=\"Oxland296297\">[[#Oxland|Oxland 2004]], pp. 296-297</ref><ref>[[#Bethke|Bethke 2003]], pp. 40-41</ref>\n\n=== Compensation ===\n\nIn 2010, a game designer with more than six years of experience earned an average of [[United States dollar|US$]]65,000 (GBP {{GBP|44,761.22}}), $54,000 (GBP '''\u00a3'''37,186.24) with three to six years of experience and $44,000 (GBP  '''\u00a3'''30,299.90) with less than 3 years of experience.

It is a map referenced for creation of everything as it shows where it is and allows for the most logistical design in any given game.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== System design ===\nSystem design is the creation of game rules and underlying mathematical patterns.<ref name=\"BrSch5\"/>\n\n=== Content design ===\nContent design is the creation of characters, items, puzzles, and missions.<ref name=\"BrSch5\"/>\n\nA secondary definition of Content design is the creation of any aspect of the game that is not required for the game to function properly and meet the [[minimum viable product]] standard. In essence, content is the complexity added to a minimum viable product to increase its value. An example of this is the item list from Final Fantasy. None of the items are necessary for the game to function, but they add value and complexity to the game as a whole..\n\n=== Game writing ===\n{{Main|Video game writing}}\n\nGame writing involves writing dialogue, text, and story.<ref name=\"BrSch5\"/>\n\nWriting in games also includes the elements in which the literature is presented. Voice acting, text, and music are all elements of game writing.\n\n=== Level design ===\n{{Main|Level design}}\n\nLevel design is the construction of world levels and its features.<ref name=\"MoNov76\"/><ref name=\"ShahArt1\"/><ref name=\"Oxland296297\"/><ref name=\"BrSch5\"/>\n\nLevel design makes use of many different fields to create a game world. Lighting, space, framing, color and contrast are used to draw a player's attention. A designer can then use these elements to guide or direct the player in a specific direction through the game world, or mislead them\n\n=== User interface design ===\nUser interface (UI) design deals with the construction the user interactions and feedback interface, like [[menu (computing)|menus]] or [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up displays]].<ref name=\"BrSch5\"/>\n\nThe user interface also incorporates game mechanics design. Deciding how much information to give the player and in what way allows the designer to inform the player about the world, or perhaps leave them uninformed. Another aspect to consider is the method of input a game will use and deciding to what degree a player can interact with a game with these inputs. These choices have a profound effect on the mood of the game, as it directly affects the player in both noticeable and subtle ways.\n\nUser interface design in video games has unique goals. A conscious decision has to be made regarding the amount of information to relay to the player. However, the UI in games do not have to be absolutely streamlined. Players expect challenges and are willing to accept them as long as the experience is sufficiently rewarding. By the same token, navigating or interaction with a game's UI can be satisfying without the need to be effortless.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@ludwidium/design-principles-face-off-ux-versus-game-design-526e99ad41ab|title=Design principles face-off: UX versus Game Design|last=G|first=Luis Miguel Bello|date=2017-09-25|website=Luis Miguel Bello G.|access-date=2017-12-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Audio design ===\nAudio design involves the process of creating or incorporating all of the sounds that are in the game, like music, [[sound effects]] or [[voice acting]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n=== User experience design ===\nThe disciplines listed above all combine to form the discipline of [[game feel]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} It ensures that the flow of the game and the user interaction with the game elements are functioning smoothly.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Game elements ==\n<!--\n=== Setting ===\n Andrew/Rollings 36 -->\n\n=== Narrative ===\n{{Further|Narrative designer}}\nNumerous games have narrative elements which give a context to an event in a game, making the activity of playing it less abstract and enhance its entertainment value, although narrative elements are not always clearly present or present at all. The original version of ''[[Tetris]]'' is an example of a game apparently without narrative. Some{{Who|date=March 2010}} [[narratology|narratologists]] claim that all games have a narrative element. Some go further and claim that games are essentially a form of narrative. Narrative in practice can be the starting point for the development of a game, or can be added to a design that started as a set of game mechanics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n=== Gameplay ===\n{{further|Gameplay}}\n\nGameplay is the interactive aspects of video game design. Gameplay involves player interaction with the game, usually for the purpose of entertainment, education or training.\n\n== Design process ==\n\nThe design process varies from designer to designer and companies have different formal procedures and philosophies.<ref>[[#Bates|Bates 2004]], p. 151</ref>\n\nThe typical \"textbook\" approach is to start with a concept or a previously completed game and from there create a [[game design document]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} This document is intended to map out the complete game design and acts as a central resource for the development team. This document should ideally be updated as the game evolves throughout the production process.\n\nDesigners are frequently expected to adapt to multiple roles of widely varying nature: For example, concept prototyping can be assisted with the use of pre-existing engines and tools like [[GameMaker Studio]], [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]], [[Godot (game engine)|Godot]], or [[Construct (game engine)|Construct]]. Level designs might be done first on paper and again for the game engine using a 3D modelling tool. Scripting languages are used for many elements\u2014AI, cutscenes, GUI, environmental processes, and many other behaviours and effects\u2014that designers would want to tune without a programmer's assistance. Setting, story and character concepts require a research and writing process. Designers may oversee focus testing, write up art and audio asset lists, and write game documentation. In addition to the skillset, designers are ideally clear communicators with attention to detail and ability to delegate responsibilities appropriately.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nDesign approval{{Clarify|date=March 2010|reason=first mention}} in the commercial setting is a continuous process from the earliest stages until the game ships.\n\nWhen a new project is being discussed (either internally, or as a result of dialogue with potential publishers), the designer may be asked to write a sell-sheet of short concepts, followed by a one or two-page pitch of specific features, audience, platform, and other details. Designers will first meet with leads in other departments to establish agreement on the feasibility of the game given the available time, scope, and budget. If the pitch is approved, early milestones focus on the creation of a fleshed-out design document. Some developers advocate a prototyping phase before the design document is written to experiment with new ideas before they become part of the design.{{Original research inline|date=March 2010}}\n\nAs production progresses, designers are asked to make frequent decisions about elements missing from the design. The consequences of these decisions are hard to predict and often can only be determined after creating the full implementation. These are referred to as the ''unknowns'' of the design, and the faster they are uncovered, the less risk the team faces later in the production process. Outside factors such as budget cuts or changes in milestone expectations also result in cuts to the design, and while overly large cuts can take the heart out of a project, cuts can also result in a streamlined design with only the essential features, polished well.{{Original research inline|date=March 2010}}\n\nTowards the end of production, designers take the brunt of responsibility for ensuring that the gameplay remains at a uniform standard throughout the game, even in very long games. This task is made more difficult under \"crunch\" conditions, as the entire team may begin to lose sight of the core gameplay once pressured to hit a date for a finished and bug-free game.{{Original research inline|date=March 2010}}\n\n==Game Design Tools==\nTraditionally, game designers used simple tools like Word, Excel or just plain pen and paper.

''Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics''.</ref> Video game design requires artistic and technical competence as well as writing skills.<ref>[[#AdRol|Adams, Rollings 2003]], pp. 20, 22-25</ref> As the industry has aged and embraced alternative production methodologies such as agile, the role of a principal game designer has begun to separate - some studios emphasising the auteur model while others emphasising a more team oriented model. Within the [[video game industry]], video game design is usually just referred to as \"[[game design]]\", which is a more general term elsewhere.\n\nVideo game programmers have also sometimes comprised the entire design team. This is the case of such noted designers as [[Sid Meier]], [[John Romero]], [[Chris Sawyer]] and [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]]. A notable exception to this policy was [[Coleco]], which from its very start separated the function of design and programming.\n\nAs games became more complex and [[home computer|computers]] and [[video game console|console]]s became more powerful, the job of the game designer became separate from the lead programmer. Soon game complexity demanded team members focused on game design. Many early veterans chose the game design path eschewing programming and delegating those tasks to others.\n\nWith very complex games, such as [[MMORPG]]s, or a big budget action or sports title, designers may number in the dozens. In these cases, there are generally one or two principal designers and many junior designers who specify subsets or subsystems of the game. In larger companies like [[Electronic Arts]], each aspect of the game (control, level design) may have a separate producer, lead designer and several general designers. They may also come up with a plot for the game.\n\n== Overview ==\n{{see also|Game design}}\n\n<!-- THIS PARAGRAPH IS USED in Game Development article as well, be sure to update. -->Video game design starts with an idea,<ref name=\"Bates3\">[[#Bates|Bates 2004]], p. 3</ref><ref>[[#AdRol|Adams, Rollings 2003]], pp. 29-30</ref><ref>[[#Bethke|Bethke 2003]], p. 75</ref><ref>[[#Chand|Chandler 2009]], p. 3</ref> often a modification on an existing concept.<ref name=\"Bates3\"/><ref>[[#AdRol|Adams, Rollings 2003]], pp. 31-33</ref> The game idea may fall within one or several [[Game genre|genres]].

A game designer is not necessarily a programmer, visual designer, or project manager, although sometimes he or she can also play these roles in the creation of a game.  A game designer might work alone or as part of a larger team. A game designer might create card games, social games, video games, or any other kind of game. The focus of a game designer is designing game play, conceiving and designing rules and structures that result in an experience for players.\n\nThus game design, as a discipline, requires a focus on games in and of themselves. Rather than placing games in the service of another field such as sociology, literary criticism, or computer science, our aim is to study games within their own disciplinary space. Because game design is an emerging discipline, we often borrow from other areas of knowledge \u2014 from mathematics and cognitive science; from semiotics and cultural studies. We may not borrow in the most orthodox manner, but we do so in the service of helping to establish a field of game design proper.}}\n\n== Game designer ==\n\nA game designer is a person who designs [[gameplay]], conceiving and designing the rules and structure of a [[game]].<ref>[[#SalZim|Salem, Zimmerman 2003]]</ref><ref>[[#Oxland|Oxland 2004]], p. 292</ref><ref>[[#MoNov|Moore, Novak 2010]], p. 74</ref> Many designers start their career in testing departments, other roles in game development or in classroom conditions,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyfa.edu/game-design-school/|title=Game Design School in New York & Los Angeles - NYFA|author=|date=|website=www.nyfa.edu}}</ref> where mistakes by others can be seen first-hand.<ref>[[#Bates|Bates 2004]], p. 179</ref>\n\n* '''Lead designer''' coordinates the work of other designers and is the main visionary of the game.<ref>[[#Oxland|Oxland 2004]], pp. 292-296</ref><ref name=\"Bethke40\">[[#Bethke|Bethke 2003]], p. 40</ref> Lead designer ensures team communication, makes large design decisions, and presents design outside of the team.<ref>[[#Oxland|Oxland 2004]], pp. 293-294</ref> Often the lead designer is technically and artistically astute.<ref>[[#Oxland|Oxland 2004]], pp. 294, 295</ref> Keeping well-presented documentation also falls within the lead designer responsibilities.<ref>[[#Oxland|Oxland 2004]], pp. 295-296</ref> Lead designer may be the founder of a game development company or a promoted employee.\n* '''[[Game mechanics]] designer'''<!--as named in ref--> or '''systems designer''' designs and [[game balance|balances]] the game's rules.<ref name=\"Bethke40\"/>\n* '''[[Level designer]]''' or '''environment designer''' is a position becoming prominent in the recent years.<ref name=\"Bates 2004, p. 162\"/> Level designer is the person responsible for creating game environment, [[level (video gaming)|levels]], and missions.<ref name=\"MoNov76\">[[#MoNov|Moore, Novak 2010]], p. 76</ref><ref name=\"ShahArt1\">[[#ShahArt|Shahrani 2006]], part I</ref><ref name=\"Oxland296297\">[[#Oxland|Oxland 2004]], pp. 296-297</ref><ref>[[#Bethke|Bethke 2003]], pp. 40-41</ref>\n\n=== Compensation ===\n\nIn 2010, a game designer with more than six years of experience earned an average of [[United States dollar|US$]]65,000 (GBP {{GBP|44,761.22}}), $54,000 (GBP '''\u00a3'''37,186.24) with three to six years of experience and $44,000 (GBP  '''\u00a3'''30,299.90) with less than 3 years of experience.

In essence, content is the complexity added to a minimum viable product to increase its value. An example of this is the item list from Final Fantasy. None of the items are necessary for the game to function, but they add value and complexity to the game as a whole..\n\n=== Game writing ===\n{{Main|Video game writing}}\n\nGame writing involves writing dialogue, text, and story.<ref name=\"BrSch5\"/>\n\nWriting in games also includes the elements in which the literature is presented. Voice acting, text, and music are all elements of game writing.\n\n=== Level design ===\n{{Main|Level design}}\n\nLevel design is the construction of world levels and its features.<ref name=\"MoNov76\"/><ref name=\"ShahArt1\"/><ref name=\"Oxland296297\"/><ref name=\"BrSch5\"/>\n\nLevel design makes use of many different fields to create a game world. Lighting, space, framing, color and contrast are used to draw a player's attention. A designer can then use these elements to guide or direct the player in a specific direction through the game world, or mislead them\n\n=== User interface design ===\nUser interface (UI) design deals with the construction the user interactions and feedback interface, like [[menu (computing)|menus]] or [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up displays]].<ref name=\"BrSch5\"/>\n\nThe user interface also incorporates game mechanics design. Deciding how much information to give the player and in what way allows the designer to inform the player about the world, or perhaps leave them uninformed. Another aspect to consider is the method of input a game will use and deciding to what degree a player can interact with a game with these inputs. These choices have a profound effect on the mood of the game, as it directly affects the player in both noticeable and subtle ways.\n\nUser interface design in video games has unique goals. A conscious decision has to be made regarding the amount of information to relay to the player. However, the UI in games do not have to be absolutely streamlined. Players expect challenges and are willing to accept them as long as the experience is sufficiently rewarding. By the same token, navigating or interaction with a game's UI can be satisfying without the need to be effortless.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@ludwidium/design-principles-face-off-ux-versus-game-design-526e99ad41ab|title=Design principles face-off: UX versus Game Design|last=G|first=Luis Miguel Bello|date=2017-09-25|website=Luis Miguel Bello G.|access-date=2017-12-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Audio design ===\nAudio design involves the process of creating or incorporating all of the sounds that are in the game, like music, [[sound effects]] or [[voice acting]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n=== User experience design ===\nThe disciplines listed above all combine to form the discipline of [[game feel]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} It ensures that the flow of the game and the user interaction with the game elements are functioning smoothly.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Game elements ==\n<!--\n=== Setting ===\n Andrew/Rollings 36 -->\n\n=== Narrative ===\n{{Further|Narrative designer}}\nNumerous games have narrative elements which give a context to an event in a game, making the activity of playing it less abstract and enhance its entertainment value, although narrative elements are not always clearly present or present at all.

Jeppe High School for Boys is the oldest known school in [[Johannesburg]].\n\n== History ==\nSt. Michael's College was the predecessor of all the Jeppe Schools. This was an Anglican private school on the corner of Commissioner and Crowns Street in Fairview. There were 25 students when the school first opened. The headmaster of the school was Rev. H B Sidwell. His successor was Rev. George Perry, in 1891.<ref name=\"jeppeboys.co.za\">http://www.jeppeboys.co.za</ref>\n\nThe buildings of the college and the site on which its grounds lay were bought by the Witwatersrand Council for education, in 1896, as the school was struggling to function. The school was re-opened, in April 1897, by the council as Jeppestown Grammar School. 15 boys enrolled into the school and the first headmaster of the school was Mr. H Hardwick. However, school financial issues forced the council to reduce its disbursement. As a result, Mr. Hardwick and the rest of the school's staff were given notice. On 1 October 1898, a group of Jeppestown parents bought the school from the council for \u00a32,500. The staff had been replaced, but Mr. Hardwick remained the headmaster of the school.<ref name=\"jeppeboys.co.za\"/>\n\nIn 1899, at the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer War, with the number of students slowly decreasing, the school was forced to close down. Mr. Harwick left in September 1899.<ref name=\"jeppeboys.co.za\"/>\n\nThe school re-opened, after the war, as Jeppestown High School for Girls and Boys using land donated by Sir Julius Jeppe.<ref name=\"jeppeboys.co.za\"/> It was opened in the same building of the Grammar School, and was one of the first co-educational schools, opened by the Transvaal Education Department (T.E.D). The precise date of the re-opening is unknown, however it is believed to have been during the first quarter of the year 1902, as a letter sent to the Department of Education by the school, about the teachers being unwilling to teach under the conditions of an unfinished building as well as there not being enough space for the number of children, was sent on 9 April of that year.<ref name=\"jeppeboys.co.za\"/>\n\nThe Parents' Committee experienced financial hardships at the same time as the school's construction. In September 1902, the Education Department was presented with an ultimatum, which stated that either they purchase the premises or vacate it, by October that year. The Public Works Department advised that purchase be made, until a new school building could be constructed.<ref name=\"jeppeboys.co.za\"/>\n\nThe new headmaster of the school, in 1902, was Mr. C D Hope. He remained headmaster until he left in 1904 to found a fellow \"Milner School\", [[Potchefstroom High School for Boys]]. He was succeeded by Mr. J H Payne, who became a staff member in 1902 and remained headmaster until his death, in 1917, during his service in the First World War (170 boys and staff members lost their lives to the border conflicts and two World Wars).<ref name=\"jeppeboys.co.za\"/>  Mr. Payne acquired the building that the Jeppe Boys students currently occupy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeppegirls.co.za/about-us/history/|title=History|work=Jeppe High School for Girls|accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy 1912 the new school's grounds were not sufficient enough for the accumulating number of pupils at the school. Owing to the boys out-numbering the girls, and pressure from the Governing Body of the school, who were against the co-educational system of the school, it was decided that the girls would be moved to other premises.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeppegirls.co.za|title=Jeppe High School for Girls \u2014|work=Jeppe High School for Girls|accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref> The split would occur in 1919.<ref name=\"Shorten\">{{cite book | title=The Johannesburg Saga | publisher=John R.

One side of the dome is used for \"recruiting\" and the other as the school museum. Alongside the dome can be found the names of boys who died during the war while still attending the school. The dome also features a plinth with the names of staff and pupils who lost their lives in [[World War I|The Great War]].  Mr. James Humphrey Allen Payne, who was a headmaster at the school, died of a fever in 1917 while serving in the war. The second hall in the school is named after him.\n\nWhen the school celebrated its centenary in 1986, the First World War Memorial, which was opened by field Marshal Jan Smuts, was declared a national monument.<ref>[http://www.allatsea.co.za/blog/jeppe-boys-high-school-war-memorial-johannesburg/] War Memorial</ref>\n[[File:jeppe war memorial.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\n== Buildings and facilities ==\n\n=== Hostel ===\n\nIn 1912, Oribi House, the oldest hostel, was built.

Jeppe High School for Boys is the oldest known school in [[Johannesburg]].\n\n== History ==\nSt. Michael's College was the predecessor of all the Jeppe Schools. This was an Anglican private school on the corner of Commissioner and Crowns Street in Fairview. There were 25 students when the school first opened. The headmaster of the school was Rev. H B Sidwell. His successor was Rev. George Perry, in 1891.<ref name=\"jeppeboys.co.za\">http://www.jeppeboys.co.za</ref>\n\nThe buildings of the college and the site on which its grounds lay were bought by the Witwatersrand Council for education, in 1896, as the school was struggling to function. The school was re-opened, in April 1897, by the council as Jeppestown Grammar School. 15 boys enrolled into the school and the first headmaster of the school was Mr. H Hardwick. However, school financial issues forced the council to reduce its disbursement. As a result, Mr. Hardwick and the rest of the school's staff were given notice. On 1 October 1898, a group of Jeppestown parents bought the school from the council for \u00a32,500. The staff had been replaced, but Mr. Hardwick remained the headmaster of the school.<ref name=\"jeppeboys.co.za\"/>\n\nIn 1899, at the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer War, with the number of students slowly decreasing, the school was forced to close down. Mr. Harwick left in September 1899.<ref name=\"jeppeboys.co.za\"/>\n\nThe school re-opened, after the war, as Jeppestown High School for Girls and Boys using land donated by Sir Julius Jeppe.<ref name=\"jeppeboys.co.za\"/> It was opened in the same building of the Grammar School, and was one of the first co-educational schools, opened by the Transvaal Education Department (T.E.D). The precise date of the re-opening is unknown, however it is believed to have been during the first quarter of the year 1902, as a letter sent to the Department of Education by the school, about the teachers being unwilling to teach under the conditions of an unfinished building as well as there not being enough space for the number of children, was sent on 9 April of that year.<ref name=\"jeppeboys.co.za\"/>\n\nThe Parents' Committee experienced financial hardships at the same time as the school's construction. In September 1902, the Education Department was presented with an ultimatum, which stated that either they purchase the premises or vacate it, by October that year. The Public Works Department advised that purchase be made, until a new school building could be constructed.<ref name=\"jeppeboys.co.za\"/>\n\nThe new headmaster of the school, in 1902, was Mr. C D Hope. He remained headmaster until he left in 1904 to found a fellow \"Milner School\", [[Potchefstroom High School for Boys]]. He was succeeded by Mr. J H Payne, who became a staff member in 1902 and remained headmaster until his death, in 1917, during his service in the First World War (170 boys and staff members lost their lives to the border conflicts and two World Wars).<ref name=\"jeppeboys.co.za\"/>  Mr. Payne acquired the building that the Jeppe Boys students currently occupy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeppegirls.co.za/about-us/history/|title=History|work=Jeppe High School for Girls|accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy 1912 the new school's grounds were not sufficient enough for the accumulating number of pupils at the school. Owing to the boys out-numbering the girls, and pressure from the Governing Body of the school, who were against the co-educational system of the school, it was decided that the girls would be moved to other premises.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeppegirls.co.za|title=Jeppe High School for Girls \u2014|work=Jeppe High School for Girls|accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref> The split would occur in 1919.<ref name=\"Shorten\">{{cite book | title=The Johannesburg Saga | publisher=John R.

One side of the dome is used for \"recruiting\" and the other as the school museum. Alongside the dome can be found the names of boys who died during the war while still attending the school. The dome also features a plinth with the names of staff and pupils who lost their lives in [[World War I|The Great War]].  Mr. James Humphrey Allen Payne, who was a headmaster at the school, died of a fever in 1917 while serving in the war. The second hall in the school is named after him.\n\nWhen the school celebrated its centenary in 1986, the First World War Memorial, which was opened by field Marshal Jan Smuts, was declared a national monument.<ref>[http://www.allatsea.co.za/blog/jeppe-boys-high-school-war-memorial-johannesburg/] War Memorial</ref>\n[[File:jeppe war memorial.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\n== Buildings and facilities ==\n\n=== Hostel ===\n\nIn 1912, Oribi House, the oldest hostel, was built.

In the early 1960s, ''Friedenheim'' was declared unsafe to occupy and was demolished. Roan House and Sable House are the oldest buildings on the property.<ref name=\"jeppeboys.co.za\"/>\n\n== Main gates ==\n\nThe main gates to the school are dedicated to FWB von Linsingen and AS Dashwood who were both killed in action in Bardia on 31 December 1941.\n\n== World War II Rolls of Honour ==\n\nTwo World War II plaques are situated in the foyer of the school's main hall.

A separate code, the [[25-pair color code]], is used to identify wires in some [[telecommunication]]s cables. Different codes are used for wire leads on devices such as transformers or in building wiring.\n\n==History==\n{{anchor|RMA|RTMA|RETMA|EIA|IEC}}\n[[File:ResistorColorCodeGuide.jpg|thumb|[[Radio Manufacturers Association|RMA]] resistor color code guide, ca. 1945\u20131950]]\nBefore industry standards were established, each manufacturer used their own unique system for color coding or marking their components.\n\nIn the 1920s,{{Citation needed|date=November 2019|reason=Please help nail down the exact year of the RMA resistor color specification. It's in the range of 1924 to 1930.}} the '''RMA resistor color code''' was developed by the [[Radio Manufacturers Association]] (RMA) as a fixed resistor coloring code marking.  In 1930, the first [[Radio receiver|radio]]s with RMA color coded resistors were built.<ref name=\"ARH_1932_1\"/><ref name=\"ARH_1932_2\"/> Over many decades, as the organization name changed (RMA, RTMA, RETMA, [[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]])<ref name=\"JEDEC_EIA\"/> so was the name of the code. Though known most recent as '''EIA color code''', the four name variations are found in books, magazines, catalogs, and other documents over more than {{Years ago|1930}} years.\n\nIn 1952, it was standardized in [[IEC 62:1952]] by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) and since 1963 also published as '''EIA RS-279'''.<ref name=\"EIA_RS-279\"/> Originally only meant to be used for fixed resistors, the color code was extended to also cover capacitors with [[IEC 62:1968]]. The code was adopted by many national standards like [[DIN 40825]] (1973), [[BS 1852]] (1974) and [[IS 8186]] (1976). The current international standard defining marking codes for resistors and capacitors is [[IEC 60062:2016]]<ref name=\"IEC_60062_2016\"/> and [[EN 60062:2016]]. In addition to the color code, these standards define a letter and digit code named [[RKM code]] for resistors and capacitors.\n\nColor bands were used because they were easily and cheaply printed on tiny components. However, there were drawbacks, especially for [[Color blindness|color blind]] people. Overheating of a component or dirt accumulation may make it impossible to distinguish brown from red or orange. Advances in printing technology have now made printed numbers more practical on small components. The values of components in [[surface mount]] packages are marked with printed alphanumeric codes instead of a color code.\n\n==Resistors==\n{{anchor|Resistor code}}\n[[Image:Preferred values 05 Pengo.svg|thumb|One decade of the [[E12 series]] (there are twelve preferred values per decade of values) shown with their electronic color codes on [[resistor]]s]]\n[[Image:0-ohm.jpg|thumb|A [[Zero-ohm link|0&nbsp;\u03a9 resistor]] (zero ohm), marked with a single black band]]\n\nTo distinguish left from right there is a gap between the C and D bands:\n[[Image:Resistor bands.svg|A diagram of a resistor, with four color bands A, B, C, D from left to right]]\n[[Image:4-Band Resistor.svg|A diagram of a 2.7&nbsp;M\u03a9 color-coded resistor.]]\n{{ordered list\n | list-style-type=upper-alpha\n | The first significant figure of component value (left side)\n | The second significant figure (some precision resistors have a third significant figure, and thus five bands).\n | The decimal multiplier (number of trailing zeroes)\n | If present, indicates tolerance of value in percent (no band means 20%)\n}}\n\nIn the above example, a resistor with bands of red, violet, green, and brown has first digit 2 (red; see table below), second digit 7 (violet), followed by 5 (green) zeroes: {{val|2,700,000|u=ohms}}. Gold signifies that the tolerance is \u00b15%.\n\nResistors manufactured for military use may also include a fifth band which indicates component failure rate ([[Reliability engineering|reliability]]); refer to [[MIL-HDBK]]-199<ref name=\"MIL_HDBK_199C\"/> for further details.\n\nTight tolerance resistors may have three bands for significant figures rather than two, or an additional band indicating [[temperature coefficient]], in units of [[parts per million|ppm]]/[[Kelvin|K]].\n\nAll coded components have at least two value bands and a multiplier; other bands are optional.\n\nThe standard color code per [[IEC 60062:2016]] is as follows:\n{{Electronic colour code}}\nResistors use various [[E series of preferred numbers#Lists|E series of preferred numbers]] for their specific values, which are determined by their [[tolerance (engineering)|tolerance]]. These values repeat for every decade of magnitude: ... 0.68, 6.8, 68, 680, ... For resistors of 20% tolerance the E6 series, with six values: 10, 15, 22, 33, 47, 68, then 100, 150, ... is used; each value is approximately the previous value multiplied by {{radic|10|6}}. For 10% tolerance resistors the E12 series, with {{radic|10|12}} as multiplier, is used; similar schemes up to E192, for 0.5% or tighter tolerance are used. The separation between the values is related to the tolerance so that adjacent values at the extremes of tolerance approximately just overlap; for example, in the E6 series {{nobr|10 + 20%}} is 12, while {{nobr|15 \u2212 20%}} is also 12.\n\n[[Zero ohm resistor]]s, marked with a single black band,<ref name=\"NZO_NIC\"/> are lengths of wire wrapped in a resistor-like body which can be mounted on a [[printed-circuit board]] (PCB) by automatic component-insertion equipment. They are typically used on PCBs as insulating \"bridges\" where two traces would otherwise cross, or as soldered-in [[Jumper (computing)|jumper]] wires for setting configurations.\n\n=== Body-end-dot system ===\nThe \"body-end-dot\" or \"body-tip-spot\" system was used for cylindrical composition resistors sometimes still found in very old equipment; the first band was given by the body color, the second band by the color of one end of the resistor, and the multiplier by a dot or band around the middle of the resistor. The other end of the resistor was in the body color, silver, or gold for 20%, 10%, 5% tolerance (tighter tolerances were not routinely used).<ref name=\"FTRC_1946\"/><ref name=\"BTS\"/><ref name=\"RMA\"/><ref name=\"Antique_Resistor\"/>\n\n===Examples===\n[[Image:Resistors color code.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Example color-coded resistors]]\nFrom top to bottom:\n* Green, blue, black, black, brown\n** 560&nbsp;ohms \u00b11%\n* Red, red, orange, gold\n** {{val|22000|u=ohms}} \u00b15%\n* Yellow, violet, brown, gold\n** 470&nbsp;ohms \u00b15%\n* Blue, grey, black, gold\n** 68&nbsp;ohms \u00b15%\n\nThe physical size of a resistor is indicative of the [[power (physics)|power]] it can dissipate.\n\nThere is an important difference between the use of three and of four bands to indicate resistance. The same resistance is encoded by:\n*Red, red, ''orange'' = ''22'' followed by ''3'' zeroes = {{val|22000}} (excluding default, silver, or gold tolerance)\n*Red, red, ''black'', ''red'' = ''220'' followed by ''2'' zeroes = {{val|22000}} (excluding brown or other band for tolerance)\n\n===Mnemonics===\n{{Further|List of electronic color code mnemonics}}\n\nA useful [[mnemonic]] matches the first letter of the color code, in numeric order. Here are two that include tolerance codes gold, silver, and none:\n* '''B'''ad '''B'''eer '''R'''ots '''O'''ut '''Y'''our '''G'''uts '''B'''ut '''V'''odka '''G'''oes '''W'''ell \u2013 '''G'''et '''S'''ome '''N'''ow.<ref name=\"Campbell_BUCD\"/>\n*'''B'''lack '''B'''ears '''R'''uined '''O'''ur '''Y'''oung '''G'''reen '''B'''erry '''V'''ines '''G'''rowing '''W'''ild \u2013 '''G'''randma '''S'''aid '''N'''ervously.\n* '''B''' '''B''' '''ROY''' of '''G'''reat '''B'''ritain had a '''V'''ery '''G'''ood '''W'''ife who wore '''G'''old and '''S'''ilver '''N'''ecklace.<ref name=\"Dhir_1999\"/>\nThe colors are sorted with ascending values in the order of the [[visible light spectrum]] to make them easy to remember and to reduce the significance of possible read errors due to color shifts and fading over time<!-- except for the tolerance ring -->: red (2), orange (3), yellow (4), green (5), blue (6), violet (7). Black (0) has no energy, brown (1) has a little more, white (9) has everything and grey (8) is like white, but less intense.<ref name=\"Clement\"/>\n\n=={{anchor|Capacitor code}}Capacitors==\nCapacitors may be marked with 4 or more colored bands or dots. The colors encode the first and second most significant digits of the value in picofarads, and the third color the decimal multiplier. Additional bands have meanings which may vary from one type to another. Low-tolerance capacitors may begin with the first 3 (rather than 2) digits of the value. It is usually, but not always, possible to work out what scheme is used by the particular colors used. Cylindrical capacitors marked with bands may look like resistors.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Color\n! Significant digits\n! Multiplier\n!

This style of capacitor was used in vacuum-tube equipment.]]\nCapacitors of the rectangular \"postage stamp\" form made for military use during World War II used ''[[American War Standard]]'' (AWS) or ''[[Joint Army-Navy]]'' (JAN) coding in six dots stamped on the capacitor. An arrow on the top row of dots pointed to the right, indicating the reading order. From left to right the top dots were: either black, indicating JAN [[mica capacitor|mica]], or silver, indicating AWS paper; first significant digit; and second significant digit. The bottom three dots indicated temperature characteristic, tolerance, and decimal multiplier. The characteristic was black for {{val|\u00b11000|u=ppm/\u00b0C}}, brown for \u00b1500, red for \u00b1200, orange for \u00b1100, yellow for \u221220 to +100&nbsp;ppm/\u00b0C, and green for 0 to +70&nbsp;ppm/\u00b0C.\n\nA similar six-dot code by EIA had the top row as first, second and third significant digits and the bottom row as voltage rating (in hundreds of volts; no color indicated 500 volts), tolerance, and multiplier. A three-dot EIA code was used for 500 volt 20% tolerance capacitors, and the dots signified first and second significant digits and the multiplier. Such capacitors were common in [[vacuum tube]] equipment and in surplus for a generation after the war but are unavailable now.<ref name=\"ARRL77\"/>\n\n=={{anchor|Inductor code}}Inductors==\nStandards IEC&nbsp;60062&nbsp;/ EN&nbsp;60062 do not define a color code for [[inductor]]s, but manufacturers of small inductors use the resistor color code, typically encoding [[inductance]] in microhenries.<ref name=\"TDK_Inductors\"/> A white tolerance ring may{{weasel inline|date=September 2019}} indicate custom specifications.<ref name=\"TDK_Inductors\"/>\n\n==Diodes==\nThe part number for small [[JEDEC]] \"1N\"-coded diodes\u2014in the form \"1N4148\"\u2014is sometimes encoded as three or four rings in the standard color code, omitting the \"1N\" prefix. The [[1N4148 signal diode|1N4148]] would then be coded as yellow (4), brown (1), yellow (4), grey (8).\n\n==Wire==\n\n===Transformer===\nPower [[transformer]]s used in North American vacuum-tube equipment were often color-coded to identify the leads. Black was the primary connection, red secondary for the B+ (plate voltage), red with a yellow tracer was the [[center tap]] for the B+ full-wave rectifier winding, green or brown was the heater voltage for all tubes, yellow was the filament voltage for the rectifier tube (often a different voltage than other tube heaters). Two wires of each color were provided for each circuit, and phasing was not identified by the color code.\n\nAudio transformers for vacuum tube equipment were coded blue for the finishing lead of the primary, red for the B+ lead of the primary, brown for a primary center tap, green for the finishing lead of the secondary, black for grid lead of the secondary, and yellow for a tapped secondary. Each lead had a different color since relative polarity or phase was more important for these transformers. Intermediate-frequency tuned transformers were coded blue and red for the primary and green and black for the secondary.<ref name=\"ARRL77\"/>\n\n===Other===\nWires may be color-coded to identify their function, voltage class, polarity, phase or to identify the circuit in which they are used. The insulation of the wire may be solidly colored, or where more combinations are needed, one or two tracer stripes may be added. Some wiring color codes are set by national regulations, but often a color code is specific to a manufacturer or industry.\n\n[[Building wiring]] under the US [[National Electrical Code]] and the [[Canadian Electrical Code]] is identified by colors to show energized and neutral conductors, grounding conductors and to identify phases. Other color codes are used in the UK and other areas to identify building wiring or flexible cable wiring.\n\nMains electrical wiring, both in a building and on equipment was once usually red for live, black for neutral, and green for earth, but this was changed as it was a hazard for color-blind people, who might confuse red and green; different countries use different conventions. Red and black are frequently used for positive and negative of battery or other single-voltage DC wiring.\n\n[[Thermocouple]] wires and extension cables are identified by color code for the type of thermocouple; interchanging thermocouples with unsuitable extension wires destroys the accuracy of the measurement.\n\nAutomotive wiring is color-coded but standards vary by manufacturer; differing [[SAE International|SAE]] and [[DIN]] standards exist.\n\nModern [[personal computer]] peripheral cables and connectors are [[PC connector colors|color-coded]] to simplify connection of speakers, microphones, mice, keyboards and other peripherals, usually according to coloring schemes following recommendations such as [[PC System Design Guide]], [[PoweredUSB]], [[ATX]], etc.\n\nA common convention for wiring systems in industrial buildings is: black jacket \u2013 AC less than {{val|1000|u=volts|fmt=commas}}, blue jacket \u2013 DC or communications, orange jacket \u2013 medium voltage {{val|2300|fmt=commas}} or {{val|4160|u=V|fmt=commas}}, red jacket {{val|13800|u=V|fmt=commas}} or higher. Red-jacketed cable is also used for relatively low-voltage [[fire alarm]] wiring, but has a much different appearance.\n\nLocal area network cables may also have non-standardised jacket colors identifying, for example, process control network vs. office automation networks, or to identify redundant network connections, but these codes vary by organization and facility.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Electronic color code}}\n* [[E series of preferred numbers]] (IEC 60063) \u2014 series of preferred resistance and capacitance values\n* [[Color code]]\n* [[Electrical wiring]] \u2014 AC power wiring inside buildings, including standard color codes\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_Tolerance\">\u00b15% or \u00b10.5&nbsp;pF, whichever is greater.</ref>\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"ARH_1932_1\">{{cite journal |title=Color coding |journal=[[Service - A Monthly Digest of Radio and Allied Maintenance]] |date=April 1932 |volume=1 |number=3 |editor-first1=John F. |editor-last1=Rider |editor-link1=John F.

A separate code, the [[25-pair color code]], is used to identify wires in some [[telecommunication]]s cables. Different codes are used for wire leads on devices such as transformers or in building wiring.\n\n==History==\n{{anchor|RMA|RTMA|RETMA|EIA|IEC}}\n[[File:ResistorColorCodeGuide.jpg|thumb|[[Radio Manufacturers Association|RMA]] resistor color code guide, ca. 1945\u20131950]]\nBefore industry standards were established, each manufacturer used their own unique system for color coding or marking their components.\n\nIn the 1920s,{{Citation needed|date=November 2019|reason=Please help nail down the exact year of the RMA resistor color specification. It's in the range of 1924 to 1930.}} the '''RMA resistor color code''' was developed by the [[Radio Manufacturers Association]] (RMA) as a fixed resistor coloring code marking.  In 1930, the first [[Radio receiver|radio]]s with RMA color coded resistors were built.<ref name=\"ARH_1932_1\"/><ref name=\"ARH_1932_2\"/> Over many decades, as the organization name changed (RMA, RTMA, RETMA, [[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]])<ref name=\"JEDEC_EIA\"/> so was the name of the code. Though known most recent as '''EIA color code''', the four name variations are found in books, magazines, catalogs, and other documents over more than {{Years ago|1930}} years.\n\nIn 1952, it was standardized in [[IEC 62:1952]] by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) and since 1963 also published as '''EIA RS-279'''.<ref name=\"EIA_RS-279\"/> Originally only meant to be used for fixed resistors, the color code was extended to also cover capacitors with [[IEC 62:1968]]. The code was adopted by many national standards like [[DIN 40825]] (1973), [[BS 1852]] (1974) and [[IS 8186]] (1976). The current international standard defining marking codes for resistors and capacitors is [[IEC 60062:2016]]<ref name=\"IEC_60062_2016\"/> and [[EN 60062:2016]]. In addition to the color code, these standards define a letter and digit code named [[RKM code]] for resistors and capacitors.\n\nColor bands were used because they were easily and cheaply printed on tiny components. However, there were drawbacks, especially for [[Color blindness|color blind]] people. Overheating of a component or dirt accumulation may make it impossible to distinguish brown from red or orange. Advances in printing technology have now made printed numbers more practical on small components. The values of components in [[surface mount]] packages are marked with printed alphanumeric codes instead of a color code.\n\n==Resistors==\n{{anchor|Resistor code}}\n[[Image:Preferred values 05 Pengo.svg|thumb|One decade of the [[E12 series]] (there are twelve preferred values per decade of values) shown with their electronic color codes on [[resistor]]s]]\n[[Image:0-ohm.jpg|thumb|A [[Zero-ohm link|0&nbsp;\u03a9 resistor]] (zero ohm), marked with a single black band]]\n\nTo distinguish left from right there is a gap between the C and D bands:\n[[Image:Resistor bands.svg|A diagram of a resistor, with four color bands A, B, C, D from left to right]]\n[[Image:4-Band Resistor.svg|A diagram of a 2.7&nbsp;M\u03a9 color-coded resistor.]]\n{{ordered list\n | list-style-type=upper-alpha\n | The first significant figure of component value (left side)\n | The second significant figure (some precision resistors have a third significant figure, and thus five bands).\n | The decimal multiplier (number of trailing zeroes)\n | If present, indicates tolerance of value in percent (no band means 20%)\n}}\n\nIn the above example, a resistor with bands of red, violet, green, and brown has first digit 2 (red; see table below), second digit 7 (violet), followed by 5 (green) zeroes: {{val|2,700,000|u=ohms}}. Gold signifies that the tolerance is \u00b15%.\n\nResistors manufactured for military use may also include a fifth band which indicates component failure rate ([[Reliability engineering|reliability]]); refer to [[MIL-HDBK]]-199<ref name=\"MIL_HDBK_199C\"/> for further details.\n\nTight tolerance resistors may have three bands for significant figures rather than two, or an additional band indicating [[temperature coefficient]], in units of [[parts per million|ppm]]/[[Kelvin|K]].\n\nAll coded components have at least two value bands and a multiplier; other bands are optional.\n\nThe standard color code per [[IEC 60062:2016]] is as follows:\n{{Electronic colour code}}\nResistors use various [[E series of preferred numbers#Lists|E series of preferred numbers]] for their specific values, which are determined by their [[tolerance (engineering)|tolerance]]. These values repeat for every decade of magnitude: \u2026 0.68, 6.8, 68, 680, \u2026 For resistors of 20% tolerance the E6 series, with six values: 10, 15, 22, 33, 47, 68, then 100, 150, \u2026 is used; each value is approximately the previous value multiplied by {{radic|10|6}}. For 10% tolerance resistors the E12 series, with {{radic|10|12}} as multiplier, is used; similar schemes up to E192, for 0.5% or tighter tolerance are used. The separation between the values is related to the tolerance so that adjacent values at the extremes of tolerance approximately just overlap; for example, in the E6 series {{nobr|10 + 20%}} is 12, while {{nobr|15 \u2212 20%}} is also 12.\n\n[[Zero ohm resistor]]s, marked with a single black band,<ref name=\"NZO_NIC\"/> are lengths of wire wrapped in a resistor-like body which can be mounted on a [[printed-circuit board]] (PCB) by automatic component-insertion equipment. They are typically used on PCBs as insulating \"bridges\" where two traces would otherwise cross, or as soldered-in [[Jumper (computing)|jumper]] wires for setting configurations.\n\n=== Body-end-dot system ===\nThe \"body-end-dot\" or \"body-tip-spot\" system was used for cylindrical composition resistors sometimes still found in very old equipment; the first band was given by the body color, the second band by the color of one end of the resistor, and the multiplier by a dot or band around the middle of the resistor. The other end of the resistor was in the body color, silver, or gold for 20%, 10%, 5% tolerance (tighter tolerances were not routinely used).<ref name=\"FTRC_1946\"/><ref name=\"BTS\"/><ref name=\"RMA\"/><ref name=\"Antique_Resistor\"/>\n\n===Examples===\n[[Image:Resistors color code.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Example color-coded resistors]]\nFrom top to bottom:\n* Green, blue, black, black, brown\n** 560&nbsp;ohms \u00b11%\n* Red, red, orange, gold\n** {{val|22000|u=ohms}} \u00b15%\n* Yellow, violet, brown, gold\n** 470&nbsp;ohms \u00b15%\n* Blue, grey, black, gold\n** 68&nbsp;ohms \u00b15%\n\nThe physical size of a resistor is indicative of the [[power (physics)|power]] it can dissipate.\n\nThere is an important difference between the use of three and of four bands to indicate resistance. The same resistance is encoded by:\n*Red, red, ''orange'' = ''22'' followed by ''3'' zeroes = {{val|22000}} (excluding default, silver, or gold tolerance)\n*Red, red, ''black'', ''red'' = ''220'' followed by ''2'' zeroes = {{val|22000}} (excluding brown or other band for tolerance)\n\n===Mnemonics===\n{{Further|List of electronic color code mnemonics}}\n\nA useful [[mnemonic]] matches the first letter of the color code, in numeric order. Here are two that include tolerance codes gold, silver, and none:\n* '''B'''ad '''B'''eer '''R'''ots '''O'''ut '''Y'''our '''G'''uts '''B'''ut '''V'''odka '''G'''oes '''W'''ell \u2013 '''G'''et '''S'''ome '''N'''ow.<ref name=\"Campbell_BUCD\"/>\n*'''B'''lack '''B'''ears '''R'''uined '''O'''ur '''Y'''oung '''G'''reen '''B'''erry '''V'''ines '''G'''rowing '''W'''ild \u2013 '''G'''randma '''S'''aid '''N'''ervously.\n* '''B''' '''B''' '''ROY''' of '''G'''reat '''B'''ritain had a '''V'''ery '''G'''ood '''W'''ife who wore '''G'''old and '''S'''ilver '''N'''ecklace.<ref name=\"Dhir_1999\"/>\nThe colors are sorted with ascending values in the order of the [[visible light spectrum]] to make them easy to remember and to reduce the significance of possible read errors due to color shifts and fading over time<!-- except for the tolerance ring -->: red (2), orange (3), yellow (4), green (5), blue (6), violet (7). Black (0) has no energy, brown (1) has a little more, white (9) has everything and grey (8) is like white, but less intense.<ref name=\"Clement\"/>\n\n=={{anchor|Capacitor code}}Capacitors==\nCapacitors may be marked with 4 or more colored bands or dots. The colors encode the first and second most significant digits of the value in picofarads, and the third color the decimal multiplier. Additional bands have meanings which may vary from one type to another. Low-tolerance capacitors may begin with the first 3 (rather than 2) digits of the value. It is usually, but not always, possible to work out what scheme is used by the particular colors used. Cylindrical capacitors marked with bands may look like [[resistor]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Color\n! Significant digits\n! Multiplier\n!

This style of capacitor was used in vacuum-tube equipment.]]\nCapacitors of the rectangular \"postage stamp\" form made for military use during World War II used ''[[American War Standard]]'' (AWS) or ''[[Joint Army-Navy]]'' (JAN) coding in six dots stamped on the capacitor. An arrow on the top row of dots pointed to the right, indicating the reading order. From left to right the top dots were: either black, indicating JAN [[mica capacitor|mica]], or silver, indicating AWS paper; first significant digit; and second significant digit. The bottom three dots indicated temperature characteristic, tolerance, and decimal multiplier. The characteristic was black for {{val|\u00b11000|u=ppm/\u00b0C}}, brown for \u00b1500, red for \u00b1200, orange for \u00b1100, yellow for \u221220 to +100&nbsp;ppm/\u00b0C, and green for 0 to +70&nbsp;ppm/\u00b0C.\n\nA similar six-dot code by EIA had the top row as first, second and third significant digits and the bottom row as voltage rating (in hundreds of volts; no color indicated 500 volts), tolerance, and multiplier. A three-dot EIA code was used for 500 volt 20% tolerance capacitors, and the dots signified first and second significant digits and the multiplier. Such capacitors were common in [[vacuum tube]] equipment and in surplus for a generation after the war but are unavailable now.<ref name=\"ARRL77\"/>\n\n=={{anchor|Inductor code}}Inductors==\nStandards IEC&nbsp;60062&nbsp;/ EN&nbsp;60062 do not define a color code for [[inductor]]s, but manufacturers of small inductors use the resistor color code , typically encoding [[inductance]] in microhenries.<ref name=\"TDK_Inductors\"/> A white tolerance ring may{{weasel-inline|date=September 2019}} indicate custom specifications.<ref name=\"TDK_Inductors\"/>\n\n==Diodes==\nThe part number for small [[JEDEC]] \"1N\"-coded diodes\u2014in the form \"1N4148\"\u2014is sometimes encoded as three or four rings in the standard color code, omitting the \"1N\" prefix. The [[1N4148 signal diode|1N4148]] would then be coded as yellow (4), brown (1), yellow (4), grey (8).\n\n==Wire==\n\n===Transformer===\nPower [[transformer]]s used in North American vacuum-tube equipment were often color-coded to identify the leads. Black was the primary connection, red secondary for the B+ (plate voltage), red with a yellow tracer was the [[center tap]] for the B+ full-wave rectifier winding, green or brown was the heater voltage for all tubes, yellow was the filament voltage for the rectifier tube (often a different voltage than other tube heaters). Two wires of each color were provided for each circuit, and phasing was not identified by the color code.\n\nAudio transformers for vacuum tube equipment were coded blue for the finishing lead of the primary, red for the B+ lead of the primary, brown for a primary center tap, green for the finishing lead of the secondary, black for grid lead of the secondary, and yellow for a tapped secondary. Each lead had a different color since relative polarity or phase was more important for these transformers. Intermediate-frequency tuned transformers were coded blue and red for the primary and green and black for the secondary.<ref name=\"ARRL77\"/>\n\n===Other===\nWires may be color-coded to identify their function, voltage class, polarity, phase or to identify the circuit in which they are used. The insulation of the wire may be solidly colored, or where more combinations are needed, one or two tracer stripes may be added. Some wiring color codes are set by national regulations, but often a color code is specific to a manufacturer or industry.\n\n[[Building wiring]] under the US [[National Electrical Code]] and the [[Canadian Electrical Code]] is identified by colors to show energized and neutral conductors, grounding conductors and to identify phases. Other color codes are used in the UK and other areas to identify building wiring or flexible cable wiring.\n\nMains electrical wiring, both in a building and on equipment was once usually red for live, black for neutral, and green for earth, but this was changed as it was a hazard for color-blind people, who might confuse red and green; different countries use different conventions. Red and black are frequently used for positive and negative of battery or other single-voltage DC wiring.\n\n[[Thermocouple]] wires and extension cables are identified by color code for the type of thermocouple; interchanging thermocouples with unsuitable extension wires destroys the accuracy of the measurement.\n\nAutomotive wiring is color-coded but standards vary by manufacturer; differing [[SAE International|SAE]] and [[DIN]] standards exist.\n\nModern [[personal computer]] peripheral cables and connectors are [[PC connector colors|color-coded]] to simplify connection of speakers, microphones, mice, keyboards and other peripherals, usually according to coloring schemes following recommendations such as [[PC System Design Guide]], [[PoweredUSB]], [[ATX]], etc.\n\nA common convention for wiring systems in industrial buildings is: black jacket \u2013 AC less than {{val|1000|u=volts|fmt=commas}}, blue jacket \u2013 DC or communications, orange jacket \u2013 medium voltage {{val|2300|fmt=commas}} or {{val|4160|u=V|fmt=commas}}, red jacket {{val|13800|u=V|fmt=commas}} or higher. Red-jacketed cable is also used for relatively low-voltage [[fire alarm]] wiring, but has a much different appearance.\n\nLocal area network cables may also have non-standardised jacket colors identifying, for example, process control network vs. office automation networks, or to identify redundant network connections, but these codes vary by organization and facility.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Electronic color code}}\n* [[E series of preferred numbers]] (IEC 60063) \u2014 series of preferred resistance and capacitance values\n* [[Color code]]\n* [[Electrical wiring]] \u2014 AC power wiring inside buildings, including standard color codes\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_Tolerance\">\u00b15% or \u00b10.5&nbsp;pF, whichever is greater.</ref>\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"ARH_1932_1\">{{cite journal |title=Color coding |journal=[[Service - A Monthly Digest of Radio and Allied Maintenance]] |date=April 1932 |volume=1 |number=3 |editor-first1=John F. |editor-last1=Rider |editor-link1=John F.

It also stated that Germany would never go to war with the other countries. Locarno divided borders in Europe into two categories: western, which were guaranteed by Locarno treaties, and eastern borders of Germany with [[Poland]], which were open for revision.\n\n==Planning the treaties==\nGerman foreign minister [[Gustav Stresemann]] made his highest priority the restoration of German prestige and privileges as a leading European nation. French withdrawal from the [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] was scheduled for January 1925, but Stresemann sensed that France was very nervous about its security and might cancel the withdrawal. Having realized that France deeply desired a British guarantee of its postwar borders, but that London was reluctant, Stresemann came up with a plan whereby all sides would get what they wanted: through a series of treaties that promised these guarantees. Upon hearing this proposal, British Foreign Minister [[Austen Chamberlain]] enthusiastically agreed. France realized that its occupation of the Ruhr had caused more financial and diplomatic damage than it was worth. The foreign ministers then convened in the Swiss resort of Locarno in October 1925, where they came to an agreement on the treaties. \n\nThe first treaty was the most critical: a mutual guarantee of the frontiers of Belgium, France, and Germany, guaranteed by Britain and Italy. The second and third treaties called for arbitration between Germany and [[Belgium]], and Germany and France, regarding future disputes. The fourth and fifth were similar arbitration treaties between Germany and Poland, and Germany and Czechoslovakia. Poland especially, and Czechoslovakia as well, felt threatened by the Locarno agreements and these treaties were an attempt to reassure them. Thanks to the [[Dawes Plan]], Germany was now making regular reparations payments. The success of the Locarno agreements led to the admission of Germany to the League of Nations in September 1926, with a seat on its council as a permanent member.<ref>Norman Rich, ''Great Power Diplomacy since 1914 '' (2003) pp 148\u201349.</ref>\n\n==Goals==\nFor Britain, the main goals were promoting Franco-German reconciliation, and the expectation that reconciliation would lead to France abandoning its ''[[Cordon sanitaire]]'', as the French alliance system in [[Eastern Europe]] was known between the wars.<ref>Stephen Schuker, \u201cThe End of Versailles\u201d pages 38\u201356 in Gordon Martel, ed.

Germany formally recognised its new western borders acted by the Treaty of Versailles. Furthermore, the first three signatories undertook not to attack each other, with the latter two acting as guarantors. In the event of aggression by any of the first three states against another, all other parties were to assist the country under attack.<ref>Jon Jacobson, ''Locarno diplomacy: Germany and the west, 1925\u20131929'' (2015)</ref>\n\nGermany also agreed to sign arbitration conventions with France and Belgium and arbitration treaties with Poland and Czechoslovakia, undertaking to refer future disputes to an arbitration tribunal or to the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]].\n\nFrance signed further treaties with Poland and Czechoslovakia, pledging mutual assistance in the event of conflict with Germany. These essentially reaffirmed existing treaties of alliance concluded by France with Poland on 19 February 1921 and with Czechoslovakia on 25 January 1924. These treaties also showed that relations between France and Germany had not improved to a large extent.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Effect==\nThe Locarno Treaties marked a dramatic improvement in the political climate of western Europe in 1924\u20131930. They promoted expectations for continued peaceful settlements, often called the \"spirit of Locarno\". This spirit was made concrete when Germany joined the League in 1926, and the withdrawal of Allied troops occupying Germany's [[Rhineland]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Bo Str\u00e5th|title=Europe's Utopias of Peace: 1815, 1919, 1951|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sMY7CwAAQBAJ&pg=PT398|year=2016|publisher=Bloomsbury|page=398|isbn=9781474237741}}</ref>\nThe [[Nobel Peace Prize]] was given to the lead negotiators of the treaty, going to Sir [[Austen Chamberlain]] in 1925 and jointly to [[Aristide Briand]] and [[Gustav Stresemann]] in 1926.\n\nHistorian [[Sally Marks]] says:\n{{quote|Henceforth the spirit of Locarno would reign, substituting conciliation for enforcement as the basis for peace.

These essentially reaffirmed existing treaties of alliance concluded by France with Poland on 19 February 1921 and with Czechoslovakia on 25 January 1924.

The county is just north of the [[Greater Toronto Area]], stretching from the shores of [[Lake Simcoe]] in the east to [[Georgian Bay]] in the west. Simcoe County forms part of the [[Greater Golden Horseshoe]] area, a densely populated and industrialized region, centred on the Greater Toronto Area.\n\nThe land area of the county is {{convert|4859.64|km2|2}}.<ref name=\"census2016\"/> The elevated [[Niagara Escarpment]] runs through sections of the western part of the county, and the [[Minesing Wetlands]], a [[Ramsar Convention]] [[wetland]] of international importance, is located in the central area of the county.\n\nThe county administrative centre is on Highway 26 in [[Midhurst, Ontario|Midhurst]], outside [[Barrie]].\n\n==Geography==\nSimcoe County is informally split into two subregions, \u201cSouth Simcoe\u201d and \u201cNorth Simcoe\u201d.  The dividing line between these two areas is Simcoe County Road 90 (Mill St.).\n\nSouth Simcoe municipalities are situated at the northern boundary of the [[Greater Toronto Area]] (GTA) and therefore generally have a closer socio-economic association with the GTA.  South Simcoe is also within the Toronto commuter-belt as it is home to a relatively high proportion of people commuting to the GTA.  South Simcoe is home to five municipalities, including: the Town of [[Innisfil]], the Township of [[Adjala\u2013Tosorontio|Adjala-Tosorontio]], the Town of [[Bradford West Gwillimbury]], the Township of [[Essa, Ontario|Essa]] and the Town of [[New Tecumseth]] (which includes: [[Alliston]], [[Beeton]] and [[Tottenham, Ontario|Tottenham]]).\n\nNorth Simcoe is less connected to the GTA due to its more removed geographic location, is generally less industrial than South Simcoe and generally has a closer socio-economic association with the [[Muskoka]] area, located immediately north. However, North Simcoe hosts two [[GO Train]] Stations which provide daily commuter rail service to Toronto.  North Simcoe includes: the Township of Clearview, the Township of Oro-Medonte, the Township of Ramara, the Township of Severn, the Township of Springwater, the Township of Tay and the Township of Tiny, the Town of Collingwood, the Town of Midland, the Town of Penetanguishene and the Town of Wasaga Beach. The cities of [[Barrie]] and [[Orillia]] are geographically within North Simcoe, but both are [[independent city|politically independent]] single-tier municipalities.\n\n==History==\nSimcoe County, in particular the former [[Wendake Beach, Ontario|Wendake]] area near [[Nottawasaga Bay]], was the site of the earliest French exploration and settlement of Ontario; they were the first Europeans in the area. Several historic sites, including [[Carhagouha]] and [[Sainte-Marie among the Hurons]], mark the earliest known contacts between the area's traditional [[Wyandot people|Huron]] population and French [[missionary|missionaries]]. The Huron capital, [[Ossossan\u00e9]], was at one time the largest aboriginal settlement in all of North America outside [[Mexico]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n[[File:A map of the province of Upper Canada describing all the settlements and townships, 1818.jpg|thumb|The province of Upper Canada, 1818]]\nThe County, named by [[Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada]] [[John Graves Simcoe]] in honour of his father Captain John Simcoe, was established as part of the [[Home District]] in 1798 by the [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada]].<ref>{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An act for the better division of this province|abbr =S.U.C.|year =1798|chapter =5|section=33-34|link=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/aeu.ark:/13960/t42r4wr64?urlappend=%3Bseq=157}}, as amended by {{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act to repeal part of an act passed in the thirty-eighth year of his late Majesty's reign, entitled, \"An act for the better division of this province,\" and to make further provision for the division of the same into counties and districts|abbr =S.U.C.|year =1821|chapter =3|section=7|link=https://archive.org/stream/statutesprovinc18progoog#page/n276/mode/1up}}</ref> Its initial territory was described as follows:\n\n{{quote|\n...[[Matchedash Bay|Matchedash]], Gloucester, or [[Penetanguishene]], together with [[Beausoleil Island|Prince William Henry's Island]],<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/eppp-archive/100/205/301/ic/cdc/simcoeregion/community/beausoleil/index.htm|title=Beausoleil First Nation}}</ref> and all the land lying between the [[Midland District]] and a line produced due north from a certain fixed boundary (at the distance of about fifty miles north-west from the outlet of [[Burlington Bay]]) till it intersects the northern limits of the Province...\n}}\n\nAt its beginning, the County existed only for purposes of military enlistment.{{sfn|Hunter|1909a|p=235}} In 1823, it became a separate [[constituency]] for elections to the [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada]],{{sfn|Hunter|1909a|p=235}} but, as eligibility to vote was dependent upon having title to property, and Simcoe's first registrar of deeds was not appointed until 1826,{{sfn|Hunter|1909a|p=235}} it did not send a separate member to the Assembly until the election of [[John Cawthra]] in 1828.{{sfn|Hunter|1909a|p=235}} It was withdrawn from the Home District in 1837,<ref>{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act to authorize the Erection of the County of Simcoe into a separate District, by the name of the District of Simcoe|abbr =S.U.C.|year =1837|chapter =32|link=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.35112103435170?urlappend=%3Bseq=113}}</ref> with its territory divided as follows:\n\n{| class = \"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+Townships of Simcoe County in 1837 (before reorganization)\n|- \n!District\n!County\n!Townships\n|-\n|Simcoe\n|Simcoe\n|\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* Adjala\n* Essa\n* Flos\n* West Gwillimbury\n* Innisfil\n* Mara\n* Matchedash\n* Medonte\n* Nottawasaga\n* Orillia (North Division)\n* Orillia (South Division)\n* Oro\n* Rama\n* Sunnidale\n* Tay\n* Tecumseth\n* Tiny\n* Tosorontio\n* Vespra\n{{div col end}}\n|-\n|[[Wellington District, Upper Canada|Wellington]]\n|[[Waterloo County, Ontario|Waterloo]]\n|\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* Amaranth\n* Luther\n* Melancthon\n* Proton\n{{div col end}}\n|-\n|[[Home District|Home]]\n|Fourth Riding of [[York County, Ontario|York]]\n|\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* Thorah\n* Mara\n* Rama\n{{div col end}}\n|}\n[[File:1850 Tallis Map of West Canada or Ontario ( includes Great Lakes ) - Geographicus - WestCanada-tallis-1850.jpg|thumb|1850 Tallis Map of West Canada - Simcoe County highlighted in red]]\nBetween 1837 and 1841 several acts were passed by the Legislature of Upper Canada which set apart Simcoe District. These acts named the townships that the County would encompass and authorized the levying of taxes for the purpose of constructing a jail and court house.

The county is just north of the [[Greater Toronto Area]], stretching from the shores of [[Lake Simcoe]] in the east to [[Georgian Bay]] in the west. Simcoe County forms part of the [[Greater Golden Horseshoe]] area, a densely populated and industrialized region, centred on the Greater Toronto Area.\n\nThe land area of the county is {{convert|4859.64|km2|2}}.<ref name=\"census2016\"/> The elevated [[Niagara Escarpment]] runs through sections of the western part of the county, and the [[Minesing Wetlands]], a [[Ramsar Convention]] [[wetland]] of international importance, is located in the central area of the county.\n\nThe county administrative centre is on Highway 26 in [[Midhurst, Ontario|Midhurst]], outside [[Barrie]].\n\n==Geography==\nSimcoe County is informally split into two subregions, \u201cSouth Simcoe\u201d and \u201cNorth Simcoe\u201d.  The dividing line between these two areas is Simcoe County Road 90 (Mill St.).\n\nSouth Simcoe municipalities are situated at the northern boundary of the [[Greater Toronto Area]] (GTA) and therefore generally have a closer socio-economic association with the GTA.  South Simcoe is also within the Toronto commuter-belt as it is home to a relatively high proportion of people commuting to the GTA.  South Simcoe is home to five municipalities, including: the Town of [[Innisfil]], the Township of [[Adjala\u2013Tosorontio|Adjala-Tosorontio]], the Town of [[Bradford West Gwillimbury]], the Township of [[Essa, Ontario|Essa]] and the Town of [[New Tecumseth]] (which includes: [[Alliston]], [[Beeton]] and [[Tottenham, Ontario|Tottenham]]).\n\nNorth Simcoe is less connected to the GTA due to its more removed geographic location, is generally less industrial than South Simcoe and generally has a closer socio-economic association with the [[Muskoka]] area, located immediately north. However, North Simcoe hosts two [[GO Train]] Stations which provide daily commuter rail service to Toronto.  North Simcoe includes: the Township of Clearview, the Township of Oro-Medonte, the Township of Ramara, the Township of Severn, the Township of Springwater, the Township of Tay and the Township of Tiny, the Town of Collingwood, the Town of Midland, the Town of Penetanguishene and the Town of Wasaga Beach. The cities of [[Barrie]] and [[Orillia]] are geographically within North Simcoe, but both are [[independent city|politically independent]] single-tier municipalities.\n\n==History==\nSimcoe County, in particular the former [[Wendake Beach, Ontario|Wendake]] area near [[Nottawasaga Bay]], was the site of the earliest French exploration and settlement of Ontario; they were the first Europeans in the area. Several historic sites, including [[Carhagouha]] and [[Sainte-Marie among the Hurons]], mark the earliest known contacts between the area's traditional [[Wyandot people|Huron]] population and French [[missionary|missionaries]]. The Huron capital, [[Ossossan\u00e9]], was at one time the largest aboriginal settlement in all of North America outside [[Mexico]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n[[File:A map of the province of Upper Canada describing all the settlements and townships, 1818.jpg|thumb|The province of Upper Canada, 1818]]\nThe County, named by [[Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada]] [[John Graves Simcoe]] in honour of his father Captain John Simcoe, was established as part of the [[Home District]] in 1798 by the [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada]].<ref>{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An act for the better division of this province|abbr =S.U.C.|year =1798|chapter =5|section=33-34|link=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/aeu.ark:/13960/t42r4wr64?urlappend=%3Bseq=157}}, as amended by {{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act to repeal part of an act passed in the thirty-eighth year of his late Majesty's reign, entitled, \"An act for the better division of this province,\" and to make further provision for the division of the same into counties and districts|abbr =S.U.C.|year =1821|chapter =3|section=7|link=https://archive.org/stream/statutesprovinc18progoog#page/n276/mode/1up}}</ref> Its initial territory was described as follows:\n\n{{quote|\n...[[Matchedash Bay|Matchedash]], Gloucester, or [[Penetanguishene]], together with [[Beausoleil Island|Prince William Henry's Island]],<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/eppp-archive/100/205/301/ic/cdc/simcoeregion/community/beausoleil/index.htm|title=Beausoleil First Nation}}</ref> and all the land lying between the [[Midland District]] and a line produced due north from a certain fixed boundary (at the distance of about fifty miles north-west from the outlet of [[Burlington Bay]]) till it intersects the northern limits of the Province...\n}}\n\nAt its beginning, the County existed only for purposes of military enlistment.{{sfn|Hunter|1909a|p=235}} In 1823, it became a separate [[constituency]] for elections to the [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada]],{{sfn|Hunter|1909a|p=235}} but, as eligibility to vote was dependent upon having title to property, and Simcoe's first registrar of deeds was not appointed until 1826,{{sfn|Hunter|1909a|p=235}} it did not send a separate member to the Assembly until the election of [[John Cawthra]] in 1828.{{sfn|Hunter|1909a|p=235}} It was withdrawn from the Home District in 1837,<ref>{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act to authorize the Erection of the County of Simcoe into a separate District, by the name of the District of Simcoe|abbr =S.U.C.|year =1837|chapter =32|link=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.35112103435170?urlappend=%3Bseq=113}}</ref> with its territory divided as follows:\n\n{| class = \"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+Townships of Simcoe County in 1837 (before reorganization)\n|- \n!District\n!County\n!Townships\n|-\n|Simcoe\n|Simcoe\n|\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* Adjala\n* Essa\n* Flos\n* West Gwillimbury\n* Innisfil\n* Mara\n* Matchedash\n* Medonte\n* Nottawasaga\n* Orillia (North Division)\n* Orillia (South Division)\n* Oro\n* Rama\n* Sunnidale\n* Tay\n* Tecumseth\n* Tiny\n* Tosorontio\n* Vespra\n{{div col end}}\n|-\n|[[Wellington District, Upper Canada|Wellington]]\n|[[Waterloo County, Ontario|Waterloo]]\n|\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* Amaranth\n* Luther\n* Melancthon\n* Proton\n{{div col end}}\n|-\n|[[Home District|Home]]\n|Fourth Riding of [[York County, Ontario|York]]\n|\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* Thorah\n* Mara\n* Rama\n{{div col end}}\n|}\n[[File:1850 Tallis Map of West Canada or Ontario ( includes Great Lakes ) - Geographicus - WestCanada-tallis-1850.jpg|thumb|1850 Tallis Map of West Canada - Simcoe County highlighted in red]]\nBetween 1837 and 1841 several acts were passed by the Legislature of Upper Canada which set apart Simcoe District.
