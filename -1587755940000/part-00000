These plays were popular under the pro-American citizenry of the [[Dutch Republic]] at this time. Those sympathies were not shared by the regime of [[stadtholder]] [[William V, Prince of Orange]] who was related to the British king [[George III of the United Kingdom]]<ref group=Note>He was a grandson of king [[George II of Great Britain]], just like George III himself, through his mother, [[Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange]].</ref> and therefore preferred a pro-British and anti-American/French policy.

This war did not go well for the Dutch, and the population blamed the stadtholder.

He also in November 1785 took up a commission as a lieutenant in the Utrecht ''[[schutterij]]'' in the ''Turkije'' company. As such he got engaged in the ''[[exercitiegenootschap]]''-movement that was important in Patriot politics. ''De Post'' published a large number of articles about this movement in this period. It became one of the major organs of Patriot propaganda in this way.<ref name=\"Teeuwen\" />\n\nBoth as journalist and political activist 't Hoen became involved in the democratization process of the Utrecht city and provincial government in 1784-1785, which led to the first democratically-elected city government in the Dutch Republic in August 1786. The adherents of the stadtholder, the [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)|Orangists]] formed a rival States of Utrecht in December 1785 that moved to [[Amersfoort]] under the protection of a garrison of [[Dutch States Army]] troops that repeatedly threatened Utrecht. On 9 May 1787 't Hoen, with his company of ''schutters'' took part in the [[Battle of Jutphaas]] to repel one of those threatening moves. This success was, however, soon followed by the [[Prussian invasion of Holland]], during which Utrecht was given up to the Prussians without a fight. 't Hoen followed the Patriot troops in their retreat to Amsterdam in September 1787. After the fall of Amsterdam on 10 October, 't Hoen fled like many other Patriots to first [[Brussels]], and later northern [[Kingdom of France|France]] with his family.<ref name=\"Teeuwen\" /> In 1789 he was sentenced ''in absentia'' to 25 years banishment.<ref>Ros, p. 1</ref>\n\nIn France he received a pension of 2,400 [[French livre|livres]] from the French government in recognition of his work as a journalist, who had often been supportive of French policies. He lived for short periods of time in [[Saint-Omer]], [[Gravelines]], [[Dunkirk]], and eventually [[Watten, Nord|Watten]] near St. Omer, where he joined a \"commune\" of other Dutch Patriots, like his colleagues [[Wybo Fijnje]] and Gerrit Paape. In this period he remained active as a journalist. He started a new publication, entitled ''Gedenkschriften van Martinus Scriblerus den Jongen'' (Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus the Younger) that had an anti-clerical character. He also cooperated with the journalist Joost Vrijdag in editing the periodical ''Duinkerksche historische courant'' (Dunkirk historical journal), but this went bankrupt, according to Vrijdag because of 't Hoen's financial incompetence. When the new French government ended his pension in 1793 't Hoen started a tobacco factory, and sold his real estate in Utrecht. He was sufficiently successful as a writer that he could live from his writings. In 1793 he published ''Kort historisch verhaal en onzydige aanmerkingen over de gesteltenis van Braband'' (Short historical narrative and neutral remarks about the situation of Braband) by [[Jan Frans Vonck]].<ref name=\"Teeuwen\" />\n\nMeanwhile, 't Hoen became embroiled in the internal strife of the exiled Patriots between the followers of [[Johan Valckenaer]] and [[Court Lambertus van Beyma]] on the side of Valckenaer. Together with the latter and several other Dutchmen he became active in French revolutionary politics as a member of the [[Jacobin]] party in Watten, though he kept apart from the turmoil of the [[Reign of Terror]] of [[Maximilien Robespierre]] c.s. He followed the French army that in November 1794 and early 1795 overran the Dutch Republic, and helped found the [[Batavian Republic]] as the secretary of the Provisional Representatives of the People of Utrecht (the Utrecht equivalent of the [[Provisional Representatives of the People of Holland]]) in February 1795. This was made permanent when on 17 March 1795 he was made secretary of the Finance Committee. On 18 April 1796 he was appointed secretary of  the new provincial government of Utrecht. Meanwhile, he also founded a new journal, ''De Nieuwe Post van den Neder-Rhijn''. This weekly would have 260 issues with a circulation of 1,400 copies between 10 March 1795 and 6 December 1799.<ref name=\"Teeuwen\" />\n\nIn this new journal he published a draft for a new constitution for the Batavian Republic that had a decided '\"unitarist\" slant in that it proposed the abolition of the federal structure of the Republic. This was an important issue in those days. The strife between the \"federalists\" and \"unitarists\" would in January 1798 issue into a [[coup d'etat]] that brought the '\"unitarists\" in power. 't Hoen supported this overturn of the political order, and he was as a result confirmed in his post as secretary of the new regional government that in 1799 replaced the old provinces of Utrecht and [[Gelderland]] with a Department that encompassed both. In this same period 't Hoen promoted religious emancipation of dissenters and Roman Catholics, who under the old Republic had been discriminated against in favor of members of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] in ''De Nieuwe Post''.<ref name=\"Teeuwen\" />\n\nIn the Summer of 1799 't Hoen, as secretary of the departmental government, got very busy with defensive measures against a threatening invasion by Orangist [[\u00c9migr\u00e9]]s from Germany, in support of the [[Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland]]. For that reason he was forced to neglect his work for ''De Nieuwe Post'' and this caused the cessation of its publication in December 1799.<ref name=\"Teeuwen\" />\n\nThe coup d'etat of October 1801 brought a far more conservative regime in the Batavian Republic to power, which attracted many former Orangists. 't Hoen lost his post as secretary and was demoted to ''Commies'' (clerk), with a large diminution of salary in 1802. 't Hoen lost his political influence and returned to private life. He started writing plays again, but ceased his literary work in 1806.<ref name=\"Teeuwen\" />\n\nIn 1811 (after the annexation of the Netherlands by the [[First French Empire]]) 't Hoen managed to obtain a post as clerk of the court in Amersfoort. He and his wife lived in a comfortable home in this city until their deaths (his wife died in 1826). His last years were difficult because of financial troubles, and because six of his children predeceased him. He himself died on 9 January 1828, 83 years old.<ref name=\"Teeuwen\" />\n\n==Works==\n*''Het Boeren Gezelschap of de Gehekelde Hekelaars'' (play, 1775)\n*''Nieuwe proeve van klijne gedichten voor kinderen'' (children's poems, 1778-1779)\n*''Jurjen Lankbein.

After the fall of Amsterdam on 10 October, 't Hoen fled like many other Patriots to first [[Brussels]], and later northern [[Kingdom of France|France]] with his family.<ref name=\"Teeuwen\" /> In 1789 he was sentenced ''in absentia'' to 25 years banishment.<ref>Ros, p. 1</ref>\n\nIn France he received a pension of 2,400 [[French livre|livres]] from the French government in recognition of his work as a journalist, who had often been supportive of French policies. He lived for short periods of time in [[Saint-Omer]], [[Gravelines]], [[Dunkirk]], and eventually [[Watten, Nord|Watten]] near St. Omer, where he joined a \"commune\" of other Dutch Patriots, like his colleagues [[Wybo Fijnje]] and Gerrit Paape. In this period he remained active as a journalist. He started a new publication, entitled ''Gedenkschriften van Martinus Scriblerus den Jongen'' (Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus the Younger) that had an anti-clerical character. He also cooperated with the journalist Joost Vrijdag in editing the periodical ''Duinkerksche historische courant'' (Dunkirk historical journal), but this went bankrupt, according to Vrijdag because of 't Hoen's financial incompetence. When the new French government ended his pension in 1793 't Hoen started a tobacco factory, and sold his real estate in Utrecht. He was sufficiently successful as a writer that he could live from his writings. In 1793 he published ''Kort historisch verhaal en onzydige aanmerkingen over de gesteltenis van Braband'' (Short historical narrative and neutral remarks about the situation of Braband) by [[Jan Frans Vonck]].<ref name=\"Teeuwen\" />\n\nMeanwhile, 't Hoen became embroiled in the internal strife of the exiled Patriots between the followers of [[Johan Valckenaer]] and [[Court Lambertus van Beyma]] on the side of Valckenaer. Together with the latter and several other Dutchmen he became active in French revolutionary politics as a member of the [[Jacobin]] party in Watten, though he kept apart from the turmoil of the [[Reign of Terror]] of [[Maximilien Robespierre]] c.s. He followed the French army that in November 1794 and early 1795 overran the Dutch Republic, and helped found the [[Batavian Republic]] as the secretary of the Provisional Representatives of the People of Utrecht (the Utrecht equivalent of the [[Provisional Representatives of the People of Holland]]) in February 1795. This was made permanent when on 17 March 1795 he was made secretary of the Finance Committee. On 18 April 1796 he was appointed secretary of  the new provincial government of Utrecht. Meanwhile, he also founded a new journal, ''De Nieuwe Post van den Neder-Rhijn''. This weekly would have 260 issues with a circulation of 1,400 copies between 10 March 1795 and 6 December 1799.<ref name=\"Teeuwen\" />\n\nIn this new journal he published a draft for a new constitution for the Batavian Republic that had a decided '\"unitarist\" slant in that it proposed the abolition of the federal structure of the Republic. This was an important issue in those days. The strife between the \"federalists\" and \"unitarists\" would in January 1798 issue into a [[coup d'etat]] that brought the '\"unitarists\" in power. 't Hoen supported this overturn of the political order, and he was as a result confirmed in his post as secretary of the new regional government that in 1799 replaced the old provinces of Utrecht and [[Gelderland]] with a Department that encompassed both. In this same period 't Hoen promoted religious emancipation of dissenters and Roman Catholics, who under the old Republic had been discriminated against in favor of members of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] in ''De Nieuwe Post''.<ref name=\"Teeuwen\" />\n\nIn the Summer of 1799 't Hoen, as secretary of the departmental government, got very busy with defensive measures against a threatening invasion by Orangist [[\u00c9migr\u00e9]]s from Germany, in support of the [[Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland]]. For that reason he was forced to neglect his work for ''De Nieuwe Post'' and this caused the cessation of its publication in December 1799.<ref name=\"Teeuwen\" />\n\nThe coup d'etat of October 1801 brought a far more conservative regime in the Batavian Republic to power, which attracted many former Orangists. 't Hoen lost his post as secretary and was demoted to ''Commies'' (clerk), with a large diminution of salary in 1802. 't Hoen lost his political influence and returned to private life. He started writing plays again, but ceased his literary work in 1806.<ref name=\"Teeuwen\" />\n\nIn 1811 (after the annexation of the Netherlands by the [[First French Empire]]) 't Hoen managed to obtain a post as clerk of the court in Amersfoort. He and his wife lived in a comfortable home in this city until their deaths (his wife died in 1826). His last years were difficult because of financial troubles, and because six of his children predeceased him. He himself died on 9 January 1828, 83 years old.<ref name=\"Teeuwen\" />\n\n==Works==\n*''Het Boeren Gezelschap of de Gehekelde Hekelaars'' (play, 1775)\n*''Nieuwe proeve van klijne gedichten voor kinderen'' (children's poems, 1778-1779)\n*''Jurjen Lankbein.

His father was born in Pittsburgh during the [[Great Depression]]. Born in [[Guayaquil, Ecuador]], his mother emigrated from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia in 1963. At the age of two, Kilwein Guevara moved with his parents and brothers from Colombia to Pittsburgh, [[Pennsylvania]], first living with his paternal grandparents in the [[Hazelwood (Pittsburgh)|Hazelwood neighborhood]], then home to the [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company|Jones and Laughlin Coke Works]]. Of those early experiences, Kilwein Guevara has noted:\n\n<blockquote>I was six or seven and listening to the immigrants and the natives and the migrants (some transplants from Germany, Italy, Colombia, Ireland, Poland, Hungary, Jim Crow Alabama, Mississippi, and Mexico by way of [[Weirton, West Virginia]]). To speak with an accent, to speak another language, to coexist giddily with tongues I didn't understand, to listen for tenor, to study how people laughed at the deli or pointed at the bread counter, to imitate how we learn to injure or sooth, to laugh or cry, this was quotidian.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book |last=Kilwein Guevara |first=Mauricio |editor1-last=Rankine |editor1-first=Claudia |editor2-last=Dowdy |editor2-first=Michael |title=American Poets in the 21st Century: Poetics of Social Engagement |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |date=2018 |pages=267\u2013294 |chapter= Mauricio Kilwein Guevara |isbn=978-0-8195-7830-3}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBy the age of seven, Kilwein Guevara and his family had resided in six different rental properties in [[Latin America]], [[Baltimore]], and Pittsburgh. Eventually by the mid-1970s his family was able to take up permanent residence in [[Bethel Park]], Pennsylvania, where Kilwein Guevara graduated from high school in 1979.\n\t\nFrom 1979 to 1983, Kilwein Guevara attended the [[University of Pittsburgh]], where he double-majored in English Writing and [[Behaviorism|Behavioral Psychology]] <ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web |last1=Kilwein Guevara |first1=Mauricio |title=Mauricio-Kilwein-Guevara.pdf |url=https://uwm.edu/english/wp-content/uploads/sites/109/2014/05/Mauricio-Kilwein-Guevara.pdf |website=University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee College of Letter & Sciences: English |publisher=University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee |accessdate=25 October 2019}}</ref>. While a student, he was hired by the [[Hillman Library]] to work the circulation desk of the Spoken Arts Collection. He has written that this job was formative: \"In Hillman I also heard recordings of [[Pablo Neruda|Neruda]], [[T.S Eliot|Eliot]], [[Sylvia Plath|Plath]], [[Anne Sexton|Sexton]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Delmore Schwartz]], [[e.e.cummings]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Robert Hayden]] and [[Robert Frost|Frost]].\"<ref name=\"auto\"/> While an undergraduate, he studied with [[Patricia Dobler]] and [[Diane Ackerman]].\n\nHe attended [[Bowling Green State University]] (Ohio) in the mid-1980s, earning a [[Master of Fine Arts]] in fiction writing<ref name=\"auto1\"/>.

Of the latter, he has written: \"Of the many things that John helped to clarify for me over the thirty years of our friendship is that literature at its best animates the core social functions of bringing humans closer to one another, of mitigating unwelcome solitude, and of growing our empathy for the world at large.\"<ref name=\"awpwriter\"/>\n\n== Poetry ==\nKilwein Guevara's poems tend to focus on the intersections and overlaps of experience, language, time and space. His poems are both lyrical and experimental, Latin and North American, meticulous yet unpredictable. Colombian author [[Jaime Manrique]] calls Kilwein Guevara \"righteous, funny, tender, melancholy, outrageous, musical, philosophical, terrifying, formal, colloquial, a realist, a surrealist, and a visionary\u2014all at once.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kilwein Guevara |first1=Mauricio |title=POEMA |date=2009 |publisher=University of Arizona Press |isbn=978-0816527250 |edition=1}}</ref>\n\nKilwein Guevara's aesthetic, as described by the literary critic Michael Dowdy, is \"scavenger Infrapoetics\" where poems \"emerge from materialist and ecological conceptions of language\" and employ \"surrealist, magic realist, and vanguardist practices.<ref name=\"auto\" />\" Poet [[Patricia Monaghan]] writing for [[Booklist]] stated, \"the word ''multicultural'' might have been coined for this poet, who alludes to Dante as casually as he deploys Spanish slang.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Monaghan |first1=Patricia |title=Poems of the River Spirit Booklist Review |journal=Booklist |date=May 1996 |url=https://www.booklistonline.com/Poems-of-the-River-Spirit-Maurice-Kilwein-Guevara/pid=634919 |accessdate=25 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nKilwein Guevara's first collection of poetry, ''Postmortem'', was published in 1994 by the [[University of Georgia Press]] and was nominated for the [[National Book Award]]<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web |last1=Kilwein Guevara |first1=Mauricio |title=Maurice Kilwein Guevara |url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/maurice-kilwein-guevara |website=Poetry Foundation |publisher=Poetry Foundation |accessdate=25 October 2019}}</ref>.

His father was born in Pittsburgh during the [[Great Depression]]. Born in [[Guayaquil, Ecuador]], his mother emigrated from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia in 1963. At the age of two, Kilwein Guevara moved with his parents and brothers from Colombia to Pittsburgh, [[Pennsylvania]], first living with his paternal grandparents in the [[Hazelwood (Pittsburgh)|Hazelwood neighborhood]], then home to the [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company|Jones and Laughlin Coke Works]]. Of those early experiences, Kilwein Guevara has noted:\n\n<blockquote>I was six or seven and listening to the immigrants and the natives and the migrants (some transplants from Germany, Italy, Colombia, Ireland, Poland, Hungary, Jim Crow Alabama, Mississippi, and Mexico by way of [[Weirton, West Virginia]]). To speak with an accent, to speak another language, to coexist giddily with tongues I didn't understand, to listen for tenor, to study how people laughed at the deli or pointed at the bread counter, to imitate how we learn to injure or sooth, to laugh or cry, this was quotidian.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book |last=Kilwein Guevara |first=Mauricio |editor1-last=Rankine |editor1-first=Claudia |editor2-last=Dowdy |editor2-first=Michael |title=American Poets in the 21st Century: Poetics of Social Engagement |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |date=2018 |pages=267\u2013294 |chapter= Mauricio Kilwein Guevara |isbn=978-0-8195-7830-3}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBy the age of seven, Kilwein Guevara and his family had resided in six different rental properties in [[Latin America]], [[Baltimore]], and Pittsburgh. Eventually by the mid-1970s his family was able to take up permanent residence in [[Bethel Park]], Pennsylvania, where Kilwein Guevara graduated from high school in 1979.\n\t\nFrom 1979 to 1983, Kilwein Guevara attended the [[University of Pittsburgh]], where he double-majored in English Writing and [[Behaviorism|Behavioral Psychology]] <ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web |last1=Kilwein Guevara |first1=Mauricio |title=Mauricio-Kilwein-Guevara.pdf |url=https://uwm.edu/english/wp-content/uploads/sites/109/2014/05/Mauricio-Kilwein-Guevara.pdf |website=University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee College of Letter & Sciences: English |publisher=University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee |accessdate=25 October 2019}}</ref>. While a student, he was hired by the [[Hillman Library]] to work the circulation desk of the Spoken Arts Collection. He has written that this job was formative: \"In Hillman I also heard recordings of [[Pablo Neruda|Neruda]], [[T.S Eliot|Eliot]], [[Sylvia Plath|Plath]], [[Anne Sexton|Sexton]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Delmore Schwartz]], [[e.e.cummings]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Robert Hayden]] and [[Robert Frost|Frost]].\"<ref name=\"auto\"/> While an undergraduate, he studied with [[Patricia Dobler]] and [[Diane Ackerman]].\n\nHe attended [[Bowling Green State University]] (Ohio) in the mid-1980s, earning a [[Master of Fine Arts]] in fiction writing<ref name=\"auto1\"/>.

Of the latter, he has written: \"Of the many things that John helped to clarify for me over the thirty years of our friendship is that literature at its best animates the core social functions of bringing humans closer to one another, of mitigating unwelcome solitude, and of growing our empathy for the world at large.\"<ref name=\"awpwriter\"/>\n\n== Poetry ==\nKilwein Guevara's poems tend to focus on the intersections and overlaps of experience, language, time and space. His poems are both lyrical and experimental, Latin and North American, meticulous yet unpredictable.

It was the longest and largest parade in the Soviet capital, lasting hours and utilizing 40,000 [[Red Army]] soldiers as well as 1,850 military vehicles. It took place over a month after the victory actually took place on 9 May, the day of Germany's surrender. Intensive preparations for the parade took place in late May and early June in Moscow. The preliminary rehearsal of the Victory Parade took place at [[Khodynka Aerodrome]], and the general rehearsal on Red Square on June 22. The day after the parade, a reception was held in the Grand Kremlin Palace in honor of the participants in the Victory Parade.<ref>https://www.prlib.ru/history/619337</ref> After the 1945 parade, Victory Day became obsolete in the [[Soviet Union]], with parades only being held on major jubilee, in part to make favor for the [[October Revolution Day]] parade which took place every year in the winter. In the decades that followed, 3 parades were held: in 1965, 1985<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/10/world/katyushas-and-missiles-in-red-square.html]</ref><ref>http://vvpobeda.shpl.ru/pob1985.html</ref>, and 1990.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dp.ru/a/2016/05/06/Parad_Pobedi|title=\u041a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u044b \u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044b \u0432 1945\u20132016 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0445|website=www.dp.ru|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tass.ru/obschestvo/1171423|title=\u0414\u0435\u043d\u044c \u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044b: \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432|website=\u0422\u0410\u0421\u0421|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref><ref>\u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0449\u0430\u0434\u0438 / \u041f\u043e\u0434 \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u0412.\u00a0\u041c.\u00a0\u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0418.\u00a0\u041f.\u00a0\u0420\u0435\u043f\u0438\u043d\u0430. 3-\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0434. \u041c., 1987.</ref><ref>https://m.sputnik-georgia.ru/russia/20200417/248265859/Istoriya-paradov-Pobedy-na-Krasnoy-ploschadi.html?mobile_return=no</ref>\n\nThe Victory Day Parade of 1995 was held to commemorate the [[golden jubilee]] of the Soviet victory in the war.<ref>http://tass.ru/obschestvo/1171423</ref> It was the first one held in the newly formed [[Russian Federation]], taking place 5 years after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]]. The parade was divided into two parts, a full military parade on [[Poklonnaya Hill]] and a veterans ceremony on [[Red Square]]. The [[2020 Moscow Victory Day Parade|2020 edition of the parade]], marking the [[diamond jubilee|75th anniversary]] of the victory over Nazi Germany, was postponed due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>https://tass.ru/obschestvo/8263303</ref><ref>https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/16/putin-postpones-75th-victory-day-parade-over-coronavirus-a70022</ref>  It was the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the resumption of military parades in 1995 that parade was to be cancelled on a holiday itself.\n\n==Description==\nOn the morning of the parade, an estimated 14,000 military personnel, including a regiment of female cadets and youth cadets, assemble by battalions on the square together with the more than 210 vehicles and 3,800 vehicle crews assembled on Tverskaya Street just north of the [[Manezhnaya Square, Moscow]], during the major parades a battalion or company of historical Red Army vehicles, estimated at around 36 vehicles and composed of just the [[T-34]], GAZ-67 and the SU-100 plus the optional BM-13N (or at around an estimated 480 when counting other vehicles of the war which would take part just like in the parades of 1985 and 1990) assemble on the street as well with modern military hardware of the Armed Forces and the National Guard (and optionally by the other uniformed organizations). At the air bases outside Moscow (in areas like [[Kubinka]]), more than 88 aircraft are assembled with their aircrews for the flypast segment.\n\nThe celebrations begin at 9:55&nbsp;am Moscow Standard Time with the arrival of the President and the [[Prime Minister of Russia]] to a special grandstand in front of [[Lenin's Mausoleum]], where six of the past parades were reviewed by national leaders. They greet the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, service commanders, deputy ministers in the Ministry of Defence and commanders of the support units within the Armed Forces, together with veterans, veterans' families and representatives of the Suvorov and Nakhimov Schools assembled. To the left and right of the grandstand are the stands wherein veterans, veterans' families and descendants and families of personnel killed in action are gathered. In between the grandstand to the south of the stands are two platoons of armed linemen and markers from the [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment]] in the Imperial-styled military uniforms and some unarmed half-companies of the Kremlin Regiment, both of which would be later taking post to mark the distance of the troops marching past and to line the square's western side facing the Kremlin together with extra drum majors from the Band Service, which are there to coordinate the march past to be timed in with the music of the bands since the parade of 1995. At the square, the parade commander (usually a Colonel General or rarely a General of the Army with the billet of Commander of the Ground Forces or as the Deputy Chief of General Staff) takes his place in a special an Aurus Senat armored limousine (formerly a Zil until 2018), having just received the report on the readiness of the parade from the commandant of the Combined Arms Academy who is a general officer.\n\nAs the [[Spasskaya Tower]] of the [[Kremlin]] sounds the chimes at 10&nbsp;am the parade commander orders the parade to present arms as the 154th PICR's 1st Honor Guard Company Colour Guard, to the melody of ''[[The Sacred War]]'' being played by the Massed Bands, marches into the square and past the dignitaries with guard carrying both the [[Flag of Russia]] and the [[Victory Banner]]. As the colour guards approach the grandstand, the colour officers execute eyes left and resume above face after passing by. This is followed by the parade being commanded to stand at ease after the colours take their place at the northwest end of the square fronting the [[State Historical Museum]], besides the colour of the Armed Forces. Then the Minister of Defence (usually a billet of a General of the Army) is driven on the limousine to the center of the square nearest the tribune, the parade presenting arms again at this point. The parade commander informs him of the readiness of the parade to be inspected. The report is received, and to the tune of the Massed Bands the Minister and the parade commander are driven to inspect the parading contingents each together with the bands. As the limousines stop the Minister sends Victory Day greetings to each of the parading contingents, in which they respond with a threefold loud ''[[Oorah (Marines)|Oorah]]'' that is heard all over the grounds. After the final greeting, the Massed Bands strike up to ''[[Slavsya]]'' from [[A Life for the Tsar]] as the PC returns to his place, the Minister driven to the grandstand amidst louds shouts of ''Oorah'' by the parade contingents where he dismounts the limousine and the [[corps of drums|Corps of Drums]] of the [[Moscow Military Music College]], an affiliate of the Suvorov Military Schools, take their place behind the parade commander's car led by the Commandant of the College and the college colour guard. The parade is ordered to stand at ease after the Minister informs the President that the parade is formed up for the march past in review and its inspection officially completed. In the 1965, 1985 and 1990 parades, the limousines would inspect the personnel of the mobile column at the Manezhnaya Square formed into battalions, in remembrance of the mounted inspection of the original 1945 parade, which included cavalry, [[tachanka]]s and [[horse artillery]] in addition to the huge mobile column. Following the report of the Minister of Defence, the keynote holiday address to the nation of the President follows, preceded by a fanfare by the Massed Bands, usually Govovin's ''Moscow Fanfare''. A moment of silence, since 2014, features as part of the keynote address.\n\nAs the president finishes the address and a threefold ''Oorah'' resounds all over the square by the entire parade assembled and the honor guard presents arms, the Massed Bands play the [[National Anthem of Russia]] and a ceremonial battery armed with the [[76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3)]] fire a [[21-gun salute]]. As the anthem ends, the bands sound Retreat as the honor guard executes order arms and the parade commander orders the parade to commence the march past in the following manner:\n\n::''Parade... attention! Ceremonial march past!''<br>''Form battalions! Distance by a single lineman! First battalion will remain in the right, remainder... left.. turn!''<br>''Slope.. arms!''\n\nAs the command is given to start the linemen take their places and the field markers also as well at the south end of the square. As the PC ends the commands with ''Eyes to the right, forward, quick march!'' the Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College, as is their tradition since 1938, march first to the tune of the  \"General Miloradovich\" by one of its late alumni, Lieutenant General [[Valery Khalilov]], one of the longest serving Senior Directors of Music of the Military Band Service and conductor of the Moscow area massed bands from 2002 to 2016, being played by the drummers and fifers. As the massed bands start playing the Corps of Drums stop playing by the signal of the Corps Drum Major and swings its drumsticks while on the eyes right. The Corps is followed by the colour guard of the 154th PICR and its 1st Honor Guard Company, during jubilee parades, the colour guard is followed by a company of colour bearers carrying the front standards in the order of their marchpast in the 1945 Victory Parade and their escorts, colours from the regiments, brigades and divisions which took part in the original 1945 parade and a historical unit of servicemen in period uniforms, optionally joined by the Kuban Cossacks, in memory of their contingent which marched past on that very parade, and the Escort Cavalry Squadron of the [[Kremlin Regiment]] plus a number of international contingents. This is followed by the rest of the parade ground column, starting with the youth contingents and by the Combined Arms Academy, among other troops.\n\nThe ground column ends, as the massed bands play either Victory Day or \"Let's Go\", with the traditional marchpast of the [[Moscow Higher Military Command School]], which has been done since the golden jubilee [[October Revolution Day]] parade of 1967 as a commemoration of the school's importance as the first military officer cadet school to be established in modern-day Russia, the first time it had been seen last in the Victory Day parade ground column was in 1985 (the two battalions of the school's Corps of Cadets also march past the square in memory of the cadets who fought in the 1941 [[Battle of Moscow]]). With the ground segment competed the bands stop playing at the signal of the senior director and the senior drum majors and, to give way to the mobile column, march towards the facade of the GUM department store, with two sections of the MMMC Corps of Drums at either side of the bands, reflecting the formations of the massed bands alongside the Corps of Drums in the Red Square parades of the 1950s and the 1960s.\n\nThe mobile column starts with the drivepast of historical vehicles in jubilee years. In non-special anniversary years only a T-34/85 medium battle tank carrying the Victory Banner leads the column of tens of military vehicles and equipment. As the Massed Bands play appropriate music the column drives past the stands in the Square, with the crew commanders and unit leaders executing a hand salute in the eyes right position (save for MRLs and mobile ICBMs). Following the end of the mobile column with the service flags of the three branches of the Armed Forces the flypast then follows, usually as the Bands play the ''Aviamarch'' and other air marches the flypast marks the formal termination of the parade with tens of aircraft from the Air Force flying past above the square in full view of everyone in attendance.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} \n\n===Full order of the parade===\nThe parade march past order, since the parade of 2010, is arranged in the following manner as it passes before the dignitaries:\n\n* Corps of Drums, Moscow Military Music College\n* [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment]]\n* Youth contingents\n** Survorov and Nakhimov Military Schools\n** Cadet Corps colleges of the Armed Forces and other uniformed organizations\n** [[Young Army Cadets National Movement]] Moscow Area (led by the Chairman, includes female students of the Moscow National Pensions School Cadet Corps)\n* [[Russian Ground Forces]]\n* [[Russian Aerospace Forces]]\n* Russian Navy\n* Regiment of female cadets of Armed Forces academies (starting 2016 as a battalion, expanded to full regiment in 2017)\n* Strategic Missile Troops\n* Russian Airborne Troops\n* Military Police (beginning 2018)\n* NBC Troops\n* Russian Railway Troops\n* Border Service of the Federal Security Service\n* Ministry of Emergency Situations\n* [[Police of Russia]] (beginning 2019)\n* [[National Guard of Russia]] [[Separate Operational Purpose Division]] ([[National Guard Forces Command]])\n* Military forces of the Western Military District\n* [[Moscow Higher Military Command School]] ''Supreme Soviet of Russia''\n\n===Preparations===\n[[File:EUCOM Image (2).jpg|thumb|The American contingent at the general rehearsal parade in [[Alabino]] in 2010.]]\nEarly preparations for the parade begin in the last two months of the previous year. In these early stages, organizers at the MoD discuss the size of the parade, units/military equipment attending, extra details and on jubilee years, the invitation pf foreign troops. During this time, regular participants practice their drill routines from their home units at various locations. Full parade rehearsals begin in March at a training center in the village of [[Alabino]], which is located in the [[Moscow Oblast]]. In their working uniforms, parade participants do a full run through of the entire ceremony to the closest extent possible. In the last week of April, the rehesals are moved to Red Square, as they are conducted in the evening time. The [[flypast]] segment of the parade begin during these practice runs with all aircraft practicing from the Kubinka airfield. In some cases, the flypast is rehearsed solely without any mobile and ground columns. Typically, the final dress rehearsal takes place 2-3 days before the actual parade and is usually livestreamed on outlets such as [[Ruptly]].\n\n===Presiding officers===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n! width=\"90\" |Year\n! width=\"90\" |Parade commander \n! width=\"90\" |Parade inspector  \n|-\n|1945\n|Marshal [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]]\n|Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]]\n|-\n|1965\n|General of the Army [[Afanasy Beloborodov]]\n|Marshal [[Rodion Malinovsky]]\n|-\n|1985\n|General of the Army [[Pyotr Lushev]]\n|Marshal [[Sergey Sokolov (commander)|Sergey Sokolov]]\n|-\n|1990\n|Colonel General [[Nikolai Vasilyevich Kalinin]]\n|Marshal [[Dmitry Yazov]]\n|-\n|1995\n|General of the Army [[Vladimir Govorov]]/Colonel General Leonid Kuznetsov\n|Marshal [[Viktor Kulikov]]/General of the Army [[Pavel Grachev]]\n|-\n|1996\n|Colonel General Leonid Kuznetsov\n|General of the Army [[Pavel Grachev]]\n|-\n|1997\n|Lieutenant General Igor Puzanov\n|General of the Army [[Igor Rodionov]]\n|-\n|1998\n|Colonel General Leonid Kuznetsov\n|Marshal [[Igor Sergeyev]]\n|-\n|1999\n|Colonel General Igor Puzanov\n|Marshal [[Igor Sergeyev]]\n|-\n|2000\n|General of the Army [[Vladimir Govorov]]/Colonel General Leonid Kuznetsov\n|Marshal [[Igor Sergeyev]]\n|-\n|2001\n|Colonel General Nikolai Makarov\n|[[Sergei Ivanov]]\n|-\n|2005\n|General of the Army Ivan Efremov\n|[[Sergei Ivanov]]\n|-\n|2006\n|General of the Army [[Vladimir Bakin]]\n|[[Sergei Ivanov]]\n|-\n|2007\n|General of the Army [[Vladimir Bakin]]\n|[[Anatoliy Serdyukov]]\n|-\n|2008\n|General of the Army [[Vladimir Bakin]]\n|[[Anatoliy Serdyukov]]\n|-\n|2009\n|General of the Army [[Vladimir Bakin]]\n|[[Anatoliy Serdyukov]]\n|-\n|2010\n|Colonel General [[Valery Gerasimov]]\n|[[Anatoliy Serdyukov]]\n|-\n|2014\n|Colonel General [[Oleg Salyukov]]\n|General of the Army [[Sergey Shoygu]]\n|-\n|2015\n|Colonel General [[Oleg Salyukov]]\n|General of the Army [[Sergey Shoygu]]\n|-\n|2016\n|Colonel General [[Oleg Salyukov]]\n|General of the Army [[Sergey Shoygu]]\n|-\n|2017\n|Colonel General [[Oleg Salyukov]]\n|General of the Army [[Sergey Shoygu]]\n|-\n|2018\n|Colonel General [[Oleg Salyukov]]\n|General of the Army [[Sergey Shoygu]]\n|-\n|2019\n|General of the Army [[Oleg Salyukov]]\n|General of the Army [[Sergey Shoygu]]\n|-\n|2020\n|General of the Army [[Oleg Salyukov]]\n|General of the Army [[Sergey Shoygu]]\n|}\n\n==Traditions and recent additions==\n[[File:20yearsvictory.jpg|thumb|A jubilee medal awarded for parade participants in 1965.]]\n2008 marked a return to tradition as well as the reorganization of the parade to fit the modern era. For the first time, a mobile column appeared at a Victory Day Parade in the Russian Federation appeared, a return to a tradition that was last seen in 1991, and abandoned in 1995. It was abandoned due to reconstruction of the [[Iberian Gate and Chapel]], which was originally destroyed to fill the very purpose of making way for tanks during the mobile column of the parade. That same year an [[airshow]] was introduced and it also became the first major Russian military parade to be seen on worldwide television when [[RT (TV network)|RT]] carried a live broadcast of the parade for the first time.

It was the longest and largest parade in the Soviet capital, lasting hours and utilizing 40,000 [[Red Army]] soldiers as well as 1,850 military vehicles. It took place over a month after the victory actually took place on 9 May, the day of Germany's surrender. Intensive preparations for the parade took place in late May and early June in Moscow. The preliminary rehearsal of the Victory Parade took place at [[Khodynka Aerodrome]], and the general rehearsal on Red Square on June 22. The day after the parade, a reception was held in the Grand Kremlin Palace in honor of the participants in the Victory Parade.<ref>https://www.prlib.ru/history/619337</ref> After the 1945 parade, Victory Day became obsolete in the [[Soviet Union]], with parades only being held on major jubilee, in part to make favor for the [[October Revolution Day]] parade which took place every year in the winter. In the decades that followed, 3 parades were held: in 1965, 1985<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/10/world/katyushas-and-missiles-in-red-square.html]</ref><ref>http://vvpobeda.shpl.ru/pob1985.html</ref>, and 1990.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dp.ru/a/2016/05/06/Parad_Pobedi|title=\u041a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u044b \u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044b \u0432 1945\u20132016 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0445|website=www.dp.ru|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tass.ru/obschestvo/1171423|title=\u0414\u0435\u043d\u044c \u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044b: \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432|website=\u0422\u0410\u0421\u0421|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref><ref>\u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0449\u0430\u0434\u0438 / \u041f\u043e\u0434 \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u0412.\u00a0\u041c.\u00a0\u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0418.\u00a0\u041f.\u00a0\u0420\u0435\u043f\u0438\u043d\u0430. 3-\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0434. \u041c., 1987.</ref><ref>https://m.sputnik-georgia.ru/russia/20200417/248265859/Istoriya-paradov-Pobedy-na-Krasnoy-ploschadi.html?mobile_return=no</ref>\n\nThe Victory Day Parade of 1995 was held to commemorate the [[golden jubilee]] of the Soviet victory in the war.<ref>http://tass.ru/obschestvo/1171423</ref> It was the first one held in the newly formed [[Russian Federation]], taking place 5 years after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]]. The parade was divided into two parts, a full military parade on [[Poklonnaya Hill]] and a veterans ceremony on [[Red Square]]. The [[2020 Moscow Victory Day Parade|2020 edition of the parade]], marking the [[diamond jubilee|75th anniversary]] of the victory over Nazi Germany, was postponed due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>https://tass.ru/obschestvo/8263303</ref><ref>https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/16/putin-postpones-75th-victory-day-parade-over-coronavirus-a70022</ref>  It was the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the resumption of military parades in 1995 that parade was to be cancelled on a holiday itself.\n\n==Description==\nOn the morning of the parade, an estimated 14,000 military personnel, including a regiment of female cadets and youth cadets, assemble by battalions on the square together with the more than 210 vehicles and 3,800 vehicle crews assembled on Tverskaya Street just north of the [[Manezhnaya Square, Moscow]], during the major parades a battalion or company of historical Red Army vehicles, estimated at around 36 vehicles and composed of just the [[T-34]], GAZ-67 and the SU-100 plus the optional BM-13N (or at around an estimated 480 when counting other vehicles of the war which would take part just like in the parades of 1985 and 1990) assemble on the street as well with modern military hardware of the Armed Forces and the National Guard (and optionally by the other uniformed organizations). At the air bases outside Moscow (in areas like [[Kubinka]]), more than 88 aircraft are assembled with their aircrews for the flypast segment.\n\nThe celebrations begin at 9:55&nbsp;am Moscow Standard Time with the arrival of the President and the [[Prime Minister of Russia]] to a special grandstand in front of [[Lenin's Mausoleum]], where six of the past parades were reviewed by national leaders. They greet the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, service commanders, deputy ministers in the Ministry of Defence and commanders of the support units within the Armed Forces, together with veterans, veterans' families and representatives of the Suvorov and Nakhimov Schools assembled. To the left and right of the grandstand are the stands wherein veterans, veterans' families and descendants and families of personnel killed in action are gathered. In between the grandstand to the south of the stands are two platoons of armed linemen and markers from the [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment]] in the Imperial-styled military uniforms and some unarmed half-companies of the Kremlin Regiment, both of which would be later taking post to mark the distance of the troops marching past and to line the square's western side facing the Kremlin together with extra drum majors from the Band Service, which are there to coordinate the march past to be timed in with the music of the bands since the parade of 1995. At the square, the parade commander (usually a Colonel General or rarely a General of the Army with the billet of Commander of the Ground Forces or as the Deputy Chief of General Staff) takes his place in a special an Aurus Senat armored limousine (formerly a Zil until 2018), having just received the report on the readiness of the parade from the commandant of the Combined Arms Academy who is a general officer.\n\nAs the [[Spasskaya Tower]] of the [[Kremlin]] sounds the chimes at 10&nbsp;am the parade commander orders the parade to present arms as the 154th PICR's 1st Honor Guard Company Colour Guard, to the melody of ''[[The Sacred War]]'' being played by the Massed Bands, marches into the square and past the dignitaries with guard carrying both the [[Flag of Russia]] and the [[Victory Banner]]. As the colour guards approach the grandstand, the colour officers execute eyes left and resume above face after passing by. This is followed by the parade being commanded to stand at ease after the colours take their place at the northwest end of the square fronting the [[State Historical Museum]], besides the colour of the Armed Forces. Then the Minister of Defence (usually a billet of a General of the Army) is driven on the limousine to the center of the square nearest the tribune, the parade presenting arms again at this point. The parade commander informs him of the readiness of the parade to be inspected. The report is received, and to the tune of the Massed Bands the Minister and the parade commander are driven to inspect the parading contingents each together with the bands. As the limousines stop the Minister sends Victory Day greetings to each of the parading contingents, in which they respond with a threefold loud ''[[Oorah (Marines)|Oorah]]'' that is heard all over the grounds. After the final greeting, the Massed Bands strike up to ''[[Slavsya]]'' from [[A Life for the Tsar]] as the PC returns to his place, the Minister driven to the grandstand amidst louds shouts of ''Oorah'' by the parade contingents where he dismounts the limousine and the [[corps of drums|Corps of Drums]] of the [[Moscow Military Music College]], an affiliate of the Suvorov Military Schools, take their place behind the parade commander's car led by the Commandant of the College and the college colour guard. The parade is ordered to stand at ease after the Minister informs the President that the parade is formed up for the march past in review and its inspection officially completed. In the 1965, 1985 and 1990 parades, the limousines would inspect the personnel of the mobile column at the Manezhnaya Square formed into battalions, in remembrance of the mounted inspection of the original 1945 parade, which included cavalry, [[tachanka]]s and [[horse artillery]] in addition to the huge mobile column. Following the report of the Minister of Defence, the keynote holiday address to the nation of the President follows, preceded by a fanfare by the Massed Bands, usually Govovin's ''Moscow Fanfare''. A moment of silence, since 2014, features as part of the keynote address.\n\nAs the president finishes the address and a threefold ''Oorah'' resounds all over the square by the entire parade assembled and the honor guard presents arms, the Massed Bands play the [[National Anthem of Russia]] and a ceremonial battery armed with the [[76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3)]] fire a [[21-gun salute]]. As the anthem ends, the bands sound Retreat as the honor guard executes order arms and the parade commander orders the parade to commence the march past in the following manner:\n\n::''Parade... attention! Ceremonial march past!''<br>''Form battalions! Distance by a single lineman! First battalion will remain in the right, remainder... left.. turn!''<br>''Slope.. arms!''\n\nAs the command is given to start the linemen take their places and the field markers also as well at the south end of the square. As the PC ends the commands with ''Eyes to the right, forward, quick march!'' the Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College, as is their tradition since 1938, march first to the tune of the  \"General Miloradovich\" by one of its late alumni, Lieutenant General [[Valery Khalilov]], one of the longest serving Senior Directors of Music of the Military Band Service and conductor of the Moscow area massed bands from 2002 to 2016, being played by the drummers and fifers. As the massed bands start playing the Corps of Drums stop playing by the signal of the Corps Drum Major and swings its drumsticks while on the eyes right. The Corps is followed by the colour guard of the 154th PICR and its 1st Honor Guard Company, during jubilee parades, the colour guard is followed by a company of colour bearers carrying the front standards in the order of their marchpast in the 1945 Victory Parade and their escorts, colours from the regiments, brigades and divisions which took part in the original 1945 parade and a historical unit of servicemen in period uniforms, optionally joined by the Kuban Cossacks, in memory of their contingent which marched past on that very parade, and the Escort Cavalry Squadron of the [[Kremlin Regiment]] plus a number of international contingents. This is followed by the rest of the parade ground column, starting with the youth contingents and by the Combined Arms Academy, among other troops.\n\nThe ground column ends, as the massed bands play either Victory Day or \"Let's Go\", with the traditional marchpast of the [[Moscow Higher Military Command School]], which has been done since the golden jubilee [[October Revolution Day]] parade of 1967 as a commemoration of the school's importance as the first military officer cadet school to be established in modern-day Russia, the first time it had been seen last in the Victory Day parade ground column was in 1985 (the two battalions of the school's Corps of Cadets also march past the square in memory of the cadets who fought in the 1941 [[Battle of Moscow]]). With the ground segment competed the bands stop playing at the signal of the senior director and the senior drum majors and, to give way to the mobile column, march towards the facade of the GUM department store, with two sections of the MMMC Corps of Drums at either side of the bands, reflecting the formations of the massed bands alongside the Corps of Drums in the Red Square parades of the 1950s and the 1960s.\n\nThe mobile column starts with the drivepast of historical vehicles in jubilee years. In non-special anniversary years only a T-34/85 medium battle tank carrying the Victory Banner leads the column of tens of military vehicles and equipment. As the Massed Bands play appropriate music the column drives past the stands in the Square, with the crew commanders and unit leaders executing a hand salute in the eyes right position (save for MRLs and mobile ICBMs). Following the end of the mobile column with the service flags of the three branches of the Armed Forces the flypast then follows, usually as the Bands play the ''Aviamarch'' and other air marches the flypast marks the formal termination of the parade with tens of aircraft from the Air Force flying past above the square in full view of everyone in attendance.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} \n\n===Full order of the parade===\nThe parade march past order, since the parade of 2010, is arranged in the following manner as it passes before the dignitaries:\n\n* Corps of Drums, Moscow Military Music College\n* [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment]]\n* Youth contingents\n** Survorov and Nakhimov Military Schools\n** Cadet Corps colleges of the Armed Forces and other uniformed organizations\n** [[Young Army Cadets National Movement]] Moscow Area (led by the Chairman, includes female students of the Moscow National Pensions School Cadet Corps)\n* [[Russian Ground Forces]]\n* [[Russian Aerospace Forces]]\n* Russian Navy\n* Regiment of female cadets of Armed Forces academies (starting 2016 as a battalion, expanded to full regiment in 2017)\n* Strategic Missile Troops\n* Russian Airborne Troops\n* Military Police (beginning 2018)\n* NBC Troops\n* Russian Railway Troops\n* Border Service of the Federal Security Service\n* Ministry of Emergency Situations\n* [[Police of Russia]] (beginning 2019)\n* [[National Guard of Russia]] [[Separate Operational Purpose Division]] ([[National Guard Forces Command]])\n* Military forces of the Western Military District\n* [[Moscow Higher Military Command School]] ''Supreme Soviet of Russia''\n\n===Preparations===\n[[File:EUCOM Image (2).jpg|thumb|The American contingent at the general rehearsal parade in [[Alabino]] in 2010.]]\nEarly preparations for the parade begin in the last two months of the previous year. In these early stages, organizers at the MoD discuss the size of the parade, units/military equipment attending, extra details and on jubilee years, the invitation pf foreign troops. During this time, regular participants practice their drill routines from their home units at various locations. Full parade rehearsals begin in March at a training center in the village of [[Alabino]], which is located in the [[Moscow Oblast]]. In their working uniforms, parade participants do a full run through of the entire ceremony to the closest extent possible. In the last week of April, the rehesals are moved to Red Square, as they are conducted in the evening time.

For the first time, a mobile column appeared at a Victory Day Parade in the Russian Federation appeared, a return to a tradition that was last seen in 1991, and abandoned in 1995. It was abandoned due to reconstruction of the [[Iberian Gate and Chapel]], which was originally destroyed to fill the very purpose of making way for tanks during the mobile column of the parade. That same year an [[airshow]] was introduced and it also became the first major Russian military parade to be seen on worldwide television when [[RT (TV network)|RT]] carried a live broadcast of the parade for the first time. In 2018, an [[exhibition drill]] performance by the 1st Honor Guard Company, [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment]] took part in the  segment of the parade together with a [[drumline]] from the [[Moscow Military Music College]] the first time since 2007 in a return to a tradition that began in the 2001 parade.

Avenatti stands accused of withholding client funds and applying most of the settlement money of $1.75 million, along with his included $1 million fee, in order to invest $2.5 million in a share of a private jet. He is further accused of misrepresenting Whiteside\u2019s settlement payment as monthly installments, which he paid out until June 2018, totaling $194,000.  Federal agents subsequently seized a Honda HA-420 twin-engine jet from Santa Barbara Airport that was co-owned by Avenatti and former client, Indigo Systems co-founder William J. Parrish, as the latter was about to embark on a flight. Parrish successfully sued Avenatti in 2017 for $2.1 million for failure to repay a 2013 loan.

Overall, the album is Mon\u00e1e's attempt to \"step into a more authentic self\".<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite web|last=Wortham|first=Jenna|title=How Janelle Mon\u00e1e Found Her Voice|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/magazine/how-janelle-monae-found-her-voice.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 19, 2018|accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release and promotion==\nOn February 16, 2018, Mon\u00e1e revealed her third studio album and the accompanying narrative film, entitled ''Dirty Computer'', through a teaser video released on YouTube.<ref name=\"wmag2018\">{{cite web|last=Marine|first=Brooke|title=Janelle Mon\u00e1e's ''Dirty Computer'' Trailer is Full of Symbolic Looks You May Have Missed|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/janelle-monae-dirty-computer-trailer-fashion|website=W Magazine|accessdate=February 17, 2018|date=February 16, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"pitchfork2018\">{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Michelle|title=Janelle Mon\u00e1e Announces New Album ''Dirty Computer''|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/janelle-monae-announces-new-album-dirty-computer/|website=Pitchfork|accessdate=February 17, 2018|date=February 16, 2018}}</ref> The teaser video aired nationwide in select theaters prior to screenings of ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''.<ref name=\"pitchfork2018\" /> Mon\u00e1e held a series of \"top-secret\" listening sessions in Los Angeles and New York prior to the album announcement.<ref>{{cite web|title=Janelle Monae Announces First Album in Five Years, 'Dirty Computer,' With Teaser Video|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/janelle-monae-new-album-dirty-computer-1202702146/|website=Variety|date=February 16, 2018|accessdate=February 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe album was released on April 27, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stream Janelle Monae's New Album 'Dirty Computer'|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8391774/janelle-monaes-dirty-computer-listen|work=Billboard|author=Rob Arcand|date=April 27, 2018|accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref> It was supported with the simultaneous release of a 46-minute short film of the same name, dubbed an \"emotion picture\" by Mon\u00e1e.

[Mon\u00e1e]'s layered sound is as contemporary as that of such digital trailblazers as [[Kendrick Lamar]] or [[Kanye West]], yet it has an old-fashioned organic quality that comes from a bedrock of live musicianship. ''Dirty Computer'' sounds like 2018 distilled into a sci-fi funk pop extravaganza by a female [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].\"<ref name=\"telegraph\"/> ''[[The Independent]]'' reviewer Roisin O'Connor stated that ''Dirty Computer'' is \"a record that will go down as a milestone not just as a work of art in its own right, but as the perfect celebration of queerness, female power, and self-worth.\"<ref name=\"independent\"/> Danette Chavez of ''[[The A.V.

It's hard not to wonder if her failure to connect with a mass audience might be because her desire to work with concepts and characters, rather than unburden herself, suggests a certain aloofness... She is as elusive as ever, and her mystery remains intact. Without a true loosening of her poise, her position on the margins of pop could remain intact as well.\"<ref name=\"guardian\"/> Zachary Hoskins from ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' declared that \"while the songs here are consistently hooky, they lack the earlier albums' sonic adventurousness... While Mon\u00e1e's heart is in the right place, her lyrics occasionally suffer from the clumsiness endemic to politicized pop...

The first deals with Mon\u00e1e's recognition of how she is viewed by society, the middle explores her acceptance of \"the cards she has been dealt\", and the closing tracks deal with her reclamation and redefinition of American identity.

[Mon\u00e1e]'s layered sound is as contemporary as that of such digital trailblazers as [[Kendrick Lamar]] or [[Kanye West]], yet it has an old-fashioned organic quality that comes from a bedrock of live musicianship. ''Dirty Computer'' sounds like 2018 distilled into a sci-fi funk pop extravaganza by a female [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].\"<ref name=\"telegraph\"/> ''[[The Independent]]'' reviewer Roisin O'Connor stated that ''Dirty Computer'' is \"a record that will go down as a milestone not just as a work of art in its own right, but as the perfect celebration of queerness, female power, and self-worth.\"<ref name=\"independent\"/> Danette Chavez of ''[[The A.V.

It's hard not to wonder if her failure to connect with a mass audience might be because her desire to work with concepts and characters, rather than unburden herself, suggests a certain aloofness... She is as elusive as ever, and her mystery remains intact. Without a true loosening of her poise, her position on the margins of pop could remain intact as well.\"<ref name=\"guardian\"/> Zachary Hoskins from ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' declared that \"while the songs here are consistently hooky, they lack the earlier albums' sonic adventurousness... While Mon\u00e1e's heart is in the right place, her lyrics occasionally suffer from the clumsiness endemic to politicized pop...

The system commands are the same as in CP/M-80. Executable files used the relocatable [[CMD file (CP/M)|.CMD file format]].<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_CMD\"/> Digital Research also produced a multi-user multitasking operating system compatible with CP/M-86, [[MP/M-86]], which later evolved into [[Concurrent CP/M-86]]. When an emulator was added to provide [[PC&nbsp;DOS]] compatibility, the system was renamed [[Concurrent DOS]], which later became [[Multiuser DOS]], of which [[REAL/32]] is the latest incarnation. The [[FlexOS]], [[DOS Plus]], and [[DR&nbsp;DOS]] families of operating systems started as derivations of Concurrent DOS as well.\n\n=={{anchor|Kanji}}History==\nDigital Research's CP/M-86 was originally announced to be released in November 1979, but was delayed repeatedly.<ref name=\"Paterson_2007_Design-DOS\"/> When [[IBM]] contacted other companies to obtain components for the [[IBM PC]], the as-yet unreleased CP/M-86 was its first choice for an [[operating system]] because CP/M had the most applications at the time. Negotiations between Digital Research and IBM quickly deteriorated over IBM's [[non-disclosure agreement]] and its insistence on a one-time fee rather than DRI's usual [[royalties|royalty]] licensing plan.<ref name=\"Freiberger_1984_Fire\"/>\nAfter discussions with [[Microsoft]], IBM decided to use [[86-DOS]] (QDOS), a CP/M-like operating system that Microsoft bought from [[Seattle Computer Products]] renaming it [[MS-DOS]]. Microsoft adapted it for PC, and licensed it to IBM. It was sold by IBM under the name of [[PC&nbsp;DOS]]. After learning about the deal, Digital Research founder [[Gary Kildall]] threatened to sue IBM for infringing DRI's [[intellectual property]], and IBM agreed to offer CP/M-86 as an alternative operating system on the PC to settle the claim. Most of the [[BIOS]] drivers for CP/M-86 for the IBM PC were written by [[Andy Johnson-Laird]].\n\n[[File:Digital Research CP-M-86 for the IBM Personal Computer Version 1.0 720x400.png|thumb|Digital Research CP/M-86 for the IBM Personal Computer Version 1.0]]\nThe IBM PC was announced on 12 August 1981, and the first machines began shipping in October the same year, ahead of schedule. CP/M-86 was one of three operating systems available from IBM, with PC&nbsp;DOS and [[UCSD p-System]].<ref name=\"williams198201\"/> Digital Research's adaptation of CP/M-86 for the IBM PC was released six months after PC&nbsp;DOS in spring 1982, and porting applications from CP/M-80 to either operating system was about equally difficult.<ref name=\"edlin19820607\"/> In November 1981, Digital Research also released a version for the proprietary [[IBM Displaywriter]].<ref name=\"Digital_Research_1981_News\"/><ref name=\"libes198112\"/>\n\n{{anchor|CP/M-86/80|CP/M 8-16}}On some [[multiprocessing|dual-processor]] 8-bit/16-bit computers special versions of CP/M-86 could natively run CP/M-86 and CP/M-80 applications.<ref name=\"pournelle198403\"/> A version for the [[DEC Rainbow]] was named CP/M-86/80, whereas the version for the {{ill|CompuPro System 816|sr|Compupro System 816}} was named CP/M&nbsp;8-16 (see also: [[MP/M&nbsp;8-16]]).<ref name=\"Kildall_1982_8-bit\"/><ref name=\"Compupro816\"/> The version of CP/M-86 for the 8085/8088-based [[Zenith Z-100]] supported running programs for both processors as well.\n\nWhen PC clones came about, Microsoft licensed MS-DOS to other companies as well. Experts found that the two operating systems were technically comparable, with CP/M-86 having better [[memory management]] but DOS being faster. ''[[BYTE Magazine|BYTE]]'' speculated that Microsoft reserving [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] for [[Xenix]] \"appears to leave a big opening\" for [[Concurrent CP/M-86]].<ref name=\"byte198207\"/>\n\nOn the IBM PC, however, at {{currency|amount=240|code=USD|fmt=gaps|linked=yes}} per copy for IBM's version, CP/M-86 sold poorly compared to the {{currency|amount=40|code=USD|fmt=gaps|linked=no}} PC&nbsp;DOS; one survey found that 96.3% of IBM PCs were ordered with DOS, compared to 3.4% with CP/M-86 or Concurrent CP/M-86.<ref name=\"pcommuniques198302\"/> In mid-1982 [[Lifeboat Associates]], perhaps the largest CP/M software vendor, announced its support for DOS over CP/M-86 on the IBM PC.<ref name=\"pc19820607\"/> ''BYTE'' warned that IBM, Microsoft, and Lifeboat's support for DOS \"poses a serious threat to\" CP/M-86,{{r|williams198201}} and [[Jerry Pournelle]] stated in the magazine that \"it is clear that Digital Research made some terrible mistakes in the marketing\".<ref name=\"pournelle198309\"/>\n\nBy early 1983 DRI began selling CP/M-86&nbsp;1.1 to end users for {{currency|amount=60|code=USD|fmt=gaps|linked=no}}.{{r|pcommuniques198302}} Advertisements called CP/M-86 a \"terrific value\", with \"instant access to the largest collection of applications software in existence \u2026 hundreds of proven, professional software programs for every business and education need\"; it also included [[Graphics System Extension]] (GSX), formerly {{currency|amount=75|code=USD|fmt=gaps|linked=no}}.<ref name=\"byte198306\"/> In May 1983 the company announced that it would offer DOS versions of all of its languages and utilities. It stated that \"obviously, PC&nbsp;DOS has made great market penetration on the IBM PC; we have to admit that\", but claimed that \"the fact that CP/M-86 has not done as well as DRI had hoped has nothing to do with our decision\".<ref name=\"hughes198307\"/> By early 1984 DRI gave free copies of Concurrent CP/M-86 to those who purchased two CP/M-86 applications as a limited time offer, and advertisements stated that the applications were [[PC booter|booter]]s, which did not require loading CP/M-86 first.<ref name=\"1984-02\"/> In January 1984, DRI also announced Kanji CP/M-86, a Japanese version of CP/M-86, for nine Japanese companies including [[Mitsubishi Electric Corporation]], [[Sanyo Electric Co. Ltd.]], [[Sord Computer Corp.]]<ref name=\"CW_1984_News\"/><ref name=\"CW_1984_Kanji\"/><ref name=\"Philippi_1984_DRI\"/> In December 1984 [[Fujitsu]] announced a number of [[FM-16]]-based machines using Kanji CP/M-86.<ref name=\"CW_1984_22\"/><ref name=\"Hiroshi_2006\"/>\n\nCP/M-86 and DOS had very similar functionality, but were not compatible because the system calls for the same functions and [[program file]] formats were different, so two versions of the same software had to be produced and marketed to run under both operating systems. The command interface again had similar functionality but different syntax; where CP/M-86 (and CP/M) copied file <code>SOURCE</code> to <code>TARGET</code> with the command <code>[[Peripheral Interchange Program|PIP]] TARGET=SOURCE</code>, DOS used <code>COPY SOURCE TARGET</code>.\n\nInitially MS-DOS and CP/M-86 also ran on computers not necessarily hardware-compatible with the IBM PC such as the [[Apricot Computers|Apricot]] and [[Sirius Systems Technology|Sirius]], the intention being that software would be independent of hardware by making standardised operating [[system call]]s to a version of the operating system custom tailored to the particular hardware. However, writers of software which required fast performance accessed the IBM PC hardware directly instead of going through the operating system, resulting in PC-specific software which performed better than other MS-DOS and CP/M-86 versions; for example, games would display fast by writing to video memory directly instead of suffering the delay of making a call to the operating system, which would then write to a hardware-dependent memory location. Non-PC-compatible computers were soon replaced by models with hardware which behaved identically to the PC's. A consequence of the universal adoption of detailed PC architecture was that no more than 640 kilobytes of memory were supported; early machines running MS-DOS and CP/M-86 did not suffer from this restriction, and some could make use of nearly one megabyte of RAM.\n\n==Reception==\n''[[PC Magazine]]'' wrote that CP/M-86 \"in several ways seems better fitted to the PC\" than DOS; however, for those who did not plan to program in assembly language, because it cost six times more \"CP/M seems a less compelling purchase\". It stated that CP/M-86 was strong in areas where DOS was weak, and vice versa, and that the level of application support for each operating system would be most important, although CP/M-86's lack of a run-time version for applications was a weakness.{{r|edlin19820607}}\n\n=={{anchor|1.0|1.1|CP/M-86 Plus 3.1|PCP/M-86 1.0|PCP/M-86 2.0|PCP/M-86 2.11|PCP/M-86 3.1}}Versions==\nA given version of CP/M-86 has two version numbers.

The system commands are the same as in CP/M-80. Executable files used the relocatable [[CMD file (CP/M)|.CMD file format]].<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_CMD\"/> Digital Research also produced a multi-user multitasking operating system compatible with CP/M-86, [[MP/M-86]], which later evolved into [[Concurrent CP/M-86]]. When an emulator was added to provide [[PC&nbsp;DOS]] compatibility, the system was renamed [[Concurrent DOS]], which later became [[Multiuser DOS]], of which [[REAL/32]] is the latest incarnation. The [[FlexOS]], [[DOS Plus]], and [[DR&nbsp;DOS]] families of operating systems started as derivations of Concurrent DOS as well.\n\n=={{anchor|Kanji}}History==\nDigital Research's CP/M-86 was originally announced to be released in November 1979, but was delayed repeatedly.<ref name=\"Paterson_2007_Design-DOS\"/> When [[IBM]] contacted other companies to obtain components for the [[IBM PC]], the as-yet unreleased CP/M-86 was its first choice for an [[operating system]] because CP/M had the most applications at the time. Negotiations between Digital Research and IBM quickly deteriorated over IBM's [[non-disclosure agreement]] and its insistence on a one-time fee rather than DRI's usual [[royalties|royalty]] licensing plan.<ref name=\"Freiberger_1984_Fire\"/>\nAfter discussions with [[Microsoft]], IBM decided to use [[86-DOS]] (QDOS), a CP/M-like operating system that Microsoft bought from [[Seattle Computer Products]] renaming it [[MS-DOS]]. Microsoft adapted it for PC, and licensed it to IBM. It was sold by IBM under the name of [[PC&nbsp;DOS]]. After learning about the deal, Digital Research founder [[Gary Kildall]] threatened to sue IBM for infringing DRI's [[intellectual property]], and IBM agreed to offer CP/M-86 as an alternative operating system on the PC to settle the claim. Most of the [[BIOS]] drivers for CP/M-86 for the IBM PC were written by [[Andy Johnson-Laird]].\n\n[[File:Digital Research CP-M-86 for the IBM Personal Computer Version 1.0 720x400.png|thumb|Digital Research CP/M-86 for the IBM Personal Computer Version 1.0]]\nThe IBM PC was announced on 12 August 1981, and the first machines began shipping in October the same year, ahead of schedule. CP/M-86 was one of three operating systems available from IBM, with PC&nbsp;DOS and [[UCSD p-System]].<ref name=\"williams198201\"/> Digital Research's adaptation of CP/M-86 for the IBM PC was released six months after PC&nbsp;DOS in spring 1982, and porting applications from CP/M-80 to either operating system was about equally difficult.<ref name=\"edlin19820607\"/> In November 1981, Digital Research also released a version for the proprietary [[IBM Displaywriter]].<ref name=\"Digital_Research_1981_News\"/><ref name=\"libes198112\"/>\n\n{{anchor|CP/M-86/80|CP/M 8-16}}On some [[multiprocessing|dual-processor]] 8-bit/16-bit computers special versions of CP/M-86 could natively run CP/M-86 and CP/M-80 applications.<ref name=\"pournelle198403\"/> A version for the [[DEC Rainbow]] was named CP/M-86/80, whereas the version for the {{ill|CompuPro System 816|sr|Compupro System 816}} was named CP/M&nbsp;8-16 (see also: [[MP/M&nbsp;8-16]]).<ref name=\"Kildall_1982_8-bit\"/><ref name=\"Compupro816\"/> The version of CP/M-86 for the 8085/8088-based [[Zenith Z-100]] supported running programs for both processors as well.\n\nWhen PC clones came about, Microsoft licensed MS-DOS to other companies as well. Experts found that the two operating systems were technically comparable, with CP/M-86 having better [[memory management]] but DOS being faster. ''[[BYTE Magazine|BYTE]]'' speculated that Microsoft reserving [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] for [[Xenix]] \"appears to leave a big opening\" for [[Concurrent CP/M-86]].<ref name=\"byte198207\"/>\n\nOn the IBM PC, however, at {{currency|amount=240|code=USD|fmt=gaps|linked=yes}} per copy for IBM's version, CP/M-86 sold poorly compared to the {{currency|amount=40|code=USD|fmt=gaps|linked=no}} PC&nbsp;DOS; one survey found that 96.3% of IBM PCs were ordered with DOS, compared to 3.4% with CP/M-86 or Concurrent CP/M-86.<ref name=\"pcommuniques198302\"/> In mid-1982 [[Lifeboat Associates]], perhaps the largest CP/M software vendor, announced its support for DOS over CP/M-86 on the IBM PC.<ref name=\"pc19820607\"/> ''BYTE'' warned that IBM, Microsoft, and Lifeboat's support for DOS \"poses a serious threat to\" CP/M-86,{{r|williams198201}} and [[Jerry Pournelle]] stated in the magazine that \"it is clear that Digital Research made some terrible mistakes in the marketing\".<ref name=\"pournelle198309\"/>\n\nBy early 1983 DRI began selling CP/M-86&nbsp;1.1 to end users for {{currency|amount=60|code=USD|fmt=gaps|linked=no}}.{{r|pcommuniques198302}} Advertisements called CP/M-86 a \"terrific value\", with \"instant access to the largest collection of applications software in existence \u2026 hundreds of proven, professional software programs for every business and education need\"; it also included [[Graphics System Extension]] (GSX), formerly {{currency|amount=75|code=USD|fmt=gaps|linked=no}}.<ref name=\"byte198306\"/> In May 1983 the company announced that it would offer DOS versions of all of its languages and utilities. It stated that \"obviously, PC&nbsp;DOS has made great market penetration on the IBM PC; we have to admit that\", but claimed that \"the fact that CP/M-86 has not done as well as DRI had hoped has nothing to do with our decision\".<ref name=\"hughes198307\"/> By early 1984 DRI gave free copies of Concurrent CP/M-86 to those who purchased two CP/M-86 applications as a limited time offer, and advertisements stated that the applications were [[PC booter|booter]]s, which did not require loading CP/M-86 first.<ref name=\"1984-02\"/> In January 1984, DRI also announced Kanji CP/M-86, a Japanese version of CP/M-86, for nine Japanese companies including [[Mitsubishi Electric Corporation]], [[Sanyo Electric Co. Ltd.]], [[Sord Computer Corp.]]<ref name=\"CW_1984_News\"/><ref name=\"CW_1984_Kanji\"/><ref name=\"Philippi_1984_DRI\"/> In December 1984 [[Fujitsu]] announced a number of [[FM-16]]-based machines using Kanji CP/M-86.<ref name=\"CW_1984_22\"/><ref name=\"Hiroshi_2006\"/>\n\nCP/M-86 and DOS had very similar functionality, but were not compatible because the system calls for the same functions and [[program file]] formats were different, so two versions of the same software had to be produced and marketed to run under both operating systems. The command interface again had similar functionality but different syntax; where CP/M-86 (and CP/M) copied file <code>SOURCE</code> to <code>TARGET</code> with the command <code>[[Peripheral Interchange Program|PIP]] TARGET=SOURCE</code>, DOS used <code>COPY SOURCE TARGET</code>.\n\nInitially MS-DOS and CP/M-86 also ran on computers not necessarily hardware-compatible with the IBM PC such as the [[Apricot Computers|Apricot]] and [[Sirius Systems Technology|Sirius]], the intention being that software would be independent of hardware by making standardised operating [[system call]]s to a version of the operating system custom tailored to the particular hardware. However, writers of software which required fast performance accessed the IBM PC hardware directly instead of going through the operating system, resulting in PC-specific software which performed better than other MS-DOS and CP/M-86 versions; for example, games would display fast by writing to video memory directly instead of suffering the delay of making a call to the operating system, which would then write to a hardware-dependent memory location. Non-PC-compatible computers were soon replaced by models with hardware which behaved identically to the PC's. A consequence of the universal adoption of detailed PC architecture was that no more than 640 kilobytes of memory were supported; early machines running MS-DOS and CP/M-86 did not suffer from this restriction, and some could make use of nearly one megabyte of RAM.\n\n==Reception==\n''[[PC Magazine]]'' wrote that CP/M-86 \"in several ways seems better fitted to the PC\" than DOS; however, for those who did not plan to program in assembly language, because it cost six times more \"CP/M seems a less compelling purchase\". It stated that CP/M-86 was strong in areas where DOS was weak, and vice versa, and that the level of application support for each operating system would be most important, although CP/M-86's lack of a run-time version for applications was a weakness.{{r|edlin19820607}}\n\n=={{anchor|1.0|1.1|CP/M-86 Plus 3.1|PCP/M-86 1.0|PCP/M-86 2.0|PCP/M-86 2.11|PCP/M-86 3.1}}Versions==\nA given version of CP/M-86 has two version numbers.
