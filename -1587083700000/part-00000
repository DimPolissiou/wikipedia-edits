Since the 1960s, as part of the [[Native American civil rights|indigenous civil rights movements]], there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and their supporters. The protests target the prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the [[Cleveland Indians]] (in particular their \"[[Chief Wahoo]]\" logo, now officially retired); and the [[Washington Redskins]] (the term \"[[redskin]]s\" being defined in most American English dictionaries as \"derogatory slang\"). Changes, such as the retirement of Native American names and mascots in a wide array of schools, has been a steady trend since the 1970s.\n\nThe issue is often discussed in the media only in terms of the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a more comprehensive understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why sports teams should eliminate the utilization of such terms.<ref name=\"King.2010\">{{cite book| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC| editor=C.

Defenders of the current usage often state their intention to honor Native Americans by referring to positive traits, such as fighting spirit and being strong, brave, stoic, dedicated, and proud; while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of Native Americans as savages.<ref name=\"Davis.2010\">{{cite journal| issn = 1068-3844| volume = 9| issue = 4| pages = 11\u201314| last = Davis| first = Laurel R.| title = The problems with Native American mascots| journal = Multicultural Education| accessdate = October 10, 2017|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ649928}}</ref> In general, the social sciences recognize that all stereotypes, whether positive or negative, are harmful because they promote false or misleading associations between a group and an attribute, fostering a disrespectful relationship.

The team that moved to become the [[Washington Redskins]] in 1937 was originally also known as the Boston Braves since the [[American football|football]] and baseball teams played at [[Braves Field]]. After moving to [[Fenway Park]], home of the [[Boston Red Sox]], the team name was changed to the Boston Redskins in 1933, using a \"red\" identifier while retaining the Braves \"Indian Head\" logo.

Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by [[African American]]s and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process.

Since the 1960s, as part of the [[Native American civil rights|indigenous civil rights movements]], there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and their supporters. The protests target the prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the [[Cleveland Indians]] (in particular their \"[[Chief Wahoo]]\" logo, now officially retired); and the [[Washington Redskins]] (the term \"[[redskin]]s\" being defined in most American English dictionaries as \"derogatory slang\"). Changes, such as the retirement of Native American names and mascots in a wide array of schools, has been a steady trend since the 1970s.\n\nThe issue is often discussed in the media only in terms of the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a more comprehensive understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why sports teams should eliminate the utilization of such terms.<ref name=\"King.2010\">{{cite book| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC| editor=C.

Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by [[African American]]s and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process.

The crew module was separated at the intended height of 126&nbsp;km and a speed of 5300&nbsp;m/s.

At this altitude, the propulsion was shut down. The heat shield experienced temperatures around 1,000 degrees C and the capsule experienced deceleration of up to 13 g.<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/unmanned-crew-module-to-be-tested/article6679866.ece Unmanned crew module to be tested] 10 December 2014 The Hindu</ref>\n\nAfter the re-entry the vehicle performed a descent and splashdown during which an end-to-end validation of the parachute system was performed, including the demonstration of the apex cover separation and the parachute deployment in cluster configuration. The deployment sequence started when CARE had slowed down to a speed of 233&nbsp;m/s. The crew module carried three stages of parachutes, all of which came in pairs. First, both 2.3-meter diameter pilot parachutes came out, followed by the 6.2-meter [[drogue parachute]]s, which cut the capsule's velocity down to 50&nbsp;m/s. Then both main parachutes were deployed at a height of about 5&nbsp;km.

It was undertaken ahead of laying a railroad track with aid from the [[Israel Railway Authority]].

Although the mound itself was not excavated, the finds in the provide knowledge about the settlement history of Tel Shor.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Bronze and Iron Ages ===\nThe earliest artifacts were found close to the mound in a settlement layer with potsherds from the Early Bronze Age II. North of the site were few potsherds from the Middle and Late Bronze Ages. In one of the burials found in the site was a flask dated either to the Late Bronze Age or to the Early Iron Age.

One jewel was made of an unidentified metal, possibly silver. Next to one of the deceased was a vessel decorated with a geometric pattern.
