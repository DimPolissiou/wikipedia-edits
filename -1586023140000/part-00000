The conservation area spans three municipalities which include Liberty Borough, Lincoln Borough, and Elizabeth Township. The property is owned and managed by [[Allegheny Land Trust]] and is open year round to the public for educational and recreational purposes.        \n\n== The Conservation Area ==\n\n\nDead Man's Hollow was established as a conservation area in 1996 and is considered to be the largest privately protected area in Allegheny County.\n\nSince the mid 1990s, volunteers from Allegheny Land Trust and other non-profit conservation groups based in the PIttsburgh region have made significant progress in removing trash and debris as well as invasive plant species from the property. This continued effort has allowed the area to return to a lush green wonderland beneath a canopy of native hardwoods.\n\nThe Dead Man's Hollow conservation area is also the home to a variety of Pennsylvania wildlife including twenty-four different species of birds.\n\nIn January of 2017, the [[Pennsylvania's Department of Conservation]] and Natural Resources designated the area as a [[Wild Plant Sanctuary]].\n\n<br />\n\n== Industrial History ==\n[[File:Dead Man's Hollow.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Boiler House \"ruins\" of the Union Sewer Pipe Company in Dead Man's Hollow.]]\n\n\nThe remnants of two industrial businesses that once thrived in the McKeesport area, the Bowman Brickyard and the Union Sewer Pipe Company, can also be found throughout the Dead Man's Hollow conservation area. Operations for both companies began in the late 1880s and lasted until a devastating fire brought it to an end in 1920.  A number of the established hiking trails give visitors the unique opportunity to <s>\"</s>step back in time<s>\"</s> while exploring the \"factory ruins\".  Among the most visited locations at the former industrial site are the large circular foundations of kiln ovens that were used in the pipe making process as well as the decaying graffiti covered walls of the company's boiler house. Other notable locations are the slightly curved wall of a former P&LE Railroad siding and an oversized drainage tunnel leading to the Youghiogheny River. \n\n== Haunted History ==\n\n\nAs the story goes, Dead Man's Hollow earned its dismal name in 1874 when a group of adolescent boys were roaming through the hollow and came upon a decomposed body that was hanging by a noose. The victim was never identified and no one was ever charged for the murder. Soon the natural isolation of the hollow became the setting for other dark tales of criminal acts and untimely deaths.  From suspicious drownings and violent gunfights to tragic explosions and lightning strikes, Dead Man's Hollow has been the scene of many grisly incidents and accidents.  Supposedly one or more of these bizarre tales have prompted quite a few encounters with the unknown in the secluded hollow.  Visitors to the site often return with unexplainable stories involving a shadowy presence, strange odors, and even the sound of voices when no one else was near.  \n<br />\n\n== Recreation ==\n\nWith over eight miles of hiking trails throughout Dead Man's Hollow, visitors can easily spend an entire day (or night) exploring the conservation area.  And with its close proximity to the Great Allegheny Passage recreational trail, Dead Man's Hollow has become a welcome place for cyclists to stop and relax for a few minutes.\n\nAccording to the Allegheny Land trust website, Open Hunting is permitted on this property as long as individuals apply for a free permit before hunting on any conservation area. It has also been suggested that anyone wishing to use the property for hunting purposes be familiar with the established trail system and avoid the areas where human interaction is likely.\n<br />\n\n== Media History ==\n\n\nOver the years, the stories of Dead Man's Hollow have been featured in numerous articles printed in the McKeesport Daily News and the Pittsburgh Post Gazette.\n\nIn 2000, many of Dead Man's Hollow's tales made their debut in book format thanks to a former resident of Lincoln Borough named Karen Frank. With the help of the community, Frank compiled a number of old photographs and historical stories about the history of Dead Man's Hollow. No long after the book <u>Dead Man's Hollow : An Oral History and More</u> was released in limited quantity and quickly sold out.  Today, history enthusiasts have made this out-of-print publication is one of the most sought-after books in Southwestern Pennsylvania.\n\nDead Man's Hollow returned to the pages of another book in 2009 when History Press released <u>Legends & Lore of Western Pennsylvania</u>.  Written by folklore historian Thomas White, this particular book has been hailed by many as the best source of information on every ghostly legend that calls Dead Man's Hollow home. \n\nIn 2010, Dead Man's Hollow was launched into the 21st Century when it received its very own official website.

It was situated in a low-lying area of the region, so, during his invasion of Persia, [[Alexander the Great]] was able to drown the city by directing the flow of a river into the city. The lake he created remained until [[Ardashir I]] built a [[Drainage tunnel|tunnel]] to drain it. He founded his new capital city on this site.\n\n[[Ardashir I|Ardashir]]'s new city was known as ''Khor Ardash\u012br'', ''Ardash\u012br Khurrah'' and ''G\u014dr''. It had a circular plan so precise in measurement that the [[Persian people|Persian]] historian [[Ibn Balkhi]] wrote it to be \"devised using a compass\". It was protected by a trench 50 meters in width, and was 2 kilometers in diameter. The city had four gates; to the north was the Hormozd Gate, to the south the Ardashir Gate, to the east the [[Mithra]] Gate and to the west the Wahram Gate. The royal capital's compounds were constructed at the center of a circle 450&nbsp;m in radius. At the center of the town there was a lofty platform or tower, called ''[[Terbal]]''. It was 30&nbsp;m high and spiral in design. The design is unique in Iran, and there are several theories regarding the purpose of its construction.<ref name=\"ardasir-korra\" /><ref name=firuzabad>http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/firuzabad</ref> It is thought to have been the architectural predecessor of the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]] of [[Iraq]] and its distinctive minaret, the ''malwiya''.<ref>http://rch.ac.ir/article/Details?id=10224</ref> In the Sasanian period, the abbreviation ART (in [[Inscriptional Pahlavi]]) was used as the mint signature to refer to G\u014dr.<ref>https://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/e-sasanika6-Miri.pdf</ref>\n\nGor and [[Istakhr]] strenuously resisted the [[Muslim conquest of Pars|invading Arab Muslims]] in the 630s and 640s; they were conquered by Abdallah ibn Amr in 649\u201350.<ref name=\"ardasir-korra\" />\n\nThe city's importance was revived again in the reign of [[Adud al-Dawla]] of the [[Buyid dynasty]], who frequently used the city as his residence. It is at this time that the old name of the city, ''G\u014dr'', was abandoned in favor of the new. In New Persian, spoken at the time, the word ''G\u014dr'' ({{lang|fa|\u06af\u0648\u0631}}) had come to mean \"grave.\" King Adud al-Dawla, as the story goes, found it distasteful to reside in a \"grave.\" Per his instruction, the city's name was changed to ''Peroz-abad'', \"City of Victory.\" Since then, the city has been known by variations of that name, including ''Firuzabad'' ({{lang|fa|\u0641\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u0632\u0622\u0628\u0627\u062f}} ''F\u012br\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d'').<ref name=\"ardasir-korra\">http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ardasir-korra</ref> However, there is a 7th-century [[Arab-Sassanian coin]] from [[Ardashir-Khwarra]] during [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] period in which pylwj'b'd ([[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]]; ''P\u0113r\u014dz\u0101b\u0101d'') is mentioned as the mint.<ref>http://numismatics.org/collection/1985.43.2</ref><ref name=sasanika>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/e-sasanika6-Miri.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404120535/http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/e-sasanika6-Miri.pdf |archive-date=2016-04-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe city was eventually abandoned in [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] period and its nearby settlement was populated, which is now the modern Firuzabad located 3&nbsp;km to the east of the site of Gor.<ref name=sasanika /> Today, among the attractions of Firuzabad are the Sassanid [[Ghal'eh Dokhtar]], the [[Palace of Ardeshir]], and the fire temple and [[Pillar of Gor|its nearby Minar]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Iran}}\n* [[Ghal'eh Dokhtar]] in Firuzabad\n* [[Palace of Ardeshir]] in Firuzabad\n* [[Bishapur]]\n* [[Cities of the Ancient Near East]]\n* [[Round city of Baghdad]], modeled after Firuzabad and other Parthian and Sassanian round cities\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | article = ARDA\u0160\u012aR-\u1e34ORRA | last = Bosworth | first = C.

The city had four gates; to the north was the Hormozd Gate, to the south the Ardashir Gate, to the east the [[Mithra]] Gate and to the west the Wahram Gate. The royal capital's compounds were constructed at the center of a circle 450&nbsp;m in radius. At the center of the town there was a lofty platform or tower, called ''[[Terbal]]''. It was 30&nbsp;m high and spiral in design. The design is unique in Iran, and there are several theories regarding the purpose of its construction.<ref name=\"ardasir-korra\" /><ref name=firuzabad>http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/firuzabad</ref> It is thought to have been the architectural predecessor of the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]] of [[Iraq]] and its distinctive minaret, the ''malwiya''.<ref>http://rch.ac.ir/article/Details?id=10224</ref> In the Sasanian period, the abbreviation ART (in [[Inscriptional Pahlavi]]) was used as the mint signature to refer to G\u014dr.<ref>https://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/e-sasanika6-Miri.pdf</ref>\n\nGor and [[Istakhr]] strenuously resisted the [[Muslim conquest of Pars|invading Arab Muslims]] in the 630s and 640s; they were conquered by Abdallah ibn Amr in 649-50.<ref name=\"ardasir-korra\" />\n\nThe city's importance was revived again in the reign of [[Adud al-Dawla]] of the [[Buyid dynasty]], who frequently used the city as his residence.

In New Persian, spoken at the time, the word ''G\u014dr'' ({{lang|fa|\u06af\u0648\u0631}}) had come to mean \"grave.\" King Adud al-Dawla, as the story goes, found it distasteful to reside in a \"grave.\" Per his instruction, the city's name was changed to ''Peroz-abad'', \"City of Victory.\" Since then, the city has been known by variations of that name, including ''Firuzabad'' ({{lang|fa|\u0641\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u0632\u0622\u0628\u0627\u062f}} ''F\u012br\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d'').<ref name=\"ardasir-korra\">http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ardasir-korra</ref> However, there is a 7th-century [[Arab-Sassanian coin]] from [[Ardashir-Khwarra]] during [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] period in which pylwj'b'd ([[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]]; ''P\u0113r\u014dz\u0101b\u0101d'') is mentioned as the mint.<ref>http://numismatics.org/collection/1985.43.2</ref><ref name=sasanika>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/e-sasanika6-Miri.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404120535/http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/e-sasanika6-Miri.pdf |archive-date=2016-04-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe city was eventually abandoned in [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] period and its nearby settlement was populated, which is now the modern Firuzabad located 3&nbsp;km to the east of the site of Gor.<ref name=sasanika /> Today, among the attractions of Firuzabad are the Sassanid [[Ghal'eh Dokhtar]], the [[Palace of Ardeshir]], and the fire temple and [[Pillar of Gor|its nearby Minar]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Iran}}\n* [[Ghal'eh Dokhtar]] in Firuzabad\n* [[Palace of Ardeshir]] in Firuzabad\n* [[Bishapur]]\n* [[Cities of the Ancient Near East]]\n* [[Round city of Baghdad]], modeled after Firuzabad and other Parthian and Sassanian round cities\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | article = ARDA\u0160\u012aR-\u1e34ORRA | last = Bosworth | first = C.

It is located at 22495 Chinsegut Hill Road. Begun in the early 1850s, the structure has remained relatively unchanged since.\n\n==History==\nWith the conclusion of the [[Second Seminole War]] (1835\u20131842) and the passing of the [[Armed Occupation Act]] on August 4, 1842, the character of [[Florida]] was transformed. In the interior of the Florida peninsula, devoid of white settlement just 10 years before, [[Plantation (settlement or colony)|plantations]] were rapidly established. By the eve of statehood, planters maintained that nearly half the population and wealth of the territory was now located in central Florida.<ref>Tebeau, Charlton W.  ''A History of Florida''.  Coral Gables:  University of Miami Press, 1971.</ref>\n\nDrawn to central Florida by the opportunity offered by the [[Armed Occupation Act]], Colonel Byrd Pearson from [[South Carolina]] laid claim to 160 acres in what is now [[Hernando County]]. He named his plantation Mount Airy and began cultivating [[sugarcane]] with the use of [[slavery|slave labor]].<ref>Stanaback, Richard J.  A History of Hernando County.  Brooksville, Florida: Richard J. Stanaback, 1976.</ref>  Pearson constructed a cabin on the site that is now the East Wing of the Manor.  Pearson's cabin was completed just two years after Florida became a state.<ref>Stanaback, ''Hernando'', p. 12-13.</ref>\n\nIn 1851, Pearson sold the property to another South Carolinian emigrant to Florida named Francis Higgins Ederington. When Ederington purchased the property, he named it Mt. Airy. <ref> Stanaback, ''Hernando'', p. 21. </ref> Between 1852 and 1854, Ederington constructed  the manor house.<ref>Stanaback, ''Hernando'', p. 295.</ref>\n\nIn 1866, Colonel Russel Snow (also a South Carolinian) married Francis Ederington's  daughter Charlotte and gained control of the plantation, renaming it Snow Hill. The Snows remodeled the third-floor attic into three bedrooms and a seating area.<ref>Stanaback, ''Hernando'', p. 295: Money, Eddie.  \u201cChinsegut Chronology.\u201d USF Library Special Collections, Tampa, Florida. n.p.</ref>\n\n==Ederington/Snow Era==\n\nIn 1851, Anderson Mayo and Francis Ederington of South Carolina visited Hernando County and were very much impressed with what they found. Ederington and Mayo were wealthy plantation owners from the Piedmont section in South Carolina. Francis Ederington purchased from Colonel Byrd Pearson the property now referred to as Chinsegut Hill. Ederington then returned home to Fairfield County, South Carolina. In 1852, Francis Ederington and his family moved from South Carolina to Florida, bringing with them their livestock, farming equipment and household goods together with slaves. They settled on the hill and named it Mount Airy. Colonel Pearson had built a small home there, which Francis Ederington enlarged until it was about the size of the present manor house. The main initial production at Mount Airy was cane. cotton, and corn. They expanded into citrus and livestock and also harvesting timber. When the Great Freeze of Florida came in 1895, even though groves were frozen out, several trees on top of Mount Airy/ Snow Hill survived and were used to provide bud stock for nurseries and groves that were later acquired and helped to restart Florida's citrus production. It is believed to be the oldest house standing in Hernando County. <ref> McKethan, ''Hernando County: Our Story'', p. 24-27. </ref>\n\nFrancis Ederington raised a large family of seven daughters and two sons. One of the sons, Mallory, went away to college and died there. The other son, Frank Jr., continued to live in Hernando County and died when he was ninety-four years old. He did not have any children. All the girls married, with the exception of Caroline who died. Many of the descendants of these marriages reside in and around Hernando County today.  <ref> McKethan, ''Hernando County: Our Story'', p. 26-27. </ref>\n\nFrancis Ederington was a member of the old Guards Mounted Rangers during the Civil War. <ref> McKethan, ''Hernando County: Our Story'', p. 161. </ref>\n\nDorthy Ederington, daughter of Francis Ederington, married John J. Hale, the son of Joseph Hale and one of early pioneers of old Hernando County. John and Dorthy Ederington Hale were the grandparents of Alfred A. McKethan.  <ref> McKethan, ''Hernando County: Our Story'', p. 27. </ref>\n\nCharlotte Ederington, daughter of Francis Ederington, married Dr. James R. Snow from Georgetown, South Carolina. Dr. J.R. Snow first came to Hernando County in 1861 leaving the same year with Cr Company of the 3rd Florida Infantry for the Civil War. Charlotte and J.R. bought the interests of her sister in Mount Airy and renamed the property Snow Hill. Dr. J.R. Snow practiced dentistry in the Manor House. <ref> McKethan, ''Hernando County: Our Story'', p. 160. </ref>\n\nMany of Charlotte and J.R.'s descendants live in Hernando County today. Ernest Winfield Snow, grandson of Dr. J.R. Snow raised 18 children born to two wives; Hedick (who died in child birth with her 9th child) and Cora McKeown--all for on Snow Hill. Ernest Snow's family was the last Snow family to inhabit the manor house--leaving the home to a larger estate following a hurricane. Many of Ernest Snow's children went to become prominent business and civic leaders in Hernando County including Eugene Snow, operated one of Brooksville's oldest companies: Snow's Lumber Yard; Juanita Snow Rogers, former owner and operator of Brooksville's Quality Shop; Jim Snow, a great Hernando historian and occupier of \"Mayo Hill\" now Snow Hill; Arthur L. \"Roy\" Snow, served with distinction in World War II as a captain in the 30th Infantry and received commendations which included the Silver Srar, Bronze Star and Purple Heart received for wounds received in action in both World War II and Korean War. Later Roy Snow was named by the governor to the Hernando County Board of County Commissioners and served many years in as a commissioner. Roy Snow's started Snow & Bell, Inc. in Brooksville which is still run by his family today. <ref> Woodcock, ''1840's: Early Beginning'',  </ref>\n\nFive generations of Ederingtons and Snows were born on Mounty Airy/ Snow Hill; six have lived there, starting with Ederington. <ref> Woodcock, ''1840's: Early Beginning'',  </ref>\n\n==The Robins\u2019 Era==\nPossibly the most historically significant period for the Chinsegut Hill manor house occurred during the stewardship of [[Elizabeth Robins|Elizabeth]], [[Raymond Robins|Raymond]] and [[Margaret Dreier Robins|Margaret Robins]]. Elizabeth purchased the home for herself and her youngest brother Raymond.  But following the purchase and before they had moved in, Raymond met and married Margaret Dreier.  Upon their acquisition of the property in 1904, Raymond and Elizabeth renamed the property Chinsegut Hill and set out to improve the grounds. Over the years, Raymond and Margaret added a kitchen to the east wing of the house, a [[widow's walk]] and ventilator, the west chimney, an expanded study, and a music room. The Robins later added four bathrooms (1911), acquired additional land (1917]), added the [[porte-cochere]] (1925), and added a fifth bathroom, electricity, and a well (1933).<ref>Salzman, Neil V.  Reform and Revolution: The Life and Times of Raymond Robins.  Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1991.</ref>\n\nIn addition to their tremendous expansion of the property itself, the Robinses did much to improve the historical significance of the property through their involvement in politics. Raymond served as an advisor for all 7 US Presidents from [[Theodore Roosevelt|Teddy Roosevelt]] to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]].  During the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], Raymond was appointed by President [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] as the Commissioner of the [[American Red Cross]] Mission to [[Russia]] where he met with numerous Russian dignitaries including [[Alexander Kerensky]], [[Leon Trotsky]], and [[Vladimir Lenin]].  Raymond was the only American at this time to meet with Lenin and did so four times a week for five months<ref>Salzman, ''Reform and Revolution'', p. 191-192.</ref>  Margaret Robins, 18 year President of the [[Women's Trade Union League|National Women's Trade Union League]], dined with [[John Calvin Coolidge|President Calvin Coolidge]] in 1923 while her husband was being considered for a cabinet post. In 1928, Raymond was present at the signing of the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact|Pact of Paris]] and was called upon to help plan the presidential campaign of [[Herbert Hoover]].<ref>Salzman, ''Reform and Revolution'', p. 304, 330, 331.</ref>\n\nThe [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] left the Robins in financial ruin because they chose to give almost $250,000 of their money to keep the First National Bank in Brooksville from folding. Using his connections with Herbert Hoover and his administration, Raymond brokered a deal to donate the Chinsegut Hill estate to the government with the stipulation that the couple be allowed to live there until their deaths, free of property taxes.<ref>Salzman, ''Reform and Revolution'', p. 344-345.</ref>\n\nAfter years of illness, Margaret Robins died in 1945. Remaining active in political affairs for several years after his wife's death, Raymond Robins died in 1954.<ref>Salzman, ''Reform and Revolution'', p. 371.</ref>  In the same year the [[University of Florida]] signed a four-year lease for the property, intending to use the site as a branch library utilizing Robins' 8,000 volumes.\n\n===Famous Guests of Chinsegut Hill===\nDuring their occupation of the Chinsegut Hill property, the Robinses entertained countless prominent guests including [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] ambassadors, [[Helen Keller]], [[Jane Addams]], [[William Jennings Bryan]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[James Cash Penney]], [[Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings]], [[Claude Pepper|Senator Claude Pepper]], and [[U.S. Secretary of the Interior]] [[Harold L.

The university signed a 20-year lease in 1962 and has since expended vast amounts of time and money to preserve and restore the property. Alterations to the manor house include the removal of the widow's walk and ventilator due rainwater leakage (1963), construction of several cabins (1972 & 1990's), a dining room (1982), a classroom (1986]), a maintenance shop (1986]), and a storage shed (1990).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn 1982, the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] transferred the title of the Chinsegut Hill property to the University of South Florida once the previous lease had expired and the university had fulfilled its obligations regarding the lease.\n\nOn November 21, 2003, Chinsegut Hill was added to the United States [[National Register of Historic Places]] through a concerted effort by members of the faculty at the University of South Florida.  The University returned the property to the State of Florida in 2008 at which time the non-profit group, The Friends of Chinsegut Hill, Inc. was formed to save the property and the dilapidated Manor.  The Friends oversaw a $1.5 million renovation and has been operating the Manor as a Museum since 2015.  They fund their efforts by using the seven cottages onsite as rentals for retreat groups and individuals.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n==Controversy==\nIn 1959, Chinsegut Hill was embroiled in the [[Red Scare]]. A plaque was commissioned by Lisa von Borowsky, family friend of the Robins and caretaker of the property, and placed on the ground near the Lenin Oak. The plaque honored the wishes of Raymond Robins to commemorate the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution's]] leader, [[Vladimir Lenin]]. In 1961, a group of [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] discovered the plaque and reported the find to the ''[[Tampa Tribune]]''. During the ensuing media firestorm, the University of South Florida claimed to know nothing of the plaque in an attempt to disassociate the university with pro-communist innuendo.<ref>Clendinen, Dudley.  \u201cAn Oak Tree for Lenin,\u201d Floridian Magazine.  June 20, 1971.  p. 21-24.</ref>  Increased outcry from the media and the general public led to an inquiry in front of a grand jury on May 4, 1961. Forty-three years and three days after Margaret Robins planted the oak tree on the property, Borowsky was forced to testify on her activities as well as those of the Robins.<ref>Clendien, \"An Oak Tree For Lenin.\" p. 41.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s, the house had many guests, from visiting researchers to USF faculty and friends.  Sadly, many of the small items in the house were removed by visitors.  More recently, the Chinsegut Hill manor house and the surrounding property has been plagued by the strain of age and deterioration. Many small outbuildings and a water tower have been demolished.  The University of South Florida has done much to maintain the status quo of the property, but has done little to realize any meaningful efforts to restore the manor house to its previous glory.<ref>Hawes, Leland. \"Mansion owned by USF Criticized.\" ''Tampa Tribune'', 17 November 1990.</ref> Much of the university's inaction stems from the history of [[slavery]] at the Chinsegut Hill property.<ref>Correia, Michael Lee. \"African Americans and Chinsegut Hill: Race Relations in Hernando County, Florida, During the Jim Crow Era.\" ''Tampa Bay History'' (Fall/Winter 1992) : 51 - 63.</ref>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120214091500/http://guides.lib.usf.edu/content.php?pid=62125&sid=507925 USF Tampa Library Special Collections Florida Studies Center Chinsegut Hill]\n*[http://www.usf.edu The University of South Florida]\n*[http://www.nps.gov/nr/ U.S. National Register of Historic Places]\n*[http://www.florida-historical-soc.org The Florida Historical Society]\n*[http://www.chinseguthillretreat.com The Chinsegut Hill Retreat, Event Venue]\n*[http://www.chinseguthillmuseum.com The Chinsegut Hill Museum]\n*[http://www.friendsofchinseguthill.org The Friends of Chinsegut Hill]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Further reading===\n*DeWitt, Dan. \"Tour of Chinsegut spurs thoughts of what could be.\" ''Tampa Bay Times''. 1 November 2016.\n*DeWitt, Dan. \"DeWitt: Chinsegut shows signs of fulfilling its promise.\" ''Tampa Bay Times''. 5 May 2016.\n*Neill, Logan \"Archaeologists unearth the history of Hernando's Chinsegut Hill.\" ''Tampa Bay Times''. 11 March 2014.\n*Behrendt, Barbara \"Friends hope to save historic Chinsegut Hill manor house in Hernando.\" ''Tampa Bay Times''. 14 April 2011.\n*DeWitt, Dan. \"Chinsegut opening is just a 'trial run'.\" ''St. Petersburg Times''. 3 June 1993.\n*DeWitt, Dan. \"Parting way - and parting shots.\" ''St. Petersburg Times''. 9 September 2001.\n*DeWitt, Dan. \"Push is on to fix Manor House.\" ''St. Petersburg Times''. 4 April 1990.\n*DeWitt, Dan. \"To the Manor Reborn.\" ''St. Petersburg Times''. 24 January 1991.\n*Huse, Andy. \"Chinsegut Hill: From activist owners to the hands of public universities.\" ''The Oracle''.  15 March 2004.\n*Johnson, Neil. \"Old manor steeped in history.\" ''Tampa Tribune''. 29 November 1999.\n*Smiljanich, Dorothy. \"The spirit of Chinsegut awaits rediscovery.\" ''St. Petersburg Times''.
