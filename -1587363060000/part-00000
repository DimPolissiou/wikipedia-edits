Advances in photographic equipment and techniques developed, and gave photographers the ability to capture images with shorter exposure times and the making of portraits outside the studio.\n\n==Lighting for portraiture==\n{{Main articles|Photographic lighting}}\n[[File:Winter baby 10-months-old.jpg|thumb|Winter portrait of a 10-month-old baby girl]]\n[[File:Imagograms.jpg|thumb|62x200 cm Imagograms, made with the [[Imago camera]] ]]\nWhen portrait photographs are composed and captured in a studio, the photographer has control over the [[lighting]] of the composition of the subject and can adjust direction and intensity of light. There are many ways to light a subject's face, but there are several common lighting plans which are easy enough to describe.\n\n===Three-point lighting===\nOne of the most basic lighting plans is called three-point lighting. This plan uses three (and sometimes four) lights to fully model (bring out details and the three-dimensionality of) the subject's features. The three main lights used in this light plan are as follows:\n\n====Key-light====\nAlso called a main light, the key light is usually placed to one side of the subject's face, between 30 and 60 degrees off center and a bit higher than eye level. The purpose of the key-light is to give shape (modeling) to a subject, typically a face. This relies on the first principle of lighting, white comes out of a plane and black goes back into a plane. The depth of shadow created by the main-Light can be controlled with a fill-light.\n\n====High-key====\nThis is a technique used to obtain a portrait where the predominant color is white or light-yellow. The background should be entirely white and several lights can be used, all at the same time.\n\n====Low-key====\nOpposed to High-Key portraits, this technique is used only to highlight a specific part of the subject's face, often half of the face if only one light source is used or just the facial contour if two lights are used.\n\n====Fill-in light====\nIn modern photography, the fill-in light is used to control the contrast in the scene and is nearly always placed above the lens axis and is a large light source (think of the sky behind your head when taking a photograph). As the amount of light is less than the key-light (main-light), the fill acts by lifting the shadows only (particularly relevant in digital photography where the noise lives in the shadows). It is true to say that light bounces around a room and fills in the shadows but this does not mean that a fill-light should be placed opposite a key-light (main-light) and it does not soften shadows, it lifts them. The relative intensity (ratio) of the Key-light to the fill-light is most easily discussed in terms of \"Stops\" difference (where a Stop is a doubling or halving of the intensity of light). A 2 Stop reduction in intensity for the Fill-Light would be a typical start point to maintain dimensionality (modelling) in a portrait (head and shoulder) shot..\n\n====Back light====\nBack lights, or [[accent lighting]], serve the purpose of accentuating a subject. Typically a back light will separate a subject from a background. Examples would be a light shining onto a subject's hair to add a rim effect or shining onto a background to lift the tones of a background. There can be many accent lights in a shot, another example would be a spotlight on a handbag in a fashion shot. When used for separation, i.e. a hair-light, the light should not be more dominant than the main light for general use. Think in terms of a \"kiss of moonlight\", rather than a \"strike of lightning\", although there are no \"shoulds\" in photography and it is up to the photographer to decide on the authorship of their shot.\n\n====Kicker====\nA kicker is a form of accent light. Often used to give a backlit edge to a subject on the shadow side of the subject.\n[[File:Marlene Dietrich in Shanghai Express (1932) by Don English.png|thumbnail|right|Director [[Josef von Sternberg]] used butterfly lighting to enhance [[Marlene Dietrich]]'s features in this iconic shot,<ref name=\"Heritage\">{{cite web|title=Marlene Dietrich in Shanghai Express by Don English (Paramount, 1932)|url=http://movieposters.ha.com/c/item.zx?saleNo=7043&lotNo=84182|work=Auction Results Archives|publisher=Heritage Capital Corporation|accessdate=5 January 2013|quote=With direction and lighting by genius Josef von Sternberg, photographer Don English took what would become the most iconic image of Marlene Dietrich.}}</ref> from ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]],'' Paramount 1932]]\n\n===Butterfly lighting===\n''Butterfly lighting'' uses only two lights. The key light is placed directly in front of the subject, often above the camera or slightly to one side, and a bit higher than is common for a three-point lighting plan. The second light is a rim light{{Clarify|date=May 2019}}. ('Rim light' is a lighting technique where the image subject is backlit and the image is exposed to hide the subject features in shadow. The technique gets its name from the fact that lighting a subject in this way produces a thin line or 'rim' of light which appears to cling to the subjects outline.)\n\nOften a [[Reflector (photography)|reflector]] is placed below the subject's face to provide fill light and soften shadows.\n\nThis lighting may be recognized by the strong light falling on the forehead, the bridge of the nose, the upper cheeks, and by the distinct shadow below the nose that often looks rather like a butterfly and thus, provides the name for this lighting technique.\n\nButterfly lighting was a favourite of famed [[Hollywood]] portraitist [[George Hurrell]], which is why this style of lighting is often called ''Paramount lighting''.\n\n===Accessory lights===\nThese lights can be added to basic lighting plans to provide additional highlights or add background  definition.\n\n====Background lights====\nNot so much a part of the portrait lighting plan, but rather designed to provide illumination for the background behind the subject, background lights can pick out details in the background, provide a halo effect by illuminating a portion of a backdrop behind the subject's head, or turn the background pure white by filling it with light.\n\n===Other lighting equipment===\nMost lights used in modern photography are a [[flash (photography)|flash]] of some sort. The lighting for portraiture is typically diffused by bouncing it from the inside of an [[umbrella]], or by using a [[soft box]]. A soft box is a fabric box, encasing a photo [[strobe]] head, one side of which is made of translucent fabric. This provides a softer lighting for portrait work and is often considered more appealing than the harsh light often cast by open strobes. Hair and background lights are usually not diffused. It is more important to control light spillage to other areas of the subject. [[Snoot]]s, [[barn door]]s and [[Flag (lighting)|flags]] or [[gobo (lighting)|gobo]]s help focus the lights exactly where the photographer wants them. Background lights are sometimes used with color [[gels]] placed in front of the light to create coloured backgrounds.\n\n==Windowlight portraiture==\n[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico - BEIC 6341416.jpg|thumb|Portrait with window light by Italian photographer [[Paolo Monti]], 1955]]\n\n[[File:Hari bhagirath window light portrait.jpg|upright|thumb|Window light used to create soft light to the portrait]]\n\nWindows as a source of light for portraits have been used for decades before artificial sources of light were discovered. According to Arthur Hammond, amateur and professional photographers need only two things to light a portrait: a window and a reflector.<ref>Hammond, Arthur. \"Pictorial Composition in Photography\"</ref> Although window light limits options in portrait photography compared to artificial lights it gives ample room for experimentation for amateur photographers.  A white reflector placed to reflect light into the darker side of the subject's face, will even the contrast. [[Shutter speed]]s may be slower than normal, requiring the use of a tripod, but the lighting will be beautifully soft and rich.<ref>Keating, Patrick. \"From the Portrait to the Close-Up: Gender and Technology in Still Photography and Hollywood Cinematography\", page 91, Cinema Journal 45, No. 3, Spring 2006, [http://www.trinity.edu/pkeating/Portrait%20to%20the%20Close%20Up.pdf trinity.edu]</ref>\n\nThe best time to take window light portrait is considered to be early hours of the day and late hours of afternoon when light is more intense on the window. Curtains, reflectors, and intensity reducing shields are used to give [[soft light]]. While mirrors and glasses can be used for [[high key]] lighting. At times colored glasses, filters and reflecting objects can be used to give the portrait desired color effects. The composition of shadows and soft light gives window light portraits a distinct effect different from portraits made from artificial lights.\n\nWhile using window light, the positioning of the camera can be changed to give the desired effects. Such as positioning the camera behind the subject can produce a [[silhouette]] of the individual while being adjacent to the subject give a combination of shadows and soft light. And facing the subject from the same point of light source will produce high key effects with least shadows.\n\n==Styles of portraiture==\nThere are many different techniques for portrait photography. Often it is desirable to capture the subject's eyes and face in sharp focus while allowing other less important elements to be rendered in a soft focus. At other times, portraits of individual features might be the focus of a composition such as the hands, eyes or part of the subject's torso.\n\nAdditionally another style such as [[head shot]] has come out of the portraiture technique and has become a style on its own.\n\n==Approaches to portraiture==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Portrait-glamour.jpg|thumb|A '''constructionist romantic portrait''' of a young lady]]\n[[File:Guitar_Luthier_in_Workshop.jpg|thumb|'''Environmental portrait''' of guitar luthier]]\n[[File:DSC 7424 (34067852616).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A portrait of a family]]\nThere are essentially four approaches that can be taken in photographic portraiture\u2014the constructionist, environmental, candid, and creative approach. Each has been used over time for different reasons be they technical, artistic or cultural.\nThe constructionist approach is when the photographer in their portraiture constructs an idea around the portrait\u2014happy family, romantic couple, trustworthy executive. It is the approach used in most studio and social photography. It is also used extensively in advertising and marketing when an idea has to be put across.\nThe environmental approach depicts the subject in their environment be that a work, leisure, social or family one. They are often shown as doing something, a teacher in a classroom, an artist in a studio, a child in a playground. With the environmental approach more is revealed about the subject. Environmental pictures can have good historical and social significance as primary sources of information.\nThe candid approach is where people are photographed without their knowledge going about their daily business. Whilst this approach taken by the paparazzi is criticized and frowned upon for obvious reasons, less invasive and exploitative candid photography has given the world superb and important images of people in various situations and places over the last century. The images of Parisians by [[Doisneau]] and [[Henri Cartier-Bresson|Cartier-Bresson]] demonstrate this approach. As with environmental photography, candid photography is important as a historical source of information about people.\nThe Creative Approach is where digital manipulation (and formerly darkroom manipulation) is brought to bear to produce wonderful pictures of people. It is becoming a major form of portraiture as these techniques become more widely understood and used.\n\n==Lenses==\nLenses used in portrait photography are classically [[lens speed|fast]], medium telephoto lenses, though any lens may be used, depending on artistic purposes. See [[Canon EF Portrait Lenses]] for Canon lenses in this style; other manufacturers feature similar ranges. The first dedicated portrait lens was the [[Petzval lens]] developed in 1840 by [[Joseph Petzval]]. It had a relatively narrow field of view of 30 degrees, a focal length of 150 mm, and a fast [[f-number]] in the \u0192/3.3-3.7 range.\n[[File:Young Woman in Red Dress.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait taken with an 18mm wide-angle lens with an aperture of \u0192/4.5, resulting in fairly large depth of field]]\n[[File:Portrait of a handsome man with bokeh and shallow depth of field.jpg|alt=Portrait of a man with 50 mm lens|thumb|Portrait of a man with [[bokeh]] effect. taken with 50 mm lens with an aperture of \u0192/1.4 , resulting in shallow [[depth of field]]]]\nClassic focal length is in the range 80\u2013135 mm on [[135 film]] format and about 150-400mm on [[large format]], which historically is first in photography. Such a [[field of view]] provides a flattening [[Perspective distortion (photography)|perspective distortion]] when the subject is framed to include their head and shoulders. Wider angle lenses (shorter focal length) require that the portrait be taken from closer (for an equivalent [[field size]]), and the resulting perspective distortion yields a relatively larger nose and smaller ears, which is considered unflattering and [[imp]]-like. Wide-angle lenses&nbsp;\u2013 or even [[fisheye lens]]es&nbsp;\u2013 may be used for artistic effect, especially to produce a grotesque image. Conversely, longer focal lengths yield greater flattening because they are used from further away. This makes communication difficult and reduces rapport.  They may be used, however, particularly in fashion photography, but longer lengths require a loudspeaker or walkie-talkie to communicate with the model or assistants.<ref>Greenspun, [http://photo.net/learn/portraits/?p=2 p. 2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608052835/http://photo.net/learn/portraits/?p=2 |date=2010-06-08 }}</ref> In this range, the difference in perspective distortion between 85mm and 135mm is rather subtle; see {{Harv|Castleman|2007}} for examples and analysis.\n\nSpeed-wise, fast lenses (wide aperture) are preferred, as these allow shallow [[depth of field]] (blurring the background), which helps isolate the subject from the background and focus attention on them. This is particularly useful in the field, where one does not have a back drop behind the subject, and the background may be distracting. The details of [[bokeh]] in the resulting blur are accordingly also a consideration; some lenses, in particular the \"DC\" (Defocus Control) types by Nikon, are designed to give the photographer control over this aspect, by providing an additional ring acting only on the quality of the bokeh, without influencing the foreground (hence, these are not soft-focus lenses). However, extremely wide apertures are less frequently used, because they have a very shallow depth of field and thus the subject's face will not be completely in focus.<ref>[http://photo.net/equipment/canon/85L/ Canon EF 85/1.2L II USM Lens Review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801085904/http://photo.net/equipment/canon/85L/ |date=2010-08-01 }}, by Philip Greenspun</ref>\n\nConversely, in environmental portraits, where the subject is shown ''in'' their environment, rather than isolated from it, background blur is less desirable and may be undesirable, and wider angle lenses may be used to show more context.<ref>Greenspun, [http://photo.net/learn/portraits/?p=3 p. 3]</ref>\n\nFinally, [[soft focus]] ([[spherical aberration]]) is sometimes a desired effect, particularly in [[glamour photography]] where the \"gauzy\" look may be considered flattering. The Canon [[Canon EF 135mm lens#EF 135mm f/2.8 with Softfocus|EF 135mm {{f/}}2.8 with Softfocus]] is an example of a lens designed with a controllable amount of soft focus.\n\nMost often a [[prime lens]] will be used, both because the zoom is not necessary for posed shots (and primes are lighter, cheaper, faster, and higher quality), and because zoom lenses can introduce highly unflattering geometric distortion (barrel distortion or pincushion distortion). However, zoom lenses may be used, particularly in candid shots or to encourage creative framing.<ref>Greenspun, [http://photo.net/learn/portraits/?p=4 p. 4]</ref>\n\nPortrait lenses are often relatively inexpensive, because they can be built simply, and are close to the normal range. The cheapest portrait lenses are [[normal lens]]es (50 mm), used on a cropped sensor. For example, the [[Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II]] is the least expensive Canon lens, but when used on a 1.6\u00d7 cropped sensor yields an 80mm equivalent focal length, which is at the wide end of portrait lenses.\n\n==Mobile portraiture==\nThe documentary [[I Am Chicago]] was an experiment in mobile full-body portraiture, using natural light and a moving truck as a studio.\n\n==Senior portraits==\nIn [[North America]], '''senior portraits''' are formal portraits taken of students near the end of their [[senior (education)|senior year]] of [[high school]], traditionally, to be included in a commemorative yearbook. \n\n===Traditional===\n[[File:R-dunahee-grad.jpg|thumb|right|Senior portrait c. 1920]]\nFormal senior portraits, in and of themselves, date back at least to the 1880s in America.\nSome traditional senior portrait sittings include a [[cap and gown]] and other changes of clothing, portrait styles and poses. In recent decades, the convention has been to feature male students in [[tuxedo]] jackets and female students in a silk or fur drape and a pearl [[necklace]] which is meant to simulate the appearance of a formal gown.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn some schools a portrait studio is invited to the school to ensure all senior portraits (for the yearbook) are similar in pose and style, and so that students who cannot afford to purchase these portraits on their own or choose not to purchase portraits will appear in the yearbook the same as other students. Other schools allow students to choose a studio and submit portraits on their own.\n\n[[File:Sp-david.jpg|left|200px|thumb|A contemporary photo montage type senior portrait, personalized with name of student and year of graduation.]]\n\n===Modern===\nModern senior portraits may include virtually any pose or clothing choice, within the limits of good taste. Students often appear with pets, student athletes of both sexes pose in [[Letterman (sports)|letterman]] jackets or their playing uniforms, while many men choose [[glamour photography]]. Outdoor \"location\" photos continue to increase in popularity, as well as locations that are of specific importance to the senior, both replacing studio portraits. Picture proofs are usually available to view online the next day which are lower quality, unedited and often with a [[watermark]] of the studio.\n\n===Uses of senior portraits===\nSenior portraits are often included in graduation announcements or are given to friends and family. They are also used in [[yearbooks]] and are usually rendered larger than their underclassmen counterparts and are often featured in color, even if the rest of the yearbook is mostly reproduced in black and white. In some schools the requirements are strict regarding the choice of photographer or in the style of portraiture, with only traditional-style portraits being acceptable. Many schools choose to contract one photographer for their yearbook portraits, while other schools allow many different photographers to submit yearbook portraits.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Photography}}\n* [[Catchlight]]\n* [[Mug shot]]\n* [[:Category:Portrait photographers|Portrait photographers]]\n* [[Selfie]]\n* [[Street portrait]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{commons category-inline}}\n[https://paintingflip.com/ Portraits online Shopping]\n{{photography subject}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Portrait photography| ]]\n[[Category:Photography by genre]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=December 2007}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| background color=#D8D2B2\n| header = Natural light portraiture\n| image1 = ECurtis.jpg\n| caption1 = [[Edward S.

Advances in photographic equipment and techniques developed, and gave photographers the ability to capture images with shorter exposure times and the making of portraits outside the studio.\n\n==Lighting for portraiture==\n{{Main articles|Photographic lighting}}\n[[File:Winter baby 10-months-old.jpg|thumb|Winter portrait of a 10-month-old baby girl]]\n[[File:Imagograms.jpg|thumb|62x200 cm Imagograms, made with the [[Imago camera]] ]]\nWhen portrait photographs are composed and captured in a studio, the photographer has control over the [[lighting]] of the composition of the subject and can adjust direction and intensity of light. There are many ways to light a subject's face, but there are several common lighting plans which are easy enough to describe.\n\n===Three-point lighting===\nOne of the most basic lighting plans is called three-point lighting. This plan uses three (and sometimes four) lights to fully model (bring out details and the three-dimensionality of) the subject's features. The three main lights used in this light plan are as follows:\n\n====Key-light====\nAlso called a main light, the key light is usually placed to one side of the subject's face, between 30 and 60 degrees off center and a bit higher than eye level. The purpose of the key-light is to give shape (modeling) to a subject, typically a face. This relies on the first principle of lighting, white comes out of a plane and black goes back into a plane. The depth of shadow created by the main-Light can be controlled with a fill-light.\n\n====High-key====\nThis is a technique used to obtain a portrait where the predominant color is white or light-yellow. The background should be entirely white and several lights can be used, all at the same time.\n\n====Low-key====\nOpposed to High-Key portraits, this technique is used only to highlight a specific part of the subject's face, often half of the face if only one light source is used or just the facial contour if two lights are used.\n\n====Fill-in light====\nIn modern photography, the fill-in light is used to control the contrast in the scene and is nearly always placed above the lens axis and is a large light source (think of the sky behind your head when taking a photograph). As the amount of light is less than the key-light (main-light), the fill acts by lifting the shadows only (particularly relevant in digital photography where the noise lives in the shadows). It is true to say that light bounces around a room and fills in the shadows but this does not mean that a fill-light should be placed opposite a key-light (main-light) and it does not soften shadows, it lifts them. The relative intensity (ratio) of the Key-light to the fill-light is most easily discussed in terms of \"Stops\" difference (where a Stop is a doubling or halving of the intensity of light). A 2 Stop reduction in intensity for the Fill-Light would be a typical start point to maintain dimensionality (modelling) in a portrait (head and shoulder) shot..\n\n====Back light====\nBack lights, or [[accent lighting]], serve the purpose of accentuating a subject. Typically a back light will separate a subject from a background. Examples would be a light shining onto a subject's hair to add a rim effect or shining onto a background to lift the tones of a background. There can be many accent lights in a shot, another example would be a spotlight on a handbag in a fashion shot. When used for separation, i.e. a hair-light, the light should not be more dominant than the main light for general use. Think in terms of a \"kiss of moonlight\", rather than a \"strike of lightning\", although there are no \"shoulds\" in photography and it is up to the photographer to decide on the authorship of their shot.\n\n====Kicker====\nA kicker is a form of accent light. Often used to give a backlit edge to a subject on the shadow side of the subject.\n[[File:Marlene Dietrich in Shanghai Express (1932) by Don English.png|thumbnail|right|Director [[Josef von Sternberg]] used butterfly lighting to enhance [[Marlene Dietrich]]'s features in this iconic shot,<ref name=\"Heritage\">{{cite web|title=Marlene Dietrich in Shanghai Express by Don English (Paramount, 1932)|url=http://movieposters.ha.com/c/item.zx?saleNo=7043&lotNo=84182|work=Auction Results Archives|publisher=Heritage Capital Corporation|accessdate=5 January 2013|quote=With direction and lighting by genius Josef von Sternberg, photographer Don English took what would become the most iconic image of Marlene Dietrich.}}</ref> from ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]],'' Paramount 1932]]\n\n===Butterfly lighting===\n''Butterfly lighting'' uses only two lights. The key light is placed directly in front of the subject, often above the camera or slightly to one side, and a bit higher than is common for a three-point lighting plan. The second light is a rim light{{Clarify|date=May 2019}}. ('Rim light' is a lighting technique where the image subject is backlit and the image is exposed to hide the subject features in shadow. The technique gets its name from the fact that lighting a subject in this way produces a thin line or 'rim' of light which appears to cling to the subjects outline.)\n\nOften a [[Reflector (photography)|reflector]] is placed below the subject's face to provide fill light and soften shadows.\n\nThis lighting may be recognized by the strong light falling on the forehead, the bridge of the nose, the upper cheeks, and by the distinct shadow below the nose that often looks rather like a butterfly and thus, provides the name for this lighting technique.\n\nButterfly lighting was a favourite of famed [[Hollywood]] portraitist [[George Hurrell]], which is why this style of lighting is often called ''Paramount lighting''.\n\n===Accessory lights===\nThese lights can be added to basic lighting plans to provide additional highlights or add background  definition.\n\n====Background lights====\nNot so much a part of the portrait lighting plan, but rather designed to provide illumination for the background behind the subject, background lights can pick out details in the background, provide a halo effect by illuminating a portion of a backdrop behind the subject's head, or turn the background pure white by filling it with light.\n\n===Other lighting equipment===\nMost lights used in modern photography are a [[flash (photography)|flash]] of some sort. The lighting for portraiture is typically diffused by bouncing it from the inside of an [[umbrella]], or by using a [[soft box]]. A soft box is a fabric box, encasing a photo [[strobe]] head, one side of which is made of translucent fabric. This provides a softer lighting for portrait work and is often considered more appealing than the harsh light often cast by open strobes. Hair and background lights are usually not diffused. It is more important to control light spillage to other areas of the subject. [[Snoot]]s, [[barn door]]s and [[Flag (lighting)|flags]] or [[gobo (lighting)|gobo]]s help focus the lights exactly where the photographer wants them. Background lights are sometimes used with color [[gels]] placed in front of the light to create coloured backgrounds.\n\n==Windowlight portraiture==\n[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico - BEIC 6341416.jpg|thumb|Portrait with window light by Italian photographer [[Paolo Monti]], 1955]]\n\n[[File:Hari bhagirath window light portrait.jpg|upright|thumb|Window light used to create soft light to the portrait]]\n\nWindows as a source of light for portraits have been used for decades before artificial sources of light were discovered. According to Arthur Hammond, amateur and professional photographers need only two things to light a portrait: a window and a reflector.<ref>Hammond, Arthur. \"Pictorial Composition in Photography\"</ref> Although window light limits options in portrait photography compared to artificial lights it gives ample room for experimentation for amateur photographers.

Curtains, reflectors, and intensity reducing shields are used to give [[soft light]]. While mirrors and glasses can be used for [[high key]] lighting. At times colored glasses, filters and reflecting objects can be used to give the portrait desired color effects.

For example, the [[Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II]] is the least expensive Canon lens, but when used on a 1.6\u00d7 cropped sensor yields an 80mm equivalent focal length, which is at the wide end of portrait lenses.\n\n==Mobile portraiture==\nThe documentary [[I Am Chicago]] was an experiment in mobile full-body portraiture, using natural light and a moving truck as a studio.\n\n==Senior portraits==\nIn [[North America]], '''senior portraits''' are formal portraits taken of students near the end of their [[senior (education)|senior year]] of [[high school]], traditionally, to be included in a commemorative yearbook. \n\n===Traditional===\n[[File:R-dunahee-grad.jpg|thumb|right|Senior portrait c. 1920]]\nFormal senior portraits, in and of themselves, date back at least to the 1880s in America.\nSome traditional senior portrait sittings include a [[cap and gown]] and other changes of clothing, portrait styles and poses. In recent decades, the convention has been to feature male students in [[tuxedo]] jackets and female students in a silk or fur drape and a pearl [[necklace]] which is meant to simulate the appearance of a formal gown.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn some schools a portrait studio is invited to the school to ensure all senior portraits (for the yearbook) are similar in pose and style, and so that students who cannot afford to purchase these portraits on their own or choose not to purchase portraits will appear in the yearbook the same as other students. Other schools allow students to choose a studio and submit portraits on their own.\n\n[[File:Sp-david.jpg|left|200px|thumb|A contemporary photo montage type senior portrait, personalized with name of student and year of graduation.]]\n\n===Modern===\nModern senior portraits may include virtually any pose or clothing choice, within the limits of good taste. Students often appear with pets, student athletes of both sexes pose in [[Letterman (sports)|letterman]] jackets or their playing uniforms, while many men choose [[glamour photography]]. Outdoor \"location\" photos continue to increase in popularity, as well as locations that are of specific importance to the senior, both replacing studio portraits. Picture proofs are usually available to view online the next day which are lower quality, unedited and often with a [[watermark]] of the studio.\n\n===Uses of senior portraits===\nSenior portraits are often included in graduation announcements or are given to friends and family. They are also used in [[yearbooks]] and are usually rendered larger than their underclassmen counterparts and are often featured in color, even if the rest of the yearbook is mostly reproduced in black and white. In some schools the requirements are strict regarding the choice of photographer or in the style of portraiture, with only traditional-style portraits being acceptable. Many schools choose to contract one photographer for their yearbook portraits, while other schools allow many different photographers to submit yearbook portraits.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Photography}}\n* [[Catchlight]]\n* [[Mug shot]]\n* [[:Category:Portrait photographers|Portrait photographers]]\n* [[Selfie]]\n* [[Street portrait]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{commons category-inline}}\n\n{{photography subject}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Portrait photography| ]]\n[[Category:Photography by genre]]\n", "name_user": "Tannu12", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eExternal links)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_photography"}
{"title_page": "Performativity", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=December 2011}}\n'''Performativity''' is a concept that can be thought of as a [[language]] which functions as a form of social action and has the effect of change.<ref name=Cavanaugh>{{cite journal|last1=Cavanaugh|first1=Jillian R.|title=Performativity|journal=Anthropology|date=10 March 2015|doi=10.1093/OBO/9780199766567-0114|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0114.xml|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref> The concept has multiple applications in diverse fields such as [[anthropology]], [[Social geography|social]] and [[cultural geography]], [[economics]], [[gender studies]] ([[social construction of gender]]), [[jurisprudence|law]],  [[linguistics]],  [[performance studies]], [[history]], and [[philosophy]].\n\nThe concept is first described by [[philosopher of language]] [[J. L. Austin|John L. Austin]] when he referred to a specific capacity: the capacity of speech and communication to act or to consummate an action. Austin differentiated this from constative language, which he defined as descriptive language that can be \"evaluated as true or false\". Common examples of performative language are making promises, betting, performing a wedding ceremony, an umpire calling a strike, or a judge pronouncing a verdict.<ref name=Cavanaugh/>\n\nInfluenced by Austin, philosopher and gender theorist [[Judith Butler]] argued that [[social construction of gender|gender is socially constructed]] through commonplace [[speech act]]s and [[nonverbal communication]] that are performative, in that they serve to define and maintain [[social identity|identities]].<ref name=\"Butler1990\">{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Gender Trouble|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}</ref> This view of performativity reverses the idea that a person's identity is the source of their secondary actions (speech, gestures). Instead, it views actions, behaviors, and gestures as both the result of an individual's identity as well as a source that contributes to the formation of one's identity which is continuously being redefined through speech acts and symbolic communication.<ref name=Cavanaugh/> This view was also influenced by philosophers such as [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Louis Althusser]].<ref>Cultural Studies and Discourse Analysis \u2013 Barker & Galasinski</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===J. L. Austin===\n\nThe term derives from the founding work in [[speech act]] theory by ordinary language philosopher [[J. L. Austin]]. In the 1950s, Austin gave the name [[performative utterances]] to situations where saying something was doing something, rather than simply reporting on or describing reality. The paradigmatic case here is speaking the words \"I do\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Austin|first=J L|title=How To Do Things With Words|url=https://archive.org/details/howtodothingswit0000aust|url-access=registration|year=1962|page=[https://archive.org/details/howtodothingswit0000aust/page/5 5]}}</ref> Austin did not use the word ''performativity''.\n\nBreaking with [[analytic philosophy]], Austin argued in ''[[How to Do Things With Words]]'' that a \"performative utterance\" cannot be said to be either true or false as a constative utterance might be: it can only be judged either \"happy\" or \"infelicitous\" depending upon whether the conditions required for its success have been met. In this sense, performativity is a function of the [[pragmatics]] of language. Having shown that ''all'' utterances perform actions, even apparently constative ones, Austin famously discarded the distinction between \"performative\" and \"constative\" utterances halfway through the lecture series that became the book and replaced it with a three-level framework:\n\n* ''locution'' (the actual words spoken, that which the linguists and linguistic philosophers of the day were mostly interested in analyzing) \n* ''illocutionary force'' (what the speaker is attempting to do ''in'' uttering the locution) \n* ''perlocutionary effect'' (the actual effect the speaker actually has on the interlocutor ''by'' uttering the locution)\n\nFor example, if a speech act is an attempt to distract someone, the illocutionary force is the attempt to distract and the perlocutionary effect is the actual distraction caused by the speech act in the interlocutor.\n\n==== Influence of Austin ====\nAustin's account of performativity has been subject to extensive discussion in philosophy, literature, and beyond. [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Shoshana Felman]], [[Judith Butler]], and [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] are among the scholars who have elaborated upon and contested aspects of Austin's account from the vantage point of [[deconstruction]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[feminism]], and [[queer theory]]. Particularly in the work of feminists and queer theorists, performativity has played an important role in discussions of [[social change]] (Oliver 2003).\n\nThe concept of performativity has also been used in [[science and technology studies]] and in [[economic sociology]]. [[Andrew Pickering]] has proposed to shift from a \"representational idiom\" to a \"performative idiom\" in the study of science. [[Michel Callon]] has proposed to study the performative aspects of [[economics]], i.e. the extent to which economic science plays an important role not only in describing markets and economies, but also in framing them. Karen Barad has argued that science and technology studies deemphasize the performativity of language in order to explore the performativity of matter (Barad 2003).\n\nOther uses of the notion of performativity in the social sciences include the daily behavior (or performance) of individuals based on social norms or habits. Philosopher and feminist theorist [[Judith Butler]] has used the concept of performativity in her analysis of [[gender]] development, as well as in her analysis of political speech. [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] describes [[Queer theory|queer]] performativity as an ongoing project for transforming the way we may define\u2014and break\u2014boundaries to identity. Through her suggestion that shame is a potentially performative and transformational emotion, Sedgwick has also linked queer performativity to [[affect theory]]. Also innovative in Sedgwick's discussion of the performative is what she calls ''periperformativity'' (2003: 67\u201391), which is effectively the group contribution to the success or failure of a speech act.\n\n== Judith Butler ==\n{{Main|Gender performativity}}\n\nPhilosopher and [[feminist]] theorist [[Judith Butler]] offered a new, more [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] (specifically, [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]]) reading of the notion of performativity, which has its roots in [[linguistics]] and [[philosophy of language]]. She describes performativity as \"that reiterative power of discourse to produce the phenomena that it regulates and constrains.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bodies that Matter:  On the Discursive Limits of \"Sex\"|last=Butler|first=Judith|publisher=Routledge|year=1993|isbn=9780415903660|location=New York|pages=xii|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bodiesthatmatter00butl}}</ref> She has largely used this concept in her analysis of [[gender]] development.<ref>This idea was first introduced in 1988 in an issue of ''[[Theatre Journal]]'' (Brickell, 2005).</ref>\n\nThe concept places emphasis on the manners by which identity is passed or brought to life through discourse.  Performative acts are types of authoritative speech. This can only happen and be enforced through the law or norms of the society. These statements, just by speaking them, carry out a certain action and exhibit a certain level of power. Examples of these types of statements are declarations of ownership, baptisms, inaugurations, and legal sentences. Something that is key to performativity is repetition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/HalberstamQueerTheory-AnkaraTurkey|title=An audio overview of queer theory in English and Turkish by Jack Halberstam|last=Halberstam|first=Jack|date=2014-05-16|accessdate=29 May 2014}}</ref> The statements are not singular in nature or use and must be used consistently in order to exert power (Hall 2000).\n\n==== Performance theory and gender perspectives ====\n\nButler explains gender as an act. An act that people come to perform in the '''mode''' of '''belief''' which has been rehearsed much like a script. It is further asserted that people make a reality through repetition (just as actors who make a script). Butler sees gender not as an expression of what one is, rather as something that one does.  Furthermore, she sees it not as a social imposition on a gender neutral body, but rather as a mode of \"self-making\" through which subjects become socially intelligible.  According to Butler's theory, homosexuality and heterosexuality are not fixed categories.  For Butler, a person is merely in a condition of \"doing straightness\" or \"doing queerness\" (Lloyd, 1999).\n\n\"For Butler, the distinction between the personal and the political or between private and public is itself a fiction designed to support an oppressive status quo: our most personal acts are, in fact, continually being scripted by [[hegemonic]] [[social conventions]] and [[ideologies]]\" (Felluga, 2006).\n\n==== Theoretical criticisms ====\n\nThere are several criticisms that have been raised against Butler's concept of performativity.  The first is that the theory is individual in nature and does not take other factors into consideration.  These factors include the space within which the performance occurs, the others involved and how they might see or interpret what they witness.  Also, the unplanned effects of the performance act are overlooked and the contingencies are not taken into consideration (Lloyd, 1999).\n\nAnother criticism is that Butler is not clear about the concept of subject.  It has been said that in her writings, sometimes the subject only exists tentatively, sometimes they possess a \"real\" existence and other times are socially active.  Also, some observe that the theory might be better suited to literary analysis as opposed to social theory. (Brickell, 2005)\n\nOthers criticize Butler for taking [[Ethnomethodology|ethnomethodological]] and [[Symbolic interactionism|symbolic interactionist]] sociological analyses of gender and merely reinventing them in the concept of performativity (Dunn 1997; Green 2007).  For example, Green (2007) argues that the work of [[Sue Kessler|Kessler]] and [[Wendy McKenna|McKenna]] (1978) and West and Zimmerman (1987) builds directly from [[Harold Garfinkel|Garfinkel]] (1967) and [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] (1959) to deconstruct gender into moments of attribution and iteration in a continual social process of \"doing\" [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]] in the [[performative interval]].  These latter works are premised on the notion that gender does not precede but, rather, follows from practice, instantiated in micro-interaction. Butler downgrades gender's constructed nature to fight for oppressed identities.\n\n== Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard ==\nIn ''[[The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge]]'' (1979, English translation 1986), philosopher and cultural theorist [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]] defined performativity as the defining mode of [[legitimation]] of postmodern knowledge and social bonds, that is, power.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge.|last=Lyotard|first=Jean-Francois|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1986|isbn=978-0816611737|location=Minneapolis|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/postmoderncondit00lyot}}</ref> In contrast to the legitimation of modern knowledge through such grand narratives as Progress, Revolution, and Liberation, performativity operates by system optimization or the calculation of input and outputs. In a footnote, Lyotard aligns performativity with Austin's concept of performative speech act. Postmodern knowledge must not only report: it must do something and do it efficiently by maximizing input/output ratios.\n\nLyotard uses [[Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics|Wittgenstein's]] notion of language games to theorize how performativity governs the articulation, funding, and conduct of contemporary research and education, arguing that at bottom it involves the threat of terror: \"be operational (that is commensurable) or disappear\" (xxiv). While Lyotard is highly critical of performativity, he notes that it calls on researchers to explain not only the worth of their work but also the worth of that worth.\n\nLyotard associated performativity with the rise of digital computers in the post-World War II period. In ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945,'' historian [[Tony Judt]] cites Lyotard to argue that the Left has largely abandoned revolutionary politics for human rights advocacy. The widespread adoption of performance reviews, organizational assessments, and learning outcomes by different social institutions worldwide has led social researchers to theorize \"audit culture\" and \"global performativity\".\n\nAgainst performativity and [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]]' call for consensus, Lyotard argued for legitimation by ''paralogy'', or the destabilizing, often paradoxical, introduction of difference into language games.\n\n== Jacques Derrida ==\nPhilosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] drew on Austin's theory of performative speech act while deconstructing its logocentric and phonocentric premises and reinscribing it within the operations of generalized writing. In contrast to structuralism's focus on linguistic form, Austin had introduced the ''force'' of speech acts, which Derrida aligns with [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] insights on language.\n\nIn \"Signature, Event, Context,\" Derrida focused on Austin's privileging of speech and the accompanying presumptions of the presence of a speaker (\"signature\") and the bounding of a performative's force by an act or a context. In a passage that would become a touchstone of poststructuralist thought, Derrida stresses the citationality or iterability of any and all signs.<blockquote>Every sign, linguistic or nonlinguistic, spoken or written (in the current sense of this opposition), in a small or large unit, can be ''cited'', put between quotation marks; in doing so it can break with every given context, engendering an infinity of new contexts in a manner which is absolutely illimitable. This does not imply that the mark is valid outside of a context, but on the contrary that there are only contexts without any center or absolute anchorage [''ancrage'']. This citationality, this duplication or duplicity, this iterability of the mark is neither an accident nor an anomaly, it is that (normal/abnormal) without which a mark could not even have a function called \"normal.\" What would a mark be that could not be cited? Or one whose origins would not get lost along the way?<ref>{{Cite book|title=Limited, Inc.|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|publisher=Northwestern University Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0810107885|location=Evanston|pages=12}}</ref></blockquote>Derrida's stress on the citational dimension of performativity would be taken up by Judith Butler and other theorists. While he addressed the performativity of individual subject formation, Derrida also raised such questions as whether we can mark when the event of the Russian revolution went awry, thus scaling up the field of performativity to historical dimensions.\n\n==John Searle's reformulation==\nIn ''[[A Taxonomy of Illocutionary Acts]]'', [[John Searle]] takes up and reformulates the ideas of his colleague [[J. L. Austin]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|last=Searle|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1979|authorlink=John Searle}}</ref> Though Searle largely supports and agrees with Austin's theory of speech acts, he has a number of critiques, which he outlines: \"In sum, there are (at least) six related difficulties with Austin's taxonomy; in ascending order of importance: there is a persistent confusion between verbs and acts, not all the verbs are illocutionary verbs, there is too much overlap of the categories, too much heterogeneity within the categories, many of the verbs listed in the categories don't satisfy the definition given for the category and, most important, there is no consistent principle of classification.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|last=Searle|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1979|pages=12|authorlink=John Searle}}</ref>\n\nHis last key departure from Austin lies in Searle's claim that four of his universal 'acts' do not need 'extra-linguistic' contexts to succeed.<ref name=\"John1979\">{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|last=Searle|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1979|pages=7|authorlink=John Searle}}</ref> As opposed to Austin who thinks all illocutionary acts need extra-linguistic institutions, Searle disregards the necessity of context and replaces it with the \"rules of language\".<ref name=\"John1979\" />\n\n== Various applications ==\n=== Finance and economics ===\nIn economics, the \"performativity thesis\" is the claim that the assumptions and models used by professionals and popularizers affect the phenomena they purport to describe; bringing the world more into line with theory.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://kieranhealy.org/files/drafts/performativity.pdf|title = The Performativity of Networks|last = Healy|first = Kieran|date = 2015|journal = European Journal of Sociology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-11-19}}</ref><ref name=\"doing\">{{cite book|title=Doing Economics|date=2010|publisher=The Open University|location=Milton Keynes|isbn=978 1 8487 34692|page=493}}</ref> This theory was developed by Michel Callon in ''The Laws of the Markets'', before being further developed in ''Do Economists Make Markets'' edited by [[Donald Angus MacKenzie]], Fabian Muniesa and Lucia Siu, and in ''Enacting Dismal Science'' edited by Ivan Boldyrev and Ekaterina Svetlova.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8442.html | title=Do Economists Make Markets?}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=http://www.palgrave.com/de/book/9781137492104# | title=Enacting Dismal Science - New Perspectives on the Performativity of Economics &#124; Ivan Boldyrev &#124; Palgrave Macmillan}}</ref> The most important work in the field is that of [[Donald Angus MacKenzie|Donald MacKenzie]] and Yuval Millo<ref>{{Cite journal|last=MacKenzie|first=Donald|last2=Millo|first2=Yuval|date=2003|title=Constructing a Market, Performing Theory: The Historical Sociology of a Financial Derivatives Exchange|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/374404|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=109|issue=1|pages=107\u2013145|doi=10.1086/374404|issn=0002-9602}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mackenzie|first=Donald|date=2006/03|title=Is Economics Performative?

Drawing on the work of [[J. L. Austin|John Austin]] and [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], Brisset theorizes the idea of limits to performativity.To do this, Brisset considers that a theory, in order to be \"performative\", must become a convection. This requires conditions to be met. To take a convention status, a theory will have to:\n\n* Provide social actors with a representation of their social world allowing them to choose among several actions (\"Empiricity\" condition);\n* Indicate an option considered relevant when the agreement is generalised (\"Self-fulfilling\" condition);\n* Be compatible with all the conventions constituting the social environment (\"Coherency\" condition);<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brisset|first=Nicolas|date=2016-04-02|title=Economics is not always performative: some limits for performativity|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1350178X.2016.1172805|journal=Journal of Economic Methodology|volume=23|issue=2|pages=160\u2013184|doi=10.1080/1350178X.2016.1172805|issn=1350-178X}}</ref>\n\nBased on this framework, Brisset criticized the seminal work of MacKenzie and Millo on the performativity of the Black-Scholes-Merton financial model.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brisset|first=Nicolas|date=December 2017|title=ON PERFORMATIVITY: OPTION THEORY AND THE RESISTANCE OF FINANCIAL PHENOMENA|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-history-of-economic-thought/article/on-performativity-option-theory-and-the-resistance-of-financial-phenomena/5EA4680D1294F9D4593FCAB4FBAB1421#fndtn-metrics|journal=Journal of the History of Economic Thought|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=549\u2013569|doi=10.1017/S1053837217000128|issn=1053-8372}}</ref> \n\nMacKenzie's approach was also criticized by Uskali Maki for not using the concept of performativity in accordance with Austin's formulation<ref>{{Citation|last=M\u00e4ki|first=Uskali|title=Performativity: Saving Austin From Mackenzie|date=2013|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/MKIPSA|work=EPSA11 Perspectives and Foundational Problems in Philosophy of Science|pages=443\u2013453|editor-last=Karakostas|editor-first=Vassilios|publisher=Springer|access-date=2020-04-14|editor2-last=Dieks|editor2-first=Dennis}}</ref>.

In the evening of November 9, 1989, the evening of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], however, Friedrichs reportedly broke his own rule when he announced: \"The gates of the wall are wide open.\" (\u201eDie Tore in der Mauer stehen weit offen.\u201d) In reality, the gates were still closed. According to a historian, it was this announcement that encouraged thousands of East Berliners to march towards the wall, finally forcing the border guards to open the gates. In the sense of performativity, Friedrichs's words became a reality.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/tv/mauerfall/der-schoenste-fehler-in-40-jahren-tagesthemen-54357108.bild.html | title=Zum Jubil\u00e4um - der sch\u00f6nste Fehler in 40 Jahren \"Tagesthemen\"}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/30/AR2009103001846.html | title=Mary Elise Sarotte -- How an accident caused the Berlin Wall to come down| date=November 2009| last1=Sarotte| first1=Mary Elise}}</ref>\n\n===Video art===\n\nTheories of performativity have extended across multiple disciplines and discussions. Notably, interdisciplinary theorist [[Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz]] has related video to theories of performativity. Specifically, Mu\u00f1oz looks at the 1996 documentary by Susana Aiken and Carlos Aparicio, \"The Transformation.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics|author=Mu\u00f1oz|authorlink=Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz}}</ref>\n\nAlthough historically and theoretically related to performance art, [[video art]] is not an immediate performance; it is mediated, iterative and citational. In this way, video art raises questions of performativity. Additionally, video art frequently puts bodies and display, complicating borders, surfaces, embodiment, and boundaries and so indexing performativity.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*Austin, J.

L. Austin|John L. Austin]] when he referred to a specific capacity: the capacity of speech and communication to act or to consummate an action. Austin differentiated this from constative language, which he defined as descriptive language that can be \"evaluated as true or false\". Common examples of performative language are making promises, betting, performing a wedding ceremony, an umpire calling a strike, or a judge pronouncing a verdict.<ref name=Cavanaugh/>\n\nInfluenced by Austin, philosopher and gender theorist [[Judith Butler]] argued that [[social construction of gender|gender is socially constructed]] through commonplace [[speech act]]s and [[nonverbal communication]] that are performative, in that they serve to define and maintain [[social identity|identities]].<ref name=\"Butler1990\">{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Gender Trouble|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}</ref> This view of performativity reverses the idea that a person's identity is the source of their secondary actions (speech, gestures). Instead, it views actions, behaviors, and gestures as both the result of an individual's identity as well as a source that contributes to the formation of one's identity which is continuously being redefined through speech acts and symbolic communication.<ref name=Cavanaugh/> This view was also influenced by philosophers such as [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Louis Althusser]].<ref>Cultural Studies and Discourse Analysis \u2013 Barker & Galasinski</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===J. L. Austin===\n\nThe term derives from the founding work in [[speech act]] theory by ordinary language philosopher [[J. L. Austin]]. In the 1950s, Austin gave the name [[performative utterances]] to situations where saying something was doing something, rather than simply reporting on or describing reality. The paradigmatic case here is speaking the words \"I do\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Austin|first=J L|title=How To Do Things With Words|url=https://archive.org/details/howtodothingswit0000aust|url-access=registration|year=1962|page=[https://archive.org/details/howtodothingswit0000aust/page/5 5]}}</ref> Austin did not use the word ''performativity''.\n\nBreaking with [[analytic philosophy]], Austin argued in ''[[How to Do Things With Words]]'' that a \"performative utterance\" cannot be said to be either true or false as a constative utterance might be: it can only be judged either \"happy\" or \"infelicitous\" depending upon whether the conditions required for its success have been met. In this sense, performativity is a function of the [[pragmatics]] of language. Having shown that ''all'' utterances perform actions, even apparently constative ones, Austin famously discarded the distinction between \"performative\" and \"constative\" utterances halfway through the lecture series that became the book and replaced it with a three-level framework:\n\n* ''locution'' (the actual words spoken, that which the linguists and linguistic philosophers of the day were mostly interested in analyzing) \n* ''illocutionary force'' (what the speaker is attempting to do ''in'' uttering the locution) \n* ''perlocutionary effect'' (the actual effect the speaker actually has on the interlocutor ''by'' uttering the locution)\n\nFor example, if a speech act is an attempt to distract someone, the illocutionary force is the attempt to distract and the perlocutionary effect is the actual distraction caused by the speech act in the interlocutor.\n\n==== Influence of Austin ====\nAustin's account of performativity has been subject to extensive discussion in philosophy, literature, and beyond. [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Shoshana Felman]], [[Judith Butler]], and [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] are among the scholars who have elaborated upon and contested aspects of Austin's account from the vantage point of [[deconstruction]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[feminism]], and [[queer theory]]. Particularly in the work of feminists and queer theorists, performativity has played an important role in discussions of [[social change]] (Oliver 2003).\n\nThe concept of performativity has also been used in [[science and technology studies]] and in [[economic sociology]]. [[Andrew Pickering]] has proposed to shift from a \"representational idiom\" to a \"performative idiom\" in the study of science. [[Michel Callon]] has proposed to study the performative aspects of [[economics]], i.e. the extent to which economic science plays an important role not only in describing markets and economies, but also in framing them. Karen Barad has argued that science and technology studies deemphasize the performativity of language in order to explore the performativity of matter (Barad 2003).\n\nOther uses of the notion of performativity in the social sciences include the daily behavior (or performance) of individuals based on social norms or habits. Philosopher and feminist theorist [[Judith Butler]] has used the concept of performativity in her analysis of [[gender]] development, as well as in her analysis of political speech. [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] describes [[Queer theory|queer]] performativity as an ongoing project for transforming the way we may define\u2014and break\u2014boundaries to identity. Through her suggestion that shame is a potentially performative and transformational emotion, Sedgwick has also linked queer performativity to [[affect theory]]. Also innovative in Sedgwick's discussion of the performative is what she calls ''periperformativity'' (2003: 67\u201391), which is effectively the group contribution to the success or failure of a speech act.\n\n== Judith Butler ==\n{{Main|Gender performativity}}\n\nPhilosopher and [[feminist]] theorist [[Judith Butler]] offered a new, more [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] (specifically, [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]]) reading of the notion of performativity, which has its roots in [[linguistics]] and [[philosophy of language]]. She describes performativity as \"that reiterative power of discourse to produce the phenomena that it regulates and constrains.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bodies that Matter:  On the Discursive Limits of \"Sex\"|last=Butler|first=Judith|publisher=Routledge|year=1993|isbn=9780415903660|location=New York|pages=xii|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bodiesthatmatter00butl}}</ref> She has largely used this concept in her analysis of [[gender]] development.<ref>This idea was first introduced in 1988 in an issue of ''[[Theatre Journal]]'' (Brickell, 2005).</ref>\n\nThe concept places emphasis on the manners by which identity is passed or brought to life through discourse.  Performative acts are types of authoritative speech. This can only happen and be enforced through the law or norms of the society. These statements, just by speaking them, carry out a certain action and exhibit a certain level of power. Examples of these types of statements are declarations of ownership, baptisms, inaugurations, and legal sentences. Something that is key to performativity is repetition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/HalberstamQueerTheory-AnkaraTurkey|title=An audio overview of queer theory in English and Turkish by Jack Halberstam|last=Halberstam|first=Jack|date=2014-05-16|accessdate=29 May 2014}}</ref> The statements are not singular in nature or use and must be used consistently in order to exert power (Hall 2000).\n\n==== Performance theory and gender perspectives ====\n\nButler explains gender as an act. An act that people come to perform in the '''mode''' of '''belief''' which has been rehearsed much like a script. It is further asserted that people make a reality through repetition (just as actors who make a script). Butler sees gender not as an expression of what one is, rather as something that one does.  Furthermore, she sees it not as a social imposition on a gender neutral body, but rather as a mode of \"self-making\" through which subjects become socially intelligible.  According to Butler's theory, homosexuality and heterosexuality are not fixed categories.  For Butler, a person is merely in a condition of \"doing straightness\" or \"doing queerness\" (Lloyd, 1999).\n\n\"For Butler, the distinction between the personal and the political or between private and public is itself a fiction designed to support an oppressive status quo: our most personal acts are, in fact, continually being scripted by [[hegemonic]] [[social conventions]] and [[ideologies]]\" (Felluga, 2006).\n\n==== Theoretical criticisms ====\n\nThere are several criticisms that have been raised against Butler's concept of performativity.  The first is that the theory is individual in nature and does not take other factors into consideration.  These factors include the space within which the performance occurs, the others involved and how they might see or interpret what they witness.  Also, the unplanned effects of the performance act are overlooked and the contingencies are not taken into consideration (Lloyd, 1999).\n\nAnother criticism is that Butler is not clear about the concept of subject.  It has been said that in her writings, sometimes the subject only exists tentatively, sometimes they possess a \"real\" existence and other times are socially active.  Also, some observe that the theory might be better suited to literary analysis as opposed to social theory. (Brickell, 2005)\n\nOthers criticize Butler for taking [[Ethnomethodology|ethnomethodological]] and [[Symbolic interactionism|symbolic interactionist]] sociological analyses of gender and merely reinventing them in the concept of performativity (Dunn 1997; Green 2007).  For example, Green (2007) argues that the work of [[Sue Kessler|Kessler]] and [[Wendy McKenna|McKenna]] (1978) and West and Zimmerman (1987) builds directly from [[Harold Garfinkel|Garfinkel]] (1967) and [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] (1959) to deconstruct gender into moments of attribution and iteration in a continual social process of \"doing\" [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]] in the [[performative interval]].  These latter works are premised on the notion that gender does not precede but, rather, follows from practice, instantiated in micro-interaction. Butler downgrades gender's constructed nature to fight for oppressed identities.\n\n== Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard ==\nIn ''[[The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge]]'' (1979, English translation 1986), philosopher and cultural theorist [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]] defined performativity as the defining mode of [[legitimation]] of postmodern knowledge and social bonds, that is, power.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge.|last=Lyotard|first=Jean-Francois|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1986|isbn=978-0816611737|location=Minneapolis|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/postmoderncondit00lyot}}</ref> In contrast to the legitimation of modern knowledge through such grand narratives as Progress, Revolution, and Liberation, performativity operates by system optimization or the calculation of input and outputs. In a footnote, Lyotard aligns performativity with Austin's concept of performative speech act. Postmodern knowledge must not only report: it must do something and do it efficiently by maximizing input/output ratios.\n\nLyotard uses [[Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics|Wittgenstein's]] notion of language games to theorize how performativity governs the articulation, funding, and conduct of contemporary research and education, arguing that at bottom it involves the threat of terror: \"be operational (that is commensurable) or disappear\" (xxiv). While Lyotard is highly critical of performativity, he notes that it calls on researchers to explain not only the worth of their work but also the worth of that worth.\n\nLyotard associated performativity with the rise of digital computers in the post-World War II period. In ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945,'' historian [[Tony Judt]] cites Lyotard to argue that the Left has largely abandoned revolutionary politics for human rights advocacy. The widespread adoption of performance reviews, organizational assessments, and learning outcomes by different social institutions worldwide has led social researchers to theorize \"audit culture\" and \"global performativity\".\n\nAgainst performativity and [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]]' call for consensus, Lyotard argued for legitimation by ''paralogy'', or the destabilizing, often paradoxical, introduction of difference into language games.\n\n== Jacques Derrida ==\nPhilosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] drew on Austin's theory of performative speech act while deconstructing its logocentric and phonocentric premises and reinscribing it within the operations of generalized writing. In contrast to structuralism's focus on linguistic form, Austin had introduced the ''force'' of speech acts, which Derrida aligns with [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] insights on language.\n\nIn \"Signature, Event, Context,\" Derrida focused on Austin's privileging of speech and the accompanying presumptions of the presence of a speaker (\"signature\") and the bounding of a performative's force by an act or a context. In a passage that would become a touchstone of poststructuralist thought, Derrida stresses the citationality or iterability of any and all signs.<blockquote>Every sign, linguistic or nonlinguistic, spoken or written (in the current sense of this opposition), in a small or large unit, can be ''cited'', put between quotation marks; in doing so it can break with every given context, engendering an infinity of new contexts in a manner which is absolutely illimitable. This does not imply that the mark is valid outside of a context, but on the contrary that there are only contexts without any center or absolute anchorage [''ancrage'']. This citationality, this duplication or duplicity, this iterability of the mark is neither an accident nor an anomaly, it is that (normal/abnormal) without which a mark could not even have a function called \"normal.\" What would a mark be that could not be cited? Or one whose origins would not get lost along the way?<ref>{{Cite book|title=Limited, Inc.|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|publisher=Northwestern University Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0810107885|location=Evanston|pages=12}}</ref></blockquote>Derrida's stress on the citational dimension of performativity would be taken up by Judith Butler and other theorists. While he addressed the performativity of individual subject formation, Derrida also raised such questions as whether we can mark when the event of the Russian revolution went awry, thus scaling up the field of performativity to historical dimensions.\n\n==John Searle's reformulation==\nIn ''[[A Taxonomy of Illocutionary Acts]]'', [[John Searle]] takes up and reformulates the ideas of his colleague [[J. L. Austin]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|last=Searle|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1979|authorlink=John Searle}}</ref> Though Searle largely supports and agrees with Austin's theory of speech acts, he has a number of critiques, which he outlines: \"In sum, there are (at least) six related difficulties with Austin's taxonomy; in ascending order of importance: there is a persistent confusion between verbs and acts, not all the verbs are illocutionary verbs, there is too much overlap of the categories, too much heterogeneity within the categories, many of the verbs listed in the categories don't satisfy the definition given for the category and, most important, there is no consistent principle of classification.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|last=Searle|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1979|pages=12|authorlink=John Searle}}</ref>\n\nHis last key departure from Austin lies in Searle's claim that four of his universal 'acts' do not need 'extra-linguistic' contexts to succeed.<ref name=\"John1979\">{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|last=Searle|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1979|pages=7|authorlink=John Searle}}</ref> As opposed to Austin who thinks all illocutionary acts need extra-linguistic institutions, Searle disregards the necessity of context and replaces it with the \"rules of language\".<ref name=\"John1979\" />\n\n== Various applications ==\n=== Finance and economics ===\nIn economics, the \"performativity thesis\" is the claim that the assumptions and models used by professionals and popularizers affect the phenomena they purport to describe; bringing the world more into line with theory.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://kieranhealy.org/files/drafts/performativity.pdf|title = The Performativity of Networks|last = Healy|first = Kieran|date = 2015|journal = European Journal of Sociology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-11-19}}</ref><ref name=\"doing\">{{cite book|title=Doing Economics|date=2010|publisher=The Open University|location=Milton Keynes|isbn=978 1 8487 34692|page=493}}</ref> This theory was developed by Michel Callon in ''The Laws of the Markets'', before being further developed in ''Do Economists Make Markets'' edited by [[Donald Angus MacKenzie]], Fabian Muniesa and Lucia Siu, and in ''Enacting Dismal Science'' edited by Ivan Boldyrev and Ekaterina Svetlova.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8442.html | title=Do Economists Make Markets?}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=http://www.palgrave.com/de/book/9781137492104# | title=Enacting Dismal Science - New Perspectives on the Performativity of Economics &#124; Ivan Boldyrev &#124; Palgrave Macmillan}}</ref> The most important work in the field is that of [[Donald Angus MacKenzie|Donald MacKenzie]] and Yuval Millo<ref>{{Cite journal|last=MacKenzie|first=Donald|last2=Millo|first2=Yuval|date=2003|title=Constructing a Market, Performing Theory: The Historical Sociology of a Financial Derivatives Exchange|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/374404|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=109|issue=1|pages=107\u2013145|doi=10.1086/374404|issn=0002-9602}}</ref> on the social construction of financial markets. In a seminal article, they showed that the option pricing theory called [[Black\u2013Scholes model|BSM]] (Black-Scholes-Merton) has been successful empirically not because of the discovery of preexisting price regularities, but because participants used it to set option prices, so that it made itself true.\n\nThe thesis of performativity of economics has been extensively criticized by Nicolas Brisset in ''Economics and Performativity''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Economics and Performativity|last=Brisset|first=Nicolas|publisher=Routledge|year=2018}}</ref> Brisset defends the idea that the notion of performativity used by Callonian and Latourian sociologists leads to an overly relativistic view of the social world. Drawing on the work of [[J. L. Austin|John Austin]] and [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], Brisset theorizes the idea of limits to performativity.To do this, Brisset considers that a theory, in order to be \"performative\", must become a convection. This requires conditions to be met. To take a convention status, a theory will have to:\n\n* Provide social actors with a representation of their social world allowing them to choose among several actions (\"Empiricity\" condition);\n* Indicate an option considered relevant when the agreement is generalised (\"Self-fulfilling\" condition);\n* Be compatible with all the conventions constituting the social environment (\"Coherency\" condition);<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brisset|first=Nicolas|date=2016-04-02|title=Economics is not always performative: some limits for performativity|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1350178X.2016.1172805|journal=Journal of Economic Methodology|volume=23|issue=2|pages=160\u2013184|doi=10.1080/1350178X.2016.1172805|issn=1350-178X}}</ref>\n\nBased on this framework, Brisset criticized the seminal work of MacKenzie and Millo on the performativity of the Black-Scholes-Merton financial model.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brisset|first=Nicolas|date=December 2017|title=ON PERFORMATIVITY: OPTION THEORY AND THE RESISTANCE OF FINANCIAL PHENOMENA|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-history-of-economic-thought/article/on-performativity-option-theory-and-the-resistance-of-financial-phenomena/5EA4680D1294F9D4593FCAB4FBAB1421#fndtn-metrics|journal=Journal of the History of Economic Thought|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=549\u2013569|doi=10.1017/S1053837217000128|issn=1053-8372}}</ref> \n\nMacKenzie's approach was also criticized by Uskali Maki for not using the concept of performativity in accordance with Austin's formulation<ref>{{Citation|last=M\u00e4ki|first=Uskali|title=Performativity: Saving Austin From Mackenzie|date=2013|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/MKIPSA|work=EPSA11 Perspectives and Foundational Problems in Philosophy of Science|pages=443\u2013453|editor-last=Karakostas|editor-first=Vassilios|publisher=Springer|access-date=2020-04-14|editor2-last=Dieks|editor2-first=Dennis}}</ref>.

In the evening of November 9, 1989, the evening of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], however, Friedrichs reportedly broke his own rule when he announced: \"The gates of the wall are wide open.\" (\u201eDie Tore in der Mauer stehen weit offen.\u201d) In reality, the gates were still closed. According to a historian, it was this announcement that encouraged thousands of East Berliners to march towards the wall, finally forcing the border guards to open the gates. In the sense of performativity, Friedrichs's words became a reality.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/tv/mauerfall/der-schoenste-fehler-in-40-jahren-tagesthemen-54357108.bild.html | title=Zum Jubil\u00e4um - der sch\u00f6nste Fehler in 40 Jahren \"Tagesthemen\"}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/30/AR2009103001846.html | title=Mary Elise Sarotte -- How an accident caused the Berlin Wall to come down| date=November 2009| last1=Sarotte| first1=Mary Elise}}</ref>\n\n===Video art===\n\nTheories of performativity have extended across multiple disciplines and discussions. Notably, interdisciplinary theorist [[Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz]] has related video to theories of performativity. Specifically, Mu\u00f1oz looks at the 1996 documentary by Susana Aiken and Carlos Aparicio, \"The Transformation.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics|author=Mu\u00f1oz|authorlink=Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz}}</ref>\n\nAlthough historically and theoretically related to performance art, [[video art]] is not an immediate performance; it is mediated, iterative and citational. In this way, video art raises questions of performativity. Additionally, video art frequently puts bodies and display, complicating borders, surfaces, embodiment, and boundaries and so indexing performativity.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*Austin, J.
