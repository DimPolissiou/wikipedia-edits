He was nicknamed the ''''Voice of Darts'''' due to his fame as a darts commentator, and worked for [[Granada Television|Granada]], [[Yorkshire Television|Yorkshire]], [[BBC]] and [[Sky Sports]]. Due to his joke telling skills he was also nicknamed the '''Thief of Bad Gags''', firstly by [[Dave Lanning]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Chadband |first=Ian |title=There's Only One Word for Waddell: Just Magic |url=https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1G1-81254489/there-s-only-one-word-for-waddell-just-magic |accessdate=22 December 2014 |work=London Evening Standard |date=3 January 2002}}</ref> He was nominated for two prestigious awards for his work, and published several books.\n\n==Early life==\nThe son of a Northumberland miner, he attended [[The King Edward VI School, Morpeth|King Edward VI School]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.morpethherald.co.uk/community/remembering-sid-the-voice-of-darts-1-4836949 | title = Remembering Sid, the voice of darts }}</ref> [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]], and he went on to obtain a scholarship to [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]],<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/darts/19232679 | title=Sid Waddell: The life and times of one of sport's greatest voices}}</ref> where he graduated with an upper second degree in Modern History. At Cambridge, Waddell played rugby for St John's, and the Cambridge University LX Club, the rugby second team. Injury brought him to darts and he started the inter-college darts competition. St John's lost in the final of this in 1961 to a team of trainee vicars from [[Selwyn College, Cambridge|Selwyn College]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Granada and Yorkshire===\nWaddell went into academia for a few years in 1962. He joined the Social Studies Department at [[Durham University]] and assisted the Professors of Politics and Economics in writing their books. He toyed with the idea of writing a book on trade unions but settled for folk singing in a duo with Charles E. Hall called the Gravyboatmen. They played on BBC ''Tonight'' and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] locally. In 1966, Waddell joined [[Granada Television]] working with [[Michael Parkinson]] on local news programmes. In 1968, he moved to [[Yorkshire Television]]. Between 1968 and 1974, Waddell was a producer for over 600 editions of local news programme, [[Calendar (News)|''Calendar'']]. He also devised the ITV network children's series ''[[The Flaxton Boys]]'' a historical adventure series that ran for three years from 1969.\n\n1972 was a big year for darts as ITV broadcast the [[News of the World Darts Championship]] for the first time. Waddell was an observer at [[Alexandra Palace]] during the 1972 News of the World Championship and was particularly impressed with the play and character of the eventual finalist, Welshman [[Alan Evans]], who beat reigning champion Dennis Filkins in the semi finals with a fiery display. Also in 1972, Waddell created the show ''[[The Indoor League]]'', which featured various pub games including [[darts]], [[Blackball (pool)|pool]], [[bar billiards]], [[Skittles (sport)|bar skittles]], [[Table football]] (aka foosball), [[arm wrestling]] and [[shove ha'penny]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sidwaddell.compsyswebdesign.com/w.htm |title=Profile from Waddell's web site |publisher=Sidwaddell.compsyswebdesign.com |accessdate=11 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060916170648/http://www.sidwaddell.compsyswebdesign.com/w.htm |archivedate=16 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ''The Indoor League'' was only shown on Yorkshire Television in 1972 but went national on the ITV network from 1973 to 1977, although Waddell had left ITV by the last series of the programme.\n\n===BBC===\nIn 1976, Waddell switched to the BBC and his experience with televised darts helped him to become one of the commentators on the first [[World Professional Darts Championship]] when it began in 1978. Waddell stayed with the BBC until 1994, commentating on all darts events covered by the BBC from 1978 to 1994, with his last darts commentary on the BBC being the first four sets of the [[1994 BDO World Darts Championship|1994 BDO World Championship Final]] between [[John Part]] and [[Bobby George]].\n\nDuring his time with the BBC, Waddell penned ten episodes of a successful children's television series, ''[[Jossy's Giants]]'' in 1986. He was also the writer of two series of another children's show ''Sloggers'' which ran from 1994 to 1996. His credits also include working with the eccentric scientist [[Magnus Pyke]] and he was [[Alan Whicker]]'s producer on ''Whicker's Women'' in 1972. He worked on the ''[[Russell Harty]] Show'', and in 1993 did a series for [[Tyne Tees Television]] called ''Waddell's World'' in which he was a butler to a posh Tweeddale family, a caravanner and on the dole.\n\nHe made one performance as the \"Voice of the Balls\" on the ''National Lottery Red Alert'' on BBC in 1999. He said he was sacked for being \"too [[Geordie]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sidwaddell.compsyswebdesign.com/pre.htm |title=Waddell's television career |publisher=Sidwaddell.compsyswebdesign.com |accessdate=11 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070928003333/http://www.sidwaddell.compsyswebdesign.com/pre.htm |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Sky Sports===\nFrom 1994, Waddell became an independently employed commentator, but mainly associated with his work with [[Sky Sports]]. The first darts tournament he commentated on for Sky Sports was the [[1994 World Matchplay (darts)|1994 World Matchplay]] at the [[Winter Gardens, Blackpool]], in August 1994. For the next 17 years, he worked continuously as a commentator on all darts tournaments televised by Sky Sports. In September 2011, Waddell was diagnosed with bowel cancer. Despite this diagnosis and undergoing treatment, he managed to come back to the darts commentary box in the spring of 2012 during some [[2012 Premier League Darts|Premier League]] nights.\n\nAfter commentating on a sporadic basis during the [[2012 Premier League Darts|2012 Premier League]], Waddell did not commentate at either the [[2012 UK Open]] nor the [[2012 World Matchplay (darts)|2012 World Matchplay]] prior to his death on 11 August 2012. Waddell's last darts commentary came in the 2012 [[2012 Premier League Darts|Premier League]] final between [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]] and [[Simon Whitlock]] on 17 May, where Phil Taylor won the match 10-7 to take the 2012 Premier League title, although Waddell only commentated on the first part of the match; his last commentary contributing to a full match came in the same evening in the semi final match between [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]] and [[James Wade]], Taylor won the match 8\u20136. The World championship trophy has been renamed eponymously in his honour, in recognition of his contribution to darts.\n\nWaddell's last interview came in June 2012, where he discussed his life, darts commentary, pool commentary and his bowel cancer. This interview was aired on Sky Sports on 16 August 2012, five days after his death, as a tribute entitled: ''Sid Waddell \u2013 A Life in His Own Words''.\n\n===Pool commentary and other works===\nBesides darts, Waddell commentated on numerous other sporting events produced by [[Sky Sports]] and/or [[Matchroom Sport]] over the years. He regularly commentated on the four annual [[nine-ball]] [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]] events on which the two companies collaborated ([[WPA World Nine-ball Championship|World Pool Championship]]; [[World Pool Masters]]; [[World Pool League]]; and [[Mosconi Cup]]), particularly between the years of 1999\u20132003. However, as these events began to be hosted further away from the UK, Waddell gradually withdrew from the sport. He is remembered for coining the term \"Golden Break\", meaning when the 9-ball is pocketed directly from the break, giving the breaking player an immediate win.\n\nIn 2004, he was the commentator for the British game show ''House of Games'' in which two families competed in various household based challenges.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420411/|IMDb page</ref>\n\nIn 2006, he began to host Sid Waddell's Wrestling Show on [[ESPN Classic (UK)|ESPN Classic]]. This show featured edited versions of matches from the days of [[World of Sport Wrestling|World of Sport]] Wrestling.\n\nIn 2007, Waddell and [[Eric Bristow]] recorded a series of ''Bellies and Bullseyes'' darts programmes about the World Darts Championship from 1978 until 1990 for ESPN Classic, which were later broadcast on the channel in December 2007.\n\n===Awards===\nWaddell was twice nominated for TV awards. He was up for [[BAFTA]] best director in 1992 for a documentary in the ''Ipso Facto'' series, and in 1994 he was nominated for best scriptwriter in the [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] awards for his children's cricket series ''Sloggers''.\n\n==Publications==\nHe wrote eleven published books, including biographies of [[John Lowe]], [[Jocky Wilson]] and [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]]. His book ''Bellies and Bullseyes'' was short listed for the British Sports Book Award for 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalsportingclub.co.uk/BritishSportsBookAwards08Nominate.htm |title=British Sports Book Awards |publisher=Nationalsportingclub.co.uk |accessdate=11 February 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080702232944/http://www.nationalsportingclub.co.uk/BritishSportsBookAwards08Nominate.htm |archivedate = 2 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nHis racy 1973 novel ''Bedroll Bella'' about a Geordie groupie, was banned by [[WH Smiths]] and [[John Menzies]]. In 2009 he published a memoir of his boyhood in a Geordie pit village ''The Road Back Home''.\n\n==Personal life==\nWaddell was married to Irene. Waddell was a fervent [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] supporter, and lived in [[Pudsey]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article3048278.ece |title=Man who delivered whole new language to sport remains as sharp as an arrow |work=The Times |location=London |date=14 December 2007 |first=Giles |last=Smith |accessdate=11 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510014005/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article3048278.ece |archivedate=10 May 2009 }}</ref> In September 2011, it was announced that Waddell had been diagnosed with [[bowel cancer]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/darts/15012394.stm|title=Commentator Sid Waddell diagnosed with bowel cancer|work=BBC News|date=21 September 2011|accessdate=21 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nHe succumbed to bowel cancer on 11 August 2012, the day after his 72nd birthday, In Harrogate, North Yorkshire.<ref name=guardian>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/12/sid-waddell-dies-aged-72 | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 12 August 2012 | title = Sid Waddell dies aged 72 | location=London | date=12 August 2012}}</ref> Following his death, the decision was made to rename the [[PDC World Darts Championship]] trophy the Sid Waddell trophy from 2013.<ref>[http://news.sky.com/story/972017/world-darts-trophy-named-after-waddell World Darts Trophy Named After Waddell].

Also in 1972, Waddell created the show ''[[The Indoor League]]'', which featured various pub games including [[darts]], [[Blackball (pool)|pool]], [[bar billiards]], [[Skittles (sport)|bar skittles]], [[Table football]] (aka foosball), [[arm wrestling]] and [[shove ha'penny]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sidwaddell.compsyswebdesign.com/w.htm |title=Profile from Waddell's web site |publisher=Sidwaddell.compsyswebdesign.com |accessdate=11 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060916170648/http://www.sidwaddell.compsyswebdesign.com/w.htm |archivedate=16 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ''The Indoor League'' was only shown on Yorkshire Television in 1972 but went national on the ITV network from 1973 to 1977, although Waddell had left ITV by the last series of the programme.\n\n===BBC===\nIn 1976, Waddell switched to the BBC and his experience with televised darts helped him to become one of the commentators on the first [[World Professional Darts Championship]] when it began in 1978. Waddell stayed with the BBC until 1994, commentating on all darts events covered by the BBC from 1978 to 1994, with his last darts commentary on the BBC being the first four sets of the [[1994 BDO World Darts Championship|1994 BDO World Championship Final]] between [[John Part]] and [[Bobby George]].\n\nDuring his time with the BBC, Waddell penned ten episodes of a successful children's television series, ''[[Jossy's Giants]]'' in 1986. He was also the writer of two series of another children's show ''Sloggers'' which ran from 1994 to 1996. His credits also include working with the eccentric scientist [[Magnus Pyke]] and he was [[Alan Whicker]]'s producer on ''Whicker's Women'' in 1972. He worked on the ''[[Russell Harty]] Show'', and in 1993 did a series for [[Tyne Tees Television]] called ''Waddell's World'' in which he was a butler to a posh Tweeddale family, a caravanner and on the dole.\n\nHe made one performance as the \"Voice of the Balls\" on the ''National Lottery Red Alert'' on BBC in 1999. He said he was sacked for being \"too [[Geordie]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sidwaddell.compsyswebdesign.com/pre.htm |title=Waddell's television career |publisher=Sidwaddell.compsyswebdesign.com |accessdate=11 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070928003333/http://www.sidwaddell.compsyswebdesign.com/pre.htm |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Sky Sports===\nFrom 1994, Waddell became an independently employed commentator, but mainly associated with his work with [[Sky Sports]]. The first darts tournament he commentated on for Sky Sports was the [[1994 World Matchplay (darts)|1994 World Matchplay]] at the [[Winter Gardens, Blackpool]], in August 1994. For the next 17 years, he worked continuously as a commentator on all darts tournaments televised by Sky Sports. In September 2011, Waddell was diagnosed with bowel cancer. Despite this diagnosis and undergoing treatment, he managed to come back to the darts commentary box in the spring of 2012 during some [[2012 Premier League Darts|Premier League]] nights.\n\nAfter commentating on a sporadic basis during the [[2012 Premier League Darts|2012 Premier League]], Waddell did not commentate at either the [[2012 UK Open]] nor the [[2012 World Matchplay (darts)|2012 World Matchplay]] prior to his death on 11 August 2012. Waddell's last darts commentary came in the 2012 [[2012 Premier League Darts|Premier League]] final between [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]] and [[Simon Whitlock]] on 17 May, where Phil Taylor won the match 10-7 to take the 2012 Premier League title, although Waddell only commentated on the first part of the match; his last commentary contributing to a full match came in the same evening in the semi final match between [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]] and [[James Wade]], Taylor won the match 8\u20136. The World championship trophy has been renamed eponymously in his honour, in recognition of his contribution to darts.\n\nWaddell's last interview came in June 2012, where he discussed his life, darts commentary, pool commentary and his bowel cancer. This interview was aired on Sky Sports on 16 August 2012, five days after his death, as a tribute entitled: ''Sid Waddell \u2013 A Life in His Own Words''.\n\n===Pool commentary and other works===\nBesides darts, Waddell commentated on numerous other sporting events produced by [[Sky Sports]] and/or [[Matchroom Sport]] over the years. He regularly commentated on the four annual [[nine-ball]] [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]] events on which the two companies collaborated ([[WPA World Nine-ball Championship|World Pool Championship]]; [[World Pool Masters]]; [[World Pool League]]; and [[Mosconi Cup]]), particularly between the years of 1999\u20132003. However, as these events began to be hosted further away from the UK, Waddell gradually withdrew from the sport. He is remembered for coining the term \"Golden Break\", meaning when the 9-ball is pocketed directly from the break, giving the breaking player an immediate win.\n\nIn 2004, he was the commentator for the British game show ''House of Games'' in which two families competed in various household based challenges.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420411/|IMDb page</ref>\n\nIn 2006, he began to host Sid Waddell's Wrestling Show on [[ESPN Classic (UK)|ESPN Classic]]. This show featured edited versions of matches from the days of [[World of Sport Wrestling|World of Sport]] Wrestling.\n\nIn 2007, Waddell and [[Eric Bristow]] recorded a series of ''Bellies and Bullseyes'' darts programmes about the World Darts Championship from 1978 until 1990 for ESPN Classic, which were later broadcast on the channel in December 2007.\n\n===Awards===\nWaddell was twice nominated for TV awards. He was up for [[BAFTA]] best director in 1992 for a documentary in the ''Ipso Facto'' series, and in 1994 he was nominated for best scriptwriter in the [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] awards for his children's cricket series ''Sloggers''.\n\n==Publications==\nHe wrote eleven published books, including biographies of [[John Lowe]], [[Jocky Wilson]] and [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]]. His book ''Bellies and Bullseyes'' was short listed for the British Sports Book Award for 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalsportingclub.co.uk/BritishSportsBookAwards08Nominate.htm |title=British Sports Book Awards |publisher=Nationalsportingclub.co.uk |accessdate=11 February 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080702232944/http://www.nationalsportingclub.co.uk/BritishSportsBookAwards08Nominate.htm |archivedate = 2 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nHis racy 1973 novel ''Bedroll Bella'' about a Geordie groupie, was banned by [[WH Smiths]] and [[John Menzies]]. In 2009 he published a memoir of his boyhood in a Geordie pit village ''The Road Back Home''.\n\n==Personal life==\nWaddell was married to Irene. Waddell was a fervent [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] supporter, and lived in [[Pudsey]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article3048278.ece |title=Man who delivered whole new language to sport remains as sharp as an arrow |work=The Times |location=London |date=14 December 2007 |first=Giles |last=Smith |accessdate=11 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510014005/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article3048278.ece |archivedate=10 May 2009 }}</ref> In September 2011, it was announced that Waddell had been diagnosed with [[bowel cancer]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/darts/15012394.stm|title=Commentator Sid Waddell diagnosed with bowel cancer|work=BBC news|date=21 September 2011|accessdate=21 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nHe succumbed to bowel cancer on 11 August 2012, the day after his 72nd birthday, In Harrogate, North Yorkshire.<ref name=guardian>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/12/sid-waddell-dies-aged-72 | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 12 August 2012 | title = Sid Waddell dies aged 72 | location=London | date=12 August 2012}}</ref> Following his death, the decision was made to rename the [[PDC World Darts Championship]] trophy the Sid Waddell trophy from 2013.<ref>[http://news.sky.com/story/972017/world-darts-trophy-named-after-waddell World Darts Trophy Named After Waddell].

In 2014 he won this Grammy Award again (that meanwhile changed the name to \"Best Music Film\"), this time for \"Live Kisses\" [[Paul McCartney]] concert film. Jonas \u00c5kerlund, [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]] and Bob Smeaton are the only directors to have won this award twice sharing the record for most wins in this category (check here all winners and nominees of [[Grammy Award for Best Music Film]]).\n\n==Career==\n\u00c5kerlund was a member of the Swedish [[black metal]] band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] from 1983 to 1984. He also directed Candlemass' first video \"Bewitched\". He first found fame as the main video director for [[Roxette]]. In 1997, he directed the acclaimed video for [[The Prodigy]]'s \"[[Smack My Bitch Up]]\", which sparked controversy due to its depiction of drug use, violence, and nudity. In 1998, he worked with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for the song \"[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]\", and has since worked with acts such as [[Metallica]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[U2]], [[Blink-182]], [[P!nk]], [[Rammstein]], [[Britney Spears]], and [[Lady Gaga]]. He directed the music video for the [[Smashing Pumpkins]]' \"Try, Try, Try\", from which a short film entitled ''Try'' was spawned. He was also the designer and photographer for the [[Roxette]] album ''[[Room Service (Roxette album)|Room Service]]'' in 2001. In 2002, his first full-length film, ''[[Spun]]'', debuted.\n\n\u00c5kerlund directed commercials for Swedish clothing retailer MQ and the re-imagining of the Devo song \"Watch Us Work It\" used in [[Dell Computers]] commercials. He is a long-time collaborator of Madonna, having worked on such music videos as \"Music\", \"American Life\" (which was pulled due to its graphic content and the [[Iraq War]]), and \"Jump\". He also directed her documentary film ''[[I'm Going to Tell You a Secret]]'' and her concert special ''[[The Confessions Tour (album)|The Confessions Tour: Live from London]]''. Among his more recent works were the controversial pornographic music video for [[Rammstein]]'s \"[[Pussy (Rammstein song)|Pussy]]\", the video for the song \"[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]\" by [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Beyonc\u00e9]], \"[[Moves like Jagger]]\" by [[Maroon 5]] and [[Christina Aguilera]], and [[Duran Duran]]'s single \"Girl Panic!\".<ref name=\"MTV gaga\">{{cite

His video for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s song \"[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]\" won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video|Best Music Video, Short Form]], and a record seven awards at [[1998 MTV Video Music Awards]], including the [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]].\n\nIn 2008 he won another Grammy Award, this time around for \"Best Long Form Music Video\" for another work with Madonna \u2013 directing \"The Confessions Tour\" DVD. In 2014 he won this Grammy Award again (that meanwhile changed the name to \"Best Music Film\"), this time for \"Live Kisses\" [[Paul McCartney]] concert film. Jonas \u00c5kerlund, [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]] and Bob Smeaton are the only directors to have won this award twice sharing the record for most wins in this category (check here all winners and nominees of [[Grammy Award for Best Music Film]]).\n\n==Career==\n\u00c5kerlund was a member of the Swedish [[black metal]] band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] from 1983 to 1984. He also directed Candlemass' first video \"Bewitched\". He first found fame as the main video director for [[Roxette]]. In 1997, he directed the acclaimed video for [[The Prodigy]]'s \"[[Smack My Bitch Up]]\", which sparked controversy due to its depiction of drug use, violence, and nudity. In 1998, he worked with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for the song \"[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]\", and has since worked with acts such as [[Metallica]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[U2]], [[Blink-182]], [[P!nk]], [[Rammstein]], [[Britney Spears]], and [[Lady Gaga]]. He directed the music video for the [[Smashing Pumpkins]]' \"Try, Try, Try\", from which a short film entitled ''Try'' was spawned. He was also the designer and photographer for the [[Roxette]] album ''[[Room Service (Roxette album)|Room Service]]'' in 2001. In 2002, his first full-length film, ''[[Spun]]'', debuted.\n\n\u00c5kerlund directed commercials for Swedish clothing retailer MQ and the re-imagining of the Devo song \"Watch Us Work It\" used in [[Dell Computers]] commercials. He is a long-time collaborator of Madonna, having worked on such music videos as \"Music\", \"American Life\" (which was pulled due to its graphic content and the [[Iraq War]]), and \"Jump\". He also directed her documentary film ''[[I'm Going to Tell You a Secret]]'' and her concert special ''[[The Confessions Tour (album)|The Confessions Tour: Live from London]]''. Among his more recent works were the controversial pornographic music video for [[Rammstein]]'s \"[[Pussy (Rammstein song)|Pussy]]\", the video for the song \"[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]\" by [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Beyonc\u00e9]], \"[[Moves like Jagger]]\" by [[Maroon 5]] and [[Christina Aguilera]], and [[Duran Duran]]'s single \"Girl Panic!\".<ref name=\"MTV gaga\">{{cite

She had an excellent [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] education and a reputation as one of the most learned young women of her day.<ref name=\"ascham213\">{{harvnb|Ascham|1863|p=213}}</ref> In May 1553, she married [[Lord Guildford Dudley]], a younger son of Edward's chief minister [[John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland]]. In June 1553, Edward VI wrote his will, nominating Jane and her male heirs as successors to the Crown, in part because his half-sister [[Mary I of England|Mary]] was Roman Catholic, while Jane was a committed Protestant and would support the reformed [[Church of England]], whose foundation Edward claimed to have laid. The will removed his half-sisters, Mary and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], from the line of succession on account of their illegitimacy, subverting their claims under the [[Third Succession Act]].\n\nAfter Edward's death, Jane was proclaimed queen on 10 July 1553 and awaited coronation in the [[Tower of London]]. Support for Mary grew very quickly, and most of Jane's supporters abandoned her. The [[Privy Council of England]] suddenly changed sides and proclaimed Mary as queen on 19 July 1553, deposing Jane. Her primary supporter, her father-in-law the Duke of Northumberland, was accused of treason and executed less than a month later. Jane was held prisoner in the Tower and was convicted in November 1553 of high treason, which carried a sentence of death\u2014though Mary initially spared her life. However, Jane soon became viewed as a threat to the Crown when her father, [[Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], got involved with [[Wyatt's rebellion]] against Queen Mary's intention to marry [[Philip II of Spain]]. Both Jane and her husband were executed on 12 February 1554.\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\nLady Jane Grey was the eldest daughter of [[Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], and his wife, [[Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk|Frances]]. The traditional view is that she was born at [[Bradgate Park]] in [[Leicestershire]] in October 1537, while more recent research indicates that she was born somewhat earlier, possibly in London, in late 1536 or in the spring of 1537.<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|pp=36, 299}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|de Lisle|2008|pp=5\u20138}}</ref> Frances was the elder daughter of [[King Henry VIII]]'s younger sister, [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary]]. Jane had two younger sisters, [[Lady Catherine Grey|Lady Catherine]] and [[Lady Mary Grey|Lady Mary]]; through their mother, the three sisters were great-granddaughters of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], grandnieces of Henry VIII, and first cousins once removed of [[Edward VI]], [[Mary I]] and [[Elizabeth I]].\n\nJane received a humanist education, studying [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] with [[John Aylmer (bishop)|John Aylmer]], and Italian with [[Michelangelo Florio]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|pp=51, 65}}</ref> Through the influence of her father and her tutors, she became a committed Protestant and also corresponded with the [[Z\u00fcrich]] reformer [[Heinrich Bullinger]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|pp=63\u201367}}</ref>\n\nJane preferred book studies to hunting parties<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|p=51}}</ref> and regarded her strict upbringing, which was typical of the time,<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|p=53}}</ref> as harsh. To the visiting scholar [[Roger Ascham]], who found her reading [[Plato]], she is said to have complained: <blockquote>\nFor when I am in the presence either of father or mother, whether I speak, keep silence, sit, stand or go, eat, drink, be merry or sad, be sewing, playing, dancing, or doing anything else, I must do it as it were in such weight, measure and number, even so perfectly as God made the world; or else I am so sharply taunted, so cruelly threatened, yea presently sometimes with pinches, nips and bobs and other ways (which I will not name for the honour I bear them) ... that I think myself in hell.<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|p=52}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn early February 1547, Jane was sent to live in the household of Edward VI's uncle, [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]], who soon married Henry VIII's widow, [[Catherine Parr]]. Jane lived with the couple at [[Sudeley Castle]] in [[Gloucestershire]] until Catherine's [[death in childbirth]] in September 1548.<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|pp=42\u201345}}</ref>\n\n== Contracts for marriage ==\nLady Jane acted as chief mourner at Catherine Parr's funeral; Thomas Seymour showed continued interest to keep her in his household, and she returned there for about two months before he was arrested at the end of 1548.<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|pp=45\u201347}}</ref> Seymour's brother, the [[Lord Protector]], [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]], felt threatened by Thomas' popularity with the young King Edward.

After his fourth interrogation by the [[Privy Council of England|King's Council]], he proposed his daughter Jane as a bride for the Protector's eldest son, [[Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford|Lord Hertford]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|p=47}}</ref> Nothing came of this, however, and Jane was not engaged until the spring of 1553, her bridegroom being [[Lord Guildford Dudley]], a younger son of [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland]].<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|1996|pp=238\u2013239}}</ref> The Duke, [[Lord President of the Council|Lord President]] of the [[privy council|King's Council]] from late 1549, was then the most powerful man in the country.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|1996|p=179}}</ref> On 25 May 1553, the couple were married at [[Durham House (London)|Durham House]] in a triple wedding, in which Jane's sister [[Lady Catherine Grey|Catherine]] was matched with the heir of the [[William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1551 creation)|Earl of Pembroke]], [[Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Lord Herbert]], and another [[Katherine Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon|Katherine]], Lord Guildford's sister, with [[Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon|Henry Hastings]], the [[Francis Hastings, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon|Earl of Huntingdon]]'s heir.<ref>{{harvnb|de Lisle|2008|pp=93, 304}}; {{harvnb|Ives|2009|p=321}}.</ref>\n\n== Claim to the throne and accession ==\n{{See also|Third Succession Act}}\n[[File:Edward VI's 'devise for the succession'.png|thumb|\"My devise for the Succession\" by Edward VI.

Furthermore, this Act authorised Henry VIII to alter the succession by his will. Henry's will reinforced the succession of his three children, and then declared that, should none of them leave descendants, the throne would pass to heirs of his younger sister, Mary, which included Jane. For unknown reasons, Henry excluded Jane's mother, Frances Grey, from the succession,<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|p=35}}</ref> and also bypassed the claims of the descendants of his elder sister, [[Margaret Tudor|Margaret]], who had married into the Scottish royal house and nobility.\n\nBoth Mary and Elizabeth had been named illegitimate by statute during the reign of Henry VIII after his marriages to [[Catherine of Aragon]] and [[Anne Boleyn]] had been declared void.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gah0RdbHKmYC&pg=PA38 |page=38|title=A Constitutional History of Secession|isbn=9781455602889}}</ref> When the 15-year-old Edward VI lay dying in the early summer of 1553, his Catholic half-sister Mary was still his heir presumptive. However, Edward, in a draft will (\"My devise for the Succession\") composed earlier in 1553, had first restricted the succession to (non-existent) male descendants of Frances Brandon and her daughters, before he named his Protestant cousin \"Lady Jane and her heirs male\" as his successors, probably in June 1553; the intent was to ensure his Protestant legacy, thereby bypassing Mary, who was a Roman Catholic.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/reformation22lind |page=[https://archive.org/details/reformation22lind/page/149 149] |title=The Reformation |publisher=T. & T.

Most importantly, he had to isolate and, ideally, capture Mary Tudor to prevent her from gathering support. As soon as Mary was sure of King Edward's demise, she left her residence at [[Hunsdon]] and set out to [[East Anglia]], where she began to rally her supporters. Northumberland set out from London with troops on 14 July to capture Mary. The [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] switched their allegiance and proclaimed Mary queen in London, on 19 July. The historical consensus assumes that this was in recognition of overwhelming support of the population for Mary. However, there is no clear evidence for that outside Norfolk and Suffolk, where Northumberland had put down Kett's Rebellion; hence, where princess Mary sought refuge. Rather, it seems that [[Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel]]\u2014whom Northumberland had arrested and detained twice as an ally of Somerset, before rehabilitating\u2014engineered a coup d'\u00e9tat in the Privy Council in Northumberland's absence.<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|pp=222\u2013223, 233\u2013236}}</ref>\n\nJane is often called the Nine-Day Queen, although if her reign is dated from the moment of Edward's death on 6 July 1553, her reign could have been a few days longer.<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|p=1}}</ref> On 19 July 1553, Jane was imprisoned in the Tower's Gentleman Gaoler's (Jailer's) apartments, her husband in the Beauchamp Tower.

She had an excellent [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] education and a reputation as one of the most learned young women of her day.<ref name=\"ascham213\">{{harvnb|Ascham|1863|p=213}}</ref> In May 1553, she married [[Lord Guildford Dudley]], a younger son of Edward's chief minister [[John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland]]. In June 1553, Edward VI wrote his will, nominating Jane and her male heirs as successors to the Crown, in part because his half-sister [[Mary I of England|Mary]] was Roman Catholic, while Jane was a committed Protestant and would support the reformed [[Church of England]], whose foundation Edward claimed to have laid. The will removed his half-sisters, Mary and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], from the line of succession on account of their illegitimacy, subverting their claims under the [[Third Succession Act]].\n\nAfter Edward's death, Jane was proclaimed queen on 10 July 1553 and awaited coronation in the [[Tower of London]]. Support for Mary grew very quickly, and most of Jane's supporters abandoned her. The [[Privy Council of England]] suddenly changed sides and proclaimed Mary as queen on 19 July 1553, deposing Jane. Her primary supporter, her father-in-law the Duke of Northumberland, was accused of treason and executed less than a month later. Jane was held prisoner in the Tower and was convicted in November 1553 of high treason, which carried a sentence of death\u2014though Mary initially spared her life. However, Jane soon became viewed as a threat to the Crown when her father, [[Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], got involved with [[Wyatt's rebellion]] against Queen Mary's intention to marry [[Philip II of Spain]]. Both Jane and her husband were executed on 12 February 1554.\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\nLady Jane Grey was the eldest daughter of [[Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], and his wife, [[Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk|Frances]]. The traditional view is that she was born at [[Bradgate Park]] in [[Leicestershire]] in October 1537, while more recent research indicates that she was born somewhat earlier, possibly in London, in late 1536 or in the spring of 1537.<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|pp=36, 299}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|de Lisle|2008|pp=5\u20138}}</ref> Frances was the elder daughter of [[King Henry VIII]]'s younger sister, [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary]]. Jane had two younger sisters, [[Lady Catherine Grey|Lady Catherine]] and [[Lady Mary Grey|Lady Mary]]; through their mother, the three sisters were great-granddaughters of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], grandnieces of Henry VIII, and first cousins once removed of [[Edward VI]], [[Mary I]] and [[Elizabeth I]].\n\nJane received a humanist education, studying [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] with [[John Aylmer (bishop)|John Aylmer]], and Italian with [[Michelangelo Florio]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|pp=51, 65}}</ref> Through the influence of her father and her tutors, she became a committed Protestant and also corresponded with the [[Z\u00fcrich]] reformer [[Heinrich Bullinger]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|pp=63\u201367}}</ref>\n\nJane preferred book studies to hunting parties<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|p=51}}</ref> and regarded her strict upbringing, which was typical of the time,<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|p=53}}</ref> as harsh. To the visiting scholar [[Roger Ascham]], who found her reading [[Plato]], she is said to have complained: <blockquote>\nFor when I am in the presence either of father or mother, whether I speak, keep silence, sit, stand or go, eat, drink, be merry or sad, be sewing, playing, dancing, or doing anything else, I must do it as it were in such weight, measure and number, even so perfectly as God made the world; or else I am so sharply taunted, so cruelly threatened, yea presently sometimes with pinches, nips and bobs and other ways (which I will not name for the honour I bear them) ... that I think myself in hell.<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|p=52}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn early February 1547, Jane was sent to live in the household of Edward VI's uncle, [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]], who soon married Henry VIII's widow, [[Catherine Parr]]. Jane lived with the couple at [[Sudeley Castle]] in [[Gloucestershire]] until Catherine's [[death in childbirth]] in September 1548.<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|pp=42\u201345}}</ref>\n\n== Contracts for marriage ==\nLady Jane acted as chief mourner at Catherine Parr's funeral; Thomas Seymour showed continued interest to keep her in his household, and she returned there for about two months before he was arrested at the end of 1548.<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|pp=45\u201347}}</ref> Seymour's brother, the [[Lord Protector]], [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]], felt threatened by Thomas' popularity with the young King Edward.

After his fourth interrogation by the [[Privy Council of England|King's Council]], he proposed his daughter Jane as a bride for the Protector's eldest son, [[Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford|Lord Hertford]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|p=47}}</ref> Nothing came of this, however, and Jane was not engaged until the spring of 1553, her bridegroom being [[Lord Guildford Dudley]], a younger son of [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland]].<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|1996|pp=238\u2013239}}</ref> The Duke, [[Lord President of the Council|Lord President]] of the [[privy council|King's Council]] from late 1549, was then the most powerful man in the country.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|1996|p=179}}</ref> On 25 May 1553, the couple were married at [[Durham House (London)|Durham House]] in a triple wedding, in which Jane's sister [[Lady Catherine Grey|Catherine]] was matched with the heir of the [[William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1551 creation)|Earl of Pembroke]], [[Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Lord Herbert]], and another [[Katherine Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon|Katherine]], Lord Guildford's sister, with [[Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon|Henry Hastings]], the [[Francis Hastings, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon|Earl of Huntingdon]]'s heir.<ref>{{harvnb|de Lisle|2008|pp=93, 304}}; {{harvnb|Ives|2009|p=321}}.</ref>\n\n== Claim to the throne and accession ==\n{{See also|Third Succession Act}}\n[[File:Edward VI's 'devise for the succession'.png|thumb|\"My devise for the Succession\" by Edward VI.

Furthermore, this Act authorised Henry VIII to alter the succession by his will. Henry's will reinforced the succession of his three children, and then declared that, should none of them leave descendants, the throne would pass to heirs of his younger sister, Mary, which included Jane. For unknown reasons, Henry excluded Jane's mother, Frances Grey, from the succession,<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2009|p=35}}</ref> and also bypassed the claims of the descendants of his elder sister, [[Margaret Tudor|Margaret]], who had married into the Scottish royal house and nobility.\n\nBoth Mary and Elizabeth had been named illegitimate by statute during the reign of Henry VIII after his marriages to [[Catherine of Aragon]] and [[Anne Boleyn]] had been declared void.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gah0RdbHKmYC&pg=PA38 |page=38|title=A Constitutional History of Secession|isbn=9781455602889}}</ref> When the 15-year-old Edward VI lay dying in the early summer of 1553, his Catholic half-sister Mary was still his heir presumptive.

Most importantly, he had to isolate and, ideally, capture Mary Tudor to prevent her from gathering support. As soon as Mary was sure of King Edward's demise, she left her residence at [[Hunsdon]] and set out to [[East Anglia]], where she began to rally her supporters. Northumberland set out from London with troops on 14 July to capture Mary. The [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] switched their allegiance and proclaimed Mary queen in London, on 19 July. The historical consensus assumes that this was in recognition of overwhelming support of the population for Mary. However, there is no clear evidence for that outside Norfolk and Suffolk, where Northumberland had put down Kett's Rebellion; hence, where princess Mary sought refuge.

Opened in 1844 and part of the [[Manchester station group]], Victoria is Manchester's busiest railway station after [[Manchester Piccadilly station|Piccadilly]] and [[Manchester Oxford Road railway station|Oxford Road]] and the busiest station managed by [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]] after Oxford Road.\n\nThe station hosts local and regional services to destinations in [[Northern England]], such as {{rws|Blackburn}}, {{rws|Rochdale}}, [[Bradford Interchange|Bradford]], {{rws|Leeds}}, {{rws|Newcastle}}, {{rws|Huddersfield}}, [[Halifax railway station (West Yorkshire)|Halifax]], [[Wigan Wallgate railway station|Wigan]], {{rws|Southport}}, [[Blackpool North railway station|Blackpool]] (Sundays Only) and [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Liverpool]] using the original [[Manchester and Liverpool Railway|Liverpool to Manchester line]]. Most trains calling at Victoria are operated by Northern. [[TransPennine Express]] services call at the station from Liverpool to Newcastle /Scarborough and services towards Manchester Airport (via Ordsall Chord) from Middlesbrough/Newcastle.\n\nManchester Victoria is a [[#Victoria tram stop|major interchange]] for the [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] [[light rail]] system. Two former railway lines into the station have been converted to [[tram]] operation: the [[Bury Line|line to Bury]] was converted in the early 1990s in the first phase of Metrolink construction, and the line [[Oldham and Rochdale Line|through Oldham to Rochdale]] was converted during 2009\u20132014. In the other direction, trams switch to on-street running when they emerge from Victoria Station and continue southwards through the city centre to Piccadilly or Deansgate-Castlefield.\n\nIn 2009, Victoria was voted the worst [[United Kingdom railway station categories|category B]] interchange station in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news |title= Is Victoria UK's worst station? |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/manchester/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8364000/8364598.stm |work= BBC News |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref> The station underwent a two-year \u00a344 million modernisation programme which was completed in August 2015.<ref>{{cite news |title=Manchester Victoria station's restoration works start |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-22069010 |work=BBC News |date=9 April 2013 |accessdate=9 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"railtechnologymagazine.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.railtechnologymagazine.com/Rail-News/manchester-victoria-upgrades-to-be-finished-this-month|title=Manchester Victoria upgrades to be finished this month|website=www.railtechnologymagazine.com}}</ref> Renovation entailed electrification of lines through the station, renewed Metrolink stop with an additional platform, restoration of listed features, upgraded retail units, and a new roof.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Engineering work at Manchester Victoria stops trains |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-24954232 |work=BBC News |date=15 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Manchester Victoria Metrolink station closes for upgrade |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-26295791 |work=BBC News |date=2 May 2014 |accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> The [[Ordsall Chord]] directly linking Victoria to Oxford Road and Piccadilly was completed in December 2017.

The company realised it would be advantageous to join its line to the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] (L&MR) creating a through route from Liverpool to Yorkshire with a joint station serving the centre of Manchester.{{sfn|Wray|2004|pp=1-5}} In 1839 [[Samuel Brooks (railway pioneer)|Samuel Brooks]], vice-chairman of the M&LR, bought land at Hunt's Bank close to the cathedral and presented it to the company for the new station. The site was on the north bank of the [[River Irk]], between the [[workhouse]] to the north which had opened in 1793 and Walker's Croft Cemetery to the south. After several years of negotiations between the companies, work started in 1842. The M&LR built an extension from [[Miles Platting]] to the station which opened on 1 January 1844. On this date, the Oldham Road terminus was closed to passenger services and became a goods station. The new station had a {{convert|852|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} long single platform which handled M&LR trains to Leeds and elsewhere at its eastern end. The L&MR extended its line from [[Ordsall, Greater Manchester|Ordsall]] to Victoria and its trains operated from the western end from 4 May 1844, on which date its [[Manchester Liverpool Road railway station|Liverpool Road station]] terminus became a goods station.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ferneyhough|1980|p=105}}</ref><ref name=\"RailofMan\">{{cite book|last1=Goode|first1=C.T.|title=The Railways of Manchester|date=1986|isbn=0-9508239-8-8|pages=19, 30\u201331}}</ref>\n\nThe station was named Victoria in 1843.

The headquarters of the L&YR were based alongside Victoria.{{sfn|Wray|2004|p=21}}\n[[File:Manchester Victoria & Exchange Stations geograph-2169556-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|left|Platforms 11 (left) and 12 (right), looking west towards {{stnlnk|Manchester Exchange}} in 1964]]\n\n===Expansion===\nBy the mid-1840s six railway companies operated from the station connecting Manchester to London, [[Glasgow]], [[Liverpool]], [[Leeds]] and [[Sheffield]]. Victoria Station dominated the Long Millgate area and was one of the biggest passenger stations in Britain.\n\nVictoria underwent several phases of expansion as traffic grew. In 1865, four bay platforms were built on the eastern side on land reclaimed from the cemetery, and another was built on the western side, a second through platform was built at the northern side, and the station's facilities were expanded by the construction of a new east wing of the station building.{{sfn|Wray|2004|pp=30-33}} Two decades later, the L&YR purchased the workhouse north of the station and its site was used to build another bay and five through platforms which came into use in 1884.{{sfn|Wray|2004|pp=36-41}} That same year, the LNWR opened its own station, {{rws|Manchester Exchange}} immediately to the west on the opposite side of the [[River Irwell]], and vacated Victoria.{{sfn|Wray|2004|pp=59-62}}\n[[File:Manchester Victoria, 1968 - geograph.org.uk - 1610488.jpg|thumb|The station's bay platforms 6-10 in 1968, only the two on the right still exist.]]\n[[File:Manchester Victoria station 19-10-2009 12-20-16.JPG|thumb|right|Overlooking the station concourse in 2012 before re-development in 2014.]]\nVictoria reached its maximum extent of 17 platforms in 1904 when the station was enlarged with extra bay platforms to the south. The present station fa\u00e7ade, designed by William Dawes, was built in 1909.{{sfn|Wray|2004|pp=73-91}} The cast-iron [[train shed]]s behind the fa\u00e7ade were {{convert|700|yd|m|-1}} long.\n\nBecause the station handled large amounts of parcel and newspaper traffic, an overhead parcels carrier system was constructed in 1895. It consisted of an electrically powered trolley suspended from an overhead track operated by an airborne attendant. A large basket could be raised and lowered from the trolley to distribute parcels and newspapers across the station. The system operated until 1940.{{sfn|Wray|2004|pp=64-72}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Parcel carrier, 1912 |url=https://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10443986 |website=Science and Society |accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe L&YR merged with the LNWR on 1 January 1922. A year later, the merged company became the largest constituent of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] (LMS). From 16 April 1929, Victoria and Exchange station were linked by the westward extension of platform 11 over the Irwell bridge, known as platform \"11 Middle\", which joined to Exchange's platform 3 to create Europe's longest platform at {{convert|2238|ft|m}}. Crossovers enabled it to accommodate three trains arriving and departing independently.<ref>Joyce, J.

On 23 December 1940, several bombs hit the station destroying the parcels office, and a large part of the roof over platforms 12 to 16. The parcels office was rebuilt, but the damaged parts of the roof were taken down and not replaced.{{sfn|Wray|2004|pp=124-125}} The station came into the ownership of [[British Railways]] in 1948.\n\n===Picc-Vic tunnel and Metrolink===\nProposals to build an underground station, ''Victoria Low Level'' as part of the [[Picc-Vic tunnel]] project emerged in the early-1970s.<ref name=\"piccvic-leaflet\">{{citation |date=October 1971|title=SELNEC Picc-Vic Line |publisher=SELNEC PTE }} publicity brochure</ref> The scheme proposed creating a direct rail link between Victoria and {{stn|Manchester Piccadilly}} via a tunnel and creating several underground stations in [[Manchester city centre]].

As a result, the stations were linked by the [[Manchester Metrolink]] system which opened in 1992.

Between 1992 and 1994, the [[Manchester Arena]] was built over the northern part of the station site. Three of the five through tracks between platforms 11 and 12 were removed, along with platforms 12-17. The station was reduced to four through tracks and four through platforms, three of which were built to replace the removed platforms 12-14. They are covered by the Arena which was joined to the station by means of a raft above them. The Arena is accessed via stairs on Hunts Bank and from the station concourse. Following reconstruction, the platforms were renumbered; platforms 1 and 2 are bay platforms facing east (formerly platforms 9 and 10), and the through platforms are 3 to 6 (platform 3 was formerly platform 11).

Reinstatement of the south and west curve at [[Todmorden]] on the [[Caldervale Line]] facilitated a direct service between Victoria and [[Burnley Manchester Road]] Station for the first time in almost fifty years.\n\n===Electrification===\nIn the 1900s the [[Bury Line]], a busy commuter line which served the suburbs of north Manchester from Victoria, was losing passengers to [[Manchester Corporation Tramways|tramway competition]], in response to this, in 1914 the L&YR decided to [[Railway electrification in Great Britain|electrify]] this line using a unique 1,200 volt side-contact [[third rail]] system, in an effort to win back passengers. Electrification of this route was completed in 1916. As the scheme was a success, in the early 1920s the L&YR drew up plans to extend electrification to the [[Oldham Loop Line]] using the same system. The scheme progressed to an advanced stage, however with the reorganisations of railway companies in the 1920s, the new management had no interest in pursuing the scheme and it was dropped. This meant that the Bury Line remained as the only electrified line into Victoria, and it remained as such until 1991 when it was closed to be converted into part of the Metrolink system.{{sfn|Wray|2004|pp=103-105}}\n\nNo further electrification came to Victoria until the 21st century, when as part of [[Network Rail]]'s [[Northern Hub]] scheme, overhead electric wires have been erected to Victoria from [[Liverpool-Manchester lines|Manchester to Liverpool]] in 2015,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/News-Releases/Better-rail-services-become-a-reality-between-Liverpool-Lime-Street-and-Manchester-Airport-station-22b0.aspx |title=Better rail services become a reality between Liverpool Lime Street and Manchester Airport station |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=5 March 2015 |website=Network Rail Media Centre |publisher=Network Rail |access-date=5 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150309092746/http://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/News-Releases/Better-rail-services-become-a-reality-between-Liverpool-Lime-Street-and-Manchester-Airport-station-22b0.aspx |archivedate=9 March 2015 }}</ref>  and [[Manchester to Preston Line|Manchester to Preston]] and through to [[Blackpool branch lines|Blackpool]] in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=First electric passenger trains finally entering service in Bolton |url=https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/17426252.first-electric-passenger-trains-finally-entering-service-in-bolton/ |publisher=The Bolton News |accessdate=7 August 2019 |date=12 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Layout==\nManchester Victoria has six railway platforms and the Metrolink stop has four (four platform faces on three tracks).

Situated to the north of the [[Manchester city centre|city centre]] on Hunts Bank, close to [[Manchester Cathedral]], it adjoins [[Manchester Arena]] which was constructed on part of the former station site in the 1990s. Opened in 1844 and part of the [[Manchester station group]], Victoria is Manchester's busiest railway station after [[Manchester Piccadilly station|Piccadilly]] and [[Manchester Oxford Road railway station|Oxford Road]] and the busiest station managed by [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]] after Oxford Road.\n\nThe station hosts local and regional services to destinations in [[Northern England]], such as {{rws|Blackburn}}, {{rws|Rochdale}}, [[Bradford Interchange|Bradford]], {{rws|Leeds}}, {{rws|Newcastle}}, {{rws|Huddersfield}}, [[Halifax railway station (West Yorkshire)|Halifax]], [[Wigan Wallgate railway station|Wigan]], {{rws|Southport}}, [[Blackpool North railway station|Blackpool]] (Sundays Only) and [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Liverpool]] using the original [[Manchester and Liverpool Railway|Liverpool to Manchester line]]. Most trains calling at Victoria are operated by Northern. [[TransPennine Express]] services call at the station from Liverpool to Newcastle /Scarborough and services towards Manchester Airport (via Ordsall Chord) from Middlesbrough/Newcastle.\n\nManchester Victoria is a [[#Victoria tram stop|major interchange]] for the [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] [[light rail]] system. Two former railway lines into the station have been converted to [[tram]] operation: the [[Bury Line|line to Bury]] was converted in the early 1990s in the first phase of Metrolink construction, and the line [[Oldham and Rochdale Line|through Oldham to Rochdale]] was converted during 2009\u20132014. In the other direction, trams switch to on-street running when they emerge from Victoria Station and continue southwards through the city centre to Piccadilly or Deansgate-Castlefield.\n\nIn 2009, Victoria was voted the worst [[United Kingdom railway station categories|category B]] interchange station in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news |title= Is Victoria UK's worst station? |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/manchester/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8364000/8364598.stm |work= BBC News |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref> The station underwent a two-year \u00a344 million modernisation programme which was completed in August 2015.<ref>{{cite news |title=Manchester Victoria station's restoration works start |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-22069010 |work=BBC News |date=9 April 2013 |accessdate=9 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"railtechnologymagazine.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.railtechnologymagazine.com/Rail-News/manchester-victoria-upgrades-to-be-finished-this-month|title=Manchester Victoria upgrades to be finished this month|website=www.railtechnologymagazine.com}}</ref> Renovation entailed electrification of lines through the station, renewed Metrolink stop with an additional platform, restoration of listed features, upgraded retail units, and a new roof.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Engineering work at Manchester Victoria stops trains |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-24954232 |work=BBC News |date=15 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Manchester Victoria Metrolink station closes for upgrade |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-26295791 |work=BBC News |date=2 May 2014 |accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> The [[Ordsall Chord]] directly linking Victoria to Oxford Road and Piccadilly was completed in December 2017.

Originally its line terminated at [[Manchester Oldham Road railway station|Manchester Oldham Road]] which opened on 3 July 1839. The company realised it would be advantageous to join its line to the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] (L&MR) creating a through route from Liverpool to Yorkshire with a joint station serving the centre of Manchester.{{sfn|Wray|2004|pp=1-5}} In 1839 [[Samuel Brooks (railway pioneer)|Samuel Brooks]], vice-chairman of the M&LR, bought land at Hunt's Bank close to the cathedral and presented it to the company for the new station. The site was on the north bank of the [[River Irk]], between the [[workhouse]] to the north which had opened in 1793 and Walker's Croft Cemetery to the south. After several years of negotiations between the companies, work started in 1842. The M&LR built an extension from [[Miles Platting]] to the station which opened on 1 January 1844. On this date, the Oldham Road terminus was closed to passenger services and became a goods station. The new station had a {{convert|852|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} long single platform which handled M&LR trains to Leeds and elsewhere at its eastern end. The L&MR extended its line from [[Ordsall, Greater Manchester|Ordsall]] to Victoria and its trains operated from the western end from 4 May 1844, on which date its [[Manchester Liverpool Road railway station|Liverpool Road station]] terminus became a goods station.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ferneyhough|1980|p=105}}</ref><ref name=\"RailofMan\">{{cite book|last1=Goode|first1=C.T.|title=The Railways of Manchester|date=1986|isbn=0-9508239-8-8|pages=19, 30\u201331}}</ref>\n\nThe station was named Victoria in 1843.

The headquarters of the L&YR were based alongside Victoria.{{sfn|Wray|2004|p=21}}\n[[File:Manchester Victoria & Exchange Stations geograph-2169556-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|left|Platforms 11 (left) and 12 (right), looking west towards {{stnlnk|Manchester Exchange}} in 1964]]\n\n===Expansion===\nBy the mid-1840s six railway companies operated from the station connecting Manchester to London, [[Glasgow]], [[Liverpool]], [[Leeds]] and [[Sheffield]]. Victoria Station dominated the Long Millgate area and was one of the biggest passenger stations in Britain.\n\nVictoria underwent several phases of expansion as traffic grew. In 1865, four bay platforms were built on the eastern side on land reclaimed from the cemetery, and another was built on the western side, a second through platform was built at the northern side, and the station's facilities were expanded by the construction of a new east wing of the station building.{{sfn|Wray|2004|pp=30-33}} Two decades later, the L&YR purchased the workhouse north of the station and its site was used to build another bay and five through platforms which came into use in 1884.{{sfn|Wray|2004|pp=36-41}} That same year, the LNWR opened its own station, {{rws|Manchester Exchange}} immediately to the west on the opposite side of the [[River Irwell]], and vacated Victoria.{{sfn|Wray|2004|pp=59-62}}\n[[File:Manchester Victoria, 1968 - geograph.org.uk - 1610488.jpg|thumb|The station's bay platforms 6-10 in 1968, only the two on the right still exist.]]\n[[File:Manchester Victoria station 19-10-2009 12-20-16.JPG|thumb|right|Overlooking the station concourse in 2012 before re-development in 2014.]]\nVictoria reached its maximum extent of 17 platforms in 1904 when the station was enlarged with extra bay platforms to the south. The present station fa\u00e7ade, designed by William Dawes, was built in 1909.{{sfn|Wray|2004|pp=73-91}} The cast-iron [[train shed]]s behind the fa\u00e7ade were {{convert|700|yd|m|-1}} long.\n\nBecause the station handled large amounts of parcel and newspaper traffic, an overhead parcels carrier system was constructed in 1895. It consisted of an electrically powered trolley suspended from an overhead track operated by an airborne attendant. A large basket could be raised and lowered from the trolley to distribute parcels and newspapers across the station. The system operated until 1940.{{sfn|Wray|2004|pp=64-72}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Parcel carrier, 1912 |url=https://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10443986 |website=Science and Society |accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe L&YR merged with the LNWR on 1 January 1922. A year later, the merged company became the largest constituent of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] (LMS). From 16 April 1929, Victoria and Exchange station were linked by the westward extension of platform 11 over the Irwell bridge, known as platform \"11 Middle\", which joined to Exchange's platform 3 to create Europe's longest platform at {{convert|2238|ft|m}}. Crossovers enabled it to accommodate three trains arriving and departing independently.<ref>Joyce, J.

As a result, the stations were linked by the [[Manchester Metrolink]] system which opened in 1992.

Between 1992 and 1994, the [[Manchester Arena]] was built over the northern part of the station site. Three of the five through tracks between platforms 11 and 12 were removed, along with platforms 12-17. The station was reduced to four through tracks and four through platforms, three of which were built to replace the removed platforms 12-14. They are covered by the Arena which was joined to the station by means of a raft above them. The Arena is accessed via stairs on Hunts Bank and from the station concourse. Following reconstruction, the platforms were renumbered; platforms 1 and 2 are bay platforms facing east (formerly platforms 9 and 10), and the through platforms are 3 to 6 (platform 3 was formerly platform 11).

Reinstatement of the south and west curve at [[Todmorden]] on the [[Caldervale Line]] facilitated a direct service between Victoria and [[Burnley Manchester Road]] Station for the first time in almost fifty years.\n\n===Electrification===\nIn the 1900s the [[Bury Line]], a busy commuter line which served the suburbs of north Manchester from Victoria, was losing passengers to [[Manchester Corporation Tramways|tramway competition]], in response to this, in 1914 the L&YR decided to [[Railway electrification in Great Britain|electrify]] this line using a unique 1,200 volt side-contact [[third rail]] system, in an effort to win back passengers. Electrification of this route was completed in 1916. As the scheme was a success, in the early 1920s the L&YR drew up plans to extend electrification to the [[Oldham Loop Line]] using the same system. The scheme progressed to an advanced stage, however with the reorganisations of railway companies in the 1920s, the new management had no interest in pursuing the scheme and it was dropped. This meant that the Bury Line remained as the only electrified line into Victoria, and it remained as such until 1991 when it was closed to be converted into part of the Metrolink system.{{sfn|Wray|2004|pp=103-105}}\n\nNo further electrification came to Victoria until the 21st century, when as part of [[Network Rail]]'s [[Northern Hub]] scheme, overhead electric wires have been erected to Victoria from [[Liverpool-Manchester lines|Manchester to Liverpool]] in 2015,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/News-Releases/Better-rail-services-become-a-reality-between-Liverpool-Lime-Street-and-Manchester-Airport-station-22b0.aspx |title=Better rail services become a reality between Liverpool Lime Street and Manchester Airport station |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=5 March 2015 |website=Network Rail Media Centre |publisher=Network Rail |access-date=5 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150309092746/http://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/News-Releases/Better-rail-services-become-a-reality-between-Liverpool-Lime-Street-and-Manchester-Airport-station-22b0.aspx |archivedate=9 March 2015 }}</ref>  and [[Manchester to Preston Line|Manchester to Preston]] and through to [[Blackpool branch lines|Blackpool]] in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=First electric passenger trains finally entering service in Bolton |url=https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/17426252.first-electric-passenger-trains-finally-entering-service-in-bolton/ |publisher=The Bolton News |accessdate=7 August 2019 |date=12 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Layout==\nManchester Victoria has six railway platforms and the Metrolink stop has four (four platform faces on three tracks).

Sprague]] and [[Thomas Verity]], were together responsible for the majority \u2013 certainly more than 200 \u2013 of the theatres and variety palaces of the great building boom which took place in Britain between 1885 and 1915, peaking at the turn of the century.<ref>{{cite web | title = New venues and some older ones | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131209124145/http://thelondonseason.com/newvenues.htm | archive-date = 9 December 2013 | url = http://www.thelondonseason.com/newvenues.htm | website = thelondonseason.com | publisher = thelondonseason }}</ref> Crewe became known as one of the most dynamic architects of the 1890s-1900s, specialising entirely in theatres and later cinemas. He also designed the [[Alhambra-Maurice Chevalier|Paris Alhambra]] for [[Thomas Barrasford]], which opened in 1904.\n\nCrewe trained in [[Paris]] and [[London]], where, as a young man, he was a frequent visitor to Frank Matcham's home. Up to the mid-1890s, Crewe collaborated with Sprague, producing the Lincoln Theatre Royal as well as a number of theatres around London. It was after he branched out on his own that he developed what was to become his characteristic Baroque-influenced style. His work around the turn of the century was marked by horizontal balconies tied to ranges of stage boxes and elaborate ornamental features.<ref>{{cite web | title = Theatreland: Architects - Bertie Crewe (d. 1937) | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071202131222/http://corpoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/lma_learning/theatreland/text.asp?ID=334 | archive-date = 2 December 2007 | url = http://www.corpoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/lma_learning/theatreland/text.asp?ID=334 | website = corpoflondon.gov.uk | publisher = London Metropolitan Archives: Learning Zone }}</ref> [[Cecil Masey]] trained in Crewe's office, working on large theatres and music halls that Crewe designed before the [[First World War]]. Masey's designs include the theatre at [[Stanford Hall, Nottinghamshire]]. In the early 1930s Masey worked for [[Sidney Bernstein, Baron Bernstein|Sidney Bernstein]] on the creation of the Granada cinema circuit, including the Tooting Granada.\n\nCrewe's last project, jointly with Henry G. Kay was the Regal, Kennington Road (opened 17 November 1937) by the Arthur O'Connor circuit. Designed as split theatre-cinema, the Edwardian Kennington Empire would have been in decline by the time of building.<ref>{{cite web | title = GALLERY- October 2004 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081015175359/http://merciacinema.org/gallery1004.htm | archive-date = 15 October 2008 | url = http://www.merciacinema.org.uk/gallery1004.htm | website = merciacinema.org.uk | publisher = Mercia Cinema | date = October 2004 }}</ref>\n\n==After death==\nAfter [[World War II]], many theatres that were not destroyed by bombing were in the way of redevelopment. The building boom of 1885 to 1915 was matched between 1950 and 1975 by theatre demolition. In that 25-year period, 35 theatres were demolished in [[Greater London]] alone.\n\nCrewe's reputation has been re-established over the last 20 years. In 2004, the [[Palace Theatre, Redditch]], (built 1913) completed a \u00a33.7&nbsp;million facelift. A now rare example of Edwardian theatre, it was successful in bidding for a Heritage Lottery Fund grant.

Sprague]] and [[Thomas Verity]], were together responsible for the majority \u2013 certainly more than 200 \u2013 of the theatres and variety palaces of the great building boom which took place in Britain between 1885 and 1915, peaking at the turn of the century.<ref>{{cite web | title = New venues and some older ones | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131209124145/http://thelondonseason.com/newvenues.htm | archive-date = 9 December 2013 | url = http://www.thelondonseason.com/newvenues.htm | website = thelondonseason.com | publisher = thelondonseason }}</ref> Crewe became known as one of the most dynamic architects of the 1890s-1900s, specialising entirely in theatres and later cinemas. He also designed the [[Alhambra-Maurice Chevalier|Paris Alhambra]] for [[Thomas Barrasford]], which opened in 1904.\n\nCrewe trained in [[Paris]] and [[London]], where, as a young man, he was a frequent visitor to Frank Matcham's home. Up to the mid-1890s, Crewe collaborated with Sprague, producing the Lincoln Theatre Royal as well as a number of theatres around London. It was after he branched out on his own that he developed what was to become his characteristic Baroque-influenced style. His work around the turn of the century was marked by horizontal balconies tied to ranges of stage boxes and elaborate ornamental features.<ref>{{cite web | title = Theatreland: Architects - Bertie Crewe (d. 1937) | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071202131222/http://corpoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/lma_learning/theatreland/text.asp?ID=334 | archive-date = 2 December 2007 | url = http://www.corpoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/lma_learning/theatreland/text.asp?ID=334 | website = corpoflondon.gov.uk | publisher = London Metropolitan Archives: Learning Zone }}</ref> [[Cecil Masey]] trained in Crewe's office, working on large theatres and music halls that Crewe designed before the [[First World War]]. Masey's designs include the theatre at [[Stanford Hall, Nottinghamshire]]. In the early 1930s Masey worked for [[Sidney Bernstein, Baron Bernstein|Sidney Bernstein]] on the creation of the Granada cinema circuit, including the Tooting Granada.\n\nCrewe's last project, jointly with Henry G. Kay was the Regal, Kennington Road (opened 17 November 1937) by the Arthur O'Connor circuit. Designed as split theatre-cinema, the Edwardian Kennington Empire would have been in decline by the time of building.<ref>{{cite web | title = GALLERY- October 2004 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081015175359/http://merciacinema.org/gallery1004.htm | archive-date = 15 October 2008 | url = http://www.merciacinema.org.uk/gallery1004.htm | website = merciacinema.org.uk | publisher = Mercia Cinema | date = October 2004 }}</ref>\n\n==After death==\nAfter [[World War II]], many theatres that were not destroyed by bombing were in the way of redevelopment. The building boom of 1885 to 1915 was matched between 1950 and 1975 by theatre demolition. In that 25-year period, 35 theatres were demolished in [[Greater London]] alone.\n\nCrewe's reputation has been re-established over the last 20 years. In 2004, the [[Palace Theatre, Redditch]], (built 1913) completed a \u00a33.7&nbsp;million facelift. A now rare example of Edwardian theatre, it was successful in bidding for a Heritage Lottery Fund grant.
