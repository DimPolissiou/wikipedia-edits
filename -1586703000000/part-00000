The club currently competes in {{English football updater 2|{{English football updater|HartlepU}}}}. They were founded in 1908 as '''Hartlepools United Football Athletic Company'''. One of English football's most famous managers [[Brian Clough]] began his managerial career at the club in 1965. Hartlepool play their home games at [[Victoria Park, Hartlepool|Victoria Park]].\n\nThe club's honours include the [[FA Amateur Cup]] won in [[1904\u201305 in English football|1904\u201305]] by [[West Hartlepool F.C.]], who were dissolved in 1910, and its assets and liabilities were subsequently taken over by Hartlepool United.\n\nTheir main rivals are [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]]. The club's mascot, \"[[H'Angus|H'Angus the Monkey]]\", was elected mayor at the 2002 [[Hartlepool Borough Council election, 2002|Hartlepool Borough Council election]]. The club also receives vocal support from [[Sky Sports]] presenter [[Jeff Stelling]].\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nIn 1905, the amateur team [[West Hartlepool F.C.|West Hartlepool]] won the [[FA Amateur Cup]] which at the time was considered second only to the [[FA Cup]]. Partly as a result of this the opportunity for a professional team arose in 1908, when West Hartlepool [[Rugby Union|Rugby]] Club went bust leaving their stadium [[Victoria Park (Hartlepool)|Victoria Ground]] vacant.<ref>{{cite web | title=Destination Hartlepool - The Official Website for Tourism (Things to See & So) | work=Hartlepool Borough Council | url=http://www.destinationhartlepool.com/section_things_to_see_and_do.php?viewstyle=&area=Leisure+Activities&att=Hartlepool+United+FC | accessdate=17 May 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930122012/http://www.destinationhartlepool.com/section_things_to_see_and_do.php?viewstyle=&area=Leisure+Activities&att=Hartlepool+United+FC | archive-date=30 September 2007 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The stadium was bought and the current club was founded under the name '''Hartlepools United Football Athletic Company''' representing both the town of [[West Hartlepool]] and the original settlement of [[Hartlepool|Old Hartlepool]].<ref name=HU.Hist>{{cite web | title=Hartlepool United History \u2013 Part 1 - 1881 to 1945 : The Early Years | work=Hartlepool United FC & FLI Ltd | url=http://www.hartlepoolunited.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10326~72412,00.html | accessdate=17 May 2006 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe new team joined the professional North-Eastern league and West Hartlepool F.C. lost some of their players to the new professional side. West Hartlepool managed to continue for a few seasons however it was not long before they broke up leaving Hartlepools United as the only team in town.<ref name=HU.Hist />\n\nIn 1910, the club took over the assets and liabilities of [[West Hartlepool F.C.]] who had been dissolved that year. In 1920, [[the Football League]] formed a [[Football League Third Division|third division]]. This was based almost entirely in the south, as the new division was created by absorbing virtually the entire top division of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], with [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] the only northern representative. This was rectified the following season when a Third Division North was created, with Hartlepool as one of the founder members.<ref>{{cite web | title=Part 1 \u2013 In the Beginning ..

His reaction was ''\"I don't fancy the place\"'', but he took the job anyway.<ref>The Sunday Times (London) 3 January 1993, Sunday Hartlepool's finest hour</ref>\n\nIn 1968 the \"s\" and the \"United\" were dropped from the team name of \"Hartlepools United\". This was in connection with West Hartlepool being absorbed along with the old smaller town of Hartlepool and the village of Hart into one new borough named \"Hartlepool\". The appendage of \"United\" was restored in 1977.<ref>When Saturday Comes: The Half Decent Football Book By Tim Bradford</ref>\n\nUnder [[Len Ashurst]] (who became manager in 1971), the team slowly began to revive after years of largely indifferent form. The [[1971\u201372 in English football|1971\u201372]] season saw a welcome improvement to 18th, and possibly saved the club; [[Barrow A.F.C.|Barrow]], who had finished bottom the previous year, were voted out in favour of [[Hereford United]] despite having improved to 22nd. The club once again avoided the re-election zone in [[1972\u201373 in English football|1972\u201373]], finishing in 20th place, but with four successive finishes either in or not far above the bottom four and strong challenges coming from non-league sides, the club needed to show signs of improvement. Ashurst did precisely that, finishing in 11th in [[1973\u201374 in English football|1973\u201374]]; he then left the club to manage [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]].\n\n[[Ken Hale (footballer)|Ken Hale]] took over and guided the team to 13th and 14th over the next two seasons and also reached the League Cup Fourth round in [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375]] (still a club record). However, [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377]] saw a return to the doldrums; Hale was sacked after failing to win any of the first nine games (including two cup matches) at the start of October. His successor Billy Horner could not stop the rot either, and the team finished in 22nd place. Again there was a strong challenger from non-league in the form of [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]; however, as the club was seeking re-election for the first time in six years, it was [[Workington A.F.C.|Workington]] \u2013 bottom for a second successive year and making their fourth consecutive re-election application that made way. Over the close season the team's name was changed to its current form of Hartlepool United. A tragedy struck the club a few weeks before the end of the season when 20-year-old player [[Dave Wiggett]] was killed in a car crash.<ref>[http://cards.littleoak.com.au/rip_notices/rip_1970.html Nigel's WebSpace \u2013 English Football Cards, Player death notices]. Cards.littleoak.com.au.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hartlepool United FC League Performance.svg|thumb|300px|right|Chart of yearly table positions of Hartlepool in the Football League.]]A marginal improvement to 21st the following year again saw the club applying to stay in the league; and again a strong non-league challenge, this time from [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], was enough to dispose of [[Southport F.C.|Southport]]. It seemed to be only a matter of time before Hartlepool United followed the same way.\n\nOnce again then, it was a huge relief for the supporters that Horner managed to make considerable improvements the following season. A large part of this was due to the strike partnership of [[Bob Newton (footballer, born 1956)|Bob Newton]] and [[Keith Houchen]]; the latter would be the club's leading scorer in each of the following four seasons. There was also relative success in the FA Cup, with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] being defeated at the Victoria Ground thanks to two goals from Newton as the club made the Fourth round.\n\n[[1978\u201379 in English football|1978\u201379]] saw a finish in 13th place; 19th the following season was still enough to stay clear of the re-election zone, and then [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]] saw the team produce its best season in over a decade, never being out of the top 10 and looking promotion contenders for a long spell before falling away to finish ninth. [[Keith Houchen]] was top scorer with 17 league goals, with Newton also making double figures.\n\nFinancial issues were however making waves off the pitch and in particular the ownership of the ground. The Town Council were approached by the club with a view to buying the ground in January 1977, and although this was initially turned down negotiations continued. In February 1978, a deal seemed to have been agreed; however chairman Vince Barker accused the council of delaying the deal when it was not complete 12 months later. Barker would accuse the council of trying to renege on the deal in July 1980, and even threatened to move the club out of the town amidst rumours that he was prepared to sell up and allow the club to be moved to [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]]. As of February 2007, the ground remains in Council ownership.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hufc-80s.jpg|left|thumb|120px|Club logo in the 1980s]] -->\n\n[[1981\u201382 in English football|1981\u201382]] saw the team finish in 14th place despite both Houchen and Newton scoring 18 goals, but their partnership was drawing to a close and with it four seasons of relative success. The club was running into financial difficulties under Vince Barker, and both forwards would be sold the following season for fees that failed to reflect their value to the club but allowed bills to be paid. The team suffered, and finished in 22nd \u2013 back in the re-election zone. Billy Horner handed over his duties at the end of March to [[John Duncan (footballer)|John Duncan]].\n\nDuncan's time at the club was limited. Having been appointed on 1 April, just nine weeks later he left to take over at [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]]. Hartlepool appointed [[Mick Docherty]], son of the legendary [[Tommy Docherty]]; however after six months and with the team struggling, he too left the club. Even for Hartlepool, four managers in the space of eight months was somewhat farcical; the fact that the decision was made to re-appoint Billy Horner (initially as a temporary measure, although he would actually remain in charge until November 1986) made the situation even worse.\n\nDissatisfaction with the club's board grew; attendances fell; performances remained poor. An eventual finish of 23rd, and a club record low attendance of 790 for the game with [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] on 5 May 1984, showed a club that looked to be going nowhere. The application for re-election was again successful, with the club once more polling the lowest figure of the League clubs, the result was secured on the back of an agreement being made amongst the club chairmen to enter into meaningful dialogue over direct promotion and relegation with the Alliance Premier League. Many felt that without that agreement being made, Hartlepool United would have been voted out because of their perennial re-election applications. [[Maidstone_United_F.C._(1897)|Maidstone United]] were the unfortunate non-league champions to have the Football League door slammed in their faces for the second year running. During the close season chairman Barker left the club, John Smart taking over.\n\nOnce again though Horner managed to produce an improvement, to 19th, before making a team that looked capable of winning promotion. After a shaky start to [[1985\u201386 in English football|1985\u201386]], the team climbed into the top three by mid-October; were still in a promotion spot in early March; and eventually faded slightly to finish in seventh place.\n\nAny hopes that Horner might lead the club to promotion faded shortly after the start of the [[1986\u201387 in English football|1986\u201387]] season. After drawing the first four games of the season, Pools then lost the next four before finally recording their first win against [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] in the ninth game; a further six games without a win were enough to see the club looking in serious danger of being the first club to be automatically relegated from the Football League and saw Horner depart. He was replaced by [[John Bird (footballer, born 1948)|John Bird]], a former player at the club. Form improved slightly, but although the team eventually finished in relative safety in 18th, they were only three points ahead of Lincoln City who suffered relegation.\n\nOne peculiarity of the season concerned [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]; the financially struggling [[Teesside]]rs had been locked out of their ground [[Ayresome Park]], but were due to play a home game on the opening day of the season. Had they not fulfilled the fixture they would have been expelled from the League; Hartlepool stepped into the breach and offered the use of the Victoria Ground. After Hartlepool's draw with [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in the afternoon, Middlesbrough played their game with [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] the same evening. Days later the two clubs met in the League Cup \u2013 as of the 2010\u201311 season, the two legged tie remains the only occasion the teams have met in a senior competition.\n\nThe following season saw an improvement to 16th place, this time comfortably above relegated [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] and in fact only 11 points from the playoff places; however a poor run of form towards the end of the season (four points from the last 10 games) cost the team any hope of promotion. Notable events from the season included both [[Paul Baker (footballer)|Paul Baker]] and Andy Toman scoring 20 or more goals in all competitions, and beating neighbours [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the [[Associate Members Cup]].\n\nBird had however made something of a name for himself as a manager, and when early season form saw Hartlepool United in second place at the end of September 1988, he left the club to join [[York City F.C.|York City]]. Former [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] captain [[Bobby Moncur]] was appointed to succeed Bird, but failed to inspire the team; results suffered, and the eventual finishing position of 19th could even have been worse with the team as low as 22nd late in the season.\n\nHis period in charge continued to be little short of a disaster. Five successive league defeats opened the [[1989\u201390 in English football|1989\u201390]] season, and Moncur eventually resigned in November with the club rooted to the bottom of the table having taken just nine points from 18 games with 46 goals conceded. New chairman Garry Gibson had initially turned down Moncur's request, but accepted it at the second time of asking.\n\n===Subsequent success===\nThe new manager appointed though would become a legend at the club. [[Cyril Knowles]] had been a distinguished player, and had a growing reputation as a manager; with the addition of several new signings, he achieved a remarkable turnaround. From having 9 points from 19 games, Knowles lead the side to 55 by the end of the season \u2013 and a safe 19th place in the table.\n\nEven better was to follow the next season. With the partnership of Paul Baker and [[Joe Allon]] working well in attack, the team were in the top 10 for much of the season and in with a good chance of reaching a playoff place. Then, tragedy struck in February 1991 when Knowles was diagnosed with brain cancer and [[Alan Murray (footballer)|Alan Murray]] took over on a temporary basis. Under Murray, the team's form improved further and the club went into the final day of the season as one of several clubs that could win not just promotion but the title. A 3\u20131 win over [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] was enough to secure promotion in third place; Allon scored 35 goals, and Baker and [[Paul Dalton]] also reached double figures.\n\nHowever, Knowles was still suffering from cancer and in June 1991 Murray was given the manager's job on a permanent basis as Knowles had now undergone three operations but still had the cancer. He died on 30 August 1991, aged only 47.\n\nAlthough Allon signed for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] over the close season, Murray was able to retain the majority of the squad, and also signed players such as [[Andy Saville]] and [[Lenny Johnrose]] as the club finished in a highly respectable 11th in the Third Division.\n\n[[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393]] saw the club playing the new Division Two, as the formation of the [[Premier League]] caused a re-labelling of the divisions. With Murray having brought in players such as [[Dean Emerson]], John Gallacher and Ryan Cross the club got off to a great start \u2013 by October, the team was in second place, level on points with leaders [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].\n\nThe club remained in the playoff hunt until New Year, and then achieved one of the best results in its history when beating [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] 1\u20130 in the FA Cup Third round \u2013 the first time that Hartlepool had beaten a top division side. However, this would prove to be the end of the club's success for several years. It was revealed shortly after the cup win that the club were in financial difficulties. To make ends meet, a number of players were released or sold, and the club set an unenviable record by going 1,227 minutes without scoring. During this run Murray was sacked and replaced by [[Viv Busby]]. The club eventually escaped relegation, finishing 16th.\n\nThe following season was an unmitigated disaster. With no money to bring in players, the team struggled all season. Busby was replaced in November 1993 by John MacPhail, but he could do little as the team remained in the relegation places from November until the end of the season. Relegation was assured following a 7\u20130 defeat at [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]]; the final day of the season saw the team thrashed 8\u20131 by [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] at the Victoria Ground.\n\nThe next five seasons saw constant struggle and a succession of managers. Gibson finally sold the club to local businessman Harold Hornsey, who at least was able to financially stabilise the club; but with little money available for players times were hard. MacPhail left early in [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]] and was replaced by [[David McCreery|Dave McCreery]]; he was replaced towards the end of the same season by Keith Houchen, who had returned as a player. Houchen was in turn replaced after 18 months by Mick Tait. Meanwhile, the club finished in 18th, 20th (twice) and 17th. There was also a change of ownership in 1997: Hornsey sold the club to an IOR Ltd, with [[Ken Hodcroft]] becoming chairman.\n\nMatters came to a head in [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]]; Tait's side were struggling, and even the signing of former England international [[Peter Beardsley]] had not changed the club's fortunes. Tait was sacked in January 1999, and [[Chris Turner (footballer born 1958)|Chris Turner]] was appointed; despite being four points adrift at the bottom of the League at Easter, Turner was able to prevent the club being relegated.\nUnder Turner, matters improved drastically. In 1999\u20132000 they reached the play-offs, but were beaten by local rivals Darlington in the semi-finals. In fact qualified for the play-offs for next two seasons as well \u2013 though on both occasions they were again defeated in the semi-finals.\n\nIn [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303]], they finished in second place and won automatic promotion to the Football League Second Division once more. Turner had however left to take over [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] part way through the season; [[Mike Newell (footballer)|Mike Newell]] replaced him but was surprisingly released over the close season, [[Neale Cooper]] taking over.\n\nAfter an exceptional campaign in [[2003\u201304 in English football|2003\u201304]], which included an 8\u20131 victory over [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]], they finished sixth and made the play-offs. However, they lost to third placed [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] after two games after holding them to a draw on the first leg. This season also saw [[Eifion Williams]] called up to the [[Wales national football team|Wales]] squad and looked set to become only the second Hartlepool player ever to win an international cap while at the club; however an unfortunate injury in the play-off second leg forced him to withdraw.\n\nThe club finished sixth in the league again in the [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]] season, despite the shock departure of Cooper just before the end of the season after an apparent fall-out with Ken Hodcroft. In the play-off semi-final, they defeated [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] 6\u20135 on penalties after the sides had each won their home leg 2\u20130. The club failed to win promotion, losing 4\u20132 to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] after extra time. Hartlepool had been leading 2\u20131 with eight minutes of regular time to go, but a controversial penalty decision in the 82nd minute, which also saw Chris Westwood sent off, allowed Sheffield Wednesday to level the scores making it 2\u20132 at the end of 90 minutes. Hartlepool missing a key defender struggled in extra time and conceded two goals. Following this achievement Cooper's assistant Martin Scott was appointed as manager.\n\nThe 2005\u201306 season saw the side slip down the division to the relegation places helped in part by poor management, an indecisive board room and key player injuries. Manager Martin Scott was suspended after an alleged fight with a player in the changing rooms, which resulted in his dismissal. Youth team coach [[Paul Stephenson (footballer)|Paul Stephenson]] was put in charge until the end of the season, aided by former manager Chris Turner who returned to the club as Director of Sport, and despite remaining undefeated in his first five games in charge, he could not prevent the club being relegated into the fourth tier in May 2006. Some felt that Hartlepool's relegation was unfair given that [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] had escaped administration, and therefore a 10-point deduction and relegation, by delaying a CVA meeting until after the season had ended.\n\nOn 13 June 2006, [[Danny Wilson (footballer, born 1960)|Danny Wilson]] was appointed manager. Wilson was unable to save fellow strugglers [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|MK Dons]] from relegation to League Two at the end of the 2005\u201306 season, and he was sacked on 10 May 2006. On 1 January 2007, Hartlepool United equalled the all-time [[The Football League|Football League]] record of consecutive wins without conceding a goal. The 1\u20130 win at [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield Town]] was the eighth straight win without conceding. The record was also held by [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] and [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]. However, the record was then broken by [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] on 3 March 2007 when they recorded their ninth successive win without conceding. The club went on to complete a 23-match unbeaten run which finally ended against the team they last lost to, [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]].\n\nHartlepool returned to [[Football League One|League One]] at the first time of asking, finishing second behind champions [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]]. Pools missed out on the title on the final day after losing 2\u20131 at home to [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] whilst Walsall drew 1\u20131 at [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], whom were also promoted in third place. This was the club's second promotion in four years. They maintained their League One status for a second successive season by finishing 15th in [[2007\u201308 in English football|2007\u201308]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/default.stm |title=BBC News |publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2008, Danny Wilson was sacked; while the club were unbeaten in four games and well clear of the relegation zone, the board felt that Wilson could take the club no further. Chris Turner was quickly returned to the managerial position, combining the role with his existing position as the club's Director of Sport. Pools went into the final round of fixtures with a three-point cushion and six goal buffer over rivals [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]], but were beaten 4\u20131 by Bristol Rovers while Carlisle beat [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] 2\u20130, but both clubs survived after [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] lost 3\u20130 at [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].\n\nHartlepool started the [[2009\u201310 in English football|2009\u201310]] season well, and were in the hunt for a play-off spot early in the season. However, after a 5\u20130 home defeat at the hands of [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]], their form dipped, and the club were dropped into a relegation battle, with matters not helped by a three-point deduction for fielding an ineligible player during a victory over [[Brighton and Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton and Hove Albion]]. The club survived on the final day of the season with a 0\u20130 against [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] being enough to keep them in League One, albeit on goal difference alone after [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] lost 3\u20130 at [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], a result which sent the Gills down instead. Despite the shaky end to the season, survival did mark a milestone for the club, as it marked the first time that they would be playing a fourth consecutive season outside of the League's lowest tier.\n\nChris Turner resigned from the club a few weeks into the following season and [[Mick Wadsworth]] took over on a temporary basis, before being appointed permanently a month later. The season ended up going much the same as the previous one, with the club in play-off contention in the middle of the campaign before falling away as the season went on. However, the drop in Hartlepool's form was not as severe as it had been in the previous two seasons, and they finished in 16th place, well clear of the relegation zone. Despite suffering a 5\u20130 hammering at home to newly relegated Sheffield Wednesday and a 4\u20130 home loss to northern rivals Carlisle, Pools did enjoy 2\u20130 home victories against newly relegated [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] and [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], in addition to a 3\u20131 victory at home to eventual champions [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]].\n\nThe club started the following season well, and were among the front-runners early on, but a bad run of form resulted in the sacking of Wadsworth in December, with former manager [[Neale Cooper]] returning to the club as his replacement. While Cooper was not able to get the club back to their early form, the side stayed generally consistent for the remainder of the season and secured a 13th-place finish, the highest the club had achieved since the play-off campaign in 2005.\n\n===Decline into non-League football===\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hartlepool United FC.png|thumb|left|120px|Club logo 1995-2017; alluded to the town's maritime traditions, and was changed with new ownership in 2017]] -->\n\nHartlepool made a terrible start to the following season,{{when|date=December 2019}} and in the wake of a defeat by bottom-placed [[Bury F.C.|Bury]], which saw the [[Lancashire]] club overhaul Hartlepool and dump them to the bottom of the table, Cooper resigned, bringing an end to his second spell after less than a year. He was replaced by [[John Hughes (footballer born 1964)|John Hughes]], and while the club's form gradually improved, they were ultimately unable to overcome an appalling first half of the season, which saw them secure a paltry 9 points and just one win from their first 23 games. Hartlepool finished second-bottom, only avoiding last place because of [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] being deducted ten points for entering administration, and Hughes was sacked for failing to prevent the club's relegation, with [[Colin Cooper]] replacing him.\n\nAfter an extensive overhaul of the playing squad during the summer, Hartlepool recovered from a poor start to the 2013\u201314 season and by early spring they were making decent progress and looking to make a late play-off bid. However, a terrible run of form late in the season plunged them into the relegation battle, which they did not earn definite safety from until the penultimate match of the season. The club finished 19th that season, their lowest finish in 15 years. An even worse start to the 2014\u201315 season resulted in Cooper resigning a few weeks into the campaign. [[Paul Murray (footballer)|Paul Murray]] replaced Cooper, only to be sacked just two months later, with the club six points adrift at the bottom of League Two, and having just suffered an FA Cup elimination at the hands of non-league [[Blyth Spartans A.F.C.|Blyth Spartans]]. By now the fans had turned against Ken Hodcroft, who resigned and sold the club to Peter Harris in December 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hartlepoolunited.co.uk/news/article/hartlepool-united-chairman-peter-harris-on-takeover-2150317.aspx|title=Hartlepool United Chairman Peter Harris on Takeover|last=HUFC|website=www.hartlepoolunited.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-05-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231215121/http://www.hartlepoolunited.co.uk/news/article/hartlepool-united-chairman-peter-harris-on-takeover-2150317.aspx|archive-date=31 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Harris's first decision was to appoint former Tranmere Rovers manager [[Ronnie Moore]] to the managers' job.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30479722|title=Ronnie Moore: Hartlepool United appoint ex-Rotherham manager|date=2014-12-16|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2017-05-24|language=en-GB}}</ref> The takeover ultimately fell through due to Harris and his associates being involved in dubious activities<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/news/14833525.Former_Swindon_Town_general_manager_faces_fraud_trial/|title=Former Swindon Town general manager faces fraud trial|website=Swindon Advertiser|language=en|access-date=2017-05-24}}</ref> with the club reverting to Hodcroft's ownership, Moore's appointment would prove to be a critical one, and after being ten points adrift in bottom place at the turn of the year a revival in form saw them escape the relegation places and secure survival in the penultimate game of the season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/news/pools-fans-still-on-cloud-nine-after-hartlepool-s-great-escape-1-7230409|title=Pools fans still on cloud nine after Hartlepool's Great Escape|website=www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-05-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318055108/https://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/news/pools-fans-still-on-cloud-nine-after-hartlepool-s-great-escape-1-7230409|archive-date=18 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> After a 16th\u2013place finish in [[2015\u201316 Football League Two|2015\u201316]], Hartlepool were relegated to the [[National League (English football)|National League]] at the end of the [[2016\u201317 EFL League Two|2016\u201317]] season after finishing 23rd in League Two.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/news/hartlepool-united-relegated-from-the-football-league-for-the-first-time-in-their-history-1-8530679|title=Hartlepool United relegated from the Football League for the first time in their history|website=www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-05-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611190217/http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/news/hartlepool-united-relegated-from-the-football-league-for-the-first-time-in-their-history-1-8530679|archive-date=11 June 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Hartlepool was sold to [[Raj Singh (businessman)|Raj Singh]], narrowly avoiding liquidation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11339844/raj-singh-completes-hartlepool-united-takeover|title=Raj Singh completes Hartlepool United takeover|publisher=Sky Sports|language=en|access-date=2017-05-03}}</ref>\n\n==Sponsorship==\n[[O'Neill's]] currently manufactures the club's apparel.

The club currently competes in {{English football updater 2|{{English football updater|HartlepU}}}}. They were founded in 1908 as '''Hartlepools United Football Athletic Company'''. One of English football's most famous managers [[Brian Clough]] began his managerial career at the club in 1965. Hartlepool play their home games at [[Victoria Park, Hartlepool|Victoria Park]].\n\nThe club's honours include the [[FA Amateur Cup]] won in [[1904\u201305 in English football|1904\u201305]] by [[West Hartlepool F.C.]], who were dissolved in 1910, and its assets and liabilities were subsequently taken over by Hartlepool United.\n\nTheir main rivals are [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]]. The club's mascot, \"[[H'Angus|H'Angus the Monkey]]\", was elected mayor at the 2002 [[Hartlepool Borough Council election, 2002|Hartlepool Borough Council election]]. The club also receives vocal support from [[Sky Sports]] presenter [[Jeff Stelling]].\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nIn 1905, the amateur team [[West Hartlepool F.C.|West Hartlepool]] won the [[FA Amateur Cup]] which at the time was considered second only to the [[FA Cup]]. Partly as a result of this the opportunity for a professional team arose in 1908, when West Hartlepool [[Rugby Union|Rugby]] Club went bust leaving their stadium [[Victoria Park (Hartlepool)|Victoria Ground]] vacant.<ref>{{cite web | title=Destination Hartlepool - The Official Website for Tourism (Things to See & So) | work=Hartlepool Borough Council | url=http://www.destinationhartlepool.com/section_things_to_see_and_do.php?viewstyle=&area=Leisure+Activities&att=Hartlepool+United+FC | accessdate=17 May 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930122012/http://www.destinationhartlepool.com/section_things_to_see_and_do.php?viewstyle=&area=Leisure+Activities&att=Hartlepool+United+FC | archive-date=30 September 2007 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The stadium was bought and the current club was founded under the name '''Hartlepools United Football Athletic Company''' representing both the town of [[West Hartlepool]] and the original settlement of [[Hartlepool|Old Hartlepool]].<ref name=HU.Hist>{{cite web | title=Hartlepool United History \u2013 Part 1 - 1881 to 1945 : The Early Years | work=Hartlepool United FC & FLI Ltd | url=http://www.hartlepoolunited.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10326~72412,00.html | accessdate=17 May 2006 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe new team joined the professional North-Eastern league and West Hartlepool F.C. lost some of their players to the new professional side. West Hartlepool managed to continue for a few seasons however it was not long before they broke up leaving Hartlepools United as the only team in town.<ref name=HU.Hist />\n\nIn 1910, the club took over the assets and liabilities of [[West Hartlepool F.C.]] who had been dissolved that year. In 1920, [[the Football League]] formed a [[Football League Third Division|third division]]. This was based almost entirely in the south, as the new division was created by absorbing virtually the entire top division of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], with [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] the only northern representative. This was rectified the following season when a Third Division North was created, with Hartlepool as one of the founder members.<ref>{{cite web | title=Part 1 \u2013 In the Beginning ..

His reaction was ''\"I don't fancy the place\"'', but he took the job anyway.<ref>The Sunday Times (London) 3 January 1993, Sunday Hartlepool's finest hour</ref>\n\nIn 1968 the \"s\" and the \"United\" were dropped from the team name of \"Hartlepools United\". This was in connection with West Hartlepool being absorbed along with the old smaller town of Hartlepool and the village of Hart into one new borough named \"Hartlepool\". The appendage of \"United\" was restored in 1977.<ref>When Saturday Comes: The Half Decent Football Book By Tim Bradford</ref>\n\nUnder [[Len Ashurst]] (who became manager in 1971), the team slowly began to revive after years of largely indifferent form. The [[1971\u201372 in English football|1971\u201372]] season saw a welcome improvement to 18th, and possibly saved the club; [[Barrow A.F.C.|Barrow]], who had finished bottom the previous year, were voted out in favour of [[Hereford United]] despite having improved to 22nd. The club once again avoided the re-election zone in [[1972\u201373 in English football|1972\u201373]], finishing in 20th place, but with four successive finishes either in or not far above the bottom four and strong challenges coming from non-league sides, the club needed to show signs of improvement. Ashurst did precisely that, finishing in 11th in [[1973\u201374 in English football|1973\u201374]]; he then left the club to manage [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]].\n\n[[Ken Hale (footballer)|Ken Hale]] took over and guided the team to 13th and 14th over the next two seasons and also reached the League Cup Fourth round in [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375]] (still a club record). However, [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377]] saw a return to the doldrums; Hale was sacked after failing to win any of the first nine games (including two cup matches) at the start of October. His successor Billy Horner could not stop the rot either, and the team finished in 22nd place. Again there was a strong challenger from non-league in the form of [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]; however, as the club was seeking re-election for the first time in six years, it was [[Workington A.F.C.|Workington]] \u2013 bottom for a second successive year and making their fourth consecutive re-election application that made way. Over the close season the team's name was changed to its current form of Hartlepool United. A tragedy struck the club a few weeks before the end of the season when 20-year-old player [[Dave Wiggett]] was killed in a car crash.<ref>[http://cards.littleoak.com.au/rip_notices/rip_1970.html Nigel's WebSpace \u2013 English Football Cards, Player death notices]. Cards.littleoak.com.au.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hartlepool United FC League Performance.svg|thumb|300px|right|Chart of yearly table positions of Hartlepool in the Football League.]]A marginal improvement to 21st the following year again saw the club applying to stay in the league; and again a strong non-league challenge, this time from [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], was enough to dispose of [[Southport F.C.|Southport]]. It seemed to be only a matter of time before Hartlepool United followed the same way.\n\nOnce again then, it was a huge relief for the supporters that Horner managed to make considerable improvements the following season. A large part of this was due to the strike partnership of [[Bob Newton (footballer, born 1956)|Bob Newton]] and [[Keith Houchen]]; the latter would be the club's leading scorer in each of the following four seasons. There was also relative success in the FA Cup, with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] being defeated at the Victoria Ground thanks to two goals from Newton as the club made the Fourth round.\n\n[[1978\u201379 in English football|1978\u201379]] saw a finish in 13th place; 19th the following season was still enough to stay clear of the re-election zone, and then [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]] saw the team produce its best season in over a decade, never being out of the top 10 and looking promotion contenders for a long spell before falling away to finish ninth. [[Keith Houchen]] was top scorer with 17 league goals, with Newton also making double figures.\n\nFinancial issues were however making waves off the pitch and in particular the ownership of the ground. The Town Council were approached by the club with a view to buying the ground in January 1977, and although this was initially turned down negotiations continued. In February 1978, a deal seemed to have been agreed; however chairman Vince Barker accused the council of delaying the deal when it was not complete 12 months later. Barker would accuse the council of trying to renege on the deal in July 1980, and even threatened to move the club out of the town amidst rumours that he was prepared to sell up and allow the club to be moved to [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]]. As of February 2007, the ground remains in Council ownership.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hufc-80s.jpg|left|thumb|120px|Club logo in the 1980s]] -->\n\n[[1981\u201382 in English football|1981\u201382]] saw the team finish in 14th place despite both Houchen and Newton scoring 18 goals, but their partnership was drawing to a close and with it four seasons of relative success. The club was running into financial difficulties under Vince Barker, and both forwards would be sold the following season for fees that failed to reflect their value to the club but allowed bills to be paid. The team suffered, and finished in 22nd \u2013 back in the re-election zone. Billy Horner handed over his duties at the end of March to [[John Duncan (footballer)|John Duncan]].\n\nDuncan's time at the club was limited. Having been appointed on 1 April, just nine weeks later he left to take over at [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]]. Hartlepool appointed [[Mick Docherty]], son of the legendary [[Tommy Docherty]]; however after six months and with the team struggling, he too left the club. Even for Hartlepool, four managers in the space of eight months was somewhat farcical; the fact that the decision was made to re-appoint Billy Horner (initially as a temporary measure, although he would actually remain in charge until November 1986) made the situation even worse.\n\nDissatisfaction with the club's board grew; attendances fell; performances remained poor. An eventual finish of 23rd, and a club record low attendance of 790 for the game with [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] on 5 May 1984, showed a club that looked to be going nowhere. The application for re-election was again successful, with the club once more polling the lowest figure of the League clubs, the result was secured on the back of an agreement being made amongst the club chairmen to enter into meaningful dialogue over direct promotion and relegation with the Alliance Premier League. Many felt that without that agreement being made, Hartlepool United would have been voted out because of their perennial re-election applications. [[Maidstone_United_F.C._(1897)|Maidstone United]] were the unfortunate non-league champions to have the Football League door slammed in their faces for the second year running. During the close season chairman Barker left the club, John Smart taking over.\n\nOnce again though Horner managed to produce an improvement, to 19th, before making a team that looked capable of winning promotion. After a shaky start to [[1985\u201386 in English football|1985\u201386]], the team climbed into the top three by mid-October; were still in a promotion spot in early March; and eventually faded slightly to finish in seventh place.\n\nAny hopes that Horner might lead the club to promotion faded shortly after the start of the [[1986\u201387 in English football|1986\u201387]] season. After drawing the first four games of the season, Pools then lost the next four before finally recording their first win against [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] in the ninth game; a further six games without a win were enough to see the club looking in serious danger of being the first club to be automatically relegated from the Football League and saw Horner depart. He was replaced by [[John Bird (footballer, born 1948)|John Bird]], a former player at the club. Form improved slightly, but although the team eventually finished in relative safety in 18th, they were only three points ahead of Lincoln City who suffered relegation.\n\nOne peculiarity of the season concerned [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]; the financially struggling [[Teesside]]rs had been locked out of their ground [[Ayresome Park]], but were due to play a home game on the opening day of the season. Had they not fulfilled the fixture they would have been expelled from the League; Hartlepool stepped into the breach and offered the use of the Victoria Ground. After Hartlepool's draw with [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in the afternoon, Middlesbrough played their game with [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] the same evening. Days later the two clubs met in the League Cup \u2013 as of the 2010\u201311 season, the two legged tie remains the only occasion the teams have met in a senior competition.\n\nThe following season saw an improvement to 16th place, this time comfortably above relegated [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] and in fact only 11 points from the playoff places; however a poor run of form towards the end of the season (four points from the last 10 games) cost the team any hope of promotion. Notable events from the season included both [[Paul Baker (footballer)|Paul Baker]] and Andy Toman scoring 20 or more goals in all competitions, and beating neighbours [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the [[Associate Members Cup]].\n\nBird had however made something of a name for himself as a manager, and when early season form saw Hartlepool United in second place at the end of September 1988, he left the club to join [[York City F.C.|York City]]. Former [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] captain [[Bobby Moncur]] was appointed to succeed Bird, but failed to inspire the team; results suffered, and the eventual finishing position of 19th could even have been worse with the team as low as 22nd late in the season.\n\nHis period in charge continued to be little short of a disaster. Five successive league defeats opened the [[1989\u201390 in English football|1989\u201390]] season, and Moncur eventually resigned in November with the club rooted to the bottom of the table having taken just nine points from 18 games with 46 goals conceded. New chairman Garry Gibson had initially turned down Moncur's request, but accepted it at the second time of asking.\n\n===Subsequent success===\nThe new manager appointed though would become a legend at the club. [[Cyril Knowles]] had been a distinguished player, and had a growing reputation as a manager; with the addition of several new signings, he achieved a remarkable turnaround. From having 9 points from 19 games, Knowles lead the side to 55 by the end of the season \u2013 and a safe 19th place in the table.\n\nEven better was to follow the next season. With the partnership of Paul Baker and [[Joe Allon]] working well in attack, the team were in the top 10 for much of the season and in with a good chance of reaching a playoff place. Then, tragedy struck in February 1991 when Knowles was diagnosed with brain cancer and [[Alan Murray (footballer)|Alan Murray]] took over on a temporary basis. Under Murray, the team's form improved further and the club went into the final day of the season as one of several clubs that could win not just promotion but the title. A 3\u20131 win over [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] was enough to secure promotion in third place; Allon scored 35 goals, and Baker and [[Paul Dalton]] also reached double figures.\n\nHowever, Knowles was still suffering from cancer and in June 1991 Murray was given the manager's job on a permanent basis as Knowles had now undergone three operations but still had the cancer. He died on 30 August 1991, aged only 47.\n\nAlthough Allon signed for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] over the close season, Murray was able to retain the majority of the squad, and also signed players such as [[Andy Saville]] and [[Lenny Johnrose]] as the club finished in a highly respectable 11th in the Third Division.\n\n[[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393]] saw the club playing the new Division Two, as the formation of the [[Premier League]] caused a re-labelling of the divisions. With Murray having brought in players such as [[Dean Emerson]], John Gallacher and Ryan Cross the club got off to a great start \u2013 by October, the team was in second place, level on points with leaders [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].\n\nThe club remained in the playoff hunt until New Year, and then achieved one of the best results in its history when beating [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] 1\u20130 in the FA Cup Third round \u2013 the first time that Hartlepool had beaten a top division side. However, this would prove to be the end of the club's success for several years. It was revealed shortly after the cup win that the club were in financial difficulties. To make ends meet, a number of players were released or sold, and the club set an unenviable record by going 1,227 minutes without scoring. During this run Murray was sacked and replaced by [[Viv Busby]]. The club eventually escaped relegation, finishing 16th.\n\nThe following season was an unmitigated disaster. With no money to bring in players, the team struggled all season. Busby was replaced in November 1993 by John MacPhail, but he could do little as the team remained in the relegation places from November until the end of the season. Relegation was assured following a 7\u20130 defeat at [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]]; the final day of the season saw the team thrashed 8\u20131 by [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] at the Victoria Ground.\n\nThe next five seasons saw constant struggle and a succession of managers. Gibson finally sold the club to local businessman Harold Hornsey, who at least was able to financially stabilise the club; but with little money available for players times were hard. MacPhail left early in [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]] and was replaced by [[David McCreery|Dave McCreery]]; he was replaced towards the end of the same season by Keith Houchen, who had returned as a player. Houchen was in turn replaced after 18 months by Mick Tait. Meanwhile, the club finished in 18th, 20th (twice) and 17th. There was also a change of ownership in 1997: Hornsey sold the club to an IOR Ltd, with [[Ken Hodcroft]] becoming chairman.\n\nMatters came to a head in [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]]; Tait's side were struggling, and even the signing of former England international [[Peter Beardsley]] had not changed the club's fortunes. Tait was sacked in January 1999, and [[Chris Turner (footballer born 1958)|Chris Turner]] was appointed; despite being four points adrift at the bottom of the League at Easter, Turner was able to prevent the club being relegated.\nUnder Turner, matters improved drastically. In 1999\u20132000 they reached the play-offs, but were beaten by local rivals Darlington in the semi-finals. In fact qualified for the play-offs for next two seasons as well \u2013 though on both occasions they were again defeated in the semi-finals.\n\nIn [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303]], they finished in second place and won automatic promotion to the Football League Second Division once more. Turner had however left to take over [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] part way through the season; [[Mike Newell (footballer)|Mike Newell]] replaced him but was surprisingly released over the close season, [[Neale Cooper]] taking over.\n\nAfter an exceptional campaign in [[2003\u201304 in English football|2003\u201304]], which included an 8\u20131 victory over [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]], they finished sixth and made the play-offs. However, they lost to third placed [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] after two games after holding them to a draw on the first leg. This season also saw [[Eifion Williams]] called up to the [[Wales national football team|Wales]] squad and looked set to become only the second Hartlepool player ever to win an international cap while at the club; however an unfortunate injury in the play-off second leg forced him to withdraw.\n\nThe club finished sixth in the league again in the [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]] season, despite the shock departure of Cooper just before the end of the season after an apparent fall-out with Ken Hodcroft. In the play-off semi-final, they defeated [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] 6\u20135 on penalties after the sides had each won their home leg 2\u20130. The club failed to win promotion, losing 4\u20132 to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] after extra time. Hartlepool had been leading 2\u20131 with eight minutes of regular time to go, but a controversial penalty decision in the 82nd minute, which also saw Chris Westwood sent off, allowed Sheffield Wednesday to level the scores making it 2\u20132 at the end of 90 minutes. Hartlepool missing a key defender struggled in extra time and conceded two goals. Following this achievement Cooper's assistant Martin Scott was appointed as manager.\n\nThe 2005\u201306 season saw the side slip down the division to the relegation places helped in part by poor management, an indecisive board room and key player injuries. Manager Martin Scott was suspended after an alleged fight with a player in the changing rooms, which resulted in his dismissal. Youth team coach [[Paul Stephenson (footballer)|Paul Stephenson]] was put in charge until the end of the season, aided by former manager Chris Turner who returned to the club as Director of Sport, and despite remaining undefeated in his first five games in charge, he could not prevent the club being relegated into the fourth tier in May 2006. Some felt that Hartlepool's relegation was unfair given that [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] had escaped administration, and therefore a 10-point deduction and relegation, by delaying a CVA meeting until after the season had ended.\n\nOn 13 June 2006, [[Danny Wilson (footballer, born 1960)|Danny Wilson]] was appointed manager. Wilson was unable to save fellow strugglers [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|MK Dons]] from relegation to League Two at the end of the 2005\u201306 season, and he was sacked on 10 May 2006. On 1 January 2007, Hartlepool United equalled the all-time [[The Football League|Football League]] record of consecutive wins without conceding a goal. The 1\u20130 win at [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield Town]] was the eighth straight win without conceding. The record was also held by [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] and [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]. However, the record was then broken by [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] on 3 March 2007 when they recorded their ninth successive win without conceding. The club went on to complete a 23-match unbeaten run which finally ended against the team they last lost to, [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]].\n\nHartlepool returned to [[Football League One|League One]] at the first time of asking, finishing second behind champions [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]]. Pools missed out on the title on the final day after losing 2\u20131 at home to [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] whilst Walsall drew 1\u20131 at [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], whom were also promoted in third place. This was the club's second promotion in four years. They maintained their League One status for a second successive season by finishing 15th in [[2007\u201308 in English football|2007\u201308]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/default.stm |title=BBC News |publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2008, Danny Wilson was sacked; while the club were unbeaten in four games and well clear of the relegation zone, the board felt that Wilson could take the club no further. Chris Turner was quickly returned to the managerial position, combining the role with his existing position as the club's Director of Sport. Pools went into the final round of fixtures with a three-point cushion and six goal buffer over rivals [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]], but were beaten 4\u20131 by Bristol Rovers while Carlisle beat [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] 2\u20130, but both clubs survived after [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] lost 3\u20130 at [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].\n\nHartlepool started the [[2009\u201310 in English football|2009\u201310]] season well, and were in the hunt for a play-off spot early in the season. However, after a 5\u20130 home defeat at the hands of [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]], their form dipped, and the club were dropped into a relegation battle, with matters not helped by a three-point deduction for fielding an ineligible player during a victory over [[Brighton and Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton and Hove Albion]]. The club survived on the final day of the season with a 0\u20130 against [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] being enough to keep them in League One, albeit on goal difference alone after [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] lost 3\u20130 at [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], a result which sent the Gills down instead. Despite the shaky end to the season, survival did mark a milestone for the club, as it marked the first time that they would be playing a fourth consecutive season outside of the League's lowest tier.\n\nChris Turner resigned from the club a few weeks into the following season and [[Mick Wadsworth]] took over on a temporary basis, before being appointed permanently a month later. The season ended up going much the same as the previous one, with the club in play-off contention in the middle of the campaign before falling away as the season went on. However, the drop in Hartlepool's form was not as severe as it had been in the previous two seasons, and they finished in 16th place, well clear of the relegation zone. Despite suffering a 5\u20130 hammering at home to newly relegated Sheffield Wednesday and a 4\u20130 home loss to northern rivals Carlisle, Pools did enjoy 2\u20130 home victories against newly relegated [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] and [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], in addition to a 3\u20131 victory at home to eventual champions [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]].\n\nThe club started the following season well, and were among the front-runners early on, but a bad run of form resulted in the sacking of Wadsworth in December, with former manager [[Neale Cooper]] returning to the club as his replacement. While Cooper was not able to get the club back to their early form, the side stayed generally consistent for the remainder of the season and secured a 13th-place finish, the highest the club had achieved since the play-off campaign in 2005.\n\n===Decline into non-League football===\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hartlepool United FC.png|thumb|left|120px|Club logo 1995-2017; alluded to the town's maritime traditions, and was changed with new ownership in 2017]] -->\n\nHartlepool made a terrible start to the following season,{{when|date=December 2019}} and in the wake of a defeat by bottom-placed [[Bury F.C.|Bury]], which saw the [[Lancashire]] club overhaul Hartlepool and dump them to the bottom of the table, Cooper resigned, bringing an end to his second spell after less than a year. He was replaced by [[John Hughes (footballer born 1964)|John Hughes]], and while the club's form gradually improved, they were ultimately unable to overcome an appalling first half of the season, which saw them secure a paltry 9 points and just one win from their first 23 games. Hartlepool finished second-bottom, only avoiding last place because of [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] being deducted ten points for entering administration, and Hughes was sacked for failing to prevent the club's relegation, with [[Colin Cooper]] replacing him.\n\nAfter an extensive overhaul of the playing squad during the summer, Hartlepool recovered from a poor start to the 2013\u201314 season and by early spring they were making decent progress and looking to make a late play-off bid. However, a terrible run of form late in the season plunged them into the relegation battle, which they did not earn definite safety from until the penultimate match of the season. The club finished 19th that season, their lowest finish in 15 years. An even worse start to the 2014\u201315 season resulted in Cooper resigning a few weeks into the campaign. [[Paul Murray (footballer)|Paul Murray]] replaced Cooper, only to be sacked just two months later, with the club six points adrift at the bottom of League Two, and having just suffered an FA Cup elimination at the hands of non-league [[Blyth Spartans A.F.C.|Blyth Spartans]]. By now the fans had turned against Ken Hodcroft, who resigned and sold the club to Peter Harris in December 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hartlepoolunited.co.uk/news/article/hartlepool-united-chairman-peter-harris-on-takeover-2150317.aspx|title=Hartlepool United Chairman Peter Harris on Takeover|last=HUFC|website=www.hartlepoolunited.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-05-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231215121/http://www.hartlepoolunited.co.uk/news/article/hartlepool-united-chairman-peter-harris-on-takeover-2150317.aspx|archive-date=31 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Harris's first decision was to appoint former Tranmere Rovers manager [[Ronnie Moore]] to the managers' job.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30479722|title=Ronnie Moore: Hartlepool United appoint ex-Rotherham manager|date=2014-12-16|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2017-05-24|language=en-GB}}</ref> The takeover ultimately fell through due to Harris and his associates being involved in dubious activities<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/news/14833525.Former_Swindon_Town_general_manager_faces_fraud_trial/|title=Former Swindon Town general manager faces fraud trial|website=Swindon Advertiser|language=en|access-date=2017-05-24}}</ref> with the club reverting to Hodcroft's ownership, Moore's appointment would prove to be a critical one, and after being ten points adrift in bottom place at the turn of the year a revival in form saw them escape the relegation places and secure survival in the penultimate game of the season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/news/pools-fans-still-on-cloud-nine-after-hartlepool-s-great-escape-1-7230409|title=Pools fans still on cloud nine after Hartlepool's Great Escape|website=www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-05-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318055108/https://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/news/pools-fans-still-on-cloud-nine-after-hartlepool-s-great-escape-1-7230409|archive-date=18 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> After a 16th\u2013place finish in [[2015\u201316 Football League Two|2015\u201316]], Hartlepool were relegated to the [[National League (English football)|National League]] at the end of the [[2016\u201317 EFL League Two|2016\u201317]] season after finishing 23rd in League Two.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/news/hartlepool-united-relegated-from-the-football-league-for-the-first-time-in-their-history-1-8530679|title=Hartlepool United relegated from the Football League for the first time in their history|website=www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-05-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611190217/http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/news/hartlepool-united-relegated-from-the-football-league-for-the-first-time-in-their-history-1-8530679|archive-date=11 June 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Hartlepool was sold to [[Raj Singh (businessman)|Raj Singh]], narrowly avoiding liquidation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11339844/raj-singh-completes-hartlepool-united-takeover|title=Raj Singh completes Hartlepool United takeover|publisher=Sky Sports|language=en|access-date=2017-05-03}}</ref>\n\n==Sponsorship==\n[[O'Neill's]] currently manufactures the club's apparel.

By the time ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'' was released, jumping became such a signature act of Mario that the player was often tasked with jumping to prove to [[non-player character]]s that he was Mario. Mario's most commonly portrayed form of attack is jumping to stomp on the heads of enemies, first used in ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' This jump-stomp move may entirely crush smaller enemies on the stage, and usually deals damage to larger ones, sometimes causing secondary effects.<ref name=\"ign\" />\n\nThis attack often enables Mario to knock the turtle-like [[Koopa Troopa]]s into or out of their shells, which can be used as weapons.<ref name=\"ign\" /> Subsequent games have elaborated on Mario's jumping-related abilities. ''[[Super Mario World]]'' added the ability to spin-jump, which allows Mario to break blocks beneath him. The Game Boy version of ''[[Donkey Kong (Game Boy)|Donkey Kong]]'' allows Mario to jump higher with consecutive jumps, and perform a back-flip.

By the time ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'' was released, jumping became such a signature act of Mario that the player was often tasked with jumping to prove to [[non-player character]]s that he was Mario. Mario's most commonly portrayed form of attack is jumping to stomp on the heads of enemies, first used in ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' This jump-stomp move may entirely crush smaller enemies on the stage, and usually deals damage to larger ones, sometimes causing secondary effects.<ref name=\"ign\" />\n\nThis attack often enables Mario to knock the turtle-like [[Koopa Troopa]]s into or out of their shells, which can be used as weapons.<ref name=\"ign\" /> Subsequent games have elaborated on Mario's jumping-related abilities. ''[[Super Mario World]]'' added the ability to spin-jump, which allows Mario to break blocks beneath him. The Game Boy version of ''[[Donkey Kong (Game Boy)|Donkey Kong]]'' allows Mario to jump higher with consecutive jumps, and perform a back-flip. In ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', Mario gains new jumping abilities such as a sideways somersault; a ground pound, which is a high-impact downward thrusting motion; and the \"Wall Kick\", which propels him upwards by kicking off walls.\n\n===Power-ups===\n[[File:Tanooki Mario.jpg|upright|thumb|Mario seen wearing the Tanooki Suit.

General Winfield Scott''''' is an [[equestrian statue]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], that honors career military officer [[Winfield Scott]].  The monument stands in the center of [[Scott Circle]], a traffic circle and small park at the convergence of [[16th Street NW (Washington, D.C.)|16th Street]], [[Massachusetts Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Massachusetts Avenue]] and [[Rhode Island Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Rhode Island Avenue]] NW.  The statue was sculpted by [[Henry Kirke Brown]], whose best-known works include statues of [[George Washington]] in New York and [[Nathanael Greene]] in Washington, D.C.  It was the first of many sculptures honoring [[American Civil War|Civil War]] generals that were installed in Washington, D.C.'s traffic circles and squares and was the second statue in the city to honor Scott.\n\nThe sculpture is one of the city's [[Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C.|18 Civil War monuments]] that were collectively listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978.  The monument and park are owned and maintained by the [[National Park Service]], a federal agency of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior Department]].  The bronze statue rests on a granite base that at the time was the largest stone ever quarried in the United States.  Much criticized for its depiction of Scott and the proportions of the horse, it is considered one of the worst equestrian sculptures in the city by authors and historians.\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n[[Winfield Scott]] (1786\u20131866), nicknamed \"Old Fuss and Feathers\" and the \"Grand Old Man of the Army\", served on active duty as general longer than any other American officer.  During his 53-year career, he led forces during several wars, including the [[War of 1812]], [[Black Hawk War]], [[Mexican\u2013American War]], [[Seminole Wars]], and [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=history>{{cite web | url=http://www.history.com/topics/winfield-scott | title=Winfield Scott | publisher=The History Channel | accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref>  He served under every president from [[Thomas Jefferson]] to [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref name=goode/>  His twenty-year service as [[Commanding General of the United States Army]] was the longest in that post's history.  His popularity following the Mexican\u2013American War resulted in Scott being nominated the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] candidate in the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]].<ref name=history/>\n\nFollowing Scott's death in 1866, veterans and other citizens began lobbying for a monument to honor the general.  On March 3, 1867, Congress authorized $35,000 for the erection of an equestrian statue.<ref name=jacob>{{cite book | title=Testament to Union: Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C. | publisher=JHU Press | author=Jacob, Kathryn Allamong | year=1998 | location=Baltimore | pages=99\u2013101 | isbn=9780801858611 }}</ref>  The monument was reauthorized by Congress on July 15, 1870, and on June 10, 1872.<ref name=smithsonian/>  The artist selected was [[Henry Kirke Brown]] (1814\u20131886), a sculptor from New York whose 1856 [[George Washington (Brown)|equestrian statue of George Washington]] in [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]], Manhattan, had been well received by critics.

Critics said Scott was being portrayed as \"too old, too fat, too stiff, too short-legged.\"  He was described as looking like \"an old sack of flour\" and irritated because his hand was resting on his hip.  The horse was ridiculed even more.  One reporter said the horse looked like it was \"suffering slightly from ringbone lameness and not daring to travel faster than a walk.\"  The proportions of the horse received the greatest amount of criticism, with observers calling it \"too light, too delicate, too thin, too timid, and dreadfully proportioned.\"  Upon seeing the monument, General [[Philip Sheridan]] reportedly told his wife to never let him be immortalized in such a manner.

Soon after the monument was installed, notable individuals including Secretary of the Treasury [[William Windom]] and ''The Washington Post'' founder [[Stilson Hutchins]] built mansions around the circle.  The area continued to be a desirable location for wealthy Washingtonians until most of the mansions were demolished in the 1940s.

General Winfield Scott''''' is an [[equestrian statue]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], that honors career military officer [[Winfield Scott]].  The monument stands in the center of [[Scott Circle]], a traffic circle and small park at the convergence of [[16th Street NW (Washington, D.C.)|16th Street]], [[Massachusetts Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Massachusetts Avenue]] and [[Rhode Island Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Rhode Island Avenue]] NW.  The statue was sculpted by [[Henry Kirke Brown]], whose best-known works include statues of [[George Washington]] in New York and [[Nathanael Greene]] in Washington, D.C.  It was the first of many sculptures honoring [[American Civil War|Civil War]] generals that were installed in Washington, D.C.'s traffic circles and squares and was the second statue in the city to honor Scott.\n\nThe sculpture is one of the city's [[Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C.|18 Civil War monuments]] that were collectively listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978.  The monument and park are owned and maintained by the [[National Park Service]], a federal agency of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior Department]].  The bronze statue rests on a granite base that at the time was the largest stone ever quarried in the United States.  Much criticized for its depiction of Scott and the proportions of the horse, it is considered one of the worst equestrian sculptures in the city by authors and historians.\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n[[Winfield Scott]] (1786&ndash;1866), nicknamed \"Old Fuss and Feathers\" and the \"Grand Old Man of the Army\", served on active duty as general longer than any other American officer.  During his 53-year career, he led forces during several wars, including the [[War of 1812]], [[Black Hawk War]], [[Mexican\u2013American War]], [[Seminole Wars]], and [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=history>{{cite web | url=http://www.history.com/topics/winfield-scott | title=Winfield Scott | publisher=The History Channel | accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref>  He served under every president from [[Thomas Jefferson]] to [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref name=goode/>  His twenty-year service as [[Commanding General of the United States Army]] was the longest in that post's history.  His popularity following the Mexican\u2013American War resulted in Scott being nominated the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] candidate in the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]].<ref name=history/>\n\nFollowing Scott's death in 1866, veterans and other citizens began lobbying for a monument to honor the general.  On March 3, 1867, Congress authorized $35,000 for the erection of an equestrian statue.<ref name=jacob>{{cite book | title=Testament to Union: Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C. | publisher=JHU Press | author=Jacob, Kathryn Allamong | year=1998 | location=Baltimore | pages=99\u2013101 | isbn=9780801858611 }}</ref>  The monument was reauthorized by Congress on July 15, 1870, and on June 10, 1872.<ref name=smithsonian/>  The artist selected was [[Henry Kirke Brown]] (1814&ndash;1886), a sculptor from New York whose 1856 [[George Washington (Brown)|equestrian statue of George Washington]] in [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]], Manhattan, had been well received by critics.  His other works in Washington, D.C. include ''[[Major General Nathanael Greene (Brown)|Major General Nathanael Greene]]'' in [[Stanton Park]] and busts of Vice Presidents [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] and [[John C.

Critics said Scott was being portrayed as \"too old, too fat, too stiff, too short-legged.\"  He was described as looking like \"an old sack of flour\" and irritated because his hand was resting on his hip.  The horse was ridiculed even more.  One reporter said the horse looked like it was \"suffering slightly from ringbone lameness and not daring to travel faster than a walk.\"  The proportions of the horse received the greatest amount of criticism, with observers calling it \"too light, too delicate, too thin, too timid, and dreadfully proportioned.\"  Upon seeing the monument, General [[Philip Sheridan]] reportedly told his wife to never let him be immortalized in such a manner.  Kathryn Allamong Jacob, author of ''Testament to Union: Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C.'', considers it one of the worst equestrian monuments in the city, especially when compared to the nearby ''[[Major General George Henry Thomas]]'' statue, considered one of the city's best.<ref name=jacob/>  A 2000 article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described it as the city's oddest equestrian statue.<ref name=wapo>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/2000-01/21/111r-012100-idx.html | title=Hidden in Plain Sight | work=The Washington Post | date=January 21, 2000 | accessdate=January 31, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Later history===\nThe introduction of the monument spurred development around Scott Circle and the immediate area.  Soon after the monument was installed, notable individuals including Secretary of the Treasury [[William Windom]] and ''The Washington Post'' founder [[Stilson Hutchins]] built mansions around the circle.  The area continued to be a desirable location for wealthy Washingtonians until most of the mansions were demolished in the 1940s.  In 1941, the monument was temporarily removed when a four-lane tunnel was built beneath the circle.<ref name=williams>{{cite book | title=The Neighborhoods of Logan, Scott, and Thomas Circles | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | author=Williams, Paul K. | year=2001 | location=Charleston | pages=85, 115\u2013117 | isbn=9780738514048 }}</ref>\n\nThe statue is one of eighteen [[Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C.|Civil War monuments in Washington, D.C.]] that were collectively listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP) on September 20, 1978, and the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on March 3, 1979.<ref name=dcinventory/>  The monument and surrounding park are owned and maintained by the National Park Service, a federal agency of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior Department]].<ref name=smithsonian/>\n\n==Design and location==\nThe Scott monument is located in the center of Scott Circle, a traffic circle and park at the convergence of [[16th Street NW (Washington, D.C.)|16th Street]], [[Massachusetts Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Massachusetts Avenue]] and [[Rhode Island Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Rhode Island Avenue]] NW, on the border of the [[Dupont Circle]] and [[Logan Circle, Washington, D.C.|Logan Circle]] neighborhoods.<ref name=survey>{{cite book | title=Washington West Quadrangle, District of Columbia\u2013Maryland\u2013Virginia (Map) | publisher=United States Department of the Interior | author=United States Geological Survey | year=2011 | location=Reston, Virginia | pages=1 : 24,000. 7.5 Minute Series (Topographic) | OCLC=777027791 }}</ref>  Scott Circle is considered the southeastern terminus of [[Embassy Row]] with the [[Embassy of Australia, Washington, D.C.|Embassy of Australia]] overlooking the circle and statue.<ref name=bednar/>  The statue faces south down 16th Street towards the [[White House]].<ref name=goode>{{cite book | title=The Outdoor Sculpture of Washington, D.C. | publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press | author=Goode, James M. | year=1974 | location=Washington, D.C. | pages=287, 341 | isbn=0-87474-149-1 }}</ref>  The park is flanked by two small, triangular reservations.
