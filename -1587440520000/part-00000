At the end of the year, there were 55 neophytes. By 1800, there were 310 neophytes, 352 baptisms, and 70 deaths.<ref name=\"Englehardt1897\" />\n\n=== 1800s ===\nFray Dumetz left the mission in April 1802, then returned in 1804 and finally left the following year at the same time as Fray Francisco Javier Ur\u00eda, who left the country. In 1805, Fray Nicol\u00e1s L\u00e1zaro and Fray Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Zalvidea arrived at the mission; the latter was transferred to San Gabriel in 1806 and the former died at San Diego in August 1807. An adobe church with a tile roof was blessed in December 1806. ''Padres'' Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ur\u00eda and Pedro Mu\u00f1os arrived in 1807; the former retired in November 1808 and was succeeded by Fray Mart\u00edn de Landaeta while Fray Jos\u00e9 Antonio Urresti arrived in 1809 and became the associate of Fray Mu\u00f1oz. Fray Landaeta died in 1816.<ref name=\"Englehardt1897\" />\n\nDuring the first decade of the century, the neophyte population increased from 310 to 955, there had been 797 deaths, and 1468 baptisms. The largest number of baptisms in any one year was 361 in 1803.<ref>Englehardt 1897, p. 238</ref>\n\nIn 1804 there was a land controversy where the ''padres'' successfully protested against the granting of the [[Rancho Camulos]] to Francisco Avila.<ref name=\"Englehardt 1897, p. 414\">Englehardt 1897, p. 414</ref>\n\n=== 1810s ===\nFray Urresti died in 1812 and was succeeded by Fray Joaquin Pascual Nuez in 1812 to 1814, Fray Vincente Pascual Oliva was stationed in the mission from 1814 to 1815. Fray Pedro Mu\u00f1oz left California in 1817, and his place was taken by Fray Marcos Antonio de Vitoria from 1818 to 1820. Fray Ramon Ulibarri arrived in January and Fray Francisco Gonzalez de Ibarra in October 1820. On December 21, 1812, an earthquake hit the area which caused enough damage to necessitate the introduction of 20 new beams to support the church wall. Before 1818, a new chapel was completed. During the period of 1810 to 1820 the population increased slightly, reaching its highest figure, 1,080, in 1819, after which its decline began.<ref name=\"Englehardt 1897, p. 414\"/>\n\n=== 1820s ===\nAfter Fray Ulibarri died in 1821, Fray Francisco Gonzalez de Ibarra was stationed alone in the mission.<ref name=\"Englehardt 1897, p. 415\">Englehardt 1897, p. 415</ref>\n\n=== Beginning of the Mexican era ===\nAfter the Mexican Empire gained independence from Spain on September 27, 1821, the Province of Alta California became the Mexican Territory of Alta California. The missions continued under the rule of Mexico.\n\nFray Ibarra began to complain that the soldiers of his guard were causing problems by selling liquor and lending horses to the natives and in 1825, he declared that \"the presidio was a curse rather than a help to the mission, that the soldiers should go to work and raise grain, and not live on the toil of the Indians, whom they robbed and deceived with talk of liberty while in reality they treated them as slaves.\" This led to a sharp reply from Captain Guerra, who advised the ''Padre'' to modify his tone. The amount of supplies furnished by the mission to the presidio from 1822 to April 1827 amounted to $21,203.<ref name=\"Englehardt 1897, p. 415\"/>\n\n=== 1830s ===\nFray Ibarra continued his labors alone until the middle of 1835 when he retired to Mexico. His successor was Fray Pedro Cabot from San Antonio who was stationed until his death in October 1836.<ref>Bancroft, III, 645-646</ref> After Fray Cabot's death, there is no mention of a missionary at San Fernando until August 1838 when Fray Blas Ordaz remained there during the rest of the decade. Down to 1834, the neophyte population decreased by less than 100 and the mission remained productive.<ref name=\"Englehardt 1897, p. 416\">Englehardt 1897, p. 416</ref>\n\n==== Secularization ====\nIn October 1834, Comisionado Antonio del Valle took charge of the mission estates by inventory from Fray Ibarra. From then, the mission was to be a parish of the second class with a $1000 salary.<ref name=\"Englehardt 1897, p. 416\"/>\n\n=== Later history ===\nIn 1842, six years before the [[California Gold Rush]], a brother of the mission mayordomo (foreman) made the first [[Alta California]] gold discovery in the foothills near the mission. In memory of that discovery, the place was given the name Placerita Canyon, but only small quantities of gold were found.<ref name=\"ruscin196\">Ruscin, p. 196</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/signal/coins/worden-coinage1005.htm|title=California's REAL First Gold|author=Leon Worden|website=www.scvhistory.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1845, Governor [[P\u00edo Pico]] declared the Mission buildings for [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|sale]] and, in 1846, made ''Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a de velicata'' his headquarters as [[Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando]]. The Mission was utilized in a number of ways during the late 19th century: north of the mission was the site of '''Lopez Station''' for the [[Butterfield Overland Mail|Butterfield]] Stage Lines; it served as a warehouse for the Porter Land and Water Company; and in 1896, the [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] was used as a [[Hog (swine)|hog]] farm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waterandpower.org/museum/San_Fernando_Mission.html|title=Water and Power Associates|website=waterandpower.org}}</ref> In 1861, the Mission buildings and 75 acres of land were returned to the church after [[Charles Fletcher Lummis]] acted for preservation. The buildings were disintegrating as beams, tiles and nails were taken from the church by settlers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athanasius.com/camission/fernando.htm |title=Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a|website=www.athanasius.com}}</ref> San Fernando's church became a working church again in 1923 when the [[Oblate (religion)|Oblate]] priests arrived. Many attempts were made to restore the old Mission from the early 20th century, but it was not until the [[Hearst Foundation]] gave a large gift of money in the 1940s, that the Mission was finally restored. The museum became the repository for heirlooms of the Mexican church evacuated during the [[Cristero]] revolt, and also holds part of the Doheny library.<ref>Davis, Mike ''City of Quartz'' London  Vintage 1990 p.329 {{ISBN|0099998203}}</ref> The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, but was extensively damaged by the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake]], and was completely rebuilt. Repairs were completed in 1974. It continues to be very well cared for and is still used as a [[chapel-of-ease]]. The [[Convento Building (Mission San Fernando)|Convento Building]] was separately listed on the Register in 1988. In 2003, comedian [[Bob Hope]] was interred in the Bob Hope Memorial Gardens; followed by his widow Dolores Hope in 2011.\n\n== Life in the mission ==\n\n===Mission industries===\nThe goals of the missions were, first, to spread the message of Christianity and, second, to establish a Spanish colony. Because of the difficulty of delivering supplies by sea, the missions had to become self-sufficient in relatively short order. Toward that end, neophytes were taught European-style farming, animal husbandry, mechanical arts and domestic crafts.\n\n==Mission bells==\nBells were vitally important to daily life at any mission. The bells were rung at mealtimes, to call the Mission residents to work and to religious services, during births and funerals, to signal the approach of a ship or returning missionary, and at other times; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with the ringing the mission bell. The residents as referred to above were called neophytes  (Indigenous person) after baptism.\n\nA hundred-[[Pound (mass)|pound]] bell was unearthed in an orange grove near the Mission in 1920. It carried the following inscription (translated from [[Russian language|Russian]]): \"''In the Year 1796, in the month of January, this bell was cast on the Island of Kodiak by the blessing of '''Archimandrite Joaseph''', during the sojourn of [[Alexander Andreyevich Baranov|Alexsandr Baranov]]''.\" It is not known how this [[Russian Orthodox]] artifact from [[Kodiak, Alaska]] made its way to a Catholic mission in Southern California.\n\n==In popular culture==\n* The grave of the late actor [[Bob Hope]] and his wife is located at the [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" heights=\"180px\" mode=packed>\nCorridor at Mission San Fernando Rey de Espana.jpg|A view looking down an exterior corridor at Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a, a common architectural feature of the Spanish Missions\nSan Fernando Rey de Espana circa 1900 Keystone-Mast.jpg|A view of the same location as at left, circa 1900\nFountain Mission San Fernando.jpg|The fountain opposite San Fernando Mission Road\n2007 Mission San Fernando.jpg|The present-day Mission fa\u00e7ade\nSan Fernando Mission Church Interior.JPG|San Fernando Mission Church Interior\nJunipero Serra at Mission San Fernando.jpg|A statue of Father [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]] and a native child at Mission San Fernando\nMission San Fernando Postcard, circa 1900.jpg|Mission San Fernando Postcard, circa 1900\nLopez Station San Fernando Valley 1860s.png|Lopez Station in the 1860s\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Convento Building (Mission San Fernando)]]\n* [[List of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments in the San Fernando Valley]]\n* [[Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando]]\n* [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]]\n* [[Spanish missions in California]]\n* [[USNS Mission San Fernando|USNS ''Mission San Fernando'' (AO-122)]] \u2013 a ''[[USNS Mission Buenaventura|Mission Buenaventura (AO\u2011111)]]'' Class [[Oiler (ship)|fleet oiler]] built during [[World War I]]\n*[[Casa De San Pedro]] served mission in past\n*[[Chatsworth Calera]] owned by mission in past\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==More information==\n* {{cite book|author=Engelhardt, Zephyrin, O.F.M.|year=1922|title=San Juan Capistrano Mission|publisher=Standard Printing Co., Los Angeles, CA|id=}}\n* {{cite book|author=Forbes, Alexander|year=1839|title=California: A History of Upper and Lower California|publisher=Smith, Elder and Co., Cornhill, London|id=|url=https://archive.org/details/californiahistor01alex|via=Internet Archive}}\n* {{cite book|author=Fedorova, Svetlana G., trans. & ed. by Richard A.

Fray Francisco Dumetz and his associate Fray Francisco Javier Ur\u00eda labored in the mission until after 1800.<ref name=\"Englehardt1897\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/FranciscansInCalifornia|title=The Franciscans in California|last=Engelhardt|first=Zephyrin|date=1897|publisher=Harbor Springs, Mich., Holy childhood Indian school|pages=[https://archive.org/details/FranciscansInCalifornia/page/n439 411]\u2013412}}</ref>\n\nEarly in October 1797, 13 adults were baptized and the first marriage took place on October 8. At the end of the year, there were 55 neophytes. By 1800, there were 310 neophytes, 352 baptisms, and 70 deaths.<ref name=\"Englehardt1897\" />\n\n=== 1800s ===\nFray Dumetz left the mission in April 1802, then returned in 1804 and finally left the following year at the same time as Fray Francisco Javier Ur\u00eda, who left the country. In 1805, Fray Nicol\u00e1s L\u00e1zaro and Fray Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Zalvidea arrived at the mission; the latter was transferred to San Gabriel in 1806 and the former died at San Diego in August 1807. An adobe church with a tile roof was blessed in December 1806. ''Padres'' Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ur\u00eda and Pedro Mu\u00f1os arrived in 1807; the former retired in November 1808 and was succeeded by Fray Mart\u00edn de Landaeta while Fray Jos\u00e9 Antonio Urresti arrived in 1809 and became the associate of Fray Mu\u00f1oz. Fray Landaeta died in 1816.<ref name=\"Englehardt1897\" />\n\nDuring the first decade of the century, the neophyte population increased from 310 to 955, there had been 797 deaths, and 1468 baptisms. The largest number of baptisms in any one year was 361 in 1803.<ref>Englehardt 1897, p. 238</ref>\n\nIn 1804 there was a land controversy where the ''padres'' successfully protested against the granting of the [[Rancho Camulos]] to Francisco Avila.<ref>Englehardt 1897, p. 414</ref>\n\n=== 1810s ===\nFray Urresti died in 1812 and was succeeded by Fray Joaquin Pascual Nuez in 1812 to 1814, Fray Vincente Pascual Oliva was stationed in the mission from 1814 to 1815. Fray Pedro Mu\u00f1oz left California in 1817, and his place was taken by Fray Marcos Antonio de Vitoria from 1818 to 1820. Fray Ramon Ulibarri arrived in January and Fray Francisco Gonzalez de Ibarra in October 1820. On December 21, 1812, an earthquake hit the area which caused enough damage to necessitate the introduction of 20 new beams to support the church wall. Before 1818, a new chapel was completed. During the period of 1810 to 1820 the population increased slightly, reaching its highest figure, 1,080, in 1819, after which its decline began.<ref>Englehardt 1897, p. 414</ref>\n\n=== 1820s ===\nAfter Fray Ulibarri died in 1821, Fray Francisco Gonzalez de Ibarra was stationed alone in the mission.<ref>Englehardt 1897, p. 415</ref>\n\n=== Beginning of the Mexican era ===\nAfter the Mexican Empire gained independence from Spain on September 27, 1821, the Province of Alta California became the Mexican Territory of Alta California. The missions continued under the rule of Mexico.\n\nFray Ibarra began to complain that the soldiers of his guard were causing problems by selling liquor and lending horses to the natives and in 1825, he declared that \"the presidio was a curse rather than a help to the mission, that the soldiers should go to work and raise grain, and not live on the toil of the Indians, whom they robbed and deceived with talk of liberty while in reality they treated them as slaves.\" This led to a sharp reply from Captain Guerra, who advised the ''Padre'' to modify his tone. The amount of supplies furnished by the mission to the presidio from 1822 to April 1827 amounted to $21,203.<ref>Englehardt 1897, p. 415</ref>\n\n=== 1830s ===\nFray Ibarra continued his labors alone until the middle of 1835 when he retired to Mexico. His successor was Fray Pedro Cabot from San Antonio who was stationed until his death in October 1836.<ref>Bancroft, III, 645-646</ref> After Fray Cabot's death, there is no mention of a missionary at San Fernando until August 1838 when Fray Blas Ordaz remained there during the rest of the decade. Down to 1834, the neophyte population decreased by less than 100 and the mission remained productive.<ref>Englehardt 1897, p. 416</ref>\n\n==== Secularization ====\nIn October 1834, Comisionado Antonio del Valle took charge of the mission estates by inventory from Fray Ibarra. From then, the mission was to be a parish of the second class with a $1000 salary.<ref>Englehardt 1897, p. 416</ref>\n\n=== Later history ===\nIn 1842, six years before the [[California Gold Rush]], a brother of the mission mayordomo (foreman) made the first [[Alta California]] gold discovery in the foothills near the mission. In memory of that discovery, the place was given the name Placerita Canyon, but only small quantities of gold were found.<ref name=\"ruscin196\">Ruscin, p. 196</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/signal/coins/worden-coinage1005.htm|title=California's REAL First Gold|author=Leon Worden|website=www.scvhistory.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1845, Governor [[P\u00edo Pico]] declared the Mission buildings for [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|sale]] and, in 1846, made ''Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a de velicata'' his headquarters as [[Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando]]. The Mission was utilized in a number of ways during the late 19th century: north of the mission was the site of '''Lopez Station''' for the [[Butterfield Overland Mail|Butterfield]] Stage Lines; it served as a warehouse for the Porter Land and Water Company; and in 1896, the [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] was used as a [[Hog (swine)|hog]] farm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waterandpower.org/museum/San_Fernando_Mission.html|title=Water and Power Associates|website=waterandpower.org}}</ref> In 1861, the Mission buildings and 75 acres of land were returned to the church after [[Charles Fletcher Lummis]] acted for preservation. The buildings were disintegrating as beams, tiles and nails were taken from the church by settlers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athanasius.com/camission/fernando.htm |title=Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a|website=www.athanasius.com}}</ref> San Fernando's church became a working church again in 1923 when the [[Oblate (religion)|Oblate]] priests arrived. Many attempts were made to restore the old Mission from the early 20th century, but it was not until the [[Hearst Foundation]] gave a large gift of money in the 1940s, that the Mission was finally restored. The museum became the repository for heirlooms of the Mexican church evacuated during the [[Cristero]] revolt, and also holds part of the Doheny library.<ref>Davis, Mike ''City of Quartz'' London  Vintage 1990 p.329 {{ISBN|0099998203}}</ref> The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, but was extensively damaged by the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake]], and was completely rebuilt. Repairs were completed in 1974. It continues to be very well cared for and is still used as a [[chapel-of-ease]]. The [[Convento Building (Mission San Fernando)|Convento Building]] was separately listed on the Register in 1988. In 2003, comedian [[Bob Hope]] was interred in the Bob Hope Memorial Gardens; followed by his widow Dolores Hope in 2011.\n\n== Life in the mission ==\n\n===Mission industries===\nThe goals of the missions were, first, to spread the message of Christianity and, second, to establish a Spanish colony. Because of the difficulty of delivering supplies by sea, the missions had to become self-sufficient in relatively short order. Toward that end, neophytes were taught European-style farming, animal husbandry, mechanical arts and domestic crafts.\n\n==Mission bells==\nBells were vitally important to daily life at any mission. The bells were rung at mealtimes, to call the Mission residents to work and to religious services, during births and funerals, to signal the approach of a ship or returning missionary, and at other times; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with the ringing the mission bell. The residents as referred to above were called neophytes  (Indigenous person) after baptism.\n\nA hundred-[[Pound (mass)|pound]] bell was unearthed in an orange grove near the Mission in 1920. It carried the following inscription (translated from [[Russian language|Russian]]): \"''In the Year 1796, in the month of January, this bell was cast on the Island of Kodiak by the blessing of '''Archimandrite Joaseph''', during the sojourn of [[Alexander Andreyevich Baranov|Alexsandr Baranov]]''.\" It is not known how this [[Russian Orthodox]] artifact from [[Kodiak, Alaska]] made its way to a Catholic mission in Southern California.\n\n==In popular culture==\n* The grave of the late actor [[Bob Hope]] and his wife is located at the [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" heights=\"180px\" mode=packed>\nCorridor at Mission San Fernando Rey de Espana.jpg|A view looking down an exterior corridor at Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a, a common architectural feature of the Spanish Missions\nSan Fernando Rey de Espana circa 1900 Keystone-Mast.jpg|A view of the same location as at left, circa 1900\nFountain Mission San Fernando.jpg|The fountain opposite San Fernando Mission Road\n2007 Mission San Fernando.jpg|The present-day Mission fa\u00e7ade\nSan Fernando Mission Church Interior.JPG|San Fernando Mission Church Interior\nJunipero Serra at Mission San Fernando.jpg|A statue of Father [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]] and a native child at Mission San Fernando\nMission San Fernando Postcard, circa 1900.jpg|Mission San Fernando Postcard, circa 1900\nLopez Station San Fernando Valley 1860s.png|Lopez Station in the 1860s\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Convento Building (Mission San Fernando)]]\n* [[List of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments in the San Fernando Valley]]\n* [[Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando]]\n* [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]]\n* [[Spanish missions in California]]\n* [[USNS Mission San Fernando|USNS ''Mission San Fernando'' (AO-122)]] \u2013 a ''[[USNS Mission Buenaventura|Mission Buenaventura (AO\u2011111)]]'' Class [[Oiler (ship)|fleet oiler]] built during [[World War I]]\n*[[Casa De San Pedro]] served mission in past\n*[[Chatsworth Calera]] owned by mission in past\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==More information==\n* {{cite book|author=Engelhardt, Zephyrin, O.F.M.|year=1922|title=San Juan Capistrano Mission|publisher=Standard Printing Co., Los Angeles, CA|id=}}\n* {{cite book|author=Forbes, Alexander|year=1839|title=California: A History of Upper and Lower California|publisher=Smith, Elder and Co., Cornhill, London|id=|url=https://archive.org/details/californiahistor01alex|via=Internet Archive}}\n* {{cite book|author=Fedorova, Svetlana G., trans. & ed. by Richard A.

Acts such as the [[Nat King Cole Trio]], and [[Joe Liggins|Joe Liggins and The Honey Drippers]] performed on its stage. In 1949, the Million Dollar was taken over by Frank Fouce, a local Spanish-language theater owner and [[film distributor]]. The Million Dollar Theater became the mecca of [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] entertainment in the United States. [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], [[Cantinflas]], [[Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix]], [[Agust\u00edn Lara]], [[Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Jim\u00e9nez]], [[Jos\u00e9 Feliciano]], [[Juan Gabriel]], [[Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez]], and [[Celia Cruz]] are but a few of the artists that worked for Empresa Fouce. It was also the first venue where the late Mexican film star [[Antonio Aguilar Barraza|Antonio Aguilar]] worked with his rodeo horses on stage. This is where it is said he conceived the idea for his large arena rodeo productions.\n\n===1950s-1960s===\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, Fouce went on to found Spanish International Communications Corp., named after his Spanish International Theater Company (which included the Million Dollar and the [[Mayan Theater]], also located in [[Downtown Los Angeles]]). This company comprised the first group of Spanish-language and [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] television stations in the U.S.; [[KMEX|KMEX Channel 34]] in Los Angeles (and, indirectly, the [[Univision]] television network) can trace its roots to the Million Dollar Theatre. The Million Dollar and the Fouce Family were pioneers in the then-unheard-of Spanish entertainment industry.\n\nFor their efforts, Fouce was awarded [[Order of the Aztec Eagle|El Aguila Azteca (Order of the Aztec Eagle)]], Mexico's highest civilian award, by President [[Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s]]. The theater and Fouce were also honored by the Mexican actors' union [[National Association of Actors|ANDA]] for their contributions to the Mexican film, recording, and entertainment industries. In addition to its successful stage productions, the theater was also the most prominent Spanish-language cinema in the United States. Every major Mexican motion picture premiered at the Million Dollar.\n\nThe Million Dollar featured Mariachi Music at its best: Mariachi Vargas, Mariachi Chapala de Leopoldo Sosa y Esteban Hernandez, Mariachi Los Gallos de Crescencio Hernandez, Mariachi Los Galleros de Pedro Rey (Hernandez), [[Mariachi los Camperos]] (led by [[Nati Cano]]), Mariachi Mexico de Pepe Villa.\n\n===1970s-1990s===\n\n[[Gonzalo L. Checa]], president of the Spanish division of the Metropolitan Theater Corporation, was responsible for the upsurge of attendance at the Million Dollar in the '70s and '80s due to his great expertise and keen insight of the entertainment needs of the Hispanic community.

Grauman was later responsible for [[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre]] and [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], both on [[Hollywood Boulevard]], and was partly responsible for the entertainment district shifting from downtown Los Angeles to Hollywood in the mid-1920s. \n\nSculptor [[Jo Mora|Joseph Mora]] did the elaborate and surprising exterior [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival]] ornament, including bursts of lavish [[Churrigueresque]] decoration, statues, longhorn skulls, and other odd features. The auditorium architect was [[William L. Woollett]], and the designer of the 12-story tower was Los Angeles architect [[Albert C. Martin, Sr.|Albert C. Martin Sr.]] \n\nFor many years, the office building housed the headquarters of the [[Metropolitan Water District|Metropolitan Water District of Southern California]].<ref name=\"dornsife\">{{cite web\n| url        = http://dornsife.usc.edu/la-walking-tour/million-dollar-theater/\n| title      = Million Dollar Theater - Downtown Los Angeles Walking Tour\n| last       = \n| first      = \n| date       = \n| website    = USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences\n| publisher  = \n| accessdate = 2014-06-21\n| archiveurl = \n| archivedate= \n}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Facade of million dollar theater.jpg|thumb|left|325px|The facade at the top of the building]]\n\n===1940s===\n\nIn the '40s, the theater was the second-run house of the famous [[Orpheum Circuit]]. Acts such as the [[Nat King Cole Trio]], and [[Joe Liggins|Joe Liggins and The Honey Drippers]] performed on its stage. In 1949, the Million Dollar was taken over by Frank Fouce, a local Spanish-language theater owner and [[film distributor]]. The Million Dollar Theater became the mecca of [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] entertainment in the United States. [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], [[Cantinflas]], [[Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix]], [[Agust\u00edn Lara]], [[Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Jim\u00e9nez]], [[Jos\u00e9 Feliciano]], [[Juan Gabriel]], [[Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez]], and [[Celia Cruz]] are but a few of the artists that worked for Empresa Fouce. It was also the first venue where the late Mexican film star [[Antonio Aguilar Barraza|Antonio Aguilar]] worked with his rodeo horses on stage. This is where it is said he conceived the idea for his large arena rodeo productions.\n\n===1950s-1960s===\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, Fouce went on to found Spanish International Communications Corp., named after his Spanish International Theater Company (which included the Million Dollar and the [[Mayan Theater]], also located in [[Downtown Los Angeles]]). This company comprised the first group of Spanish-language and [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] television stations in the U.S.; [[KMEX|KMEX Channel 34]] in Los Angeles (and, indirectly, the [[Univision]] television network) can trace its roots to the Million Dollar Theatre. The Million Dollar and the Fouce Family were pioneers in the then-unheard-of Spanish entertainment industry.\n\nFor their efforts, Fouce was awarded [[Order of the Aztec Eagle|El Aguila Azteca (Order of the Aztec Eagle)]], Mexico's highest civilian award, by President [[Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s]]. The theater and Fouce were also honored by the Mexican actors' union [[National Association of Actors|ANDA]] for their contributions to the Mexican film, recording, and entertainment industries. In addition to its successful stage productions, the theater was also the most prominent Spanish-language cinema in the United States. Every major Mexican motion picture premiered at the Million Dollar. \n\nThe Million Dollar featured Mariachi Music at its best: Mariachi Vargas, Mariachi Chapala de Leopoldo Sosa y Esteban Hernandez, Mariachi Los Gallos de Crescencio Hernandez, Mariachi Los Galleros de Pedro Rey (Hernandez), [[Mariachi los Camperos]] (led by [[Nati Cano]]), Mariachi Mexico de Pepe Villa.\n\n===1970s-1990s===\n\n[[Gonzalo L. Checa]], president of the Spanish division of the Metropolitan Theater Corporation, was responsible for the upsurge of attendance at the Million Dollar in the '70s and '80s due to his great expertise and keen insight of the entertainment needs of the Hispanic community. During this golden heyday, the long lines of people waiting to attend the Million Dollar would wrap around the block and cause the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] to close down Broadway to traffic. \n\n[[File:Milliondollartheater.jpg|thumb|325px|right|The theater's marquee in 2006]]\n\nCheca became a low-profile power broker and behind-the-scenes player, who helped launch the U.S. invasion of stars like [[Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9]], [[Nelson Ned]], [[Juan Gabriel]], [[Julio Alem\u00e1n]], [[Mar\u00eda Elena Velasco]] (\"La India Maria\"), [[Enrique Cuenca Marquez]] and [[Eduardo Manzano]] (\"Los Polivoces\"), [[Ra\u00fal Ram\u00edrez]], [[Jorge Rivero]], [[Rodolfo de Anda]], [[Eulalio Gonzalez]] (\"El Piporo\"), [[Joan Sebastian]], [[Antonio Aguilar]] and his wife [[Flor Silvestre]], [[Gaspar Henaine]] (\"Capulina\"), and the famous silver masked wrestler [[Rodolfo Guzm\u00e1n Huerta]] (\"El Santo\").\n\nIra Yellin (then the owner of [[Grand Central Market]]) acquired the building in 1989.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-02-10/business/fi-2281_1_million-dollar|title=Restoration Planned for 'Million Dollar Building' :  Developer Buys Downtown Landmark|last=GROVES|first=MARTHA|date=1989-02-10|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2017-12-05|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\n\nAfter serving as the home of a Spanish-language church for some years, as of 2006, the Million Dollar Theatre was empty, although the office building had been recently renovated and converted to residential space.

The \"Biltmore Angel\" is heavily incorporated into the design\u2014as a symbol of the city as well as the Biltmore itself.  With a thick steel and concrete frame, the structure takes up half a city block and rises over 11 stories.\n\nThe interiors of the Biltmore Hotel are decorated with: [[fresco]]s and [[mural]]s; carved [[marble]] [[fountain]]s and columns; massive wood-beamed ceilings; [[travertine]] and oak paneled walls; [[Lead glass|lead crystal]] [[chandelier]]s; cast [[bronze]] stairwells and doorways; fine [[artisan]] [[marquetry]] and mill work; and heavily [[embroidered]] imported [[tapestry|tapestries]] and draperies. Most notable are the frescoed mural ceilings in the main Galleria and the Crystal Ballroom, which were hand painted in 1922 by Italian artist [[John B. Smeraldi]], known for his work in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] and the [[White House]]. Smeraldi and his team famously painted the ballroom's colorful, seamless fresco over a period of seven months, decorating it with figures of Greek and Roman gods, angels, cupids and other mythological creatures.  It was meticulously restored in the 1980s by Smeraldi's apprentice, [[Anthony Heinsbergen]]. The imported Austrian crystal chandeliers that adorn it are {{convert|12|ft|m}} in diameter.\n\nThe Rendezvous Court, once the hotel's lobby but now used primarily for afternoon tea, is decorated with a [[Moorish Revival architecture|Moorish Revival]] styled plaster ceiling painted with [[Carat (purity)|24 Carat Gold]] accents, two original imported Italian chandeliers from 1923, and a grand [[Baroque Revival architecture|Spanish Baroque Revival]] bronze doorway, whose astrological [[clock]] still keeps time today. Two figures appear on the stairwell front\u2014on the left is the [[Roman mythology|Roman goddess]] of agriculture [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], while on the right is the Spanish explorer [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]]. The current lobby at the hotel's Grand Avenue entrance still has its original travertine walls and oak paneling as well as the large artificial skylighted ceiling, reflected in the custom carpet below.\n\n[[Image:Milleniumbiltmoregalleria.jpg|right|thumb|Millennium Biltmore Hotel Galleria]]\nEach ballroom on the Galleria level is themed either after the room's original function or the hotel's overall California-heritage premise. The Emerald Room was once the hotel's main guest dining room; its decor features images of hunt and harvest, with hand-painted animals and fish on the cast-plaster ceiling beams. The Tiffany Room was formerly an open corridor used as a drop-off point for Crystal Ballroom functions. Now enclosed, the elegant space centers around exploration, with relief sculptures and panels depicting [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella I of Castile]], and [[Christopher Columbus]] and other [[Exploration of North America|Spanish New World explorers]]. The split-level Gold Room, once a dining room for elite guests, features [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition-era]] hidden liquor compartments and panels along the ceiling for [[Photojournalism|press photographers]] to take pictures of the event below. It is decorated with a gold [[Plaster cast|cast-plaster]] ceiling, hand-oiled wood paneling, and nine mirrored windows along three sides.\n\nThe South Galleria is painted with floral [[frieze]]s inspired by the decor of [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[Pompeii]], and features a vaulted ceiling, marble [[balustrade]]s and heavy Roman piers. Gold-painted [[wrought iron]] gates open to a staircase leading down to the Biltmore Bowl.\n\nAlso of interest is the hotel's health club and indoor pool, which was modeled after the decks of 1920s luxury ocean liners.  Solid brass trim on windows, doors and railings, teakwood deck chairs and hand-laid Italian mosaic tile on the walls and in the pool are original.\n\n==Restaurants==\nSince 2015, four restaurants and bars serve the hotel, including Smeraldi's Restaurant (American continental cuisine), newly relaunched Bugis Street Brasserie, the Rendezvous Court, and the Gallery Bar.\n\n==Events==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2014}}\nThe Los Angeles Biltmore is known for being an early home to the [[Academy Awards]] ceremony\u2014the Oscars. The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] was founded at a luncheon banquet in the Crystal Ballroom in May 1927, when guests such as [[Louis B. Mayer]] met to discuss plans for the new organization and presenting achievement awards to colleagues in their industry.  Legend has it that MGM art director [[Cedric Gibbons]], who was in attendance, immediately grabbed a linen Biltmore napkin and sketched the design for the [[Academy Award#Oscar statuette|Oscar statue]] on it. Eight Oscar ceremonies were held in the Biltmore Bowl during the Academy's early years of 1931, 1935\u201339, and 1941-42.  In 1977 [[Bob Hope]] hosted the Academy's 50th Anniversary banquet in the same room.\n\nThe ''Biltmore Theater'' was situated at the corner of 5th and Grand from 1924\u20131967,<ref>BILTMORE THEATRE, LOS ANGELES . . A.L. Erlanger, Joe Toplitzky, Owners . . Opened: March 3, 1924. https://sites.google.com/site/downtownlosangelestheatres/biltmore</ref> now the Biltmore Court & Tower location. [[Will Rogers]] emceed the opening of the theater in 1924, which then ran plays starring luminaries such as [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Henry Fonda]], and [[Mae West]] until its closure in 1967.\n\nIn 1929, Germany's [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]] airship soared over the hotel on its round-the-world voyage, sponsored by newspaper magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]].  Crew and passengers were fed by Biltmore culinary staff, who also replenished their on-board supplies.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the Biltmore served as a military rest and recreation facility, with the entire second floor set up with cots for military personnel on leave.\n\nOn March 7, 1952, the well-known [[yogi]] and author [[Paramahansa Yogananda]], while giving a speech in honor of the Indian ambassador [[Binay Ranjan Sen]], dropped dead of a heart attack at the Biltmore Hotel.<ref>Kriyananda, Swami (1977).

Kennedy]] as the party's presidential nominee. He set up his campaign headquarters in the Music Room (now the Lobby), with running mate [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] across the hall in the Emerald Room.  Their press conferences in the Crystal Ballroom were heavily photographed and documented.\n\n[[The Beatles]] paid a visit to the Presidential Suite in August 1964 during their first U.S. tour.  Due to the overwhelming number of fans crowding the sidewalks in front of the hotel, the \"Fab Four\" were forced to access their room by landing atop the hotel in a helicopter.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nThe Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel served  the [[International Olympic Committee]] as their headquarters during the [[1984 Summer Olympics]]. In 1988 the Duke & Duchess of York were hosted by [[Armand Hammer]] at a Biltmore gala.  Recently the Biltmore has hosted the semi-finals for ''[[American Idol]]'', the yearly awards for the Cinemal Audio Society, visiting teams for the [[World Baseball Classic]], and multiple [[Grammy Awards]] after-parties.\n\n==Films and TV shows==\n*Scenes from many movies and television shows have been filmed at the hotel, including:\n\n===Movies===\n''[[Alien Nation (film)|Alien Nation]]'', ''[[Bachelor Party (1984 film)|Bachelor Party]]'' (1984), ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'', ''[[Blow (film)|Blow]]'', ''[[Blue Streak (film)|Blue Streak]]'', ''[[Bugsy]]'', ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974), ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'', ''[[Dave (film)|Dave]]'', ''[[The Fabulous Baker Boys]]'', ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]'' (1997), ''[[Ghostbusters (1984 film)|Ghostbusters]]'' (1984), ''[[Heartbreakers (2001 film)|Heartbreakers]]'' (2001), ''[[In the Line of Fire]]'', ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' (1996), ''[[The Italian Job (2003 film)|The Italian Job]]'' (2003),  ''[[National Treasure (film)|National Treasure]]'', ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'' (1996), ''[[Ocean's 11]]'', ''[[Pretty in Pink]]'', ''[[Prom Night (2008 film)|Prom Night]]'' (2008), ''[[Something New (film)|Something New]]'', ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' (2002), ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'', ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1937), ''[[True Lies]]'', ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'', ''[[The Wedding Ringer]]''.\n\nThe hotel's exterior can also be seen in ''[[Cruel Intentions]]'', ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'' and ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]''.\n\n===Television===\n\n''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', ''[[Black Monday (TV series)|Black Monday]]'', ''[[Bosch (TV series)|Bosch]]'', ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', ''[[CSI: NY]]'', ''[[Drop Dead Diva]]'', ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'', ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', ''[[The Good Place]]'', ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', [[Leverage (TV series)|''Leverage'']], ''[[Mad Men]]'', ''[[Mob City]]'', ''[[Nip/Tuck]]'', ''[[NYPD Blue]]'', ''[[The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills]]'', ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'', ''[[That '70s Show]]'', ''[[War and Remembrance (mini-series)|War and Remembrance]]'', ''[[The West Wing]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nThe hotel also has been featured in a commercial for Stanton Optical, a company based in [[Palm Springs, Florida]].\n\n===Music videos===\n[[Steve Perry]], ''[[Oh Sherrie]]'' (1984); [[Janet Jackson]], ''[[Son of a Gun (I Betcha Think This Song Is About You)]]'' (2001); [[Britney Spears]], ''[[Overprotected]]'' (Darkchild Remix) (2002); [[Simple Plan]], ''[[Shut Up!

The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] was founded at a luncheon banquet in the Crystal Ballroom in May 1927, when guests such as [[Louis B. Mayer]] met to discuss plans for the new organization and presenting achievement awards to colleagues in their industry.  Legend has it that MGM art director [[Cedric Gibbons]], who was in attendance, immediately grabbed a linen Biltmore napkin and sketched the design for the [[Academy Award#Oscar statuette|Oscar statue]] on it. Eight Oscar ceremonies were held in the Biltmore Bowl during the Academy's early years of 1931, 1935\u201339, and 1941-42.  In 1977 [[Bob Hope]] hosted the Academy's 50th Anniversary banquet in the same room.\n\nThe ''Biltmore Theater'' was situated at the corner of 5th and Grand from 1924\u20131967,<ref> BILTMORE THEATRE, LOS ANGELES . . A.L. Erlanger, Joe Toplitzky, Owners . . Opened: March 3, 1924. https://sites.google.com/site/downtownlosangelestheatres/biltmore</ref> now the Biltmore Court & Tower location. [[Will Rogers]] emceed the opening of the theater in 1924, which then ran plays starring luminaries such as [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Henry Fonda]], and [[Mae West]] until its closure in 1967.\n\nIn 1929, Germany's [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]] airship soared over the hotel on its round-the-world voyage, sponsored by newspaper magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]].  Crew and passengers were fed by Biltmore culinary staff, who also replenished their on-board supplies.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the Biltmore served as a military rest and recreation facility, with the entire second floor set up with cots for military personnel on leave.\n\nOn March 7, 1952, the well-known [[yogi]] and author [[Paramahansa Yogananda]], while giving a speech in honor of the Indian ambassador [[Binay Ranjan Sen]], dropped dead of a heart attack at the Biltmore Hotel.<ref>Kriyananda, Swami (1977).

Kennedy]] as the party's presidential nominee. He set up his campaign headquarters in the Music Room (now the Lobby), with running mate [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] across the hall in the Emerald Room.  Their press conferences in the Crystal Ballroom were heavily photographed and documented.\n\n[[The Beatles]] paid a visit to the Presidential Suite in August 1964 during their first U.S. tour.  Due to the overwhelming number of fans crowding the sidewalks in front of the hotel, the \"Fab Four\" were forced to access their room by landing atop the hotel in a helicopter.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nThe Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel served  the [[International Olympic Committee]] as their headquarters during the [[1984 Summer Olympics]]. In 1988 the Duke & Duchess of York were hosted by [[Armand Hammer]] at a Biltmore gala.  Recently the Biltmore has hosted the semi-finals for ''[[American Idol]]'', the yearly awards for the Cinemal Audio Society, visiting teams for the [[World Baseball Classic]], and multiple [[Grammy Awards]] after-parties.\n\n==Films and TV shows==\n*Scenes from many movies and television shows have been filmed at the hotel, including:\n\n===Movies===\n''[[Alien Nation (film)|Alien Nation]]'', ''[[Bachelor Party (1984 film)|Bachelor Party]]'' (1984), ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'', ''[[Blow (film)|Blow]]'', ''[[Blue Streak (film)|Blue Streak]]'', ''[[Bugsy]]'', ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974), ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'', ''[[Dave (film)|Dave]]'', ''[[The Fabulous Baker Boys]]'', ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]'' (1997), ''[[Ghostbusters (1984 film)|Ghostbusters]]'' (1984), ''[[Heartbreakers (2001 film)|Heartbreakers]]'' (2001), ''[[In the Line of Fire]]'', ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' (1996), ''[[The Italian Job (2003 film)|The Italian Job]]'' (2003),  ''[[National Treasure (film)|National Treasure]]'', ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'' (1996), ''[[Ocean's 11]]'', ''[[Pretty in Pink]]'', ''[[Prom Night (2008 film)|Prom Night]]'' (2008), ''[[Something New (film)|Something New]]'', ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' (2002), ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'', ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1937), ''[[True Lies]]'', ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'', ''[[The Wedding Ringer]]''.\n\nThe hotel's exterior can also be seen in ''[[Cruel Intentions]]'', ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'' and ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]''.\n\n===Television===\n\n''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', ''[[Black Monday (TV series)|Black Monday]]'', ''[[Bosch (TV series)|Bosch]]'', ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', ''[[CSI: NY]]'', ''[[Drop Dead Diva]]'', ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'', ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', ''[[The Good Place]]'', ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', [[Leverage (TV series)|''Leverage'']], ''[[Mad Men]]'', ''[[Mob City]]'', ''[[Nip/Tuck]]'', ''[[NYPD Blue]]'', ''[[The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills]]'', ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'', ''[[That '70s Show]]'', ''[[War and Remembrance (mini-series)|War and Remembrance]]'', ''[[The West Wing]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nThe hotel also has been featured in a commercial for Stanton Optical, a company based in [[Palm Springs, Florida]].\n\n===Music videos===\n[[Steve Perry]], ''[[Oh Sherrie]]'' (1984); [[Janet Jackson]], ''[[Son of a Gun (I Betcha Think This Song Is About You)]]'' (2001); [[Britney Spears]], ''[[Overprotected]]'' (Darkchild Remix) (2002); [[Simple Plan]], ''[[Shut Up!

Several rotor blades mounted on a single mast are referred to as a [[helicopter rotor|rotor]]. The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) defines a rotorcraft as \"supported in flight by the reactions of the air on one or more rotors\".<ref>\"ICAO Annex 7.\" Retrieved on 30 September 2009.</ref> \n\nRotorcraft generally include aircraft where one or more rotors provide lift throughout the entire flight, such as [[helicopter]]s, [[autogyro]]s, and [[gyrodyne]]s. Compound rotorcraft augment the rotor with additional thrust engines, propellers, or static lifting surfaces.\n\n==Classes of rotorcraft ==\n===Helicopter===\n\n{{Main|Helicopter}}\n\nA helicopter is a rotorcraft whose rotors are driven by the engine(s) throughout the flight to allow the helicopter to take off vertically, hover, fly forwards, backwards and laterally, as well as to land vertically. Helicopters have several different configurations of one or more main rotors.\n\nHelicopters with a single shaft-driven main lift rotor require some sort of antitorque device such as a [[tail rotor]], [[Fenestron|fantail]], or [[NOTAR]], except some rare examples of helicopters using [[tip jet]] propulsion, which generates almost no torque.\n\n===Autogyro===\n{{Main|Autogyro}}\n[[File:Autogyro D-MBHV.jpg|thumb|A German-registered autogyro]]\n\nAn autogyro (sometimes called gyrocopter, gyroplane, or rotaplane) utilizes an unpowered rotor, driven by aerodynamic forces in a state of [[Autorotation (helicopter)|autorotation]] to develop lift, and an engine-powered [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]], similar to that of a [[fixed-wing aircraft]], to provide thrust. While similar to a helicopter rotor in appearance, the autogyro's rotor must have air flowing up and through the rotor disk in order to generate rotation. Early autogyros resembled the fixed-wing aircraft of the day, with wings and a front-mounted engine and propeller in a tractor configuration to pull the aircraft through the air. Late-model autogyros feature a rear-mounted engine and propeller in a pusher configuration.\n\nThe autogyro was invented in 1920 by [[Juan de la Cierva]]. The autogyro with pusher propeller was first tested by [[Etienne Dormoy]] with his [[Buhl A-1 Autogyro]].\n\n===Gyrodyne===\n{{Main|Gyrodyne}}\n[[File:SFF 002-1055526 Fairey Rotodyne.jpg|thumb|Fairey Rotodyne prototype<ref><!--required statement per license:-->Photo: J Thinesen, [http://www.sff.n.se/ SFF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828113804/http://www.sff.n.se/ |date=2009-08-28 }} photo archive</ref>]]\n\nThe rotor of a gyrodyne is normally driven by its engine for takeoff and landing{{snd}}hovering like a helicopter{{snd}}with anti-torque and propulsion for forward flight provided by one or more propellers mounted on short or stub wings. As power is increased to the propeller, less power is required by the rotor to provide forward thrust resulting in reduced pitch angles and rotor blade flapping. At cruise speeds with most or all of the thrust being provided by the propellers, the rotor receives power only sufficient to overcome the profile drag and maintain lift. The effect is a rotorcraft operating in a more efficient manner than the freewheeling rotor of an autogyro in autorotation, minimizing the adverse effects of retreating blade stall of helicopters at higher airspeeds.\n\n===Rotor kite===\n{{Main|Rotor kite}}\nA rotor kite or gyroglider is an unpowered rotary-wing aircraft. Like an autogyro or helicopter, it relies on lift created by one or more sets of rotors in order to fly. Unlike a helicopter, autogyros and rotor kites do not have an engine powering their rotors, but while an autogyro has an engine providing forward thrust that keeps the rotor turning, a rotor kite has no engine at all, and relies on either being carried aloft and dropped from another aircraft, or by being towed into the air behind a car or boat.\n\n==Rotor configuration==\n\n===Number of blades===\nA rotary wing is characterised by the number of [[blade]]s. Typically this is between two and six per driveshaft.\n\n===Number of rotors===\nA rotorcraft may have one or more rotors. Various rotor configurations have been used:\n\n* One rotor. Powered rotors require compensation for the torque reaction causing yaw, except in the case of [[tipjet]] drive. One rotor rotorcraft are typically called [[Monocopter|monocopters]].\n* Two rotors. These typically rotate in opposite directions cancelling the torque reaction so that no tail rotor or other yaw stabiliser is needed. These rotors can be laid out as\n** [[Tandem rotors|Tandem]]{{snd}}One in front of the other.\n** [[Transverse rotors|Transverse]]{{snd}}Side by side.\n** [[Coaxial rotors|Coaxial]]{{snd}}One rotor disc above the other, with concentric drive shafts.\n** [[Intermeshing rotors|Intermeshing]]{{snd}}Twin rotors at an acute angle from each other, whose nearly-vertical driveshafts are geared together to synchronise their rotor blades so that they intermesh, also called a '''synchropter'''.\n* Three rotors. An uncommon configuration; the 1948 [[Cierva Air Horse]] had three rotors as it was not believed a single rotor of sufficient strength could be built for its size.  All three rotors turned in the same direction and yaw compensation was provided by inclining each rotor axis to generate rotor thrust components that opposed torque.\n* Four rotors.  Also referred to as the [[quadcopter]] or quadrotor. Usually two rotors turn clockwise and two counter-clockwise.\n* More than four rotors. Referred to generally as [[multirotor]]s, or sometimes individually as hexacopters and octocopter, these configurations typically have matched sets of rotors turning in opposite directions.{{citation needed|date=July 2018|reason=Previously cited sources were unreliable}} They are uncommon in full-size manned aircraft but are popular for [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs).\n\n==Stopped rotors==\nSome rotary wing aircraft are designed to stop the rotor for forward flight so that it then acts as a fixed wing. For [[VTOL|vertical flight]] and hovering it spins to act as a rotary wing or rotor, and for forward flight at speed it stops to act as a [[fixed-wing aircraft|fixed wing]] providing some or all of the lift required. Additional fixed wings may also be provided to help with stability and control and to provide auxiliary lift.\n\nAn early American proposal was the conversion of the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] with a triangular rotor wing.

In A Woman of Paris (1923) Charles Chaplin uses the north side of the park and the Ansonia in two scenes. MacArthur Park/Westlake Park and its boats figure prominently as the scene of a murder in the 1949 film noir ''[[Too Late for Tears|Killer Bait]]'' (also known as ''[[Too Late for Tears]]'') with Lizabeth Scott, Don DeFore, Dan Duryea and Arthur Kennedy. A scene from the 1977 TV movie ''[[Spider-Man (1977 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' was filmed here.  A scene from the television series Dragnet features MacArthur Park in 1967 titled \"The Bank Examiner Swindle.\" In the episode of ''[[The Fresh Prince Of Bel-air]]'' \"72 Hours\", Carlton Banks plans to conduct illegal sales of stolen merchandise in the park, hoping to prove his street cred to Will and his friends.\n\nIn the movie ''[[Training Day]]'', Jake stops two drug addicts from raping a 14-year-old girl near MacArthur Park.

Along with determined campaigns to improve community relations between the neighborhood and the police, crime rates went down through the mid-2000s.<ref>Some associated the installation of cameras with reductions in crime in the park, but others, such as reporter John Buntin, have highlighted improvements in community relations by police officers themselves: \n\"The percentage of residents saying that the police in their communities treated members of all racial and ethnic groups fairly 'almost all the time' or 'most of the time' rose from 44 percent in 2005 to 51 percent in 2009.\" In \"The LAPD Remade: How William Bratton\u2019s Police Force Drove Crime Down\u2014And Won Over Los Angeles\u2019s Minorities\" [Los Angeles] ''City Journal''  (Winter 2013); online at https://www.city-journal.org/html/lapd-remade-13526.html\nFor further analysis of the effect of surveillance cameras on crime in LA overall, with many references to MacArthur Park, see Aundreia Cameron et al., ''Measuring the Effects of Video Surveillance on Crime in Los Angeles'' (Univ. of Southern CA: School of Policy, Planning, and Development, 5 May 2008). 90 pages.

In A Woman of Paris (1923) Charles Chaplin uses the north side of the park and the Ansonia in two scenes. MacArthur Park/Westlake Park and its boats figure prominently as the scene of a murder in the 1949 film noir ''[[Too Late for Tears|Killer Bait]]'' (also known as ''[[Too Late for Tears]]'') with Lizabeth Scott, Don DeFore, Dan Duryea and Arthur Kennedy. A scene from the 1977 TV movie ''[[Spider-Man (1977 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' was filmed here.  A scene from the television series Dragnet features MacArthur Park in 1967 titled \"The Bank Examiner Swindle.\" In the episode of ''[[The Fresh Prince Of Bel-air]]'' \"72 Hours\", Carlton Banks plans to conduct illegal sales of stolen merchandise in the park, hoping to prove his street cred to Will and his friends.\n\nIn the movie ''[[Training Day]]'', Jake stops two drug addicts from raping a 14-year-old girl near MacArthur Park. MacArthur Park was also featured in the [[2001 in film|2001]] [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] film ''MacArthur Park''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0270487/|title=MacArthur Park (2001/I)|publisher=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=March 26, 2007}}</ref> MacArthur Park was featured in the [[1997 in film|1997]] film ''[[Volcano (1997 film)|Volcano]]'', as well as the [[2005 in film|2005]] film ''[[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]]''.

Entertainment DVDs and videos may be renewed one time.\n\nThe Los Angeles Public Library has many community support organizations which work with the library to raise funds and sponsor programs to enhance library service throughout the community. The Library's Rare Books Department is located in its downtown Los Angeles location. There is also an extensive selection of databases covering a wide variety of topics, many of which are available to remote users who hold an LAPL library card. Examples include full-text databases of periodicals, business directories, and language learning tools. The Central Library at 630 West 5th Street, between Grand Avenue and Flower Street in [[Downtown Los Angeles]], remains an important research library, despite the development of accessible databases and public access to the Internet.\n\nThe library also offers an online program that allows adult patrons who have not completed high school to earn their high school diploma.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Toppo|first1=Greg|title=Libraries' choice: Change or fade into oblivion|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/06/07/changing-libraries-digital-age/9862861/|accessdate=March 28, 2016|newspaper=USA Today|date=June 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Los Angeles Library Association was formed in late 1872, and by early 1873, a well-stocked reading room had opened under the first librarian, John Littlefield.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The light of learning: an illustrated history of the Los Angeles Public Library|last=Soter|first=Bernadette Dominique|publisher=Library Foundation of Los Angeles|year=1993|isbn=|location=Los Angeles|pages=19\u201320}}</ref> Aggressive expansion and growth of the system began in the 1920s. Under Library Board of Commissioners Chairman [[Orra E. Monnette]], the system was improved with a large network of branch libraries with new buildings. Thelma Jackman founded the Business & Economics section of the library sometime prior to 1970.\n\nThe original library consisted of two rooms. The larger room was called the \u201cBook Room,\u201d and the smaller room was called the \u201cConversation Room,\u201d which contained newspapers, tables, chairs, and spittoons for the chess and checkers players who gathered there.<ref name=\"jstor.org\">https://www.jstor.org/stable/25548763?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=At&searchText=the&searchText=Pleasure&searchText=of&searchText=the&searchText=Board&searchText=Women&searchText=Librarians&searchText=and&searchText=the&searchText=Los&searchText=Angeles&searchText=Public&searchText=Library%2C&searchText=1880-1905&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3DAt%2Bthe%2BPleasure%2Bof%2Bthe%2BBoard%253A%2BWomen%2BLibrarians%2Band%2Bthe%2BLos%2BAngeles%2BPublic%2BLibrary%252C%2B1880-1905%26amp%3Bacc%3Doff%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-5152%2Ftest&refreqid=search%3Ab364c8dbcf2a47a700439dfca25747cd&seq=1</ref>\n\nWomen were not initially involved in the conception and development of the Los Angeles Library Association. Mrs. John Downey was given an honorary membership out of \u201ccourtesy,\u201d but otherwise, no women were listed in the association\u2019s founding documents, women were not represented on the board, and women were denied access to the library\u2019s reading room. However, this changed in 1876 when the association decided to implement a \u201cLadies Room.\u201d While this new room did not offer any books, it did provide a number of magazines and comfortable sofa and chairs for local clubwomen to use.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/>\n\nAfter Mary Foy was appointed as the first head woman librarian in 1880, her appointment was viewed as an act of charity by Mayor Toberman, who may have thought Foy to be in need of a job. Joanne Passet even postited that Foy\u2019s nomination,and librarian nominations in general, were seen as \u201can honorable means of assisting needy men and women in the community.\u201d This notion was mostly confirmed when Foy was replaced by Jessie Gavitt, whose economic need was deemed greater than Foy\u2019s by the board.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/>\n\nThere was further speculation as to why the board decided on appointing Foy as the first head woman librarian. It may have been a political choice since she represented values that flourished in women\u2019s organizations, aiming to please the city\u2019s powerful women\u2019s clubs who may have been applying pressure.

The central tower is topped with a tiled [[mosaic]] [[pyramid]] with suns on the sides with a hand holding a torch representing the \"Light of Learning\" at the apex. Other elements include [[sphinx]]es, [[snake]]s, and celestial mosaics. It has sculptural elements by the preeminent American architectural sculptor [[Lee Lawrie]], similar to the [[Nebraska State Capitol]] in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], also designed by Goodhue. The interior of the library is decorated with various figures, statues, chandeliers, and grilles, notably a four-part [[mural]] by illustrator [[Dean Cornwell]] depicting stages of the [[History of California]] which was completed around 1933.<ref name=\"KCET\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/landofsunshine/writing-on-the-wall/central-library-murals-are-also-80-years-old.html|title=Central Library Murals Are Also 80 Years Old|first=Ed|last=Fuentes|publisher=KCET|accessdate=May 10, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521163134/http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/landofsunshine/writing-on-the-wall/central-library-murals-are-also-80-years-old.html|archivedate=May 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The building is a designated [[Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument]], and is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n===Expansion===\nThe Central Library was extensively renovated and expanded in a [[Modernist]]/[[Beaux-Arts architecture]], according to Norman Pfeiffer, the principal architect of the renovation by [[Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates]] from 1988 through 1993. It included an enormous, eight-story atrium wing dedicated to former mayor Tom Bradley. Now, the library contains an area of {{convert|538000|sqft|m2}}, and has nearly 89 miles of shelves and seating for over 1,400 people.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Central Library|url=http://www.lapl.org/about-lapl/press/central-facts|website=Los Angeles Public Library|publisher=Los Angeles Public Library|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Access needs====\nThe building's limited access had caused a number of problems. Generally, the accessible public stacks in the reading rooms only displayed about 10 to 20 percent of the actual collections of the Central Library. For anything else, a patron had to submit a request slip and a clerk would retrieve the desired material from the internal stacks. The internal stacks, contained in two concrete structures joined by a catwalk, were packed very tightly and had very little headroom. For example, while the normal reading rooms had ceilings of anywhere from 10 to 15 feet, the internal stack areas were many shelves of about six-foot height, stacked internally, so that while the public access area was about two floors plus the Science and Technology alcove, the internal stacks were approximately five or six floors. To fix this would have required substantial renovation, a cost the city was not willing to cover, especially after hours of operation were cut in response to the 1978 property tax reduction measure [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13]].\n\n====Arson Catalyst====\n[[File:Plaque honoring those fighting the Los Angeles Public Library fire of 1986.jpg|thumb|Plaque honoring those fighting the arson fire of 1986]]\nThe catalyst for the renovation was a devastating [[arson]] [[structure fire|fire]] that began in the stacks on April 29, 1986.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDXqhQMczjM |title=Library Fire 1986 |publisher=Los Angeles City Clerk |type=''YouTube'' video, 20&nbsp;mins, 5&nbsp;secs. |date=March 22, 2016 }}</ref><ref name=LAT>{{cite news |first=Carolyn |last=Kellogg |url=https://www.latimes.com/books/la-ca-jc-susan-orlean-library-20181011-htmlstory.html |title=Must Reads: Who started the 1986 fire at the Los Angeles Library?

The Library's Rare Books Department is located in its downtown Los Angeles location. There is also an extensive selection of databases covering a wide variety of topics, many of which are available to remote users who hold an LAPL library card. Examples include full-text databases of periodicals, business directories, and language learning tools. The Central Library at 630 West 5th Street, between Grand Avenue and Flower Street in [[Downtown Los Angeles]], remains an important research library, despite the development of accessible databases and public access to the Internet.\n\nThe library also offers an online program that allows adult patrons who have not completed high school to earn their high school diploma.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Toppo|first1=Greg|title=Libraries' choice: Change or fade into oblivion|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/06/07/changing-libraries-digital-age/9862861/|accessdate=March 28, 2016|newspaper=USA Today|date=June 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Los Angeles Library Association was formed in late 1872, and by early 1873, a well-stocked reading room had opened under the first librarian, John Littlefield.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The light of learning: an illustrated history of the Los Angeles Public Library|last=Soter|first=Bernadette Dominique|publisher=Library Foundation of Los Angeles|year=1993|isbn=|location=Los Angeles|pages=19\u201320}}</ref> Aggressive expansion and growth of the system began in the 1920s. Under Library Board of Commissioners Chairman [[Orra E. Monnette]], the system was improved with a large network of branch libraries with new buildings. Thelma Jackman founded the Business & Economics section of the library sometime prior to 1970.\n\nThe original library consisted of two rooms. The larger room was called the \u201cBook Room,\u201d and the smaller room was called the \u201cConversation Room,\u201d which contained newspapers, tables, chairs, and spittoons for the chess and checkers players who gathered there.<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/25548763?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=At&searchText=the&searchText=Pleasure&searchText=of&searchText=the&searchText=Board&searchText=Women&searchText=Librarians&searchText=and&searchText=the&searchText=Los&searchText=Angeles&searchText=Public&searchText=Library%2C&searchText=1880-1905&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3DAt%2Bthe%2BPleasure%2Bof%2Bthe%2BBoard%253A%2BWomen%2BLibrarians%2Band%2Bthe%2BLos%2BAngeles%2BPublic%2BLibrary%252C%2B1880-1905%26amp%3Bacc%3Doff%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-5152%2Ftest&refreqid=search%3Ab364c8dbcf2a47a700439dfca25747cd&seq=1</ref>\n\nWomen were not initially involved in the conception and development of the Los Angeles Library Association. Mrs. John Downey was given an honorary membership out of \u201ccourtesy,\u201d but otherwise, no women were listed in the association\u2019s founding documents, women were not represented on the board, and women were denied access to the library\u2019s reading room. However, this changed in 1876 when the association decided to implement a \u201cLadies Room.\u201d While this new room did not offer any books, it did provide a number of magazines and comfortable sofa and chairs for local clubwomen to use. <ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/25548763?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=At&searchText=the&searchText=Pleasure&searchText=of&searchText=the&searchText=Board&searchText=Women&searchText=Librarians&searchText=and&searchText=the&searchText=Los&searchText=Angeles&searchText=Public&searchText=Library%2C&searchText=1880-1905&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3DAt%2Bthe%2BPleasure%2Bof%2Bthe%2BBoard%253A%2BWomen%2BLibrarians%2Band%2Bthe%2BLos%2BAngeles%2BPublic%2BLibrary%252C%2B1880-1905%26amp%3Bacc%3Doff%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-5152%2Ftest&refreqid=search%3Ab364c8dbcf2a47a700439dfca25747cd&seq=1</ref>\n\nAfter Mary Foy was appointed as the first head woman librarian in 1880, her appointment was viewed as an act of charity by Mayor Toberman, who may have thought Foy to be in need of a job. Joanne Passet even postited that Foy\u2019s nomination,and librarian nominations in general, were seen as \u201can honorable means of assisting needy men and women in the community.\u201d This notion was mostly confirmed when Foy was replaced by Jessie Gavitt, whose economic need was deemed greater than Foy\u2019s by the board. <ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/25548763?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=At&searchText=the&searchText=Pleasure&searchText=of&searchText=the&searchText=Board&searchText=Women&searchText=Librarians&searchText=and&searchText=the&searchText=Los&searchText=Angeles&searchText=Public&searchText=Library%2C&searchText=1880-1905&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3DAt%2Bthe%2BPleasure%2Bof%2Bthe%2BBoard%253A%2BWomen%2BLibrarians%2Band%2Bthe%2BLos%2BAngeles%2BPublic%2BLibrary%252C%2B1880-1905%26amp%3Bacc%3Doff%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-5152%2Ftest&refreqid=search%3Ab364c8dbcf2a47a700439dfca25747cd&seq=1</ref>\n\nThere was further speculation as to why the board decided on appointing Foy as the first head woman librarian. It may have been a political choice since she represented values that flourished in women\u2019s organizations, aiming to please the city\u2019s powerful women\u2019s clubs who may have been applying pressure. It\u2019s also suggested that Foy\u2019s nomination was a financial move; John Littlefield earned a salary of $100 while Mary Foy earned $75, which included janitorial work. <ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/25548763?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=At&searchText=the&searchText=Pleasure&searchText=of&searchText=the&searchText=Board&searchText=Women&searchText=Librarians&searchText=and&searchText=the&searchText=Los&searchText=Angeles&searchText=Public&searchText=Library%2C&searchText=1880-1905&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3DAt%2Bthe%2BPleasure%2Bof%2Bthe%2BBoard%253A%2BWomen%2BLibrarians%2Band%2Bthe%2BLos%2BAngeles%2BPublic%2BLibrary%252C%2B1880-1905%26amp%3Bacc%3Doff%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-5152%2Ftest&refreqid=search%3Ab364c8dbcf2a47a700439dfca25747cd&seq=1</ref>\n\n=== City Librarians ===\n\n* 1873 to 1879: John Littlefield\n* 1879 to 1880: Patrick Connolly\n* 1880 to 1884: [[Mary Foy (librarian)|Mary Foy]]\n* 1884 to 1889 : Jessie Gavitt\n* 1889 to 1889: Lydia Prescott\n* 1889 to 1895 : [[Tessa Kelso]]\n* 1895 to 1897: Clara Bell Fowler\n* 1897 to 1900: Harriet Child Wadleigh\n* 1900 to 1905: [[Mary Letitia Jones]]\n* 1905 to 1910: [[Charles Fletcher Lummis]]\n* 1910 to 1911: Purd Wright\n* 1911 to 1933: Everett Robbins Perry\n* 1933 to 1947: [[Althea Warren]]\n* 1947 to 1969: Harold Hamill\n* 1969 to 1990: Wyman Jones\n* 1990 to 1994: [[Elizabeth Martinez (librarian)|Elizabeth Martinez]]\n*1995 to 2004: Susan Goldberg Kent\n*2004 to 2008: Fontaine Holmes\n*2009 to 2012: Martin Gomez\n* 2012 to present: John Szabo<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Library Book|last=Orlean|first=Susan|publisher=Atlantic Books|year=2018|isbn=9781782392255|location=London|pages=125, 129, 132, 139\u2013143, 173, 174, 198, 203, 307|oclc=1084749272}}</ref>\n\nMary Jones, who was appointed Librarian in 1905, was fired by the library board in favour of Charles Fletcher Lummis.

Other elements include [[sphinx]]es, [[snake]]s, and celestial mosaics. It has sculptural elements by the preeminent American architectural sculptor [[Lee Lawrie]], similar to the [[Nebraska State Capitol]] in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], also designed by Goodhue. The interior of the library is decorated with various figures, statues, chandeliers, and grilles, notably a four-part [[mural]] by illustrator [[Dean Cornwell]] depicting stages of the [[History of California]] which was completed around 1933.<ref name=\"KCET\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/landofsunshine/writing-on-the-wall/central-library-murals-are-also-80-years-old.html|title=Central Library Murals Are Also 80 Years Old|first=Ed|last=Fuentes|publisher=KCET|accessdate=May 10, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521163134/http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/landofsunshine/writing-on-the-wall/central-library-murals-are-also-80-years-old.html|archivedate=May 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The building is a designated [[Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument]], and is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n===Expansion===\nThe Central Library was extensively renovated and expanded in a [[Modernist]]/[[Beaux-Arts architecture]], according to Norman Pfeiffer, the principal architect of the renovation by [[Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates]] from 1988 through 1993. It included an enormous, eight-story atrium wing dedicated to former mayor Tom Bradley. Now, the library contains an area of {{convert|538000|sqft|m2}}, and has nearly 89 miles of shelves and seating for over 1,400 people.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Central Library|url=http://www.lapl.org/about-lapl/press/central-facts|website=Los Angeles Public Library|publisher=Los Angeles Public Library|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Access needs====\nThe building's limited access had caused a number of problems. Generally, the accessible public stacks in the reading rooms only displayed about 10 to 20 percent of the actual collections of the Central Library. For anything else, a patron had to submit a request slip and a clerk would retrieve the desired material from the internal stacks. The internal stacks, contained in two concrete structures joined by a catwalk, were packed very tightly and had very little headroom. For example, while the normal reading rooms had ceilings of anywhere from 10 to 15 feet, the internal stack areas were many shelves of about six-foot height, stacked internally, so that while the public access area was about two floors plus the Science and Technology alcove, the internal stacks were approximately five or six floors. To fix this would have required substantial renovation, a cost the city was not willing to cover, especially after hours of operation were cut in response to the 1978 property tax reduction measure [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13]].\n\n====Arson Catalyst====\n[[File:Plaque honoring those fighting the Los Angeles Public Library fire of 1986.jpg|thumb|Plaque honoring those fighting the arson fire of 1986]]\nThe catalyst for the renovation was a devastating [[arson]] [[structure fire|fire]] that began in the stacks on April 29, 1986.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDXqhQMczjM |title=Library Fire 1986 |publisher=Los Angeles City Clerk |type=''YouTube'' video, 20&nbsp;mins, 5&nbsp;secs. |date=March 22, 2016 }}</ref><ref name=LAT>{{cite news |first=Carolyn |last=Kellogg |url=https://www.latimes.com/books/la-ca-jc-susan-orlean-library-20181011-htmlstory.html |title=Must Reads: Who started the 1986 fire at the Los Angeles Library?

Conceived as a hallmark of civic pride, the Coliseum was commissioned in 1921 as a memorial to L.A. veterans of World War I. Completed in 1923, it will be the first stadium to have hosted the [[Summer Olympics]] three times: [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]], [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], and [[2028 Summer Olympics|2028]].<ref name=\"USC News 2018-03-29\"/> It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] on July 27, 1984, the day before the opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympics.<ref name=\"NPS-LANDMARK\" />\n\nThe stadium serves as the home to the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) [[USC Trojans football|Trojans football team]] of the [[Pac-12 Conference]]. USC, which operates and manages the Coliseum, granted naming rights to [[United Airlines]] in January 2018; after concerns were raised by Coliseum Commission, the airline became title sponsor of the playing field, naming it '''United Airlines Field at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum'''. The stadium is located in [[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park]], which is owned by the State of California, and across the street from USC. The Coliseum is jointly owned by the State of California, [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], City of Los Angeles and is managed and operated by the Auxiliary Services Department of the University of Southern California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aux.usc.edu|title=USC Auxiliary Services}}</ref>\n\nIt was the home of the [[Los Angeles Rams]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) from 1946 to 1979, when they moved to [[Anaheim Stadium]] in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]]. The Coliseum served as their home stadium again from 2016 to 2019 prior to the team's move to [[SoFi Stadium]] in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]]. The facility had a permanent seating capacity of 93,607 for USC football and Rams games, making it the largest football stadium in the [[Pac-12 Conference]] and the NFL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theramswire.usatoday.com/2016/12/06/los-angeles-rams-home-attendance-memorial-coliseum-san-diego-chargers/|title=Don't judge Rams home attendance based on percentage of seats filled|date=December 6, 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe stadium also was the temporary home of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] of [[Major League Baseball]] from 1958 to 1961 and was the host venue for games 3, 4, and 5 of the [[1959 World Series]]. It was the site of the [[Super Bowl I|First AFL-NFL World Championship Game]], later called Super Bowl I, and [[Super Bowl VII]]. Additionally, it has served as a home field for a number of other teams, including the [[1960 Los Angeles Chargers season|1960]] inaugural season for the [[Los Angeles Chargers]], [[History of the Los Angeles Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]] of the NFL, and [[UCLA Bruins football]].\n\nFrom 1959 to 2016, the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] was located adjacent to the Coliseum; the Sports Arena was closed in March 2016 and demolished. [[Banc of California Stadium]], a [[soccer-specific stadium]] and home of [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[Los Angeles FC]], was constructed on the former Sports Arena site and opened in April 2018.\n\nUSC began a major renovation of the stadium in early 2018.<ref name=\"coliseumrenovation.com\">{{cite web |url=http://coliseumrenovation.com/ |title=The USC Coliseum Renovation Project Website |access-date=January 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226161951/http://coliseumrenovation.com/ |archive-date=February 26, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> During the renovation project the seating capacity was  78,467 and became 77,500 upon completion in 2019.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.usc.edu/147418/l-a-coliseum-renovation-reaches-halfway-point-with-topping-off-ceremony/|title=Coliseum renovation reaches halfway point with topping-off ceremony|work=USC News|date=August 15, 2018}}</ref> The $315 million project was completed by the 2019 football season and was the first major upgrade of the stadium in twenty years.{{r|Cost $315 M}} The project included replacing the seating along with the addition of [[luxury boxes]] and club suites.\n\n==Operation==\nThe Coliseum is primarily the home of the USC Trojans football team.

When the Coliseum opened in 1923, it was the largest stadium in Los Angeles with a capacity of 75,144. In 1930, however, with the Olympics due in two years, the stadium was extended upward to seventy-nine rows seats with two tiers of tunnels, expanding the seating capacity to 101,574. The now-signature Olympic torch was added. For a time it was known as '''Olympic Stadium'''. The [[Olympic cauldron]] torch which burned through both Games remains above the peristyle at the east end of the stadium as a reminder of this, as do the Olympic rings symbols over one of the main entrances. The football field runs east to west with the press box on the south side of the stadium. The current jumbotrons to each side of the peristyle were installed in 2017 and replaced a scoreboard and video screen that towered over the peristyle dating back to 1983; they replaced a smaller scoreboard above the center arch installed in 1972, which in turn supplanted the 1937 model, one of the first all-electric scoreboards in the nation. Over the years new light towers have been placed along the north and south rims.  The large analog clock and thermometer over the office windows at either end of the peristyle were installed in 1955. In the mid- and late 1950s the press box was renovated and the \"Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum\" lettering and Olympic rings, lighted at night, were added to the eastern face of the peristyle tower.  Between the double peristyle arches at the east end is the Coliseum's \"Court of Honor\"\u2014plaques recognizing many of the memorable events and participants in Coliseum history, including a full list of 1932 and 1984 Olympic gold medalists. (The complete roster of honorees can be seen below.)\n\n===Renovations===\nFor many years the Coliseum was capable of seating over 100,000 spectators. In 1964 the stadium underwent its first major renovation in over three decades. Most of the original pale green wood-and-metal bench seating was replaced by individual theater-type chairs of dark red, beige, and yellow; these seats remained until 2018, though the yellow color was eliminated in the 1970s. The [[seating capacity]] was reduced to approximately 93,000.\n\nThe Coliseum was problematic as an NFL venue. At various times in its history, it was either the largest or one of the largest stadiums in the NFL. While this allowed the Rams and Raiders to set many NFL attendance records, it also made it extremely difficult to sell out. The NFL amended its [[National Football League television blackout policies|blackout rule]] to allow games to be televised locally if they were sold out 72 hours before kickoff. However, due to the Coliseum's large size, Rams (and later Raiders) games were often blacked out in [[Southern California]] even in the teams' best years.\n\nPartly due to this, from 1964 to the late 1970s it was common practice to shift the playing field to the closed end of the stadium and install end zone bleachers in front of the peristyle, limiting further the number of seats available for sale. For [[University of Southern California|USC]]&ndash;[[UCLA]] and USC-[[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] games, which often attracted crowds upward of 90,000, the bleachers were moved eastward and the field was re-marked in its original position. When a larger east grandstand was installed in 1977\u20131978 at the behest of Rams owner [[Carroll Rosenbloom]], the capacity was just 71,500. With the upcoming 1984 Summer Olympic Games, a new track was installed and the playing field permanently placed inside it.  However, the combination of the stadium's large, relatively shallow design, along with the presence of the track between the playing field and the stands, meant that some of the original end zone seats were as far from the field by the equivalent length of another football field. To address these and other problems, the Coliseum underwent a $15 million renovation before the 1993 football season which included the following:<ref name=USCColiseum />\n\n* The field was lowered by {{convert|11|ft|m|1}} and 14 new rows of seats replaced the running track, bringing the first row of seats closer to the playing field (a maximum distance of {{convert|54|ft|m|1}} at the eastern 30-yard-line).\n* A portable seating section was built between the eastern endline and the peristyle bleachers (the stands are removed for concerts and similar events).\n* The locker rooms and public restrooms were modernized.\n* The bleachers were replaced with individual seating.<ref>[http://www.stadiumsofnfl.com/past/LAColiseum.htm Stadiums of the NFL-Los Angeles Coliseum-Los Angeles Rams/Raiders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205140916/http://www.stadiumsofnfl.com/past/LAColiseum.htm |date=February 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, for Raiders home games, [[tarpaulin]]s were placed over seldom-sold sections, reducing [[seating capacity]] to approximately 65,000. The changes were anticipated to be the first of a multi-stage renovation designed by [[HNTB]] that would have turned the Coliseum into a split-bowl stadium with two levels of mezzanine suites (the peristyle end would have been left as is). However, after the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]], the $93 million was required from government agencies (including the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]) to repair earthquake damage, and the renovations demanded by the Raiders were put on hold indefinitely. The Raiders then redirected their efforts toward a proposed stadium at [[SoFi Stadium]] in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] before  electing to move back to the [[Oakland Coliseum]] prior to the 1995 NFL season.

The Dodgers played here until [[Dodger Stadium]] was completed in time for the 1962 season.  Even allowing for its temporary status, the Coliseum was extremely ill-suited for baseball due to the fundamentally different sizes and shapes of football and baseball fields. A baseball field requires roughly 2.5 times more area than a football gridiron, but the playing surface was just barely large enough to accommodate a baseball diamond. As a result, foul territory was almost nonexistent down the first base line, but was very expansive down the third base line with a very large [[backstop (baseball)|backstop]] for the catcher. Sight lines also left much to be desired; some seats were as far as {{convert|710|ft|m|0}} from the plate. Also, from baseball's point of view, the locker rooms were huge, because they were designed for [[American football|football]] (not baseball) teams.\n\nIn order to shoehorn even an approximation of a baseball field onto the playing surface, the left-field fence was set at only {{convert|251|ft|m}} from the plate. This seemed likely to ensure that there would be many \"[[Chinese home run]]s\", as such short shots were called at the time, and sportswriters began jokingly referring to the improvised park as \"O'Malley's Chinese Theatre\"<ref name=\"Mover and Shaker\">{{cite book|last1=McCue|first1=Andy|title=Mover and Shaker: Walter O'Malley, the Dodgers, and Baseball's Westward Expansion|date=2014|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|isbn=9780803255050|pages=221\u201322|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vh0KAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA221|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}</ref> or \"The House that [[Charlie Chan]] Built\", drawing protests from the [[Chinese American]] community in the Los Angeles area.<ref name=\"Close Shave\">{{cite book|last1=Szalontai|first1=James D.|title=Close Shave: The Life and Times of Baseball's Sal Maglie|date=2002|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=9780786411894|page=356|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sxQ0aNbCw-kC&pg=PA356|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}</ref> They also expressed concern that cherished home run records, especially [[Babe Ruth]]'s 1927 seasonal mark of 60, might easily fall as a result of {{convert|250|foot|adj=on}} pop flies going over the left-field fence. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' titled a critical [[editorial]] \"Every Sixth Hit a Homer!\" <ref name=\"Mover and Shaker\" /> Players, too, complained, with [[Milwaukee Braves (1953\u201365)|Milwaukee Braves]]' [[ace (baseball)|ace]] [[Warren Spahn]] calling for a rule that would require any home run to travel at least {{convert|300|ft}} before it could be considered a home run.<ref name=\"2008 NYT story\">{{cite news|last=Schwarz|first=Alan|authorlink=Alan Schwarz|title=201 Feet to Left, 440 Feet to Right: Dodgers Play the Coliseum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/26/sports/baseball/26coliseum.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 26, 2008|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Commissioner of Baseball|Baseball Commissioner]] [[Ford Frick]] ordered the Dodgers to erect a {{convert|42|ft|m|1}} screen in left field to prevent pop flies from becoming home runs.

In the first week of play during [[1959 Major League Baseball season|the 1959 season]], the media's worst preseason fears seemed to be realized when 24 home runs were hit in the Coliseum, three of them by [[Chicago Cubs]] outfielder [[Lee Walls]], not especially distinguished as a hitter. But pitchers soon adapted, throwing outside to right-handed hitters, requiring them to pull the bat hard if they wanted to hit toward left. Perhaps no player took better advantage than Dodgers outfielder [[Wally Moon]], who figured out how to hit high fly balls that dropped almost vertically just behind the screen. By season's end, he had hit 19 homers, all but 5 of them in the Coliseum. In recognition, such homers were dubbed \"[[Moonshot (baseball)|Moon Shots]].\"<ref name=\"2008 NYT story\" />\n\nNonetheless, the number of home runs alarmed Frick enough that he ordered the Dodgers to build a second screen in the stands, {{convert|333|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the plate. A ball would have had to clear both screens to be a home run; if it cleared the first, it would have been a ground-rule double. However, the Dodgers discovered that the earthquake safety provisions of the Los Angeles building code forbade construction of a second screen.<ref name=\"2008 NYT story\" />\n\nUnable to compel the Dodgers to fix the situation, the major leagues passed a note to Rule 1.04 stating that any stadium constructed after June 1, 1958, must provide a minimum distance of {{convert|325|ft|m|0}} down each foul line. Also, when the expansion [[Los Angeles Angels]] joined the [[American League]] for 1961, Frick rejected their original request to use the Coliseum as a temporary facility.<ref name=\"TBT\">{{cite book |title=The Team-by-Team Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball |last=Purdy |first=Dennis |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company|Workman]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-7611-3943-5 |pages= }}</ref>  This rule was revoked (or perhaps, simply ignored) when the Baltimore Orioles launched the \"Retro Ballpark\" era in 1993, with the opening of Camden Yards.  With a right field corner of only {{convert|318|ft}}, this fell short.  However, baseball fans heartily welcomed the \"new/old\" style, and all new ballparks since then have been allowed to set their own distances.\n\n[[File:LA Coliseum 1959 World Series.jpg|thumb|240px|The Coliseum during the [[1959 World Series]]]]\nLate that season, the screen figured in the National League [[pennant (sports)|pennant]] race. The Braves were playing the Dodgers in the Coliseum on September 15, 1959, and [[Joe Adcock]] hit a ball that cleared the screen but hit a steel girder behind it and got stuck in the mesh. According to the ground rules, this should have been a home run. However, the umpires ruled it a ground-rule double. Then the fans shook the screen, causing the ball to fall into the seats. The umpires changed the call to a homer, only to change their minds again and rule it a ground-rule double.<ref name=\"Cathedrals\"/>  Adcock was left stranded on second. The game was tied at the end of nine innings and the Dodgers won it in the tenth inning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/LAN/LAN195909150.shtml|title=Milwaukee Braves at Los Angeles Dodgers Box Score, September 15, 1959 - Baseball-Reference.com|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> At the end of the regular season, the Dodgers and Braves finished in a tie. The Dodgers won the ensuing playoff and went on to win the [[1959 World Series|World Series]].\n\nAlthough less than ideal for baseball due to its poor sight lines and short dimensions (left field at {{convert|251|ft}} [mentioned above] and power alleys at {{convert|320|ft|m}}) it was ideally suited for large paying crowds. Each of the three games of the 1959 World Series played there drew over 92,000 fans, with game 5 drawing 92,706, a [[Major League Baseball attendance records|record]] unlikely to be seriously threatened anytime soon, given the smaller seating capacities of today's baseball parks. A May 1959 exhibition game between the Dodgers and the [[New York Yankees]] in honor of legendary catcher [[Roy Campanella]] drew 93,103, the largest crowd ever to see a baseball game in the Western Hemisphere until an exhibition game in 2008 between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the [[Boston Red Sox]] to mark the 50th anniversary of MLB in Los Angeles. The Coliseum also hosted the second [[1959 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (second game)|1959]] [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]].\n\nThe Coliseum was also the site of John F.

It also hosted the [[Super Bowl VII|Super Bowl in 1973]], but future Super Bowls in the Los Angeles region would instead be hosted at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]], which has never had an NFL tenant. The venue was also the site of the NFL [[Pro Bowl]] from [[1951 NFL season|1951]] to [[1972 NFL season|1972]] and again in [[1979 NFL season|1979]].\n\nIn [[List of American Football League seasons#1960 .5B1.5D|1960]], the [[American Football League]]'s [[Los Angeles Chargers]] played at the Coliseum before relocating to San Diego the next year; the team moved back to its original home in [[2017 NFL season|2017]].\n\nThe [[United States men's national soccer team]] played its first match as the stadium in 1965, losing to Mexico in a 1966 World Cup qualifier.

The September 27 show was released through Springsteen's website on April 5, 2019.\n\n[[U2]] played at the stadium on leg 3 of their breakout Joshua Tree tour in 1987 with two consecutive nights, November 17 and 18, 1987.  They later returned on their Pop Mart tour, June 21, 1997.\n\nLos Angeles natives [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] played at the stadium on December 13, 1987 during the second leg of their ''[[Girls, Girls, Girls (M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce album)|\"Girls, Girls, Girls\"]]'' World Tour with fellow [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and Los Angeles-based band [[Guns N' Roses]] as the opening act. M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce at the time was one of the most popular and successful musical acts on the planet, while Guns N' Roses was one of the largest up-and-coming acts. Guns N' Roses would later return for four shows in October 1989 as the opening act for The Rolling Stones, then again on September 27, 1992 on their infamous co-headlining [[Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour|tour]] with [[Metallica]].\n\nThe stadium played host to The [[Monsters of Rock Tour 1988|Monsters of Rock]] Festival Tour, featuring [[Van Halen]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Dokken]], Metallica and [[Kingdom Come (band)|Kingdom Come]], on July 24, 1988. A second show was planned to take place on the 23rd, but was later canceled.\n\nThe stadium also played host to [[Amnesty International]]'s [[Human Rights Now!]] Benefit Concert on September 21, 1988. The show was headlined by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Peter Gabriel]] and also featured Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band, [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Youssou N'Dour]] and [[Joan Baez]].\n\n====1990s\u20132000s====\nThe Raiders began looking to move out of the Coliseum as early as 1986. In addition to the delays in renovating the stadium, they never drew well; even after they won [[Super Bowl XVIII]] in 1984, they had trouble filling it. The NFL scheduled all of the Raiders' appearances on [[Monday Night Football]] as road games since the Los Angeles market would have been blacked out due to the Coliseum not being sold out. Finally, in [[1995 NFL season|1995]], the Raiders left Los Angeles and returned to Oakland, leaving the Coliseum without a professional football tenant for the first time since the close of World War II.\n\nIn the mid-1990s the Coliseum was planned to be the home of the Los Angeles Blaze, a charter franchise of the [[United Baseball League (proposed)|United League]] (UL) which was planned to be a third league of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB).\n\nThe [[Legends Football League]] began as a halftime spectacular known as the [[Lingerie Bowl]]. The first 3 years (2004, 2005, 2006) were played at the Coliseum. From 2009 to 2011, a couple of [[Los Angeles Temptation]] games were played in the Coliseum. Beginning in 2015, the Temptation resumed playing at the Coliseum after 3 seasons at [[Citizens Business Bank Arena]] in Ontario.\n\nThe 1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup soccer tournament was also held at the Coliseum. The [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]] beat [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] in the final. The Coliseum also staged the final match of the Gold Cup in the [[1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup|1996]], [[1998 CONCACAF Gold Cup|1998]], and [[2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2000]] tournaments. In October 2000, United States played its last match at the stadium in a friendly versus Mexico. Since then, the team has preferred the [[Rose Bowl Stadium]] and [[Dignity Health Sports Park]] as home stadiums in the Greater Los Angeles.\n\nThe stadium hosted the [[K-1 Dynamite!! USA]] [[mixed martial arts]] event. The promoters claimed that 54,000 people attended the event, which would have set a new attendance record for a mixed martial arts event in the United States; however, other officials estimated the crowd between 20,000 and 30,000.<ref>{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Springer|url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/college/usc/la-sp-mma3jun03,1,2027204.story|title=Morton doesn't last one round|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 3, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1959, the Dodgers had hosted an exhibition game against the reigning World Series champion [[New York Yankees]] at the Coliseum, a game which drew over 93,000 people.

The team's first regular-season home game, on September 18 against the [[Seattle Seahawks]], attracted 91,046\u2014the largest attendance for a Rams game at the Coliseum since 1959.\n\n;Major League Baseball\nContemporary baseball guides listed the theoretical baseball [[seating capacity]] as 92,500. Thousands of east-end seats were very far from home plate, and were not sold unless needed. The largest regular season attendance was 78,672, the Dodgers' home debut in the Coliseum, against the [[San Francisco Giants]] on April 18, 1958.\n\nThe May 7, 1959, exhibition game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the [[1958 World Series]] Champion [[New York Yankees]], in honor of disabled former Dodgers catcher [[Roy Campanella]], drew 93,103, which was a Major League Baseball record prior to 2008.\n\nAll three Dodgers home games in the [[1959 World Series]] with the [[Chicago White Sox]] exceeded 90,000 attendance. Game 5 drew 92,706 fans, a major league record for a non-exhibition game.\n\nThe attendance for the exhibition game on March 29, 2008, between the [[Boston Red Sox]] and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], was 115,300,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/news/boxscore.jsp?gid=2008_03_29_bosmlb_lanmlb_1&c_id=mlb|title=Boxscore: Boston vs. LA Dodgers - March 29, 2008|website=Major League Baseball}}</ref> setting a new [[Guinness World Record]] for attendance at a baseball game.

Conceived as a hallmark of civic pride, the Coliseum was commissioned in 1921 as a memorial to L.A. veterans of World War I. Completed in 1923, it will be the first stadium to have hosted the [[Summer Olympics]] three times: [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]], [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], and [[2028 Summer Olympics|2028]].<ref name=\"USC News 2018-03-29\"/> It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] on July 27, 1984, the day before the opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympics.<ref name=\"NPS-LANDMARK\" />\n\nThe stadium serves as the home to the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) [[USC Trojans football|Trojans football team]] of the [[Pac-12 Conference]]. USC, which operates and manages the Coliseum, granted naming rights to [[United Airlines]] in January 2018; after concerns were raised by Coliseum Commission, the airline became title sponsor of the playing field, naming it '''United Airlines Field at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum'''. The stadium is located in [[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park]], which is owned by the State of California, and across the street from USC. The Coliseum is jointly owned by the State of California, [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], City of Los Angeles and is managed and operated by the Auxiliary Services Department of the University of Southern California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aux.usc.edu|title=USC Auxiliary Services}}</ref>\n\nIt was the home of the [[Los Angeles Rams]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) from 1946 to 1979, when they moved to [[Anaheim Stadium]] in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]]. The Coliseum served as their home stadium again from 2016 to 2019 prior to the team's move to [[SoFi Stadium]] in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]]. The facility had a permanent seating capacity of 93,607 for USC football and Rams games, making it the largest football stadium in the [[Pac-12 Conference]] and the NFL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theramswire.usatoday.com/2016/12/06/los-angeles-rams-home-attendance-memorial-coliseum-san-diego-chargers/|title=Don't judge Rams home attendance based on percentage of seats filled|date=December 6, 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe stadium also was the temporary home of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] of [[Major League Baseball]] from 1958 to 1961 and was the host venue for games 3, 4, and 5 of the [[1959 World Series]]. It was the site of the [[Super Bowl I|First AFL-NFL World Championship Game]], later called Super Bowl I, and [[Super Bowl VII]]. Additionally, it has served as a home field for a number of other teams, including the [[1960 Los Angeles Chargers season|1960]] inaugural season for the [[Los Angeles Chargers]], [[History of the Los Angeles Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]] of the NFL, and [[UCLA Bruins football]].\n\nFrom 1959 to 2016, the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] was located adjacent to the Coliseum; the Sports Arena was closed in March 2016 and demolished. [[Banc of California Stadium]], a [[soccer-specific stadium]] and home of [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[Los Angeles FC]], was constructed on the former Sports Arena site and opened in April 2018.\n\nUSC began a major renovation of the stadium in early 2018.<ref name=\"coliseumrenovation.com\">{{cite web |url=http://coliseumrenovation.com/ |title=The USC Coliseum Renovation Project Website |access-date=January 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226161951/http://coliseumrenovation.com/ |archive-date=February 26, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> During the renovation project the seating capacity was  78,467 and became 77,500 upon completion in 2019.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.usc.edu/147418/l-a-coliseum-renovation-reaches-halfway-point-with-topping-off-ceremony/|title=Coliseum renovation reaches halfway point with topping-off ceremony|work=USC News|date=August 15, 2018}}</ref> The $315 million project was completed by the 2019 football season and was the first major upgrade of the stadium in twenty years.{{r|Cost $315 M}} The project included replacing the seating along with the addition of [[luxury boxes]] and club suites.\n\n==Operation==\nThe Coliseum is primarily the home of the USC Trojans football team.

When the Coliseum opened in 1923, it was the largest stadium in Los Angeles with a capacity of 75,144. In 1930, however, with the Olympics due in two years, the stadium was extended upward to seventy-nine rows seats with two tiers of tunnels, expanding the seating capacity to 101,574. The now-signature Olympic torch was added. For a time it was known as '''Olympic Stadium'''. The [[Olympic cauldron]] torch which burned through both Games remains above the peristyle at the east end of the stadium as a reminder of this, as do the Olympic rings symbols over one of the main entrances. The football field runs east to west with the press box on the south side of the stadium. The current jumbotrons to each side of the peristyle were installed in 2017 and replaced a scoreboard and video screen that towered over the peristyle dating back to 1983; they replaced a smaller scoreboard above the center arch installed in 1972, which in turn supplanted the 1937 model, one of the first all-electric scoreboards in the nation. Over the years new light towers have been placed along the north and south rims.  The large analog clock and thermometer over the office windows at either end of the peristyle were installed in 1955. In the mid- and late 1950s the press box was renovated and the \"Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum\" lettering and Olympic rings, lighted at night, were added to the eastern face of the peristyle tower.  Between the double peristyle arches at the east end is the Coliseum's \"Court of Honor\"\u2014plaques recognizing many of the memorable events and participants in Coliseum history, including a full list of 1932 and 1984 Olympic gold medalists. (The complete roster of honorees can be seen below.)\n\n===Renovations===\nFor many years the Coliseum was capable of seating over 100,000 spectators. In 1964 the stadium underwent its first major renovation in over three decades. Most of the original pale green wood-and-metal bench seating was replaced by individual theater-type chairs of dark red, beige, and yellow; these seats remained until 2018, though the yellow color was eliminated in the 1970s. The [[seating capacity]] was reduced to approximately 93,000.\n\nThe Coliseum was problematic as an NFL venue. At various times in its history, it was either the largest or one of the largest stadiums in the NFL. While this allowed the Rams and Raiders to set many NFL attendance records, it also made it extremely difficult to sell out. The NFL amended its [[National Football League television blackout policies|blackout rule]] to allow games to be televised locally if they were sold out 72 hours before kickoff. However, due to the Coliseum's large size, Rams (and later Raiders) games were often blacked out in [[Southern California]] even in the teams' best years.\n\nPartly due to this, from 1964 to the late 1970s it was common practice to shift the playing field to the closed end of the stadium and install end zone bleachers in front of the peristyle, limiting further the number of seats available for sale. For [[University of Southern California|USC]]&ndash;[[UCLA]] and USC-[[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] games, which often attracted crowds upward of 90,000, the bleachers were moved eastward and the field was re-marked in its original position. When a larger east grandstand was installed in 1977\u20131978 at the behest of Rams owner [[Carroll Rosenbloom]], the capacity was just 71,500. With the upcoming 1984 Summer Olympic Games, a new track was installed and the playing field permanently placed inside it.  However, the combination of the stadium's large, relatively shallow design, along with the presence of the track between the playing field and the stands, meant that some of the original end zone seats were as far from the field by the equivalent length of another football field. To address these and other problems, the Coliseum underwent a $15 million renovation before the 1993 football season which included the following:<ref name=USCColiseum />\n\n* The field was lowered by {{convert|11|ft|m|1}} and 14 new rows of seats replaced the running track, bringing the first row of seats closer to the playing field (a maximum distance of {{convert|54|ft|m|1}} at the eastern 30-yard-line).\n* A portable seating section was built between the eastern endline and the peristyle bleachers (the stands are removed for concerts and similar events).\n* The locker rooms and public restrooms were modernized.\n* The bleachers were replaced with individual seating.<ref>[http://www.stadiumsofnfl.com/past/LAColiseum.htm Stadiums of the NFL-Los Angeles Coliseum-Los Angeles Rams/Raiders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205140916/http://www.stadiumsofnfl.com/past/LAColiseum.htm |date=February 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, for Raiders home games, [[tarpaulin]]s were placed over seldom-sold sections, reducing [[seating capacity]] to approximately 65,000. The changes were anticipated to be the first of a multi-stage renovation designed by [[HNTB]] that would have turned the Coliseum into a split-bowl stadium with two levels of mezzanine suites (the peristyle end would have been left as is). However, after the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]], the $93 million was required from government agencies (including the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]) to repair earthquake damage, and the renovations demanded by the Raiders were put on hold indefinitely. The Raiders then redirected their efforts toward a proposed stadium at [[SoFi Stadium]] in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] before  electing to move back to the [[Oakland Coliseum]] prior to the 1995 NFL season. The last element of the Northridge earthquake repairs was the replacement of the condemned press box with a new press box in 1995.\n\n====New videoboard====\nIn August 2011, construction began on the Coliseum's west end on a new {{convert|6000|sqfoot|adj=on}} [[High-definition video|HD video]] scoreboard, accompanying the existing video scoreboard on the peristyle (east end) of the stadium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usctrojans.com/blog/2011/04/coliseum-video-board.html|title=USC Official Athletic Site \u2013 USCTrojans.com|website=www.usctrojans.com}}</ref> The video scoreboard officially went into operation on September 3, 2011, at USC football's home opener versus the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|University of Minnesota]], with the game being televised on [[ABC College Football|ABC]].\n\n====2018\u20132019 renovation project====\nAfter USC took over the Coliseum master lease in 2013, they began making plans for major renovations needed and as stipulated in the master lease agreement.

When USC and UCLA [[UCLA\u2013USC rivalry#Football rivalry|played each other]], the \"home\" team (USC in odd-numbered years, UCLA in even), occupied the north sideline and bench, and its band and rooters sat on the north side of the stadium; the \"visiting\" team and its contingent took to the south (press box) side of the stadium.

The Dodgers played here until [[Dodger Stadium]] was completed in time for the 1962 season.  Even allowing for its temporary status, the Coliseum was extremely ill-suited for baseball due to the fundamentally different sizes and shapes of football and baseball fields. A baseball field requires roughly 2.5 times more area than a football gridiron, but the playing surface was just barely large enough to accommodate a baseball diamond. As a result, foul territory was almost nonexistent down the first base line, but was very expansive down the third base line with a very large [[backstop (baseball)|backstop]] for the catcher. Sight lines also left much to be desired; some seats were as far as {{convert|710|ft|m|0}} from the plate. Also, from baseball's point of view, the locker rooms were huge, because they were designed for [[American football|football]] (not baseball) teams.\n\nIn order to shoehorn even an approximation of a baseball field onto the playing surface, the left-field fence was set at only {{convert|251|ft|m}} from the plate. This seemed likely to ensure that there would be many \"[[Chinese home run]]s\", as such short shots were called at the time, and sportswriters began jokingly referring to the improvised park as \"O'Malley's Chinese Theatre\"<ref name=\"Mover and Shaker\">{{cite book|last1=McCue|first1=Andy|title=Mover and Shaker: Walter O'Malley, the Dodgers, and Baseball's Westward Expansion|date=2014|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|isbn=9780803255050|pages=221\u201322|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vh0KAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA221|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}</ref> or \"The House that [[Charlie Chan]] Built\", drawing protests from the [[Chinese American]] community in the Los Angeles area.<ref name=\"Close Shave\">{{cite book|last1=Szalontai|first1=James D.|title=Close Shave: The Life and Times of Baseball's Sal Maglie|date=2002|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=9780786411894|page=356|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sxQ0aNbCw-kC&pg=PA356|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}</ref> They also expressed concern that cherished home run records, especially [[Babe Ruth]]'s 1927 seasonal mark of 60, might easily fall as a result of {{convert|250|foot|adj=on}} pop flies going over the left-field fence. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' titled a critical [[editorial]] \"Every Sixth Hit a Homer!\" <ref name=\"Mover and Shaker\" /> Players, too, complained, with [[Milwaukee Braves (1953\u201365)|Milwaukee Braves]]' [[ace (baseball)|ace]] [[Warren Spahn]] calling for a rule that would require any home run to travel at least {{convert|300|ft}} before it could be considered a home run.<ref name=\"2008 NYT story\">{{cite news|last=Schwarz|first=Alan|authorlink=Alan Schwarz|title=201 Feet to Left, 440 Feet to Right: Dodgers Play the Coliseum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/26/sports/baseball/26coliseum.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 26, 2008|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Commissioner of Baseball|Baseball Commissioner]] [[Ford Frick]] ordered the Dodgers to erect a {{convert|42|ft|m|1}} screen in left field to prevent pop flies from becoming home runs.

In the first week of play during [[1959 Major League Baseball season|the 1959 season]], the media's worst preseason fears seemed to be realized when 24 home runs were hit in the Coliseum, three of them by [[Chicago Cubs]] outfielder [[Lee Walls]], not especially distinguished as a hitter. But pitchers soon adapted, throwing outside to right-handed hitters, requiring them to pull the bat hard if they wanted to hit toward left. Perhaps no player took better advantage than Dodgers outfielder [[Wally Moon]], who figured out how to hit high fly balls that dropped almost vertically just behind the screen. By season's end, he had hit 19 homers, all but 5 of them in the Coliseum. In recognition, such homers were dubbed \"[[Moonshot (baseball)|Moon Shots]].\"<ref name=\"2008 NYT story\" />\n\nNonetheless, the number of home runs alarmed Frick enough that he ordered the Dodgers to build a second screen in the stands, {{convert|333|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the plate. A ball would have had to clear both screens to be a home run; if it cleared the first, it would have been a ground-rule double. However, the Dodgers discovered that the earthquake safety provisions of the Los Angeles building code forbade construction of a second screen.<ref name=\"2008 NYT story\" />\n\nUnable to compel the Dodgers to fix the situation, the major leagues passed a note to Rule 1.04 stating that any stadium constructed after June 1, 1958, must provide a minimum distance of {{convert|325|ft|m|0}} down each foul line. Also, when the expansion [[Los Angeles Angels]] joined the [[American League]] for 1961, Frick rejected their original request to use the Coliseum as a temporary facility.<ref name=\"TBT\">{{cite book |title=The Team-by-Team Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball |last=Purdy |first=Dennis |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company|Workman]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-7611-3943-5 |pages= }}</ref>  This rule was revoked (or perhaps, simply ignored) when the Baltimore Orioles launched the \"Retro Ballpark\" era in 1993, with the opening of Camden Yards.  With a right field corner of only {{convert|318|ft}}, this fell short.  However, baseball fans heartily welcomed the \"new/old\" style, and all new ballparks since then have been allowed to set their own distances.\n\n[[File:LA Coliseum 1959 World Series.jpg|thumb|240px|The Coliseum during the [[1959 World Series]]]]\nLate that season, the screen figured in the National League [[pennant (sports)|pennant]] race. The Braves were playing the Dodgers in the Coliseum on September 15, 1959, and [[Joe Adcock]] hit a ball that cleared the screen but hit a steel girder behind it and got stuck in the mesh. According to the ground rules, this should have been a home run. However, the umpires ruled it a ground-rule double. Then the fans shook the screen, causing the ball to fall into the seats. The umpires changed the call to a homer, only to change their minds again and rule it a ground-rule double.<ref name=\"Cathedrals\"/>  Adcock was left stranded on second. The game was tied at the end of nine innings and the Dodgers won it in the tenth inning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/LAN/LAN195909150.shtml|title=Milwaukee Braves at Los Angeles Dodgers Box Score, September 15, 1959 - Baseball-Reference.com|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> At the end of the regular season, the Dodgers and Braves finished in a tie. The Dodgers won the ensuing playoff and went on to win the [[1959 World Series|World Series]].\n\nAlthough less than ideal for baseball due to its poor sight lines and short dimensions (left field at {{convert|251|ft}} [mentioned above] and power alleys at {{convert|320|ft|m}}) it was ideally suited for large paying crowds. Each of the three games of the 1959 World Series played there drew over 92,000 fans, with game 5 drawing 92,706, a [[Major League Baseball attendance records|record]] unlikely to be seriously threatened anytime soon, given the smaller seating capacities of today's baseball parks. A May 1959 exhibition game between the Dodgers and the [[New York Yankees]] in honor of legendary catcher [[Roy Campanella]] drew 93,103, the largest crowd ever to see a baseball game in the Western Hemisphere until an exhibition game in 2008 between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the [[Boston Red Sox]] to mark the 50th anniversary of MLB in Los Angeles. The Coliseum also hosted the second [[1959 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (second game)|1959]] [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]].\n\nThe Coliseum was also the site of John F.

The Coliseum was the site of the very first [[Super Bowl I|NFL-AFL Championship Game]] in January 1967, an event since renamed the [[Super Bowl]]. It also hosted the [[Super Bowl VII|Super Bowl in 1973]], but future Super Bowls in the Los Angeles region would instead be hosted at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]], which has never had an NFL tenant. The venue was also the site of the NFL [[Pro Bowl]] from [[1951 NFL season|1951]] to [[1972 NFL season|1972]] and again in [[1979 NFL season|1979]].\n\nIn [[List of American Football League seasons#1960 .5B1.5D|1960]], the [[American Football League]]'s [[Los Angeles Chargers]] played at the Coliseum before relocating to San Diego the next year; the team moved back to its original home in [[2017 NFL season|2017]].\n\nThe [[United States men's national soccer team]] played its first match as the stadium in 1965, losing to Mexico in a 1966 World Cup qualifier.

Over 100,000 Black residents of Los Angeles attended this concert for African American pride. Later, in 1973, a documentary was released about the concert.\n\nIn 1973, [[Evel Knievel]] used the entire distance of the stadium to jump 50 stacked cars at the stadium.

In this capacity, the stadium also is the site of the longest professional [[American football]] game in history; a triple-overtime game on June 30, 1984 (a few weeks before the start of the 1984 Summer Olympics) between the Express and the [[Michigan Panthers]], which was decided on a 24-yard game-winning touchdown by Mel Gray of the Express, 3:33 into the third overtime to give Los Angeles a 27\u201321 win.

Guns N' Roses would later return for four shows in October 1989 as the opening act for The Rolling Stones, then again on September 27, 1992 on their infamous co-headlining [[Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour|tour]] with [[Metallica]].\n\nThe stadium played host to The [[Monsters of Rock Tour 1988|Monsters of Rock]] Festival Tour, featuring [[Van Halen]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Dokken]], Metallica and [[Kingdom Come (band)|Kingdom Come]], on July 24, 1988. A second show was planned to take place on the 23rd, but was later canceled.\n\nThe stadium also played host to [[Amnesty International]]'s [[Human Rights Now!]] Benefit Concert on September 21, 1988. The show was headlined by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Peter Gabriel]] and also featured Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band, [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Youssou N'Dour]] and [[Joan Baez]].\n\n====1990s\u20132000s====\nThe Raiders began looking to move out of the Coliseum as early as 1986. In addition to the delays in renovating the stadium, they never drew well; even after they won [[Super Bowl XVIII]] in 1984, they had trouble filling it. The NFL scheduled all of the Raiders' appearances on [[Monday Night Football]] as road games since the Los Angeles market would have been blacked out due to the Coliseum not being sold out. Finally, in [[1995 NFL season|1995]], the Raiders left Los Angeles and returned to Oakland, leaving the Coliseum without a professional football tenant for the first time since the close of World War II.\n\nIn the mid-1990s the Coliseum was planned to be the home of the Los Angeles Blaze, a charter franchise of the [[United Baseball League (proposed)|United League]] (UL) which was planned to be a third league of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB).\n\nThe [[Legends Football League]] began as a halftime spectacular known as the [[Lingerie Bowl]]. The first 3 years (2004, 2005, 2006) were played at the Coliseum. From 2009 to 2011, a couple of [[Los Angeles Temptation]] games were played in the Coliseum. Beginning in 2015, the Temptation resumed playing at the Coliseum after 3 seasons at [[Citizens Business Bank Arena]] in Ontario.\n\nThe 1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup soccer tournament was also held at the Coliseum. The [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]] beat [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] in the final. The Coliseum also staged the final match of the Gold Cup in the [[1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup|1996]], [[1998 CONCACAF Gold Cup|1998]], and [[2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2000]] tournaments. In October 2000, United States played its last match at the stadium in a friendly versus Mexico. Since then, the team has preferred the [[Rose Bowl Stadium]] and [[Dignity Health Sports Park]] as home stadiums in the Greater Los Angeles.\n\nThe stadium hosted the [[K-1 Dynamite!! USA]] [[mixed martial arts]] event. The promoters claimed that 54,000 people attended the event, which would have set a new attendance record for a mixed martial arts event in the United States; however, other officials estimated the crowd between 20,000 and 30,000.<ref>{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Springer|url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/college/usc/la-sp-mma3jun03,1,2027204.story|title=Morton doesn't last one round|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 3, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1959, the Dodgers had hosted an exhibition game against the reigning World Series champion [[New York Yankees]] at the Coliseum, a game which drew over 93,000 people.

{"title_page": "Year 1900 problem", "text_new": "The '''year 1900 problem''' concerns the misinterpretation of years recorded by only their last two digits, and whether they occurred before or after the year 1900. Unlike the [[year 2000 problem]], it is not tied to [[computer software]] alone, since the problem existed before [[electronic computer]]s did and has also cropped up in manual systems.\n\nThe most common issue raised by the year 1900 problem regards people's ages.
