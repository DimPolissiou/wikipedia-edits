The resultant visible hue depends on various factors, but always has some [[yellow]]ish color. The color can be from the very pale blond (caused by a patchy, scarce distribution of pigment) to reddish \"strawberry\" blond or golden-brownish (\"sandy\") blond colors (the latter with more eumelanin). \n\nBecause hair color tends to darken with age, natural blond hair is significantly less common in adulthood. Naturally-occurring blond hair is primarily found in populations of [[northern Europe]]an descent and may have evolved to enable more efficient synthesis of [[vitamin D]], due to northern Europe's lower levels of sunlight. Blond hair has also developed in other populations, although it is usually not as common, and can be found among natives of the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Vanuatu]], and [[Fiji]], among the [[Berbers]] of North Africa, and among some Asians.\n\nIn [[Western culture]], blond hair has long been associated with female beauty. [[Aphrodite]], the Greek goddess of love and beauty, was described as having blond hair. In [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]], blond hair was frequently associated with prostitutes, who dyed their hair using [[saffron]] dyes in order to attract customers. The Greeks stereotyped [[Thracians]] and [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slaves]] as blond and the Romans associated blondness with the [[Celts]] and the [[Germanic peoples|Germans]] to the north. In western Europe during the [[Middle Ages]], long, blond hair was idealized as the paragon of female beauty. The [[Norse mythology|Norse goddess]] [[Sif]] and the medieval heroine [[Iseult]] were both significantly portrayed as blond and, in [[medieval art]]work, [[Eve]], [[Mary Magdalene]], and the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] are often shown with blond hair. In contemporary western culture, blond women [[Blonde stereotype|are often negatively stereotyped]] as sexually attractive, but unintelligent. \n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, [[Scientific racism|scientific racists]] categorized blond hair and blue eyes as characteristics of the supreme [[Nordic race]].\n==Etymology, spelling, and grammar==\n[[File:Anonymous Ferdinand of Austria in Hungarian costume (detail).jpg|upright|thumb|Detail of a portrait of Crown Prince of Poland [[Sigismund Casimir|Sigismund Casimir Vasa]] ({{circa}} 1644), with characteristic blond hair which darkened with time as confirmed by his later effigies.]]\n\n===Origins and meanings===\nThe word \"blond\" is first documented in English in 1481<ref>\"blonde|blond, adj. and n.\". ''OED Online.'' March 2012. ''Oxford University Press.''

This earlier use of \"fair\" survives in the proper name [[wikt:Special:Search/fairfax|Fairfax]], from Old English ''f\u00e6\u0121er-feahs'' meaning \"blond hair\".\n\nThe word \"blond\" has two possible origins. Some linguists{{who|date=August 2018}} say it comes from [[Medieval Latin]] ''blundus'', meaning \"yellow\", from [[Old Frankish]] ''blund'' which would relate it to Old English ''blonden-feax'' meaning \"grey-haired\", from ''blondan/blandan'' meaning \"to mix\" (Cf. ''blend'').{{citation needed |date=December 2011}} Also, Old English ''beblonden'' meant \"dyed\", as ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] warriors were noted for dyeing their hair. However, linguists who favor a Latin origin for the word say that Medieval Latin ''blundus'' was a vulgar pronunciation of Latin ''[[wikt:flavus|flavus]]'', also meaning \"yellow\". Most authorities, especially French, attest to the Frankish origin. The word was reintroduced into English in the 17th century from French, and was for some time considered French; in French, \"blonde\" is a feminine ''adjective''; it describes a woman with blond hair.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=blonde&searchmode=none Origin of \"blonde\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009133722/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=blonde&searchmode=none |date=2008-10-09 }}, from [[Online Etymology Dictionary]].</ref>\n.\n===Usage===\n[[File:Pedro II of Brazil 1846 by Rugendas.png|thumb|upright|Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]] ([[House of Braganza]]) with blond hair, c. 1846]]\n\n\"Blond\", with its continued gender-varied usage, is one of few adjectives in written English to retain separate lexical genders.

[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage]]'s ''Book of English Usage'' propounds that, insofar as \"a blonde\" can be used to describe a woman but not a man who is merely said to possess blond(e) hair, the term is an example of a \"[[sexism|sexist]] stereotype [whereby] women are primarily defined by their physical characteristics.\"<ref name=\"AHBEU\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/64/C005/002.html |title=5.

''Biological Perspectives on Human Pigmentation.'' Cambridge University Press, 1991, pp. 195\u2013208.</ref> Lighter skin is due to a low concentration in pigmentation, thus allowing more sunlight to trigger the production of vitamin D. In this way, high frequencies of light hair in northern latitudes are a result of the light skin adaptation to lower levels of solar radiation, which reduces the prevalence of [[rickets]] caused by vitamin D deficiency. The darker pigmentation at higher latitudes in certain ethnic groups such as the [[Inuit]] is explained by a greater proportion of seafood in their diet and by the climate which they live in, because in the polar climate there results in more ice or snow on the ground and reflects the solar radiation onto the skin, making this environment lack the conditions for the person to have blond, [[Brown hair|brown]] or red hair, light skin and blue, grey or green eyes.\n\nAn alternative hypothesis was presented by Canadian anthropologist Peter Frost, who claims blond hair evolved very quickly in a specific area at the end of the last ice age by means of [[sexual selection]].<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.ehbonline.org/article/PIIS1090513805000590/abstract Abstract: \"European hair and eye colour: A case of frequency-dependent sexual selection?\"] from ''Evolution and Human Behavior'', Volume 27, Issue 2, pp. 85\u2013103 (March 2006)</ref> According to Frost, the appearance of blond hair and blue eyes in some northern European women made them stand out from their rivals, and more sexually appealing to men, at a time of fierce competition for scarce males.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/Frost_06.html |title=Frost: Why Do Europeans Have So Many Hair and Eye Colors? |website=cogweb.ucla.edu |access-date=2016-08-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825190147/http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/Frost_06.html |archivedate=2016-08-25 }}</ref>\n\nThe derived allele of [[KITLG]] associated with  blond hair in modern Europeans is present in several individuals of the [[Ancient North Eurasian]] (ANE) lineage, and is recorded in Mesolithic Eastern Europe as associated with the Eastern European Hunter-Gatherer (EHG) lineage derived from ANE.

The resultant visible hue depends on various factors, but always has some [[yellow]]ish color. The color can be from the very pale blond (caused by a patchy, scarce distribution of pigment) to reddish \"strawberry\" blond or golden-brownish (\"sandy\") blond colors (the latter with more eumelanin). \n\nBecause hair color tends to darken with age, natural blond hair is significantly less common in adulthood. Naturally-occurring blond hair is primarily found in populations of [[northern Europe]]an descent and may have evolved to enable more efficient synthesis of [[vitamin D]], due to northern Europe's lower levels of sunlight. Blond hair has also developed in other populations, although it is usually not as common, and can be found among natives of the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Vanuatu]], and [[Fiji]], among the [[Berbers]] of North Africa, and among some Asians.\n\nIn [[Western culture]], blond hair has long been associated with female beauty. [[Aphrodite]], the Greek goddess of love and beauty, was described as having blond hair. In [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]], blond hair was frequently associated with prostitutes, who dyed their hair using [[saffron]] dyes in order to attract customers. The Greeks stereotyped [[Thracians]] and [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slaves]] as blond and the Romans associated blondness with the [[Celts]] and the [[Germanic peoples|Germans]] to the north. In western Europe during the [[Middle Ages]], long, blond hair was idealized as the paragon of female beauty. The [[Norse mythology|Norse goddess]] [[Sif]] and the medieval heroine [[Iseult]] were both significantly portrayed as blond and, in [[medieval art]]work, [[Eve]], [[Mary Magdalene]], and the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] are often shown with blond hair. In contemporary western culture, blond women [[Blonde stereotype|are often negatively stereotyped]] as sexually attractive, but unintelligent. \n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, [[Scientific racism|scientific racists]] categorized blond hair and blue eyes as characteristics of the supreme [[Nordic race]].\n==Etymology, spelling, and grammar==\n[[File:Anonymous Ferdinand of Austria in Hungarian costume (detail).jpg|upright|thumb|Detail of a portrait of Crown Prince of Poland [[Sigismund Casimir|Sigismund Casimir Vasa]] ({{circa}} 1644), with characteristic blond hair which darkened with time as confirmed by his later effigies.]]\n\n===Origins and meanings===\nThe word \"blond\" is first documented in English in 1481<ref>\"blonde|blond, adj. and n.\".

This earlier use of \"fair\" survives in the proper name [[wikt:Special:Search/fairfax|Fairfax]], from Old English ''f\u00e6\u0121er-feahs'' meaning \"blond hair\".\n\nThe word \"blond\" has two possible origins. Some linguists{{who|date=August 2018}} say it comes from [[Medieval Latin]] ''blundus'', meaning \"yellow\", from [[Old Frankish]] ''blund'' which would relate it to Old English ''blonden-feax'' meaning \"grey-haired\", from ''blondan/blandan'' meaning \"to mix\" (Cf. ''blend'').{{citation needed |date=December 2011}} Also, Old English ''beblonden'' meant \"dyed\", as ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] warriors were noted for dyeing their hair. However, linguists who favor a Latin origin for the word say that Medieval Latin ''blundus'' was a vulgar pronunciation of Latin ''[[wikt:flavus|flavus]]'', also meaning \"yellow\". Most authorities, especially French, attest to the Frankish origin. The word was reintroduced into English in the 17th century from French, and was for some time considered French; in French, \"blonde\" is a feminine ''adjective''; it describes a woman with blond hair.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=blonde&searchmode=none Origin of \"blonde\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009133722/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=blonde&searchmode=none |date=2008-10-09 }}, from [[Online Etymology Dictionary]].</ref>\n.\n===Usage===\n[[File:Pedro II of Brazil 1846 by Rugendas.png|thumb|upright|Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]] ([[House of Braganza]]) with blond hair, c. 1846]]\n\n\"Blond\", with its continued gender-varied usage, is one of few adjectives in written English to retain separate lexical genders.

''Biological Perspectives on Human Pigmentation.'' Cambridge University Press, 1991, pp. 195\u2013208.</ref> Lighter skin is due to a low concentration in pigmentation, thus allowing more sunlight to trigger the production of vitamin D. In this way, high frequencies of light hair in northern latitudes are a result of the light skin adaptation to lower levels of solar radiation, which reduces the prevalence of [[rickets]] caused by vitamin D deficiency. The darker pigmentation at higher latitudes in certain ethnic groups such as the [[Inuit]] is explained by a greater proportion of seafood in their diet and by the climate which they live in, because in the polar climate there results in more ice or snow on the ground and reflects the solar radiation onto the skin, making this environment lack the conditions for the person to have blond, [[Brown hair|brown]] or red hair, light skin and blue, grey or green eyes.\n\nAn alternative hypothesis was presented by Canadian anthropologist Peter Frost, who claims blond hair evolved very quickly in a specific area at the end of the last ice age by means of [[sexual selection]].<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.ehbonline.org/article/PIIS1090513805000590/abstract Abstract: \"European hair and eye colour: A case of frequency-dependent sexual selection?\"] from ''Evolution and Human Behavior'', Volume 27, Issue 2, pp. 85\u2013103 (March 2006)</ref> According to Frost, the appearance of blond hair and blue eyes in some northern European women made them stand out from their rivals, and more sexually appealing to men, at a time of fierce competition for scarce males.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/Frost_06.html |title=Frost: Why Do Europeans Have So Many Hair and Eye Colors? |website=cogweb.ucla.edu |access-date=2016-08-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825190147/http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/Frost_06.html |archivedate=2016-08-25 }}</ref>\n\nThe derived allele of [[KITLG]] associated with  blond hair in modern Europeans is present in several individuals of the [[Ancient North Eurasian]] (ANE) lineage, and is recorded in Mesolithic Eastern Europe as associated with the Eastern European Hunter-Gatherer (EHG) lineage derived from ANE.

Class C motorhomes are typically powered by [[gasoline]] (petrol) engines, although some have been converted to run on [[Propane#Motor fuel|propane]] (autogas) while others use [[diesel fuel|diesels]]. Transmissions are almost always [[automatic transmission|automatic]]. The original chassis is equipped from the truck factory to the coach builder with an attached forward cab section that is van or conventional truck based (known as a ''cutaway'' chassis). In North America, the [[Ford Motor Company#Trucks|Ford]] E350 or E450 chassis are the most typical in the 21st century, while in prior times the [[Dodge]]/[[Ram Trucks|Ram]] and [[Chevrolet]]/[[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] chassis were also used. Some smaller [[micro motorhomes]] were produced on Nissan and Toyota platforms from 1972\u20131994, [[Toyota Motorhomes]] continue to have a strong following. Some very large Class C motorhomes are based on even larger truck platforms, such as the Ford F650 and [[Freightliner Trucks|Freightliner]] XC chassis. In Europe, Ford and Fiat manufacture the majority of Class C motorhome chassis.\n\nThe rigid outer weatherproof superstructure of a Class C motorhome (attached onto the original cab and chassis) was typically constructed of a wooden frame covered by sheet metal, but in recent decades such materials as [[fibreglass]], plastics, composites, and lightweight metals have become the norm. With the introduction of ''slideout''s, the earlier design notion of increasing interior space by lengthening the entire motorhome (thus escalating the purchase price) gave way to new designs that offer increased width (albeit only possible in a completely stationary vehicle) while no longer requiring additional length.\n\nClass C motorhomes are characterized by a distinctive ''cab-over'' profile, containing either an upper sleeping area, a storage space, or a TV/entertainment section. In the [[UK]], the cab-over is known as a ''Luton peak'' or [[Luton body]]. A Class C motorhome is equipped with a kitchen/dining area featuring a refrigerator/freezer, a propane range (sometimes with an oven), a microwave oven, and a table with seating. It also has a lavatory with bath/shower, and has one or more sleeping areas as well as additional seating towards the front. An air conditioner, a water heater, a furnace, and an outside canopy are usually included. Optional equipment available at additional expense typically includes a generator set and roof-mounted solar power panels.\n\nA sub-category of Class C motorhomes is the ''toy hauler'', which combines a typical configuration with additional enclosed space aft dedicated to hauling dirt bikes, bicycles, [[All-terrain vehicle|ATVs]] or the like. Class C motorhomes often feature a towing hitch enabling the pulling of a light weight trailer such as for boats, or of a small car or truck.

Great care must be taken in matching the weight and center balance point of the truck camper with the capabilities of the pickup truck itself in order to maintain safe handling of the vehicle while driving. Truck campers are much favored by those who do not wish to own a motorhome or trailer for only part-time use when the need for a truck is otherwise present.\n\nCommon uses are for backwoods travel, hunting, fishing, and particularly in North America on four wheel drive vehicles for off-roading or via rough roads to campsites. The smallest of truck campers provide a sleeping area with perhaps an ice box and storage cabinetry, while top-of-the-line campers feature a refrigerator/freezer, propane range/oven, microwave oven, air conditioner, furnace, water heater, and lavatory with shower. With the introduction of slideouts, the earlier design notion of increasing interior space by lengthening the entire camper (thus escalating the purchase price) gave way to new designs that offer increased width (albeit only possible in a completely stationary vehicle) while no longer requiring additional length.\n\nTypical North American consumer grade pickup trucks used for hauling full size slideout-equipped campers are of the Chevrolet/GMC 2500 through 3500 range, the Ram 2500 through 3500 range, and the Ford F-250 through 350 range, usually with long box bed lengths and sometimes with dual-mounted rear tires for the heaviest camper models.\n\n== Popup camper ==\n{{Main|Popup camper}}\n\n[[File:JaycoPopupCamper-2009-11-17.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A popup camper (a.k.a.

Some larger fifth-wheel trailers, usually over 40 feet (12.2 m) in length and 18,000 pounds (8,200&nbsp;kg) in weight, are  pulled by semi-trucks. Fifth-wheel trailers have become increasingly popular since they first became commercially available in the late 1960s. For some pickup truck owners the downside of a fifth-wheel trailer versus a conventional frame-hitch-mount travel trailer is that the former takes up space inside the truck cargo bed.\n\n== Park model (vacation/resort cottage) ==\nThis is a larger travel trailer \u2013 35 to 45 feet long \u2013 that is not self-contained. It is designed for park camping only; and while it is easily moved from site to site as a normal trailer is, it is not capable of \"dry camping\" as it does not have any water storage tanks and must be used with hookups.\n\n== Skoolie ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Skoolie.jpg|thumb|A former school bus that has been converted into a RV.]] -->\nA former [[school bus]] or shuttle bus that has been converted into a RV.

(A cutaway is where a vehicle frame is fitted with only a cab, motor, transmission, and tires.  A secondary manufacturer is responsible to fit additional body components.)    These are usually highly customized and done by their owners.  These can be done simply and inexpensively, or elaborately and expensive.

Some states, such as California and Illinois, require that the bus's signaling equipment (stop sign, flashing lights, etc.) be removed and the [[school bus yellow]] paint scheme be changed. Other states simply require that the \"School Bus\" signage at the top front and rear be removed.  Also, what needs to be installed prior to it being retitled from a bus to a RV varies from state to state.  Generally a bed, stove or oven, water tanks, toilet facilities, sinks, etc must be mounted to the vehicle.

Due to the anatomy of the human [[pharynx]], [[larynx]], and [[esophagus]] and the circumstances for which ventilation is needed, additional measures are often required to secure the [[Artificial airway|airway]] during positive-pressure ventilation in order to allow unimpeded passage of air into the trachea and avoid air passing into the esophagus and stomach. The common method is by [[Artificial airway|insertion of a tube into the trachea]]: intubation, which provides a clear route for the air. This can be either an [[tracheal tube|endotracheal tube]], inserted through the natural openings of mouth or nose, or a [[tracheostomy]] inserted through an artificial opening in the neck. In other circumstances simple [[Airway management#Airway maneuvers|airway maneuvres]], an [[oropharyngeal airway]] or [[laryngeal mask airway]] may be employed.

This style of ventilator often provides greater control of a wide variety of ventilation parameters (such as inspiratory rise time).  Many ICU ventilators also incorporate graphics to provide visual feedback of each breath.\n#Neonatal ventilators ([[Bubble CPAP]]{{what|date=April 2020}})\u2014Designed with the preterm neonate in mind, these are a specialized subset of ICU ventilators that are designed to deliver the smaller, more precise volumes and pressures required to ventilate these patients.\n#[[Positive airway pressure]] ventilators (PAP) \u2014 These ventilators are specifically designed for [[non-invasive ventilation]].

Such ventilators replaced the iron lungs as safe endotracheal tubes with high-volume/low-pressure cuffs were developed. The popularity of positive-pressure ventilators rose during the polio epidemic in the 1950s in Scandinavia and the United States and was the beginning of [[modern ventilation therapy]]. Positive pressure through manual supply of 50% oxygen through a [[tracheostomy]] tube led to a reduced mortality rate among patients with polio and respiratory paralysis. However, because of the sheer amount of man-power required for such manual intervention, mechanical positive-pressure ventilators became increasingly popular.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nPositive-pressure ventilators work by increasing the patient's airway pressure through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube. The positive pressure allows air to flow into the airway until the ventilator breath is terminated. Then, the airway pressure drops to zero, and the elastic recoil of the chest wall and lungs push the [[tidal volume]] \u2014 the breath-out through passive exhalation.\n\n====Negative pressure machines====\n[[Image:Poumon artificiel.jpg|thumb|An iron lung]]\n{{main|Negative pressure ventilator}}\nNegative pressure mechanical ventilators are produced in small, field-type and larger formats.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The prominent design of the smaller devices is known as the [[cuirass]], a shell-like unit used to create negative pressure only to the chest using a combination of a fitting shell and a soft bladder.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}{{efn|1=The early types of these were prone to falling off and caused severe chafing, and so were not used as a long-term devices.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}}} In recent years this device has been manufactured using various-sized [[polycarbonate]] shells with multiple seals, and a high-pressure [[oscillation pump]] in order to carry out [[biphasic cuirass ventilation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Its main use has been in patients with neuromuscular disorders that have some residual muscular function.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The latter, larger formats are in use, notably with the polio wing hospitals in [[England]] such as [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London and the [[John Radcliffe Hospital|John Radcliffe]] in [[Oxford]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} \n\nThe larger units have their origin in the [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]], also known as the Drinker and Shaw tank, which was developed in 1929 and was one of the first negative-pressure machines used for long-term ventilation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} It was refined and used in the 20th century largely as a result of the [[polio]] [[epidemic]] that struck the world in the 1940s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The machine is, in effect, a large elongated [[tank]], which encases the patient up to the neck.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The neck is sealed with a rubber [[gasket]] so that the patient's face (and airway) are exposed to the room air.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} While the exchange of [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]] between the bloodstream and the pulmonary airspace works by [[diffusion]] and requires no external work, air must be moved into and out of the [[human lung|lungs]] to make it available to the [[gas exchange]] process.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In spontaneous breathing, a negative pressure is created in the [[pleural cavity]] by the muscles of respiration, and the resulting gradient between the [[atmospheric pressure]] and the pressure inside the [[human thorax|thorax]] generates a flow of air.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In the iron lung by means of a pump, the air is withdrawn mechanically to produce a vacuum inside the tank, thus creating negative pressure.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} This negative pressure leads to expansion of the chest, which causes a decrease in intrapulmonary pressure, and increases flow of ambient air into the lungs.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} As the vacuum is released, the pressure inside the tank equalizes to that of the ambient pressure, and the elastic coil of the chest and lungs leads to passive exhalation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} However, when the vacuum is created, the abdomen also expands along with the lung, cutting off venous flow back to the heart, leading to pooling of venous blood in the lower extremities. There are large portholes for nurse or home assistant access.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The patients can talk and eat normally, and can see the world through a well-placed series of mirrors. Some could remain in these iron lungs for years at a time quite successfully.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==== Intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator ====\nAnother type is the ''intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator'' that applies pressure externally via an inflated bladder, forcing exhalation, sometimes termed [[exsufflation]].

Breaths may be triggered by a patient taking their own breath, a ventilator operator pressing a manual breath button, or by the ventilator based on the set breath rate and mode of ventilation.\n\n==== Cycle ====\nThe cycle is what causes the breath to transition from the inspiratory phase to the exhalation phase.  Breaths may be cycled by a mechanical ventilator when a set time has been reached, or when a preset flow or percentage of the maximum flow delivered during a breath is reached depending on the breath type and the settings. Breaths can also be cycled when an alarm condition such as a high pressure limit has been reached, which is a primary strategy in [[pressure regulated volume control]].\n\n==== Limit ====\nLimit is how the breath is controlled. Breaths may be limited to a set maximum circuit\npressure or a set maximum flow.\n\n=== Breath exhalation ===\nExhalation in mechanical ventilation is almost always completely passive. The ventilator's expiratory valve is opened, and expiratory flow is allowed until the baseline pressure ([[PEEP]]) is reached. Expiratory flow is determined by patient factors such as compliance and resistance.\n\n== Weaning from mechanical ventilation ==\nTiming of withdrawal from mechanical ventilation\u2014also known as weaning\u2014should be carefully considered. Patients should have their ventilation considered for withdrawal if they are able to support their own ventilation and oxygenation, and this should be assessed continuously. There are several objective parameters to look for when considering withdrawal, but there are no specific criteria that generalizes to all patients.\n\nThe [[Rapid Shallow Breathing Index]] (RSBI, the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume (f/VT), previously referred to as the \"Tobin Index\" after Dr. Martin Tobin of [[Loyola University Medical Center]]) is one of the best studied and most commonly used weaning predictors, with no other predictor having been shown to be superior. It was described in a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated patients which found that a RSBI > 105 breaths/min/L was associated with weaning failure, while a RSBI < 105 breaths/min/L predicted weaning success with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 97%, 64%, 78%, 95% respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang KL, Tobin MJ |title=A prospective study of indexes predicting the outcome of trials of weaning from mechanical ventilation |journal=N.

There are also monitors that work independently of the ventilator which allow for measuring patients after the ventilator has been removed, such as a [[tracheal tube |T tube test]].\n\n==Artificial airways as a connection to the ventilator==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\n{{Main|Artificial airway}}\nThere are various procedures and mechanical devices that provide protection against airway collapse, air leakage, and [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]]:\n* [[Respirator|Face mask]] \u2014 In resuscitation and for minor procedures under anaesthesia, a face mask is often sufficient to achieve a seal against air leakage. Airway patency of the unconscious patient is maintained either by manipulation of the jaw or by the use of ''nasopharyngeal'' or ''[[oropharyngeal airway]]''. These are designed to provide a passage of air to the [[pharynx]] through the nose or mouth, respectively. Poorly fitted masks often cause nasal bridge ulcers, a problem for some patients. Face masks are also used for [[non-invasive ventilation]] in conscious patients. A full-face mask does not, however, provide protection against aspiration. [[Non-invasive ventilation]] can be considered for epidemics of [[COVID-19]] where sufficient invasive ventilation capacity is not available (or in some milder cases) but pressurized protection suits for caregivers are recommended due to the risks of poorly fitting masks emitting contaminating aerosols.<ref> {{cite journal |vauthors=Murthy S, Gomersall CD, Fowler RA |title=Care for Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 |journal=JAMA |volume= |issue= |pages= |date=2020-03-11 |doi=10.1001/jama.2020.3633 |pmid=32159735 |url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2020.3633}}</ref>\n* ''[[Tracheal intubation]]'' is often performed for mechanical ventilation of hours to weeks duration. A tube is inserted through the nose (nasotracheal intubation) or mouth (orotracheal intubation) and advanced into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. In most cases, tubes with inflatable cuffs are used for protection against leakage and aspiration. Intubation with a cuffed tube is thought to provide the best protection against aspiration. Tracheal tubes inevitably cause pain and coughing. Therefore, unless a patient is unconscious or anaesthetized for other reasons, sedative drugs are usually given to provide tolerance of the tube. Other disadvantages of tracheal intubation include damage to the mucosal lining of the [[nasopharynx]] or [[oropharynx]] and [[subglottic stenosis]].\n* ''[[Supraglottic airway]]'' \u2014 a supraglottic airway (SGA) is any airway device that is seated above and outside the trachea, as an alternative to endotracheal intubation. Most devices work via masks or cuffs that inflate to isolate the trachea for oxygen delivery. Newer devices feature esophageal ports for suctioning or ports for tube exchange to allow intubation. Supraglottic airways differ primarily from tracheal intubation in that they do not prevent aspiration. After the introduction of the [[laryngeal mask airway]] (LMA) in 1998, supraglottic airway devices have become mainstream in both elective and emergency anesthesia.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cook T, Howes B |title=Supraglottic airway devices: recent advances |journal=Contin Educ Anaesth Crit Care |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=56\u201361 |date=December 2011 |doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mkq058 |url=http://ceaccp.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/2/56.full}}</ref> There are many types of SGAs available including the [[Combitube|Esophageal-tracheal Combitube]] (ETC), [[Laryngeal tube]] (LT), and the obsolete [[Esophageal obturator airway]] (EOA).\n*''[[Cricothyrotomy]]'' \u2014 Patients requiring emergency airway management, in whom tracheal intubation has been unsuccessful, may require an airway inserted through a surgical opening in the [[cricothyroid membrane]].

A tracheostomy is a surgically created passage into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. Tracheostomy tubes are well tolerated and often do not necessitate any use of sedative drugs.

Such ventilators replaced the iron lungs as safe endotracheal tubes with high-volume/low-pressure cuffs were developed. The popularity of positive-pressure ventilators rose during the polio epidemic in the 1950s in Scandinavia and the United States and was the beginning of [[modern ventilation therapy]]. Positive pressure through manual supply of 50% oxygen through a [[tracheostomy]] tube led to a reduced mortality rate among patients with polio and respiratory paralysis. However, because of the sheer amount of man-power required for such manual intervention, mechanical positive-pressure ventilators became increasingly popular.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nPositive-pressure ventilators work by increasing the patient's airway pressure through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube. The positive pressure allows air to flow into the airway until the ventilator breath is terminated. Then, the airway pressure drops to zero, and the elastic recoil of the chest wall and lungs push the [[tidal volume]] \u2014 the breath-out through passive exhalation.\n\n====Negative pressure machines====\n[[Image:Poumon artificiel.jpg|thumb|An iron lung]]\n{{main|Negative pressure ventilator}}\nNegative pressure mechanical ventilators are produced in small, field-type and larger formats.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The prominent design of the smaller devices is known as the [[cuirass]], a shell-like unit used to create negative pressure only to the chest using a combination of a fitting shell and a soft bladder.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}{{efn|1=The early types of these were prone to falling off and caused severe chafing, and so were not used as a long-term devices.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}}} In recent years this device has been manufactured using various-sized [[polycarbonate]] shells with multiple seals, and a high-pressure [[oscillation pump]] in order to carry out [[biphasic cuirass ventilation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Its main use has been in patients with neuromuscular disorders that have some residual muscular function.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The latter, larger formats are in use, notably with the polio wing hospitals in [[England]] such as [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London and the [[John Radcliffe Hospital|John Radcliffe]] in [[Oxford]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} \n\nThe larger units have their origin in the [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]], also known as the Drinker and Shaw tank, which was developed in 1929 and was one of the first negative-pressure machines used for long-term ventilation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} It was refined and used in the 20th century largely as a result of the [[polio]] [[epidemic]] that struck the world in the 1940s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The machine is, in effect, a large elongated [[tank]], which encases the patient up to the neck.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The neck is sealed with a rubber [[gasket]] so that the patient's face (and airway) are exposed to the room air.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} While the exchange of [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]] between the bloodstream and the pulmonary airspace works by [[diffusion]] and requires no external work, air must be moved into and out of the [[human lung|lungs]] to make it available to the [[gas exchange]] process.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In spontaneous breathing, a negative pressure is created in the [[pleural cavity]] by the muscles of respiration, and the resulting gradient between the [[atmospheric pressure]] and the pressure inside the [[human thorax|thorax]] generates a flow of air.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In the iron lung by means of a pump, the air is withdrawn mechanically to produce a vacuum inside the tank, thus creating negative pressure.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} This negative pressure leads to expansion of the chest, which causes a decrease in intrapulmonary pressure, and increases flow of ambient air into the lungs.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} As the vacuum is released, the pressure inside the tank equalizes to that of the ambient pressure, and the elastic coil of the chest and lungs leads to passive exhalation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} However, when the vacuum is created, the abdomen also expands along with the lung, cutting off venous flow back to the heart, leading to pooling of venous blood in the lower extremities.

Breaths may be triggered by a patient taking their own breath, a ventilator operator pressing a manual breath button, or by the ventilator based on the set breath rate and mode of ventilation.\n\n==== Cycle ====\nThe cycle is what causes the breath to transition from the inspiratory phase to the exhalation phase.  Breaths may be cycled by a mechanical ventilator when a set time has been reached, or when a preset flow or percentage of the maximum flow delivered during a breath is reached depending on the breath type and the settings. Breaths can also be cycled when an alarm condition such as a high pressure limit has been reached, which is a primary strategy in [[pressure regulated volume control]].\n\n==== Limit ====\nLimit is how the breath is controlled. Breaths may be limited to a set maximum circuit\npressure or a set maximum flow.\n\n=== Breath exhalation ===\nExhalation in mechanical ventilation is almost always completely passive. The ventilator's expiratory valve is opened, and expiratory flow is allowed until the baseline pressure ([[PEEP]]) is reached. Expiratory flow is determined by patient factors such as compliance and resistance.\n\n== Weaning from mechanical ventilation ==\nTiming of withdrawal from mechanical ventilation\u2014also known as weaning\u2014should be carefully considered. Patients should have their ventilation considered for withdrawal if they are able to support their own ventilation and oxygenation, and this should be assessed continuously. There are several objective parameters to look for when considering withdrawal, but there are no specific criteria that generalizes to all patients.\n\nThe [[Rapid Shallow Breathing Index]] (RSBI, the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume (f/VT), previously referred to as the \"Tobin Index\" after Dr. Martin Tobin of [[Loyola University Medical Center]]) is one of the best studied and most commonly used weaning predictors, with no other predictor having been shown to be superior. It was described in a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated patients which found that a RSBI > 105 breaths/min/L was associated with weaning failure, while a RSBI < 105 breaths/min/L predicted weaning success with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 97%, 64%, 78%, 95% respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang KL, Tobin MJ |title=A prospective study of indexes predicting the outcome of trials of weaning from mechanical ventilation |journal=N.

There are also monitors that work independently of the ventilator which allow for measuring patients after the ventilator has been removed, such as a [[tracheal tube |T tube test]].\n\n==Artificial airways as a connection to the ventilator==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\n{{Main|Artificial airway}}\nThere are various procedures and mechanical devices that provide protection against airway collapse, air leakage, and [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]]:\n* [[Respirator|Face mask]] \u2014 In resuscitation and for minor procedures under anaesthesia, a face mask is often sufficient to achieve a seal against air leakage. Airway patency of the unconscious patient is maintained either by manipulation of the jaw or by the use of ''nasopharyngeal'' or ''[[oropharyngeal airway]]''. These are designed to provide a passage of air to the [[pharynx]] through the nose or mouth, respectively. Poorly fitted masks often cause nasal bridge ulcers, a problem for some patients. Face masks are also used for [[non-invasive ventilation]] in conscious patients. A full-face mask does not, however, provide protection against aspiration. [[Non-invasive ventilation]] can be considered for epidemics of [[COVID-19]] where sufficient invasive ventilation capacity is not available (or in some milder cases) but pressurized protection suits for caregivers are recommended due to the risks of poorly fitting masks emitting contaminating aerosols.<ref> {{cite journal |vauthors=Murthy S, Gomersall CD, Fowler RA |title=Care for Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 |journal=JAMA |volume= |issue= |pages= |date=2020-03-11 |doi=10.1001/jama.2020.3633 |pmid=32159735 |url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2020.3633}}</ref>\n* ''[[Tracheal intubation]]'' is often performed for mechanical ventilation of hours to weeks duration. A tube is inserted through the nose (nasotracheal intubation) or mouth (orotracheal intubation) and advanced into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. In most cases, tubes with inflatable cuffs are used for protection against leakage and aspiration. Intubation with a cuffed tube is thought to provide the best protection against aspiration. Tracheal tubes inevitably cause pain and coughing. Therefore, unless a patient is unconscious or anaesthetized for other reasons, sedative drugs are usually given to provide tolerance of the tube. Other disadvantages of tracheal intubation include damage to the mucosal lining of the [[nasopharynx]] or [[oropharynx]] and [[subglottic stenosis]].\n* ''[[Supraglottic airway]]'' \u2014 a supraglottic airway (SGA) is any airway device that is seated above and outside the trachea, as an alternative to endotracheal intubation. Most devices work via masks or cuffs that inflate to isolate the trachea for oxygen delivery. Newer devices feature esophageal ports for suctioning or ports for tube exchange to allow intubation. Supraglottic airways differ primarily from tracheal intubation in that they do not prevent aspiration. After the introduction of the [[laryngeal mask airway]] (LMA) in 1998, supraglottic airway devices have become mainstream in both elective and emergency anesthesia.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cook T, Howes B |title=Supraglottic airway devices: recent advances |journal=Contin Educ Anaesth Crit Care |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=56\u201361 |date=December 2011 |doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mkq058 |url=http://ceaccp.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/2/56.full}}</ref> There are many types of SGAs available including the [[Combitube|Esophageal-tracheal Combitube]] (ETC), [[Laryngeal tube]] (LT), and the obsolete [[Esophageal obturator airway]] (EOA).\n*''[[Cricothyrotomy]]'' \u2014 Patients requiring emergency airway management, in whom tracheal intubation has been unsuccessful, may require an airway inserted through a surgical opening in the [[cricothyroid membrane]]. This is similar to a [[tracheostomy]] but a [[cricothyrotomy]] is reserved for emergency access.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Carley SD, Gwinnutt C, Butler J, Sammy I, Driscoll P |title=Rapid sequence induction in the emergency department: a strategy for failure |journal=Emerg Med J |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=109\u201313 |date=March 2002 |pmid=11904254 |pmc=1725832 |doi=10.1136/emj.19.2.109 |url=http://emj.bmj.com/content/19/2/109.full}}</ref>\n* ''[[Tracheostomy]]'' \u2014 When patients require mechanical ventilation for several weeks, a tracheostomy may provide the most suitable access to the trachea. A tracheostomy is a surgically created passage into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. Tracheostomy tubes are well tolerated and often do not necessitate any use of sedative drugs. Tracheostomy tubes may be inserted early during treatment in patients with pre-existing severe respiratory disease, or in any patient expected to be difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation, i.e., patients with little muscular reserve.\n* ''Mouthpiece'' \u2014 Less common interface, does not provide protection against aspiration.

concluding: \"The most likely explanation for the conduct of Bishop Mulkearns and other senior clergy in the Diocese was that they were trying to minimise the risk of scandal and protect the

The Melbourne report found that former Ballarat Diocese [[Peter Connors|Bishop Peter Connors]] was part of a culture that practiced 'using oblique or euphemistic language in correspondence and records concerning complaints of child sexual abuse'\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecourier.com.au/story/5102536/royal-commission-slams-former-ballarat-bishop-in-melbourne-report/?cs=62|title=Royal Commission slams former Ballarat Bishop in Melbourne report|last=Wrigley|first=Brendan|date=2017-12-05|work=The Courier|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe following are extracts from the conclusion of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse's report into Case Study 28 \u2013 Catholic Church authorities in Ballarat:<ref name=\"Gemma.Choy\"/><blockquote>This case study exposed a catastrophic failure in the leadership of the Diocese and ultimately in the structure and culture of the Church over decades to effectively respond to the sexual abuse of children by its priests. That failure led to the suffering and often irreparable harm to children, their families and the wider community. That harm could have been avoided if the Church had acted in the interests of children rather than in its own interests. </blockquote><blockquote>Euphemistic and elliptical language was often used in correspondence and minutes to mask the true nature of the conduct discussed. There was repeated reference to \u2018pressures\u2019, \u2018strains\u2019 and unspecified \u2018problems\u2019. On occasions, records were deliberately not made or kept or were destroyed.  </blockquote><blockquote>The result of these inexcusable failures was that more children were sexually abused by Catholic clergy in the Diocese. There was a catastrophic institutional failure which resulted in many children being sexually abused. We heard about the devastating, often lifelong, consequences in the lives of those children. The welfare of children was not the primary concern of Bishop Mulkearns and other senior members of the Diocese when responding to complaints and allegation of child sexual abuse against their priests. There is no doubt it should have been. </blockquote>The report on Ballarat also described the impact it had on victims. One section outlines suicide and premature death caused from the abuse. One victim said: <blockquote>Newspapers don\u2019t report suicides, so the public doesn\u2019t hear about the broken families and their shattered lives, about the unseen impact of institutional child sexual abuse. Children are left behind and they don\u2019t understand why. It doesn\u2019t end when the abuse ends.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/sites/default/files/case_study_28_-_findings_report_-_catholic_church_authorities_in_ballarat_catholic_church_authorities_in_ballarat2.pdf|title=Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse: Catholic Church authorities in Ballarat - Report of Case Study No. 28|website=Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse|pages=433\u2013436}}</ref></blockquote>Other harms are outlined.

That failure led to the suffering and often irreparable harm to children, their families and the wider community. That harm could have been avoided if the Church had acted in the interests of children rather than in its own interests. </blockquote><blockquote>Euphemistic and elliptical language was often used in correspondence and minutes to mask the true nature of the conduct discussed. There was repeated reference to \u2018pressures\u2019, \u2018strains\u2019 and unspecified \u2018problems\u2019. On occasions, records were deliberately not made or kept or were destroyed.  </blockquote><blockquote>The result of these inexcusable failures was that more children were sexually abused by Catholic clergy in the Diocese. There was a catastrophic institutional failure which resulted in many children being sexually abused. We heard about the devastating, often lifelong, consequences in the lives of those children. The welfare of children was not the primary concern of Bishop Mulkearns and other senior members of the Diocese when responding to complaints and allegation of child sexual abuse against their priests. There is no doubt it should have been. </blockquote>The report on Ballarat also described the impact it had on victims. One section outlines suicide and premature death caused from the abuse. One victim said: <blockquote>Newspapers don\u2019t report suicides, so the public doesn\u2019t hear about the broken families and their shattered lives, about the unseen impact of institutional child sexual abuse. Children are left behind and they don\u2019t understand why. It doesn\u2019t end when the abuse ends.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/sites/default/files/case_study_28_-_findings_report_-_catholic_church_authorities_in_ballarat_catholic_church_authorities_in_ballarat2.pdf|title=Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse: Catholic Church authorities in Ballarat - Report of Case Study No. 28|website=Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse|pages=433\u2013436}}</ref></blockquote>Other harms are outlined.

During the plague outbreak of 1448, Johannis Assonensis, a German confessor attached to St. Peter's and later [[Bishop of Wurzburg]], assembled his countrymen there  and founded among them a brotherhood, the object of which was to provide suitable burial for all poor Germans dying in Rome.

Second, and perhaps most prominently, they contend that there were no homicidal gas chambers, particularly at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where mainstream historians believe over 1 million Jews were murdered, primarily in gas chambers.

This is often cited as evidence that gas was not used in the chambers, as no trace amounts remain. Despite the difficulty of finding traces of this material 50 years later, in February, 1990, Professor [[Jan Markiewicz]], Director of the [[Institute of Forensic Research]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]], redid the analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/polish/institute-for-forensic-research/ |title=A Study of the Cyanide Compounds Content in the Walls of the Gas Chambers in the Former Auschwitz & Birkenau Concentration Camps |publisher=Nizkor.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref> Markiewicz and his team used [[microdiffusion]] techniques to test for cyanide in samples from the suspected gas chambers, from delousing chambers, and from control areas elsewhere within Auschwitz.

(In some of the gas chambers the Zyklon B was poured in through the roof, while in others it was thrown in through the windows.) The roof was dynamited at war's end, and today lies broken in pieces, but three of the four original holes were positively identified in a recent paper. Their location in the concrete matches with eyewitness testimony, aerial photos from 1944, and a ground photo from 1943. The physical evidence shows unmistakably that the Zyklon holes were cast into the concrete when the building was constructed.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/genocide/deniers_06.shtml Denying the Holocaust] by [[Deborah Lipstadt]] BBC History. p.6</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Ruin of the gas chamber of Crematorium II.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of the Crematorium II gas chamber at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]].]]\n\nLeuchter's comment that the camp was \"untouched\" has been dismissed as nonsense by the Holocaust scholar [[Robert Jan van Pelt]], who explains that the absence of most of the would-be rubble from the crematoria is because the local Polish population returning to the area after the war rebuilt farmhouses to the west with bricks salvaged from rubble in the camp area including from the [[Auschwitz II|Birkenau]] crematoria.<ref name=\"transcript\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.errolmorris.com/film/mrd_transcript.html|title=Mr. Death: Transcript|publisher=|year=2006|first=Errol|last=Morris|accessdate=2008-08-07}}</ref>\n\nAnother piece of evidence Holocaust deniers frequently question is what happened to the ash after the bodies were cremated. The amount of ash produced in the [[cremation]] of a person is about a shoebox full, if done in a proper crematorium. However, eyewitness testimonies documented by Hilberg's ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'' describe the burning process used in [[Treblinka]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]], and [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]] to have carried out in multiple open-air grills where stacks of bodies were burned on top of metal bars. These grills were operated by burning piles of wood underneath.\n\nCremation in the open at the [[Operation Reinhard|Reinhard]] death camps (Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec) was discussed at [[Nuremberg]] on the 7th April 1946 by [[Georg Konrad Morgen]], [[Hauptamt SS-Gericht|SS judge]] and lawyer who investigated crimes committed in Nazi concentration camps. He stated: \"The whole thing was like an assembly line. At the last stop they reached a big room, and were told that this was the bath. When the last one was in, the doors were shut and the gas was let into the room. As soon as death taken place in (''sic''), the ventilators were started. When the air was breathable, the doors were opened, and the Jewish workers removed the bodies. By means of a special process which [[Christian Wirth|Wirth]] had invented, they were burned in the open air without the use of fuel.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/imt/tgmwc/tgmwc-20/tgmwc-20-197-10.shtml |title=Trials of German Major War Criminals: Volume 20 |publisher=Nizkor.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref>\n\nThere is well-documented evidence that other ash was used as fertilizer in nearby fields.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shofar FTP Archive File: camps/maidanek//maidanek.04|url=http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/camps/maidanek/ftp.cgi?camps/maidanek//maidanek.04|website=nizkor.org|publisher=[[Nizkor Project]]|accessdate=24 May 2015|date=31 December 1994}}</ref><ref>[[Nuremberg trials|International Military Tribunal]], vol. 1, p. 252</ref> Photographs of Treblinka taken by the camp commandant show what looks to be ash piles being distributed by steam shovels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/Treblinka/appendixd/ |title=Appendix D - Ash Disposal and Mass Graves at Treblinka |publisher=The Holocaust History Project |accessdate=2015-04-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903011056/http://www.holocaust-history.org/Treblinka/appendixd/ |archivedate=2015-09-03 }}</ref>\n\nAnother argument used by Holocaust deniers is that testimony on the gas chambers is unreliable. The [[Institute for Historical Review]] is one of the organizations which make this assertion. In the words of the IHR:\n<blockquote>[[Rudolf Hoess|H\u00f6ss]] said in his confession that his men would smoke cigarettes as they pulled the dead Jews out of the gas chambers ten minutes after gassing. Isn't Zyklon-B explosive? Highly so.

Complicating the matter is that various instances have been reported where the death tolls of particular death camps were claimed to be overstated. These claims vary in verifiability and objectivity. A much-quoted instance of disputing the toll is the \"Breitbard Document\" (actually a paper by Aaron Breitbart),<ref>{{cite web|author1=[[Aaron Breitbart]]|title=Responses to Revisionist Arguments|url=http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=gvKVLcMVIuG&b=394667|website=motlc.wiesenthal.com|publisher=[[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]|accessdate=10 January 2017|location=[[Los Angeles]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403232419/http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=gvKVLcMVIuG&b=394667|archive-date=3 April 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>  which describes a commemorative plaque at Auschwitz to the victims that died there, which reads: \"Four million people suffered and died here at the hands of the Nazi murderers between the years 1940 and 1945.\" In 1990, a new plaque replaced the old one. It now says, \"May this place where the Nazis assassinated 1,500,000 men, women and children, a majority of them Jews from diverse European countries, be forever for mankind a cry of despair and of warning.\" The lower numbers are due to the fact that the Soviets \"purposely overstated the number of non-Jewish casualties at Auschwitz-Birkenau,\" according to the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]. Holocaust deniers insist that the number of Jews killed therefore be lowered by at least 2.5 million. However, the plaque had never been used as an accurate historical source by mainstream historians.<ref>Hilberg, R. Op. Cit.</ref><ref>Dawidowicz, L., The War Against the Jews.

Glynn#\"The Crucifixion of Jews Must Stop!\"|The Crucifixion of Jews Must Stop!]]\", suggests the reported death toll is inaccurate and was invented to fit propaganda.<ref>[[Robert N.

Proctor]] has criticized such claims stating \"[this] oddity has been exploited by Holocaust deniers but is simply a remarkable coincidence and nothing more\".\n\n===International Committee of the Red Cross===\nHolocaust deniers misrepresent and omit information contained in [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] reports that contradict their claims.<ref name=Lipstadt114>Lipstadt, p. 114.</ref> Critics argue that [[Richard Verrall]] in his \"[[Did Six Million Really Die?]]\" pamphlet (published under the pseudonym Richard E. Harwood) could only claim that the ICRC had found no evidence of a policy to exterminate Jews by ignoring key sections of the 1948 report, where the ICRC explicitly states that the systematic extermination of Jews was Nazi policy.<ref name=\"Lipstadt114-5\">Lipstadt, p. 114/115.</ref>\n\nHarwood disputed the notion that homicidal gas chambers were disguised as shower facilities by citing references in the report where ICRC officials inspected bathing facilities. He used their responses to argue that showers functioned as showers and were not part of a killing installation. However this is considered misrepresentation by critics, as the passage Harwood cited is in reference to Allied camps for civilians in Egypt and thus had nothing to do with Nazi concentration camps.<ref name=Lipstadt115>Lipstadt, p. 115.</ref>\n[[Image:ICRC letter - traceable deaths only.jpg|thumb|left|A letter from the Sonderstandesamt (special registry office)\n at [[Bad Arolsen]] regarding only deaths at Nazi concentration camps that were registered by this institution (not to be confused with the numbers of deaths officially registered in the camps themselves). This and similar correspondence is frequently misrepresented as the absolute death toll of the Holocaust by deniers. Note that the English translations are not a part of the original document and are incorrect: the document does not come from the Red Cross. \"Anzahl\" means \"count\", \"number\" and not \"Total Deaths\".]]\n\nHarwood also claimed that ''[[:de:Die Tat (Schweizer Zeitung)|Die Tat]]'', a Swiss tabloid newspaper, published statistics that concluded the number of people who died in Nazi prisons and camps from 1939 to 1945 based on ICRC statistics was \"300,000, not all of whom were Jews\".<ref name=Lipstadt116>Lipstadt, p. 116.</ref> The January 19, 1955 edition of Die Tat did indeed give a 300,000 figure, but this was only in reference to \"Germans and German Jews\" and not nationals of other countries.<ref name=Lipstadt117>Lipstadt, p. 117.</ref> In the 1978 official bulletin, entitled \"False Propaganda\", the ICRC denounced Holocaust denial and confirmed that the agency \"Never published\u2014or even compiled\u2014statistics of this kind which are being falsely attributed to it\" and stated that its mission was \"to help war victims, not to count them\",<ref name=Bulletin25>ICRC ''Bulletin No. 25, Feb. 1, 1978'', cited in Lipstadt, p. 117.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Kahn|first1=Robert|title=Holocaust Denial and the Law: A Comparative Study|date=2004|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|location=[[London]]|isbn=9781403980502|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=svfFAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA49|accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Patterns of Prejudice\">{{cite journal|title=Red cross exposure of \"false propaganda\"|journal=Patterns of Prejudice|date=January 1978|volume=12|issue=2|page=11|doi=10.1080/0031322X.1978.9969431|issn=0031-322X}}</ref> and questioned how they would have even been able to obtain such statistics had they wanted to, given that they were \"only able to enter only a few concentration camps...in the final days of the war\".<ref name=Bulletin25/><ref name=\"Patterns of Prejudice\"/> The agency states that the figures used are \"the number of deaths recorded by the [[International Tracing Service]] on the basis of documents found when the camps were closed\",<ref name=Bulletin25/><ref name=\"Patterns of Prejudice\"/> and accordingly bear no relation to the total death tolls, since the Nazis destroyed much documentation, and that many deaths occurred in camps where prisoners were generally not registered.<ref name=Bulletin25/><ref name=\"Patterns of Prejudice\"/> The ICRC considers this misrepresentation as \"propaganda\",<ref name=Bulletin25/><ref name=\"Patterns of Prejudice\"/> and because these claims regarding the ICRC were used for the defense of [[Ernst Z\u00fcndel]] at his trial in 1985, critics state that despite the agency's attempts to demonstrate the truth, Holocaust deniers have continued to rely on ICRC based disinformation.<ref name=Lipstadt117/> Archives of the International Tracing Service (located in [[Bad Arolsen]]) responding to such misrepresentation can be found here.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.its-arolsen.org/en/archives/index.html |title=Archives |publisher=Its-Arolsen.Org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref>\nIn 1979, the ICRC stated a second time that they have \"never tried to compile statistics on the victims of the war\",<ref name=icrc300000>{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/orgs/international/red-cross/ftp.py?orgs/international/red-cross//300000-victims.response |title=Comite International De La Croix-Rouge |publisher=Nizkor.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref> nor \"certified the accuracy of the statistics produced by a third party\",<ref name=icrc300000/> and state that the authors of such material have \"falsified\" both claims that the document originates from the ICRC and refers exclusively to Jews.<ref name=icrc300000/>\n\nAs well as in personal correspondence, the ICRC has also addressed this misrepresentation by several other means. In 1975, the ICRC wrote to the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] in [[London]] regarding Harwood's citations, stating:\n{{quote|The figures cited by the author of the booklet are based upon statistics falsely attributed to us, evidently for the purpose of giving them credibility, despite the fact that we never publish information of this kind.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Suzman|first1=Arthur|last2=Diamond|first2=Denis|title=Six million did die: the truth shall prevail Arthur Suzman and Denis Diamond|date=1978|publisher=South African Jewish Board of Deputies|isbn=978-0620031288|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0GEJAQAAIAAJ&q=The+figures+cited+by+the+author+of+the+booklet+are+based+upon+statistics+falsely+attributed+to+us,+evidently+for+the+purpose+of+giving+them+credibility,+despite+the+fact+that+we+never+publish+information+of+this+kind}}</ref>|Fran\u00e7oise Perret|''Comit\u00e9 International de la Croix-Rouge, to Jacob Gewirtz, August 22, 1975.''}}\n\n====Baseler Nachrichten====\nSimilarly, Harwood wrote that the June 4, 1946 edition of ''Baseler Nachrichten'', another Swiss newspaper, reported that \"a maximum of only one and a half million Jews could be numbered as casualties.\"<ref>Harwood, p. 14., cited in Lipstadt, p. 112.</ref> Harwood fails to mention that a later article in a later edition of the newspaper acknowledges that the previous article was incorrect, and 5,800,000 was an accurate number of victims.<ref>''Baseler Nachrichten'', October 7, 1952; Aronsfeld, ''The Text of the Holocaust'', p. 14., cited in Lipstadt, ''Denying the Holocaust''.</ref> Critics cite this as an example of deniers using partial information to distort legitimate sources.<ref>Lipstadt, p. 112.</ref>\n\n===Jewish population===\nOne Holocaust denial argument is the comparison of the population of Jews before and after the Holocaust. They state that the 1940 [[World Almanac]] gives the world Jewish population as 15,319,359, while the 1948 ''World Almanac'' gives the world Jewish population as 15,713,638. They therefore claim that either the figures are wrong, or the Holocaust, meaning the deaths of millions of Jews, cannot have happened to any extent similar to the claimed 6 million. [[Ken McVay]] writes:\n<blockquote>Only in 1949 are postwar estimates employed, the figures given are for estimates made in 1948. A year or two lag seems to be common for various other population estimates given by the World Almanac. The difference between the 1938 and 1948 figures is thus 4,481,491.\n\nIn 1949, however, the World Almanac gives '''a revised 1939 population of 16,643,120 giving a difference of between 1938 and 1947 of 5,376,520'''. Where the extra population between 1938 and 1939 came from is not cited, though one might speculate that it was based upon the Nazi estimates made in 1942 for the Wannsee Conference. Despite the apparent exactness of the numbers listed, the World Almanac warns that all numbers listed are estimates.<ref>[http://www.nizkor.org/features/techniques-of-denial/worldalmanac.html \"The World Almanac Gambit\"], Deceit & Misrepresentation: The Techniques of Holocaust Denial, [[Nizkor Project]] website. Retrieved December 6, 2009.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOther sources confirm similar numbers\u2014and earlier than the 1949 ''World Almanac''\u2014for the Jewish population before and after the war. The 1932 ''American Jewish Yearbook'' estimates the total number of Jews in the world at 15,192,218, of whom 9,418,248 resided in Europe. However, the 1947 yearbook states: \"Estimates of the world Jewish population have been assembled by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (except for the United States and Canada) and are probably the most authentic available at the present time. The figures reveal that the total Jewish population of the world has decreased by one-third from about 16,600,000 in 1939 to about 11,000,000 in 1946 as the result of the annihilation by the Nazis of more than five and a half million European Jews. In Europe only an estimated 3,642,000 remain of the total Jewish pre-war population of approximately 9,740,000.\" These numbers are also consistent with the findings of the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070104080919/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/anglo/angap03.htm Appendix III], in 1946.\n\n===Nazi documentation===\n[[Image:Hoefletelegram.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The H\u00f6fle Telegram.]]\nThe Nazis used figures of between 9 and 11 million for the Jewish population of Europe, as evidenced in the notes of the [[Wannsee Conference]]. In fact, the Nazis methodically recorded the ongoing reduction of the Jewish population, as in the [[Korherr Report]], which gave the status of the [[Final Solution]] through December 1942. The [[H\u00f6fle Telegram]] was sent by SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer Hermann H\u00f6fle on January 11, 1943 to SS-Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer [[Adolf Eichmann]] in Berlin and detailed the number of deaths of Jews in the concentration camps.<ref name=\"roberthanyok\">{{cite web| last = Hanyok |first = Robert |title = Eavesdropping on Hell: Historical Guide to Western Communications Intelligence and the Holocaust, 1939-1945 |year=2004 |accessdate = 2007-09-09 |url = https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/historical-figures-publications/publications/wwii/assets/files/eavesdropping.pdf|page = 80}}</ref> In the year 1942 alone, the telegram lists 1,274,166 Jews were exterminated<ref name=\"roberthanyok\"/> in the four camps of [[Aktion Reinhard]].\nThe [[Korherr Report]] compiled by an SS statistician, gave a conservative total of 2,454,000 Jews deported to extermination camps or killed by the Einsatzgruppen. The complete status reports of the Einsatzgruppen death squads were found in the archives of the Gestapo when it was searched by the U.S. Army, and the accuracy attested to by the former Einsatzgruppen members who testified during war crime trials and at other times. These reports alone list an additional 1,500,000 or so murders during mass shootings, the vast majority of these victims were Jews. Further, surviving Nazi documentation spells out their plans to murder the Jews of Europe (see the [[Wannsee Conference]]), recorded the trains arriving at various death camps, and included photographs and films of many atrocities.\n\n===Testimonies===\nThere are voluminous amounts of testimony from thousands of survivors of the Holocaust,<ref>See for example here: [http://sfi.usc.edu/vha/indexing Cataloguing and Indexing]; [[##USC Shoah Foundation Institute]]</ref> as well as the testimony of captured Nazi officers at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] and other times.<ref>Other [http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/trials/ Trials] by the Holocaust Education & Archive Research Team</ref> Holocaust deniers discount the testimony of officers claiming that these witnesses were tortured<ref name=Assertions/> or that [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss]] allegedly signed a confession written in a language he did not understand ([[English language|English]]) or that the Nuremberg Trial did not follow proper judicial procedures.

There were Jewish prisoners who helped march Jews to the gas chambers, and later dragged the bodies to the crematoria.  Since they witnessed the entire process, their testimony is vital in confirming that the gas chambers were used for murderous purposes and the scale to which they were used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/faqs/auschwitz/auschwitz-faq-10.html |title=The Nizkor Project - Command staff |publisher=Nizkor.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref>\n\nOther key testimony comes from non-Jewish survivors of the camps such as Catholic [[French Resistance]] member [[Andr\u00e9 Rogerie]] who was held in seven different camps, and who as a member of the Resistance was not targeted for extermination but for hard labor and survived.

First, they contend that, while mass murders of Jews did occur (although they dispute both the intentionality of such murders as well as the supposed deservedness of these killings), there was no official Nazi policy to murder Jews. Second, and perhaps most prominently, they contend that there were no homicidal gas chambers, particularly at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where mainstream historians believe over 1 million Jews were murdered, primarily in gas chambers.

This is often cited as evidence that gas was not used in the chambers, as no trace amounts remain. Despite the difficulty of finding traces of this material 50 years later, in February, 1990, Professor [[Jan Markiewicz]], Director of the [[Institute of Forensic Research]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]], redid the analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/polish/institute-for-forensic-research/ |title=A Study of the Cyanide Compounds Content in the Walls of the Gas Chambers in the Former Auschwitz & Birkenau Concentration Camps |publisher=Nizkor.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref> Markiewicz and his team used [[microdiffusion]] techniques to test for cyanide in samples from the suspected gas chambers, from delousing chambers, and from control areas elsewhere within Auschwitz.

(In some of the gas chambers the Zyklon B was poured in through the roof, while in others it was thrown in through the windows.) The roof was dynamited at war's end, and today lies broken in pieces, but three of the four original holes were positively identified in a recent paper. Their location in the concrete matches with eyewitness testimony, aerial photos from 1944, and a ground photo from 1943. The physical evidence shows unmistakably that the Zyklon holes were cast into the concrete when the building was constructed.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/genocide/deniers_06.shtml Denying the Holocaust] by [[Deborah Lipstadt]] BBC History. p.6</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Ruin of the gas chamber of Crematorium II.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of the Crematorium II gas chamber at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]].]]\n\nLeuchter's comment that the camp was \"untouched\" has been dismissed as nonsense by the Holocaust scholar [[Robert Jan van Pelt]], who explains that the absence of most of the would-be rubble from the crematoria is because the local Polish population returning to the area after the war rebuilt farmhouses to the west with bricks salvaged from rubble in the camp area including from the [[Auschwitz II|Birkenau]] crematoria.<ref name=\"transcript\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.errolmorris.com/film/mrd_transcript.html|title=Mr. Death: Transcript|publisher=|year=2006|first=Errol|last=Morris|accessdate=2008-08-07}}</ref>\n\nAnother piece of evidence Holocaust deniers frequently question is what happened to the ash after the bodies were cremated. The amount of ash produced in the [[cremation]] of a person is about a shoebox full, if done in a proper crematorium. However, eyewitness testimonies documented by Hilberg's ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'' describe the burning process used in [[Treblinka]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]], and [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]] to have carried out in multiple open-air grills where stacks of bodies were burned on top of metal bars. These grills were operated by burning piles of wood underneath.\n\nCremation in the open at the [[Operation Reinhard|Reinhard]] death camps (Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec) was discussed at [[Nuremberg]] on the 7th April 1946 by [[Georg Konrad Morgen]], [[Hauptamt SS-Gericht|SS judge]] and lawyer who investigated crimes committed in Nazi concentration camps. He stated: \"The whole thing was like an assembly line. At the last stop they reached a big room, and were told that this was the bath. When the last one was in, the doors were shut and the gas was let into the room. As soon as death taken place in (''sic''), the ventilators were started. When the air was breathable, the doors were opened, and the Jewish workers removed the bodies. By means of a special process which [[Christian Wirth|Wirth]] had invented, they were burned in the open air without the use of fuel.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/imt/tgmwc/tgmwc-20/tgmwc-20-197-10.shtml |title=Trials of German Major War Criminals: Volume 20 |publisher=Nizkor.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref>\n\nThere is well-documented evidence that other ash was used as fertilizer in nearby fields.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shofar FTP Archive File: camps/maidanek//maidanek.04|url=http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/camps/maidanek/ftp.cgi?camps/maidanek//maidanek.04|website=nizkor.org|publisher=[[Nizkor Project]]|accessdate=24 May 2015|date=31 December 1994}}</ref><ref>[[Nuremberg trials|International Military Tribunal]], vol. 1, p. 252</ref> Photographs of Treblinka taken by the camp commandant show what looks to be ash piles being distributed by steam shovels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/Treblinka/appendixd/ |title=Appendix D - Ash Disposal and Mass Graves at Treblinka |publisher=The Holocaust History Project |accessdate=2015-04-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903011056/http://www.holocaust-history.org/Treblinka/appendixd/ |archivedate=2015-09-03 }}</ref>\n\nAnother argument used by Holocaust deniers is that testimony on the gas chambers is unreliable. The [[Institute for Historical Review]] is one of the organizations which make this assertion. In the words of the IHR:\n<blockquote>[[Rudolf Hoess|H\u00f6ss]] said in his confession that his men would smoke cigarettes as they pulled the dead Jews out of the gas chambers ten minutes after gassing. Isn't Zyklon-B explosive? Highly so.

A much-quoted instance of disputing the toll is the \"Breitbard Document\" (actually a paper by Aaron Breitbart),<ref>{{cite web|author1=[[Aaron Breitbart]]|title=Responses to Revisionist Arguments|url=http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=gvKVLcMVIuG&b=394667|website=motlc.wiesenthal.com|publisher=[[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]|accessdate=10 January 2017|location=[[Los Angeles]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403232419/http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=gvKVLcMVIuG&b=394667|archive-date=3 April 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>  which describes a commemorative plaque at Auschwitz to the victims that died there, which reads: \"Four million people suffered and died here at the hands of the Nazi murderers between the years 1940 and 1945.\" In 1990, a new plaque replaced the old one. It now says, \"May this place where the Nazis assassinated 1,500,000 men, women and children, a majority of them Jews from diverse European countries, be forever for mankind a cry of despair and of warning.\" The lower numbers are due to the fact that the Soviets \"purposely overstated the number of non-Jewish casualties at Auschwitz-Birkenau,\" according to the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]. Holocaust deniers insist that the number of Jews killed therefore be lowered by at least 2.5 million. However, the plaque had never been used as an accurate historical source by mainstream historians.<ref>Hilberg, R. Op. Cit.</ref><ref>Dawidowicz, L., The War Against the Jews.

Harwood) could only claim that the ICRC had found no evidence of a policy to exterminate Jews by ignoring key sections of the 1948 report, where the ICRC explicitly states that the systematic extermination of Jews was Nazi policy.<ref name=\"Lipstadt114-5\">Lipstadt, p. 114/115.</ref>\n\nHarwood disputed the notion that homicidal gas chambers were disguised as shower facilities by citing references in the report where ICRC officials inspected bathing facilities. He used their responses to argue that showers functioned as showers and were not part of a killing installation. However this is considered misrepresentation by critics, as the passage Harwood cited is in reference to Allied camps for civilians in Egypt and thus had nothing to do with Nazi concentration camps.<ref name=Lipstadt115>Lipstadt, p. 115.</ref>\n[[Image:ICRC letter - traceable deaths only.jpg|thumb|left|A letter from the Sonderstandesamt (special registry office)\n at [[Bad Arolsen]] regarding only deaths at Nazi concentration camps that were registered by this institution (not to be confused with the numbers of deaths officially registered in the camps themselves).

Note that the English translations are not a part of the original document and are incorrect: the document does not come from the Red Cross. \"Anzahl\" means \"count\", \"number\" and not \"Total Deaths\".]]\n\nHarwood also claimed that ''[[:de:Die Tat (Schweizer Zeitung)|Die Tat]]'', a Swiss tabloid newspaper, published statistics that concluded the number of people who died in Nazi prisons and camps from 1939 to 1945 based on ICRC statistics was \"300,000, not all of whom were Jews\".<ref name=Lipstadt116>Lipstadt, p. 116.</ref> The January 19, 1955 edition of Die Tat did indeed give a 300,000 figure, but this was only in reference to \"Germans and German Jews\" and not nationals of other countries.<ref name=Lipstadt117>Lipstadt, p. 117.</ref> In the 1978 official bulletin, entitled \"False Propaganda\", the ICRC denounced Holocaust denial and confirmed that the agency \"Never published\u2014or even compiled\u2014statistics of this kind which are being falsely attributed to it\" and stated that its mission was \"to help war victims, not to count them\",<ref name=Bulletin25>ICRC ''Bulletin No. 25, Feb. 1, 1978'', cited in Lipstadt, p. 117.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Kahn|first1=Robert|title=Holocaust Denial and the Law: A Comparative Study|date=2004|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|location=[[London]]|isbn=9781403980502|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=svfFAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA49|accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Patterns of Prejudice\">{{cite journal|title=Red cross exposure of \"false propaganda\"|journal=Patterns of Prejudice|date=January 1978|volume=12|issue=2|page=11|doi=10.1080/0031322X.1978.9969431|issn=0031-322X}}</ref> and questioned how they would have even been able to obtain such statistics had they wanted to, given that they were \"only able to enter only a few concentration camps...in the final days of the war\".<ref name=Bulletin25/><ref name=\"Patterns of Prejudice\"/> The agency states that the figures used are \"the number of deaths recorded by the [[International Tracing Service]] on the basis of documents found when the camps were closed\",<ref name=Bulletin25/><ref name=\"Patterns of Prejudice\"/> and accordingly bear no relation to the total death tolls, since the Nazis destroyed much documentation, and that many deaths occurred in camps where prisoners were generally not registered.<ref name=Bulletin25/><ref name=\"Patterns of Prejudice\"/> The ICRC considers this misrepresentation as \"propaganda\",<ref name=Bulletin25/><ref name=\"Patterns of Prejudice\"/> and because these claims regarding the ICRC were used for the defense of [[Ernst Z\u00fcndel]] at his trial in 1985, critics state that despite the agency's attempts to demonstrate the truth, Holocaust deniers have continued to rely on ICRC based disinformation.<ref name=Lipstadt117/> Archives of the International Tracing Service (located in [[Bad Arolsen]]) responding to such misrepresentation can be found here.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.its-arolsen.org/en/archives/index.html |title=Archives |publisher=Its-Arolsen.Org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref>\nIn 1979, the ICRC stated a second time that they have \"never tried to compile statistics on the victims of the war\",<ref name=icrc300000>{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/orgs/international/red-cross/ftp.py?orgs/international/red-cross//300000-victims.response |title=Comite International De La Croix-Rouge |publisher=Nizkor.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref> nor \"certified the accuracy of the statistics produced by a third party\",<ref name=icrc300000/> and state that the authors of such material have \"falsified\" both claims that the document originates from the ICRC and refers exclusively to Jews.<ref name=icrc300000/>\n\nAs well as in personal correspondence, the ICRC has also addressed this misrepresentation by several other means. In 1975, the ICRC wrote to the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] in [[London]] regarding Harwood's citations, stating:\n{{quote|The figures cited by the author of the booklet are based upon statistics falsely attributed to us, evidently for the purpose of giving them credibility, despite the fact that we never publish information of this kind.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Suzman|first1=Arthur|last2=Diamond|first2=Denis|title=Six million did die: the truth shall prevail Arthur Suzman and Denis Diamond|date=1978|publisher=South African Jewish Board of Deputies|isbn=978-0620031288|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0GEJAQAAIAAJ&q=The+figures+cited+by+the+author+of+the+booklet+are+based+upon+statistics+falsely+attributed+to+us,+evidently+for+the+purpose+of+giving+them+credibility,+despite+the+fact+that+we+never+publish+information+of+this+kind}}</ref>|Fran\u00e7oise Perret|''Comit\u00e9 International de la Croix-Rouge, to Jacob Gewirtz, August 22, 1975.''}}\n\n====Baseler Nachrichten====\nSimilarly, Harwood wrote that the June 4, 1946 edition of ''Baseler Nachrichten'', another Swiss newspaper, reported that \"a maximum of only one and a half million Jews could be numbered as casualties.\"<ref>Harwood, p. 14., cited in Lipstadt, p. 112.</ref> Harwood fails to mention that a later article in a later edition of the newspaper acknowledges that the previous article was incorrect, and 5,800,000 was an accurate number of victims.<ref>''Baseler Nachrichten'', October 7, 1952; Aronsfeld, ''The Text of the Holocaust'', p. 14., cited in Lipstadt, ''Denying the Holocaust''.</ref> Critics cite this as an example of deniers using partial information to distort legitimate sources.<ref>Lipstadt, p. 112.</ref>\n\n===Jewish population===\nOne Holocaust denial argument is the comparison of the population of Jews before and after the Holocaust. They state that the 1940 [[World Almanac]] gives the world Jewish population as 15,319,359, while the 1948 ''World Almanac'' gives the world Jewish population as 15,713,638. They therefore claim that either the figures are wrong, or the Holocaust, meaning the deaths of millions of Jews, cannot have happened to any extent similar to the claimed 6 million. [[Ken McVay]] writes:\n<blockquote>Only in 1949 are postwar estimates employed, the figures given are for estimates made in 1948. A year or two lag seems to be common for various other population estimates given by the World Almanac. The difference between the 1938 and 1948 figures is thus 4,481,491.\n\nIn 1949, however, the World Almanac gives '''a revised 1939 population of 16,643,120 giving a difference of between 1938 and 1947 of 5,376,520'''. Where the extra population between 1938 and 1939 came from is not cited, though one might speculate that it was based upon the Nazi estimates made in 1942 for the Wannsee Conference. Despite the apparent exactness of the numbers listed, the World Almanac warns that all numbers listed are estimates.<ref>[http://www.nizkor.org/features/techniques-of-denial/worldalmanac.html \"The World Almanac Gambit\"], Deceit & Misrepresentation: The Techniques of Holocaust Denial, [[Nizkor Project]] website. Retrieved December 6, 2009.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOther sources confirm similar numbers\u2014and earlier than the 1949 ''World Almanac''\u2014for the Jewish population before and after the war. The 1932 ''American Jewish Yearbook'' estimates the total number of Jews in the world at 15,192,218, of whom 9,418,248 resided in Europe. However, the 1947 yearbook states: \"Estimates of the world Jewish population have been assembled by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (except for the United States and Canada) and are probably the most authentic available at the present time. The figures reveal that the total Jewish population of the world has decreased by one-third from about 16,600,000 in 1939 to about 11,000,000 in 1946 as the result of the annihilation by the Nazis of more than five and a half million European Jews. In Europe only an estimated 3,642,000 remain of the total Jewish pre-war population of approximately 9,740,000.\" These numbers are also consistent with the findings of the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070104080919/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/anglo/angap03.htm Appendix III], in 1946.\n\n===Nazi documentation===\n[[Image:Hoefletelegram.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The H\u00f6fle Telegram.]]\nThe Nazis used figures of between 9 and 11 million for the Jewish population of Europe, as evidenced in the notes of the [[Wannsee Conference]]. In fact, the Nazis methodically recorded the ongoing reduction of the Jewish population, as in the [[Korherr Report]], which gave the status of the [[Final Solution]] through December 1942. The [[H\u00f6fle Telegram]] was sent by SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer Hermann H\u00f6fle on January 11, 1943 to SS-Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer [[Adolf Eichmann]] in Berlin and detailed the number of deaths of Jews in the concentration camps.<ref name=\"roberthanyok\">{{cite web| last = Hanyok |first = Robert |title = Eavesdropping on Hell: Historical Guide to Western Communications Intelligence and the Holocaust, 1939-1945 |year=2004 |accessdate = 2007-09-09 |url = https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/historical-figures-publications/publications/wwii/assets/files/eavesdropping.pdf|page = 80}}</ref> In the year 1942 alone, the telegram lists 1,274,166 Jews were exterminated<ref name=\"roberthanyok\"/> in the four camps of [[Aktion Reinhard]].\nThe [[Korherr Report]] compiled by an SS statistician, gave a conservative total of 2,454,000 Jews deported to extermination camps or killed by the Einsatzgruppen. The complete status reports of the Einsatzgruppen death squads were found in the archives of the Gestapo when it was searched by the U.S. Army, and the accuracy attested to by the former Einsatzgruppen members who testified during war crime trials and at other times. These reports alone list an additional 1,500,000 or so murders during mass shootings, the vast majority of these victims were Jews. Further, surviving Nazi documentation spells out their plans to murder the Jews of Europe (see the [[Wannsee Conference]]), recorded the trains arriving at various death camps, and included photographs and films of many atrocities.\n\n===Testimonies===\nThere are voluminous amounts of testimony from thousands of survivors of the Holocaust,<ref>See for example here: [http://sfi.usc.edu/vha/indexing Cataloguing and Indexing]; [[##USC Shoah Foundation Institute]]</ref> as well as the testimony of captured Nazi officers at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] and other times.<ref>Other [http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/trials/ Trials] by the Holocaust Education & Archive Research Team</ref> Holocaust deniers discount the testimony of officers claiming that these witnesses were tortured<ref name=Assertions/> or that [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss]] allegedly signed a confession written in a language he did not understand ([[English language|English]]) or that the Nuremberg Trial did not follow proper judicial procedures.

There were Jewish prisoners who helped march Jews to the gas chambers, and later dragged the bodies to the crematoria.  Since they witnessed the entire process, their testimony is vital in confirming that the gas chambers were used for murderous purposes and the scale to which they were used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/faqs/auschwitz/auschwitz-faq-10.html |title=The Nizkor Project - Command staff |publisher=Nizkor.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref>\n\nOther key testimony comes from non-Jewish survivors of the camps such as Catholic [[French Resistance]] member [[Andr\u00e9 Rogerie]] who was held in seven different camps, and who as a member of the Resistance was not targeted for extermination but for hard labor and survived.
