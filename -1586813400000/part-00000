It was released as the second single from her fourth studio album, ''[[Amor Prohibido]]'' (1994). Originally written about a cheerful fish swimming freely in the ocean, the song's title is an [[wikt:onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic phrase]] suggesting the palpitating heartbeat of a person [[lovestruck]] by the object of their affection. \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" was written by Selena and her backup vocalist and dancer [[Pete Astudillo]].\n\n\"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" is a [[Mexican cumbia]] pop song with ''[[rock en espa\u00f1ol]]'' and [[reggae]] influences. It received widespread acclaim for its musically diverse sounds, and the effects it had on listeners. The single peaked at number one on the United States [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Hot Latin Songs]] chart and remained there for four consecutive weeks, the singer's second consecutive number one single. Selena began dominating the Latin music charts, and \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" contributed to her commercial success. It is believed by musicologist [[Ilan Stavans]] to have marked the beginning of the dominance of [[Latin pop]], and was a bridge to the Tejano market. The song is considered to be one of the best [[List of songs recorded by Selena|compositions recorded by Selena]], one of her most popular recordings, and has been cited as one of her [[signature song]]s. Her [[Astrodome]] concert performance of the song has been called one of the highlights of her musical career. \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" was ranked at number 54 on the list of the Best Texas Songs of All-time, and given honorable mention as one of the top ten best Tejano recordings of all-time.\n\nAfter the [[Murder of Selena|shooting death of Selena]] in 1995, the song's title became a popular verb to describe a fan's admiration for the singer. \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" won the [[Tejano Music Awards|Tejano Music Award]] for Song of the Year, while [[Broadcast Music Inc.]] recognized it as the most played Latin song of 1996. Since ''Billboard'' began monitoring [[music download]]s in 2010, \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" has remained on the [[Billboard charts#Latin|Regional Mexican Digital Songs]] chart for 280 non-consecutive weeks, second to the number of consecutive weeks for her 1992 single \"[[Como la Flor]]\". Many musicians have since recorded the song or performed it as a tribute to the singer including: [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Selena Gomez]], [[Alejandra Guzm\u00e1n]], [[Kat Von D]], and [[Jennifer Pe\u00f1a]].\n\n== Background and writing ==\n[[File:Crybaby.jpg|thumb|The crybaby (pictured) [[riff]] that Selena's husband [[Chris P\u00e9rez]] performed, became the musical foundation of \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\".]]\n\"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" originated at her band's rehearsals starting off as an improvised song with few if any lyrics.{{sfn|Arrar\u00e1s|1997|p=66}} According to Selena's brother, and principal music producer [[A.B.

It was released as the second single from her fourth studio album, ''[[Amor Prohibido]]'' (1994). Originally written about a cheerful fish swimming freely in the ocean, the song's title is an [[wikt:onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic phrase]] suggesting the palpitating heartbeat of a person [[lovestruck]] by the object of their affection. \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" was written by Selena and her backup vocalist and dancer [[Pete Astudillo]].\n\n\"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" is a [[Mexican cumbia]] pop song with ''[[rock en espa\u00f1ol]]'' and [[reggae]] influences. It received widespread acclaim for its musically diverse sounds, and the effects it had on listeners. The single peaked at number one on the United States [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Hot Latin Songs]] chart and remained there for four consecutive weeks, the singer's second consecutive number one single. Selena began dominating the Latin music charts, and \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" contributed to her commercial success. It is believed by musicologist [[Ilan Stavans]] to have marked the beginning of the dominance of [[Latin pop]], and was a bridge to the Tejano market. The song is considered to be one of the best [[List of songs recorded by Selena|compositions recorded by Selena]], one of her most popular recordings, and has been cited as one of her [[signature song]]s. Her [[Astrodome]] concert performance of the song has been called one of the highlights of her musical career. \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" was ranked at number 54 on the list of the Best Texas Songs of All-time, and given honorable mention as one of the top ten best Tejano recordings of all-time.\n\nAfter the [[Murder of Selena|shooting death of Selena]] in 1995, the song's title became a popular verb to describe a fan's admiration for the singer. \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" won the [[Tejano Music Awards|Tejano Music Award]] for Song of the Year, while [[Broadcast Music Inc.]] recognized it as the most played Latin song of 1996. Since ''Billboard'' began monitoring [[music download]]s in 2010, \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" has remained on the [[Billboard charts#Latin|Regional Mexican Digital Songs]] chart for 280 non-consecutive weeks, second to the number of consecutive weeks for her 1992 single \"[[Como la Flor]]\". Many musicians have since recorded the song or performed it as a tribute to the singer including: [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Selena Gomez]], [[Alejandra Guzm\u00e1n]], [[Kat Von D]], and [[Jennifer Pe\u00f1a]].\n\n== Background and writing ==\n[[File:Crybaby.jpg|thumb|The crybaby (pictured) [[riff]] that Selena's husband [[Chris P\u00e9rez]] performed, became the musical foundation of \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\".]]\n\"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" originated at her band's rehearsals starting off as an improvised song with few if any lyrics.{{sfn|Arrar\u00e1s|1997|p=66}} According to Selena's brother, and principal music producer [[A.B.

Selena notices the man looking at her, then she looks away smiling. Meanwhile, she begins to sing the song \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\".

A street-seller approaches the man to sell roses, and is successful, as he asks for one. The man then gives the roses to Selena and asks her (by gesturing with a nod of his head) to follow him.

to Tejano music were \"significant\", because she adapted a new style of Tejano cumbia (or Mexican cumbia) with \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\".{{sfn|Stavans|2014|p=725}} The song was recognized by Lori Beth

submitted to [[Cao Cao]], the ruler of the Wei Kingdom, surrendering his state in exchange for gaining state religion status for Tianshi Daoism. Zhang was given a title and land, as were several other family members and generals.  His daughter was married to Cao Cao\u2019s son, [[Cao Yu (playwright)|Cao Yu]].  His followers were forced to resettle in other parts of China, with one group being sent to the [[Chang'an]] area, and another being sent to [[Luoyang]]. Zhang relocated to the Han court until the Han Dynasty changed to the [[Cao Wei|Wei]]. He then used his own popularity as a religious leader to lend legitimacy to the Wei, proclaiming that the Wei court had inherited divine authority from the Tao church, as well as from Confucian laws.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nThe collapse of the Wei Kingdom in 260 CE, along with the fall of Northern China to the Huns in 317, further scattered adherents to the Celestial Master.<ref>Bokenkamp (1997), p. 150.</ref> The Celestial Masters later reemerged in the 4th and 5th centuries as two distinct offshoots, the Northern and Southern Celestial Masters.\n\nCelestial Masters had prophecy rituals banned since what happens in the future it was supposed to be just known already by the member without rituals.<ref name=\"LagerweyL\u00fc2009 47\">{{cite book|author1=John Lagerwey|author2=Pengzhi L\u00fc|title=Early Chinese Religion: The Period of Division (220-589 Ad)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q2nWdWbN3MQC&pg=PA370#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=30 October 2009|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-17585-7|pages=370\u2013}}</ref>\n\nFor the water, earth, and heaven officials, Celestial Masters wrote the \u4e09\u5b98\u624b\u66f8 sanguan shoushu.<ref>{{cite book|title=Modern Chinese Religion I (2 vol.set): Song-Liao-Jin-Yuan (960-1368 AD)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DiBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA986#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=8 December 2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-27164-7|pages=986\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===The Southern Celestial Masters===\nAfter the fall of [[Luoyang]] to non-Chinese invaders in 311, the remnants of the court fled to Jiankang (modern-day [[Nanjing]]) and established a new state known as the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Eastern Jin]] dynasty. Among the court members who fled were members of the Celestial Masters. There is also evidence that after Zhang Lu\u2019s submission to Cao Cao, numerous adherents fled south from Sichuan. These various followers of The Way of the Celestial Master coalesced to form a distinct form of Celestial Master Daoism known as the Southern Celestial Masters. The Southern Celestial Masters lasted as a distinct movement into the fifth century.\n\n===The Northern Celestial Masters===\n{{Main|The Northern Celestial Masters}}\n[[Kou Qianzhi]], who was raised in a Celestial Master family, received two visions of Laozi in 415 and in 423. In 424, he brought the work that resulted from these visions to the court of the [[Northern Wei]] dynasty. The rulers put his works into practice, and Kou became the Celestial Master of the Daoist theocracy of the Northern Wei. After Kou died in 448, the prime minister, [[Cui Hao]], became power hungry and began to insult the Wei rulers. Unhappy with his insubordination, the rulers had Cui executed in 450, and ended the Daoist theocracy.\n\n===The Celestial Masters today===\n{{Main|Zhengyi Dao}}\nDuring the Yuan Dynasty, the [[Zhengyi Dao]] School of Daoism claimed lineage to the Celestial Masters.  They became one of the two leading schools of Daoism in China, along with [[Quanzhen School|Quanzhen Dao]].

In 1949, after the communists gained power in the mainland, the 64th Celestial Master, [[Zhang Enpu]], fled to [[Taiwan]].<ref>\"[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/arts---leisure/2008/12/15/187654/Who%E2%80%99s-going.htm Who\u2019s going to be the 65th Taoist pope?],\" ''The China Post'', December 15, 2008.</ref> After his death, a succession dispute arose between different branches of the family in Taiwan and mainland China.\n\nIn fact, the Way of the Celestial Masters have flourished during the reign of Communism.  They regularly ordain priests at the Zhengyi Monastery at the Celestial Master\u2019s Mansion in Mainland China.\n\n==Beliefs and practices==\n[[Image:Zhang Daoling.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Zhang Daoling, the first Celestial Master]]\nEach of the three different eras of the Celestial Masters had distinct beliefs. However, because the Southern and Northern Celestial Masters both descended directly from the initial movement founded by Zhang Daoling, there are many beliefs that are shared. A number of texts exist that give insight into early Celestial Master practice, in particular the ''[[Taiping Jing]]'' and the ''[[Xiang'er]]'' commentary to the Laozi.\n\nThe foundation of Daoist belief is that there is an energy source known as [[qi]] that pervades all things. The human body also contains qi, but it only has a limited amount of qi. Qi could be lost from the body through things such as sweating and ejaculation. The Celestial Masters shared these foundational Daoist beliefs, but modified them slightly.\n\nOne such change was that illness was caused by [[sin]]. This was because sin caused qi to leave the body. In order to cure any illness, repentance was a crucial factor in ensuring that the loss of qi could be staunched. Repentance could be accomplished by spending time in a 'Chamber of Silence,' and reflecting on one's sins, or by beating one's breasts and [[kowtow]]ing to heaven. Illness could also be cured in other ways as well, among them using medicinal herbs and by listening to ritual music. Eating very little was also of extreme importance, and an ideal diet would consist of no food at all, but only noncorporeal things such as air, which the person could absorb through meditation.\n\nSexual practices (known as [[heqi]], or 'The Union of the Breaths') were not part of Celestial Master Daoism. While the School of the Naturalists (and offshoot schools) advocate not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain,' the Celestial Masters frowned upon this, and simply advocated celibacy as a way to avoid losing qi. In addition, the Celestial Masters thought that the macrobiotic method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced.<ref>Bokenkamp (1997), p. 83.</ref>\n\n==Significance==\n\nThe Celestial Masters were the first group of organized Daoists. Before their foundation, Daoism did not exist as an organized religion. Being the first organized religious Daoists, the Celestial Masters are the ancestors of subsequent Daoist movements such as the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] and [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] movements.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Xiang'er]]\n*[[Zhang Daoling]]\n*[[Zhang Lu (Three Kingdoms)|Zhang Lu]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Bokenkamp, Stephen.

submitted to [[Cao Cao]], the ruler of the Wei Kingdom, surrendering his state in exchange for gaining state religion status for Tianshi Daoism. Zhang was given a title and land, as were several other family members and generals.  His daughter was married to Cao Cao\u2019s son, [[Cao Yu (playwright)|Cao Yu]].  His followers were forced to resettle in other parts of China, with one group being sent to the [[Chang'an]] area, and another being sent to [[Luoyang]]. Zhang relocated to the Han court until the Han Dynasty changed to the [[Cao Wei|Wei]]. He then used his own popularity as a religious leader to lend legitimacy to the Wei, proclaiming that the Wei court had inherited divine authority from the Tao church, as well as from Confucian laws.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nThe collapse of the Wei Kingdom in 260 CE, along with the fall of Northern China to the Huns in 317, further scattered adherents to the Celestial Master.<ref>Bokenkamp (1997), p. 150.</ref> The Celestial Masters later reemerged in the 4th and 5th centuries as two distinct offshoots, the Northern and Southern Celestial Masters.\n\nCelestial Masters had prophecy rituals banned since what happens in the future it was supposed to be just known already by the member without rituals.<ref name=\"LagerweyL\u00fc2009 47\">{{cite book|author1=John Lagerwey|author2=Pengzhi L\u00fc|title=Early Chinese Religion: The Period of Division (220-589 Ad)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q2nWdWbN3MQC&pg=PA370#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=30 October 2009|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-17585-7|pages=370\u2013}}</ref>\n\nFor the water, earth, and heaven officials, Celestial Masters wrote the \u4e09\u5b98\u624b\u66f8 sanguan shoushu.<ref>{{cite book|title=Modern Chinese Religion I (2 vol.set): Song-Liao-Jin-Yuan (960-1368 AD)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DiBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA986#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=8 December 2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-27164-7|pages=986\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===The Southern Celestial Masters===\nAfter the fall of [[Luoyang]] to non-Chinese invaders in 311, the remnants of the court fled to Jiankang (modern-day [[Nanjing]]) and established a new state known as the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Eastern Jin]] dynasty. Among the court members who fled were members of the Celestial Masters. There is also evidence that after Zhang Lu\u2019s submission to Cao Cao, numerous adherents fled south from Sichuan. These various followers of The Way of the Celestial Master coalesced to form a distinct form of Celestial Master Daoism known as the Southern Celestial Masters. The Southern Celestial Masters lasted as a distinct movement into the fifth century.\n\n===The Northern Celestial Masters===\n{{Main|The Northern Celestial Masters}}\n[[Kou Qianzhi]], who was raised in a Celestial Master family, received two visions of Laozi in 415 and in 423. In 424, he brought the work that resulted from these visions to the court of the [[Northern Wei]] dynasty. The rulers put his works into practice, and Kou became the Celestial Master of the Daoist theocracy of the Northern Wei. After Kou died in 448, the prime minister, [[Cui Hao]], became power hungry and began to insult the Wei rulers. Unhappy with his insubordination, the rulers had Cui executed in 450, and ended the Daoist theocracy.\n\n===The Celestial Masters today===\n{{Main|Zhengyi Dao}}\nDuring the Yuan Dynasty, the [[Zhengyi Dao]] School of Daoism claimed lineage to the Celestial Masters.  They became one of the two leading schools of Daoism in China, along with [[Quanzhen School|Quanzhen Dao]].

In 1949, after the communists gained power in the mainland, the 64th Celestial Master, [[Zhang Enpu]], fled to [[Taiwan]].<ref>\"[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/arts---leisure/2008/12/15/187654/Who%E2%80%99s-going.htm Who\u2019s going to be the 65th Taoist pope?],\" ''The China Post'', December 15, 2008.</ref> After his death, a succession dispute arose between different branches of the family in Taiwan and mainland China.\n\nIn fact, the Way of the Celestial Masters have flourished during the reign of Communism.  They regularly ordain priests at the Zhengyi Monastery at the Celestial Master\u2019s Mansion in Mainland China.\n\n==Beliefs and practices==\n[[Image:Zhang Daoling.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Zhang Daoling, the first Celestial Master]]\nEach of the three different eras of the Celestial Masters had distinct beliefs. However, because the Southern and Northern Celestial Masters both descended directly from the initial movement founded by Zhang Daoling, there are many beliefs that are shared. A number of texts exist that give insight into early Celestial Master practice, in particular the ''[[Taiping Jing]]'' and the ''[[Xiang'er]]'' commentary to the Laozi.\n\nThe foundation of Daoist belief is that there is an energy source known as [[qi]] that pervades all things. The human body also contains qi, but it only has a limited amount of qi. Qi could be lost from the body through things such as sweating and ejaculation. The Celestial Masters shared these foundational Daoist beliefs, but modified them slightly.\n\nOne such change was that illness was caused by [[sin]]. This was because sin caused qi to leave the body. In order to cure any illness, repentance was a crucial factor in ensuring that the loss of qi could be staunched. Repentance could be accomplished by spending time in a 'Chamber of Silence,' and reflecting on one's sins, or by beating one's breasts and [[kowtow]]ing to heaven. Illness could also be cured in other ways as well, among them using medicinal herbs and by listening to ritual music. Eating very little was also of extreme importance, and an ideal diet would consist of no food at all, but only noncorporeal things such as air, which the person could absorb through meditation.\n\nSexual practices (known as [[heqi]], or 'The Union of the Breaths') were not part of Celestial Master Daoism. While the School of the Naturalists (and offshoot schools) advocate not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain,' the Celestial Masters frowned upon this, and simply advocated celibacy as a way to avoid losing qi. In addition, the Celestial Masters thought that the macrobiotic method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced.<ref>Bokenkamp (1997), p. 83.</ref>\n\n==Significance==\n\nThe Celestial Masters were the first group of organized Daoists. Before their foundation, Daoism did not exist as an organized religion. Being the first organized religious Daoists, the Celestial Masters are the ancestors of subsequent Daoist movements such as the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] and [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] movements.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Xiang'er]]\n*[[Zhang Daoling]]\n*[[Zhang Lu (Three Kingdoms)|Zhang Lu]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Bokenkamp, Stephen.

The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \"weak-looking character\" but decided to follow Kojima.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The codename \"Raiden\" was based on that of the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]], a historical combat aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]].

Raiden's final duel with the boss Solidus Snake was revised in the making of the game. Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709185620/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Production|archivedate=July 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Konami]] kept Raiden's starring role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials.

The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \"weak-looking character\" but decided to follow Kojima.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The codename \"Raiden\" was based on that of the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]], a historical combat aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]].

Raiden's final duel with the boss Solidus Snake was revised in the making of the game. Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709185620/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Production|archivedate=July 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Konami]] kept Raiden's starring role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials.

Set in Edwardian England, the film is based on an [[Alan Sharp]] adaptation of Irish author [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]]'s 1936 novella ''My Talks with Dean Spanley''. It stars [[Sam Neill]] as the Dean, [[Jeremy Northam]] and [[Peter O'Toole]] as Fisk Junior and Fisk Senior respectively and [[Bryan Brown]] as Wrather.\n\n==Plot==\nThe narrative is called \"a surreal period comedic tale of canine reincarnation exploring the relationships between father and son and master and dog\".<ref>[http://www.villagefilmfestival.co.uk/films/deanspanley.html Village Film Festival]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Peter O'Toole said that the film's use of comedy to explore the relationship between a father and son was part of the attraction for him: \"All of us have had these difficult familial relationships and I think it's a film for all of us who understand the relationship between a father and son.

The Fisk family has suffered first the loss of its younger son, Harrington Fisk (Xavier Horan), killed in the [[Second Anglo-Boer War]], shortly followed by the death of Horatio's wife. Fisk Senior is looked after by his housekeeper Mrs Brimley ([[Judy Parfitt]]) who has lost her husband. Fisk Junior reluctantly visits his father every Thursday.\n\nOne day, trying to entertain his father, Fisk Junior takes him to a lecture by a visiting [[swami]] ([[Art Malik]]) about the [[transmigration of the soul|transmigration]] of souls. The lecture is also attended by the new local clergyman, Dean Spanley ([[Sam Neill]]).\n\nLater the same day Fisk Junior encounters the Dean at his father's club. A chance third meeting leads to an introduction. Fisk Junior, initially intrigued by the Dean's oddly open-minded views on reincarnation, is prompted to look beyond the Dean's appearance (that of an affable, rather bland clergyman) by his weakness for certain peculiar sensations produced by Hungarian Imperial [[Tokaji|Tokay]] wine, which leads him into a dreamlike state. Working with his clever friend Wrather ([[Bryan Brown]]), an Australian \"[[conveyancer]]\", Fisk secures a batch of Tokay and the two entertain the Dean, who acts ever more strangely, starting to reveal memories of his previous life \u2014 as a [[Welsh Springer Spaniel|Welsh Spaniel]]. These memories are acute and convincing, including rich feelings around food and communication with other canines, a deep distaste for cats and pigs, and the joy of serving his master. As the story unfolds, Fisk Junior comes to understand his father's background better and the two draw closer.

As a legacy of association football's origins in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], the other organisations represented are the governing bodies of the game in the four [[countries of the United Kingdom|countries of the UK]]. Amendments to the Laws require a three-quarter [[supermajority]] vote, meaning that FIFA's support is necessary but not sufficient for a motion to pass.\n\n==Operations==\nIFAB is made up of representatives from each of the United Kingdom's pioneering football associations\u2014England's [[The Football Association|Football Association]] (The FA), the [[Scottish Football Association]] (SFA), the [[Football Association of Wales]] (FAW) and Northern Ireland's [[Irish Football Association]] (IFA)\u2014and the [[FIFA|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA), the international governing body for football. Each British association has one vote and FIFA has four. IFAB deliberations must be approved by three-quarters of the vote, or at least six of the eight votes.<ref name=\"IFAB Article 7\">{{cite web|url=http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/63/IFAB_Statutes_v2.0.pdf |title=Article 7: General Assembly |work=Statutes of the International Association Football Board (IFAB) |date=5 March 2016 |accessdate=21 July 2016}}</ref> Thus, FIFA's approval is necessary for any IFAB decision, but FIFA alone cannot change the Laws of the Game\u2014they need to be agreed by at least two of the UK members.

In [[FIFA World Cup]] years, the AGM is held at FIFA's offices; otherwise, it rotates between Northern Ireland, Wales, England and Scotland in that order.<ref name=\"IFAB Article 7\"/> Four weeks before the AGM, the member associations must send their written proposals to the secretary of the host association. FIFA then prints a list of suggestions that are distributed to all other associations for examination. The AGM is held either in February or March and the ABM is held between September and October.<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/organisation/ip-100_04e_ifab_9481.pdf Form & Function] FIFA - FIFA paper on the role of the IFAB</ref> In cases of necessity, the Board can meet in a Special Meeting in addition to the two ordinary annual meetings.

This posed a problem with international matches and when matches were played, the rules of the home team's national association were used. While this solution was workable, it was hardly ideal. To remedy this, the then football associations of [[The Football Association|England]], [[Football Association of Wales|Wales]], [[Scottish Football Association|Scotland]] and [[Irish Football Association|Ireland]] met at the [[International Football Conference]] on 6 December 1882 in [[Manchester]], in order to set forth a common set of rules that could be applied to matches between the UK football associations' national teams.  \n\nIn the summer of 1885, the English FA legalized professionalism.  The Scottish FA responded that it would refuse to allow professionals in its own national team, and would refuse to play international matches against an England team containing professionals.<ref>{{cite journal |work=Nottingham Journal |date=1886-01-27 |page=6 |title=The International Match: England v Scotland}}</ref>  The Irish FA attempted to mediate by proposing that \"an international conference should be held each year, say, in August, to be called in turn by each national association to deal with the laws of the game, and discuss other matters of interest to Association football, and at which international disputes could be adjusted\".<ref>{{cite journal |work=Cricket and Football Field |date=1886-02-13 |page=12 |title=Scottish Football Association}}</ref>\n\nThe first meeting of IFAB took place at the FA's offices at [[Holborn Viaduct]] in [[London]] on Wednesday 2 June 1886.<ref>[http://ssbra.org/html/laws/IFABarc/pdf/1886/18861ST.pdf The First Meeting of the International Football Association Board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007012127/http://ssbra.org/html/laws/IFABarc/pdf/1886/18861ST.pdf |date=2007-10-07 }} Soccer South Bay Referee Association</ref><ref>[http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/TheOrganisation/Postings/2004/03/HISTORY_OF_THE_FA.htm TheFA.com - History of The FA] Football Association</ref> The FA, SFA, FAW and IFA each had equal voting rights.\n\n[[FIFA|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)]], the international [[sport governing body|organising body]] for the sport, was formed in [[Paris]] in 1904 and declared that, regarding the Laws of the Game itself, they would enforce the rules laid down by IFAB.  In 1912, FIFA requested that its representatives be included in IFAB. At a special meeting held in January 1913 in [[Wrexham]], IFAB agreed to FIFA's request.  The first regular IFAB meeting to include FIFA occurred in June 1913.  Each association (including FIFA) was entitled to send two representatives, with a four-fifths majority required to change the laws (thus that the UK associations could still change the laws against FIFA's wishes if they all voted together).  One more meeting of IFAB was held, in [[Paris]] in 1914, before regular meetings were curtailed by the [[First World War]].\n\nFor the first four post-war IFAB meetings (1920, 1921, 1922, and 1923), FIFA was once again excluded, on account of a dispute between FIFA and the home nations.  From 1924, once the dispute had been resolved, FIFA once again attended IFAB  meetings. In 1958, the Board agreed on its current voting system.\n\nSince Irish partition in 1921, the IFA has evolved to become the organising body for football in Northern Ireland, with football in the [[Republic of Ireland]] being organised by the [[Football Association of Ireland|FAI]].  A request for the FAI to become a member of IFAB was denied at the 1923 annual general meeting.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1923min.pdf |title=Minutes of the 1923 Annual

'''International Football Association Board''' ('''IFAB''') is the body that determines the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] of [[association football]]. IFAB was founded in 1886 to agree standardised Laws for international competition, and has since acted as the \"guardian\" of the internationally used Laws. Since its establishment in 1904, [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association|FIFA]], the sport's top governing body, has recognised IFAB's jurisdiction over the Laws.<ref name=\"Dunmore2011\">{{cite book|author=Tom Dunmore|title=Historical Dictionary of Soccer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9j1wbp2t1usC&pg=PA150|date=16 September 2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7188-5|pages=150\u2013}}</ref> IFAB is known to take a highly conservative attitude regarding changes to the Laws of the Game.<ref name=tele_sinbin>{{cite news|title=Sin-bins will by considered by Fifa rulemakers Ifab after support from Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/10568924/Sin-bins-will-by-considered-by-Fifa-rulemakers-Ifab-after-support-from-Sepp-Blatter-and-Michel-Platini.html|accessdate=6 October 2014|work=The Telegraph|date=13 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIt is a separate body from FIFA, though FIFA is represented on the board and holds 50% of the voting power. As a legacy of association football's origins in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], the other organisations represented are the governing bodies of the game in the four [[countries of the United Kingdom|countries of the UK]]. Amendments to the Laws require a three-quarter [[supermajority]] vote, meaning that FIFA's support is necessary but not sufficient for a motion to pass.\n\n==Operations==\nIFAB is made up of representatives from each of the United Kingdom's pioneering football associations\u2014England's [[The Football Association|Football Association]] (The FA), the [[Scottish Football Association]] (SFA), the [[Football Association of Wales]] (FAW) and Northern Ireland's [[Irish Football Association]] (IFA)\u2014and the [[FIFA|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA), the international governing body for football. Each British association has one vote and FIFA has four. IFAB deliberations must be approved by three-quarters of the vote, or at least six of the eight votes.<ref name=\"IFAB Article 7\">{{cite web|url=http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/63/IFAB_Statutes_v2.0.pdf |title=Article 7: General Assembly |work=Statutes of the International Association Football Board (IFAB) |date=5 March 2016 |accessdate=21 July 2016}}</ref> Thus, FIFA's approval is necessary for any IFAB decision, but FIFA alone cannot change the Laws of the Game\u2014they need to be agreed by at least two of the UK members.

In [[FIFA World Cup]] years, the AGM is held at FIFA's offices; otherwise, it rotates between Northern Ireland, Wales, England and Scotland in that order.<ref name=\"IFAB Article 7\"/> Four weeks before the AGM, the member associations must send their written proposals to the secretary of the host association. FIFA then prints a list of suggestions that are distributed to all other associations for examination. The AGM is held either in February or March and the ABM is held between September and October.<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/organisation/ip-100_04e_ifab_9481.pdf Form & Function] FIFA - FIFA paper on the role of the IFAB</ref> In cases of necessity, the Board can meet in a Special Meeting in addition to the two ordinary annual meetings.

This posed a problem with international matches and when matches were played, the rules of the home team's national association were used. While this solution was workable, it was hardly ideal. To remedy this, the then football associations of [[The Football Association|England]], [[Football Association of Wales|Wales]], [[Scottish Football Association|Scotland]] and [[Irish Football Association|Ireland]] met at the [[International Football Conference]] on 6 December 1882 in [[Manchester]], in order to set forth a common set of rules that could be applied to matches between the UK football associations' national teams.  \n\nIn the summer of 1885, the English FA legalized professionalism.  The Scottish FA responded that it would refuse to allow professionals in its own national team, and would refuse to play international matches against an England team containing professionals.<ref>{{cite journal |work=Nottingham Journal |date=1886-01-27 |page=6 |title=The International Match: England v Scotland}}</ref>  The Irish FA attempted to mediate by proposing that \"an international conference should be held each year, say, in August, to be called in turn by each national association to deal with the laws of the game, and discuss other matters of interest to Association football, and at which international disputes could be adjusted\".<ref>{{cite journal |work=Cricket and Football Field |date=1886-02-13 |page=12 |title=Scottish Football Association}}</ref>\n\nThe first meeting of IFAB took place at the FA's offices at [[Holborn Viaduct]] in [[London]] on Wednesday 2 June 1886.<ref>[http://ssbra.org/html/laws/IFABarc/pdf/1886/18861ST.pdf The First Meeting of the International Football Association Board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007012127/http://ssbra.org/html/laws/IFABarc/pdf/1886/18861ST.pdf |date=2007-10-07 }} Soccer South Bay Referee Association</ref><ref>[http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/TheOrganisation/Postings/2004/03/HISTORY_OF_THE_FA.htm TheFA.com - History of The FA] Football Association</ref> The FA, SFA, FAW and IFA each had equal voting rights.\n\n[[FIFA|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)]], the international [[sport governing body|organising body]] for the sport, was formed in [[Paris]] in 1904 and declared that, regarding the Laws of the Game itself, they would enforce the rules laid down by IFAB.  In 1912, FIFA requested that its representatives be included in IFAB. At a special meeting held in January 1913 in [[Wrexham]], IFAB agreed to FIFA's request.  The first regular IFAB meeting to include FIFA occurred in June 1913.  Each association (including FIFA) was entitled to send two representatives, with a four-fifths majority required to change the laws (thus that the UK associations could still change the laws against FIFA's wishes if they all voted together).  One more meeting of IFAB was held, in [[Paris]] in 1914, before regular meetings were curtailed by the [[First World War]].\n\nFor the first four post-war IFAB meetings (1920, 1921, 1922, and 1923), FIFA was once again excluded, on account of a dispute between FIFA and the home nations.  From 1924, once the dispute had been resolved, FIFA once again attended IFAB  meetings. In 1958, the Board agreed on its current voting system.\n\nSince Irish partition in 1921, the IFA has evolved to become the organising body for football in Northern Ireland, with football in the [[Republic of Ireland]] being organised by the [[Football Association of Ireland|FAI]].  A request for the FAI to become a member of IFAB was denied at the 1923 annual general meeting.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1923min.pdf |title=Minutes of the 1923 Annual
