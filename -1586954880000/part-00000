The Japanese government established the Casino Administration Committee in 2020 to supervise and manage Japan's resort operators.\n\nA number of fictional franchises focus on gambling in Japan.\n\n==Public sports==\n''K\u014dei ky\u014dgi'' (\u516c\u55b6\u7af6\u6280, public sports) are public races that can be gambled on legally. There are four types: [[horse racing]], [[Keirin#Keirin in Japan|bicycle racing]], [[Ky\u014dtei|powerboat racing]], and [[Auto Race (Japanese sport)|asphalt speedway]] [[motorcycle speedway|motorcycle racing]]. They are allowed by special laws and are regulated by local governments or governmental corporations.\n\nThe prize pool for gamblers on these races are about 75-80% of total sales. Betting tickets are available at numerous circuits and ticket booths within many cities.\n\n==Lottery==\n[[File:Takarakuji Ikebukuro 2011.jpg|thumb|Small street shop, in [[Ikebukuro]], selling takarakuji tickets.]]\nTakarakuji (\u5b9d\u304f\u3058), i.e., lotteries, are held by [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]] or [[City designated by government ordinance|large cities]] on a regular basis all throughout the calendar year.\n\nThere are three main types of lotteries: unique number lotteries, selected number lotteries, and scratch cards. Each lottery ticket is sold at 100 to 500 yen, and the top cash prizes are usually 100 million yen or more.\n\nThe takarakuji law stipulates that the entire prize pool for any given lottery is to be less than 50% of total sales, with the rest going to local government organizations and charities. \n\nTakarakuji tickets are available at takarakuji booth and stores in many cities, with some outlets becoming particularly popular.<ref>[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2009/11/30/business/takarakuji-whats-chance-got-to-do-with-it/#.Xk18iC2ZPOQ japantimes.com]</ref> Tickets for selected number lotteries can be also bought at some [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]s.\n\n==Pachinko==\n{{main article|Pachinko}}\n[[Pachinko]] is a [[pinball]]-like [[slot machine]] game. It is officially not considered gambling because Japanese laws regard pachinko as an exception to the criminal code on gambling for historical, monetary, and cultural reasons. Pachinko parlours can be found all over Japan, and they are operated by private companies. As of 2011, there are about 12,480 pachinko parlors in Japan.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031822/http://www.majiroxnews.com/2011/04/21/gov-sparks-pachinko-bashing/: Gov. sparks pachinko bashing]</ref> In 2018, Japan spent $200 billion on pachinko each year. Also, \"nearly half of all leisure time in Japan\" was spent in pachinko parlours.<ref>[https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-pachinko-gambling-japan-2018-7 businessinsider.com]</ref>\n\nIn pachinko, when a player's ball makes it into a special hole to activate the slot machine and a jackpot is made, they are rewarded with more balls.

The Japanese government established the Casino Administration Committee in 2020 to supervise and manage Japan's resort operators.\n\nA number of fictional franchises focus on gambling in Japan.\n\n==Public sports==\n''K\u014dei ky\u014dgi'' (\u516c\u55b6\u7af6\u6280, public sports) are public races that people in Japan can gamble on legally. There are four different types of ''k\u014dei ky\u014dgi'': [[horse racing]], [[Keirin#Keirin in Japan|bicycle racing]], [[Ky\u014dtei|powerboat racing]], and [[Auto Race (Japanese sport)|asphalt speedway]] [[motorcycle speedway|motorcycle racing]]. They are allowed by special laws and are regulated by local governments or governmental corporations.\n\nThe prize pool for the gamblers of these races are about 75-80% of total sales. Betting tickets are available at countless circuits and ticket booths within many cities, such as [[Tokyo]], [[Osaka]], [[Yokohama]], and [[Nagoya]].\n\n==Lottery==\n[[File:Takarakuji Ikebukuro 2011.jpg|thumb|Small street shop, in [[Ikebukuro]], selling takarakuji tickets.]]\nTakarakuji (\u5b9d\u304f\u3058), i.e., lotteries, are held by [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]] or [[City designated by government ordinance|large cities]] on a regular basis all throughout the calendar year.\n\nThere are three main types of lotteries: unique number lotteries, selected number lotteries, and scratch cards. Each lottery ticket is sold at 100 to 500 yen, and the top cash prizes are usually 100 million yen or more.\n\nThe takarakuji law stipulates that the entire prize pool for any given lottery is to be less than 50% of total sales, with the rest going to local government organizations and charities. \n\nTakarakuji tickets are available at takarakuji booth and stores in many cities, with some outlets becoming particularly popular.<ref>[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2009/11/30/business/takarakuji-whats-chance-got-to-do-with-it/#.Xk18iC2ZPOQ japantimes.com]</ref> Tickets for selected number lotteries can be also bought at some [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]s.\n\n==Pachinko==\n{{main article|Pachinko}}\n[[Pachinko]] is a [[pinball]]-like [[slot machine]] game. It is officially not considered gambling because Japanese laws regard pachinko as an exception to the criminal code on gambling for historical, monetary, and cultural reasons. Pachinko parlours can be found all over Japan, and they are operated by private companies. As of 2011, there are about 12,480 pachinko parlors in Japan.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031822/http://www.majiroxnews.com/2011/04/21/gov-sparks-pachinko-bashing/: Gov. sparks pachinko bashing]</ref> In 2018, Japan spent $200 billion on pachinko each year. Also, \"nearly half of all leisure time in Japan\" was spent in pachinko parlours.<ref>[https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-pachinko-gambling-japan-2018-7 businessinsider.com]</ref>\n\nIn pachinko, when a player's ball makes it into a special hole to activate the slot machine and a jackpot is made, they are rewarded with more balls. Players can then exchange the balls for prizes of different value at a booth in the parlour. Money cannot be awarded at pachinko parlors as this would be in violation of the criminal code. However, players almost always exchange pachinko balls for special tokens, usually slips of gold encased in plastic, and then \"sell\" them at a neighboring shop for cash.

Unlike ''The Daily Show'', Oliver tends to explore one concept in depth but retains the appearance of commercial breaks to intercut larger topics with smaller segments that are not necessarily related to the topic at hand. The show is taped in front of a [[studio audience]], and HBO offers a limited number of free tickets to attend each week's ''Last Week Tonight'' taping. As of March 15, 2020 the show is being filmed with no live audience at an unspecified studio location due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\nThe show's theme starts off every episode containing images relating to it or the world at large with satirical captions written in [[dog Latin]]. Each episode covers a small handful of shorter segments, and then one main segment. While the short segments almost always relate to recent news, the episode's main segment usually covers in length and detail a political issue, even if that issue did not have news media attention during the preceding week. On occasion, the short segments are omitted and the main segment takes up the entirety of the episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/2/14/10989154/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-season-3|last=Framke|first=Caroline|title=John Oliver on making Last Week Tonight and why he won't focus on the 2016 election|website=Vox|date=February 14, 2016|accessdate=March 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320052802/http://www.vox.com/2016/2/14/10989154/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-season-3|archive-date=March 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOliver injects humor into his presentation, including satirical [[analogies]], and allusions to popular culture and celebrities. The show includes a panel in the upper-left corner that frequently displays a photo or graphic for that accompanies subject at hand, which aids in the humor. A full-screen graphic will show and play a video clip (such as excerpts from news show or documentaries) when Oliver is citing it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2014/07/why-last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-is-the-next-generation-of-late-night-23696/|title=Why 'Last Week Tonight With John Oliver' is The Next Generation of Late Night|last=Miller|first=Liz Shannon|website=IndieWire|language=en|date=July 29, 2014|accessdate=September 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904015651/http://www.indiewire.com/2014/07/why-last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-is-the-next-generation-of-late-night-23696/|archive-date=September 4, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> He often coins [[hashtag|hashtags]] related to his segment for use in [[social media]], some of which go [[Viral phenomenon|viral]].<ref name=Emertainment>{{cite web|url=http://emertainmentmonthly.com/index.php/how-john-oliver-gets-social-media-right-while-the-rest-of-traditional-media-fails/|last=Solomon|first=Emily|title=How John Oliver Gets Social Media Right While the Rest of Traditional Media Fails|work=Emertainment Monthly|date=April 12, 2015|accessdate=June 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404222905/http://emertainmentmonthly.com/index.php/how-john-oliver-gets-social-media-right-while-the-rest-of-traditional-media-fails/|archive-date=April 4, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA recurring element of the show is Oliver's use of mascots. The mascots used in the show include Jeff the Diseased Lung in a Cowboy Hat, Hoots the NSA Owl, Taryn the Tinder Chicken, and the Last Week Tonight puppets.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.ranker.com/list/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-mascots/ranker-tv | title=All the Mascot Costumes from Last Week Tonight, Ranked}}</ref> Oliver told Vulture in February 2019, \"I mean, the truth of the mascots is that we have a gigantic room filled with spectacular mascot costumes now.

Some of the episodes will follow up the main segment with another video compilation or news story. Oliver's speech is broken up with video compilations of recent news clips, or recurring segments, into which Oliver segues with the slogan, \"And now, this.\" Oliver has also ended some segments with mock trailers for fictional TV shows or commercials that satirize the subject of his speech.\n\n=== Celebrity guests===\nThe show frequently features one or more celebrity guests in its segments to help Oliver better get his point on the week's topic across. Guests have featured in many different capacities including giving monologues directly to camera, being interviewed by Oliver, playing musical numbers, participating in comedic skits with or without Oliver, or starring in fictitious parody [[Public service announcement|PSAs]]. On the show, guests are sometimes seen in the Last Week Tonight studio itself doing their part during the show's main taping, while at other times they are seen in video clips that were pre-recorded at a different location and later included in the show. Oliver often interviews personalities who were directly involved in or impacted by the issues being discussed in the show to get their first-hand experiences and viewpoints on the issue. Some of the famous personalities Oliver has interviewed include [[Edward Snowden]], the [[14th Dalai Lama|14th]] [[Dalai Lama]], [[Anita Hill|Professor Anita Hill]] and [[Monica Lewinsky]].\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver episodes}}\n{{:List of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver episodes}}\n\n==YouTube channel==\n''Last Week Tonight'' has a [[YouTube]] channel where videos are intermittently (depending on series) added after a show has aired.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/LastWeekTonight |title=Last Week Tonight channel |access-date=March 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313183030/https://www.youtube.com/user/LastWeekTonight |archive-date=March 13, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Most of the videos are of the main segment from each episode.

During the eighteen-minute segment, Oliver discusses tobacco industry trends and practices. He also introduces Jeff the Diseased Lung, a mascot he created for the American global cigarette and tobacco company [[Philip Morris International]], the makers of [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] brand of cigarettes. The anthropomorphic diseased lung, who smokes and coughs, has been compared to Joe Camel and the [[Marlboro Man]]. Oliver and his team promoted the cartoon character by sending shirts with Jeff's image to [[Togo]] and displaying billboards in [[Uruguay]], and by encouraging use of the hashtag #JeffWeCan, which trended on Twitter following the broadcast.\n\nThe segment received widespread media coverage, with several outlets praising Oliver's ability to launch successful marketing campaigns and change perceptions about smoking through the creation of the mascot. The mascot later made an appearance at a protest organized by the \"Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids\" in New York City in May 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicaldaily.com/john-olivers-jeff-diseased-lung-hits-times-square-anti-smoking-awareness-flash-mob-332252|last=Olson|first=Samantha|title=John Oliver's 'Jeff The Diseased Lung' Hits Times Square For Anti-Smoking Awareness Flash Mob|date=May 6, 2015|work=Medical Daily|access-date=September 3, 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915181858/http://www.medicaldaily.com/john-olivers-jeff-diseased-lung-hits-times-square-anti-smoking-awareness-flash-mob-332252|archive-date=September 15, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickbuttsday.org/index.php/updates/detail/2015_05_22_nyc|title=Youth advocates head to New York City to #StopMarlboro - Kick Butts Day|last=Olmstead|first=Erica|website=Kick Butts Day|date=May 22, 2015|access-date=September 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619163701/https://www.kickbuttsday.org/index.php/updates/detail/2015_05_22_nyc|archive-date=June 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nPhilip Morris International issued a response to the segment, stating that it included \"many mischaracterizations\" of the company.<ref name=Parker>{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Ryan|title=John Oliver targets cigarettes on 'Last Week Tonight'; Philip Morris reacts|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-philip-morris-john-oliver-20150216-story.html|accessdate=November 24, 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122195954/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-philip-morris-john-oliver-20150216-story.html|archive-date=November 22, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Stranger Than Truth: John Oliver's 101 Favorite History Lies ===\nIn the Mandatory Minimums segment that aired on July 25, 2015, John Oliver talked about the controversial history of presidential pardoning, claiming that Abraham Lincoln once pardoned a man convicted of bestiality because he was intoxicated at the time; the man in question being John Wilkes Booth. He then confessed the statement was not true and for the first time mentioned a book compiling his favorite history lies.\n\nA couple of weeks later, he published a web-exclusive video  based on that reference, expanding the content for a book called \"Stranger Than Truth: John Oliver's 101 Favorite History Lies\", to be released in the following spring. At the end of the mini-segment, however, he confesses again that the entire book was also a lie.\n\nIn what seems a continuation of the lie saga, the book surprisingly appeared on Amazon UK in October 2018.\n\nThe book description reads as follow: <blockquote>There is absolutely nothing more fun than lying confidently about history. Lying is incredibly fun. In fact, the only thing that feels better than lying to someone is lying to someone, then regaining their trust, and then lying to them again. This book, for example, was promised to be released in April 2016. But that was a lie. The plan was always October 2018. Because, you know, now is a time in history when lying openly gets you elected to office. </blockquote><blockquote>In this book, you will find plenty of plausible but completely unverifiable nonsense. Almost like watching Fox News but with a better sense of humour. Hopefully, it will teach you much about nothing other than the true joy of lying to people. Honestly, there has never been a better moment in history to be a liar. We have reached a point where truths have become lies and lies are now the truth. So learn from the greatest and get inspired by the best lies in history. </blockquote><blockquote>*NB: Most profits from this book are going to finance railway infrastructure under the English Channel.

He did this partly as a way to demonstrate how \"disturbingly easy\" it is, in terms of paperwork, to set up a [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt]] religious organization as viewed by the [[Internal Revenue Service]].

The jockstrap reappeared in a skit in the final episode of the 2018 season of the show.\n\n===Robocalls===\nThe March 10, 2019, episode dealt primarily with [[robocalls]], and how the problem had mushroomed in recent years since being increasingly deregulated under [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC Chairman]] [[Ajit Pai]]. To prove the point of how easy it was for any company to begin flooding anyone with robocalls, Oliver had one of his IT techs develop a system in which all of the FCC chairs would, at regular intervals on their personal phone numbers, receive a robocall followed immediately by [[bagpipe]] music. Oliver freely admitted his astonishment at just how easy this was to accomplish; the IT technician tasked with setting the system up told him they needed only 15 minutes to complete the project, doing so on a minimal budget. And per the very FCC regulations currently in place, Oliver quickly scrolled a section of fine print on screen at a random time during the segment, in which his office address was randomly embedded, and each FCC chair was required to send him an official letter to that address, notifying him in writing that they wished to have him cease all robocalls forthwith. Oliver was also flabbergasted at discovering that while tens of millions of dollars in fines were levied against companies for violating robocall regulations, only a few thousand dollars have ever been collected, effectively giving the companies free rein to continue robocalling unabated.\n\n===''Guinness World Records''===\nThe main story of the August 11, 2019 episode was [[Turkmenistan]] and its autocratic leader [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow]]. The last portion of the segment centered around Berdimuhamedow's obsession with ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', with the Turkmen capital of [[Ashgabat]] being home to the most buildings with white marble cladding, the largest indoor [[Ferris wheel]], and the largest statue of a horse's head, among others. Oliver found that ''Guinness World Records'' received sums of money ranging from US$12,000 to US$500,000 from companies and authoritarian nations to set records for publicity. He ended the show with a 600 square foot [[marble cake]] adorned with a picture of Berdimuhamedow falling from a horse; he had requested a Guinness adjudicator to certify it as the world's largest marble cake, a record previously set by [[Betty Crocker]] in Saudi Arabia in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.generalmills.com/2017/09/a-gift-fresh-from-the-heart-in-saudi-arabia/|title=A gift 'fresh from the heart' in Saudi Arabia|website=General Mills|language=en|date=September 27, 2017|access-date=August 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815165112/https://blog.generalmills.com/2017/09/a-gift-fresh-from-the-heart-in-saudi-arabia/|archive-date=August 15, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Guinness refused, stating that because their brand was \"aligned with kids and families\", they would not send an adjudicator; Oliver mockingly commented that he didn't \"run a brutal enough dictatorship to meet Guinness World Records' high ethical standards\". Oliver claimed that Guinness offered to certify it after the fact only if he signed an agreement not to criticize their practices on the show, which Oliver dismissed as \"ridiculous\".<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9QYu8LtH2E |title=Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver |date=August 11, 2019 |author=HBO |access-date=August 15, 2019 |via=YouTube |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815170404/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9QYu8LtH2E&gl=US&hl=en |archive-date=August 15, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/5648682/john-oliver-turkmenistan-cake/|title=John Oliver Bakes Very Large Cake to Annoy Turkmenistan|website=Time|language=en|access-date=August 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190814150445/https://time.com/5648682/john-oliver-turkmenistan-cake/|archive-date=August 14, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Guinness called Oliver's allegations \"false and unfair\", claiming that they did not send an adjudicator because they felt the cake was specifically for the purpose of mocking a record holder, stating it was their policy \"not to partake in any activities which may belittle their achievements or subject them to ridicule\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2019/8/guinness-world-records-on-last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-586398/|title=Guinness World Records on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver|date=August 12, 2019|website=Guinness World Records|language=en-GB|access-date=August 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190813023105/https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2019/8/guinness-world-records-on-last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-586398/|archive-date=August 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Narendra Modi===\n\nJohn Oliver extensively satirized Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] in a broadcast which went online on February 23, 2020 calling him a temporary symbol of hate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIXUhZ2AWs |title=Last Week Tonight With John Oliver |publisher=Last Week Tonight |accessdate=March 8, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> This was during a visit of US President [[Donald Trump]] to India, and in an [[Namaste Trump|organized rally]] which unexpectedly coincided with [[North East Delhi riots|large-scale violence in Delhi]], the country's capital.

Unlike ''The Daily Show'', Oliver tends to explore one concept in depth but retains the appearance of commercial breaks to intercut larger topics with smaller segments that are not necessarily related to the topic at hand. The show is taped in front of a [[studio audience]], and HBO offers a limited number of free tickets to attend each week's ''Last Week Tonight'' taping.\n\nThe show's theme starts off every episode containing images relating to it or the world at large with satirical captions written in [[dog Latin]]. Each episode covers a small handful of shorter segments, and then one main segment. While the short segments almost always relate to recent news, the episode's main segment usually covers in length and detail a political issue, even if that issue did not have news media attention during the preceding week. On occasion, the short segments are omitted and the main segment takes up the entirety of the episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/2/14/10989154/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-season-3|last=Framke|first=Caroline|title=John Oliver on making Last Week Tonight and why he won't focus on the 2016 election|website=Vox|date=February 14, 2016|accessdate=March 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320052802/http://www.vox.com/2016/2/14/10989154/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-season-3|archive-date=March 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOliver injects humor into his presentation, including satirical [[analogies]], and allusions to popular culture and celebrities. The show includes a panel in the upper-left corner that frequently displays a photo or graphic for that accompanies subject at hand, which aids in the humor. A full-screen graphic will show and play a video clip (such as excerpts from news show or documentaries) when Oliver is citing it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2014/07/why-last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-is-the-next-generation-of-late-night-23696/|title=Why 'Last Week Tonight With John Oliver' is The Next Generation of Late Night|last=Miller|first=Liz Shannon|website=IndieWire|language=en|date=July 29, 2014|accessdate=September 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904015651/http://www.indiewire.com/2014/07/why-last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-is-the-next-generation-of-late-night-23696/|archive-date=September 4, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> He often coins [[hashtag|hashtags]] related to his segment for use in [[social media]], some of which go [[Viral phenomenon|viral]].<ref name=Emertainment>{{cite web|url=http://emertainmentmonthly.com/index.php/how-john-oliver-gets-social-media-right-while-the-rest-of-traditional-media-fails/|last=Solomon|first=Emily|title=How John Oliver Gets Social Media Right While the Rest of Traditional Media Fails|work=Emertainment Monthly|date=April 12, 2015|accessdate=June 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404222905/http://emertainmentmonthly.com/index.php/how-john-oliver-gets-social-media-right-while-the-rest-of-traditional-media-fails/|archive-date=April 4, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA recurring element of the show is Oliver's use of mascots. The mascots used in the show include Jeff the Diseased Lung in a Cowboy Hat, Hoots the NSA Owl, Taryn the Tinder Chicken, and the Last Week Tonight puppets.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.ranker.com/list/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-mascots/ranker-tv | title=All the Mascot Costumes from Last Week Tonight, Ranked}}</ref> Oliver told Vulture in February 2019, \"I mean, the truth of the mascots is that we have a gigantic room filled with spectacular mascot costumes now.

Some of the episodes will follow up the main segment with another video compilation or news story. Oliver's speech is broken up with video compilations of recent news clips, or recurring segments, into which Oliver segues with the slogan, \"And now, this.\" Oliver has also ended some segments with mock trailers for fictional TV shows or commercials that satirize the subject of his speech.\n\n=== Celebrity guests===\nThe show frequently features one or more celebrity guests in its segments to help Oliver better get his point on the week's topic across. Guests have featured in many different capacities including giving monologues directly to camera, being interviewed by Oliver, playing musical numbers, participating in comedic skits with or without Oliver, or starring in fictitious parody [[Public service announcement|PSAs]]. On the show, guests are sometimes seen in the Last Week Tonight studio itself doing their part during the show's main taping, while at other times they are seen in video clips that were pre-recorded at a different location and later included in the show. Oliver often interviews personalities who were directly involved in or impacted by the issues being discussed in the show to get their first-hand experiences and viewpoints on the issue. Some of the famous personalities Oliver has interviewed include [[Edward Snowden]], the [[14th Dalai Lama|14th]] [[Dalai Lama]], [[Anita Hill|Professor Anita Hill]] and [[Monica Lewinsky]].\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver episodes}}\n{{:List of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver episodes}}\n\n==YouTube channel==\n''Last Week Tonight'' has a [[YouTube]] channel where videos are intermittently (depending on series) added after a show has aired.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/LastWeekTonight |title=Last Week Tonight channel |access-date=March 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313183030/https://www.youtube.com/user/LastWeekTonight |archive-date=March 13, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Most of the videos are of the main segment from each episode.

During the eighteen-minute segment, Oliver discusses tobacco industry trends and practices. He also introduces Jeff the Diseased Lung, a mascot he created for the American global cigarette and tobacco company [[Philip Morris International]], the makers of [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] brand of cigarettes. The anthropomorphic diseased lung, who smokes and coughs, has been compared to Joe Camel and the [[Marlboro Man]]. Oliver and his team promoted the cartoon character by sending shirts with Jeff's image to [[Togo]] and displaying billboards in [[Uruguay]], and by encouraging use of the hashtag #JeffWeCan, which trended on Twitter following the broadcast.\n\nThe segment received widespread media coverage, with several outlets praising Oliver's ability to launch successful marketing campaigns and change perceptions about smoking through the creation of the mascot. The mascot later made an appearance at a protest organized by the \"Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids\" in New York City in May 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicaldaily.com/john-olivers-jeff-diseased-lung-hits-times-square-anti-smoking-awareness-flash-mob-332252|last=Olson|first=Samantha|title=John Oliver's 'Jeff The Diseased Lung' Hits Times Square For Anti-Smoking Awareness Flash Mob|date=May 6, 2015|work=Medical Daily|access-date=September 3, 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915181858/http://www.medicaldaily.com/john-olivers-jeff-diseased-lung-hits-times-square-anti-smoking-awareness-flash-mob-332252|archive-date=September 15, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickbuttsday.org/index.php/updates/detail/2015_05_22_nyc|title=Youth advocates head to New York City to #StopMarlboro - Kick Butts Day|last=Olmstead|first=Erica|website=Kick Butts Day|date=May 22, 2015|access-date=September 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619163701/https://www.kickbuttsday.org/index.php/updates/detail/2015_05_22_nyc|archive-date=June 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nPhilip Morris International issued a response to the segment, stating that it included \"many mischaracterizations\" of the company.<ref name=Parker>{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Ryan|title=John Oliver targets cigarettes on 'Last Week Tonight'; Philip Morris reacts|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-philip-morris-john-oliver-20150216-story.html|accessdate=November 24, 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122195954/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-philip-morris-john-oliver-20150216-story.html|archive-date=November 22, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Stranger Than Truth: John Oliver's 101 Favorite History Lies ===\nIn the Mandatory Minimums segment that aired on July 25, 2015, John Oliver talked about the controversial history of presidential pardoning, claiming that Abraham Lincoln once pardoned a man convicted of bestiality because he was intoxicated at the time; the man in question being John Wilkes Booth. He then confessed the statement was not true and for the first time mentioned a book compiling his favorite history lies.\n\nA couple of weeks later, he published a web-exclusive video  based on that reference, expanding the content for a book called \"Stranger Than Truth: John Oliver's 101 Favorite History Lies\", to be released in the following spring. At the end of the mini-segment, however, he confesses again that the entire book was also a lie.\n\nIn what seems a continuation of the lie saga, the book surprisingly appeared on Amazon UK in October 2018.\n\nThe book description reads as follow: <blockquote>There is absolutely nothing more fun than lying confidently about history. Lying is incredibly fun. In fact, the only thing that feels better than lying to someone is lying to someone, then regaining their trust, and then lying to them again. This book, for example, was promised to be released in April 2016. But that was a lie. The plan was always October 2018. Because, you know, now is a time in history when lying openly gets you elected to office. </blockquote><blockquote>In this book, you will find plenty of plausible but completely unverifiable nonsense. Almost like watching Fox News but with a better sense of humour. Hopefully, it will teach you much about nothing other than the true joy of lying to people. Honestly, there has never been a better moment in history to be a liar. We have reached a point where truths have become lies and lies are now the truth. So learn from the greatest and get inspired by the best lies in history. </blockquote><blockquote>*NB: Most profits from this book are going to finance railway infrastructure under the English Channel.

He did this partly as a way to demonstrate how \"disturbingly easy\" it is, in terms of paperwork, to set up a [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt]] religious organization as viewed by the [[Internal Revenue Service]].

The jockstrap reappeared in a skit in the final episode of the 2018 season of the show.\n\n===Robocalls===\nThe March 10, 2019, episode dealt primarily with [[robocalls]], and how the problem had mushroomed in recent years since being increasingly deregulated under [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC Chairman]] [[Ajit Pai]]. To prove the point of how easy it was for any company to begin flooding anyone with robocalls, Oliver had one of his IT techs develop a system in which all of the FCC chairs would, at regular intervals on their personal phone numbers, receive a robocall followed immediately by [[bagpipe]] music. Oliver freely admitted his astonishment at just how easy this was to accomplish; the IT technician tasked with setting the system up told him they needed only 15 minutes to complete the project, doing so on a minimal budget. And per the very FCC regulations currently in place, Oliver quickly scrolled a section of fine print on screen at a random time during the segment, in which his office address was randomly embedded, and each FCC chair was required to send him an official letter to that address, notifying him in writing that they wished to have him cease all robocalls forthwith. Oliver was also flabbergasted at discovering that while tens of millions of dollars in fines were levied against companies for violating robocall regulations, only a few thousand dollars have ever been collected, effectively giving the companies free rein to continue robocalling unabated.\n\n===''Guinness World Records''===\nThe main story of the August 11, 2019 episode was [[Turkmenistan]] and its autocratic leader [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow]]. The last portion of the segment centered around Berdimuhamedow's obsession with ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', with the Turkmen capital of [[Ashgabat]] being home to the most buildings with white marble cladding, the largest indoor [[Ferris wheel]], and the largest statue of a horse's head, among others. Oliver found that ''Guinness World Records'' received sums of money ranging from US$12,000 to US$500,000 from companies and authoritarian nations to set records for publicity. He ended the show with a 600 square foot [[marble cake]] adorned with a picture of Berdimuhamedow falling from a horse; he had requested a Guinness adjudicator to certify it as the world's largest marble cake, a record previously set by [[Betty Crocker]] in Saudi Arabia in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.generalmills.com/2017/09/a-gift-fresh-from-the-heart-in-saudi-arabia/|title=A gift 'fresh from the heart' in Saudi Arabia|website=General Mills|language=en|date=September 27, 2017|access-date=August 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815165112/https://blog.generalmills.com/2017/09/a-gift-fresh-from-the-heart-in-saudi-arabia/|archive-date=August 15, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Guinness refused, stating that because their brand was \"aligned with kids and families\", they would not send an adjudicator; Oliver mockingly commented that he didn't \"run a brutal enough dictatorship to meet Guinness World Records' high ethical standards\". Oliver claimed that Guinness offered to certify it after the fact only if he signed an agreement not to criticize their practices on the show, which Oliver dismissed as \"ridiculous\".<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9QYu8LtH2E |title=Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver |date=August 11, 2019 |author=HBO |access-date=August 15, 2019 |via=YouTube |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815170404/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9QYu8LtH2E&gl=US&hl=en |archive-date=August 15, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/5648682/john-oliver-turkmenistan-cake/|title=John Oliver Bakes Very Large Cake to Annoy Turkmenistan|website=Time|language=en|access-date=August 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190814150445/https://time.com/5648682/john-oliver-turkmenistan-cake/|archive-date=August 14, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Guinness called Oliver's allegations \"false and unfair\", claiming that they did not send an adjudicator because they felt the cake was specifically for the purpose of mocking a record holder, stating it was their policy \"not to partake in any activities which may belittle their achievements or subject them to ridicule\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2019/8/guinness-world-records-on-last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-586398/|title=Guinness World Records on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver|date=August 12, 2019|website=Guinness World Records|language=en-GB|access-date=August 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190813023105/https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2019/8/guinness-world-records-on-last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-586398/|archive-date=August 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Narendra Modi===\n\nJohn Oliver extensively satirized Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] in a broadcast which went online on February 23, 2020 calling him a temporary symbol of hate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIXUhZ2AWs |title=Last Week Tonight With John Oliver |publisher=Last Week Tonight |accessdate=March 8, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> This was during a visit of US President [[Donald Trump]] to India, and in an [[Namaste Trump|organized rally]] which unexpectedly coincided with [[North East Delhi riots|large-scale violence in Delhi]], the country's capital.

He is the guitarist, singer, and a founding member of the progressive rock band, [[Cynic (band)|Cynic]]. He has remained a continual member for nearly three decades and has developed numerous other projects including [[\u00c6on Spoke]], Onward with Love, and recent his solo work. Masvidal was ranked in ''[[Loudwire]]''<nowiki/>'s 66 Best Hard Rock + Metal Guitarists Of All Time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/top-hard-rock-metal-guitarists-of-all-time/|title=The 66 Best Hard Rock + Metal Guitarists of All Time|last=Staff|first=Loudwire|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> and 50 Best Metal Songwriters of All Time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/best-metal-songwriters/|title=50 Best Metal Songwriters of All Time|last=DiVita|first=Joe|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early years were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar with [[Carlos Molina (guitarist)|Carlos Molina]], and in college, with jazz musician, Dave Weissbrot who inspired his love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to [[Buddhist philosophy]]. Masvidal developed an interest in mysticism and esoteric topics from a young age, becoming an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and eventually a practitioner of [[Buddhist meditation]] by his late 20s. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] In Miami, where the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups, Crypha and Seaweed. Masvidal's eclectic musical tastes ranging from classical to rock, jazz, fusion, and metal along with a innate passion for mysticism came to inform much of his work with Cynic and other projects. Masvidal wrote in detail about early life experiences in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nMasvidal co-founded Cynic with drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in the late 80\u2019s, having released four demos from 1988-1991 that circulated in the underground tape trading community. Masvidal developed a reputation in the South Florida music scene for his musicianship and attention began to grow quickly around the band. In 1989, while still in high school, Masvidal toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]], but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular act, but Masvidal persevered with Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990. In 1991, Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert were recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''. In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine placed the album as the 70th greatest metal album of all time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-100-greatest-metal-albums-of-all-time-113614/|title=The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time|last=Christe|first=Christopher R.

Masvidal's early years were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar with [[Carlos Molina (guitarist)|Carlos Molina]], and in college, with jazz musician, Dave Weissbrot who inspired his love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to [[Buddhist philosophy]]. Masvidal developed an interest in mysticism and esoteric topics from a young age, becoming an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and eventually a practitioner of [[Buddhist meditation]] by his late 20s. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] In Miami, where the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups, Crypha and Seaweed. Masvidal's eclectic musical tastes ranging from classical to rock, jazz, fusion, and metal along with a innate passion for mysticism came to inform much of his work with Cynic and other projects. Masvidal wrote in detail about early life experiences in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nMasvidal co-founded Cynic with drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in the late 80\u2019s, having released four demos from 1988-1991 that circulated in the underground tape trading community. Masvidal developed a reputation in the South Florida music scene for his musicianship and attention began to grow quickly around the band. In 1989, while still in high school, Masvidal toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]], but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular act, but Masvidal persevered with Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990. In 1991, Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert were recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''. In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine placed the album as the 70th greatest metal album of all time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-100-greatest-metal-albums-of-all-time-113614/|title=The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time|last=Christe|first=Christopher R.

The route crosses the [[Black Mountains, Wales|Black Mountains]], the [[Shropshire Hills]], including the many ups and downs of the 'Switchback', the [[Eglwyseg]] moors north of [[Llangollen]] and the [[Clwydian Range]]. \n\nThe route passes through the counties of [[Monmouthshire]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[Powys]], [[Herefordshire]], [[Shropshire]], [[Wrexham County Borough|Wrexham]], [[Denbighshire]] and [[Flintshire]]. The [[Welsh Marches]] (Marchia Wallie) is a term used to describe this border region between England and Wales, since it was recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite
