In 2002, she won the [[American Idol (season 1)|inaugural season]] of the television competition ''[[American Idol]]'' and was immediately signed to a {{USD}}1 million recording deal with [[RCA Records]].<ref name=\"RCA Record Deal\" /> She made her chart debut in September 2002 with the [[A-side and B-side|double A-side]] single \"[[Before Your Love]]\" / \"[[A Moment Like This]]\", which topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in the United States by achieving the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Song achievements#Biggest jump to number one|biggest jump to number one]].<ref name=\"BillboarHot100Jump\" /> Her debut album, ''[[Thankful (Kelly Clarkson album)|Thankful]]'', was released in April 2003 and debuted atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in the United States and was certified in four countries, including a [[RIAA certification|double-platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Its lead single, \"[[Miss Independent (Kelly Clarkson song)|Miss Independent]]\", charted in nine countries, reaching number nine on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Subsequent singles from the album include \"[[Low (Kelly Clarkson song)|Low]]\" and \"[[The Trouble with Love Is]]\". In 2004, Clarkson released her second album, ''[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|Breakaway]]'', which incorporated aspects of pop rock. ''Breakaway'' debuted at number three on the ''Billboard'' 200 and subsequently became her most successful studio album to date, being certified sextuple-platinum in the United States and twelve million worldwide.<ref name=\"Breakaway worldwide sales\" /> Its first four singles, \"[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson song)|Breakaway]]\", \"[[Since U Been Gone]]\", \"[[Behind These Hazel Eyes]]\", and \"[[Because of You (Kelly Clarkson song)|Because of You]]\", became successful hits worldwide, charting at the top ten in many countries, and with the latter-most topping the charts in the Netherlands and Switzerland. Its final single, \"[[Walk Away (Kelly Clarkson song)|Walk Away]]\", became a top-twenty hit in many countries.\n\nClarkson's third studio album, ''[[My December]]'', which has a more rock-influenced sound than its predecessor, was released in June 2007. The album's release became a subject of a dispute with the music mogul and the then-Chairman and CEO of the [[RCA Music Group]] [[Clive Davis]], who wanted Clarkson to make significant changes and record new material for the album.<ref name=\"My December Time feature\" /><ref name=\"My December FOX News feature\" /> ''My December'' was later certified platinum by the RIAA, but failed to match the sales of its predecessor by suffering poor publicity for its uncommercial nature and thus became her least-commercially successful album in the United States to date. Its lead single, \"[[Never Again (Kelly Clarkson song)|Never Again]]\", became a top-ten hit in four countries, including the United States. Three more singles from the album, \"[[Sober (Kelly Clarkson song)|Sober]]\", \"[[One Minute]]\", and \"[[Don't Waste Your Time]]\", were released.\n\nIn March 2009, Clarkson released her fourth studio album, ''[[All I Ever Wanted (album)|All I Ever Wanted]]'', which contained elements of a more pop-oriented sound. The album debuted at the top of the ''Billboard'' 200 and became a commercial success. Its lead single \"[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]\", became an international hit; it topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 by breaking the record previously held by [[Britney Spears]]' \"[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]\" for the biggest jump to number one in the chart's history<ref name=\"BillboarHot100Jump\" /> and topped the charts in the United Kingdom, Canada and Hungary. Four subsequent singles, \"[[I Do Not Hook Up]]\", \"[[Already Gone (Kelly Clarkson song)|Already Gone]]\", \"[[All I Ever Wanted (Kelly Clarkson song)|All I Ever Wanted]]\" and \"[[Cry (Kelly Clarkson song)|Cry]]\",<ref name=\"Single - Cry\" /> were released, with the foremost two becoming top-twenty hits worldwide. In October 2011, Clarkson released her fifth studio album, ''[[Stronger (Kelly Clarkson album)|Stronger]]''. Its first two singles, \"[[Mr. Know It All]]\" and \"[[Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)]]\", became international top-ten hits, with the former topping the charts in Australia and South Korea and the latter topping the charts in the United States, Poland, and Slovakia. \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\" also became Clarkson's most commercially successful single in her career by selling over five million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"Stronger Worldwide single sales\" /> Its final single, \"[[Dark Side (Kelly Clarkson song)|Dark Side]]\", was released to moderate success. ''Stronger'' was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA.\n\nClarkson released her first [[greatest hits album]], ''[[Greatest Hits \u2013 Chapter One (Kelly Clarkson album)|Greatest Hits \u2013 Chapter One]]'',<ref name=\"Greatest Hits \u2014 Chapter 1 release\" /> in November 2012.<ref name=\"Single - Catch My Breath\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kellyclarkson.com/us/news/catch-my-breath |title=Kelly Clarkson \u2014 Catch My Breath \u2014 single release |work=KellyClarkson.com |publisher=[[Sony Music Entertainment]] |accessdate=October 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006232832/http://www.kellyclarkson.com/us/news/catch-my-breath |archivedate=October 6, 2012 }}</ref> Three songs were recorded for the compilation: \"[[Catch My Breath]]\", \"[[Don't Rush (song)|Don't Rush]]\" and \"[[People Like Us (Kelly Clarkson song)|People Like Us]]\"; all of which were released as singles.<ref name=\"Greatest Hits \u2014 Chapter 1 release\" /><ref name=\"Single - Catch My Breath\" /> ''Greatest Hits \u2013 Chapter One'' was eventually certified gold by the RIAA and was succeeded by the release of her sixth studio album and first [[Christmas album|Christmas-themed album]], ''[[Wrapped in Red]]'', in October 2013. The holiday album was accompanied by its singles \"[[Underneath the Tree]]\" and \"[[Wrapped in Red (song)|Wrapped in Red]]\".<ref name=\"Album - Wrapped in Red\" /> The album was quickly certified platinum by the RIAA. Clarkson released her seventh studio album, ''[[Piece by Piece (Kelly Clarkson album)|Piece by Piece]]'' in 2015, which spawned the singles \"[[Heartbeat Song (Kelly Clarkson song)|Heartbeat Song]]\", \"[[Invincible (Kelly Clarkson song)|Invincible]]\" and \"[[Piece by Piece (Kelly Clarkson song)|Piece by Piece]]\". She released her eighth studio album, ''[[Meaning of Life (album)|Meaning of Life]]'', on October 2017. The album included the singles \"[[Love So Soft]]\", \"[[I Don't Think About You]]\", and \"[[Heat (Kelly Clarkson song)|Heat]]\".

In 2002, she won the [[American Idol (season 1)|inaugural season]] of the television competition ''[[American Idol]]'' and was immediately signed to a {{USD}}1 million recording deal with [[RCA Records]].<ref name=\"RCA Record Deal\" /> She made her chart debut in September 2002 with the [[A-side and B-side|double A-side]] single \"[[Before Your Love]]\" / \"[[A Moment Like This]]\", which topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in the United States by achieving the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Song achievements#Biggest jump to number one|biggest jump to number one]].<ref name=\"BillboarHot100Jump\" /> Her debut album, ''[[Thankful (Kelly Clarkson album)|Thankful]]'', was released in April 2003 and debuted atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in the United States and was certified in four countries, including a [[RIAA certification|double-platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Its lead single, \"[[Miss Independent (Kelly Clarkson song)|Miss Independent]]\", charted in nine countries, reaching number nine on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Subsequent singles from the album include \"[[Low (Kelly Clarkson song)|Low]]\" and \"[[The Trouble with Love Is]]\". In 2004, Clarkson released her second album, ''[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|Breakaway]]'', which incorporated aspects of pop rock. ''Breakaway'' debuted at number three on the ''Billboard'' 200 and subsequently became her most successful studio album to date, being certified sextuple-platinum in the United States and twelve million worldwide.<ref name=\"Breakaway worldwide sales\" /> Its first four singles, \"[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson song)|Breakaway]]\", \"[[Since U Been Gone]]\", \"[[Behind These Hazel Eyes]]\", and \"[[Because of You (Kelly Clarkson song)|Because of You]]\", became successful hits worldwide, charting at the top-ten in many countries, and with the latter-most topping the charts in the Netherlands and Switzerland. Its final single, \"[[Walk Away (Kelly Clarkson song)|Walk Away]]\", became a top-twenty hit in many countries.\n\nClarkson's third studio album, ''[[My December]]'', which has a more rock-influenced sound than its predecessor, was released in June 2007. The album's release became a subject of a dispute with the music mogul and the then-Chairman and CEO of the [[RCA Music Group]] [[Clive Davis]], who wanted Clarkson to make significant changes and record new material for the album.<ref name=\"My December Time feature\" /><ref name=\"My December FOX News feature\" /> ''My December'' was later certified platinum by the RIAA, but failed to match the sales of its predecessor by suffering poor publicity for its uncommercial nature and thus became her least-commercially successful album in the United States to date. Its lead single, \"[[Never Again (Kelly Clarkson song)|Never Again]]\", became a top-ten hit in four countries, including the United States. Three more singles from the album, \"[[Sober (Kelly Clarkson song)|Sober]]\", \"[[One Minute]]\", and \"[[Don't Waste Your Time]]\", were released.\n\nIn March 2009, Clarkson released her fourth studio album, ''[[All I Ever Wanted (album)|All I Ever Wanted]]'', which contained elements of a more pop-oriented sound. The album debuted at the top of the ''Billboard'' 200 and became a commercial success. Its lead single \"[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]\", became an international hit; it topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 by breaking the record previously held by [[Britney Spears]]' \"[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]\" for the biggest jump to number one in the chart's history<ref name=\"BillboarHot100Jump\" /> and topped the charts in the United Kingdom, Canada and Hungary. Four subsequent singles, \"[[I Do Not Hook Up]]\", \"[[Already Gone (Kelly Clarkson song)|Already Gone]]\", \"[[All I Ever Wanted (Kelly Clarkson song)|All I Ever Wanted]]\" and \"[[Cry (Kelly Clarkson song)|Cry]]\",<ref name=\"Single - Cry\" /> were released, with the foremost two becoming top-twenty hits worldwide. In October 2011, Clarkson released her fifth studio album, ''[[Stronger (Kelly Clarkson album)|Stronger]]''. Its first two singles, \"[[Mr. Know It All]]\" and \"[[Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)]]\", became international top-ten hits, with the former topping the charts in Australia and South Korea and the latter topping the charts in the United States, Poland, and Slovakia. \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\" also became Clarkson's most commercially successful single in her career by selling over five million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"Stronger Worldwide single sales\" /> Its final single, \"[[Dark Side (Kelly Clarkson song)|Dark Side]]\", was released to moderate success. ''Stronger'' was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA.\n\nClarkson released her first [[greatest hits album]], ''[[Greatest Hits \u2013 Chapter One (Kelly Clarkson album)|Greatest Hits \u2013 Chapter One]]'',<ref name=\"Greatest Hits \u2014 Chapter 1 release\" /> in November 2012.<ref name=\"Single - Catch My Breath\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kellyclarkson.com/us/news/catch-my-breath |title=Kelly Clarkson \u2014 Catch My Breath \u2014 single release |work=KellyClarkson.com |publisher=[[Sony Music Entertainment]] |accessdate=October 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006232832/http://www.kellyclarkson.com/us/news/catch-my-breath |archivedate=October 6, 2012 }}</ref> Three songs were recorded for the compilation: \"[[Catch My Breath]]\", \"[[Don't Rush (song)|Don't Rush]]\" and \"[[People Like Us (Kelly Clarkson song)|People Like Us]]\"; all of which were released as singles.<ref name=\"Greatest Hits \u2014 Chapter 1 release\" /><ref name=\"Single - Catch My Breath\" /> ''Greatest Hits \u2013 Chapter One'' was eventually certified gold by the RIAA and was succeeded by the release of her sixth studio album and first [[Christmas album|Christmas-themed album]], ''[[Wrapped in Red]]'', in October 2013. The holiday album was accompanied by its singles \"[[Underneath the Tree]]\" and \"[[Wrapped in Red (song)|Wrapped in Red]]\".<ref name=\"Album - Wrapped in Red\" /> The album was quickly certified platinum by the RIAA. Clarkson released her seventh studio album, ''[[Piece by Piece (Kelly Clarkson album)|Piece by Piece]]'' in 2015, which spawned the singles \"[[Heartbeat Song (Kelly Clarkson song)|Heartbeat Song]]\", \"[[Invincible (Kelly Clarkson song)|Invincible]]\" and \"[[Piece by Piece (Kelly Clarkson song)|Piece by Piece]]\". She released her eighth studio album, ''[[Meaning of Life (album)|Meaning of Life]]'', on October 2017.

During the Han Dynasty, a marriage lacking a dowry or betrothal gift was seen as dishonorable. Only after gifts were exchanged would a marriage proceed; and the bride would be taken to live in the ancestral home of the new husband. Here, a wife was not only expected to live with the entirety of her husband's family, but to follow all of their rules and beliefs. Many families followed the Confucian teachings regarding honoring their elders. These rituals were passed down from father to son, official family lists were compiled, containing the names of all the sons and marital wives. So brides who did not produce a son were written out of family lists and forgotten. When a husband died, the bride was seen as the property of her spouse's family. Ransoms were set by some brides' families to get their daughters back, though never with her children, who remained in the property of her husband's family.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wiesner-Hanks|first1=Merry|title=Gender in history: global perspectives|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Malden, Mass|isbn=9781405189958|pages=29\u201330|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nJohn Engel, a professor of Family Resources at the [[University of Hawaii]], argues that the [[People's Republic of China]] established the [[New Marriage Law|Marriage Law of 1950]] to redistribute wealth and achieve a classless society. The law \"was intended to cause ... fundamental changes ... aimed at family revolution by destroying all former patterns ... and building up new relationships on the basis of the new law and new ethics.\"<ref name=\"engel\" /> Xiaorong Li, a researcher at the Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy at the University of Maryland, asserts that the Marriage Law of 1950 not only banned the most extreme forms of female subordination and oppression, but gave women the right to make their own marital decisions.<ref name=\"Xiaorong\">{{cite book|last=Li|first=Xiaorong|title=Gender Inequality in China and Cultural Relativismin Women, Culture and Development: A Study of Human Capabilities.|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|pages=407\u2013425}}</ref> The Marriage Law specifically prohibited [[concubinage]] and marriages when one party was sexually powerless, suffered from a venereal disease, [[leprosy]], or a mental disorder.<ref name=\"engel\" /> Seventy<!--I changed it from \"Thirty\".

Family planning is practiced.\"<ref name=\"engel\" /> Adults, both men and women, gained the right to lawful divorce.<ref name=\"Tamney4\" />\n\nTo fight the tenacity of tradition, Article 3 of the 1980 Marriage Law continued to ban concubinage, [[polygamy]], and [[bigamy]].<ref name=\"engel\" /> The Marriage Law of 1980, Article 3, forbade mercenary marriages in which a [[bride price]] or dowry is paid.<ref name=\"engel\" /> Although the law generally prohibited the exaction of money or gifts in connection with marriage arrangements, bride price and dowries were still practiced customs<!--Does it mean \"continued to be practiced (until when?)-->.<ref name=\"engel\" /> According to Li, the traditional business of selling women in exchange for marriage returned after the law gave women the right to select their husbands.<ref name=\"Xiaorong\" /> In 1990, 18,692 cases were investigated by Chinese authorities.<ref name=\"Xiaorong\" />\n\nBride price payments are still common in rural areas, though dowries have become smaller and less common;<ref name=\"engel\" /> in urban areas the dowry custom has nearly disappeared. The bride price custom has transformed into providing gifts for the bride or her family.<ref name=\"engel\" /> Article 4 of the 1980 marriage law banned the usage of compulsion or the interference of third parties, stating: \"marriage must be based upon the complete willingness of the two parties,\"<ref name=\"engel\" /> As Engel argues, the law also encouraged gender equality by making daughters just as valuable as sons, particularly in the potential for old-age insurance. Article 8 states: \"after a marriage has been registered, the woman may become a member of the man's family, or the man may become a member of the woman's family, according to the agreed wishes of the two parties.\"<ref name=\"engel\" />\n\nMore recently<!--vague. \"Over the past two decades\"?--> there has been a surge in Chinese\u2013foreigner marriages in mainland China\u2014more commonly involving Chinese women than Chinese men.

There is a derogatory term for women who are not married by the time they are in their late twenties, [[sheng nu]]. With these pressures to be married, some women who have very few prospects willingly enter into a second marriage. Sometimes, these second wives are promised a good life and home by these men. Oftentimes, these women are poor and uneducated so when they split, they have very little left. Sometimes these women were completely unaware that the man was already married.

According to Amnesty International, the law protects individual rights and bans the usage of coercion or detainment.<ref name=Amnesty/>\n\n==Property ownership==\n\nIn current-day China, women enjoy legal [[gender equality|equal rights]] to [[property]], but in practice, these rights are often difficult to realize. However, Chinese women have historically held little rights to private property, both by societal customs and by law. In imperial China (before 1911 C.E.), family households held property collectively, rather than as individual members of the household. This property customarily belonged to the family ancestral clan, with legal control belonging to the family head, or the eldest male.<ref name=\"birge\">Birge, Bettine. Women, Property, and Confucian Reaction in Sung and Yuan China (960-1368). Cambridge University Press, 2002.</ref>\n\nAncestry in imperial China was [[patrilinearity|patrilineal]], or passed through the male. Because women were not a part of this male-based ancestral line, they could never share the family property.<ref name=\"mccreery\">McCreery, John L. \"Women's property rights and dowry in China and South Asia.\" Ethnology (1976): 163-174.</ref> Upon the death of the head of the household, property was passed to the eldest son. In the absence of an eligible son, a family would often adopt a son to continue the family line and property.<ref name=\"bernhardt\">Bernhardt, Kathryn. Women and property in China, 960-1949. Stanford University Press, 1999.</ref>\n\nHowever, as Kathryn Bernhardt, a scholar of Chinese history points out, nearly one in three women during the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279 C.E.) would either have no brothers or no sons, leaving them with some agency over family property. In these cases, unmarried daughters would receive their fathers\u2019 property in the absence of direct male descendants, or an unmarried widow would choose the family heir.<ref name=bernhardt /> A new law enacted during the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368-1644 C.E.) required that in the absence of a direct male descendant, a man's property was to go to his nephews. With this change in law, women's access to private property was restricted. At that point, only if none of a man's sons and none of his brothers' sons were alive to inherit property would a daughter receive the inheritance.<ref name=mccreery />\n\nIn most cases, the most control over family property that a widow would receive was maintenance, or the agency to control the property while an heir came of age.<ref name=bernhardt /> In some cases after some reforms in the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644-1912), some women could retain maintenance over undivided property even after their sons came of age.<ref name=\"ocko\">Ocko, Jonathan K. \"Women, property, and law in the People's Republic of China.\" Marriage and inequality in Chinese society 12 (1991): 313.</ref> Law during the Republican era interpreted this to mean that widows held complete power over sons in control of the family property.<ref name=ocko />\n\nThe [[Chinese Nationalist Party|Kuomintang]], which assumed power over China in 1911, publicly advocated for gender equality, though not very many changes in property rights went into effect until the enactment of the [[Law of the Republic of China|Republican Civil Code]] in 1930, which changed the basic definitions of property and family inheritance.<ref name=bernhardt /><ref name=ocko /> The Code specified that family property legally belonged to the father, with no connection to the ancestral clan.<ref name=bernhardt />\n\nInheritance of this property was based on direct lineage, regardless of gender, so that sons and daughters would receive an equal share of family property upon the death of their parents. Furthermore, a man's will or appointment of a different heir could not fully bypass the legally mandated inheritance structures, preventing families from holding onto gender-discriminatory customs.<ref name=bernhardt /> Despite the law's equitable wording on the property, some scholars, such as Deborah Davis and Kathryn Bernhardt, point out that the legal definitions regarding property may not have entirely changed the practices of the general public.<ref name=bernhardt /><ref name=\"davis\">Davis, Deborah. \"Who gets the house? Renegotiating property rights in post-socialist urban China.\" Modern China 36, no. 5 (2010): 463-492.</ref>\n\nThe [[People's Republic of China]], which assumed control in 1949 and remains in power today, also promised gender equality. The PRC's approach was different from the Kuomintang. With regards to land, all land was owned by the central Chinese government and allocated for people to use, so technically no one, male or female, owned land. In 1978, the Chinese government set up a household farming system that split agricultural land into small plots for villages to allocate to citizens.<ref name=\"Hare\">Hare, Denise, Li Yang, and Daniel Englander. \"Land management in rural China and its gender implications.\" Feminist Economics 13, no. 3-4 (2007): 35-61.</ref>\n\nThe land was distributed to households with legal responsibility in the family head or the eldest male. So, a woman's access to land was contingent on her being part of a household. Land leases were technically supposed to transfer with marriage to a woman's marital family, but the perfect allocation of land leases was not always reached, meaning women could potentially lose land upon marriage. Such village allocations have since ceased, so the leases to the land are now passed through families.<ref name=\"chen\">Chen, Junjie, and Gale Summerfield. \"Gender and rural reforms in China: A case study of population control and land rights policies in northern Liaoning.\" Feminist Economics 13, no. 3-4 (2007): 63-92.</ref>\n\nFor property other than land, new Chinese laws allow for the distinction between personal and communal property. Married couples can simultaneously own some things individually while sharing others with their spouse and family. With regard to divorce, Chinese law generally demands a 50/50 split of property.

During the Han Dynasty, a marriage lacking a dowry or betrothal gift was seen as dishonorable. Only after gifts were exchanged would a marriage proceed; and the bride would be taken to live in the ancestral home of the new husband. Here, a wife was not only expected to live with the entirety of her husband's family, but to follow all of their rules and beliefs. Many families followed the Confucian teachings regarding honoring their elders. These rituals were passed down from father to son, official family lists were compiled, containing the names of all the sons and marital wives. So brides who did not produce a son were written out of family lists and forgotten. When a husband died, the bride was seen as the property of her spouse's family. Ransoms were set by some brides' families to get their daughters back, though never with her children, who remained in the property of her husband's family.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wiesner-Hanks|first1=Merry|title=Gender in history: global perspectives|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Malden, Mass|isbn=9781405189958|pages=29\u201330|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nJohn Engel, a professor of Family Resources at the [[University of Hawaii]], argues that the [[People's Republic of China]] established the [[New Marriage Law|Marriage Law of 1950]] to redistribute wealth and achieve a classless society.

This property customarily belonged to the family ancestral clan, with legal control belonging to the family head, or the eldest male.<ref name=\"birge\">Birge, Bettine. Women, Property, and Confucian Reaction in Sung and Yuan China (960-1368). Cambridge University Press, 2002.</ref>\n\nAncestry in imperial China was [[patrilinearity|patrilineal]], or passed through the male. Because women were not a part of this male-based ancestral line, they could never share the family property.<ref name=\"mccreery\">McCreery, John L. \"Women's property rights and dowry in China and South Asia.\" Ethnology (1976): 163-174.</ref> Upon the death of the head of the household, property was passed to the eldest son. In the absence of an eligible son, a family would often adopt a son to continue the family line and property.<ref name=\"bernhardt\">Bernhardt, Kathryn. Women and property in China, 960-1949. Stanford University Press, 1999.</ref>\n\nHowever, as Kathryn Bernhardt, a scholar of Chinese history points out, nearly one in three women during the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279 C.E.) would either have no brothers or no sons, leaving them with some agency over family property. In these cases, unmarried daughters would receive their fathers\u2019 property in the absence of direct male descendants, or an unmarried widow would choose the family heir.<ref name=bernhardt /> A new law enacted during the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368-1644 C.E.) required that in the absence of a direct male descendant, a man's property was to go to his nephews. With this change in law, women's access to private property was restricted. At that point, only if none of a man's sons and none of his brothers' sons were alive to inherit property would a daughter receive the inheritance.<ref name=mccreery />\n\nIn most cases, the most control over family property that a widow would receive was maintenance, or the agency to control the property while an heir came of age.<ref name=bernhardt /> In some cases after some reforms in the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644-1912), some women could retain maintenance over undivided property even after their sons came of age.<ref name=\"ocko\">Ocko, Jonathan K. \"Women, property, and law in the People's Republic of China.\" Marriage and inequality in Chinese society 12 (1991): 313.</ref> Law during the Republican era interpreted this to mean that widows held complete power over sons in control of the family property.<ref name=ocko />\n\nThe [[Chinese Nationalist Party|Kuomintang]], which assumed power over China in 1911, publicly advocated for gender equality, though not very many changes in property rights went into effect until the enactment of the [[Law of the Republic of China|Republican Civil Code]] in 1930, which changed the basic definitions of property and family inheritance.<ref name=bernhardt /><ref name=ocko /> The Code specified that family property legally belonged to the father, with no connection to the ancestral clan.<ref name=bernhardt />\n\nInheritance of this property was based on direct lineage, regardless of gender, so that sons and daughters would receive an equal share of family property upon the death of their parents. Furthermore, a man's will or appointment of a different heir could not fully bypass the legally mandated inheritance structures, preventing families from holding onto gender-discriminatory customs.<ref name=bernhardt /> Despite the law's equitable wording on the property, some scholars, such as Deborah Davis and Kathryn Bernhardt, point out that the legal definitions regarding property may not have entirely changed the practices of the general public.<ref name=bernhardt /><ref name=\"davis\">Davis, Deborah. \"Who gets the house? Renegotiating property rights in post-socialist urban China.\" Modern China 36, no. 5 (2010): 463-492.</ref>\n\nThe [[People's Republic of China]], which assumed control in 1949 and remains in power today, also promised gender equality. The PRC's approach was different from the Kuomintang. With regards to land, all land was owned by the central Chinese government and allocated for people to use, so technically no one, male or female, owned land. In 1978, the Chinese government set up a household farming system that split agricultural land into small plots for villages to allocate to citizens.<ref name=\"Hare\">Hare, Denise, Li Yang, and Daniel Englander. \"Land management in rural China and its gender implications.\" Feminist Economics 13, no. 3-4 (2007): 35-61.</ref>\n\nThe land was distributed to households with legal responsibility in the family head or the eldest male. So, a woman's access to land was contingent on her being part of a household. Land leases were technically supposed to transfer with marriage to a woman's marital family, but the perfect allocation of land leases was not always reached, meaning women could potentially lose land upon marriage. Such village allocations have since ceased, so the leases to the land are now passed through families.<ref name=\"chen\">Chen, Junjie, and Gale Summerfield. \"Gender and rural reforms in China: A case study of population control and land rights policies in northern Liaoning.\" Feminist Economics 13, no. 3-4 (2007): 63-92.</ref>\n\nFor property other than land, new Chinese laws allow for the distinction between personal and communal property. Married couples can simultaneously own some things individually while sharing others with their spouse and family. With regard to divorce, Chinese law generally demands a 50/50 split of property. The [[New Marriage Law|Marriage Law of 1980]] defined different types of divorce that would split the conjugal property differently, such as instances of adultery or domestic violence.<ref name=davis />\n\nSince most divorce disputes are settled at a local level, the law allows courts to review specific situations and make decisions in the best interest of the child. Typically, such a decision would simultaneously favor the mother, especially in disputes over a house where the child would live. In some divorce disputes \"ownership\" and \"use\" over property would be distinguished, giving a mother and child \"use\" of the family house without awarding the mother full ownership of the house.<ref name=davis />\n\n==Employment==\nIf female labor force participation is used as the indicator to measure gender equality, China would be one of the most egalitarian countries in the world: female labor force participation in China increased dramatically after the founding of the People's Republic and almost reached the universal level.<ref name=\"bridgew.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bridgew.edu/soas/jiws/vol1/li.htm |title=Women's Movement and Change of Women's Status in China |accessdate=2012-10-31 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515152129/http://www.bridgew.edu/soas/jiws/vol1/li.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2013 }}</ref> According to a study by Bauer et al., of women who married between 1950 and 1965, 70 percent had jobs, and women who married between 1966 and 1976, 92 percent had jobs.<ref name=\"Bauer\"/>\n\nEven though women in China are actively contributing to the paid labor force to an extent that exceeds numerous other countries, parity in the workforce has not been reached.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Knight|first=J|author2=L.
