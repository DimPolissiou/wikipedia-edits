The road is over {{convert|1|mile}} long with a mixture of residential, business and retail buildings - the stretch of Coldharbour Lane near [[Brixton Market]] contains shops, bars and restaurants. Between the junctions of Coldharbour Lane and [[Denmark Hill]] in [[Camberwell]] [[SE postcode area|SE5]] and Coldharbour Lane and Denmark Road lies part of the boundary between [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]] and [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]] boroughs. The other end of Coldharbour Lane meets [[Acre Lane]] in central Brixton to form the [[A2217 road|A2217]].\n\nThe [[Loughborough Junction]] area, surrounding the [[Loughborough Junction railway station|railway station]], marks the approximate centre point of Coldharbour Lane and the change in postcode from SE5 to [[SW postcode area|SW9]].\n\n==History==\nColdharbour Lane was formerly known as '''Camberwell Lane'''.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nFormer British Prime Minister [[John Major]] lived in a flat at 144 Coldharbour Lane when a child from 1955-59.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Major|title=John Major: The Autobiography|publisher=Harper Collins|year=1999|page=16-7}}</ref>\n\nThe lane close by Brixton Market became very derelict by the mid-1960s, when many drug houses flourished dealing mainly in cannabis.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1981 the [[1981 Brixton riot|Brixton riots]] occurred in roads near Coldharbour Lane and some windows were broken on the street itself.<ref>[http://www.urban75.org/brixton/history/riot.html \"Brixton Riots, 10-12th April 1981\"], an eye-witness accounts of the Brixton disorders in and around the Frontline, Atlantic Road, [[Railton Road]], Coldharbour Lane and Brixton Road, Brixton, Lambeth, London.<!-- Bot generated title --></ref> With the support of community leaders and shop owners, there are plans to set up a mini-police station on Coldharbour Lane in the former premises of a drug dealer.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/britain/article/0,,1468736,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Ghetto fabulous | date=2005-04-24 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>{{update after|2017|9|27}}\n\n=== Origins of the name ===\nA possible derivation of the name is Cool Arbour Lane, dating from the time Camberwell was in the country. This is cited in 'The Streets' by Anthony Quinn (2012) as the place the [[Nymphalis antiopa|Camberwell beauty]] was first sighted.\n\nA \"cold harbour\" was an uninhabited shelter for travellers, often along a well-known route, somewhat similar to a modern [[bothy]]. Unlike an inn, there were no staff, food or drink to be had. There would be a roof, door and possibly a simple hearth, although it was the traveller's responsibility to gather fuel. They were generally little more than open-faced barns or animal shelters.<ref name=\"Phrases, Coldharbour\" >{{cite web\n |title=Coldharbour \n |url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/43/messages/866.html\n |publisher=The Phrase Finder\n}}</ref>\n\nJ.

C. Hahn, Two articles on the origin of the name Coldharbour.]</ref>\n\nIn this, the author remarks upon relatively early equivalent place names in Germany and traces back the origins of Coldharbour/Cold Harbour to the Old High German Kalte Herberge. There is a village in [[Germany]] and another in [[Austria]] called Kaltherberg. This etymology was accepted by the authors of the dictionary [[Merriam-Webster]]. Our author concludes that \"our Cold Harbour was a name given to any cold abode, cold retreat, brought over to England by our Saxon ancestors\u2014Cold Harbour = Cold Station, Cold House, Cold Lodge.\" And thus has a wider meaning than that attributed by the supporters of a basic type of lodgings.\n\n\"Coldharbour\" also survives as the name of [[Coldharbour, Surrey|a village]] in [[Surrey]], and [[Bristol]] has both a \"Coldharbour Road\" and a \"Cold Harbour Lane\".\n\nColdharbour Lane also gives its name to [[Coldharbour (Lambeth ward)|Coldharbour ward]] in [[Brixton]] although approximately one third of Coldharbour Lane is located in [[Herne Hill ward]].\n\n== Crime == \nIn a 2003 London Evening Standard journalist David Cohen described Coldharbour Lane as the most dangerous street in the most dangerous borough in London. The headline asked whether the street is 'the most dangerous in Britain'. <ref>Evening Standard, 30/01/2003 Page: 16 Nearly 15,000 stabbings, robberies, muggings and even murders ... most linked to 300 yards where \u00a31m of crack cocaine is dealt each month.

Between the junctions of Coldharbour Lane and [[Denmark Hill]] in [[Camberwell]] [[SE postcode area|SE5]] and Coldharbour Lane and Denmark Road lies part of the boundary between [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]] and [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]] boroughs. The other end of Coldharbour Lane meets [[Acre Lane]] in central Brixton to form the [[A2217 road|A2217]].\n\nThe [[Loughborough Junction]] area, surrounding the [[Loughborough Junction railway station|railway station]], marks the approximate centre point of Coldharbour Lane and the change in postcode from SE5 to [[SW postcode area|SW9]].\n\n==History==\nColdharbour Lane was formerly known as '''Camberwell Lane'''.\n\nFormer British Prime Minister [[John Major]] lived in a flat at 144 Coldharbour Lane when a child from 1955-59.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Major|title=John Major: The Autobiography|publisher=Harper Collins|year=1999|page=16-7}}</ref>\n\nThe lane close by Brixton Market became very derelict by the mid-1960s, when many drug houses flourished dealing mainly in cannabis.\n\nIn 1981 the [[1981 Brixton riot|Brixton riots]] occurred in roads near Coldharbour Lane and some windows were broken on the street itself.<ref>[http://www.urban75.org/brixton/history/riot.html \"Brixton Riots, 10-12th April 1981\"], an eye-witness accounts of the Brixton disorders in and around the Frontline, Atlantic Road, [[Railton Road]], Coldharbour Lane and Brixton Road, Brixton, Lambeth, London.<!-- Bot generated title --></ref> With the support of community leaders and shop owners, there are plans to set up a mini-police station on Coldharbour Lane in the former premises of a drug dealer.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/britain/article/0,,1468736,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Ghetto fabulous | date=2005-04-24 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>{{update after|2017|9|27}}\n\n=== Origins of the name ===\nA possible derivation of the name is Cool Arbour Lane, dating from the time Camberwell was in the country. This is cited in 'The Streets' by Anthony Quinn (2012) as the place the [[Nymphalis antiopa|Camberwell beauty]] was first sighted.\n\nA \"cold harbour\" was an uninhabited shelter for travellers, often along a well-known route, somewhat similar to a modern [[bothy]]. Unlike an inn, there were no staff, food or drink to be had. There would be a roof, door and possibly a simple hearth, although it was the traveller's responsibility to gather fuel. They were generally little more than open-faced barns or animal shelters.<ref name=\"Phrases, Coldharbour\" >{{cite web\n |title=Coldharbour \n |url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/43/messages/866.html\n |publisher=The Phrase Finder\n}}</ref>\n\nJ.

There is a village in [[Germany]] and another in [[Austria]] called Kaltherberg. This etymology was accepted by the authors of the dictionary [[Merriam-Webster]]. Our author concludes that \"our Cold Harbour was a name given to any cold abode, cold retreat, brought over to England by our Saxon ancestors\u2014Cold Harbour = Cold Station, Cold House, Cold Lodge.\" And thus has a wider meaning than that attributed by the supporters of a basic type of lodgings.\n\n\"Coldharbour\" also survives as the name of [[Coldharbour, Surrey|a village]] in [[Surrey]], and [[Bristol]] has both a \"Coldharbour Road\" and a \"Cold Harbour Lane\".\n\nColdharbour Lane also gives its name to [[Coldharbour (Lambeth ward)|Coldharbour ward]] in [[Brixton]] although approximately one third of Coldharbour Lane is located in [[Herne Hill ward]].\n\n== Crime == \nIn a 2003 London Evening Standard journalist David Cohen described Coldharbour Lane as the most dangerous street in the most dangerous borough in London.

A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

During the late 1900s and early 2000s, historian [[Silvio Bedini]] wrote and performed research about Banneker that refuted some of these tales while working in Washington, D.C. for over 40 years at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History|Museum of History and Technology/National Museum of American History]].<ref name=Founders>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_5ZDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Locating the Federal District: Editorial Note: Footnote number 119|work=The Papers of Thomas Jefferson: 24 January\u201331 March 1791|volume=19|editor-first=Julian P.|editor-last=Boyd|editor-link=Julian P.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1972.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ... By this act the brain of the Afro-American is indissolubly linked with the Capital and nation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Daniel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7bYqADpiU4C&pg=PA12#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=A Paper Read Before the Banneker of Association of Washington}} ''In'' {{cite book |title=Banneker: The Afro-American Astronomer|last=Allen|first=Will W.|year=1921|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=10344679|lccn=21017456}} Reprinted in {{cite book|first1=Will W.|last1=Allen|first2=Daniel|last2=Murray|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7bYqADpiU4C|title=Banneker: The Afro-American Astronomer|pages=12\u201315|publisher=Black Classic Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland|year=2005|oclc=808618979|isbn=0933121-48-2|via=[[Google Books]]|accessdate=2017-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215012211/https://books.google.com/books?id=K7bYqADpiU4C&pg=PA12|archive-date=December 15, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1976 (more than 50 years later), Jerome Klinkowitz stated within a book that described the works of Banneker and other early black American writers that Murray's report had initiated a myth about Banneker's career.

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970 |first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi |url-access=registration |title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital |work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395 |oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19 |quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

He was a farmer, a mathematician, an inventor, an astronomer, a writer, a surveyor, a scientist, and a humanitarian. When he surveyed the city of Washington with Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant, Banneker became one of the first black civil servants of the new nation. Along with a team, Banneker identified the boundaries of the capitol city. They installed intermittent stone markers along the perimeter of the District. .... In 1753, Banneker constructed one of the first entirely wooden clocks in America. .... Banneker's scientific research led him to write one of the first series of almanacs printed in the United States.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321194817/https://www.nps.gov/places/sw-9-intermediate-boundary-stone-of-the-district-of-columbia.htm/index.htm|archive-date=March 21, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHowever, historical research has shown that none of these legends can be correct.<ref name=Founders/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\">[https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up Bedini, 1999, p. 132-136.] \"An exhaustive search of government repositories, including the Public Buildings and Grounds files in the National Archives, and various collections in the Library of Congress, failed to turn up Banneker's name on any of the contemporary documents or records related to the selection, planning and survey of the City of Washington. Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House. Jefferson during this period was in Philadelphia, the national capital in Washington had yet not been built, and there was no White House.\"</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969], pp. 7, 29.</ref> As Bedini reported in 1969, Ellicott's 1791 assignment was to produce a survey of a square, the length of whose sides would each be {{convert|10|mi|km|1}} (a \"ten mile square\").<ref name=Bedini22/> L'Enfant was to survey, design and lay out the national capital city within this square.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q=Banneker&f=false Stewart, p. 50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426112936/https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50 |date=April 26, 2016}}</ref> Ellicott and L'Enfant each worked independently under the supervision of the three Commissioners that President Washington had earlier appointed.<ref name=Bedini22/> Bedini could not find any evidence that showed that Banneker had ever worked with or for L'Enfant.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/>\n\nBanneker left the federal capital area and returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills in April 1791.<ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/><ref name=Arnebeck>{{cite web|last=Arnebeck|first=Bob|url=http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129062551/http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archivedate=2018-01-29|title=Washington Examined: Seat of Empire: the General and the Plan 1790 to 1801|date=2017-01-02|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|accessdate=2018-01-29|quote=Meanwhile Andrew Ellicott, the nation's Surveyor General, finished surveying the boundary lines of the federal district, and joined L'Enfant in laying out the city.

A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

During the late 1900s and early 2000s, historian [[Silvio Bedini]] wrote and performed research about Banneker that refuted some of these tales while working in Washington, D.C. for over 40 years at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History|Museum of History and Technology/National Museum of American History]].<ref name=Founders>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_5ZDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Locating the Federal District: Editorial Note: Footnote number 119|work=The Papers of Thomas Jefferson: 24 January\u201331 March 1791|volume=19|editor-first=Julian P.|editor-last=Boyd|editor-link=Julian P.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1972.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ... By this act the brain of the Afro-American is indissolubly linked with the Capital and nation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Daniel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7bYqADpiU4C&pg=PA12#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=A Paper Read Before the Banneker of Association of Washington}} ''In'' {{cite book |title=Banneker: The Afro-American Astronomer|last=Allen|first=Will W.|year=1921|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=10344679|lccn=21017456}} Reprinted in {{cite book|first1=Will W.|last1=Allen|first2=Daniel|last2=Murray|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7bYqADpiU4C|title=Banneker: The Afro-American Astronomer|pages=12\u201315|publisher=Black Classic Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland|year=2005|oclc=808618979|isbn=0933121-48-2|via=[[Google Books]]|accessdate=2017-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215012211/https://books.google.com/books?id=K7bYqADpiU4C&pg=PA12|archive-date=December 15, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1976 (more than 50 years later), Jerome Klinkowitz stated within a book that described the works of Banneker and other early black American writers that Murray's report had initiated a myth about Banneker's career.

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970 |first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi |url-access=registration |title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital |work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395 |oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19 |quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

He was a farmer, a mathematician, an inventor, an astronomer, a writer, a surveyor, a scientist, and a humanitarian. When he surveyed the city of Washington with Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant, Banneker became one of the first black civil servants of the new nation. Along with a team, Banneker identified the boundaries of the capitol city. They installed intermittent stone markers along the perimeter of the District. .... In 1753, Banneker constructed one of the first entirely wooden clocks in America. .... Banneker's scientific research led him to write one of the first series of almanacs printed in the United States.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321194817/https://www.nps.gov/places/sw-9-intermediate-boundary-stone-of-the-district-of-columbia.htm/index.htm|archive-date=March 21, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHowever, historical research has shown that none of these legends can be correct.<ref name=Founders/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\">[https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up Bedini, 1999, p. 132-136.] \"An exhaustive search of government repositories, including the Public Buildings and Grounds files in the National Archives, and various collections in the Library of Congress, failed to turn up Banneker's name on any of the contemporary documents or records related to the selection, planning and survey of the City of Washington. Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House. Jefferson during this period was in Philadelphia, the national capital in Washington had yet not been built, and there was no White House.\"</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969], pp. 7, 29.</ref> As Bedini reported in 1969, Ellicott's 1791 assignment was to produce a survey of a square, the length of whose sides would each be {{convert|10|mi|km|1}} (a \"ten mile square\").<ref name=Bedini22/> L'Enfant was to survey, design and lay out the national capital city within this square.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q=Banneker&f=false Stewart, p. 50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426112936/https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50 |date=April 26, 2016}}</ref> Ellicott and L'Enfant each worked independently under the supervision of the three Commissioners that President Washington had earlier appointed.<ref name=Bedini22/> Bedini could not find any evidence that showed that Banneker had ever worked with or for L'Enfant.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/>\n\nBanneker left the federal capital area and returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills in April 1791.<ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/><ref name=Arnebeck>{{cite web|last=Arnebeck|first=Bob|url=http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129062551/http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archivedate=2018-01-29|title=Washington Examined: Seat of Empire: the General and the Plan 1790 to 1801|date=2017-01-02|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|accessdate=2018-01-29|quote=Meanwhile Andrew Ellicott, the nation's Surveyor General, finished surveying the boundary lines of the federal district, and joined L'Enfant in laying out the city.

In 1972 and 1999, Bedini wrote that Banneker had constructed his clock from his recollections of that watch ([https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/42/mode/1up Bedini, 1972, p. 42.] and [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/42/mode/2up Bedini, 1999, pp. 42\u201443.]).

In 2008, when again describing Banneker's clock, Bedini more cautiously wrote: \"It is said that it was based on his recollections of the mechanism of a pocket watch.\" ([http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx|date=2016-02-03}}).</ref>\n\nFurther, it is open to question as to whether the clock was actually \"remarkable\".

However, the aircraft is primarily used for [[close air support]].\n\n==Design and development==\nThe PRC was an enthusiastic user of the [[MiG-19]], which it manufactured locally as the [[Shenyang J-6]] from 1958. In August 1958 the [[People's Liberation Army]] requested development of a jet [[attack aircraft]] for the air support role.\n\n[[Lu Xiaopeng]] was appointed chief designer of this project. Lu also designed the [[Nanchang J-12|J-12]] fighter jet.<ref name=\"AirForceWorld.com_Q5_attack_aircraft_Lu_Xiaopeng\">{{cite web |url=http://airforceworld.com/pla/q-5e-q-5f-striker-china-2.htm#q5e |title=Q5 attack aircraft chief designer Lu Xiaopeng |work=AirForceWorld.com |accessdate=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818153232/http://www.airforceworld.com/pla/q-5e-q-5f-striker-china-2.htm#q5e |archivedate=18 August 2011 }}</ref> Although based on the MiG-19, the new design, designated '''Qiangjiji-5''' (fifth attack aircraft design), had a longer fuselage, [[area rule]]d to reduce [[transonic]] drag and accommodate a 4&nbsp;m (13-ft) long internal weapons bay.<ref name=\"AirForceWorld.com_Q5_attack_aircraft_weapon_bay\">{{cite web |url=http://airforceworld.com/pla/q-5-a-5-striker-bomb-bay-china.htm |title=Q5_attack_aircraft_weapon_bay |work=AirForceWorld.com |accessdate=2 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303214406/http://www.airforceworld.com/pla/q-5-a-5-striker-bomb-bay-china.htm |archivedate=3 March 2011 }}</ref> The air intakes were moved to the fuselage sides to make space in the nose for a planned target [[radar]] (which was never actually fitted). New wings with greater area and reduced [[swept wing|sweep]] were incorporated. The Q-5 shares the J-6's Liming Wopen [[Tumansky RD-9|WP-6]] A ([[Tumansky RD-9]]) [[turbojet]] engines. The redesign cost some high-altitude speed, but the Q-5 is as fast as the MiG-19/J-6 at low level, thanks largely to the area-ruled fuselage.\n[[File:Q-5 in Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution 20170919.jpg|thumb|Q-5 in Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution.]]\nFixed armament of the Q-5 was reduced to two [[Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23|Type 23-1]] 23&nbsp;mm cannon with 100 rounds per gun, mounted in the wing roots. Two pylons under each wing and two pairs of tandem pylons under the engines were provided in addition to the weapons bay. A total of 1,000&nbsp;kg (2,205&nbsp;lb) of ordnance could be carried internally, with an additional 1,000&nbsp;kg externally. On many aircraft the weapons bay is now used primarily for an auxiliary fuel tank.\n\nProduction drawings were completed in 1960 allowing construction of prototypes to begin, but the political climate in China resulted in the project being canceled in 1961. A small team kept the program alive until it work restarted in earnest at Nanchang.<ref name=\"Chia p147\">Gordon and Kommisarov 2008, p. 147.</ref> The first flight finally occurred on 10 June 1965. Series production began in 1969, with squadron delivery starting in 1970.\n\nAbout 1,000 aircraft were produced, 600 of them being the updated Q-5A. A small number, perhaps a few dozen, Q-5As were modified to carry [[nuclear weapon]]s; these are believed to retain their internal weapons bay. A long-range '''Q-5I''', introduced in 1983, added a fuel tank instead of the internal weapons bay, compensating for that with the provision of two additional underwing pylons. Some of these aircraft serve with the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] Navy, and have apparently been equipped with [[radar]] to guide [[anti-ship missile]]s. Subsequent minor upgrades include the Q-5IA, with a new gun/bomb sighting system and [[avionics]], and the Q-5II, with radar warning receiver (RWR).\n\nIn the 1980s, the aircraft was exported to nations such as [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Myanmar]], and is often known as the A-5 in those nations.\n\nPlans for an upgraded Q-5/A-5 with Western equipment and new navigation and attack (nav/attack) systems were largely aborted following the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], but the aircraft continues in service. It is a capable light attack aircraft, although its limited navigation and weapons-delivery systems are inferior to more modern aircraft.\n\nIn more recent years, the [[PLAAF]] has begun to field newer models of the Q-5, that incorporate some of the technology developed during the canceled Q-5M and Q-5K projects. The Q-5 introduces a nose-mounted [[laser rangefinder]], and a laser designator is also likely to be fitted since the aircraft is said to be able to deliver laser-guided bombs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sinodefence.com/airforce/groundattack/q5.asp |title=Qiang-5 (Q-5, A-5, Fantan) Ground Attack Aircraft |publisher=SinoDefence.com |accessdate=2013-11-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116100259/http://www.sinodefence.com/airforce/groundattack/q5.asp |archivedate=2010-01-16 }}</ref> The Q-5A variant is believed to be capable of delivering nuclear munitions.

One of such aircraft is currently on display at the aviation museum in [[Beijing]].\n*'''Q-5Yi:''' Torpedo attacker for navy, only few manufactured. YJ-8 anti-ship missile was also being considered, but the program was cancelled due to budget problem even though the missile was well developed, and afterwards missile test launches were conducted from Type 24 missile boat. In eighties, YJ-81 was once mounted for test, but this proposition was soon rejected when it was decided to let JH-7 take the role.\n*'''Q-5I(Q-5A):''' Q-5 with the internal weapon bay replaced by internal fuel tank, increasing fuel capacity over 70%. Like all previous Q-5 variants, navigation was still a bottle neck with the result being that aircraft must fly longer times in more complex search patterns in long range strikes. However, this problem is somewhat reduced by the increased fuel capacity. An indigenous Type 79Y4 [[laser rangefinder]] developed by No. 613 Institute was fitted.\n*'''Q-5IA(Q-5B):''' Improved Q-5I, [[radar warning receiver]] and flare dispensers added, the original weapon aiming sight of the Q-5 was developed by No. 5311 Factory, and named as SH-1, short for ''S''he \u2013 ''H''ong (Shoot-Bomb-1 / \u5c04\u8f70-1), which only had limited capability because attacks could only be carried out at a fixed angle. No. 5311 Factory developed an improved version SH-1I (\u5c04\u8f70-1\u7532) to allow the attack to be carried out at different angles. Extra outer pylon under each wing added for PL-2/PL-5 air-to-air missiles, bombs or rocket launchers.\n*'''Q-5II(Q-5C):''' Q-5I with omnidirectional [[radar warning receiver]]s. Later, Type 205 pulse doppler navigation radar was installed on several planes to solve the navigation problem.\n*'''Q-5III:''' Foreign trade variant, export name A-5III/A-5C\uff0c Project Long6(Dragon Six). Total 10 pylons, with 1 extra pylon under each wing for R-550/AIM-9 air-to-air missiles. See also Export variants.\n*'''Q-5 with indigenous nav/attack system:''' Project CC, Q-5I with indigenous Type 205 doppler navigation system, Q5HK-15 [[laser rangefinder]] and SH-1IIA sight. One year later, head-up display and air data computer were incorporated into system. The whole system finally got approved in 1992, and relevant technology was applied to Q-5D several years later.\n*'''Q-5IV(Q-5M, Q-5D(old)):''' Project CI. Joint Chinese-[[Italy|Italian]] project to upgrade the Q-5II with Italian avionics from the [[AMX International AMX]] attack fighter. Avionics would include a ranging radar, [[head-up display]], [[inertial navigation system]], [[air data computer]] and dual central computers all integrated via dual-redundant [[MIL-STD-1553]]B databus.

Two central computers like that of Q-5M and new RW-30 [[radar warning receiver]]s were added. ALR-1 [[laser rangefinder]] and QHK-10 [[Head-Up Display]] developed by No. 613 Institute were added. Although the project was influenced after the [[Tiananmen Square protest of 1989]], it was approved to continue by China and Italy in 1992, new upgrade items such as IFIR and ELINT, etc., were put into program. Due to the loss of time, it failed to enter production. See also Export variants.\n*'''Q-5D(C):''' Composite material demonstrator for Q-5D(old).\n*'''Q-5IIGai(Q-5K, Q-5E(old)):''' Project CF, joint Chinese-French project to upgrade Q-5II with French avionics, such as VE110 [[head-Up Display]], ULIS91 [[inertial navigation system]], TMV630 [[laser rangefinder]] and other electro-optics.  Like the Q-5M/A-5M, the project was cancelled after the Tiananmen Square protest of 1989. So some indigenous equipment such as doppler radar, jammer etc., were used to achieve further progress. It was terminated in 1993.\n*'''Q-5D:''' Interim attack aircraft introduced during the [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis|1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis]], the separate doppler navigation system and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] of the Q-5C was replaced by the DG-1 integrated doppler navigation/GPS system. Other systems included the ALR-1 Laser rangefinder/Marked Target seeker and QHK-10 [[Head-Up Display]]. A new weapon aiming sight, the SH-1II (\u5c04\u8f70-1\u4e59), replaced the older SH-1I (\u5c04\u8f70-1\u7532), and No. 5311 Factory managed to successfully integrate this sight with the new [[laser rangefinder]] and Type 205 navigation radar.\n*'''Q-5E:''' New pylon with ability to mount laser-guided bombs such as LS-500J LGB, fire control system also improved. Laser pod is absent from the plane due to weight issue.\n*'''Q-5F:''' Laser designator pod carrier, special large belly right pylon mounted for laser targeting pod, which is always false recognized as semi-buried electro-optical targeting pod.\n*'''Q-5G:''' Q-5E with belly conformal fuel tank to solve the range problem.\n*'''JQ-5J:''' Tandem two seater of Q-5. The manufacturer claimed that it can be used as [[forward air control]] like the [[A-10 Thunderbolt II#Variants|OA-10A]], and providing targeting information via [[data link]]s. The rear seat is 286 millimetres higher than the front seat, enables the back-seat pilot to have a 5 degree field of vision, and the canopy opens to the right. When used as a trainer, the rear [[cockpit (aviation)|cockpit]] control can override that of the front cockpit.\n*'''Q-5L''' \u2013 Upgraded Q-5C, with LLLTV/FLIR vision systems for a day/night capability. Infrared imaging and television cameras were mounted on nose orb. Other improvements include Head Up Display, GPS Rx, INS, TACAN, and chaff/flare dispensers. Weapons capability include the Chinese LS-500J laser-guided glide bombs with a 12&nbsp;km range. Optional belly conformal fuel tank.\n*'''Q-5N''' \u2013 Upgraded Q-5D with same upgrade program as Q-5L, main difference is navigation system of Q-5D.\n\n===Export variants===\n*'''A-5:''' Export designation for version of the Q-5 to [[North Korea]] in 70's that appeared in Chinese media.  The designation contains more than one variant since the Chinese military aid to North Korea is protracted, but it's not clear whether this export version is derived from Q-5, Q-5A, Q-5I or Q-5IA.\n*'''A-5IIA:''' Modified version of Q-5II, sold to [[Sudan]].\n*'''A-5IIK:''' Export version of Q-5II sold to [[Myanmar]].\n*'''A-5III/A-5C:''' Export version with western equipment upon customers' requests, such as flight instrumentation made by [[Rockwell Collins]], and western [[ejection seat]] made by [[Martin-Baker]]. Added the capability to fire western missiles such as the [[R550 Magic]] or [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]].  Exported to [[Pakistan]].\n*'''A-5IIIA:''' Exported to [[Bangladesh]]. Bangladesh Air Force's A-5Cs have been upgraded in 2008 to fire LS-6 and LT-2 ground attack munitions giving them advanced strike capability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bdmilitary.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=249&Itemid=106|title=Bangladesh Air Force Nanchang A-5C \"Fantan\" Fighter-Bombers|publisher=bdmilitary|accessdate=2009-03-08}}</ref>\n*'''A-5IV/A-5M:''' Export version of Q-5M with more western equipment such as flight instrumentation made by [[Rockwell Collins]], and western ejection seat made by [[Martin-Baker]].

However, the aircraft is primarily used for [[close air support]].\n\n==Design and development==\nThe PRC was an enthusiastic user of the [[MiG-19]], which it manufactured locally as the [[Shenyang J-6]] from 1958. In August 1958 the [[People's Liberation Army]] requested development of a jet [[attack aircraft]] for the air support role.\n\n[[Lu Xiaopeng]] was appointed chief designer of this project.

The redesign cost some high-altitude speed, but the Q-5 is as fast as the MiG-19/J-6 at low level, thanks largely to the area-ruled fuselage.\n[[File:Q-5 in Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution 20170919.jpg|thumb|Q-5 in Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution.]]\nFixed armament of the Q-5 was reduced to two [[Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23|Type 23-1]] 23&nbsp;mm cannon with 100 rounds per gun, mounted in the wing roots.

On many aircraft the weapons bay is now used primarily for an auxiliary fuel tank.\n\nProduction drawings were completed in 1960 allowing construction of prototypes to begin, but the political climate in China resulted in the project being canceled in 1961.

Series production began in 1969, with squadron delivery starting in 1970.\n\nAbout 1,000 aircraft were produced, 600 of them being the updated Q-5A. A small number, perhaps a few dozen, Q-5As were modified to carry [[nuclear weapon]]s; these are believed to retain their internal weapons bay. A long-range '''Q-5I''', introduced in 1983, added a fuel tank instead of the internal weapons bay, compensating for that with the provision of two additional underwing pylons. Some of these aircraft serve with the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] Navy, and have apparently been equipped with [[radar]] to guide [[anti-ship missile]]s. Subsequent minor upgrades include the Q-5IA, with a new gun/bomb sighting system and [[avionics]], and the Q-5II, with radar warning receiver (RWR).\n\nIn the 1980s, the aircraft was exported to nations such as [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Myanmar]], and is often known as the A-5 in those nations.\n\nPlans for an upgraded Q-5/A-5 with Western equipment and new navigation and attack (nav/attack) systems were largely aborted following the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], but the aircraft continues in service. It is a capable light attack aircraft, although its limited navigation and weapons-delivery systems are inferior to more modern aircraft.\n\nIn more recent years, the [[PLAAF]] has begun to field newer models of the Q-5, that incorporate some of the technology developed during the canceled Q-5M and Q-5K projects. The Q-5 introduces a nose-mounted [[laser rangefinder]], and a laser designator is also likely to be fitted since the aircraft is said to be able to deliver laser-guided bombs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sinodefence.com/airforce/groundattack/q5.asp |title=Qiang-5 (Q-5, A-5, Fantan) Ground Attack Aircraft |publisher=SinoDefence.com |accessdate=2013-11-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116100259/http://www.sinodefence.com/airforce/groundattack/q5.asp |archivedate=2010-01-16 }}</ref> The Q-5A variant is believed to be capable of delivering nuclear munitions. The Q-5D is an upgrade with new avionics, including a HUD and a new navigation system. The Q-5E and Q-5F models are reportedly being worked on, though little is known about them at this time. One of them could potentially be the new two-seater that has been seen in a few photographs, although the two-seater could bear the designation Q-5J.\n\n==Operational history==\nThe Sudanese Air Force employed its A-5 attack jets during the [[War in Darfur]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7503428.stm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-03-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305011237/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7503428.stm |archive-date=2016-03-05 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn March 2015, some [[Myanmar Air Force]] A-5C jets flying sorties against the [[Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army]], accidentally dropped bombs on a Chinese village in [[Gengma County]], [[Yunnan]] inside the Chinese border, killing 4 villagers, with the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] responding by deploying [[KS-1 (missile)|HQ-12]] surface-to-air missiles and fighter jets.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Feinberg|first1=William|title=China summons Burmese ambassador after bomb kills four in Yunnan|url=http://www.eastbysoutheast.com/china-summons-burmese-ambassador-after-bomb-kills-four-in-yunnan/|website=East by Southeast|accessdate=16 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402135717/http://www.eastbysoutheast.com/china-summons-burmese-ambassador-after-bomb-kills-four-in-yunnan/|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn 20 April 2017 two Q-5s were seen in [[Bohai Bay]] practicing air strikes against ground targets in the wake of increased tensions on the Korean peninsula.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2017/04/20/China-deploys-fighter-jets-in-drills-near-North-Korea/5421492712640/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-04-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420224915/http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2017/04/20/China-deploys-fighter-jets-in-drills-near-North-Korea/5421492712640/ |archive-date=2017-04-20 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n\n===Domestic variants===\n[[File:Q5 parked.png|thumb|Q-5]]\n[[File:3 Nanchang Q-5s on Minsk flight deck.JPG|thumb|Old Q-5s on the deck of the [[Soviet aircraft carrier Minsk|''Minsk'']], at the Minsk World Theme Park]]\n[[File:Nanchang Q-5.jpg|thumb|Old Q-5 numbered #0064]]\n[[File:Fantan.png|thumb|View of Nanchang Q-5]]\n\n*'''Q-5:''' Original production version with a total of 6 pylons, two under each wing and two under the [[fuselage]], and was superseded by the Q-5A.\n*'''Q-5Jia:''' Q-5 modified to carry nuclear bombs, only a very limited number were built. 317Jia radar was tested as improvement program. One of such aircraft is currently on display at the aviation museum in [[Beijing]].\n*'''Q-5Yi:''' Torpedo attacker for navy, only few manufactured. YJ-8 anti-ship missile was also being considered, but the program was cancelled due to budget problem even though the missile was well developed, and afterwards missile test launches were conducted from Type 24 missile boat. In eighties, YJ-81 was once mounted for test, but this proposition was soon rejected when it was decided to let JH-7 take the role.\n*'''Q-5I(Q-5A):''' Q-5 with the internal weapon bay replaced by internal fuel tank, increasing fuel capacity over 70%. Like all previous Q-5 variants, navigation was still a bottle neck with the result being that aircraft must fly longer times in more complex search patterns in long range strikes. However, this problem is somewhat reduced by the increased fuel capacity. An indigenous Type 79Y4 [[laser rangefinder]] developed by No. 613 Institute was fitted.\n*'''Q-5IA(Q-5B):''' Improved Q-5I, [[radar warning receiver]] and flare dispensers added, the original weapon aiming sight of the Q-5 was developed by No. 5311 Factory, and named as SH-1, short for ''S''he \u2013 ''H''ong (Shoot-Bomb-1 / \u5c04\u8f70-1), which only had limited capability because attacks could only be carried out at a fixed angle. No. 5311 Factory developed an improved version SH-1I (\u5c04\u8f70-1\u7532) to allow the attack to be carried out at different angles. Extra outer pylon under each wing added for PL-2/PL-5 air-to-air missiles, bombs or rocket launchers.\n*'''Q-5II(Q-5C):''' Q-5I with omnidirectional [[radar warning receiver]]s. Later, Type 205 pulse doppler navigation radar was installed on several planes to solve the navigation problem.\n*'''Q-5III:''' Foreign trade variant, export name A-5III/A-5C\uff0c Project Long6(Dragon Six). Total 10 pylons, with 1 extra pylon under each wing for R-550/AIM-9 air-to-air missiles. See also Export variants.\n*'''Q-5 with indigenous nav/attack system:''' Project CC, Q-5I with indigenous Type 205 doppler navigation system, Q5HK-15 [[laser rangefinder]] and SH-1IIA sight. One year later, head-up display and air data computer were incorporated into system. The whole system finally got approved in 1992, and relevant technology was applied to Q-5D several years later.\n*'''Q-5IV(Q-5M, Q-5D(old)):''' Project CI. Joint Chinese-[[Italy|Italian]] project to upgrade the Q-5II with Italian avionics from the [[AMX International AMX]] attack fighter. Avionics would include a ranging radar, [[head-up display]], [[inertial navigation system]], [[air data computer]] and dual central computers all integrated via dual-redundant [[MIL-STD-1553]]B databus.

Two central computers like that of Q-5M and new RW-30 [[radar warning receiver]]s were added. ALR-1 [[laser rangefinder]] and QHK-10 [[Head-Up Display]] developed by No. 613 Institute were added. Although the project was influenced after the [[Tiananmen Square protest of 1989]], it was approved to continue by China and Italy in 1992, new upgrade items such as IFIR and ELINT, etc., were put into program. Due to the loss of time, it failed to enter production. See also Export variants.\n*'''Q-5D(C):''' Composite material demonstrator for Q-5D(old).\n*'''Q-5IIGai(Q-5K, Q-5E(old)):''' Project CF, joint Chinese-French project to upgrade Q-5II with French avionics, such as VE110 [[head-Up Display]], ULIS91 [[inertial navigation system]], TMV630 [[laser rangefinder]] and other electro-optics.  Like the Q-5M/A-5M, the project was cancelled after the Tiananmen Square protest of 1989. So some indigenous equipment such as doppler radar, jammer etc., were used to achieve further progress. It was terminated in 1993.\n*'''Q-5D:''' Interim attack aircraft introduced during the [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis|1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis]], the separate doppler navigation system and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] of the Q-5C was replaced by the DG-1 integrated doppler navigation/GPS system. Other systems included the ALR-1 Laser rangefinder/Marked Target seeker and QHK-10 [[Head-Up Display]]. A new weapon aiming sight, the SH-1II (\u5c04\u8f70-1\u4e59), replaced the older SH-1I (\u5c04\u8f70-1\u7532), and No. 5311 Factory managed to successfully integrate this sight with the new [[laser rangefinder]] and Type 205 navigation radar.\n*'''Q-5E:''' New pylon with ability to mount laser-guided bombs such as LS-500J LGB, fire control system also improved. Laser pod is absent from the plane due to weight issue.\n*'''Q-5F:''' Laser designator pod carrier, special large belly right pylon mounted for laser targeting pod, which is always false recognized as semi-buried electro-optical targeting pod.\n*'''Q-5G:''' Q-5E with belly conformal fuel tank to solve the range problem.\n*'''JQ-5J:''' Tandem two seater of Q-5. The manufacturer claimed that it can be used as [[forward air control]] like the [[A-10 Thunderbolt II#Variants|OA-10A]], and providing targeting information via [[data link]]s. The rear seat is 286 millimetres higher than the front seat, enables the back-seat pilot to have a 5 degree field of vision, and the canopy opens to the right. When used as a trainer, the rear [[cockpit (aviation)|cockpit]] control can override that of the front cockpit.\n*'''Q-5L''' \u2013 Upgraded Q-5C, with LLLTV/FLIR vision systems for a day/night capability. Infrared imaging and television cameras were mounted on nose orb. Other improvements include Head Up Display, GPS Rx, INS, TACAN, and chaff/flare dispensers. Weapons capability include the Chinese LS-500J laser-guided glide bombs with a 12&nbsp;km range. Optional belly conformal fuel tank.\n*'''Q-5N''' \u2013 Upgraded Q-5D with same upgrade program as Q-5L, main difference is navigation system of Q-5D.\n\n===Export variants===\n*'''A-5:''' Export designation for version of the Q-5 to [[North Korea]] in 70's that appeared in Chinese media.  The designation contains more than one variant since the Chinese military aid to North Korea is protracted, but it's not clear whether this export version is derived from Q-5, Q-5A, Q-5I or Q-5IA.\n*'''A-5IIA:''' Modified version of Q-5II, sold to [[Sudan]].\n*'''A-5IIK:''' Export version of Q-5II sold to [[Myanmar]].\n*'''A-5III/A-5C:''' Export version with western equipment upon customers' requests, such as flight instrumentation made by [[Rockwell Collins]], and western [[ejection seat]] made by [[Martin-Baker]]. Added the capability to fire western missiles such as the [[R550 Magic]] or [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]].  Exported to [[Pakistan]].\n*'''A-5IIIA:''' Exported to [[Bangladesh]].

Slayers''' were a [[rugby league]] football team based in [[Washington, D.C.]] who last played in the [[USA Rugby League]]. They played their home games at Duke Ellington Field near Georgetown Hospital.\n\nThe Slayers, along with the [[Connecticut Wildcats]], were established in 2003 as [[expansion team]]s of the [[American National Rugby League]] (AMNRL). They played in the AMNRL for eight seasons, from 2003\u20132010, making it to the league playoffs six times and advancing to the semi-finals in their inaugural season. In 2011 they became one of seven teams to depart from the AMNRL to form the new USA Rugby League.\n\n==History==\nThe team was founded in 2003 by B.J. Chetham who sponsored the team's early foundation after learning that Rugby League was being played in Pennsylvania. Going to visit Pennsylvania to watch the New Zealand Kiwis play the US National Team the Tomahawks,B.J. through David Niu, President of the American National Rugby League, helped find keen players to organise a club in Washington, D.C. \nOn making contact with Martin O'Donoghue, who had played on the [[United States national rugby league team|United States National team]] [[American National Rugby League]], the first club meeting was held with fellow New Zealanders, Americans, Australians, and British players living in the D.C and surrounding areas. Martin was involved in the early development of The Slayers, along with the [[Connecticut Wildcats]] of [[Norwalk, Connecticut]], joined the league as [[expansion team]]s for the [[2003 AMNRL season|2003 season]]. At this time most players were recruited from [[rugby union]] clubs from across the greater Washington area, and many of them were personal friends of O'Donoghue, who served as the team's first coach.<ref name=history>{{cite web |url= http://www.dc-slayers.com/History.html|title= History of the Slayers|author= |year= 2010|work= dc-slayers.com |publisher= |accessdate=January 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Slayers went to the league playoffs in their inaugural year, advancing to the semi-finals before being defeated by the Connecticut Wildcats. They went to the playoffs again in 2004, but in the beginning of a trend that would follow the team through the 2000s, were knocked out in the first round by the team that would go on to win the Grand Final.

Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Marty and Wendy learn this is the home of businessman and political donor Charles Wilkes and meet him to persuade him to back the legislation. Helen shows the Byrdes video of Ash using Del's credit card in Chicago. She will overlook Del's death (and Garcia's) in exchange for \"reparations\" from the Snells but does not tell Marty what will be satisfactory. At Darlene's insistence, the Snells refuse to offer money, but Jacob understands a life must be paid, so he kills Ash to save Darlene. Marty and Wendy hide the truth from Charlotte and Jonah but acknowledge to each other that Ash's death satisfied the Navarros, meaning the casino project is still alive.\n |LineColor       = 066069\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 12\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = The Precious Blood of Jesus\n |DirectedBy      = Jason Bateman\n |WrittenBy       = [[David Manson (producer)|David Manson]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|8|31}}\n |ShortSummary    = The [[Kansas City Mafia]] sends Senator Mercer an unsubtle message, causing state senate support for the casino bill to waver. Marty capitalizes on Buddy's prior relationship with Kansas City Mafia associate Frank Cosgrove to reach agreement that the casino will be [[Trade union#United States|unionized]], which keeps the project viable. Wendy attends a prayer breakfast to woo faltering senators and resorts to blackmail. Wilkes makes a play for Wendy as the price for obtaining the vote of the last senate holdout, but Wendy rebuffs him. Wendy sees Mason preaching on the streets of Jefferson City, baby Zeke at his side. Rachel's drug-and-drinking binge causes her to wreck her car, leading Roy to turn her into an informant against Marty and send her back to the Blue Cat. Cade is paroled and rebuffs the job Ruth persuaded Marty to offer. Marty gives Ruth more responsibilities, including entrusting her with the cash to pay for acquiring and moving the riverboat that will house the casino. Darlene looks for someone to love and nurture in Ash's place and asks Jacob if they can adopt a baby.

The Byrde businesses are closed by state inspectors at Roy's instigation, while the Byrdes wonder who ordered it. Wilkes wants a large casino-adjacent development in exchange for his aid, but the Snells won't sell more land. The Snells, Marty, and Jonah go hunting to discuss it, and Jonah kills a deer. The Snells [[arson|torch]] Wilkes' boat as a warning to stop pressuring them. Wendy talks Blake's widow out of suing Wilkes for wrongful death by promising a charity in Blake's name. Rachel attempts to obtain evidence against Marty, and Roy uses stolen drugs to keep her in line. Ruth creates a problem at the boat repair shop where Cade works, which persuades the owner to sell and gives Marty a new business for laundering. Charlotte spends time with Wyatt, who continues pondering the deaths of Russ and Boyd. The Byrdes have dinner at the Snell house to celebrate their rapprochement, including venison from Jonah's deer.

Roy pressures Rachel for useful information, including pretending to be a Blue Cat bar customer. Rachel has bathroom sex with a bar pickup and calls him Marty to irritate Roy, who is monitoring her transmitter. To deflect Marty's suspicion from her, Rachel suggests the man from the Blue Cat (Roy) might be a police officer. An infuriated Roy threatens her with a violent end if she does not produce evidence. The Byrdes' planned bribe of a state gaming official ends when Wendy correctly suspects a trap. Wendy tries to provide money to Mason, who angrily refuses. Marty pays scant attention to Ruth while handling other problems, so she confides in Rachel, who uses the relationship to gather evidence for Roy. He obtains a search warrant for the Byrde home, where he identifies himself to Marty and Wendy for the first time. Sam runs Lickety Splitz in name only because, as a felon, Ruth cannot be associated with Marty during state scrutiny of the casino application.

Roy also informs him that Ruth tried to kill him by wiring the dock the same way she did when she killed her uncles. Roy makes Ruth look like an informant, and Helen asks the Byrdes whether she can be trusted. Marty hesitates before saying yes, then races to the Langmores to warn Ruth. Ruth admits she tried to kill Marty, but says she will not try again because circumstances have changed, so he vouches for her to Helen, but Helen's associates subject Ruth to [[waterboarding]] interrogation. Ruth does not crack, and Helen tells Marty she is impressed with Ruth's willpower. Marty reminds Wendy that she cheated on him, and Charlotte overhears and informs Jonah. Charlotte and Jonah discuss using what is left of their money took to buy a van and run away. Helen tells the Snells to burn their poppies so Roy will not find any evidence, but Darlene resists.

Roy leads a raid on the Snell farm, and Jacob says the burned field was an intentional controlled fire. Roy scoffs, but is ecstatic to find buried bones. Mason returns, hoping the bones include Grace's remains, and volunteers Zeke for DNA testing. Marty and the Snells disinter several Snell ancestors and use their remains to replace the bones the FBI found, throwing off the test results and enabling Jacob to claim authorities desecrated his family's ancient burial places. Roy interrogates Wilkes, who offers to inform on Marty in exchange for Wendy's protection, but she refuses to leave Marty. Ruth agrees to help her father with his illegal activities, deciding that working with Marty will not produce the long term benefits she hoped for.

Jacob acquiesces, and decides to kill Darlene to keep the peace. As he moves to stab her on their morning walk, he suddenly collapses. Darlene tells him she guessed his plan and poisoned his coffee, and they pledge their love to each other before he dies. Wilkes arranges for the Byrdes to meet the gaming commissioners and the chairman requests a non-union site in exchange for his support, to which Marty agrees, despite knowing it will anger Frank. The casino is approved, and Marty arranges an exit for his family that includes fleeing to Australia and leaving cartel business in Ruth's hands, to which Ruth agrees. Cade and Wyatt rob Lickety Splitz, and Ruth does not identify them to the sheriff, but does try to recover and return the money.

Instead, Ruth tells Wyatt, who drives away in anger. Angry that Cade attacked Charlotte while trying to find Marty's money, Wendy offers him $500,000 to leave town. He takes it and drives away, but the payoff is a ruse and Nelson kills him in an ambush. At the casino's opening ceremony, Helen tells the Byrdes she is returning to Chicago.

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore.

Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble.

Marty appears likely to meet the three-month deadline for laundering the cartel's $8 million, and he and Wendy temporarily reconcile in celebration. During sex, Marty intentionally reminds her of an encounter with Sugarwood, causing her discovery of the video Marty's private investigator made.
