To suppress the musket fire, the Royalists torched the houses where they thought the shooting was coming from. After the battle the Royalists spent the rest of the day in the town, during which time they pillaged it. The next morning after the main body of the Royalist force had left town, many more houses were put to the torch. While pillaging and firing on an unfortified town in retaliation for resistance was common at that time in Continental Europe it was not usual in England and this handed the Parliamentary side a propaganda weapon which they used to disparage the Royalists.\n\n==Prelude==\nAt the start of the Civil War the area that would become known as the [[Black Country]] in North-West Worcestershire and Birmingham was one of the few places in England that could produce the various military stores of which King Charles I was in dire need. As he had failed to secure the arsenals of Portsmouth and Hull, he did not possess any supply of swords, pikes, guns, shot; all these Worcestershire could and did provide. Shot came from Stourbridge and from Dudley Cannon. The numerous small forges which then existed on every brook in the north of the County turned out successive supplies of sword blades and pike heads. It is said that among the many causes of anger Charles had against Birmingham was that one of the best sword makers of the day, a man named [[Robert Porter (sword-cutler)|Robert Porter]], who lived and made his blades in Worcestershire but sold them in Birmingham, refused at any price to supply swords for \"[[Charles Stuart, that man of blood|that man of blood]]\", or any of his adherents.<ref name=Willis-Bund-4-5>{{harvnb|Willis-Bund|pp=4\u20135.}}</ref>{{efn|This was a term used by Independents to describe Charles I who they blamed for the bloodshed of the Civil War.<ref>Farr, p. 125.</ref>}}\n{{quote|So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.|[[King James Bible]] [http://bible.cc/numbers/35-33. Numbers 35:33]}}\n\nHowever, the Royalists had among their adherents Colonel [[Dud Dudley]], who had invented a means of smelting iron by the use of coal, and who claimed he could turn out \"all sorts of bar iron fit for making of muskets, carbines, and iron for great bolts\", both more cheaply, more speedily and more excellent than could be done in any other way. His method was now employed on the King's behalf.<ref name=Willis-Bund-4-5/>\n\nDuring the first campaign of the war, while marching from Shrewsbury to engage parliamentarian forces at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] on 17 October 1642, Charles passed through Birmingham. The towns folk seized some of his carriages, containing the royal plate and furniture, which they conveyed for security to [[Warwick Castle]], a parliamentary stronghold. During the first year of the war the inhabitants of Birmingham apprehended all messengers and suspected persons; frequently attacked and reduced small parties of the Royalists, whom they sent prisoners to the fortified city of [[Coventry]] (the origin of the proverbial expression, ''send him to Coventry'').{{sfn|Willis-Bund|p=59}}<ref>{{harvnb|Hutton|Guest|p=37.}}</ref>\n\nHistorian John Willis-Bund, said that one characteristic of Charles were the small acts of vengeance in which he indulged and so among the orders given to Prince Rupert for the Lichfield expedition was that he should teach Birmingham a lesson for their disloyalty, especially for the insults they had put on the King in October, 1642, before the [[Battle of Edgehill]], when they plundered the Royal Coach.<ref name=Willis-Bund-84>{{harvnb|Willis-Bund|p=84.}}</ref> [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon]] adds that Birmingham was then:<ref group=lower-alpha>For the Battle of Camp Hill, Willis-Bund cites Clarendon II pp. 180\u2013181, However different publications use different pagination.

Punish Birmingham, garrison Lichfield, and clear the country as far as possible. To do this he was given a force of 1200 horse and dragoons and 600 or 700 foot.<ref name=\"Willis-Bund-84\"/>\n\nOn Wednesday, 29 March 1643, Rupert left Oxford, reaching [[Chipping Norton]] that evening. On Thursday he was at [[Shipston-on-Stour]], on Friday, 31 March (Good Friday) at [[Stratford-on-Avon]], and on Saturday, 1 April (Easter Eve), at Henley-in-Arden. Here he spent Easter Sunday, and on Easter Monday, 3 April, set out for Birmingham to execute the first part of his task.<ref name=Willis-Bund-84/> Clarendon says:\n\n{{quote|[Birmingham] was never made a garrison by direction of Parliament, being built in such a form as was hardly capable of being fortified, yet they had so great a desire to distinguish themselves from the King's good subjects, that they cast up little slight works at both ends of the town, and barricadoed the rest, and voluntarily engaged themselves not to admit any intercourse with the King's forces.|Clarendon.{{sfn|Clarendon|p=24}}}}\n\nSo Rupert found it when, on 3 April, he marched there from [[Henley-in-Arden]]. After passing [[Shirley, West Midlands|Shirley]] the road entered Worcestershire, then proceeding northwards along one of the great main roads leading into Birmingham, now called the Stratford Road (it is joined at [[Sparkhill]], near where \"The Mermaid\" public house stood, by the road to Warwick).<ref name=Willis-Bund-84-85>{{harvnb|Willis-Bund|pp=84\u201385.}}</ref><ref>Mermaid Inn Warwick Road.</ref> Here the further approach to Birmingham was barred by some of the slight earthworks which had been thrown up. The men of Birmingham possessed a very inadequate force to defend these works. In the town a small company of foot soldiers under Captain Richard Greaves were stationed. The Lichfield garrison had sent in a troop of horse, but their united strength barely exceeded 200 men. Rupert did not believe that his large body would be opposed by so inferior a force.<ref name=Willis-Bund-85>{{harvnb|Willis-Bund|p=85.}}</ref> He therefore sent his Quarter-Master forward to take up his lodgings, and to \n{{quote|assure the townsmen if they behaved themselves peaceably they should not suffer for what was past. But they had not consciences good enough to believe him, and absolutely refused to let him quarter in the town, and from their little works, with mettle equal to their malice, discharged their shot upon him.|\nClarendon.<ref name=Willis-Bund-85/>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Birmingham History Galleries - Birmingham its people, its history - Origins - Civil War - The Battle of Birmingham - weather vane - cockerel (8161986459).jpg|left|thumb|A weather vane reportedly shot by Prince Rupert during the battle]]\n\nIt was about three in the afternoon that Rupert, to his surprise, found that \"the sturdy sons of freedom\",<ref name=Willis-Bund-85/>as the local historians Hutton and Guest called them, were determined to fight. This determination was opposed to the opinion of the Parliamentarians\u2014not only of the military, but also of the civilians\u2014the ministers of Birmingham, and the leading men of the town; but the \"middle and inferior sort\" of people, especially those that bore arms, insisted on resisting, so at last they all resolved to fight. Finding such was their case, Rupert gave the order to attack their defences at once. The defences were only a bank of earth, behind which the handful of musketeers was placed. As the Royalists advanced they received so heavy a fire that on reaching the works they could not stand up against it and had to retire. A second attempt met with a similar repulse.<ref name=Willis-Bund-85/>\n\nThings were getting serious; it would never do for Rupert to be defeated by the inhabitants of Birmingham. Yet there was little chance of carrying the works by a direct attack. Some of Rupert's men saw that it might be possible, by going across the fields, to ride round and get into the rear of the works, and from there charge the defenders. This was tried and proved successful.The defenders of the works could not stand being attacked front and rear, so abandoned the works and fled into the town. Rupert's troopers followed them. From the houses a desultory fire was kept up on the Royalist troopers as they advanced up the street. On this the troopers set fire to the houses from which they had been fired on, and the town was soon ablaze in several places. Pushing on the resistance became less; those who had fought fled and scattered.<ref name=Willis-Bund-85/>\n\nBut the fight was not over. Captain Richard Greaves rallied his troop of horse, and drawing them up at the further (the Lichfield) end of the town, wheeled them round, and charged the scattered  . Royalists Little expecting any resistance, the Royalists gave way. [[William Feilding, 1st Earl of Denbigh|Lord Denbigh]], who was leading them, was severely wounded, knocked off his horse, and left for dead; he died shortly after from his wounds, and his men fled back helter-skelter till they came near their own [[Colours, standards and guidons|colours]], and they formed up in the rear of the Royalist lines.<ref name=Willis-Bund-86>{{harvnb|Willis-Bund|p=86.}}</ref>\n\nGreaves, having carried out his object, which was by his charge to give time for his foot to get away, and to prevent them being pursued, did not press his success further. He had himself in his charge received no less than five wounds. Reforming his men he faced about, and drew off towards Lichfield. He had saved his soldiers, but he left the unfortunate townsmen to the tender mercies of Rupert's troopers.<ref name=Willis-Bund-86/>\n\nIrritated by the resistance, and especially by Greaves' charge, Rupert's men were not inclined to be merciful. They rode round the town, leaping hedges and ditches to catch the townsmen; those they caught they slew. If the lists given are to be trusted, tradesmen, labourers, women were all cut down indiscriminately.<ref name=Willis-Bund-86/>\n\n===The killing of two civilians===\nTwo cases were commented on shortly after the battle:\n\nSome of the troopers riding up to an inn, the ostler came out to take their horses, he was cut down and killed.<ref name=Willis-Bund-86/>\n\nA minister was slain in the street. Parliamentary supporters said he was mistaken for the minister of Birmingham, a vocal supporter of the Parliamentary cause, and was therefore murdered. The Royalists said that he told the troopers that \"the King was a perjured, Papistical King, and that he would rather die than live under such a King\",<ref name=Willis-Bund-86/><ref>{{harvnb|Hutton|Guest|p=60.}}</ref> and on hearing this the enraged troopers obliged him by cutting him down.<ref name=Willis-Bund-86/>\n\nParliamentary supporters alleged he had long been a lunatic, held \"Jewish opinions\", and had been held in [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]] and other prisons, some said for sixteen and others twenty-two years, and had only recently been released. On him were found a number of \"idle and foolish papers\", which the Parliament said proved him mad, the Royalists said proved him immoral. Like some other foolish people he kept a diary, and entered in it a number of matters that might well have been left out. \"28th March. A comfortable kiss from Mrs. E., with some moistness. A cynamon kiss from a noted woman. A kiss from a girl of 14 years old\".<ref name=Willis-Bund-86/>\n\nThe historian John Willis-Bund states that nothing could show better the feelings of both parties, and it may or may not have been in accordance with the laws of war to have cut down a preacher making disloyal speeches, but to kill in cold blood a man who had in his pocket a journal with doubtful entries was a disgrace even to those wild times.<ref name=Willis-Bund-86/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nRupert did not stay long in Birmingham. On Easter Tuesday, 4 April he marched from Birmingham to Walsall; on the Wednesday he reached Cannock. There he halted until Saturday, 8 April when he marched on to Lichfield and laid siege to the town.<ref>{{harvnb|Willis-Bund|pp=90\u201391.}}</ref>\n\n===Battlefield today===\n[[File:Ship Inn - Camp Hill - Birmingham.jpg|thumb|The Ship Inn in the mid-1860s. It was demolished in 1867.]]\n\nAll physical traces of Camp Hill fight have died. The ground has been all built over, and the site of the Birmingham earthworks is covered by streets. A relic remained until the middle of 19th century. The public-house at Camp Hill, known as the \"Old Ship\", was, according to local tradition, the headquarters of Rupert on the afternoon of that Easter Monday and survived long enough to be photographed.<ref>The Old Ship Inn.</ref>\n\n==Commentary==\nJohn Willis-Bund states that the battle of Camp Hill was remarkable from the fact that an armed mob\u2014they were nothing more\u2014twice repulsed assaults of the best troops in the Royalist army, who attacked them in overwhelming numbers. That less than 300 men should keep some 1,800 at bay, even for a short time, was an act that deserved to be recorded; that they, an untrained mob, should have checked the dreaded Royalist cavalry, was a still greater achievement. The Parliamentarians were delighted, and they had reason to be. Captain Greaves, probably a local man, a member of the family that lived at King's Norton, who commanded the Parliament troops, might well be proud of his men's achievement.<ref name=Willis-Bund-87>{{harvnb|Willis-Bund|pp=87.}}</ref>\n\nBund also states that nothing that had taken place in the war produced more controversy than the way in which Rupert treated Birmingham, and that it was certainly harsh, but by the laws of war as understood on the Continent, in the school in which Rupert had been brought up, there was nothing illegal or improper in it. If the owners of a house allowed firing from that house on the soldiers of the other side, the soldiers fired on were justified in destroying that house. Burning has always been one of the recognised means of destruction. Bund says that if Birmingham had been a Continental town nothing would ever have been heard of it; but because the Continental laws of war were applied to an English town the outcry was terrible.<ref name=Willis-Bund-87-88>{{harvnb|Willis-Bund|pp=87\u201388.}}</ref>\n\nTrevor Royal writing in 2004 draws the same conclusions as Bund, and says \"By laying waste to the town and setting fire to many of its houses, Rupert's force provided parliament with a propaganda coup ... Charles rebuked Rupert for his men's behaviour \u2014 the prince had in fact done his best to curb his men ... but the damage was done: Birmingham had paid the price for supporting parliament and being seen to profit from it\".{{sfn|Royal|=226}}\n\n==Contemporary reports==\nClarendon's account in his ''History of the Civil War'',{{sfn|Zuckerman|Eley|p=36}} written during and after the Civil War and published after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], show that there were strong feeling on the affair.<ref name=Willis-Bund-86/> Clarendon says that Rupert \n{{quote|took not that vengeance upon them they deserved, but made them expiate their transgressions by paying a less mulct than might have been expected from their wealth if their wickedness had been less.|Clarendon.<ref name=Willis-Bund-87/>}}\n\nClarendon then justifies the death of the clergyman:\n{{quote|He was killed at the entering of the town, after he had not only refused quarter, but provoked the soldier by the most odious revilings and reproaches of the person and honour of the King that can be imagined, and renouncing all allegiance to him; in whose pockets were found several papers of memorials of his own scurrilous behaviour, in such loose expressions as modest ears cannot endure. The man was the principal governor and incendiary of the rude people of that place against their Sovereign. So full a qualification was a heightened measure of malice and disloyalty for the service that it weighed down the infamy of any other vicious behaviour.|Clarendon.<ref name=Willis-Bund-87/>}}\n\nClarendon adds that if it had not been for the death of the Earl of Denbigh he should not \"have mentioned an action of so little moment as this of Birmingham\". He deplores it, because\n{{quote|of the dismal inequality of the contention in which always some earl or person of great honour or fortune fell when, after a most signal victory over the other side, there was seldom lost a man of any known family, or of other reputation than of passion for the cause in which he fell.|Clarendon.<ref name=Willis-Bund-87/>}}\n\nThe death of the Earl of Denbigh had a greater significance than many other earls because the Earl's son and successor ([[Basil Feilding, 2nd Earl of Denbigh|Basil Fielding]]) was a strong Parliamentarian, and the death of the Earl meant the transfer of the family influence, which was considerable, from the King to the Parliament.<ref name=Willis-Bund-87/>\n\nThe organs of the Parliament extolled the Birmingham bravery and the Royalist cruelty\u2014their wanton cruelty\u2014in burning houses. The Royalist organs rejoiced at the just judgment which had befallen the disloyal town, and the punishment it had pleased the Lord to inflict on the inhabitants for their rebellious views.<ref name=Willis-Bund-88 >{{harvnb|Willis-Bund|p=88.}}</ref>\n\nThree accounts of the fight were published.<ref name=Willis-Bund-88/> The first of the three was published on 3 April 1643. It is a Parliamentary account, gives their idea of the affair. Its title and introduction is: \n{{quote|''[[s:A True Relation of Prince Rvpert's Barbarous Cruelly against the Towne of Brumingham|True Relation of Prince Rvpert's Barbarous Cruelty against the Towne of Brumingham]],''\n<p>\nTo which place on Monday Apr. 3, 1643, he marcht<!--sic--> with 2000 horse and foot, 4 Drakes, and 2 Sakers; where after two houres<!--sic--> fight (being twice beaten off by the Townsmen, in all but 140 Musqueteers) he entered, put divers to the Sword, and burnt about 80 Houses to ashes, suffering no man to carry away his goods, or quench the fire, and making no difference between friend or foe; yet by God's providence the greatest losse<!--sic--> fell on the malignants<!--sic--> of the Town.\n<p>\nAnd of the Cavaliers were slaine divers chiefe Commanders, and men of great quality, amongst whom was the Earle of Denbigh, the Lord John Stewart: and as themselves report, the Lord Digby.\n<p>\n''London: Printed for John Wright in the Old-baily, April 12, 1643.''{{sfn|Hutton|Guest|p=42}}{{sfn|West|p=154}}{{efn|The report confuses Lord Digby and the Earl of Denbigh.

The pamphlet contains two reports, one signed \"R.

He is said to have known not only how to make, but also how to use, a sword when made, and that he used his own sword with some effect on that 3 April, being one of those troopers of Captain Greaves who took part in that charge against the Royalists towards the close of the fight near Smethwick, in which the Earl of Denbigh was killed.<ref name=Willis-Bund-88/> The other account is signed \" R.

The pamphlet claims that one or two houses were set on fire during the assault and once completed Rupert ordered the fires extinguished and that any other fires were started by troopers unknown, (against his explicit orders not to do so) after the main body of Cavaliers with Rupert in command left the town.\n\nThe third, dated 1 May 1643, is a strong Parliamentary production, possibly the most savage of all:-\n<blockquote>\n''[[s:Prince Rupert's Burning love of England, discovered in Birmingham's Flames|Prince Rupert's Burning love of England, discovered in Birmingham's Flames]]; or, a more Exact and true Naration of Birmingham's Calamities, under the barbarous and inhumane Cruelties of P.

To suppress the musket fire, the Royalists torched the houses where they thought the shooting was coming from. After the battle the Royalists spent the rest of the day in the town, during which time they pillaged it. The next morning after the main body of the Royalist force had left town, many more houses were put to the torch. While pillaging and firing on an unfortified town in retaliation for resistance was common at that time in Continental Europe it was not usual in England and this handed the Parliamentary side a propaganda weapon which they used to disparage the Royalists.\n\n==Prelude==\nAt the start of the Civil War the area that would become known as the [[Black Country]] in North-West Worcestershire and Birmingham was one of the few places in England that could produce the various military stores of which King Charles I was in dire need. As he had failed to secure the arsenals of Portsmouth and Hull, he did not possess any supply of swords, pikes, guns, shot; all these Worcestershire could and did provide. Shot came from Stourbridge and from Dudley Cannon. The numerous small forges which then existed on every brook in the north of the County turned out successive supplies of sword blades and pike heads. It is said that among the many causes of anger Charles had against Birmingham was that one of the best sword makers of the day, a man named [[Robert Porter (sword-cutler)|Robert Porter]], who lived and made his blades in Worcestershire but sold them in Birmingham, refused at any price to supply swords for \"[[Charles Stuart, that man of blood|that man of blood]]\", or any of his adherents.<ref name=Willis-Bund-4-5>{{harvnb|Willis-Bund|pp=4\u20135.}}</ref>{{efn|This was a term used by Independents to describe Charles I who they blamed for the bloodshed of the Civil War.<ref>Farr, p. 125.</ref>}}\n{{quote|So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.|[[King James Bible]] [http://bible.cc/numbers/35-33. Numbers 35:33]}}\n\nHowever, the Royalists had among their adherents Colonel [[Dud Dudley]], who had invented a means of smelting iron by the use of coal, and who claimed he could turn out \"all sorts of bar iron fit for making of muskets, carbines, and iron for great bolts\", both more cheaply, more speedily and more excellent than could be done in any other way. His method was now employed on the King's behalf.<ref name=Willis-Bund-4-5/>\n\nDuring the first campaign of the war, while marching from Shrewsbury to engage parliamentarian forces at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] on 17 October 1642, Charles passed through Birmingham. The towns folk seized some of his carriages, containing the royal plate and furniture, which they conveyed for security to [[Warwick Castle]], a parliamentary stronghold. During the first year of the war the inhabitants of Birmingham apprehended all messengers and suspected persons; frequently attacked and reduced small parties of the Royalists, whom they sent prisoners to the fortified city of [[Coventry]] (the origin of the proverbial expression, ''send him to Coventry'').{{sfn|Willis-Bund|p=59}}<ref>{{harvnb|Hutton|Guest|p=37.}}</ref>\n\nHistorian John Willis-Bund, said that one characteristic of Charles were the small acts of vengeance in which he indulged and so among the orders given to Prince Rupert for the Lichfield expedition was that he should teach Birmingham a lesson for their disloyalty, especially for the insults they had put on the King in October, 1642, before the [[Battle of Edgehill]], when they plundered the Royal Coach.<ref name=Willis-Bund-84>{{harvnb|Willis-Bund|p=84.}}</ref> [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon]] adds that Birmingham was then:<ref group=lower-alpha>For the Battle of Camp Hill, Willis-Bund cites Clarendon II pp. 180\u2013181, However different publications use different pagination.

Punish Birmingham, garrison Lichfield, and clear the country as far as possible. To do this he was given a force of 1200 horse and dragoons and 600 or 700 foot.<ref name=\"Willis-Bund-84\"/>\n\nOn Wednesday, 29 March 1643, Rupert left Oxford, reaching [[Chipping Norton]] that evening. On Thursday he was at [[Shipston-on-Stour]], on Friday, 31 March (Good Friday) at [[Stratford-on-Avon]], and on Saturday, 1 April (Easter Eve), at Henley-in-Arden. Here he spent Easter Sunday, and on Easter Monday, 3 April, set out for Birmingham to execute the first part of his task.<ref name=Willis-Bund-84/> Clarendon says:\n\n{{quote|[Birmingham] was never made a garrison by direction of Parliament, being built in such a form as was hardly capable of being fortified, yet they had so great a desire to distinguish themselves from the King's good subjects, that they cast up little slight works at both ends of the town, and barricadoed the rest, and voluntarily engaged themselves not to admit any intercourse with the King's forces.|Clarendon.{{sfn|Clarendon|p=24}}}}\n\nSo Rupert found it when, on 3 April, he marched there from [[Henley-in-Arden]]. After passing [[Shirley, West Midlands|Shirley]] the road entered Worcestershire, then proceeding northwards along one of the great main roads leading into Birmingham, now called the Stratford Road (it is joined at [[Sparkhill]], near where \"The Mermaid\" public house stood, by the road to Warwick).<ref name=Willis-Bund-84-85>{{harvnb|Willis-Bund|pp=84\u201385.}}</ref><ref>Mermaid Inn Warwick Road.</ref> Here the further approach to Birmingham was barred by some of the slight earthworks which had been thrown up. The men of Birmingham possessed a very inadequate force to defend these works. In the town a small company of foot soldiers under Captain Richard Greaves were stationed. The Lichfield garrison had sent in a troop of horse, but their united strength barely exceeded 200 men. Rupert did not believe that his large body would be opposed by so inferior a force.<ref name=Willis-Bund-85>{{harvnb|Willis-Bund|p=85.}}</ref> He therefore sent his Quarter-Master forward to take up his lodgings, and to \n{{quote|assure the townsmen if they behaved themselves peaceably they should not suffer for what was past. But they had not consciences good enough to believe him, and absolutely refused to let him quarter in the town, and from their little works, with mettle equal to their malice, discharged their shot upon him.|\nClarendon.<ref name=Willis-Bund-85/>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Birmingham History Galleries - Birmingham its people, its history - Origins - Civil War - The Battle of Birmingham - weather vane - cockerel (8161986459).jpg|left|thumb|A weather vane reportedly shot by Prince Rupert during the battle]]\n\nIt was about three in the afternoon that Rupert, to his surprise, found that \"the sturdy sons of freedom\",<ref name=Willis-Bund-85/>as the local historians Hutton and Guest called them, were determined to fight. This determination was opposed to the opinion of the Parliamentarians\u2014not only of the military, but also of the civilians\u2014the ministers of Birmingham, and the leading men of the town; but the \"middle and inferior sort\" of people, especially those that bore arms, insisted on resisting, so at last they all resolved to fight. Finding such was their case, Rupert gave the order to attack their defences at once. The defences were only a bank of earth, behind which the handful of musketeers was placed. As the Royalists advanced they received so heavy a fire that on reaching the works they could not stand up against it and had to retire. A second attempt met with a similar repulse.<ref name=Willis-Bund-85/>\n\nThings were getting serious; it would never do for Rupert to be defeated by the inhabitants of Birmingham. Yet there was little chance of carrying the works by a direct attack. Some of Rupert's men saw that it might be possible, by going across the fields, to ride round and get into the rear of the works, and from there charge the defenders. This was tried and proved successful.The defenders of the works could not stand being attacked front and rear, so abandoned the works and fled into the town. Rupert's troopers followed them. From the houses a desultory fire was kept up on the Royalist troopers as they advanced up the street. On this the troopers set fire to the houses from which they had been fired on, and the town was soon ablaze in several places. Pushing on the resistance became less; those who had fought fled and scattered.<ref name=Willis-Bund-85/>\n\nBut the fight was not over. Captain Richard Greaves rallied his troop of horse, and drawing them up at the further (the Lichfield) end of the town, wheeled them round, and charged the scattered  . Royalists Little expecting any resistance, the Royalists gave way. [[William Feilding, 1st Earl of Denbigh|Lord Denbigh]], who was leading them, was severely wounded, knocked off his horse, and left for dead; he died shortly after from his wounds, and his men fled back helter-skelter till they came near their own [[Colours, standards and guidons|colours]], and they formed up in the rear of the Royalist lines.<ref name=Willis-Bund-86>{{harvnb|Willis-Bund|p=86.}}</ref>\n\nGreaves, having carried out his object, which was by his charge to give time for his foot to get away, and to prevent them being pursued, did not press his success further. He had himself in his charge received no less than five wounds. Reforming his men he faced about, and drew off towards Lichfield. He had saved his soldiers, but he left the unfortunate townsmen to the tender mercies of Rupert's troopers.<ref name=Willis-Bund-86/>\n\nIrritated by the resistance, and especially by Greaves' charge, Rupert's men were not inclined to be merciful. They rode round the town, leaping hedges and ditches to catch the townsmen; those they caught they slew. If the lists given are to be trusted, tradesmen, labourers, women were all cut down indiscriminately.<ref name=Willis-Bund-86/>\n\n===The killing of two civilians===\nTwo cases were commented on shortly after the battle:\n\nSome of the troopers riding up to an inn, the ostler came out to take their horses, he was cut down and killed.<ref name=Willis-Bund-86/>\n\nA minister was slain in the street. Parliamentary supporters said he was mistaken for the minister of Birmingham, a vocal supporter of the Parliamentary cause, and was therefore murdered. The Royalists said that he told the troopers that \"the King was a perjured, Papistical King, and that he would rather die than live under such a King\",<ref name=Willis-Bund-86/><ref>{{harvnb|Hutton|Guest|p=60.}}</ref> and on hearing this the enraged troopers obliged him by cutting him down.<ref name=Willis-Bund-86/>\n\nParliamentary supporters alleged he had long been a lunatic, held \"Jewish opinions\", and had been held in [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]] and other prisons, some said for sixteen and others twenty-two years, and had only recently been released. On him were found a number of \"idle and foolish papers\", which the Parliament said proved him mad, the Royalists said proved him immoral. Like some other foolish people he kept a diary, and entered in it a number of matters that might well have been left out. \"28th March. A comfortable kiss from Mrs. E., with some moistness. A cynamon kiss from a noted woman. A kiss from a girl of 14 years old\".<ref name=Willis-Bund-86/>\n\nThe historian John Willis-Bund states that nothing could show better the feelings of both parties, and it may or may not have been in accordance with the laws of war to have cut down a preacher making disloyal speeches, but to kill in cold blood a man who had in his pocket a journal with doubtful entries was a disgrace even to those wild times.<ref name=Willis-Bund-86/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nRupert did not stay long in Birmingham. On Easter Tuesday, 4 April he marched from Birmingham to Walsall; on the Wednesday he reached Cannock. There he halted until Saturday, 8 April when he marched on to Lichfield and laid siege to the town.<ref>{{harvnb|Willis-Bund|pp=90\u201391.}}</ref>\n\n===Battlefield today===\n[[File:Ship Inn - Camp Hill - Birmingham.jpg|thumb|The Ship Inn in the mid-1860s. It was demolished in 1867.]]\n\nAll physical traces of Camp Hill fight have died. The ground has been all built over, and the site of the Birmingham earthworks is covered by streets. A relic remained until the middle of 19th century. The public-house at Camp Hill, known as the \"Old Ship\", was, according to local tradition, the headquarters of Rupert on the afternoon of that Easter Monday and survived long enough to be photographed.<ref>The Old Ship Inn.</ref>\n\n==Commentary==\nJohn Willis-Bund states that the battle of Camp Hill was remarkable from the fact that an armed mob\u2014they were nothing more\u2014twice repulsed assaults of the best troops in the Royalist army, who attacked them in overwhelming numbers. That less than 300 men should keep some 1,800 at bay, even for a short time, was an act that deserved to be recorded; that they, an untrained mob, should have checked the dreaded Royalist cavalry, was a still greater achievement. The Parliamentarians were delighted, and they had reason to be. Captain Greaves, probably a local man, a member of the family that lived at King's Norton, who commanded the Parliament troops, might well be proud of his men's achievement.<ref name=Willis-Bund-87>{{harvnb|Willis-Bund|pp=87.}}</ref>\n\nBund also states that nothing that had taken place in the war produced more controversy than the way in which Rupert treated Birmingham, and that it was certainly harsh, but by the laws of war as understood on the Continent, in the school in which Rupert had been brought up, there was nothing illegal or improper in it. If the owners of a house allowed firing from that house on the soldiers of the other side, the soldiers fired on were justified in destroying that house. Burning has always been one of the recognised means of destruction. Bund says that if Birmingham had been a Continental town nothing would ever have been heard of it; but because the Continental laws of war were applied to an English town the outcry was terrible.<ref name=Willis-Bund-87-88>{{harvnb|Willis-Bund|pp=87\u201388.}}</ref>\n\nTrevor Royal writing in 2004 draws the same conclusions as Bund, and says \"By laying waste to the town and setting fire to many of its houses, Rupert's force provided parliament with a propaganda coup ... Charles rebuked Rupert for his men's behaviour \u2014 the prince had in fact done his best to curb his men ... but the damage was done: Birmingham had paid the price for supporting parliament and being seen to profit from it\".{{sfn|Royal|=226}}\n\n==Contemporary reports==\nClarendon's account in his ''History of the Civil War'',{{sfn|Zuckerman|Eley|p=36}} written during and after the Civil War and published after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], show that there were strong feeling on the affair.<ref name=Willis-Bund-86/> Clarendon says that Rupert \n{{quote|took not that vengeance upon them they deserved, but made them expiate their transgressions by paying a less mulct than might have been expected from their wealth if their wickedness had been less.|Clarendon.<ref name=Willis-Bund-87/>}}\n\nClarendon then justifies the death of the clergyman:\n{{quote|He was killed at the entering of the town, after he had not only refused quarter, but provoked the soldier by the most odious revilings and reproaches of the person and honour of the King that can be imagined, and renouncing all allegiance to him; in whose pockets were found several papers of memorials of his own scurrilous behaviour, in such loose expressions as modest ears cannot endure. The man was the principal governor and incendiary of the rude people of that place against their Sovereign. So full a qualification was a heightened measure of malice and disloyalty for the service that it weighed down the infamy of any other vicious behaviour.|Clarendon.<ref name=Willis-Bund-87/>}}\n\nClarendon adds that if it had not been for the death of the Earl of Denbigh he should not \"have mentioned an action of so little moment as this of Birmingham\". He deplores it, because\n{{quote|of the dismal inequality of the contention in which always some earl or person of great honour or fortune fell when, after a most signal victory over the other side, there was seldom lost a man of any known family, or of other reputation than of passion for the cause in which he fell.|Clarendon.<ref name=Willis-Bund-87/>}}\n\nThe death of the Earl of Denbigh had a greater significance than many other earls because the Earl's son and successor ([[Basil Feilding, 2nd Earl of Denbigh|Basil Fielding]]) was a strong Parliamentarian, and the death of the Earl meant the transfer of the family influence, which was considerable, from the King to the Parliament.<ref name=Willis-Bund-87/>\n\nThe organs of the Parliament extolled the Birmingham bravery and the Royalist cruelty\u2014their wanton cruelty\u2014in burning houses. The Royalist organs rejoiced at the just judgment which had befallen the disloyal town, and the punishment it had pleased the Lord to inflict on the inhabitants for their rebellious views.<ref name=Willis-Bund-88 >{{harvnb|Willis-Bund|p=88.}}</ref>\n\nThree accounts of the fight were published.<ref name=Willis-Bund-88/> The first of the three was published on 3 April 1643. It is a Parliamentary account, gives their idea of the affair. Its title and introduction is: \n{{quote|''[[s:A True Relation of Prince Rvpert's Barbarous Cruelly against the Towne of Brumingham|True Relation of Prince Rvpert's Barbarous Cruelty against the Towne of Brumingham]],''\n<p>\nTo which place on Monday Apr. 3, 1643, he marcht<!--sic--> with 2000 horse and foot, 4 Drakes, and 2 Sakers; where after two houres<!--sic--> fight (being twice beaten off by the Townsmen, in all but 140 Musqueteers) he entered, put divers to the Sword, and burnt about 80 Houses to ashes, suffering no man to carry away his goods, or quench the fire, and making no difference between friend or foe; yet by God's providence the greatest losse<!--sic--> fell on the malignants<!--sic--> of the Town.\n<p>\nAnd of the Cavaliers were slaine divers chiefe Commanders, and men of great quality, amongst whom was the Earle of Denbigh, the Lord John Stewart: and as themselves report, the Lord Digby.\n<p>\n''London: Printed for John Wright in the Old-baily, April 12, 1643.''{{sfn|Hutton|Guest|p=42}}{{sfn|West|p=154}}{{efn|The report confuses Lord Digby and the Earl of Denbigh.

The pamphlet contains two reports, one signed \"R.

He is said to have known not only how to make, but also how to use, a sword when made, and that he used his own sword with some effect on that 3 April, being one of those troopers of Captain Greaves who took part in that charge against the Royalists towards the close of the fight near Smethwick, in which the Earl of Denbigh was killed.<ref name=Willis-Bund-88/> The other account is signed \" R.

The pamphlet claims that one or two houses were set on fire during the assault and once completed Rupert ordered the fires extinguished and that any other fires were started by troopers unknown, (against his explicit orders not to do so) after the main body of Cavaliers with Rupert in command left the town.\n\nThe third, dated 1 May 1643, is a strong Parliamentary production, possibly the most savage of all:-\n<blockquote>\n''[[s:Prince Rupert's Burning love of England, discovered in Birmingham's Flames|Prince Rupert's Burning love of England, discovered in Birmingham's Flames]]; or, a more Exact and true Naration of Birmingham's Calamities, under the barbarous and inhumane Cruelties of P.

The small Strength which Birmingham had to maintaine their defence, the Names of their men slaine; the number of houses burned, and persons thereby destitute of habitation ; with divers other considerable passages.\n\nPublished at the request of the Committee at Coventry, that the Kingdom may timely take notice what is generally to be expected if the Cavaliers insolencies be not speedily crushed.\n\n''A righteous man regardeth the life of hit Beast, but the lender mereies of l/w wicked are cruell.\u2014Prov. xii. 10.''\n\n''London'': Printed for ''Thomas Vnderhill'', 1643.\n[A MS.

His defeat of the men of Birmingham was resented, but still more so was his application of the rules of war to unfortified towns. For long after the Parliamentarians never ceased to speak in the strongest terms of the Birmingham Butcheries.<ref name=Willis-Bund-89>{{harvnb|Willis-Bund|p=89}}.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|indent=yes}}\n::{{Citation |last=Clarendon |first=Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon |year=1849 |title=The History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England: Together with an Historical View of the Affairs of Ireland'' |volume=3 |edition=7 volumes, forward by William Warburton  |publisher=University Press}}\n::{{Citation |last=Farr |first=David |year=2006 |title=Henry Ireton and the English Revolution' |publisher=Boydell Press  |isbn=978-1-84383-235-5}}\n::{{Citation |last=Hutton |first=William |first2=James |last2=Guest |title=The History of Birmingham: With Considerable Additions |edition= 6th |publisher= G.

It was also the most intense Atlantic hurricane on record until [[Hurricane Gilbert]] in [[1988 Atlantic hurricane season|1988]]. The fourth [[tropical cyclone]], third tropical storm, second hurricane, and second [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|major hurricane]] of the [[1935 Atlantic hurricane season]], the Labor Day hurricane was one of four [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 5 hurricane]]s on record to strike the contiguous United States, along with [[Hurricane Andrew]] in [[1992 Atlantic hurricane season|1992]], [[Hurricane Camille]] in [[1969 Atlantic hurricane season|1969]], and [[Hurricane Michael]] in [[2018 Atlantic hurricane season|2018]]. In addition, it was the third most intense Atlantic hurricane on record in terms of [[barometric pressure]], behind Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, and [[Hurricane Wilma]] in [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]].\n\nThe hurricane intensified rapidly, passing near [[Long Key]] on the evening of Monday, September 2. The region was swept by a massive storm surge as the eye passed over the area. The waters quickly receded after carving new channels connecting the bay with the ocean; however, gale-force winds and high seas persisted into Tuesday, preventing rescue efforts. The storm continued northwestward along the Florida west coast, weakening before its second landfall near [[Cedar Key, Florida]], on September 4.\n\nThe compact and intense hurricane caused catastrophic damage in the upper Florida Keys, as a [[storm surge]] of approximately {{convert|18|to|20|ft|m}} swept over the low-lying islands. The hurricane's strong winds and the surge destroyed nearly all the structures between [[Tavernier, Florida|Tavernier]] and [[Marathon, Florida|Marathon]]. The town of [[Islamorada, Florida|Islamorada]] was obliterated. Portions of the [[Overseas Railroad|Key West Extension]] of the [[Florida East Coast Railway]] were severely damaged or destroyed. In addition, many veterans died in work camps created for the construction of the [[Overseas Highway]], in part due to poor working conditions. The hurricane also caused additional damage in northwest Florida, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and the [[The Carolinas|Carolinas]].\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{Strongest landfalling Atlantic hurricanes|align=right}}\n{{Most intense Atlantic hurricanes|align=right}}\n{{storm path|1935 Labor Day hurricane track.png}}\nAn area of interest developed northeast of the Turks Islands toward the end of August. By August 31, a definite tropical depression appeared near Long Island in the southeastern Bahamas and quickly intensified. It reached hurricane intensity near the south end of [[Andros, Bahamas|Andros Island]] on September 1.<ref name=\"American Meteorological Society\"/> The storm then [[Rapid intensification|explosively intensified]] and turned toward the Florida Keys at a rate of 10&nbsp;mph. The storm had an eye 9\u201310 miles across. The storm made landfall late on September 2 near Long Key, with an intensity of 892 mbar. After leaving the Keys, the storm weakened as it skirted the Florida gulf coast, making a second landfall at Cedar Keys. The storm sped up and rapidly weakened over the Mid-Atlantic states, causing heavy rainfall, with the highest total being 16.7 inches (420&nbsp;mm) in Easton, Maryland. The storm finally emerged over the open Atlantic near [[Cape Henry]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Tannehill|title=Hurricanes, Their Nature and History|year=1938|pages=214\u2013215}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|page=SA 1\u201326|title=Storm Total Rainfall In The United States|author=United States Army Corps of Engineers|publisher=War Department|date=1945}}</ref> The storm continued into the North Atlantic Ocean, where it merged with an [[extratropical cyclone]] on September 10.<ref name=\"American Meteorological Society\" />\n\nThe first recorded instance of an aircraft flown for the specific purpose of locating a hurricane occurred on the afternoon of September 2, 1935.

From [[Ernest Hemingway|Ernest Hemingway's]] statement on the tragedy:<ref>http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/16158</ref>\n\n<blockquote>... wealthy people, yachtsmen, fishermen such as President Hoover and President Roosevelt, do not come to the Florida Keys in hurricane months ... There is a known danger to property. But veterans, especially the bonus-marching variety of veterans, are not property. They are only human beings; unsuccessful human beings, and all they have to lose is their lives. They are doing coolie labor for a top wage of $45 a month and they have been put down on the Florida Keys where they can't make trouble. It is hurricane months, sure, but if anything comes up, you can always evacuate them, can't you? ... It is not necessary to go into the deaths of the civilians and their families since they were on the Keys of their own free will; they made their living there, had property and knew the hazards involved. But the veterans had been sent there; they had no opportunity to leave, nor any protection against hurricanes; and they never had a chance for their lives. Who sent nearly a thousand war veterans, many of them husky, hard-working and simply out of luck, but many of them close to the border of pathological cases, to live in frame shacks on the Florida Keys in hurricane months?</blockquote>\n\nIn the same issue of ''The New Masses'' appeared an editorial charging criminal negligence and a cartoon by Russell T.

He finished on Sunday, September 8, the day an elaborate memorial service and mass burial of hurricane victims (both coordinated by Ijams) were held in Miami.<ref>Miami Daily News, Sept. 9, 1935, p. 1i, \"Thousands Bow in Tribute Paid to Storm Dead.\" [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8AgtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=r9UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3138%2C704134 Google News]</ref> Ijams, who had been too busy to participate in the investigation and had not questioned any of the 12 witnesses interrogated by Williams, nonetheless signed the 15 page report to the President.<ref>Report, Williams and Ijams to Roosevelt, Sept. 8, 1935, FDR Library. [https://www.flickr.com/photos/bareford94/albums/72157651991134805/ Flickr]</ref> That night Williams released it to the Miami press in a radio broadcast immediately following the memorial ceremony. Ijams considered the timing unfortunate after receiving several critical telephone messages.<ref>Telegram, Ijams to Hines, Sept. 9, 1935. [https://www.flickr.com/photos/bareford94/sets/72157651991134805/ Flickr]</ref> The report exonerated everyone involved and concluded: \"To our mind the catastrophe must be characterized as an [[act of God]] and was by its very nature beyond the power of man or instruments at his disposal to foresee sufficiently far enough in advance to permit the taking of adequate precautions capable of preventing the death and desolation which occurred.\"<ref>Miami Daily News, September 9, 1935, p. 9, \"Storm Deaths an Act of God, Says Williams\".

In a telegram to his colleague, assistant Presidential secretary [[Marvin H.

[https://www.flickr.com/photos/bareford94/sets/72157651991134805/ Flickr]</ref> Hopkins gave similar instructions to his investigator. McIntyre also was involved in damage control. On Sept. 10, 1935, the Greater Miami Ministerial Association wrote the President an angry letter labeling the report a \"[[Whitewash (censorship)|whitewash]]\". McIntyre forwarded it to FERA for a response. Williams returned a draft for the President's signature on Sept. 25th insisting the report was only preliminary and that the \"final and detailed report   ... will be both thorough and searching\".<ref>Correspondence regarding letter from the Greater Miami Ministerial Association, Sept. 10, 1935.

On Sept. 11, 1935, Hines directed the skeptical and meticulous David W. Kennamer to investigate the disaster. There was immediate friction between them; Kennamer believed Abt did not have an open mind and Abt felt further investigation was unnecessary.<ref>Letter, Kennamer to Jared, Sept. 12, 1935 [https://www.flickr.com/photos/bareford94/sets/72157652134280172/ Flickr]</ref> Working with Harry W.

Hines was a holdover from the Hoover administration.

The Legion's National Commander, Ray Murphy, mailed a copy to President Roosevelt. It concluded that:\n\n{{quote|... the blame for the loss of life can be placed on \"Inefficiency, Indifference, and Ignorance.\" Inefficiency in the setup of the camps. Indifference of someone in charge as to the safety of the men. Ignorance of the real danger from a tropical hurricane. And these \"I's\" can be added together and they spell \"Murder at Matacombe\" {{sic}}.\n\n[The] committee early in its investigation noticed a tendency on the part of some to reflect on the character of the men who were veterans in the camps. Several parties referred to them as \"bums,\" \"drunkards,\" \"crazy men,\" \"riff-raff\" and the like. They seem to think that \"they got what was coming to them.\"\n\nHow anyone could arrive at such a conclusion is impossible for us to determine.\n\nIf these men were \"bums,\" \"drunkards,\" \"crazy men\" etc. then it was all the more necessary that every precaution be taken to protect them. If they fell into this category they were subnormal men and should have been treated as such. If they were incapable of caring for themselves then the government should have placed them in hospitals and not have sent them to a wilderness in the high-seas on a so called \"rehabilitation program.\"\n\nOthers testified that the men were well-behaved and that a great majority of them would have preferred to have been placed under military discipline in the camps. But these observations are of no real value except to show that some people are trying to \"cover up\" the real guilt of responsible parties.<ref>Report of Special Investigation Committee, Florida Hurricane Disaster to National Executive Committee, The American Legion, by Quimby Melton, Georgia, Chairman, November 1, 1935, p. 6.

Islamorada sustained winds of 200 miles per hour and a barometer reading of 26.35 inches for many hours on that fateful holiday; most local buildings and the Florida East Coast Railway were destroyed by what remains the most savage hurricane on record.  Hundreds of World War I veterans who had been camped in the Matecumbe area while working on the construction of U.S. Highway One for the Works Progress Administration (WPA) were killed. In 1937 the cremated remains of approximately 300 people were placed within the tiled crypt in front of the monument. The monument is composed of native keystone, and its striking frieze depicts coconut palm trees bending before the force of hurricane winds while the waters from an angry sea lap at the bottom of their trunks. Monument construction was funded by the WPA and regional veterans' associations.

It was also the most intense Atlantic hurricane on record until [[Hurricane Gilbert]] in [[1988 Atlantic hurricane season|1988]]. The fourth [[tropical cyclone]], third tropical storm, second hurricane, and second [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|major hurricane]] of the [[1935 Atlantic hurricane season]], the Labor Day hurricane was one of four [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 5 hurricane]]s on record to strike the contiguous United States, along with [[Hurricane Andrew]] in [[1992 Atlantic hurricane season|1992]], [[Hurricane Camille]] in [[1969 Atlantic hurricane season|1969]], and [[Hurricane Michael]] in [[2018 Atlantic hurricane season|2018]]. In addition, it was the third most intense Atlantic hurricane on record in terms of [[barometric pressure]], behind Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, and [[Hurricane Wilma]] in [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]].\n\nThe hurricane intensified rapidly, passing near [[Long Key]] on the evening of Monday, September 2. The region was swept by a massive storm surge as the eye passed over the area. The waters quickly receded after carving new channels connecting the bay with the ocean; however, gale-force winds and high seas persisted into Tuesday, preventing rescue efforts. The storm continued northwestward along the Florida west coast, weakening before its second landfall near [[Cedar Key, Florida]], on September 4.\n\nThe compact and intense hurricane caused catastrophic damage in the upper Florida Keys, as a [[storm surge]] of approximately {{convert|18|to|20|ft|m}} swept over the low-lying islands. The hurricane's strong winds and the surge destroyed nearly all the structures between [[Tavernier, Florida|Tavernier]] and [[Marathon, Florida|Marathon]]. The town of [[Islamorada, Florida|Islamorada]] was obliterated. Portions of the [[Overseas Railroad|Key West Extension]] of the [[Florida East Coast Railway]] were severely damaged or destroyed. In addition, many veterans died in work camps created for the construction of the [[Overseas Highway]], in part due to poor working conditions. The hurricane also caused additional damage in northwest Florida, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and the [[The Carolinas|Carolinas]].\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{Strongest landfalling Atlantic hurricanes|align=right}}\n{{Most intense Atlantic hurricanes|align=right}}\n{{storm path|1935 Labor Day hurricane track.png}}\nAn area of interest developed northeast of the Turks Islands toward the end of August.

It reached hurricane intensity near the south end of [[Andros, Bahamas|Andros Island]] on September 1.<ref name=\"American Meteorological Society\"/> The storm then [[Rapid intensification|explosively intensified]] and turned toward the Florida Keys at a rate of 10&nbsp;mph. The storm had an eye 9\u201310 miles across. The storm made landfall late on September 2 near Long Key, with an intensity of 892 mbar. After leaving the Keys, the storm weakened as it skirted the Florida gulf coast, making a second landfall at Cedar Keys. The storm sped up and rapidly weakened over the Mid-Atlantic states, causing heavy rainfall, with the highest total being 16.7 inches (420&nbsp;mm) in Easton, Maryland.

Its eye was eight miles (13&nbsp;km.) across and the fiercest winds extended 15&nbsp;miles (24&nbsp;km.) off the center, less than 1992's [[Hurricane Andrew]], which was also a relatively small and catastrophic Category&nbsp;5 hurricane. [[Craig Key]], [[Long Key]], and [[Upper Matecumbe Key|Upper Matecumbe]] and [[Lower Matecumbe Key|Lower Matecumbe]] Keys suffered the worst. The storm caused wind and flood damage along the [[Florida panhandle]] and into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and significant damage to the [[Tampa Bay Area]].<ref name=\"Google News\">''St. Petersburg Times'', Sept. 5, 1935, p. 1. \"Storm Danger Fades Here, Damage Heavy\".

Public health officials ordered plain wood coffins holding the dead to be stacked and burned in several locations. The [[National Weather Service]] estimated 408 deaths from the hurricane. Bodies were recovered as far away as [[Flamingo, Florida|Flamingo]] and Cape Sable on the southwest tip of the Florida mainland.\n\nThe [[United States Coast Guard]] and other federal and state agencies organized evacuation and relief efforts. Boats and airplanes carried injured survivors to Miami. The railroad was never rebuilt, but temporary bridges and ferry landings were under construction as soon as materials arrived. On March 29, 1938, the last gap in the Overseas Highway linking Key West to the mainland was completed. The new highway incorporated the roadbed and surviving bridges of the railway.\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Response===\n====Veterans' work camps====\nThree veterans' work camps existed in the Florida Keys before the hurricane: #1 on [[Windley Key]], #3 and #5 on [[Lower Matecumbe Key]].<ref>Florida Hurricane Disaster Hearings, p. 3, Testimony of J.

He had orders from the President who was very distressed by the news from Florida. The VA was to: 1. Cooperate with FERA in seeing that everything possible be done for those injured in the hurricane; 2. See that the bodies were properly cared for shipment home to relatives, and that those bodies for which shipment home was not requested be sent to [[Arlington National Cemetery]]; and, 3. Conduct a very careful joint investigation with Mr. Hopkins' organization, to determine whether there was any fault that would lie against anyone in the Administration.

There is a known danger to property. But veterans, especially the bonus-marching variety of veterans, are not property. They are only human beings; unsuccessful human beings, and all they have to lose is their lives. They are doing coolie labor for a top wage of $45 a month and they have been put down on the Florida Keys where they can't make trouble. It is hurricane months, sure, but if anything comes up, you can always evacuate them, can't you? ... It is not necessary to go into the deaths of the civilians and their families since they were on the Keys of their own free will; they made their living there, had property and knew the hazards involved. But the veterans had been sent there; they had no opportunity to leave, nor any protection against hurricanes; and they never had a chance for their lives.

The Legion's National Commander, Ray Murphy, mailed a copy to President Roosevelt. It concluded that:\n\n{{quote|... the blame for the loss of life can be placed on \"Inefficiency, Indifference, and Ignorance.\" Inefficiency in the setup of the camps. Indifference of someone in charge as to the safety of the men. Ignorance of the real danger from a tropical hurricane. And these \"I's\" can be added together and they spell \"Murder at Matacombe\" {{sic}}.\n\n[The] committee early in its investigation noticed a tendency on the part of some to reflect on the character of the men who were veterans in the camps. Several parties referred to them as \"bums,\" \"drunkards,\" \"crazy men,\" \"riff-raff\" and the like. They seem to think that \"they got what was coming to them.\"\n\nHow anyone could arrive at such a conclusion is impossible for us to determine.\n\nIf these men were \"bums,\" \"drunkards,\" \"crazy men\" etc. then it was all the more necessary that every precaution be taken to protect them. If they fell into this category they were subnormal men and should have been treated as such. If they were incapable of caring for themselves then the government should have placed them in hospitals and not have sent them to a wilderness in the high-seas on a so called \"rehabilitation program.\"\n\nOthers testified that the men were well-behaved and that a great majority of them would have preferred to have been placed under military discipline in the camps. But these observations are of no real value except to show that some people are trying to \"cover up\" the real guilt of responsible parties.<ref>Report of Special Investigation Committee, Florida Hurricane Disaster to National Executive Committee, The American Legion, by Quimby Melton, Georgia, Chairman, November 1, 1935, p. 6.

Islamorada sustained winds of 200 miles per hour and a barometer reading of 26.35 inches for many hours on that fateful holiday; most local buildings and the Florida East Coast Railway were destroyed by what remains the most savage hurricane on record.  Hundreds of World War I veterans who had been camped in the Matecumbe area while working on the construction of U.S. Highway One for the Works Progress Administration (WPA) were killed. In 1937 the cremated remains of approximately 300 people were placed within the tiled crypt in front of the monument. The monument is composed of native keystone, and its striking frieze depicts coconut palm trees bending before the force of hurricane winds while the waters from an angry sea lap at the bottom of their trunks. Monument construction was funded by the WPA and regional veterans' associations. Over the years the Hurricane Monument has been cared for by local veterans, hurricane survivors, and descendants of the victims.<ref>{{cite sign|title=Florida Keys Memorial|author=Islamorada Historical Heritage Monument Trail|type=Trail plaque|year=2008|location=Islamorada, Florida}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nLocal residents hold ceremonies at the monument every year on Labor Day (on the Monday holiday) and on Memorial Day to honor the veterans and the civilians who died in the hurricane.<ref>Matecumbe Historical Trust, [http://www.matecumbehistoricaltrust.com/calendar.cfm Calendar of Events] for May and September</ref>\n\n====Woodlawn Park Cemetery====\n\nOn January 31, 1936, Harvey W.

Many Ghanaian films are co-produced with [[Cinema of Nigeria|Nollywood]], the Nigerian film industry, and some are distributed by Nigerian marketers. Also, Nigerian filmmakers often feature Ghanaian actors and actresses in their movies and Ghanaian filmmakers feature Nigerian actors and actresses in theirs. [[Nadia Buari]], [[Yvonne Nelson]], [[Lydia Forson]] and [[Jackie Appiah]] all popular Ghanaian actresses and [[Van Vicker]] and [[Majid Michel]] both popular Ghanaian actors, have starred in many Nigerian movies. As a result of these collaborations, Western viewers often confuse Ghanaian movies with Nollywood and count their sales as one; however, they are two independent industries that sometimes share ''Nollywood''. In 2009, [[Unesco]] described Nollywood as the second-biggest film industry in the world after [[Bollywood]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article7086248.ece |title=Nollywood success puts Nigeria's film industry in regional spotlight |work=The Times|first=Jonathan|last=Clayton|date=3 April 2010|accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Media===\n{{Main|Media of Ghana}}\n[[File:Ghana Trustworthiness of Media.jpg|thumb|Ghana mass media, [[news]] and information provided by television.]]\n\nThe [[media of Ghana]] are amongst the most free in Africa.
