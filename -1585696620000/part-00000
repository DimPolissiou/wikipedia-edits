After a single 2\u00bd hour practice where he studied only 12 offensive plays, Walker had an incredible debut against the [[Green Bay Packers]]. He produced the best rushing game by a Viking back since [[1983 NFL season|1983]] and the first over-100 yard rushing performance by a Viking since [[1987 NFL season|1987]], gaining 148 yards on 18 carries.\n\nHe received three standing ovations from the record [[Metrodome]] crowd of 62,075, producing a Vikings win after four successive losses and 14 of the prior 18 matches with the Packers. However, his production thereafter declined. The problem was that the Vikings refused to make Walker the centerpiece of their offense and Walker couldn't use his custom tailored running scheme made by Dallas; which was power running between the tackles from the I-formation with a blocking fullback in front of him, to save the Vikings.

In [[1996 NFL season|1996]], he rejoined the team as a [[kickoff return]] specialist and third-down back. He also played fullback, but primarily as a ball-handler instead of a blocker out of I-Form and pro-sets.

Dorsett played in 12 games (6 starts) and had two healthy DNP (Did Not Play), which would make him demand a trade that would send him to the [[Denver Broncos]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&dat=19871225&id=nqlJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Vw4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=4233,1875422&hl=es |title=No Trade Underneath Tony Dorsett's Tree |accessdate=February 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWalker established himself as a premier NFL running back in [[1988 Dallas Cowboys season|1988]], becoming a one-man offense, reaching his NFL career highs of 1,514 rushing yards and 505 receiving yards, while playing seven positions: [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]], fullback, [[tight end]], [[H-back]], [[wide receiver]], both in the slot and as a flanker. He became just the 10th player in NFL history to amass more than 2,000 combined rushing and receiving yards in a season. In the process he achieved two consecutive [[Pro Bowl]]s ([[1987 NFL season|1987]] and 1988).\n\nIn [[1989 NFL season|1989]], at the height of his NFL career, the [[Herschel Walker trade|Cowboys traded Walker]] to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] for a total of five players (linebacker [[Jesse Solomon]], defensive back [[Issiac Holt]], running back [[Darrin Nelson]], linebacker [[David Howard (linebacker)|David Howard]], defensive end [[Alex Stewart (American football)|Alex Stewart]]) and six future draft picks. The five players were tied to potential draft picks Minnesota would give Dallas if a player was cut (which led to [[Emmitt Smith]], [[Russell Maryland]], [[Kevin Smith (cornerback)|Kevin Smith]], and [[Darren Woodson]]). This was claimed to be a turning point in the rise of the Cowboys to the NFL's top echelon. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Jimmy |last2=Hinton |first2=Ed |title=Turning the Thing Around |url=https://archive.org/details/turningthingarou0000john |url-access=registration |date=1993 |publisher=Hyperion |isbn=1-56282-725-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/turningthingarou0000john/page/52 52\u201354]}}</ref>\n\n====Minnesota Vikings====\nNicknamed the \"HWT\" ([[Herschel Walker trade]]), Walker's trade to Minnesota was initially considered by many as supplying the Vikings with the \"missing piece\" for a [[Super Bowl]] run; however, over time, as the Cowboys' fortunes soared and the Vikings' waned, it became viewed as, perhaps, the most lopsided trade in NFL history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000407775/article/herschel-walker-trade-boon-for-cowboys-bust-for-vikings|title=Herschel Walker trade: Boon for Cowboys, bust for Vikings|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11659891/herschel-walker-trade-25th-anniversary-run-birthed-dallas-cowboys-dynasty|title=Wulf: The run that birthed Dallas' dynasty|publisher=}}</ref><ref>http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4620671-nfl-10-worst-trades-ever-herschel-walker-leaf-williams/slide/275245</ref> From the moment he arrived in Minneapolis, \"Herschel Mania\" erupted. After a single 2\u00bd hour practice where he studied only 12 offensive plays, Walker had an incredible debut against the [[Green Bay Packers]]. He produced the best rushing game by a Viking back since [[1983 NFL season|1983]] and the first over-100 yard rushing performance by a Viking since [[1987 NFL season|1987]], gaining 148 yards on 18 carries.\n\nHe received three standing ovations from the record [[Metrodome]] crowd of 62,075, producing a Vikings win after four successive losses and 14 of the prior 18 matches with the Packers. However, his production thereafter declined. The problem was that the Vikings refused to make Walker the centerpiece of their offense and Walker couldn't use his custom tailored running scheme made by Dallas; which was power running between the tackles from the I-formation with a blocking fullback in front of him, to save the Vikings. Instead of looking at their own schemes, the team questioned his talent and commitment to [[American football|football]]. He joined the [[bobsled]] program of the [[United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation]], earning a berth in the [[1992 Winter Olympics]].

That year, he enjoyed his best season as a pro since [[1988 NFL season|1988]], rushing for 1,070 yards. In [[1994 NFL season|1994]] he became the first NFL player to have one-play gains of 90 or more yards rushing, receiving and kick-returning in a single season. He spent three seasons in Philadelphia, leaving after the Eagles signed free agent [[Ricky Watters]].\n\n====New York Giants====\nThe [[New York Giants]] signed Walker in [[1995 NFL season|1995]] to a three-year contract worth $4.8 million<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/19/sports/pro-football-giants-release-walker-shedding-third-veteran.html|title=PRO FOOTBALL;Giants Release Walker, Shedding Third Veteran|first=Timothy W.|last=Smith|date=June 19, 1996|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}</ref> as a third-down back, but soon discovered that Walker wasn't elusive enough for the role. He couldn't play [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] either, because of limited blocking skills. Walker led the Giants with 45 kick returns at 21.5 yards per return in 1995, his only season with the team.\n\n====Dallas Cowboys (second stint)====\nWalker finished his football career with the team that he started his NFL career with, the Cowboys. In [[1996 NFL season|1996]], he rejoined the team as a [[kickoff return]] specialist and third-down back. He also played fullback, but primarily as a ball-handler instead of a blocker out of I-Form and pro-sets. Walker retired at the end of the [[1997 NFL season|1997 season]].\n\n===Statistics===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| ! colspan=\"17\" style=\"background: #182770; border: 2px solid silver; color:white;\" |<center>'''NFL career stats'''</center>\n|-\n! |\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#e7e3e7;\" | Rushing\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#e7e3e7;\" | Receiving\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#e7e3e7;\" | Kick returns\n|-\n! |Year\n! |Team\n! |Att\n! |Yds\n! |Avg\n! |Lng\n! |TD\n! |No.\n! |Yds\n! |Avg\n! |Lng\n! |TD\n! |No.\n! |Yds\n! |Avg\n! |Lng\n! |TD\n|-\n| [[1986 NFL Season|1986]] || [[1986 Dallas Cowboys season|DAL]] || 151 || 737 || 4.9 || 84 || 12 || 76 || 837 || 11.0 || 84 || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| [[1987 NFL Season|1987]] || [[1987 Dallas Cowboys season|DAL]] || 209 || 891 || 4.3 || 60 || 7 || 60 || 715 || 11.9 || 44 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| [[1988 NFL Season|1988]] || [[1988 Dallas Cowboys season|DAL]] || 361 || 1,514 || 4.2 || 38 || 5 || 53 || 505 || 9.5 || 50 || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| rowspan=2|[[1989 NFL Season|1989]] || [[1989 Dallas Cowboys season|DAL]] || 81 || 246 || 3.0 || 20 || 2 || 22 || 261 || 11.9 || 52 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| [[1989 Minnesota Vikings season|MIN]] || 169 || 669 || 4.0 || 47 || 5 || 18 || 162 || 9.0 || 24 || 2 || 13 || 374 || 28.8 || 93 || 1\n|-\n| [[1990 NFL Season|1990]] || [[1990 Minnesota Vikings season|MIN]] || 184 || 770 || 4.2 || 58 || 5 || 35 || 315 || 9.0 || 52 || 4 || 44 || 966 || 22.0 || 64 || 0\n|-\n| [[1991 NFL Season|1991]] || [[1991 Minnesota Vikings season|MIN]] || 198 || 825 || 4.2 || 71 || 10 || 33 || 204 || 6.1 || 32 || 0 || 5 || 83 || 16.6 || 21 || 0\n|-\n| [[1992 NFL Season|1992]] || [[1992 Philadelphia Eagles season|PHI]] || 267 || 1,070 || 4.0 || 38 || 8 || 38 || 278 || 7.3 || 19 || 2 || 3 || 69 || 23.0 || 34 || 0\n|-\n| [[1993 NFL Season|1993]] || [[1993 Philadelphia Eagles season|PHI]] || 174 || 746 || 4.3 || 35 || 1 || 75 || 610 || 8.1 || 41 || 3 || 11 || 184 || 16.7 || 30 || 0\n|-\n| [[1994 NFL Season|1994]] || [[1994 Philadelphia Eagles season|PHI]] || 113 || 528 || 4.7 || 91 || 5 || 50 || 500 || 10.0 || 55 || 2 || 21 || 581 || 27.7 || 94 || 1\n|-\n| [[1995 NFL Season|1995]] || [[1995 New York Giants season|NYG]] || 31 || 126 || 4.1 || 36 || 0 || 31 || 234 || 7.5 || 93 || 1 || 41 || 881 || 21.5 || 67 || 0\n|-\n| [[1996 NFL Season|1996]] || [[1996 Dallas Cowboys season|DAL]] || 10 || 83 || 8.3 || 39 || 1 || 7 || 89 || 12.7 || 34 || 0 || 27 || 779 || 28.9 || 67 || 0\n|-\n| [[1997 NFL Season|1997]] || [[1997 Dallas Cowboys season|DAL]] || 6 || 20 || 3.3 || 11 || 0 || 14 || 149 || 10.6 || 64 || 2 || 50 || 1,167 || 23.3 || 49 || 0\n|-\n!

VHFs may be caused by five distinct families of [[RNA virus]]es: the families ''[[Arenaviridae]]'', ''[[Filoviridae]]'', ''[[Bunyaviridae]]'', ''[[Flaviviridae]]'', and ''[[Rhabdoviridae]]''. All types of VHF are characterized by fever and bleeding disorders and all can progress to high fever, shock and death in many cases. Some of the VHF agents cause relatively mild illnesses, such as the Scandinavian ''[[nephropathia epidemica]]'' (a [[hantavirus]]), while others, such as [[Ebola virus]], can cause severe, life-threatening disease.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nSigns and symptoms of VHFs include (by definition) fever and bleeding. Manifestations of VHF often also include flushing of the face and chest, small red or purple spots ([[petechiae]]), bleeding, swelling caused by [[edema]], low blood pressure ([[hypotension]]), and [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]. [[Malaise]], [[muscle pain]], headache, vomiting, and diarrhea occur frequently. The severity of symptoms varies with the type of virus. The \u201cVHF syndrome\u201d (capillary leak, bleeding diathesis, and circulatory compromise leading to shock) appears in a majority of people with [[filovirus]] hemorrhagic fevers (e.g., Ebola and [[Marburg virus|Marburg]] virus), [[Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever]] (CCHF), and the [[South American hemorrhagic fever]]s caused by [[arenavirus]]es, but only in a small minority of patients with [[dengue]], [[Rift Valley fever]], and [[Lassa fever]].\n\n==Causes==\nFive families of RNA viruses have been recognised as being able to cause hemorrhagic fevers.\n\n* The family ''[[Arenaviridae]]'' include the viruses responsible for [[Lassa fever]] ([[Lassa virus]]), [[Lujo virus]], [[Argentine hemorrhagic fever|Argentine]] ([[Junin virus]]), [[Bolivian hemorrhagic fever|Bolivian]] ([[Machupo virus]]), [[Brazilian hemorrhagic fever|Brazilian]] ([[Sabi\u00e1 virus]]), Chapare hemorrhagic fever ([[Chapare virus]]), [[Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever|Venezuelan]] ([[Guanarito virus]]) and [[Whitewater Arroyo virus]] hemorrhagic fevers.\n* The family ''[[Bunyaviridae]]'' include the causative agents of [[Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome]] (HV-HFRS), the [[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever]] (CCHF) virus from the genus ''[[Nairovirus]]'', [[Garissa virus]] and [[Ilesha virus]] from the ''[[Orthobunyavirus]]'' and the [[Rift Valley fever]] (RVF) virus from the genus ''[[Phlebovirus]]''.\n* The family ''[[Filoviridae]]'' include [[Ebola virus]] and [[Marburg virus]].\n* The family ''[[Flaviviridae]]'' include [[dengue]], [[yellow fever]], and two viruses in the [[tick-borne encephalitis]] group that cause VHF: [[Omsk hemorrhagic fever]] virus and [[Kyasanur Forest disease]] virus.\n* In September 2012 scientists writing in the journal [[PLOS Pathogens]] reported the isolation of a member of the ''[[Rhabdoviridae]]'' responsible for 2 fatal and 2 non-fatal cases of hemorrhagic fever in the Bas-Congo district of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The virus was named [[Bas-Congo virus]].

In most VHFs, it is likely that several mechanisms contribute to symptoms, including liver damage, [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC), and bone marrow dysfunction.  In DIC, small blood clots form in blood vessels throughout the body, removing platelets necessary for clotting from the bloodstream and reducing clotting ability.  DIC is thought to cause bleeding in Rift Valley, Marburg, and Ebola fevers. For filoviral hemorrhagic fevers, there are four general mechanisms of pathogenesis. The first mechanism is dissemination of virus due to suppressed responses by [[macrophages]] and [[dendritic cell]] (antigen presenting cells). The second mechanism is prevention of [[antigen]] specific immune response. The third mechanism is [[apoptosis]] of lymphocytes. The fourth mechanism is when infected macrophages interact with toxic [[cytokines]], leading to [[diapedesis]] and coagulation deficiency. From the vascular perspective, the virus will infect macrophages, leading to the reorganization of the [[VE-cadherin]] catenin complex (a protein important in cell adhesion). This reorganization creates intercellular gaps in endothelial cells. The gaps lead to increased endothelial permeability and allow blood to escape from the vascular circulatory system.\n\nThe reasons for variation among patients infected with the same virus are unknown but stem from a complex system of virus-host interactions.  Dengue fever becomes more virulent during a second infection by means of [[antibody dependent enhancement]].  After the first infection, [[macrophage]]s display antibodies on their cell membranes specific to the dengue virus.  By attaching to these antibodies, dengue viruses from a second infection are better able to infect the macrophages, thus reducing the immune system's ability to fight off infection.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nDefinitive diagnosis is usually made at a reference laboratory with advanced [[biocontainment]] capabilities.  The findings of laboratory investigation vary somewhat between the viruses but in general there is a decrease in the total white cell count (particularly the [[lymphocyte]]s), a decrease in the [[platelet]] count, an increase in the blood serum [[liver enzyme]]s, and reduced blood clotting ability measured as an increase in both the [[prothrombin time|prothrombin]] (PT) and activated [[partial thromboplastin time]]s (PTT). The  [[hematocrit]] may be elevated. The serum urea and creatine may be raised but this is dependent on the hydration status of the patient. The [[bleeding time]] tends to be prolonged.\n\n==Prevention==\n{{Main|Prevention of viral hemorrhagic fever}}\nWith the exception of [[yellow fever vaccine]] neither vaccines nor experimental vaccines are readily available. Prophylactic (preventive) ribavirin may be effective for some bunyavirus and arenavirus infections (available only as an [[investigational new drug]] (IND)).\n\nVHF isolation guidelines dictate that all VHF patients (with the exception of dengue patients) should be cared for using strict contact precautions, including hand hygiene, double gloves, gowns, shoe and leg coverings, and faceshield or goggles.  Lassa, CCHF, Ebola, and Marburg viruses may be particularly prone to [[nosocomial]] (hospital-based) spread. Airborne precautions should be utilized including, at a minimum, a [[Respirator fit test|fit-tested]], HEPA filter-equipped respirator (such as an [[N-95 mask]]), a battery-powered, air-purifying respirator, or a positive pressure supplied air respirator to be worn by personnel coming within 1,8 meter (six feet) of a VHF patient. Groups of patients should be cohorted (sequestered) to a separate building or a ward with an isolated air-handling system. Environmental decontamination is typically accomplished with hypochlorite (e.g. bleach) or [[Disinfectant#Phenolics|phenolic disinfectants]].<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Woods |editor-first=Lt Col Jon B. |url=http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%206th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202006.pdf |title=USAMRIID's Medical Management of Biological Casualties Handbook |edition=6th |publisher=[[USAMRIID|U.S. Army Medical Institute of Infectious Diseases]] |location=Fort Detrick MA |year=2005 |pages=143\u201344 |ref=harv |access-date=2007-06-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609104204/http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%206th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202006.pdf |archive-date=2007-06-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Management==\nMedical management of VHF patients may require intensive supportive care.

The second mechanism is prevention of [[antigen]] specific immune response. The third mechanism is [[apoptosis]] of lymphocytes. The fourth mechanism is when infected macrophages interact with toxic [[cytokines]], leading to [[diapedesis]] and coagulation deficiency. From the vascular perspective, the virus will infect macrophages, leading to the reorganization of the [[VE-cadherin]] catenin complex (a protein important in cell adhesion). This reorganization creates intercellular gaps in endothelial cells. The gaps lead to increased endothelial permeability and allow blood to escape from the vascular circulatory system.\n\nThe reasons for variation among patients infected with the same virus are unknown but stem from a complex system of virus-host interactions.  Dengue fever becomes more virulent during a second infection by means of [[antibody dependent enhancement]].  After the first infection, [[macrophage]]s display antibodies on their cell membranes specific to the dengue virus.  By attaching to these antibodies, dengue viruses from a second infection are better able to infect the macrophages, thus reducing the immune system's ability to fight off infection.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nDefinitive diagnosis is usually made at a reference laboratory with advanced [[biocontainment]] capabilities.  The findings of laboratory investigation vary somewhat between the viruses but in general there is a decrease in the total white cell count (particularly the [[lymphocyte]]s), a decrease in the [[platelet]] count, an increase in the blood serum [[liver enzyme]]s, and reduced blood clotting ability measured as an increase in both the [[prothrombin time|prothrombin]] (PT) and activated [[partial thromboplastin time]]s (PTT). The  [[hematocrit]] may be elevated. The serum urea and creatine may be raised but this is dependent on the hydration status of the patient. The [[bleeding time]] tends to be prolonged.\n\n==Prevention==\n{{Main|Prevention of viral hemorrhagic fever}}\nWith the exception of [[yellow fever vaccine]] neither vaccines nor experimental vaccines are readily available. Prophylactic (preventive) ribavirin may be effective for some bunyavirus and arenavirus infections (available only as an [[investigational new drug]] (IND)).\n\nVHF isolation guidelines dictate that all VHF patients (with the exception of dengue patients) should be cared for using strict contact precautions, including hand hygiene, double gloves, gowns, shoe and leg coverings, and faceshield or goggles.  Lassa, CCHF, Ebola, and Marburg viruses may be particularly prone to [[nosocomial]] (hospital-based) spread. Airborne precautions should be utilized including, at a minimum, a [[Respirator fit test|fit-tested]], HEPA filter-equipped respirator (such as an [[N-95 mask]]), a battery-powered, air-purifying respirator, or a positive pressure supplied air respirator to be worn by personnel coming within 1,8 meter (six feet) of a VHF patient. Groups of patients should be cohorted (sequestered) to a separate building or a ward with an isolated air-handling system. Environmental decontamination is typically accomplished with hypochlorite (e.g. bleach) or [[Disinfectant#Phenolics|phenolic disinfectants]].<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Woods |editor-first=Lt Col Jon B. |url=http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%206th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202006.pdf |title=USAMRIID's Medical Management of Biological Casualties Handbook |edition=6th |publisher=[[USAMRIID|U.S. Army Medical Institute of Infectious Diseases]] |location=Fort Detrick MA |year=2005 |pages=143\u201344 |ref=harv |access-date=2007-06-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609104204/http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%206th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202006.pdf |archive-date=2007-06-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Management==\nMedical management of VHF patients may require intensive supportive care.

The study found that children with chronic parasomnias may often also present SDB or, to a lesser extent, RLS. Furthermore, the disappearance of the parasomnias after the treatment of the SDB or RLS periodic limb movement syndrome suggests that the latter may trigger the former. The high frequency of SDB in family members of children with parasomnia provided additional evidence that SDB may manifest as parasomnias in children. Children with parasomnias are not systematically monitored during sleep, although past studies have suggested that patients with sleep terrors or sleepwalking have an elevated level of brief EEG arousals. When children receive [[polysomnographies]], discrete patterns (e.g., nasal flow limitation, abnormal respiratory effort, bursts of high or slow EEG frequencies) should be sought; [[apnea]]s are rarely found in children. Children's respiration during sleep should be monitored with nasal cannula or pressure transducer system or esophageal manometry, which are more sensitive than the thermistors or thermocouples currently used in many laboratories. The clear, prompt improvement of severe parasomnia in children who are treated for SDB, as defined here, provides important evidence that subtle SDB can have substantial health-related significance. Also noteworthy is the report of familial presence of parasomnia. Studies of twin cohorts and families with sleep terror and sleepwalking suggest genetic involvement of parasomnias. RLS and SDB have been shown to have familial recurrence. RLS has been shown to have genetic involvement.\n\nSleepwalking may also accompany the related phenomenon of [[Night terror|night terrors]], especially in children. In the midst of a night terror, the affected person may wander in a distressed state while still asleep, and examples of sufferers attempting to run or aggressively defend themselves during these incidents have been reported in medical literature.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-terrors/symptoms-causes/syc-20353524|title=Sleep terrors (night terrors) - Symptoms and causes|website=Mayo Clinic|language=en|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases, sleepwalking in adults may be a symptom of a psychological disorder.

During an alcohol-induced [[blackout (drug-related amnesia)]], a person is able to actively engage and respond to their environment (e.g. having conversations or driving a vehicle), however the brain does not create memories for the events.<ref name=\"Wetherill 2016\">{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/acer.13051|pmid = 27060868|pmc = 4844761|title = Alcohol-Induced Blackouts: A Review of Recent Clinical Research with Practical Implications and Recommendations for Future Studies|year = 2016|last1 = Wetherill|first1 = Reagan R.|last2 = Fromme|first2 = Kim|journal = Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research|volume = 40|issue = 5|pages = 922\u2013935}}</ref> Alcohol-induced blackouts can occur with blood alcohol levels higher than 0.06g/dl.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.15288/jsa.2003.64.547|pmid = 12921196|title = Fragmentary and en bloc blackouts: Similarity and distinction among episodes of alcohol-induced memory loss|year = 2003|last1 = Hartzler|first1 = Bryan|last2 = Fromme|first2 = Kim|journal = Journal of Studies on Alcohol|volume = 64|issue = 4|pages = 547\u2013550}}</ref> A systematic review of the literature found that approximately 50% of drinkers have experienced memory loss during a drinking episode and have had associated negative consequences similar to sleepwalkers, including injury and death.<ref name=\"Wetherill 2016\"/>\n\nOther differential diagnoses include [[Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder]], confusional arousals, and [[night terrors]].\n\nThere are two subcategories of sleepwalking:\n* sleepwalking with sleep-related eating.\n* sleepwalking with sleep-related sexual behavior ([[Sleep sex|sexsomnia]]).<ref name=\"DSM-V\" />\n\nSleep eating involves consuming food while asleep. These sleep eating disorders are more often than not induced for stress related reasons. Another major cause of this sleep eating subtype of sleepwalking is sleep medication, such as Ambien for example (Mayo Clinic). There are a few others, but Ambien is a more widely used sleep aid.<ref>{{cite web|last=Staff|first=Mayo Clinic|title=Sleep-related Eating Disorders|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-related-eating-disorder/basics/definition/con-20037290|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref> Because many sleep eaters prepare the food they consume, there are risks involving burns and such with ovens and other appliances. As expected, weight gain is also a common outcome of this disorder, because food that is frequently consumed contains high carbohydrates. As with sleepwalking, there are ways that sleep eating disorders can be maintained. There are some medications that calm the sleeper so they can get longer and better-quality rest, but activities such as yoga can also be introduced to reduce the stress and anxiety causing the action.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clinic|first=Cleveland|title=Sleep-Related Eating Disorders|url=http://my.clevelandclinic.org/neurological_institute/sleep-disorders-center/disorders-conditions/hic-sleep-related-eating-disorders.aspx|publisher=Cleveland Clinic|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Assessment ===\nAn assessment of sleepwalking via [[polysomnography]] poses the problem that sleepwalking is less likely to occur in the sleep laboratory, and if an episode occurs, it is usually less complex than what the patient experiences at home. <ref>Blatt, I., Peled, R., Gadoth, N., & Lavie, P.

He believed that sleepwalking was connected to fulfilling sexual wishes and was surprised that a person could move without interrupting their dream. At that time, Freud suggested that the essence of this phenomenon was the desire to go to sleep in the same area as the individual had slept in childhood. Ten years later, he speculated about somnambulism in the article \"A Metapsychological Supplement to the Theory of Dreams\" (1916\u201317 [1915]). In this essay, he started to clarify and expand his hypothetical ideas on dreams. The dreams is a fragile equilibrium that is only partially successful because the repressed unconscious impulses of the unconscious system. This does not obey the wishes of the ego and maintain their countercathexis. Another reason why dreams are partially successful is because certain preconscious daytime thoughts can be resistant and these can retain a part of their cathexis as well. It is probable how unconscious impulses and day residues can come together and result in a conflict. Freud then wondered about the outcome of this wishful impulse, which represents an unconscious instinctual demand and then it becomes a dream wish in the preconscious. Furthermore, Freud stated that this unconscious impulse could be expressed as mobility during sleep. This would be what is observed in somnambulism, though what actually makes it possible remains unknown.<ref name= \"Somnambulism\" >{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/somnambulism|title= Somnambulism|publisher= International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis|year= 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Society and culture==\n===Opera===\n[[File:Sonnambula atto 3.jpg|thumb|230px|Amina, the somnabuliste, at the mill.]]\n[[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s 1831 Italian [[opera semiseria]], [[La sonnambula]], [[La sonnambula#Synopsis|the plot of which]] is centered on the question of the innocence of the betrothed and soon-to-be married Amina; who, upon having been discovered in the bedchamber of a stranger, and despite the assurances of that stranger that Amina was entirely innocent, has been rejected by her enraged fianc\u00e9, Elvino \u2014 who, then, decides to marry another. In fact, when stressed, Amina was susceptible to somnambulism; and had come to be in the stranger's bedchamber by sleep-walking along a high parapet (in full view of the opera's audience). Elvino, who later observes the (exhausted by all the fuss) Amina, sleep-walking across a very high, very unstable, and very rickety bridge at the local mill, realizes his mistake, abandons his plans of marriage to the other woman, and re-unites with Amina.\n\n====Jenny Lind and James Braid====\nIn August 1847, the famous soprano [[Jenny Lind]] visited [[Manchester]], and gave two performances as Amina.

They are often disoriented, consequent to awakening: the sleepwalker may be confused and perplexed, and might not know why or how they got out of bed; however, the disorientation will fade within minutes.  They may talk while sleepwalking, but the talk typically does not make sense to the observer.  There are varying degrees of amnesia associated with sleepwalking, ranging from no memory at all, vague memories or a narrative.<ref name=\"Schenck, Carlos H 2007\">Schenck, Carlos H.

The study found that children with chronic parasomnias may often also present SDB or, to a lesser extent, RLS. Furthermore, the disappearance of the parasomnias after the treatment of the SDB or RLS periodic limb movement syndrome suggests that the latter may trigger the former. The high frequency of SDB in family members of children with parasomnia provided additional evidence that SDB may manifest as parasomnias in children. Children with parasomnias are not systematically monitored during sleep, although past studies have suggested that patients with sleep terrors or sleepwalking have an elevated level of brief EEG arousals. When children receive [[polysomnographies]], discrete patterns (e.g., nasal flow limitation, abnormal respiratory effort, bursts of high or slow EEG frequencies) should be sought; [[apnea]]s are rarely found in children. Children's respiration during sleep should be monitored with nasal cannula or pressure transducer system or esophageal manometry, which are more sensitive than the thermistors or thermocouples currently used in many laboratories. The clear, prompt improvement of severe parasomnia in children who are treated for SDB, as defined here, provides important evidence that subtle SDB can have substantial health-related significance. Also noteworthy is the report of familial presence of parasomnia. Studies of twin cohorts and families with sleep terror and sleepwalking suggest genetic involvement of parasomnias. RLS and SDB have been shown to have familial recurrence. RLS has been shown to have genetic involvement.\n\nSleepwalking may also accompany the related phenomenon of [[Night terror|night terrors]], especially in children. In the midst of a night terror, the affected person may wander in a distressed state while still asleep, and examples of sufferers attempting to run or aggressively defend themselves during these incidents have been reported in medical literature.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-terrors/symptoms-causes/syc-20353524|title=Sleep terrors (night terrors) - Symptoms and causes|website=Mayo Clinic|language=en|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases, sleepwalking in adults may be a symptom of a psychological disorder.

During an alcohol-induced [[blackout (drug-related amnesia)]], a person is able to actively engage and respond to their environment (e.g. having conversations or driving a vehicle), however the brain does not create memories for the events.<ref name=\"Wetherill 2016\">{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/acer.13051|pmid = 27060868|pmc = 4844761|title = Alcohol-Induced Blackouts: A Review of Recent Clinical Research with Practical Implications and Recommendations for Future Studies|year = 2016|last1 = Wetherill|first1 = Reagan R.|last2 = Fromme|first2 = Kim|journal = Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research|volume = 40|issue = 5|pages = 922\u2013935}}</ref> Alcohol-induced blackouts can occur with blood alcohol levels higher than 0.06g/dl.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.15288/jsa.2003.64.547|pmid = 12921196|title = Fragmentary and en bloc blackouts: Similarity and distinction among episodes of alcohol-induced memory loss|year = 2003|last1 = Hartzler|first1 = Bryan|last2 = Fromme|first2 = Kim|journal = Journal of Studies on Alcohol|volume = 64|issue = 4|pages = 547\u2013550}}</ref> A systematic review of the literature found that approximately 50% of drinkers have experienced memory loss during a drinking episode and have had associated negative consequences similar to sleepwalkers, including injury and death.<ref name=\"Wetherill 2016\"/>\n\nOther differential diagnoses include [[Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder]], confusional arousals, and [[night terrors]].\n\nThere are two subcategories of sleepwalking:\n* sleepwalking with sleep-related eating.\n* sleepwalking with sleep-related sexual behavior ([[Sleep sex|sexsomnia]]).<ref name=\"DSM-V\" />\n\nSleep eating involves consuming food while asleep. These sleep eating disorders are more often than not induced for stress related reasons. Another major cause of this sleep eating subtype of sleepwalking is sleep medication, such as Ambien for example (Mayo Clinic). There are a few others, but Ambien is a more widely used sleep aid.<ref>{{cite web|last=Staff|first=Mayo Clinic|title=Sleep-related Eating Disorders|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-related-eating-disorder/basics/definition/con-20037290|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref> Because many sleep eaters prepare the food they consume, there are risks involving burns and such with ovens and other appliances. As expected, weight gain is also a common outcome of this disorder, because food that is frequently consumed contains high carbohydrates. As with sleepwalking, there are ways that sleep eating disorders can be maintained. There are some medications that calm the sleeper so they can get longer and better-quality rest, but activities such as yoga can also be introduced to reduce the stress and anxiety causing the action.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clinic|first=Cleveland|title=Sleep-Related Eating Disorders|url=http://my.clevelandclinic.org/neurological_institute/sleep-disorders-center/disorders-conditions/hic-sleep-related-eating-disorders.aspx|publisher=Cleveland Clinic|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Assessment ===\nAn assessment of sleepwalking via [[polysomnography]] poses the problem that sleepwalking is less likely to occur in the sleep laboratory, and if an episode occurs, it is usually less complex than what the patient experiences at home. <ref>Blatt, I., Peled, R., Gadoth, N., & Lavie, P.

If there are weapons, they should be locked away with keys secluded from the sleepwalker.<ref name=\"Schenck, Carlos H 2007\"/>\n\nFor partners of sleepwalkers who are violent or disturb their sleep, sleeping in another room may lead to better sleep quality and quantity.\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe lifetime prevalence of sleepwalking is estimated to be 4.6%\u201310.3%.  A meta-analysis of 51 studies, that included more than 100,000 children and adults, found that sleepwalking is more common in children with an estimated 5%, compared with 1.5% of adults, sleepwalking at least once in the previous 12 months.

He believed that sleepwalking was connected to fulfilling sexual wishes and was surprised that a person could move without interrupting their dream. At that time, Freud suggested that the essence of this phenomenon was the desire to go to sleep in the same area as the individual had slept in childhood. Ten years later, he speculated about somnambulism in the article \"A Metapsychological Supplement to the Theory of Dreams\" (1916\u201317 [1915]). In this essay, he started to clarify and expand his hypothetical ideas on dreams. The dreams is a fragile equilibrium that is only partially successful because the repressed unconscious impulses of the unconscious system. This does not obey the wishes of the ego and maintain their countercathexis. Another reason why dreams are partially successful is because certain preconscious daytime thoughts can be resistant and these can retain a part of their cathexis as well. It is probable how unconscious impulses and day residues can come together and result in a conflict. Freud then wondered about the outcome of this wishful impulse, which represents an unconscious instinctual demand and then it becomes a dream wish in the preconscious. Furthermore, Freud stated that this unconscious impulse could be expressed as mobility during sleep. This would be what is observed in somnambulism, though what actually makes it possible remains unknown.<ref name= \"Somnambulism\" >{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/somnambulism|title= Somnambulism|publisher= International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis|year= 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Society and culture==\n===Opera===\n[[File:Sonnambula atto 3.jpg|thumb|230px|Amina, the somnabuliste, at the mill.]]\n[[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s 1831 Italian [[opera semiseria]], [[La sonnambula]], [[La sonnambula#Synopsis|the plot of which]] is centered on the question of the innocence of the betrothed and soon-to-be married Amina; who, upon having been discovered in the bedchamber of a stranger, and despite the assurances of that stranger that Amina was entirely innocent, has been rejected by her enraged fianc\u00e9, Elvino \u2014 who, then, decides to marry another. In fact, when stressed, Amina was susceptible to somnambulism; and had come to be in the stranger's bedchamber by sleep-walking along a high parapet (in full view of the opera's audience). Elvino, who later observes the (exhausted by all the fuss) Amina, sleep-walking across a very high, very unstable, and very rickety bridge at the local mill, realizes his mistake, abandons his plans of marriage to the other woman, and re-unites with Amina.\n\n====Jenny Lind and James Braid====\nIn August 1847, the famous soprano [[Jenny Lind]] visited [[Manchester]], and gave two performances as Amina. The outstanding difference between Lind and her contemporaries was that, \"whilst the beauty of her voice was far greater than any other in living memory (thus, the ''Swedish Nightingale''), what really set her apart was her outstanding ability to act\"; and, moreover, in performing as Amina, rather than walking along a wide and well-protected walkway (as the others did), she routinely acrobatically balanced her way along narrow planks.<ref>[http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/fapi/datastream/unsworks:11299/SOURCE01?view=true Yeates, L.B., ''James Braid: Surgeon, Gentleman Scientist, and Hypnotist'', Ph.D. Dissertation, School of History and Philosophy of Science, Faculty of Arts & Social Sciences, University of New South Wales, January 2013.] Yeates (2013), p.788.</ref>\n\nWhile she was in Manchester\u2014on the basis that, at the time, many characterized \"''hypnotism''\" as \"''artificial somnambulism''\",<ref>For example, [https://archive.org/details/b21306692/page/410 Pritchard J.C., ''A Treatise on Insanity and Other Disorders Affecting the Mind'', Sherwood, Gilbert and Piper, (London), 1835, p.p.410.]</ref> and that, from a rather different perspective, her stage performance could also be described as one of \"artificial\" (rather than spontaneous) somnambulism\u2014her friends arranged for her to visit the local surgeon [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]], who had discovered hypnotism in 1841:<ref>\"Jenny Lind at the Manufacturing Establishments\", ''Manchester Guardian'', No.1947, (Saturday, 4 September 1847), p.7, col.C; \"Jenny Lind and the Hypnotic Somnambulist\", ''Manchester Guardian'', No.1948, (Wednesday, 8 September 1847), p.5, col.F; \"Jenny Lind and the Manchester Somnambulists\", ''Newcastle Courant'', No.9015, (Saturday, 17 September 1847), p.2, col.E; \"Jenny Lind and Hypnotism\", ''The Medical Times'', Vol.16, No.416, (18 September 1847), p.602; and \"Jenny Lind and Mesmerism\", ''The Lady's Newspaper'', No.39, (Saturday, 25 September 1847) p.294, col.A.</ref><ref>Storer, H., \"Jenny Lind and the Somnambulist\", ''The Critic: A Journal for Readers, Authors, and Publishers'', Vol.6, No.145, (9 October 1847), p.238; Braid, J., \"(Letter to Dr. Storer, written on 28 September 1847)\", ''The Critic: A Journal for Readers, Authors, and Publishers'', Vol.6, No.145, (9 October 1847), p.238.</ref>\n::\"Mr. Braid, surgeon, whose discoveries in hypnotism are well known, having invited the fair impersonator of a somnambulist to witness some of the abnormal feats of a real somnambulist, artificially thrown into that state, it was arranged that a private s\u00e9ance should take place [on Friday, 3 September 1847].\" ''Manchester Guardian'', 8 September 1847.\n\n===Drama===\n* The sleepwalking scene (Act V Scene 1) from [[William Shakespeare]]'s tragic play ''[[Macbeth]]'' (1606) is one of the most famous scenes in all of literature.\n* In [[Walley Chamberlain Oulton|Oulton's]] two act farce [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=xRFXAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The Sleep-Walker; or, Which is the Lady'' (1812)], \"Somno\", a histrionic failed-actor-turned-manservant relives his wished-for roles when sleepwalking.\n\n===Literature===\n* In [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel ''[[Dracula]]'' the character [[Lucy Westenra]] is described as a sleepwalker.
