Designed to [[Displacement (ship)|displace]] {{convert|5040|LT|t}}, all of the ''Orlando''-class ships proved to be overweight and displaced approximately {{convert|5535|LT|t}}. The ship was powered by a pair of three-cylinder [[triple-expansion steam engine]]s, each driving one shaft, which were designed to produce a total of {{convert|8500|ihp|lk=in}} and a maximum speed of {{convert|18|kn|lk=in}} using steam provided by four [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s with [[forced draught]]. During her sea trials, ''Australia'' reached {{convert|18.8|kn}}. The ship carried a maximum of {{convert|900|LT|t}} of coal which was designed to give her a range of {{convert|8000|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. The ship's complement was 484 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=ck5>Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 65</ref>\n\n''Australia''{{'}}s main armament consisted of two [[List of British ordnance terms#BL|breech-loading]] (BL) [[BL 9.2 inch gun Mk III - VII|{{convert|9.2|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} Mk V guns]], one gun fore and aft of the superstructure on [[pivot gun|pivot mounts]]. Her secondary armament was ten [[BL 6 inch gun Mk III IV VI|BL {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns]], five on each [[broadside]]. Protection against torpedo boats was provided by six [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF)]] [[QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss|6-pounder Hotchkiss]] guns and ten [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss]] guns, most of which were mounted on the main [[deck (ship)|deck]] in broadside positions. The ship was also armed with six 18-inch (457&nbsp;mm) [[torpedo tube]]s: four on the broadside above water and one each in the bow and stern below water.<ref name=ck5/>\n\nThe ship was protected by a [[waterline]] [[compound armour]] [[Belt armor|belt]] {{convert|10|in|0}} thick. It covered the middle {{convert|200|ft|m|1}} of the ship and was {{convert|5|ft|6|in|1}} high.<ref name=ck5/> Because the ship was overweight, the top of the armour belt was {{convert|2|ft}} below the waterline when she was fully loaded.<ref>Friedman, p. 146</ref> The ends of the armour belt were closed off by transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s {{convert|16|in|0}}.

Among the top 100 words in the English language, which make up more than 50% of all written English, the average word has more than 15 senses,<ref>[[Most common words in English]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kamu.si/polysemy_top_100|title=Polysemy in top 100 Oxford English Corpus words within Wiktionary|last=Benjamin|first=Martin|date=2019|website=Teach You Backwards|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=December 26, 2019}}</ref> which makes the odds of a correct translation about 15 to 1 if each sense maps to a different word in the target language. Most common English words have at least two senses, which produces 50/50 odds in the likely case that the target language uses different words for those different senses. The odds are similar from other languages to English. Google Translate makes statistical guesses that raise the likelihood of producing the most frequent sense of a word, with the consequence that an accurate translation will be unobtainable in cases that do not match the majority or plurality [[text corpus|corpus]] occurrence. The accuracy of single-word predictions has not been measured for any language. Because almost all non-English language pairs pivot through English, the odds against obtaining accurate single-word translations from one non-English language to another can be estimated by multiplying the number of senses in the source language with the number of senses each of those terms have in English. When Google Translate does not have a word in its vocabulary, it makes up a result as part of its algorithm.<ref name=\"Ooga Booga\" />\n\n== Limitations ==\nGoogle Translate, like other automatic translation tools, has its limitations. The service limits the number of paragraphs and the range of technical terms that can be translated, and while it can help the reader understand the general content of a foreign language text, it does not always deliver accurate translations, and most times it tends to repeat verbatim the same word it's expected to translate. Grammatically, for example, Google Translate struggles to differentiate between ''imperfect'' and ''perfect'' [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]s in Romance languages so habitual and continuous acts in the past often become single ''historical'' events. Although seemingly pedantic, this can often lead to incorrect results (to a native speaker of for example French and Spanish) which would have been avoided by a human translator. Knowledge of the ''[[subjunctive mood]]'' is virtually non-existent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ifiwerejudgingu/status/334830611929919488|title=Subjunctive Mood|website=Twitter|date=May 15, 2013}}</ref> Moreover, the formal second person (''vous'') is often chosen, whatever the context or accepted usage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/1rw4iq/google_translate_doesnt_really_understand_tu_and/|title=Google Translate doesn't really understand 'tu' and 'vous'. Particularly \"tu\".|website=Reddit|date=December 2, 2013}}</ref> Since its English reference material contains only \"you\" forms, it has difficulty translating a language with \"you all\" or formal \"you\" variations.\n\nDue to differences between languages in investment, research, and the extent of digital resources, the accuracy of Google Translate varies greatly among languages.<ref name=\":7\" /> Some languages produce better results than others. Most languages from Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, tend to score poorly in relation to the scores of many well-financed European languages, with Afrikaans and Chinese being the high-scoring exceptions from their continents.<ref name=\"Kamu.si\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Freitas|first=Connor|last2=Liu|first2=Yudong|date=December 15, 2017|title=Exploring the Differences between Human and Machine Translation|url=https://cedar.wwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1060&context=wwu_honors|journal=Western Washington University|volume=|pages=5|via=}}</ref> No languages indigenous to Australia or the Americas are included within Google Translate. Higher scores for European can be partially attributed to the [[Europarl Corpus]], a trove of documents from the [[European Parliament]] that have been professionally translated by the mandate of the [[European Union]] into as many as 21 languages.

While edits of translations may be submitted, in Chinese specifically one cannot edit sentences as a whole. Instead, one must edit sometimes arbitrary sets of characters, leading to incorrect edits.<ref name=\"tr1\" /> A good example is Russian-to-English. Formerly one would use Google Translate to make a draft and then use a dictionary and common sense to correct the numerous mistakes. As of early 2018 Translate is sufficiently accurate to make the Russian Wikipedia accessible to those who can read English. The quality of Translate can be checked by adding it as an extension to Chrome or Firefox and applying it to the left language links of any Wikipedia article. It can be used as a dictionary by typing in words. One can translate from a book by using a scanner and an OCR like Google Drive, but this takes about five minutes per page.\n\nIn its Written Words Translation function, there is a word limit on the amount of text that can be translated at once.<ref name=\":52\" /> Therefore, long text should be transferred to a document form and translated through its Document Translate function.<ref name=\":52\" />\n\nMoreover, like all machine translation programs, Google Translate struggles with [[polysemy]] (the multiple meanings a word may have)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teachyoubackwards.com/mt-mathematics/#polysemy|title=The Astounding Mathematics of Machine Translation - Polysemy|last=Benjamin|first=Martin|date=2019|website=Teach You Backwards|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=December 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /> and [[multiword expression]]s (terms that have meanings that cannot be understood or translated by analyzing the individual word units that compose them).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teachyoubackwards.com/mt-mathematics/#party-terms|title=The Astounding Mathematics of Machine Translation - Party Terms|last=Benjamin|first=Martin|date=2019|website=Teach You Backwards|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=December 26, 2019}}</ref> A word in a foreign language might have two different meanings in the translated language.

Among the top 100 words in the English language, which make up more than 50% of all written English, the average word has more than 15 senses,<ref>[[Most common words in English]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kamu.si/polysemy_top_100|title=Polysemy in top 100 Oxford English Corpus words within Wiktionary|last=Benjamin|first=Martin|date=2019|website=Teach You Backwards|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=December 26, 2019}}</ref> which makes the odds of a correct translation about 15 to 1 if each sense maps to a different word in the target language. Most common English words have at least two senses, which produces 50/50 odds in the likely case that the target language uses different words for those different senses. The odds are similar from other languages to English. Google Translate makes statistical guesses that raise the likelihood of producing the most frequent sense of a word, with the consequence that an accurate translation will be unobtainable in cases that do not match the majority or plurality [[text corpus|corpus]] occurrence. The accuracy of single-word predictions has not been measured for any language. Because almost all non-English language pairs pivot through English, the odds against obtaining accurate single-word translations from one non-English language to another can be estimated by multiplying the number of senses in the source language with the number of senses each of those terms have in English. When Google Translate does not have a word in its vocabulary, it makes up a result as part of its algorithm.<ref name=\"Ooga Booga\" />\n\n== Limitations ==\nGoogle Translate, like other automatic translation tools, has its limitations. The service limits the number of paragraphs and the range of technical terms that can be translated, and while it can help the reader understand the general content of a foreign language text, it does not always deliver accurate translations, and most times it tends to repeat verbatim the same word it's expected to translate. Grammatically, for example, Google Translate struggles to differentiate between ''imperfect'' and ''perfect'' [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]s in Romance languages so habitual and continuous acts in the past often become single ''historical'' events. Although seemingly pedantic, this can often lead to incorrect results (to a native speaker of for example French and Spanish) which would have been avoided by a human translator. Knowledge of the ''[[subjunctive mood]]'' is virtually non-existent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ifiwerejudgingu/status/334830611929919488|title=Subjunctive Mood|website=Twitter|date=May 15, 2013}}</ref> Moreover, the formal second person (''vous'') is often chosen, whatever the context or accepted usage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/1rw4iq/google_translate_doesnt_really_understand_tu_and/|title=Google Translate doesn't really understand 'tu' and 'vous'. Particularly \"tu\".|website=Reddit|date=December 2, 2013}}</ref> Since its English reference material contains only \"you\" forms, it has difficulty translating a language with \"you all\" or formal \"you\" variations.\n\nDue to differences between languages in investment, research, and the extent of digital resources, the accuracy of Google Translate varies greatly among languages.<ref name=\":7\" /> Some languages produce better results than others. Most languages from Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, tend to score poorly in relation to the scores of many well-financed European languages, with Afrikaans and Chinese being the high-scoring exceptions from their continents.<ref name=\"Kamu.si\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Freitas|first=Connor|last2=Liu|first2=Yudong|date=December 15, 2017|title=Exploring the Differences between Human and Machine Translation|url=https://cedar.wwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1060&context=wwu_honors|journal=Western Washington University|volume=|pages=5|via=}}</ref> No languages indigenous to Australia or the Americas are included within Google Translate.

While edits of translations may be submitted, in Chinese specifically one cannot edit sentences as a whole. Instead, one must edit sometimes arbitrary sets of characters, leading to incorrect edits.<ref name=\"tr1\" /> A good example is Russian-to-English. Formerly one would use Google Translate to make a draft and then use a dictionary and common sense to correct the numerous mistakes. As of early 2018 Translate is sufficiently accurate to make the Russian Wikipedia accessible to those who can read English. The quality of Translate can be checked by adding it as an extension to Chrome or Firefox and applying it to the left language links of any Wikipedia article. It can be used as a dictionary by typing in words. One can translate from a book by using a scanner and an OCR like Google Drive, but this takes about five minutes per page.\n\nIn its Written Words Translation function, there is a word limit on the amount of text that can be translated at once.<ref name=\":52\" /> Therefore, long text should be transferred to a document form and translated through its Document Translate function.<ref name=\":52\" />\n\nMoreover, like all machine translation programs, Google Translate struggles with [[polysemy]] (the multiple meanings a word may have)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teachyoubackwards.com/mt-mathematics/#polysemy|title=The Astounding Mathematics of Machine Translation - Polysemy|last=Benjamin|first=Martin|date=2019|website=Teach You Backwards|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=December 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /> and [[multiword expression]]s (terms that have meanings that cannot be understood or translated by analyzing the individual word units that compose them).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teachyoubackwards.com/mt-mathematics/#party-terms|title=The Astounding Mathematics of Machine Translation - Party Terms|last=Benjamin|first=Martin|date=2019|website=Teach You Backwards|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=December 26, 2019}}</ref> A word in a foreign language might have two different meanings in the translated language.

They were replaced by stone houses in the 17th and 18th&nbsp;centuries and housed workers in the [[woollen]] industry that developed at this time. As the industry thrived, some houses built by yeoman farmers were substantial such as Lower Old Hall (dated 1634) and Fallingworth Hall (dated 1642). Norland Hall, lower down on the hillside near Milner Royd, was typical of an older timber-framed building encased in stone in the late 17th&nbsp;century. In 1911 it was struck by lightning and dismantled in 1914. The American newspaper magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]] bought the stones in 1922 with the intention of re-building the hall in the USA. However, his plan came to nothing and eventually material was incorporated into a chapel in [[San Simeon]], California, in 1968.<ref>{{cite book|last=Giles|first=Colum|title=Rural Houses of West Yorkshire|year=1986|publisher=HMSO|pages=207\u2013209}}</ref>\n\nThe village church, St Luke's, opened in 1866.

It has since been extended in 1894 and 2003.\n\nThe [[war memorial]] was erected in 1920 and the park around it created four years later on the site of the village [[pinfold]]. In 2000 a millennium sundial was added and a [[time capsule]] buried by the children of Norland School.<ref>{{cite book|last=Watson|first=John (Revd.)|title=The History of the parish of Halifax|year=1775}}</ref>\n\n== Norland Moor ==\nNorland Moor (approx. 250 acres) above the village is an example of [[Erica|heather]] moorland rising to {{convert|932|ft|m}} at the trig point at the southern end. There is evidence of ancient use with a small number of standing stones, ditches and banks having been identified. The Ladstone, a large outcrop near the trig point, has been linked with Druids as a possible place of ritual sacrifice (Celtic ''llad'' = kill or cut). The moor bears the scars of [[quarrying]] carried out chiefly in the 18th and 19th&nbsp;centuries on its north-western edge. The moor has been a place of recreation for generations but it has attracted illegal gambling dens and prize fights.\n\nPreviously owned by Lord Savile, a large section of the moor was auctioned in 1932 to pay death duties. It was purchased by Mr Francis Longbottom for \u00a3250. Subsequently, the Parish Council launched an appeal (which raised \u00a3373 in eleven days) and Norland Moor passed into its care for the benefit of the local population. In 1937 control passed to Sowerby Bridge Urban District Council and in 1974 to Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council. In 2002 Norland Moor was designated a Local Nature Reserve (LNR).

All dates from the passport stamps of Saudi Arabia are written in the [[Islamic calendar|Hijra Calendar]].]]\nA '''passport stamp''' is an inked impression in a [[passport]] typically made by rubber stamp upon entering or exiting a territory.\n\nPassport stamps may occasionally take the form of sticker stamps, such as entry stamps from [[Visa policy of Japan|Japan]]. Depending on nationality, a visitor may not receive a stamp at all (unless specifically requested), such as an [[European Union|EU]] or [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] citizen travelling to an [[Schengen Area|EU or EFTA country]], [[Visa policy of Albania|Albania]],<ref name=\"parlament.al\">[https://www.parlament.al/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ligj-71.pdf]</ref> or [[Visa policy of North Macedonia|North Macedonia]].<ref>[http://www.mvr.gov.mk/Upload/Documents/ZAKON%20ZA%20GRANI%5ENA%20KONTROLA.pdf]</ref> Most countries issue exit stamps in addition to entry stamps. A few countries issue only entry stamps, including [[Visa policy of Canada|Canada]], [[Visa policy of El Salvador|El Salvador]], [[Visa policy of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Visa policy of New Zealand|New Zealand]], the [[Visa policy of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and the [[Visa policy of the United States|United States]]. \n\n[[Visa policy of Australia|Australia]], [[Visa policy of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Visa policy of Israel|Israel]], [[Visa policy of Macau|Macau]] and [[Visa policy of South Korea|South Korea]] do not stamp passports upon entry nor exit, but issue landing slips instead. [[Visa (document)|Visas]] may also take the form of passport stamps.\n\n==Use==\n[[File:Japan entry and exit stamps.jpg|thumb|Japanese entry and exit stamps showing QR codes]]\nBorder control officials often place stamps in passports as part of their immigration control or customs procedures. This endorsement can serve many different purposes. In the United Kingdom the immigration stamp in the passport includes the formal \"[[leave to enter]]\" granted on entry to the country to a person who is subject to immigration control. Alternatively, the stamps activate and/or acknowledge the continuing leave conferred by the individual's entry clearance. Other authorities, such as those in [[Schengen Area|Schengen]] member states, simply stamp a passport with a date stamp that does not indicate any duration and this stamp is taken to mean either that the person is deemed to have permission to remain for three months or an alternative period as shown on their visa. In Japan, the passport entry sticker also contains a [[QR code]] that allows the immigration official to electronically collect information related to that entry.\n\nMost countries have different stamps for arrivals and departures to make it easier for officers to quickly identify the movements of the person concerned. The colour of the ink or the style of stamp may also provide such information.\n\nIn many cases passengers on [[cruise ship]]s do not receive passport stamps because the entire vessel has been cleared into port.  It is often possible to get a souvenir stamp, although this requires finding the immigration office by the dock.  In many cases officials are used to such requests and will cooperate.<ref>[https://cruiseradio.net/5-cool-places-passport-stamps/ 5 Caribbean Ports to Get Your Passport Stamped]</ref><ref>[https://garyscohen.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/cruise-tales-2015-south-and-east-caribbean-6-in-search-of-passport-stamps/ Cruise Tales \u2013 2015 South and East Caribbean #6: In Search of Passport Stamps]</ref>  Also, as noted below, some of the smallest European countries will give a stamp on request, either at their border or tourist office charging, at most, a nominal fee.\n\n==Overview of passport stamps of countries==\n\n===Asia===\n\n====Bangladesh====\n{{stack| [[File:Entry and exit stamps of Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Entry and exit stamps at [[Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport]] on a [[Bangladeshi passport]].]]}}\n{{stack| [[File:Bangladeshi visa.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Bangladeshi visa in a [[United States passport|U.S. passport]].]]}}\nBangladesh stamps all travellers' passports upon both entry and exit. Handwritten scroll numbers on the stamp make it easier to track a person's complete journey - a Bangladeshi leaving Bangladesh would receive a scroll number upon exit; upon entry, the scroll number would be used to access related journey information of the traveller. The same is the case for foreigners, except that the scroll number is given on entry and then used on exit.\n\nThe stamps are always in black except the date, which is in red. The stamps feature an arrow at the top left corner, pointing left to denote departure, or pointing right for arrival together with a cartoon of the mode of transport at the top right corner.\n\nEntry stamps are rectangular and exit stamps are oval, exit make it visually easier to trace movements.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Bahrain====\n{{stack| [[File:Bahrain entry stamp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Bahrain '''entry''' stamp obtained at [[Bahrain International Airport]].]]}}\n{{stack| [[File:Bahrain exit stamp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Bahrain '''exit''' stamp obtained at [[Bahrain International Airport]].]]}}\n{{clear}}\n\n====Cambodia====\n{{stack|[[File:Cambodia bavet passport stamp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Entry stamp at [[Bavet]] land border crossing on the Cambodia-Vietnam border.]]}}\n{{stack|[[File:Visa cambodia Manfred Werner.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Pre-sticker visas together with older type of passport stamps at [[Siem Reap]] airport.]]}}\n{{stack|[[File:Cambodia exit stamp.png|thumb|upright=0.8|Exit stamp issued at [[Siem Reap International Airport]]]]}}\n{{clear}}\n\n====China====\n<gallery>\nFile:Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport entry stamp.jpg|Entry stamp at [[Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport]] in an old [[People's Republic of China passport]].\nFile:Dongguan passport stamp.jpg|Entry and exit stamps at [[Dongguan]] in an old People's Republic of China passport.<br>(Noted that there were no English on stamps.)\nFile:Fuzhou stamps.jpg|Entry and exit stamps at [[Fuzhou Changle International Airport]] in an old [[Thai passport]].\nFile:Guangzhou stamps.jpg|Entry and exit stamps at [[Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport]] in a Thai passport.\nFile:China Visa Stamp.jpg|Entry and exit stamps at [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]] on an [[Italian passport]].\nFile:China Immigration Stramps Beijing.jpg|Entry and exit stamps at [[Beijing Capital International Airport]] in a [[Republic of Korea passport]].\n</gallery>\n\n====Hong Kong====\nThe [[Hong Kong Immigration Department]] used to stamp the passports of visitors entering and leaving Hong Kong (residents using their [[Hong Kong Identity Card]] did not receive a stamp).

Beginning of 9 July 2013, the [[Public Security Police Force of Macau]] no longer stamps passport and instead, visitors will receive a printed arrival card instead.<ref>[http://www.macaudailytimes.com.mo/macau/45198-tens-of-thousands-of-hours-can-be-saved-by-non-stamping-immigration-clearance.html Tens of thousands of hours can be saved by non-stamping immigration clearance]</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Macau Arrival Card.jpg|Arrival Card replacing existent passport stamps.\nFile:Macau Airport.jpg|Former entry stamp at [[Macau International Airport]].\nFile:Macau passport stamp.jpg|Former entry and exit stamps at [[Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal, Macau]].\nFile:Taipa Macau stamp.jpg|Former entry and exit stamps at [[Taipa Temporary Ferry Terminal]] in a [[Philippine passport]].\n</gallery>\n\n====Malaysia====\nMalaysian immigration authorities apply stamps for both entry and exit in all foreign passports and non-biometric [[Malaysian passport]]s without in-built microchips. Biometric Malaysian passports are usually not stamped as all movements in and out of the country are recorded electronically in the microchip.\n\nMalaysian entry stamps for non-citizens and non-residents are rectangular and stamped in blue or black. They bear the date of entry, point of entry and terms of entry. Entry stamps for residents are also stamped in blue ink but have an oval shape and bear the date and point of entry. Exit stamps are triangular and stamped in red. They bear the date and point of departure.\n\nA peculiarity is the autonomy of the Malaysian states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in immigration affairs. This is attributed to the history of the federation of Malaysia, whereby in 1963, Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore merged to form Malaysia, with the three latter pre-merger entities granted partial autonomy. (Singapore eventually was expelled from the union.)   Foreign visitors who travel to the two states from [[Peninsular Malaysia]] are required to fill in immigration forms and get new stamps on their passports. There is also immigration control for travel between Sabah and Sarawak. Previously, Malaysian citizens from the Peninsular were required to present their passports and have them stamped as well; while they are currently still subjected to immigration control, passports are no longer required for social visits not more than three months.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2011, foreign visitors who entered Malaysia via train from Singapore were cleared electronically without their passports being stamped.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Tanjong Pagar: Talks 'break down' | newspaper= [[New Straits Times]] | pages = 1, 7 | date = 31 July 1998 | url = }}</ref> The change was due to the dispute between Malaysia and Singapore regarding Malaysian-owned railway land in Singapore. The Malaysian railway operator, [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]] (KTM) had its intercity rail southern terminus at [[Tanjong Pagar railway station]] in downtown Singapore, which also housed the border controls of both Malaysia and Singapore for rail passengers before 1998. In 1998, Singapore moved its immigration checkpoint northward to [[Woodlands Train Checkpoint]] near the actual [[Malaysia-Singapore border]] but Malaysia refused to move its checkpoint, resulting in the anomaly that passengers travelling towards Malaysia were granted entry to Malaysia before passing through Singapore exit controls. Instead of passport stamps, foreign visitors were given [[arrival card|disembarkation card]]s stamped with \"KTM Tg Pagar, Singapura\" and the date of entry, which would be collected upon departure from Malaysia and a handwritten note indicating the entry would be endorsed in the passport along with the exit stamp. Passengers travelling to Singapore were not affected as Malaysian exit controls were carried out on board trains at the [[Johor Bahru railway station]], where immigration officers endorsed passports by stamping or handwriting. The anomaly was resolved on 1 July 2011, when Tanjong Pagar railway station was closed and Woodlands Train Checkpoint became the railway terminus in Singapore with co-location of border control facilities of both countries. Foreign visitors entering Malaysia by rail have their passports checked and stamped by Malaysian immigration officers at Woodlands Train Checkpoint after clearing Singapore exit controls.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Malaysia tawaujetty.JPG|Standard entry stamp, this one at [[Tawau]] Port, [[Sabah]], allowing three months' stay.\nFile:Malaysia merapok entry3.JPG|Entry stamp into Sarawak at Merapok checkpoint on the Sabah-Sarawak border, with written date for limit of stay.\nFile:Malaysia subang entry citizen.JPG|Entry stamp for citizens before biometric passports were introduced.

At land borders, the rectangular stamp is accompanied by a round, blue entry stamp. A round, red exit stamp is issued at all points of exit.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Pakistan====\nA circular entry stamp in black ink is applied to passports of all nationalities at the time of entry.

Exit stamps are circular and in green. Both depict the date of entry/exit and entry stamps also state the terms of entry and permitted duration of stay.\n\nBoth entry and exit stamps do not name the point of entry/exit but indicate them by the use of letters of the alphabet - \"A\" is used for entry by air, namely through [[Singapore Changi Airport|Changi Airport]] or Seletar Airport; \"S\" by sea though the Singapore Cruiseship Terminal or Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal; \"T\" by land via the [[Malaysia\u2013Singapore Second Link|Tuas Checkpoint]]; and \"W\" by land via the [[Johor\u2013Singapore Causeway|Woodlands Checkpoint]].

This approach has also been adopted in Italy, where eligible users of [[EGate (Italy)|eGates]] include holders of [[Australian passport|Australian]], [[Canadian passport|Canadian]], [[Israeli passport|Israeli]], [[Japanese passport|Japanese]], [[New Zealand passport|New Zealand]], [[Singaporean passport|Singaporean]], [[South Korean passport|South Korean]], [[United States passport|United States]] and [[Vatican passport|Vatican]] [[biometric passport]]s. A similar but slightly different solution has been adopted by the Dutch [[Royal Marechaussee]] at the Privium [[iris recognition]] automated border gates at [[Amsterdam Schiphol Airport]], where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens, US citizens who are [[Global Entry]] members, and all nationals who are holders of [[diplomatic passport]]s, as well as by the [[Federal Police (Germany)|German Federal Police]] at the ABG Plus [[iris recognition]] automated border gates at [[Frankfurt Airport]] where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and US citizens who are [[Global Entry]] members: when eligible third-country nationals use Privium/ABG Plus, after their iris is scanned and verified, a different gate/door/turnstile opens to that for EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and the third-country national user is directed to a lane which leads them to the front of the queue for manual passport checks at immigration desks, where the border guard stamps the user's passport. Another possible solution would be to design the automated border gates to print a paper slip with an entry or exit stamp on it, as well as the user's name and travel document number, whenever the user is a traveller who is subject to the requirement to have his/her travel document stamped.<ref>Art 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2005 recognises that an entry or exit stamp may be recorded on a sheet of paper indicating the traveller's name and travel document number (rather than inside the traveller's travel document) where stamping the travel document would cause 'serious difficulties' for the traveller. It could be argued that at a particular border crossing point the state of facilities are such that to deny travellers subject to the stamping obligation access to automated border gates and to require them to be processed manually by border guards would constitute 'serious difficulties' for such persons.</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"150px\" heights=\"120px\" perrow=\"4\" caption=\"Uniform design of Schengen member states' passport stamps\">\nFile:Sandefjord passport stamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''air travel'', issued at [[Sandefjord Airport]] in [[Norway]].<br/>(Note that the stamp is in a [[British passport]], hence it was issued on special request.)\nFile:Nickelsdorfpassportstamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''rail travel'', issued in [[Nickelsdorf]] at the Austro-Hungarian border before [[Hungary]] joined the Schengen Area.\nFile:Greece doirani entry.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''road travel'', issued in [[Doirani]] at the Greek-Macedonian border.\nFile:Ijmondpassportstamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''ferry travel'', issued at the port of [[Amsterdam]] IJmond in the [[Netherlands]].\nFile:Czech prague airport exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''air travel'', issued at [[Prague Ruzyn\u011b Airport]] in the [[Czech Republic]].\nFile:Germany bad schandau exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''rail travel'', issued in [[Bad Schandau]] at the Czech-German border before the [[Czech Republic]] joined the Schengen Area.\nFile:Poland korczowa exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''road travel'', issued in [[Korczowa]] at the Polish-Ukrainian border.\nFile:Finland helsinki ferry.JPG|'''Exit stamp''' for ''ferry travel'', issued at the port of [[Helsinki]] in [[Finland]].\n</gallery>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable outercollapse\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n!

Another example relates to third-country nationals who hold a residence permit issued by a [[Schengen Area#Membership|Schengen member state]] \u2014 when crossing the [[Schengen Area#Regulation of external borders|external border of the Schengen Area]], his/her travel document should not be stamped,<ref name=\"EUReport pp.6+9\"/> but when entering/leaving a French overseas department/collectivity, whilst he/she is not required to hold a visa for a short stay not exceeding 90 days in a 180-day period,<ref name=\"diplomatie.gouv.fr\">http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/getting-a-visa/article/foreign-nationals-holding-ordinary</ref> his/her travel document will be stamped upon entry and exit.\n\nAnother exception applies in the case of the French overseas collectivity of [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]]\u2014travellers who in principle are subject to the obligation to have their travel documents stamped but who have cleared immigration control in [[Sint Maarten]] will not have their passport stamped when they enter/leave the French side of [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]].<ref name=\"SaintMartinarrete\"/>\n\nThe design of passport stamps issued in the French overseas departments/collectivities differs from those issued in [[metropolitan France]]/the [[Schengen Area]].

[[Visa (document)|Visas]] may also take the form of passport stamps.\n\n==Use==\n[[File:Japan entry and exit stamps.jpg|thumb|Japanese entry and exit stamps showing QR codes]]\nBorder control officials often place stamps in passports as part of their immigration control or customs procedures. This endorsement can serve many different purposes. In the United Kingdom the immigration stamp in the passport includes the formal \"[[leave to enter]]\" granted on entry to the country to a person who is subject to immigration control. Alternatively, the stamps activate and/or acknowledge the continuing leave conferred by the individual's entry clearance. Other authorities, such as those in [[Schengen Area|Schengen]] member states, simply stamp a passport with a date stamp that does not indicate any duration and this stamp is taken to mean either that the person is deemed to have permission to remain for three months or an alternative period as shown on their visa. In Japan, the passport entry sticker also contains a [[QR code]] that allows the immigration official to electronically collect information related to that entry.\n\nMost countries have different stamps for arrivals and departures to make it easier for officers to quickly identify the movements of the person concerned. The colour of the ink or the style of stamp may also provide such information.\n\nIn many cases passengers on [[cruise ship]]s do not receive passport stamps because the entire vessel has been cleared into port.  It is often possible to get a souvenir stamp, although this requires finding the immigration office by the dock.  In many cases officials are used to such requests and will cooperate.<ref>[https://cruiseradio.net/5-cool-places-passport-stamps/ 5 Caribbean Ports to Get Your Passport Stamped]</ref><ref>[https://garyscohen.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/cruise-tales-2015-south-and-east-caribbean-6-in-search-of-passport-stamps/ Cruise Tales \u2013 2015 South and East Caribbean #6: In Search of Passport Stamps]</ref>  Also, as noted below, some of the smallest European countries will give a stamp on request, either at their border or tourist office charging, at most, a nominal fee.\n\n==Overview of passport stamps of countries==\n\n===Asia===\n\n====Bangladesh====\n{{stack| [[File:Entry and exit stamps of Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Entry and exit stamps at [[Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport]] on a [[Bangladeshi passport]].]]}}\n{{stack| [[File:Bangladeshi visa.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Bangladeshi visa in a [[United States passport|U.S. passport]].]]}}\nBangladesh stamps all travellers' passports upon both entry and exit.

The same is the case for foreigners, except that the scroll number is given on entry and then used on exit.\n\nThe stamps are always in black except the date, which is in red.

Biometric Malaysian passports are usually not stamped as all movements in and out of the country are recorded electronically in the microchip.\n\nMalaysian entry stamps for non-citizens and non-residents are rectangular and stamped in blue or black. They bear the date of entry, point of entry and terms of entry. Entry stamps for residents are also stamped in blue ink but have an oval shape and bear the date and point of entry. Exit stamps are triangular and stamped in red. They bear the date and point of departure.\n\nA peculiarity is the autonomy of the Malaysian states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in immigration affairs. This is attributed to the history of the federation of Malaysia, whereby in 1963, Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore merged to form Malaysia, with the three latter pre-merger entities granted partial autonomy. (Singapore eventually was expelled from the union.)   Foreign visitors who travel to the two states from [[Peninsular Malaysia]] are required to fill in immigration forms and get new stamps on their passports. There is also immigration control for travel between Sabah and Sarawak. Previously, Malaysian citizens from the Peninsular were required to present their passports and have them stamped as well; while they are currently still subjected to immigration control, passports are no longer required for social visits not more than three months.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2011, foreign visitors who entered Malaysia via train from Singapore were cleared electronically without their passports being stamped.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Tanjong Pagar: Talks 'break down' | newspaper= [[New Straits Times]] | pages = 1, 7 | date = 31 July 1998 | url = }}</ref> The change was due to the dispute between Malaysia and Singapore regarding Malaysian-owned railway land in Singapore. The Malaysian railway operator, [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]] (KTM) had its intercity rail southern terminus at [[Tanjong Pagar railway station]] in downtown Singapore, which also housed the border controls of both Malaysia and Singapore for rail passengers before 1998. In 1998, Singapore moved its immigration checkpoint northward to [[Woodlands Train Checkpoint]] near the actual [[Malaysia-Singapore border]] but Malaysia refused to move its checkpoint, resulting in the anomaly that passengers travelling towards Malaysia were granted entry to Malaysia before passing through Singapore exit controls. Instead of passport stamps, foreign visitors were given [[arrival card|disembarkation card]]s stamped with \"KTM Tg Pagar, Singapura\" and the date of entry, which would be collected upon departure from Malaysia and a handwritten note indicating the entry would be endorsed in the passport along with the exit stamp. Passengers travelling to Singapore were not affected as Malaysian exit controls were carried out on board trains at the [[Johor Bahru railway station]], where immigration officers endorsed passports by stamping or handwriting. The anomaly was resolved on 1 July 2011, when Tanjong Pagar railway station was closed and Woodlands Train Checkpoint became the railway terminus in Singapore with co-location of border control facilities of both countries. Foreign visitors entering Malaysia by rail have their passports checked and stamped by Malaysian immigration officers at Woodlands Train Checkpoint after clearing Singapore exit controls.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Malaysia tawaujetty.JPG|Standard entry stamp, this one at [[Tawau]] Port, [[Sabah]], allowing three months' stay.\nFile:Malaysia merapok entry3.JPG|Entry stamp into Sarawak at Merapok checkpoint on the Sabah-Sarawak border, with written date for limit of stay.\nFile:Malaysia subang entry citizen.JPG|Entry stamp for citizens before biometric passports were introduced.

A similar but slightly different solution has been adopted by the Dutch [[Royal Marechaussee]] at the Privium [[iris recognition]] automated border gates at [[Amsterdam Schiphol Airport]], where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens, US citizens who are [[Global Entry]] members, and all nationals who are holders of [[diplomatic passport]]s, as well as by the [[Federal Police (Germany)|German Federal Police]] at the ABG Plus [[iris recognition]] automated border gates at [[Frankfurt Airport]] where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and US citizens who are [[Global Entry]] members: when eligible third-country nationals use Privium/ABG Plus, after their iris is scanned and verified, a different gate/door/turnstile opens to that for EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and the third-country national user is directed to a lane which leads them to the front of the queue for manual passport checks at immigration desks, where the border guard stamps the user's passport. Another possible solution would be to design the automated border gates to print a paper slip with an entry or exit stamp on it, as well as the user's name and travel document number, whenever the user is a traveller who is subject to the requirement to have his/her travel document stamped.<ref>Art 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2005 recognises that an entry or exit stamp may be recorded on a sheet of paper indicating the traveller's name and travel document number (rather than inside the traveller's travel document) where stamping the travel document would cause 'serious difficulties' for the traveller. It could be argued that at a particular border crossing point the state of facilities are such that to deny travellers subject to the stamping obligation access to automated border gates and to require them to be processed manually by border guards would constitute 'serious difficulties' for such persons.</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"150px\" heights=\"120px\" perrow=\"4\" caption=\"Uniform design of Schengen member states' passport stamps\">\nFile:Sandefjord passport stamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''air travel'', issued at [[Sandefjord Airport]] in [[Norway]].<br/>(Note that the stamp is in a [[British passport]], hence it was issued on special request.)\nFile:Nickelsdorfpassportstamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''rail travel'', issued in [[Nickelsdorf]] at the Austro-Hungarian border before [[Hungary]] joined the Schengen Area.\nFile:Greece doirani entry.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''road travel'', issued in [[Doirani]] at the Greek-Macedonian border.\nFile:Ijmondpassportstamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''ferry travel'', issued at the port of [[Amsterdam]] IJmond in the [[Netherlands]].\nFile:Czech prague airport exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''air travel'', issued at [[Prague Ruzyn\u011b Airport]] in the [[Czech Republic]].\nFile:Germany bad schandau exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''rail travel'', issued in [[Bad Schandau]] at the Czech-German border before the [[Czech Republic]] joined the Schengen Area.\nFile:Poland korczowa exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''road travel'', issued in [[Korczowa]] at the Polish-Ukrainian border.\nFile:Finland helsinki ferry.JPG|'''Exit stamp''' for ''ferry travel'', issued at the port of [[Helsinki]] in [[Finland]].\n</gallery>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable outercollapse\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n!

For example, when crossing the [[Schengen Area#Regulation of external borders|external border of the Schengen Area]], only family members of [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]]/[[Swiss]] citizens who hold a residence card issued under Article 10 of [[Directive 2004/38/EC on the right to move and reside freely|Directive 2004/38/EC]] '''and''' who are accompanying or joining their EU, EEA and Swiss citizen family member exercising the right of freedom of movement are exempt from having their travel documents stamped, whereas in the French overseas departments/collectivities mentioned above, more generous rules apply \u2014 when entering/leaving Guadeloupe/Martinique/Saint Pierre and Miquelon, a family member of an [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]]/[[Swiss]] citizen who holds a residence card issued by an EU/EEA member state or Switzerland under Article 10 of Directive 2004/38/EC is exempt from having his/her travel document stamped regardless of whether he/she is accompanying/joining his/her EU/EEA/Swiss citizen family member; when entering/leaving Saint Barth\u00e9lemy and Saint Martin, a family member of an [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]]/[[Swiss]] citizen who holds a residence card issued by an EU/EEA member state or Switzerland is exempt from having his/her travel document stamped regardless of whether he/she is accompanying/joining his/her EU/EEA/Swiss citizen family member and regardless of whether the residence card was issued under Article 10 of Directive 2004/38/EC. Another example relates to third-country nationals who hold a residence permit issued by a [[Schengen Area#Membership|Schengen member state]] \u2014 when crossing the [[Schengen Area#Regulation of external borders|external border of the Schengen Area]], his/her travel document should not be stamped,<ref name=\"EUReport pp.6+9\"/> but when entering/leaving a French overseas department/collectivity, whilst he/she is not required to hold a visa for a short stay not exceeding 90 days in a 180-day period,<ref name=\"diplomatie.gouv.fr\">http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/getting-a-visa/article/foreign-nationals-holding-ordinary</ref> his/her travel document will be stamped upon entry and exit.\n\nAnother exception applies in the case of the French overseas collectivity of [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]]\u2014travellers who in principle are subject to the obligation to have their travel documents stamped but who have cleared immigration control in [[Sint Maarten]] will not have their passport stamped when they enter/leave the French side of [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]].<ref name=\"SaintMartinarrete\"/>\n\nThe design of passport stamps issued in the French overseas departments/collectivities differs from those issued in [[metropolitan France]]/the [[Schengen Area]]. Previously, entry stamps issued in French overseas departments/collectivities were rectangular, whilst exit stamps were hexagonal. Under the current design, both entry and exit stamps issued in French overseas departments/collectivities are hexagonal and have a similar design to Schengen Area stamps.
