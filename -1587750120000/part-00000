{"title_page": "Motets by Johann Sebastian Bach, discography", "text_new": "This article includes a list of commercial recordings of the [[Motet (Bach)|motets]] of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. Bach motets have often been recorded as a set (typically comprising the six motets catalogued as BWV{{nbsp}}225-230).{{efn|\"BWV\" is [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]], a thematic catalogue of Bach's works.}}  However, other motets are attributed to Bach and there is some doubt about the authorship of [[Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden, BWV 230|''Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden'', BWV 230]], one of the {{abbr|BWV|Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (catalogue of Bach's works)}} \"six\".\n\nA single CD can contain the set of six motets plus other works. For example, [[Maasaki Suzuki]]'s 2009 recording with  the [[Bach Collegium Japan]] on [[BIS Records|BIS]] includes [[O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht, BWV 118|''O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht'', BWV 118]] (which at one time was categorised as a cantata) and [[Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh. 159|''Ich lasse dich nicht'', BWV Anh. 159]] (the authorship of which has been disputed).<ref name=\"BIS\">{{Cite web |url=https://bis.se/conductors/suzuki-masaaki/bach-motets |title=Bach Motets |website=bis.se (BIS Records) |access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref> The motets chosen for a recording can reflect the way the balance of opinion changes regarding the status of particular work: given Bach's status as one of the great composers, a firm attribution to him is likely to result in the piece in question being recorded. For example, {{nowrap|BWV Anh. 159}} was not included by [[John Eliot Gardiner]] and the [[Monteverdi Choir]] in their first set recorded in 1980. However, they included it in their 2011 recording,<ref name=\"muzie\">[https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX11558 ''Bach: Motets''] and [https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX10438 ''Bach Motets''] at {{url|www.muziekweb.nl}}.</ref> by which time scholarly opinion had re-assessed the work.\n\nThere has also been interest in recording the less securely attributed and even spurious motets. For example, [[Wolfgang Helbich]] recorded ''The Apocryphal Bach Motets'', sung by the Alsfelder Vokalensemble, in 1993 (released in 1994, re-issued 2014).<ref>[https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX3080 ''The Apocryphal Bach Motets: BWV Anh. 159\u2013165''] at {{url|www.muziekweb.nl}}.</ref><ref name=\"Arkiv1\">[http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/album.jsp?album_id=1153384 The Sacred Apocryphal Bach (8&nbsp;CD set)] at [[ArkivMusic]] website.</ref>\n\n== Types of choirs ==\nChoirs with [[one voice per part]] (OVPP) are used in some [[historically informed performance]]s of Bach. However, OVPP recordings of the motets are in the minority. Exceptions include the [[Hilliard Ensemble]]'s second set,<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{Cite news |last=Clements |first=Andrew |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/may/18/classicalmusicandopera.shopping2 |title=Bach: Motets |date=18 May 2007 |work=The Guardian |access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref> and [[Konrad Jungh\u00e4nel]] with the group Cantus C\u00f6lln.<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas6\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec6.htm |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 6 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref> [[Philippe Herreweghe]]'s second set uses OVPP for some motets and not others.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=2012 |title=Bach, JS: Motets BWV 225-230 |url=http://www.classical-music.com/review/bach-js-motets-bwv-225-230 |magazine=BBC Music Magazine}}</ref>\n\nAt least some of the motets would have been first performed by singers from Leipzig's [[Thomanerchor]], which comprises boys and young men. This choir has recorded the motets (initially under [[G\u00fcnther Ramin]] in the 1950s),<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas2\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec2.htm  |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 2 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref> as have other choirs with boys' voices such as the [[Choir of New College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"BachCantatas7\"/>\n\n== Instrumental accompaniment ==\nMusic directors need to make choices about the instrumental accompaniment, if any, to be used.

Bach motets have often been recorded as a set (typically comprising the six motets catalogued as BWV{{nbsp}}225-230).{{efn|\"BWV\" is [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]], a thematic catalogue of Bach's works.}}  However, other motets are attributed to Bach and there is some doubt about the authorship of [[Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden, BWV 230|''Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden'', BWV 230]], one of the {{abbr|BWV|Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (catalogue of Bach's works)}} \"six\".\n\nA single CD can contain the set of six motets plus other works. For example, [[Maasaki Suzuki]]'s 2009 recording with  the [[Bach Collegium Japan]] on [[BIS Records|BIS]] includes [[O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht, BWV 118|''O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht'', BWV 118]] (which at one time was categorised as a cantata) and [[Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh. 159|''Ich lasse dich nicht'', BWV Anh. 159]] (the authorship of which has been disputed).<ref name=\"BIS\">{{Cite web |url=https://bis.se/conductors/suzuki-masaaki/bach-motets |title=Bach Motets |website=bis.se (BIS Records) |access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref> The motets chosen for a recording can reflect the way the balance of opinion changes regarding the status of particular work: given Bach's status as one of the great composers, a firm attribution to him is likely to result in the piece in question being recorded.

The school was founded in 1978 by philosopher [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]]. The student population of the school is around 325 from classes 1 to 12 (ages 6 to 17). \n<!-- doesn't show...........[[File:TheValleySchoolMB.JPG|top|right]]-->\n\n== Culture ==\n<!--I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT \"REGULAR\" MEANS.....The dress code is casual or regular. -->Interactions between teacher and student are informal and based on [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]]\u2019s philosophy that \"Learning cannot happen when there is fear\". Freedom with responsibility is emphasized from an early age, and rewards and punishments are kept to a minimum. Students are encouraged to direct their own learning. \n<!--SORRY BUT THIS NEXT STUFF IS UNREFERENCED, AND EVEN IF CORRECT IS NOT OK IN WP. YOU MUST PROVIDE A REFERENCE FOR WHAT YOU SAY......\nA common criticism is that the school provides the students a false sense of utopia that does not prepare them to meet the challenges of the real world. Another prominent criticism from teachers who were once a part of the school is that the school does not give sufficient emphasis to its unique philosophy. The school has very little emphasis on the concept of competition and does not encourage it.-->\n\n== Intent of the School ==\n\nThe ethos and culture of the school is based on the teachings of  J. Krishnamurti and the attempt is to:\nDiscover a way of living that is whole, sane and intelligent and not merely concerned with intellect, memory / skills\nLook beyond academic excellence \u2013 teacher and taught explore not only the outer world but also the inner \u2013 conditioning, ways of thinking and behaviour\nUnderstand the  importance and limitations of knowledge\nTo help one to think for oneself, and out of that feel immense confidence, to be a creative human being and not a slavish machine\nNurture sensitivity and compassion\nJiddu Krishnamurti, long acknowledged as one of the world's foremost teachers, dedicated his life to awakening people to their own conditioning and to the possibility of freedom. He maintained,\n\"A school is a place where one learns both the importance of knowledge and its limitation. It is a place where one learns to observe the world without a particular point of view or conclusion. One learns to look at the whole of man's endeavor, his search for beauty, his search for truth and a way of living that is not a contradiction between conclusion and action.It is a place where both teacher and the taught learn a way of life in which conflict ends. It is the concern of these schools to bring about a new generation of human beings who are free from self-centered action, to bring about a mind that has no conflict within itself and so end the struggle and conflict in the world about us.\" - J. Krishnamurti\nA Krishnamurti School concerns itself with education of the total human being. Knowledge and intellectual capability alone are not sufficient to meet life\u2019s challenges. Learning to enquire, to observe oneself, to relate with other people and the earth, is the core intention of the school.\nA Krishnamurti School is a constantly questioning, evolving institution, with the intention of creating an environment, a climate where one can bring about, if at all possible, a new human being. It is imperative therefore that parents and students understand and appreciate the intention of the school and actively participate in this movement.\n\"The purpose, the aim and drive of these schools is to equip the child with the most excellent technological proficiency so that he may function with clarity and efficiency in the modern world, and far more important to create the right climate so that the child may develop fully as a complete human being.This means giving him the opportunity to flower in goodness so that he is rightly related to people, things and ideas, to the whole of life. To live is to be related. There is no relationship to anything if there is not the right feeling for beauty, a response to nature, to music and art, a highly developed aesthetic sense.\" \u2013 J. Krishnamurti\nThe school sincerely attempts to translate this intent by adopting the following :\nRelationship between the student and the teacher- is human to human rather than position to position.\nEmphasis is on learning and facilitation and not teaching and absorbing.\nRecognize the fact that each child is unique and one size does not fit all !\nMethodology and pedagogical techniques  that  ensure that there is no hierarchy of knowledge and suitable for differential learning capacities and learning speed\nArt, music, dance and sports form an integral part of the learning process\nLearning from nature is facilitated by the bounty all around.<ref>http://valleyschool.herokuapp.com/intent</ref>\n\n== Education and curriculum ==\nThe lower school is run based on [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]]'s philosophies, where teachers and students are given freedom and flexibility. At the lower schools, the students are encouraged to think and derive at answers through guidance and correction. Along with a standard curriculum of science and humanities, extra-curricular activities are encouraged. Tests and examinations are kept to a minimum where there are no official \"annual exam\" till Grade 9. When a student reaches Grade 9 it will be the first time the students writes an exam conducted by the school.\n\nHigher classes follow a standard [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education|ICSE]] curriculum, where they appear for a nationwide public board examination at the end of class 10. Class 12 students appear for the ISC examinations conducted by the same board. The School has had a 100% Pass percentage in both 10th and 12th since the batch of 1999.\n\n== Campus ==\nThe school was set on a {{convert|120|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus with a lake and two artificial ponds, dams, three ancient [[Banyan]] trees (over 100 years old), and lightly wooded rolling hills. However, {{convert|17|acre|km2|adj=on}} of land was taken by the forest department of the government with clear notice and now the school campus is {{convert|103|acre|km2|adj=on}}. Academic buildings are concentrated around the main school in the eastern section of the campus; the student dormitories, residential quarters, guesthouses and the old \"Art Village\" was located on the western side. The old Art Village was destroyed and taken by the Forest Department in the year 2008. The New \"Art Village\" is located and built around the school Amphitheater.\n\nThe school had three entrances initially, the first gate being the main entrance to the school building, the second gate gave access to the football field while the third gate gave access to the Study Centre and the residential houses, as well as the Art Village. A stylized Neem Tree - which rests the highest point on the land, is the logo of the school. The school is divided into three divisions- Junior School- classes 1-4, Middle school- classes 5-7, and senior school- classes 8-12.\n\n== Transportation and Housing ==\nMost students commute to school by bus. The buses are both privately owned and public [[Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation|BMTC]] contract buses. The school buses operate on routes in the city, picking up and dropping students off. Car pooling is encouraged. Boarding is optional and is available for classes 11 and higher. Student hostels are located on campus.\n\n== Events ==\n* School birthday on 17 July.\n* J.Krishnamurti's birthday on 11 May.\n* Sports day on 15 and 16 August.\n* School Mela - first Saturday after reopening of school after Christmas vacation.\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\nThe school is a spot for regular outings of the [[Birdwatchers' Field Club of Bangalore]]. About 215 species of birds have been recorded on campus. Other creatures seen are fifteen species of mammals including deer, wild boar and elephants, a resident [[Panthera|panthers]], and twenty species of snakes, of which five are venomous. The students learn about the importance of nature and are taught to coexist with it.\n\n== Sister schools ==\n'''India'''\n* Bal-Anand\n* Bhagirathi Valley School\n* Rajghat Besant School\n* [[Rishi Valley School]]\n* [[Sahyadri School]]\n* [[The School KFI]]\n\n'''United Kingdom'''\n* [[Brockwood Park]]\n\n'''United States of America'''\n* The [[Oak Grove School (Ojai, California)|Oak Grove School]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]]\n* [[Jiddu Krishnamurti Schools]]\n* [[Rishi Valley School]]\n* [[Walden's Path]], [[Hyderabad]]\n* [[List of schools in India]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* https://thevalleyschool.info\n\n== External links ==\n{{commonscat}}\n* {{official|valleyschool.herokuapp.com}}\n* [http://www.jkrishnamurti.org/ Jiddu Krishnamurthy]\n* [http://www.kfionline.org/ Krishnamurthy Foundation India]\n\n{{Portal bar|Education|Schools}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Valley School The}}\n[[Category:Private schools in Bangalore]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1978]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=August 2018}}\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2017}}\n''For schools of similar names, see [[Valley School (disambiguation)]]''\n{{Infobox school\n|name = The Valley School\n|image =\n|logo = TheValleySchoolLogo.JPG\n|established = 1978\n|type = [[Private school (UK)|Private school]]\n|head_name = Headmaster\n|head =\n|city = [[Bangalore]]\n|state = [[Karnataka]]\n|country = [[India]]\n|campus = Urban\n|enrollment = 350\n|faculty = 30\n|grades= 1-12\n|colors =\n|mascot =\n|homepage = [http://www.thevalleyschool.info Official website]\n}}\n\n'''The Valley School''' is a co-educational private day school 20&nbsp;km south of [[Bangalore]] city in [[India]] ({{Coord|12.8535|77.51}}). The school was founded in 1978 by philosopher [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]]. The student population of the school is around 325 from classes 1 to 12 (ages 6 to 17). \n<!-- doesn't show...........[[File:TheValleySchoolMB.JPG|top|right]]-->\n\n== Culture ==\n<!--I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT \"REGULAR\" MEANS.....The dress code is casual or regular. -->Interactions between teacher and student are informal and based on [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]]\u2019s philosophy that \"Learning cannot happen when there is fear\". Freedom with responsibility is emphasized from an early age, and rewards and punishments are kept to a minimum. Students are encouraged to direct their own learning. \n<!--SORRY BUT THIS NEXT STUFF IS UNREFERENCED, AND EVEN IF CORRECT IS NOT OK IN WP. YOU MUST PROVIDE A REFERENCE FOR WHAT YOU SAY......\nA common criticism is that the school provides the students a false sense of utopia that does not prepare them to meet the challenges of the real world. Another prominent criticism from teachers who were once a part of the school is that the school does not give sufficient emphasis to its unique philosophy. The school has very little emphasis on the concept of competition and does not encourage it.-->\n\n== Intent of the School ==\n\nThe ethos and culture of the school is based on the teachings of  J. Krishnamurti and the attempt is to:\nDiscover a way of living that is whole, sane and intelligent and not merely concerned with intellect, memory / skills\nLook beyond academic excellence \u2013 teacher and taught explore not only the outer world but also the inner \u2013 conditioning, ways of thinking and behaviour\nUnderstand the  importance and limitations of knowledge\nTo help one to think for oneself, and out of that feel immense confidence, to be a creative human being and not a slavish machine\nNurture sensitivity and compassion\nJiddu Krishnamurti, long acknowledged as one of the world's foremost teachers, dedicated his life to awakening people to their own conditioning and to the possibility of freedom. He maintained,\n\"A school is a place where one learns both the importance of knowledge and its limitation. It is a place where one learns to observe the world without a particular point of view or conclusion. One learns to look at the whole of man's endeavor, his search for beauty, his search for truth and a way of living that is not a contradiction between conclusion and action.It is a place where both teacher and the taught learn a way of life in which conflict ends. It is the concern of these schools to bring about a new generation of human beings who are free from self-centered action, to bring about a mind that has no conflict within itself and so end the struggle and conflict in the world about us.\" - J. Krishnamurti\nA Krishnamurti School concerns itself with education of the total human being. Knowledge and intellectual capability alone are not sufficient to meet life\u2019s challenges. Learning to enquire, to observe oneself, to relate with other people and the earth, is the core intention of the school.\nA Krishnamurti School is a constantly questioning, evolving institution, with the intention of creating an environment, a climate where one can bring about, if at all possible, a new human being. It is imperative therefore that parents and students understand and appreciate the intention of the school and actively participate in this movement.\n\"The purpose, the aim and drive of these schools is to equip the child with the most excellent technological proficiency so that he may function with clarity and efficiency in the modern world, and far more important to create the right climate so that the child may develop fully as a complete human being.This means giving him the opportunity to flower in goodness so that he is rightly related to people, things and ideas, to the whole of life. To live is to be related. There is no relationship to anything if there is not the right feeling for beauty, a response to nature, to music and art, a highly developed aesthetic sense.\" \u2013 J. Krishnamurti\nThe school sincerely attempts to translate this intent by adopting the following :\nRelationship between the student and the teacher- is human to human rather than position to position.\nEmphasis is on learning and facilitation and not teaching and absorbing.\nRecognize the fact that each child is unique and one size does not fit all !\nMethodology and pedagogical techniques  that  ensure that there is no hierarchy of knowledge and suitable for differential learning capacities and learning speed\nArt, music, dance and sports form an integral part of the learning process\nLearning from nature is facilitated by the bounty all around.<ref>http://valleyschool.herokuapp.com/intent</ref>\n\n== Education and curriculum ==\nThe lower school is run based on [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]]'s philosophies, where teachers and students are given freedom and flexibility. At the lower schools, the students are encouraged to think and derive at answers through guidance and correction. Along with a standard curriculum of science and humanities, extra-curricular activities are encouraged. Tests and examinations are kept to a minimum where there are no official \"annual exam\" till Grade 9. When a student reaches Grade 9 it will be the first time the students writes an exam conducted by the school.\n\nHigher classes follow a standard [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education|ICSE]] curriculum, where they appear for a nationwide public board examination at the end of class 10. Class 12 students appear for the ISC examinations conducted by the same board. The School has had a 100% Pass percentage in both 10th and 12th since the batch of 1999.\n\n== Campus ==\nThe school was set on a {{convert|120|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus with a lake and two artificial ponds, dams, three ancient [[Banyan]] trees (over 100 years old), and lightly wooded rolling hills. However, {{convert|17|acre|km2|adj=on}} of land was taken by the forest department of the government with clear notice and now the school campus is {{convert|103|acre|km2|adj=on}}. Academic buildings are concentrated around the main school in the eastern section of the campus; the student dormitories, residential quarters, guesthouses and the old \"Art Village\" was located on the western side. The old Art Village was destroyed and taken by the Forest Department in the year 2008. The New \"Art Village\" is located and built around the school Amphitheater.\n\nThe school had three entrances initially, the first gate being the main entrance to the school building, the second gate gave access to the football field while the third gate gave access to the Study Centre and the residential houses, as well as the Art Village.

But they never really conquered these northern tribes, and they remained a thorn in the flesh of Roman Britain. By about AD 120, the northern frontier ranged from [[Wallsend]] in the east, to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] in the west, and the emperor [[Hadrian]] said, \"Build a wall, and keep all the others out.\" This remains the best known frontier anywhere in the Roman world, and it's the perfect place from which to contemplate life at the edge of empire.''|Adam Hart-Davis}}\n* [[Hadrian's Wall]] marked the northern boundary of the Roman Empire, and had defensive features such as [[milecastle]]s and forts such as [[Vercovicium|Housesteads]].\n* At supply depots such as [[Arbeia]], Romans baked bread in open fires.\n* Roman soldiers used rounded stones as defensive weapons, and blacksmiths made [[arrowhead]]s and other items out of [[iron]].\n* Many documents have been discovered at [[Vindolanda]] fort, such as [[postcard]]s made out of thin [[wood veneer]].\n* [[Wax]] tablets were used for making temporary notes.\n* Flagged beacons were used to send messages between forts, milecastles, and watchtowers.\n* Pre-determined messages were also sent using identical [[water-clock]]s, and signalling using fire.\n\n===Episode six: ''Ahead of Their Time''===\n{{quote|''The Romans ruled Britain for nearly four hundred years. They brought with them all sorts of revolutionary new concepts, from the hot [[bathing|bath]] to the [[hamburger]]. In this programme, I'm going to look at some of their wackier technology, like the first [[robot]], and the [[slot machine]]; inventions that were literally centuries ahead of their time.''|Adam Hart-Davis}}\n* The occupying Romans kept their people occupied with food and entertainment, or \"bread and circuses\".\n* [[Gladiator]]s performing in [[amphitheatre]]s would use a coin-operated water dispenser for cleansing as part of their pre-fight rituals.\n* Romans built [[automaton|automata]] driven by a weight sitting on a container of sand that was slowly allowed to empty.\n* Builders made [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] out of [[chalk]] and [[sand]], and added volcanic ash to make quick-setting [[concrete]]. This was used to make [[arch]]ed and [[dome]]d structures.\n* An anonymous work, ''[[De Rebus Bellicis]]'', featured various war machines, such as an inflatable [[bridge]] made out of animal skins.\n* Eventually, the Roman empire simply became too large and indefensible, and the troops were gradually withdrawn from Britain.

The number of points for each lettered tile is based on the letter's frequency in standard English; commonly used letters such as vowels are worth one point, while less common letters score higher, with Q and Z each worth 10 points. The game also has two blank tiles that are unmarked and carry no point value. The blank tiles can be used as substitutes for any letter; once laid on the board, however, the choice is fixed. Other language sets use different letter set distributions with different point values.\n\nTiles are usually made of wood or plastic and are {{convert|19|x|19|mm}} square and {{convert|4|mm|abbr=on}} thick, making them slightly smaller than the squares on the board. Only the rosewood tiles of the deluxe edition vary in width up to {{convert|2|mm|2|abbr=on}} for different letters. Travelling versions of the game often have smaller tiles (e.g. {{convert|13|x|13|mm|abbr=on}}); sometimes they are magnetic to keep them in place. The capital letter is printed in black at the centre of the tile face and the letter's point value printed in a smaller font at the bottom right corner.

Q is considered the most troublesome letter, as almost all words with it also contain U; a similar problem occurs in other languages like French, Dutch, Italian and German.

(On ''Scrabble'' boards manufactured by Mattel as well as on the [[Internet Scrabble Club]], rows are lettered while columns are numbered instead.) A play is usually identified in the format ''xy WORD score'' or ''WORD xy score'', where ''x'' denotes the column or row on which the play's main word extends, ''y'' denotes the second coordinate of the main word's first letter, and ''WORD'' is the main word. Although it is unnecessary, additional words formed by the play are sometimes listed after the main word and a slash. When the play of a single tile forms words in each direction, one of the words is arbitrarily chosen to serve as the main word for purposes of notation.\n\nWhen a blank tile is employed in the main word, the letter it has been chosen to represent is indicated with a lower case letter, or, in handwritten notation, with a square around the letter. When annotating a play, previously existing letters on the board are usually enclosed in parentheses.\n\nExchanges are often annotated by a minus sign followed by the tiles that were exchanged alphabetically; for example, if a player holds EIIISTU, exchanging two I's and a U would be denoted as \"\u2212IIU.\"\n\nThe image at right gives examples of valid plays and how they would typically be annotated using the notation system.\n\n[[File:Scrabble-example.png|thumb|An example of a Scrabble game in progress using Quackle, an open-source program. The first few plays are JOKED 8D 50, followed by REV(O)TInG E5 94 and YEX# F4 56.]]\n\nAdditionally, a number of symbols have been employed to indicate the validity of words in different lexica:\n* '''<nowiki>*</nowiki>''' means an illegal, or phony, word.\n* '''<nowiki>#</nowiki>''' means a word valid in games using the British-originated word list ([[Collins Scrabble Words|CSW12]]) only.\n* '''$''' means a word valid in games using the American-originated word list ([[Official Tournament and Club Word List|TWL2]]) only.\n* '''!''' means a word judged to be offensive, and thus valid in tournament games only.\n\n===Sequence of play===\nBefore the game, a resource, either a word list or a dictionary, is selected for the purpose of adjudicating any challenges during the game. The tiles are either put in an opaque bag or placed face down on a flat surface. Opaque cloth bags and customized tiles are staples of clubs and tournaments, where games are rarely played without both.\n[[File:Scrabble 2015.jpg|right|thumb|A game of ''Scrabble'' in [[French language|French]]]]\n\nNext, players decide the order in which they play. The normal approach is for players to each draw one tile: The player who picks the letter closest to the beginning of the alphabet goes first, with blank tiles taking precedence over the letter A. In most North American tournaments, the rules of the US-based [[North American Scrabble Players Association]] (NASPA) stipulate instead that players who have gone first in the fewest previous games in the tournament go first, and when that rule yields a tie, those who have gone second the most go first. If there is still a tie, tiles are drawn as in the standard rules.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, each player draws seven tiles from the bag and places them on their rack, concealed from the other player(s).\n\n====Making a play====\nThe first played word must be at least two letters long, and cover H8 (the center square). Thereafter, any move is made by using one or more tiles to place a word on the board. This word may use one or more tiles already on the board and must join with the cluster of tiles already on the board.\n\nOn each turn, the player has three options:\n* Pass, forfeiting the turn and scoring nothing\n* Exchange one or more tiles for an equal number from the bag, scoring nothing, an option available only if at least seven tiles remain in the bag\n* Play at least one tile on the board, adding the value of all words formed to the player's cumulative score\n\nA proper play uses one or more of the player's tiles to form a continuous string of letters that make a word (the play's \"main word\") on the board, reading either left-to-right or top-to-bottom. The main word must either use the letters of one or more previously played words or else have at least one of its tiles horizontally or vertically adjacent to an already played word. If any words other than the main word are formed by the play, they are scored as well and are subject to the same criteria of acceptability. See [[Scrabble#Scoring|Scoring]] for more details.\n\nA blank tile may represent any letter, and scores zero points, regardless of its placement or what letter it represents. Its placement on a double-word or triple-word square causes the corresponding premium to be applied to the word(s) in which it is used. Once a blank tile is placed, it remains that particular letter for the remainder of the game.\n\nAfter making a play, the player announces the score for that play, and then, if the game is being played with a [[Chess clock|clock]], starts the opponent's clock. The player can change their play as long as the player's clock is running, but commits to the play when they start the opponent's clock. The player then draws tiles from the bag to replenish their rack to seven tiles. If there are not enough tiles in the bag to do so, the player takes all the remaining tiles.\n\nIf a player has made a play and has not yet drawn a tile, the opponent may choose to [[Challenge (Scrabble)|challenge]] any or all words formed by the play. The player challenged must then look up the words in question using a specified word source (such as [[Official Tournament and Club Word List|OTCWL]], the ''[[Official Scrabble Players Dictionary]]'', or [[SOWPODS|CSW]]) and if any one of them is found to be unacceptable, the play is removed from the board, the player returns the newly played tiles to their rack, and the turn is forfeited. In tournament play, a challenge may be to the entire play or any one or more words formed in the play, and judges (human or computer) are used, so players are not entitled to know which word(s) are invalid. Penalties for unsuccessfully challenging an acceptable play vary in club and tournament play and are described in greater detail below.\n\n====End of game====\nUnder North American tournament rules, the game ends when either:\n# one player plays every tile on their rack, and there are no tiles remaining in the bag (regardless of the tiles on the opponent's rack)\n# at least six successive scoreless turns have occurred and either player decides to end the game\n# either player uses more than 10 minutes of overtime. (For several years, a game could not end with a cumulative score of 0\u20130, but that is no longer the case, and such games have since occurred a number of times in tournament play, the winner being the player with the lower total point value on their rack.<ref>{{cross-tables player-tournament|pid=560|pname=Marlon Hill|tid=6898|tname=Albany, NY July 2010}}</ref>)\n\nWhen the game ends, each player's score is reduced by the sum of their unplayed letters. In addition, if a player has used all of their letters (known as \"going out\" or \"playing out\"), the sum of the other player's unplayed letters is added to that player's score; in tournament play, a player who goes out adds twice that sum, and their opponent is not penalized.\n\n====Examples====\nPlays can be made in a number of ways (in what follows, it is assumed that the word JACK has been played on a previous turn; letters in parentheses represent tiles already on the board):\n* Adding one or more letters to an existing word, e.g. (JACK)S, HI(JACK), HI(JACK)ING, (JACK)FRUIT.\n* \"Hooking\" a word and playing perpendicular to that word, e.g. playing IONIZES with the S hooked on (JACK) to make (JACK)S.\n* Playing perpendicular to a word, e.g. YEU(K)Y through the K in JACK.\n* Playing parallel to a word(s) forming several short words, e.g. CON played under (JACK) simultaneously forming (J)O and (A)N.\n\nAny combination of these is allowed in a play, as long as all the letters placed on the board in one play lie in one row or column and are connected by a main word, and any run of tiles on two or more consecutive squares along a row or column constitutes a valid word.\n\nWords must read either left-to-right or top-to-bottom. Diagonal plays are not allowed.\n\n===Scoring===\n<div style=\"float: right;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ Premium square colors\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:80px;\"| Square !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:80px;\"| Original and Mattel version !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:80px;\"| Hasbro Version (2008\u20132014)\n|-\n| Double letter\n| style=\"background:#6cf;\"| Light blue\n| style=\"background:#09f;\"| {{white|Blue}}\n|-\n| Triple letter\n| style=\"background:#06f;\"| {{white|Dark blue}}\n| style=\"background:#290;\"| {{white|Green}}\n|-\n| Double word\n| style=\"background:#f9f;\"| Pink\n| style=\"background:#f00;\"| {{white|Red}}\n|-\n| Triple word\n| style=\"background:#f00;\"| {{white|Red}}\n| style=\"background:#f90;\"| {{white|Orange}}\n|}\n</div>\nThe score for any play is determined this way:\n* Each new word formed in a play is scored separately, and then those scores are added up. The value of each tile is indicated on the tile, and blank tiles are worth zero points.\n* The main word (defined as the word containing every played letter) is scored. The letter values of the tiles are added up, and tiles placed on Double Letter Score (DLS) and Triple Letter Score (TLS) squares are doubled or tripled in value, respectively. Tiles placed on Double Word Score (DWS) or Triple Word Score (TWS) squares double or triple the value of the word(s) that include those tiles, respectively. In particular, the center square (H8) is considered a DWS, and the first play is doubled in value.\n* If any \"hook\" words are played (e.g. playing ANEROID while \"hooking\" the A to BETTING to make ABETTING), the scores for each word are added separately. This is common for \"parallel\" plays that make up to eight words in one turn.\n* Premium squares apply only when newly placed tiles cover them. Any subsequent plays do not count those premium squares.\n* If a player covers both letter and word premium squares with a single word, the letter premium(s) is/are calculated first, followed by the word premium(s).\n* If a player makes a play where the main word covers two DWS squares, the value of that word is doubled, then redoubled (i.e. 4\u00d7 the word value). Similarly, if the main word covers two TWS squares, the value of that word is tripled, then retripled (9\u00d7 the word value). Such plays are often referred to as \"double-doubles\" and \"triple-triples\" respectively. It is theoretically possible to achieve a play covering three TWS squares (a 27\u00d7 word score), although this is extremely improbable without constructive setup and collaboration. Plays covering a DWS and a TWS simultaneously (6\u00d7 the word value, or 18\u00d7 if a DWS and two TWS squares are covered) are only possible if a player misses the center star on the first turn, and the play goes unchallenged (this is valid under North American tournament rules).\n* Finally, if seven tiles have been laid on the board in one turn, known as a \"[[bingo (Scrabble)|bingo]]\" in North America and as a \"bonus\" elsewhere, after all of the words formed have been scored, 50 bonus points are added.\n\nWhen the letters to be drawn have run out, the final play can often determine the winner. This is particularly the case in close games with more than two players.\n\nScoreless turns can occur when a player passes, exchanges tiles, or loses a challenge. The latter rule varies slightly in international tournaments. A scoreless turn can also theoretically occur if a play consists of only blank tiles, but this is extremely unlikely in actual play.\n\n====Example====\nSuppose Player 1 plays QUANT 8D, with the Q on a DLS and T on the center star. The score for this play would be (2 \u00d7 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) \u00d7 2 = 48 (following the [[order of operations]]).\n\nPlayer 2 extends the play to ALI(QUANT) 8A with the A on the TWS at 8A. The score for this play would be (1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) \u00d7 3 = 51. Note that the Q is not doubled for this play.\n\nPlayer 1 has DDIIIOO and plays OIDIOID 9G. The score for the word OIDIOID would be (2 \u00d7 1 + 1 + 2 \u00d7 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 \u00d7 2) = 14. Additionally, Player 1 formed NO and TI, which score 1 + 2 \u00d7 1 = 3 and 1 + 1 = 2 points respectively. Therefore, the sum of all the values of the words formed is 14+3+2 = 19. But since this is a seven-letter play, 50 points are added, resulting in a total score of 69. Player 1 now has a 117\u201351 lead.\n\nThe player with the highest final score wins the game. In case of a tie, the player with the highest score before adjusting for unplayed tiles wins the game. In tournament play, a tie counts as 1/2 a win for both players.\n\n===Acceptable words===\nAcceptable words are the primary entries in some chosen [[dictionary]], and all of their [[inflection|inflected]] forms. Words that are hyphenated, capitalized (such as [[proper noun]]s), or apostrophized are not allowed, unless they also appear as acceptable entries; JACK is a proper noun, but the word ''[[wikt:jack|JACK]]'' is acceptable because it has other usages as a common noun (automotive, [[vexillology|vexillological]], etc.) and verb that are acceptable. Acronyms or abbreviations, other than those that have acceptable entries (such as ''[[AWOL]]'', ''[[RADAR]]'', ''[[LASER]]'', and ''[[Scuba diving|SCUBA]]'') are not allowed. Variant spellings, slang or offensive terms, archaic or obsolete terms, and specialized jargon words are allowed if they meet all other criteria for acceptability, but archaic spellings (e.g. ''NEEDE'' for ''NEED'') are generally not allowed. Foreign words are not allowed in English-language ''Scrabble'' unless they have been incorporated into the English language, as with PATISSERIE, KILIM, and QI. Vulgar and offensive words are generally excluded from the OSPD4 but allowed in club and tournament play.\n\nProper nouns and other exceptions to the usual rules are allowed in some limited contexts in the spin-off game [[Trickster (board game)|''Scrabble Trickster'']]. Names of recognized computer programs are permitted as an acceptable proper noun (For example, WinZIP).\n\nThe memorization of two-letter words is considered an essential skill in this game.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title=[Loopful] Two Letter Words Allowed In Scrabble |publisher=Word Buff\n|url=http://www.word-buff.com/two-letter-words.html\n|accessdate=2015-06-08\n }}\n</ref>\n\n[[File:PocketScrabble.JPG|thumb|left|250 px|A near-ending game board, tiles and racks of the magnetic Pocket ''Scrabble'' (International, Mattel, Inc.)]]\n\nThere are two popular competition word lists used in various parts of the world:\n* [[Tournament Word List|TWL]] (also known as OTCWL, OWL, or TWL)\n* [[SOWPODS]] (also called \"Collins\" or \"CSW\")\nThe first is used in America, Canada, Israel and Thailand, and the second in all other English-speaking countries\n\n====TWL, OWL2 and OSPD5====\nThe North American 2006 ''[[Official Tournament and Club Word List]], Second Edition'' (OWL2) went into official use in American, Canadian, Israeli and Thai club and tournament play on March 1, 2006 (or, for school use, the [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerized]] ''[[Official Scrabble Players Dictionary]], Fifth Edition'' (OSPD5)). North American competitions use the ''Long Words List'' for longer words.\n\nThe OWL2 and the OSPD5 are compiled using four (originally five) major college-level dictionaries, including Merriam-Webster (10th and 11th editions, respectively). If a word appears, at least historically, in any one of the dictionaries, it will be included in the OWL2 and the OSPD5. If the word has only an offensive meaning, it is only included in the OWL2. The key difference between the OSPD5 and the OWL2 is that the OSPD5 is marketed for \"home and school\" use, with expurgated words which their source dictionaries judged offensive, rendering the ''Official Scrabble Players Dictionary'' less fit for official ''Scrabble'' play. The OSPD5, released in 2014, is available in bookstores, whereas the OWL2 is only available through [[North American Scrabble Players Association|NASPA]]).\n\n====''Collins Scrabble Words''====\nIn all other English-speaking countries, the competition word list is ''Collins Scrabble Words'' 2019 edition, known as ''CSW19''. Versions of this lexicon prior to 2007 were known as [[SOWPODS]]. The lexicon includes all allowed words of length 2 to 15 letters. This list contains all OWL2 words plus words sourced from Chambers and Collins English dictionaries. This book is used to adjudicate at the [[World Scrabble Championship]] and all other major international competitions outside North America.\n\nTournaments are also occasionally played to CSW in North America, particularly since 2010. [[North American Scrabble Players Association|NASPA]] officially rates CSW tournaments alongside OWL tournaments, using a separate rating system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scrabbleplayers.org/w/SOWPODS|title=SOWPODS - NASPAWiki|publisher=North American Scrabble Players Association}}</ref>\n\n===Challenges===\n{{Main|Challenge (Scrabble)}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}\nThe penalty for a successfully challenged play is nearly universal: the offending player removes the tiles played and forfeits his or her turn. (In some online games, an option known as \"void\" may be used, wherein unacceptable words are automatically rejected by the program. The player is then required to make another play, with no penalty applied.)\n\nThe penalty for an unsuccessful challenge (where all words formed by the play are deemed valid) varies considerably, including:\n* \"Double Challenge\", in which an unsuccessfully challenging player must forfeit the next turn. This penalty governs North American (NASPA-sanctioned) OWL tournament play, and is the standard for North American, Israeli, and Thai clubs.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Because loss of a turn generally constitutes the greatest risk for an unsuccessful challenge, it provides the greatest incentive for a player to \"bluff\", or play a \"phony\" \u2013 a plausible word that they know or suspect to be unacceptable, hoping his or her opponent will not call him on it. Or a player can put down a legal word that appears to be a phony hoping the other player will incorrectly challenge it and lose their turn.\n* \"Single Challenge\"/\"Free Challenge\", in which no penalty whatsoever is applied to a player who unsuccessfully challenges. This is the default rule in Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as for many tournaments in Australia, although these countries do sanction occasional tournaments using other challenge rules.\n* Modified \"Single Challenge\", in which an unsuccessful challenge does not result in the loss of the challenging player's turn, but is penalized by the loss of a specified number of points. The most common penalty is five points. The rule has been adopted in Singapore (since 2000), Malaysia (since 2002), South Africa (since 2003), New Zealand (since 2004), and Kenya, as well as in contemporary [[World Scrabble Championship]]s (since 2001) and North American (NASPA-sanctioned) Collins tournaments, and particularly prestigious Australian tournaments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scrabble.org.au/ratings/selective/2018AMSC.html|title=Australian Masters and State Team Challenge|website=www.scrabble.org.au|access-date=2018-05-01}}</ref> Some countries and tournaments (including Sweden) use a 10-point penalty instead. In most game situations, this penalty is much lower than that of the \"double challenge\" rule. Consequently, such tournaments encourage greater willingness to challenge and discourage playing dubious words.\n\nUnder NASPA tournament rules, a player may request to \"hold\" the opponent's play in order to consider whether to challenge it, provided that the opponent has not yet drawn replacement tiles. If player A holds, player A's clock still runs, and player B may not draw provisional replacement tiles until 15 seconds after the hold was announced (which tiles must then be kept separate). There is no limit on how long player A may hold the play. If player A successfully challenges after player B drew provisional replacement tiles, player B must show the drawn tiles before returning them to the bag.\n\n==Club and tournament play==\n{{Main|English-language Scrabble}}\n\nTens of thousands play club and tournament ''Scrabble'' worldwide. All tournament (and most club) games are played with a [[game clock]] and a set [[time control]]. Although casual games are often played with unlimited time, this is problematic in competitive play among players for whom the number of evident legal plays is immense. Almost all tournament games involve only two players; typically, each has 25 minutes in which to make all of their plays. For each minute by which a player oversteps the time control, a penalty of 10 points is assessed. The number of minutes is rounded up, so, for example, if a player oversteps time control by two minutes and five seconds, the penalty is 30 points. Also, most players use molded plastic tiles, not engraved like the original wooden tiles, eliminating the potential for a cheating player to \"braille\" (feel for particular tiles, especially blanks, in the bag).<ref name=\"slate2012\"/>\n\nPlayers are allowed \"tracking sheets\", pre-printed with the letters in the initial pool, from which tiles can be crossed off as they are played. [[Tile tracking|Tracking tiles]] is an important aid to strategy, especially during the endgame, when no tiles remain to be drawn and each player can determine exactly what is on the opponent's rack.\n\nNotable and regularly held tournaments include:\n# ''The [[World Scrabble Championship]]'': held in odd years up until 2013, when it was announced by [[Mattel]] that it would be called the '''Scrabble Champions Tournament''' and be held annually in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wespa.org/news/2013xchampions.shtml|title=WESPA News: Scrabble Champions Tournament Announcement|publisher=WESPA}}</ref>\n# ''The [[North American Scrabble Championship]]'': an open event attracting several hundred players, held around July\u2013August every year or two in the United States.\n# ''The [[National Scrabble Championship (UK)|National Scrabble Championship]]'', organized by the [[Association of British Scrabble Players]] (ABSP) and held every year in the United Kingdom.\n# ''The [[Brand's Crossword Game King's Cup]]'': the largest tournament in the world.

Held annually since 2006.\n# ''The [[National School Scrabble Championship]]'': entry open to North American school students. Held annually since 2003.\n# ''The [[Canadian Scrabble Championship]]'': entry by invitation only to the top fifty Canadian players. Held every two to three years.\n# ''The [[Singapore Open Scrabble Championship]]'': international Singapore championship held annually since 1997.\n\nClubs in North America typically meet one day a week for three or four hours and some charge a small admission fee to cover their expenses and prizes. Clubs also typically hold at least one open tournament per year. Tournaments are usually held on weekends, and between six and nine games are played each day.\n\nThere are also clubs in the UK and many other countries. There are a number of internationally rated [[SOWPODS]] tournaments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.ozemail.com.au/~rjackman/irsowev.html |title=Internationally Rated SOWPODS Events |publisher=Members.ozemail.com.au |date= |accessdate=2010-04-06}}</ref>\n\nDuring off hours at tournaments, many players socialize by playing consultation (team) ''Scrabble'', [[Clabbers]], [[Anagrams]], [[Boggle]], Words with Friends, Scramble with Friends and other games.\n<!--strategy and tactics excised; DO NOT re-add without sources-->\n\n==Computer players==\n[[Maven (Scrabble)|Maven]] is a computer opponent for the game, created by Brian Sheppard.

Play in this system \"encourages elaborate setups often independently mined by the two players\",<ref name=stevena /> and is significantly different from the standard game in which defensive considerations play a major role. While the \"high score\" rule has led to impressively high records, it is currently out of favor.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n* High game score of 1,049 by Phil Appleby of Lymington, [[Hampshire]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], on June 25, 1989 in Wormley, [[Hertfordshire]], UK. his opponent scored just 253 points, giving Appleby a record victory margin of 796 points.\n* High single-turn score of 392, by Dr. Saladin Karl Khoshnaw<ref name=\"khoshnaw\"/> in [[Manchester]], UK, in April 1982.

Alfapet is now another crossword game, created by the owners of the name Alfapet. A Russian version is called ''Erudit''. Versions have been prepared for [[Dakota language|Dakotah]], [[Haitian Creole]], [[Dakelh]] ([[Carrier language]]), and [[Tuvan language|Tuvan]].<ref>Voinov, Vitaly. 2010. Words should be fun: Scrabble as a tool for language preservation in Tuvan and other local languages. ''[[Language Documentation & Conservation]]'' 4. 213\u2013230.</ref>\n\nFor languages with [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] counted as single letters, such as [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the game features separate tiles for those digraphs.\n\nAn Irish-language version of Scrabble was published by Gl\u00f3r na nGael in 2010. The previous year the same organisation published the Junior version of the game and two years later it republished Junior Scrabble using a two-sided (and two skill level) board.\n\n==Variations==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}\n{{Main|Scrabble variants}}\n\nThere are numerous variations of the game. While they are similar to the original ''Scrabble'' game, they include minor variations. For example, Literati draws random tiles instead of providing a finite number of tiles for the game, assigns different point levels to each letter and has a slightly different board layout, whereas Lexulous assigns eight letters to each player instead of seven. [[Words with Friends]] uses a different board layout and different letter values, as does [[Words of Gold]].\n\n[[File:ScrabbleDuplicate.jpg|thumb|A duplicate ''Scrabble'' tournament in [[La Bresse]], France]]\n[[Duplicate Scrabble]] is a popular variant in [[Francophonie|French speaking countries]]. Every player has the same letters on the same board and the players must submit a paper slip at the end of the allotted time (usually 3 minutes) with the highest scoring word they have found. This is the format used for the [[French World Scrabble Championships]] but it is also used in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. There is no limit to the number of players that can be involved in one game, and at [[Vichy]] in 1998 there were 1485 players, a record for French ''Scrabble'' tournaments.\n\n{{Interlanguage link|Scarabeo|lt=Scarabeo|it|Scarabeo (gioco)|WD=}} is a variant that is much more popular in Italy than the original game. It features a 17\u00d717 grid of cells and peculiar rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.editricegiochi.it/gioco/12/Scarabeo.htm|title=Scarabeo \u2013 Sito ufficiale |publisher=editricegiochi.it|accessdate=October 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn one variation of ''Scrabble'', blanks score points corresponding to the letters the blanks are used to represent. For example, if one played blank to represent a Z, it would get ten; a blank to represent a V or an H would get four; a blank to represent a D would get 2 and blank to represent a T, N, L, S or R or any of the vowels would get one.\n\nPopular among tournament Scrabble players is ''Clabbers''. In Clabbers, any move that consists of anagrams of allowable words is allowed. For example, because ETAERIO is allowable in ordinary Collins Scrabble, EEAIORT would be allowable in Clabbers.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Warren|first1=Jane|url=https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/879354/Allan-Simmons-banned-for-cheating-scrabble |title=Cut-throat world of competitive Scrabble as Allan Simmons is BANNED for cheating|newspaper=The Express|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA junior version, called ''Junior Scrabble'', has been marketed. This has slightly different distributions of frequencies of letter tiles to the standard ''Scrabble'' game.\n\nWord games similar to or influenced by ''Scrabble'' include [[Bananagrams]], [[Boggle]], [[Dabble]], [[Nab-It!]], [[Perquackey]], [[Puzzlage]], [[Quiddler]], [[Scribbage]], [[Tapple]], [[Upwords]], and [[WordSpot]].\n\nThere are also number-based variations, such as [[Equate (game)]], GoSum, Mathable, [[Numble]], Numbler, Triolet, Yushino and Numenko.\n\n==Gameboard formats==\nThe game has been released in numerous gameboard formats appealing to various user groups. The original boards included wood tiles and many \"deluxe\" sets still do.\n\n===Tile Lock Scrabble and Tile Lock Super Scrabble Editions===\nBoth games are made by [[Winning Moves]] and feature smaller, plastic tiles that are held in place on the board with little plastic posts. The standard version features exactly the same 100 tiles as regular ''Scrabble''. The Tile Lock Super Scrabble features the same 200 tiles that are in [[Super Scrabble]].\n\n===Travel editions===\nEditions are available for travelers who may wish to play in a conveyance such as a train or plane, or to pause a game in progress and resume later. Many versions thus include methods to keep letters from moving, such as pegboards, recessed tile holders and magnetic tiles. Players' trays are also designed with stay-fast holders. Such boards are also typically designed to be reoriented by each player to put the board upright during the game, as well as folded and stowed with the game in progress.\n* Production and Marketing Company, 1954 \u2013 metal hinged box, Bakelite tiles inlaid with round magnets, chrome tile racks, silver colored plastic bag and cardboard box covered with decorative paper. The box, when opened flat, measures {{cvt|8+1/2|\u00d7|7+3/4|in|cm}} and the tiles measure {{cvt|1/2|in|mm}} square.\n* Spear's Games, 1980s \u2013 boxed edition with pegboard, plastic tiles with small feet to fit snugly in the pegboard. Racks are clear plastic, allowing some sorting while holding tiles fairly snugly. Set comes with a drawstring plastic bag to draw tiles and a cardboard box. It is possible to save a game in progress by returning the board to the box. There is risk of players' trays being mixed and upset, and the box lid, held on by friction, is subject to upset.\n* Selchow & Righter, 1980s \u2013 pocket edition with plastic \"magnetic\" board and tiles. Tile racks are also plastic with asymmetrical shape to provide handhold. All elements fit in a plastic envelope for travel and to permit a pause in the game. Plastic letters are very small and tend to lose their grip if not placed with slight lateral movement and if they are not perfectly clean. Game format is extremely small, allowing ''Scrabble'' games for backpackers and others concerned about weight and size.\n* Hasbro Games, 2001 \u2013 hinged plastic board with clear tile-shaped depressions to hold tiles in play. Board is in a black, zippered folio such that board and tiles may be folded for travel, even with game in play. Reverse side of board contains numbered mounts for racks, holding tiles face down, allowing secure and confidential storage of tiles while game is paused. Some versions have tile racks with individual tile slots, thus not permitting easy sorting of tiles in rack. The board, when opened up, measures {{cvt|24.5|\u00d7|21.0|cm|in|frac=4}}, and the tiles are {{cvt|12.3|\u00d7|12.3|\u00d7|6.7|mm|in|frac=16}} in size.\n\n===Deluxe editions===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nAt the opposite end, some \"deluxe\" editions offer superior materials and features. These include editions on a rotating turntable, so players can always face the board, with the letters upright and a raised grid that holds the tiles in place. More serious players often favor custom ''Scrabble'' boards, often made of [[acrylic glass]] or [[hardwood]], that have superior rotating mechanisms and personalized graphics.\n\n===Large print edition===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nAn edition has been released (in association with the [[Royal National Institute of Blind People]] (RNIB)) with larger board and letters for players with impaired vision. The colours on the board are more contrasting, and the font size has been increased from 16 to 24 point. The tiles are in bold 48 point.\n\n==Works detailing tournament ''Scrabble''==\nAn introduction to tournament ''Scrabble'' and its players can be found in the book ''[[Word Freak]]'' by [[Stefan Fatsis]]. In the process of writing, Fatsis himself became a high-rated tournament player.\n\nThe ''Scrabble Player's Handbook'', edited by Stewart Holden and written by an international group of tournament players, gives the information a serious player needs to advance to successful tournament play.<ref>{{cite book|title=Scrabble Player's Handbook |publisher=scrabbleplayershandbook.com|url=http://scrabbleplayershandbook.com/}}</ref>\n\nThere have been numerous documentaries made about the game, including:\n* ''[[Scrabylon]]'' (2003), by Scott Petersen, which \"gives an up-close look at why people get so obsessed with that seemingly benign game\"\n* ''[[Word Slingers]]'' (2002), by Eric Siblin and Stefan Vanderland (produced for [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC)), which follows four expert Canadian players at the 2001 World Championship in Las Vegas\n* ''[[Word Wars]]'' (2004) by Eric Chaikin and Julian Petrillo, about the \"tiles and tribulations on the ''Scrabble'' game circuit\"\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anagrams]] Public domain game, predecessor to Scrabble\n* [[Anamonic]]\n* [[Blanagram]]\n* ''[[Boggle]]''\n* [[Countdown (game show)|''Countdown'' (game show)]]\n* [[RSVP (board game)|''RSVP'' (board game)]]\n* [[Scrabble in Hong Kong|''Scrabble'' in Hong Kong]]\n* ''[[Upwords]]''\n* ''[[Words with Friends]]''\n* ''[[Wordscraper]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web|website=The Spruce Crafts|url=https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/win-at-scrabble-words-with-friends-409528|title=How To Win at Scrabble and Words With Friends: How to Practice, Play, and Win Strategically|author=Arneson, Erik|date=June 26, 2019}}\n* {{cite magazine |first=Kevin |last=McElwee |title=Does Scrabble Need To Be Fixed? |magazine=[[Nautilus (science magazine)|Nautilus]] |date=December 13, 2018 |url=http://nautil.us/issue/67/reboot/does-scrabble-need-to-be-fixed }}\n* {{cite web|website=ScholarSpace|url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/4480/voinov.pdf;jsessionid=DE838E2995BAA6E7354F7DEEDEE2043B?sequence=1| title= ''Scrabble'' as a tool for language preservation in Tuvan|location=Manoa, Hawaii}}  An article relating how ''Scrabble'' has been adapted to other languages, describing how it was prepared for the Tuvan languages, and giving directions about how to adapt it.\n* {{cite news|author=Wallace, Robert|work=LIFE Magazine |date=December 14, 1953|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkkEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA92&pg=PA101#v=onepage&q&f=true|title=A Man Makes a Best-Selling Game - ''Scrabble'' - and Achieves His Ambition (Spelled Out Above): Little Business In the Country |page=101}}\n\n==External links==\n<!-- PLEASE do not add links to online play sites. -->\n<!-- This is not a link farm. -->\n{{Commons category}}\n* Hasbro's [http://www.hasbro.com/scrabble/ ''Scrabble'' website] at Hasbro.com\n* Mattel's [http://www.mattelscrabble.com/en/adults/index.html ''Scrabble'' website] at MattelScrabble.com\n<!-- Yes, both are correct. -->\n* [http://www.poslfit.com/scrabble/gcg/ .GCG specification] describes a computer file format for recording and annotating ''Scrabble'' games.\n* [http://www.absp.org.uk Association of British Scrabble Players]\n* [http://www.scrabbleplayers.org North American Scrabble Players Association (NASPA)] (sanctions Club and Tournament play in North America)\n* [http://www.scrabble.org.au/ Scrabble Australia]\n* [http://www.scrabbledb.com Scrabble Word Database (Multi-language)]\n* [http://www.wespa.org/ World English-Language Scrabble Players Association (WESPA)]\n* {{US patent|2752158}} \u2013 ''Game apparatus'' \u2013 This patent used to protect the jagged edges of bonus squares, which were added so that one need not lift previously placed tiles in order to see the bonus.

The game is sold in 121 countries and is available in 29 languages; approximately 150 million sets have been sold worldwide, and roughly one-third of American and half of British homes have a ''Scrabble'' set.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Toys and Games: ''Scrabble'' |website=history.com |url=http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&content_type_id=57162&display_order=4&sub_display_order=4&mini_id=57124 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424165147/http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&content_type_id=57162&display_order=4&sub_display_order=4&mini_id=57124 |archivedate=April 24, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The History of ''Scrabble''\u00ae |website=Mind Sport Olympiad |url=http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/proprietary/scrabble/features/history.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608001552/http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/proprietary/scrabble/features/history.html |archivedate=June 8, 2011 }}</ref><ref name=Burkeman>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jun/28/healthandwellbeing.familyandrelationships |title=Spell bound |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2008-06-28 |location=London |accessdate=2009-01-02}}</ref><ref name=tele/> There are approximately 4,000 Scrabble clubs around the world.<ref name=tele>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3776732/Scrabble-60-facts-for-its-60th-birthday.html|title=Scrabble: 60 facts for its 60th birthday|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=2016-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Game details==\n{{Further|Scrabble letter distributions}}\n[[File:Scrabble game in progress.jpg|thumb|A game of English-language Scrabble in progress]]\nThe game is played by two to four players on a square game board imprinted with a 15\u00d715 grid of cells (individually known as \"squares\"), each of which accommodates a single letter tile.

The number of points for each lettered tile is based on the letter's frequency in standard English; commonly used letters such as vowels are worth one point, while less common letters score higher, with Q and Z each worth 10 points. The game also has two blank tiles that are unmarked and carry no point value. The blank tiles can be used as substitutes for any letter; once laid on the board, however, the choice is fixed. Other language sets use different letter set distributions with different point values.\n\nTiles are usually made of wood or plastic and are {{convert|19|x|19|mm}} square and {{convert|4|mm|abbr=on}} thick, making them slightly smaller than the squares on the board. Only the rosewood tiles of the deluxe edition vary in width up to {{convert|2|mm|2|abbr=on}} for different letters. Travelling versions of the game often have smaller tiles (e.g. {{convert|13|x|13|mm|abbr=on}}); sometimes they are magnetic to keep them in place. The capital letter is printed in black at the centre of the tile face and the letter's point value printed in a smaller font at the bottom right corner.

Q is considered the most troublesome letter, as almost all words with it also contain U; a similar problem occurs in other languages like French, Dutch, Italian and German. J is also difficult to play due to its low frequency and a scarcity of words having it at the end.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scrabblestats.com/?p=105 |title=Letter positions in Scrabble|publisher=scrabblestats.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424075034/http://scrabblestats.com/?p=105 |archivedate=2016-04-24 }}</ref> C and V may be troublesome in the endgame, since no two-letter words with them exist, save for CH in the ''[[Collins Scrabble Words]]'' lexicon.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Alfred Butts letter frequencies.JPG|thumb|right|Alfred Butts manually tabulated the frequency of letters in words of various length, using examples in a dictionary, the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', and ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Tierney, John | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/24/magazine/humankind-battles-for-scrabble-supremacy.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm | title=Humankind Battles for Scrabble Supremacy|work=The New York Times Magazine|date= May 24, 1998}}</ref> This was used to determine the number and scores of tiles in the game.]]\nIn 1938, the American architect [[Alfred Mosher Butts]] created the game as a variation on an earlier word game he invented, called ''[[Lexiko]]''.

(On ''Scrabble'' boards manufactured by Mattel as well as on the [[Internet Scrabble Club]], rows are lettered while columns are numbered instead.) A play is usually identified in the format ''xy WORD score'' or ''WORD xy score'', where ''x'' denotes the column or row on which the play's main word extends, ''y'' denotes the second coordinate of the main word's first letter, and ''WORD'' is the main word. Although it is unnecessary, additional words formed by the play are sometimes listed after the main word and a slash. When the play of a single tile forms words in each direction, one of the words is arbitrarily chosen to serve as the main word for purposes of notation.\n\nWhen a blank tile is employed in the main word, the letter it has been chosen to represent is indicated with a lower case letter, or, in handwritten notation, with a square around the letter. When annotating a play, previously existing letters on the board are usually enclosed in parentheses.\n\nExchanges are often annotated by a minus sign followed by the tiles that were exchanged alphabetically; for example, if a player holds EIIISTU, exchanging two I's and a U would be denoted as \"\u2212IIU.\"\n\nThe image at right gives examples of valid plays and how they would typically be annotated using the notation system.\n\n[[File:Scrabble-example.png|thumb|An example of a Scrabble game in progress using Quackle, an open-source program. The first few plays are JOKED 8D 50, followed by REV(O)TInG E5 94 and YEX# F4 56.]]\n\nAdditionally, a number of symbols have been employed to indicate the validity of words in different lexica:\n* '''<nowiki>*</nowiki>''' means an illegal, or phony, word.\n* '''<nowiki>#</nowiki>''' means a word valid in games using the British-originated word list ([[Collins Scrabble Words|CSW12]]) only.\n* '''$''' means a word valid in games using the American-originated word list ([[Official Tournament and Club Word List|TWL2]]) only.\n* '''!''' means a word judged to be offensive, and thus valid in tournament games only.\n\n===Sequence of play===\nBefore the game, a resource, either a word list or a dictionary, is selected for the purpose of adjudicating any challenges during the game. The tiles are either put in an opaque bag or placed face down on a flat surface. Opaque cloth bags and customized tiles are staples of clubs and tournaments, where games are rarely played without both.\n[[File:Scrabble 2015.jpg|right|thumb|A game of ''Scrabble'' in [[French language|French]]]]\n\nNext, players decide the order in which they play. The normal approach is for players to each draw one tile: The player who picks the letter closest to the beginning of the alphabet goes first, with blank tiles taking precedence over the letter A. In most North American tournaments, the rules of the US-based [[North American Scrabble Players Association]] (NASPA) stipulate instead that players who have gone first in the fewest previous games in the tournament go first, and when that rule yields a tie, those who have gone second the most go first. If there is still a tie, tiles are drawn as in the standard rules.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, each player draws seven tiles from the bag and places them on their rack, concealed from the other player(s).\n\n====Making a play====\nThe first played word must be at least two letters long, and cover H8 (the center square). Thereafter, any move is made by using one or more tiles to place a word on the board. This word may use one or more tiles already on the board and must join with the cluster of tiles already on the board.\n\nOn each turn, the player has three options:\n* Pass, forfeiting the turn and scoring nothing\n* Exchange one or more tiles for an equal number from the bag, scoring nothing, an option available only if at least seven tiles remain in the bag\n* Play at least one tile on the board, adding the value of all words formed to the player's cumulative score\n\nA proper play uses one or more of the player's tiles to form a continuous string of letters that make a word (the play's \"main word\") on the board, reading either left-to-right or top-to-bottom. The main word must either use the letters of one or more previously played words or else have at least one of its tiles horizontally or vertically adjacent to an already played word. If any words other than the main word are formed by the play, they are scored as well and are subject to the same criteria of acceptability. See [[Scrabble#Scoring|Scoring]] for more details.\n\nA blank tile may represent any letter, and scores zero points, regardless of its placement or what letter it represents. Its placement on a double-word or triple-word square causes the corresponding premium to be applied to the word(s) in which it is used. Once a blank tile is placed, it remains that particular letter for the remainder of the game.\n\nAfter making a play, the player announces the score for that play, and then, if the game is being played with a [[Chess clock|clock]], starts the opponent's clock. The player can change their play as long as the player's clock is running, but commits to the play when they start the opponent's clock. The player then draws tiles from the bag to replenish their rack to seven tiles. If there are not enough tiles in the bag to do so, the player takes all the remaining tiles.\n\nIf a player has made a play and has not yet drawn a tile, the opponent may choose to [[Challenge (Scrabble)|challenge]] any or all words formed by the play. The player challenged must then look up the words in question using a specified word source (such as [[Official Tournament and Club Word List|OTCWL]], the ''[[Official Scrabble Players Dictionary]]'', or [[SOWPODS|CSW]]) and if any one of them is found to be unacceptable, the play is removed from the board, the player returns the newly played tiles to their rack, and the turn is forfeited. In tournament play, a challenge may be to the entire play or any one or more words formed in the play, and judges (human or computer) are used, so players are not entitled to know which word(s) are invalid. Penalties for unsuccessfully challenging an acceptable play vary in club and tournament play and are described in greater detail below.\n\n====End of game====\nUnder North American tournament rules, the game ends when either:\n# one player plays every tile on their rack, and there are no tiles remaining in the bag (regardless of the tiles on the opponent's rack)\n# at least six successive scoreless turns have occurred and either player decides to end the game\n# either player uses more than 10 minutes of overtime. (For several years, a game could not end with a cumulative score of 0\u20130, but that is no longer the case, and such games have since occurred a number of times in tournament play, the winner being the player with the lower total point value on their rack.<ref>{{cross-tables player-tournament|pid=560|pname=Marlon Hill|tid=6898|tname=Albany, NY July 2010}}</ref>)\n\nWhen the game ends, each player's score is reduced by the sum of their unplayed letters. In addition, if a player has used all of their letters (known as \"going out\" or \"playing out\"), the sum of the other player's unplayed letters is added to that player's score; in tournament play, a player who goes out adds twice that sum, and their opponent is not penalized.\n\n====Examples====\nPlays can be made in a number of ways (in what follows, it is assumed that the word JACK has been played on a previous turn; letters in parentheses represent tiles already on the board):\n* Adding one or more letters to an existing word, e.g. (JACK)S, HI(JACK), HI(JACK)ING, (JACK)FRUIT.\n* \"Hooking\" a word and playing perpendicular to that word, e.g. playing IONIZES with the S hooked on (JACK) to make (JACK)S.\n* Playing perpendicular to a word, e.g. YEU(K)Y through the K in JACK.\n* Playing parallel to a word(s) forming several short words, e.g. CON played under (JACK) simultaneously forming (J)O and (A)N.\n\nAny combination of these is allowed in a play, as long as all the letters placed on the board in one play lie in one row or column and are connected by a main word, and any run of tiles on two or more consecutive squares along a row or column constitutes a valid word.\n\nWords must read either left-to-right or top-to-bottom. Diagonal plays are not allowed.\n\n===Scoring===\n<div style=\"float: right;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ Premium square colors\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:80px;\"| Square !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:80px;\"| Original and Mattel version !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:80px;\"| Hasbro Version (2008\u20132014)\n|-\n| Double letter\n| style=\"background:#6cf;\"| Light blue\n| style=\"background:#09f;\"| {{white|Blue}}\n|-\n| Triple letter\n| style=\"background:#06f;\"| {{white|Dark blue}}\n| style=\"background:#290;\"| {{white|Green}}\n|-\n| Double word\n| style=\"background:#f9f;\"| Pink\n| style=\"background:#f00;\"| {{white|Red}}\n|-\n| Triple word\n| style=\"background:#f00;\"| {{white|Red}}\n| style=\"background:#f90;\"| {{white|Orange}}\n|}\n</div>\nThe score for any play is determined this way:\n* Each new word formed in a play is scored separately, and then those scores are added up. The value of each tile is indicated on the tile, and blank tiles are worth zero points.\n* The main word (defined as the word containing every played letter) is scored. The letter values of the tiles are added up, and tiles placed on Double Letter Score (DLS) and Triple Letter Score (TLS) squares are doubled or tripled in value, respectively. Tiles placed on Double Word Score (DWS) or Triple Word Score (TWS) squares double or triple the value of the word(s) that include those tiles, respectively. In particular, the center square (H8) is considered a DWS, and the first play is doubled in value.\n* If any \"hook\" words are played (e.g. playing ANEROID while \"hooking\" the A to BETTING to make ABETTING), the scores for each word are added separately. This is common for \"parallel\" plays that make up to eight words in one turn.\n* Premium squares apply only when newly placed tiles cover them. Any subsequent plays do not count those premium squares.\n* If a player covers both letter and word premium squares with a single word, the letter premium(s) is/are calculated first, followed by the word premium(s).\n* If a player makes a play where the main word covers two DWS squares, the value of that word is doubled, then redoubled (i.e. 4\u00d7 the word value). Similarly, if the main word covers two TWS squares, the value of that word is tripled, then retripled (9\u00d7 the word value). Such plays are often referred to as \"double-doubles\" and \"triple-triples\" respectively. It is theoretically possible to achieve a play covering three TWS squares (a 27\u00d7 word score), although this is extremely improbable without constructive setup and collaboration. Plays covering a DWS and a TWS simultaneously (6\u00d7 the word value, or 18\u00d7 if a DWS and two TWS squares are covered) are only possible if a player misses the center star on the first turn, and the play goes unchallenged (this is valid under North American tournament rules).\n* Finally, if seven tiles have been laid on the board in one turn, known as a \"[[bingo (Scrabble)|bingo]]\" in North America and as a \"bonus\" elsewhere, after all of the words formed have been scored, 50 bonus points are added.\n\nWhen the letters to be drawn have run out, the final play can often determine the winner. This is particularly the case in close games with more than two players.\n\nScoreless turns can occur when a player passes, exchanges tiles, or loses a challenge. The latter rule varies slightly in international tournaments. A scoreless turn can also theoretically occur if a play consists of only blank tiles, but this is extremely unlikely in actual play.\n\n====Example====\nSuppose Player 1 plays QUANT 8D, with the Q on a DLS and T on the center star. The score for this play would be (2 \u00d7 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) \u00d7 2 = 48 (following the [[order of operations]]).\n\nPlayer 2 extends the play to ALI(QUANT) 8A with the A on the TWS at 8A. The score for this play would be (1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) \u00d7 3 = 51. Note that the Q is not doubled for this play.\n\nPlayer 1 has DDIIIOO and plays OIDIOID 9G. The score for the word OIDIOID would be (2 \u00d7 1 + 1 + 2 \u00d7 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 \u00d7 2) = 14. Additionally, Player 1 formed NO and TI, which score 1 + 2 \u00d7 1 = 3 and 1 + 1 = 2 points respectively. Therefore, the sum of all the values of the words formed is 14+3+2 = 19. But since this is a seven-letter play, 50 points are added, resulting in a total score of 69. Player 1 now has a 117\u201351 lead.\n\nThe player with the highest final score wins the game. In case of a tie, the player with the highest score before adjusting for unplayed tiles wins the game. In tournament play, a tie counts as 1/2 a win for both players.\n\n===Acceptable words===\nAcceptable words are the primary entries in some chosen [[dictionary]], and all of their [[inflection|inflected]] forms. Words that are hyphenated, capitalized (such as [[proper noun]]s), or apostrophized are not allowed, unless they also appear as acceptable entries; JACK is a proper noun, but the word ''[[wikt:jack|JACK]]'' is acceptable because it has other usages as a common noun (automotive, [[vexillology|vexillological]], etc.) and verb that are acceptable. Acronyms or abbreviations, other than those that have acceptable entries (such as ''[[AWOL]]'', ''[[RADAR]]'', ''[[LASER]]'', and ''[[Scuba diving|SCUBA]]'') are not allowed. Variant spellings, slang or offensive terms, archaic or obsolete terms, and specialized jargon words are allowed if they meet all other criteria for acceptability, but archaic spellings (e.g. ''NEEDE'' for ''NEED'') are generally not allowed. Foreign words are not allowed in English-language ''Scrabble'' unless they have been incorporated into the English language, as with PATISSERIE, KILIM, and QI. Vulgar and offensive words are generally excluded from the OSPD4 but allowed in club and tournament play.\n\nProper nouns and other exceptions to the usual rules are allowed in some limited contexts in the spin-off game [[Trickster (board game)|''Scrabble Trickster'']]. Names of recognized computer programs are permitted as an acceptable proper noun (For example, WinZIP).\n\nThe memorization of two-letter words is considered an essential skill in this game.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title=[Loopful] Two Letter Words Allowed In Scrabble |publisher=Word Buff\n|url=http://www.word-buff.com/two-letter-words.html\n|accessdate=2015-06-08\n }}\n</ref>\n\n[[File:PocketScrabble.JPG|thumb|left|250 px|A near-ending game board, tiles and racks of the magnetic Pocket ''Scrabble'' (International, Mattel, Inc.)]]\n\nThere are two popular competition word lists used in various parts of the world:\n* [[Tournament Word List|TWL]] (also known as OTCWL, OWL, or TWL)\n* [[SOWPODS]] (also called \"Collins\" or \"CSW\")\nThe first is used in America, Canada, Israel and Thailand, and the second in all other English-speaking countries\n\n====TWL, OWL2 and OSPD5====\nThe North American 2006 ''[[Official Tournament and Club Word List]], Second Edition'' (OWL2) went into official use in American, Canadian, Israeli and Thai club and tournament play on March 1, 2006 (or, for school use, the [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerized]] ''[[Official Scrabble Players Dictionary]], Fifth Edition'' (OSPD5)). North American competitions use the ''Long Words List'' for longer words.\n\nThe OWL2 and the OSPD5 are compiled using four (originally five) major college-level dictionaries, including Merriam-Webster (10th and 11th editions, respectively). If a word appears, at least historically, in any one of the dictionaries, it will be included in the OWL2 and the OSPD5. If the word has only an offensive meaning, it is only included in the OWL2. The key difference between the OSPD5 and the OWL2 is that the OSPD5 is marketed for \"home and school\" use, with expurgated words which their source dictionaries judged offensive, rendering the ''Official Scrabble Players Dictionary'' less fit for official ''Scrabble'' play. The OSPD5, released in 2014, is available in bookstores, whereas the OWL2 is only available through [[North American Scrabble Players Association|NASPA]]).\n\n====''Collins Scrabble Words''====\nIn all other English-speaking countries, the competition word list is ''Collins Scrabble Words'' 2019 edition, known as ''CSW19''. Versions of this lexicon prior to 2007 were known as [[SOWPODS]]. The lexicon includes all allowed words of length 2 to 15 letters. This list contains all OWL2 words plus words sourced from Chambers and Collins English dictionaries. This book is used to adjudicate at the [[World Scrabble Championship]] and all other major international competitions outside North America.\n\nTournaments are also occasionally played to CSW in North America, particularly since 2010. [[North American Scrabble Players Association|NASPA]] officially rates CSW tournaments alongside OWL tournaments, using a separate rating system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scrabbleplayers.org/w/SOWPODS|title=SOWPODS - NASPAWiki|publisher=North American Scrabble Players Association}}</ref>\n\n===Challenges===\n{{Main|Challenge (Scrabble)}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}\nThe penalty for a successfully challenged play is nearly universal: the offending player removes the tiles played and forfeits his or her turn. (In some online games, an option known as \"void\" may be used, wherein unacceptable words are automatically rejected by the program. The player is then required to make another play, with no penalty applied.)\n\nThe penalty for an unsuccessful challenge (where all words formed by the play are deemed valid) varies considerably, including:\n* \"Double Challenge\", in which an unsuccessfully challenging player must forfeit the next turn. This penalty governs North American (NASPA-sanctioned) OWL tournament play, and is the standard for North American, Israeli, and Thai clubs.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Because loss of a turn generally constitutes the greatest risk for an unsuccessful challenge, it provides the greatest incentive for a player to \"bluff\", or play a \"phony\" \u2013 a plausible word that they know or suspect to be unacceptable, hoping his or her opponent will not call him on it. Or a player can put down a legal word that appears to be a phony hoping the other player will incorrectly challenge it and lose their turn.\n* \"Single Challenge\"/\"Free Challenge\", in which no penalty whatsoever is applied to a player who unsuccessfully challenges. This is the default rule in Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as for many tournaments in Australia, although these countries do sanction occasional tournaments using other challenge rules.\n* Modified \"Single Challenge\", in which an unsuccessful challenge does not result in the loss of the challenging player's turn, but is penalized by the loss of a specified number of points. The most common penalty is five points. The rule has been adopted in Singapore (since 2000), Malaysia (since 2002), South Africa (since 2003), New Zealand (since 2004), and Kenya, as well as in contemporary [[World Scrabble Championship]]s (since 2001) and North American (NASPA-sanctioned) Collins tournaments, and particularly prestigious Australian tournaments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scrabble.org.au/ratings/selective/2018AMSC.html|title=Australian Masters and State Team Challenge|website=www.scrabble.org.au|access-date=2018-05-01}}</ref> Some countries and tournaments (including Sweden) use a 10-point penalty instead. In most game situations, this penalty is much lower than that of the \"double challenge\" rule. Consequently, such tournaments encourage greater willingness to challenge and discourage playing dubious words.\n\nUnder NASPA tournament rules, a player may request to \"hold\" the opponent's play in order to consider whether to challenge it, provided that the opponent has not yet drawn replacement tiles. If player A holds, player A's clock still runs, and player B may not draw provisional replacement tiles until 15 seconds after the hold was announced (which tiles must then be kept separate). There is no limit on how long player A may hold the play. If player A successfully challenges after player B drew provisional replacement tiles, player B must show the drawn tiles before returning them to the bag.\n\n==Club and tournament play==\n{{Main|English-language Scrabble}}\n\nTens of thousands play club and tournament ''Scrabble'' worldwide. All tournament (and most club) games are played with a [[game clock]] and a set [[time control]]. Although casual games are often played with unlimited time, this is problematic in competitive play among players for whom the number of evident legal plays is immense. Almost all tournament games involve only two players; typically, each has 25 minutes in which to make all of their plays. For each minute by which a player oversteps the time control, a penalty of 10 points is assessed. The number of minutes is rounded up, so, for example, if a player oversteps time control by two minutes and five seconds, the penalty is 30 points. Also, most players use molded plastic tiles, not engraved like the original wooden tiles, eliminating the potential for a cheating player to \"braille\" (feel for particular tiles, especially blanks, in the bag).<ref name=\"slate2012\"/>\n\nPlayers are allowed \"tracking sheets\", pre-printed with the letters in the initial pool, from which tiles can be crossed off as they are played. [[Tile tracking|Tracking tiles]] is an important aid to strategy, especially during the endgame, when no tiles remain to be drawn and each player can determine exactly what is on the opponent's rack.\n\nNotable and regularly held tournaments include:\n# ''The [[World Scrabble Championship]]'': held in odd years up until 2013, when it was announced by [[Mattel]] that it would be called the '''Scrabble Champions Tournament''' and be held annually in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wespa.org/news/2013xchampions.shtml|title=WESPA News: Scrabble Champions Tournament Announcement|publisher=WESPA}}</ref>\n# ''The [[North American Scrabble Championship]]'': an open event attracting several hundred players, held around July\u2013August every year or two in the United States.\n# ''The [[National Scrabble Championship (UK)|National Scrabble Championship]]'', organized by the [[Association of British Scrabble Players]] (ABSP) and held every year in the United Kingdom.\n# ''The [[Brand's Crossword Game King's Cup]]'': the largest tournament in the world. Held annually in Thailand around the end of June or beginning of July.\n# ''The [[UK Open (Scrabble)|UK Open]]'': the largest Scrabble tournament in Europe, held annually in [[Coventry]], United Kingdom since 2008.\n\nOther important tournaments include:\n# ''The [[World Youth Scrabble Championships]]'': entry by country qualification, restricted to under 18 years old. Held annually since 2006.\n# ''The [[National School Scrabble Championship]]'': entry open to North American school students. Held annually since 2003.\n# ''The [[Canadian Scrabble Championship]]'': entry by invitation only to the top fifty Canadian players. Held every two to three years.\n# ''The [[Singapore Open Scrabble Championship]]'': international Singapore championship held annually since 1997.\n\nClubs in North America typically meet one day a week for three or four hours and some charge a small admission fee to cover their expenses and prizes. Clubs also typically hold at least one open tournament per year. Tournaments are usually held on weekends, and between six and nine games are played each day.\n\nThere are also clubs in the UK and many other countries. There are a number of internationally rated [[SOWPODS]] tournaments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.ozemail.com.au/~rjackman/irsowev.html |title=Internationally Rated SOWPODS Events |publisher=Members.ozemail.com.au |date= |accessdate=2010-04-06}}</ref>\n\nDuring off hours at tournaments, many players socialize by playing consultation (team) ''Scrabble'', [[Clabbers]], [[Anagrams]], [[Boggle]], Words with Friends, Scramble with Friends and other games.\n<!--strategy and tactics excised; DO NOT re-add without sources-->\n\n==Computer players==\n[[Maven (Scrabble)|Maven]] is a computer opponent for the game, created by Brian Sheppard.

Play in this system \"encourages elaborate setups often independently mined by the two players\",<ref name=stevena /> and is significantly different from the standard game in which defensive considerations play a major role. While the \"high score\" rule has led to impressively high records, it is currently out of favor.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n* High game score of 1,049 by Phil Appleby of Lymington, [[Hampshire]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], on June 25, 1989 in Wormley, [[Hertfordshire]], UK. his opponent scored just 253 points, giving Appleby a record victory margin of 796 points.\n* High single-turn score of 392, by Dr. Saladin Karl Khoshnaw<ref name=\"khoshnaw\"/> in [[Manchester]], UK, in April 1982.

Alfapet is now another crossword game, created by the owners of the name Alfapet. A Russian version is called ''Erudit''. Versions have been prepared for [[Dakota language|Dakotah]], [[Haitian Creole]], [[Dakelh]] ([[Carrier language]]), and [[Tuvan language|Tuvan]].<ref>Voinov, Vitaly. 2010. Words should be fun: Scrabble as a tool for language preservation in Tuvan and other local languages. ''[[Language Documentation & Conservation]]'' 4. 213\u2013230.</ref>\n\nFor languages with [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] counted as single letters, such as [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the game features separate tiles for those digraphs.\n\nAn Irish-language version of Scrabble was published by Gl\u00f3r na nGael in 2010. The previous year the same organisation published the Junior version of the game and two years later it republished Junior Scrabble using a two-sided (and two skill level) board.\n\n==Variations==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}\n{{Main|Scrabble variants}}\n\nThere are numerous variations of the game. While they are similar to the original ''Scrabble'' game, they include minor variations. For example, Literati draws random tiles instead of providing a finite number of tiles for the game, assigns different point levels to each letter and has a slightly different board layout, whereas Lexulous assigns eight letters to each player instead of seven. [[Words with Friends]] uses a different board layout and different letter values, as does [[Words of Gold]].\n\n[[File:ScrabbleDuplicate.jpg|thumb|A duplicate ''Scrabble'' tournament in [[La Bresse]], France]]\n[[Duplicate Scrabble]] is a popular variant in [[Francophonie|French speaking countries]]. Every player has the same letters on the same board and the players must submit a paper slip at the end of the allotted time (usually 3 minutes) with the highest scoring word they have found. This is the format used for the [[French World Scrabble Championships]] but it is also used in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. There is no limit to the number of players that can be involved in one game, and at [[Vichy]] in 1998 there were 1485 players, a record for French ''Scrabble'' tournaments.\n\n{{Interlanguage link|Scarabeo|lt=Scarabeo|it|Scarabeo (gioco)|WD=}} is a variant that is much more popular in Italy than the original game. It features a 17\u00d717 grid of cells and peculiar rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.editricegiochi.it/gioco/12/Scarabeo.htm|title=Scarabeo \u2013 Sito ufficiale |publisher=editricegiochi.it|accessdate=October 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn one variation of ''Scrabble'', blanks score points corresponding to the letters the blanks are used to represent. For example, if one played blank to represent a Z, it would get ten; a blank to represent a V or an H would get four; a blank to represent a D would get 2 and blank to represent a T, N, L, S or R or any of the vowels would get one.\n\nPopular among tournament Scrabble players is ''Clabbers''. In Clabbers, any move that consists of anagrams of allowable words is allowed. For example, because ETAERIO is allowable in ordinary Collins Scrabble, EEAIORT would be allowable in Clabbers.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Warren|first1=Jane|url=https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/879354/Allan-Simmons-banned-for-cheating-scrabble |title=Cut-throat world of competitive Scrabble as Allan Simmons is BANNED for cheating|newspaper=The Express|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA junior version, called ''Junior Scrabble'', has been marketed. This has slightly different distributions of frequencies of letter tiles to the standard ''Scrabble'' game.\n\nWord games similar to or influenced by ''Scrabble'' include [[Bananagrams]], [[Boggle]], [[Dabble]], [[Nab-It!]], [[Perquackey]], [[Puzzlage]], [[Quiddler]], [[Scribbage]], [[Tapple]], [[Upwords]], and [[WordSpot]].\n\nThere are also number-based variations, such as [[Equate (game)]], GoSum, Mathable, [[Numble]], Numbler, Triolet, Yushino and Numenko.\n\n==Gameboard formats==\nThe game has been released in numerous gameboard formats appealing to various user groups. The original boards included wood tiles and many \"deluxe\" sets still do.\n\n===Tile Lock Scrabble and Tile Lock Super Scrabble Editions===\nBoth games are made by [[Winning Moves]] and feature smaller, plastic tiles that are held in place on the board with little plastic posts. The standard version features exactly the same 100 tiles as regular ''Scrabble''. The Tile Lock Super Scrabble features the same 200 tiles that are in [[Super Scrabble]].\n\n===Travel editions===\nEditions are available for travelers who may wish to play in a conveyance such as a train or plane, or to pause a game in progress and resume later. Many versions thus include methods to keep letters from moving, such as pegboards, recessed tile holders and magnetic tiles. Players' trays are also designed with stay-fast holders. Such boards are also typically designed to be reoriented by each player to put the board upright during the game, as well as folded and stowed with the game in progress.\n* Production and Marketing Company, 1954 \u2013 metal hinged box, Bakelite tiles inlaid with round magnets, chrome tile racks, silver colored plastic bag and cardboard box covered with decorative paper. The box, when opened flat, measures {{cvt|8+1/2|\u00d7|7+3/4|in|cm}} and the tiles measure {{cvt|1/2|in|mm}} square.\n* Spear's Games, 1980s \u2013 boxed edition with pegboard, plastic tiles with small feet to fit snugly in the pegboard. Racks are clear plastic, allowing some sorting while holding tiles fairly snugly. Set comes with a drawstring plastic bag to draw tiles and a cardboard box. It is possible to save a game in progress by returning the board to the box. There is risk of players' trays being mixed and upset, and the box lid, held on by friction, is subject to upset.\n* Selchow & Righter, 1980s \u2013 pocket edition with plastic \"magnetic\" board and tiles. Tile racks are also plastic with asymmetrical shape to provide handhold. All elements fit in a plastic envelope for travel and to permit a pause in the game. Plastic letters are very small and tend to lose their grip if not placed with slight lateral movement and if they are not perfectly clean. Game format is extremely small, allowing ''Scrabble'' games for backpackers and others concerned about weight and size.\n* Hasbro Games, 2001 \u2013 hinged plastic board with clear tile-shaped depressions to hold tiles in play. Board is in a black, zippered folio such that board and tiles may be folded for travel, even with game in play. Reverse side of board contains numbered mounts for racks, holding tiles face down, allowing secure and confidential storage of tiles while game is paused. Some versions have tile racks with individual tile slots, thus not permitting easy sorting of tiles in rack. The board, when opened up, measures {{cvt|24.5|\u00d7|21.0|cm|in|frac=4}}, and the tiles are {{cvt|12.3|\u00d7|12.3|\u00d7|6.7|mm|in|frac=16}} in size.\n\n===Deluxe editions===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nAt the opposite end, some \"deluxe\" editions offer superior materials and features. These include editions on a rotating turntable, so players can always face the board, with the letters upright and a raised grid that holds the tiles in place. More serious players often favor custom ''Scrabble'' boards, often made of [[acrylic glass]] or [[hardwood]], that have superior rotating mechanisms and personalized graphics.\n\n===Large print edition===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nAn edition has been released (in association with the [[Royal National Institute of Blind People]] (RNIB)) with larger board and letters for players with impaired vision. The colours on the board are more contrasting, and the font size has been increased from 16 to 24 point. The tiles are in bold 48 point.\n\n==Works detailing tournament ''Scrabble''==\nAn introduction to tournament ''Scrabble'' and its players can be found in the book ''[[Word Freak]]'' by [[Stefan Fatsis]]. In the process of writing, Fatsis himself became a high-rated tournament player.\n\nThe ''Scrabble Player's Handbook'', edited by Stewart Holden and written by an international group of tournament players, gives the information a serious player needs to advance to successful tournament play.<ref>{{cite book|title=Scrabble Player's Handbook |publisher=scrabbleplayershandbook.com|url=http://scrabbleplayershandbook.com/}}</ref>\n\nThere have been numerous documentaries made about the game, including:\n* ''[[Scrabylon]]'' (2003), by Scott Petersen, which \"gives an up-close look at why people get so obsessed with that seemingly benign game\"\n* ''[[Word Slingers]]'' (2002), by Eric Siblin and Stefan Vanderland (produced for [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC)), which follows four expert Canadian players at the 2001 World Championship in Las Vegas\n* ''[[Word Wars]]'' (2004) by Eric Chaikin and Julian Petrillo, about the \"tiles and tribulations on the ''Scrabble'' game circuit\"\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anagrams]] Public domain game, predecessor to Scrabble\n* [[Anamonic]]\n* [[Blanagram]]\n* ''[[Boggle]]''\n* [[Countdown (game show)|''Countdown'' (game show)]]\n* [[RSVP (board game)|''RSVP'' (board game)]]\n* [[Scrabble in Hong Kong|''Scrabble'' in Hong Kong]]\n* ''[[Upwords]]''\n* ''[[Words with Friends]]''\n* ''[[Wordscraper]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web|website=The Spruce Crafts|url=https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/win-at-scrabble-words-with-friends-409528|title=How To Win at Scrabble and Words With Friends: How to Practice, Play, and Win Strategically|author=Arneson, Erik|date=June 26, 2019}}\n* {{cite magazine |first=Kevin |last=McElwee |title=Does Scrabble Need To Be Fixed? |magazine=[[Nautilus (science magazine)|Nautilus]] |date=December 13, 2018 |url=http://nautil.us/issue/67/reboot/does-scrabble-need-to-be-fixed }}\n* {{cite web|website=ScholarSpace|url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/4480/voinov.pdf;jsessionid=DE838E2995BAA6E7354F7DEEDEE2043B?sequence=1| title= ''Scrabble'' as a tool for language preservation in Tuvan|location=Manoa, Hawaii}}  An article relating how ''Scrabble'' has been adapted to other languages, describing how it was prepared for the Tuvan languages, and giving directions about how to adapt it.\n* {{cite news|author=Wallace, Robert|work=LIFE Magazine |date=December 14, 1953|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkkEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA92&pg=PA101#v=onepage&q&f=true|title=A Man Makes a Best-Selling Game - ''Scrabble'' - and Achieves His Ambition (Spelled Out Above): Little Business In the Country |page=101}}\n\n==External links==\n<!-- PLEASE do not add links to online play sites. -->\n<!-- This is not a link farm. -->\n{{Commons category}}\n* Hasbro's [http://www.hasbro.com/scrabble/ ''Scrabble'' website] at Hasbro.com\n* Mattel's [http://www.mattelscrabble.com/en/adults/index.html ''Scrabble'' website] at MattelScrabble.com\n<!-- Yes, both are correct. -->\n* [http://www.poslfit.com/scrabble/gcg/ .GCG specification] describes a computer file format for recording and annotating ''Scrabble'' games.\n* [http://www.absp.org.uk Association of British Scrabble Players]\n* [http://www.scrabbleplayers.org North American Scrabble Players Association (NASPA)] (sanctions Club and Tournament play in North America)\n* [http://www.scrabble.org.au/ Scrabble Australia]\n* [http://www.scrabbledb.com Scrabble Word Database (Multi-language)]\n* [http://www.wespa.org/ World English-Language Scrabble Players Association (WESPA)]\n* {{US patent|2752158}} \u2013 ''Game apparatus'' \u2013 This patent used to protect the jagged edges of bonus squares, which were added so that one need not lift previously placed tiles in order to see the bonus.

Her father, \u00c5ke Moberg was an accountant, and her mother Margot Lundblad was an amateur painter. Gunnie left school at the age of 16 in order to pursue artistic photography.\n\nShe began by working at a photographer's studio in Gothenburg but moved to Edinburgh, Scotland a year later. In Edinburgh, she worked as an au pair and studied pottery at the [[Edinburgh College of Art]], where she met Californian artist [[Tam MacPhail]]. They married in January 1961<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12448550.gunnie-moberg/|title=Gunnie Moberg|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref> and had four sons.

Between 1977 and 1979, the [[St Magnus Festival]] and the [[Pier Arts Centre]] were established. The St Magnus Festival appointed her photographer in residence, a role that she held for nearly thirty years.\n\nHer popularity as a photographer grew through the years, but she turned to painting in her later years. She passed away at the age of 66 in Stromness.\n\n== Artistic Work ==\nMorberg's first publication was ''[[Stone Built]]'' in 1979. In this book, the photographer collected 18 aerial pictures she took across Orkney<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gunniemobergarchive.wordpress.com/publications/stone-built/|title=Stone Built|date=2014-07-17|website=The Gunnie Moberg Archive|language=en|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref>. She subsequently published a number of photography books. Her main subjects were the landscapes of the North Atlantic.\n\nIn 1986 Moberg started a collaboration with the poet [[George Mackay Brown]]. Together, they published five books in which Moberg's photographs interweaved with George Mackay Brown's poetry. She also collaborated with the Norwegian author [[Liv Kj\u00f8rsvik Schei]].

Her work includes photographs featuring the Orkney, [[Shetland]], and [[Faroe Islands]].\n\n== Personal Life ==\nGunnie Morberg was born on 8th of May 1941 in Sweden [[Gothenburg]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=The new biographical dictionary of Scottish women|publisher=|others=Ewan, Elizabeth|year=|isbn=978-1-4744-3629-8|location=Edinburgh|pages=322|oclc=1057237368}}</ref>. Her father, \u00c5ke Moberg was an accountant, and her mother Margot Lundblad was an amateur painter. Gunnie left school at the age of 16 in order to pursue artistic photography.\n\nShe began by working at a photographer's studio in Gothenburg but moved to Edinburgh, Scotland a year later. In Edinburgh, she worked as an au pair and studied pottery at the [[Edinburgh College of Art]], where she met Californian artist [[Tam MacPhail]]. They married in January 1961<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12448550.gunnie-moberg/|title=Gunnie Moberg|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref> and had four sons. They initially settled in Argyll but later on, moved to Orkney in 1976<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kettlesyard.co.uk/collection-artist/tam-macphail/|title=Tam MacPhail \u2013 Collection Database|website=Kettle's Yard|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref>, after Gunnie Moberg's visit in 1975. \n\nHer husband ran a bookshop in [[Stromness]] called 'Stromness Books & Prints', which published her first photography book in 1979. Between 1977 and 1979, the [[St Magnus Festival]] and the [[Pier Arts Centre]] were established. The St Magnus Festival appointed her photographer in residence, a role that she held for nearly thirty years.\n\nHer popularity as a photographer grew through the years, but she turned to painting in her later years. She passed away at the age of 66 in Stromness.\n\n== Artistic Work ==\nMorberg's first publication was ''[[Stone Built]]'' in 1979. In this book, the photographer collected 18 aerial pictures she took across Orkney<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gunniemobergarchive.wordpress.com/publications/stone-built/|title=Stone Built|date=2014-07-17|website=The Gunnie Moberg Archive|language=en|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref>. She subsequently published a number of photography books. Her main subjects were the landscapes of the North Atlantic.\n\nIn 1986 Moberg started a collaboration with the poet [[George Mackay Brown]]. Together, they published five books in which Moberg's photographs interweaved with George Mackay Brown's poetry. She also collaborated with the Norwegian author [[Liv Kj\u00f8rsvik Schei]]. This collaboration gave birth to ''The Orkney Story'' (1985) and ''The Shetland Story'' (1988).\n\n== Publications ==\n* 1979: ''Stone Built''. Stormness Books & Prints\n* 1985: ''The Orkney Story''.

{"title_page": "Valentinianism", "text_new": "{{Gnosticism}}\n'''Valentinianism''' was one of the major [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] Christian movements. Founded by [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] in the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|second century AD]], its influence spread widely, not just within Rome, but also from Northwest Africa to Egypt through to Asia Minor and Syria in the east.<ref>Green 1985, 244</ref>\n\nLater in the movement's history it broke into an Eastern and a Western school. Disciples of Valentinus continued to be active into the 4th century AD, after the [[Roman Empire]] was declared to be [[Christians|Christian]].<ref>Green 1985, 245</ref>\n\nThe doctrine, practices and beliefs of Valentinus and the Gnostic movement that bore his name were condemned as heretical by proto-orthodox church leaders and scholars. Prominent [[Church Fathers]] such as [[Irenaeus of Lyons]] and [[Hippolytus of Rome]] wrote against Gnosticism. Because early church leaders encouraged the destruction of Gnostic texts, most evidence for the Valentinian theory comes from its critics and detractors, most notably Irenaeus, since he was especially concerned with refuting Valentinianism.<ref>Wilson 1958, 133</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] was born in approximately 100 AD and died in [[Alexandria]] circa 180 AD.<ref name=\"Holroyd 1994, 32\">Holroyd 1994, 32</ref> According to the Christian scholar [[Epiphanius of Salamis]], he was born in [[Egypt]] and schooled in Alexandria, where the Gnostic [[Basilides]] was teaching. However [[Clement of Alexandria]] (c.150{{snd}}c.215), another Christian scholar and teacher, reports that Valentinus was taught by [[Theudas (teacher of Valentinius)|Theudas]], a disciple of the apostle [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]].<ref name=\"Roukema 1998, 129\">Roukema 1998, 129</ref> He was reputed to be an extremely eloquent man who possessed a great deal of charisma and had an innate ability to attract people.<ref>Churton 1987, 53</ref> He went to [[Rome]] some time between AD 136 and 140, in the time of [[Pope Hyginus]], and had risen to the peak of his teaching career between AD 150 and 155, during the time of [[Pope Pius I|Pius]].<ref>Filoramo 1990, 166</ref>\n\nValentinus is said to have been a very successful teacher, and for some time in the mid-2nd century he was even a prominent and well-respected member of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] community in Rome. At one point during his career he had even hoped to attain the office of bishop, and apparently it was after he was passed over for the position that he broke from the Catholic Church.<ref name=\"Roukema 1998, 129\"/> Valentinus was said to have been a prolific writer; however, the only surviving remains of his work come from quotes that have been transmitted by Clement of Alexandria, [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] and [[Marcellus of Ancyra]]. Most scholars also believe that Valentinus wrote the [[Gospel of Truth]], one of the [[Nag Hammadi library|Nag Hammadi text]]s.<ref name=\"Holroyd 1994, 32\"/>\n\nNotable Valentinians included [[Heracleon]] (fl. ca. 175), [[Ptolemy (gnostic)|Ptolemy]], Florinus, Axionicus and [[Theodotus of Byzantium|Theodotus]].\n\n==The Valentinian system==\n\nThe theology that Irenaeus attributed to Valentinus is extremely complicated and difficult to follow. There is some skepticism among scholars that the system actually originated with him, and many believe that the system Irenaeus was counteracting was the construct of later Valentinians.\n\n===Synopsis===\nAccording to Irenaeus, the Valentinians believed that at the beginning there was a [[Pleroma]] (literally, a 'fullness'). At the centre of the Pleroma was the primal Father or ''[[Bythos]]'', the beginning of all things who, after ages of silence and contemplation, projected thirty ''[[Aeon]]s'', heavenly archetypes representing fifteen [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|syzygies]] or sexually complementary pairs. Among them was ''[[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]]''. Sophia's weakness, curiosity and passion led to her fall from the Pleroma and the creation of the world and man, both of which are flawed. Valentinians identified the [[God]] of the [[Old Testament]] as the [[Demiurge]],<ref>Goodrick-Clarke 2002, 182</ref> the imperfect creator of the material world. Man, the highest being in this material world, participates in both the spiritual and the material nature. The work of redemption consists in freeing the former from the latter. One needed to recognize the Father, the ''depth of all being'', as the true source of divine power in order to achieve ''gnosis'' (knowledge).<ref>Pagels 1979, 37</ref> The Valentinians believed that the attainment of this knowledge by the human individual had positive consequences within the universal order and contributed to restoring that order,<ref>Holroyd 1994, 37</ref> and that gnosis, not faith, was the key to salvation. Clement wrote that the Valentinians regarded Catholic Christians \"as simple people to whom they attributed faith, while they think that gnosis is in themselves. Through the excellent seed that is to be found in them, they are by nature redeemed, and their gnosis is as far removed from faith as the spiritual from the physical\".<ref>Roukema 1998, 130</ref>\n\n===Aeons===\nThe superstructure of the celestial system, the celestial world of Aeons, is here developed in the most complicated way.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|pp=853-854}} These Aeons belong to the purely ideal, noumenal, intelligible, or supersensible world; they are immaterial, they are [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostatic]] ideas. Together with the source from which they emanate they form the Pleroma. The transition from the immaterial to the material, from the noumenal to the sensible, is brought about by a flaw, or a passion, or a sin, in the female Aeon Sophia.\n\n[[Image:aeons.png|600px|center|Scheme of the Aeons]]\n\n[[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] alleges that the Valentinians \"set forth their thirty aeons in mythologic fashion, thinking that they conformed to the years of Jesus\".<ref>Mead 1903, 396.</ref> Of the eight celestial beings of the ''[[Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|Ogdoad]],'' four are peculiar to the Valentinian system. The third pair of Aeons, ''[[Logos]]'' and ''Zoe,'' occur only here, and the place of this pair is not firmly established, and occur sometimes before and sometimes after the fourth pair of Aeons, the ''Anthropos'' and the ''Ekklesia''. We cannot be far wrong in suspecting that Valentinus was influenced by the prologue of the [[fourth Gospel]] (we also find the probably [[Johannine]] names ''Monogenes'' and ''[[Paraclete|Parakletos]]'' in the series of Aeons).{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}\n\n===Sophia===\nIn Valentinianism, Sophia always stands absolutely at the center of the system, and in some sense she seems to represent the supreme female principle.\n\nSophia is the youngest of the Aeons. Observing the multitude of Aeons and the power of begetting them, she hurries back into the depth of the Father, and seeks to emulate him by producing offspring without conjugal intercourse, but only projects an abortion, a formless substance. Upon this she is cast out of Pleroma and into the primal sub-stratum of matter.<ref>Irenaeus i. 29</ref> In the Valentinian systems, the fall of Sophia appears in double guise. The higher Sophia still remains within the upper world after creating a disturbance, and after her expiation and repentance; but her premature offspring, ''Sophia Achamoth'', is removed from the Pleroma, and becomes the heroine of the rest of the drama.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}} This fallen Sophia becomes a world creative power.\n\n[[File:Valentinianpleroma-Matter.png|thumb|right|320px|Pl\u00e9rome de Valentin, from ''Histoire critique du Gnosticisme;'' Jacques Matter, 1826, Vol. II, Plate II.]]\nSophia Achamoth, or \"Lower Wisdom\", the daughter of \"Higher Wisdom\", becomes the mother of the Demiurge, identified with the God of the Old Testament. <!--She dwells in the eighth heaven, the ''Ogdoad''; above her stands the Pleroma; below in the [[Seventh Heaven|seven lower heavens]] of the ''Hebdomad'' reign the seven planetary, world-creating [[Archons]].-->\n\nThe Gnostics are children of Sophia; from her the heavenly seed, the divine spark, descended into this lower world, subject to the [[Destiny|''Heimarmene'']] (destiny) and in the power of hostile spirits and powers; and all their [[sacraments]] and mysteries, their formulae and symbols, must be in order to find the way upwards, back to the highest heaven. This idea that the Gnostics know themselves to be in a hostile and evil world reacted in the same direction upon the conception of Sophia. She became likewise a fallen Aeon, who has sunk down into the material world and seeks to free herself from it, receiving her liberation at the hands of a heavenly Redeemer, exactly like the Gnostics.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=853}}\n\nThe goddess who sinks down into the material may readily be identified with ''Ruach'' (\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7), the [[Spirit]] of God, who broods over Chaos, or even with the later ''[[Chokhmah (Kabbalah)|Chokhmah]]'', who was generally conceived of as a world-creating agent.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=853}}\n\nThis system was very closely followed by Valentinus, who may have come to know these doctrines in [[Egypt]].{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=853}}<ref group=\"Note\">{{Quote|For the genesis of [[Apollo]] from Isis and [[Osiris]] that took place while the Gods were still in the womb of [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], is an enigmatical way of stating that before this [sensible] cosmos became manifest, and Matter was perfected by Reason (''Logos''), ''Nature, proving herself imperfect, of herself brought forth her first birth.''\n\nWherefore also they say that that God was lame in the dark, and call him Elder [[Horus]]; for he was not cosmos, but a sort of image and phantasm of the world which was to be.|[http://sacred-texts.com/gno/th1/th136.htm Plutarch, ''On the Worship of Isis and Osiris'', LIV, 5-6], in [http://sacred-texts.com/gno/th1/th136.htm#fn_1153 Mead 1906, 334, note]}}\n\n{{quote|If Plutarch is not mistaken, [[Isis]] was the same with the self-existent Divine Wisdom .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [[Apollo]], or the elder [[Horus]], born of Isis while yet in the womb of her mother Rhea, allegorises the ancient difficulty of accounting for the origin of matter, otherwise than by making it co-ordinate with the ideal forms that it should eventually take. This part of the Egyptian myth must certainly have suggested the idea of the Valentinian Demiurge; as Isis did of Sophia or Achamoth; ''mutatis nominibus'', the words of Plutarch very nearly express the Valentinian theory; \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1f6d\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f43\u03bd \u1f21 \u1fcf\u0399\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bd\u03bf\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u1f30\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1f44\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u1fb7. Then again the terms in which Plutarch speaks of the functions of Isis, are suggestive of the Valentinian notion, where they are not Platonic. No doubt they may have received from him a deeper Platonic colouring, but it is impossible not to believe that the fundamental ideas of the Valentinian theory were received from the theosophy of ancient Egypt, when he says, \"For Isis is the female principle of nature, the recipient of every Gnostic natural product, as ''the nurse and comprehensive principle'' (\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03c7\u03ae\u03c2) in Plato. But by the many she is called ''the million-named'', for moulded (\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 f. l. \u03c4\u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7) by reason she embraces all forms and ideas. And congenital with her is Love of the first and mightiest of all, which is one and the same with the Good; this she desires and follows after, but she avoids and repels all participation with Evil, being to both indeed as space and matter, but inclining always of her own accord to the better principle, occasioning in it the procreative impulse of inseminating her with emanations and types in which she rejoices and exults, as impregnated with produce. For produce is the material image of Substance, and the contingent is an imitation of that which IS.\"|Harvey 1857, pp. 22-4}}</ref> Irenaeus characterizes the Gnostics as the ''pneumatici'' who have a perfect knowledge of God, and have been initiated into the mysteries of Achamoth.<ref name=\"Irenaeus i. 6, 1\">Irenaeus i. 6, 1</ref>\n\n===Anthropos===\nThe chief influence at work here seems to have been the idea of the celestial ''[[Adam Kadmon|Anthropos]]'' (''i.e.'' the Primal Man) \u2013 of whom the myth originally relates that he has sunk into matter and then raised himself up from it again \u2013 which appears in its simple form in individual Gnostic systems, ''e.g.'' in [[Poimandres]] (in the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'') and in [[Manichaeism]].{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=853}}\n\nAccording to Valentinus,<ref name=\"Irenaeus i. 29, 30\">Irenaeus i. 29, 30</ref> the Anthropos  no longer appears as the world-creative power sinking down into the material world, but as a celestial Aeon of the upper world (or even as the supreme god), who stands in a clearly defined relationship to the fallen Aeon.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=853}} Adam was created in the name of Anthropos, and overawes the demons by the fear of the pre-existent man. This Anthropos is a cosmogonic element, pure mind as distinct from matter, mind conceived [[Hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostatically]] as emanating from God and not yet darkened by contact with matter. This mind is considered as the reason of humanity, or humanity itself, as a personified idea, a category without corporeality, the human reason conceived as the [[Anima mundi (spirit)|World-Soul]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} It is possible that the role of the Anthropos is here transferred to Sophia Achamoth.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=853}}\n\nIt is also clear why the Ekklesia appears together with the Anthropos. With this is associated the community of the faithful and the redeemed, who are to share the same fate with him. Perfect ''gnosis'' (and thus the whole body of Gnostics) is connected with the Anthropos.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}<ref>Irenaeus i. 29, 3</ref>\n\n===Christ===\nNext to Sophia stands a male redeeming divinity. In the true Valentinian system, the Christ is the son of the fallen Sophia, who is thus conceived as an individual. Sophia conceives a passion for the First Father himself, or rather, under pretext of love she seeks to draw near to the unattainable Bythos, the Unknowable, and to comprehend his greatness. She brings forth, through her longing for that higher being, an Aeon who is higher and purer than herself, and at once rises into the celestial worlds. Christ has pity on the abortive substance born of Sophia and gives it essence and form, whereupon Sophia tries to rise again to the Father, but in vain. In the enigmatic figure of Christ we again find hidden the original conception of the Primal Man, who sinks down into matter but rises again.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}\n\nIn the fully developed Ptolemaean system we find a kindred conception, but with a slight difference. Here Christ and Sophia appear as brother and sister, with Christ representing the higher and Sophia the lower element. When this world has been born from Sophia in consequence of her passion, two Aeons, Nous (mind) and Aletheia (truth), by command of the Father, produce two new Aeons, Christ and the Holy Ghost; these restore order in the Pleroma, and in consequence all Aeons combine their best and most wonderful qualities to produce a new Aeon (Jesus, Logos, Soter, or Christ), the \"[[First Fruits]]\" whom they offer to the Father. And this celestial redeemer-Aeon now enters into a marriage with the fallen Aeon; they are the \"bride and bridegroom\". It is boldly stated in the exposition in Hippolytus' ''[[Refutation of all Heresies|Philosophumena]]'' that they produce between them 70 celestial [[angels]].{{sfn|Bousset|1911|pp=854-855}}\n\nThis myth can be connected with the historic [[Jesus of Nazareth]] by further relating that Christ, having been united to the Sophia, descends into the earthly Jesus, the son of Mary, at his baptism, and becomes the Saviour of men.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=853}}\n\n=== Horos===\nA figure entirely peculiar to Valentinian Gnosticism is that of ''Horos'' (the Limiter). The name is perhaps an echo of the Egyptian [[Horus]].{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}<ref>Horus, according to Francis Legge, generally appeared in [[Alexandria]] \"with hawk's head and human body dressed in the cuirass and boots of a Roman gendarme or [[Stationarius (Roman military)|stationarius]], which would be appropriate enough for a sentinel or guard.\" Legge 1914, 105.</ref>\n\nThe task of Horos is to separate the fallen Aeons from the upper world of Aeons. At the same time he becomes a kind of world-creative power, who in this capacity helps to construct an ordered world out of Sophia and her passions. He is also called '''Stauros''' ([[cross]]), and we frequently meet with references to the figure of Stauros. Speculations about the Stauros are older than Christianity, and a [[Platonism|Platonic]] conception may have been at work here. [[Plato]] had already [[Timaeus (dialogue)|stated]] that the World-Soul revealed itself in the form of the letter [[Chi (letter)|Chi (X)]], by which he meant that figure described in the heavens by the intersecting orbits of the [[sun]] and the planetary [[ecliptic]]. Since through this double orbit all the movements of the heavenly powers are determined, so all \"becoming\" and all life depend on it, and thus we can understand the statement that the World-Soul appears in the form of an X, or a cross.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}\n\nThe cross can also stand for the wondrous Aeon on whom depends the ordering and life of the world, and thus Horos-Stauros appears here as the first redeemer of Sophia from her passions, and as the orderer of the creation of the world which now begins. Naturally, then, the figure of Horos-Stauros was often assimilated to that of the Christian Redeemer.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}} We possibly find echoes of this in the ''[[Gospel of Peter]]'', where the [[True Cross|Cross]] itself is depicted as speaking and even floating out of the tomb.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n===Monism===\nPeculiarly Valentinian is the above-mentioned derivation of the material world from the passions of Sophia. Whether this already formed part of the original system of Valentinus is questionable, but at any rate it plays a prominent part in the Valentinian school, and consequently appears with the most diverse variations in the account given by Irenaeus. By it is effected the comparative [[monism]] of the Valentinian system, and the dualism of the conception of two separate worlds of light and darkness is overcome:{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}\n{{Quote|This collection [of passions] ... was the substance of the matter from which this world was formed. From [her desire of] returning [to him who gave her life], every soul belonging to this world, and that of the Demiurge himself, derived its origin. All other things owed their beginning to her terror and sorrow. For from her tears all that is of a liquid nature was formed; from her smile all that is lucent; and from her grief and perplexity all the corporeal elements of the world.<ref>Irenaeus i. 4, 2</ref>}}\n\n===Demiurge===\nThis derivation of the material world from the passions of the fallen Sophia is next affected by an older theory, which probably occupied an important place in the main Valentinian system. According to this theory the son of Sophia, whom she forms on the model of the Christ who has disappeared in the Pleroma, becomes the [[Demiurge]], who with his angels now appears as the real-world creative power.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}\n\nAccording to the older conception, he was an evil and malicious offspring of his mother, who has already been deprived of any particle of light.<ref name=\"Irenaeus i. 29, 30\"/>{{failed verification|reason=The chapters in question don't refer to Valentinians but to Barbelites, Borborites, Ophites and Sethians|date=April 2015}} In the Valentinian systems, the Demiurge was the offspring of a union of Sophia Achamoth with matter, and appears as the fruit of Sophia's repentance and conversion.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}} But as Achamoth herself was only the daughter of Sophia, the last of the thirty Aeons, the Demiurge was distant by many emanations from the Supreme God. The Demiurge in creating this world out of Chaos was unconsciously influenced for good by Christ; and the universe, to the surprise even of its Maker, became almost perfect. The Demiurge regretted even its slight imperfection, and as he thought himself the Supreme God, he attempted to remedy this by sending a Messiah. To this Messiah, however, was actually united Christ the Saviour, who redeemed men.\n\n===Creation of Man===\nWith the doctrine of the creation of the world is connected the subject of the creation of man. According to it, the world-creating angels \u2013 not one, but many \u2013 create man, but the seed of the spirit comes into their creature without their knowledge, by the agency of a higher celestial Aeon, and they are then terrified by the faculty of speech by which their creature rises above them and try to destroy him.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}\n\nIt is significant that Valentinus himself is credited with having written a treatise upon the threefold nature of man,<ref>Schwartz, ''A porien'', i. 292</ref> who is represented as at once spiritual, psychical, and material. In accordance with this there also arise three classes of men: the ''pneumatici'', the ''psychici'', and the ''hylici''.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}} This doctrine dates at least as far back as Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.\n\n*The first, the material, will return to the grossness of matter and finally be consumed by fire.\n*The second, or psychical, together with the Demiurge as their master, will enter a middle state, neither heaven (Pleroma) nor hell (matter).\n*The third, the purely spiritual men will be completely freed from the influence of the Demiurge and together with the Saviour and Achamoth, his spouse, will enter the Pleroma divested of body and soul.\n\nHowever, it is not unanimous the belief that material or psychical people were hopeless. Some have argued from the existent sources that humans could [[reincarnate]] in any of the three times, therefore a material or psychical person might have the chance to reborn in a future lifetime as a spiritual one.<ref>Dina Ripsman Eylon, ''Reincarnation in Jewish mysticism and gnosticism'', Edwin Mellen Press, 2003</ref>\n\nWe also find ideas that emphasize the distinction between the ''soma psychikon'' and the ''soma pneumatikon'':\n\n{{Quote|Perfect redemption is the cognition itself of the ineffable greatness: for since through ignorance came about the defect ... the whole system springing from ignorance is dissolved in ''gnosis''. Therefore ''gnosis'' is the redemption of the inner man; and it is not of the body, for the body is corruptible; nor is it psychical, for even the soul is a product of the defect and it is a lodging to the spirit: pneumatic (spiritual) therefore also must be redemption itself. Through ''gnosis'', then, is redeemed the inner, spiritual man: so that to us suffices the ''gnosis'' of universal being: and this is the true redemption.<ref name=\"Irenaeus i. 21, 4\">Irenaeus i. 21, 4</ref>}}\n\n===Soteriology===\nSalvation is not merely individual redemption of each human soul; it is a cosmic process. It is the return of all things to what they were before the flaw in the sphere of the Aeons brought matter into existence and imprisoned some part of the Divine Light into the evil ''Hyle'' ([[matter]]). This setting free of the light sparks is the process of salvation; when all light shall have left Hyle, it will be burnt up and destroyed.\n\nIn Valentinianism the process is extraordinarily elaborate, and we find here developed particularly clearly the myth of the heavenly marriage.<ref>Irenaeus i. 30</ref> This myth, as we shall see more fully below, and as may be mentioned here, is of great significance for the practical piety of the Valentinian Gnostics. It is the chief idea of their pious practices mystically to repeat the experience of this celestial union of the Saviour with Sophia. In this respect, consequently, the myth underwent yet wider development. Just as the Saviour is the bridegroom of Sophia, so the heavenly angels, who sometimes appear as the sons of the Saviour and Sophia, sometimes as the escort of the Saviour, are the males betrothed to the souls of the Gnostics, which are looked upon as feminine. Thus every Gnostic had her unfallen counterpart standing in the presence of God, and the object of a pious life was to bring about and experience this inner union with the celestial abstract personage. This leads us straight to the sacramental ideas of this branch of Gnosticism (see below). And it also explains the expression used of the Gnostics in Irenaeus,<ref>Irenaeus i. 6, 4</ref> that they always meditate upon the secret of the heavenly union (the Syzygia).{{sfn|Bousset|1911|pp=854-855}}\n\n\"The final consummation of all things will take place when all that is spiritual has been formed and perfected by ''gnosis''.\"<ref name=\"Irenaeus i. 6, 1\"/>\n\n===Gnosis===\nThe central point of the piety of Valentinus seems to have been that mystical contemplation of God; in a letter preserved in Clement of Alexandria,<ref>Clemens ''[[Stromata]]'' ii. 20, 114</ref> he sets forth that the soul of man is like an inn, which is inhabited by many evil spirits.\n{{Quote|But when the Father, who alone is good, looks down and around him, then the soul is hallowed and lies in full light, and so he who has such a heart as this is to be called happy, for he shall behold God.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=855}}}}\nBut this contemplation of God, as Valentinus declares, closely and deliberately following the doctrines of the Church and with him the compiler of the Gospel of John, is accomplished through the revelation of the Son. This mystic also discusses a vision which is preserved in the ''Philosophumena'' of Hippolytus:{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=855}}\n{{Quote|Valentinus ... had seen an infant child lately born; and questioning (this child), he proceeded to inquire who it might be. And (the child) replied, saying that he himself is the Logos, and then subjoined a sort of tragic legend...<ref>Hippolytus ''Philosophumena'' 6, 37</ref>}}\nWith celestial enthusiasm Valentinus here surveys and depicts the heavenly world of Aeons, and its connection with the lower world. Exalted joy of battle and a valiant courage breathe forth in the sermon in which Valentinus addresses the faithful:\n{{Quote|Ye are from the beginning immortal and children of eternal life, and desire to divide death amongst you like a prey, in order to destroy it and utterly to annihilate it, that thus death may die in you and through you, for if ye dissolve the world, and are not yourselves dissolved, then are ye lords over creation and over all that passes away.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=855}}<ref>Clemens iv. 13, 91</ref>}}\n\n==Sacraments==\nThe authorities for the sacramental practices of the Valentinians are preserved especially in the accounts of the [[Marcosians]] given in Irenaeus i. 13 and 20, and in the last section of Clement of Alexandria's ''Excerpta ex Theodoto''.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=855}}\n\nIn almost all the sacramental prayers of the Gnostics handed down to us by Irenaeus, the Mother is the object of the invocation. There are moreover various figures in the fully developed system of the Valentinians who are in the Gnostic's mind when he calls upon the Mother; sometimes it is the fallen Achamoth, sometimes the higher Sophia abiding in the celestial world, sometimes ''Aletheia'', the consort of the supreme heavenly father, but it is always the same idea, the Mother, on whom the faith of the Gnostics is fixed. Thus a baptismal confession of faith of the Gnostics<ref name=\"Irenaeus i. 21, 3\">Irenaeus i. 21, 3</ref> runs: \n{{Quote|In the name of the unknown Father of all, by Aletheia, the Mother of all, by the name which descended upon Jesus.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=855}}}}\n\n===Bridal Chamber===\nThe chief sacrament of the Valentinians seems to have been that of the bridal chamber (''nymphon'').{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=855}} The ''[[Gospel of Philip]],'' a probable Valentinian text, reads:\n{{Quote|There were three buildings specifically for sacrifice in Jerusalem. The one facing the west was called \"The Holy\". Another, facing south, was called \"The Holy of the Holy\". The third, facing east, was called \"The Holy of the Holies\", the place where only the high priest enters. Baptism is \"the Holy\" building. Redemption is the \"Holy of the Holy\". \"The Holy of the Holies\" is the bridal chamber. Baptism includes the resurrection and the redemption; the redemption (takes place) in the bridal chamber.}}\n\nAs Sophia was united with the Saviour, her bridegroom, so the faithful would experience a union with their angel in the Pleroma (cf. the \"[[Higher Self]]\" or \"[[Holy Guardian Angel]]\"). The ritual of this sacrament is briefly indicated: \"A few of them prepare a bridal chamber and in it go through a form of consecration, employing certain fixed formulae, which are repeated over the person to be initiated, and stating that a spiritual marriage is to be performed after the pattern of the higher Syzygia.\"<ref name=\"Irenaeus i. 21, 3\"/> Through a fortunate chance, a liturgical formula which was used at this sacrament appears to be preserved, though in a garbled form and in an entirely different connection, the author seeming to have been uncertain as to its original meaning. It runs:\n{{Quote|I will confer my favor upon thee, for the father of all sees thine angel ever before his face ... we must now become as one; receive now this grace from me and through me; deck thyself as a bride who awaits her bridegroom, that thou mayest become as I am, and I as thou art. Let the seed of light descend into thy bridal chamber; receive the bridegroom and give place to him, and open thine arms to embrace him. Behold, grace has descended upon thee.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=856}}<ref>[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XIII.|Irenaeus i. 23, 3]]</ref>}}\n\nOther key features of the doctrine of the Bridal Chamber included the use of mirrors as part of the decor and the idea that those who had partaken in the rituals would be able to beget children in the world to come.\n\n===Baptism===\nBesides this the Gnostics already practiced [[baptism]], using the same form in all essentials as that of the Christian Church. The name given to baptism, at least among certain bodies, was ''apolytrosis'' (liberation); the baptismal formulae have been mentioned above.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=856}}\n\nThe Gnostics are baptized in the mysterious name which also descended upon [[Baptism of Jesus|Jesus at his baptism]].{{Clarification needed|date=November 2018}} The angels of the Gnostics have also had to be baptized in this name, in order to bring about redemption for themselves and the souls belonging to them.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=856}}<ref name=\"Excerpta ex Theodoto, 22\">''Excerpta ex Theodoto'', 22</ref>\n\nIn the baptismal formulae the sacred name of the Redeemer is mentioned over and over again. In one of the formulae occur the words: \"I would enjoy thy name, Saviour of Truth.\" The concluding formula of the baptismal ceremony is: \"Peace over all upon whom the Name rests.\"<ref name=\"Irenaeus i. 21, 3\"/> This name pronounced at baptism over the faithful has above all the significance that the name will protect the soul in its ascent through the heavens, conduct it safely through all hostile powers to the lower heavens, and procure it access to Horos, who frightens back the lower souls by his [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] word.<ref name=\"Excerpta ex Theodoto, 22\"/> And for this life also baptism, in consequence of the pronouncing of the protecting name over the baptized person, accomplishes his liberation from the lower daemonic powers. Before baptism the ''Heimarmene'' is supreme, but after baptism the soul is free from her.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=856}}<ref>''Excerpta ex Theodoto''. 77</ref>\n\n===Death===\nWith baptism was also connected the anointing with oil, and hence we can also understand the death sacrament occurring among some Valentinians consisting in an anointing with a mixture of oil and water.<ref name=\"Irenaeus i. 21, 4\"/> This death sacrament has naturally the express object of assuring the soul the way to the highest heaven \"so that the soul may be intangible and invisible to the higher mights and powers\".<ref>Irenaeus ''loc. cit.''</ref> In this connection we also find a few formulae which are entrusted to the faithful, so that their souls may pronounce them on their journey upwards. One of these formulae runs:\n{{Quote|I am a son from the Father \u2013 the Father who had a pre-existence, and a son in Him who is pre-existent. I have come to behold all things, both those which belong to myself and others, although, strictly speaking, they do not belong to others, but to Achamoth, who is female in nature, and made these things for herself.

Another prayer of the same style is to be found in Irenaeus i. 13, and it is expressly stated that after prayer is pronounced the Mother throws the [[Cap of invisibility|Homeric helmet]] (cf. the ''[[Tarnhelm]]'') over the faithful soul, and so makes him invisible to the mights and powers which surround and attack him.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=856}}\n\n===Reaction===\nOn the other hand, a reaction took place here and there against the sacramental rites. A pure piety, rising above mere sacramentalism, breathes in the words of the Gnostics preserved in ''Excerpta ex Theodoto'', 78, 2:\n{{Quote|But not baptism alone sets us free, but knowledge (''gnosis''): who we were, what we have become, where we were, whither we have sunk, whither we hasten, whence we are redeemed, what is birth and what rebirth.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=856}}}}\n\n==Relationship with the Church==\nThe distinction between the human and divine Saviour was a major point of contention between the Valentinians and the Church. Valentinus separated Christ into three figures; the spiritual, the psychical and material. Each of the three Christ figures had its own meaning and purpose.<ref>Rudolph 1977, 166</ref> They acknowledged that Christ suffered and died, but believed that \"in his incarnation, Christ transcended human nature so that he could prevail over death by divine power\".<ref>Pagels 1979, 96</ref> These beliefs are what caused Irenaeus to say of the Valentinians, \"Certainly they confess with their tongues the one Jesus Christ, but in their minds they divide him.\"<ref>Rudolph 1977, 155</ref> In one passage in the account of Irenaeus, it is directly stated that the redeemer assumed a psychical body to redeem the psychical, for the spiritual already belong by nature to the celestial world and no longer require any ''historical'' redemption, while the material is incapable of redemption,<ref name=\"Irenaeus i. 6, 1\"/> as \"flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption\".<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:50}}</ref>\n\nMany Valentinian traditions and practices also clashed with those of the Church. They often met at unauthorized gatherings and rejected ecclesiastical authority, based on their belief that they were all equal. Members of the movement took turns administering sacraments, as well as preaching.<ref name=\"Holroyd 1994, 33\">Holroyd 1994, 33</ref> Among the Valentinians, women were considered to be equal, or at least nearly equal to men. There were female prophets, teachers, healers, evangelists and even priests, which was very different from the Church's view of women at the time.<ref>Pagels 1979, 60</ref> Valentinians held normal jobs, got married and raised children just like Christians; however they regarded these pursuits as being less important than gnosis, which was to be achieved individually.<ref>Pagels 1979, 146</ref> The beliefs of the Valentinians were much more oriented towards the individual than the group, and [[salvation]] was not seen as being universal, as it was in the Church.\n\nThe main disagreements between the Valentinians and the Church were in the notions that God and the creator were two separate entities, the idea that the creator was flawed and formed man and Earth out of ignorance and confusion, and the separation of Christ's human form and divine form. Church authorities believed that Valentinian theology was \"a wickedly casuistic way of subverting their authority and thereby threatening the ecclesiastical order with anarchy.\"<ref name=\"Holroyd 1994, 33\"/> The practices and rituals of the Valentinians were also different from those of the Christian Church; however they considered themselves to be Christians and not pagans or heretics. By referring to themselves as Christians they worsened their relationship with the Church, who viewed them not only as heretics, but as rivals.<ref>Rudolph 1977, 206</ref>\n\nAlthough the Valentinians publicly professed their faith in one God, \"in their own private meetings they insisted on discriminating between the popular image of God \u2013 as master, king, lord, creator, and judge \u2013 and what that image represented: God understood as the ultimate source of all being.\"<ref name=\"Pagels 1979, 32\">Pagels 1979, 32</ref> Aside from the Church fathers, however, \"the majority of Christians did not recognize the followers of Valentinus as heretics. Most could not tell the difference between Valentinian and orthodox teaching.\"<ref name=\"Pagels 1979, 32\"/> This was partially because Valentinus used many books that now belong to the Old and New Testaments as a basis for interpretation in his own writing. He based his work on proto-orthodox Christian canon instead of on Gnostic scripture, and his style was similar to that of early Christian works. In this way, Valentinus tried to bridge the gap between Gnostic religion and early Catholicism.<ref>Layton (ed.) 1987, xxii</ref> By attempting to bridge this gap, however, Valentinus and his followers became the proverbial [[wolf in sheep's clothing|wolves in sheep's clothing]]. \"The apparent similarity with orthodox teaching only made this heresy more dangerous \u2013 like poison disguised as milk.\"<ref name=\"Pagels 1979, 32\"/> Valentinian Gnosticism was \"the most influential and sophisticated form of Gnostic teaching, and by far the most threatening to the church.\"<ref name=\"Pagels 1979, 32\"/>\n\n[[History of Christianity#Early Christianity (c.33\u2013325)|Early Christianity]] has been described as \"a complex network of individual parties, groups, sects, or denominations.\"<ref>Layton (ed.) 1987, xviii</ref> This inconsistency made Gnostic sects such as Valentinianism threatening to the proto-orthodox sect.\n\n==Texts==\nValentinian works are named in reference to the bishop and teacher Valentinius.

Founded by [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] in the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|second century AD]], its influence spread widely, not just within Rome, but also from Northwest Africa to Egypt through to Asia Minor and Syria in the east.<ref>Green 1985, 244</ref>\n\nLater in the movement's history it broke into an Eastern and a Western school. Disciples of Valentinus continued to be active into the 4th century AD, after the [[Roman Empire]] was declared to be [[Christians|Christian]].<ref>Green 1985, 245</ref>\n\nThe doctrine, practices and beliefs of Valentinus and the Gnostic movement that bore his name were condemned as heretical by proto-orthodox church leaders and scholars. Prominent [[Church Fathers]] such as [[Irenaeus of Lyons]] and [[Hippolytus of Rome]] wrote against Gnosticism. Because early church leaders encouraged the destruction of Gnostic texts, most evidence for the Valentinian theory comes from its critics and detractors, most notably Irenaeus, since he was especially concerned with refuting Valentinianism.<ref>Wilson 1958, 133</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] was born in approximately 100 AD and died in [[Alexandria]] circa 180 AD.<ref name=\"Holroyd 1994, 32\">Holroyd 1994, 32</ref> According to the Christian scholar [[Epiphanius of Salamis]], he was born in [[Egypt]] and schooled in Alexandria, where the Gnostic [[Basilides]] was teaching. However [[Clement of Alexandria]] (c.150{{snd}}c.215), another Christian scholar and teacher, reports that Valentinus was taught by [[Theudas (teacher of Valentinius)|Theudas]], a disciple of the apostle [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]].<ref name=\"Roukema 1998, 129\">Roukema 1998, 129</ref> He was reputed to be an extremely eloquent man who possessed a great deal of charisma and had an innate ability to attract people.<ref>Churton 1987, 53</ref> He went to [[Rome]] some time between AD 136 and 140, in the time of [[Pope Hyginus]], and had risen to the peak of his teaching career between AD 150 and 155, during the time of [[Pope Pius I|Pius]].<ref>Filoramo 1990, 166</ref>\n\nValentinus is said to have been a very successful teacher, and for some time in the mid-2nd century he was even a prominent and well-respected member of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] community in Rome. At one point during his career he had even hoped to attain the office of bishop, and apparently it was after he was passed over for the position that he broke from the Catholic Church.<ref name=\"Roukema 1998, 129\"/> Valentinus was said to have been a prolific writer; however, the only surviving remains of his work come from quotes that have been transmitted by Clement of Alexandria, [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] and [[Marcellus of Ancyra]]. Most scholars also believe that Valentinus wrote the [[Gospel of Truth]], one of the [[Nag Hammadi library|Nag Hammadi text]]s.<ref name=\"Holroyd 1994, 32\"/>\n\nNotable Valentinians included [[Heracleon]] (fl. ca. 175), [[Ptolemy (gnostic)|Ptolemy]], Florinus, Axionicus and [[Theodotus of Byzantium|Theodotus]].\n\n==The Valentinian system==\n\nThe theology that Irenaeus attributed to Valentinus is extremely complicated and difficult to follow. There is some skepticism among scholars that the system actually originated with him, and many believe that the system Irenaeus was counteracting was the construct of later Valentinians.\n\n===Synopsis===\nAccording to Irenaeus, the Valentinians believed that at the beginning there was a [[Pleroma]] (literally, a 'fullness'). At the centre of the Pleroma was the primal Father or ''[[Bythos]]'', the beginning of all things who, after ages of silence and contemplation, projected thirty ''[[Aeon]]s'', heavenly archetypes representing fifteen [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|syzygies]] or sexually complementary pairs. Among them was ''[[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]]''. Sophia's weakness, curiosity and passion led to her fall from the Pleroma and the creation of the world and man, both of which are flawed. Valentinians identified the [[God]] of the [[Old Testament]] as the [[Demiurge]],<ref>Goodrick-Clarke 2002, 182</ref> the imperfect creator of the material world. Man, the highest being in this material world, participates in both the spiritual and the material nature. The work of redemption consists in freeing the former from the latter. One needed to recognize the Father, the ''depth of all being'', as the true source of divine power in order to achieve ''gnosis'' (knowledge).<ref>Pagels 1979, 37</ref> The Valentinians believed that the attainment of this knowledge by the human individual had positive consequences within the universal order and contributed to restoring that order,<ref>Holroyd 1994, 37</ref> and that gnosis, not faith, was the key to salvation. Clement wrote that the Valentinians regarded Catholic Christians \u201cas simple people to whom they attributed faith, while they think that gnosis is in themselves. Through the excellent seed that is to be found in them, they are by nature redeemed, and their gnosis is as far removed from faith as the spiritual from the physical\u201d.<ref>Roukema 1998, 130</ref>\n\n===Aeons===\nThe superstructure of the celestial system, the celestial world of Aeons, is here developed in the most complicated way.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|pp=853-854}} These Aeons belong to the purely ideal, noumenal, intelligible, or supersensible world; they are immaterial, they are [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostatic]] ideas. Together with the source from which they emanate they form the Pleroma. The transition from the immaterial to the material, from the noumenal to the sensible, is brought about by a flaw, or a passion, or a sin, in the female Aeon Sophia.\n\n[[Image:aeons.png|600px|center|Scheme of the Aeons]]\n\n[[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] alleges that the Valentinians \u201cset forth their thirty aeons in mythologic fashion, thinking that they conformed to the years of Jesus\u201d.<ref>Mead 1903, 396.</ref> Of the eight celestial beings of the ''[[Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|Ogdoad]],'' four are peculiar to the Valentinian system. The third pair of Aeons, ''[[Logos]]'' and ''Zoe,'' occur only here, and the place of this pair is not firmly established, and occur sometimes before and sometimes after the fourth pair of Aeons, the ''Anthropos'' and the ''Ekklesia''. We cannot be far wrong in suspecting that Valentinus was influenced by the prologue of the [[fourth Gospel]] (we also find the probably [[Johannine]] names ''Monogenes'' and ''[[Paraclete|Parakletos]]'' in the series of Aeons).{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}\n\n===Sophia===\nIn Valentinianism, Sophia always stands absolutely at the center of the system, and in some sense she seems to represent the supreme female principle.\n\nSophia is the youngest of the Aeons. Observing the multitude of Aeons and the power of begetting them, she hurries back into the depth of the Father, and seeks to emulate him by producing offspring without conjugal intercourse, but only projects an abortion, a formless substance. Upon this she is cast out of Pleroma and into the primal sub-stratum of matter.<ref>Irenaeus i. 29</ref> In the Valentinian systems, the fall of Sophia appears in double guise. The higher Sophia still remains within the upper world after creating a disturbance, and after her expiation and repentance; but her premature offspring, ''Sophia Achamoth'', is removed from the Pleroma, and becomes the heroine of the rest of the drama.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}} This fallen Sophia becomes a world creative power.\n\n[[File:Valentinianpleroma-Matter.png|thumb|right|320px|Pl\u00e9rome de Valentin, from ''Histoire critique du Gnosticisme;'' Jacques Matter, 1826, Vol. II, Plate II.]]\nSophia Achamoth, or \u201cLower Wisdom\u201d, the daughter of \u201cHigher Wisdom\u201d, becomes the mother of the Demiurge, identified with the God of the Old Testament. <!--She dwells in the eighth heaven, the ''Ogdoad''; above her stands the Pleroma; below in the [[Seventh Heaven|seven lower heavens]] of the ''Hebdomad'' reign the seven planetary, world-creating [[Archons]].-->\n\nThe Gnostics are children of Sophia; from her the heavenly seed, the divine spark, descended into this lower world, subject to the [[Destiny|''Heimarmene'']] (destiny) and in the power of hostile spirits and powers; and all their [[sacraments]] and mysteries, their formulae and symbols, must be in order to find the way upwards, back to the highest heaven. This idea that the Gnostics know themselves to be in a hostile and evil world reacted in the same direction upon the conception of Sophia. She became likewise a fallen Aeon, who has sunk down into the material world and seeks to free herself from it, receiving her liberation at the hands of a heavenly Redeemer, exactly like the Gnostics.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=853}}\n\nThe goddess who sinks down into the material may readily be identified with ''Ruach'' (\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7), the [[Spirit]] of God, who broods over Chaos, or even with the later ''[[Chokhmah (Kabbalah)|Chokhmah]]'', who was generally conceived of as a world-creating agent.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=853}}\n\nThis system was very closely followed by Valentinus, who may have come to know these doctrines in [[Egypt]].{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=853}}<ref group=\"Note\">{{Quote|For the genesis of [[Apollo]] from Isis and [[Osiris]] that took place while the Gods were still in the womb of [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], is an enigmatical way of stating that before this [sensible] cosmos became manifest, and Matter was perfected by Reason (''Logos''), ''Nature, proving herself imperfect, of herself brought forth her first birth.''\n\nWherefore also they say that that God was lame in the dark, and call him Elder [[Horus]]; for he was not cosmos, but a sort of image and phantasm of the world which was to be.|[http://sacred-texts.com/gno/th1/th136.htm Plutarch, ''On the Worship of Isis and Osiris'', LIV, 5-6], in [http://sacred-texts.com/gno/th1/th136.htm#fn_1153 Mead 1906, 334, note]}}\n\n{{quote|If Plutarch is not mistaken, [[Isis]] was the same with the self-existent Divine Wisdom .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [[Apollo]], or the elder [[Horus]], born of Isis while yet in the womb of her mother Rhea, allegorises the ancient difficulty of accounting for the origin of matter, otherwise than by making it co-ordinate with the ideal forms that it should eventually take. This part of the Egyptian myth must certainly have suggested the idea of the Valentinian Demiurge; as Isis did of Sophia or Achamoth; ''mutatis nominibus'', the words of Plutarch very nearly express the Valentinian theory; \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1f6d\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f43\u03bd \u1f21 \u1fcf\u0399\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bd\u03bf\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u1f30\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1f44\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u1fb7. Then again the terms in which Plutarch speaks of the functions of Isis, are suggestive of the Valentinian notion, where they are not Platonic. No doubt they may have received from him a deeper Platonic colouring, but it is impossible not to believe that the fundamental ideas of the Valentinian theory were received from the theosophy of ancient Egypt, when he says, \"For Isis is the female principle of nature, the recipient of every Gnostic natural product, as ''the nurse and comprehensive principle'' (\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03c7\u03ae\u03c2) in Plato. But by the many she is called ''the million-named'', for moulded (\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 f. l. \u03c4\u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7) by reason she embraces all forms and ideas. And congenital with her is Love of the first and mightiest of all, which is one and the same with the Good; this she desires and follows after, but she avoids and repels all participation with Evil, being to both indeed as space and matter, but inclining always of her own accord to the better principle, occasioning in it the procreative impulse of inseminating her with emanations and types in which she rejoices and exults, as impregnated with produce. For produce is the material image of Substance, and the contingent is an imitation of that which IS.\"|Harvey 1857, pp. 22-4}}</ref> Irenaeus characterizes the Gnostics as the ''pneumatici'' who have a perfect knowledge of God, and have been initiated into the mysteries of Achamoth.<ref name=\"Irenaeus i. 6, 1\">Irenaeus i. 6, 1</ref>\n\n===Anthropos===\nThe chief influence at work here seems to have been the idea of the celestial ''[[Adam Kadmon|Anthropos]]'' (''i.e.'' the Primal Man) \u2013 of whom the myth originally relates that he has sunk into matter and then raised himself up from it again \u2013 which appears in its simple form in individual Gnostic systems, ''e.g.'' in [[Poimandres]] (in the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'') and in [[Manichaeism]].{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=853}}\n\nAccording to Valentinus,<ref name=\"Irenaeus i. 29, 30\">Irenaeus i. 29, 30</ref> the Anthropos  no longer appears as the world-creative power sinking down into the material world, but as a celestial Aeon of the upper world (or even as the supreme god), who stands in a clearly defined relationship to the fallen Aeon.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=853}} Adam was created in the name of Anthropos, and overawes the demons by the fear of the pre-existent man. This Anthropos is a cosmogonic element, pure mind as distinct from matter, mind conceived [[Hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostatically]] as emanating from God and not yet darkened by contact with matter. This mind is considered as the reason of humanity, or humanity itself, as a personified idea, a category without corporeality, the human reason conceived as the [[Anima mundi (spirit)|World-Soul]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} It is possible that the role of the Anthropos is here transferred to Sophia Achamoth.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=853}}\n\nIt is also clear why the Ekklesia appears together with the Anthropos. With this is associated the community of the faithful and the redeemed, who are to share the same fate with him. Perfect ''gnosis'' (and thus the whole body of Gnostics) is connected with the Anthropos.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}<ref>Irenaeus i. 29, 3</ref>\n\n===Christ===\nNext to Sophia stands a male redeeming divinity. In the true Valentinian system, the Christ is the son of the fallen Sophia, who is thus conceived as an individual. Sophia conceives a passion for the First Father himself, or rather, under pretext of love she seeks to draw near to the unattainable Bythos, the Unknowable, and to comprehend his greatness. She brings forth, through her longing for that higher being, an Aeon who is higher and purer than herself, and at once rises into the celestial worlds. Christ has pity on the abortive substance born of Sophia and gives it essence and form, whereupon Sophia tries to rise again to the Father, but in vain. In the enigmatic figure of Christ we again find hidden the original conception of the Primal Man, who sinks down into matter but rises again.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}\n\nIn the fully developed Ptolemaean system we find a kindred conception, but with a slight difference. Here Christ and Sophia appear as brother and sister, with Christ representing the higher and Sophia the lower element. When this world has been born from Sophia in consequence of her passion, two Aeons, Nous (mind) and Aletheia (truth), by command of the Father, produce two new Aeons, Christ and the Holy Ghost; these restore order in the Pleroma, and in consequence all Aeons combine their best and most wonderful qualities to produce a new Aeon (Jesus, Logos, Soter, or Christ), the \u201c[[First Fruits]]\u201d whom they offer to the Father. And this celestial redeemer-Aeon now enters into a marriage with the fallen Aeon; they are the \u201cbride and bridegroom\u201d. It is boldly stated in the exposition in Hippolytus\u2019 ''[[Refutation of all Heresies|Philosophumena]]'' that they produce between them 70 celestial [[angels]].{{sfn|Bousset|1911|pp=854-855}}\n\nThis myth can be connected with the historic [[Jesus of Nazareth]] by further relating that Christ, having been united to the Sophia, descends into the earthly Jesus, the son of Mary, at his baptism, and becomes the Saviour of men.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=853}}\n\n=== Horos===\nA figure entirely peculiar to Valentinian Gnosticism is that of ''Horos'' (the Limiter). The name is perhaps an echo of the Egyptian [[Horus]].{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}<ref>Horus, according to Francis Legge, generally appeared in [[Alexandria]] \u201cwith hawk\u2019s head and human body dressed in the cuirass and boots of a Roman gendarme or [[Stationarius (Roman military)|stationarius]], which would be appropriate enough for a sentinel or guard.\u201d Legge 1914, 105.</ref>\n\nThe task of Horos is to separate the fallen Aeons from the upper world of Aeons. At the same time he becomes a kind of world-creative power, who in this capacity helps to construct an ordered world out of Sophia and her passions. He is also called '''Stauros''' ([[cross]]), and we frequently meet with references to the figure of Stauros. Speculations about the Stauros are older than Christianity, and a [[Platonism|Platonic]] conception may have been at work here. [[Plato]] had already [[Timaeus (dialogue)|stated]] that the World-Soul revealed itself in the form of the letter [[Chi (letter)|Chi (X)]], by which he meant that figure described in the heavens by the intersecting orbits of the [[sun]] and the planetary [[ecliptic]]. Since through this double orbit all the movements of the heavenly powers are determined, so all \u201cbecoming\u201d and all life depend on it, and thus we can understand the statement that the World-Soul appears in the form of an X, or a cross.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}\n\nThe cross can also stand for the wondrous Aeon on whom depends the ordering and life of the world, and thus Horos-Stauros appears here as the first redeemer of Sophia from her passions, and as the orderer of the creation of the world which now begins. Naturally, then, the figure of Horos-Stauros was often assimilated to that of the Christian Redeemer.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}} We possibly find echoes of this in the ''[[Gospel of Peter]]'', where the [[True Cross|Cross]] itself is depicted as speaking and even floating out of the tomb.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n===Monism===\nPeculiarly Valentinian is the above-mentioned derivation of the material world from the passions of Sophia. Whether this already formed part of the original system of Valentinus is questionable, but at any rate it plays a prominent part in the Valentinian school, and consequently appears with the most diverse variations in the account given by Irenaeus. By it is effected the comparative [[monism]] of the Valentinian system, and the dualism of the conception of two separate worlds of light and darkness is overcome:{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}\n{{Quote|This collection [of passions] ... was the substance of the matter from which this world was formed. From [her desire of] returning [to him who gave her life], every soul belonging to this world, and that of the Demiurge himself, derived its origin. All other things owed their beginning to her terror and sorrow. For from her tears all that is of a liquid nature was formed; from her smile all that is lucent; and from her grief and perplexity all the corporeal elements of the world.''<ref>Irenaeus i. 4, 2</ref>}}\n\n===Demiurge===\nThis derivation of the material world from the passions of the fallen Sophia is next affected by an older theory, which probably occupied an important place in the main Valentinian system. According to this theory the son of Sophia, whom she forms on the model of the Christ who has disappeared in the Pleroma, becomes the [[Demiurge]], who with his angels now appears as the real-world creative power.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}\n\nAccording to the older conception, he was an evil and malicious offspring of his mother, who has already been deprived of any particle of light.<ref name=\"Irenaeus i. 29, 30\"/>{{failed verification|reason=The chapters in question don't refer to Valentinians but to Barbelites, Borborites, Ophites and Sethians|date=April 2015}} In the Valentinian systems, the Demiurge was the offspring of a union of Sophia Achamoth with matter, and appears as the fruit of Sophia's repentance and conversion.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}} But as Achamoth herself was only the daughter of Sophia, the last of the thirty Aeons, the Demiurge was distant by many emanations from the Supreme God. The Demiurge in creating this world out of Chaos was unconsciously influenced for good by Christ; and the universe, to the surprise even of its Maker, became almost perfect. The Demiurge regretted even its slight imperfection, and as he thought himself the Supreme God, he attempted to remedy this by sending a Messiah. To this Messiah, however, was actually united Christ the Saviour, who redeemed men.\n\n===Creation of Man===\nWith the doctrine of the creation of the world is connected the subject of the creation of man. According to it, the world-creating angels \u2013 not one, but many \u2013 create man, but the seed of the spirit comes into their creature without their knowledge, by the agency of a higher celestial Aeon, and they are then terrified by the faculty of speech by which their creature rises above them and try to destroy him.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}\n\nIt is significant that Valentinus himself is credited with having written a treatise upon the threefold nature of man,<ref>Schwartz, ''A porien'', i. 292</ref> who is represented as at once spiritual, psychical, and material. In accordance with this there also arise three classes of men: the ''pneumatici'', the ''psychici'', and the ''hylici''.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}} This doctrine dates at least as far back as Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.\n\n*The first, the material, will return to the grossness of matter and finally be consumed by fire.\n*The second, or psychical, together with the Demiurge as their master, will enter a middle state, neither heaven (Pleroma) nor hell (matter).\n*The third, the purely spiritual men will be completely freed from the influence of the Demiurge and together with the Saviour and Achamoth, his spouse, will enter the Pleroma divested of body and soul.\n\nHowever, it is not unanimous the belief that material or psychical people were hopeless. Some have argued from the existent sources that humans could [[reincarnate]] in any of the three times, therefore a material or psychical person might have the chance to reborn in a future lifetime as a spiritual one.<ref>Dina Ripsman Eylon, ''Reincarnation in Jewish mysticism and gnosticism'', Edwin Mellen Press, 2003</ref>\n\nWe also find ideas that emphasize the distinction between the ''soma psychikon'' and the ''soma pneumatikon'':\n\n{{Quote|Perfect redemption is the cognition itself of the ineffable greatness: for since through ignorance came about the defect ... the whole system springing from ignorance is dissolved in ''gnosis''. Therefore ''gnosis'' is the redemption of the inner man; and it is not of the body, for the body is corruptible; nor is it psychical, for even the soul is a product of the defect and it is a lodging to the spirit: pneumatic (spiritual) therefore also must be redemption itself. Through ''gnosis'', then, is redeemed the inner, spiritual man: so that to us suffices the ''gnosis'' of universal being: and this is the true redemption.''<ref name=\"Irenaeus i. 21, 4\">Irenaeus i. 21, 4</ref>}}\n\n===Soteriology===\nSalvation is not merely individual redemption of each human soul; it is a cosmic process. It is the return of all things to what they were before the flaw in the sphere of the Aeons brought matter into existence and imprisoned some part of the Divine Light into the evil ''Hyle'' ([[matter]]). This setting free of the light sparks is the process of salvation; when all light shall have left Hyle, it will be burnt up and destroyed.\n\nIn Valentinianism the process is extraordinarily elaborate, and we find here developed particularly clearly the myth of the heavenly marriage.<ref>Irenaeus i. 30</ref> This myth, as we shall see more fully below, and as may be mentioned here, is of great significance for the practical piety of the Valentinian Gnostics. It is the chief idea of their pious practices mystically to repeat the experience of this celestial union of the Saviour with Sophia. In this respect, consequently, the myth underwent yet wider development. Just as the Saviour is the bridegroom of Sophia, so the heavenly angels, who sometimes appear as the sons of the Saviour and Sophia, sometimes as the escort of the Saviour, are the males betrothed to the souls of the Gnostics, which are looked upon as feminine. Thus every Gnostic had her unfallen counterpart standing in the presence of God, and the object of a pious life was to bring about and experience this inner union with the celestial abstract personage. This leads us straight to the sacramental ideas of this branch of Gnosticism (see below). And it also explains the expression used of the Gnostics in Irenaeus,<ref>Irenaeus i. 6, 4</ref> that they always meditate upon the secret of the heavenly union (the Syzygia).{{sfn|Bousset|1911|pp=854-855}}\n\n\u201cThe final consummation of all things will take place when all that is spiritual has been formed and perfected by ''gnosis''.\u201d<ref name=\"Irenaeus i. 6, 1\"/>\n\n===Gnosis===\nThe central point of the piety of Valentinus seems to have been that mystical contemplation of God; in a letter preserved in Clement of Alexandria,<ref>Clemens ''[[Stromata]]'' ii. 20, 114</ref> he sets forth that the soul of man is like an inn, which is inhabited by many evil spirits.\n{{Quote|But when the Father, who alone is good, looks down and around him, then the soul is hallowed and lies in full light, and so he who has such a heart as this is to be called happy, for he shall behold God.''{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=855}}}}\nBut this contemplation of God, as Valentinus declares, closely and deliberately following the doctrines of the Church and with him the compiler of the Gospel of John, is accomplished through the revelation of the Son. This mystic also discusses a vision which is preserved in the ''Philosophumena'' of Hippolytus:{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=855}}\n{{Quote|Valentinus ... had seen an infant child lately born; and questioning (this child), he proceeded to inquire who it might be. And (the child) replied, saying that he himself is the Logos, and then subjoined a sort of tragic legend...''<ref>Hippolytus ''Philosophumena'' 6, 37</ref>}}\nWith celestial enthusiasm Valentinus here surveys and depicts the heavenly world of Aeons, and its connection with the lower world. Exalted joy of battle and a valiant courage breathe forth in the sermon in which Valentinus addresses the faithful:\n{{Quote|Ye are from the beginning immortal and children of eternal life, and desire to divide death amongst you like a prey, in order to destroy it and utterly to annihilate it, that thus death may die in you and through you, for if ye dissolve the world, and are not yourselves dissolved, then are ye lords over creation and over all that passes away.''{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=855}}<ref>Clemens iv. 13, 91</ref>}}\n\n==Sacraments==\nThe authorities for the sacramental practices of the Valentinians are preserved especially in the accounts of the [[Marcosians]] given in Irenaeus i. 13 and 20, and in the last section of Clement of Alexandria's ''Excerpta ex Theodoto''.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=855}}\n\nIn almost all the sacramental prayers of the Gnostics handed down to us by Irenaeus, the Mother is the object of the invocation. There are moreover various figures in the fully developed system of the Valentinians who are in the Gnostic's mind when he calls upon the Mother; sometimes it is the fallen Achamoth, sometimes the higher Sophia abiding in the celestial world, sometimes ''Aletheia'', the consort of the supreme heavenly father, but it is always the same idea, the Mother, on whom the faith of the Gnostics is fixed. Thus a baptismal confession of faith of the Gnostics<ref name=\"Irenaeus i. 21, 3\">Irenaeus i. 21, 3</ref> runs: \n{{Quote|In the name of the unknown Father of all, by Aletheia, the Mother of all, by the name which descended upon Jesus.''{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=855}}}}\n\n===Bridal Chamber===\nThe chief sacrament of the Valentinians seems to have been that of the bridal chamber (''nymphon'').{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=855}} The ''[[Gospel of Philip]],'' a probable Valentinian text, reads:\n{{Quote|There were three buildings specifically for sacrifice in Jerusalem. The one facing the west was called \u201cThe Holy\u201d. Another, facing south, was called \u201cThe Holy of the Holy\u201d. The third, facing east, was called \u201cThe Holy of the Holies\u201d, the place where only the high priest enters. Baptism is \u201cthe Holy\u201d building. Redemption is the \u201cHoly of the Holy\u201d. \u201cThe Holy of the Holies\u201d is the bridal chamber. Baptism includes the resurrection and the redemption; the redemption (takes place) in the bridal chamber.''}}\n\nAs Sophia was united with the Saviour, her bridegroom, so the faithful would experience a union with their angel in the Pleroma (cf. the \u201c[[Higher Self]]\u201d or \u201c[[Holy Guardian Angel]]\u201d). The ritual of this sacrament is briefly indicated: \u201cA few of them prepare a bridal chamber and in it go through a form of consecration, employing certain fixed formulae, which are repeated over the person to be initiated, and stating that a spiritual marriage is to be performed after the pattern of the higher Syzygia.\u201d<ref name=\"Irenaeus i. 21, 3\"/> Through a fortunate chance, a liturgical formula which was used at this sacrament appears to be preserved, though in a garbled form and in an entirely different connection, the author seeming to have been uncertain as to its original meaning. It runs:\n{{Quote|I will confer my favor upon thee, for the father of all sees thine angel ever before his face ... we must now become as one; receive now this grace from me and through me; deck thyself as a bride who awaits her bridegroom, that thou mayest become as I am, and I as thou art. Let the seed of light descend into thy bridal chamber; receive the bridegroom and give place to him, and open thine arms to embrace him. Behold, grace has descended upon thee.''{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=856}}<ref>[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XIII.|Irenaeus i. 23, 3]]</ref>}}\n\nOther key features of the doctrine of the Bridal Chamber included the use of mirrors as part of the decor and the idea that those who had partaken in the rituals would be able to beget children in the world to come.\n\n===Baptism===\nBesides this the Gnostics already practiced [[baptism]], using the same form in all essentials as that of the Christian Church. The name given to baptism, at least among certain bodies, was ''apolytrosis'' (liberation); the baptismal formulae have been mentioned above.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=856}}\n\nThe Gnostics are baptized in the mysterious name which also descended upon [[Baptism of Jesus|Jesus at his baptism]].{{Clarification needed|date=November 2018}} The angels of the Gnostics have also had to be baptized in this name, in order to bring about redemption for themselves and the souls belonging to them.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=856}}<ref name=\"Excerpta ex Theodoto, 22\">''Excerpta ex Theodoto'', 22</ref>\n\nIn the baptismal formulae the sacred name of the Redeemer is mentioned over and over again. In one of the formulae occur the words: \u201cI would enjoy thy name, Saviour of Truth.\u201d The concluding formula of the baptismal ceremony is: \u201cPeace over all upon whom the Name rests.\u201d<ref name=\"Irenaeus i. 21, 3\"/> This name pronounced at baptism over the faithful has above all the significance that the name will protect the soul in its ascent through the heavens, conduct it safely through all hostile powers to the lower heavens, and procure it access to Horos, who frightens back the lower souls by his [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] word.<ref name=\"Excerpta ex Theodoto, 22\"/> And for this life also baptism, in consequence of the pronouncing of the protecting name over the baptized person, accomplishes his liberation from the lower daemonic powers. Before baptism the ''Heimarmene'' is supreme, but after baptism the soul is free from her.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=856}}<ref>''Excerpta ex Theodoto''. 77</ref>\n\n===Death===\nWith baptism was also connected the anointing with oil, and hence we can also understand the death sacrament occurring among some Valentinians consisting in an anointing with a mixture of oil and water.<ref name=\"Irenaeus i. 21, 4\"/> This death sacrament has naturally the express object of assuring the soul the way to the highest heaven \u201cso that the soul may be intangible and invisible to the higher mights and powers\u201d.<ref>Irenaeus ''loc. cit.''</ref> In this connection we also find a few formulae which are entrusted to the faithful, so that their souls may pronounce them on their journey upwards. One of these formulae runs:\n{{Quote|I am a son from the Father \u2013 the Father who had a pre-existence, and a son in Him who is pre-existent. I have come to behold all things, both those which belong to myself and others, although, strictly speaking, they do not belong to others, but to Achamoth, who is female in nature, and made these things for herself. For I derive being from Him who is pre-existent, and I come again to my own place whence I went forth...''<ref>Irenaeus i. 21, 5</ref>}}\n\nAnother formula is appended, in which there is a distinction in the invocation between the higher and lower Sophia. Another prayer of the same style is to be found in Irenaeus i. 13, and it is expressly stated that after prayer is pronounced the Mother throws the [[Cap of invisibility|Homeric helmet]] (cf. the ''[[Tarnhelm]]'') over the faithful soul, and so makes him invisible to the mights and powers which surround and attack him.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=856}}\n\n===Reaction===\nOn the other hand, a reaction took place here and there against the sacramental rites. A pure piety, rising above mere sacramentalism, breathes in the words of the Gnostics preserved in ''Excerpta ex Theodoto'', 78, 2:\n{{Quote|But not baptism alone sets us free, but knowledge (''gnosis''): who we were, what we have become, where we were, whither we have sunk, whither we hasten, whence we are redeemed, what is birth and what rebirth.''{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=856}}}}\n\n==Relationship with the Church==\nThe distinction between the human and divine Saviour was a major point of contention between the Valentinians and the Church. Valentinus separated Christ into three figures; the spiritual, the psychical and material. Each of the three Christ figures had its own meaning and purpose.<ref>Rudolph 1977, 166</ref> They acknowledged that Christ suffered and died, but believed that \u201cin his incarnation, Christ transcended human nature so that he could prevail over death by divine power\u201d.<ref>Pagels 1979, 96</ref> These beliefs are what caused Irenaeus to say of the Valentinians, \u201cCertainly they confess with their tongues the one Jesus Christ, but in their minds they divide him.\u201d<ref>Rudolph 1977, 155</ref> In one passage in the account of Irenaeus, it is directly stated that the redeemer assumed a psychical body to redeem the psychical, for the spiritual already belong by nature to the celestial world and no longer require any ''historical'' redemption, while the material is incapable of redemption,<ref name=\"Irenaeus i. 6, 1\"/> as \u201cflesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption\u201d.<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:50}}</ref>\n\nMany Valentinian traditions and practices also clashed with those of the Church. They often met at unauthorized gatherings and rejected ecclesiastical authority, based on their belief that they were all equal. Members of the movement took turns administering sacraments, as well as preaching.<ref name=\"Holroyd 1994, 33\">Holroyd 1994, 33</ref> Among the Valentinians, women were considered to be equal, or at least nearly equal to men. There were female prophets, teachers, healers, evangelists and even priests, which was very different from the Church's view of women at the time.<ref>Pagels 1979, 60</ref> Valentinians held normal jobs, got married and raised children just like Christians; however they regarded these pursuits as being less important than gnosis, which was to be achieved individually.<ref>Pagels 1979, 146</ref> The beliefs of the Valentinians were much more oriented towards the individual than the group, and [[salvation]] was not seen as being universal, as it was in the Church.\n\nThe main disagreements between the Valentinians and the Church were in the notions that God and the creator were two separate entities, the idea that the creator was flawed and formed man and Earth out of ignorance and confusion, and the separation of Christ's human form and divine form. Church authorities believed that Valentinian theology was \u201ca wickedly casuistic way of subverting their authority and thereby threatening the ecclesiastical order with anarchy.\u201d<ref name=\"Holroyd 1994, 33\"/> The practices and rituals of the Valentinians were also different from those of the Christian Church; however they considered themselves to be Christians and not pagans or heretics. By referring to themselves as Christians they worsened their relationship with the Church, who viewed them not only as heretics, but as rivals.<ref>Rudolph 1977, 206</ref>\n\nAlthough the Valentinians publicly professed their faith in one God, \u201cin their own private meetings they insisted on discriminating between the popular image of God \u2013 as master, king, lord, creator, and judge \u2013 and what that image represented: God understood as the ultimate source of all being.\u201d<ref name=\"Pagels 1979, 32\">Pagels 1979, 32</ref> Aside from the Church fathers, however, \u201cthe majority of Christians did not recognize the followers of Valentinus as heretics. Most could not tell the difference between Valentinian and orthodox teaching.\u201d<ref name=\"Pagels 1979, 32\"/> This was partially because Valentinus used many books that now belong to the Old and New Testaments as a basis for interpretation in his own writing. He based his work on proto-orthodox Christian canon instead of on Gnostic scripture, and his style was similar to that of early Christian works. In this way, Valentinus tried to bridge the gap between Gnostic religion and early Catholicism.<ref>Layton (ed.) 1987, xxii</ref> By attempting to bridge this gap, however, Valentinus and his followers became the proverbial [[wolf in sheep's clothing|wolves in sheep's clothing]]. \u201cThe apparent similarity with orthodox teaching only made this heresy more dangerous \u2013 like poison disguised as milk.\u201d<ref name=\"Pagels 1979, 32\"/> Valentinian Gnosticism was \u201cthe most influential and sophisticated form of Gnostic teaching, and by far the most threatening to the church.\u201d<ref name=\"Pagels 1979, 32\"/>\n\n[[History of Christianity#Early Christianity (c.33\u2013325)|Early Christianity]] has been described as \u201ca complex network of individual parties, groups, sects, or denominations.\u201d<ref>Layton (ed.) 1987, xviii</ref> This inconsistency made Gnostic sects such as Valentinianism threatening to the proto-orthodox sect.\n\n==Texts==\nValentinian works are named in reference to the bishop and teacher Valentinius. Circa 153 AD, Valentinius developed a complex cosmology outside the Sethian tradition. At one point he was close to being appointed the Bishop of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]] of what is now the [[Roman Catholic Church]].
