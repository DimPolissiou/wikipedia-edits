Once Aqua is purified by Sora and Riku, she leads them to Castle Oblivion which she restores to its true form as the Land of Departure to revive Ventus despite Vanitas' interference. The group are joined by Kairi and Lea as they face Xehanort and his followers, with a Riku Replica completing the group, at the Keyblade Graveyard. After initially losing the fight, Sora once again uses the \"Power of Waking\" to restore the guardians and call upon the \"Lingering Will\" armour, to assist in the fight.

But Xigbar, revealed to be the current incarnation of the ancient Keyblade Master Luxu from the time of the Keyblade War, is revealed to have manipulated Xehanort from the start and summons the Foretellers, his fellow Keyblade Masters, to the present for the next phase of his mission. A year later, all attempts to find a clue to Sora's current whereabouts had proven to be futile, however Riku then learns that a clue, lies within his dreams. Elsewhere, Sora meets Yozora, a supposedly fictional character from a video game. During their exchange Yozora claims that he is tasked to \"save Sora\" and the world is transported into Shibuya. Sora is challenged to a fight by Yozora, whom he defeats. Yozora fades away as Sora returns to The Final World.

The games are driven by a linear progression from one story event to the next, usually shown in the form of a [[cutscene]], though there are numerous [[Quest (gaming)|side quests]] available that provide bonus benefits to the characters. In most games, the player primarily controls the principal protagonist of the series, [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]]. Sora is usually accompanied by Donald Duck and Goofy, who are [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence-controlled]] [[Non-player characters|non-playable characters]] that aid Sora in battle. In the first and third game, their behavior can be altered to suit different combat objectives. The games feature real-time combat that incorporates physical attacks, magic, and summonings, though each game handles battles differently. The game also allows for items to be used on the field of battle to heal oneself or one's party members.\n\n[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)#Gummi Ship|Gummi Ships]] are another common element of the series, which serve as the main mode of transportation between worlds in the games.

Sora later discovers Eraqus's Keyblade on the beach and uses it to open a door to the Realm of Darkness, finding Aqua who has been consumed by darkness after Ansem was abducted by Xehanort's Heartless. Once Aqua is purified by Sora and Riku, she leads them to Castle Oblivion which she restores to its true form as the Land of Departure to revive Ventus despite Vanitas' interference. The group are joined by Kairi and Lea as they face Xehanort and his followers, with a Riku Replica completing the group, at the Keyblade Graveyard. After initially losing the fight, Sora once again uses the \"Power of Waking\" to restore the guardians and call upon the \"Lingering Will\" armour, to assist in the fight. Afterwards it was revealed that Saix and Vexen sabotaged the Real organizations plan by restoring Roxas as Sora's group manage to defeat all of Xehanort's remaining selves while freeing Xion and Terra from his control. But Xehanort kills Kairi to force Sora to manifest the \u03c7-blade, revealing his true plan is to use the true Kingdom Hearts to wipe the slate on reality clean before finally being defeated. Xehanort departs with Eraqus's spirit into the light as Sora closes Kingdom Hearts. Sora also sacrifices himself by using the \"Power of Waking\" once more to revive Kairi. Sometime later, all the guardians, including their close friends and allies, celebrate victory at Destiny Islands. But Xigbar, revealed to be the current incarnation of the ancient Keyblade Master Luxu from the time of the Keyblade War, is revealed to have manipulated Xehanort from the start and summons the Foretellers, his fellow Keyblade Masters, to the present for the next phase of his mission. A year later, all attempts to find a clue to Sora's current whereabouts had proven to be futile, however Riku then learns that a clue, lies within his dreams. Elsewhere, Sora meets Yozora, a supposedly fictional character from a video game. During their exchange Yozora claims that he is tasked to \"save Sora\" and the world is transported into Shibuya. Sora is challenged to a fight by Yozora, whom he defeats. Yozora fades away as Sora returns to The Final World. Both Sora and Yozora wonder if their meeting was real, with neither character making sense of it. \n\n[[File:Map Kingdom Hearts Storyline Basis.png|thumb|upright=4.75|center|The Kingdom Hearts timeline.]]\n\n===Gameplay===\nThe ''Kingdom Hearts'' games contain elements of [[action game|action]] [[role-playing video game]]s with [[hack and slash|hack-and-slash]] elements. The games are driven by a linear progression from one story event to the next, usually shown in the form of a [[cutscene]], though there are numerous [[Quest (gaming)|side quests]] available that provide bonus benefits to the characters. In most games, the player primarily controls the principal protagonist of the series, [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]]. Sora is usually accompanied by Donald Duck and Goofy, who are [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence-controlled]] [[Non-player characters|non-playable characters]] that aid Sora in battle. In the first and third game, their behavior can be altered to suit different combat objectives. The games feature real-time combat that incorporates physical attacks, magic, and summonings, though each game handles battles differently. The game also allows for items to be used on the field of battle to heal oneself or one's party members.\n\n[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)#Gummi Ship|Gummi Ships]] are another common element of the series, which serve as the main mode of transportation between worlds in the games.

It is on the border of [[Nottinghamshire]], and merges into the towns of [[Aldercar]] (to the north) and [[Heanor]] (to the southwest).  Across the [[River Erewash]] is the Nottinghamshire town of [[Eastwood, Nottinghamshire|Eastwood]].  It is part of the [[Aldercar and Langley Mill]] parish. (The boundary used to be the River Erewash, but the boundary was moved in 1992 and is now the A610; this means that the Erewash Canal basin is now in Langley Mill.)<ref>Local Government Boundary Commission for England Report No. 599</ref> [[Langley, Derbyshire|Langley]] (''not'' Langley Mill) is in the [[Heanor and Loscoe]] parish.\n\n==History==\nOriginally named ''Long Lea'', the village of Langley Mill was a major employer throughout the mid 1900s with many companies including The Flour Mill, [[Langley Mill Pottery]], [[Aristoc|Aristoc & Co Ltd]], G.R. Turners, and Vic Hallam Limited.\n\n[[Aristoc|Aristoc & Co Limited]] on North Street became a target for German Bombers during the [[Second World War]].

To clearly articulate the essential and unique activities of human use ... represents, for me, the excitement of the design process.<ref name=\"Emanuel\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Critical assessment==\nKent Hurley says that Clifford Wiens was able \"to distill a building to its essence and to express the distillation in simple floor plans and eye-catching forms\", pointing out that Wiens is evidently preoccupied with \"rigid and simple geometry\" in his \"formal and static\" plans, but \"lightens his seriousness\" in the three-dimensional form itself, where he \"achieves some of the memorable effects that have enhanced his reputation.\"\"<ref name=\"Emanuel\" />\n\nWilliam P. Thompson describes Wiens' work as reflecting both [[corporate architecture|corporate]] [[modern architecture]] and the broader [[expressionist architecture|expressionist]] movement, with a distinctive approach to structure and form; an experimental [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]], but with \"an expressive formal aesthetic and a respectful sensitivity to context and the surrounding landscape.\"<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> A conscious reference to the ubiquitous prairie horizon is Wiens' most persistent structural signature, as he himself points out in an episode of ''Edifice & Us'':<blockquote>I like to create this horizon line right through the building, and I get a lot of pleasure out of doing that and you find that a lot in my buildings.

To clearly articulate the essential and unique activities of human use ... represents, for me, the excitement of the design process.<ref name=\"Emanuel\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Critical assessment==\nKent Hurley says that Clifford Wiens was able \"to distill a building to its essence and to express the distillation in simple floor plans and eye-catching forms\", pointing out that Wiens is evidently preoccupied with \"rigid and simple geometry\" in his \"formal and static\" plans, but \"lightens his seriousness\" in the three-dimensional form itself, where he \"achieves some of the memorable effects that have enhanced his reputation.\"\"<ref name=\"Emanuel\" />\n\nWilliam P. Thompson describes Wiens' work as reflecting both [[corporate architecture|corporate]] [[modern architecture]] and the broader [[expressionist architecture|expressionist]] movement, with a distinctive approach to structure and form; an experimental [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]], but with \"an expressive formal aesthetic and a respectful sensitivity to context and the surrounding landscape.\"<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> A conscious reference to the ubiquitous prairie horizon is Wiens' most persistent structural signature, as he himself points out in an episode of ''Edifice & Us'':<blockquote>I like to create this horizon line right through the building, and I get a lot of pleasure out of doing that and you find that a lot in my buildings. There's a line going right through as if the building is floating... What belongs to the ground belongs to the ground and what belongs to the sky belongs to the sky and they all just meet on the horizon line.<ref name=\"Wolfson\">{{cite web |last1=Wolfson |first1=Steve (director) |title=Architect Clifford Wiens Industrial Chic |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtveUhqGdtQ&list=PLhdQmDNFVDBiBqy4nLVFRzr2wwmrOOP_C&index=11&t=0s |via=YouTube |accessdate=26 January 2020 |format=video (TV broadcast)}}</ref></blockquote>\nHurley emphasizes this \"standard technique\" in his own assessment, suggesting that Wiens wants to do two things: \"to express in built form the horizontality of his sites and also to interrupt this horizontality visually in order to make his building stand out as an 'event'\"; the \"floating roof structure\" serves as a \"flag\" which Wiens frequently enhances by sinking the base of the building into the ground as in John Nugent's Studio and the Silton Chapel.<ref name=\"Emanuel\" />\n\nBernard Flaman identifies similarities among such diverse works as the Heating and Cooling Plant, the Silton Chapel, and the Nugent Studio despite their \"radically different\" purposes and being formally and materially unique, exhibiting \"strong, simple forms\" and \"ignoring modernism's dogmatic side and the dictum of flat roofs\".<ref name=\"Flaman0\" /> All three find ways of filtering \"the strong prairie sunlight\" and  establish \"a delicate relationship with the landscape.\"<blockquote>Most striking, however, is the way each building springs from the combination of a structural and an architectural idea, beginning with a close analysis of tension and compression elements that are resolved with architectural details of startling invention.<ref name=\"Flaman0\" /></blockquote>\n\nTrevor Boddy summarizes the body of work as a bold range of buildings combining \"the pragmatism and romanticism that co-exist at the heart of prairie culture.\"<ref name=\"Boddy\" /> It is \"widely recognized\" that Wiens was one of three architects from Western Canada (the others being [[Douglas Cardinal]] and [[Etienne Gaboury]]) who were born in and worked across the region and, despite their diverse backgrounds, forged a distinctive \"[[Canadian Prairies|Prairie]]\" regional architecture that blended [[First Nations]] and colonial traditions,<ref name=\"Livesey\" /> but Boddy asserts that Wiens stands out \"even among this distinguished company for the rigour and originality of his construction details, some of them born of his training and parallel career as an industrial designer.\"<ref name=\"Boddy\" /> [[Arthur Erickson]] once declared: \"Not only is he Saskatchewan's finest architect ever, but Clifford Wiens' work is of international importance.\"<ref name=\"Lam\" /> After his death, Boddy said: \"There's almost no debate that Clifford Wiens is the finest architect ever to practice in Saskatchewan.\"<ref name=\"Atter\" /> A month later, he lamented that the architect's reputation has not spread very widely, in part because of his geographic isolation, and that while the work is included in most of the major historical surveys of Canadian architecture, Boddy believes it is underrepresented: \"He was and remains one of the most undocumented of the geniuses of Canadian architecture.\"<ref name=\"Bozikovic\" />\n\n==Legacy==\nThe architectural archive left by Clifford Wiens resides at the University of Regina.<ref name=\"Lam\" /> The archive, or fonds, includes 5,200 architectural drawings, 100 photographs, about 120 presentation panels, and 19 slides, as well as personal, professional, and business records from 1953 to 1990 (as of January 2020).<ref name=\"Fonds\" />\n\nThere has been a failure of upkeep for many of Wiens' private projects like the Silton Chapel, which Bernard Flaman found coming apart due to moisture rotting the wooden beams in 2015.
