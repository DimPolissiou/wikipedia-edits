They were edited by [[Baillie Tolkien]], second wife of his youngest son, [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]]. The book was warmly received by critics, and it has been suggested that elements of the stories inspired parts of Tolkien's ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe stories are told in the format of a series of letters, told either from the point of view of Father Christmas or his elvish secretary. They document the adventures and misadventures of Father Christmas and his helpers, including the North Polar Bear and his two sidekick cubs, Paksu and Valkotukka.

R. R. Tolkien]] between 1920 and 1943 for his children, from [[Father Christmas]]. They were released posthumously by the Tolkien estate on 2 September 1976, the 3rd anniversary of Tolkien\u2019s death. They were edited by [[Baillie Tolkien]], second wife of his youngest son, [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]]. The book was warmly received by critics, and it has been suggested that elements of the stories inspired parts of Tolkien's ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe stories are told in the format of a series of letters, told either from the point of view of Father Christmas or his elvish secretary. They document the adventures and misadventures of Father Christmas and his helpers, including the North Polar Bear and his two sidekick cubs, Paksu and Valkotukka. The stories include descriptions of the massive fireworks that create the [[Aurora (astronomy)|northern lights]] and how Polar Bear manages to get into trouble on more than one occasion.\n\nThe 1939 letter has Father Christmas making reference to the [[Second World War]],<ref name=willardreview /> while some of the later letters feature Father Christmas' battles against Goblins which were subsequently interpreted as being a reflection of Tolkien's views on the [[Nazi Party|German Menace]].<ref>[[#walsh|Walsh (2001)]]: p. 63</ref>\n\n==Publication==\nThe letters themselves were written over a period of over 20 years to entertain Tolkien's children each Christmas.

Rather than just providing lists of proteins identified in a certain sample, quantitative proteomics yields information about the physiological differences between two biological samples. For example, this approach can be used to compare samples from healthy and diseased patients.  Quantitative proteomics is mainly performed by [[two-dimensional gel electrophoresis]] (2-DE) or mass spectrometry (MS).  However, a recent developed method of [[quantitative dot blot]] (QDB) analysis is able to measure both the absolute and relative quantity of an individual proteins in the sample in high throughput format, thus open a new direction for proteomic research. In contrast to 2-DE, which requires MS for the downstream protein identification, MS technology can identify and quantify the changes.\n\n== Quantification using spectrophotometry ==\nThe concentration of a certain protein in a sample may be determined using spectrophotometric procedures.<ref>Ninfa, Ballou, Benore. Fundamental Approaches to Biochemistry and Biotechnology, 2nd edition 2010. Fitzgerald Science Press, Bethesda, MD.</ref> The concentration of a protein can be determined by measuring the OD at 280&nbsp;nm on a spectrophotometer, which can be used with a standard curve assay to quantify the presence of Tryptophan, Tyrosine, and Phenylalanine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Whitaker|first=John R.|last2=Granum|first2=Per Einar|title=An absolute method for protein determination based on difference in absorbance at 235 and 280 nm |journal=Analytical Biochemistry|volume=109|issue=1|pages=156\u2013159|doi=10.1016/0003-2697(80)90024-x|pmid=7469012|year=1980}}</ref> However, this method is not the most accurate because the composition of proteins can vary greatly and this method would not be able to quantify proteins that do not contain the aforementioned amino acids. This method is also inaccurate due to the possibility of nucleic acid contamination. Other more accurate spectrophotometric procedures for protein quantification include the [[Biuret test|Biuret]], [[Lowry protein assay|Lowry]], [[Bca assay|BCA]], and [[Bradford protein assay|Bradford]] methods.\n\n==Quantification using two dimensional electrophoresis ==\nTwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) represents one of the main technologies for quantitative proteomics with advantages and disadvantages. 2-DE provides information about the protein quantity, charge, and mass of the intact protein. It has limitations for the analysis of proteins larger than 150 kDa or smaller than 5kDa and low solubility proteins. Quantitative MS has higher sensitivity but does not provide information about the intact protein.\n\nClassical 2-DE based on post-electrophoretic dye staining has limitations: at least three technical replicates are required to verify the reproducibility.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} [[Difference gel electrophoresis]] (DIGE) uses fluorescence-based labeling of the proteins prior to separation has increased the precision of quantification as well as the sensitivity in the protein detection.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Therefore, DIGE represents the current main approach for the 2-DE based study of proteomes.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n== Quantification using mass spectrometry ==\n[[File:Mass Spectrometry Quantitative Proteomic Workflows.png|thumb|437x437px|Examples of quantitative proteomic workflows.

Quantitative MS has higher sensitivity but can provide only limited  information about the intact protein. Quantitative MS has been used for both discovery and targeted proteomic analysis to understand global proteomic dynamics in cells, tissues or organisms.\n\nFor quantitative MS, a commonly applied approach is [[isotope-coded affinity tag]]s (ICAT), which uses two reagents with heavy and light isotopes, respectively, and a biotin affinity tag to modify cysteine containing peptides. This technology has been used to label whole ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' cells,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Oda Y, Huang K, Cross FR, Cowburn D, Chait BT | title = Accurate quantitation of protein expression and site-specific phosphorylation | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 96 | issue = 12 | pages = 6591\u20136 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10359756 | pmc = 21959 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.12.6591 | bibcode = 1999PNAS...96.6591O }}\n</ref> and, in conjunction with [[mass spectrometry]], helped lay the foundation of quantitative proteomics.\n\n===Relative and absolute quantification===\n\nMass spectrometry is not inherently quantitative because of differences in the ionization efficiency and/or detectability of the many peptides in a given sample, which has sparked the development of methods to determine relative and absolute abundance of proteins in samples.<ref name =\"pmid=22665296\"/> The intensity of a peak in a [[mass spectrum]] is not a good indicator of the amount of the analyte in the sample, although differences in peak intensity of the ''same'' analyte between multiple samples accurately reflect relative differences in its abundance.\n\n===Stable isotope labeling in mass spectrometry===\n====Stable isotope labels====\nAn approach for relative quantification that is more costly and time-consuming, though less sensitive to experimental bias than label-free quantification, entails labeling the samples with [[stable isotope]] labels that allow the mass spectrometer to distinguish between identical proteins in separate samples. One type of label, isotopic tags, consist of stable isotopes incorporated into protein crosslinkers that causes a known mass shift of the labeled protein or peptide in the mass spectrum. Differentially labeled samples are combined and analyzed together, and the differences in the peak intensities of the isotope pairs accurately reflect difference in the abundance of the corresponding proteins.\n\nAbsolute proteomic quantification using isotopic peptides entails spiking known concentrations of synthetic, heavy [[isotopologues]] of target peptides into an experimental sample and then performing LC-MS/MS. As with relative quantification using isotopic labels, peptides of equal chemistry co-elute and are analyzed by MS simultaneously. Unlike relative quantification, though, the abundance of the target peptide in the experimental sample is compared to that of the heavy peptide and back-calculated to the initial concentration of the standard using a pre-determined standard curve to yield the absolute quantification of the target peptide.\n\nRelative quantification methods include [[isotope-coded affinity tags]] (ICAT), [[isobaric labeling]] ([[tandem mass tags]] (TMT) and [[isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification]] (iTRAQ)), [[label-free quantification]] metal-coded tags ([[MeCAT]]), [[N-terminal labelling]], stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture ([[SILAC]]), and [[terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates]] (TAILS). A mathematically rigorous approach that integrates peptide intensities and peptide-measurement agreement into confidence intervals for protein ratios has emerged.<ref name=\"Peshkin\">{{cite biorxiv | vauthors = Peshkin L, Ryazanova L, Wuhr M |title=Bayesian Confidence Intervals for Multiplexed Proteomics Integrate Ion-Statistics with Peptide Quantification Concordance..|date=2017|display-authors=etal|biorxiv=10.1101/210476}}</ref>\n\nAbsolute quantification is performed using [[selected reaction monitoring]] (SRM).\n\n====Metal-coded tags====\nMetal-coded tags (MeCAT) method is based on chemical labeling, but rather than using stable isotopes, different lanthanide ions in macrocyclic complexes are used. The quantitative information comes from inductively coupled plasma MS measurements of the labeled peptides. MeCAT can be used in combination with elemental mass spectrometry [[ICP-MS]] allowing first-time absolute quantification of the metal bound by MeCAT reagent to a protein or biomolecule. Thus it is possible to determine the absolute amount of protein down to attomol range using external calibration by metal standard solution.

All mass tags consist of a mass reporter that has a unique number of <sup>13</sup>C substitutions, a mass normalizer that has a unique mass that balances the mass of the tag to make all the tags equal in mass and a reactive moiety that crosslinks to the peptides. These tags are designed to cleave at a specific linker region upon high-energy CID, yielding different-sized tags that are then quantitated by LC-MS/MS. Protein or peptide samples prepared from cells, tissues or biological fluids are labeled in parallel with the isobaric mass tags and combined for analysis. Protein quantitation is accomplished by comparing the intensities of the reporter ions in the MS/MS spectra. Three types of tandem mass tags are available with different reactivity: (1) reactive NHS ester which provides high-efficiency, amine-specific labeling (TMTduplex, TMTsixplex, TMT10plex and TMT11plex), (2) reactive iodacetyl function group which labels sulfhydryl-(-SH) groups (iodoTMT) and (3) reactive alkoxyamine functional group which provides covalent labeling of carbonyl-containing compounds (aminoxyTMT).\n\nA key benefit of isobaric labeling over other quantification techniques (e.g. SILAC, ICAT, Label-free) is the increased multiplex capabilities and thus increased throughput potential. The ability to combine and analyze several samples simultaneously in one LC-MS run eliminates the need to analyze multiple data sets and eliminates run-to-run variation. Multiplexing reduces sample processing variability, improves specificity by quantifying the proteins from each condition simultaneously, and reduces turnaround time for multiple samples. The current available isobaric chemical tags facilitate the simultaneous analysis of up to 11 experimental samples.\n\n===Label-free quantification in mass spectrometry===\nOne approach for relative quantification is to separately analyze samples by MS and compare the spectra to determine peptide abundance in one sample relative to another, as in [[Label-free quantification|label-free]] strategies. It is generally accepted, that while label-free quantification is the least accurate of the quantification paradigms, it is also inexpensive and reliable when put under heavy statistical validation. There are two different methods of quantification in label-free quantitative proteomics: AUC (area under the curve) and spectral counting.\n\n====Methods of label-free quantification====\nAUC is a method by which for a given peptide spectrum in an LC-MS run, the area under the spectral peak is calculated.

Rather than just providing lists of proteins identified in a certain sample, quantitative proteomics yields information about the physiological differences between two biological samples. For example, this approach can be used to compare samples from healthy and diseased patients.  Quantitative proteomics is mainly performed by [[two-dimensional gel electrophoresis]] (2-DE) or mass spectrometry (MS).  However, a recent developed method of [[quantitative dot blot]] (QDB) analysis is able to measure both the absolute and relative quantity of an individual proteins in the sample in high throughput format, thus open a new direction for proteomic research.

One type of label, isotopic tags, consist of stable isotopes incorporated into protein crosslinkers that causes a known mass shift of the labeled protein or peptide in the mass spectrum. Differentially labeled samples are combined and analyzed together, and the differences in the peak intensities of the isotope pairs accurately reflect difference in the abundance of the corresponding proteins.\n\nAbsolute proteomic quantification using isotopic peptides entails spiking known concentrations of synthetic, heavy [[isotopologues]] of target peptides into an experimental sample and then performing LC-MS/MS. As with relative quantification using isotopic labels, peptides of equal chemistry co-elute and are analyzed by MS simultaneously. Unlike relative quantification, though, the abundance of the target peptide in the experimental sample is compared to that of the heavy peptide and back-calculated to the initial concentration of the standard using a pre-determined standard curve to yield the absolute quantification of the target peptide.\n\nRelative quantification methods include [[isotope-coded affinity tags]] (ICAT), [[isobaric labeling]] ([[tandem mass tags]] (TMT) and [[isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification]] (iTRAQ)), [[label-free quantification]] metal-coded tags ([[MeCAT]]), [[N-terminal labelling]], stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture ([[SILAC]]), and [[terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates]] (TAILS).

Quantification is achieved with through ion counts, the measurement of the amount of an ion at a specific retention time.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Neilson KA, Ali NA, Muralidharan S, Mirzaei M, Mariani M, Assadourian G, Lee A, van Sluyter SC, Haynes PA | title = Less label, more free: approaches in label-free quantitative mass spectrometry | journal = Proteomics | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 535\u201353 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21243637 | doi = 10.1002/pmic.201000553 }}</ref> Discretion is required for the standardization of the raw data.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = America AH, Cordewener JH | title = Comparative LC-MS: a landscape of peaks and valleys | journal = Proteomics | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 731\u201349 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18297651 | doi = 10.1002/pmic.200700694 }}</ref> High-resolution spectrometer can alleviated problems that arise when trying to make data reproducible, however  much of the work regarding normalizing data can be done through software such as [[OpenMS]], and MassView.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Weixun|last2=Zhou|first2=Haihong|last3=Lin|first3=Hua|last4=Roy|first4=Sushmita|last5=Shaler|first5=Thomas A.|last6=Hill|first6=Lander R.|last7=Norton|first7=Scott|last8=Kumar|first8=Praveen|last9=Anderle|first9=Markus|date=2003-09-01|title=Quantification of Proteins and Metabolites by Mass Spectrometry without Isotopic Labeling or Spiked Standards|journal=Analytical Chemistry|volume=75|issue=18|pages=4818\u20134826|doi=10.1021/ac026468x|pmid=14674459|issn=0003-2700}}</ref>\n\nSpectral counting involves counting the spectra of an identified protein and then standardizing using some form of normalization.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lundgren DH, Hwang SI, Wu L, Han DK | title = Role of spectral counting in quantitative proteomics | journal = Expert Review of Proteomics | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 39\u201353 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20121475 | doi = 10.1586/epr.09.69 }}</ref> Typically this is done with an abundant peptide mass selection (MS)  that is then fragmented and then MS/MS spectra are counted.<ref name=\":0\" /> Multiple samplings of the protein peak is required for accurate estimation of the protein abundance because of the complex physiochemical nature of peptides. Thus, optimization for MS/MS experiments is a constant concern. One alternative to get around this problems is use a data independent technique that cycles between high and low collision energies. Thus a large survey of all possible precursor and product ions is collected. This is limited, however, by the mass spectrometry software's ability to recognize and match peptide patterns of associations between the precursor and product ions.\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:Journal.pone.0095194.g001.TIF|thumb|374x374px|Work flow of the Quantification of the physiological differences in \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells in mice using computer prediction (A) and SILAC isotope-label quantification(B).

Especially in the fields of drug and biomarker discovery. \nLC-MS/MS techniques have started to over take more traditional methods like the western blot and ELISA due to the cumbersome nature of labeling different and separating proteins using these methods and the more global analysis of protein quantification. Mass spectrometry methods are more sensitive to difference in protein structure like post-translational modification and thus can quantify differing modifications to proteins. Quantitative proteomics can circumvent these issues, only needing sequence information to be performed. Disadvantages, however, in sensitivity and analysis time must be kept in consideration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bantscheff M, Lemeer S, Savitski MM, Kuster B | title = Quantitative mass spectrometry in proteomics: critical review update from 2007 to the present | journal = Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry | volume = 404 | issue = 4 | pages = 939\u201365 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22772140 | doi = 10.1007/s00216-012-6203-4 }}</ref>\n\n==== Drug discovery ====\nQuantitative proteomics has the largest applications in the protein target identification, protein target validation, and toxicity profiling of [[drug discovery]].<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ohtsuki S, Uchida Y, Kubo Y, Terasaki T | title = Quantitative targeted absolute proteomics-based ADME research as a new path to drug discovery and development: methodology, advantages, strategy, and prospects | journal = Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences | volume = 100 | issue = 9 | pages = 3547\u201359 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21560129 | doi = 10.1002/jps.22612 }}</ref> Drug discovery has been used to investigate protein-protein interaction and, more recently, drug-small molecule interactions.

SRF and Sovereignty Council representatives agreed on the creation of a [[Darfur war crimes court|Special Court for Darfur]] to conduct investigations and trials for [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]] carried out during the [[War in Darfur]] by the al-Bashir presidency and by warlords. ''Two Areas'' negotiations with SPLM-N (al-Hilu) had progressed on six framework agreement points, after a two-week pause, but disagreement remained on SPLM-N (al-Hilu)'s requirement of a secular state in South Kordofan and [[Nuba Mountains]] and [[Blue Nile (state)|Blue Nile]] self-determination. On 24 January on the ''Two Areas'' track, political and security agreements, constituting a ''framework'' agreement, were signed by Hemetti on behalf of the Sovereignty Council and Ahmed El Omda Badi on behalf of SPLM-N (Agar). The agreements give legislative autonomy to South Kordofan and Blue Nile; propose solutions for the sharing of land and other resources, and aim to unify all militias and government soldiers into a single unified Sudanese military body.\n\nOn 26 January, a \"final\" peace agreement for the northern track, including issues of studies for new dams, compensation for people displaced by existing dams, road construction and burial of electronic and nuclear waste, was signed by Shamseldin Kabashi of the Sovereignty Council and Dahab Ibrahim of the [[Kush Movement]]. <ref> [https://www.middleeasteye.net/big-story/can-south-sudans-men-war-lead-country-peace Can South Sudan's men of war lead the country to peace?], by Peter Oborne & Jan-Peter Westad, February 15, 2020.

SRF and Sovereignty Council representatives agreed on the creation of a [[Darfur war crimes court|Special Court for Darfur]] to conduct investigations and trials for [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]] carried out during the [[War in Darfur]] by the al-Bashir presidency and by warlords. ''Two Areas'' negotiations with SPLM-N (al-Hilu) had progressed on six framework agreement points, after a two-week pause, but disagreement remained on SPLM-N (al-Hilu)'s requirement of a secular state in South Kordofan and [[Nuba Mountains]] and [[Blue Nile (state)|Blue Nile]] self-determination. On 24 January on the ''Two Areas'' track, political and security agreements, constituting a ''framework'' agreement, were signed by Hemetti on behalf of the Sovereignty Council and Ahmed El Omda Badi on behalf of SPLM-N (Agar). The agreements give legislative autonomy to South Kordofan and Blue Nile; propose solutions for the sharing of land and other resources, and aim to unify all militias and government soldiers into a single unified Sudanese military body.\n\nOn 26 January, a \"final\" peace agreement for the northern track, including issues of studies for new dams, compensation for people displaced by existing dams, road construction and burial of electronic and nuclear waste, was signed by Shamseldin Kabashi of the Sovereignty Council and Dahab Ibrahim of the [[Kush Movement]]. <ref> [https://www.middleeasteye.net/big-story/can-south-sudans-men-war-lead-country-peace Can South Sudan's men of war lead the country to peace?], by Peter Oborne & Jan-Peter Westad, February 15, 2020.
