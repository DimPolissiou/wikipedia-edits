Each state affiliate has a governing committee, usually consisting of statewide officers elected by state party members and regional representation of one kind or another. Similarly, county, town, city and ward committees, where organized, generally consist of members elected at the local level. State and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction, oversee local conventions and in some cases primaries or caucuses and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law.\n\n=== Membership ===\nSince the Libertarian Party's inception, individuals have been able to join the party as voting members by signing their agreement with the organization's [[Libertarian pledge|membership pledge]], which states that the signer does not advocate the initiation of force to achieve political or social goals. During the mid-1980s and into the early 1990s, this membership category was called an \"instant\" membership, but currently, these are referred to as \"signature members\". People joining the party are also asked to pay dues, which are on a sliding scale starting at $25 per year. Lifetime membership is granted with a $1,500 donation in one calendar year.

[...] Our goal is nothing more nor less than a world set free in our lifetime, and it is to this end that we take these stands\". Its Statement of Principles begins: \"We, the members of the Libertarian Party, challenge the cult of the omnipotent state and defend the rights of the individual\". The Statement of Principles is foundational to the ideology of the party and was created specifically to bind the party to certain core principles with a high parliamentary burden for any amendment.<ref>{{cite web |last = Ann |first = Caryn |url = http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2015/09/d-frank-robinson-the-libertarian-party-statement-of-principles/ |title = D.

The party opposes [[gun control]]. It calls for [[United States Constitution|Constitutional]] limitations on government as well as the elimination of most state functions. It includes a \"Self-determination\" section which quotes from the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and reads: \"Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of individual liberty, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to agree to such new governance as to them shall seem most likely to protect their liberty\". It also includes an \"Omissions\" section which reads: \"Our silence about any other particular government law, regulation, ordinance, directive, edict, control, regulatory agency, activity, or machination should not be construed to imply approval\".<ref name=platform/>\n\nThe party favors minimally regulated markets, a less powerful [[federal government]], strong [[civil liberties]] (including [[LGBT rights]], with the party supporting [[same-sex marriage]]), the [[drug liberalization|liberalization of drug laws]], [[separation of church and state]], [[open immigration]], [[non-interventionism]] and [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] in diplomatic relations, [[free trade]] and [[freedom of movement|free movement]] to all foreign countries and a more representative republic.<ref name=platform>{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title= Libertarian Party: Platform |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = June 6, 2012 }}</ref> The party's position on abortion is that government should stay out of the matter and leave it to the individual, but recognizes that some \"good-faith\" opinions on this issue are different.<ref name=\"abortion1.4\">{{cite web |work = Platform |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = 1.4 Abortion |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = March 8, 2013 }}</ref> [[Ron Paul]], one of the former presidential nominees of the Libertarian Party in 1988, is strictly [[anti-abortion]].

modern [[welfare state]]. It adopts pro-[[civil liberties]] and pro-[[cultural liberalism|cultural liberal]] approaches to cultural and social issues. Paul H. Rubin, professor of law and economics at [[Emory University]], believes that while [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] generally seek to control economic activities and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] generally seek to control consumption activities such as sexual behavior, abortion and so on, the Libertarian Party is the largest political party in the United States that advocates few or no regulations in what he deems \"social\" and \"economic\" issues.<ref>{{cite book |title = Darwinian politics: The Evolutionary Origin of Freedom |first = Paul H. |last = Rubin |year = 2002 |publisher = [[Rutgers University Press]] |isbn = 978-0-8135-3096-3 |page = 130 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=qZ1mSn7BoLMC&pg=PA130 }}</ref>\n\n=== Economic issues ===\nThe \"poverty and welfare\" issues page of the Libertarian Party's website says that it opposes [[Regulatory economics|regulation]] of capitalist [[Institutional economics|economic institutions]] and advocates dismantling the entirety of the welfare state: <blockquote>We should eliminate the entire social welfare system. This includes eliminating food stamps, subsidized housing, and all the rest.

Seeing the education of children as a parental responsibility, the party would give authority to parents to determine the education of their children at their expense without interference from government. This includes ending [[School corporal punishment in the United States|corporal punishment]] within [[State school|public schools]]. Libertarians have expressed that parents should have control of and responsibility for all funds expended for their children's education.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = January 29, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==== Environment ====\n{{see also|Free-market environmentalism}}\nThe Libertarian Party supports a clean and healthy environment and sensible use of [[natural resources]], believing that private landowners and conservation groups have a vested interest in maintaining such natural resources.<ref name=platform /> The party has also expressed that \"governments, unlike private businesses, are unaccountable for such damage done to the environment and have a terrible track record when it comes to environmental protection\".<ref name=\"Platform\">{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 }}</ref> The party contends that the environment is best protected when individual rights pertaining to natural resources are clearly defined and enforced. The party also contends that [[free market]]s and [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]] (implicitly without government intervention) will stimulate the technological innovations and behavioral changes required to protect the environment and ecosystem because environmental advocates and [[social pressure]] are the most effective means of changing public behavior.<ref name=\"Platform\"/>\n\n==== Fiscal policies ====\nThe Libertarian Party opposes all government intervention and regulation on wages, [[price]]s, [[Renting|rents]], [[Profit (accounting)|profits]], production and [[interest rate]]s and advocate the repeal of all laws banning or restricting the advertising of [[price]]s, products, or services. The party's recent platform calls for the repeal of the [[income tax]], the abolition of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and all federal programs and services, such as the [[Federal Reserve System]]. The party supports the passage of a [[Balanced Budget Amendment]] to the Constitution which they believe will significantly lower the [[National debt of the United States|national debt]], provided that the budget is balanced preferably by cutting expenditures and not by raising taxes. Libertarians favor free-market banking, with unrestricted competition among banks and depository institutions of all types. The party also wants a halt to [[inflationary]] monetary policies and legal tender laws. While the party defends the right of individuals to form corporations, cooperatives and other types of companies, it opposes government [[subsidies]] to business, labor, or any other [[special interest]].<ref name=\"Platform\" />\n\n==== Healthcare ====\nThe Libertarian Party favors a [[Free-market healthcare|free market health care]] system without government oversight, approval, regulation, or licensing. The party states that it \"recognizes the freedom of individuals to determine the level of [[health insurance]] they can afford (if any), the amount of health care they can afford, the care providers they can afford, the medicines and treatments they can use and all other aspects of their [[medical care]], including the many end-of-life decisions that will follow\". They support the repeal of all social insurance policies such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] and favor \"consumer-driven health care\".<ref>{{cite press release |url = https://www.lp.org/news/press-releases/libertarian-party-opposes-health-care-plan |date = March 19, 2010 |title = Libertarian Party opposes health care plan |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = August 2, 2016 }}</ref> The Libertarian Party has been advocating for Americans' ability to purchase health insurance across state lines.\n\n==== Immigration and trade agreements ====\nThe Libertarian Party consistently lobbies for the removal of governmental impediments to free trade. This is because their platform states that \"political freedom and escape from tyranny demand that individuals not be unreasonably constrained by government in the crossing of political boundaries\".<ref name=\"lp.org\">{{cite web |url = https://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 }}</ref> To promote economic freedom, they demand the unrestricted movement of humans as well as financial capital across national borders.

The party supports the right of free persons to associate or not associate in [[Trade union|labor unions]] and believes that employers should have the right to recognize or refuse to recognize a union.<ref name=\"Platform\"/>\n\n==== Retirement and Social Security ====\nThe party believes that retirement planning is the responsibility of the individual, not the government. Libertarians would phase out the current government-sponsored [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] system and transition to a [[Privatization|private]] voluntary system. The Libertarians feel that the proper and most effective source of help for the poor is the voluntary efforts of [[Charitable organization|private groups]] and individuals, believing members of society will become more charitable and civil society will be strengthened as government reduces its activity in that realm.<ref name=\"Platform\" />\n\n=== Social issues ===\nThe Libertarian Party supports the legalization of all [[victimless crimes]],<ref name=\"http://www.lp.org/platform\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/platform|title=Platform &#124; Libertarian Party|publisher=Libertarian Party|date=|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref> including [[Recreational drug use|drugs]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\">{{cite book|title=Politics: An Introduction to Modern Democratic Government|last1=Eagles|first1=Munroe|last2=Johnston|first2=Larry|year=2008|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|isbn=978-1-55111-858-1|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uw9BHYRdtsAC&pg=PA110}}</ref><ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\">{{cite news|first=Karin|last=Miller|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uOwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xewDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6583,6407110&dq=prostitution+libertarian-party&hl=en|title=Libertarian struggle to be taken seriously in presidential race|work=[[Deseret News]]|agency=Associated Press|date=September 12\u201313, 1996}}</ref><ref name=\"Co-founder\">{{cite news|first=Emma|last=Brown|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/23/AR2010112306604.html|title=Co-founder of national Libertarian Party|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"GALLOWAY Libertarian\">{{cite news|first=Angela|last=Galloway|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/For-Libertarians-winning-is-a-work-in-progress-1155744.php |title = For Libertarians, winning is a work in progress|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=October 3, 2004}}</ref> [[Libertarian Party (United States)#Pornography|pornography]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\"/> [[Libertarian Party (United States)#Prostitution|prostitution]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\"/><ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\"/><ref name=\"Co-founder\"/><ref name=\"GALLOWAY Libertarian\"/> [[polygamy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azlp.org/platform.php|publisher=Arizona Libertarian Party|title=Home|accessdate=May 5, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503140844/http://www.azlp.org/platform.php|archivedate=May 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and [[gambling]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding American Government and Politics|first=Duncan|last=Watts|year=2006|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|isbn=978-0-7190-7327-4|page=246|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SIeIARfRc1AC&pg=RA2-PT124}}</ref> supports the removal of restrictions on [[Libertarian Party (United States)#LGBT issues|homosexuality]],<ref name=\"Co-founder\"/> opposes any kind of [[censorship]] and supports [[freedom of speech]],<ref name=\"Freedom of Speech\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/issues/freedom-of-speech|title=Freedom of Speech|publisher=Libertarian Party|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514110414/http://www.lp.org/issues/freedom-of-speech|archivedate=May 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and supports the [[right to keep and bear arms]]<ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\"/> while opposing Federal capital punishment.<ref name=\"ontheissues.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Libertarian_Party_Crime.htm|title=Libertarian Party on Crime|work=OnTheIssues.org|date=|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref> The Libertarian Party's platform states: \"Government does not have the authority to define, license or restrict [[personal relationship]]s.

Some, like the group [[Libertarians for Life]], consider abortion to be an act of aggression from the government or mother against a fetus. Others, like the group Pro-Choice Libertarians, consider denying a woman the right to choose abortion to be an act of aggression from the government against her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pro-choicelibertarians.net/|title=Pro-Choice Libertarians|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Crime and capital punishment ====\n{{see also|Libertarian perspectives on capital punishment}}\nShortly before the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 elections]], the party released a \"Libertarian Party Program on Crime\" in which they criticize the failures of a recently proposed Omnibus Crime Bill, especially detailing how it expands the list of [[capital crime]]s.<ref name=\"ontheissues.org\"/> Denouncing Federal executions, they also describe how the party would increase and safeguard the [[rights of the accused]] in legal settings as well as limit the use of [[excessive force]] by police. Instead, criminal laws would be reduced to violations of the rights of others through either force or fraud with maximum [[restitution]] given to victims of the criminals or negligent persons.<ref name=\"lp.org\"/> In 2016, the party expanded their platform to officially support the repeal of capital punishment.<ref name=\"http://www.lp.org/platform#1.8\">[http://www.lp.org/platform#1.8 \"2016 platform\"].</ref>\n\n==== Freedom of speech and censorship ====\nThe Libertarian Party supports unrestricted freedom of speech and is opposed to any kind of [[censorship]]. The party describes the issue in its website: \"We defend the rights of individuals to unrestricted freedom of speech, [[freedom of the press]] and the right of individuals to [[dissent]] from government itself. [...] We oppose any abridgment of the freedom of speech through government censorship, regulation or control of communications media\". The party claims it is the only political party in the United States \"with an explicit stand against censorship of computer communications in its platform\".<ref name=\"Freedom of Speech\"/>\n\n==== Government reform ====\nThe Libertarian Party favors election systems that are more representative of the [[Electoral district|electorate]] at the [[United States federal government|federal]], state and [[local government|local]] levels. The party platform calls for an end to any tax-financed subsidies to candidates or parties and the repeal of all laws which restrict voluntary financing of election campaigns. As a [[minor party]], it opposes laws that effectively exclude alternative candidates and parties, deny [[ballot access]], [[gerrymander]] districts, or deny the voters their right to consider all legitimate alternatives. Libertarians also promote the use of [[direct democracy]] through the [[referendum]] and [[recall election|recall]] processes.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==== LGBT issues ====\nThe Libertarian Party advocates repealing all laws that control or prohibit homosexuality.<ref name=calp>{{Cite web|url=http://ca.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Platform-of-the-Libertarian-Party-of-California-as-amended-in-Convention-March-3-2012.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403014848/http://ca.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Platform-of-the-Libertarian-Party-of-California-as-amended-in-Convention-March-3-2012.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Platform of the Libertarian Party of California as amended in Convention March 3, 2012|archivedate=April 3, 2015}}</ref> According to the Libertarian Party's platform: \"Sexual orientation, preference, gender, or gender identity should have no impact on the government's treatment of individuals, such as in current marriage, child custody, adoption, immigration or military service laws\".<ref name=Platform/>\n\nGay activist Richard Sincere has pointed to the longstanding support of gay rights by the party, which has supported [[same-sex marriage]] since its first platform was drafted in 1972 (40 years before the Democratic Party adopted same-sex marriage into their platform in 2012).

The proposal was incorporated in a new party-wide strategic plan and a joint platform-program committee proposed a reformatted project platform that isolated talking points on issues, principles and solutions as well as an array of projects for adaptation. This platform, along with a short Summary for talking points, was approved in 2004. Confusion arose when prior to the 2006 convention there was a push to repeal or substantially rewrite the Platform, at the center of which were groups such as the Libertarian Reform Caucus.<ref>\"[http://www.reformthelp.org/  Victory in Portland!

Each state affiliate has a governing committee, usually consisting of statewide officers elected by state party members and regional representation of one kind or another. Similarly, county, town, city and ward committees, where organized, generally consist of members elected at the local level. State and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction, oversee local conventions and in some cases primaries or caucuses and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law.\n\n=== Membership ===\nSince the Libertarian Party's inception, individuals have been able to join the party as voting members by signing their agreement with the organization's [[Libertarian pledge|membership pledge]], which states that the signer does not advocate the initiation of force to achieve political or social goals. During the mid-1980s and into the early 1990s, this membership category was called an \"instant\" membership, but currently, these are referred to as \"signature members\". People joining the party are also asked to pay dues, which are on a sliding scale starting at $25 per year. Lifetime membership is granted with a $1,500 donation in one calendar year. Dues-paying members receive a subscription to the party's national newspaper, ''LP News''.<ref>{{ISSN|8755-1373}}</ref> Since 2006, membership in the party's state affiliates has been separate from membership in the national party,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lpar.org/help/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221021341/http://lpar.org/help/|url-status=dead|title=Help the LPAR \u00ab Libertarian Party of Arkansas|archivedate=February 21, 2012}}</ref> with each state chapter maintaining its own membership rolls.\n\nMost rights to participate in the governance of the party are limited to \"bylaws-sustaining members\" who have either purchased a lifetime membership or donated at least $25 within the past year. Most state parties maintain separate membership, which may be tied to either payment of dues to the state party, or voter registration as a Libertarian, depending on the state's election laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016_LP_Bylaws_and_Convention_Rules_w_2016_JC_Rules.pdf|title=Bylaws|date=2016|website=lp.org}}</ref>\n\n== Platform ==\n{{Duplication|section=yes|dupe=#Political positions|date=September 2019}}\nThe preamble outlines the party's goals: \"As Libertarians, we seek a world of liberty; a world in which all individuals are sovereign over their own lives and no one is forced to sacrifice his or her values for the benefit of others.

Since its founding, the party has apportioned delegate seats to its national convention based on the number of members in each state who have paid minimum dues (with additional delegates given to state affiliates for good performance in winning more votes than normal for the party's presidential candidate). This is the most-used number by party activists. As of December 2017, the Libertarian Party reported that there were 14,445 donating members.<ref name=\"hq.lp.org\"/>\n\nHistorically, dues were $15 throughout the 1980s and in 1991 they were increased to $25. Between February 1, 2006, and the close of the 2006 Libertarian party convention on May 31, 2006, dues were set to $0.<ref name=\"LNC Approves Zero Dues\">\"[http://www.lp.org/lpnews/article_769.shtml LNC Approves Zero Dues]\", ''LP News'', September 1, 2005.

modern [[welfare state]]. It adopts pro-[[civil liberties]] and pro-[[cultural liberalism|cultural liberal]] approaches to cultural and social issues. Paul H. Rubin, professor of law and economics at [[Emory University]], believes that while [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] generally seek to control economic activities and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] generally seek to control consumption activities such as sexual behavior, abortion and so on, the Libertarian Party is the largest political party in the United States that advocates few or no regulations in what he deems \"social\" and \"economic\" issues.<ref>{{cite book |title = Darwinian politics: The Evolutionary Origin of Freedom |first = Paul H. |last = Rubin |year = 2002 |publisher = [[Rutgers University Press]] |isbn = 978-0-8135-3096-3 |page = 130 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=qZ1mSn7BoLMC&pg=PA130 }}</ref>\n\n=== Economic issues ===\nThe \"poverty and welfare\" issues page of the Libertarian Party's website says that it opposes [[Regulatory economics|regulation]] of capitalist [[Institutional economics|economic institutions]] and advocates dismantling the entirety of the welfare state: <blockquote>We should eliminate the entire social welfare system. This includes eliminating food stamps, subsidized housing, and all the rest.

Seeing the education of children as a parental responsibility, the party would give authority to parents to determine the education of their children at their expense without interference from government. This includes ending [[School corporal punishment in the United States|corporal punishment]] within [[State school|public schools]]. Libertarians have expressed that parents should have control of and responsibility for all funds expended for their children's education.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = January 29, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==== Environment ====\n{{see also|Free-market environmentalism}}\nThe Libertarian Party supports a clean and healthy environment and sensible use of [[natural resources]], believing that private landowners and conservation groups have a vested interest in maintaining such natural resources.<ref name=platform /> The party has also expressed that \"governments, unlike private businesses, are unaccountable for such damage done to the environment and have a terrible track record when it comes to environmental protection\".<ref name=\"Platform\">{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 }}</ref> The party contends that the environment is best protected when individual rights pertaining to natural resources are clearly defined and enforced. The party also contends that [[free market]]s and [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]] (implicitly without government intervention) will stimulate the technological innovations and behavioral changes required to protect the environment and ecosystem because environmental advocates and [[social pressure]] are the most effective means of changing public behavior.<ref name=\"Platform\"/>\n\n==== Fiscal policies ====\nThe Libertarian Party opposes all government intervention and regulation on wages, [[price]]s, [[Renting|rents]], [[Profit (accounting)|profits]], production and [[interest rate]]s and advocate the repeal of all laws banning or restricting the advertising of [[price]]s, products, or services. The party's recent platform calls for the repeal of the [[income tax]], the abolition of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and all federal programs and services, such as the [[Federal Reserve System]]. The party supports the passage of a [[Balanced Budget Amendment]] to the Constitution which they believe will significantly lower the [[National debt of the United States|national debt]], provided that the budget is balanced preferably by cutting expenditures and not by raising taxes. Libertarians favor free-market banking, with unrestricted competition among banks and depository institutions of all types. The party also wants a halt to [[inflationary]] monetary policies and legal tender laws. While the party defends the right of individuals to form corporations, cooperatives and other types of companies, it opposes government [[subsidies]] to business, labor, or any other [[special interest]].<ref name=\"Platform\" />\n\n==== Healthcare ====\nThe Libertarian Party favors a [[Free-market healthcare|free market health care]] system without government oversight, approval, regulation, or licensing. The party states that it \"recognizes the freedom of individuals to determine the level of [[health insurance]] they can afford (if any), the amount of health care they can afford, the care providers they can afford, the medicines and treatments they can use and all other aspects of their [[medical care]], including the many end-of-life decisions that will follow\". They support the repeal of all social insurance policies such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] and favor \"consumer-driven health care\".<ref>{{cite press release |url = https://www.lp.org/news/press-releases/libertarian-party-opposes-health-care-plan |date = March 19, 2010 |title = Libertarian Party opposes health care plan |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = August 2, 2016 }}</ref> The Libertarian Party has been advocating for Americans' ability to purchase health insurance across state lines.\n\n==== Immigration and trade agreements ====\nThe Libertarian Party consistently lobbies for the removal of governmental impediments to free trade. This is because their platform states that \"political freedom and escape from tyranny demand that individuals not be unreasonably constrained by government in the crossing of political boundaries\".<ref name=\"lp.org\">{{cite web |url = https://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 }}</ref> To promote economic freedom, they demand the unrestricted movement of humans as well as financial capital across national borders.

The party supports the right of free persons to associate or not associate in [[Trade union|labor unions]] and believes that employers should have the right to recognize or refuse to recognize a union.<ref name=\"Platform\"/>\n\n==== Retirement and Social Security ====\nThe party believes that retirement planning is the responsibility of the individual, not the government. Libertarians would phase out the current government-sponsored [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] system and transition to a [[Privatization|private]] voluntary system. The Libertarians feel that the proper and most effective source of help for the poor is the voluntary efforts of [[Charitable organization|private groups]] and individuals, believing members of society will become more charitable and civil society will be strengthened as government reduces its activity in that realm.<ref name=\"Platform\" />\n\n=== Social issues ===\nThe Libertarian Party supports the legalization of all [[victimless crimes]],<ref name=\"http://www.lp.org/platform\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/platform|title=Platform &#124; Libertarian Party|publisher=Libertarian Party|date=|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref> including [[Recreational drug use|drugs]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\">{{cite book|title=Politics: An Introduction to Modern Democratic Government|last1=Eagles|first1=Munroe|last2=Johnston|first2=Larry|year=2008|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|isbn=978-1-55111-858-1|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uw9BHYRdtsAC&pg=PA110}}</ref><ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\">{{cite news|first=Karin|last=Miller|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uOwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xewDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6583,6407110&dq=prostitution+libertarian-party&hl=en|title=Libertarian struggle to be taken seriously in presidential race|work=[[Deseret News]]|agency=Associated Press|date=September 12\u201313, 1996}}</ref><ref name=\"Co-founder\">{{cite news|first=Emma|last=Brown|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/23/AR2010112306604.html|title=Co-founder of national Libertarian Party|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"GALLOWAY Libertarian\">{{cite news|first=Angela|last=Galloway|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/For-Libertarians-winning-is-a-work-in-progress-1155744.php |title = For Libertarians, winning is a work in progress|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=October 3, 2004}}</ref> [[Libertarian Party (United States)#Pornography|pornography]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\"/> [[Libertarian Party (United States)#Prostitution|prostitution]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\"/><ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\"/><ref name=\"Co-founder\"/><ref name=\"GALLOWAY Libertarian\"/> [[polygamy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azlp.org/platform.php|publisher=Arizona Libertarian Party|title=Home|accessdate=May 5, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503140844/http://www.azlp.org/platform.php|archivedate=May 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and [[gambling]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding American Government and Politics|first=Duncan|last=Watts|year=2006|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|isbn=978-0-7190-7327-4|page=246|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SIeIARfRc1AC&pg=RA2-PT124}}</ref> supports the removal of restrictions on [[Libertarian Party (United States)#LGBT issues|homosexuality]],<ref name=\"Co-founder\"/> opposes any kind of [[censorship]] and supports [[freedom of speech]],<ref name=\"Freedom of Speech\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/issues/freedom-of-speech|title=Freedom of Speech|publisher=Libertarian Party|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514110414/http://www.lp.org/issues/freedom-of-speech|archivedate=May 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and supports the [[right to keep and bear arms]]<ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\"/> while opposing Federal capital punishment.<ref name=\"ontheissues.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Libertarian_Party_Crime.htm|title=Libertarian Party on Crime|work=OnTheIssues.org|date=|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref> The Libertarian Party's platform states: \"Government does not have the authority to define, license or restrict [[personal relationship]]s.

Some, like the group [[Libertarians for Life]], consider abortion to be an act of aggression from the government or mother against a fetus. Others, like the group Pro-Choice Libertarians, consider denying a woman the right to choose abortion to be an act of aggression from the government against her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pro-choicelibertarians.net/|title=Pro-Choice Libertarians|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Crime and capital punishment ====\n{{see also|Libertarian perspectives on capital punishment}}\nShortly before the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 elections]], the party released a \"Libertarian Party Program on Crime\" in which they criticize the failures of a recently proposed Omnibus Crime Bill, especially detailing how it expands the list of [[capital crime]]s.<ref name=\"ontheissues.org\"/> Denouncing Federal executions, they also describe how the party would increase and safeguard the [[rights of the accused]] in legal settings as well as limit the use of [[excessive force]] by police. Instead, criminal laws would be reduced to violations of the rights of others through either force or fraud with maximum [[restitution]] given to victims of the criminals or negligent persons.<ref name=\"lp.org\"/> In 2016, the party expanded their platform to officially support the repeal of capital punishment.<ref name=\"http://www.lp.org/platform#1.8\">[http://www.lp.org/platform#1.8 \"2016 platform\"].</ref>\n\n==== Freedom of speech and censorship ====\nThe Libertarian Party supports unrestricted freedom of speech and is opposed to any kind of [[censorship]]. The party describes the issue in its website: \"We defend the rights of individuals to unrestricted freedom of speech, [[freedom of the press]] and the right of individuals to [[dissent]] from government itself. [...] We oppose any abridgment of the freedom of speech through government censorship, regulation or control of communications media\". The party claims it is the only political party in the United States \"with an explicit stand against censorship of computer communications in its platform\".<ref name=\"Freedom of Speech\"/>\n\n==== Government reform ====\nThe Libertarian Party favors election systems that are more representative of the [[Electoral district|electorate]] at the [[United States federal government|federal]], state and [[local government|local]] levels. The party platform calls for an end to any tax-financed subsidies to candidates or parties and the repeal of all laws which restrict voluntary financing of election campaigns. As a [[minor party]], it opposes laws that effectively exclude alternative candidates and parties, deny [[ballot access]], [[gerrymander]] districts, or deny the voters their right to consider all legitimate alternatives. Libertarians also promote the use of [[direct democracy]] through the [[referendum]] and [[recall election|recall]] processes.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==== LGBT issues ====\nThe Libertarian Party advocates repealing all laws that control or prohibit homosexuality.<ref name=calp>{{Cite web|url=http://ca.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Platform-of-the-Libertarian-Party-of-California-as-amended-in-Convention-March-3-2012.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403014848/http://ca.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Platform-of-the-Libertarian-Party-of-California-as-amended-in-Convention-March-3-2012.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Platform of the Libertarian Party of California as amended in Convention March 3, 2012|archivedate=April 3, 2015}}</ref> According to the Libertarian Party's platform: \"Sexual orientation, preference, gender, or gender identity should have no impact on the government's treatment of individuals, such as in current marriage, child custody, adoption, immigration or military service laws\".<ref name=Platform/>\n\nGay activist Richard Sincere has pointed to the longstanding support of gay rights by the party, which has supported [[same-sex marriage]] since its first platform was drafted in 1972 (40 years before the Democratic Party adopted same-sex marriage into their platform in 2012).

The proposal was incorporated in a new party-wide strategic plan and a joint platform-program committee proposed a reformatted project platform that isolated talking points on issues, principles and solutions as well as an array of projects for adaptation. This platform, along with a short Summary for talking points, was approved in 2004. Confusion arose when prior to the 2006 convention there was a push to repeal or substantially rewrite the Platform, at the center of which were groups such as the Libertarian Reform Caucus.<ref>\"[http://www.reformthelp.org/  Victory in Portland!

With the rise of the [[Women's Movement in the United States (1963-1982)|women's movement in the United States]] during the 1960s, the ERA garnered increasing support, and, after being reintroduced by Representative [[Martha Griffiths]] in 1971, it was approved by the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] on October 12, 1971 and by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] on March 22, 1972, thus submitting the ERA to the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] for ratification, as provided for in [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V of the U.S. Constitution]].\n\nCongress had originally set a ratification deadline of March 22, 1979, for the state legislatures to consider the ERA.

The Court stated: \"We think that, in accordance with this historic precedent, the question of the efficacy of ratifications by state legislatures, in the light of previous rejection or attempted withdrawal, should be regarded as a political question pertaining to the political departments, with the ultimate authority in the Congress in the exercise of its control over the promulgation of the adoption of the amendment.\"<ref>''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13916201793014079286 Coleman v.

In the final week before the revised deadline, that ratifying resolution, however, was defeated in the [[Florida Senate]] by a vote of 16 to 22.

On January 25, 1982, however, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] [[Stay of proceedings|stayed]] the lower court's decision, thus signaling to the legislatures of still-unratified states that they may continue consideration of ERA during their spring 1982 legislative sessions.\n\nAfter the disputed June 30, 1982, extended deadline had come and gone, the Supreme Court, at the beginning of its new term, on October 4, 1982, in the separate case of ''NOW v.

The Court stated: \"We think that, in accordance with this historic precedent, the question of the efficacy of ratifications by state legislatures, in the light of previous rejection or attempted withdrawal, should be regarded as a political question pertaining to the political departments, with the ultimate authority in the Congress in the exercise of its control over the promulgation of the adoption of the amendment.\"<ref>''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13916201793014079286 Coleman v.

Born in [[Chislehurst]], England, he moved to the United States in 1938 and began [[Zen]] training in New York. He received a master's degree in [[theology]] from [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]] and became an [[Episcopalianism|Episcopal]] priest in 1945. He left the ministry in 1950 and moved to [[California]], where he joined the faculty of the [[American Academy of Asian Studies]].\n\nWatts gained a following while working as a volunteer programmer at the [[KPFA]] radio station in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. He wrote more than 25 books and articles on religion and philosophy, introducing the emerging [[Counterculture of the 1960s|hippie counterculture]] to ''[[The Way of Zen]]'' (1957), one of the first bestselling books on Buddhism. In ''Psychotherapy East and West'' (1961), he argued that Buddhism could be thought of as a form of [[psychotherapy]]. He considered ''Nature, Man and Woman'' (1958) to be, \"from a literary point of view\u2014the best book I have ever written.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Watts |first=Alan W. |year=1973 |title=In My Own Way: An Autobiography 1915\u20131965 |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |location=New York |page=280}}</ref> He also explored human consciousness and [[psychedelic]]s in works such as \"The New Alchemy\" (1958) and ''The Joyous Cosmology'' (1962).\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Alan Watts age7.JPG|thumb|upright|Watts aged 7]]\n\nWatts was born to middle-class parents in the village of [[Chislehurst]], [[Kent]] (now south-east London), on 6 January 1915, living at 3 (now 5) Holbrook Lane, which was previously lived in by author [[John Hemming-Clark]] in the early 1900s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.johnhemmingclark.com/media|title=Media}}</ref> Watts' father, Laurence Wilson Watts, was a representative for the London office of the [[Michelin]] tyre company. His mother, Emily Mary Watts (n\u00e9e Buchan), was a housewife whose father had been a [[missionary]]. With modest financial means, they chose to live in pastoral surroundings and Watts, an only child, grew up playing at Brookside, learning the names of wildflowers and butterflies.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, Part 1</ref> Probably because of the influence of his mother's religious family<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong, p. 12.</ref> the Buchans, an interest in \"ultimate things\" seeped in. It mixed with Watts's own interests in storybook fables and romantic tales of the mysterious Far East.<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong, p. 22</ref>\n\nWatts also later wrote of a [[mystical]] dream he experienced while ill with a fever as a child.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 322</ref> During this time he was influenced by Far Eastern landscape paintings and embroideries that had been given to his mother by missionaries returning from China. The few Chinese paintings Watts was able to see in England riveted him, and he wrote \"I was aesthetically fascinated with a certain clarity, transparency, and spaciousness in Chinese and Japanese art. It seemed to float...\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, pp. 71\u201372.</ref> These works of art emphasised the participatory relationship of people in nature, a theme that stood fast throughout his life and one that he often wrote about. (See, for instance, the last chapter in ''[[The Way of Zen]]''.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1957, Part 2, Chapter 4</ref>)\n\n===Buddhism===\n\nBy his own assessment, Watts was imaginative, headstrong, and talkative. He was sent to [[boarding school]]s (which included both academic and religious training of the \"[[Muscular Christianity|Muscular Christian]]\" sort) from early years. Of this religious training, he remarked \"Throughout my schooling my religious indoctrination was grim and maudlin.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 60</ref>\n\nWatts spent several holidays in [[France]] in his teen years, accompanied by Francis Croshaw, a wealthy [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] with strong interests in both [[Buddhism]] and exotic little-known aspects of European culture. It was not long afterward that Watts felt forced to decide between the [[Anglican]] Christianity he had been exposed to and the Buddhism he had read about in various libraries, including Croshaw's. He chose Buddhism, and sought membership in the [[London Buddhist Lodge]], which had been established by [[Theosophism|Theosophists]], and was then run by the barrister [[Christmas Humphreys]]. Watts became the organization's secretary at 16 (1931). The young Watts explored several styles of [[meditation]] during these years.\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===Education===\n\nWatts attended [[The King's School, Canterbury]], next door to [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. Though he was frequently at the top of his classes scholastically and was given responsibilities at school, he botched an opportunity for a [[scholarship]] to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] by styling a crucial examination essay in a way that was read as \"presumptuous and capricious.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 102</ref>\n\nWhen he left secondary school, Watts worked in a printing house and later a bank. He spent his spare time involved with the [[Buddhist Society|Buddhist Lodge]] and also under the tutelage of a \"rascal guru\" named [[Dimitrije Mitrinovi\u0107]]. (Mitrinovi\u0107 was himself influenced by [[P. D. Ouspensky|Peter Demianovich Ouspensky]], [[George Gurdjieff|G. I. Gurdjieff]], and the varied psychoanalytical schools of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]] and [[Alfred Adler|Adler]].) Watts also read widely in philosophy, history, psychology, psychiatry and Eastern wisdom.\n\nBy his own reckoning, and also by that of his biographer [[Monica Furlong]], Watts was primarily an [[autodidact]]. His involvement with the Buddhist Lodge in London afforded Watts a considerable number of opportunities for [[personal growth]]. Through Humphreys, he contacted eminent spiritual authors, e.g. the artist, scholar, and mystic [[Nicholas Roerich]], [[Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan]], and prominent theosophists like [[Alice Bailey]].\n\nIn 1936, aged 21, he attended the World Congress of Faiths at the [[University of London]], heard [[D.&nbsp;T. Suzuki]] read a paper, and afterwards was able to meet this esteemed scholar of [[Zen Buddhism]].<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, pp. 78\u201382</ref> Beyond these discussions and personal encounters, Watts absorbed, by studying the available scholarly literature, the fundamental [[concept]]s and [[terminology]] of the main philosophies of India and [[East Asia]].\n\n===Influences and first publication===\nWatts's fascination with the [[Zen]] (or Ch'an) tradition\u2014beginning during the 1930s\u2014developed because that tradition embodied the spiritual, interwoven with the practical, as exemplified in the subtitle of his ''Spirit of Zen: A Way of Life, Work, and Art in the Far East''. \"Work\", \"life\", and \"art\" were not demoted due to a spiritual focus. In his writing, he referred to it as \"the great Ch'an (or Zen) synthesis of [[Taoism]], Confucianism and Buddhism after AD 700 in China.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1947/1971 ''Behold the Spirit'', revised edition. New York: Random House / Vintage. p. 32</ref> Watts published his first book, ''The Spirit of Zen,'' in 1936. Two decades later, in ''The Way of Zen''<ref>Watts, Alan W., 1957, p.11</ref> he disparaged ''The Spirit of Zen'' as a \"popularisation of Suzuki's earlier works, and besides being very unscholarly it is in many respects out of date and misleading.\"\n\nWatts married Eleanor Everett, whose mother [[Ruth Fuller Sasaki|Ruth Fuller Everett]] was involved with a traditional Zen Buddhist circle in New York. Ruth Fuller later married the Zen master (or \"roshi\"), [[Sokei-an Sasaki]], who served as a sort of model and mentor to Watts, though he chose not to enter into a formal Zen training relationship with Sasaki. During these years, according to his later writings, Watts had another mystical experience while on a walk with his wife. In 1938 they left England to live in the United States. Watts became a United States citizen in 1943.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alan Wilson Watts |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Alan_Watts.aspx |publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography}}</ref>\n\n===Christian priest and afterwards===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2014}}\n\nWatts left formal Zen training in New York because the method of the teacher did not suit him. He was not ordained as a Zen monk, but he felt a need to find a vocational outlet for his philosophical inclinations. He entered [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]], an Episcopal (Anglican) school in Evanston, Illinois, where he studied Christian scriptures, theology, and church history. He attempted to work out a blend of contemporary Christian worship, mystical Christianity, and Asian philosophy. Watts was awarded a master's degree in theology in response to his thesis, which he published as a popular edition under the title ''[[Behold the Spirit: A Study in the Necessity of Mystical Religion]]''.\n\nHe later published ''Myth & Ritual in Christianity'' (1953), an [[eisegesis]] of traditional [[Roman Catholic]] doctrine and ritual in Buddhist terms. However, the pattern was set, in that Watts did not hide his dislike for religious outlooks that he decided were dour, guilt-ridden, or militantly proselytizing\u2014no matter if they were found within [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], or [[Buddhism]].\n\nAs recounted in his autobiography, Alan was [[Holy orders|ordained]] as an [[Episcopal priest]] in 1945 (aged 30) and resigned the ministry by 1950, partly as a result of an extramarital affair which resulted in his wife having their marriage annulled, but also because he could no longer reconcile his Buddhist beliefs with the formal doctrine of the church. He spent the New Year getting to know [[Joseph Campbell]] and Campbell's wife, [[Jean Erdman]], as well as the composer [[John Cage]].\n\nIn early 1951, Watts moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the [[American Academy of Asian Studies]] in [[San Francisco]]. Here he taught from 1951 to 1957 alongside Sabur\u014d Hasegawa (1906\u20131957), [[Frederic Spiegelberg]], [[Haridas Chaudhuri]], [[lama]] Tada T\u014dkan (1890\u20131967), and various visiting experts and professors. Hasegawa, in particular, served as a teacher to Watts in the areas of Japanese customs, arts, primitivism, and perceptions of nature. It was during this time he met the poet, [[Jean Burden]] with whom he had a four-year love affair.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-16/news/ga-6607_1_jean-burden/2|title=She's Well-Versed in the Art of Writing Well : Poetry: Author, editor and teacher Jean Burden shares her lifelong obsession through invitation-only workshops in her home. |last=Hudson |first=Berkley |date=1992-08-16 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2018-01-17}}</ref>\n\nAlan credited her as an \"important influence\" in his life and gave her dedicatory cryptograph in his book \"Nature, Man and Woman\", to which he alludes in his autobiography (p.&nbsp;297). Besides teaching, Watts served for several years as the Academy's administrator. One notable student of his was [[Eugene Rose]], who later went on to become a noted [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] [[hieromonk]] and controversial [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|theologian]] within the Orthodox Church in America under the jurisdiction of [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|ROCOR]]. Rose's own disciple, a fellow monastic priest published under the name Hieromonk Damascene, produced a book entitled ''Christ the Eternal Tao'', in which the author [[comparative religion|draws parallels]] between the concept of the Tao in Chinese philosophy and the concept of the ''[[Logos]]'' in classical Greek philosophy and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] theology.\n\nWatts also studied written Chinese and practiced Chinese brush calligraphy with Hasegawa as well as with some of the Chinese students who enrolled at the academy. While Watts was noted for an interest in [[Zen Buddhism]], his reading and discussions delved into [[Vedanta]], \"[[quantum physics|the new physics]]\", [[cybernetics]], [[semantics]], [[process philosophy]], [[natural history]], and the [[anthropology]] of sexuality.\n\n==Middle years==\nWatts left the faculty for a career in the mid-1950s. In 1953, he began what became a long-running weekly radio program at Pacifica Radio station [[KPFA]] in Berkeley. Like other volunteer programmers at the listener-sponsored station, Watts was not paid for his broadcasts. These weekly broadcasts continued until 1962, by which time he had attracted a \"legion of regular listeners\".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/kpfafolio131paci ''KPFA Folio'', Volume 13, no. 1], 9\u201322 April 1962, p. 14.

These recordings are broadcast to this day.

Besides drawing on the lifestyle and philosophical background of Zen in India and China, Watts introduced ideas drawn from [[general semantics]] (directly from the writings of [[Alfred Korzybski]]) and also from [[Norbert Wiener]]'s early work on [[cybernetics]], which had recently been published. Watts offered analogies from cybernetic principles possibly applicable to the Zen life. The book sold well, eventually becoming a modern classic, and helped widen his lecture circuit.\n\nIn 1958, Watts toured parts of Europe with his father, meeting the Swiss psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]] and the German psychotherapist [[Karlfried Graf D\u00fcrckheim]].<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 321.</ref>\n\nUpon returning to the United States, Watts recorded two seasons of a television series (1959\u20131960) for [[KQED (TV)|KQED]] public television in San Francisco, \"Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life\".<ref>Alan Watts, \"Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life, [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL772D292429735309 Season 1 (1959)\"] and [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA1C3BAC2EB58EE47 Season 2 (1960)], KQED public television series, San Francisco</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Watts became interested in how identifiable patterns in nature tend to repeat themselves from the smallest of scales to the most immense. This became one of his passions in his research and thought.<ref>Ropp, Robert S. de 1995, 2002 ''Warrior's Way: a Twentieth Century Odyssey''.

Watts had begun to experiment with psychedelics, initially with [[mescaline]] given to him by [[Oscar Janiger]]. He tried [[LSD]] several times in 1958, with various research teams led by Keith S. Ditman, Sterling Bunnell Jr., and Michael Agron. He also tried [[marijuana]] and concluded that it was a useful and interesting psychoactive drug that gave the impression of time slowing down. Watts' books of the '60s reveal the influence of these chemical adventures on his outlook.<ref name=\"Joyous 26\">''The Joyous Cosmology: Adventures in the Chemistry of Consciousness'' (the quote is new to the 1965/1970 edition (page 26), and not contained in the original 1962 edition of the book).</ref>\n\nHe later said about psychedelic drug use, \"If you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope, he goes away and works on what he has seen.\"<ref name=\"Joyous 26\"/>\n\nFor a time, Watts came to prefer writing in the language of modern science and psychology (such as ''Psychotherapy East and West''), finding a parallel between mystical experiences and the theories of the material universe proposed by 20th-century physicists. He later equated mystical experience with ecological awareness, and typically emphasized whichever approach seemed best suited to the audience he was addressing.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Applied aesthetics===\n\nWatts sometimes ate with his group of neighbors in [[Druid Heights]] (near [[Mill Valley]], California) who had endeavored to combine architecture, gardening, and carpentry skills to make a beautiful and comfortable life for themselves. These neighbors accomplished this by relying on their own talents and using their own hands, as they lived in what has been called \"shared bohemian poverty\".<ref>^ Davis, Erik (May 2005).

He felt such teaching could improve the world, at least to a degree. He also articulated the possibilities for greater incorporation of [[aesthetics]] (for example: better architecture, more art, more fine cuisine) in American life. In his autobiography he wrote, \"\u2026 cultural renewal comes about when highly differentiated cultures mix\".<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 247.</ref>\n\nIn his last novel, ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'' (1962), Huxley mentions the religious practice of [[maithuna]] as being something like that which [[Roman Catholics]] call \"''[[coitus reservatus]]''\". A few years before, Watts had discussed the theme in his own book, ''Nature, Man and Woman'', in which he discusses the possibility of the practice being known to early Christians and of it being kept secretly by the Church.\n\n==Later years==\n\nIn his writings of the 1950s, he conveyed his admiration for the practicality in the historical achievements of [[Ch\u00e1n]] (Zen) in the Far East, for it had fostered farmers, architects, builders, folk physicians, artists, and administrators among the monks who had lived in the monasteries of its lineages. In his mature work, he presents himself as \"Zennist\" in spirit as he wrote in his last book, ''[[Tao: The Watercourse Way]]''. Child rearing, the arts, cuisine, education, law and freedom, architecture, sexuality, and the uses and abuses of technology were all of great interest to him.\n\nThough known for his discourses on Zen, he was also influenced by ancient Hindu scriptures, especially Vedanta. He spoke extensively about the nature of the divine reality which Man misses: how the contradiction of opposites is the method of life and the means of cosmic and human evolution, how our fundamental Ignorance is rooted in the exclusive nature of mind and ego, how to come in touch with the Field of Consciousness and Light, and other cosmic principles. These are discussed in great detail in dozens of hours of audio that are in part captured in the 'Out of Your Mind' series.\n\nWatts sought to resolve his feelings of alienation from the institutions of marriage and the values of American society, as revealed in his classic comments on love relationships in \"Divine Madness\" and on perception of the organism-environment in \"The Philosophy of Nature\". In looking at social issues he was quite concerned with the necessity for international peace, for tolerance and understanding among disparate cultures.\n\nWatts also came to feel acutely conscious of a growing ecological predicament. Writing, for example, in the early 1960s: \"Can any melting or burning imaginable get rid of these ever-rising mountains of ruin\u2014especially when the things we make and build are beginning to look more and more like rubbish even before they are thrown away?\"<ref>''The Joyous Cosmology'', p. 63</ref> These concerns were later expressed in a television pilot made for [[National Educational Television|NET]] (National Educational Television) filmed at his mountain retreat in 1971 in which he noted that the single track of conscious attention was wholly inadequate for interactions with a multi-tracked world.\n\n==Death==\n\nIn October 1973, Watts returned from a European lecture tour to his cabin in [[Druid Heights]], California. Friends of Watts had been concerned about him for some time over his [[alcoholism]].<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong</ref><ref name=\"Reconsidered\"/><ref name=\"GeniusCharlatan\"/> On 16 November 1973, at age 58, he died in his sleep.

His ashes were split, with half buried near his library at [[Druid Heights]] and half at the Green Gulch Monastery.\n\nA personal account of Watts' last years and approach to death is given by [[Chungliang Al Huang|Al Chung-liang Huang]] in ''[[Tao: The Watercourse Way]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Watts|first1=Alan|editor1-last=Huang|editor1-first=Chungliang Al|editor1-link=Foreword|editor2-link=Once Again: A New Beginning|title=TAO: The Watercourse Way (Foreword)|date=1975|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=0-394-73311-8|pages=vii\u2013xiii|url=https://archive.org/details/taowatercoursewa00watt_0}}</ref> His son Mark Watts has prepared a biographical documentary that details questions surrounding his father's death and performed ritual cremation on a nearby beach.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.alanwatts.com/ |title=Alan Watts Talks & Lectures}}</ref>  His father's ashes were returned to the cabin where he had died.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6wsw8Xpcds&t=4m11s Live Fully Now: Mark Watts], interview at Druid Heights cabin by Volvo Cars (posted to YouTube on Feb 22, 2017)</ref>\n\nSince Watts' death, his lectures have found posthumous popularity on the internet, specifically YouTube.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ozy.com/good-sht/the-dead-philosopher-injecting-spirituality-into-mass-culture-on-youtube/96746 |title=A Dead Philosopher Makes New Connections on YouTube |last=Braswell |first=Sean |date=2019-10-08 |website=www.ozy.com |access-date=2019-10-15}}\n</ref>\n\n==Views==\n\n===On spiritual and social identity===\n\nIn regards to his ethical outlook, Watts felt that [[moral absolutism|absolute morality]] had nothing to do with the fundamental realization of one's deep spiritual identity. He advocated social rather than personal ethics. In his writings, Watts was increasingly concerned with ethics applied to relations between humanity and the natural environment and between governments and citizens. He wrote out of an appreciation of a racially and culturally diverse social landscape.\n\nHe often said that he wished to act as a bridge between the ancient and the modern, between East and West, and between culture and nature.\n\nWatts led some tours for Westerners to the Buddhist temples of Japan. He also studied some movements from the traditional [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese martial]] art [[taijiquan]], with an Asian colleague, [[Chungliang Al Huang|Al Chung-liang Huang]].\n\n===Worldview===\n\nIn several of his later publications, especially ''Beyond Theology'' and ''The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are'', Watts put forward a [[worldview]], drawing on [[Hinduism]], [[Chinese philosophy]], [[pantheism]] or [[panentheism]], and modern science, in which he maintains that the whole universe consists of a cosmic Self playing hide-and-seek ([[Lila (Hinduism)|Lila]]); hiding from itself ([[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]) by becoming all the living and non-living things in the universe and forgetting what it really is \u2013 the upshot being that we are all IT in disguise. In this worldview, Watts asserts that our conception of ourselves as an \"[[ego (spirituality)|ego]] in a bag of skin,\" or \"skin-encapsulated ego\" is a [[myth]]; the entities we call the separate \"things\" are merely aspects or features of the whole.\n\nWatts' books frequently include discussions reflecting his keen interest in patterns that occur in nature and which are repeated in various ways and at a wide range of scales \u2013 including the patterns to be discerned in the history of civilizations.<ref>De Ropp, Robert S. 2002 ''Warrior's Way''. Nevada City, CA: Gateways, p. 334.</ref><ref>Watts, Alan W. 1947/1971, pp. 25\u201328.</ref>\n\n===Supporters and critics===\n\nWatts's explorations and teaching brought him into contact with many noted intellectuals, artists, and American teachers in the [[human potential movement]]. His friendship with poet [[Gary Snyder]] nurtured his sympathies with the budding [[environmental movement]], to which Watts gave philosophical support. He also encountered [[Robert Anton Wilson]], who credited Watts with being one of his \"Light[s] along the Way\" in the opening appreciation of ''[[Cosmic Trigger]]''. [[Werner Erhard]] attended workshops given by Alan Watts and said of him, \"He pointed me toward what I now call the distinction between Self and Mind. After my encounter with Alan, the context in which I was working shifted.\"<ref>William Warren Bartley, Werner Erhard, The Transformation of a Man</ref>\n\nWatts has been criticized by Buddhists such as [[Philip Kapleau]] and [[D. T. Suzuki]] for allegedly misinterpreting several key Zen Buddhist concepts. In particular, he drew criticism from those who believe that [[zazen]] must entail a strict and specific means of sitting, as opposed to a cultivated state of mind available at any moment in any situation. Typical of these is Kapleau's claim that Watts dismissed [[zazen]] on the basis of only half a [[koan]].<ref>Kapleau 1967, pp. 21\u201322</ref>\n\nIn regard to the aforementioned koan, [[Robert Baker Aitken]] reports that Suzuki told him, \"I regret to say that Mr. Watts did not understand that story.\"<ref>[[#refAitken|Aitken 1997]], p. 30. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SS-Dc6ox4hYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22original+dwelling+place%22#PPA29,M1]</ref> In his talks, Watts addressed the issue of defining zazen practice by saying, \"A cat sits until it is tired of sitting, then gets up, stretches, and walks away\", and referring<ref>Alan Watts: ''The truth of the birthless mind'', from ''Out of You Mind'', Session 8, Lecture 8.</ref> to  Zen master [[Bankei]]: \"Even when you're sitting in meditation, if there's something you've got to do, it's quite all right to get up and leave\".<ref>Peter Haskel (ed.): ''Bankei Zen: Translations from The Record of Bankei''. Grove Press, New York 1984. Page 59.</ref> \n\nHowever, Watts did have his supporters in the Zen community, including [[Shunryu Suzuki]], the founder of the [[San Francisco Zen Center]]. As [[David Chadwick (writer)|David Chadwick]] recounted in his biography of Suzuki, ''Crooked Cucumber: the Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki'', when a student of Suzuki's disparaged Watts by saying \"we used to think he was profound until we found the real thing\", Suzuki fumed with a sudden intensity, saying, \"You completely miss the point about Alan Watts! You should notice what he has done. He is a great [[bodhisattva]].\"<ref>Chadwick, D: ''Crooked Cucumber: The Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki'', Broadway Books,2000</ref>\n\nWatts's biographers saw him, after his stint as an Anglican priest, as representative of no religion but as a lone-wolf thinker and social rascal. In David Stuart's warts-and-all biography of the man, Watts is seen as an unusually gifted speaker and writer driven by his own interests, enthusiasms, and demons.<ref>Stuart, David 1976 ''Alan Watts''. Pennsylvania: Chilton.</ref> Elsa Gidlow, whom Alan called \"sister\", refused to be interviewed for this work but later painted a kinder picture of Alan's life in her own autobiography, ''Elsa, I Come With My Songs''. According to critic [[Erik Davis]], his \"writings and recorded talks still shimmer with a profound and galvanizing lucidity.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=David |first=Erik |authorlink=Erik Davis |year=2006 |title=The Visionary State: A Journey through California's Spiritual Landscape |publisher=Chronicle Books |isbn=0-8118-4835-3}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nWatts married three times and had seven children (five daughters and two sons). \nWatts met Eleanor Everett in 1936, when her mother, Ruth Fuller Everett, brought her to London to study piano. They met at the Buddhist Lodge, were engaged the following year and married in April 1938. A daughter, Joan, was born in November 1938 and another, Anne, was born in 1942. Their marriage ended in 1949, but Watts continued to correspond with his former mother-in-law.<ref>Stirling 2006, p. 27</ref>\nIn 1950, Watts married Dorothy DeWitt. He moved to San Francisco in early 1951 to teach. They began a family that grew to include five children: Tia, Mark, Richard, Lila, and Diane. The couple separated in the early 1960s after Watts met Mary Jane Yates King (called \"Jano\" in his circle) while lecturing in New York. After a difficult divorce he married King in 1964. The couple divided their time between [[Sausalito, California]],<ref>''The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are'' (1966)</ref> where they lived on a [[houseboat]] called the ''[[Vallejo (ferry)|Vallejo]]'',<ref>Watts, Alan, 1973, pp. 300\u2013304</ref> and a secluded cabin in [[Druid Heights]], on the southwest flank of [[Mount Tamalpais]] north of San Francisco.\nSome regard Watts as having been an unfaithful husband and a poor father.<ref name=\"GeniusCharlatan\">{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@julesevans/alan-watts-genius-or-charlatan-72313fae997d|title=Alan Watts: genius or charlatan?|last=Evans |first=Jules |date=2019-02-01|website=Medium |access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref><ref name=\"Reconsidered\">{{Cite web |url=https://tricycle.org/magazine/alan-watts-reconsidered/ |title=Alan Watts Reconsidered |last=Guy |first=David |website=Tricycle: The Buddhist Review |access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>\n\nWatts' eldest daughters, Joan and Anne, own and manage most of the copyrights to his books.

Born in [[Chislehurst]], England, he moved to the United States in 1938 and began [[Zen]] training in New York. He received a master's degree in [[theology]] from [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]] and became an [[Episcopalianism|Episcopal]] priest in 1945. He left the ministry in 1950 and moved to [[California]], where he joined the faculty of the [[American Academy of Asian Studies]].\n\nWatts gained a following while working as a volunteer programmer at the [[KPFA]] radio station in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. He wrote more than 25 books and articles on religion and philosophy, introducing the emerging [[Counterculture of the 1960s|hippie counterculture]] to ''[[The Way of Zen]]'' (1957), one of the first bestselling books on Buddhism. In ''Psychotherapy East and West'' (1961), he argued that Buddhism could be thought of as a form of [[psychotherapy]]. He considered ''Nature, Man and Woman'' (1958) to be, \"from a literary point of view\u2014the best book I have ever written.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Watts |first=Alan W. |year=1973 |title=In My Own Way: An Autobiography 1915\u20131965 |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |location=New York |page=280}}</ref> He also explored human consciousness and [[psychedelic]]s in works such as \"The New Alchemy\" (1958) and ''The Joyous Cosmology'' (1962).\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Alan Watts age7.JPG|thumb|upright|Watts aged 7]]\n\nWatts was born to middle-class parents in the village of [[Chislehurst]], [[Kent]] (now south-east London), on 6 January 1915, living at 3 (now 5) Holbrook Lane, which was previously lived in by author [[John Hemming-Clark]] in the early 1900s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.johnhemmingclark.com/media|title=Media}}</ref> Watts' father, Laurence Wilson Watts, was a representative for the London office of the [[Michelin]] tyre company. His mother, Emily Mary Watts (n\u00e9e Buchan), was a housewife whose father had been a [[missionary]]. With modest financial means, they chose to live in pastoral surroundings and Watts, an only child, grew up playing at Brookside, learning the names of wildflowers and butterflies.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, Part 1</ref> Probably because of the influence of his mother's religious family<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong, p. 12.</ref> the Buchans, an interest in \"ultimate things\" seeped in. It mixed with Watts's own interests in storybook fables and romantic tales of the mysterious Far East.<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong, p. 22</ref>\n\nWatts also later wrote of a [[mystical]] dream he experienced while ill with a fever as a child.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 322</ref> During this time he was influenced by Far Eastern landscape paintings and embroideries that had been given to his mother by missionaries returning from China. The few Chinese paintings Watts was able to see in England riveted him, and he wrote \"I was aesthetically fascinated with a certain clarity, transparency, and spaciousness in Chinese and Japanese art. It seemed to float...\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, pp. 71\u201372.</ref> These works of art emphasised the participatory relationship of people in nature, a theme that stood fast throughout his life and one that he often wrote about. (See, for instance, the last chapter in ''[[The Way of Zen]]''.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1957, Part 2, Chapter 4</ref>)\n\n===Buddhism===\n\nBy his own assessment, Watts was imaginative, headstrong, and talkative. He was sent to [[boarding school]]s (which included both academic and religious training of the \"[[Muscular Christianity|Muscular Christian]]\" sort) from early years. Of this religious training, he remarked \"Throughout my schooling my religious indoctrination was grim and maudlin.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 60</ref>\n\nWatts spent several holidays in [[France]] in his teen years, accompanied by Francis Croshaw, a wealthy [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] with strong interests in both [[Buddhism]] and exotic little-known aspects of European culture. It was not long afterward that Watts felt forced to decide between the [[Anglican]] Christianity he had been exposed to and the Buddhism he had read about in various libraries, including Croshaw's. He chose Buddhism, and sought membership in the [[London Buddhist Lodge]], which had been established by [[Theosophism|Theosophists]], and was then run by the barrister [[Christmas Humphreys]]. Watts became the organization's secretary at 16 (1931). The young Watts explored several styles of [[meditation]] during these years.\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===Education===\n\nWatts attended [[The King's School, Canterbury]], next door to [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. Though he was frequently at the top of his classes scholastically and was given responsibilities at school, he botched an opportunity for a [[scholarship]] to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] by styling a crucial examination essay in a way that was read as \"presumptuous and capricious.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 102</ref>\n\nWhen he left secondary school, Watts worked in a printing house and later a bank. He spent his spare time involved with the [[Buddhist Society|Buddhist Lodge]] and also under the tutelage of a \"rascal guru\" named [[Dimitrije Mitrinovi\u0107]]. (Mitrinovi\u0107 was himself influenced by [[P. D. Ouspensky|Peter Demianovich Ouspensky]], [[George Gurdjieff|G. I. Gurdjieff]], and the varied psychoanalytical schools of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]] and [[Alfred Adler|Adler]].) Watts also read widely in philosophy, history, psychology, psychiatry and Eastern wisdom.\n\nBy his own reckoning, and also by that of his biographer [[Monica Furlong]], Watts was primarily an [[autodidact]]. His involvement with the Buddhist Lodge in London afforded Watts a considerable number of opportunities for [[personal growth]]. Through Humphreys, he contacted eminent spiritual authors, e.g. the artist, scholar, and mystic [[Nicholas Roerich]], [[Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan]], and prominent theosophists like [[Alice Bailey]].\n\nIn 1936, aged 21, he attended the World Congress of Faiths at the [[University of London]], heard [[D.&nbsp;T. Suzuki]] read a paper, and afterwards was able to meet this esteemed scholar of [[Zen Buddhism]].<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, pp. 78\u201382</ref> Beyond these discussions and personal encounters, Watts absorbed, by studying the available scholarly literature, the fundamental [[concept]]s and [[terminology]] of the main philosophies of India and [[East Asia]].\n\n===Influences and first publication===\nWatts's fascination with the [[Zen]] (or Ch'an) tradition\u2014beginning during the 1930s\u2014developed because that tradition embodied the spiritual, interwoven with the practical, as exemplified in the subtitle of his ''Spirit of Zen: A Way of Life, Work, and Art in the Far East''. \"Work\", \"life\", and \"art\" were not demoted due to a spiritual focus. In his writing, he referred to it as \"the great Ch'an (or Zen) synthesis of [[Taoism]], Confucianism and Buddhism after AD 700 in China.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1947/1971 ''Behold the Spirit'', revised edition. New York: Random House / Vintage. p. 32</ref> Watts published his first book, ''The Spirit of Zen,'' in 1936. Two decades later, in ''The Way of Zen''<ref>Watts, Alan W., 1957, p.11</ref> he disparaged ''The Spirit of Zen'' as a \"popularisation of Suzuki's earlier works, and besides being very unscholarly it is in many respects out of date and misleading.\"\n\nWatts married Eleanor Everett, whose mother [[Ruth Fuller Sasaki|Ruth Fuller Everett]] was involved with a traditional Zen Buddhist circle in New York. Ruth Fuller later married the Zen master (or \"roshi\"), [[Sokei-an Sasaki]], who served as a sort of model and mentor to Watts, though he chose not to enter into a formal Zen training relationship with Sasaki. During these years, according to his later writings, Watts had another mystical experience while on a walk with his wife. In 1938 they left England to live in the United States. Watts became a United States citizen in 1943.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alan Wilson Watts |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Alan_Watts.aspx |publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography}}</ref>\n\n===Christian priest and afterwards===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2014}}\n\nWatts left formal Zen training in New York because the method of the teacher did not suit him. He was not ordained as a Zen monk, but he felt a need to find a vocational outlet for his philosophical inclinations. He entered [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]], an Episcopal (Anglican) school in Evanston, Illinois, where he studied Christian scriptures, theology, and church history. He attempted to work out a blend of contemporary Christian worship, mystical Christianity, and Asian philosophy. Watts was awarded a master's degree in theology in response to his thesis, which he published as a popular edition under the title ''[[Behold the Spirit: A Study in the Necessity of Mystical Religion]]''.\n\nHe later published ''Myth & Ritual in Christianity'' (1953), an [[eisegesis]] of traditional [[Roman Catholic]] doctrine and ritual in Buddhist terms. However, the pattern was set, in that Watts did not hide his dislike for religious outlooks that he decided were dour, guilt-ridden, or militantly proselytizing\u2014no matter if they were found within [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], or [[Buddhism]].\n\nAs recounted in his autobiography, Alan was [[Holy orders|ordained]] as an [[Episcopal priest]] in 1945 (aged 30) and resigned the ministry by 1950, partly as a result of an extramarital affair which resulted in his wife having their marriage annulled, but also because he could no longer reconcile his Buddhist beliefs with the formal doctrine of the church. He spent the New Year getting to know [[Joseph Campbell]] and Campbell's wife, [[Jean Erdman]], as well as the composer [[John Cage]].\n\nIn early 1951, Watts moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the [[American Academy of Asian Studies]] in [[San Francisco]]. Here he taught from 1951 to 1957 alongside Sabur\u014d Hasegawa (1906\u20131957), [[Frederic Spiegelberg]], [[Haridas Chaudhuri]], [[lama]] Tada T\u014dkan (1890\u20131967), and various visiting experts and professors. Hasegawa, in particular, served as a teacher to Watts in the areas of Japanese customs, arts, primitivism, and perceptions of nature. It was during this time he met the poet, [[Jean Burden]] with whom he had a four-year love affair.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-16/news/ga-6607_1_jean-burden/2|title=She's Well-Versed in the Art of Writing Well : Poetry: Author, editor and teacher Jean Burden shares her lifelong obsession through invitation-only workshops in her home. |last=Hudson |first=Berkley |date=1992-08-16 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2018-01-17}}</ref>\n\nAlan credited her as an \"important influence\" in his life and gave her dedicatory cryptograph in his book \"Nature, Man and Woman\", to which he alludes in his autobiography (p.&nbsp;297). Besides teaching, Watts served for several years as the Academy's administrator. One notable student of his was [[Eugene Rose]], who later went on to become a noted [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] [[hieromonk]] and controversial [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|theologian]] within the Orthodox Church in America under the jurisdiction of [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|ROCOR]]. Rose's own disciple, a fellow monastic priest published under the name Hieromonk Damascene, produced a book entitled ''Christ the Eternal Tao'', in which the author [[comparative religion|draws parallels]] between the concept of the Tao in Chinese philosophy and the concept of the ''[[Logos]]'' in classical Greek philosophy and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] theology.\n\nWatts also studied written Chinese and practiced Chinese brush calligraphy with Hasegawa as well as with some of the Chinese students who enrolled at the academy. While Watts was noted for an interest in [[Zen Buddhism]], his reading and discussions delved into [[Vedanta]], \"[[quantum physics|the new physics]]\", [[cybernetics]], [[semantics]], [[process philosophy]], [[natural history]], and the [[anthropology]] of sexuality.\n\n==Middle years==\nWatts left the faculty for a career in the mid-1950s. In 1953, he began what became a long-running weekly radio program at Pacifica Radio station [[KPFA]] in Berkeley. Like other volunteer programmers at the listener-sponsored station, Watts was not paid for his broadcasts. These weekly broadcasts continued until 1962, by which time he had attracted a \"legion of regular listeners\".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/kpfafolio131paci ''KPFA Folio'', Volume 13, no. 1], 9\u201322 April 1962, p. 14.

These recordings are broadcast to this day. For example, in 1970 Watts lectures were broadcast on Sunday mornings on San Francisco radio station KSAN;<ref>Susan Krieger, ''Hip Capitalism'', 1979, Sage Publications, Beverly Hills, {{ISBN|0-8039-1263-3}} pbk., p. 170.</ref> and even today a number of radio stations continue to have an Alan Watts program in their weekly program schedules.<ref>[http://kkup.org/sched/weekly.html KKUP Program Schedule] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510063805/http://www.kkup.org/sched/weekly.html |date=10 May 2016 }}.

Retrieved on 26 November 2014.</ref> Original tapes of his broadcasts and talks are currently held by the Pacifica Radio Archives, based at [[KPFK]] in Los Angeles, and at the Electronic University archive founded by his son, Mark Watts.\n\nIn 1957 Watts, then 42, published one of his best known books, ''The Way of Zen'', which focused on philosophical explication and history. Besides drawing on the lifestyle and philosophical background of Zen in India and China, Watts introduced ideas drawn from [[general semantics]] (directly from the writings of [[Alfred Korzybski]]) and also from [[Norbert Wiener]]'s early work on [[cybernetics]], which had recently been published. Watts offered analogies from cybernetic principles possibly applicable to the Zen life. The book sold well, eventually becoming a modern classic, and helped widen his lecture circuit.\n\nIn 1958, Watts toured parts of Europe with his father, meeting the Swiss psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]] and the German psychotherapist [[Karlfried Graf D\u00fcrckheim]].<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 321.</ref>\n\nUpon returning to the United States, Watts recorded two seasons of a television series (1959\u20131960) for [[KQED (TV)|KQED]] public television in San Francisco, \"Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life\".<ref>Alan Watts, \"Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life, [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL772D292429735309 Season 1 (1959)\"] and [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA1C3BAC2EB58EE47 Season 2 (1960)], KQED public television series, San Francisco</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Watts became interested in how identifiable patterns in nature tend to repeat themselves from the smallest of scales to the most immense. This became one of his passions in his research and thought.<ref>Ropp, Robert S. de 1995, 2002 ''Warrior's Way: a Twentieth Century Odyssey''. Nevada City, CA: Gateways, pp. 333\u2013334.</ref>\n\nThough never affiliated for long with any one academic institution, he was Professor of Comparative Philosophy at the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]] (as mentioned above), had a fellowship at [[Harvard University]] (1962\u20131964), and was a Scholar at [[San Jose State University]] (1968).<ref>{{cite web|title=Alan Watts - Life and Works|url=http://alanwatts.com/life-and-works/|access-date=25 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802050948/http://alanwatts.com/life-and-works/|archive-date=2 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> He also lectured college and university students as well as the general public.<ref>{{cite web|title=Deoxy Org: Alan Watts|url=http://deoxy.org/watts.htm|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819233823/http://deoxy.org/watts.htm|archivedate=19 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> His lectures and books gave him influence on the American intelligentsia of the 1950s\u20131970s, but he was often seen as an outsider in academia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Weidenbaum|first1=Jonathan|title=Complaining about Alan Watts|url=https://berkeleycollege.academia.edu/JonathanWeidenbaum/Posts/353447/Complaining-about-Alan-Watts|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140803085526/http://berkeleycollege.academia.edu/JonathanWeidenbaum/Posts/353447/Complaining-about-Alan-Watts|url-status = dead|archive-date=2014-08-03}}</ref> When questioned sharply by students during his talk at [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], in 1970, Watts responded, as he had from the early sixties, that he was not an academic philosopher but rather \"a philosophical entertainer\".<ref name=\"NR\" />\n\n===Experimentation===\n\nSome of Watts' writings published in 1958 (e.g., his book ''Nature, Man and Woman'' and his essay \"The New Alchemy\") mentioned some of his early views on the use of psychedelic drugs for mystical insight. Watts had begun to experiment with psychedelics, initially with [[mescaline]] given to him by [[Oscar Janiger]]. He tried [[LSD]] several times in 1958, with various research teams led by Keith S. Ditman, Sterling Bunnell Jr., and Michael Agron. He also tried [[marijuana]] and concluded that it was a useful and interesting psychoactive drug that gave the impression of time slowing down. Watts' books of the '60s reveal the influence of these chemical adventures on his outlook.<ref name=\"Joyous 26\">''The Joyous Cosmology: Adventures in the Chemistry of Consciousness'' (the quote is new to the 1965/1970 edition (page 26), and not contained in the original 1962 edition of the book).</ref>\n\nHe later said about psychedelic drug use, \"If you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope, he goes away and works on what he has seen.\"<ref name=\"Joyous 26\"/>\n\nFor a time, Watts came to prefer writing in the language of modern science and psychology (such as ''Psychotherapy East and West''), finding a parallel between mystical experiences and the theories of the material universe proposed by 20th-century physicists. He later equated mystical experience with ecological awareness, and typically emphasized whichever approach seemed best suited to the audience he was addressing.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Applied aesthetics===\n\nWatts sometimes ate with his group of neighbors in [[Druid Heights]] (near [[Mill Valley]], California) who had endeavored to combine architecture, gardening, and carpentry skills to make a beautiful and comfortable life for themselves. These neighbors accomplished this by relying on their own talents and using their own hands, as they lived in what has been called \"shared bohemian poverty\".<ref>^ Davis, Erik (May 2005).

He felt such teaching could improve the world, at least to a degree. He also articulated the possibilities for greater incorporation of [[aesthetics]] (for example: better architecture, more art, more fine cuisine) in American life. In his autobiography he wrote, \"\u2026 cultural renewal comes about when highly differentiated cultures mix\".<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 247.</ref>\n\nIn his last novel, ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'' (1962), Huxley mentions the religious practice of [[maithuna]] as being something like that which [[Roman Catholics]] call \"''[[coitus reservatus]]''\". A few years before, Watts had discussed the theme in his own book, ''Nature, Man and Woman'', in which he discusses the possibility of the practice being known to early Christians and of it being kept secretly by the Church.\n\n==Later years==\n\nIn his writings of the 1950s, he conveyed his admiration for the practicality in the historical achievements of [[Ch\u00e1n]] (Zen) in the Far East, for it had fostered farmers, architects, builders, folk physicians, artists, and administrators among the monks who had lived in the monasteries of its lineages. In his mature work, he presents himself as \"Zennist\" in spirit as he wrote in his last book, ''[[Tao: The Watercourse Way]]''. Child rearing, the arts, cuisine, education, law and freedom, architecture, sexuality, and the uses and abuses of technology were all of great interest to him.\n\nThough known for his discourses on Zen, he was also influenced by ancient Hindu scriptures, especially Vedanta. He spoke extensively about the nature of the divine reality which Man misses: how the contradiction of opposites is the method of life and the means of cosmic and human evolution, how our fundamental Ignorance is rooted in the exclusive nature of mind and ego, how to come in touch with the Field of Consciousness and Light, and other cosmic principles. These are discussed in great detail in dozens of hours of audio that are in part captured in the 'Out of Your Mind' series.\n\nWatts sought to resolve his feelings of alienation from the institutions of marriage and the values of American society, as revealed in his classic comments on love relationships in \"Divine Madness\" and on perception of the organism-environment in \"The Philosophy of Nature\". In looking at social issues he was quite concerned with the necessity for international peace, for tolerance and understanding among disparate cultures.\n\nWatts also came to feel acutely conscious of a growing ecological predicament. Writing, for example, in the early 1960s: \"Can any melting or burning imaginable get rid of these ever-rising mountains of ruin\u2014especially when the things we make and build are beginning to look more and more like rubbish even before they are thrown away?\"<ref>''The Joyous Cosmology'', p. 63</ref> These concerns were later expressed in a television pilot made for [[National Educational Television|NET]] (National Educational Television) filmed at his mountain retreat in 1971 in which he noted that the single track of conscious attention was wholly inadequate for interactions with a multi-tracked world.\n\n==Death==\n\nIn October 1973, Watts returned from a European lecture tour to his cabin in [[Druid Heights]], California. Friends of Watts had been concerned about him for some time over his [[alcoholism]].<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong</ref><ref name=\"Reconsidered\"/><ref name=\"GeniusCharlatan\"/> On 16 November 1973, at age 58, he died in his sleep.

His ashes were split, with half buried near his library at [[Druid Heights]] and half at the Green Gulch Monastery.\n\nA personal account of Watts' last years and approach to death is given by [[Chungliang Al Huang|Al Chung-liang Huang]] in ''[[Tao: The Watercourse Way]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Watts|first1=Alan|editor1-last=Huang|editor1-first=Chungliang Al|editor1-link=Foreword|editor2-link=Once Again: A New Beginning|title=TAO: The Watercourse Way (Foreword)|date=1975|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=0-394-73311-8|pages=vii\u2013xiii|url=https://archive.org/details/taowatercoursewa00watt_0}}</ref> His son Mark Watts has prepared a biographical documentary that details questions surrounding his father's death and performed ritual cremation on a nearby beach.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.alanwatts.com/ |title=Alan Watts Talks & Lectures}}</ref>  His father's ashes were returned to the cabin where he had died.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6wsw8Xpcds&t=4m11s Live Fully Now: Mark Watts], interview at Druid Heights cabin by Volvo Cars (posted to YouTube on Feb 22, 2017)</ref>\n\nSince Watts' death, his lectures have found posthumous popularity on the internet, specifically YouTube.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ozy.com/good-sht/the-dead-philosopher-injecting-spirituality-into-mass-culture-on-youtube/96746 |title=A Dead Philosopher Makes New Connections on YouTube |last=Braswell |first=Sean |date=2019-10-08 |website=www.ozy.com |access-date=2019-10-15}}\n</ref>\n\n==Views==\n\n===On spiritual and social identity===\n\nIn regards to his ethical outlook, Watts felt that [[moral absolutism|absolute morality]] had nothing to do with the fundamental realization of one's deep spiritual identity. He advocated social rather than personal ethics. In his writings, Watts was increasingly concerned with ethics applied to relations between humanity and the natural environment and between governments and citizens. He wrote out of an appreciation of a racially and culturally diverse social landscape.\n\nHe often said that he wished to act as a bridge between the ancient and the modern, between East and West, and between culture and nature.\n\nWatts led some tours for Westerners to the Buddhist temples of Japan. He also studied some movements from the traditional [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese martial]] art [[taijiquan]], with an Asian colleague, [[Chungliang Al Huang|Al Chung-liang Huang]].\n\n===Worldview===\n\nIn several of his later publications, especially ''Beyond Theology'' and ''The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are'', Watts put forward a [[worldview]], drawing on [[Hinduism]], [[Chinese philosophy]], [[pantheism]] or [[panentheism]], and modern science, in which he maintains that the whole universe consists of a cosmic Self playing hide-and-seek ([[Lila (Hinduism)|Lila]]); hiding from itself ([[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]) by becoming all the living and non-living things in the universe and forgetting what it really is \u2013 the upshot being that we are all IT in disguise. In this worldview, Watts asserts that our conception of ourselves as an \"[[ego (spirituality)|ego]] in a bag of skin,\" or \"skin-encapsulated ego\" is a [[myth]]; the entities we call the separate \"things\" are merely aspects or features of the whole.\n\nWatts' books frequently include discussions reflecting his keen interest in patterns that occur in nature and which are repeated in various ways and at a wide range of scales \u2013 including the patterns to be discerned in the history of civilizations.<ref>De Ropp, Robert S. 2002 ''Warrior's Way''. Nevada City, CA: Gateways, p. 334.</ref><ref>Watts, Alan W. 1947/1971, pp. 25\u201328.</ref>\n\n===Supporters and critics===\n\nWatts's explorations and teaching brought him into contact with many noted intellectuals, artists, and American teachers in the [[human potential movement]]. His friendship with poet [[Gary Snyder]] nurtured his sympathies with the budding [[environmental movement]], to which Watts gave philosophical support. He also encountered [[Robert Anton Wilson]], who credited Watts with being one of his \"Light[s] along the Way\" in the opening appreciation of ''[[Cosmic Trigger]]''. [[Werner Erhard]] attended workshops given by Alan Watts and said of him, \"He pointed me toward what I now call the distinction between Self and Mind. After my encounter with Alan, the context in which I was working shifted.\"<ref>William Warren Bartley, Werner Erhard, The Transformation of a Man</ref>\n\nWatts has been criticized by Buddhists such as [[Philip Kapleau]] and [[D. T. Suzuki]] for allegedly misinterpreting several key Zen Buddhist concepts. In particular, he drew criticism from those who believe that [[zazen]] must entail a strict and specific means of sitting, as opposed to a cultivated state of mind available at any moment in any situation. Typical of these is Kapleau's claim that Watts dismissed [[zazen]] on the basis of only half a [[koan]].<ref>Kapleau 1967, pp. 21\u201322</ref>\n\nIn regard to the aforementioned koan, [[Robert Baker Aitken]] reports that Suzuki told him, \"I regret to say that Mr. Watts did not understand that story.\"<ref>[[#refAitken|Aitken 1997]], p. 30. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SS-Dc6ox4hYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22original+dwelling+place%22#PPA29,M1]</ref> In his talks, Watts addressed the issue of defining zazen practice by saying, \"A cat sits until it is tired of sitting, then gets up, stretches, and walks away\", and referring<ref>Alan Watts: ''The truth of the birthless mind'', from ''Out of You Mind'', Session 8, Lecture 8.</ref> to  Zen master [[Bankei]]: \"Even when you're sitting in meditation, if there's something you've got to do, it's quite all right to get up and leave\".<ref>Peter Haskel (ed.): ''Bankei Zen: Translations from The Record of Bankei''. Grove Press, New York 1984. Page 59.</ref> \n\nHowever, Watts did have his supporters in the Zen community, including [[Shunryu Suzuki]], the founder of the [[San Francisco Zen Center]]. As [[David Chadwick (writer)|David Chadwick]] recounted in his biography of Suzuki, ''Crooked Cucumber: the Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki'', when a student of Suzuki's disparaged Watts by saying \"we used to think he was profound until we found the real thing\", Suzuki fumed with a sudden intensity, saying, \"You completely miss the point about Alan Watts! You should notice what he has done. He is a great [[bodhisattva]].\"<ref>Chadwick, D: ''Crooked Cucumber: The Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki'', Broadway Books,2000</ref>\n\nWatts's biographers saw him, after his stint as an Anglican priest, as representative of no religion but as a lone-wolf thinker and social rascal. In David Stuart's warts-and-all biography of the man, Watts is seen as an unusually gifted speaker and writer driven by his own interests, enthusiasms, and demons.<ref>Stuart, David 1976 ''Alan Watts''. Pennsylvania: Chilton.</ref> Elsa Gidlow, whom Alan called \"sister\", refused to be interviewed for this work but later painted a kinder picture of Alan's life in her own autobiography, ''Elsa, I Come With My Songs''. According to critic [[Erik Davis]], his \"writings and recorded talks still shimmer with a profound and galvanizing lucidity.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=David |first=Erik |authorlink=Erik Davis |year=2006 |title=The Visionary State: A Journey through California's Spiritual Landscape |publisher=Chronicle Books |isbn=0-8118-4835-3}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nWatts married three times and had seven children (five daughters and two sons). \nWatts met Eleanor Everett in 1936, when her mother, Ruth Fuller Everett, brought her to London to study piano. They met at the Buddhist Lodge, were engaged the following year and married in April 1938. A daughter, Joan, was born in November 1938 and another, Anne, was born in 1942. Their marriage ended in 1949, but Watts continued to correspond with his former mother-in-law.<ref>Stirling 2006, p. 27</ref>\nIn 1950, Watts married Dorothy DeWitt. He moved to San Francisco in early 1951 to teach. They began a family that grew to include five children: Tia, Mark, Richard, Lila, and Diane. The couple separated in the early 1960s after Watts met Mary Jane Yates King (called \"Jano\" in his circle) while lecturing in New York. After a difficult divorce he married King in 1964. The couple divided their time between [[Sausalito, California]],<ref>''The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are'' (1966)</ref> where they lived on a [[houseboat]] called the ''[[Vallejo (ferry)|Vallejo]]'',<ref>Watts, Alan, 1973, pp. 300\u2013304</ref> and a secluded cabin in [[Druid Heights]], on the southwest flank of [[Mount Tamalpais]] north of San Francisco.\nSome regard Watts as having been an unfaithful husband and a poor father.<ref name=\"GeniusCharlatan\">{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@julesevans/alan-watts-genius-or-charlatan-72313fae997d|title=Alan Watts: genius or charlatan?|last=Evans |first=Jules |date=2019-02-01|website=Medium |access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref><ref name=\"Reconsidered\">{{Cite web |url=https://tricycle.org/magazine/alan-watts-reconsidered/ |title=Alan Watts Reconsidered |last=Guy |first=David |website=Tricycle: The Buddhist Review |access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>\n\nWatts' eldest daughters, Joan and Anne, own and manage most of the copyrights to his books.

highly affected by the Crimea Crisis as majority of their units were stationed there. Ships that did not escape or were not deployed at the time lowered their flags and were interned. Russia began a process of returning the vessels but stopped, citing inability of Ukraine to retake possession and continued violence against Russians in the Donbass. The ships that were returned were the older models of the fleet that were deemed obsolete. For example, Russia chose not to return the [[corvette]]s {{ship|Ukrainian corvette|Ternopil|U209|2}} and {{ship|Ukrainian corvette|Lutsk|U205|2}}, both of which are some of the newest ships of the Ukrainian fleet.

Cossacks used small ships called \"chaikas\" which were similar in design to Viking long ships. Although technologically inferior to the Turks the Cossacks had great success against their opponent. In 1614 the Cossack forces were able to raid, and destroy [[Trabzon]]. In 1615 the Cossacks were able to mount a raid on [[Istanbul]] itself, destroying several suburbs of the city. In 1616 a Cossack fleet was able to reach the [[Bosphorus]], once again raiding the surrounding countryside. A Turkish fleet sent to destroy the Cossack forces was defeated in 1617. The Cossacks once again managed to mount an attack on Istanbul in 1625, forcing the [[Sultan]] to temporarily flee the capital. The Cossacks used several strategies to attack the larger Ottoman forces, such as positioning their ships during battle in a way that sun was always at their back. The Cossack ships were small with a low profile, making them hard to hit by cannon. Cossacks were typically armed with small arm muskets, and during battle had the goal of killing the crew and boarding the ship to take it over, rather than sinking the ship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/unavy/aCossack1.html |publisher=Web Cite |title=Cossack Navy 16th \u2013 17th Centuries |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5knsYNTNL?url=http://www.geocities.com/unavy/aCossack1.html |archivedate=October 26, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==NAVY period==\n\n===Ukrainian People's Republic NAVY 1917\u20131921===\n\n{{see also|Navy of the Ukrainian People's Republic}}\n[[File:\u041c\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0424\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0430.jpg|thumb|\u041c\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0424\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0430, 1918 \u0433\u043e\u0434.|305px|left|Medal of Ukrainian fleet of April 29, 1918.]]\n[[File:\u0414\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446.PNG|thumb|right|305px|Gunboat \"Donets\" of Ukrainian Naval Forces, July\u2013November 1918]]\n[[File:\u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u044f\u0445 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0446\u044b \u0423\u041d\u0420, 1920 \u0433.jpg|thumb|right|305px|Ukrainian marines in 1921]]\n[[File:Sevastopol1918e.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ukrainian warships in the port of [[Sevastopol]], 1918]]\nDuring [[1917 Russian Revolution]], several ships of the Russian Imperial Navy's [[Black Sea Fleet]], commanded and crewed by ethnic Ukrainians, declared themselves the Navy of the newly autonomous [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. Black Sea Fleet commander [[Mikhail Sablin]] raised the colours of the Ukrainian National Republic on 29 April 1918.<ref>[http://ukrainianweek.com/History/22688 Operation Fleet For Ukraine], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (16 May 2011)</ref><ref>{{in lang|ru}} [https://ru.krymr.com/a/interactive-map/29189950.html Crimean campaign of Peter Bolbochan in 1918], [[Radio Free Europe]] (April 2018)</ref> However, few further steps on establishing a navy were made as the Ukrainian government lost control over coastal territories.\n\nAfter the Revolution 1917, a time of anarchy and demoralization overtook the former Russian Black Sea Fleet. The Fleet, stationed in [[Sevastopol]], was commanded by a collective, \"Tsentroflot\". Different political influences clashed: Ukrainian, [[Bolshevik]], [[Menshevik]], [[Social Revolutionaries]] and [[Anarchist]]. Very different flags were hoisted over ships: Ukrainian bicolors, old Russian ensigns, Bolshevist red flags and Anarchist black flags.<ref>[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ua~1918.html Ukraine \u2013 Historical Naval Flags (1918)], accessed October 2009</ref> They were hoisted and lowered even several times daily, according to changes of each crew's political orientation. The Ukrainian People's Republic aspired to take control of the Fleet. On 22 December 1917 the Naval Ministry in Kiev was established.\n\nStarting October 1917 the crews of the ships established military councils; the [[Flag of Ukraine|blue-yellow flags]] were flying from the masts. The ships Zavidniy (Enviable) and [[Russian cruiser Pamiat Merkuria (1907)]] were the first examples. The General Secretariat for Naval Affairs was established within the government of the [[Central Rada]] in [[Kiev]] (in January 1918 it was reformed in a Ministry). The head of it became D. Antonovich. The Main Navy Staff was led by Captain [[Jerzy \u015awirski]]. For the educational and agitational purposes of the seamen the Central Rada seconded the commissars to [[Odessa]], [[Mykolaiv]], [[Kherson]] and Sevastopol. November 22, 1917 the whole crew of the newest and most powerful warship of the Black Sea Fleet ''Volya'' swore fealty to the Central Rada, followed soon by several ships and submarines. On 29 April 1918, Rear-admiral M. Sablin was appointed commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Navy. A telegram to Kiev was sent from the staff ship ''Georgiy Pobedonosets'' \u201cEffective today the Sevastopol fortress and the Fleet in Sevastopol raised the Ukrainian flag. Admiral Sablin assumed the command of the Fleet\u201d. Having no reply the admiral ordered to repeat the telegram beginning with the words \u201cComrades of Kiev Central Rada...\u201d. But Sablin was unaware that at that moment the Central Rada in Kiev was already history.\n\nUkraine had a navy for five months. From October 1917 till March 1918 the following came to be at the disposal of the Ukrainians: nine [[battleships]], seven [[cruisers]], 18 [[destroyers]], 14 [[submarines]], 16 [[patrol ships]] and avisos, 11 military transports and mother ships. Additionally, the Fleet\u2019s Headquarters, all military institutions and plants, all coastal fortifications were in hands of the Ukrainians. But they were yet to face a disaster.\n\nThe Kaiser\u2019s forces had been advancing on Sevastopol with a goal to capture the Black Sea Fleet. Having no support from the land forces, Admiral Sablin was forced enter negotiations regarding cessation of hostilities. The [[History of Germany during World War I|Germans]] however rejected the armistice proposals and the advance continued.\n\nIn April 1918 German and Ukrainian troops [[Crimea Operation (1918)|invaded Crimea]]. On 29 April 1918, fleet-commanding Rear-admiral Sablin (Russian) gave an order to hoist Ukrainian national flags over all ships in Sevastopol (the medal to the right commemorates that event). But Germans started to occupy Sevastopol, because the bolsheviks began to lead away ships. Centroflot (the combined fleet revolutionary committee), in order to save the Fleet, took a decision to move it to [[Novorossiysk]]. But on April 30, 1918, only the small part of the fleet under command of Admiral Sablin, which trusted the bolsheviks, headed for Novorossiysk and hoisted Russian St. Andrew (saltire) ensigns. The greater part of the Ukrainian fleet remained in Sevastopol \u2013 there were 30 destroyers and torpedo boats, 25 auxiliaries, 7 battleships and small craft as well as 15 submarines left in Sevastopol under Admiral Myhaylo Ostrogradskiy who in this situation assumed command.\n\nOn 1 May 1918 Germans captured the ships remaining in Sevastopol, because the actions of Bolsheviks violated the peace agreement. On 17 June 1918, 1 dreadnought and 6 destroyers returned from Novorossiysk to Sevastopol, where they were also captured. The greater part of the ships remaining in Novorossiysk were destroyed by their own crews on [[Lenin]]'s command. In July\u2013November 1918 Germans gradually transferred many ships to the command of Ukrainian government ([[Hetman]] [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]]). The main Ukrainian sea power concentrated in Odessa and Mykolaiv was more than 20 minesweepers, 7 small cruisers, 1 dreadnought and more than 30 auxiliaries. In Sevastopol there were only 2 old battleships under Ukrainian flags. On 18 July 1918 the Naval Ministry in [[Kiev]] established new naval ensigns and some rank flags (e.g. flag of Naval Minister, flag of Deputy Minister). The old Russian jack remained as Ukrainian naval jack. It was regarded as symbol of glory of Black Sea Fleet, whose crews were in large part previously Ukrainian. On 17 September Germans gives Ukraine 17 U-boats. In December 1918, when naval forces of [[Allies of World War I|the Entente]] were approaching Sevastopol, Ukrainian Rear-admiral V. Klokhkovskyy (\u0412'\u044f\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 \u041a\u043b\u043e\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439) commanded all ships to hoist [[Order of St. Andrew|Russian St. Andrew (saltire) ensigns]]. It was a demonstration of good intentions for the Entente. However, the Entente captured the Black Sea Fleet and subsequently transferred it to the [[White movement|Russian \"White\" forces]]. In Ukrainian hands remained only small in numbers subdivisions of marines. Ukrainian naval authorities existed until 1921.\n\n====List of Ukrainian ships====\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0444\u043b\u0430\u0433 \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u044b 1917.jpg|thumbnail|Blue and yellow flag on cruiser Pamiat Merkuria, Nov 1917]]\nOn October 17, 1917 the 2nd rank Captain Ye.Akimov was appointed the representative of the [[Central Council of Ukraine]] at the command of the [[Black Sea Fleet]].

Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] (1991), the administration of the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] passed to the Joint Armed Forces of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] for a transitional period pending agreement on the division of the ex-Soviet military between members of the [[former Soviet Union]]. [[Marshal of Aviation]] [[Yevgeny Shaposhnikov]] became commander of the Joint CIS Armed Forces command on 14 February 1992.\n\nOn 6 December 1991 the [[Supreme Council of Ukraine]] (Verkhovna Rada) adopted a resolution on the laws of Ukraine \"About the Defense of Ukraine\" and \"About the Armed Forces of Ukraine\", as well as the text of a military oath. On the same day, in the [[parliament of Ukraine]] chamber, the [[Minister of Defense of Ukraine]], [[Kostyantyn Morozov]], became the first person to take the oath. On 10 December 1991 the Supreme Council of Ukraine ratified the [[Belavezha Accords]]. On 12 December 1991 the [[President of Ukraine]] issued [[ukase]] #4, ordering all military formations based in Ukraine to pledge allegiance by 20 January 1992. The vast majority of the Black Sea Fleet ignored the order. On 1 January 1992 the newspaper ''Vympyel'' of the Black Sea Fleet [[Filipp Oktyabrskiy]] Training unit (edited by Captain-Lieutenant Mykola Huk) published the military oath and the anthem of Ukraine in the [[Ukrainian language]].\n\nOn 3 January 1992 Ukraine started the practical formation of its national armed forces. On 8 January 1992 the Officers' Assembly of the Black Sea Fleet appealed to all leaders of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] to recognise the Black Sea Fleet as an operational-strategic formation and not subordinate to Ukraine. On 12 January 1992, the brigade of [[Soviet Border Troops|border troops]] in [[Balaklava]] ([[Sevastopol]]) became the first military formation to pledge allegiance to Ukraine. On 14 January 1992 the Governor of Sevastopol appealed to the Supreme Councils of both Ukraine and the Russian Federation, urging faster adoption of a decision on the status of the Black Sea Fleet. On 16 January 1992, an agreement between the participants of [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] was signed on the oath in strategic formations.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://zakon.nau.ua/doc/?code=997_142 |title=Text of the agreement on oath in the strategic formations |publisher=Zakon.nau.ua |date=1992-01-16 |accessdate=2014-03-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030090703/http://zakon.nau.ua/doc/?code=997_142 |archivedate=October 30, 2014 }} \n</ref>\nOn 18 January 1992, the 3rd company of the divers school became the first formation of the Black Sea Fleet to pledge their allegiance to Ukraine, along with the Maritime Department of the Sevastopol Institute of Instrument Engineering. On the next day, forty-six naval pilots pledged their allegiance to Ukraine at the central square (''Ploshcha Lenina'') of [[Mykolaiv]].\n\nBlack Sea Fleet military personnel previously under the oath of the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] did not hasten to pledge allegiance to the newly formed state. First Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy [[Admiral of the Fleet (Soviet Union)|Fleet Admiral]] [[Ivan Kapitanets]] issued a directive: \"to apply severe sanctions, including dismissal from office and separation from service to officers, midshipmen, and warrant officers who create an unhealthy situation in military communities that are prone to treason and taking the oath of allegiance to Ukraine \". Nonetheless, on 26 January 1992 the 17th Brigade of Ships for the Guarding the Water Area of the Crimea Naval Base followed the example of the divers.<ref name=\"vms-hist\"/> Right before the [[Soviet Army Day|Soviet Army and Navy Day]] (23 February) on 22 February, the 880th Independent Naval Infantry Battalion of Black Sea Fleet pledged allegiance to Ukraine. The battalion had been recognized{{by whom|date=October 2014}} as the best formation of the fleet in 1991. The Main Navy Staff in Moscow issued an order to dissolve the battalion. After the incident, all military units of the [[Black Sea Fleet]] recruited exclusively Russians{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}.\n\nAccording to estimations by the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]], in January of 1992 the Black Sea Fleet accounted for 80,000 servicemen, 69 major warships including 3 aircraft carriers, 6 missile cruisers, 29 submarines, 235 warplanes and helicopters, and great number of ships of auxiliary fleet.<ref name=forum86>[http://diasporiana.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/books/12761/file.pdf What is Black Sea Fleet Worth?]. \"Forum, a Ukrainian review\" at Diasporiana.

In January 1992 the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]] raised the question of the political status of [[Crimea]] ([[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Crimean ASSR]]) and of the constitutionality of the 1954 decision to transfer of [[Crimean Oblast]] of the [[Russian SFSR]] to the [[Ukrainian SSR]], accusing [[Nikita Khrushchev]] of treason against the [[Russian people]]. Although never annulled,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} many Russian parliamentarians refused to recognize the legal document, pointing out the procedural errors during its adoption. The Ukrainian side issued reminders of the number of international treaties and agreements between the two countries, such as the 19 November 1990 treaty between the Russian SFSR and the Ukrainian SSR, in which both sides recognized the territorial integrity of the other, as well as the [[Belavezha Accords]] (an agreement on creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States) of 8 December 1991 and the [[Alma-Ata Protocol]] of 21 December 1991.\n\nNoticing not much reaction from the Black Sea Fleet command located on the territory of Ukraine, on 5 April 1992 the [[President of Ukraine]] issued Decree #209 \"About urgent measures on development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine\", which accused the [[Russian Federation]] and the Joint Armed Forces command of intervening in the internal affairs of Ukraine. On 6 April 1992, a session of the 6th Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian SFSR refused to accept the Belavezha agreement as previously ratified by the Supreme Council of the Russian SFSR (on 12 December 1991).

On 7 April 1992 at 17:00 37 officers of the administration and headquarters of the Crimean Naval Base (an administrative entity and not a physical \"base\") pledged their allegiance and loyalty to people of Ukraine. Rear Admiral Borys Kozhyn, who was in charge, was not present at that time of the event. He was in the office of [[Ivan Yermakov]] accepting a proposition of the First Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine to become the commander of the future Ukrainian Naval Forces. On 8 April 1992 the [[Minister of Defense of Ukraine|Minister of Defense]] signed a directive \"About creation of the Ukrainian Naval Forces\". On 13 April 1992 an organizational group was established on creation of the Ukrainian Naval Forces, which upset the command of the [[Black Sea Fleet]].\n\nThe current history of the Ukrainian Naval Forces began on 1 August 1992, when it was formally established by order of the President of Ukraine [[Leonid Kravchuk]]. This was followed by a long and controversial [[Black Sea Fleet#Partition of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet|partition of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet]] between newly independent Ukraine and the [[Russian Federation]].\n\n[[File:SKR-112-Ukraine.png|thumb|600 px|right|SKR-112 on 20 July 1992]]\nOne of the episodes of this process was the story of ''[[SKR-112]]'' \u2013 effectively the first Ukrainian Navy ship.<ref name=uknavy>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/ukraine/vms.htm |title=Ukrainian Navy |website=globalsecurity.org |date=26 April 2014 |accessdate=14 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160721134518/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/ukraine/vms.htm |archive-date=21 July 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 20 July 1992, the crew of ''SKR-112'' declared itself a Ukrainian ship and raised the [[Flag of Ukraine|Ukrainian flag]]. The Navy headquarters in Moscow considered this a [[mutiny]] and attempted to act accordingly. The ship left its base on the Crimean peninsula bound for [[Odessa]], causing a chase and ramming attempts by ships still loyal to Moscow. Soon several other ships, auxiliary vessels, and coastal units of the Black Sea Fleet followed ''SKR-112''{{'}}s decision but with less violent outcomes.\n\nIt was only in 1997 that the ships and equipment of the Black Sea Fleet were officially divided between the two countries. The new Russian formation retained its historic name \"Black Sea Fleet\". Under the terms of a negotiated lease agreement it was also granted rights to use the majority of its bases on the Crimea Peninsula, Ukraine on a renewable ten-year [[lease]] basis at least until 2017. The newly established Ukrainian Naval Forces received dozens of vessels (mostly obsolete or inoperative, not unlike some of those retained by Russia) and some shore-based infrastructure. However, the Russian Navy lost several important facilities, most notably the ''NITKA'' (Russian acronym for \"Scientific testing simulator for shipborne aviation\") [[naval aviation]] training facility in [[Saky]], and the [[special forces]] base in [[Ochakiv]]. The process of fleet division remained painful since many aspects of the two navies' co-existence were under-regulated, causing recurring conflicts.\n\n[[File:\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e-\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u201c\u0421\u0456 \u0411\u0440\u0438\u0437 - 2016\u201d (28075162974).jpg|right|thumb|The [[Krivak-class frigate|Krivak III-class]] frigate {{ship|Ukrainian frigate|Hetman Sahaydachniy|U130|2}} is the current flagship of the Ukrainian Navy.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.interfax.co.uk/ukraine-news/kozhara-hetman-sahaidachny-frigate-to-join-natos-anti-piracy-operation/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130917123531/http://www.interfax.co.uk/ukraine-news/kozhara-hetman-sahaidachny-frigate-to-join-natos-anti-piracy-operation/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 September 2013 |title=Kozhara: Hetman Sahaidachny frigate to join NATO\u2019s anti-piracy operation |newspaper=[[Interfax-Ukraine]] |date=17 September 2013}}</ref>]]\n\nSince 1997 due to lack of financing and neglect most of the Ukrainian naval units have been scrapped or poorly maintained.

highly affected by the Crimea Crisis as majority of their units were stationed there. Ships that did not escape or were not deployed at the time lowered their flags and were interned. Russia began a process of returning the vessels but stopped, citing inability of Ukraine to retake possession and continued violence against Russians in the Donbass. The ships that were returned were the older models of the fleet that were deemed obsolete. For example, Russia chose not to return the [[corvette]]s {{ship|Ukrainian corvette|Ternopil|U209|2}} and {{ship|Ukrainian corvette|Lutsk|U205|2}}, both of which are some of the newest ships of the Ukrainian fleet.

Cossacks used small ships called \"chaikas\" which were similar in design to Viking long ships. Although technologically inferior to the Turks the Cossacks had great success against their opponent. In 1614 the Cossack forces were able to raid, and destroy [[Trabzon]]. In 1615 the Cossacks were able to mount a raid on [[Istanbul]] itself, destroying several suburbs of the city. In 1616 a Cossack fleet was able to reach the [[Bosphorus]], once again raiding the surrounding countryside. A Turkish fleet sent to destroy the Cossack forces was defeated in 1617. The Cossacks once again managed to mount an attack on Istanbul in 1625, forcing the [[Sultan]] to temporarily flee the capital. The Cossacks used several strategies to attack the larger Ottoman forces, such as positioning their ships during battle in a way that sun was always at their back. The Cossack ships were small with a low profile, making them hard to hit by cannon. Cossacks were typically armed with small arm muskets, and during battle had the goal of killing the crew and boarding the ship to take it over, rather than sinking the ship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/unavy/aCossack1.html |publisher=Web Cite |title=Cossack Navy 16th \u2013 17th Centuries |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5knsYNTNL?url=http://www.geocities.com/unavy/aCossack1.html |archivedate=October 26, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==NAVY period==\n\n===Ukrainian People's Republic NAVY 1917\u20131921===\n\n{{see also|Navy of the Ukrainian People's Republic}}\n[[File:\u041c\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0424\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0430.jpg|thumb|\u041c\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0424\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0430, 1918 \u0433\u043e\u0434.|305px|left|Medal of Ukrainian fleet of April 29, 1918.]]\n[[File:\u0414\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446.PNG|thumb|right|305px|Gunboat \"Donets\" of Ukrainian Naval Forces, July\u2013November 1918]]\n[[File:\u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u044f\u0445 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0446\u044b \u0423\u041d\u0420, 1920 \u0433.jpg|thumb|right|305px|Ukrainian marines in 1921]]\n[[File:Sevastopol1918e.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ukrainian warships in the port of [[Sevastopol]], 1918]]\nDuring [[1917 Russian Revolution]], several ships of the Russian Imperial Navy's [[Black Sea Fleet]], commanded and crewed by ethnic Ukrainians, declared themselves the Navy of the newly autonomous [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. Black Sea Fleet commander [[Mikhail Sablin]] raised the colours of the Ukrainian National Republic on 29 April 1918.<ref>[http://ukrainianweek.com/History/22688 Operation Fleet For Ukraine], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (16 May 2011)</ref><ref>{{in lang|ru}} [https://ru.krymr.com/a/interactive-map/29189950.html Crimean campaign of Peter Bolbochan in 1918], [[Radio Free Europe]] (April 2018)</ref> However, few further steps on establishing a navy were made as the Ukrainian government lost control over coastal territories.\n\nAfter the Revolution 1917, a time of anarchy and demoralization overtook the former Russian Black Sea Fleet. The Fleet, stationed in [[Sevastopol]], was commanded by a collective, \"Tsentroflot\". Different political influences clashed: Ukrainian, [[Bolshevik]], [[Menshevik]], [[Social Revolutionaries]] and [[Anarchist]]. Very different flags were hoisted over ships: Ukrainian bicolors, old Russian ensigns, Bolshevist red flags and Anarchist black flags.<ref>[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ua~1918.html Ukraine \u2013 Historical Naval Flags (1918)], accessed October 2009</ref> They were hoisted and lowered even several times daily, according to changes of each crew's political orientation. The Ukrainian People's Republic aspired to take control of the Fleet. On 22 December 1917 the Naval Ministry in Kiev was established.\n\nStarting October 1917 the crews of the ships established military councils; the [[Flag of Ukraine|blue-yellow flags]] were flying from the masts. The ships Zavidniy (Enviable) and [[Russian cruiser Pamiat Merkuria (1907)]] were the first examples. The General Secretariat for Naval Affairs was established within the government of the [[Central Rada]] in [[Kiev]] (in January 1918 it was reformed in a Ministry). The head of it became D. Antonovich. The Main Navy Staff was led by Captain [[Jerzy \u015awirski]]. For the educational and agitational purposes of the seamen the Central Rada seconded the commissars to [[Odessa]], [[Mykolaiv]], [[Kherson]] and Sevastopol. November 22, 1917 the whole crew of the newest and most powerful warship of the Black Sea Fleet ''Volya'' swore fealty to the Central Rada, followed soon by several ships and submarines. On 29 April 1918, Rear-admiral M. Sablin was appointed commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Navy. A telegram to Kiev was sent from the staff ship ''Georgiy Pobedonosets'' \u201cEffective today the Sevastopol fortress and the Fleet in Sevastopol raised the Ukrainian flag. Admiral Sablin assumed the command of the Fleet\u201d. Having no reply the admiral ordered to repeat the telegram beginning with the words \u201cComrades of Kiev Central Rada...\u201d. But Sablin was unaware that at that moment the Central Rada in Kiev was already history.\n\nUkraine had a navy for five months. From October 1917 till March 1918 the following came to be at the disposal of the Ukrainians: nine [[battleships]], seven [[cruisers]], 18 [[destroyers]], 14 [[submarines]], 16 [[patrol ships]] and avisos, 11 military transports and mother ships. Additionally, the Fleet\u2019s Headquarters, all military institutions and plants, all coastal fortifications were in hands of the Ukrainians. But they were yet to face a disaster.\n\nThe Kaiser\u2019s forces had been advancing on Sevastopol with a goal to capture the Black Sea Fleet. Having no support from the land forces, Admiral Sablin was forced enter negotiations regarding cessation of hostilities. The [[History of Germany during World War I|Germans]] however rejected the armistice proposals and the advance continued.\n\nIn April 1918 German and Ukrainian troops [[Crimea Operation (1918)|invaded Crimea]]. On 29 April 1918, fleet-commanding Rear-admiral Sablin (Russian) gave an order to hoist Ukrainian national flags over all ships in Sevastopol (the medal to the right commemorates that event). But Germans started to occupy Sevastopol, because the bolsheviks began to lead away ships. Centroflot (the combined fleet revolutionary committee), in order to save the Fleet, took a decision to move it to [[Novorossiysk]]. But on April 30, 1918, only the small part of the fleet under command of Admiral Sablin, which trusted the bolsheviks, headed for Novorossiysk and hoisted Russian St. Andrew (saltire) ensigns. The greater part of the Ukrainian fleet remained in Sevastopol \u2013 there were 30 destroyers and torpedo boats, 25 auxiliaries, 7 battleships and small craft as well as 15 submarines left in Sevastopol under Admiral Myhaylo Ostrogradskiy who in this situation assumed command.\n\nOn 1 May 1918 Germans captured the ships remaining in Sevastopol, because the actions of Bolsheviks violated the peace agreement. On 17 June 1918, 1 dreadnought and 6 destroyers returned from Novorossiysk to Sevastopol, where they were also captured. The greater part of the ships remaining in Novorossiysk were destroyed by their own crews on [[Lenin]]'s command. In July\u2013November 1918 Germans gradually transferred many ships to the command of Ukrainian government ([[Hetman]] [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]]). The main Ukrainian sea power concentrated in Odessa and Mykolaiv was more than 20 minesweepers, 7 small cruisers, 1 dreadnought and more than 30 auxiliaries. In Sevastopol there were only 2 old battleships under Ukrainian flags. On 18 July 1918 the Naval Ministry in [[Kiev]] established new naval ensigns and some rank flags (e.g. flag of Naval Minister, flag of Deputy Minister). The old Russian jack remained as Ukrainian naval jack. It was regarded as symbol of glory of Black Sea Fleet, whose crews were in large part previously Ukrainian. On 17 September Germans gives Ukraine 17 U-boats. In December 1918, when naval forces of [[Allies of World War I|the Entente]] were approaching Sevastopol, Ukrainian Rear-admiral V. Klokhkovskyy (\u0412'\u044f\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 \u041a\u043b\u043e\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439) commanded all ships to hoist [[Order of St. Andrew|Russian St. Andrew (saltire) ensigns]]. It was a demonstration of good intentions for the Entente. However, the Entente captured the Black Sea Fleet and subsequently transferred it to the [[White movement|Russian \"White\" forces]]. In Ukrainian hands remained only small in numbers subdivisions of marines. Ukrainian naval authorities existed until 1921.\n\n====List of Ukrainian ships====\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0444\u043b\u0430\u0433 \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u044b 1917.jpg|thumbnail|Blue and yellow flag on cruiser Pamiat Merkuria, Nov 1917]]\nOn October 17, 1917 the 2nd rank Captain Ye.Akimov was appointed the representative of the [[Central Council of Ukraine]] at the command of the [[Black Sea Fleet]].

Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] (1991), the administration of the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] passed to the Joint Armed Forces of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] for a transitional period pending agreement on the division of the ex-Soviet military between members of the [[former Soviet Union]]. [[Marshal of Aviation]] [[Yevgeny Shaposhnikov]] became commander of the Joint CIS Armed Forces command on 14 February 1992.\n\nOn 6 December 1991 the [[Supreme Council of Ukraine]] (Verkhovna Rada) adopted a resolution on the laws of Ukraine \"About the Defense of Ukraine\" and \"About the Armed Forces of Ukraine\", as well as the text of a military oath. On the same day, in the [[parliament of Ukraine]] chamber, the [[Minister of Defense of Ukraine]], [[Kostyantyn Morozov]], became the first person to take the oath. On 10 December 1991 the Supreme Council of Ukraine ratified the [[Belavezha Accords]]. On 12 December 1991 the [[President of Ukraine]] issued [[ukase]] #4, ordering all military formations based in Ukraine to pledge allegiance by 20 January 1992. The vast majority of the Black Sea Fleet ignored the order. On 1 January 1992 the newspaper ''Vympyel'' of the Black Sea Fleet [[Filipp Oktyabrskiy]] Training unit (edited by Captain-Lieutenant Mykola Huk) published the military oath and the anthem of Ukraine in the [[Ukrainian language]].\n\nOn 3 January 1992 Ukraine started the practical formation of its national armed forces. On 8 January 1992 the Officers' Assembly of the Black Sea Fleet appealed to all leaders of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] to recognise the Black Sea Fleet as an operational-strategic formation and not subordinate to Ukraine. On 12 January 1992, the brigade of [[Soviet Border Troops|border troops]] in [[Balaklava]] ([[Sevastopol]]) became the first military formation to pledge allegiance to Ukraine. On 14 January 1992 the Governor of Sevastopol appealed to the Supreme Councils of both Ukraine and the Russian Federation, urging faster adoption of a decision on the status of the Black Sea Fleet. On 16 January 1992, an agreement between the participants of [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] was signed on the oath in strategic formations.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://zakon.nau.ua/doc/?code=997_142 |title=Text of the agreement on oath in the strategic formations |publisher=Zakon.nau.ua |date=1992-01-16 |accessdate=2014-03-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030090703/http://zakon.nau.ua/doc/?code=997_142 |archivedate=October 30, 2014 }} \n</ref>\nOn 18 January 1992, the 3rd company of the divers school became the first formation of the Black Sea Fleet to pledge their allegiance to Ukraine, along with the Maritime Department of the Sevastopol Institute of Instrument Engineering. On the next day, forty-six naval pilots pledged their allegiance to Ukraine at the central square (''Ploshcha Lenina'') of [[Mykolaiv]].\n\nBlack Sea Fleet military personnel previously under the oath of the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] did not hasten to pledge allegiance to the newly formed state. First Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy [[Admiral of the Fleet (Soviet Union)|Fleet Admiral]] [[Ivan Kapitanets]] issued a directive: \"to apply severe sanctions, including dismissal from office and separation from service to officers, midshipmen, and warrant officers who create an unhealthy situation in military communities that are prone to treason and taking the oath of allegiance to Ukraine \". Nonetheless, on 26 January 1992 the 17th Brigade of Ships for the Guarding the Water Area of the Crimea Naval Base followed the example of the divers.<ref name=\"vms-hist\"/> Right before the [[Soviet Army Day|Soviet Army and Navy Day]] (23 February) on 22 February, the 880th Independent Naval Infantry Battalion of Black Sea Fleet pledged allegiance to Ukraine. The battalion had been recognized{{by whom|date=October 2014}} as the best formation of the fleet in 1991. The Main Navy Staff in Moscow issued an order to dissolve the battalion. After the incident, all military units of the [[Black Sea Fleet]] recruited exclusively Russians{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}.\n\nAccording to estimations by the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]], in January of 1992 the Black Sea Fleet accounted for 80,000 servicemen, 69 major warships including 3 aircraft carriers, 6 missile cruisers, 29 submarines, 235 warplanes and helicopters, and great number of ships of auxiliary fleet.<ref name=forum86>[http://diasporiana.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/books/12761/file.pdf What is Black Sea Fleet Worth?]. \"Forum, a Ukrainian review\" at Diasporiana.

In January 1992 the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]] raised the question of the political status of [[Crimea]] ([[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Crimean ASSR]]) and of the constitutionality of the 1954 decision to transfer of [[Crimean Oblast]] of the [[Russian SFSR]] to the [[Ukrainian SSR]], accusing [[Nikita Khrushchev]] of treason against the [[Russian people]]. Although never annulled,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} many Russian parliamentarians refused to recognize the legal document, pointing out the procedural errors during its adoption. The Ukrainian side issued reminders of the number of international treaties and agreements between the two countries, such as the 19 November 1990 treaty between the Russian SFSR and the Ukrainian SSR, in which  both sides recognized the territorial integrity of the other, as well as the [[Belavezha Accords]] (an agreement on creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States) of 8 December 1991 and the [[Alma-Ata Protocol]] of 21 December 1991.\n\nNoticing not much reaction from the Black Sea Fleet command located on the territory of Ukraine, on 5 April 1992 the [[President of Ukraine]] issued Decree #209 \"About urgent measures on development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine\", which accused the [[Russian Federation]] and the Joint Armed Forces command of intervening in the internal affairs of Ukraine. On 6 April 1992, a session of the 6th Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian SFSR refused to accept the Belavezha agreement as previously ratified by the Supreme Council of the Russian SFSR (on 12 December 1991). Also, on 6 April 1992, the [[President of Ukraine]] appointed [[Borys Kozhyn]] as the Commander of Ukrainian Naval Forces. The next day, the [[President of Russia]] issued a Decree \"On the transfer of the Black Sea Fleet under jurisdiction of the Russian Federation\". On 9 April 1992, the effect of both decrees were suspended until the end of the Russian-Ukrainian talks.\n\n===Ukrainian division of the Black Sea Fleet 1991\u20131997===\n\n[[File:Boat U170 Skadovsk 2012 G1.jpg|thumbnail|Ukrainian Navy artillery boat ''Zhuk'' class U170 ''Skadovs'k'' off the [[Bay of Sevastopol]], [[Crimea]]]]\n\nIn September 1991, an office of the [[:uk:\u0421\u043f\u0456\u043b\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u0444\u0456\u0446\u0435\u0440\u0456\u0432 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438|Society of Ukrainian Officers]] was opened in [[Sevastopol]] on the initiative of Major [[Volodymyr Kholodyuk]] and captains-lieutenant [[Ihor Tenyukh]] and [[Mykola Huk]].<ref name=\"vms-hist\">{{cite web |title=Ukrainian Navy History |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/ukraine/vms-hist.htm |website=globalsecurity.org |date=27 March 2014 |accessdate=14 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303200357/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/ukraine/vms-hist.htm |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The society become the initiator and nucleus of the organization of the Ukrainian Naval Forces. On 7 April 1992 at 17:00 37 officers of the administration and headquarters of the Crimean Naval Base (an administrative entity and not a physical \"base\") pledged their allegiance and loyalty to people of Ukraine. Rear Admiral Borys Kozhyn, who was in charge, was not present at that time of the event. He was in the office of [[Ivan Yermakov]] accepting a proposition of the First Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine to become the commander of the future Ukrainian Naval Forces. On 8 April 1992 the [[Minister of Defense of Ukraine|Minister of Defense]] signed a directive \"About creation of the Ukrainian Naval Forces\". On 13 April 1992 an organizational group was established on creation of the Ukrainian Naval Forces, which upset the command of the [[Black Sea Fleet]].\n\nThe current history of the Ukrainian Naval Forces began on 1 August 1992, when it was formally established by order of the President of Ukraine [[Leonid Kravchuk]]. This was followed by a long and controversial [[Black Sea Fleet#Partition of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet|partition of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet]] between newly independent Ukraine and the [[Russian Federation]].\n\n[[File:SKR-112-Ukraine.png|thumb|600 px|right|SKR-112 on 20 July 1992]]\nOne of the episodes of this process was the story of ''[[SKR-112]]'' \u2013 effectively the first Ukrainian Navy ship.<ref name=uknavy>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/ukraine/vms.htm |title=Ukrainian Navy |website=globalsecurity.org |date=26 April 2014 |accessdate=14 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160721134518/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/ukraine/vms.htm |archive-date=21 July 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 20 July 1992, the crew of ''SKR-112'' declared itself a Ukrainian ship and raised the [[Flag of Ukraine|Ukrainian flag]]. The Navy headquarters in Moscow considered this a [[mutiny]] and attempted to act accordingly. The ship left its base on the Crimean peninsula bound for [[Odessa]], causing a chase and ramming attempts by ships still loyal to Moscow. Soon several other ships, auxiliary vessels, and coastal units of the Black Sea Fleet followed ''SKR-112''{{'}}s decision but with less violent outcomes.\n\nIt was only in 1997 that the ships and equipment of the Black Sea Fleet were officially divided between the two countries. The new Russian formation retained its historic name \"Black Sea Fleet\". Under the terms of a negotiated lease agreement it was also granted rights to use the majority of its bases on the Crimea Peninsula, Ukraine on a renewable ten-year [[lease]] basis at least until 2017. The newly established Ukrainian Naval Forces received dozens of vessels (mostly obsolete or inoperative, not unlike some of those retained by Russia) and some shore-based infrastructure. However, the Russian Navy lost several important facilities, most notably the ''NITKA'' (Russian acronym for \"Scientific testing simulator for shipborne aviation\") [[naval aviation]] training facility in [[Saky]], and the [[special forces]] base in [[Ochakiv]]. The process of fleet division remained painful since many aspects of the two navies' co-existence were under-regulated, causing recurring conflicts.\n\n[[File:\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e-\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u201c\u0421\u0456 \u0411\u0440\u0438\u0437 - 2016\u201d (28075162974).jpg|right|thumb|The [[Krivak-class frigate|Krivak III-class]] frigate {{ship|Ukrainian frigate|Hetman Sahaydachniy|U130|2}} is the current flagship of the Ukrainian Navy.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.interfax.co.uk/ukraine-news/kozhara-hetman-sahaidachny-frigate-to-join-natos-anti-piracy-operation/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130917123531/http://www.interfax.co.uk/ukraine-news/kozhara-hetman-sahaidachny-frigate-to-join-natos-anti-piracy-operation/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 September 2013 |title=Kozhara: Hetman Sahaidachny frigate to join NATO\u2019s anti-piracy operation |newspaper=[[Interfax-Ukraine]] |date=17 September 2013}}</ref>]]\n\nSince 1997 due to lack of financing and neglect most of the Ukrainian naval units have been scrapped or poorly maintained.

It was released as a [[Single (music)|single]] on May 21, 2000, after an unfinished version leaked to radio. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song that speaks about loving a person for who they are and disregarding their physical appearance. The track is based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of her previous album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\nThe song generally received positive reception, becoming Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States after peaking on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, placing her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single reached number five in the United Kingdom, and peaked within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark, eventually attaining a silver certification in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to scenes from the film, it also features futuristic technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. It had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, causing it to become one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her earliest appearances in the video, performing as a dancer.
