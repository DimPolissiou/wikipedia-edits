In 1992, a large contract between Korea Yon\u2019gwang Trading Company and [[Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau]] of Miass, Russia  was signed. The  agreement stated that Russian engineers  would go to the DPRK and assist in the development of the Zyb Space Launch Vehicle (SLV).<ref name=\"csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\"/>\n\nIt was decided that, as the [[Korean People's Army]]'s [[MAZ-547A]]/MAZ-7916 [[Transporter erector launcher]] could carry 20 tonnes, and the R-27 Zyb was only 14.2 tonnes, the R-27 Zyb's fuel/oxidizer tank could be extended by approximately 2 metres.<ref name=rand-2012/> Additionally, the warhead was reduced from a three-warhead [[MIRV]] to a single warhead.\n\nThe actual rocket design is a [[liquid fuel rocket]], generally believed to use a [[hypergolic]] combination of [[unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine]] (UDMH) as fuel, and [[nitrogen tetroxide]] (NTO) as oxidizer.<ref name=rand-2012/> Once the fuel/oxidizer combination are fed into the missile, it could maintain a 'ready to launch' condition for several days, or even weeks, like the R-27 SLBM, in moderate ambient temperatures. A fueled Hwasong-10 would not have the structural strength to be safely land transported, so would have to be fueled at the launch site.<ref name=rand-2012/>\n\nIt was originally believed that the rocket motors of Hwasong-10 is made up the second stage of the [[Taepodong-2]], which North Korea unsuccessfully test fired in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/dprk/images/taepo-dong-2.jpg|title=2nd 3rd Right Side|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref> However analysis of the [[Unha-3]] launch, believed to be based on the Taepodong-2, showed that the second stage did not use the same fuel as the R-27, and is probably based on [[Rodong-1|Nodong]] rocket technology.<ref name=rand-2012/>\n\nInitially it was believed that there is a possibility that Hwasong-10 likewise is using the Nodong's [[kerosene]] and [[Red fuming nitric acid|corrosion inhibited red fuming nitric acid]] (IRFNA) propellants, reducing the missile's range by about half.<ref name=rand-2012/><ref name=schmucker-2012>{{cite report |url=http://lewis.armscontrolwonk.com/files/2012/05/Explaining_the_Musudan_Schiller_Schmucker_v1.2.pdf |title=Explaining the Musudan |author=Markus Schiller, Robert H.

North\nKorea has not conducted any tests of this missile, but the\nU.S. has said that North Korea transferred 19 of these\nmissiles to Iran.  It is hard for Russia to follow the logic\ntrail on this.  Since Russia has not seen any evidence of\nthis missile being developed or tested, it is hard for Russia\nto imagine that Iran would buy an untested system.  Russia\ndoes not understand how a deal would be made for an untested\nmissile.  References to the missile's existence are more in\nthe domain of political literature than technical fact.

In 1992, a large contract between Korea Yon\u2019gwang Trading Company and [[Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau]] of Miass, Russia  was signed. The  agreement stated that Russian engineers  would go to the DPRK and assist in the development of the Zyb Space Launch Vehicle (SLV).<ref name=\"csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\"/>\n\nIt was decided that, as the [[Korean People's Army]]'s [[MAZ-547A]]/MAZ-7916 [[Transporter erector launcher]] could carry 20 tonnes, and the R-27 Zyb was only 14.2 tonnes, the R-27 Zyb's fuel/oxidizer tank could be extended by approximately 2 metres.<ref name=rand-2012/> Additionally, the warhead was reduced from a three-warhead [[MIRV]] to a single warhead.\n\nThe actual rocket design is a [[liquid fuel rocket]], generally believed to use a [[hypergolic]] combination of [[unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine]] (UDMH) as fuel, and [[nitrogen tetroxide]] (NTO) as oxidizer.<ref name=rand-2012/> Once the fuel/oxidizer combination are fed into the missile, it could maintain a 'ready to launch' condition for several days, or even weeks, like the R-27 SLBM, in moderate ambient temperatures. A fueled Hwasong-10 would not have the structural strength to be safely land transported, so would have to be fueled at the launch site.<ref name=rand-2012/>\n\nIt was originally believed that the rocket motors of Hwasong-10 is made up the second stage of the [[Taepodong-2]], which North Korea unsuccessfully test fired in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/dprk/images/taepo-dong-2.jpg|title=2nd 3rd Right Side|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref> However analysis of the [[Unha-3]] launch, believed to be based on the Taepodong-2, showed that the second stage did not use the same fuel as the R-27, and is probably based on [[Rodong-1|Nodong]] rocket technology.<ref name=rand-2012/>\n\nInitially it was believed that there is a possibility that Hwasong-10 likewise is using the Nodong's [[kerosene]] and [[Red fuming nitric acid|corrosion inhibited red fuming nitric acid]] (IRFNA) propellants, reducing the missile's range by about half.<ref name=rand-2012/><ref name=schmucker-2012>{{cite report |url=http://lewis.armscontrolwonk.com/files/2012/05/Explaining_the_Musudan_Schiller_Schmucker_v1.2.pdf |title=Explaining the Musudan |author=Markus Schiller, Robert H.
