The company is based in [[Bellevue, Washington]].<ref name=\"gamesradar history\" /> Valve's first game was ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', a [[first-person shooter]] released in 1998.<ref name=\"ign hl review\" /> It received universal acclaim and sold over nine million retail copies.<ref name=\"metacritic hl\" /><ref name=\"gamasutra sales\" /> Alongside ''Half-Life''{{'}}s launch, Valve released development tools to enable the player community to create content and [[Mod (video gaming)|mods]].<ref name=\"bafta fellowship\" /> The company then proceeded to hire the creators of popular mods, such as ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'', which became the most popular multiplayer first-person shooter for the next decade.<ref name=\"gamesradar history\" />\n\nValve continued their trend of developing predominantly [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] video games in the 2000s with a number of critically successful releases. In 2004, they released the highly anticipated sequel ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' through their own digital distribution service [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. The game sold over 10 million copies and was met with acclaim. Valve released two subsequent episodes for ''Half-Life 2'' and later packaged those games together with the puzzle game ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' and the multiplayer shooter ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' in a collection known as ''[[The Orange Box]]''.<ref name=\"gamesradar history2\" /> By the end of 2008, combined retail sales of the [[Half-Life (series)|''Half-Life'' series]], [[Counter-Strike|''Counter-Strike'' series]] and ''The Orange Box'' had surpassed 32 million units.<ref name=\"gamasutra sales\" /> Newell also projected that digital sales of Valve's games would eventually exceed retail sales as Steam continued to grow.<ref name=\"gamasutra sales\" /><ref name=\"gamasutra steam\" /> In the late 2000s, Valve released two zombie-themed first-person shooters focusing on [[cooperative gameplay]] with the [[Left 4 Dead (series)|''Left 4 Dead'' series]]. The company continued to release multiplayer games with the launches of ''[[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]]'' and ''[[Dota 2]]'',<ref name=\"gamesradar history2\" /> both of which have large [[esports]] communities fostered by Valve.<ref name=\"espn esports\" /> During the 2010s, Valve began focusing on supporting their established multiplayer games with regular content updates.<ref name=\"gamesradar history2\" /><ref name=\"kotaku csgo update\" /><ref name=\"pcgamer dota7\" /><ref name=\"pcgamer tf2 updates\" /> In the late 2010s, Valve began investing in [[virtual reality]] and started to develop games and other software that make use of the technology, such as ''[[Half-Life: Alyx]]''.<ref name=\"polygon vr\" /><ref name=\"theverge hla\" />\n\nValve is considered to be one of the most important and influential companies in the gaming industry.<ref name=\"gamesradar important\" /> The reception of their games, along with the creation of Steam, has prompted some publications to list Valve as one of the top game developers of all time,<ref name=\"ign top maker\" /><ref name=\"gamasutra top dev\" /> and the most powerful company in [[PC game|PC gaming]].<ref name=\"gameindustry champion\" /> In 2013, Newell received a [[BAFTA Fellowship]] award with the BAFTA Games Committee recognizing the impact Valve had left on the gaming industry in producing

[[Video game publisher|publisher]] founded in 1996 by [[Gabe Newell]] and [[Mike Harrington]]. The company is based in [[Bellevue, Washington]].<ref name=\"gamesradar history\" /> Valve's first game was ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', a [[first-person shooter]] released in 1998.<ref name=\"ign hl review\" /> It received universal acclaim and sold over nine million retail copies.<ref name=\"metacritic hl\" /><ref name=\"gamasutra sales\" /> Alongside ''Half-Life''{{'}}s launch, Valve released development tools to enable the player community to create content and [[Mod (video gaming)|mods]].<ref name=\"bafta fellowship\" /> The company then proceeded to hire the creators of popular mods, such as ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'', which became the most popular multiplayer first-person shooter for the next decade.<ref name=\"gamesradar history\" />\n\nValve continued their trend of developing predominantly [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] video games in the 2000s with a number of critically successful releases. In 2004, they released the highly anticipated sequel ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' through their own digital distribution service [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. The game sold over 10 million copies and was met with acclaim. Valve released two subsequent episodes for ''Half-Life 2'' and later packaged those games together with the puzzle game ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' and the multiplayer shooter ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' in a collection known as ''[[The Orange Box]]''.<ref name=\"gamesradar history2\" /> By the end of 2008, combined retail sales of the [[Half-Life (series)|''Half-Life'' series]], [[Counter-Strike|''Counter-Strike'' series]] and ''The Orange Box'' had surpassed 32 million units.<ref name=\"gamasutra sales\" /> Newell also projected that digital sales of Valve's games would eventually exceed retail sales as Steam continued to grow.<ref name=\"gamasutra sales\" /><ref name=\"gamasutra steam\" /> In the late 2000s, Valve released two zombie-themed first-person shooters focusing on [[cooperative gameplay]] with the [[Left 4 Dead (series)|''Left 4 Dead'' series]]. The company continued to release multiplayer games with the launches of ''[[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]]'' and ''[[Dota 2]]'',<ref name=\"gamesradar history2\" /> both of which have large [[esports]] communities fostered by Valve.<ref name=\"espn esports\" /> During the 2010s, Valve began focusing on supporting their established multiplayer games with regular content updates.<ref name=\"gamesradar history2\" /><ref name=\"kotaku csgo update\" /><ref name=\"pcgamer dota7\" /><ref name=\"pcgamer tf2 updates\" /> In the late 2010s, Valve began investing in [[virtual reality]] and started to develop games and other software that make use of the technology, such as ''[[Half-Life: Alyx]]''.<ref name=\"polygon vr\" /><ref name=\"theverge hla\" />\n\nValve is considered to be one of the most important and influential companies in the gaming industry.<ref name=\"gamesradar important\" /> The reception of their games, along with the creation of Steam, has prompted some

name from the body of water along its eastern border known as the [[Lake Worth Lagoon]]. The lake itself was named for General [[William J. Worth]], who led U.S. forces during the last part of the [[Second Seminole War]]. {{As of|2010}}, the population estimated by the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] was 34,910.<ref name=censuspop/> It is a principal city of the [[Miami metropolitan area]], which was home to an estimated 6,012,331 people in 2015.<ref name=metropop>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metro_general/2006/CBSA-EST2006-01.xls |title=Annual Estimates of the Population of Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2006 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=2007-10-07 |format=XLS}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIndigenous people known as the [[Jaega]] were the earliest reported inhabitants of the section of the Florida Atlantic coast in the areas of Martin and Palm Beach Counties. Remains of shell mounds can be found near the Jupiter inlet, inland in what is now Boynton Beach and just south of the [[Boynton Inlet]], indicating pre-Columbian Jaega habitation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boyntonbeach.com/history/indians|title=Boynton Beach Indian Mounds - Jeaga - Boynton Beach.com|publisher=|accessdate=17 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe city's first settlers were Samuel and Fannie James, an [[African American]] couple and reported to be ex-[[slaves]], known as the Black Diamonds, who settled on the shores of the [[Lake Worth Lagoon]] near the current 5th Avenue South in 1885. (The stone monument located at the northwest corner of Lucerne Avenue and J Street inaccurately uses the date 1883, due to a transcription error). The couple made a claim for their land under the [[Homestead Act]] in 1885 and received a receipt for their claim on February 1, 1887. Their holdings, originally {{convert|187|acres|abbr=on}}, increased over time and came to include an additional {{convert|160|acres|abbr=on}} of homestead land south of Lake Avenue between M and F Streets, {{convert|160|acres|abbr=on}} in College Park acquired from the estate of William Stephan, where Fannie ran a pineapple farm, and {{convert|160|acres|abbr=on}} to the south between the current Dixie and Federal Highways, acquired from Swedish immigrants, Olai and Sarah Gudmundsen. The Jameses sold off most of this acreage in 10 and 20 acres parcels to new residents and investors.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pioneers of Jewell|last=Brownstein|first=Ted|publisher=Lake Worth Herald Publications|year=2013|isbn=978-0-9832609-4-3|location=Lake Worth, Florida|pages=50\u201351, 82\u201383, 100\u2013104, 112\u2013113}}</ref> After Samuel's death in 1909, Fannie sold her remaining 156 acres to developer, Palm Beach Farms company, keeping only an acre and a quarter farmette.

Koontz, The Greater Lake Worth Chamber of Commerce, 1997, p. 20.</ref> Fannie James was the first postmaster. The post office was located in a small dry goods shop which the couple operated to serve the lake traffic that connected the small [[Settler|pioneer]] [[Homesteading|homesteads]] located along the banks of the [[Lake Worth Lagoon]]. Area pioneers report that Jewell was included as a stop on the route of the [[barefoot mailman]] via the [[Jupiter and Lake Worth Railway|Celestial Railroad]] by July 1889.<ref>Lake Worth Pioneer Association, http://www.lwpa.org/barefoot_mail_route.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218185102/http://www.lwpa.org/barefoot_mail_route.html |date=2012-02-18}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[Henry Flagler]] extended [[Florida East Coast Railway|his rail line]] south from [[West Palm Beach]] to [[Miami]] in 1896, a land development scheme was created to plant a [[townsite]] between the railroad and the lake. Purchasers of agricultural lots, west of town, would also receive a small 25 foot lot within the City of Lake Worth,<ref>Lake Worth: Jewel of the Gold Coast, Jonathan W. Koontz, The Greater Lake Worth Chamber of Commerce, 1997, p. 74</ref> closer to the beach. The developer, Bryant & Greenwood, proposed to name the town Lucerne,<ref>''Lucerne \u2013 The City Beautiful'', Lucerne Herald, May 23, 1912</ref> however the [[United States Postal Service]] refused to accept the name because there already was a [[Lake Lucerne, Florida|Lake Lucerne]] post office north of Miami in [[Miami-Dade County|Dade County]], which is now a [[neighborhood]] in [[Miami Gardens, Florida|Miami Gardens]]. Therefore, the city fathers settled on the name Lake Worth, for the lake on which the fledgling town was sited. One of the main streets was named Lucerne Avenue instead.\n\nIn April 1911, \"A solitary Indian mound surrounded by wild woods marked the spot where flourishing Lake Worth is now growing beyond the most vivid imagination\", according to a promotional article published in the ''Lake Worth Herald'',<ref name=\"eyes\">''Lake Worth Herald'', February 28, 1963, p.12, reprint of Bryant & Greenwood promotional article entitled, ''The Eyes of the World are Turned Toward Lake Worth'', 1912</ref> The population of the nascent city stood at 38 in July 1912.<ref name=\"times_1974\">''Palm Beach Neighborhood Times'', March 28, 1974, p.1, \"Early Resident Recounts Lake Worth History\"</ref> During that busy year, the library, schoolhouse, newspaper, Women's Club, Chamber of Commerce and first church were established.<ref name=\"times_1974\"/> By the year's end, publication of the \"city's first census showed 308 residents, 125 houses, 10 wagons, seven automobiles, 36 bicycles and 876 fowls.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jcbserver.com/jcbnet/partners/lakeworthcity/cityinfo/history.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120910202923/http://www.jcbserver.com/jcbnet/partners/lakeworthcity/cityinfo/history.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 September 2012|title=www.jcbserver.com|accessdate=September 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe town was growing so fast that a new addition was platted in that inaugural year. The area along the Intracoastal from 5th Avenue South to 15th Avenue South still bears the name ''Addition 1.'' \"In the new addition, the Lake front has been divided into large lots covered with palm and tropical growth, where we expect to see charming villas and winter homes spring up as by enchantment. It will be the fashionable part of town, where the wealthy of the earth can display their artistic taste and make ideal homes. These lots are selling so fast that but very few are left.\"<ref name=\"eyes\" /> Included in the new addition were South Palm Park, a boat dock and P Street (now South Palmway) with its vibrant, green median and collection of 31 species of palm trees.\n\n===Later history===\nLake Worth Beach was incorporated as the \"Town of Lake Worth\" in June 1913. Many of the first residents were farmers from other parts of the American south and mid-west, looking to benefit from the growing winter vegetable market of the time. The city benefited with the rest of south Florida during the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s]]. A wooden automobile traffic bridge over Lake Worth was completed in 1919. The first casino and municipal beach complex was completed shortly thereafter. The 1920s also saw the completion of the [[Gulf Stream Hotel]], now on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nThe city was severely damaged in the 1928 [[hurricane]], toppling the bell tower on the elementary school (today the City Hall Annex) and destroying the beachfront casino and automobile bridge over Lake Worth. This led to a severe economic decline within the community, during the [[Great Depression]]. Things were so dire in the city in the 1930s, that President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[Works Progress Administration]] built a striking, moorish-styled \"City Gymnasium\" on the corner of Lake Avenue and Dixie Highway.

These new immigrants brought their industrious nature with them as well as their native customs, restaurants, shops, and churches and for decades the town flourished. To this day, one can find an abundance of beer halls, chocolatiers, [[Bavaria]]n delicatessens, and [[Lutheran]] churches, which stand out in the semitropical urban sprawl of South Florida.\n\nThe South Florida construction boom brought a new wave of immigrants in the past few decades. [[Central American]]s have added a [[Hispanic]] aspect to Lake Worth's culture. Included in the 1980s immigration were many Guatemalan-[[Mayan people|Mayans]] who consider themselves [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]], rather than \"Hispanic\" or \"Latino\" and some may not speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. They mostly converse in [[Mam language|Mam]], [[Q'anjob'al language|Q'anjob'al]], or any [[List of Mayan languages|one of 22]] existing [[Mayan language]]s spoken in Guatemala. Adding to the racial and linguistic mix of the city is a large [[Haitian people|Haitian population]], speaking [[Haitian Creole]] and [[French language|French]].\n\nDuring a short period of neglect and decline in the 1980s and 1990s, Lake Worth, in the words of then-city commissioner Dennis Dorsey, \"had become known as the [[Pornographic film|skin-flick]] capital of the country.\" The venue now known as the Lake Worth Playhouse was the Playtoy, and was well known in Palm Beach County as the theater that showed [[x-rated]] movies; ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' was shown there, motivating a police raid in 1973.<ref>Frank Cerabino and Laura Lordi, \"Our (se)X-rated history: A titillating tour of nudity in Palm Beach County,\"\n http://projects.mypalmbeachpost.com/nakedpalmbeachcounty/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131230652/http://projects.mypalmbeachpost.com/nakedpalmbeachcounty/ |date=2018-01-31 }}</ref>\n\nThe downtown area has seen a huge resurgence in interest and now sports an array of art galleries, sidewalk caf\u00e9s and night clubs. Once moribund property values have soared. The city's main street, Lake Avenue, contains some of the oldest commercial structures in South Florida, including the [[Art Deco]] [[Lake Worth Playhouse]].\n\nThe city was hit especially hard by Hurricanes [[Hurricane Frances|Frances]], [[Hurricane Jeanne|Jeanne]], and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]] in 2004 and 2005. The fishing pier was quite damaged but was repaired (with the help of FEMA) and reopened in May 2009. The pier is currently open to the public with entry fees of $1 per adult sightseer, and $3 per adult fisherman. The city's public swimming pool has been restored, and besides serving to instruct Palm Beach County residents in swimming and water safety, hosts water-sport competitions. The pier is home to a [[tide gauge]] with a sporadic history, showing an above average rate of [[sea level rise]].<ref name=\"lakeworthSLT\">{{cite web|url=https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_station.shtml?stnid=8722670 |title=Mean Sea Level Trend 8722670 Lake Worth Pier |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}} |accessdate=December 30, 2016</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the city was accused of asking for business licenses from surrounding churches.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-and-friends/blog/2015/03/06/florida-city-wages-soviet-style-crackdown-churches |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203065134/http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-and-friends/blog/2015/03/06/florida-city-wages-soviet-style-crackdown-churches |archive-date=2018-02-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2019 a ballot initiative to change the name of the city to Lake Worth Beach passed with a narrow margin.<ref>https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-lake-worth-new-beach-name-20190312-story.html</ref> The city states that the name change \"will be implemented slowly\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.local10.com/news/florida/palm-beach-county/lake-worth-changes-its-name-to-lake-worth-beach|title=Lake Worth changes its name to Lake Worth Beach|last=Swift|first=Tom|date=March 12, 2019|work=Local10.com|access-date=March 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Liriodendron and Roystonea.jpg|left|thumb|''Where The Tropics Begin'': Temperate-zone ''[[Liriodendron tulipifera]]'' and tropical native ''[[Roystonea elata]]'' near Lake Worth, spring 2006.

This lagoon opens to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at the [[Port of Palm Beach]] via the [[Lake Worth Inlet]]. The next closest inlet exists further south in [[Boynton Beach, Florida|Boynton Beach]]. The port and two inlets are all distant from the actual city of Lake Worth Beach. The lake is a long channel that spans much of northern Palm Beach County; indeed, the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] traverses the length of the lagoon. The manmade inlets to the ocean have replaced the natural [[freshwater]] with [[Seawater|saltwater]], such that the lagoon is actually now a tidal body, instead of a true lagoon.\n\nThe [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] has mapped most of Lake Worth Beach in the Southern Florida Flatwoods land resource area.<ref>\n{{cite map\n |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]\n |title=Map of Major Land Resource Areas in Florida\n |url=http://www.mo15.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/mlra_image_fl.html\n |year=1997\n |accessdate=2007-10-07\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328051938/http://www.mo15.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/mlra_image_fl.html\n |archivedate=2008-03-28\n}}</ref>\n\nDeep, poorly drained acidic sandy soils are typical for the area; they have gray [[topsoil]], white [[subsoil]], and a dark hardpan. Much of Lake Worth Beach is built on a rapidly drained white or gray sand which is too dry and infertile to support vigorous plant growth. The western outskirts of Lake Worth Beach are in the Southern Florida Lowlands area. Topsoils there are sandy, but the subsoils have a much higher content of [[clay]] and the soils are relatively fertile. As in the flatwoods, these soils are poorly drained for many purposes unless drainage systems are installed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mo15.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/mlra_fl.html |title=Major Land Resource Areas in Florida |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |accessdate=2007-10-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008050915/http://www.mo15.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/mlra_fl.html |archivedate=2010-10-08 }}</ref>\n\nLake Worth Beach bills itself as \"Where the [[Tropics]] Begin.\" Many tropical plants grow in the city; among the more prominent examples are [[mahogany]], [[Delonix regia|royal poinciana]] and many species of [[palm tree|palm]], including [[Coconut|coconut palm]]. [[Spathodea|African tulip tree]], [[avocado]] and many species of [[eucalyptus]] may also be found, although they are on the city's list of trees to avoid. [[Temperate]]-zone trees native to Lake Worth Beach or Palm Beach County include [[American elm]], [[live oak]], [[red maple]], [[red mulberry]], and [[slash pine]]. Species grown south of their native areas include [[Liquidambar styraciflua|American sweetgum]], [[Shumard oak]], and [[Liriodendron tulipifera|tulip tree]].\n\nAlthough the incorporated city of Lake Worth Beach is small geographically, as is common in Palm Beach County, a large unincorporated urbanized area with a Lake Worth postal address lies to the west of the city, and includes the [[census-designated place]] of [[Lake Worth Corridor, Florida|Lake Worth Corridor]]. It also includes western neighborhoods and communities such as The Fountains, Lago Lucerne, Lake Osborne Estates, Melaleuca Lane Corridor, and Palm Beach National.

It is distinguished by its two main streets, Lake Avenue and Lucerne Avenue, and by the fact that most of its downtown buildings are historic and almost all of them are either one or two stories tall. Downtown Lake Worth Beach is home to the [[Art Deco]] [[Lake Worth Playhouse]] and the [[Lake Worth Historical Museum]]. Yearly festivals such as the Street Painting Festival<ref>[http://www.streetpaintingfestivalinc.org/ Street Painting Festival]</ref> and Finlandia Week (a celebration of Lake Worth Beach's [[Finnish people|Finnish]] population) attract thousands of people.

The largest Oktoberfest in South Florida is held every October just outside the city on Lantana Road.  The City Tree Board organizes an annual \"Lake Worth Festival of Trees,\" which usually takes place in the Cultural Plaza on the third Saturday in February, and the weekend before the Street Painting Festival.

For many years the library was housed in various municipal buildings. The Lake Worth Library Association raised $66,000 in donations for a building completed in 1941 without any support from tax money. The library is still housed in that building.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/palm-beach/boynton-beach/fl-bbf-library-0921-20160920-story.html|title=Lake Worth's 'quirky' library celebrates 75 years|last=Engoren|first=Jam|date=April 17, 2019|work=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|access-date=April 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nEarly pioneer women of Lake Worth Beach saw a need for a school and a library. They posted an advertisement in May 1912 on the Lucerne Herald, the local newspaper, to ask for book donations. Soon, donations arrived in West Palm Beach and Mr. and Mrs. John L McKissock rode seven miles on their bicycles to pick up the book donations. The locals soon had a reading room full of books and read using candle light. They were proud to say that the library was born two years before electricity and before the first school was established.For several years, the library was housed in City Hall. In 1926, the Lake Worth City Council called for a vote and the library was established under the Florida Statutes. The Lake Worth Public Library was organized and the assets of the Library Association formed by the pioneers were turned over to the Library Board.\n\nIn 1939, Congress passed a bill providing $60,000 in funding to erect a library in honor of General William Jenkins Worth; however, President Franklin D. Roosevelt vetoed this bill. The community came together and raised funds to build a library and finally, in 1941, the library was constructed and named Lake Worth Library. A dedicatory service was held in August 12, 1941. The citizens are very proud to say that their library was built without taxing the citizens or Federal assistance.\n\nJames and William Strait provided $10,000 to build an art museum wing. This wing was the home of the Art League until it moved to a bigger location. This wing is now the children's library collection. The library still feels like an Art Museum since it houses the only known collection of historic paintings by noted artist, R. Sherman Winton which features historical Florida themes of the Spanish Period. The library also houses wood carvings by Sam J.

They offer fun and extensive Children's Programs and community workshops.  It is a part of the Library Cooperative of the Palm Beaches.\n\n==Public transportation==\nLake Worth Beach is served by a [[Tri-Rail]] station of the same name. It is also served by [[PalmTran]] buses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbcgov.com/palmtran/maps_schedules/|title=Bus Service Fixed Route|accessdate=17 September 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160906034356/http://www.pbcgov.com/palmtran/maps_schedules/|archivedate=6 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Recreation==\n[[File:Lake Worth Pier.jpg|left|thumb|Lake Worth Pier, damaged by [[Hurricane Frances]], [[Hurricane Jeanne|Jeanne]] and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]]]]\nLake Worth Beach has a bounty of public parks and open space. The Lake Worth is one of the last remaining large tracts of open, public space on the ocean in Southeast Florida. In 2013, the Casino building at the beach was reopened with great fanfare. The neoclassical building approximates the original 1920s Casino building that had stood overlooking the ocean until it was replaced by a more modern, boxy building after the 1947 hurricane.\n\nThe William O. Lockhart Municipal Pier, jutting into the Atlantic, is a recognizable symbol of the city; much of it was destroyed by Hurricane Frances in 2004, but has since been rebuilt and raised {{convert|5|ft|m}}. The pier creates sandbars which catch ocean swells, making Lake Worth Beach one of the most consistent surfing spots in South Florida.\n\nBryant Park, located in downtown Lake Worth Beach, has a 1920s-era bandshell which is used for festivals and other events. The nearby municipal golf course offers low-cost golfing with views of Lake Worth and Palm Beach beyond. On the west side of town, the county-owned [[John Prince Memorial Park]] follows the winding shores of [[Lake Osborne]] and offers several miles of bike and walking trails as well as hundreds of acres for picnicking, volleyball and overnight camping.\n\nOn February 29, 2012, the Snook Islands Natural Area was opened just to the north of Bryant Park. Amenities include a kayak launch, eight mooring slips, a fishing pier and nature walk around the mangroves of the southernmost of the Snook Islands. Dolphins, manatees and an assortment of tropical birds are commonly seen including [[heron]]s, [[ibis]]es, [[egret]]s, [[oystercatcher]]s, [[pelican]]s, [[cormorant]]s and other waterfowl.\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * * * * * * * * * *NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE\nOnly people who already have a Wikipedia article may appear here as notable people.

(The stone monument located at the northwest corner of Lucerne Avenue and J Street inaccurately uses the date 1883, due to a transcription error). The couple made a claim for their land under the [[Homestead Act]] in 1885 and received a receipt for their claim on February 1, 1887. Their holdings, originally {{convert|187|acres|abbr=on}}, increased over time and came to include an additional {{convert|160|acres|abbr=on}} of homestead land south of Lake Avenue between M and F Streets, {{convert|160|acres|abbr=on}} in College Park acquired from the estate of William Stephan, where Fannie ran a pineapple farm, and {{convert|160|acres|abbr=on}} to the south between the current Dixie and Federal Highways, acquired from Swedish immigrants, Olai and Sarah Gudmundsen.

The post office was located in a small dry goods shop which the couple operated to serve the lake traffic that connected the small [[Settler|pioneer]] [[Homesteading|homesteads]] located along the banks of the [[Lake Worth Lagoon]].

Purchasers of agricultural lots, west of town, would also receive a small 25 foot lot within the City of Lake Worth,<ref>Lake Worth: Jewel of the Gold Coast, Jonathan W. Koontz, The Greater Lake Worth Chamber of Commerce, 1997, p. 74</ref> closer to the beach. The developer, Bryant & Greenwood, proposed to name the town Lucerne,<ref>''Lucerne \u2013 The City Beautiful'', Lucerne Herald, May 23, 1912</ref> however the [[United States Postal Service]] refused to accept the name because there already was a [[Lake Lucerne, Florida|Lake Lucerne]] post office north of Miami in [[Miami-Dade County|Dade County]], which is now a [[neighborhood]] in [[Miami Gardens, Florida|Miami Gardens]]. Therefore, the city fathers settled on the name Lake Worth, for the lake on which the fledgling town was sited. One of the main streets was named Lucerne Avenue instead.\n\nIn April 1911, \"A solitary Indian mound surrounded by wild woods marked the spot where flourishing Lake Worth is now growing beyond the most vivid imagination\", according to a promotional article published in the ''Lake Worth Herald'',<ref name=\"eyes\">''Lake Worth Herald'', February 28, 1963, p.12, reprint of Bryant & Greenwood promotional article entitled, ''The Eyes of the World are Turned Toward Lake Worth'', 1912</ref> The population of the nascent city stood at 38 in July 1912.<ref name=\"times_1974\">''Palm Beach Neighborhood Times'', March 28, 1974, p.1, \"Early Resident Recounts Lake Worth History\"</ref> During that busy year, the library, schoolhouse, newspaper, Women's Club, Chamber of Commerce and first church were established.<ref name=\"times_1974\"/> By the year's end, publication of the \"city's first census showed 308 residents, 125 houses, 10 wagons, seven automobiles, 36 bicycles and 876 fowls.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jcbserver.com/jcbnet/partners/lakeworthcity/cityinfo/history.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120910202923/http://www.jcbserver.com/jcbnet/partners/lakeworthcity/cityinfo/history.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 September 2012|title=www.jcbserver.com|accessdate=September 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe town was growing so fast that a new addition was platted in that inaugural year. The area along the Intracoastal from 5th Avenue South to 15th Avenue South still bears the name ''Addition 1.'' \"In the new addition, the Lake front has been divided into large lots covered with palm and tropical growth, where we expect to see charming villas and winter homes spring up as by enchantment. It will be the fashionable part of town, where the wealthy of the earth can display their artistic taste and make ideal homes. These lots are selling so fast that but very few are left.\"<ref name=\"eyes\" /> Included in the new addition were South Palm Park, a boat dock and P Street (now South Palmway) with its vibrant, green median and collection of 31 species of palm trees.\n\n===Later history===\nLake Worth Beach was incorporated as the \"Town of Lake Worth\" in June 1913. Many of the first residents were farmers from other parts of the American south and mid-west, looking to benefit from the growing winter vegetable market of the time. The city benefited with the rest of south Florida during the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s]]. A wooden automobile traffic bridge over Lake Worth was completed in 1919. The first casino and municipal beach complex was completed shortly thereafter. The 1920s also saw the completion of the [[Gulf Stream Hotel]], now on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nThe city was severely damaged in the 1928 [[hurricane]], toppling the bell tower on the elementary school (today the City Hall Annex) and destroying the beachfront casino and automobile bridge over Lake Worth. This led to a severe economic decline within the community, during the [[Great Depression]]. Things were so dire in the city in the 1930s, that President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[Works Progress Administration]] built a striking, moorish-styled \"City Gymnasium\" on the corner of Lake Avenue and Dixie Highway.

These new immigrants brought their industrious nature with them as well as their native customs, restaurants, shops, and churches and for decades the town flourished. To this day, one can find an abundance of beer halls, chocolatiers, [[Bavaria]]n delicatessens, and [[Lutheran]] churches, which stand out in the semitropical urban sprawl of South Florida.\n\nThe South Florida construction boom brought a new wave of immigrants in the past few decades. [[Central American]]s have added a [[Hispanic]] aspect to Lake Worth's culture. Included in the 1980s immigration were many Guatemalan-[[Mayan people|Mayans]] who consider themselves [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]], rather than \"Hispanic\" or \"Latino\" and some may not speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. They mostly converse in [[Mam language|Mam]], [[Q'anjob'al language|Q'anjob'al]], or any [[List of Mayan languages|one of 22]] existing [[Mayan language]]s spoken in Guatemala. Adding to the racial and linguistic mix of the city is a large [[Haitian people|Haitian population]], speaking [[Haitian Creole]] and [[French language|French]].\n\nDuring a short period of neglect and decline in the 1980s and 1990s, Lake Worth, in the words of then-city commissioner Dennis Dorsey, \"had become known as the [[Pornographic film|skin-flick]] capital of the country.\" The venue now known as the Lake Worth Playhouse was the Playtoy, and was well known in Palm Beach County as the theater that showed [[x-rated]] movies; ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' was shown there, motivating a police raid in 1973.<ref>Frank Cerabino and Laura Lordi, \"Our (se)X-rated history: A titillating tour of nudity in Palm Beach County,\"\n http://projects.mypalmbeachpost.com/nakedpalmbeachcounty/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131230652/http://projects.mypalmbeachpost.com/nakedpalmbeachcounty/ |date=2018-01-31 }}</ref>\n\nThe downtown area has seen a huge resurgence in interest and now sports an array of art galleries, sidewalk caf\u00e9s and night clubs. Once moribund property values have soared. The city's main street, Lake Avenue, contains some of the oldest commercial structures in South Florida, including the [[Art Deco]] [[Lake Worth Playhouse]].\n\nThe city was hit especially hard by Hurricanes [[Hurricane Frances|Frances]], [[Hurricane Jeanne|Jeanne]], and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]] in 2004 and 2005. The fishing pier was quite damaged but was repaired (with the help of FEMA) and reopened in May 2009. The pier is currently open to the public with entry fees of $1 per adult sightseer, and $3 per adult fisherman. The city's public swimming pool has been restored, and besides serving to instruct Palm Beach County residents in swimming and water safety, hosts water-sport competitions. The pier is home to a [[tide gauge]] with a sporadic history, showing an above average rate of [[sea level rise]].<ref name=\"lakeworthSLT\">{{cite web|url=https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_station.shtml?stnid=8722670 |title=Mean Sea Level Trend 8722670 Lake Worth Pier |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}} |accessdate=December 30, 2016</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the city was accused of asking for business licenses from surrounding churches.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-and-friends/blog/2015/03/06/florida-city-wages-soviet-style-crackdown-churches |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203065134/http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-and-friends/blog/2015/03/06/florida-city-wages-soviet-style-crackdown-churches |archive-date=2018-02-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2019 a ballot initiative to change the name of the city to Lake Worth Beach passed with a narrow margin.<ref>https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-lake-worth-new-beach-name-20190312-story.html</ref> The city states that the name change \"will be implemented slowly\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.local10.com/news/florida/palm-beach-county/lake-worth-changes-its-name-to-lake-worth-beach|title=Lake Worth changes its name to Lake Worth Beach|last=Swift|first=Tom|date=March 12, 2019|work=Local10.com|access-date=March 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Liriodendron and Roystonea.jpg|left|thumb|''Where The Tropics Begin'': Temperate-zone ''[[Liriodendron tulipifera]]'' and tropical native ''[[Roystonea elata]]'' near Lake Worth, spring 2006.

This lagoon opens to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at the [[Port of Palm Beach]] via the [[Lake Worth Inlet]]. The next closest inlet exists further south in [[Boynton Beach, Florida|Boynton Beach]]. The port and two inlets are all distant from the actual city of Lake Worth Beach. The lake is a long channel that spans much of northern Palm Beach County; indeed, the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] traverses the length of the lagoon. The manmade inlets to the ocean have replaced the natural [[freshwater]] with [[Seawater|saltwater]], such that the lagoon is actually now a tidal body, instead of a true lagoon.\n\nThe [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] has mapped most of Lake Worth Beach in the Southern Florida Flatwoods land resource area.<ref>\n{{cite map\n |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]\n |title=Map of Major Land Resource Areas in Florida\n |url=http://www.mo15.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/mlra_image_fl.html\n |year=1997\n |accessdate=2007-10-07\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328051938/http://www.mo15.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/mlra_image_fl.html\n |archivedate=2008-03-28\n}}</ref>\n\nDeep, poorly drained acidic sandy soils are typical for the area; they have gray [[topsoil]], white [[subsoil]], and a dark hardpan. Much of Lake Worth Beach is built on a rapidly drained white or gray sand which is too dry and infertile to support vigorous plant growth. The western outskirts of Lake Worth Beach are in the Southern Florida Lowlands area. Topsoils there are sandy, but the subsoils have a much higher content of [[clay]] and the soils are relatively fertile. As in the flatwoods, these soils are poorly drained for many purposes unless drainage systems are installed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mo15.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/mlra_fl.html |title=Major Land Resource Areas in Florida |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |accessdate=2007-10-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008050915/http://www.mo15.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/mlra_fl.html |archivedate=2010-10-08 }}</ref>\n\nLake Worth Beach bills itself as \"Where the [[Tropics]] Begin.\" Many tropical plants grow in the city; among the more prominent examples are [[mahogany]], [[Delonix regia|royal poinciana]] and many species of [[palm tree|palm]], including [[Coconut|coconut palm]]. [[Spathodea|African tulip tree]], [[avocado]] and many species of [[eucalyptus]] may also be found, although they are on the city's list of trees to avoid. [[Temperate]]-zone trees native to Lake Worth Beach or Palm Beach County include [[American elm]], [[live oak]], [[red maple]], [[red mulberry]], and [[slash pine]]. Species grown south of their native areas include [[Liquidambar styraciflua|American sweetgum]], [[Shumard oak]], and [[Liriodendron tulipifera|tulip tree]].\n\nAlthough the incorporated city of Lake Worth Beach is small geographically, as is common in Palm Beach County, a large unincorporated urbanized area with a Lake Worth postal address lies to the west of the city, and includes the [[census-designated place]] of [[Lake Worth Corridor, Florida|Lake Worth Corridor]]. It also includes western neighborhoods and communities such as The Fountains, Lago Lucerne, Lake Osborne Estates, Melaleuca Lane Corridor, and Palm Beach National.

It is distinguished by its two main streets, Lake Avenue and Lucerne Avenue, and by the fact that most of its downtown buildings are historic and almost all of them are either one or two stories tall. Downtown Lake Worth Beach is home to the [[Art Deco]] [[Lake Worth Playhouse]] and the [[Lake Worth Historical Museum]]. Yearly festivals such as the Street Painting Festival<ref>[http://www.streetpaintingfestivalinc.org/ Street Painting Festival]</ref> and Finlandia Week (a celebration of Lake Worth Beach's [[Finnish people|Finnish]] population) attract thousands of people.

The largest Oktoberfest in South Florida is held every October just outside the city on Lantana Road.  The City Tree Board organizes an annual \"Lake Worth Festival of Trees,\" which usually takes place in the Cultural Plaza on the third Saturday in February, and the weekend before the Street Painting Festival.

For many years the library was housed in various municipal buildings. The Lake Worth Library Association raised $66,000 in donations for a building completed in 1941 without any support from tax money. The library is still housed in that building.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/palm-beach/boynton-beach/fl-bbf-library-0921-20160920-story.html|title=Lake Worth's 'quirky' library celebrates 75 years|last=Engoren|first=Jam|date=April 17, 2019|work=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|access-date=April 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nEarly pioneer women of Lake Worth Beach saw a need for a school and a library. They posted an advertisement in May 1912 on the Lucerne Herald, the local newspaper, to ask for book donations. Soon, donations arrived in West Palm Beach and Mr. and Mrs. John L McKissock rode seven miles on their bicycles to pick up the book donations. The locals soon had a reading room full of books and read using candle light. They were proud to say that the library was born two years before electricity and before the first school was established.For several years, the library was housed in City Hall. In 1926, the Lake Worth City Council called for a vote and the library was established under the Florida Statutes. The Lake Worth Public Library was organized and the assets of the Library Association formed by the pioneers were turned over to the Library Board.\n\nIn 1939, Congress passed a bill providing $60,000 in funding to erect a library in honor of General William Jenkins Worth; however, President Franklin D. Roosevelt vetoed this bill. The community came together and raised funds to build a library and finally, in 1941, the library was constructed and named Lake Worth Library. A dedicatory service was held in August 12, 1941. The citizens are very proud to say that their library was built without taxing the citizens or Federal assistance.\n\nJames and William Strait provided $10,000 to build an art museum wing. This wing was the home of the Art League until it moved to a bigger location. This wing is now the children's library collection. The library still feels like an Art Museum since it houses the only known collection of historic paintings by noted artist, R. Sherman Winton which features historical Florida themes of the Spanish Period. The library also houses wood carvings by Sam J. Schlappich, a local Lake Worth Beach artist who was featured in the Century of Progress Fair in 1933 and the World Fair 1939.\n\nThe Lake Worth Library is located in 15 North M Street, Lake Worth Beach, Florida, 33460, a Mediterranean type building in the heart of historic downtown Lake Worth Beach. They offer fun and extensive Children's Programs and community workshops.  It is a part of the Library Cooperative of the Palm Beaches.\n\n==Public transportation==\nLake Worth Beach is served by a [[Tri-Rail]] station of the same name. It is also served by [[PalmTran]] buses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbcgov.com/palmtran/maps_schedules/|title=Bus Service Fixed Route|accessdate=17 September 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160906034356/http://www.pbcgov.com/palmtran/maps_schedules/|archivedate=6 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Recreation==\n[[File:Lake Worth Pier.jpg|left|thumb|Lake Worth Pier, damaged by [[Hurricane Frances]], [[Hurricane Jeanne|Jeanne]] and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]]]]\nLake Worth Beach has a bounty of public parks and open space. The Lake Worth is one of the last remaining large tracts of open, public space on the ocean in Southeast Florida. In 2013, the Casino building at the beach was reopened with great fanfare. The neoclassical building approximates the original 1920s Casino building that had stood overlooking the ocean until it was replaced by a more modern, boxy building after the 1947 hurricane.\n\nThe William O. Lockhart Municipal Pier, jutting into the Atlantic, is a recognizable symbol of the city; much of it was destroyed by Hurricane Frances in 2004, but has since been rebuilt and raised {{convert|5|ft|m}}. The pier creates sandbars which catch ocean swells, making Lake Worth Beach one of the most consistent surfing spots in South Florida.\n\nBryant Park, located in downtown Lake Worth Beach, has a 1920s-era bandshell which is used for festivals and other events. The nearby municipal golf course offers low-cost golfing with views of Lake Worth and Palm Beach beyond. On the west side of town, the county-owned [[John Prince Memorial Park]] follows the winding shores of [[Lake Osborne]] and offers several miles of bike and walking trails as well as hundreds of acres for picnicking, volleyball and overnight camping.\n\nOn February 29, 2012, the Snook Islands Natural Area was opened just to the north of Bryant Park. Amenities include a kayak launch, eight mooring slips, a fishing pier and nature walk around the mangroves of the southernmost of the Snook Islands. Dolphins, manatees and an assortment of tropical birds are commonly seen including [[heron]]s, [[ibis]]es, [[egret]]s, [[oystercatcher]]s, [[pelican]]s, [[cormorant]]s and other waterfowl.\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * * * * * * * * * *NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE\nOnly people who already have a Wikipedia article may appear here as notable people.

A [[horse]] \u2013 an erect-stanced [[unguligrade]] [[quadruped]] \u2013 with a [[Horse gait#Gallop|gallop]]ing [[Horse gait|gait]]. A 2006 animation of 1887 photos by [[Eadweard Muybridge]]]]\n'''Terrestrial locomotion''' has [[Evolution|evolved]] as [[animal]]s adapted from [[ecoregion#Marine|aquatic]] to [[ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial]] environments. [[Locomotion]] on land raises different problems than that in water, with reduced [[friction]] being replaced by the effects of [[gravity]].\n\nAs viewed from [[evolutionary taxonomy]], there are three basic forms of [[animal locomotion]] in the terrestrial environment:\n*[[#Legged locomotion|legged]] \u2013 moving by using [[appendage]]s\n*[[#Limbless locomotion|limbless locomotion]] \u2013 moving without legs, primarily using the body itself as a propulsive structure.\n*[[#Rolling|rolling]] \u2013 rotating the body over the substrate\n\nSome [[terrain]]s and [[land cover|terrestrial surfaces]] permit or demand alternative locomotive styles. A sliding component to locomotion becomes possible on slippery surfaces (such as [[ice]] and [[snow]]), where location is aided by [[potential energy]], or on loose surfaces (such as [[sand]] or [[scree]]), where friction is low but purchase (traction) is difficult. Humans, especially, have adapted to [[sliding (motion)|sliding]] over terrestrial [[snowpack]] and terrestrial ice by means of [[ice skates]], [[ski|snow skis]], and [[toboggans]]. \n\nAquatic animals adapted to [[polar climate]]s, such as [[ice seals]] and [[penguins]] also take advantage of the slipperiness of ice and snow as part of their locomotion repertoire. [[Beavers]] are known to take advantage of a [[mud]] slick known as a \"beaver slide\" over a short distance when passing from land into a lake or pond. Human locomotion in mud is improved through the use of [[cleat (shoe)|cleats]]. Some snakes use snakes use an unusual method of movement known as [[sidewinding]] on sand or loose soil. Animals caught in terrestrial [[mudflow]]s are subject to involuntary locomotion; this may be beneficial to the distribution of species with limited locomotive range under their own power. There is less opportunity for [[animal locomotion#Passive_locomotion|passive locomotion]] on land than by sea or air, though [[parasitism]] ([[hitchhiking]]) is available toward this end, as in all other [[habitat]]s. \n\nMany species of [[monkeys]] and [[apes]] use a form of [[arboreal locomotion]] known as [[brachiation]], with forelimbs as the prime mover. Some elements of the gymnastic sport of [[uneven bars]] resemble brachiation, but most adult humans do not have the upper body strength required to sustain brachiation. Many other species of arboreal animal with tails will incorporate their tails into the locomotion repertoire, if only as a minor component of their [[suspensory behavior]]s. \n\nLocomotion on irregular, steep surfaces require [[agility]] and [[dynamic balance]] known as [[sure-footedness]]. [[Mountain goat]]s are famed for navigating vertiginous mountainsides where the least misstep could lead to a fatal [[falling (accident)|fall]]. \n\nMany species of animals must sometimes locomote while safely conveying their young. Most often this task is performed by adult females. Some species are specially adapted to conveying their young without occupying their limbs, such as [[marsupials]] with their special pouch. In other species, the young are carried on the mother's back, and the offspring have instinctual clinging behaviours. Many species incorporate specialized transportation behaviours as a component of their locomotion repertoire, such as the [[dung beetle]] when rolling a ball of dung, which combines both rolling and limb-based elements. \n\nThe remainder of this article focuses on the [[anatomical]] and [[physiological]] distinctions involving terrestrial locomotion from the [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] perspective. \n\n==Legged locomotion==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2013}}\n\nMovement on appendages is the most common form of terrestrial locomotion, it is the basic form of locomotion of two major groups with many terrestrial members, the [[vertebrate]]s and the [[arthropod]]s. Important aspects of legged locomotion are posture (the way the body is supported by the legs), the number of legs, and the functional structure of the [[leg]] and [[foot]]. There are also many [[gait]]s, ways of moving the legs to locomote, such as [[walking]], [[running]], or [[jumping]]. \n\n===Posture===\n[[File:Sprawling and erect hip joints - horizontal.svg|thumb|right | 300px | Hip joints and hindlimb postures.]]\nAppendages can be used for movement in a lot of ways: the posture, the way the body is supported by the legs, is an important aspect. There are three main ways<ref>Charig, A.J. (1972) ''The evolution of the archosaur pelvis and hind-limb: an explanation in functional terms''. In Studies in Vertebrate Evolution (eds K.A. Joysey and T.S. Kemp). Oliver & Boyd, Edinburgh, pp. 121\u201355.</ref> in which vertebrates support themselves with their legs \u2013 sprawling, semi-erect, and fully erect. Some animals may use different postures in different circumstances, depending on the posture's mechanical advantages. There is no detectable difference in energetic cost between stances.\n\nThe \"sprawling\" posture is the most primitive, and is the original limb posture from which the others evolved. The upper limbs are typically held horizontally, while the lower limbs are vertical, though upper limb angle may be substantially increased in large animals.  The body may drag along the ground, as in salamanders, or may be substantially elevated, as in [[monitor lizard]]s.  This posture is typically associated with trotting [[gait]]s, and the body flexes from side-to-side during movement to increase step length.  All limbed [[reptile]]s and [[salamander]]s use this posture, as does the [[platypus]] and several species of frogs that walk. Unusual examples can be found among [[amphibious fish]], such as the [[mudskipper]], which drag themselves across land on their sturdy fins.   Among the [[invertebrate]]s, most [[arthropod]]s \u2013 which includes the most diverse group of animals, the [[insect]]s \u2013 have a stance best described as sprawling. There is also anecdotal evidence that some [[octopus]] species (such as the genus ''[[Pinnoctopus]]'') can also drag themselves across land a short distance by hauling their body along by their tentacles (for example to pursue prey between rockpools)<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.tonmo.com/forums/archive/index.php?t-102.html |title = TONMO.com Forums |accessdate = 2008-08-03 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090904010308/http://www.tonmo.com/forums/archive/index.php?t-102.html |archive-date = 2009-09-04 |df =  }}</ref> \u2013 there may be video evidence of this.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/octopus/index.html |title = NATURE.

This mode of locomotion is typically found in large lizards such as [[monitor lizard]]s and [[tegu]]s.\n\n[[Mammal]]s and [[bird]]s typically have a fully erect posture, though each evolved it independently. In these groups the legs are placed beneath the body.

The best contender for [[unipedal]] movement is the [[springtail]], which while normally [[hexapoda|hexapedal]], hurls itself away from danger using its [[furcula (Collembola)|furcula]], a [[tail]]-like forked rod that can be rapidly unfurled from the underside of its body.\n\nA number of species move and stand on two legs, that is, they are [[bipedal]]. The group that is exclusively bipedal is the [[bird]]s, which have either an alternating or a hopping gait. There are also a number of bipedal [[mammal]]s. Most of these move by hopping &ndash; including the [[Macropodidae|macropod]]s such as [[kangaroo]]s and various jumping [[rodent]]s. Only a few mammals such as [[human]]s and the [[ground pangolin]] commonly show an alternating bipedal gait. [[Cockroach]]es and some [[lizard]]s may also run on their two hind legs.\n\nWith the exception of the birds, terrestrial vertebrate groups with legs are mostly [[quadrupedal]] &ndash; the mammals, [[reptile]]s, and the [[amphibian]]s usually move on four legs. There are many quadrupedal gaits.\nThe most diverse group of animals on earth, the [[insect]]s, are included in a larger [[taxon]] known as [[Hexapoda|hexapods]], most of which are hexapedal, walking and standing on six legs. Exceptions among the insects include [[praying mantis]]es and [[water scorpion]]s, which are quadrupeds with their front two legs modified for grasping, some [[butterfly|butterflies]] such as the [[Lycaenidae]] (blues and hairstreaks) which use only four legs, and some kinds of insect [[larva]]e that may have no legs (e.g., [[maggot]]s), or additional [[proleg]]s (e.g., [[caterpillar]]s).\n\n[[Spider]]s and many of their relatives move on eight legs \u2013 they are [[octopedal]]. However, some creatures move on many more legs. Terrestrial [[crustacean]]s may have a fair number \u2013 [[woodlice]] having fourteen legs. Also, as previously mentioned, some insect larvae such as caterpillars and [[sawfly]] larvae have up to five (caterpillars) or nine (sawflies) additional fleshy prolegs in addition to the six legs normal for insects. Some species of invertebrate have even more legs, the unusual [[velvet worm]] having stubby legs under the length of its body, with around several dozen pairs of legs. [[Centipedes]] have one pair of legs per body segment, with typically around 50 legs, but some species have over 200. The terrestrial animals with the most legs are the [[millipede]]s. They have two pairs of legs per body segment, with common species having between 80 and 400 legs overall &ndash; with the rare species ''[[Illacme plenipes]]'' having up to 750 legs.  Animals with many legs typically move them in [[metachronal rhythm]], which gives the appearance of waves of motion travelling forwards along their rows of legs.\n\n===Leg and foot structure===\n\nThe [[leg]]s of [[tetrapod]]s, the main group of terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s, have internal bones, with externally attached muscles for movement, and the basic form has three key [[joint]]s: the [[shoulder]] joint, the [[knee]] joint, and the [[ankle]] joint, at which the [[foot]] is attached. Within this form there is much variation in structure and shape. An alternative form of vertebrate 'leg' to the tetrapod leg is the fins found on [[amphibious fish]]. Also a few [[tetrapod]]s, such as the [[Macropodidae|macropods]], have adapted their [[tail]]s as additional locomotory appendages.\n\nThe fundamental form of the vertebrate [[foot]] has five digits, however some animals have fused digits, giving them less, and some early [[tetrapod]]s had more; [[Acanthostega]] had eight toes. Feet have evolved [[Comparative foot morphology|many forms]] depending on the animal's needs. One key variation is where on the foot the animal's weight is placed. Some vertebrates: amphibians, reptiles, and some mammals such as [[human]]s, [[bear]]s, and rodents, are plantigrade. This means the weight of the body is placed on the heel of the foot, giving it strength and stability. Most mammals, such as [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s are [[digitigrade]], walking on their toes, giving them what many people mistake as a \u201cbackward knee\u201d, which is really their ankle. The extension of the joint helps store momentum and acts as a spring, allowing digitigrade creatures more speed. Digitigrade mammals are also often adept at quiet movement. Birds are also digitigrade.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/Forest/5238/Jill/Avian_Skeleton/leg.htm |title = Leg and foot |accessdate = 2008-08-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404213544/http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/Forest/5238/Jill/Avian_Skeleton/leg.htm|archivedate=2008-04-04}}</ref> Hooved mammals are known as [[ungulates]], walking on the fused tips of their fingers and toes. This can vary from odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, pigs, and a few wild African ungulates, to even-toed ungulates, such as cows, deer, and goats.\nMammals whose limbs have adapted to grab objects have what are called prehensile limbs. This term can be attributed to front limbs as well as tails for animals such as monkeys and some rodents. All animals that have prehensile front limbs are plantigrade, even if their ankle joint looks extended (squirrels are a good example).\n\nAmong terrestrial [[invertebrate]]s there are a number of leg forms. The [[arthropod leg]]s are jointed and supported by hard external armor, with the muscles attached to the internal surface of this [[exoskeleton]]. The other group of legged terrestrial invertebrates, the [[velvet worms]], have soft stumpy legs supported by a [[hydrostatic skeleton]]. The [[proleg]]s that some caterpillars have in addition to their six more-standard arthropod legs have a similar form to those of velvet worms, and suggest a distant shared ancestry.\n\n===Gaits===\n[[Image:Kangaroo-in-flight.jpg|thumb|200px|A jumping kangaroo.]]\n[[File:Gait-of-healthy-Hamster.ogv|thumb|A walking hamster.]]\nAnimals show a vast range of [[gait]]s, the order that they place and lift their appendages in locomotion.  Gaits can be grouped into categories according to their patterns of support sequence.  For [[quadrupeds]], there are three main categories: walking gaits, running gaits, and [[leaping gaits]].  In one system (relating to horses),<ref name=\"Roberts1995\">{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Tristan David Martin|title=Understanding Balance: The Mechanics of Posture and Locomotion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o8RvD3X8ur8C&pg=PA211|accessdate=18 March 2015|year=1995|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-1-56593-416-0|page=211}}</ref> there are 60 discrete patterns:  37 walking gaits, 14 running gaits, and 9 [[leaping gaits]].\n\n[[Walking]] is the most common gait, where some feet are on the ground at any given time, and found in almost all legged animals.  In an informal sense, [[running]] is considered to occur when at some points in the stride all feet are off the ground in a '''moment of suspension'''.  Technically, however, moments of suspension occur in both running gaits (such as trot) and leaping gaits (such as canter and gallop).   Gaits involving one or more moments of suspension can be found in many animals, and compared to walking they are faster but more energetically costly forms of locomotion.\n\nAnimals will use different gaits for different speeds, terrain, and situations. For example, horses show four natural gaits, the slowest [[horse gait]] is the [[Horse gait#Walk|walk]], then there are three faster gaits which, from slowest to fastest, are the [[Trot (horse gait)|trot]], the [[canter]], and the [[Horse gait#Gallop|gallop]]. Animals may also have unusual gaits that are used occasionally, such as for moving sideways or backwards. For example, the main [[gait (human)|human gaits]] are bipedal [[walking]] and [[running]], but they employ many other gaits occasionally, including a four-legged [[crawling (human)|crawl]] in tight spaces.\n\nIn walking, and for many animals running, the motion of legs on either side of the body alternates, i.e. is out of phase. Other animals, such as a horse when galloping, or an [[inchworm]], alternate between their front and back legs. \n\nIn '''saltation''' (hopping) all legs move together, instead of alternating. As a main means of locomotion, this is usually found in bipeds, or semi-bipeds. Among the mammals saltation is commonly used among [[kangaroo]]s and their relatives, [[jerboa]]s, [[springhare]]s, [[kangaroo rat]]s, [[hopping mice]], [[gerbil]]s, and [[sportive lemur]]s. Certain tendons in the hind legs of kangaroos are very [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]], allowing kangaroos to effectively bounce along conserving energy from hop to hop, making saltation a very energy efficient way to move around in their nutrient poor environment. Saltation is also used by many small birds, [[frog]]s, [[flea]]s, [[Cricket (insect)|crickets]], [[grasshopper]]s, and [[Daphnia|water fleas]] (a small [[plankton]]ic [[crustacean]]).\n\nMost animals move in the direction of their head. However, there are some exceptions. [[Crab]]s move sideways, and [[naked mole rat]]s, which live in tight tunnels and can move backward or forward with equal facility. [[Crayfish]] can move backward much faster than they can move forward.\n\n[[Gait analysis]] is the study of gait in humans and other animals. This may involve videoing subjects with markers on particular anatomical landmarks and measuring the forces of their footfall using floor [[transducer]]s ([[strain gauge]]s). Skin [[electrode]]s may also be used to measure [[muscle]] activity.\n\n==Limbless locomotion==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}\n\n[[File:Helix pomatia on razor blade.jpg|thumb|''[[Helix pomatia]]'' crawling over razor blades. [[Terrestrial gastropod]]s crawl on a layer of [[mucus]]. This adhesive locomotion allows them to crawl over sharp objects.]]\nThere are a number of terrestrial and amphibious [[limbless vertebrates]] and invertebrates. These animals, due to lack of appendages, use their bodies to generate propulsive force.  These movements are sometimes referred to as \"slithering\" or \"crawling\", although neither are formally used in the scientific literature and the latter term is also used for some animals moving on all four limbs. All limbless animals come from [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] groups; there are no [[endothermic]] limbless animals, i.e. there are no limbless birds or mammals.\n\n===Lower body surface===\nWhere the foot is important to the legged mammal, for limbless animals the underside of the body is important. Some animals such as [[snake]]s or [[legless lizard]]s move on their smooth dry underside. Other animals have various features that aid movement. [[Mollusc]]s such as [[slug]]s and [[snail]]s move on a layer of [[mucus]] that is secreted from their underside, reducing friction and protecting from injury when moving over sharp objects. [[Earthworm]]s have small bristles ([[setae]]) that hook into the substrate and help them move. Some animals, such as [[leeches]], have suction cups on either end of the body allowing [[two anchor movement]].\n\n===Type of movement===\nSome limbless animals, such as leeches, have suction cups on either end of their body, which allow them to move by anchoring the rear end and then moving forward the front end, which is then anchored and then the back end is pulled in, and so on. This is known as [[two-anchor movement]]. A legged animal, the [[Geometer moth|inchworm]], also moves like this, clasping with appendages at either end of its body.\n\nLimbless animals can also move using [[pedal locomotary wave]]s, rippling the underside of the body. This is the main method used by [[mollusc]]s such as slugs and snails, and also large flatworms, some other worms, and even [[earless seal]]s. The waves may move in the opposite direction to motion, known as [[retrograde wave]]s, or in the same direction as motion, known as [[direct wave]]s. Earthworms move by retrograde waves alternatively swelling and contracting down the length of their body, the swollen sections being held in place using [[setae]]. Aquatic molluscs such as [[limpet]]s, which are sometimes out of the water, tend to move using retrograde waves. However terrestrial molluscs such as slugs and snails tend to use direct waves. [[Lugworm]]s and seals also use direct waves.\n\nMost [[snakes]] move using [[lateral undulation]] where a lateral wave travels down the snake's body in the opposite direction to the snake's motion and pushes the snake off irregularities in the ground. This mode of locomotion requires these irregularities to function. Another form of locomotion, [[rectilinear locomotion]], is used at times by some snakes, especially large ones such as [[Pythonidae|python]]s and [[Boidae|boa]]. Here large scales on the underside of the body, known as [[scute]]s are used to push backwards and downwards. This is effective on a flat surface and is used for slow, silent movement, such as when stalking prey. Snakes use [[concertina movement|concertina locomotion]] for moving slowly in tunnels, here the snake alternates in bracing parts of its body on it surrounds. Finally the [[caenophidian]] snakes use the fast and unusual method of movement known as [[sidewinding]] on sand or loose soil. The snake cycles through throwing the front part of its body in the direction of motion and bringing the back part of its body into line crosswise.\n\n==Rolling==\n{{anchor|Rolling}}\n{{main|Rotating locomotion in living systems}}\n[[Image:Steppenschuppentier1a.jpg|right|thumb|The pangolin ''[[Manis temminckii]]'' in defensive position.]]\nAlthough animals have never evolved [[wheel]]s for locomotion,<ref name='LaBarbera1983'>{{cite journal|last=LaBarbera|first=M.|year=1983|title=Why the wheels won't go|url=|journal=American Naturalist|volume=121|issue=3|pages=395\u2013408|doi=10.1086/284068}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Articles/1996-11-24wheels.shtml |title = Why don't animals have wheels? |author=Richard Dawkins |newspaper=[[Sunday Times]] |date= November 24, 1996 |accessdate = 2008-08-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070221073440/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Articles/1996-11-24wheels.shtml |archivedate = February 21, 2007}}</ref> a small number of animals will move at times by [[rolling]] their whole body.

[[Locomotion]] on land raises different problems than that in water, with reduced [[friction]] being replaced by the effects of [[gravity]].\n\nAs viewed from [[evolutionary taxonomy]], there are three basic forms of [[animal locomotion]] in the terrestrial environment:\n*[[#Legged locomotion|legged]] \u2013 moving by using [[appendage]]s\n*[[#Limbless locomotion|limbless locomotion]] \u2013 moving without legs, primarily using the body itself as a propulsive structure.\n*[[#Rolling|rolling]] \u2013 rotating the body over the substrate\n\nSome [[terrain]]s and [[land cover|terrestrial surfaces]] permit or demand alternative locomotive styles. A sliding component to locomotion becomes possible on slippery surfaces (such as [[ice]] and [[snow]]), where location is aided by [[potential energy]], or on loose surfaces (such as [[sand]] or [[scree]]), where friction is low but purchase (traction) is difficult. Humans, especially, have adapted to [[sliding (motion)|sliding]] over terrestrial [[snowpack]] and terrestrial ice by means of [[ice skates]], [[ski|snow skis]], and [[toboggans]]. \n\nAquatic animals adapted to [[polar climate]]s, such as [[ice seals]] and [[penguins]] also take advantage of the slipperiness of ice and snow as part of their locomotion repertoire. [[Beavers]] are known to take advantage of a [[mud]] slick known as a \"beaver slide\" over a short distance when passing from land into a lake or pond. Human locomotion in mud is improved through the use of [[cleat (shoe)|cleats]]. Some snakes use snakes use an unusual method of movement known as [[sidewinding]] on sand or loose soil. Animals caught in terrestrial [[mudflow]]s are subject to involuntary locomotion; this may be beneficial to the distribution of species with limited locomotive range under their own power. There is less opportunity for [[animal locomotion#Passive_locomotion|passive locomotion]] on land than by sea or air, though [[parasitism]] ([[hitchhiking]]) is available toward this end, as in all other [[habitat]]s. \n\nMany species of [[monkeys]] and [[apes]] use a form of [[arboreal locomotion]] known as [[brachiation]], with forelimbs as the prime mover. Some elements of the gymnastic sport of [[uneven bars]] resemble brachiation, but most adult humans do not have the upper body strength required to sustain brachiation. Many other species of arboreal animal with tails will incorporate their tails into the locomotion repertoire, if only as a minor component of their [[suspensory behavior]]s. \n\nLocomotion on irregular, steep surfaces require [[agility]] and [[dynamic balance]] known as [[sure-footedness]]. [[Mountain goat]]s are famed for navigating vertiginous mountainsides where the least misstep could lead to a fatal [[falling (accident)|fall]]. \n\nMany species of animals must sometimes locomote while safely conveying their young. Most often this task is performed by adult females. Some species are specially adapted to conveying their young without occupying their limbs, such as [[marsupials]] with their special pouch. In other species, the young are carried on the mother's back, and the offspring have instinctual clinging behaviours. Many species incorporate specialized transportation behaviours as a component of the locomotion repertoire, such as the [[dung beetle]] when rolling a ball of dung, which combines both rolling and limb-based elements. \n\nThe remainder of this article focuses on the [[anatomical]] and [[physiological]] distinctions involving terrestrial locomotion from the [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] perspective. \n\n==Legged locomotion==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2013}}\n\nMovement on appendages is the most common form of terrestrial locomotion, it is the basic form of locomotion of two major groups with many terrestrial members, the [[vertebrate]]s and the [[arthropod]]s. Important aspects of legged locomotion are posture (the way the body is supported by the legs), the number of legs, and the functional structure of the [[leg]] and [[foot]]. There are also many [[gait]]s, ways of moving the legs to locomote, such as [[walking]], [[running]], or [[jumping]]. \n\n===Posture===\n[[File:Sprawling and erect hip joints - horizontal.svg|thumb|right | 300px | Hip joints and hindlimb postures.]]\nAppendages can be used for movement in a lot of ways: the posture, the way the body is supported by the legs, is an important aspect. There are three main ways<ref>Charig, A.J. (1972) ''The evolution of the archosaur pelvis and hind-limb: an explanation in functional terms''. In Studies in Vertebrate Evolution (eds K.A.

Some animals may use different postures in different circumstances, depending on the posture's mechanical advantages. There is no detectable difference in energetic cost between stances.\n\nThe \"sprawling\" posture is the most primitive, and is the original limb posture from which the others evolved. The upper limbs are typically held horizontally, while the lower limbs are vertical, though upper limb angle may be substantially increased in large animals.  The body may drag along the ground, as in salamanders, or may be substantially elevated, as in [[monitor lizard]]s.  This posture is typically associated with trotting [[gait]]s, and the body flexes from side-to-side during movement to increase step length.  All limbed [[reptile]]s and [[salamander]]s use this posture, as does the [[platypus]] and several species of frogs that walk. Unusual examples can be found among [[amphibious fish]], such as the [[mudskipper]], which drag themselves across land on their sturdy fins.   Among the [[invertebrate]]s, most [[arthropod]]s \u2013 which includes the most diverse group of animals, the [[insect]]s \u2013 have a stance best described as sprawling. There is also anecdotal evidence that some [[octopus]] species (such as the genus ''[[Pinnoctopus]]'') can also drag themselves across land a short distance by hauling their body along by their tentacles (for example to pursue prey between rockpools)<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.tonmo.com/forums/archive/index.php?t-102.html |title = TONMO.com Forums |accessdate = 2008-08-03 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090904010308/http://www.tonmo.com/forums/archive/index.php?t-102.html |archive-date = 2009-09-04 |df =  }}</ref> \u2013 there may be video evidence of this.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/octopus/index.html |title = NATURE.

This mode of locomotion is typically found in large lizards such as [[monitor lizard]]s and [[tegu]]s.\n\n[[Mammal]]s and [[bird]]s typically have a fully erect posture, though each evolved it independently. In these groups the legs are placed beneath the body.

The best contender for [[unipedal]] movement is the [[springtail]], which while normally [[hexapoda|hexapedal]], hurls itself away from danger using its [[furcula (Collembola)|furcula]], a [[tail]]-like forked rod that can be rapidly unfurled from the underside of its body.\n\nA number of species move and stand on two legs, that is, they are [[bipedal]]. The group that is exclusively bipedal is the [[bird]]s, which have either an alternating or a hopping gait. There are also a number of bipedal [[mammal]]s. Most of these move by hopping &ndash; including the [[Macropodidae|macropod]]s such as [[kangaroo]]s and various jumping [[rodent]]s. Only a few mammals such as [[human]]s and the [[ground pangolin]] commonly show an alternating bipedal gait. [[Cockroach]]es and some [[lizard]]s may also run on their two hind legs.\n\nWith the exception of the birds, terrestrial vertebrate groups with legs are mostly [[quadrupedal]] &ndash; the mammals, [[reptile]]s, and the [[amphibian]]s usually move on four legs. There are many quadrupedal gaits.\nThe most diverse group of animals on earth, the [[insect]]s, are included in a larger [[taxon]] known as [[Hexapoda|hexapods]], most of which are hexapedal, walking and standing on six legs. Exceptions among the insects include [[praying mantis]]es and [[water scorpion]]s, which are quadrupeds with their front two legs modified for grasping, some [[butterfly|butterflies]] such as the [[Lycaenidae]] (blues and hairstreaks) which use only four legs, and some kinds of insect [[larva]]e that may have no legs (e.g., [[maggot]]s), or additional [[proleg]]s (e.g., [[caterpillar]]s).\n\n[[Spider]]s and many of their relatives move on eight legs \u2013 they are [[octopedal]]. However, some creatures move on many more legs. Terrestrial [[crustacean]]s may have a fair number \u2013 [[woodlice]] having fourteen legs. Also, as previously mentioned, some insect larvae such as caterpillars and [[sawfly]] larvae have up to five (caterpillars) or nine (sawflies) additional fleshy prolegs in addition to the six legs normal for insects. Some species of invertebrate have even more legs, the unusual [[velvet worm]] having stubby legs under the length of its body, with around several dozen pairs of legs. [[Centipedes]] have one pair of legs per body segment, with typically around 50 legs, but some species have over 200. The terrestrial animals with the most legs are the [[millipede]]s. They have two pairs of legs per body segment, with common species having between 80 and 400 legs overall &ndash; with the rare species ''[[Illacme plenipes]]'' having up to 750 legs.  Animals with many legs typically move them in [[metachronal rhythm]], which gives the appearance of waves of motion travelling forwards along their rows of legs.\n\n===Leg and foot structure===\n\nThe [[leg]]s of [[tetrapod]]s, the main group of terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s, have internal bones, with externally attached muscles for movement, and the basic form has three key [[joint]]s: the [[shoulder]] joint, the [[knee]] joint, and the [[ankle]] joint, at which the [[foot]] is attached. Within this form there is much variation in structure and shape. An alternative form of vertebrate 'leg' to the tetrapod leg is the fins found on [[amphibious fish]]. Also a few [[tetrapod]]s, such as the [[Macropodidae|macropods]], have adapted their [[tail]]s as additional locomotory appendages.\n\nThe fundamental form of the vertebrate [[foot]] has five digits, however some animals have fused digits, giving them less, and some early [[tetrapod]]s had more; [[Acanthostega]] had eight toes. Feet have evolved [[Comparative foot morphology|many forms]] depending on the animal's needs. One key variation is where on the foot the animal's weight is placed. Some vertebrates: amphibians, reptiles, and some mammals such as [[human]]s, [[bear]]s, and rodents, are plantigrade. This means the weight of the body is placed on the heel of the foot, giving it strength and stability. Most mammals, such as [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s are [[digitigrade]], walking on their toes, giving them what many people mistake as a \u201cbackward knee\u201d, which is really their ankle. The extension of the joint helps store momentum and acts as a spring, allowing digitigrade creatures more speed. Digitigrade mammals are also often adept at quiet movement. Birds are also digitigrade.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/Forest/5238/Jill/Avian_Skeleton/leg.htm |title = Leg and foot |accessdate = 2008-08-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404213544/http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/Forest/5238/Jill/Avian_Skeleton/leg.htm|archivedate=2008-04-04}}</ref> Hooved mammals are known as [[ungulates]], walking on the fused tips of their fingers and toes. This can vary from odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, pigs, and a few wild African ungulates, to even-toed ungulates, such as cows, deer, and goats.\nMammals whose limbs have adapted to grab objects have what are called prehensile limbs. This term can be attributed to front limbs as well as tails for animals such as monkeys and some rodents. All animals that have prehensile front limbs are plantigrade, even if their ankle joint looks extended (squirrels are a good example).\n\nAmong terrestrial [[invertebrate]]s there are a number of leg forms. The [[arthropod leg]]s are jointed and supported by hard external armor, with the muscles attached to the internal surface of this [[exoskeleton]]. The other group of legged terrestrial invertebrates, the [[velvet worms]], have soft stumpy legs supported by a [[hydrostatic skeleton]]. The [[proleg]]s that some caterpillars have in addition to their six more-standard arthropod legs have a similar form to those of velvet worms, and suggest a distant shared ancestry.\n\n===Gaits===\n[[Image:Kangaroo-in-flight.jpg|thumb|200px|A jumping kangaroo.]]\n[[File:Gait-of-healthy-Hamster.ogv|thumb|A walking hamster.]]\nAnimals show a vast range of [[gait]]s, the order that they place and lift their appendages in locomotion.  Gaits can be grouped into categories according to their patterns of support sequence.  For [[quadrupeds]], there are three main categories: walking gaits, running gaits, and [[leaping gaits]].  In one system (relating to horses),<ref name=\"Roberts1995\">{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Tristan David Martin|title=Understanding Balance: The Mechanics of Posture and Locomotion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o8RvD3X8ur8C&pg=PA211|accessdate=18 March 2015|year=1995|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-1-56593-416-0|page=211}}</ref> there are 60 discrete patterns:  37 walking gaits, 14 running gaits, and 9 [[leaping gaits]].\n\n[[Walking]] is the most common gait, where some feet are on the ground at any given time, and found in almost all legged animals.  In an informal sense, [[running]] is considered to occur when at some points in the stride all feet are off the ground in a '''moment of suspension'''.  Technically, however, moments of suspension occur in both running gaits (such as trot) and leaping gaits (such as canter and gallop).   Gaits involving one or more moments of suspension can be found in many animals, and compared to walking they are faster but more energetically costly forms of locomotion.\n\nAnimals will use different gaits for different speeds, terrain, and situations. For example, horses show four natural gaits, the slowest [[horse gait]] is the [[Horse gait#Walk|walk]], then there are three faster gaits which, from slowest to fastest, are the [[Trot (horse gait)|trot]], the [[canter]], and the [[Horse gait#Gallop|gallop]]. Animals may also have unusual gaits that are used occasionally, such as for moving sideways or backwards. For example, the main [[gait (human)|human gaits]] are bipedal [[walking]] and [[running]], but they employ many other gaits occasionally, including a four-legged [[crawling (human)|crawl]] in tight spaces.\n\nIn walking, and for many animals running, the motion of legs on either side of the body alternates, i.e. is out of phase. Other animals, such as a horse when galloping, or an [[inchworm]], alternate between their front and back legs. \n\nIn '''saltation''' (hopping) all legs move together, instead of alternating. As a main means of locomotion, this is usually found in bipeds, or semi-bipeds. Among the mammals saltation is commonly used among [[kangaroo]]s and their relatives, [[jerboa]]s, [[springhare]]s, [[kangaroo rat]]s, [[hopping mice]], [[gerbil]]s, and [[sportive lemur]]s. Certain tendons in the hind legs of kangaroos are very [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]], allowing kangaroos to effectively bounce along conserving energy from hop to hop, making saltation a very energy efficient way to move around in their nutrient poor environment. Saltation is also used by many small birds, [[frog]]s, [[flea]]s, [[Cricket (insect)|crickets]], [[grasshopper]]s, and [[Daphnia|water fleas]] (a small [[plankton]]ic [[crustacean]]).\n\nMost animals move in the direction of their head. However, there are some exceptions. [[Crab]]s move sideways, and [[naked mole rat]]s, which live in tight tunnels and can move backward or forward with equal facility. [[Crayfish]] can move backward much faster than they can move forward.\n\n[[Gait analysis]] is the study of gait in humans and other animals. This may involve videoing subjects with markers on particular anatomical landmarks and measuring the forces of their footfall using floor [[transducer]]s ([[strain gauge]]s). Skin [[electrode]]s may also be used to measure [[muscle]] activity.\n\n==Limbless locomotion==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}\n\n[[File:Helix pomatia on razor blade.jpg|thumb|''[[Helix pomatia]]'' crawling over razor blades. [[Terrestrial gastropod]]s crawl on a layer of [[mucus]]. This adhesive locomotion allows them to crawl over sharp objects.]]\nThere are a number of terrestrial and amphibious [[limbless vertebrates]] and invertebrates. These animals, due to lack of appendages, use their bodies to generate propulsive force.  These movements are sometimes referred to as \"slithering\" or \"crawling\", although neither are formally used in the scientific literature and the latter term is also used for some animals moving on all four limbs. All limbless animals come from [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] groups; there are no [[endothermic]] limbless animals, i.e. there are no limbless birds or mammals.\n\n===Lower body surface===\nWhere the foot is important to the legged mammal, for limbless animals the underside of the body is important. Some animals such as [[snake]]s or [[legless lizard]]s move on their smooth dry underside. Other animals have various features that aid movement. [[Mollusc]]s such as [[slug]]s and [[snail]]s move on a layer of [[mucus]] that is secreted from their underside, reducing friction and protecting from injury when moving over sharp objects. [[Earthworm]]s have small bristles ([[setae]]) that hook into the substrate and help them move. Some animals, such as [[leeches]], have suction cups on either end of the body allowing [[two anchor movement]].\n\n===Type of movement===\nSome limbless animals, such as leeches, have suction cups on either end of their body, which allow them to move by anchoring the rear end and then moving forward the front end, which is then anchored and then the back end is pulled in, and so on. This is known as [[two-anchor movement]]. A legged animal, the [[Geometer moth|inchworm]], also moves like this, clasping with appendages at either end of its body.\n\nLimbless animals can also move using [[pedal locomotary wave]]s, rippling the underside of the body. This is the main method used by [[mollusc]]s such as slugs and snails, and also large flatworms, some other worms, and even [[earless seal]]s. The waves may move in the opposite direction to motion, known as [[retrograde wave]]s, or in the same direction as motion, known as [[direct wave]]s. Earthworms move by retrograde waves alternatively swelling and contracting down the length of their body, the swollen sections being held in place using [[setae]]. Aquatic molluscs such as [[limpet]]s, which are sometimes out of the water, tend to move using retrograde waves. However terrestrial molluscs such as slugs and snails tend to use direct waves. [[Lugworm]]s and seals also use direct waves.\n\nMost [[snakes]] move using [[lateral undulation]] where a lateral wave travels down the snake's body in the opposite direction to the snake's motion and pushes the snake off irregularities in the ground. This mode of locomotion requires these irregularities to function. Another form of locomotion, [[rectilinear locomotion]], is used at times by some snakes, especially large ones such as [[Pythonidae|python]]s and [[Boidae|boa]]. Here large scales on the underside of the body, known as [[scute]]s are used to push backwards and downwards. This is effective on a flat surface and is used for slow, silent movement, such as when stalking prey. Snakes use [[concertina movement|concertina locomotion]] for moving slowly in tunnels, here the snake alternates in bracing parts of its body on it surrounds. Finally the [[caenophidian]] snakes use the fast and unusual method of movement known as [[sidewinding]] on sand or loose soil. The snake cycles through throwing the front part of its body in the direction of motion and bringing the back part of its body into line crosswise.\n\n==Rolling==\n{{anchor|Rolling}}\n{{main|Rotating locomotion in living systems}}\n[[Image:Steppenschuppentier1a.jpg|right|thumb|The pangolin ''[[Manis temminckii]]'' in defensive position.]]\nAlthough animals have never evolved [[wheel]]s for locomotion,<ref name='LaBarbera1983'>{{cite journal|last=LaBarbera|first=M.|year=1983|title=Why the wheels won't go|url=|journal=American Naturalist|volume=121|issue=3|pages=395\u2013408|doi=10.1086/284068}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Articles/1996-11-24wheels.shtml |title = Why don't animals have wheels? |author=Richard Dawkins |newspaper=[[Sunday Times]] |date= November 24, 1996 |accessdate = 2008-08-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070221073440/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Articles/1996-11-24wheels.shtml |archivedate = February 21, 2007}}</ref> a small number of animals will move at times by [[rolling]] their whole body.

The headquarters is in San Francisco.<ref name=\"god\"/>\n\nEarly issues contained a vast range of full-length album and 12\" [[single (music)|single]]/[[Extended play|EP]] reviews; later issues added new media release types, including reviews of books and [[DVD]]-based documentary and music video film releases.

Initial fund-raising resulted in a 5,000-copy print run of the first issue. The first issues were produced on a volunteer basis from a home office, but within three years the Lumen Foundation and ''Gnosis'' established permanent headquarters near [[Mission Dolores]] in San Francisco. In 1986, the writer [[Richard Smoley]] began contributing to the magazine and went on to become its managing editor (briefly) and then, beginning in 1990, its editor for eight years.\n\nBy 1990, ''Gnosis'' counted a circulation of 11,000 and went on to achieve a peak circulation of 16,000.<ref>[http://www.faith.com/inspiration/journals/ Faith.com]</ref> \nDuring its run, ''Gnosis'' published interviews with such significant thinkers and teachers  as [[Huston Smith]], [[Karen Armstrong]], [[Graham Hancock]], [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], [[Colin Wilson]], [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]], [[Kathleen Raine]], [[David Steindl-Rast]], [[Claudio Naranjo]], [[R. J. Stewart]], and [[June Singer]]. Its writers and reviewers included many notable authors in the field, such as [[Peter Lamborn Wilson]], [[Stephan A. Hoeller]], Kabir Helminski, [[Roger Walsh]], [[Jacob Needleman]], [[Carl W. Ernst]], [[Charles A. Coulombe]], David Fideler (founder of [[Phanes Press]]), [[Chas S. Clifton]], [[Erik Davis]], [[Robert Hand]], and [[John and Caitlin Matthews]]. Each issue usually included reviews of a dozen current books on topics of interest to ''Gnosis'' readers.<ref name=\"lumen\">[http://lumen.org/about_gnosis/about_gnosis.html Lumen Foundation website]</ref>\n\nAlthough it was written for a general readership, [[Wouter Hanegraaff]], professor of history of [[hermetic philosophy]] and related currents at the [[University of Amsterdam]], has observed that it \"contributed considerably to the setting of academic standards in a field where university chairs or curricula devoted to Western esotericism were still absent, and which at the time [in the 1980s and 1990s] was still dominated by sensationalism and plain ignorance.\"<ref name=\"hane\">[[Hanegraaff, Wouter J.]] \"Kabbalah and ''Gnosis'' Magazine: 1985-1999\".

In 1986, the writer [[Richard Smoley]] began contributing to the magazine and went on to become its managing editor (briefly) and then, beginning in 1990, its editor for eight years.\n\nBy 1990, ''Gnosis'' counted a circulation of 11,000 and went on to achieve a peak circulation of 16,000.<ref>[http://www.faith.com/inspiration/journals/ Faith.com]</ref> \nDuring its run, ''Gnosis'' published interviews with such significant thinkers and teachers  as [[Huston Smith]], [[Karen Armstrong]], [[Graham Hancock]], [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], [[Colin Wilson]], [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]], [[Kathleen Raine]], [[David Steindl-Rast]], [[Claudio Naranjo]], [[R. J. Stewart]], and [[June Singer]]. Its writers and reviewers included many notable authors in the field, such as [[Peter Lamborn Wilson]], [[Stephan A. Hoeller]], Kabir Helminski, [[Roger Walsh]], [[Jacob Needleman]], [[Carl W. Ernst]], [[Charles A. Coulombe]], David Fideler (founder of [[Phanes Press]]), [[Chas S. Clifton]], [[Erik Davis]], [[Robert Hand]], and [[John and Caitlin Matthews]]. Each issue usually included reviews of a dozen current books on topics of interest to ''Gnosis'' readers.<ref name=\"lumen\">[http://lumen.org/about_gnosis/about_gnosis.html Lumen Foundation website]</ref>\n\nAlthough it was written for a general readership, [[Wouter Hanegraaff]], professor of history of [[hermetic philosophy]] and related currents at the [[University of Amsterdam]], has observed that it \"contributed considerably to the setting of academic standards in a field where university chairs or curricula devoted to Western esotericism were still absent, and which at the time [in the 1980s and 1990s] was still dominated by sensationalism and plain ignorance.\"<ref name=\"hane\">[[Hanegraaff, Wouter J.]] \"Kabbalah and ''Gnosis'' Magazine: 1985-1999\".

In 1999, largely for financial reasons, ''Gnosis'' ceased publication.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://lumen.org Official site] of the Lumen Foundation.  \n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gnosis (Magazine)}}\n[[Category:Defunct magazines of the United States]]\n[[Category:Magazines established in 1985]]\n[[Category:Magazines disestablished in 1999]]\n[[Category:Magazines published in California]]\n\n\n{{reli-mag-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Hmains", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:category refine, sort sequence", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosis_(magazine)"}
