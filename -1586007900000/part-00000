A booked show is usually booked week in advance with some lottery spots selected by pulling candidates' names from a hat. With a regular open mic, a person puts their name on the list and they go on when their name is called by the host. With a \"bringer\" show, each performer has to bring a certain number of people (friends, family members, etc.) to get on stage. Open mic shows may have no cover charge, a reduced cover charge, or a minimum drink requirement. Open mic comedy nights are most widespread in larger English-speaking cities with a well-established stand-up comedy scene, especially [[London]] and [[New York City|New York]]. In these cities, with a plethora of aspiring comedians, the greatest challenge may be in attracting an audience.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n==Music==\n[[Image:Open Mic No Name Bar Sausalito CA July 2008.jpg|left|140px|thumb|A musician performs open mic at No Name Bar in [[Sausalito, California]].]]\nThese shows provide an opportunity for emerging musicians to gain experience performing to a live audience without having to go through the process of getting normal music gigs, which is very difficult to do without experience or a demo recording.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Open mics provide an outlet for [[singer-songwriter]]s. Prior to their popularity, the only outlet generally were [[folk clubs]], which were not always friendly towards creators of new music, preferring traditional, well-known music. They also suggested that music performed by [[acoustic music]]ians or solo artists in this manner would necessarily be folk music, a misconception that still commonly exists today. Some organizers have chosen the title \"acoustic night\" or \"acoustic club\" in an attempt to indicate an event run broadly on the lines of a folk club, but with a much wider range of musical styles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nOpen mic events are most commonly held in the middle of the week or at the very end of the weekend when footfall through venues is low. They rarely occur on the hallowed Friday and Saturday night time slots when venues are busy with weekend revellers and any live performance is usually specifically booked, professional artists. The most common night for a [[UK]] open mic event is Thursday, followed by Wednesday.<ref>{{cite web|title=Open Mic Finder Statistics|url=http://openmicfinder.co.uk/Statistics|work=Open Mic Finder Statistics|accessdate=23 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the largest ongoing open mic-styled music contest is [[Open Mic UK]], which regularly attracts 10,000 participants of all genres. The grand prize for the contest is an investment up to \u00a330,000.

In this format a bar or club will dedicate a particular night, usually in the middle of the week, as being \"open mic blues night\".  The establishment may supply a [[house band]], typically guitar, bass and drums, sometimes a [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]]. Singers, guitarists, harmonica performers who wish to play sign up, usually with the master-of-ceremonies or host. This person is tasked with screening the performers, choosing and ordering, and getting the performers on and off stage in a polite manner.\n\nSince the songs chosen need to be simple enough so that a band of musicians who have not played together can perform them without practice, blues standards are used.  Songs might be announced as a \"12-bar fast shuffle in C\" or \"slow 12-bar blues in F\", or similar phrases, that should be familiar to all concerned. Lead singers, keyboards, horn players, (usually saxophones) and various percussion instruments are common additions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rayrayblues.com/bluesjams/|title=Phoenix Blues Jams|first=|last=rayray|website=www.rayrayblues.com}}</ref>\n\n==Strip club==\nIn most strip clubs, amateur night is a contest held by the clubs themselves where women and men compete for cash by stripping just like their stripper counterparts.<ref>[http://www.scorestampa.com/blog/2015/02/01/want-to-be-a-stripper]</ref><ref>[http://www.stripclubs-of-las-vegas.com/deja-vu-showgirls-strip-club-review.html]</ref>\n\n==Rarer niche variations==\nThe terms \"open deck\" (where ''deck'' refers to the kind of [[Phonograph|turntable]] used by a [[DJ]]) and \"open reel\" (where ''reel'' refers to a [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]] reel) are used for more niche open mic events where keen amateurs can meet to exhibit and [[critique]] their skills/artform.

If a performer goes over their time limit, the host diplomatically thanks the performer for their contribution and asks them to yield the stage for the next performer.\n\n==Comedy==\n[[Stand-up comedy]] open mic nights can be held at established [[comedy club]]s, but they are more commonly held at other venues with or without a stage, often the upstairs or back room of a pub or bar,<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Durham\n |first=Rob\n |year=2011\n |title=Don\u2019t Wear Shorts on Stage: the stand-up guide to comedy\n |location=Middletown, DE\n |page=16\n |isbn=9781468004847\n |quote=Each comedy club or bar has its own system for signing up for [an] open mic.}}</ref> bookstores, colleges, rock clubs, and coffeehouses.<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Carter\n |first=Judy\n |year=2001\n |title=The Comedy Bible: From Stand-up to Sitcom\u2014The Comedy Writer\u2019s Ultimate How-To Guide\n |location=New York, NY\n |publisher=Simon & Schuster\n |pages=66\u201367\n |isbn=978-0-7432-0125-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/how-to-break-into-stand-up-comedy-801153\n |title=How to Break Into Stand-Up Comedy\n |last= Bromley\n |first=Patrick\n |date=6 June 2018\n |website=ThoughtCo.\n |publisher=Potdash\n |access-date=22 March 2019\n |quote=[Open mics] could be held anywhere, but are often found at bars, rock clubs, and coffee houses.\n}}</ref> They are also held in uncommon areas such as strip clubs<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7xdg9z/comedians-tell-us-the-most-epic-fails-theyve-seen-at-open-mics\n |title=Comedians Tell Us the Most Epic Fails They've Seen at Open Mics\n |last=Isador\n |first=Graham\n |date=2 May 2018\n |website=VICE\n |publisher=VICE MEDIA LLC\n |access-date=18 February 2019\n |quote=The worst open mic I ever attended was at Zanzibar, a strip club in downtown Toronto.}}</ref> and comic book shops.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bnpqa4/first-person-shooter-an-aspiring-stand-up-comic-shoots-empty-open-mics-across-nyc\n |title=An Aspiring Stand-Up Comic Shoots Empty Open Mics Across NYC\n |last=Master\n |first=Julian\n |date=2 April 2016\n |website=VICE\n |publisher=VICE MEDIA LLC\n |access-date=18 February 2019}}</ref> Such nights give newer or emerging comedians an opportunity to practice and improve,<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/tips-for-beginner-stand-up-comedians-801155\n |title=Breaking Into Stand-Up: 10 Tips for Beginner Comedians\n |last= Bromley\n |first=Patrick\n |date=13 April 2018\n |website=ThoughtCo.\n |publisher=Potdash\n |access-date=22 March 2019\n |quote=It's a true \u2018learn-by-doing\u2019 art form, and you won't know what works (and what doesn't) until you've gotten on stage in front of an audience.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.dispatch.com/entertainmentlife/20190321/budding-established-comedians-hone-craft-at-open-mic-nights\n |title=Budding, established comedians hone craft at open-mic nights\n |last=Lagatta\n |first=Eric\n |date=21 March 2019\n |website=The Columbus Dispatch\n |publisher=GateHouse Media, LLC.\u00a0\n |access-date=25 March 2019\n |quote=Most comedians see open-mic nights as a chance to test new material or refine their stage presence.}}</ref> with a view to getting paid work in the future.

A booked show is usually booked week in advance with some lottery spots selected by pulling candidates' names from a hat. With a regular open mic, a person puts their name on the list and they go on when their name is called by the host. With a \"bringer\" show, each performer has to bring a certain number of people (friends, family members, etc.) to get on stage. Open mic shows may have no cover charge, a reduced cover charge, or a minimum drink requirement. Open mic comedy nights are most widespread in larger English-speaking cities with a well-established stand-up comedy scene, especially [[London]] and [[New York City|New York]]. In these cities, with a plethora of aspiring comedians, the greatest challenge may be in attracting an audience.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n==Music==\n[[Image:Open Mic No Name Bar Sausalito CA July 2008.jpg|left|140px|thumb|A musician performs open mic at No Name Bar in [[Sausalito, California]].]]\nThese shows provide an opportunity for emerging musicians to gain experience performing to a live audience without having to go through the process of getting normal music gigs, which is very difficult to do without experience or a demo recording.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Open mics provide an outlet for [[singer-songwriter]]s. Prior to their popularity, the only outlet generally were [[folk clubs]], which were not always friendly towards creators of new music, preferring traditional, well-known music. They also suggested that music performed by [[acoustic music]]ians or solo artists in this manner would necessarily be folk music, a misconception that still commonly exists today. Some organizers have chosen the title \"acoustic night\" or \"acoustic club\" in an attempt to indicate an event run broadly on the lines of a folk club, but with a much wider range of musical styles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nOpen mic events are most commonly held in the middle of the week or at the very end of the weekend when footfall through venues is low. They rarely occur on the hallowed Friday and Saturday night time slots when venues are busy with weekend revellers and any live performance is usually specifically booked, professional artists. The most common night for a [[UK]] open mic event is Thursday, followed by Wednesday.<ref>{{cite web|title=Open Mic Finder Statistics|url=http://openmicfinder.co.uk/Statistics|work=Open Mic Finder Statistics|accessdate=23 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the largest ongoing open mic-styled music contest is [[Open Mic UK]], which regularly attracts 10,000 participants of all genres. The grand prize for the contest is an investment up to \u00a330,000. The size of the event has necessitated that all participants sign up for performance slots beforehand, instead of simply walking onstage.<ref name=\"tenwinners\">{{cite news\n|url=http://www.openmicuk.co.uk/national_vote\n|title=2010 Winners\n|publisher=[[Open Mic UK]]\n|accessdate=2011-05-12}}</ref><ref name=\"birdy\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/hampshire/content/articles/2008/12/06/birdy_ukidol_feature.shtml\n|title=Twleve year-old 'Birdy' wins UK talent contest\n|last=Almroth-Wright\n|first=Indy\n|date=December 6, 2008\n|publisher=[[BBC]] ([[Hampshire]])\n|accessdate=2011-04-15}}</ref>\n[[File:Open_mic_blues_night.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Open mic blue jam, 2015]]\nA popular open mic arrangement in the United States is the \"Blues Night\".  In this format a bar or club will dedicate a particular night, usually in the middle of the week, as being \"open mic blues night\".  The establishment may supply a [[house band]], typically guitar, bass and drums, sometimes a [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]]. Singers, guitarists, harmonica performers who wish to play sign up, usually with the master-of-ceremonies or host. This person is tasked with screening the performers, choosing and ordering, and getting the performers on and off stage in a polite manner.\n\nSince the songs chosen need to be simple enough so that a band of musicians who have not played together can perform them without practice, blues standards are used.  Songs might be announced as a \"12-bar fast shuffle in C\" or \"slow 12-bar blues in F\", or similar phrases, that should be familiar to all concerned. Lead singers, keyboards, horn players, (usually saxophones) and various percussion instruments are common additions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rayrayblues.com/bluesjams/|title=Phoenix Blues Jams|first=|last=rayray|website=www.rayrayblues.com}}</ref>\n\n==Strip club==\nIn most strip clubs, amateur night is a contest held by the clubs themselves where women and men compete for cash by stripping just like their stripper counterparts.<ref>[http://www.scorestampa.com/blog/2015/02/01/want-to-be-a-stripper]</ref><ref>[http://www.stripclubs-of-las-vegas.com/deja-vu-showgirls-strip-club-review.html]</ref>\n\n==Rarer niche variations==\nThe terms \"open deck\" (where ''deck'' refers to the kind of [[Phonograph|turntable]] used by a [[DJ]]) and \"open reel\" (where ''reel'' refers to a [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]] reel) are used for more niche open mic events where keen amateurs can meet to exhibit and [[critique]] their skills/artform. A decrease in the cost of consumer video technology combined with the powerful editing capabilities of modern PCs has caused an increase in the popularity of DJing and amateur filmmaking, but these types of events are still very rare.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Open Mic UK]] (music competition in the UK, 2008\u2013)\n*[[The Raving Poets]] (open mic poetry with live musical backing 2000\u20132010)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Aldredge, Marcus. \"[http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/abs/10.1525/si.2006.29.1.109?journalCode=si Negotiating and Practicing Performance: An Ethnographic Study of a Musical Open Mic in Brooklyn, New York.]\"\n* Aldredge, Marcus. 2013.
