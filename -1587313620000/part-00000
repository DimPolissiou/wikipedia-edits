Since his parents were never married, Van Gennep adopted his [[Dutch people|Dutch]] mother's [[maiden name|name]] \"[[Van (Dutch)|van]] [[Gennep]]\". When he was six, he and his mother moved to [[Lyons]], France, where she married a French doctor who moved the family to [[Savoy]].\n\nVan Gennep is best known for his work regarding [[Rite of passage|rites of passage]] ceremonies and his significant works in modern French folklore. He is recognized as the founder of [[folklore]] studies in [[France]].\n\nHe went to [[Paris]] to study at the [[Sorbonne]], but was disappointed that the school did not offer the subjects he wanted.  So he enrolled at the [[\u00c9cole des langues orientales]] to study [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and at the [[\u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes]] for philology, general linguistics, Egyptology, Ancient Arabic, primitive religions, and Islamic culture. This scholarly independence would manifest itself for the remainder of his life. He never held an academic position in France.\n\nFrom 1912 to 1915 he held the Chair of Ethnography at the [[University of Neuch\u00e2tel]] in [[Switzerland]] but was expelled for expressing doubts about the neutrality of Switzerland during World War I. There he reorganized the museum and organized the first ethnographic conference (1914). In 1922 he toured the United States.\n\nHis best-known work is ''Les rites de passage'' (The Rites of Passage, 1909) which includes his vision of rites of passage rituals as being divided into three phases: ''pr\u00e9liminaire'' 'preliminary',' ''liminaire'' '[[liminality]]' (a stage much studied by the anthropologist [[Victor Turner]]), and ''postliminaire'' 'post-liminality'.\n\nHis major work in French folklore was ''Le Manuel de folklore fran\u00e7ais contemporain'' (Handbook of Contemporary French Folklore, 1937\u20131958).\n\nHe died in 1957 in [[Bourg-la-Reine]], France.\n\n==Influences==\n*''The Rites of Passage'' was highly influential in the structuring of [[Joseph Campbell]]'s  1949 text, ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', as Campbell divides the journey of the hero into three parts, ''Departure'', ''Initiation,'' and ''Return''.\n* ''The Rites of Passage'' influenced anthropologist [[Victor Turner]]'s research, particularly his 1969 text, ''The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure''.\n\n==Works==\n* ''[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/12045100/ Le Tissage aux Cartons et son utilisation d\u00e9corative dans l'Egypte Ancienne]'', Neuchatel, Switzerland: Delachaux & Niestl\u00e9, 1916, co-author Gustave Jeqier.

Smith claimed to translate the original text of the plates into English; the book says that a portion of the text was written on the plates in \"[[reformed Egyptian]].\"\n\nThe Book of Mormon is said to have taken place somewhere in the Americas from c. 2500 BC to 400 AD, thus placing its events within the [[pre-Columbian era]].\n\nCritics claim that the book's origin lies firmly in the 19th century and that Smith created it with the resources available to him, including the [[King James Version]] (KJV) of the Bible.\n\nUnlike the Bible, no manuscripts in the supposed original language of the Book of Mormon are known to exist. No reformed Egyptian manuscripts or plates have ever been excavated by archaeologists. Critics and supporters disagree as to whether other archaeological findings support or disprove the historicity of the Book of Mormon. Some Mormon archaeologists and researchers claim various archaeological findings such as place names, and ruins of the [[Inca Empire|Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Olmec]], and other ancient American and Old World civilizations as giving credence to the Book of Mormon record.<ref>{{Harvnb|Priddis|1975}}; see [http://www.centerplace.org/hs/dc/rdc-110.htm RLDS D&C 110:20], were advanced by [[Community of Christ|RLDS]] members: {{Harvnb|Hills|1917}}; {{Harvnb|Hills|1918}}; {{Harvnb|Hills|1924}}, and {{Harvnb|Gunsolley|1922}}</ref>\n\n==Historical anachronisms==\n\n===Quoting Isaiah===\n{{further|Book of Isaiah}}\nBook of Mormon prophets quote chapters 48 through 54<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/1 |title=LDS chapter headings to the Book of Isaiah |publisher=churchofjesuschrist.org |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2012-06-11}}</ref> of the [[Book of Isaiah]] after having left [[Jerusalem]] around 600 BC. Since [[Isaiah]] died around 698 BC, under traditional biblical belief, there would be no conflict.

First, the terms barley and wheat, as used in the Book of Mormon, may refer to certain other New World crop plants that were given Old World designations; and second, the terms may refer to genuine varieties of New World barley and wheat. For example, the Spanish called the fruit of the prickly pear cactus a \"fig,\" and emigrants from England called maize \"corn,\" an English term referring to grains in general. A similar practice may have been employed when Book of Mormon people encountered New World plant species for the first time.<ref>Barley and Wheat in the Book Mormon, Robert R.

The seeds are edible, and this plant was part of the pre-Columbian [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]] of cultivated plants used by Native Americans.

Fifteen examples of distinct [[Mesoamerican writing systems|scripts]] have been identified in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, many from a single inscription.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Macri |first1=Martha J. |title=\"Maya and Other Mesoamerican Scripts,\" in The World's Writing Systems |date=1996 |publisher=Oxford |location=England |pages=172\u2013182}}</ref>  Archaeological dating methods make it difficult to establish which was earliest (and hence the forebear from which the others developed) and a significant portion of the documented scripts have not been deciphered. None of the documented [[Mesoamerican languages|Mesoamerican language]] scripts have any relation to Hebrew or Egyptian. The Book of Mormon describes another literate culture, the [[Jaredites]], but does not identify the language or writing system by name. The text that describes the Jaredites ([[Book of Ether]]) refers only to a language used prior to the alleged confounding of languages at the great tower, presumably a reference to the [[Tower of Babel]].\n\nLinguistic studies on the evolution of the spoken languages of the Americas agree with the widely held model that the initial [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|colonization of the Americas]] by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' occurred over 10,000 years ago.<ref>Lyle Campbell, ''American Indian Languages, The Historical Linguistics of Native America'' (1997, Oxford)</ref>\n\n[[FairMormon]] apologists argue that the Book of Mormon does not describe all of the original settlers of the Americas, but rather a subset of the larger population, who settled in a limited geographical setting. Thus, their language and writing may have had little to no impact on the culture of the rest of the population.<ref>{{cite web \n | url = http://en.fairmormon.org/Book_of_Mormon/Anachronisms/Language/Hebrew_and_Native_American_languages\n | title = Hebrew and Native American languages\n}}</ref>\n\n===\"Christ\" and \"Messiah\"===\nThe words \"Christ\" and \"Messiah\" are used several hundred times throughout the Book of Mormon.<ref>The word \"Christ\" is used 99 times, and the word \"Messiah\" is used 13 times.</ref> The first instance of the word \"Christ\" in the Book of Mormon dates to between 559 and 545 BC.<ref>See 2 Nephi 10:3</ref> The first instance of the word \"Messiah\" dates to about 600 BC.<ref>1 Nephi 1:19.</ref>\n\n\"[[Christ]]\" is the English transliteration of the Greek word \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 (transliterated precisely as Christ\u00f3s); it is relatively synonymous with the Hebrew word rendered \"[[Messiah]]\" ({{Hebrew Name|\u05de\u05b8\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05d7\u05b7|Mashia\u1e96|M\u0101\u0161\u00ee\u0103\u1e25}}).

In the vast majority of cases, it uses the terms in an identical manner as the Bible, where it does not matter which word is used:\n<blockquote>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|version=1981|book=Helaman|chapter=5|verse=12}}).</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>And after he had baptized the Messiah with water, he should behold and bear record that he had baptized the Lamb of God, who should take away the sins of the world.\" ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|version=1981|book=1 Nephi|chapter=10|verse=10}}).</blockquote>\n\nThe Book of Mormon occasionally uses the word \"Christ\" in a way that is not interchangeable with \"Messiah\". For example in {{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|version=1981|book=2 Nephi|chapter=10|verse=3}}, the Book of Mormon prophet [[Jacob (Book of Mormon prophet)|Jacob]] says an [[angel]] informed him that the name of the Messiah would be Christ:<blockquote>Wherefore, as I said unto you, it must needs be expedient that Christ&mdash;for in the last night the angel spake unto me that this should be his name&mdash;should come among the Jews ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|version=1981|book=2 Nephi|chapter=10|verse=3}})</blockquote> The word \"Messiah\" is used in the text before this point, but from this point on the word \"Christ\" is used almost exclusively.\n\nRichard Packham argues that the Greek word \"Christ\" in the Book of Mormon challenges the authenticity of the work since Joseph Smith clearly stated that, \"There was no Greek or Latin upon the plates from which I, through the grace of the Lord, translated the Book of Mormon.\"<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://packham.n4m.org/linguist.htm\n | title = A Linguist Looks at Mormonism\n | last = Packham\n | first = Richard\n | date = April 20, 2003 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research]] states that the word \"Christ\" is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word \"Messiah\" and that Smith simply chose the more familiar Greek word to translate the word that appeared in the language of the plates.<ref>{{cite web | title = Book of Mormon Anachronisms: Pre-Christian Christianity | url = http://en.fairmormon.org/Book_of_Mormon/Anachronisms/Pre-Christian_Christianity | accessdate = November 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Hugh Nibley]] postulated that the word \"Messiah\" could have been derived from Arabic rather than Hebrew,<ref>[[Hugh Nibley]], ''Since Cumorah'', pp. 167-68, discusses the origin, interchangeability, and translated use of the terms \"Messiah\" and \"Christ\" as they appear in scripture. Nibley points out that the Arabic word ''al-masih'', for instance, could be translated using the Hebrew term \"Messiah\" or the New Testament term \"Christ\" depending on the context and translator.

One explanation has been offered by Stephen D. Ricks. Writing in [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|the LDS magazine Ensign]] he said that though the language of the [[Mulekite]]s is not put forward in the Book of Mormon, the party could have included Phoenicians who had regular contact with the Greeks or perhaps some Greek sailor or traders were also in the initial group.  In addition, Greek names have occurred as loan names in ancient Hebrew.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ricks |first1=Stephen D. |title=The name of one of the Lord's disciples listed in 3 Nephi 19:4\u2014Timothy\u2014seems to be Greek in origin.

The meaning of the word \"church\" in the Book of Mormon is more comparable to usage in the KJV than modern English. The concept of a church, meaning ''a convocation of believers'', existed among the [[House of Israel]] prior to Christianity. For instance, [[Psalms]] {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Psalms|nobook=|chapter=89|verse=5}} speaks of praising the Lord \"in the congregation of the saints\"; the Septuagint contains the Greek word \"ecclesia\" for \"congregation,\" which is also translated as \"church\" in the New Testament<!--this is easily accessible in any septuagint... do we really need a link to a specific edition here?-->. The Book of Mormon using the word \"church\" in the same \"style\" as the KJV is seen by some apologists as support for the Book of Mormon.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nA similar question regards the word \"synagogue,\" found in Alma 16:13:<blockquote>And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching repentance to the people in their temples, and in their sanctuaries, and also in their synagogues, which were built after the manner of the Jews ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|version=1981|book=Alma|chapter=16|verse=13}}).</blockquote>\n\nScholars note that [[synagogue]]s did not exist in their modern form before the destruction of the temple and the [[Babylonian captivity]].

Apologists assert that it is potentially a hypocoristicon from Samuel representing the common Semitic vocable ''\u0161m'' and would most likely mean \u201cthe name,\u201d \u201cName,\u201d or even \u201cdescendant/offspring\" among other Near Eastern linguistic possibilities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sam |url=https://onoma.lib.byu.edu/index.php/SAM#cite_note-5 |website=The Book of Mormon Onomasticon |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref> Gee, Roper and Tvedtnes report that the name \"Sam\" is found on a bronze ringmounted seal dated in the 7th century B.C.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Avigad |first1=Nahman |last2=Sass |first2=Benjamin |title=Corpus of West Semitic Stamp Seals |date=1997 |publisher=Institute of Archaeology, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem |location=Jerusalem, Israel |isbn=978-9652081384 |page=69}}</ref> They also note that the name \"Samuel\" in Hebrew is a combination of two words\u2014''Shem'' and ''El''. In early Hebrew, the same letter was used for \"s\" and \"sh\" and vowels were not specified. Judges 12:6 demonstrates that the [[tribe of Joseph]] pronounced the letter that Shem began with as \"s\".\n\n===\"Adieu\"===\nThe [[French language|French]] word \"adieu\" appears once in the Book of Mormon, in Jacob 7:27.\n\nSupporters of the Book of Mormon argue that the text is a translation into modern English, so the use of a French word is not amiss.  For example, [[Daniel H. Ludlow]] contends that it may have been the result of Joseph Smith choosing the best word available to convey the meaning of the original text.<ref>Daniel H. Ludlow, A Companion to Your Study of the Book of Mormon, p. 163</ref> The word is found in the 1828 Webster's Dictionary so was considered an English word at the time of the Book of Mormon translation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Webster |first1=Noah |title=Adieu |url=http://webstersdictionary1828.com/Dictionary/Adieu  |website=Webster's Dictionary 1828 |access-date=2019-03-28}}</ref>\n\n==Anachronisms apparently perpetuated from King James's translation==\n{{See also|The Book of Mormon and the King James Bible}}\nA significant portion of the Book of Mormon quotes from the [[brass plates]], which purport to be another source of Old Testament writings mirroring those of the Bible. In many cases, the biblical quotations in the English-language Book of Mormon, are close, or identical to the equivalent sections of the KJV. Critics consider several Book of Mormon anachronisms to originate in the KJV.\n\n===\"Satyr\"===\nIn 2 Nephi 23:21, the Book of Mormon quotes Isaiah 13:21, which mentions a \"satyr\".

Smith claimed to translate the original text of the plates into English; the book says that a portion of the text was written on the plates in \"[[reformed Egyptian]].\"\n\nThe Book of Mormon is said to have taken place somewhere in the Americas from c. 2500 BC to 400 AD, thus placing its events within the [[pre-Columbian era]].\n\nCritics claim that the book's origin lies firmly in the 19th century and that Smith created it with the resources available to him, including the [[King James Version]] (KJV) of the Bible.\n\nUnlike the Bible, no manuscripts in the supposed original language of the Book of Mormon are known to exist. No reformed Egyptian manuscripts or plates have ever been excavated by archaeologists. Critics and supporters disagree as to whether other archaeological findings support or disprove the historicity of the Book of Mormon. Some Mormon archaeologists and researchers claim various archaeological findings such as place names, and ruins of the [[Inca Empire|Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Olmec]], and other ancient American and Old World civilizations as giving credence to the Book of Mormon record.<ref>{{Harvnb|Priddis|1975}}; see [http://www.centerplace.org/hs/dc/rdc-110.htm RLDS D&C 110:20], were advanced by [[Community of Christ|RLDS]] members: {{Harvnb|Hills|1917}}; {{Harvnb|Hills|1918}}; {{Harvnb|Hills|1924}}, and {{Harvnb|Gunsolley|1922}}</ref>\n\n==Historical anachronisms==\n\n===Quoting Isaiah===\n{{further|Book of Isaiah}}\nBook of Mormon prophets quote chapters 48 through 54<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/1 |title=LDS chapter headings to the Book of Isaiah |publisher=churchofjesuschrist.org |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2012-06-11}}</ref> of the [[Book of Isaiah]] after having left [[Jerusalem]] around 600 BC.

The seeds are edible, and this plant was part of the pre-Columbian [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]] of cultivated plants used by Native Americans.

The compass is widely recognized to have been invented in China around 1100 AD, and remains of a compass have never been found in America. In the [[Book of Alma]], [[Alma the Younger|Alma]] explains to his son that \"our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass\".<ref name=\"auto\">{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|version=1981|book=Alma|chapter=37|verse=38}}</ref>\n\nApologists counter that Liahona was, according to the narrative, created by God,<ref name=\"auto\"/> and not by the Nephites. Also, unlike a normal compass, the Book of Mormon says that there was also writing on the ball that displayed instructions from God,<ref>{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|version=1981|book=1 Nephi|chapter=16|verse=26|range=-29}}</ref> and there was no mention of any part of it pointing to a geographic point.

However, while pre-Columbian tribes used metal, often beaten, there is no accepted evidence of high-temperature melting. The word \"dross\" appears twice in the [[Book of Alma]].

None of the documented [[Mesoamerican languages|Mesoamerican language]] scripts have any relation to Hebrew or Egyptian. The Book of Mormon describes another literate culture, the [[Jaredites]], but does not identify the language or writing system by name. The text that describes the Jaredites ([[Book of Ether]]) refers only to a language used prior to the alleged confounding of languages at the great tower, presumably a reference to the [[Tower of Babel]].\n\nLinguistic studies on the evolution of the spoken languages of the Americas agree with the widely held model that the initial [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|colonization of the Americas]] by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' occurred over 10,000 years ago.<ref>Lyle Campbell, ''American Indian Languages, The Historical Linguistics of Native America'' (1997, Oxford)</ref>\n\n[[FairMormon]] apologists argue that the Book of Mormon does not describe all of the original settlers of the Americas, but rather a subset of the larger population, who settled in a limited geographical setting.

See also \"Meshiach\" (\u05de\u05b8\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05d7\u05b7), \"anointed\", Hebrew-Aramaic Lexicon</ref> although Arabic is not mentioned as one of the languages in which the golden plates were written.\n\n===Greek names===\nJoseph Smith stated in a letter to the editor of ''[[Times and Seasons]]'', \"There was no Greek or Latin upon the plates from which I, through the grace of the Lord, translated the Book of Mormon.\"<ref name=autogenerated3>''[[Times and Seasons]]'', vol.4, no.13, May 15, 1843, p. 194</ref> The Book of Mormon contains some names which appear to be [[Greek language|Greek]], some of which are [[Hellenization]]s of Hebrew names (e.g. Antipas, Archeantus, Esrom, Ezias, Jonas, Judea, Lachoneus and Zenos).\n\nOther Greek names are non-biblical and their presence in the book is puzzling to both believers and skeptics, since neither Smith nor the Nephites spoke Greek. One explanation has been offered by Stephen D. Ricks. Writing in [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|the LDS magazine Ensign]] he said that though the language of the [[Mulekite]]s is not put forward in the Book of Mormon, the party could have included Phoenicians who had regular contact with the Greeks or perhaps some Greek sailor or traders were also in the initial group.  In addition, Greek names have occurred as loan names in ancient Hebrew.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ricks |first1=Stephen D. |title=The name of one of the Lord's disciples listed in 3 Nephi 19:4\u2014Timothy\u2014seems to be Greek in origin. Is there an explanation for the appearance of a Greek name in the Book of Mormon? |journal=Ensign |date=October 1992 |volume=22 |issue=10 |pages=53\u201354 |url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1992/10/i-have-a-question/is-there-an-explanation-for-the-appearance-of-a-greek-name-in-the-book-of-mormon?lang=eng |accessdate=3 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===\"Church\" and \"synagogue\"===\nThe word \"church\" first occurs in 1 Nephi 4:26, where a prophet named Nephi disguises himself as Laban, a prominent man in Jerusalem whom Nephi had slain:<blockquote>And he [Laban's servant], supposing that I spake of the brethren of the church, and that I was truly that Laban whom I had slain, wherefore he did follow me ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|version=1981|book=1 Nephi|chapter=4|verse=26}}).</blockquote>\n\nAccording to the Book of Mormon, this exchange happened in Jerusalem, around 600 BC. The meaning of the word \"church\" in the Book of Mormon is more comparable to usage in the KJV than modern English. The concept of a church, meaning ''a convocation of believers'', existed among the [[House of Israel]] prior to Christianity. For instance, [[Psalms]] {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Psalms|nobook=|chapter=89|verse=5}} speaks of praising the Lord \"in the congregation of the saints\"; the Septuagint contains the Greek word \"ecclesia\" for \"congregation,\" which is also translated as \"church\" in the New Testament<!--this is easily accessible in any septuagint... do we really need a link to a specific edition here?-->. The Book of Mormon using the word \"church\" in the same \"style\" as the KJV is seen by some apologists as support for the Book of Mormon.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nA similar question regards the word \"synagogue,\" found in Alma 16:13:<blockquote>And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching repentance to the people in their temples, and in their sanctuaries, and also in their synagogues, which were built after the manner of the Jews ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|version=1981|book=Alma|chapter=16|verse=13}}).</blockquote>\n\nScholars note that [[synagogue]]s did not exist in their modern form before the destruction of the temple and the [[Babylonian captivity]]. The oldest known synagogue is located in Delos, Greece, and has been dated to 150 BC.<ref>The Oldest Original Synagogue Building in the Diaspora: The Delos Synagogue Reconsidered,\" ''Monika Tr\u00fcmper Hesperia'', Vol. 73, No. 4 (Oct.\u2013Dec., 2004), pp. 513-98</ref>  References to synagogues have been found in Egypt as early as the 3rd Century BC.<ref name=\"pohick2\">{{cite web |author=Donald D. Binder |url=http://www.pohick.org/sts/egypt.html |title=Egypt}}</ref>\n\n===The Name \"Sam\" as an anachronism===\nCritics [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] and Marvin W. Cowan contend that certain linguistic properties of the Book of Mormon provide evidence that the book was fabricated by Joseph Smith.<ref>\n{{cite book|\ntitle=The New Mormon Challenge|\npublisher=Zondervan|\nyear=2002|\nisbn=978-0-310-23194-3|\nfirst=Francis|last=Beckwith|\npages=367\u2013396\n}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite book|\ntitle=Mormon Claims Answered|\nyear=1997|\nisbn=|\nfirst=Marvin|last=Cowan|\npage=\n}}</ref>\nThese critics cite as a linguistic [[anachronism]] the Americanized name \"Sam\" (1 Nephi 2:5,17). Apologists assert that it is potentially a hypocoristicon from Samuel representing the common Semitic vocable ''\u0161m'' and would most likely mean \u201cthe name,\u201d \u201cName,\u201d or even \u201cdescendant/offspring\" among other Near Eastern linguistic possibilities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sam |url=https://onoma.lib.byu.edu/index.php/SAM#cite_note-5 |website=The Book of Mormon Onomasticon |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref> Gee, Roper and Tvedtnes report that the name \"Sam\" is found on a bronze ringmounted seal dated in the 7th century B.C.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Avigad |first1=Nahman |last2=Sass |first2=Benjamin |title=Corpus of West Semitic Stamp Seals |date=1997 |publisher=Institute of Archaeology, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem |location=Jerusalem, Israel |isbn=978-9652081384 |page=69}}</ref> They also note that the name \"Samuel\" in Hebrew is a combination of two words\u2014''Shem'' and ''El''. In early Hebrew, the same letter was used for \"s\" and \"sh\" and vowels were not specified. Judges 12:6 demonstrates that the [[tribe of Joseph]] pronounced the letter that Shem began with as \"s\".\n\n===\"Adieu\"===\nThe [[French language|French]] word \"adieu\" appears once in the Book of Mormon, in Jacob 7:27.\n\nSupporters of the Book of Mormon argue that the text is a translation into modern English, so the use of a French word is not amiss.  For example, [[Daniel H. Ludlow]] contends that it may have been the result of Joseph Smith choosing the best word available to convey the meaning of the original text.<ref>Daniel H. Ludlow, A Companion to Your Study of the Book of Mormon, p. 163</ref> The word is found in the 1828 Webster's Dictionary so was considered an English word at the time of the Book of Mormon translation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Webster |first1=Noah |title=Adieu |url=http://webstersdictionary1828.com/Dictionary/Adieu  |website=Webster's Dictionary 1828 |access-date=2019-03-28}}</ref>\n\n==Anachronisms apparently perpetuated from King James's translation==\n{{See also|The Book of Mormon and the King James Bible}}\nA significant portion of the Book of Mormon quotes from the [[brass plates]], which purport to be another source of Old Testament writings mirroring those of the Bible. In many cases, the biblical quotations in the English-language Book of Mormon, are close, or identical to the equivalent sections of the KJV. Critics consider several Book of Mormon anachronisms to originate in the KJV.\n\n===\"Satyr\"===\nIn 2 Nephi 23:21, the Book of Mormon quotes Isaiah 13:21, which mentions a \"satyr\". [[Satyr]]s are creatures from [[Greek mythology]], which are half-man, half-goat. The KJV translates Isaiah 34:14 thus:\n\n:The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.

It is the art of making him feel that somewhere, somehow he has become less than you \u2013 less desirable, less worthy \u2013 less blessed.<ref name = sim/>}} Palfrey is given an object lesson in this when he has his interview with Potter, who proceeds to win a name-calling game. When Palfrey explains that he is a failure, Potter surmises that a woman is involved. In [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], Palfrey recounts how he first met April Smith ([[Janette Scott]]), knocking parcels from her hands when he rushes to catch a bus. He manages to arrange a dinner date with her.\n\nWhen Palfrey shows up at work, his loafing employees are unconcerned, despite his being the head of the family firm. They pay much more respect to his senior clerk, Gloatbridge ([[Edward Chapman (actor)|Edward Chapman]]). In private, Gloatbridge is patronising toward his erstwhile boss, making the business decisions. Palfrey asks him to make a dinner reservation, and has to fend off Gloatbridge's unwanted restaurant suggestion. \n\nThat night at the restaurant, the head waiter ([[John Le Mesurier]]) cannot find Palfrey's booking at first; he does finally locate it under a slightly different name, but still refuses to seat them, as they are late. When Raymond Delauney ([[Terry-Thomas]]), a casual acquaintance of Palfrey's, arrives and sees April, he invites them to his table, where he proceeds to try to seduce April and cast Palfrey in a bad light at every opportunity.\n\nAs Delauney has a fancy sports car, Palfrey tries to counter by purchasing an automobile of his own. However, two salesmen ([[Dennis Price]] and [[Peter Jones (actor)|Peter Jones]]) sell him a ramshackle 1924 \"Swiftmobile\". To further his humiliation of his rival, Delauney suggests a \"friendly\" [[tennis]] match; he wins easily. The film then returns to the school. Over the next several weeks, Palfrey proves to be an apt pupil in learning various ploys to gain the upper hand. The next phase of his education involves a field test of his new skills, evaluated by Potter. Palfrey convinces the car salesmen that his car, after some tune-up, is now a valuable and sought-after vehicle. They trade him a sports car and 100 guineas (\u00a3105) for his Swiftmobile, which promptly breaks down.\n\nAfter putting Gloatbridge in his place, Palfrey challenges Delauney to a rematch. Using some stratagems, he thoroughly frustrates his foe before they even start playing. Then, with April watching, Palfrey proceeds to win the set 6-0. April becomes disgusted with Delauney's behaviour afterward and drives off with Palfrey. They go back to his place for a drink. \n\nPalfrey arranges for April's scotch and soda to spill on her dress. He suggests she take it off to dry and put on his dressing gown. Eventually, they end up in his bedroom through his tricks, but Palfrey cannot bring himself to take advantage of April. Then Delauney barges in, dragging Potter with him. Delauney had found out that Potter was Palfrey's guest at the tennis club and got the story out of him. However, after Delauney informs her, April realises that Palfrey genuinely loves her, and they embrace, much to the disgust of both Delauney and Potter. Potter breaks the \"[[fourth wall]]\" and apologises to the audience for his pupil's behaviour.\n\nThe film ends with Delauney getting off the train at [[Yeovil]] station and heading in the direction of the school.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ian Carmichael]] as Henry Palfrey\n* [[Terry-Thomas]] as Raymond Delauney\n* [[Alastair Sim]] as Mr. S.

This woman's name was [[Hababah (slave)|Hababah]] and she predeceased Yazid.<ref>al-Tabari v. 24, p.&nbsp;196</ref> It is said that, while feasting with [[Hababah (slave)|Hababah]], Yazid threw a grape into her mouth, on which she choked and died in his arms.

The palaces are conventionally held to have been built during his caliphate, though a number of archaeologists suggest Yazid began their construction before 720.{{sfn|Bacharach|1996|p=36}}\n\n==Reign==\n===Accession===\nBy dint of his descent, Yazid was a natural candidate for the succession to the caliphate.{{sfn|Lammens|Blankinship|2002|p=311}} A noble Arab maternal lineage held political weight during this period in the Caliphate's history,{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=312, note 1}} and Yazid took pride in his maternal Sufyanid descent, viewing himself superior to his Marwanid brothers.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=312}} He was chosen by his paternal half-brother Caliph [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik|Sulayman]] ({{reign|715|717}}) as the second-in-line for the caliphate after their first cousin [[Umar II]], who ruled from 717 to 720.{{sfn|Lammens|Blankinship|2002|p=311}} Yazid acceded at the age of 29 following the death of Umar II on 9 February 720.{{sfn|Lammens|Blankinship|2002|p=311}}{{sfn|Powers|1989|p=105}} For much of his reign, he resided in Damascus or his estates in [[Jund al-Urdunn]] (the military district of Jordan),{{sfn|Lammens|Blankinship|2002|p=311}} which was centered in [[Tiberias]] and roughly corresponded with the Byzantine province of [[Palaestina Secunda]].{{sfn|Cobb|2000|p=882}}\n\n===Suppression of Muhallabids===\n[[File:Dihram of Yazid II, 721-722.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Silver [[dirham]] of Yazid II, minted in 721/22]]\n\nShortly before or immediately after Yazid's accession, the veteran commander and disgraced governor of Iraq and the vast eastern province of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], [[Yazid ibn al-Muhallab]], escaped from the fortress of [[Aleppo]] where Umar II had him imprisoned.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=313}}{{sfn|Powers|1989|p=80, note 287}} During Sulayman's reign, Ibn al-Muhallab, an enemy of al-Hajjaj, had been responsible for the torture and deaths of members of al-Hajjaj's family, Yazid's in-laws, and feared retaliatory maltreatment when Yazid's accession became apparent.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=313}} Yazid had long held suspicions, nurtured by al-Hajjaj, of Ibn al-Muhallab's and the [[Muhallabids|Muhallabid]] family's influence and ambitions in Iraq and the eastern Caliphate.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=322}} \n\nEvading the pursuit of Umar's or Yazid's commanders, Ibn al-Muhallab made his way to [[Basra]], the center of his family and [[Azd|Azd Uman]] tribe.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=313}} On Yazid's orders Basra's governor [[Adi ibn Artah al-Fazari|Adi ibn Artat al-Fazari]] arrested many of Ibn al-Muhallab's brothers and cousins before his arrival to the city.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=313}}{{sfn|Powers|1989|p=112}} Ibn Artat was unable to stop Ibn al-Muhallab's entry and the latter, with support from his Yamani tribal allies in the Basra garrison, besieged Ibn Artat in the city's citadel.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=313}} The Qays\u2013Mudar factions of the garrison, though [[Qays\u2013Yaman rivalry|traditional rivals of the Yaman]] and unsympathetic to Ibn al-Muhallab, did not actively or effectively oppose him.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=314}} Ibn al-Muhallab seized the citadel, captured the governor and established control over Basra.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=314}} Yazid pardoned him, but Ibn al-Muhallab continued his opposition, declaring a [[jihad|holy war]] (''jih\u0101d'') against the caliph and the Syrian troops who effectively served as the enforcers of Umayyad authority in Iraq.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=314}} Umar II had likely withdrawn most of the Syrians from [[Wasit]], their main Iraqi garrison, and Ibn al-Muhallab was able to capture the city with relative ease.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=313, 316}} Most of the pious [[Qur'an]] readers and the ''[[mawla|maw\u0101l\u012b]]'' (non-Arab Muslim converts) of Basra supported Ibn al-Muhallab's cause, with the exception of the prominent scholar [[al-Hasan al-Basri]].{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=314\u2013315}} The dependent districts of Basra, namely [[Ahwaz]], [[Pars (Sasanian province)|Fars]] and [[Kerman]], joined the revolt, though not Khurasan, where Qays\u2013Mudar troops counterbalanced the pro-Muhallabid Yamani faction in the province's garrisons.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=315\u2013316}} \n\nIbn al-Muhallab advanced toward [[Kufa]], the other main garrison center of Iraq, where he attracted support across the tribal spectrum and among many of its noble Arab households.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=316\u2013317}} In the meantime, Yazid dispatched his kinsmen, the veteran commanders [[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik]] and [[al-Abbas ibn al-Walid]], to suppress the revolt.{{sfn|Powers|1989|p=127}} They killed Ibn al-Muhallab and routed his army near Kufa on 24 August 720.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=318}} Yazid ordered the executions of the roughly two hundred prisoners-of-war captured from Ibn al-Muhallab's camp, while Ibn al-Muhallab's son Mu'awiya ordered the execution of Ibn Artat and his thirty supporters incarcerated in Wasit.{{sfn|Powers|1989|pp=140\u2013141}} Afterward, the Umayyad authorities pursued and killed many of the Muhallabids, including nine to fourteen boys who were sent to Yazid and executed by his order.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=318\u2013319}}{{sfn|Powers|1989|pp=144\u2013146}}\n\n====Escalation of Qays\u2013Yaman factionalism====\n{{see also|Qays\u2013Yaman rivalry}}\n\nThe Muhallabid revolt's suppression marked the last of the great anti-Umayyad uprisings in Iraq.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=108}} The defeat of the Muhallabids and Yazid's successive appointments to the governorship of Iraq of Maslama\u2014who was shortly dismissed for not forwarding the provincial tax surplus to the caliph's treasury\u2014and Maslama's lieutenant [[Umar ibn Hubayra al-Fazari]] signaled a triumph for the Qays\u2013Mudar faction in the province and its eastern dependencies.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=319\u2013320}} According to the historian [[Julius Wellhausen]], \"the proscription of the whole of the prominent and powerful [Muhallabid] family, a measure hitherto unheard of in the history of the Umaiyids [sic], came like a declaration of war against the Yemen [faction] in general, and the corollary was that the government was degenerating into a Qaisite party-rule\".{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=322}} Wellhausen blames the caliph for the escalation of factionalism and attributed the appointment of Ibn Hubayra to his own desire for revenge against the Muhallabids' Yamani backers.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=322}} The Yamani-affiliated tribes of Khurasan viewed the events as a humiliation and during the [[Abbasid Revolution]] which toppled the Umayyads in 750 they adopted as one of their slogans \"revenge for the Banu Muhallab [Muhallabids]\".{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=76}} \n\nThe orientalist [[Henri Lammens]] considers Yazid's portrayal as \"a pro-Mudar and anti-Yaman extremist\" as \"unfair, as he actually tried to balance the conflicting groups, just as other Umayyad rulers did\".{{sfn|Lammens|Blankinship|2002|p=311}} Yazid did not champion the Qays over the [[Quda'a]], a major component of the Yaman confederation in Syria.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=322}} Indeed, members of the Quda'a's principal tribe, the [[Banu Kalb]], had formed the core of the caliph's army during the suppression, pursuit and elimination of the Muhallabids.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=322}} He appointed Yamani governors to the large provinces of [[Ifriqiya]] (North Africa west of Egypt) and the [[Upper Mesopotamia|Jazira]] (Upper Mesopotamia) and its dependent districts of [[Adharbayjan]] and [[Arminiya|Armenia]].{{sfn|Lammens|Blankinship|2002|p=311}}\n\n===Fiscal and military policies===\nThe expenses of enforcing Umayyad rule in Iraq and the expansionist war efforts along multiple fronts, including the enormous cost of the failed [[Siege of Constantinople (717\u2013718)|sieges of Constantinople in 717\u2013718]], had erased much of the monetary gains from the conquests of [[Transoxiana]], [[Arab Sind|Sind]] and the Iberian Peninsula under al-Walid I and caused a financial crisis in the Caliphate.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=84\u201385}} Among the solutions of Yazid's predecessor to the fiscal burden were the withdrawal of the Syrians from Iraq, a halt on conquests and near elimination of grants to Umayyad princes, as well as an unrealized goal to withdraw Arab troops altogether from Transoxiana, the Iberian Peninsula and [[Cilicia]].{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=84\u201385}} The most significant reforms of Umar II granted equality to the ''maw\u0101l\u012b'' in Khurasan, Sind, Ifriqiya and the Iberian Peninsula by abolishing the ''[[jizya]]'', the [[poll tax]] traditionally exacted on non-Muslim subjects but in practice extended to non-Arab Muslim converts, and instituting equal pay for ''maw\u0101l\u012b'' in the ranks of the Caliphate's Arab-dominated armies.{{sfn|Lammens|Blankinship|2002|p=311}}{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=86}} According to Blankinship, the reforms favoring the ''maw\u0101l\u012b'' may have been guided by Umar II's piety, but also a fiscal consideration: if equal treatment with the Arabs made the government popular with the ''maw\u0101l\u012b'' it could translate into delegating an increased security role for the ''maw\u0101l\u012b'' in their native provinces and their enthusiastic defense of the Caliphate's frontiers, thereby reducing the expense of deploying and garrisoning Arab troops.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nYazid attempted to reverse, with limited success, the reforms of Umar II, which were opposed by the Arab militarist camp in the Caliphate and the Umayyad ruling family.{{sfn|Lammens|Blankinship|2002|p=311}} During Umar II's rule the militarist camp led by Maslama may have accepted a temporary pause in activity to recover from the Constantinople debacle.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=86\u201387}} Under Yazid, Maslama and his proteges, including Ibn Hubayra, were restored or appointed to senior commands, Syrian garrisons were reintroduced to Iraq, the traditional annual raids against the Byzantines and the [[Arab\u2013Khazar wars|war with the Khazars]] were restarted, and the grants of estates or generous sums to Umayyad princes resumed.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=87}} Although Yazid's policies were presumably meant to gain the backing of the ruling elite and restore the flow of war spoils, they proved insufficient to finance the Caliphate's troops, particularly as booty had become increasingly difficult to obtain by the Arab expeditionary forces.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=87}}\n\nTo fill the depleted coffers of the caliphal treasury Yazid turned to the fifth of provincial tax revenues officially owed to the caliph. Historically, the provinces neglected to forward the revenues if political conditions allowed and governors often pilfered such funds. To ensure the flow of revenues to the treasury, Yazid appointed governors based on the example set by al-Hajjaj, i.e. upright, meticulously loyal and ruthless in the collection of taxes.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=87}} Unlike the era of al-Hajjaj, however, Yazid applied this principle for the first time to Ifriqiya, Khurasan, Sind and the Iberian Peninsula.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=87}} A major aspect of his policy was the reinstatement of the ''jizya'' on the ''maw\u0101l\u012b'',{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=87}} which alienated the ''maw\u0101l\u012b'' in the aforementioned provinces.{{sfn|Lammens|Blankinship|2002|p=311}} \n\nIn Ifriqiya, the caliph's governor [[Yazid ibn Abi Muslim]], himself a ''mawl\u0101'' from Iraq and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of al-Hajjaj, was assassinated by his [[Berbers|Berber]] guard in 720, shortly after his appointment, for attempting to reinstate the ''jizya''.{{sfn|Lammens|Blankinship|2002|p=311}} Many, if not most, Berbers had embraced Islam and commanded a strong position in the army unlike  ''maw\u0101l\u012b'' in other parts of the Caliphate.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=87\u201388}} The Berbers reinstalled Ibn Abi Muslim's predecessor [[Ismail ibn Abd Allah ibn Abi al-Muhajir]] and notified Yazid, who approved the change.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=323}} The incident in Ifriqiya was a blow to the Caliphate's prestige in North Africa and served as a harbinger for the [[Berber Revolt]] in 740\u2013743.{{sfn|Lammens|Blankinship|2002|p=311}} The reinstatement of the ''jizya'' in Khurasan in 721/22 by Ibn Hubayra's deputy [[Sa'id ibn Amr al-Harashi]] led to revolts and wars in the province that continued for twenty years and partly contributed to the Abbasid Revolution.{{sfn|Lammens|Blankinship|2002|p=311}} In Egypt pay increases to the indigenous ''maw\u0101l\u012b'' sailors of the Muslim fleet were reversed.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=87}}\n\nAnti-Umayyad groups began to gain power among the disaffected. Al-Tabari records that [[Abbasids]] were promoting their cause in A.H. 102 (720-721 CE). They were already building a power base that they would later use to topple the Umayyads in 750 CE. \n\nThat same year Yazid's governor in [[Medina]], [['Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri|Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Dahhak]], incurred the caliph's displeasure because the governor was exerting undue pressure trying to force a woman to marry him. She appealed to Yazid who replaced Abd al-Rahman with Abd al-Walid ibn Abdallah.{{sfn|Powers|1989|pp=180ff.}}\n\n===War against the Khazars===\nIn March 722 the Syrian army of Yazid's governor in Armenia and Adharbayjan, [[Mi'laq ibn Saffar al-Bahrani]], was routed by the [[Khazar Khaganate|Khazars]] in Armenia, south of the [[Caucasus]]. The defeat marked the culmination of the Caliphate's winter campaign against the Khazars and resulted in considerable Syrian losses.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=121\u2013122}} To avenge this defeat, Yazid II sent [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah]] at the head of a 25,000-strong army of Syrians, who pushed into the Caucasus homeland of the Khazars and took their capital of [[Balanjar]] on 22 August.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=122}} The main body of the highly mobile Khazars avoided the Muslims' pursuit and their presence compelled al-Jarrah to withdraw to Warthan south of the Caucasus and request reinforcements of from Yazid.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=122}} In 723 he led another raid north of Balanjar, but made no remarkable gains.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=122}}\n\n===Iconoclastic edict===\nAccording to Greek sources, including Patriarch [[John V of Jerusalem]] (d. 735), [[Theophanes the Confessor]] (d. 818) and Patriarch [[Nikephoros I of Constantinople]] (d. 828), Yazid issued an edict ordering the destruction of all [[icon]]s in Christian churches across the Caliphate under the influence a Jewish magician from Tiberias, variously called Beser or Tessarakontapechys, who promised Yazid a long life of fortune in return.{{sfn|Vasiliev|1956|pp=27\u201333}} Syriac sources further note that Yazid entrusted Maslama to execute the order and that the edict influenced the Byzantine emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] ({{reign|717|741}}) to enact his own iconoclastic policy in the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|Vasiliev|1956|p=37}} The Egypt-based Arabic historians [[Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Kindi|al-Kindi]] (d. 961), Bishop [[Severus ibn al-Muqaffa]] (d. 987) and [[al-Maqrizi]] (d. 1442) also make note of the edict and describe its execution in Egypt.{{sfn|Vasiliev|1956|pp=39\u201340}} The medieval historians cite different years for Yazid's edict, but the modern historian [[Alexander Vasiliev (historian)|Alexander Vasiliev]] holds that July 721, the date cited by Patriarch John V, is the most reliable.{{sfn|Vasiliev|1956|p=47}} The order was reversed by Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] ({{reign|724|743}}).{{sfn|Vasiliev|1956|pp=39\u201340}}\n\n===Death===\nYazid died in [[Irbid]] in the [[Balqa]] (e. g.

responsible for the torture and deaths of members of al-Hajjaj's family, Yazid's in-laws, and feared retaliatory maltreatment when Yazid's accession became apparent.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=313}} Yazid

Caliphate.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=322}} \n\nEvading the pursuit of Umar's or Yazid's commanders, Ibn al-Muhallab made his way to [[Basra]], the center of his family and [[Azd|Azd Uman]] tribe.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=313}} On Yazid's orders Basra's governor [[Adi ibn Artah al-Fazari|Adi ibn Artat al-Fazari]] arrested many of Ibn al-Muhallab's brothers and cousins before his arrival to the city.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=313}}{{sfn|Powers|1989|p=112}} Ibn Artat was unable to stop Ibn al-Muhallab's entry and the latter, with support from his Yamani tribal allies in the Basra garrison,

unsympathetic to Ibn al-Muhallab, did not actively or effectively oppose him.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=314}} Ibn al-Muhallab seized the citadel, captured the governor and established control over Basra.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=314}} Yazid pardoned him, but Ibn al-Muhallab continued his opposition, declaring a [[jihad|holy war]] (''jih\u0101d'') against the caliph and the Syrian troops who effectively served as the enforcers of Umayyad authority in Iraq.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=314}} Umar II had likely withdrawn most of the Syrians from [[Wasit]], their main Iraqi garrison, and Ibn al-Muhallab was able to capture the city with relative ease.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=313, 316}} Most of the pious [[Qur'an]] readers and the ''[[mawla|maw\u0101l\u012b]]'' (non-Arab Muslim converts) of Basra supported Ibn al-Muhallab's cause, with the exception of the prominent scholar [[al-Hasan al-Basri]].{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=314\u2013315}} The dependent districts of Basra, namely [[Ahwaz]], [[Pars (Sasanian province)|Fars]] and [[Kerman]], joined the revolt, though not Khurasan, where Qays\u2013Mudar troops counterbalanced the pro-Muhallabid Yamani faction in the province's garrisons.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=315\u2013316}} \n\nIbn al-Muhallab advanced toward [[Kufa]], the other main garrison center of Iraq, where he attracted support across the tribal spectrum and among many of its noble Arab households.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=316\u2013317}} In the meantime, Yazid dispatched his kinsmen, the veteran commanders [[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik]] and [[al-Abbas ibn al-Walid]], to suppress the revolt.{{sfn|Powers|1989|p=127}} They killed Ibn al-Muhallab and routed his army near Kufa on 24 August 720.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=318}} Yazid ordered the executions of the roughly two hundred prisoners-of-war captured from Ibn al-Muhallab's camp, while Ibn al-Muhallab's son Mu'awiya ordered the execution of Ibn Artat and his thirty supporters incarcerated in Wasit.{{sfn|Powers|1989|pp=140\u2013141}} Afterward, the Umayyad authorities pursued and killed many of the Muhallabids, including nine to fourteen boys who were sent to Yazid and executed by his

Maslama\u2014who was shortly dismissed for not forwarding the provincial tax surplus to the caliph's treasury\u2014and Maslama's lieutenant [[Umar ibn Hubayra al-Fazari]] signaled a triumph for the Qays\u2013Mudar faction in the province and its eastern dependencies.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=319\u2013320}} According to the historian [[Julius Wellhausen]], \"the proscription of the whole of the prominent and powerful [Muhallabid] family, a measure hitherto unheard of in the history of the Umaiyids [sic], came like a declaration of war against the Yemen [faction] in general, and the corollary was that the government was degenerating into a Qaisite party-rule\".{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=322}} Wellhausen blames the caliph for the escalation of factionalism and attributed the appointment of Ibn Hubayra to his own desire for revenge against the Muhallabids' Yamani backers.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=322}} The Yamani-affiliated tribes of Khurasan viewed the events as a humiliation and during the [[Abbasid Revolution]] which toppled the Umayyads in 750 they adopted as one of their slogans \"revenge for the Banu Muhallab [Muhallabids]\".{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=76}} \n\nThe orientalist [[Henri

did\".{{sfn|Lammens|Blankinship|2002|p=311}} Yazid did not champion the Qays over the [[Quda'a]], a major component of the Yaman confederation in Syria.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=322}} Indeed, members of the Quda'a's principal tribe, the [[Banu Kalb]], had formed the core of the caliph's army during the suppression, pursuit and elimination of the Muhallabids.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=322}} He appointed Yamani governors to the large provinces of [[Ifriqiya]] (North Africa west of Egypt) and the [[Upper Mesopotamia|Jazira]] (Upper Mesopotamia) and its dependent districts of [[Adharbayjan]] and [[Arminiya|Armenia]].{{sfn|Lammens|Blankinship|2002|p=311}}\n\n===Fiscal and military policies===\nThe expenses of enforcing Umayyad rule in Iraq and the expansionist war efforts along multiple fronts, including the enormous cost of the failed [[Siege of Constantinople (717\u2013718)|sieges of Constantinople in 717\u2013718]], had erased much of the monetary gains from the conquests of [[Transoxiana]], [[Arab Sind|Sind]] and the Iberian Peninsula under al-Walid I and caused a financial crisis in the Caliphate.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=84\u201385}} Among the solutions of Yazid's predecessor to the fiscal burden were the withdrawal of the Syrians from Iraq, a halt on conquests and near elimination of grants to Umayyad princes, as well as an unrealized goal to withdraw Arab troops altogether from Transoxiana, the Iberian Peninsula and [[Cilicia]].{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=84\u201385}} The most significant reforms of Umar II granted equality to the ''maw\u0101l\u012b'' in Khurasan, Sind, Ifriqiya and the Iberian Peninsula by abolishing the ''[[jizya]]'', the [[poll tax]] traditionally exacted on non-Muslim subjects but in practice extended to non-Arab Muslim converts, and instituting equal pay for ''maw\u0101l\u012b'' in the ranks of the Caliphate's Arab-dominated armies.{{sfn|Lammens|Blankinship|2002|p=311}}{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=86}} According to Blankinship, the reforms favoring the ''maw\u0101l\u012b'' may have been guided by Umar II's piety, but also a fiscal consideration: if equal treatment with the Arabs made the government popular with the ''maw\u0101l\u012b'' it could translate into delegating an increased security role for the ''maw\u0101l\u012b'' in their native provinces and their enthusiastic defense of the Caliphate's frontiers, thereby reducing the expense of deploying and garrisoning Arab troops.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nYazid attempted to reverse, with limited success, the reforms of Umar II, which were opposed by the Arab militarist camp in the Caliphate and the Umayyad ruling family.{{sfn|Lammens|Blankinship|2002|p=311}} During Umar II's rule the militarist camp led by Maslama may have accepted a temporary pause in activity to recover from the Constantinople debacle.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=86\u201387}} Under Yazid, Maslama and his proteges, including Ibn Hubayra, were restored or appointed to senior commands, Syrian garrisons were reintroduced to Iraq, the traditional annual raids against the Byzantines and the [[Arab\u2013Khazar wars|war with the Khazars]] were restarted, and the grants of estates or generous sums to Umayyad princes resumed.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=87}} Although Yazid's policies were presumably meant to gain the backing of the ruling elite and restore the flow of war spoils, they proved insufficient to finance the the Caliphate's troops, particularly as booty had become increasingly difficult to obtain by the Arab expeditionary forces.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=87}}\n\nTo fill the depleted coffers of the caliphal treasury Yazid turned to the fifth of provincial tax revenues officially owed to the caliph. Historically, the provinces neglected to forward the revenues if political conditions allowed and governors often pilfered such funds. To ensure the flow of revenues to the treasury, Yazid appointed governors based on the example set by al-Hajjaj, i.e. upright, meticulously loyal and ruthless in the collection of taxes.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=87}} Unlike the era of al-Hajjaj, however, Yazid applied this principle for the first time to Ifriqiya, Khurasan, Sind and the Iberian Peninsula.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=87}} A major aspect of his policy was the reinstatement of the ''jizya'' on the ''maw\u0101l\u012b'',{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=87}} which alienated the ''maw\u0101l\u012b'' in the aforementioned provinces.{{sfn|Lammens|Blankinship|2002|p=311}} \n\nIn Ifriqiya, the caliph's governor [[Yazid ibn Abi Muslim]], himself a ''mawl\u0101'' from Iraq and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of al-Hajjaj, was assassinated by his [[Berbers|Berber]] guard in 720, shortly after his appointment, for attempting to reinstate the ''jizya''.{{sfn|Lammens|Blankinship|2002|p=311}} Many, if not most, Berbers had embraced Islam and commanded a strong position in the army unlike  ''maw\u0101l\u012b'' in other parts of the Caliphate.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=87\u201388}} The Berbers reinstalled Ibn Abi Muslim's predecessor [[Ismail ibn Abd Allah ibn Abi al-Muhajir]] and notified Yazid, who approved the change.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=323}} The incident in Ifriqiya was a blow to the Caliphate's prestige in North Africa and served as a harbinger for the [[Berber Revolt]] in 740\u2013743.{{sfn|Lammens|Blankinship|2002|p=311}} The reinstatement of the ''jizya'' in Khurasan in 721/22 by Ibn Hubayra's deputy [[Sa'id ibn Amr al-Harashi]] led to revolts and wars in the province that continued for twenty years and partly contributed to the Abbasid Revolution.{{sfn|Lammens|Blankinship|2002|p=311}} In Egypt pay increases to the indigenous ''maw\u0101l\u012b'' sailors of the Muslim fleet were reversed.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=87}}\n\nAnti-Umayyad groups began to gain power among the disaffected. Al-Tabari records that [[Abbasids]] were promoting their cause in A.H. 102 (720-721 CE). They were already building a power base that they would later use to topple the Umayyads in 750 CE. \n\nThat same year Yazid's governor in [[Medina]], [['Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri|Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Dahhak]], incurred the caliph's displeasure because the governor was exerting undue pressure trying to force a woman to marry him. She appealed to Yazid who replaced Abd al-Rahman with Abd al-Walid ibn Abdallah.{{sfn|Powers|1989|pp=180ff.}}\n\n===War against the Khazars===\nIn March 722 the Syrian army of Yazid's governor in Armenia and Adharbayjan, [[Mi'laq ibn Saffar al-Bahrani]], was routed by the [[Khazar Khaganate|Khazars]] in Armenia, south of the [[Caucasus]]. The defeat marked the culmination of the Caliphate's winter campaign against the Khazars and resulted in considerable Syrian losses.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=121\u2013122}} To avenge this defeat, Yazid II sent [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah]] at the head of a 25,000-strong army of Syrians, who pushed into the Caucasus homeland of the Khazars and took their capital of [[Balanjar]] on 22 August.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=122}} The main body of the highly mobile Khazars avoided the Muslims' pursuit and their presence compelled al-Jarrah to withdraw to Warthan south of the Caucasus and request reinforcements of from Yazid.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=122}} In 723 he led another raid north of Balanjar, but made no remarkable gains.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=122}}\n\n===Iconoclastic edict===\nAccording to Greek sources, including Patriarch [[John V of Jerusalem]] (d. 735), [[Theophanes the Confessor]] (d. 818) and Patriarch [[Nikephoros I of Constantinople]] (d. 828), Yazid issued an edict ordering the destruction of all [[icon]]s in Christian churches across the Caliphate under the influence a Jewish magician from Tiberias, variously called Beser or Tessarakontapechys, who promised Yazid a long life of fortune in return.{{sfn|Vasiliev|1956|pp=27\u201333}} Syriac sources further note that Yazid entrusted Maslama to execute the order and that the edict influenced the Byzantine emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] ({{reign|717|741}}) to enact his own iconoclastic policy in the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|Vasiliev|1956|p=37}} The Egypt-based Arabic historians [[Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Kindi|al-Kindi]] (d. 961), Bishop [[Severus ibn al-Muqaffa]] (d. 987) and [[al-Maqrizi]] (d. 1442) also make note of the edict and describe its execution in Egypt.{{sfn|Vasiliev|1956|pp=39\u201340}} The medieval historians cite different years for Yazid's edict, but the modern historian [[Alexander Vasiliev (historian)|Alexander Vasiliev]] holds that July 721, the date cited by Patriarch John V, is the most reliable.{{sfn|Vasiliev|1956|p=47}} The order was reversed by Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] ({{reign|724|743}}).{{sfn|Vasiliev|1956|pp=39\u201340}}\n\n===Death===\nYazid died in [[Irbid]] in the [[Balqa]] (e. g. [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]]) subdistrict of [[Jund Dimashq]] (military district of Damascus) on 26 [[Sha'ban]] 105 [[Anno Hegirae|AH]] (28 January 724 CE).{{sfn|Powers|1989|pp=193\u2013194}} His son al-Walid or half-brother Hisham led his funeral prayers.{{sfn|Powers|1989|p=194}} Yazid had intended to appoint al-Walid as his immediate successor, but was persuaded by Maslama to appoint Hisham instead, followed by al-Walid.{{sfn|Blankinship|1989|p=87, note 439}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |last1=Ahmed |first1=Asad Q. |title=The Religious Elite of the Early Islamic \u1e24ij\u0101z: Five Prosopographical Case Studies |date=2010 |publisher=University of Oxford Linacre College Unit for Prosopographical Research |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1-900934-13-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1dwdBDDjcUC |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal |last=Bacharach |first=Jere L. |authorlink=Jere L.

Ana helps with the training and forms a close bond with Derek Brooks, a designer in charge of creating the visual appearance of the digients.\n\nBlue Gamma releases the digients in a virtual reality platform named Data Earth with big initial success, but after several years, the popularity of the digients diminishes and Blue Gamma closes. Several of the employees form a group to keep the digients active and learning; Ana keeps one named Jax and Derek keeps two named Marco and Polo.

Tabor's motto is \"All-A-Taut-O\", referring to the condition in which a sailing ship is fully rigged and everything is in place. This phrase is referenced in the school's songs, and is a tribute to Tabor's [[nautical]] background.

Article 27 of her will stated, \"I have lately caused to be erected on a lot owned by me in Marion Lower Village, a building ... to be known as 'The Tabor Academy'.\"<ref>[http://www.taboracademy.planyourlegacy.org/heritage.php Tabor Academy profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818042118/http://www.taboracademy.planyourlegacy.org/heritage.php |date=August 18, 2007 }}, taboracademy.planyourlegacy.org; accessed July 9, 2015.</ref> She named the school after [[Mount Tabor]], a mountain of biblical importance near the [[Sea of Galilee]].{{ref|1|1}} She stated that \"the character of the school should be gradually elevated and its scope enlarged [to serve] youth of all portions of the country\".<ref>[http://www.taboracademy.org/history.asp Tabor Academy website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109111559/http://www.taboracademy.org/history.asp |date=November 9, 2009 }}, taboracademy.org; accessed July 9, 2015.</ref> From its creation, the academy was co-educational just as Mrs. Taber had intended, established \"to provide better and more complete facilities than had heretofore existed or were likely to exist for thorough education in the higher branches of English knowledge\".<ref>[http://www.sippicanhistoricalsociety.org/Newsltr%20Aug%2003.pdf Tabor Academy profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905100515/http://www.sippicanhistoricalsociety.org/Newsltr%20Aug%2003.pdf |date=September 5, 2008 }}, sippicanhistoricalsociety.org; accessed July 9, 2015.</ref>\n\nThe first headmaster was Clark Phelps Howland of [[Yale University]], who reported in 1884 that \"It is the aim of the school to give thorough instruction, and to encourage in its pupils a desire for the real rather than the showy, and to develop the moral as well as the intellectual element.\" The initial tuition fee for the Academy was $24, or $300 for students who wished to board in the headmaster's home.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} While Elizabeth Taber did not stipulate any particular religious affiliation for the academy, Howland stated that Tabor \"will probably always be under the management of those who sympathize with the Congregational faith.\" Howland was succeeded by Dana Marsh Dustan, [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] B.A. 1880, A.M. 1883 (1893\u20131901), Nathan Chipman Hamblin, [[Harvard University|Harvard]] B.A. 1892 (1901\u20131910) and Charles Edward Pethybridge, [[Amherst College|Amherst]] B.A. 1906 (1910\u20131916).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n'''The Lillard Years'''\n[[Image:SchoolboyFellowship.png|thumb|left|The schoolboys and headmasters of the International Schoolboy Fellowship outside the \u00c9cole du Montcel in summer 1928.

He believed strongly in a \"balanced preparatory education\" which nurtured both a student's mind and body. The mission of the Academy under Lillard, as stated in a 1922 handbook, was \" To prepare boys to take their proper place in the world of today.\" An emphasis was put on the thoroughness of a Tabor education both inside and outside of the classroom.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nLillard turned Tabor into an all-boys' school and cancelled plans to make the Academy the town of Marion's school {{clarify|date=July 2015}} and vowed to keep it a privately endowed and operated institution.<ref name=\"Maritime Marion page 125\">\"Maritime Marion, MA\" by Judith Westlund Rosbe, page 125</ref> In the 1930s, Lillard orchestrated a trade with the town of Marion. The original Academy buildings were deeded to the town (now the Elizabeth Taber Library and Marion Town Hall) and were traded for the current waterfront location in order to allow the academy to expand and grow. He acquired the surrounding cottages and plots of land in order to secure the academy's future expansion' the area had increased ten-fold by the end of his tenure in 1942.<ref>[http://www.taboracademy.org/podium/default.aspx?t=120504 Tabor Academy website], taboracademy.org; accessed July 9, 2015.</ref> Among other contributions to the school was his design of the current seal of the school, which shows a full rigged ship and the motto \"All-a-taut-o\". He selected the seal as an image to students to \"sail towards broader horizons\" and the motto because of its nautical meaning as the state of a vessel when everything is shipshape and accounted for.<ref name=\"Maritime Marion page 125\"/>\n\nLillard was responsible for the creation of the International Schoolboy Fellowship in 1927, the first established international student exchange program for American schoolboys.<ref name=\"ourstory.info\">[http://www.ourstory.info/library/5-AFSIS/1928/brochure.html ourstory.info]; accessed July 9, 2015.</ref> He was chairman of the program which he formed in conjunction with headmasters from schools in England, France and Germany and eventually invited fifteen other New England prep schools to join as well. He took all boys who \"made good\" during the academic year on the annual cruise to France to partake in the exchange and brought English schoolboys to study at the Academy during the year. Lillard believed that \"One American boy in a French community for a summer brings home a new understanding of French tradition and ideals, which he communicates to his schoolfellows. Friendship and tolerance are bred by intimacy, we cannot begin too young.\"<ref name=\"ourstory.info\"/> After his years at Tabor, Walter \"Cappy\" Lillard went on to work for the United Nations in Vienna as the Chief of the Resettlement Division of the International Refugee Organization.<ref>[http://www.well.com/user/jmalloy/walter_huston_lillard.html Walter Lillard profile], well.com; accessed July 9, 2015.</ref>\n\n'''Tabor today'''<br>\nThe school was, until the late 1940s, a maritime school where uniformed boys performed morning and evening drill as well as pursuing a classical academic curriculum. When it returned to its original ideals as a rigorous, college preparatory boarding and day school, it still retained its status as a Naval Honor School. It was designated a Naval Honor School in 1941 by Secretary of the Navy [[Frank Knox]], and remains only one of two secondary schools which still hold the distinction.<ref>[http://www.taboracademy.org/podium/default.aspx?t=120599 Tabor Academy website], taboracademy.org; accessed July 9, 2015.</ref> Although today's students pursue a collegiate preparatory curriculum in the sciences, maths and humanities, courses are still offered in seamanship, coastal and celestial navigation, naval architecture, lifeboatman training and sail training.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe headmasters who followed Lillard and continued his vision of expansion and growth were James W. Wickenden (1942\u20131976), Peter M. Webster B.A. [[University of Texas|Texas]] M.A.T. Yale (1976\u20131989) and Jay S. Stroud B.A. [[Carleton College]], M.A. [[Dartmouth College]], Ed.M [[Columbia University]] (1989\u20132012). In 2002, Stroud commented on the experience of living and learning at Tabor, \"Our unparalleled location on the edge of the sea creates our metaphor for education. While some of our students literally study marine biology or celestial navigation, sail boats both large and small, row crew shells or swim off Tabor's docks, all our students undertake voyages of the mind and spirit. Tabor reminds us all that daily life is about the largest visions possible. It is about widening the horizon, redefining the possible, developing the courage to undertake great voyages. All of us who live here are fortunate to have both the joy and the possibility of adventure in the tides that rise at our front door every morning. It is the right place for a school.\"<ref>\"Maritime Marion, MA\" by Judith Westlund Rosbe, page 138</ref> Stroud retired after the class of 2012. John Quirk was selected by the Board of Trustees to be the headmaster following Stroud's retirement. Quirk arrived at Tabor following a twenty five-year career on the faculty and administration of the Brooks School in Massachusetts.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Campus==\n[[Image:TaborAcademyLillardHall.jpg|thumb|Lillard Hall dormitory]]\nThe campus and location of the Academy is one of the most recognizable and famous features of Tabor. Its open and ungated campus is divided into three sections by Front Street and Spring Street. The dormitory of Lillard Hall, the Johnson Dining Room, the Fireman Performing Arts Center, Hoyt Hall, the Marine Science Center, the Martin Fields and two underclassmen dormitories form the waterfront portion of the campus. Across Front Street is the academic and athletic core of the campus consisting of the Academic Center, the Hayden Library, the Math and Science Center, the Fish Center for Athletics, the Health Center, the Braitmayer Art Center, the Hoyt Fields, the Admissions House and some dormitories. \"Upper Campus\" is the area across Spring Street and consists of the Wickenden Chapel, a chemistry lab, the Hutchinson tennis courts, the James D. Gowing track, the Chapel fields and [[dormitory|dormitories]] which appear to be cottages or private homes from the outside. The lack of gates and fences creates a blending of the campus with the surrounding village.\n\nThe dormitories at Tabor Academy range from small houses with as few as five students, to larger dormitories with as many as 40 students, each mixed with freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors. Each dormitory has three faculty \"dorm parents\", at least one of whom lives in the dormitory with their family alongside the students. Both single and double rooms are available for students to choose in the housing lottery. Additionally, selective underclassmen serve as proctors who live in the dormitories to assist the younger students with the adjustment to boarding life and to serve as a medium between the students and the faculty.<ref>[http://www.taboracademy.org/podium/default.aspx?t=120565 Tabor Academy website], taboracademy.org; accessed July 9, 2015.</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nTabor offers a program useful at competitive colleges. For a school of its size, the curriculum contains an especially broad spectrum of courses, from introductory levels to honors and 22 [[Advanced Placement Program|AP]] courses to highly sophisticated opportunities for independent work.\n\nTabor offers classes in the traditional [[liberal arts]] fields such as the [[humanities]], [[math]] and the sciences but also [[Greek language|Greek]], [[ichthyology]], [[Chinese language|Mandarin Chinese]], lighting design and numerous [[nautical]] and [[marine science]] courses. In addition to a classical curriculum, Tabor offers elective courses about everything from [[blogging]] to Greek philosophy. If a student exhausts the levels of a course available, the independent study program allows students to pursue a strength to the level they desire. A student will work one on one with a faculty member and create a custom curriculum and syllabus to satisfy their interest.\n\nAmong the many scholarships and accolades available for exceptional Tabor students is the [[Morehead-Cain Scholarship]]. It is the secondary school equivalent of the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and is a full four-year scholarship to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] awarded to one graduating senior every year. There is an [[Outward Bound]] program in which a nominated sophomore takes part each summer. Tabor has a drama exchange program with [[Ellesmere College]] in England. A participant in the exchange program was [[Chris Hawkins]].\n[[image:MarineScienceCtr.png|thumb|right|The Marine Science Center]]\n\nThe waterfront campus of Tabor allows for academic programs and opportunities not possible elsewhere. It is one of the few secondary schools in the United States to offer extensive programs in nautical science and [[oceanology]]. The 2006 issue of ''[[Boston Magazine]]'' rated Tabor as one of the top private schools in the sciences, based on its unique programs in marine science and celestial navigation. Opened for the first time for classes in September 2005, the Marine Science Center is the center of the oceanography and marine science faculties at Tabor. The school also owns ''Tabor Boy'', a {{convert|92|ft|m|adj=on}} Dutch pilot [[schooner]], which is a certified school sailing vessel.\n\nEvery three years Tabor offers the Caribbean Studies Program. Students take a preparatory course in the fall, which readies them for the research and studies they will carry out in the Caribbean. In the winter of that year, students are taken to the [[US Virgin Islands]] in small groups for ten days where they conduct research aboard the S.S.V. ''Tabor Boy'' which is sailed down at the beginning of the program by a crew of Tabor students. The data collected by Tabor students is used by the [[United States Geological Survey]] in its ongoing efforts in the region.\n\n==Athletics==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\nTabor Academy fields 55 different teams in 23 interscholastic sports and another 15 instructional programs. The school has the Fish health and athletic center, which includes an indoor hockey rink, fitness center, weight room, wrestling room, eight squash courts, field house, basketball gymnasium, football field, four basketball courts, student lounge and grill, athletic offices, a resident athletic trainer, locker rooms, team rooms and an attached health center and infirmary. Tabor also has the waterfront on Sippican Harbor in Marion for swimming in the spring and summer months, and is used for the training of the sailing and rowing teams.\n\n[[Image:TaborAcademyHenleyCrew1939.png|thumb|left|The 1939 Tabor Academy crew prepare to board the ''Queen Mary'' to travel to England to win their third championship in the [[Henley Royal Regatta]] in the span of four years]]\n\n===Rowing===\nIn 1919, Tabor was one of the first American prep schools to formally establish a rowing program. The strong rowing history at Tabor dates back almost a century. Both the men's and the women's teams have been active participants in the [[Henley Royal Regatta]] in Henley-on-Thames, UK. The men won the [[Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup]] in 1965, the [[Thames Challenge Cup]] in 1936, 1937 and 1939 and have made it to the finals in both numerous times. In 1939, the ''New York Times'' reported on Tabor's dominance on the international level, stating that \"It is almost a maxim nowadays that either Tabor Academy or [[Kent School]] will win the Thames Challenge Cup race for eight-oared crews.\"<ref>\"FIRST BY 3 LENGTHS\", ''New York Times'', July 9, 1939.</ref> In August 1938, Tabor's status as an international power in schoolboy rowing was confirmed by its participation in one of the first recorded international schoolboy competitions on American waters when a crew of [[Radley College]] oarsmen traveled across the Atlantic via the [[Cunard Line]] [[RMS Aquitania|RMS ''Aquitania'']] to race the Tabor Academy crew on [[Sippican Harbor]] in Marion.<ref>\"RADLEY WILL ROW AUG. 24; English Eight to Meet Tabor Academy at Marion\", ''New York Times'', August 4, 1938.</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1930s and 1940s Tabor competed regionally against rival prep schools, with its strongest rival being [[Kent School]], faced in numerous Henley finals and American championship regattas. During this period, in order to seek out a higher level of competition, Tabor raced against crews from [[Harvard University]], Yale University and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|M.I.T.]] The relationship between Tabor and Harvard can be traced back to 1931 when Tabor traveled to England with the Harvard crew to race at Henley and used one of the Crimson's shells in competition.<ref>\"Tabor Crew to Compete in English Henley; Plans to Use Harvard Shell in Thames Race\", ''New York Times'', June 2, 1931.</ref>\n\n[[Image:1918TaborCrew.png|thumb|right|A crew of four Tabor boys rows on Sippican Harbor in 1918.]]\nIn 1951, Tabor was one of the original founding members of the New England Interscholastic Rowing Association along with [[Belmont Hill]], [[Choate Rosemary Hall|Choate]], [[the Gunnery]], [[Salisbury School|Salisbury]], [[St. George's School, Newport|St. George's]], [[Buckingham Browne & Nichols|Browne & Nichols]], [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], [[Pomfret School|Pomfret]], South Kent, [[St. Mark's School (Massachusetts)|St. Mark's]], [[Kent School|Kent]], the Halcyon and Shattuck clubs from [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's]], and Shrewsbury.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIn 1967, the Tabor oarsmen were poised to win their second Henley victory in three years. Rowing hard races until the finals they faced a well-rested [[Eton College]] crew and lost by \u00be of one boatlength. Another famous race was the 1947 [[Thames Challenge Cup]] final at Henley. Coming after the destruction of World War II, many of the British crews did not have sufficient food after war rationing. Tabor thought the honorable decision was to train under the same calorific restrictions as the British crews. They still managed to reach the finals where they lost to traditional rival Kent School, who brought along their own provisions from the US, but won wide support from the British fans and press for their sportsmanship.<ref>Jay S. Stroud, ''Tabor Today''<!-- more info needed --></ref>\n\nTabor is one of eleven schools to have a guest room at the famed [[Leander Club]], in Henley-on-Thames. Each room is named after, designed in the colors of and features various memorabilia from a major rowing school or university. Among the other schools with rooms at Leander are Harvard, Yale, Brown, Oxford, Cambridge and Kent. In recent years, Tabor has continued to win NEIRA championships, win invitations to the USRowing Youth National Championships and travel to England to race at the Henley Royal Regatta on a regular basis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://taboracademy.myschoolapp.com/app/student#newsdetail/1112760/0/0/0|title=Tabor Crew Competes in Henley Royal Regatta|last=Kasparak|first=Chris|date=June 28, 2017|website=Tabor Academy|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Ice hockey===\nTabor's men's [[ice hockey]] team, three time New England Champions, has produced over 24 [[NCAA]] Division 1 and [[NHL]] caliber players over the years. The men's and women's team practice and compete in the [[Travis Roy]] arena on campus.

The boys were the 2007 National High School Class B Team Champions and the girls were the 2009 New England Class B Team Squash Champions and have performed impressively at the National Championships.\n\n===Sailing===\nThe Tabor sailing team is consistently strong, having won several national championships and having produced Olympic medalists such as [[Charlie Ogletree]] who won silver at the [[2004 Olympic Games]] in Athens, Greece. The team has won the National High School Team Racing Championship (the \"Baker Trophy\") seven times since the event's founding in 1989 (1989, 1990, 1991, 1995, 1997, 2007 and 2011), shared it with [[Miami Palmetto High School]], a public school in Miami, Florida, in 1994, and has won the National High School Dinghy Championship (the \"Mallory Trophy\") six times since the event's founding in 1930 (1977, 1978, 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1986). In 1999, the sailing team won the New England Sailing \"triple crown\" and completed a record 19\u20130 season.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n===Wrestling===\nThe Tabor wrestling program has also enjoyed a successful history under the direction of coach Dr. F. Timothy Walsh. Walsh was recently inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame for his illustrious career while a coach at [[Amherst College]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|M.I.T.]] and Tabor. He finished his last four years at Tabor with a 72\u201312 record and during his tenure won numerous Class A championships and produced many National Prep School All Americans, and more National Prep Champions than any other New England Prep School as of 2011. The program has also enjoyed recent success both in the Class A league, as well as in New England under the new head coach, former Tabor wrestler and national prep champion, Conan Leary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.taboracademy.org/page/team-detail-winter?fromId=187496&Team=87302&SeasonLabel=2016+-+2017|title=Team Detail (Winter) {{!}} Tabor Academy|website=www.taboracademy.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-08}}</ref>\n\n===Basketball===\nSince the early 1990s, the boys' and girls' basketball teams have consistently been competitive in Class A of the [[New England Preparatory School Athletic Council]].\n\nFormer Seawolves are currently playing for [[NCAA]] Division I, II and III schools such as the [[University of Connecticut]], the [[University of South Carolina]], [[Harvard University]], [[Columbia University]], [[Brown University]], [[Princeton University]], [[the University of Pennsylvania]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Georgetown University]], [[Dartmouth College]], Amherst College, [[Williams College]], [[Colby College]], [[Middlebury College]] among others.\n\nStudents can choose from the following sports and non-active alternatives.

Every year a new freshman class enrolls, as well as a large number of new sophomores and to a lesser extent, new juniors and seniors. About 75 percent of those students live in [[Dormitory|dormitories]] on campus while the remaining 25 percent are day students who live at home and commute to the school. A large part of the community at Tabor is the international students who come from around the world to learn at the Academy. There are students and faculty who live in North and South America, the Caribbean, Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and the Middle East.\n\n'''The ''S.S.V. Tabor Boy'''''\n\nThe academy utilizes its extensive waterfront facilities to house Tabor's 92' schooner ''''S.S.V. Tabor Boy''''. The Tabor Boy is one of the most famous and recognizable features of the school. The roots of the program were founded in 1917 when then headmaster W.H. Lillard loaned two {{convert|31|ft|m|adj=on}} cutters from the U.S. Navy to develop the academy's nautical programs. In 1925, \"The Tabor Boy Trust\" was formed to raise funds to purchase an 88' schooner for the school's use. In 1933, Headmaster Lillard, Captain Lewis and 18 students sailed the Tabor Boy up the [[Hudson River]], through the [[New York State Barge Canal|New York State Canal System]] and down the [[Great Lakes]] to show the Tabor Boy off in an eight-week exhibition at the [[Century of Progress|World's Fair]] in Chicago.<ref>\"Sea Scouting: Cruise to the Century of Progress\" Boys' Life Magazine, September 1933</ref>\n\nThe runaway success of the nautical-training and deep-water cruising programs that the ''Tabor Boy'' provided led the school to purchase the ''Eldu II'', soon to be renamed the ''Tabor Boy II'', in 1945. The boat was raced in numerous Newport-to-Bermuda regattas by Tabor students until it was retired in 1954. In 1954, the boat was replaced with the current vessel, a 92\u2019 Dutch Pilot Schooner, still referred to as ''Tabor Boy'' and has since logged tens of thousands of miles.<ref>\"Maritime Marion, MA\" by Judith Westlund Rosbe, page 128</ref> The boat is moored in Sippican Harbor and is in regular use with fall and spring all-student crews as well as the Freshman Orientation at Sea and Caribbean Studies programs.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n'''Beyond the Classroom'''\n\nThere are many activities for students to participate in on the weekends as well as some weeknights. On the weekends there are usually school-sponsored trips to either Providence or Boston, which are both less than an hour from campus by bus. Also, there are activities such as vans to the local cinema, trips to the mall or local restaurants. On campus, there are usually a combination of dances, dorm activities, film screenings, hypnotists, visiting bands, intramural sports competitions and other various events. Every night the Beebe Grill is open in the Fish Center for students to get something to eat after study hall, or a place where there are musical performances and dances on the weekends. In the spring, the waterfront is opened used by students to take out boats for the afternoon or to go swimming off the docks and in the winter students can use the Travis Roy Rink for skating on weekend nights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.taboracademy.org/page/campus-life/weekends-at-tabor|title=Weekends at Tabor {{!}} Tabor Academy|website=www.taboracademy.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-08}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, Tabor Academy is located walking distance from Silvershell Beach, where students can have a picnic on the beach, take a quick jog, and pick up ice cream from the Marion General Store on the way.\n\n'''A global education'''\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nStudents are given the opportunity to attend an English boarding school for one year, as a gap year, after graduation through the [[English Speaking Union]]. Through this exchange, each year one student from England comes to campus as a full member of senior class for the entirety of the school year. Every year a few students elect to go abroad for one year through the [[School Year Abroad]] program to locations such as China, Italy, France, Spain, India, and Vietnam. During the year abroad they immerse themselves in the local culture and language while pursuing a rigorous academic curriculum.\n\n==On-campus traditions and events==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nTabor has had long history of events and activities that have become campus traditions: Tabor-[[Holderness]] Day, First Snow, and Springfest are examples. Twice every week the entire school community gathers in Wickenden Chapel for a chapel service. It is not a religious service, rather it serves as a time for the entire community to gather together, sing the Alma Mater and listen to a speech. The speeches are given by students and faculty and can be comedic, tragic, nostalgic, philosophical, shocking and everything in between.\n\nOn the last school night before Thanksgiving break, the academy puts on a full Thanksgiving feast for the school and decorates the dining hall with traditional trappings of the holiday. A similar feast is held on the morning the students depart for the winter vacation, a traditional Christmas breakfast is put on in the dining hall with all the decorations one would expect from a proper holiday celebration.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe school holds an annual service of [[Nine Lessons and Carols]] similar to the famous one held yearly at [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] at [[Cambridge University]]. The service is widely attended in Wickenden Chapel by not only faculty and students but with residents from the surrounding towns.\n\nSpring at Tabor is defined by Springfest. One day in spring right before graduation the waterfront fields are turned into a fair of sorts. The docks are littered with students sunbathing and swimming, the fields are filled with everything from volleyball nets, to waterslides, to a rock climbing wall, and stages are set up and bands are brought in that play into the night.\n\n'''The Tabor Academy Alma Mater'''\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n''Hail, dear old Tabor!''\n\n''Noble and strong,''\n\n''To thee with loyal hearts''\n\n''We raise our song.''\n\n''Swelling to Heaven''\n\n''Loud our praises ring;''\n\n''Hail, dear old Tabor!''\n\n''Of thee we sing.''\n\n''Broad seas before us lie.''\n\n''We ride the gale;''\n\n''With eyes bright, hands alert,''\n\n''and close-trimmed sail''\n\n''Later upon life's voyage,''\n\n''Our skill we'll try''\n\n''Hail, Tabor; All-a-taut-o is our cry!''\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nThe alumni of Tabor have a farreaching influence in a number of different fields. Those who have passed through Tabor have gone on to become candidates for the [[President of the United States|Presidency of the United States]], billionaires and tycoons of business, [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning authors, Olympians and other influential people in the areas of business, government, culture and sport. A 2009 report by the [[Boston Business Journal]] showed that two of the top six largest companies (in terms of annual revenue) in Massachusetts had a Tabor graduate as CEO.\n\n===Academics and writing===\n*[[Halton Arp]] '45, astronomer<ref name=\"Halton Arp Obituary\">{{cite news|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|title=Halton C.

Article 27 of her will stated, \"I have lately caused to be erected on a lot owned by me in Marion Lower Village, a building ... to be known as 'The Tabor Academy'.\"<ref>[http://www.taboracademy.planyourlegacy.org/heritage.php Tabor Academy profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818042118/http://www.taboracademy.planyourlegacy.org/heritage.php |date=August 18, 2007 }}, taboracademy.planyourlegacy.org; accessed July 9, 2015.</ref> She named the school after [[Mount Tabor]], a mountain of biblical importance near the [[Sea of Galilee]].{{ref|1|1}} She stated that \"the character of the school should be gradually elevated and its scope enlarged [to serve] youth of all portions of the country\".<ref>[http://www.taboracademy.org/history.asp Tabor Academy website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109111559/http://www.taboracademy.org/history.asp |date=November 9, 2009 }}, taboracademy.org; accessed July 9, 2015.</ref> From its creation, the academy was co-educational just as Mrs. Taber had intended, established \"to provide better and more complete facilities than had heretofore existed or were likely to exist for thorough education in the higher branches of English knowledge\".<ref>[http://www.sippicanhistoricalsociety.org/Newsltr%20Aug%2003.pdf Tabor Academy profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905100515/http://www.sippicanhistoricalsociety.org/Newsltr%20Aug%2003.pdf |date=September 5, 2008 }}, sippicanhistoricalsociety.org; accessed July 9, 2015.</ref>\n\nThe first headmaster was Clark Phelps Howland of [[Yale University]], who reported in 1884 that \"It is the aim of the school to give thorough instruction, and to encourage in its pupils a desire for the real rather than the showy, and to develop the moral as well as the intellectual element.\" The initial tuition fee for the Academy was $24, or $300 for students who wished to board in the headmaster's home.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} While Elizabeth Taber did not stipulate any particular religious affiliation for the academy, Howland stated that Tabor \"will probably always be under the management of those who sympathize with the Congregational faith.\" Howland was succeeded by Dana Marsh Dustan, [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] B.A. 1880, A.M. 1883 (1893\u20131901), Nathan Chipman Hamblin, [[Harvard University|Harvard]] B.A. 1892 (1901\u20131910) and Charles Edward Pethybridge, [[Amherst College|Amherst]] B.A. 1906 (1910\u20131916).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n'''The Lillard Years'''\n[[Image:SchoolboyFellowship.png|thumb|left|The schoolboys and headmasters of the International Schoolboy Fellowship outside the \u00c9cole du Montcel in summer 1928. [[Walter H.

He believed strongly in a \"balanced preparatory education\" which nurtured both a student's mind and body. The mission of the Academy under Lillard, as stated in a 1922 handbook, was \" To prepare boys to take their proper place in the world of today.\" An emphasis was put on the thoroughness of a Tabor education both inside and outside of the classroom.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nLillard turned Tabor into an all-boys' school and cancelled plans to make the Academy the town of Marion's school {{clarify|date=July 2015}} and vowed to keep it a privately endowed and operated institution.<ref name=\"Maritime Marion page 125\">\"Maritime Marion, MA\" by Judith Westlund Rosbe, page 125</ref> In the 1930s, Lillard orchestrated a trade with the town of Marion. The original Academy buildings were deeded to the town (now the Elizabeth Taber Library and Marion Town Hall) and were traded for the current waterfront location in order to allow the academy to expand and grow. He acquired the surrounding cottages and plots of land in order to secure the academy's future expansion' the area had increased ten-fold by the end of his tenure in 1942.<ref>[http://www.taboracademy.org/podium/default.aspx?t=120504 Tabor Academy website], taboracademy.org; accessed July 9, 2015.</ref> Among other contributions to the school was his design of the current seal of the school, which shows a full rigged ship and the motto \"All-a-taut-o\". He selected the seal as an image to students to \"sail towards broader horizons\" and the motto because of its nautical meaning as the state of a vessel when everything is shipshape and accounted for.<ref name=\"Maritime Marion page 125\"/>\n\nLillard was responsible for the creation of the International Schoolboy Fellowship in 1927, the first established international student exchange program for American schoolboys.<ref name=\"ourstory.info\">[http://www.ourstory.info/library/5-AFSIS/1928/brochure.html ourstory.info]; accessed July 9, 2015.</ref> He was chairman of the program which he formed in conjunction with headmasters from schools in England, France and Germany and eventually invited fifteen other New England prep schools to join as well. He took all boys who \"made good\" during the academic year on the annual cruise to France to partake in the exchange and brought English schoolboys to study at the Academy during the year. Lillard believed that \"One American boy in a French community for a summer brings home a new understanding of French tradition and ideals, which he communicates to his schoolfellows. Friendship and tolerance are bred by intimacy, we cannot begin too young.\"<ref name=\"ourstory.info\"/> After his years at Tabor, Walter \"Cappy\" Lillard went on to work for the United Nations in Vienna as the Chief of the Resettlement Division of the International Refugee Organization.<ref>[http://www.well.com/user/jmalloy/walter_huston_lillard.html Walter Lillard profile], well.com; accessed July 9, 2015.</ref>\n\n'''Tabor today'''<br>\nThe school was, until the late 1940s, a maritime school where uniformed boys performed morning and evening drill as well as pursuing a classical academic curriculum. When it returned to its original ideals as a rigorous, college preparatory boarding and day school, it still retained its status as a Naval Honor School. It was designated a Naval Honor School in 1941 by Secretary of the Navy [[Frank Knox]], and remains only one of two secondary schools which still hold the distinction.<ref>[http://www.taboracademy.org/podium/default.aspx?t=120599 Tabor Academy website], taboracademy.org; accessed July 9, 2015.</ref> Although today's students pursue a collegiate preparatory curriculum in the sciences, maths and humanities, courses are still offered in seamanship, coastal and celestial navigation, naval architecture, lifeboatman training and sail training.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe headmasters who followed Lillard and continued his vision of expansion and growth were James W. Wickenden (1942\u20131976), Peter M. Webster B.A. [[University of Texas|Texas]] M.A.T. Yale (1976\u20131989) and Jay S. Stroud B.A. [[Carleton College]], M.A. [[Dartmouth College]], Ed.M [[Columbia University]] (1989\u20132012). In 2002, Stroud commented on the experience of living and learning at Tabor, \"Our unparalleled location on the edge of the sea creates our metaphor for education. While some of our students literally study marine biology or celestial navigation, sail boats both large and small, row crew shells or swim off Tabor's docks, all our students undertake voyages of the mind and spirit. Tabor reminds us all that daily life is about the largest visions possible. It is about widening the horizon, redefining the possible, developing the courage to undertake great voyages. All of us who live here are fortunate to have both the joy and the possibility of adventure in the tides that rise at our front door every morning. It is the right place for a school.\"<ref>\"Maritime Marion, MA\" by Judith Westlund Rosbe, page 138</ref> Stroud retired after the class of 2012. John Quirk was selected by the Board of Trustees to be the headmaster following Stroud's retirement. Quirk arrived at Tabor following a twenty five-year career on the faculty and administration of the Brooks School in Massachusetts.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Campus==\n[[Image:TaborAcademyLillardHall.jpg|thumb|Lillard Hall dormitory]]\nThe campus and location of the Academy is one of the most recognizable and famous features of Tabor. Its open and ungated campus is divided into three sections by Front Street and Spring Street. The dormitory of Lillard Hall, the Johnson Dining Room, the Fireman Performing Arts Center, Hoyt Hall, the Marine Science Center, the Martin Fields and two underclassmen dormitories form the waterfront portion of the campus. Across Front Street is the academic and athletic core of the campus consisting of the Academic Center, the Hayden Library, the Math and Science Center, the Fish Center for Athletics, the Health Center, the Braitmayer Art Center, the Hoyt Fields, the Admissions House and some dormitories. \"Upper Campus\" is the area across Spring Street and consists of the Wickenden Chapel, a chemistry lab, the Hutchinson tennis courts, the James D. Gowing track, the Chapel fields and [[dormitory|dormitories]] which appear to be cottages or private homes from the outside. The lack of gates and fences creates a blending of the campus with the surrounding village.\n\nThe dormitories at Tabor Academy range from small houses with as few as five students, to larger dormitories with as many as 40 students, each mixed with freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors. Each dormitory has three faculty \"dorm parents\", at least one of whom lives in the dormitory with their family alongside the students. Both single and double rooms are available for students to choose in the housing lottery. Additionally, selective underclassmen serve as proctors who live in the dormitories to assist the younger students with the adjustment to boarding life and to serve as a medium between the students and the faculty.<ref>[http://www.taboracademy.org/podium/default.aspx?t=120565 Tabor Academy website], taboracademy.org; accessed July 9, 2015.</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nTabor offers a program useful at competitive colleges. For a school of its size, the curriculum contains an especially broad spectrum of courses, from introductory levels to honors and 22 [[Advanced Placement Program|AP]] courses to highly sophisticated opportunities for independent work.\n\nTabor offers classes in the traditional [[liberal arts]] fields such as the [[humanities]], [[math]] and the sciences but also [[Greek language|Greek]], [[ichthyology]], [[Chinese language|Mandarin Chinese]], lighting design and numerous [[nautical]] and [[marine science]] courses. In addition to a classical curriculum, Tabor offers elective courses about everything from [[blogging]] to Greek philosophy. If a student exhausts the levels of a course available, the independent study program allows students to pursue a strength to the level they desire. A student will work one on one with a faculty member and create a custom curriculum and syllabus to satisfy their interest.\n\nAmong the many scholarships and accolades available for exceptional Tabor students is the [[Morehead-Cain Scholarship]]. It is the secondary school equivalent of the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and is a full four-year scholarship to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] awarded to one graduating senior every year. There is an [[Outward Bound]] program in which a nominated sophomore takes part each summer. Tabor has a drama exchange program with [[Ellesmere College]] in England. A participant in the exchange program was [[Chris Hawkins]].\n[[image:MarineScienceCtr.png|thumb|right|The Marine Science Center]]\n\nThe waterfront campus of Tabor allows for academic programs and opportunities not possible elsewhere. It is one of the few secondary schools in the United States to offer extensive programs in nautical science and [[oceanology]]. The 2006 issue of ''[[Boston Magazine]]'' rated Tabor as one of the top private schools in the sciences, based on its unique programs in marine science and celestial navigation. Opened for the first time for classes in September 2005, the Marine Science Center is the center of the oceanography and marine science faculties at Tabor. The school also owns ''Tabor Boy'', a {{convert|92|ft|m|adj=on}} Dutch pilot [[schooner]], which is a certified school sailing vessel.\n\nEvery three years Tabor offers the Caribbean Studies Program. Students take a preparatory course in the fall, which readies them for the research and studies they will carry out in the Caribbean. In the winter of that year, students are taken to the [[US Virgin Islands]] in small groups for ten days where they conduct research aboard the S.S.V. ''Tabor Boy'' which is sailed down at the beginning of the program by a crew of Tabor students. The data collected by Tabor students is used by the [[United States Geological Survey]] in its ongoing efforts in the region.\n\n==Athletics==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\nTabor Academy fields 55 different teams in 23 interscholastic sports and another 15 instructional programs. The school has the Fish health and athletic center, which includes an indoor hockey rink, fitness center, weight room, wrestling room, eight squash courts, field house, basketball gymnasium, football field, four basketball courts, student lounge and grill, athletic offices, a resident athletic trainer, locker rooms, team rooms and an attached health center and infirmary. Tabor also has the waterfront on Sippican Harbor in Marion for swimming in the spring and summer months, and is used for the training of the sailing and rowing teams.\n\n[[Image:TaborAcademyHenleyCrew1939.png|thumb|left|The 1939 Tabor Academy crew prepare to board the ''Queen Mary'' to travel to England to win their third championship in the [[Henley Royal Regatta]] in the span of four years]]\n\n===Rowing===\nIn 1919, Tabor was one of the first American prep schools to formally establish a rowing program. The strong rowing history at Tabor dates back almost a century. Both the men's and the women's teams have been active participants in the [[Henley Royal Regatta]] in Henley-on-Thames, UK. The men won the [[Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup]] in 1965, the [[Thames Challenge Cup]] in 1936, 1937 and 1939 and have made it to the finals in both numerous times. In 1939, the ''New York Times'' reported on Tabor's dominance on the international level, stating that \"It is almost a maxim nowadays that either Tabor Academy or [[Kent School]] will win the Thames Challenge Cup race for eight-oared crews.\"<ref>\"FIRST BY 3 LENGTHS\", ''New York Times'', July 9, 1939.</ref> In August 1938, Tabor's status as an international power in schoolboy rowing was confirmed by its participation in one of the first recorded international schoolboy competitions on American waters when a crew of [[Radley College]] oarsmen traveled across the Atlantic via the [[Cunard Line]] [[RMS Aquitania|RMS ''Aquitania'']] to race the Tabor Academy crew on [[Sippican Harbor]] in Marion.<ref>\"RADLEY WILL ROW AUG. 24; English Eight to Meet Tabor Academy at Marion\", ''New York Times'', August 4, 1938.</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1930s and 1940s Tabor competed regionally against rival prep schools, with its strongest rival being [[Kent School]], faced in numerous Henley finals and American championship regattas. During this period, in order to seek out a higher level of competition, Tabor raced against crews from [[Harvard University]], Yale University and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|M.I.T.]] The relationship between Tabor and Harvard can be traced back to 1931 when Tabor traveled to England with the Harvard crew to race at Henley and used one of the Crimson's shells in competition.<ref>\"Tabor Crew to Compete in English Henley; Plans to Use Harvard Shell in Thames Race\", ''New York Times'', June 2, 1931.</ref>\n\n[[Image:1918TaborCrew.png|thumb|right|A crew of four Tabor boys rows on Sippican Harbor in 1918.]]\nIn 1951, Tabor was one of the original founding members of the New England Interscholastic Rowing Association along with [[Belmont Hill]], [[Choate Rosemary Hall|Choate]], [[the Gunnery]], [[Salisbury School|Salisbury]], [[St. George's School, Newport|St. George's]], [[Buckingham Browne & Nichols|Browne & Nichols]], [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], [[Pomfret School|Pomfret]], South Kent, [[St. Mark's School (Massachusetts)|St. Mark's]], [[Kent School|Kent]], the Halcyon and Shattuck clubs from [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's]], and Shrewsbury.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIn 1967, the Tabor oarsmen were poised to win their second Henley victory in three years. Rowing hard races until the finals they faced a well-rested [[Eton College]] crew and lost by \u00be of one boatlength. Another famous race was the 1947 [[Thames Challenge Cup]] final at Henley. Coming after the destruction of World War II, many of the British crews did not have sufficient food after war rationing. Tabor thought the honorable decision was to train under the same calorific restrictions as the British crews. They still managed to reach the finals where they lost to traditional rival Kent School, who brought along their own provisions from the US, but won wide support from the British fans and press for their sportsmanship.<ref>Jay S. Stroud, ''Tabor Today''<!-- more info needed --></ref>\n\nTabor is one of eleven schools to have a guest room at the famed [[Leander Club]], in Henley-on-Thames. Each room is named after, designed in the colors of and features various memorabilia from a major rowing school or university. Among the other schools with rooms at Leander are Harvard, Yale, Brown, Oxford, Cambridge and Kent. In recent years, Tabor has continued to win NEIRA championships, win invitations to the USRowing Youth National Championships and travel to England to race at the Henley Royal Regatta on a regular basis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://taboracademy.myschoolapp.com/app/student#newsdetail/1112760/0/0/0|title=Tabor Crew Competes in Henley Royal Regatta|last=Kasparak|first=Chris|date=June 28, 2017|website=Tabor Academy|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Ice hockey===\nTabor's men's [[ice hockey]] team, three time New England Champions, has produced over 24 [[NCAA]] Division 1 and [[NHL]] caliber players over the years.

The boys were the 2007 National High School Class B Team Champions and the girls were the 2009 New England Class B Team Squash Champions and have performed impressively at the National Championships.\n\n===Sailing===\nThe Tabor sailing team is consistently strong, having won several national championships and having produced Olympic medalists such as [[Charlie Ogletree]] who won silver at the [[2004 Olympic Games]] in Athens, Greece. The team has won the National High School Team Racing Championship (the \"Baker Trophy\") seven times since the event's founding in 1989 (1989, 1990, 1991, 1995, 1997, 2007 and 2011), shared it with [[Miami Palmetto High School]], a public school in Miami, Florida, in 1994, and has won the National High School Dinghy Championship (the \"Mallory Trophy\") six times since the event's founding in 1930 (1977, 1978, 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1986). In 1999, the sailing team won the New England Sailing \"triple crown\" and completed a record 19\u20130 season.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n===Wrestling===\nThe Tabor wrestling program has also enjoyed a successful history under the direction of coach Dr. F. Timothy Walsh. Walsh was recently inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame for his illustrious career while a coach at [[Amherst College]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|M.I.T.]] and Tabor. He finished his last four years at Tabor with a 72\u201312 record and during his tenure won numerous Class A championships and produced many National Prep School All Americans, and more National Prep Champions than any other New England Prep School as of 2011. The program has also enjoyed recent success both in the Class A league, as well as in New England under the new head coach, former Tabor wrestler and national prep champion, Conan Leary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.taboracademy.org/page/team-detail-winter?fromId=187496&Team=87302&SeasonLabel=2016+-+2017|title=Team Detail (Winter) {{!}} Tabor Academy|website=www.taboracademy.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-08}}</ref>\n\n===Basketball===\nSince the early 1990s, the boys' and girls' basketball teams have consistently been competitive in Class A of the [[New England Preparatory School Athletic Council]].\n\nFormer Seawolves are currently playing for [[NCAA]] Division I, II and III schools such as the [[University of Connecticut]], the [[University of South Carolina]], [[Harvard University]], [[Columbia University]], [[Brown University]], [[Princeton University]], [[the University of Pennsylvania]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Georgetown University]], [[Dartmouth College]], Amherst College, [[Williams College]], [[Colby College]], [[Middlebury College]] among others.\n\nStudents can choose from the following sports and non-active alternatives.

Every year a new freshman class enrolls, as well as a large number of new sophomores and to a lesser extent, new juniors and seniors. About 75 percent of those students live in [[Dormitory|dormitories]] on campus while the remaining 25 percent are day students who live at home and commute to the school. A large part of the community at Tabor is the international students who come from around the world to learn at the Academy. There are students and faculty who live in North and South America, the Caribbean, Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and the Middle East.\n\n'''The ''S.S.V. Tabor Boy'''''\n\nThe academy utilizes its extensive waterfront facilities to house Tabor's 92' schooner ''''S.S.V. Tabor Boy''''. The Tabor Boy is one of the most famous and recognizable features of the school. The roots of the program were founded in 1917 when then headmaster W.H. Lillard loaned two {{convert|31|ft|m|adj=on}} cutters from the U.S. Navy to develop the academy's nautical programs. In 1925, \"The Tabor Boy Trust\" was formed to raise funds to purchase an 88' schooner for the school's use. In 1933, Headmaster Lillard, Captain Lewis and 18 students sailed the Tabor Boy up the [[Hudson River]], through the [[New York State Barge Canal|New York State Canal System]] and down the [[Great Lakes]] to show the Tabor Boy off in an eight-week exhibition at the [[Century of Progress|World's Fair]] in Chicago.<ref>\"Sea Scouting: Cruise to the Century of Progress\" Boys' Life Magazine, September 1933</ref>\n\nThe runaway success of the nautical-training and deep-water cruising programs that the ''Tabor Boy'' provided led the school to purchase the ''Eldu II'', soon to be renamed the ''Tabor Boy II'', in 1945. The boat was raced in numerous Newport-to-Bermuda regattas by Tabor students until it was retired in 1954. In 1954, the boat was replaced with the current vessel, a 92\u2019 Dutch Pilot Schooner, still referred to as ''Tabor Boy'' and has since logged tens of thousands of miles.<ref>\"Maritime Marion, MA\" by Judith Westlund Rosbe, page 128</ref> The boat is moored in Sippican Harbor and is in regular use with fall and spring all-student crews as well as the Freshman Orientation at Sea and Caribbean Studies programs.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n'''Beyond the Classroom'''\n\nThere are many activities for students to participate in on the weekends as well as some weeknights. On the weekends there are usually school-sponsored trips to either Providence or Boston, which are both less than an hour from campus by bus. Also, there are activities such as vans to the local cinema, trips to the mall or local restaurants. On campus, there are usually a combination of dances, dorm activities, film screenings, hypnotists, visiting bands, intramural sports competitions and other various events. Every night the Beebe Grill is open in the Fish Center for students to get something to eat after study hall, or a place where there are musical performances and dances on the weekends. In the spring, the waterfront is opened used by students to take out boats for the afternoon or to go swimming off the docks and in the winter students can use the Travis Roy Rink for skating on weekend nights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.taboracademy.org/page/campus-life/weekends-at-tabor|title=Weekends at Tabor {{!}} Tabor Academy|website=www.taboracademy.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-08}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, Tabor Academy is located walking distance from Silvershell Beach, where students can have a picnic on the beach, take a quick jog, and pick up ice cream from the Marion General Store on the way.\n\n'''A global education'''\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nStudents are given the opportunity to attend an English boarding school for one year, as a gap year, after graduation through the [[English Speaking Union]]. Through this exchange, each year one student from England comes to campus as a full member of senior class for the entirety of the school year. Every year a few students elect to go abroad for one year through the [[School Year Abroad]] program to locations such as China, Italy, France, Spain, India, and Vietnam. During the year abroad they immerse themselves in the local culture and language while pursuing a rigorous academic curriculum.\n\n==On-campus traditions and events==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nTabor has had long history of events and activities that have become campus traditions: Tabor-[[Holderness]] Day, First Snow, and Springfest are examples. Twice every week the entire school community gathers in Wickenden Chapel for a chapel service. It is not a religious service, rather it serves as a time for the entire community to gather together, sing the Alma Mater and listen to a speech. The speeches are given by students and faculty and can be comedic, tragic, nostalgic, philosophical, shocking and everything in between.\n\nOn the last school night before Thanksgiving break, the academy puts on a full Thanksgiving feast for the school and decorates the dining hall with traditional trappings of the holiday. A similar feast is held on the morning the students depart for the winter vacation, a traditional Christmas breakfast is put on in the dining hall with all the decorations one would expect from a proper holiday celebration.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe school holds an annual service of [[Nine Lessons and Carols]] similar to the famous one held yearly at [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] at [[Cambridge University]]. The service is widely attended in Wickenden Chapel by not only faculty and students but with residents from the surrounding towns.\n\nSpring at Tabor is defined by Springfest. One day in spring right before graduation the waterfront fields are turned into a fair of sorts. The docks are littered with students sunbathing and swimming, the fields are filled with everything from volleyball nets, to waterslides, to a rock climbing wall, and stages are set up and bands are brought in that play into the night.\n\n'''The Tabor Academy Alma Mater'''\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n''Hail, dear old Tabor!''\n\n''Noble and strong,''\n\n''To thee with loyal hearts''\n\n''We raise our song.''\n\n''Swelling to Heaven''\n\n''Loud our praises ring;''\n\n''Hail, dear old Tabor!''\n\n''Of thee we sing.''\n\n''Broad seas before us lie.''\n\n''We ride the gale;''\n\n''With eyes bright, hands alert,''\n\n''and close-trimmed sail''\n\n''Later upon life's voyage,''\n\n''Our skill we'll try''\n\n''Hail, Tabor; All-a-taut-o is our cry!''\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nThe alumni of Tabor have a farreaching influence in a number of different fields.
