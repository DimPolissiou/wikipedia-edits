The album also featured cover versions of songs recorded by other artists. Its second track was a cover of [[Jackie DeShannon]]'s \"[[Put a Little Love in Your Heart]]\" and its eighth track was a cover of [[Ivory Joe Hunter]]'s \"[[Since I Met You Baby (song)|Since I Met You Baby]]\".<ref name=\"Discogs\">{{cite web |title=Bill Anderson and Jan Howard -- ''If It's All the Same to You'' (1970, Vinyl) |url=https://www.discogs.com/Bill-Anderson-And-Jan-Howard-If-Its-All-The-Same-To-You/release/3510640 |website=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=26 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe album's liner notes were written by booking agent, Hubert Long.

The ''[[Gauleiter]]'' of Munich, [[Paul Giesler]], ordered [[Bertus Gerdes]], administrator of Upper Bavaria, to prepare plans for the extermination of the surviving prisoners. Gerdes prevaricated, citing the lack of airplane fuel and ammunition as well as poor weather. In response, Kaltenbrunner ordered that the Kaufering prisoners be taken to Dachau main camp, where they were to be poisoned. Gerdes ordered a local doctor to prepare poison, but this plan could not be implemented either.

was a system of eleven [[subcamp (SS)|subcamp]]s of the [[Dachau concentration camp]] located around the town of [[Landsberg am Lech]] in [[Bavaria]], which operated between 18 June 1944 and 27 April 1945. Previously, Nazi Germany had deported all Jews from the Reich, but having exhausted other sources of labor, Jews were deported to Kaufering to create three massive underground bunkers, [[Weingut II]], Diana II, and Walnuss II, which would not be vulnerable to the [[strategic bombing in World War II|Allied bombing]] which had devastated German aircraft factories. The bunkers were intended for the production of [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] aircraft, but none were produced at the camps before the [[United States Army]] liberated the area.\n\nKaufering was the largest of the Dachau subcamps and also the one with the worst conditions; about half of the 30,000 prisoners died from hunger, disease, executions, or during the [[death marches (Holocaust)|death marches]]. Most of the sites were not preserved and have been repurposed for other uses.\n\n==Establishment==\n[[File:Weingut I 1945 internal view.jpg|thumb|left|Internal view of [[Weingut I]], the bunker at M\u00fchldorf]]\nIn early 1944, [[Strategic bombing in World War II|Allied bombing raids]] had reduced the [[fighter aircraft]] production of German factories by as much as two-thirds.{{sfn|Raim|2009|p=488}} In order to reduce the effectiveness of Allied bombing, the [[J\u00e4gerstab]], a task force of the [[Reich Ministry of Armaments and War Production]] for increasing fighter production, planned to move production underground.<ref name=\"USHMM\" /> Existing underground areas, such as caves and mines, were not suited to factory production, so new concrete bunkers were to be built, using concentration camp prisoners for labor.{{sfn|Raim|2009|p=488}} The area around [[Landsberg am Lech]] in Bavaria, where the Kaufering subcamps were established, was selected for this project due to its favorable geology;<ref name=\"USHMM\" /> there was a layer of gravel up to {{convert|10|m}} thick, and the [[water table]] was below {{convert|13|m}}.{{sfn|Fenner|2012|p=133}} Out of six planned bunkers, three began construction at Kaufering and another at nearby [[M\u00fchldorf concentration camp]].{{sfn|Raim|2009|p=488}}\n\nPreviously, Nazi Germany had attempted to make the Reich ''[[Judenrein]]'' (\"cleansed of Jews\") by deporting all Jews to eastern areas. However, they had exhausted other sources of forced labor, so Jews were deported to the Reich to work on the new project. Kaufering I, later redesignated Kaufering III, was established by a transport of 1,000 [[Hungarian Jewish]] men from [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] that arrived in [[Kaufering]], Bavaria, on 18 June 1944. [[Prisoner functionaries]] were brought from Dachau to manage the new camp.{{sfn|Raim|2009|pp=488\u2013489}}\n\n==Forced labor==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 141-2497, Flugzeug Me 262A auf Flugplatz.jpg|thumb|The purpose of the camp was to produce [[Messerschmitt Me 262]]A aircraft.]]\nUnusually, the construction of the camps, as well as providing food and medical care, was the responsibility of the [[Organization Todt]] (OT), not the SS, which sought to extract the maximum labor for the minimum expense. The prisoners deported to each camp had to construct the accommodation themselves,{{sfn|Raim|2009|p=489}} The resulting huts, partially buried for camouflage from aerial reconnaissance,<ref name=\"USHMM\" /> were completely inadequate for the weather conditions. Rain and snow leaked through the earthen roofs, and vermin infested the huts.{{sfn|Raim|2009|p=489}} Prisoners had to sleep in straw spread on the floor.{{sfn|Fenner|2012|p=145}} Of Dachau's subcamps, Kaufering had the worst conditions.{{sfn|Bazyler|Tuerkheimer|2015|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BMtRCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA83 83]}}\n\nMost prisoners were forced to work building railway embankments and hauling bags of cement for the bunker-building projects,{{sfn|Raim|2009|p=489}} codenamed Weingut II, Diana II and Walnuss II.{{sfn|Uziel|2011|p=136}} Weingut II was {{convert|400|m}} long and {{convert|28.4|m}} high (more than five stories), with a concrete roof {{convert|3|m}} thick. The roof had been planned to be {{convert|5|m}} thick, but that was pared down due to lack of materials. The total floor area would be {{convert|95000|m2}}; the Augsburg factory that it intended to replace had only {{convert|12700|m2}} of floor area in three dispersal locations. For protection from air raids, 40% of the bunker was underground and its roof was covered with dirt for camouflage. At least 10,000 Jewish prisoners worked on the bunker at some point.{{sfn|Uziel|2011|p=137}}\n\n[[File:Weingut II external view.png|thumb|left|External view of the [[Weingut II]] bunker]]\nThe bunkers were to be used for producing different components of the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]]A aircraft, the first operational [[jet aircraft]], which the Germans hoped would turn the tide of war against the Allies.{{sfn|Raim|2009|p=488}}{{sfn|Uziel|2011|p=136}} [[Messerschmitt AG]] hoped to produce 900 Me 262 aircraft and additional [[Me 163]]B rocket-powered aircraft at Kaufering,{{sfn|Uziel|2011|p=136}}{{sfn|Schwartz|2011|p=138}} by employing 10,000 workers per shift in each bunker, 90,000 in all, of whom one-third were to be concentration camp prisoners. However, the construction of Diana II and Walnuss II was not finished due to the lack of concrete and steel.{{sfn|Uziel|2011|p=136}} When the United States liberated the area in April 1945, the excavation of Weingut II was not complete, but already production machines had been set up.{{sfn|Uziel|2011|p=137}}  However, not a single aircraft was produced before liberation.{{sfn|Morgan|1994|p=48}}\n\nThe murderous conditions meant that most prisoners were incapacitated in a short time, and OT and construction workers brutally beat victims in order to extract labor. Most prisoners were forced to work building railway embankments and hauling bags of cement for the bunker-building projects.{{sfn|Raim|2009|p=489}} OT workers complained that, due to severe vermin infestation, prisoners spent time attempting to rid themselves of fleas when they were supposed to be working.{{sfn|Fenner|2012|p=145}} In December 1944, an OT staff member observed that of 17,600 prisoners, only 8,319 were capable of work, including those only capable of light work. Because the companies that hired the workers complained that they had to pay for the labor of prisoners unable to work, transports totaling 1,322{{sfn|Raim|2009|p=489}} or 1,451 people were dispatched to Auschwitz in September and October 1944, where the victims were gassed.{{sfn|Fenner|2012|p=135}}\n\n==Command and organization==\nThe SS hierarchy at Kaufering had mostly served at eastern death camps, such as [[Majdanek]] and Auschwitz, which had been liberated by the Red Army. The first commandant, [[Heinrich Forster]], had previously worked at Sachsenhausen, Dachau, and [[Kovno concentration camp]]s. Forster was replaced in December 1944 by [[Hans Aumeier]], former deputy commandant of Auschwitz and commandant of [[Vaivara concentration camp]]. In February 1945, [[Otto F\u00f6rschner]], former commandant of [[Mittelbau-Dora]], took over command of Kaufering. The camp doctor was {{interlanguage link|Max Blancke|de||pl}}, who had worked at multiple concentration camps.{{sfn|Raim|2009|p=489}} Architect [[Hermann Giesler]], a close associate of [[Adolf Hitler]], was in charge of the bunker construction.{{sfn|Raim|2009|p=488}}\n\nConsisting of eleven subcamps, Kaufering was the largest of the Dachau subcamp systems,{{sfn|Raim|2009|p=488}} and probably the largest Jewish subcamp system in the Reich.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=845}}\n\n===List of Kaufering subcamps===\n[[File:Gate of Kaufering I after liberation.jpg|thumb|Gate of Kaufering I with American soldier]]\n[[File:Kaufering IV on the day of liberation.jpg|thumb|Kaufering IV on the day of liberation]]\n{{bulleted list|'''Kaufering I''' (before late September, designated Kaufering III) was opened on 22 June 1944 and served as the headquarters of the Kaufering command from September. Located near [[Landsberg am Lech]], the main purpose of this camp was the construction of bunker [[Weingut II]]. Between 2000 and 5000 men lived there; in February 1945, 200 women also arrived there. Because of overcrowding, Kaufering XI was established and some prisoners moved.{{sfn|Fenner|2012|p=136}} A group of seven Hungarian Jewish women, known as the \"Schwanger Kommando\", who had conceived before their deportation to Auschwitz, was allowed to remain alive and bear their children.{{sfn|Raim|2009|p=489}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Group portrait of five Hungarian Jewish mothers and their infants in a Dachau sub-camp in Germany. |url=https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/pa23340 |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=11 January 2019}}</ref> |\n'''Kaufering II''' was established on 24 August. Its prisoners, about 1200 men and women, mostly worked at the \"Diana II\" construction site. The camp existed at two locations, a summer camp built with plywood and a later camp, occupied during the winter months, which offered slightly better protection against the winter weather.{{sfn|Fenner|2012|pp=136\u2013137}}|\n'''Kaufering III''' (designated Kaufering I until September) was the original Kaufering camp, located near [[Kaufering]] and established by 1000 Hungarian Jewish men from Auschwitz on 18 June. These prisoners were forced to build their own accommodation. Later, prisoners were forced to work on the Weingut II bunker as well as the construction of Kaufering I and II. It served as the SS headquarters of the Kaufering complex until this was moved to Kaufering I in September 1944. The average population was 2000 men and 339 women. The senior prisoner was Victor Ne\u010das, an Austrian political prisoner who communicated with the prisoners mostly in Hungarian.{{sfn|Fenner|2012|p=137}}|\n'''Kaufering IV''' <small><nowiki>[</nowiki>[[:de:KZ-Kommando Kaufering IV|de]], [[:he:\u05e7\u05d0\u05d5\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05e0\u05d2|he]], [[:pl:Kaufering IV|pl]]<nowiki>]</nowiki></small>, located between Kaufering and [[Hurlach]], was established in September 1944 for 500 prisoners; the population later grew to 3000. Prisoners were forced to work at the Lagerlechfeld airfield, in road construction, and on the bunker Walnuss II until Kaufering IV was converted into a \"sick camp\", where prisoners were sent to die after they could no longer work.{{sfn|Fenner|2012|pp=137\u2013138}} A typhus epidemic broke out, and Dr. Blancke and the SS guards would not enter the barracks to avoid infection. Prisoner doctors could do little, as they had no medicine or equipment.{{sfn|Fenner|2012|p=153}}|\n'''Kaufering V''', near [[Utting]], has an unclear history due to inconsistent testimony from survivors. It is possible that it was only a subarea of Kaufering X, such as the kitchen, rather than a separate subcamp.{{sfn|Fenner|2012|p=138}}|\n'''Kaufering VI''' <small><nowiki>[</nowiki>[[:de:KZ-Au\u00dfenlager Kaufering VI|de]]<nowiki>]</nowiki></small> was established in October 1944 at [[T\u00fcrkheim]], and housed between 1000 and 2500 prisoners, who were forced to work clearing nearby forests, in agriculture, and in construction. Many of the prisoners were later transported to other Kaufering subcamps to work on the bunkers.{{sfn|Fenner|2012|p=138}}|\n'''Kaufering VII''' was established on 11 November 1944 near the offices of [[Held & Francke]]. Between 2000 to 3000 men and 118 to 272 women were forced to live in huts and clay bunkers and work on prefabricated parts for \"Diana II\". After a typhus epidemic, sick prisoners were taken to Kaufering IV.{{sfn|Fenner|2012|pp=138\u2013139}}|\n'''Kaufering VIII''', at {{interlanguage link|Seestall|de|Seestall (Fuchstal)}}, was probably established as a mistake on the Germans' part, because the local soil was not suitable for the construction of bunkers. It was smaller than the other camps, and prisoners were forced to work on agriculture and gravel extraction.{{sfn|Fenner|2012|p=139}}|\n'''Kaufering IX''' was a men's camp that existed from 14 October 1944 in [[Obermeitingen]].

Other Kaufering prisoners had survived four years in the [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto]] and a selection at Auschwitz.{{sfn|Blatman|2011|p=203}} On 10 October 1944, a transport of Jewish men who had been imprisoned at the [[Theresienstadt Ghetto]] in the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] arrived via Auschwitz.{{sfn|K\u00e1rn\u00fd|1995|pp=15, 28, 34}} Other Jewish prisoners were from the Netherlands, France, Italy, or [[Rhodes]].{{sfn|Raim|2009|p=489}}\n\nSome of the food allotted to prisoners was diverted by SS guards, further reducing the nutrient intake of prisoners. Those who were sick, with diseases such as typhus, spotted fever, and tuberculosis that were widespread in the camp, were fed even less,{{sfn|Raim|2009|p=489}} and rations were further reduced as the war drew to an end and shortages arose.{{sfn|Fenner|2012|p=148}} Conditions were too harsh for a resistance movement to develop. However, survivors of the Kovno Ghetto continued to publish a clandestine newspaper, ''Nitsots'' (Spark), handwritten and illegally distributed.{{sfn|Raim|2009|p=490}} [[Elkhanan Elkes]], head of the ''[[Judenrat]]'' at Kovno, was the camp elder of Kaufering I, where he died.{{sfn|Raim|2009|p=490}}{{sfn|Fenner|2012|p=157}}\n\nA commission established after the war estimated that 14,500 Kaufering prisoners had died. German historian Edith Raim wrote that about half of the 30,000 prisoners died before liberation. The main causes of death were hunger, disease, execution, deportation to Auschwitz, and the death marches.{{sfn|Raim|2009|p=490}}{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=846}} According to American historian [[Daniel Blatman]], about 4,300 of those victims died at Kaufering itself; additional victims were sent to Dachau after becoming unable to work, or were killed during the death marches.{{sfn|Blatman|2011|p=202}}\n\n==Death marches==\n[[File:Survivors of Kaufering I.png|thumb|Survivors liberated at Kaufering I]]\nAs Allied troops approached, rumors circulated among the prisoners that the Germans were going to massacre them before liberation. In mid-April, SS general [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]] relayed orders from [[Adolf Hitler]] for the [[Luftwaffe]] to bomb Dachau, Landsberg, and M\u00fchldorf, which all had high Jewish populations. The ''[[Gauleiter]]'' of Munich, [[Paul Giesler]], ordered [[Bertus Gerdes]], administrator of Upper Bavaria, to prepare plans for the extermination of the surviving prisoners. Gerdes prevaricated, citing the lack of airplane fuel and ammunition as well as poor weather. In response, Kaltenbrunner ordered that the Kaufering prisoners be taken to Dachau main camp, where they were to be poisoned. Gerdes ordered a local doctor to prepare poison, but this plan could not be implemented either. The third plan was to take the prisoners to [[\u00d6tztal|\u00d6tz Valley]] in the Alps, where they were to be murdered \"in one way or another\".{{sfn|Schwartz|2011|p=133}}\n\nAccording to German records, 10,114 prisoners, including 1,093 women, were at Kaufering camps during the last week of April. Most of them were evacuated to Dachau or locations further south, either on foot or by train.{{sfn|Schwartz|2011|p=138}} Prisoners faced a difficult choice of whether to join the [[death marches (Holocaust)|death marches]] or to try to stay behind, knowing that they might be massacred. On the death marches, anyone who could not keep up was beaten or shot, leading to many deaths.{{sfn|Fenner|2012|p=152}}<ref name=\"USHMM\" /> The evacuation was disorderly, and many prisoners succeeded in escaping during the roundups at the camp or later, when the columns were attacked by American aircraft.{{sfn|Blatman|2011|p=204}} On 23 April, 1,200 prisoners left Kaufering VI (T\u00fcrkheim) on foot and joined the prisoners forced on a death march from Dachau's main camp. Another 1,500 prisoners left Kaufering the next day, proceeding at first on foot and later by train. On multiple occasions, the prisoners were attacked by Allied aircraft. In one of these attacks, which hit a train carrying ammunition as well as prisoners, hundreds of victims were killed. Some of the prisoners evacuated from Kaufering ended up at [[Allach concentration camp]].{{sfn|Schwartz|2011|p=138}}\n\nHundreds of the evacuees from Kaufering arrived at [[Buchberg labor camp]] (south of [[Wolfratshausen]]) on 29 April. [[Otto Moll]], a functionary of Kaufering, attempted to massacre these prisoners but was foiled by the camp commander. Instead Moll killed 120 or 150 Russian prisoners from Buchberg.{{sfn|Schwartz|2011|p=146}} Many of those who left Kaufering were liberated at Dachau on 28 April, but others were forced to march southwards into [[Upper Bavaria]] and were not freed until May. Kaufering IV, where those incapable of walking were held, was set on fire on the orders of the SS doctor, Max Blancke.{{sfn|Raim|2009|p=490}} Hundreds of sick and emaciated prisoners were trapped inside and killed. Shortly afterwards, Blancke committed suicide.{{sfn|Fenner|2012|p=153}}\n\n<Gallery caption=\"Kaufering after liberation\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"180px\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Charred corpses of prisoners after liberation of Kaufering IV.jpg|Charred corpses at Kaufering IV\nFile:German civilians forced to bury Kaufering IV victims.jpg|German civilians forced to bury victims\nFile:Schwanger Kommando after liberation.jpg|Five of the \"Schwanger Kommando\" women after liberation\n</gallery>\n\n==Liberation and aftermath==\n[[File:Liberation of Kaufering IV.webm|thumb|Liberation of Kaufering IV; US Army newsreel made after the liberation]]\n[[File:Kaufering I (Landsberg) liberation and burials.webm|thumb|Kaufering I (Landsberg) liberation and burials]]\nThe subcamps of Kaufering were liberated between 24 and 27 April by the [[Seventh United States Army]].{{sfn|Fenner|2012|p=152}}\n\nThe [[12th Armored Division]] reached Kaufering IV on 27 April, with the [[101st Airborne Division]] arriving the next day.<ref name=\"USHMM\"/> The [[Japanese-American service in World War II#522nd Field Artillery Battalion|522nd Field Artillery Battalion]], which consisted entirely of Japanese Americans, also participated in the liberation,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Medoff |first1=Rafael |title=FDR's Views on Japanese Offer a Window Into Why He Wouldn't Save Jews |url=https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/162780/roosevelt-japanese-internment |accessdate=11 January 2019 |work=Tablet Magazine |date=14 February 2014 |language=en}}</ref> as did the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Infantry Division]] from 30 April.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 36th Infantry Division |url=https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-36th-infantry-division |publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] |accessdate=29 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref> The liberators found 500 charred corpses, many of them naked, which they forced local German residents to bury.<ref name=\"USHMM\" />{{sfn|Fenner|2012|p=153}} The remaining structures were \"indescribably filthy\" because dying prisoners had been left there.
