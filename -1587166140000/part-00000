Barkun writes that conspiracies are \"actual covert plots planned and/or carried out by two or more persons\". A conspiracy theory, on the other hand, is \"an intellectual construct\", a \"template imposed upon the world to give the appearance of order to events\". Positing that \"some small and hidden group\" has manipulated events, a conspiracy theory can be local or international, focused on single events or covering multiple incidents and entire countries, regions and periods of history. Conspiracy theorists see themselves as having privileged access to special knowledge or a special mode of thought that separates them from the masses who believe the official account.<ref name=\"Barkun2016\">{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/0392192116669288|title=Conspiracy Theories as Stigmatized Knowledge|journal=Diogenes|pages=039219211666928|year=2016|last1=Barkun|first1=Michael}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n{{See|List of conspiracy theories}}\nA conspiracy theory may take any matter as its subject, but certain subjects attract greater interest than others.

This refers to limited and well-defined events.  Examples may include such conspiracies theories as those concerning the [[Kennedy assassination conspiracies|Kennedy assassination]], [[9/11]], and the [[discredited AIDS origins theories|spread of AIDS]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}\n* ''Systemic conspiracy theories''.  The conspiracy is believed to have broad goals, usually conceived as securing control of a country, a region, or even the entire world. The goals are sweeping, whilst the conspiratorial machinery is generally simple: a single, evil organization implements a plan to infiltrate and subvert existing institutions. This is a common scenario in conspiracy theories that focus on the alleged machinations of [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Jews]], [[Masonic conspiracy theories|Freemasons]], [[Red Scare|Communism]], or the [[Vatican conspiracy theories|Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}\n* ''Superconspiracy theories''. For Barkun, such theories link multiple alleged conspiracies together hierarchically.  At the summit is a distant but all-powerful evil force.  His cited examples are the ideas of [[David Icke]] and [[Milton William Cooper]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}\n\n'''Bold text'''=== Rothbard: shallow vs. deep ===\n[[Murray Rothbard]] argues in favor of a model that contrasts \"deep\" conspiracy theories to \"shallow\" ones. According to Rothbard, a \"shallow\" theorist observes an event and asks ''[[Cui bono]]''? (\"Who benefits?\"), jumping to the conclusion that a posited beneficiary is responsible for covertly influencing events.THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING TO AMERICA WITH PEACE OFFERING TO DONALD J TRUMP  On the other hand, the \"deep\" conspiracy theorist begins with a hunch and then seeks out evidence. Rothbard describes this latter activity as a matter of confirming with certain facts one's initial paranoia.<ref>As quoted by B.K. Marcus in \"[https://mises.org/journals/jls/20_2/20_2_2.pdf Radio Free Rothbard],\" ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', Vol 20, No 2. (SPRING 2006): pp 17\u201351.

A fundamental paradox of the paranoid style is the imitation of the enemy. The enemy, for example, may be the cosmopolitan intellectual, but the paranoid will outdo him in the apparatus of scholarship, even of pedantry.&nbsp;...&nbsp;The Ku Klux Klan imitated Catholicism to the point of donning priestly vestments, developing an elaborate ritual and an equally elaborate hierarchy.

Spokesmen of the various fundamentalist anti-Communist \"crusades\" openly express their admiration for the dedication, discipline, and strategic ingenuity the Communist cause calls forth.<ref name=\"harpers=1964\"/>}}\n\nHofstadter also noted that \"sexual freedom\" is a vice frequently attributed to the conspiracist's target group, noting that \"very often the fantasies of true believers reveal strong sadomasochistic outlets, vividly expressed, for example, in the delight of anti-Masons with the cruelty of Masonic punishments.\"<ref name=\"harpers=1964\">{{cite book|author=Hofstadter, Richard|author-link=Richard Hofstadter|year=1965|title=The Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays|location=New York|publisher=Alfred A.

While the complete facts of the situation and correct methodology are ostensibly important to them, Latour proposes that the scientific process is instead laid on as a patina to one's pet theories to lend a sort of reputation high ground.

Barkun writes that conspiracies are \"actual covert plots planned and/or carried out by two or more persons\". A conspiracy theory, on the other hand, is \"an intellectual construct\", a \"template imposed upon the world to give the appearance of order to events\". Positing that \"some small and hidden group\" has manipulated events, a conspiracy theory can be local or international, focused on single events or covering multiple incidents and entire countries, regions and periods of history. Conspiracy theorists see themselves as having privileged access to special knowledge or a special mode of thought that separates them from the masses who believe the official account.<ref name=\"Barkun2016\">{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/0392192116669288|title=Conspiracy Theories as Stigmatized Knowledge|journal=Diogenes|pages=039219211666928|year=2016|last1=Barkun|first1=Michael}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n{{See|List of conspiracy theories}}\nA conspiracy theory may take any matter as its subject, but certain subjects attract greater interest than others.

This refers to limited and well-defined events.  Examples may include such conspiracies theories as those concerning the [[Kennedy assassination conspiracies|Kennedy assassination]], [[9/11]], and the [[discredited AIDS origins theories|spread of AIDS]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}\n* ''Systemic conspiracy theories''.  The conspiracy is believed to have broad goals, usually conceived as securing control of a country, a region, or even the entire world. The goals are sweeping, whilst the conspiratorial machinery is generally simple: a single, evil organization implements a plan to infiltrate and subvert existing institutions. This is a common scenario in conspiracy theories that focus on the alleged machinations of [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Jews]], [[Masonic conspiracy theories|Freemasons]], [[Red Scare|Communism]], or the [[Vatican conspiracy theories|Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}\n* ''Superconspiracy theories''. For Barkun, such theories link multiple alleged conspiracies together hierarchically.  At the summit is a distant but all-powerful evil force.  His cited examples are the ideas of [[David Icke]] and [[Milton William Cooper]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}\n\n=== Rothbard: shallow vs. deep ===\n[[Murray Rothbard]] argues in favor of a model that contrasts \"deep\" conspiracy theories to \"shallow\" ones. According to Rothbard, a \"shallow\" theorist observes an event and asks ''[[Cui bono]]''? (\"Who benefits?\"), jumping to the conclusion that a posited beneficiary is responsible for covertly influencing events.  On the other hand, the \"deep\" conspiracy theorist begins with a hunch and then seeks out evidence. Rothbard describes this latter activity as a matter of confirming with certain facts one's initial paranoia.<ref>As quoted by B.K. Marcus in \"[https://mises.org/journals/jls/20_2/20_2_2.pdf Radio Free Rothbard],\" ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', Vol 20, No 2. (SPRING 2006): pp 17\u201351.

This projection, according to the argument, is manifested in the form of attribution of undesirable characteristics of the self to the conspirators. Historian Richard Hofstadter stated that:\n\n{{quote|This enemy seems on many counts a projection of the self; both the ideal and the unacceptable aspects of the self are attributed to him. A fundamental paradox of the paranoid style is the imitation of the enemy. The enemy, for example, may be the cosmopolitan intellectual, but the paranoid will outdo him in the apparatus of scholarship, even of pedantry.&nbsp;...&nbsp;The Ku Klux Klan imitated Catholicism to the point of donning priestly vestments, developing an elaborate ritual and an equally elaborate hierarchy. The [[John Birch Society]] emulates Communist cells and quasi-secret operation through \"front\" groups, and preaches a ruthless prosecution of the ideological war along lines very similar to those it finds in the Communist enemy. Spokesmen of the various fundamentalist anti-Communist \"crusades\" openly express their admiration for the dedication, discipline, and strategic ingenuity the Communist cause calls forth.<ref name=\"harpers=1964\"/>}}\n\nHofstadter also noted that \"sexual freedom\" is a vice frequently attributed to the conspiracist's target group, noting that \"very often the fantasies of true believers reveal strong sadomasochistic outlets, vividly expressed, for example, in the delight of anti-Masons with the cruelty of Masonic punishments.\"<ref name=\"harpers=1964\">{{cite book|author=Hofstadter, Richard|author-link=Richard Hofstadter|year=1965|title=The Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays|location=New York|publisher=Alfred A.

While the complete facts of the situation and correct methodology are ostensibly important to them, Latour proposes that the scientific process is instead laid on as a patina to one's pet theories to lend a sort of reputation high ground. The \"fact position\" argues that individuals are dominated, often covertly and without their awareness, by external forces (e.g., economics, gender).{{r|critiquesteam|page2=238}} Latour concludes that each of these two approaches in Academia has led to a polarized, inefficient atmosphere highlighted (in both approaches) by its causticness. \"Do you see now why it feels so good to be a critical mind?\" asks Latour: no matter which position you take, \"You're always right!\"{{r|critiquesteam|page3=238\u201339}}\n\nLatour notes that such social criticism has been appropriated by those he describes as conspiracy theorists, including [[climate change denial]]ists and the [[9/11 Truth movement]]: \"Maybe I am taking conspiracy theories too seriously, but I am worried to detect, in those mad mixtures of knee-jerk disbelief, punctilious demands for proofs, and free use of powerful explanation from the social neverland, many of the weapons of social critique.\"{{r|critiquesteam|page4=230}}\n\n===Fusion paranoia===\n[[Michael Kelly (editor)|Michael Kelly]], a ''[[Washington Post]]'' journalist and critic of [[anti-war]] movements on both the left and right, coined the term \"fusion paranoia\" to refer to a political convergence of left-wing and right-wing activists around anti-war issues and [[civil liberties]], which he said were motivated by a shared belief in conspiracism or shared [[Anti-statism|anti-government]] views.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1995/06/19/the-road-to-paranoia|title=THE ROAD TO PARANOIA|last=Kelly|first=Michael|date=12 June 1995|work=The New Yorker|access-date=9 April 2018|issn=0028-792X}}</ref>\n\nBarkun has adopted this term to refer to how the synthesis of paranoid conspiracy theories, which were once limited to American fringe audiences, has given them mass appeal and enabled them to become commonplace in [[mass media]],{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=230}} thereby inaugurating an unrivaled period of people actively preparing for [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] or [[millenarianism|millenarian]] scenarios in the United States of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.{{sfn|Barkun|2003|pp=207, 210, 211}} Barkun notes the occurrence of lone-wolf conflicts with law enforcement acting as proxy for threatening the established political powers.{{sfn|Barkun|2003|pp=193, 197}}\n\n==Viability of conspiracies==\nThe physicist [[David Robert Grimes]] estimated the time it would take for a conspiracy to be exposed based on the number of people involved.<ref name=\"pbs_plos_one\">{{cite web|last1=Barajas|first1=Joshua|title=How many people does it take to keep a conspiracy alive?|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/math-formula-charts-the-lifespan-of-hoaxes/|website=PBS NEWSHOUR|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)|accessdate=22 July 2016|date=15 February 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Grimes_PLOS_ONE\">{{cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=David R|authorlink1=David Robert Grimes|title=On the Viability of Conspiratorial Beliefs|journal=PLOS ONE|date=26 January 2016|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0147905|pmid=26812482|volume=11|issue=1|pmc=4728076|pages=e0147905|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1147905G}}</ref> His calculations used data from the [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM surveillance program]], the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]], and the [[FBI Laboratory#Controversy|FBI forensic scandal]].

It was issued as a single on 23 March 1987 ahead of the record's release. The recording was solely written by Bowie, while production was handled by him along with [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]]. An [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] track, \"Day-In Day-Out\" criticizes the treatment of the homeless in the United States at that time, and deals with the depths to which a young mother sinks to feed her child.\n\nAn accompanying music video for the single was shot in 1987, being banned by some stations as a result of its content, although it was still nominated for a [[1987 MTV Video Music Awards|1987 MTV Video Music award]] in the category of \"Best Male Video\". Commercially, \"Day-In Day-Out\" was the most successful single from ''Never Let Me Down'', peaking at number 17 in the United Kingdom as well as charting within the top 40 in several other countries.\n\nA re-engineered version of the song that includes Bowie's original vocals, some original and new instrumentation, and new mastering was released in 2018 as part of the album ''[[Never Let Me Down#Never Let Me Down 2018|Never Let Me Down 2018]]'', part of the ''[[Loving the Alien (1983-1988)]]'' box set.\n\n==Background and release==\n\"Day-In Day-Out\" was written by Bowie at his home in [[Montreux]], Switzerland, along with most of the rest of ''Never Let Me Down'' in mid-1986.<ref name=\"MusicianMag\">{{Cite book | last=Isler| first=Scott| title=David Bowie Opens Up - A Little | journal=Musician| issue=106|date=August 1987 | pages=60\u201373}}</ref> It was recorded in the autumn of 1986 at [[Mountain Studios]] in the same city.<ref name=\"credits\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Never Let Me Down |year=1987 |type=Liner notes/ CD booklet |publisher=[[EMI]]}}</ref> The singer penned the song out of concern for the treatment of the homeless in the United States,<ref name=StockholmPress /> a foray into social commentary that he would further pursue with his grunge-precursor band [[Tin Machine]] two years later.<ref name=\"tcdbeu\">{{cite book | title=\"The Complete David Bowie New Edition: Expanded and Updated\" | last=Pegg | first=Nicholas | date=October 2016 | publisher=Titan Books}}</ref>\n\nMusically, the recording is an [[R&B]] song,<ref name=\"WMDB\">{{cite book|title=The Words and Music of David Bowie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6bz2BFdPawC&pg=PA93 |accessdate=24 April 2013|last=Perone|first=James|page=93|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]}}</ref> being reminiscent of some of the singer's R&B work in the 1970s.<ref name=\"BLTA\">{{cite book|title=Bowie: Loving the Alien|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OomyGN_btTQC&pg=PA264 |accessdate=24 April 2013|last=Sandford|first=Christopher|page=264}}</ref> One author said that it is \"an example of Bowie's strength in the R&B genre.\"<ref name=\"WMDB\" /> The lyrics of the song were compared by one writer to those of [[Dolly Parton]]'s \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\" (1980), and deal with the depths a young mother has to sink to feed her child.<ref name=\"WMDB\" /> Bowie claimed the song was selected as the lead-off single for ''Never Let Me Down'' \"more as a statement of energy\" about the album, as opposed to directly trying for a chart-topping single.<ref name=\"MusicianMag\" /> It was released on 23 March 1987 by [[EMI]] on multiple [[7\"]] and [[12\"]] single formats, featuring B-side single \"Julie\".<ref name=\"7 inch\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Day-In Day-Out |year=1987 |type=Liner notes |publisher=[[EMI]] (Barcode: 5099920171377)}}</ref><ref name=\"12 inch\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Day-In Day-Out |year=1987 |type=Liner notes |publisher=[[EMI]] (Barcode: 077771923418)}}</ref> A video EP was also distributed that year.<ref name=\"tcdbeu\"/> The single was further added to several compilations, including ''[[Bowie: The Singles 1969-1993]]'' (1993), ''[[The Singles Collection (David Bowie album)|The Singles Collection]]'' (1993), ''[[Bowie \u2013 The Video Collection]]'' (1993), ''[[Best of Bowie]]'' (2002), ''[[The Platinum Collection (David Bowie album)|The Platinum Collection]]'' (2005) and ''[[The Best of David Bowie 1980/1987|The Best of David Bowie 1980\u20131987]]'' (2007).<ref>Sources for the addition of \"Day-In Day-Out\" on various media:\n* {{cite book | title=\"The Complete David Bowie New Edition: Expanded and Updated\" | last=Pegg | first=Nicholas | date=October 2016 | publisher=Titan Books}}\n* {{Cite AV media notes |title=Glass Spider |title-link=Glass Spider |year=1988 |type=Liner notes}}\n* {{Cite AV media notes |title=Bowie: The Singles 1969-1993 |title-link=Bowie: The Singles 1969-1993 |year=1993 |type=Liner notes}}\n* {{Cite AV media notes |title=The Singles Collection |title-link=The Singles Collection (David Bowie album) |year=1993 |type=Liner notes}}\n* {{Cite AV media notes |title=Bowie \u2013 The Video Collection |title-link=Bowie \u2013 The Video Collection |year=1993 |type=Liner notes}}\n* {{Cite AV media notes |title=Best of Bowie |title-link=Best of Bowie |year=2002 |type=Liner notes}}\n* {{Cite AV media notes |title=The Platinum Collection |title-link=The Platinum Collection (David Bowie album) |year=2005 |type=Liner notes}}\n* {{Cite AV media notes |title=The Best of David Bowie 1980\u20131987 |title-link=The Best of David Bowie 1980/1987 |year=2005 |type=Liner notes}}</ref>\n\nA Spanish-language version of \"Day-In-Day-Out\", known as \"Al Alba\" or \"Dia Tras Dia\", was recorded in 1987 in order to boost interest in Bowie's first-ever concerts in Spain as part of his [[Glass Spider Tour]] (1987).

Then I put in the major camera angles that I think would be interesting or different. And Julien [Temple] puts in his input.

opening track for his seventeenth studio album, ''[[Never Let Me Down]]'' (1987). It was issued as a single on 23 March 1987 ahead of the record's release. The recording was solely written by Bowie, while production was handled by him along with [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]]. An [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] track, \"Day-In Day-Out\" criticizes the treatment of the homeless in the United States at that time, and deals with the depths a young mother has to sink to feed her child.\n\nAn accompanying music video for the single was shot in 1987, being banned by some stations as a result of its content, although it was still nominated for a [[1987 MTV Video Music Awards|1987 MTV Video Music award]] in the category of \"Best Male Video\". Commercially, \"Day-In Day-Out\" was the most successful single from ''Never Let Me Down'', peaking at number 17 in the United Kingdom as well as charting within the top 40 in several other countries.\n\nA re-engineered version of the song that includes Bowie's original vocals, some original and new instrumentation, and new mastering was released in 2018 as part of the album ''[[Never Let Me Down#Never Let Me Down 2018|Never Let Me Down 2018]]'', part of the ''[[Loving the Alien (1983-1988)]]'' box set.\n\n==Background and release==\n\"Day-In Day-Out\" was written by Bowie at his home in [[Montreux]], Switzerland, along with most of the rest of ''Never Let Me Down'' in mid-1986.<ref name=\"MusicianMag\">{{Cite book | last=Isler| first=Scott| title=David Bowie Opens Up - A Little | journal=Musician| issue=106|date=August 1987 | pages=60\u201373}}</ref> It was recorded in the autumn of 1986 at [[Mountain Studios]] in the same city.<ref name=\"credits\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Never Let Me Down |year=1987 |type=Liner notes/ CD booklet |publisher=[[EMI]]}}</ref> The singer penned the song out of concern for the treatment of the homeless in the United States,<ref name=StockholmPress /> a foray into social commentary that he would further pursue with his grunge-precursor band [[Tin Machine]] two years later.<ref name=\"tcdbeu\">{{cite book | title=\"The Complete David Bowie New Edition: Expanded and Updated\" | last=Pegg | first=Nicholas | date=October 2016 | publisher=Titan Books}}</ref>\n\nMusically, the recording is an [[R&B]] song,<ref name=\"WMDB\">{{cite book|title=The Words and Music of David Bowie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6bz2BFdPawC&pg=PA93 |accessdate=24 April 2013|last=Perone|first=James|page=93|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]}}</ref> being reminiscent of some of the singer's R&B work in the 1970s.<ref name=\"BLTA\">{{cite book|title=Bowie: Loving the Alien|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OomyGN_btTQC&pg=PA264 |accessdate=24 April 2013|last=Sandford|first=Christopher|page=264}}</ref> One author said that it is \"an example of Bowie's strength in the R&B genre.\"<ref name=\"WMDB\" /> The lyrics of the song were compared by one writer to those of [[Dolly Parton]]'s \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\" (1980), and deal with the depths a young mother has to sink to feed her child.<ref name=\"WMDB\" /> Bowie claimed the song was selected as the lead-off single for ''Never Let Me Down'' \"more as a statement of energy\" about the album, as opposed to directly trying for a chart-topping single.<ref name=\"MusicianMag\" /> It was released on 23 March 1987 by [[EMI]] on multiple [[7\"]] and [[12\"]] single formats, featuring B-side single \"Julie\".<ref name=\"7 inch\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Day-In Day-Out |year=1987 |type=Liner notes |publisher=[[EMI]] (Barcode: 5099920171377)}}</ref><ref name=\"12 inch\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Day-In Day-Out |year=1987 |type=Liner notes |publisher=[[EMI]] (Barcode: 077771923418)}}</ref> A video EP was also distributed that year.<ref name=\"tcdbeu\"/> The single was further added to several compilations, including ''[[Bowie: The Singles 1969-1993]]'' (1993), ''[[The Singles Collection (David Bowie album)|The Singles Collection]]'' (1993), ''[[Bowie \u2013 The Video Collection]]'' (1993), ''[[Best of Bowie]]'' (2002), ''[[The Platinum Collection (David Bowie album)|The Platinum Collection]]'' (2005) and ''[[The Best of David Bowie 1980/1987|The Best of David Bowie 1980\u20131987]]'' (2007).<ref>Sources for the addition of \"Day-In Day-Out\" on various media:\n* {{cite book | title=\"The Complete David Bowie New Edition: Expanded and Updated\" | last=Pegg | first=Nicholas | date=October 2016 | publisher=Titan Books}}\n* {{Cite AV media notes |title=Glass Spider |title-link=Glass Spider |year=1988 |type=Liner notes}}\n* {{Cite AV media notes |title=Bowie: The Singles 1969-1993 |title-link=Bowie: The Singles 1969-1993 |year=1993 |type=Liner notes}}\n* {{Cite AV media notes |title=The Singles Collection |title-link=The Singles Collection (David Bowie album) |year=1993 |type=Liner notes}}\n* {{Cite AV media notes |title=Bowie \u2013 The Video Collection |title-link=Bowie \u2013 The Video Collection |year=1993 |type=Liner notes}}\n* {{Cite AV media notes |title=Best of Bowie |title-link=Best of Bowie |year=2002 |type=Liner notes}}\n* {{Cite AV media notes |title=The Platinum Collection |title-link=The Platinum Collection (David Bowie album) |year=2005 |type=Liner notes}}\n* {{Cite AV media notes |title=The Best of David Bowie 1980\u20131987 |title-link=The Best of David Bowie 1980/1987 |year=2005 |type=Liner notes}}</ref>\n\nA Spanish-language version of \"Day-In-Day-Out\", known as \"Al Alba\" or \"Dia Tras Dia\", was recorded in 1987 in order to boost interest in Bowie's first-ever concerts in Spain as part of his [[Glass Spider Tour]] (1987).

Then I put in the major camera angles that I think would be interesting or different. And Julien [Temple] puts in his input.

The development responsibility was assigned to the Beijing Aerospace Propulsion Institute, a division of the [[China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation#Subordinate entities|Academy of Aerospace Launch Propulsion Technology]]. The preliminary design was accomplished by mid-2002 and the first set of components was manufactured by early 2003.

By the end of 2013 more than 70 tests and 24,000 seconds of firing at steady state conditions had been performed by 12 engines.

Each engine has dual turbopumps with separate gas exhaust. Both turbines are fed by a single fuel rich gas generator. The combustion chambers and throat are [[Regenerative cooling (rocket)|regeneratively cooled]], while the nozzle, of welded pipe construction, uses [[Rocket engine#Cooling|dump cooling]]. The turbopumps use solid propellant cartridges for start-up, while the gas generator and combustion chamber use [[Pyrotechnic initiator|pyrotechnic igniters]]. The valves and prevalves are helium-actuated [[ball valve]]s. The thrust and mixture ratio are calibrated with [[Venturi effect|venturis]] and a propellant utilization valve on ground tests. The engine also has dual heat exchanger to supply hot gaseous hydrogen and oxygen for tank pressurization.<ref name=wang-2013 />\n\nAll subsystems are attached to the combustion chamber and gimbal is achieved by rotating the whole engine on two orthogonal planes with two independent actuators. The injector plate uses coaxial injectors, some of which are extended to create baffles that prevent high frequency instabilities. The titanium fuel turbopump uses a two-stage pump with inducer and is actuated by a two-stage axial turbine. It rotates at 35,000 rpm and supplies a discharge pressure of {{convert|16.5|MPa|psi|abbr=on}}. The oxidizer turbopump uses a single-stage centrifugal pump with a helical inducer driven by a two-stage turbine.

In Sons of Anarchy, he is President of Oakland chapter of the Mayans, a Mexican-American motorcycle club. In between when Sons of Anarchy ends and [[Mayans M.C.]] begins, he is promoted to El Padrino, which is Spanish for The Godfather and is the leader of all Mayans\u2019 chapters. At the end of season 1 of Mayans M.C., he resigns as El Padrino and becomes Miguel Galendo\u2019s head of security.\n\n==Biography==\n\u00c1lvarez, who is of [[Mexican American|Mexican descent]], is the President of the [[Mayans Motorcycle Club's [[Oakland, California]] chapter and seems to be their national president. His son, [[List of characters from Sons of Anarchy#Esai \u00c1lvarez|Esai]], was also a member of the club but had a hit placed on him by Marcus in 2008 as punishment for failing his mission. Most of his, and his gang's, income is made through dealing [[heroin]] and [[methamphetamine]], and [[prostitution]]. For some time, he was a [[Incarceration|prisoner]] in [[California Institution for Men|Chino]], but was released some time before the beginning of Season One.\n\nOn his [[gang colors|colors]], he wears patches reading \"Los Asesinos de Dios\" ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for \"God's Assassins\") and \"Mayans Oakland\". However, his \"President\" patch is later changed to \"El Padrino\". He also has the [[Mayan Calendar]] tattooed on his chest.\n\n===Sons of Anarchy===\n====Season 1====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 1)}}\nAt the beginning of the first series, Marcus \u00c1lvarez and other members of the Mayans MC, broke into the Sons of Anarchy's weapons warehouse. The Mayans stole the guns; then they torched the warehouse. The Sons of Anarchy eventually got revenge, however, by stealing the guns back and destroying a Mayans narcotics storage facility.\n\n[[Ernest Darby]], leader of the Nordics (after being supplied with a dossier containing all the details required to take over SAMCRO'S gun business, by a rogue ATF agent), calls a meeting with \u00c1lvarez. During their meeting, Darby proposes the Nords & Mayans further their present alliance. Darby's deal requires the Mayans first assassinate SAMCRO's President, followed by the rest of its members, with the spoils to be divided as follows: Darby's Nords get Charming (freeing them to expand their meth trade into the city). \u00c1lvarez and the Mayans (using the ATF dossier to be supplied by Darby, post-assassination) get to take over SAMCRO's lucrative gun business, utilize their newfound control of the gun trade to expand their heroin business & eliminate a longtime rival MC. \u00c1lvarez, recognizing an opportunity, reluctantly agrees in principle, but demurs on the Mayans eliminating SAMCRO requirement, instead suggesting a more joint effort, with the Mayans increasing their current security & support of the Nords power plays. Darby, sensing \u00c1lvarez knows the deal is too good to pass up, reiterates his initial demands, and exits the meeting - his \"take it or leave it\" ball placed squarely in \u00c1lvarez's court. With Darby now out of earshot, \u00c1lvarez immediately gives two orders: kill SAMCRO's President, and double-cross Darby by murdering him & taking the ATF dossier for themselves. \u00c1lvarez's son requests he & his crew be tasked with carrying out both orders - a request \u00c1lvarez grants.\n\nLater, the Mayans carry out simultaneous hits on both Darby & the SAMCRO President. However, both hits go sideways for the Mayans. The Mayans hit Darby at his home, killing 2 women & 1 Nord henchman, but missing Darby. Although they fail to kill Darby, they do manage to steal the ATF dossier. During the hit on SAMCRO President, Clay Morrow, the Mayans  find themselves outnumbered, as Clay & Tig are making a deal with the IRA at a bar - all of whom fight off & kill the Mayans, while suffering only one wounded in the process.\n\nThe failed hit generates two reactions. First, Clay orders the #1 & #2 members of every SOA charter between Charming to Tacoma to report to Charming ASAP. Second, Charming PD bring Clay in for questioning about the shootings. At his questioning, Clay asks his associate and corrupt Charming Police Chief [[Wayne Unser]] to allow him to have a \"little chat\" with Darby (who is already in Charming PD lockup) & to bring \u00c1lvarez in under similar pretenses, also holding him in Charming lockup, so they can hold a summit of sorts, to potentially curtail any further SOA-Mayan violence. Also during Clay's questioning a large group of SOA members (every charter's #1 & #2 from as far away as Tacoma) roars past Charming PD headquarters, in full view of both Clay & Unser. This show of gunboat diplomacy, sways Unser to acquiesce to Clay's summit request.\n\nGiven the green light by Unser, Clay first chats with Darby in his jail cell. Essentially imposing his will upon Darby via several powerful punches to the head, Clay forces Darby to submit.\n\nNext, \u00c1lvarez is brought in & locked up in a cell with Clay. Clay outlines an agreement where SAMCRO will sell weapons to the Mayans, in exchange for settling all SOA-Mayan disputes, across all charters, in favour of SOA, regardless of the cost to the Mayans - including the failed Mayan hit on Clay himself. \u00c1lvarez agrees to all terms, including recompense for the botched hit.\n\nClay then takes this tentative agreement to the club for a vote. All members vote unanimously to ratify the agreement charter-wide. MC members further decide justice for the hit on Clay should be carried out by Happy, as he is a member of a non-SAMCRO SOA charter.\n\nLater, during an idyllic looking, sunny California Sunday afternoon, \u00c1lvarez & his son Esai, share what briefly presents as a warm, sage-like, father-son moment in the park: Esai seeks reassurance for his shortcomings from his father. \u00c1lvarez cryptically reassures his son - and then leads him right over to the churro vendor (actually Happy in disguise), who expertly inserts a blade into the back of Esai's brain, killing him instantly, as \u00c1lvarez upholds his end of the bargain with a shocking demonstration of MC sobre sangre.\n\n \nWhen the Mayans eventually set up a deal with the Sons in Oakland, it was attacked by the [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#One-Niners|One-Niners]]. A shoot-out ensued, and gang members from the One-Niners and Mayans were killed, but the Sons of Anarchy escaped. \u00c1lvarez was also shot in the leg and wounded. The deal was, in fact, a set-up organized by the Niners and SOA. The Niners were supposed to attack the Mayans after the Sons had left and would keep the weapons as payment. However, they tried to take out the SOA as well.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/The+Sleep+of+Babies/episode/1235305/recap.html?tag=content_wrap;episode_header The Sleep of Babies - Recap]</ref>\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 2)}}\nAt the beginning of Season 2, Clay had Opie murder a member of the Mayans, who Clay had framed as the guy who murdered Donna.  After Opie murdered the Mayan, he carved the Anarchy symbol in his chest as a message to the Mayans. [[Jax Teller]] dropped off the body in Mayan Territory in Oakland after shooting the gang member multiple times in the body to destroy the symbol.  He then arranged the Mayan's hands to hold up 9 fingers to implicate the One-Niners as the culprits.  Alvarez later found the body and gave Clay a call asking to buy weapons.  Clay turned Alvarez down on the weapons transaction, telling him that the club was still under suspicion of the ATF; Clay then told Tig to call Laroy of the One-Niners to arrange a meeting to supply Niners with weapons so that they could defend themselves when the Mayans attacked.  During the weapons transaction between SAMCRO and the Niners, the Mayans ambushed the deal and stole all the Niner's AKs, and Bobby Elvis was shot in the shoulder during the ambush.  After the ambush, Alvarez was seen making a phone call to Ethan Zobelle of LOAN telling him his intel was correct and that he owed him.  Zobelle responded, \"Yes, you do,\" and then told AJ Weston that it was his friend from church on the phone.  Clay blamed the whole ambush and Bobby getting shot in the shoulder on Jax, as Jax changed the plan and set the Niners up for the hit instead of leaving Anarchy symbol on the dead Mayan's chest.\n\nIn the episode \"Service\", Zobelle met with Marcus Alvarez offering the Mayans the exclusive business of having their heroin distributed to all the local prisons.  Alvarez is hesitant about the deal because Zobelle wants to keep 50% of the profits, but has no choice when Zobelle tells him that he won't supply the Mayans with any more weapons if they don't go along with the new arrangement.\n\nIn the second-season finale, Marcus and the Mayans provided protection to Ethan Zobelle and Zobelle's daughter who were attempting to flee Charming.  Marcus was eventually able to convince Zobelle to leave his cigar shop, but the Mayan convoy they attempted to escape in was ambushed by SAMCRO.  Marcus survived the attack uninjured and Clay spared his life.\n\n====Season 3====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 3)}}\nDuring the season Alvarez hired a low ranked MC, the Calaveras, to help guard his shipment of heroin, with the promise to patch them over, but after SAMCRO stole them he decided not to patch them over and then returned Juice's [[kutte]]. At the advice of Clay, Alvarez decided to drop the war between them and in return the Grim Bastards MC, a friendly club to SAMCRO, would protect Alvarez's drug shipments.  As a favor to the Mayans, Tig and Kozik killed the Calaveras member who was caught during the drive-by at Half-Sack's wake.\n\nWhen a member of the Grim Bastards MC is found murdered and evidence points to the Calaveras, SAMCRO and the Bastards' President T.O. Cross go to Marcus Alvarez for help.  The Mayans and SAMCRO confront the Calaveras members in a park restroom and give the president of the Calaveras, Hector Salazar, the option of telling them which of his lieutenants killed the Bastards member or to die himself.  He gives up his Sgt-At-Arms, who is then promptly shot in the head by the enraged T.O.  A disgusted Alvarez strips Salazar of his position and kutte and then kicks him out of the Calaveras. He then appoints Salazar's V.P as president and advises him to keep a tighter hold on his men then Salazar did.\n\nWhen Tara Knowles and Margaret Murphy are taken hostage by Hector Salazar, Salazar demands that SAMCRO kill Alvarez and retrieve $250,000 worth of Mayans MC money.  Tig, Kozik, and Piney are able to convince Alvarez to play dead for 24 hours so that they can come up with a plan to get the women back.  Marcus tells the Sons that the $250,000 does not exist.\n\n====Season 4====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 4)}}\nHe is seen at Opie's wedding talking with Clay and thanking him for protection during their sentence. He says he was just \"looking out for my investments.\" Unlike previous seasons \u00c1lvarez now has a President's patch on his cut. He is also seen throughout the season forming an alliance between SOA and the Mayans in light of the Galindo Cartel who has connections to the Mayans. Alvarez helped set up a deal between the SOA and Galindo to mule their cocaine while the Mayans distribute and sell. He is also shown giving Mayans to help guard the cocaine in the Son's warehouse. When one of the bricks is stolen, he assures Jax and Clay his man was not responsible. He is later injured in a shootout with rival cartel Lobos Sonoras. He is brought to the clubhouse and treated by Tara.\n\n====Season 5====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 5)}}\nAlvarez was last seen in a street meeting with Jax, Henry Lin, and the Oakland One-Niner's leader Tyler to discuss allowing the Galindo Cartel's cocaine to move through their territory. Alvarez agrees as long as they \"keep black (the Niners) in line\". It is later stated the Mayans will take over the [[mule (smuggling)|muling]] as well, as SAMCRO wants out of the de al ardilla preciosa\n\n====Season 6====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 6)}}\nAlvarez and the Mayans only appear at the end of the sixth season (\"You Are My Sunshine\" and \"A Mother's Work\"), expressing their unhappiness with SAMCRO's decision to hand over the IRA gun business to August Marks. He also informs Jax of the Mayans' intention of setting up a charter in Stockton. Alvarez is also shown to be a friend of Nero Padilla; having served time in Chino together. Alvarez tells Nero that soon it might end up being \"brown and yellow against black and white\". When he arrives at the gun deal with the Sons, Nero, and the Niners. Alvarez is disappointed that August Marks wasn't present during the transaction. When SAMCRO and Tyler departs, Alvarez and his men gun down the Niners and steal the guns.\n\n====Season 7====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 7)}}\nAt the beginning of the seventh season, the Mayans have set up their Stockton charter with Oscar El Oso Ramos as president. Alvarez and the Mayans seem to be on the same side as Henry Lin and the Lin Triad against SAMCRO and the Niners. However, Alvarez joins SAMCRO's side when they believe the Triads are to blame for Tara's death and they help both SAMCRO and the One-Niners deal with both the Triads and August Marks. Alvarez is shown to be fully on SAMCRO's side when Juice approaches him offering information on SAMCRO in exchange for passage to Mexico. Alvarez hands Juice over to SAMCRO, saying he would never make a deal with a rat. When it is revealed that it was Gemma who killed Tara and not the Triads, Alvarez sympathizes with Jax and helps him clean up the mess with the Chinese. Later, the Mayans, One-Niners, SAMCRO and the Byz Lats discuss territories and business. One of Jax's final acts as president of SAMCRO is to set the Mayans up with Connor Malone as their new gun source, finally giving Alvarez the gun business he wanted.\n\n===Mayans M.C.===\n====Season 1====\n{{see also|Mayans M.C. (season 1)}}\nAlvarez now wearing an \"El Padrino\" patch which in English translates to \"the Godfather\". Goes down to Santo Padre Charter with members of the Mayans Motorcycle Club's Oakland, California charter to help the Santo Padre charter deal with the Galindo Cartel. It is revealed that he and Jos\u00e9 Galindo; the founder of the Galindo Cartel, had a mutual respect for one another. Alvarez later suspects that a mule in the Santo Padre charter is working with Los Olividados (\"The Forgotten Ones\"). In the season Finale Alvarez steps down as Padrino to work with the Galindo Cartel directly as Miguel's newly appointed [[consigliere|advisor]].\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Mayans M.C.

In Sons of Anarchy, he is President of Oakland chapter of the Mayans, a Mexican-American motorcycle club. In between when Sons of Anarchy ends and [[Mayans M.C.]] begins, he is promoted to El Padrino, which is Spanish for The Godfather and is the leader of all Mayans\u2019 chapters. At the end of season 1 of Mayans M.C., he resigns as El Padrino and becomes Miguel Galendo\u2019s head of security.\n\n==Biography==\n\u00c1lvarez, who is of [[Mexican American|Mexican descent]], is the President of the [[Mayans Motorcycle Club's [[Oakland, California]] chapter and seems to be their national president. His son, [[List of characters from Sons of Anarchy#Esai \u00c1lvarez|Esai]], was also a member of the club but had a hit placed on him by Marcus in 2008 as punishment for failing his mission. Most of his, and his gang's, income is made through dealing [[heroin]] and [[methamphetamine]], and [[prostitution]]. For some time, he was a [[Incarceration|prisoner]] in [[California Institution for Men|Chino]], but was released some time before the beginning of Season One.\n\nOn his [[gang colors|colors]], he wears patches reading \"Los Asesinos de Dios\" ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for \"God's Assassins\") and \"Mayans Oakland\". However, his \"President\" patch is later changed to \"El Padrino\". He also has the [[Mayan Calendar]] tattooed on his chest.\n\n===Sons of Anarchy===\n====Season 1====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 1)}}\nAt the beginning of the first series, Marcus \u00c1lvarez and other members of the Mayans MC, broke into the Sons of Anarchy's weapons warehouse. The Mayans stole the guns; then they torched the warehouse. The Sons of Anarchy eventually got revenge, however, by stealing the guns back and destroying a Mayans narcotics storage facility.\n\n[[Ernest Darby]], leader of the [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#Nordics|Nordics]] (after being supplied with a dossier containing all the details required to take over SAMCRO'S gun business, by a rogue ATF agent), calls a meeting with \u00c1lvarez. During their meeting, Darby proposes the Nords & Mayans further their present alliance. Darby's deal requires the Mayans first assassinate SAMCRO's President, followed by the rest of its members, with the spoils to be divided as follows: Darby's Nords get Charming (freeing them to expand their meth trade into the city). \u00c1lvarez and the Mayans (using the ATF dossier to be supplied by Darby, post-assassination) get to take over SAMCRO's lucrative gun business, utilize their newfound control of the gun trade to expand their heroin business & eliminate a longtime rival MC. \u00c1lvarez, recognizing an opportunity, reluctantly agrees in principle, but demurs on the Mayans eliminating SAMCRO requirement, instead suggesting a more joint effort, with the Mayans increasing their current security & support of the Nords power plays. Darby, sensing \u00c1lvarez knows the deal is too good to pass up, reiterates his initial demands, and exits the meeting - his \"take it or leave it\" ball placed squarely in \u00c1lvarez's court. With Darby now out of earshot, \u00c1lvarez immediately gives two orders: kill SAMCRO's President, and double-cross Darby by murdering him & taking the ATF dossier for themselves. \u00c1lvarez's son requests he & his crew be tasked with carrying out both orders - a request \u00c1lvarez grants.\n\nLater, the Mayans carry out simultaneous hits on both Darby & the SAMCRO President. However, both hits go sideways for the Mayans. The Mayans hit Darby at his home, killing 2 women & 1 Nord henchman, but missing Darby. Although they fail to kill Darby, they do manage to steal the ATF dossier. During the hit on SAMCRO President, Clay Morrow, the Mayans  find themselves outnumbered, as Clay & Tig are making a deal with the IRA at a bar - all of whom fight off & kill the Mayans, while suffering only one wounded in the process.\n\nThe failed hit generates two reactions. First, Clay orders the #1 & #2 members of every SOA charter between Charming to Tacoma to report to Charming ASAP. Second, Charming PD bring Clay in for questioning about the shootings. At his questioning, Clay asks his associate and corrupt Charming Police Chief [[Wayne Unser]] to allow him to have a \"little chat\" with Darby (who is already in Charming PD lockup) & to bring \u00c1lvarez in under similar pretenses, also holding him in Charming lockup, so they can hold a summit of sorts, to potentially curtail any further SOA-Mayan violence. Also during Clay's questioning a large group of SOA members (every charter's #1 & #2 from as far away as Tacoma) roars past Charming PD headquarters, in full view of both Clay & Unser. This show of gunboat diplomacy, sways Unser to acquiesce to Clay's summit request.\n\nGiven the green light by Unser, Clay first chats with Darby in his jail cell. Essentially imposing his will upon Darby via several powerful punches to the head, Clay forces Darby to submit.\n\nNext, \u00c1lvarez is brought in & locked up in a cell with Clay. Clay outlines an agreement where SAMCRO will sell weapons to the Mayans, in exchange for settling all SOA-Mayan disputes, across all charters, in favour of SOA, regardless of the cost to the Mayans - including the failed Mayan hit on Clay himself. \u00c1lvarez agrees to all terms, including recompense for the botched hit.\n\nClay then takes this tentative agreement to the club for a vote. All members vote unanimously to ratify the agreement charter-wide. MC members further decide justice for the hit on Clay should be carried out by Happy, as he is a member of a non-SAMCRO SOA charter.\n\nLater, during an idyllic looking, sunny California Sunday afternoon, \u00c1lvarez & his son Esai, share what briefly presents as a warm, sage-like, father-son moment in the park: Esai seeks reassurance for his shortcomings from his father. \u00c1lvarez cryptically reassures his son - and then leads him right over to the churro vendor (actually Happy in disguise), who expertly inserts a blade into the back of Esai's brain, killing him instantly, as \u00c1lvarez upholds his end of the bargain with a shocking demonstration of MC sobre sangre.\n\n \nWhen the Mayans eventually set up a deal with the Sons in Oakland, it was attacked by the [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#One-Niners|One-Niners]]. A shoot-out ensued, and gang members from the One-Niners and Mayans were killed, but the Sons of Anarchy escaped. \u00c1lvarez was also shot in the leg and wounded. The deal was, in fact, a set-up organized by the Niners and SOA. The Niners were supposed to attack the Mayans after the Sons had left and would keep the weapons as payment. However, they tried to take out the SOA as well.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/The+Sleep+of+Babies/episode/1235305/recap.html?tag=content_wrap;episode_header The Sleep of Babies - Recap]</ref>\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 2)}}\nAt the beginning of Season 2, Clay had Opie murder a member of the Mayans, who Clay had framed as the guy who murdered Donna.  After Opie murdered the Mayan, he carved the Anarchy symbol in his chest as a message to the Mayans. [[Jax Teller]] dropped off the body in Mayan Territory in Oakland after shooting the gang member multiple times in the body to destroy the symbol.  He then arranged the Mayan's hands to hold up 9 fingers to implicate the One-Niners as the culprits.  Alvarez later found the body and gave Clay a call asking to buy weapons.  Clay turned Alvarez down on the weapons transaction, telling him that the club was still under suspicion of the ATF; Clay then told Tig to call Laroy of the One-Niners to arrange a meeting to supply Niners with weapons so that they could defend themselves when the Mayans attacked.  During the weapons transaction between SAMCRO and the Niners, the Mayans ambushed the deal and stole all the Niner's AKs, and Bobby Elvis was shot in the shoulder during the ambush.  After the ambush, Alvarez was seen making a phone call to Ethan Zobelle of LOAN telling him his intel was correct and that he owed him.  Zobelle responded, \"Yes, you do,\" and then told AJ Weston that it was his friend from church on the phone.  Clay blamed the whole ambush and Bobby getting shot in the shoulder on Jax, as Jax changed the plan and set the Niners up for the hit instead of leaving Anarchy symbol on the dead Mayan's chest.\n\nIn the episode \"Service\", Zobelle met with Marcus Alvarez offering the Mayans the exclusive business of having their heroin distributed to all the local prisons.  Alvarez is hesitant about the deal because Zobelle wants to keep 50% of the profits, but has no choice when Zobelle tells him that he won't supply the Mayans with any more weapons if they don't go along with the new arrangement.\n\nIn the second-season finale, Marcus and the Mayans provided protection to Ethan Zobelle and Zobelle's daughter who were attempting to flee Charming.  Marcus was eventually able to convince Zobelle to leave his cigar shop, but the Mayan convoy they attempted to escape in was ambushed by SAMCRO.  Marcus survived the attack uninjured and Clay spared his life.\n\n====Season 3====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 3)}}\nDuring the season Alvarez hired a low ranked MC, the Calaveras, to help guard his shipment of heroin, with the promise to patch them over, but after SAMCRO stole them he decided not to patch them over and then returned Juice's [[kutte]]. At the advice of Clay, Alvarez decided to drop the war between them and in return the Grim Bastards MC, a friendly club to SAMCRO, would protect Alvarez's drug shipments.  As a favor to the Mayans, Tig and Kozik killed the Calaveras member who was caught during the drive-by at Half-Sack's wake.\n\nWhen a member of the Grim Bastards MC is found murdered and evidence points to the Calaveras, SAMCRO and the Bastards' President T.O. Cross go to Marcus Alvarez for help.  The Mayans and SAMCRO confront the Calaveras members in a park restroom and give the president of the Calaveras, Hector Salazar, the option of telling them which of his lieutenants killed the Bastards member or to die himself.  He gives up his Sgt-At-Arms, who is then promptly shot in the head by the enraged T.O.  A disgusted Alvarez strips Salazar of his position and kutte and then kicks him out of the Calaveras. He then appoints Salazar's V.P as president and advises him to keep a tighter hold on his men then Salazar did.\n\nWhen Tara Knowles and Margaret Murphy are taken hostage by Hector Salazar, Salazar demands that SAMCRO kill Alvarez and retrieve $250,000 worth of Mayans MC money.  Tig, Kozik, and Piney are able to convince Alvarez to play dead for 24 hours so that they can come up with a plan to get the women back.  Marcus tells the Sons that the $250,000 does not exist.\n\n====Season 4====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 4)}}\nHe is seen at Opie's wedding talking with Clay and thanking him for protection during their sentence. He says he was just \"looking out for my investments.\" Unlike previous seasons \u00c1lvarez now has a President's patch on his cut. He is also seen throughout the season forming an alliance between SOA and the Mayans in light of the Galindo Cartel who has connections to the Mayans. Alvarez helped set up a deal between the SOA and Galindo to mule their cocaine while the Mayans distribute and sell. He is also shown giving Mayans to help guard the cocaine in the Son's warehouse. When one of the bricks is stolen, he assures Jax and Clay his man was not responsible. He is later injured in a shootout with rival cartel Lobos Sonoras. He is brought to the clubhouse and treated by Tara.\n\n====Season 5====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 5)}}\nAlvarez was last seen in a street meeting with Jax, Henry Lin, and the Oakland One-Niner's leader Tyler to discuss allowing the Galindo Cartel's cocaine to move through their territory. Alvarez agrees as long as they \"keep black (the Niners) in line\". It is later stated the Mayans will take over the [[mule (smuggling)|muling]] as well, as SAMCRO wants out of the de al ardilla preciosa\n\n====Season 6====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 6)}}\nAlvarez and the Mayans only appear at the end of the sixth season (\"You Are My Sunshine\" and \"A Mother's Work\"), expressing their unhappiness with SAMCRO's decision to hand over the IRA gun business to August Marks. He also informs Jax of the Mayans' intention of setting up a charter in Stockton. Alvarez is also shown to be a friend of Nero Padilla; having served time in Chino together. Alvarez tells Nero that soon it might end up being \"brown and yellow against black and white\". When he arrives at the gun deal with the Sons, Nero, and the Niners. Alvarez is disappointed that August Marks wasn't present during the transaction. When SAMCRO and Tyler departs, Alvarez and his men gun down the Niners and steal the guns.\n\n====Season 7====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 7)}}\nAt the beginning of the seventh season, the Mayans have set up their Stockton charter with Oscar El Oso Ramos as president. Alvarez and the Mayans seem to be on the same side as Henry Lin and the Lin Triad against SAMCRO and the Niners. However, Alvarez joins SAMCRO's side when they believe the Triads are to blame for Tara's death and they help both SAMCRO and the One-Niners deal with both the Triads and August Marks. Alvarez is shown to be fully on SAMCRO's side when Juice approaches him offering information on SAMCRO in exchange for passage to Mexico. Alvarez hands Juice over to SAMCRO, saying he would never make a deal with a rat. When it is revealed that it was Gemma who killed Tara and not the Triads, Alvarez sympathizes with Jax and helps him clean up the mess with the Chinese. Later, the Mayans, One-Niners, SAMCRO and the Byz Lats discuss territories and business. One of Jax's final acts as president of SAMCRO is to set the Mayans up with Connor Malone as their new gun source, finally giving Alvarez the gun business he wanted.\n\n===Mayans M.C.===\n====Season 1====\n{{see also|Mayans M.C. (season 1)}}\nAlvarez now wearing an \"El Padrino\" patch which in English translates to \"the Godfather\". Goes down to Santo Padre Charter with members of the Mayans Motorcycle Club's Oakland, California charter to help the Santo Padre charter deal with the Galindo Cartel. It is revealed that he and Jos\u00e9 Galindo; the founder of the Galindo Cartel, had a mutual respect for one another. Alvarez later suspects that a mule in the Santo Padre charter is working with Los Olividados (\"The Forgotten Ones\"). In the season Finale Alvarez steps down as Padrino to work with the Galindo Cartel directly as Miguel's newly appointed [[consigliere|advisor]].\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Mayans M.C.
