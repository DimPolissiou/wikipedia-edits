If you have a question about a particular one, or want to know about additional sources, please help find some, and add them to this article, or put them on the talk page for this article. -->\nAn '''overworld''' is, in a broad sense, commonly  an area within a [[video game]] (though it can be in other things, too) that interconnects all its [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] or locations. They are mostly common in [[Role-playing video game|role-playing games]], though this does not exclude other [[video game genres]], such as some [[platformers]] and [[strategy game]]s.\n\nOverworlds generally feature a [[Top-down perspective|top-down]] view or a [[Third-person view|third-person perspective]] of the [[Imaginary world|fictional world]] within the game. It often contains varied terrain (including caves, mountains, forests, and bodies of water) and a collection of towns and other locations (most commonly [[Dungeon crawl|dungeons]] or [[Level (video gaming)|levels]]). When the party enters one of these locations the world map display may remain on the screen, be replaced by the local geography, or be hidden until the party exits the location. In many games, the player is able to travel on the world map; in other games, the player uses the world map to select their next location. Typically, a dungeon houses a host of enemies, while a town usually is safe. In some games, there are a series of world maps.{{efn|In some ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games, for example, the player can travel between the earth and the moon, each of which has its own world map. Additionally, in ''[[Final Fantasy III]]'', once the player obtains an airship, they may leave their current world to find themselves in a larger world map with a selection representing the first world.}} Some games allow the player to view only a portion of the world map at the beginning of the game, with new locations becoming visible as the game progresses, whereas other games show the entire world map from the beginning. The opposite term \"underworld\" refers to the world underneath the ground.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Role-playing video games===\n[[File:Battle for wesnoth httt world map.png|thumb|right|Overworld map from the video game ''[[The Battle for Wesnoth]]''.]]\nThe [[Ultima (series)|Ultima series]] of [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]] marks one of the first uses of an overworld. Many games have emulated ''Ultima''{{'}}s overworlds, especially fantasy-based ones. The most prominent example in this category is the [[Dragon Quest|''Dragon Quest'' series]]. In each of this type of overworld game, most of the action (or at least most of the plot-advancing action) takes place in towns, forests, dungeons, caves, castles (and the surrounding area), camps, fortresses, mass transportation systems, celestial bodies (e.g. the moon), and other locations. In the ''Dragon Quest'' series, the overworld is used as a \"travel map\", and changes to a closer perspective for direct gameplay or confrontation. The overworlds featured in most of the 2D adventures of this genre commonly depict the character(s)' proportions as larger than they actually would be in the world being travelled, thus lending necessary visibility to the player. The characters' animation in this type of overworld is often simpler than that found in the game's menus and other areas, while more complicated movement such as combat, climbing or visibly handling objects sometimes happens at closer perspectives, and often involves [[cutscene]]s.\n\n===''The Legend of Zelda'' series===\nWhile previous games have featured overworlds, one of the earliest console games to feature an overworld is the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] game ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]''. Gameplay in ''Zelda''{{'}}s overworld was virtually identical to that of its nine underground dungeon levels, offering a [[top-down perspective]] and including access to caves, bridges, mazes, shops and waterfalls as well as lurking dangers that range from enemies to tumbling rocks. Much of the immediate gameplay takes place in the overworld, and the diversity of terrain (as well as the sheer size of the overworld itself) ensures that the player will spend as much time exploring and searching above ground as they will below (or in any of the areas listed above). The concept of an overworld also offered a [[non-linear gameplay]] experience;<ref name=\"rpgamer review\">{{cite web | author=Long, Andrew | year= | title=Oldest School | publisher=RPGamer | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/zelda/z1/reviews/z1strev1.html | accessdate=2006-10-01}}</ref> some believed this would cause the player to become confused and not know where to go, a sentiment which has endured as overworlds have become larger and more complex.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThe ''Zelda'' series is well known for these large overworld areas, such as [[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Hyrule Field|Hyrule Field]]. Many enemies inhabit the various overworlds. The player can see most of these without any special tools, and most are easily defeated or avoided. The game [[Minecraft]] is another popular example of a platform game with an Overworld.\n\nThere are special items available in most of the overworld areas in the series, but these are often non-essential to completing the overall objective; the main purpose served by an overworld is to connect more important places.\n\n===Platform games===\nAlthough large-scale overworlds were popularized by ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' in 1986, the genre of [[platform game]]s did not have overworlds (in the main sense) until [[Platform game#Reshaping the genre|3D platformers]] appeared in the mid-1990s. The concept of an overworld in platform gaming prior to that time was limited to a \"level select\" style, which first was featured in the multi-genre [[Arcade game|arcade]] title ''[[Dragon Buster]]'',<ref>{{allgame|id=9953|Dragon Buster}}</ref> and popularized by other games such as ''[[Bionic Commando (Nintendo Entertainment System)|Bionic Commando]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''.{{efn|In these and similar games, the character doesn't actually travel on a world map (viz. freedom to move is strictly limited to linear direction); rather, the player only repositions the character on an adjacent location (a dot or icon that represents a level) that is connected by a rail (which may not be visible) to other adjacent locations. The ''[[Wild Arms (series)|Wild Arms]]'' series and the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series are popular examples.}}\nIn ''[[Spyro]]'' the first 3 games had a place called a \"home world\" that was like an over world. It contained portals to other levels of the game.\n\nPrevious titles like ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' and ''[[Castlevania#Film|Castlevania]]'' revolved around the player completing levels in a linear order, with no option to return to completed levels. It is likely that the overworlds developed for [[3D computer graphics|3D]] games, such as some of those listed above, evolved from the level-select type overworlds featured in prior 2D platform games, such as those seen in ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' and ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]''.<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/product/specs/prtprdid,16515230/specs.html PC World \u2013 Super Mario Advance 4 (GBA) Test Report]</ref> Beginning with ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', every [[Super Mario|''Mario'' platformer]] has featured either a level-select type overworld (e.g. ''[[Super Mario World]]'' and ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'') or a hub-type overworld (e.g. Peach's Castle in ''[[Super Mario 64#Setting|Super Mario 64]]'' and the Comet Observatory in ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'') \u2013 a central, usually enemy-free area \u2013 that connects to levels and other important places. As the genre evolved and became more popular, the overworld concept expanded into other platformers \u2013 from ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'' to the [[Donkey Kong (series)#Successors|''Donkey Kong'' series]] \u2013 becoming a staple of the genre that endures as a prominent feature.\n\n===''Minecraft''===\n[[Minecraft]] is an extremely popular platform and sandbox video game, available on nearly every platform, excluding [[Wii]], [[PlayStation 1]] and [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable]]. This game's overworld is a default, meaning the player is situated in the overworld by default,  unless the game is modified. Minecraft's overworld is one of the most popular overworld maps.\n\n===Home level===\n[[File:Angband.png|thumb|The town level in the roguelike game ''Angband''.]]\nA '''home level''' is an area found within a [[roguelike]] [[video game]]. It is usually a haven for the hero characters, where enemy hostility is minimal. In most cases, the home level features shops in which the player can purchase items, and is often the initial site of the story or game, although in some games it is a location discovered later. In some games, such as ''[[Destiny of an Emperor]]'', as the story progresses, the location of the home level may change, or there may be other such places that serve a similar purpose. ''[[Larn (video game)|Larn]]'', a 1980s roguelike game, was among the earliest to feature a home level.\n\nSome games feature a home level that contains many different points of interest. The home level in ''[[Angband (video game)|Angband]]'', for instance, consists of seven shops, the player's home (where characters may store unneeded items), and a staircase to the first dungeon [[Level (video games)|level]]. Some variants of the home level add speciality shops, quest locations, or a wilderness through which additional towns can be discovered.\n\n==Navigation==\nMany of the games that have an overworld feature a world map of some sort; these range from very basic \u2013 such as a grey rectangle with a dot indicating the position of the character in ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' \u2013 to an overworld map that can be toggled on and off, but shows only rough outlines of various locations, as well as the character's ever-changing location, such as in later instalments in the ''Zelda'' series, or many ''Final Fantasy'' games.\n\nOther games, including several instalments in the ''Ultima'' and ''Wasteland'' series, include detailed, often colourful maps on cloth or paper that came bundled with the game and is meant to be used to navigate while playing the game. Games like ''Miracle Warriors'' even came with a little action figure in metal meant to be placed on your position.\n\nWhatever the map style employed (if any), varied world map terrain such as mountains, rivers and deserts may prevent the character(s) from visiting an area until they have completed a certain task or acquired a special skill, vehicle or other key item.{{efn|For example, in many [[The Legend of Zelda (series)|''Zelda'']] games, [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] must obtain an item hidden in one dungeon that will allow him to progress to the next dungeon. Often, these items can be obtained only after completing a side quest or reaching a certain point in the game.}} Many [[Role-playing video game|CRPGs]] eventually allow the player rapid movement around the overworld, using such methods as flying,{{efn|Many games, most notably those of the [[Final Fantasy|''Final Fantasy'' series]], provide [[airship]]s for flying. Other games will feature flying animals such as large birds, [[Chocobo]]s or [[dragon]]s.}} sailing, or [[Teleportation|teleporting]] to various locations. The map icon is often represented as a rectangle. Usually, flying or sailing across one edge of the map will bring the character(s) to the edge of the opposite side.\n\nIn some games, certain areas of the overworld map are hidden from the player, or at least difficult to reach; these \"secret\" areas often contain difficult-to-obtain items, or they might simply hold [[Easter egg (virtual)|\"Easter Egg\"]]-style novelties or other such diversions. In some games, especially those that have a \"level select\" style of overworld (e.g. a lot of old-school [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[platform game]]s), portions of the overworld become available for play as certain tasks are completed (e.g. beating a particular level or discovering a secret hidden within a level).\n\n==Audio design==\nIn terms of [[video game music]], overworld themes are often orchestral in nature, and of greater length and complexity than other pieces in the same game, due to the amount of time spent traveling the overworld map.{{cn|date=June 2017}} Because players will usually visit a single level or area a few times in a given play session, the music for any such section of the game will typically be shorter and/or less complex,<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89565567 \"The Evolution of Video Game Music\"], ''[[All Things Considered]]'', July 28, 2008.</ref> and thus less time-consuming for the designers to produce. The overworld theme frequently functions as a main theme of a game, often used as a [[Motif (music)|motif]] for other tracks (e.g., a \"romance\" theme features the main melody of overworld theme, orchestrated in a different key).<ref>[http://www.ubu.com/sound/price/video/price_video_vidz.pdf Early Video Game Soundtracks] 2001 article on video game music, orig. published in In Magazine.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Level (video gaming)|Level]]\n* [[Level design]]\n* [[Open world]]\n* [[Role-playing video game]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Video game gameplay]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the video game concept}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n {{Missing information|the history of overworlds in video games|date=June 2010}}\n {{Refimprove|date=September 2007}}\n {{Original research|date=September 2007}}\n}}\n<!-- Most of the content of this article is taken by the authors from primary sources, i.e. the video games themselves.

[[Incidental music]] for the original production was written by [[Darius Milhaud]].<ref>Jean Anouilh, ''Le Voyageur sans bagage'': Edition de Bernard Beugnot, Gallimard, Paris 2007</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nGaston, a veteran of [[World War I]], suffers from [[amnesia]] and has spent the last 18 years in a hospital trying to regain his memories. Although he's claimed as a son by various families, a rich Duchess believes the true family Gaston belongs to is the Renauds. Gaston travels to the Renauds' estate alongside his lawyer, Huspar. A docile character, Gaston discovers his former identity of Jacques Renaud: a cruel and violent young man who used to kill animals for sport. He learns that immediately prior to the war he pushed his best friend, Marcel, down a flight of stairs, breaking his back, shortly after seeing him kiss the maid Juliette, with whom Jacques had been intimate. Gaston has difficulty reconciling his current personality with that of his past. His brother's wife, Valentine (with whom he had an affair during adolescence), tells him about a tiny scar on his shoulder, sustained when Valentine attacked him with a hat pin in a fit of jealousy. Gaston sees this scar in a mirror but doesn't tell Valentine about it. Soon thereafter, numerous families arrive at the Renaud estate, searching for their lost loved one from the war. Gaston spots a young boy. This boy, who is the only surviving member of the Madensales, a family who died in a boating accident when he was an infant, is searching for his long-lost nephew who happens to be much older than himself. Gaston tells the young boy about the scar on his shoulder and fabricates a story about the scar belonging to the boy's long-lost nephew. Gaston leaves the Renauds to become a member of the boy's family, later writing a letter to Jacques' brother Georges, stating that their Jacques is dead and they need not search for him any longer.\n\n==Inspiration and reception==\nInspired by the story of an amnesiac soldier, [[Anthelme Mangin]], who was claimed by over a dozen families,<ref>Jean Yves Le Naour, ''Le Soldat inconnu vivant'', Hachette Litt\u00e9rature, Paris 2002</ref> the play was first produced on 16 February 1937 and was Anouilh's first major hit with critics and audiences alike.

{"title_page": "Theodiscus", "text_new": "{{redirect|Teutsch|the painter with this surname|J\u00e1nos Mattis-Teutsch}}\n\n'''''{{lang|la|Theodiscus}}''''' (in [[Medieval Latin]], corresponding to Old English '''\u00fe\u0113odisc''', Old High German ''' diutisc''' and other early [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] reflexes of [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] '''*\u00feiudiskaz''', meaning \"popular\" or \"of the people\") was a term used in the early Middle Ages to refer to the West Germanic languages. The Latin term was borrowed from the Germanic adjective meaning \"of the people\" but, unlike it, was used ''only'' to refer to languages. In [[Early Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[Western Europe]] non-native Latin was the language of science, church and administration, hence Latin ''theodiscus'' and its Germanic counterparts were used as [[antonym]]s of Latin, to refer to the \"native language spoken by the general populace\". They were subsequently used in the [[Frankish Empire]] to denote the native [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[vernacular]]s. As such, they were no longer used as antonym of Latin, but of [[Walha|''walhisk'']], a language descendant from Latin, but nevertheless the speech of the general populace as well.<ref>M. Philippa e.a. (2003-2009) Etymologisch Woordenboek van het Nederlands [diets]</ref> In doing so Latin ''theodiscus'' and the Germanic reflexes of {{wikt-lang|gem-pro|*\u00feiudiskaz}} effectively obtained the meaning of \"Germanic\", or more specifically one of its local varieties \u2013 resulting in the English [[exonym]] {{wikt-lang|en|Dutch}}, the German [[endonym]] {{wikt-lang|de|deutsch|Deutsch}}, the Dutch exonym {{wikt-lang|nl|Duits}}, and the Dutch endonym {{wikt-lang|nl|Diets}}, all of which are [[cognate]]s of ''theodiscus'', which in Italian yielded {{wikt-lang|it|tedesco|tedesco}}.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Theodiscus'' is derived from West Germanic *''\u00feiudisk'',<ref>W. Haubrichs, \"''Theodiscus'', Deutsch und Germanisch - drei Ethnonyme, drei Forschungsbegriffe. Zur Frage der Instrumentalisierung und Wertbesetzung deutscher Sprach- und Volksbezeichnungen.\" In: H. Beck et al., ''Zur Geschichte der Gleichung \"germanisch-deutsch\"'' (2004), 199-228</ref> from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] {{wikt-lang|gem-pro|*\u00feiudiskaz}}. The stem of this word, {{wikt-lang|gem-pro|*\u00feeud\u014d}}, meant \"people\" in Proto-Germanic, and {{wikt-lang|gem-pro|*-iskaz}} was an adjective-forming suffix, of which {{wikt-lang|en|-ish}} is the [[Modern English]] cognate with the same meaning. The [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word {{wikt-lang|ine-pro|*tewt\u00e9h\u2082}} (\"tribe\", \"people\"), which is commonly reconstructed as the basis of the word, is related to [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''{{wikt-lang|lt|taut\u00e0}}'' (\"nation\"), [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] ''{{wikt-lang|sga|t\u00faath}}'' (\"tribe\", \"people\") and [[Oscan language|Oscan]] ''touto'' (\"community\").<ref>{{citation|title=The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World\n|last=Mallory |first=J.&nbsp;P. |last2= Adams|first2=D.&nbsp;Q.|authorlink2=Douglas Q.

It survives as the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] word ''{{wikt-lang|is|\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0}}'' for \"people, nation\", the [[Nynorsk|Norwegian]] word ''{{wikt-lang|nn|tjod}}'' for \"people\", \"nation\", and the word \"German\" in many languages including German ''{{lang|de|[[German language|Deutsch]]}}'', Dutch ''{{wikt-lang|nl|Duits}}'', [[Yiddish]] ''{{wikt-lang|yi|\u05d3\u05f2\u05b7\u05d8\u05e9}}'', [[Danish language|Danish]] ''{{wikt-lang|da|tysk}}'', [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''{{wikt-lang|no|tysk}}'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''{{wikt-lang|sv|tyska}}'' and [[Italian language|Italian]] ''{{wikt-lang|it|tedesco}}''.\n\nThe word ''{{wikt-lang|en|theodism}}'', a [[neologism]] for a branch of [[Germanic neopaganism]], is based on the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] form of the word, where ''{{wikt-lang|got|\ud800\udf38\ud800\udf39\ud800\udf3f\ud800\udf33\ud800\udf39\ud800\udf43\ud800\udf3a\ud800\udf49|\u00feiudisko}}'' also took on the meaning of \"[[pagan]]\"<ref>J. de Vries (1971), Nederlands Etymologisch Woordenboek [diets]</ref>, a Judeo-Christian calque on similar formations such as \"[[Gentile]]\" from Latin ''gens'' (\"people\") and Hebrew [[goy]], i.e. \"belonging to (other) peoples\". [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] borrowed the word as {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*\u0165u\u010f\u044c}} with the meaning \"foreign\" (thus the opposite of the original meaning \"native\"), giving rise, for example, to modern [[Polish language|Polish]] ''{{wikt-lang|pl|cudzy}}'', [[Czech language|Czech]] ''{{wikt-lang|cs|ciz\u00ed}}'', [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croat]] ''{{wikt-lang|sh|tu\u0111i}}'' and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''{{wikt-lang|ru|\u0447\u0443\u0436\u043e\u0439}}''.\n\nWhile [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] similar, the Latin root ''{{wikt-lang|en|Teuton|Teutonic}}'' for \"Germanic\" is more distantly related, and originally a name of a Celtic or Germanic tribe that inhabited coastal Germany. It came probably via Celtic from Proto-Germanic ''{{wikt-lang|gem-pro|*\u00feeudanaz}}'' (\"ruler\", \"leader of the people\"), from ''{{wikt-lang|gem-pro|*\u00feeud\u014d}}'' (\"people, tribe\"), from Proto-Indo-European ''{{wikt-lang|ine-pro|*tewt\u00e9h\u2082}}'' (\"people\", \"tribe\").<ref>http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Teutonic</ref>\n\n== Semantic development within English ==\nCurrently, the first known attestation of ''theodiscus'' is to be found in a letter written around the year [[786]] by the [[Bishop of Ostia]]. In the letter, the bishop writes to [[Pope Adrian I]] about a [[synod]] taking place in [[Corbridge]], [[England]]; where the decisions were later read aloud elsewhere \"tam Latine quam theodisce\", meaning \"in Latin as well as the vernacular / common tongue\".<ref>D\u00fcmmler, Ernst.

It was rarely used as a descriptor of ethnicity or identity, as the [[Anglo-Saxons]] referred to themselves as ''Seaxe'', ''Iutas'' or ''Engle'', respectively meaning [[Saxons]], [[Jutes]] and [[Angles]]. The latter term would later give rise to the adjective ''{{wikt-lang|en|Englisc}}'', which during the [[Early Middle Ages]] become the term for all speakers of the Germanic dialects now collectively known as [[Old English]].<ref>Farmer, David Hugh (1978). The Oxford Dictionary of Saints. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19282-038-9}}.</ref>\n\nBy the late [[14th century]], ''\u00fe\u0113odisc'' had given rise to [[Middle English]] ''duche'' and its variants, which were used as a blanket term for all the non-Scandinavian [[Germanic languages]] spoken on the European mainland. Historical linguists have noted that the medieval \"Duche\" itself most likely shows an external [[Middle Dutch]] influence, in that it shows a [[voiced alveolar stop]] rather than the expected [[voiced dental fricative]]. This would be a logical result of the [[Medieval English wool trade]], which brought the English in close linguistic contact with the cloth merchants living in the Dutch-speaking cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]], who at the time, referred to their language as ''dietsc''.<ref>P.A.F. van Veen en N. van der Sijs (1997), Etymologisch woordenboek: de herkomst van onze woorden, 2e druk, Van Dale Lexicografie, Utrecht/Antwerpen</ref>\n\nIts exact meaning is dependant on context, but tends to be vague regardless.<ref>H. Kurath: Middle English Dictionary, part 14, University of Michigan Press, 1952, 1346.</ref> When concerning language, the word ''duche'' could be used as a hypernym for several languages (The North est Contrey which lond spekyn all maner Duche tonge \u2014 The North [of Europe] is an area, in which all lands speak all manner of \"Dutch\" languages) but it could also suggest singular use (In Duche a rudder is a knyght \u2014 In \"Dutch\" a rudder [cf. [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ridder] is a knight) in which case linguistic and/or geographic pointers need to be use to determine or approximate what the author would have meant in modern terms.<ref>H. Kurath: Middle English Dictionary, part 14, University of Michigan Press, 1952, 1345.</ref><ref>H. Kurath: Middle English Dictionary, part 14, University of Michigan Press, 1952, 1345.</ref> For example, in his poem ''Constantyne'', the English chronicler [[John Hardyng]] (1378 \u2013 1465) specifically mentions the inhabitants of three Dutch-speaking fiefdoms (Flanders, Guelders and Brabant) as travel companions, but also lists the far more general \"Dutchem\u0113ne\" and \"Almains\", the latter term having an almost equally broad meaning, though being more restricted in its geographical use; usually referring to people and locaties within modern [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]]:    \n\n{{Verse translation|lang=eng|He went to Roome with greate power of Britons strong, \nwith Flemynges and Barbayns, Henauldes, Gelders, Burgonians, & Frenche, \nDutchem\u0113ne, Lub\u0101rdes, also many Almains.<ref>F.C. and J.

Rivington, The Chronicle of Iohn Hardyng\n}}\n\nBy early [[17th century]], general use of the word Dutch had become exceedingly rare in [[Great Britain]] and it became an [[exonym]] specifically tied to [[Dutch people|the modern Dutch]], ie. the [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] inhabitants of the [[Low Countries]]. Many factors facilitated this, including close geographic proximity, trade and [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|military conflicts]].<ref>M. Philippa e.a. (2003-2009) Etymologisch Woordenboek van het Nederlands [Duits]</ref><ref>L. Weisgerber, Deutsch als Volksname 1953</ref> Due to the latter, \"Dutch\" also became pejorative label pinned by English speakers on almost anything they regard as inferior, irregular, or contrary to their own practice. Examples include \"Dutch treat\" (each person paying for himself), \"Dutch courage\" (boldness inspired by alcohol), \"Dutch wife\" (a type of [[sex doll]]) and \"Double Dutch\" (gibberish) among others.<ref>Rawson, Hugh, Wicked Words, Crown Publishers, 1989.</ref>\n\nIn the [[United States]], the word \"Dutch\" remained somewhat ambiguous until the start of the [[19th century]]. Generally, it referred to the Dutch, their language or the [[Dutch Republic]], but it was also used as an informal monniker (for example in the works of [[James Fenimore Cooper]] and [[Washington Irving]]) for people who would today be considered Germans or German-speaking, most notably the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]]. This lingering ambiguity was most likely caused by close proximity to German-speaking immigrants, who referred to themselves or (in the case of the Pennsylvania Dutch) their language as \"Deutsch\" or \"Deitsch\".<ref>Hughes Oliphant Old: The Reading and Preaching of the Scriptures in the Worship of the Christian Church, Volume 6: The Modern Age. Eerdmans Publishing, 2007, p. 606.</ref><ref>Mark L. Louden: Pennsylvania Dutch: The Story of an American Language. JHU Press, 2006, p.2</ref><ref>Irwin Richman: The Pennsylvania Dutch Country. Arcadia Publishing, 2004, p.16.</ref>\n\n== Referring to the German language==\nThe second recorded use of \"theodisca\" as a reference to a Germanic language was [[Old High German]]. In 788, the Annals of the Frankish Kingdom report the punishment of a [[Bavaria]]n [[Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria|duke]]: \"quod theodisca lingua herisliz dictum\", meaning \"known in the language of the people as herisliz\". ''Herisliz''  is a German word now obsolete: the \"slicing\", i.e. tearing apart of the \"[[army|Heer]]\" ([[Desertion]]).<ref>M. Philippa e.a. (2003-2009) Etymologisch Woordenboek van het Nederlands [diets]</ref>\n\nIn German dialects, a large amount of forms of \"theodiscus\" existed throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and which all referred to either the broader Romance/Germanic [[dichotomy]] in the West and South or the [[Slavic language|Slavic]]/Germanic bipartition in the East. In [[Old High German]] both ''diutisk'' and ''diutisc'' are known, that developed in [[Middle High German]] as ''diutsc''. In [[Middle Low German]] it was known as ''{{wikt-lang|de|d\u00fcdesch}}'' and [[Low German|Modern Low German]] as ''{{wikt-lang|de|d\u00fctsch}}''. However, in German, the use of the term referring to Germans specifically as opposed to people speaking Germanic languages in general evolves during the [[Early Modern Period]] and it is in the late 17th and 18th century that the modern meaning of ''{{wikt-lang|de|deutsch|Deutsch}}'' is established.<ref>L. Weisgerber, Deutsch als Volksname 1953</ref>\n\nIn the [[United States]] the German [[Exonym and endonym|autonym]] ''Deutsch'' would sometimes be rendered as ''Dutch'', due to the perceived similar pronunciation of both words and also due to the fact that, early on, ''Dutch'' was not reserved only for the people of the [[Netherlands]] but for any Germanic speakers from the Continent. A well known example are the ''[[Pennsylvania Dutch]]'', who are not of Dutch descent but originally German immigrants, and speak not Dutch but a German dialect and refer to themselves as ''{{wikt-lang|de|deitsch|Pennsilfaanisch Deitsch}}''.<ref>The Pennsylvania Dutch Country, by I. Richman, 2004: \"Taking the name Pennsylvania Dutch from a corruption of their own word for themselves, \"Deutsch,\" the first German settlers arrived in Pennsylvania in 1683. By the time of the American Revolution, their influence was such that Benjamin Franklin, among others, worried that German would become the commonwealth's official language.\"</ref><ref>Moon Spotlight Pennsylvania Dutch Country, by A. Dubrovsk, 2004.</ref><ref>Pennsylvania Dutch Alphabet, by C. Williamson.</ref>\n\n== Referring to the Dutch language==\n{{see also|Low Countries (terminology)}}\nFrom [[Old Dutch]] ''*thiudisk'' a southern variant ''duutsc'' and a western variant ''dietsc'' developed in [[Middle Dutch]]. In a broader meaning it could refer to the Germanic as opposed to Romance-language area, while in a narrow sense, ''duutsc'' and ''dietsc'' referred to the Dutch language. It developed in Modern Dutch in ''Duyts'' and ''{{wikt-lang|nl|Diets}}'' respectively and used alongside ''{{wikt-lang|nl|Nederlands}}'', which referred exclusively to Dutch and would become the modern Dutch [[Exonym and endonym|autonym]], while ''Duyts'' (later ''Duits'', though not ''Diets'') would increasingly come to refer to German as opposed to Dutch.<ref>M. Philippa e.a. (2003-2009) Etymologisch Woordenboek van het Nederlands [Duits]</ref><ref>J. de Vries (1971), Nederlands Etymologisch Woordenboek</ref> During the 16th century, when the process described above had not completed itself, some Dutch linguists and scholars used the term ''Nederduits''/''Nederduyts'', combining both words, to refer to the Dutch language. A practice which ended in the 19th century but which can still be found in [[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK)|Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa]] which calls itself the \"Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk\". ''Nederduits'' is to be translated as \"Dutch\" in English, not as \"Low German\" which would be the literal translation in Modern Dutch.<ref>M. Philippa e.a. (2003-2009) Etymologisch Woordenboek van het Nederlands [Duits]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Middle Dutch]] form of ''duutsc''/''dietsc'' was borrowed into English and was then mainly used to refer to the inhabitants of the [[Low Countries]], with whom there was extensive trade. Though initially also encompassing a broader definition signifying \"speakers of [[Germanic languages]] on the continent / Non-[[Romance languages|Romance]] speakers\" the use of the word ''Dutch'' in this sense was rare and would become obsolete following the growing and intensive rivalry between [[England]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] during the 17th century.<ref>M.

The Latin term was borrowed from the Germanic adjective meaning \"of the people\" but, unlike it, was used ''only'' to refer to languages. In [[Early Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[Western Europe]] non-native Latin was the language of science, church and administration, hence Latin ''theodiscus'' and its Germanic counterparts were used as [[antonym]]s of Latin, to refer to the \"native language spoken by the general populace\". They were subsequently used in the [[Frankish Empire]] to denote the native [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[vernacular]]s. As such, they were no longer used as antonym of Latin, but of [[Walha|''walhisk'']], a language descendant from Latin, but nevertheless the speech of the general populace as well.<ref>M. Philippa e.a. (2003-2009) Etymologisch Woordenboek van het Nederlands [diets]</ref> In doing so Latin ''theodiscus'' and the Germanic reflexes of {{wikt-lang|gem-pro|*\u00feiudiskaz}} effectively obtained the meaning of \"Germanic\", or more specifically one of its local varieties \u2013 resulting in the English [[exonym]] {{wikt-lang|en|Dutch}}, the German [[endonym]] {{wikt-lang|de|deutsch|Deutsch}}, the Dutch exonym {{wikt-lang|nl|Duits}}, and the Dutch endonym {{wikt-lang|nl|Diets}}, all of which are [[cognate]]s of ''theodiscus'', which in Italian yielded {{wikt-lang|it|tedesco|tedesco}}.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Theodiscus'' is derived from West Germanic *''\u00feiudisk'',<ref>W. Haubrichs, \"''Theodiscus'', Deutsch und Germanisch - drei Ethnonyme, drei Forschungsbegriffe. Zur Frage der Instrumentalisierung und Wertbesetzung deutscher Sprach- und Volksbezeichnungen.\" In: H.

The stem of this word, {{wikt-lang|gem-pro|*\u00feeud\u014d}}, meant \"people\" in Proto-Germanic, and {{wikt-lang|gem-pro|*-iskaz}} was an adjective-forming suffix, of which {{wikt-lang|en|-ish}} is the [[Modern English]] cognate with the same meaning. The [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word {{wikt-lang|ine-pro|*tewt\u00e9h\u2082}} (\"tribe\", \"people\"), which is commonly reconstructed as the basis of the word, is related to [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''{{wikt-lang|lt|taut\u00e0}}'' (\"nation\"), [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] ''{{wikt-lang|sga|t\u00faath}}'' (\"tribe\", \"people\") and [[Oscan language|Oscan]] ''touto'' (\"community\").<ref>{{citation|title=The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World\n|last=Mallory |first=J.&nbsp;P. |last2= Adams|first2=D.&nbsp;Q.|authorlink2=Douglas Q.

It survives as the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] word ''{{wikt-lang|is|\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0}}'' for \"people, nation\", the [[Nynorsk|Norwegian]] word ''{{wikt-lang|nn|tjod}}'' for \"people\", \"nation\", and the word \"German\" in many languages including German ''{{lang|de|[[German language|Deutsch]]}}'', Dutch ''{{wikt-lang|nl|Duits}}'', [[Yiddish]] ''{{wikt-lang|yi|\u05d3\u05f2\u05b7\u05d8\u05e9}}'', [[Danish language|Danish]] ''{{wikt-lang|da|tysk}}'', [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''{{wikt-lang|no|tysk}}'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''{{wikt-lang|sv|tyska}}'' and [[Italian language|Italian]] ''{{wikt-lang|it|tedesco}}''.\n\nThe word ''{{wikt-lang|en|theodism}}'', a [[neologism]] for a branch of [[Germanic neopaganism]], is based on the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] form of the word, where ''{{wikt-lang|got|\ud800\udf38\ud800\udf39\ud800\udf3f\ud800\udf33\ud800\udf39\ud800\udf43\ud800\udf3a\ud800\udf49|\u00feiudisko}}'' also took on the meaning of \"[[pagan]]\"<ref>J. de Vries (1971), Nederlands Etymologisch Woordenboek [diets]</ref>, a Judeo-Christian calque on similar formations such as \"[[Gentile]]\" from Latin ''gens'' (\"people\") and Hebrew [[goy]], i.e. \"belonging to (other) peoples\". [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] borrowed the word as {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*\u0165u\u010f\u044c}} with the meaning \"foreign\" (thus the opposite of the original meaning \"native\"), giving rise, for example, to modern [[Polish language|Polish]] ''{{wikt-lang|pl|cudzy}}'', [[Czech language|Czech]] ''{{wikt-lang|cs|ciz\u00ed}}'', [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croat]] ''{{wikt-lang|sh|tu\u0111i}}'' and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''{{wikt-lang|ru|\u0447\u0443\u0436\u043e\u0439}}''.\n\nWhile [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] similar, the Latin root ''{{wikt-lang|en|Teuton|Teutonic}}'' for \"Germanic\" is more distantly related, and originally a name of a Celtic or Germanic tribe that inhabited coastal Germany. It came probably via Celtic from Proto-Germanic ''{{wikt-lang|gem-pro|*\u00feeudanaz}}'' (\"ruler\", \"leader of the people\"), from ''{{wikt-lang|gem-pro|*\u00feeud\u014d}}'' (\"people, tribe\"), from Proto-Indo-European ''{{wikt-lang|ine-pro|*tewt\u00e9h\u2082}}'' (\"people\", \"tribe\").<ref>http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Teutonic</ref>\n\n== Semantic development within English ==\nCurrently, the first known attestation of ''theodiscus'' is to be found in a letter written around the year [[786]] by the [[Bishop of Ostia]]. In the letter, the bishop writes to [[Pope Adrian I]] about a [[synod]] taking place in [[Corbridge]], [[England]]; where the decisions were later read aloud elsewhere \"tam Latine quam theodisce\", meaning \"in Latin as well as the vernacular / common tongue\".<ref>D\u00fcmmler, Ernst.

It was rarely used as a descriptor of ethnicity or identity, as the [[Anglo-Saxons]] referred to themselves as ''Seaxe'', ''Iutas'' or ''Engle'', respectively meaning [[Saxons]], [[Jutes]] and [[Angles]]. The latter term would later give rise to the adjective ''{{wikt-lang|en|Englisc}}'', which during the [[Early Middle Ages]] become the term for all speakers of the Germanic dialects now collectively known as [[Old English]].<ref>Farmer, David Hugh (1978). The Oxford Dictionary of Saints. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19282-038-9}}.</ref>\n\nBy the late [[14th century]], ''\u00fe\u0113odisc'' had given rise to [[Middle English]] ''duche'' and its variants, which were used as a blanket term for all the non-Scandinavian [[Germanic languages]] spoken on the European mainland. Historical linguists have noted that the medieval \"Duche\" itself most likely shows an external [[Middle Dutch]] influence, in that it shows a [[voiced alveolar stop]] rather than the expected [[voiced dental fricative]]. This would be a logical result of the [[Medieval English wool trade]], which brought the English in close linguistic contact with the cloth merchants living in the Dutch-speaking cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent|Gent]], who at the time, referred to their language as ''dietsc''.<ref>P.A.F. van Veen en N. van der Sijs (1997), Etymologisch woordenboek: de herkomst van onze woorden, 2e druk, Van Dale Lexicografie, Utrecht/Antwerpen</ref>\n\nIts exact meaning is dependant on context, but tends to be vague regardless.<ref>H. Kurath: Middle English Dictionary, part 14, University of Michigan Press, 1952, 1346.</ref> When concerning language, the word ''duche'' could be used as a hypernym for several languages (The North est Contrey which lond spekyn all maner Duche tonge \u2014 The North [of Europe] is an area, in which all lands speak all manner of \"Dutch\" languages) but it could also suggest singular use (In Duche a rudder is a knyght \u2014 In \"Dutch\" a rudder [cf. [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ridder] is a knight) in which case linguistic and/or geographic pointers need to be use to determine or approximate what the author would have meant in modern terms.<ref>H. Kurath: Middle English Dictionary, part 14, University of Michigan Press, 1952, 1345.</ref><ref>H. Kurath: Middle English Dictionary, part 14, University of Michigan Press, 1952, 1345.</ref> For example, in his poem ''Constantyne'', the English chronicler [[John Hardyng]] (1378 \u2013 1465) specifically mentions the inhabitants of three Dutch-speaking fiefdoms (Flanders, Guelders and Brabant) as travel companions, but also lists the far more general \"Dutchem\u0113ne\" and \"Almains\", the latter term having an almost equally broad meaning, though being more restricted in its geographical use; usually referring to people and locaties within modern [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]]:    \n\n{{Verse translation|lang=eng|He went to Roome with greate power of Britons strong, \nwith Flemynges and Barbayns, Henauldes, Gelders, Burgonians, & Frenche, \nDutchem\u0113ne, Lub\u0101rdes, also many Almains.<ref>F.C. and J.

Rivington, The Chronicle of Iohn Hardyng\n}}\n\nBy early [[17th century]], general use of the word Dutch had become exceedingly rare in [[Great Britain]] and it became an [[exonym]] specifically tied to [[Dutch people|the modern Dutch]], ie. the [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] inhabitants of the [[Low Countries]]. Many factors facilitated this, including close geographic proximity, trade and [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|military conflicts]].<ref>M. Philippa e.a. (2003-2009) Etymologisch Woordenboek van het Nederlands [Duits]</ref><ref>L. Weisgerber, Deutsch als Volksname 1953</ref> Due to the latter, \"Dutch\" also became pejorative label pinned by English speakers on almost anything they regard as inferior, irregular, or contrary to their own practice. Examples include \"Dutch treat\" (each person paying for himself), \"Dutch courage\" (boldness inspired by alcohol), \"Dutch wife\" (a type of [[sex doll]]) and \"Double Dutch\" (gibberish) among others.<ref>Rawson, Hugh, Wicked Words, Crown Publishers, 1989.</ref>\n\nIn the [[United States]], the word \"Dutch\" remained somewhat ambiguous until the start of the [[19th century]]. Generally, it referred to the Dutch, their language or the [[Dutch Republic]], but it was also used as an informal monniker (for example in the works of [[James Fenimore Cooper]] and [[Washington Irving]]) for people who would today be considered Germans or German-speaking, most notably the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]]. This lingering ambiguity was most likely caused by close proximity to German-speaking immigrants, who referred to themselves or (in the case of the Pennsylvania Dutch) their language as \"Deutsch\" or \"Deitsch\".<ref>Hughes Oliphant Old: The Reading and Preaching of the Scriptures in the Worship of the Christian Church, Volume 6: The Modern Age. Eerdmans Publishing, 2007, p. 606.</ref><ref>Mark L. Louden: Pennsylvania Dutch: The Story of an American Language. JHU Press, 2006, p.2</ref><ref>Irwin Richman: The Pennsylvania Dutch Country. Arcadia Publishing, 2004, p.16.</ref>\n\n== Referring to the German language==\nThe second recorded use of \"theodisca\" as a reference to a Germanic language was [[Old High German]]. In 788, the Annals of the Frankish Kingdom report the punishment of a [[Bavaria]]n [[Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria|duke]]: \"quod theodisca lingua herisliz dictum\", meaning \"known in the language of the people as herisliz\". ''Herisliz''  is a German word now obsolete: the \"slicing\", i.e. tearing apart of the \"[[army|Heer]]\" ([[Desertion]]).<ref>M. Philippa e.a. (2003-2009) Etymologisch Woordenboek van het Nederlands [diets]</ref>\n\nIn German dialects, a large amount of forms of \"theodiscus\" existed throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and which all referred to either the broader Romance/Germanic [[dichotomy]] in the West and South or the [[Slavic language|Slavic]]/Germanic bipartition in the East. In [[Old High German]] both ''diutisk'' and ''diutisc'' are known, that developed in [[Middle High German]] as ''diutsc''. In [[Middle Low German]] it was known as ''{{wikt-lang|de|d\u00fcdesch}}'' and [[Low German|Modern Low German]] as ''{{wikt-lang|de|d\u00fctsch}}''. However, in German, the use of the term referring to Germans specifically as opposed to people speaking Germanic languages in general evolves during the [[Early Modern Period]] and it is in the late 17th and 18th century that the modern meaning of ''{{wikt-lang|de|deutsch|Deutsch}}'' is established.<ref>L. Weisgerber, Deutsch als Volksname 1953</ref>\n\nIn the [[United States]] the German [[Exonym and endonym|autonym]] ''Deutsch'' would sometimes be rendered as ''Dutch'', due to the perceived similar pronunciation of both words and also due to the fact that, early on, ''Dutch'' was not reserved only for the people of the [[Netherlands]] but for any Germanic speakers from the Continent. A well known example are the ''[[Pennsylvania Dutch]]'', who are not of Dutch descent but originally German immigrants, and speak not Dutch but a German dialect and refer to themselves as ''{{wikt-lang|de|deitsch|Pennsilfaanisch Deitsch}}''.<ref>The Pennsylvania Dutch Country, by I. Richman, 2004: \"Taking the name Pennsylvania Dutch from a corruption of their own word for themselves, \"Deutsch,\" the first German settlers arrived in Pennsylvania in 1683. By the time of the American Revolution, their influence was such that Benjamin Franklin, among others, worried that German would become the commonwealth's official language.\"</ref><ref>Moon Spotlight Pennsylvania Dutch Country, by A. Dubrovsk, 2004.</ref><ref>Pennsylvania Dutch Alphabet, by C. Williamson.</ref>\n\n== Referring to the Dutch language==\n{{see also|Low Countries (terminology)}}\nFrom [[Old Dutch]] ''*thiudisk'' a southern variant ''duutsc'' and a western variant ''dietsc'' developed in [[Middle Dutch]]. In a broader meaning it could refer to the Germanic as opposed to Romance-language area, while in a narrow sense, ''duutsc'' and ''dietsc'' referred to the Dutch language. It developed in Modern Dutch in ''Duyts'' and ''{{wikt-lang|nl|Diets}}'' respectively and used alongside ''{{wikt-lang|nl|Nederlands}}'', which referred exclusively to Dutch and would become the modern Dutch [[Exonym and endonym|autonym]], while ''Duyts'' (later ''Duits'', though not ''Diets'') would increasingly come to refer to German as opposed to Dutch.<ref>M. Philippa e.a. (2003-2009) Etymologisch Woordenboek van het Nederlands [Duits]</ref><ref>J. de Vries (1971), Nederlands Etymologisch Woordenboek</ref> During the 16th century, when the process described above had not completed itself, some Dutch linguists and scholars used the term ''Nederduits''/''Nederduyts'', combining both words, to refer to the Dutch language. A practice which ended in the 19th century but which can still be found in [[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK)|Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa]] which calls itself the \"Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk\". ''Nederduits'' is to be translated as \"Dutch\" in English, not as \"Low German\" which would be the literal translation in Modern Dutch.<ref>M. Philippa e.a. (2003-2009) Etymologisch Woordenboek van het Nederlands [Duits]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Middle Dutch]] form of ''duutsc''/''dietsc'' was borrowed into English and was then mainly used to refer to the inhabitants of the [[Low Countries]], with whom there was extensive trade. Though initially also encompassing a broader definition signifying \"speakers of [[Germanic languages]] on the continent / Non-[[Romance languages|Romance]] speakers\" the use of the word ''Dutch'' in this sense was rare and would become obsolete following the growing and intensive rivalry between [[England]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] during the 17th century.<ref>M.

Both cities with a tradition of close relations with Greece, which made it natural that they should be among the first to be chosen by HFC.\n\n=== Cavafy Museum ===\n\n[[File:S1210342 2.jpg|thumb|Philike Etairia - dining room]]\nThe Cavafy Museum was an initiative of Kostis Moskof (1939\u201398) in Alexandria at 1992. The museum is one of the houses where C.P. Cavafy lived the last 35 years of his life. The interior of the house has been recreated in detail to resemble the Cavafy\u2019s days, the exhibits document the poet\u2019s life and work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hfc-worldwide.org/museums/cavafy-museum/|title=Cavafy Museum - Hellenic Foundation for Culture|website=hfc-worldwide.org|accessdate=27 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Philike Etairia Museum ===\nThe Philike Etairia Museum was established at 1979. In 1994 the museum moved to its historical location, the building where Athanasios Tsakalof, Nikolaos Skoufas and Emmanuel Xanthos founded Philike Etairia (Friendly Society) in 1814. The Friendly Society made preparations for the Greek War of independence of 1821. Prominent Greeks such as Grigorios Maraslis, a great benefactor who was Mayor of Odessa for some years, left their mark permanently on the face of the city.\n\nBetween 1991 and 1993 the Hellenic Foundation for Culture restored the Odessa museum in cooperation with private individuals, the Odessa Museum of Regional History and museums from Greece.<ref>Iris Magazine, Issue 1-2 1993, Hellenic Foundation for Culture, page 33</ref>\n\n== Initiatives ==\n'''\u039c\u03b9\u03bb\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u2013 We Speak Greek''' HFC offers lessons in Modern Greek at its branches in Alexandria, Belgrade, Bucharest, Odessa, and Trieste.
