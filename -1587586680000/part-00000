Hubert Pailissen, [[Society of African Missions|SMA]], in early 1949, said; \"In this country, scarcely 15 percent of the school-going youth are girls.

They were to continue the running of an already-established elementary school, the St. Bernadette School, now popularly called '''Roman Girls''<nowiki/>'. True to character, the St. Louis Sisters, who never do things by the halves, decided to establish a new secondary school on the same compound.\n\nIn 1952, St. Louis Secondary was opened, with an initial group of 12 girls. Only some out of this group survived to join the second group of 1953 to make 42. By December 1957, when the surviving group wrote their \"O\" Level Examination, they numbered 11.\n\nMost of the salaries of the Sisters, funds raised, and Diocesan contributions went into developing the compound and acquiring necessary inputs.\n\nThe church wanted the Apostolate of Education to develop the essential task of forming strong and enlightened Christians, capable of exercising much influence in social and political affairs. Perhaps, there is no branch that needed more attention than female education.\n\nLong before \"''Girl child\"'' education became a popular slogan, the Catholic Church and St. Louis understood the depth of its importance. That is why the St. Louis Sisters and the Church always adopted an holistic approach to education.\n\n<nowiki/>''<nowiki/>''\n\nDespite staffing and financial difficulties, the student population continued to grow. It was clear that further accommodation had to be provided. Through the kindness of Nana Osei Agyemang Prempeh II (the then Asantehene of blessed memory), the requisite site was given, and funds were provided by both the Diocese and the Sisters.\n\nSucceeding reports of inspectors testified to the excellence of teaching given by the Sisters. These reports paid tribute to the school\u2019s \"''air of efficiency''\" and its \"''very good organization and discipline''\". It was upon these commendations that the Ministry of Education, in 1960, wished the Sisters would open a Training College on the site on which St. Louis Secondary School now stands. That same year, 1960, a change-over took place, and St. Louis Secondary School moved to its present site. The foundation stone was laid by the late Otumfuo Osei Agyemang Prempeh II, Asantehene, on 25 March 1960 (the feast of Annunciation) and was blessed by Rt. Rev. Andrew van den Bronk (SMA), then Bishop of Kumasi.\n\nIn the same year, the Sixth Form Arts class began with five students. In 1964, the Administration Block was built and dedicated appropriately to the \"Annunciation\" (for we have ''good news'' to tell). More buildings were put up to meet the school's expanding needs. In 1964, the Sixth Form Science stream was started. Past students will recall the butterfly collection with Sister Elizabeth (Mary Roch) and Sr. Philomena McGuinness, (Mary Iosagan), the delightful training in Music and Singing that left such a rich tradition, as well as the insightful Drama performance. There was also the planting of shrubs, shade trees, and general landscaping with Sr. Aideen. Today, the school has many more buildings, including a library complex.\n\n==Community Outreach==\n\nTo attend the shortage of missionary priests and nuns, the students formed a strong lay apostolate to go to the outlying compounds to teach Catechism, prepare candidates for Baptism, and visit lapsed Christians to re-awaken their faith. Students also got an opportunity to broaden their outlook by visiting neighbouring countries.\n\nIn the early 1970s the school began admitting boys into Sixth Form. This continued until the early 1980s when the program ended due to the problem of control. {{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Alliance==\nThe school maintains an ongoing alliance with the [[Opoku Ware Senior High School]], popularly called ''AkataSlopsa''.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Margaret Amoakohene]], academic and diplomat\n* [[Patricia Appiagyei]], politician\n* [[Lydia Forson]], actress, writer and producer\n* [[Yvonne Nduom]], business executive\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Catholicism|Africa|Schools}}\n* [[Education in Ghana]]\n* [[List of senior high schools in the Ashanti Region]]\n* [[Roman Catholicism in Ghana]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{URL|stlouisshs.edu.gh}}, the school's official website\n\n{{Ghana high schools|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{Coord|6.6950557|-1.545362|name=St. Louis Senior High School for Girls, Kumasi, Ghana}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Louis Senior High School}}\n[[Category:1952 establishments in Gold Coast (British colony)]]\n[[Category:Ashanti Region]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1952]]\n[[Category:Girls' schools in Ghana]]\n[[Category:High schools in Ghana]]\n[[Category:Public schools]]\n[[Category:Catholic secondary schools in Ghana]]\n", "text_old": "{{use dmy dates|date=June 2016}}\n{{infobox school\n|name              = St. Louis Senior High School (Kumasi, Ghana)\n|image             =\n|imagesize         = \n|caption           = \n|alt               =\n|location          = [[Oduom]], [[Ashanti Region]]\n|streetaddress     = P.

It was upon these commendations that the Ministry of Education, in 1960, wished the Sisters would open a Training College on the site on which St. Louis Secondary School now stands. That same year, 1960, a change-over took place, and St. Louis Secondary School moved to its present site. The foundation stone was laid by the late Otumfuo Osei Agyemang Prempeh II, Asantehene, on 25 March 1960 (the feast of Annunciation) and was blessed by Rt. Rev. Andrew van den Bronk (SMA), then Bishop of Kumasi.\n\nIn the same year, the Sixth Form Arts class began with five students. In 1964, the Administration Block was built and dedicated appropriately to the \"Annunciation\" (for we have ''good news'' to tell). More buildings were put up to meet the school's expanding needs. In 1964, the Sixth Form Science stream was started. Past students will recall the butterfly collection with Sister Elizabeth (Mary Roch) and Sr. Philomena McGuinness, (Mary Iosagan), the delightful training in Music and Singing that left such a rich tradition, as well as the insightful Drama performance. There was also the planting of shrubs, shade trees, and general landscaping with Sr. Aideen. Today, the school has many more buildings, including a library complex.\n\n==Community Outreach==\n\nTo attend the shortage of missionary priests and nuns, the students formed a strong lay apostolate to go to the outlying compounds to teach Catechism, prepare candidates for Baptism, and visit lapsed Christians to re-awaken their faith. Students also got an opportunity to broaden their outlook by visiting neighbouring countries.\n\nIn the early 1970s the school began admitting boys into Sixth Form. This continued until the early 1980s when the program ended due to the problem of control. {{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Alliance==\nThe school maintains an ongoing alliance with the [[Opoku Ware Senior High School]], popularly called ''AkataSlopsa''.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Margaret Amoakohene]], academic and diplomat\n* [[Patricia Appiagyei]], politician\n* [[Lydia Forson]], actress, writer and producer\n* [[Yvonne Nduom]], business executive\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Catholicism|Africa|Schools}}\n* [[Education in Ghana]]\n* [[List of senior high schools in the Ashanti Region]]\n* [[Roman Catholicism in Ghana]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{URL|stlouisshs.edu.gh}}, the school's official website\n\n{{Ghana high schools|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{Coord|6.6950557|-1.545362|name=St. Louis Senior High School for Girls, Kumasi, Ghana}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Louis Senior High School}}\n[[Category:1952 establishments in Gold Coast (British colony)]]\n[[Category:Ashanti Region]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1952]]\n[[Category:Girls' schools in Ghana]]\n[[Category:High schools in Ghana]]\n[[Category:Public schools]]\n[[Category:Catholic secondary schools in Ghana]]\n", "name_user": "154.160.19.181", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Senior_High_School"}

Within Cambodia, regional accents exist in remote areas but these are regarded as varieties of Central Khmer. Two exceptions are the speech of the capital, Phnom Penh, and that of the Khmer Khe in Stung Treng province, both of which differ sufficiently enough from Central Khmer to be considered separate dialects of Khmer. Outside of Cambodia, three distinct dialects are spoken by ethnic Khmers native to areas that were historically part of the [[Khmer Empire]]. The [[Northern Khmer dialect]] is spoken by over a million Khmers in the southern regions of [[Isan|Northeast Thailand]] and is treated by some linguists as a separate language. Khmer Krom, or Southern Khmer, is the first language of the [[Khmer Krom|Khmer of Vietnam]] while the Khmer living in the remote [[Cardamom mountains]] speak a very conservative dialect that still displays features of the [[Middle Khmer]] language.\n\nKhmer is primarily an [[analytic language|analytic]], [[isolating language]]. There are no [[inflection]]s, [[conjugation (grammar)|conjugations]] or [[grammatical case|case]] endings. Instead, [[Grammatical particle|particles]] and auxiliary words are used to indicate [[Grammar|grammatical]] relationships. General word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]], and [[modifier (grammar)|modifiers]] follow the word they modify. [[Classifier (linguistics)|Classifiers]] appear after numbers when used to count nouns, though not always so consistently as in languages like [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. In spoken Khmer, [[topic-comment]] structure is common and the perceived social relation between participants determines which sets of vocabulary, such as pronouns and honorifics, are proper.{{Contains special characters}}\n\nKhmer differs from neighboring languages such as Thai, [[Burmese language|Burmese]], Lao and Vietnamese in that it is not a [[tonal language]]. Words are [[stress (linguistics)|stressed]] on the final syllable, hence many words conform to the typical Mon\u2013Khmer pattern of a stressed syllable preceded by a [[minor syllable]]. The language has been written in the [[Khmer script]], an [[abugida]] descended from the [[Brahmi script]] via the southern Indian [[Pallava script]], since at least the seventh century. The script's form and use has evolved over the centuries; its modern features include subscripted versions of consonants used to write [[consonant cluster|clusters]] and a division of consonants into two series with different [[inherent vowel]]s. Approximately 79% of Cambodians are able to read Khmer.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hul|first1=Reaksmey|last2=Woods|first2=Ben|title=Campaign Aims to Boost Adult Literacy|url=https://www.cambodiadaily.com/archives/campaign-aims-to-boost-adult-literacy-78943/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=The Cambodia Daily|date=3 March 2015}}</ref>}}</ref>'''''\n\n==Classification==\n{{Main|Austroasiatic languages}}\n\nKhmer is a member of the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] language family, the autochthonous family in an area that stretches from the Malay Peninsula through Southeast Asia to East India.<ref name=DiffZide>Diffloth, Gerard & Zide, Norman.

After the fall of the Khmer Empire in the early 15th century, the Dongrek Mountains served as a natural border leaving the Khmer north of the mountains under the sphere of influence of the Kingdom of [[Lan Xang]]. The conquests of Cambodia by [[Naresuan]] the Great for [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] furthered their political and economic isolation from Cambodia proper, leading to a dialect that developed relatively independently from the midpoint of the Middle Khmer period.<ref name=\"Bernon\">{{cite journal|last1=Olivier|first1=Bernon de|editor1-last=Cholticha|editor1-first=Bamroongraks|editor2-last=Wilaiwan|editor2-first=Khanittanan|editor3-last=Laddawan|editor3-first=Permch|title=Khmer of Surin: Lexical Remarks|journal=The International Symposium on Language and Linguistics|date=1988|pages=258\u2013262|url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/bernon1988khmer.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2016|location=Bangkok, Thailand: Thammasat University}}</ref> This has resulted in a distinct accent influenced by the surrounding tonal languages [[Isan language|Lao]] and [[Thai language|Thai]], lexical differences, and phonemic differences in both vowels and distribution of consonants.

Although little studied, this variety is unique in that it maintains a definite system of [[Register (phonology)|vocal register]] that has all but disappeared in other dialects of modern Khmer.<ref name=\"DiffZide\" />\n\n'''Phnom Penh Khmer''' is spoken in the capital and surrounding areas. This dialect is characterized by merging or complete [[elision]] of syllables, which speakers from other regions consider a \"relaxed\" pronunciation. For instance, \"Phnom Penh\" is sometimes shortened to \"m'Penh\". Another characteristic of Phnom Penh speech is observed in words with an \"r\" either as an initial consonant or as the second member of a [[consonant cluster]] (as in the English word \"bread\"). The \"r\", [[Alveolar trill|trilled]] or [[Alveolar tap|flapped]] in other dialects, is either pronounced as a [[uvular trill]] or not pronounced at all. This alters the quality of any preceding consonant, causing a harder, more emphasized pronunciation. Another unique result is that the syllable is spoken with a low-rising or \"dipping\" [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] much like the \"h\u1ecfi\" tone in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].

Old Khmer (or Angkorian Khmer) is the language as it was spoken in the [[Khmer Empire]] from the 9th century until the weakening of the empire sometime in the 13th century. Old Khmer is attested by many primary sources and has been studied in depth by a few scholars, most notably [[Saveros Pou]], Phillip Jenner and Heinz-J\u00fcrgen Pinnow. Following the end of the Khmer Empire the language lost the standardizing influence of being the language of government and accordingly underwent a turbulent period of change in [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[phonology]] and [[lexicon]]. The language of this transition period, from about the 14th to 18th centuries, is referred to as Middle Khmer and saw borrowing from Thai, Lao and, to a lesser extent, Vietnamese. The changes during this period are so profound that the rules of Modern Khmer can not be applied to correctly understand Old Khmer. The language became recognizable as Modern Khmer, spoken from the 19th century till today.<ref name=\"Sak\" />\n\nThe following table shows the conventionally accepted historical stages of Khmer.<ref name=\"Sidwell2009\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Historical Stages of Khmer\n! c=01| Historical stage\n! c=02| Date\n|-\n| c=01| Pre- or [[Proto-Khmeric language|Proto-Khmer]]\n| c=02| Before 600 CE\n|-\n| c=01| Pre-Angkorian Old Khmer\n| c=02| 600\u2013800\n|-\n| c=01| Angkorian Old Khmer\n| c=02| 800 to mid-14th century\n|-\n| c=01| [[Middle Khmer]]\n| c=02| Mid-14th century to 18th century\n|-\n| c=01| Modern Khmer\n| c=02| 1800\u2013present\n|}\n\nJust as modern Khmer was emerging from the transitional period represented by Middle Khmer, Cambodia fell under the [[French protectorate of Cambodia|influence]] of [[France|French]] [[French colonial empire|colonialism]].<ref name=CBHP>{{cite book\n | last = Harris | first = Ian | title = Cambodian Buddhism: History and Practice | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | edition = | year = 2008 | location = Hawaii | pages =  | doi = | isbn = 978-0-8248-3298-8}}</ref>  Thailand, which had for centuries claimed suzerainty over Cambodia and controlled succession to the Cambodian throne, began losing its influence on the language.<ref name=\"Candler1\">{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=David P.|title=A history of Cambodia|date=1992|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0813309262|edition=2, illustrated|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofcambodi00chan}}</ref> In 1887 Cambodia was fully integrated into [[French Indochina]], which brought in a [[French language|French]]-speaking aristocracy.

When consonant voicing was lost, the distinction was maintained by the vowel ({{IPA|*kaa, *ke\u0324a}}); later the phonation disappeared as well ({{IPA|[ka\u02d0], [ki\u0259]}}).<ref name=ELL /> These processes explain the origin of what are now called a-series and o-series consonants in the [[Khmer script]].\n\nAlthough most Cambodian dialects are not [[tonal language|tonal]], the colloquial Phnom Penh dialect has developed a tonal contrast (level versus peaking tone) as a by-product of the [[elision]] of {{IPA|/r/}}.<ref name=ELL />\n\n===Intonation===\n[[Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation]] often conveys [[semantic]] context in Khmer, as in distinguishing [[declarative sentence|declarative statements]], questions and exclamations.

Syntactic relations are mainly determined by word order. Old and [[Middle Khmer]] used particles to mark [[grammatical categories]] and many of these have survived in Modern Khmer but are used sparingly, mostly in literary or formal language.<ref name=CamParts /> Khmer makes extensive use of [[auxiliary verbs]], \"directionals\" and [[serial verb construction]]. Colloquial Khmer is a [[zero copula]] language, instead preferring predicative adjectives (and even predicative nouns) unless using a copula for emphasis or to avoid ambiguity in more complex sentences. Basic word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] (SVO), although subjects are often [[Null-subject language|dropped]]; [[prepositions]] are used rather than postpositions.<ref>Huffman, Franklin. 1967. ''An outline of Cambodian Grammar''. PhD thesis, Cornell University.</ref> [[Topic-prominent language|Topic-Comment]] constructions are common and the language is generally [[head-initial]] (modifiers follow the words they modify). Some grammatical processes are still not fully understood by western scholars. For example, it is not clear if certain features of Khmer grammar, such as [[Agent (grammar)|actor nominalization]], should be treated as a morphological process or a purely syntactic device,<ref name=Haiman />{{rp|46, 74}} and some derivational morphology seems \"purely decorative\" and performs no known syntactic work.<ref name=Haiman />{{rp|53}}\n\n[[Lexical category|Lexical categories]] have been hard to define in Khmer.<ref name=Haiman>{{cite book|last1=Haiman|first1=John|title=Cambodian: Khmer (London Oriental and African Language Library, Book 16)|date=2011|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=978-9027238160|url=https://vk.com/doc12620867_132512378?hash=3e9bd161bfa4a9372d&dl=f1cfca7e3360435207|accessdate=27 January 2016}}</ref>{{rp|360}} [[Henri Maspero]], an early scholar of Khmer, claimed the language had no parts of speech,<ref name=Haiman /> while a later scholar, Judith Jacob, posited four parts of speech and innumerable particles.<ref name=Jacob68>{{cite book|last1=Jacob|first1=Judith|title=Introduction to Cambodian (School of Oriental and African Studies)|date=1968|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0197135563}}</ref>{{rp|331}} [[John Haiman]], on the other hand, identifies \"a couple dozen\" parts of speech in Khmer with the caveat that Khmer words have the freedom to perform a variety of syntactic functions depending on such factors as word order, relevant particles, location within a clause, intonation and context.<ref name=Haiman /> Some of the more important lexical categories and their function are demonstrated in the following example sentence taken from a hospital brochure:<ref name=Haiman />{{rp|378}}\n\n:{{interlinear| ipa1 = yes | italics = no | glossing = no abbr\n| /lo\u02d0k n\u0115\u0259\u0294 pd\u0251l c\u02b0i\u0259m t\u0115\u0259\u014b \u0294\u0251h  tr\u0259w tae t\u0254tu\u0259l n\u0259w ka\u02d0 pi\u02d0n\u0268t ri\u0259\u014b ka\u02d0j n\u0268\u014b pd\u0251l n\u0259w pr\u0251\u028b\u014f\u0259t sok\u02b0ap\u02b0i\u0259p ci\u0259 mun ci\u0259 s\u0259n/\n| PRONOUN PRONOUN VERB NOUN PARTICLE ADJECTIVE AUXILIARY&nbsp;VERB INTENSIFIER VERB OBJECT&nbsp;MARKER NOMINALIZER VERB NOUN NOUN CONJUNCTION VERB OBJECT&nbsp;MARKER NOUN ADJECTIVE COPULA ADVERB COPULA ADVERB\n| you[{{gcl|RESP|respectful}}] you[{{gcl|FAM|familiar}}] provide blood every all must have&nbsp;to receive {} {}  examine shape body and provide {} history health be before be first\n|'All blood donors must pass a physical examination and provide a health history first (before they can give blood).'}}\n\n===Morphology===\nModern Khmer is an [[isolating language]], which means that it uses little [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]].

The different registers, which include those used for common speech, polite speech, speaking to or about royals and speaking to or about monks, employ alternate verbs, names of body parts and pronouns. This results in what appears to foreigners as separate languages and, in fact, isolated villagers often are unsure how to speak with royals and royals raised completely within the court do not feel comfortable speaking the common register. As an example, the word for \"to eat\" used between intimates or in reference to animals is {{IPA|/si\u02d0/}}. Used in polite reference to commoners, it is {{IPA|/\u0272am/}}. When used of those of higher social status, it is {{IPA|/pisa/}} or {{IPA|/t\u0254tu\u0259l ti\u0259n/}}. For monks the word is {{IPA|/c\u02b0an/}} and for royals, {{IPA|/saoj/}}.<ref name =\"cl\" /> Another result is that the pronominal system is complex and full of honorific variations, just a few of which are shown in the table below.<ref name=KhDict />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Within Cambodia, regional accents exist in remote areas but these are regarded as varieties of Central Khmer. Two exceptions are the speech of the capital, Phnom Penh, and that of the Khmer Khe in Stung Treng province, both of which differ sufficiently enough from Central Khmer to be considered separate dialects of Khmer. Outside of Cambodia, three distinct dialects are spoken by ethnic Khmers native to areas that were historically part of the [[Khmer Empire]]. The [[Northern Khmer dialect]] is spoken by over a million Khmers in the southern regions of [[Isan|Northeast Thailand]] and is treated by some linguists as a separate language. Khmer Krom, or Southern Khmer, is the first language of the [[Khmer Krom|Khmer of Vietnam]] while the Khmer living in the remote [[Cardamom mountains]] speak a very conservative dialect that still displays features of the [[Middle Khmer]] language.\n\nKhmer is primarily an [[analytic language|analytic]], [[isolating language]]. There are no [[inflection]]s, [[conjugation (grammar)|conjugations]] or [[grammatical case|case]] endings. Instead, [[Grammatical particle|particles]] and auxiliary words are used to indicate [[Grammar|grammatical]] relationships. General word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]], and [[modifier (grammar)|modifiers]] follow the word they modify. [[Classifier (linguistics)|Classifiers]] appear after numbers when used to count nouns, though not always so consistently as in languages like [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. In spoken Khmer, [[topic-comment]] structure is common and the perceived social relation between participants determines which sets of vocabulary, such as pronouns and honorifics, are proper.{{Contains special characters}}\n\nKhmer differs from neighboring languages such as Thai, [[Burmese language|Burmese]], Lao and Vietnamese in that it is not a [[tonal language]]. Words are [[stress (linguistics)|stressed]] on the final syllable, hence many words conform to the typical Mon\u2013Khmer pattern of a stressed syllable preceded by a [[minor syllable]]. The language has been written in the [[Khmer script]], an [[abugida]] descended from the [[Brahmi script]] via the southern Indian [[Pallava script]], since at least the seventh century. The script's form and use has evolved over the centuries; its modern features include subscripted versions of consonants used to write [[consonant cluster|clusters]] and a division of consonants into two series with different [[inherent vowel]]s. Approximately 79% of Cambodians are able to read Khmer.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hul|first1=Reaksmey|last2=Woods|first2=Ben|title=Campaign Aims to Boost Adult Literacy|url=https://www.cambodiadaily.com/archives/campaign-aims-to-boost-adult-literacy-78943/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=The Cambodia Daily|date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n{{Main|Austroasiatic languages}}\n\nKhmer is a member of the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] language family, the autochthonous family in an area that stretches from the Malay Peninsula through Southeast Asia to East India.<ref name=DiffZide>Diffloth, Gerard & Zide, Norman.

This dialect is characterized by merging or complete [[elision]] of syllables, which speakers from other regions consider a \"relaxed\" pronunciation. For instance, \"Phnom Penh\" is sometimes shortened to \"m'Penh\". Another characteristic of Phnom Penh speech is observed in words with an \"r\" either as an initial consonant or as the second member of a [[consonant cluster]] (as in the English word \"bread\"). The \"r\", [[Alveolar trill|trilled]] or [[Alveolar tap|flapped]] in other dialects, is either pronounced as a [[uvular trill]] or not pronounced at all. This alters the quality of any preceding consonant, causing a harder, more emphasized pronunciation. Another unique result is that the syllable is spoken with a low-rising or \"dipping\" [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] much like the \"h\u1ecfi\" tone in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. For example, some people pronounce {{IPA|/tr\u0259j/}} ('fish') as {{IPA|[t\u0259j]}}: the {{IPA|/r/}} is dropped and the vowel begins by dipping much lower in tone than standard speech and then rises, effectively doubling its length. Another example is the word {{IPA|/ri\u0259n/}} ('study'), which is pronounced {{IPA|[\u0280i\u0259n]}}, with the uvular \"r\" and the same intonation described above.<ref>{{cite book|title=Linguistic Diversity and National Unity: Language Ecology in Thailand |author= William Allen A.

Old Khmer (or Angkorian Khmer) is the language as it was spoken in the [[Khmer Empire]] from the 9th century until the weakening of the empire sometime in the 13th century. Old Khmer is attested by many primary sources and has been studied in depth by a few scholars, most notably [[Saveros Pou]], Phillip Jenner and Heinz-J\u00fcrgen Pinnow. Following the end of the Khmer Empire the language lost the standardizing influence of being the language of government and accordingly underwent a turbulent period of change in [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[phonology]] and [[lexicon]]. The language of this transition period, from about the 14th to 18th centuries, is referred to as Middle Khmer and saw borrowing from Thai, Lao and, to a lesser extent, Vietnamese. The changes during this period are so profound that the rules of Modern Khmer can not be applied to correctly understand Old Khmer. The language became recognizable as Modern Khmer, spoken from the 19th century till today.<ref name=\"Sak\" />\n\nThe following table shows the conventionally accepted historical stages of Khmer.<ref name=\"Sidwell2009\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Historical Stages of Khmer\n! c=01| Historical stage\n! c=02| Date\n|-\n| c=01| Pre- or [[Proto-Khmeric language|Proto-Khmer]]\n| c=02| Before 600 CE\n|-\n| c=01| Pre-Angkorian Old Khmer\n| c=02| 600\u2013800\n|-\n| c=01| Angkorian Old Khmer\n| c=02| 800 to mid-14th century\n|-\n| c=01| [[Middle Khmer]]\n| c=02| Mid-14th century to 18th century\n|-\n| c=01| Modern Khmer\n| c=02| 1800\u2013present\n|}\n\nJust as modern Khmer was emerging from the transitional period represented by Middle Khmer, Cambodia fell under the [[French protectorate of Cambodia|influence]] of [[France|French]] [[French colonial empire|colonialism]].<ref name=CBHP>{{cite book\n | last = Harris | first = Ian | title = Cambodian Buddhism: History and Practice | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | edition = | year = 2008 | location = Hawaii | pages =  | doi = | isbn = 978-0-8248-3298-8}}</ref>  Thailand, which had for centuries claimed suzerainty over Cambodia and controlled succession to the Cambodian throne, began losing its influence on the language.<ref name=\"Candler1\">{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=David P.|title=A history of Cambodia|date=1992|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0813309262|edition=2, illustrated|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofcambodi00chan}}</ref> In 1887 Cambodia was fully integrated into [[French Indochina]], which brought in a [[French language|French]]-speaking aristocracy.

Syntactic relations are mainly determined by word order. Old and [[Middle Khmer]] used particles to mark [[grammatical categories]] and many of these have survived in Modern Khmer but are used sparingly, mostly in literary or formal language.<ref name=CamParts /> Khmer makes extensive use of [[auxiliary verbs]], \"directionals\" and [[serial verb construction]]. Colloquial Khmer is a [[zero copula]] language, instead preferring predicative adjectives (and even predicative nouns) unless using a copula for emphasis or to avoid ambiguity in more complex sentences. Basic word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] (SVO), although subjects are often [[Null-subject language|dropped]]; [[prepositions]] are used rather than postpositions.<ref>Huffman, Franklin. 1967. ''An outline of Cambodian Grammar''. PhD thesis, Cornell University.</ref> [[Topic-prominent language|Topic-Comment]] constructions are common and the language is generally [[head-initial]] (modifiers follow the words they modify). Some grammatical processes are still not fully understood by western scholars. For example, it is not clear if certain features of Khmer grammar, such as [[Agent (grammar)|actor nominalization]], should be treated as a morphological process or a purely syntactic device,<ref name=Haiman />{{rp|46, 74}} and some derivational morphology seems \"purely decorative\" and performs no known syntactic work.<ref name=Haiman />{{rp|53}}\n\n[[Lexical category|Lexical categories]] have been hard to define in Khmer.<ref name=Haiman>{{cite book|last1=Haiman|first1=John|title=Cambodian: Khmer (London Oriental and African Language Library, Book 16)|date=2011|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=978-9027238160|url=https://vk.com/doc12620867_132512378?hash=3e9bd161bfa4a9372d&dl=f1cfca7e3360435207|accessdate=27 January 2016}}</ref>{{rp|360}} [[Henri Maspero]], an early scholar of Khmer, claimed the language had no parts of speech,<ref name=Haiman /> while a later scholar, Judith Jacob, posited four parts of speech and innumerable particles.<ref name=Jacob68>{{cite book|last1=Jacob|first1=Judith|title=Introduction to Cambodian (School of Oriental and African Studies)|date=1968|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0197135563}}</ref>{{rp|331}} [[John Haiman]], on the other hand, identifies \"a couple dozen\" parts of speech in Khmer with the caveat that Khmer words have the freedom to perform a variety of syntactic functions depending on such factors as word order, relevant particles, location within a clause, intonation and context.<ref name=Haiman /> Some of the more important lexical categories and their function are demonstrated in the following example sentence taken from a hospital brochure:<ref name=Haiman />{{rp|378}}\n\n:{{interlinear| ipa1 = yes | italics = no | glossing = no abbr\n| /lo\u02d0k n\u0115\u0259\u0294 pd\u0251l c\u02b0i\u0259m t\u0115\u0259\u014b \u0294\u0251h  tr\u0259w tae t\u0254tu\u0259l n\u0259w ka\u02d0 pi\u02d0n\u0268t ri\u0259\u014b ka\u02d0j n\u0268\u014b pd\u0251l n\u0259w pr\u0251\u028b\u014f\u0259t sok\u02b0ap\u02b0i\u0259p ci\u0259 mun ci\u0259 s\u0259n/\n| PRONOUN PRONOUN VERB NOUN PARTICLE ADJECTIVE AUXILIARY&nbsp;VERB INTENSIFIER VERB OBJECT&nbsp;MARKER NOMINALIZER VERB NOUN NOUN CONJUNCTION VERB OBJECT&nbsp;MARKER NOUN ADJECTIVE COPULA ADVERB COPULA ADVERB\n| you[{{gcl|RESP|respectful}}] you[{{gcl|FAM|familiar}}] provide blood every all must have&nbsp;to receive {} {}  examine shape body and provide {} history health be before be first\n|'All blood donors must pass a physical examination and provide a health history first (before they can give blood).'}}\n\n===Morphology===\nModern Khmer is an [[isolating language]], which means that it uses little [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]].

The different registers, which include those used for common speech, polite speech, speaking to or about royals and speaking to or about monks, employ alternate verbs, names of body parts and pronouns. This results in what appears to foreigners as separate languages and, in fact, isolated villagers often are unsure how to speak with royals and royals raised completely within the court do not feel comfortable speaking the common register. As an example, the word for \"to eat\" used between intimates or in reference to animals is {{IPA|/si\u02d0/}}. Used in polite reference to commoners, it is {{IPA|/\u0272am/}}. When used of those of higher social status, it is {{IPA|/pisa/}} or {{IPA|/t\u0254tu\u0259l ti\u0259n/}}. For monks the word is {{IPA|/c\u02b0an/}} and for royals, {{IPA|/saoj/}}.<ref name =\"cl\" /> Another result is that the pronominal system is complex and full of honorific variations, just a few of which are shown in the table below.<ref name=KhDict />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

[[Hal Draper]] defined socialism from above as the philosophy which employs an [[elite]] [[Administration (government)|administration]] to run the [[socialist state]]. The other side of socialism is a more democratic [[socialism from below]].<ref name=\"Two Souls\">{{cite web|last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Two Souls of Socialism|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/twosouls/twosouls.htm|date=1963}}</ref> Draper viewed socialism from below as being the purer, more [[Marxist]] version of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]].<ref name=\"History\">{{cite book|last=Young|first=James D.|title=Socialism Since 1889: A Biographical History|date=1988|publisher=Barnes & Noble Books|location=Totowa|isbn=978-0-389-20813-6}}</ref> [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were devoutly opposed to any socialist institution that was \"conducive to superstitious authoritarianism\". Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently. In either case, this new ruling class is likely to see its goal as an Education Dictatorship over the masses \u2013 to Do Them Good, of course \u2013 the dictatorship being exercised by an elite party which suppresses all control from below, or by benevolent despots or Savior-Leaders of some kind, or by Shaw's \"Supermen,\" by eugenic manipulators, by Proudhon's \"anarchist\" managers or Saint-Simon's technocrats or their more modern equivalents \u2013 with up-to-date terms and new verbal screens which can be hailed as fresh social theory as against \"nineteenth-century Marxism.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/>}}\n\nThe idea of socialism from above is much more frequently discussed in elite circles than socialism from below\u2014even if that is the Marxist ideal\u2014because it is more practical.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n=== Utopian socialism ===\nThe first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent. [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] is regarded as the first individual to coin the term [[socialism]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h44-ph.html|title=Adam Smith|publisher=Macrohistory|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/socfrombel/sfb_2.htm|title=Birth of the Socialist Idea|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/> The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to progress.<ref>Newman, Michael (2005). ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.</ref> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nThe first major fictional work that proposed an authoritarian socialist state was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' which depicted a [[bureaucratic]] [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]]. Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century. He recognized and was acutely critical of the trends of socialism from above in collectivism, including theories that were based in voluntary cooperation.<ref name=\"Ebenstein\">{{cite book|last=Ebenstein|first=Alan|author-link=Alan O.

''Economic Devolution in Eastern Europe''. New York: Praeger.</ref> The central planning authority is responsible for five specific tasks:\n# Determining the criteria for the economic calculations of the planning decisions.\n# Determining and quantifying targets to be achieved within the a specified period.\n# Coordinating targets to ensure the plan is consistent and reliable.\n# Determining the methods to ensure the realization of the plan.\n# Revising targets in accordance to changing economic calculations.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/>\n\nThe planning process involved the creation of one-year plans, five-year plans and long-term plans. The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations. The long-term plans encompassed a global strategy development. This plan was about goals for the state and society, not about individual responsibilities. Structural changes were a main theme.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/><ref>Sejna, Jan (1986). ''Decision-Making in Communist Countries: An Inside View''.

It has been argued that authoritarian socialist states failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of [[state enterprise]]s in their administrative, command allocation of [[resources]] and [[commodities]] and the lack of [[democracy]] in the political systems that the authoritarian socialist economies were combined with. A form of competitive socialism that rejects [[dictatorship]] and authoritarian allocation of resources in favor of [[economic democracy]] could work and prove superior to the [[market economy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First|last1=Gregory|first1=Paul|last2=Stuart|first2=Robert|publisher=South-Western College Pub|year=2003|isbn=0-618-26181-8|page=152}}</ref> Others have argued that a central deficiency of such economic planning was that it was not premised on final consumer demand, but that such a system would be increasingly feasible with advances in information technology.<ref>Mandel, Ernest (Sepetember 1986).

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals.

There were countries that chose to introduce the new economic system gradually ([[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[East Germany]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) and countries that decided to first prepare theoretically, then experimentation at different levels and then in a large scale ([[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]). [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods. There was also less bureaucracy than in the Soviet Union involved in the planning of the countries.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc countries achieved high rates of economic and technical progress, promoted industrialization and ensured steady growth rates of labor productivity and rises in the standard of living<ref>Shiryayev, Y.; Sokolov, A.

Countries such as China that did not isolate and instead reformed themselves thrived, but this did not happen in most Eastern Bloc countries as they depended upon the Soviet Union, especially for significant amounts of materials.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> From the end of the World War II to the mid-1970s, the economy of the Eastern Bloc steadily increased at the same rate as the economy in Western Europe, with the least none-reforming [[Stalinist]] nations of the Eastern Bloc having a stronger economy then the reformist-Stalinist states.<ref>Teichova, Alice; Matis, Herbert (2003).

Growth did not begin to return to pre-reform-era levels for approximately fifteen years.

''Alternative Economic Models of Transition''. Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971).

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Systematic economic challenges ===\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998). ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

[https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1931/02/04.htm \"The Tasks of Business Executives\"].</ref> Acknowledging this inadequacy, Stalin ordered that resources slotted for consumption be redirected to production or exported as a temporary sacrifice on the part of the population for the sake of rapid growth.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> The model was successful initially, with ideology and nationalism promoting morale despite shortages in resources such as food and construction materials for housing. Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era. The Soviet attempt to [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivize agriculture]], transforming the Soviet Union from one of the world's largest exporters of grain to the world's largest importer of grain, was widely replicated despite its failure.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Many historians claim that extermination was the fate of a wide variety of people during Stalin's regime such as political opponents, ideological rivals, suspect party members, accused military officers, kulaks, lower-class families, former members of the societal elites, ethnic groups, religious groups and the relatives and sympathizers of these offenders.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/><ref name=\"The Case\"/><ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> These deaths occurred as a result of collectivization, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag. As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\" />\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment. In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Joining the peasant class with the [[bourgeoisie]] of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, urban landowners through the banner of [[communism]]. Only when this collection of [[peasant]]s and [[petty bourgeoisie]] existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people were the ones who could control the state, but his government's intense control over the citizenry emphasizes the contradiction in his theory\u2014a contradiction, he maintained, was a necessary reality of their specialized system <ref name=\"Esh\"/>\n\n=== Arab world ===\n{{see also|Arab socialism}}\nSocialism was introduced into the Middle East in the form of [[Populism|populist]] policies designed to galvanize the [[working class]] into overthrowing [[colonial powers]] and their domestic allies. These policies were held by authoritarian states interested in the rapid industrialization and social equalization of Arab nations and often were characterized by redistributive or protectionist economic policies, lower class mobilization, charismatic leaders and promises to improve national living standards.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen J.|title=The New Authoritarianism in The Middle East and North Africa|date=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington}}</ref> Those states were progressive in terms of the colonial development that had occurred thus far. They allowed important political and economic gains to be made by workers, encouraged land redistribution, unseated oligarchical political powers and implemented [[Import substitution industrialization|import-substituting]] industrialization development strategies.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\nWith the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] following the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991 as well as the push for [[democratization]], many Arab states have moved toward a model of fiscal discipline proposed by the [[Washington Consensus]].<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Although authoritarian leaders of those states implemented democratic institutions during the 1980s and 1990s, their multi-party elections created an arena in which business elites could lobby for personal interests while largely silencing the lower class.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Economic liberalization in these regions yielded economies that led to regimes built on the support of rent-seeking urban elites, with political opposition inviting the prospect of political marginalization and even retaliation.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\n==== Resistance to democratization ====\n[[File:WOSM-WAGGGS-Arab Region.svg|thumb|[[Arab world]]]]\nA great deal of debate has been paid by the field of comparative politics to how the Arab region was able to avoid the [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave of democratization]].

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness. [...] But the government cannot and must not do it all. It must be helped by the party. [...] Our party must be the consciousness of the masses\".<ref name=\"Gregor\"/>\n\n==== Ghana ====\nIn the same vein as Senghor, socialist leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]] sought to advance this one-party, nationalized form of socialist obedience. Nkrumah stressed the importance of government-owned property and resources.

However, elite landowners questioned the legitimacy of Nkrumah's power. Those elites were only afforded one choice, namely to align with their government if they wanted access to the state. Gradually, those who were not granted or did not desire entrance into the party created regions blocs.<ref name=\"Redl\">{{cite book|last=Riedl|first=Rachel|title=Authoritarian Origins of Democratic Party Systems in Africa|date=February 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=108}}</ref> The [[Ashanti people|Asante]] emerged as a regional force capable political sway.

In the system, all Tanzanains were encouraged to run for office, with no campaign funding allowed. Speeches in the election would not focus on the national issues, but rather on the quality of the individual, each of whom would be closely controlled by TANU.<ref name=\"Pratt\"/> Structurally, the power was shared along regional boundaries, giving increased policy making power and resource allocation to these regions.

The other side of socialism is a more democratic [[socialism from below]].<ref name=\"Two Souls\">{{cite web|last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Two Souls of Socialism|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/twosouls/twosouls.htm|date=1963}}</ref> Draper viewed socialism from below as being the purer, more [[Marxist]] version of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]].<ref name=\"History\">{{cite book|last=Young|first=James D.|title=Socialism Since 1889: A Biographical History|date=1988|publisher=Barnes & Noble Books|location=Totowa|isbn=978-0-389-20813-6}}</ref> [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were devoutly opposed to any socialist institution that was \"conducive to superstitious authoritarianism\". Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently.

Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century.

In reply, Hayek warned against confusing \"totalitarianism with authoritarianism\" and said that he was unaware of \"any totalitarian governments in Latin America.

The party's decisions are so integrated into public life that its economic and non-economic decisions are part of their overall actions.\n* State ownership of the means of production in which natural resources and capital belong to society.\n* Central economic planning, the main characteristic of an authoritarian, state socialist economy. The market is planned by a central government agency, generally a state planning commission.\n* Socially-equitable distribution of the national income in which goods and services are provided for free by the state that supplement private consumption.\n\nThis economic model is greatly characterized by the government's central planning.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\">Wilczynski, J.

''Economic Devolution in Eastern Europe''.

The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations. The long-term plans encompassed a global strategy development. This plan was about goals for the state and society, not about individual responsibilities.

It has been argued that authoritarian socialist states failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of [[state enterprise]]s in their administrative, command allocation of [[resources]] and [[commodities]] and the lack of [[democracy]] in the political systems that the authoritarian socialist economies were combined with. A form of competitive socialism that rejects [[dictatorship]] and authoritarian allocation of resources in favor of [[economic democracy]] could work and prove superior to the [[market economy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First|last1=Gregory|first1=Paul|last2=Stuart|first2=Robert|publisher=South-Western College Pub|year=2003|isbn=0-618-26181-8|page=152}}</ref> Others have argued that a central deficiency of such economic planning was that it was not premised on final consumer demand, but that such a system would be increasingly feasible with advances in information technology.<ref>Mandel, Ernest (Sepetember 1986).

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals.

[[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland.

Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods.

''Alternative Economic Models of Transition''. Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971).

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Systematic economic challenges ===\n{{see also|Soviet-type economic planning}}\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998). ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era. The Soviet attempt to [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivize agriculture]], transforming the Soviet Union from one of the world's largest exporters of grain to the world's largest importer of grain, was widely replicated despite its failure.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Many historians claim that extermination was the fate of a wide variety of people during Stalin's regime such as political opponents, ideological rivals, suspect party members, accused military officers, kulaks, lower-class families, former members of the societal elites, ethnic groups, religious groups and the relatives and sympathizers of these offenders.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/><ref name=\"The Case\"/><ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> These deaths occurred as a result of collectivization, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag.

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n==== Maoism ====\n[[Maoism]] is an adapted Sino-centric version of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]].<ref name=\"Esh\">{{cite journal|last=Esherick|first=Joseph W.|title=On the \"Restoration of Capitalism\": Mao and Marxist Theory|journal=Modern China|date=January 1979|volume=5|issue=1|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1177/009770047900500102}}</ref> While believing in [[democratic centralism]], where party decisions are brought about by scrutiny and debate and then are binding upon all members of the party once implemented, Mao did not accept dissenters to the party's decisions.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> Through the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], Mao attempted to purge any subversive idea\u2014especially capitalist or Western threat\u2014with heavy force, justifying his actions as the necessary way for the central authority to keep power.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Mao emphasized the importance of cultural heritage and individual choice as a way of creating this national unity. He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\" />\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment. In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Joining the peasant class with the [[bourgeoisie]] of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, urban landowners through the banner of [[communism]]. Only when this collection of [[peasant]]s and [[petty bourgeoisie]] existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people were the ones who could control the state, but his government's intense control over the citizenry emphasizes the contradiction in his theory\u2014a contradiction, he maintained, was a necessary reality of their specialized system <ref name=\"Esh\"/>\n\n=== Arab world ===\n{{see also|Arab socialism}}\nSocialism was introduced into the Middle East in the form of [[Populism|populist]] policies designed to galvanize the [[working class]] into overthrowing [[colonial powers]] and their domestic allies. These policies were held by authoritarian states interested in the rapid industrialization and social equalization of Arab nations and often were characterized by redistributive or protectionist economic policies, lower class mobilization, charismatic leaders and promises to improve national living standards.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen J.|title=The New Authoritarianism in The Middle East and North Africa|date=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington}}</ref> Those states were progressive in terms of the colonial development that had occurred thus far.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness. [...] But the government cannot and must not do it all. It must be helped by the party. [...] Our party must be the consciousness of the masses\".<ref name=\"Gregor\"/>\n\n==== Ghana ====\nIn the same vein as Senghor, socialist leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]] sought to advance this one-party, nationalized form of socialist obedience.

However, elite landowners questioned the legitimacy of Nkrumah's power. Those elites were only afforded one choice, namely to align with their government if they wanted access to the state. Gradually, those who were not granted or did not desire entrance into the party created regions blocs.<ref name=\"Redl\">{{cite book|last=Riedl|first=Rachel|title=Authoritarian Origins of Democratic Party Systems in Africa|date=February 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=108}}</ref> The [[Ashanti people|Asante]] emerged as a regional force capable political sway.

In the system, all Tanzanains were encouraged to run for office, with no campaign funding allowed. Speeches in the election would not focus on the national issues, but rather on the quality of the individual, each of whom would be closely controlled by TANU.<ref name=\"Pratt\"/> Structurally, the power was shared along regional boundaries, giving increased policy making power and resource allocation to these regions.

Her father placed her in charge of a large hospital and orphanage that he built for her to administer in [[Constantinople]]. The hospital was said to hold beds for 10,000 patients and orphans.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Anna taught medicine at the hospital, as well as at other hospitals and orphanages.

He therefore turned the civil government over to his wife, Irene; she in turn directed the administration to Bryennios.<ref>Hill 2000, p. 46.</ref> Choniates states that, as Emperor Alexios lay dying in his imperial bedchamber, John arrived and \"secretly\" took the emperor\u2019s ring from his father during an embrace \"as though in mourning.\"<ref>Choniates 1984, p. 6.</ref> Anna also worked in her husband's favor during her father's illness.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} In 1118, Alexios I Komnenos died.<ref>Smythe 2006, p. 127.</ref>  A cleric acclaimed John emperor in Hagia Sophia.<ref name=\"Hill 2000, p. 47\">Hill 2000, p. 47.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Dion C.

She held esteemed intellectual gatherings, including those dedicated to [[Aristotle|Aristotelian studies]].<ref>Browning 1990, pp. 397\u2013399.</ref> Anna's intellectual genius and breadth of knowledge is evident in her few works. Among other things, she was conversant with philosophy, literature, grammar, theology, astronomy, and medicine. It can be assumed because of minor errors that she may have quoted [[Homer]] and the [[Bible]] from memory when writing her most celebrated work, the ''Alexiad''.  Her contemporaries, like the metropolitan Bishop of Ephesus, Georgios Tornikes, regarded Anna as a person who had reached \"the highest summit of wisdom, both secular and divine.\"\n\n=== The ''Alexiad'' ===\nAnna wrote the ''Alexiad'' in the mid-1140s or 1150s.<ref>Neville 2016, p. 5.</ref> Anna cited her husband's unfinished work as the reason why she began the ''Alexiad''.<ref name=\":11\">Komnene 2009.

I based the truth of my history on them by examining their narratives and comparing them with what I had written, and what they told me with what I had often heard, from my father in particular and from my uncles \u2026 From all these materials the whole fabric of my history \u2013 my true history \u2013 has been woven.\u201d<ref>Komnene 2009. Book XIV, section 7, p. 422.</ref> Beyond just eyewitness accounts from veterans or her male family members, scholars have also noted that Anna used the imperial archives, which allowed her access to official documents.<ref>Neville 2016, p. 78.</ref> \n\nIn the ''Alexiad'', Anna provided insight on political relations and wars between Alexios I and the West. She vividly described weaponry, tactics, and battles. It has been noted that she was writing about events that occurred when she was a child, so these are not [[witness|eye-witness account]]s. Her neutrality is compromised by the fact that she was writing to praise her father and denigrate his successors. Despite her unabashed partiality, her account of the [[First Crusade]] is of great value to history because it is the only [[Byzantine]] eyewitness account available. She had the opportunity to gather information from key figures in the Byzantine elite; her husband, Nikephorus Bryennios, had fought in the clash with crusade leader [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] outside [[Constantinople]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] 1097; and her uncle, [[George Palaeologus]], was present at Pelekanon in June 1097 when [[Alexios I]] discussed future strategy with the crusaders. Thus, the ''Alexiad'' allows the events of the [[First Crusade]] to be seen from the Byzantine elite's perspective. It conveys the alarm felt at the scale of the western European forces proceeding through the Empire, and the dangers they might have posed to the safety of [[Constantinople]]. Anna also identified for the first time, the Vlachs from Balkans with Dacians, in Alexiad (Chapter XIV), describing their places around Haemus mountains: \"...on either side of its slopes dwell many very wealthy tribes, the Dacians and the Thracians on the northern side, and on the southern, more Thracians and the Macedonians\". Special suspicion was reserved for crusading leader [[Bohemond of Taranto]], a southern Italian Norman who, under the leadership of his father [[Robert Guiscard]], had invaded Byzantine territory in the [[Balkans]] in 1081.\n\nThe ''Alexiad'' was written in Attic Greek,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anna Comnena|last=Dalven|first=Rae|publisher=Twayne Publishers, Inc.|year=1972|isbn=|location=New York|pages=155}}</ref> and the [[literary style]] is fashioned after [[Thucydides]], [[Polybius]], and [[Xenophon]].{{sfnp|EB|1911}} Consequently, it exhibits a struggle for an [[Atticism]] characteristic of the period, whereby the resulting language is highly artificial.{{sfnp|EB|1911}} Peter Frankopan argues that the lapses in some of the chronology of events can in part be attributed to errors in, or lack of, source material for those events.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gendering the Crusades|last=Frankopan|first=Peter|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2002|isbn=|editor-last=Edgington|editor-first=Susan B.|location=New York|pages=63|chapter=Perception and Projection of Prejudice: Anna Comnena, the Alexiad, and the First Crusade|editor-last2=Lambert|editor-first2=Sarah}}</ref> Anna herself also addressed these lapses, explaining them as a result of memory loss and old age.<ref>Komnene 2009, Book V, section 9, p. 151.</ref> But regardless of errors in chronology, her history meets the standards of her time.<ref>''Catholic Encyclopedia''</ref>\n\nMoreover, the ''Alexiad'' sheds light on Anna\u2019s emotional turmoil, including her grief over the deaths of her father, mother, and husband, among other things. At the end of the ''Alexiad'', Anna wrote \"But living I died a thousand deaths \u2026 Yet I am more grief-stricken than [Niobe]: after my misfortunes, great and terrible as they are, I am still alive \u2013 to experience yet more \u2026 Let this be the end of my history, then, lest as I write of these sad events I become even more resentful.\"<ref>Komnene 2009, Book XV, section 11, pp. 472\u2013473.</ref>\n\n==Depictions in fiction and other media==\n*Anna Komnene plays a [[Secondary character|secondary role]] in [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]]\u2019s 1832 novel ''[[Count Robert of Paris]]''.\n*Fictional accounts of her life are given in the 1928 novel ''Anna Comnena'' by [[Naomi Mitchison]], and the 1999 novel for young people ''[[Anna of Byzantium (novel)|Anna of Byzantium]]'' by [[Tracy Barrett]].\n*She appears prominently in the first volume of the trilogy ''The Crusaders'' by the Polish novelist [[Zofia Kossak-Szczucka]], written in 1935.\n* A novel written in 2008 by the Albanian writer [[Ben Blushi]] called ''Living on an Island'' also mentions her.\n* The novel ''\u0410\u0437, \u0410\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0430'' (''Az, Anna Komnina'', in English: ''I, Anna Comnena'') was written by [[Vera Mutafchieva]], a Bulgarian writer and historian.<ref>[http://veramutafchieva.net/bibliography_bg.php (Retrieved August 2010)]</ref>\n*She is also a minor character in Nan Hawthorne's novel of the [[Crusade of 1101]], ''Beloved Pilgrim'' (2011).\n* Anna appears in ''[[Medieval 2: Total War]]'' video game campaigns as a Byzantine princess diplomat, under the name Anna Comnenus.\n* In [[Julia Kristeva]]'s 2006 murder mystery ''Murder in Byzantium'', Anna Komnene is the focus of the villain's scholarly and amorous fantasy of the past.

Among other things, she was conversant with philosophy, literature, grammar, theology, astronomy, and medicine. It can be assumed because of minor errors that she may have quoted [[Homer]] and the [[Bible]] from memory when writing her most celebrated work, the ''Alexiad''.

Book XIV, section 7, p. 422.</ref> Beyond just eyewitness accounts from veterans or her male family members, scholars have also noted that Anna used the imperial archives, which allowed her access to official documents.<ref>Neville 2016, p. 78.</ref> \n\nIn the ''Alexiad'', Anna provided insight on political relations and wars between Alexios I and the West. She vividly described weaponry, tactics, and battles. It has been noted that she was writing about events that occurred when she was a child, so these are not [[witness|eye-witness account]]s. Her neutrality is compromised by the fact that she was writing to praise her father and denigrate his successors. Despite her unabashed partiality, her account of the [[First Crusade]] is of great value to history because it is the only [[Byzantine]] eyewitness account available. She had the opportunity to gather information from key figures in the Byzantine elite; her husband, Nikephorus Bryennios, had fought in the clash with crusade leader [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] outside [[Constantinople]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] 1097; and her uncle, [[George Palaeologus]], was present at Pelekanon in June 1097 when [[Alexios I]] discussed future strategy with the crusaders. Thus, the ''Alexiad'' allows the events of the [[First Crusade]] to be seen from the Byzantine elite's perspective. It conveys the alarm felt at the scale of the western European forces proceeding through the Empire, and the dangers they might have posed to the safety of [[Constantinople]]. Anna also identified for the first time, the Vlachs from Balkans with Dacians, in Alexiad (Chapter XIV), describing their places around Haemus mountains: \"...on either side of its slopes dwell many very wealthy tribes, the Dacians and the Thracians on the northern side, and on the southern, more Thracians and the Macedonians\". Special suspicion was reserved for crusading leader [[Bohemond of Taranto]], a southern Italian Norman who, under the leadership of his father [[Robert Guiscard]], had invaded Byzantine territory in the [[Balkans]] in 1081.\n\nThe ''Alexiad'' was written in Attic Greek,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anna Comnena|last=Dalven|first=Rae|publisher=Twayne Publishers, Inc.|year=1972|isbn=|location=New York|pages=155}}</ref> and the [[literary style]] is fashioned after [[Thucydides]], [[Polybius]], and [[Xenophon]].{{sfnp|EB|1911}} Consequently, it exhibits a struggle for an [[Atticism]] characteristic of the period, whereby the resulting language is highly artificial.{{sfnp|EB|1911}} Peter Frankopan argues that the lapses in some of the chronology of events can in part be attributed to errors in, or lack of, source material for those events.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gendering the Crusades|last=Frankopan|first=Peter|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2002|isbn=|editor-last=Edgington|editor-first=Susan B.|location=New York|pages=63|chapter=Perception and Projection of Prejudice: Anna Comnena, the Alexiad, and the First Crusade|editor-last2=Lambert|editor-first2=Sarah}}</ref> Anna herself also addressed these lapses, explaining them as a result of memory loss and old age.<ref>Komnene 2009, Book V, section 9, p. 151.</ref> But regardless of errors in chronology, her history meets the standards of her time.<ref>''Catholic Encyclopedia''</ref>\n\nMoreover, the ''Alexiad'' sheds light on Anna\u2019s emotional turmoil, including her grief over the deaths of her father, mother, and husband, among other things. At the end of the ''Alexiad'', Anna wrote \"But living I died a thousand deaths \u2026 Yet I am more grief-stricken than [Niobe]: after my misfortunes, great and terrible as they are, I am still alive \u2013 to experience yet more \u2026 Let this be the end of my history, then, lest as I write of these sad events I become even more resentful.\"<ref>Komnene 2009, Book XV, section 11, pp. 472\u2013473.</ref>\n\n==Depictions in fiction and other media==\n*Anna Komnene plays a [[Secondary character|secondary role]] in [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]]\u2019s 1832 novel ''[[Count Robert of Paris]]''.\n*Fictional accounts of her life are given in the 1928 novel ''Anna Comnena'' by [[Naomi Mitchison]], and the 1999 novel for young people ''[[Anna of Byzantium (novel)|Anna of Byzantium]]'' by [[Tracy Barrett]].\n*She appears prominently in the first volume of the trilogy ''The Crusaders'' by the Polish novelist [[Zofia Kossak-Szczucka]], written in 1935.\n* A novel written in 2008 by the Albanian writer [[Ben Blushi]] called ''Living on an Island'' also mentions her.\n* The novel ''\u0410\u0437, \u0410\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0430'' (''Az, Anna Komnina'', in English: ''I, Anna Comnena'') was written by [[Vera Mutafchieva]], a Bulgarian writer and historian.<ref>[http://veramutafchieva.net/bibliography_bg.php (Retrieved August 2010)]</ref>\n*She is also a minor character in Nan Hawthorne's novel of the [[Crusade of 1101]], ''Beloved Pilgrim'' (2011).\n* Anna appears in ''[[Medieval 2: Total War]]'' video game campaigns as a Byzantine princess diplomat, under the name Anna Comnenus.\n* In [[Julia Kristeva]]'s 2006 murder mystery ''Murder in Byzantium'', Anna Komnene is the focus of the villain's scholarly and amorous fantasy of the past.
