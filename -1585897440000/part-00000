The class uses [[passive electronically scanned array|passive phased-array radar]] and was originally planned as a class of [[destroyer]]s. However, the increased combat capability offered by the [[Aegis Combat System]] and the [[AN/SPY-1]] radar system, together with the capability of operating as a [[flagship]], were used to justify the change of the classification from DDG ([[guided missile destroyer]]) to CG ([[guided-missile cruiser]]) shortly before the keels were laid down for {{USS|Ticonderoga|CG-47|2}} and {{USS|Yorktown|CG-48|2}}.\n\n''Ticonderoga''-class guided-missile cruisers are multi-role warships. Their [[Mark 41 Vertical Launching System|Mk 41 VLS]] can launch [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk cruise missiles]] to strike strategic or tactical targets, or fire long-range [[antiaircraft]] [[RIM-66 Standard|Standard Missiles]] for defense against aircraft or [[anti-ship missile]]s. Their [[Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System|LAMPS III]] [[helicopter]]s and [[sonar]] systems allow them to perform [[anti-submarine warfare|antisubmarine]] missions. ''Ticonderoga''-class ships are designed to be elements of [[carrier battle groups]] or amphibious ready groups, as well as performing missions such as interdiction or escort.<ref name=\"fas\">{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/cg-47.htm |title=CG-47 Ticonderoga (class) |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |accessdate=26 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507191652/http://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/cg-47.htm |archive-date=7 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> With upgrades to their AN/SPY-1 phased radar systems and their associated missile payloads as part of the [[Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System]], members of this class have, in successive tests, repeatedly demonstrated their proficiency as mobile [[anti-ballistic missile]] and [[anti-satellite weapon|anti-satellite]] weaponry platforms.\n\nOf the 27 completed vessels, 19 were built by [[Ingalls Shipbuilding]] and eight by [[Bath Iron Works]] (BIW). All but one ({{USS|Thomas S. Gates|CG-51|2}}) of the ships in the class are named for noteworthy events in U.S. military history, and at least twelve share their names with [[World War II]]-era aircraft carriers. As of 2020, 22 ships are still active and expected to serve for 35 years since commissioning.\n\n==History==\nThe ''Ticonderoga''-class was originally ordered as guided missile destroyers, with the designation DDG-47. These ships were intended to be lower cost platforms for the new Aegis combat system by mounting the system on a hull based on that of the {{sclass-|Spruance|destroyer|1}}. They would complement the much larger and more capable ''[[Strike Cruiser]]'' (CSGN) design. With the cancellation of the ''Strike Cruiser'' as well as the scaled down CGN-42 (''Virginia''-class cruiser hull) alternative, some of the requirements were transferred to the DDG-47, and the class was eventually re-designated as guided missile cruisers, CG-47, to reflect the additional flagship capabilities.<ref>{{cite book|title=U.S. CRUISERS An Illustrated Design History |first=Norman |last=Friedman |publisher=Naval Institute Press |place=Annapolis, Maryland |date=1984 |pages=419\u2013422}}</ref> Ships of the class from CG-52 onwards were equipped with the Mk. 41 vertical launch system.\n\nAs the Aegis combat system and the additional cruiser roles added substantial weight to the ''Spruance''-derived hull, the design had limited growth potential in terms of weight and power margin. In the 1980s, a design study known as ''[[Cruiser Baseline]]'' (CGBL) was created to accommodate the capabilities of CG-52 (Mk. 41-equipped ships of the ''Ticonderoga'' class) on a hull with design and construction techniques matching the DDG-51 ({{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|1}}) for improved survivability and weight allowances.\n\n===Possible early retirement===\nDue to [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] requirements to cut the [[Defense Budget]] for FY2013 and subsequent years, plans were being considered to decommission some of the ''Ticonderoga''-class cruisers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navytimes.com/news/2012/01/defense-navy-avoids-most-pentagon-cuts-012612w/ |work=Navy Times |title=Navy avoids most of Pentagon's latest cuts |last=Cavas |first=Christopher P. |date=26 January 2012 |accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> For the U.S. Defense 2013 Budget Proposal, the U.S. Navy was to decommission seven cruisers early in fiscal years 2013 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navytimes.com/news/2012/02/navy-budget-request-avoids-deep-cuts-021312/ |title=Navy budget request avoids deep cuts |work=Navy Times |date=13 February 2012 |last=Fellman |first=Sam |accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nBecause of these retirements, the U.S. Navy was expected to fall short of its requirement for 94 missile defense [[cruiser]]s and [[destroyer]]s beginning in FY 2025 and continuing past the end of the 30-year planning period. While this is a new requirement as of 2011, and the [[U.S. Navy]] has historically never had so many large missile-armed surface combatants, the relative success of the AEGIS ballistic missile defense system has shifted this national security requirement onto the U.S. Navy.<ref>O'Rourke, Ronald.

This wouldn't technically be an \"early retirement\", as the ships would be at their originally planned 35-year life dates, but they would be able to serve longer with the upgrades.

When they were designed, they had the most powerful [[electronic warfare]] equipment in the U.S. Navy, as well as the most advanced underwater surveillance system. These ships were one of the first classes of [[warship]]s to be built in modules, rather than being assembled from the bottom up.<ref name=\"fas\" />\n\nThe greater size and equipment on the CG-47\u2013class warships increased displacement from 6,900 tons of the DD-963\u2013class destroyers to 9,600 tons of displacement for the heavier cruisers. Aegis cruisers can steam in any ocean and conduct multi-warfare operations anywhere. Some cruisers reported some structural problems in early service after extended periods in extremely heavy seas; they were generally corrected from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. Several ships had superstructure cracks, which were repaired.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nThese ships' superstructures were a modification of that on the ''Spruance''-class destroyers and were required to support two deck-houses (one forward for antennas forward and starboard), and the aft deck-house housed the aft and port antenna arrays. The later ''Arleigh Burke''-class Aegis destroyers are designed from the keel up to carry the SPY-1D radars and have them all clustered together on the forward deck-house, saving space and weight and simplifying cooling requirements. Radar support equipment is closer together, minimizing cable runs and concentrating support equipment.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n[[File:Bow view of USS Spruance (DD-963) and USS Ticonderoga (CG-47) at Naval Station Norfolk on 8 October 1983 (6397938).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Ticonderoga''\u2013class cruisers were built on the same hull as the {{sclass-|Spruance|destroyer|1}}.]]\n\n[[Operations research]] was used to study manpower requirements on the ''Ticonderoga'' class.

The Aegis Cruisers are \"double-enders\", and along with the ''Zumwalt''-class, are the only surface combatants in the fleet that can employ two large caliber guns simultaneously.\n\n===Vertical Launching System===\n{{See also|Vertical Launching System}}\n[[File:US Navy 031109-N-9769P-076 Guided missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain (CG 57) steams in the Southern California operating area.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An overhead view of the ''Ticonderoga'' class {{USS|Lake Champlain|CG-57|2}}, with VLS visible fore and aft as the gray boxes near the bow and stern of the ship.]]\n[[File:USS Ticonderoga (CG-47) underway off Puerto Rico on 9 April 1983 (6379851).jpg|thumb|left|upright|The older {{USS|Ticonderoga|CG-47|2}} with the pre-VLS twin-arm launchers visible fore and aft.]]\n\nIn addition to the added [[radar]] capability, the ''Ticonderoga''-class ships built after USS ''Thomas S. Gates'' included two Mark 41 [[Vertical Launching System]]s (VLS). The two VLS allow the ship to have 122 missile storage and launching tubes that can carry a wide variety of missiles, including the [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk]] [[cruise missile]], [[RIM-66 Standard|Standard]] [[surface-to-air missile]], [[RIM-162 ESSM|Evolved Sea Sparrow]] [[surface-to-air missile]], and [[ASROC]] [[antisubmarine warfare]] (ASW) guided rockets. More importantly, the VLS enables all missiles to be on full standby at any given time, shortening the warship's response time before firing. The original five ships (''Ticonderoga'', ''Yorktown'', ''Vincennes'', ''Valley Forge'', and ''Thomas S. Gates'') had Mark 26 twin-arm launchers that limited their missile capacity to a total of 88 missiles, and that could not fire the [[Tomahawk missile]]. After the end of the [[Cold War]], the lower capabilities of the original five warships limited them to duties close to the home waters of the United States. \n\nA standard missile loadout for a ''Ticonderoga'' cruiser is 80 SM-2 SAMs, 16 ASROC anti-submarine rockets, and 26 Tomahawk cruise missiles.<ref>[http://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php/focus-analysis/naval-technology/3691-comparison-russian-navy-slava-class-and-us-navy-ticonderoga-class-cruisers-in-combat.html Comparison: Russian Navy Slava-class and US Navy Ticonderoga-class Cruisers in Combat] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314011038/http://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php/focus-analysis/naval-technology/3691-comparison-russian-navy-slava-class-and-us-navy-ticonderoga-class-cruisers-in-combat.html |date=2016-03-14 }} - Navyrecognition.com, 12 March 2016</ref>\n\n===Upgrades===\nOriginally, the U.S. Navy had intended to replace its fleet of ''Ticonderoga''-class guided-missile cruisers with cruisers produced as part of the [[CG(X)]] missile cruiser program; however, severe budget cuts from the [[SC21 (United States)|21st century surface combatant program]] coupled with the increasing cost of the {{sclass-|Zumwalt|destroyer|0}} [[guided missile destroyer]] program resulted in the CG(X) program being canceled.

Flight III ''Arleigh Burke'' destroyers equipped with the [[AMDR|Air Missile Defense Radar]] give enhanced coverage, but putting the radar on standard DDG hulls does not allow enough room for extra staff and command and control facilities for the air warfare commander; DDGs can be used tactically for air defense, but they augment CGs that provide command and control in a battle group and are more used for other missions such as defending other fleet units and keeping sea lanes open. Congress opposed the plan on the grounds that it makes it easier for Navy officials to completely retire the ships once out of service; the Navy would have to retire all cruisers from the fleet by 2028 if all are kept in service, while deactivating half and gradually returning them into service could make 11 cruisers last from 2035 to 2045.

The class uses [[passive electronically scanned array|passive phased-array radar]] and was originally planned as a class of [[destroyer]]s. However, the increased combat capability offered by the [[Aegis Combat System]] and the [[AN/SPY-1]] radar system, together with the capability of operating as a [[flagship]], were used to justify the change of the classification from DDG ([[guided missile destroyer]]) to CG ([[guided-missile cruiser]]) shortly before the keels were laid down for {{USS|Ticonderoga|CG-47|2}} and {{USS|Yorktown|CG-48|2}}.\n\n''Ticonderoga''-class guided-missile cruisers are multi-role warships. Their [[Mark 41 Vertical Launching System|Mk 41 VLS]] can launch [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk cruise missiles]] to strike strategic or tactical targets, or fire long-range [[antiaircraft]] [[RIM-66 Standard|Standard Missiles]] for defense against aircraft or [[anti-ship missile]]s. Their [[Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System|LAMPS III]] [[helicopter]]s and [[sonar]] systems allow them to perform [[anti-submarine warfare|antisubmarine]] missions. ''Ticonderoga''-class ships are designed to be elements of [[carrier battle groups]] or amphibious ready groups, as well as performing missions such as interdiction or escort.<ref name=\"fas\">{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/cg-47.htm |title=CG-47 Ticonderoga (class) |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |accessdate=26 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507191652/http://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/cg-47.htm |archive-date=7 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> With upgrades to their AN/SPY-1 phased radar systems and their associated missile payloads as part of the [[Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System]], members of this class have, in successive tests, repeatedly demonstrated their proficiency as mobile [[anti-ballistic missile]] and [[anti-satellite weapon|anti-satellite]] weaponry platforms.\n\nOf the 27 completed vessels, 19 were built by [[Ingalls Shipbuilding]] and eight by [[Bath Iron Works]] (BIW). All but one ({{USS|Thomas S. Gates|CG-51|2}}) of the ships in the class are named for noteworthy events in U.S. military history, and at least twelve share their names with [[World War II]]-era aircraft carriers. As of 2020, 22 ships are still active and expected to serve for 35 years since commissioning.\n\n==History==\nThe ''Ticonderoga''-class was originally ordered as guided missile destroyers, with the designation DDG-47. These ships were intended to be lower cost platforms for the new Aegis combat system by mounting the system on a hull based on that of the {{sclass-|Spruance|destroyer|1}}. They would complement the much larger and more capable ''[[Strike Cruiser]]'' (CSGN) design. With the cancellation of the ''Strike Cruiser'' as well as the scaled down CGN-42 (''Virginia''-class cruiser hull) alternative, some of the requirements were transferred to the DDG-47, and the class was eventually re-designated as guided missile cruisers, CG-47, to reflect the additional flagship capabilities.<ref>{{cite book|title=U.S. CRUISERS An Illustrated Design History |first=Norman |last=Friedman |publisher=Naval Institute Press |place=Annapolis, Maryland |date=1984 |pages=419\u2013422}}</ref> Ships of the class from CG-52 onwards were equipped with the Mk. 41 vertical launch system.\n\nAs the Aegis combat system and the additional cruiser roles added substantial weight to the ''Spruance''-derived hull, the design had limited growth potential in terms of weight and power margin. In the 1980s, a design study known as ''[[Cruiser Baseline]]'' (CGBL) was created to accommodate the capabilities of CG-52 (Mk. 41-equipped ships of the ''Ticonderoga'' class) on a hull with design and construction techniques matching the DDG-51 ({{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|1}}) for improved survivability and weight allowances.\n\n===Possible early retirement===\nDue to [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] requirements to cut the [[Defense Budget]] for FY2013 and subsequent years, plans were being considered to decommission some of the ''Ticonderoga''-class cruisers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navytimes.com/news/2012/01/defense-navy-avoids-most-pentagon-cuts-012612w/ |work=Navy Times |title=Navy avoids most of Pentagon's latest cuts |last=Cavas |first=Christopher P. |date=26 January 2012 |accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> For the U.S. Defense 2013 Budget Proposal, the U.S. Navy was to decommission seven cruisers early in fiscal years 2013 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navytimes.com/news/2012/02/navy-budget-request-avoids-deep-cuts-021312/ |title=Navy budget request avoids deep cuts |work=Navy Times |date=13 February 2012 |last=Fellman |first=Sam |accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nBecause of these retirements, the U.S. Navy was expected to fall short of its requirement for 94 missile defense [[cruiser]]s and [[destroyer]]s beginning in FY 2025 and continuing past the end of the 30-year planning period. While this is a new requirement as of 2011, and the [[U.S. Navy]] has historically never had so many large missile-armed surface combatants, the relative success of the AEGIS ballistic missile defense system has shifted this national security requirement onto the U.S. Navy.<ref>O'Rourke, Ronald.

This wouldn't technically be an \"early retirement\", as the ships would be at their originally planned 35-year life dates, but they would be able to serve longer with the upgrades.

When they were designed, they had the most powerful [[electronic warfare]] equipment in the U.S. Navy, as well as the most advanced underwater surveillance system. These ships were one of the first classes of [[warship]]s to be built in modules, rather than being assembled from the bottom up.<ref name=\"fas\" />\n\nThe greater size and equipment on the CG-47\u2013class warships increased displacement from 6,900 tons of the DD-963\u2013class destroyers to 9,600 tons of displacement for the heavier cruisers. Aegis cruisers can steam in any ocean and conduct multi-warfare operations anywhere. Some cruisers reported some structural problems in early service after extended periods in extremely heavy seas; they were generally corrected from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. Several ships had superstructure cracks, which were repaired.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nThese ships' superstructures were a modification of that on the ''Spruance''-class destroyers and were required to support two deck-houses (one forward for antennas forward and starboard), and the aft deck-house housed the aft and port antenna arrays. The later ''Arleigh Burke''-class Aegis destroyers are designed from the keel up to carry the SPY-1D radars and have them all clustered together on the forward deck-house, saving space and weight and simplifying cooling requirements. Radar support equipment is closer together, minimizing cable runs and concentrating support equipment.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n[[File:Bow view of USS Spruance (DD-963) and USS Ticonderoga (CG-47) at Naval Station Norfolk on 8 October 1983 (6397938).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Ticonderoga''\u2013class cruisers were built on the same hull as the {{sclass-|Spruance|destroyer|1}}.]]\n\n[[Operations research]] was used to study manpower requirements on the ''Ticonderoga'' class. It was found that four officers and 44 enlisted sailors could be removed from the ship's complement by removing traditional posts that had been made obsolete.<ref name=\"fas\"/> However, manpower savings achieved by eliminating the very manpower-intensive Mk 26 GMLS and replacing it with the far more capable and versatile MK 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) were harder to emulate with the Mk 45 127 mm (5\") gun systems. The Aegis Cruisers are \"double-enders\", and along with the ''Zumwalt''-class, are the only surface combatants in the fleet that can employ two large caliber guns simultaneously.\n\n===Vertical Launching System===\n{{See also|Vertical Launching System}}\n[[File:US Navy 031109-N-9769P-076 Guided missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain (CG 57) steams in the Southern California operating area.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An overhead view of the ''Ticonderoga'' class {{USS|Lake Champlain|CG-57|2}}, with VLS visible fore and aft as the gray boxes near the bow and stern of the ship.]]\n[[File:USS Ticonderoga (CG-47) underway off Puerto Rico on 9 April 1983 (6379851).jpg|thumb|left|upright|The older {{USS|Ticonderoga|CG-47|2}} with the pre-VLS twin-arm launchers visible fore and aft.]]\n\nIn addition to the added [[radar]] capability, the ''Ticonderoga''-class ships built after USS ''Thomas S. Gates'' included two Mark 41 [[Vertical Launching System]]s (VLS). The two VLS allow the ship to have 122 missile storage and launching tubes that can carry a wide variety of missiles, including the [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk]] [[cruise missile]], [[RIM-66 Standard|Standard]] [[surface-to-air missile]], [[RIM-162 ESSM|Evolved Sea Sparrow]] [[surface-to-air missile]], and [[ASROC]] [[antisubmarine warfare]] (ASW) guided rockets. More importantly, the VLS enables all missiles to be on full standby at any given time, shortening the warship's response time before firing. The original five ships (''Ticonderoga'', ''Yorktown'', ''Vincennes'', ''Valley Forge'', and ''Thomas S.

These include an upgrade of the AEGIS computational system with new computers and equipment cabinets, the [[AN/SPQ-9|SPQ-9B]] radar system upgrade introducing an increased capability over just gunfire control, some [[optical fiber]] data communications and software upgrades, and modifications to the vertical launch system allowing two 8 cell modules to fire the [[RIM-162 ESSM]]. The most recent upgrade packages will include SM-6 and Naval Integrated Fire Control \u2013 Counter Air (NIFC-CA) capability. Another upgrade is improving the [[AN/SQQ-89|SQQ-89A(V)15 sonar]] with a multi-function towed array.

Flight III ''Arleigh Burke'' destroyers equipped with the [[AMDR|Air Missile Defense Radar]] give enhanced coverage, but putting the radar on standard DDG hulls does not allow enough room for extra staff and command and control facilities for the air warfare commander; DDGs can be used tactically for air defense, but they augment CGs that provide command and control in a battle group and are more used for other missions such as defending other fleet units and keeping sea lanes open. Congress opposed the plan on the grounds that it makes it easier for Navy officials to completely retire the ships once out of service; the Navy would have to retire all cruisers from the fleet by 2028 if all are kept in service, while deactivating half and gradually returning them into service could make 11 cruisers last from 2035 to 2045.

Although the Trident missiles have no preset targets when the submarines go on patrol,{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} they can be given targets quickly, from the [[United States Strategic Command]] based in [[Nebraska]],{{sfn|Genat|Genat|1997|p=39}} using secure and constant [[communication with submarines|radio communications links]], including [[very low frequency]] systems.\n\nThe lead submarine of this class is {{USS|Ohio|SSGN-726|6}}.  All the ''Ohio''-class submarines, except for {{USS|Henry M. Jackson|SSBN-730|6}}, are named for [[U.S. state]]s, which U.S. Navy tradition had previously reserved for [[battleship]]s and [[cruiser]]s.\n\n== Description ==\nThe ''Ohio''-class submarine was designed for extended strategic deterrent patrols. Each submarine is assigned two complete crews, called the Blue crew and the Gold crew, each typically serving 70-to-90-day deterrent patrols. To decrease the time in port for crew turnover and replenishment, three large logistics hatches have been installed to provide large-diameter resupply and repair access. These hatches allow rapid transfer of supply pallets, equipment replacement modules, and machinery components, speeding up replenishment and maintenance of the submarines. Moreover, the \"stealth\" ability of the submarines was significantly improved over all previous ballistic-missile subs. '' Ohio'' was virtually undetectable in her sea trials in 1982, giving the U.S. Navy extremely advanced flexibility.<ref>D. Douglas Dalgleish and Larry Schweikart, Trident.

The first eight ''Ohio''-class submarines were armed at first with 24 Trident I C4 SLBMs.<ref name=\"Adcock_p40\" /> Beginning with the ninth Trident submarine, {{USS|Tennessee|SSBN-734|2}}, the remaining boats were equipped with the larger, three-stage [[Trident missile|Trident II D5 missile]].<ref name=\"Adcock_p41\" /> The Trident I missile carries eight [[multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle]]s, while the Trident II missile carries 12, in total delivering more destructive power than the Trident I missile and with greater accuracy. Starting with {{USS|Alaska|SSBN-732|2}} in 2000, the Navy began converting its remaining ballistic missile submarines armed with C4 missiles to carry D5 missiles. This task was completed in mid-2008. The first eight submarines had their home ports at [[Naval Base Kitsap|Bangor, Washington]], to replace the submarines carrying [[Polaris missile|Polaris A3 missile]]s that were then being decommissioned. The remaining 10 submarines originally had their home ports at [[Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay|Kings Bay, Georgia]], replacing the [[Poseidon missile|Poseidon]] and Trident Backfit submarines of the Atlantic Fleet. \n\n=== SSBN/SSGN conversions ===\n[[File:OHIOSSGNCONVERSION.JPG|thumb|right|USS ''Ohio'' being converted from an SSBN to an SSGN in March 2004|alt=Black submarine with orange paint from cheatline down in drydock at nightfall]]\n\nIn 1994, the [[Nuclear Posture Review]] study determined that, of the 18 ''Ohio'' SSBNs the U.S. Navy would be operating in total, 14 would be sufficient for the strategic needs of the U.S. The decision was made to convert four ''Ohio''-class boats into SSGNs capable of conducting conventional [[Military strike|land attack]] and [[Special forces|special operations]].

Advanced procurement was funded at $355 million in [[fiscal year]] 2002, $825 million in the FY 2003 budget and, through the five-year defense budget plan, at $936 million in FY 2004, $505 million in FY 2005, and $170 million in FY 2006.

Each submarine is assigned two complete crews, called the Blue crew and the Gold crew, each typically serving 70-to-90-day deterrent patrols. To decrease the time in port for crew turnover and replenishment, three large logistics hatches have been installed to provide large-diameter resupply and repair access. These hatches allow rapid transfer of supply pallets, equipment replacement modules, and machinery components, speeding up replenishment and maintenance of the submarines. Moreover, the \"stealth\" ability of the submarines was significantly improved over all previous ballistic-missile subs. '' Ohio'' was virtually undetectable in her sea trials in 1982, giving the U.S. Navy extremely advanced flexibility.<ref>D. Douglas Dalgleish and Larry Schweikart, Trident.

Each SSBN submarine is armed with up to 24 [[UGM-133 Trident II|Trident II]] [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBM). Each SSGN is capable of carrying 154 [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk]] [[cruise missile]]s, plus a complement of [[Harpoon missile]]s to be fired through their [[torpedo tube]]s.\n\nAs part of the [[New START]] treaty, four tubes on each SSBN will be deactivated, leaving each ship with only 20 available for war loads.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hans M.

The first eight ''Ohio''-class submarines were armed at first with 24 Trident I C4 SLBMs.<ref name=\"Adcock_p40\" /> Beginning with the ninth Trident submarine, {{USS|Tennessee|SSBN-734|2}}, the remaining boats were equipped with the larger, three-stage [[Trident missile|Trident II D5 missile]].<ref name=\"Adcock_p41\" /> The Trident I missile carries eight [[multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle]]s, while the Trident II missile carries 12, in total delivering more destructive power than the Trident I missile and with greater accuracy. Starting with {{USS|Alaska|SSBN-732|2}} in 2000, the Navy began converting its remaining ballistic missile submarines armed with C4 missiles to carry D5 missiles. This task was completed in mid-2008.

Advanced procurement was funded at $355 million in [[fiscal year]] 2002, $825 million in the FY 2003 budget and, through the five-year defense budget plan, at $936 million in FY 2004, $505 million in FY 2005, and $170 million in FY 2006.

James has a week to arrange his affairs. His bishop leaves it to James to decide whether to notify the police.\n\nJames' daughter Fiona has attempted [[suicide]] after feeling abandoned following her mother's death and her father's entry into the priesthood. Their rapprochement is a principal theme of the film.\n\nLocal butcher Jack Brennan has hit his unfaithful wife, Veronica, and James confronts him. Jack denies it, blaming Veronica's African lover, Simon. James goes about his pastoral duties, and obtains a [[revolver]] for an elderly American writer who is contemplating suicide to thwart senile decay.\n\nMillionaire Michael Fitzgerald's family has deserted him and he feels directionless and detached from reality. At the hospital, following a car crash, James performs the [[last rites]] for the French driver, and comforts the widow, Teresa. She stoically accepts her husband's fate, believing premature death unfair only if the victim has never felt real love. James visits Freddie Joyce in jail, a killer who ate his female victims and now, asking for forgiveness, cannot recall where one particular victim is buried. James accuses him of insincerity, saying if God cannot understand Freddie, nobody can. Through James's dealings with Freddie, Michael, another potential suicide (Milo), Teresa and Fiona, the film reflects on guilt, sin, virtue, depression and suicide.\n\nThat night, James witnesses the burning down of his church. He later tells Fiona he will never abandon her, spiritually at least, and she reciprocates. Finding his dog dead with its throat cut, he buries it, weeping, but keeps the death from his daughter the next morning as she leaves. Walking a country lane, James chats innocently with a young girl when the father drives up, grabs the girl and crudely questions James's motives. At the pub, the doctor/pathologist tells James a horrifying story about a small child rendered deaf, mute, paralyzed and blind after botched [[anaesthesia]], and contemplates the ineffable terror of such sensory isolation. James, angered, gets drunk, argues with cynical publican Brendan Lynch and empties the revolver into the furnishings. \n\nBrendan wields a [[baseball]] bat and later, a beaten-up James is recovering at home. He violently berates his house guest Father Leary who, offended, leaves the next morning. James decides to fly to Dublin, but returns from the airport after meeting Teresa and seeing her husband's coffin by the aircraft. Heading to the beach on the fateful Sunday, James chats with the ageing writer en route, then by phone to Fiona, saying sin is considered too much and virtue not enough. He stresses the importance of [[forgiveness]] and they forgive one another.\n\nAfter James throws his revolver into the sea, a distressed Michael walks up and James promises to visit him. Later, the altar boy, painting a seascape at the top of the beach, witnesses James waiting on the beach as Jack Brennan strides along the shore towards James, a revolver outstretched. Jack confesses to the arson and to hitting Veronica but denies killing the dog. Jack, hearing that James shed tears over his dog, asks if he cried similarly over news reports concerning children abused by priests. James says no, he had felt detached from such stories\u2014whereupon the enraged Jack shoots James in the side. The boy runs towards them but James shouts at him to flee. Jack says it is too late to stop, telling James to say his prayers. When James says he already has, Jack delivers a mortal shot to the priest's head.\n\nIn brief tableaux, we see the parishioners and Teresa going about their quotidian lives. The final scene ends as Fiona visits Jack in prison, each tentatively picking up a telephone handset to talk across the intervening glass panel.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]]<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/berlin-2012-brendan-gleeson-chris%20odowd-aidan-gill-Calvary-288437|title=Berlin 2012: Brendan Gleeson, Chris O'Dowd and Aidan Gillen Sign Up for John Michael McDonagh's 'Calvary'|last=Kemp|first=Stuart|work=hollywoodreporter.com|date=9 February 2012|accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref> as Father James \n* [[Chris O'Dowd]]<ref name=\"Deadline\" /> as Jack Brennan\n* [[Kelly Reilly]]<ref name=\"Deadline\" /> as Fiona \n* [[Aidan Gillen]]<ref name=\"Deadline\" /> as Dr. Frank Harte\n* [[Dylan Moran]]<ref name=\"IFTN2\" /> as Michael Fitzgerald \n* [[Isaach de Bankol\u00e9]]<ref name=\"IFTN\" /> as Simon\n* [[M.

James has a week to arrange his affairs. His bishop leaves it to James to decide whether to notify the police.\n\nJames' daughter Fiona has attempted [[suicide]] after feeling abandoned following her mother's death and her father's entry into the priesthood. Their rapprochement is a principal theme of the film.\n\nLocal butcher Jack Brennan has hit his unfaithful wife, Veronica, and James confronts him. Jack denies it, blaming Veronica's African lover, Simon. James goes about his pastoral duties, and obtains a [[revolver]] for an elderly American writer who is contemplating suicide to thwart senile decay.\n\nMillionaire Michael Fitzgerald's family has deserted him and he feels directionless and detached from reality. At the hospital, following a car crash, James performs the [[last rites]] for the French driver, and comforts the widow, Teresa. She stoically accepts her husband's fate, believing premature death unfair only if the victim has never felt real love. James visits Freddie Joyce in jail, a killer who ate his female victims and now, asking for forgiveness, cannot recall where one particular victim is buried. James accuses him of insincerity, saying if God cannot understand Freddie, nobody can. Through James's dealings with Freddie, Michael, another potential suicide (Milo), Teresa and Fiona, the film reflects on guilt, sin, virtue, depression and suicide.\n\nThat night, James witnesses the burning down of his church. He later tells Fiona he will never abandon her, spiritually at least, and she reciprocates. Finding his dog dead with its throat cut, he buries it, weeping, but keeps the death from his daughter the next morning as she leaves. Walking a country lane, James chats innocently with a young girl when the father drives up, grabs the girl and crudely questions James's motives. At the pub, the doctor/pathologist tells James a horrifying story about a small child rendered deaf, mute, paralyzed and blind after botched [[anaesthesia]], and contemplates the ineffable terror of such sensory isolation. James, angered, gets drunk, argues with cynical publican Brendan Lynch and empties the revolver into the furnishings. \n\nBrendan wields a [[baseball]] bat and later, a beaten-up James is recovering at home. He violently berates his house guest Father Leary who, offended, leaves the next morning. James decides to fly to Dublin, but returns from the airport after meeting Teresa and seeing her husband's coffin by the aircraft. Heading to the beach on the fateful Sunday, James chats with the ageing writer en route, then by phone to Fiona, saying sin is considered too much and virtue not enough. He stresses the importance of [[forgiveness]] and they forgive one another.\n\nAfter James throws his revolver into the sea, a distressed Michael walks up and James promises to visit him. Later, the altar boy, painting a seascape at the top of the beach, witnesses James waiting on the beach as Jack Brennan strides along the shore towards James, a revolver outstretched. Jack confesses to the arson and to hitting Veronica but denies killing the dog. Jack, hearing that James shed tears over his dog, asks if he cried similarly over news reports concerning children abused by priests. James says no, he had felt detached from such stories\u2014whereupon the enraged Jack shoots James in the side. The boy runs towards them but James shouts at him to flee. Jack says it is too late to stop, telling James to say his prayers. When James says he already has, Jack delivers a mortal shot to the priest's head.\n\nIn brief tableaux, we see the parishioners and Teresa going about their quotidian lives. The final scene ends as Fiona visits Jack in prison, each tentatively picking up a telephone handset to talk across the intervening glass panel.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]]<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/berlin-2012-brendan-gleeson-chris%20odowd-aidan-gill-Calvary-288437|title=Berlin 2012: Brendan Gleeson, Chris O'Dowd and Aidan Gillen Sign Up for John Michael McDonagh's 'Calvary'|last=Kemp|first=Stuart|work=hollywoodreporter.com|date=9 February 2012|accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref> as Father James \n* [[Chris O'Dowd]]<ref name=\"Deadline\" /> as Jack Brennan\n* [[Kelly Reilly]]<ref name=\"Deadline\" /> as Fiona \n* [[Aidan Gillen]]<ref name=\"Deadline\" /> as Dr. Frank Harte\n* [[Dylan Moran]]<ref name=\"IFTN2\" /> as Michael Fitzgerald \n* [[Isaach de Bankol\u00e9]]<ref name=\"IFTN\" /> as Simon\n* [[M.
