The film stars [[Nanako Matsushima]], [[Hiroyuki Sanada]] and Rikiya \u014ctaka, and follows a reporter who is racing to investigate the mystery behind a cursed videotape that kills the viewer seven days after watching it.\n\nProduction took approximately nine months.<ref name=\"nakatainterview\" /> ''Ring'' and its sequel ''[[Spiral (1998 film)|Rasen]]'' were released in Japan at the same time. After its release, ''Ring'' was a huge box office success in Japan and was acclaimed by critics. It inspired numerous follow-ups within the [[The_Ring_(franchise)|''Ring'' franchise]] and triggered a trend of Western [[remake]]s, starting with the 2002 American film ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo high schoolers, Masami and Tomoko, talk about a videotape that was allegedly recorded in [[Izu Province|Izu]] and bears a curse that kills the viewer in one week. Tomoko reveals that a week ago, she and three of her friends watched a strange tape and received a call after watching. As soon as Masami returns upstairs, Tomoko witnesses her TV turn on by itself, and soon thereafter is killed by an unseen force.\n\nMeanwhile, the cursed video story is being investigated by Tomoko's maternal aunt; newspaper reporter [[List of Ring characters#Reiko Asakawa|Reiko Asakawa]]. When Reiko and her young son Yoichi are at Tomoko's funeral, she discovers that three of Tomoko's friends also died that same night, with their faces twisted in fear. In Tomoko's room the next day, Reiko looks through photos, finding that the four friends stayed in a rental cabin in Izu. One of the photos shows their faces blurred.\n\nReiko arrives at the cabin in Izu, and notices an unlabeled tape on the rental shelf. She watches it for herself: the tape shows a series of seemingly unrelated disturbing images, accompanied by a metallic screeching. At the end, she sees a mysterious reflection in the TV and receives a phone call but there are only screeching sounds. Taking the threat of death seriously, she leaves with the tape and enlists her ex-husband, [[List of Ring characters#Ryuji Takayama|Ry\u016bji Takayama]] to investigate its origin. Ryuji discovers that Reiko's face is blurred in a photo, like those of Tomoko and her friends. Ry\u016bji watches the tape and tells her to make him a copy. While studying the tape the next day, the two find a hidden message within the tape saying \"frolic in brine, goblins be thine\". Ryuji eventually finds that the message is in a dialect from [[Izu \u014cshima]] Island. Reiko later catches Yoichi watching the tape, claiming the ghost of Tomoko told him to.\n\nReiko and Ry\u016bji sail for \u014cshima and discover the history of the great psychic Shizuko Yamamura. They stay at an inn run by Takashi, Shizuko's brother. Ry\u016bji reveals to Takashi that he knows the old man exposed Shizuko to the media, hoping to make money from it. The media attention attracted Dr. Heihachiro Ikuma, who, besides researching [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]], had an affair with Shizuko. Dr. Ikuma held a demonstration, where Shizuko displayed her psychic abilities. However, one journalist spitefully denounced her as a fraud, inciting his other colleagues to do the same. In retaliation, Shizuko's daughter, [[Sadako Yamamura|Sadako]], psychokinetically kills the journalist, with his face twisted like Tomoko's. Shortly after, a series of slanderous reports drive Shizuko to commit suicide. Dr. Ikuma was fired and took Sadako away.\n\nReiko and Ry\u016bji deduce that Sadako [[Psionics|psionically]] created the cursed tape to express her fury against the world. The two go back to Izu and uncover a well underneath the cabin. Through a vision, they discover that Dr. Ikuma murdered Sadako and threw her body into the well. They try to find Sadako's body in an attempt to appease her spirit. Minutes before her seven days are up, Reiko finds Sadako's corpse, and they return home, relieved that the curse is seemingly broken.\n\nThe next day, however, Ry\u016bji's TV switches on by itself and shows the image of a well. The [[Onry\u014d|vengeful ghost]] of Sadako crawls out of the well, out of Ry\u016bji's TV set, and frightens him into shock, killing him. Reiko had tried to call Ryuji so she hears his last minutes over the phone and finds out only she is free from the curse. Desperate to save Yoichi, she realizes that copying the tape and showing it to someone else was what saved her. She drives to her father's house, where she plans to let her son copy the tape and show it to her father.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nanako Matsushima]] as [[Reiko Asakawa]], a journalist who investigates her niece's death and finds the cursed videotape.\n*[[Hiroyuki Sanada]] as [[Ryuji Takayama|Ry\u016bji Takayama]], Reiko's ex-husband, a former medical student turned university professor. He has a degree of [[extrasensory perception|sixth sense]] that detects supernatural auras.\n* [[Rikiya Otaka|Rikiya \u014ctaka]] as [[Yoichi Asakawa|Y\u014dichi Asakawa]], Reiko's young son who also has a sixth sense like his father.\n* [[Miki Nakatani]] as Mai Takano, Ryuji's student.\n* [[Y\u016bko Takeuchi]] as Tomoko \u014cishi, Reiko's niece who watches the cursed videotape and is amongst its first victims.\n* [[Hitomi Sat\u014d (actress)|Hitomi Sat\u014d]] as Masami Kurahashi, Tomoko's best friend.\n* [[Daisuke Ban]] as Dr. Heihachiro Ikuma, Sadako's father who threw her down a well.\n* [[Rie In\u014d]] as [[Sadako Yamamura]], a girl with psychic powers who was thrown down a well where she died; her spirit lived on within a videotape.\n* Masako as Shizuko Yamamura, Sadako's mother.

Colette Balmain identifies, \u201cIn the figure of Sadako, ''Ring'' [utilises the] vengeful [[y\u016brei]] archetype of conventional Japanese horror\u201d. She argues how this traditional Japanese figure is expressed via a videotape which \u201cembodies contemporary anxieties, in that it is technology through which the repressed past reasserts itself\u201d.<ref name=autogenerated6 />\n\nRuth Goldberg argues that ''Ring'' expresses \"ambivalence about motherhood\u201d. She reads Reiko as a mother who \u2013 due to the new potential for women's independence \u2013 neglects her 'natural' role as martyred homemaker in pursuit of an independent identity, subsequently neglecting her child. Goldberg identifies a [[Uncanny|doubling effect]] whereby the unconscious conflicts of Reiko's family are expressed via the supernatural in the other family under Reiko's investigation.<ref>Goldberg, Ruth (2004), 'Demons in the Family', in ''Planks of Reason'', ed. [[Barry Keith Grant]] and Christopher Sharrett, (Scarecrow Press), pp. 370-385.</ref>\n\nJay McRoy reads the ending hopefully: if the characters therapeutically understand their conflicts, they can live on.<ref name=autogenerated5 /> Balmain, however, is not optimistic; she reads the replication of the video as technology spreading, virus-like, throughout Japan.<ref name=autogenerated6 />\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=November 2016}}\nAfter the moderate success of the [[Ring (Suzuki novel)|''Ring'' novel]], written by [[Koji Suzuki (writer)|K\u014dji Suzuki]] and published in 1991, publisher [[Kadokawa Shoten]] decided to make a motion picture adaptation of ''Ring''.\n\nScreenwriter Hiroshi Takahashi and director [[Hideo Nakata]] collaborated to work on the script after reading Suzuki's novel and watching ''[[Ring: Kanzenban]]'', [[Fuji Television]] Network's 1995 made-for-TV film, directed by Chisui Takigawa.<ref name=autogenerated2>Meikle, Dennis (2005), ''The Ring Companion'' (London: Titan Books).</ref> However, the TV version was re-edited and released on VHS under a new title, ''[[Ring: Kanzenban]]'' (''Ring: The Complete Edition'').<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Nakata did not state which TV version he and Takahashi watched.\n\nIn their film script, Takashi and Nakata changed the protagonist's gender (from male to female), name (from Kazuyuki Asakawa to Reiko Asakawa), marital status (from married to divorced) and child's gender and name (from daughter Yoko to son Yoichi).<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nWith the budget of US$1.2 million, the entire production took nine months and one week.

The film stars [[Nanako Matsushima]], [[Hiroyuki Sanada]] and Rikiya \u014ctaka, and follows a reporter who is racing to investigate the mystery behind a cursed videotape that kills the viewer seven days after watching it.\n\nProduction took approximately nine months.<ref name=\"nakatainterview\" /> ''Ring'' and its sequel ''[[Spiral (1998 film)|Rasen]]'' were released in Japan at the same time. After its release, ''Ring'' was a huge box office success in Japan and was acclaimed by critics. It inspired numerous follow-ups within the [[The_Ring_(franchise)|''Ring'' franchise]] and triggered a trend of Western [[remake]]s, starting with the 2002 American film ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo high schoolers, Masami and Tomoko, talk about a videotape that was allegedly recorded in [[Izu Province|Izu]] and bears a curse that kills the viewer in one week. Tomoko reveals that a week ago, she and three of her friends watched a strange tape and received a call after watching. As soon as Masami returns upstairs, Tomoko witnesses her TV turn on by itself, and soon thereafter is killed by an unseen force.\n\nMeanwhile, the cursed video story is being investigated by Tomoko's maternal aunt; newspaper reporter [[List of Ring characters#Reiko Asakawa|Reiko Asakawa]]. When Reiko and her young son Yoichi are at Tomoko's funeral, she discovers that three of Tomoko's friends also died that same night, with their faces twisted in fear. In Tomoko's room the next day, Reiko looks through photos, finding that the four friends stayed in a rental cabin in Izu. One of the photos shows their faces blurred.\n\nReiko arrives at the cabin in Izu, and notices an unlabeled tape on the rental shelf. She watches it for herself: the tape shows a series of seemingly unrelated disturbing images, accompanied by a metallic screeching. At the end, she sees a mysterious reflection in the TV and receives a phone call but there are only screeching sounds. Taking the threat of death seriously, she leaves with the tape and enlists her ex-husband, [[List of Ring characters#Ryuji Takayama|Ry\u016bji Takayama]] to investigate its origin. Ryuji discovers that Reiko's face is blurred in a photo, like those of Tomoko and her friends. Ry\u016bji watches the tape and tells her to make him a copy. While studying the tape the next day, the two find a hidden message within the tape saying \"frolic in brine, goblins be thine\". Ryuji eventually finds that the message is in a dialect from [[Izu \u014cshima]] Island. Reiko later catches Yoichi watching the tape, claiming the ghost of Tomoko told him to.\n\nReiko and Ry\u016bji sail for \u014cshima and discover the history of the great psychic Shizuko Yamamura. They stay at an inn run by Takashi, Shizuko's brother. Ry\u016bji reveals to Takashi that he knows the old man exposed Shizuko to the media, hoping to make money from it. The media attention attracted Dr. Heihachiro Ikuma, who, besides researching [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]], had an affair with Shizuko. Dr. Ikuma held a demonstration, where Shizuko displayed her psychic abilities. However, one journalist spitefully denounced her as a fraud, inciting his other colleagues to do the same. In retaliation, Shizuko's daughter, [[Sadako Yamamura|Sadako]], psychokinetically kills the journalist, with his face twisted like Tomoko's. Shortly after, a series of slanderous reports drive Shizuko to commit suicide. Dr. Ikuma was fired and took Sadako away.\n\nReiko and Ry\u016bji deduce that Sadako [[Psionics|psionically]] created the cursed tape to express her fury against the world. The two go back to Izu and uncover a well underneath the cabin. Through a vision, they discover that Dr. Ikuma murdered Sadako and threw her body into the well. They try to find Sadako's body in an attempt to appease her spirit. Minutes before her seven days are up, Reiko finds Sadako's corpse, and they return home, relieved that the curse is seemingly broken.\n\nThe next day, however, Ry\u016bji's TV switches on by itself and shows the image of a well. The [[Onry\u014d|vengeful ghost]] of Sadako crawls out of the well, out of Ry\u016bji's TV set, and frightens him into shock, killing him. Reiko had tried to call Ryuji so she hears his last minutes over the phone and finds out only she is free from the curse. Desperate to save Yoichi, she realizes that copying the tape and showing it to someone else was what saved her. She drives to her father's house, where she plans to let her son copy the tape and show it to her father.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nanako Matsushima]] as [[Reiko Asakawa]], a journalist who investigates her niece's death and finds the cursed videotape.\n*[[Hiroyuki Sanada]] as [[Ryuji Takayama|Ry\u016bji Takayama]], Reiko's ex-husband, a former medical student turned university professor.

Colette Balmain identifies, \u201cIn the figure of Sadako, ''Ring'' [utilises the] vengeful [[y\u016brei]] archetype of conventional Japanese horror\u201d. She argues how this traditional Japanese figure is expressed via a videotape which \u201cembodies contemporary anxieties, in that it is technology through which the repressed past reasserts itself\u201d.<ref name=autogenerated6 />\n\nRuth Goldberg argues that ''Ring'' expresses \"ambivalence about motherhood\u201d. She reads Reiko as a mother who \u2013 due to the new potential for women's independence \u2013 neglects her 'natural' role as martyred homemaker in pursuit of an independent identity, subsequently neglecting her child. Goldberg identifies a [[Uncanny|doubling effect]] whereby the unconscious conflicts of Reiko's family are expressed via the supernatural in the other family under Reiko's investigation.<ref>Goldberg, Ruth (2004), 'Demons in the Family', in ''Planks of Reason'', ed.
