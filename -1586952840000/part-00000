{"title_page": "Apocalyptic literature", "text_new": "4+2=5\n3-2=4\n50/10=6\n\n{{About |the genre of religious writings dealing with revelation|the genre of fiction dealing with cataclysm|Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction}}\n{{redirect|Apocalypse|other uses|Apocalypse (disambiguation)}}\n\n'''Apocalyptic literature''' is a [[Literary genre|genre]] of [[prophecy|prophetical]] writing that developed in post-[[Galut|Exilic]] [[Judaism|Jewish]] culture and was popular among [[millennialism|millennialist]] [[early Christians]].\n\n''Apocalypse'' (\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03c5\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2) is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning \"[[revelation]]\", \"an unveiling or unfolding of things not previously known and which could not be known apart from the unveiling\".<ref>Goswiller 1987 p.3</ref> As a genre, apocalyptic literature details the authors' visions of the [[end times]] as revealed by an [[angel]] or other heavenly messenger.<ref>Coogan 2009 p 424</ref> The apocalyptic literature of Judaism and Christianity embraces a considerable period, from the centuries following the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]] down to the close of the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Charles|1911|p=169}}\n\n==Origins==\nApocalyptic elements can be detected in the prophetical books of [[Book of Joel|Joel]] and [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]], while [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] chapters 24\u201327 and 33 present well-developed apocalypses. The [[Book of Daniel]] offers a fully matured and classic example of this genre of literature.{{sfn|Charles|1911|p=169}}\n\n===Unfulfilled prophecy===\n{{Original research section|date=August 2018}}\nThe non-fulfillment of prophecies served to popularize the methods of apocalyptic in comparison with the non-fulfillment of the [[advent]] of the [[Jesus and Messianic prophecy|Messianic kingdom]]. Thus, though Jeremiah had promised that after seventy years<ref>Jeremiah 25:11, 29:10</ref> Israelites should be restored to their own land,<ref>Jeremiah 29:5,6</ref> and then enjoy the blessings of the Messianic kingdom under the Messianic king,<ref>Jeremiah 28:5,6</ref> this period passed by and things remained as of old.{{sfn|Charles|1911|pp=169-170}} Some {{Who|date=October 2009}} believe that the Messianic kingdom was not necessarily predicted to occur at the end of the seventy years of the Babylonian exile, but at some unspecified time in the future.  The only thing for certain that was predicted was the return of the Jews to their land, which occurred when [[Cyrus the Persian]] conquered Babylon in circa 539 BC. Thus, the fulfillment of the Messianic kingdom remained in the future for the Jews.\n\n[[Book of Haggai|Haggai]] and Zechariah explained the delay by the failure of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] to rebuild the temple, and so hope of the kingdom persisted, until in the first half of the 2nd century the delay is explained in the Books of Daniel and [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]] as due not to man's shortcomings but to the counsels of God.{{sfn|Charles|1911|p=170}} Regarding the 70 years of exile predicted in Jeremiah 29:10, the Jews were first exiled in 605&nbsp;BC in the reign of king [[Jehoiakim]] and were allowed to return to their land in c. 536&nbsp;BC when [[Cyrus the Great|King Cyrus]] conquered Babylon. This period was approximately 70 years, as prophesied by Jeremiah.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} But some people{{Who|date=October 2016}} believe that the 70 years of Jeremiah were later interpreted by the angel in Daniel 9 as 70 weeks of years, of which 69\u00bd have already expired, while Enoch 85 interprets the 70 years of Jeremiah as the 70 successive reigns of the 70 angelic patrons of the nations, which are to come to a close in his own generation.{{sfn|Charles|1911|p=170}} The Book of Enoch, however, was not considered inspired Scripture by the Jews, so that any failed prophecy in it is of no consequence to the Jewish faith.\n\nThe Greek empire of the East was overthrown by Rome, and prompted a new interpretation of Daniel. The [[Four empires|fourth and last empire]] was declared to be Roman by the [[Book of Baruch|Apocalypse of Baruch]]{{sfn|Charles|1911|p=170}} chapters 36\u201340 and [[4 Ezra]] 10:60\u201312:35. Again, these two books were not considered inspired Scripture by the Jews, and thus were not authoritative on matters of prophecy. In addition, earlier in Daniel chapter 7 and also in chapter 2, the fourth and final world empire is considered to be Rome since Babylon, Medo-Persia ([[Achaemenid Empire]]), Greece, and Rome were world empires which all clearly arrived in succession. Thus, it might be interpreted{{By whom|date=October 2016}} that Daniel was saying  that Rome would be the last world power before the kingdom of God.\n\nSuch ideas as those of \"the day of Yahweh\" and the \"new heavens and a new earth\" were re-interpreted by the Jewish people with fresh nuances in conformity with their new settings. Thus the inner development of Jewish apocalyptic was conditioned by the historical experiences of the nation.{{sfn|Charles|1911|p=170}} But the prophecies found in Jewish scriptures, which have not changed over time, await their fulfillment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n===Traditions===\nAnother source of apocalyptic thought was primitive mythological and cosmological traditions, in which the eye of the seer could see the secrets of the future. Thus the six days of the world's creation, followed by a seventh of rest, were regarded as at once a history of the past and a forecasting of the future. As the world was made in six days its history would be accomplished in six thousand years, since each day with God was as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day; and as the six days of creation were followed by one of rest, so the six thousand years of the world's history would be followed by a rest of a thousand years.<ref>2 Enoch 32:2\u201333:2</ref>{{sfn|Charles|1911|p=170}}\n\n==Object and contents==\nThe object of this literature in general was to square the righteousness of God with the suffering condition of His righteous servants on earth.  Early [[Old Testament]] prophecy taught the need of personal and national righteousness, and foretold the ultimate blessedness of the righteous nation on the present earth. Its views were not systematic and comprehensive in regard to the nations in general. Regarding the individual, it held that God\u2019s service here was its own and adequate reward, and saw no need of postulating another world to set right the evils of this one.\n\nBut later, with the growing claims of the individual and the acknowledgment of these in the religious and intellectual life, both problems, and especially the latter, pressed themselves irresistibly on the notice of religious thinkers, and made it impossible for any conception of the divine rule and righteousness to gain acceptance, which did not render adequate satisfaction to the claims of both problems. To render such satisfaction was the task undertaken by apocalyptic, as well as to vindicate the righteousness of God alike in respect of the individual and of the nation. Later prophecy incorporated an idea of future vindication of present evils, often including the idea of an afterlife.\n\nApocalyptic prophets sketched in outline the history of the world and mankind, the origin of evil and its course, and the final consummation of all things. The righteous as a nation should yet possess the earth, either via an eternal Messianic kingdom on earth, or else in temporary blessedness here and eternal blessedness hereafter. Though the individual might perish amid the disorders of this world, apocalyptic prophets taught that the righteous person would not fail to attain through resurrection the recompense that was due in the Messianic kingdom or, alternatively, in heaven itself.{{sfn|Charles|1911|p=170}}\n\n==Comparison to prophecy==\n{{original research|section|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Message===\nSome may distinguish between the messages of the prophets and the messages of proto-apocalyptic and apocalyptic literature by saying that the message of the prophets was primarily a preaching of repentance and righteousness needed for the nation to escape judgment; the message of the apocalyptic writers was of patience and trust for that deliverance and reward were sure to come.{{sfn|Charles|1911|p=170}} Neither the prophets nor the apocalyptic authors are without conflict between their messages, however, and there are significant similarities between prophecy and apocalyptic writings.\n\nApocalyptic literature shares with prophecy revelation through the use of visions and dreams, and these often combine reality and fantasy. In both cases, a heavenly interpreter is often provided to the receiver so that he may understand the many complexities of what he has seen. The oracles in Amos, Hosea, First Isaiah, and Jeremiah give a clear sense of how messages of imminent punishment develop into the later proto-apocalyptic literature, and eventually into the thoroughly apocalyptic literature of Daniel 7\u201312. The fully apocalyptic visions in Daniel 7\u201312, as well as those in the New Testament\u2019s Revelation, can trace their roots to the pre-exilic latter biblical prophets; the sixth century BCE prophets Ezekiel, Isaiah 40\u201355 and 56\u201366, Haggai 2, and Zechariah 1\u20138 show a transition phase between prophecy and apocalyptic literature.<ref>Coogan p.354</ref>\n\n===Dualistic theology===\nProphecy believes that this world is God's world and that in this world His goodness and truth will yet be vindicated. Hence the prophet prophesies of a definite future arising out of and organically connected with the present. The apocalyptic writer despairs of the present and directs his hopes to the future, to a new world standing in essential opposition to the present.<ref>[[4 Ezra]] 7:50</ref> This becomes a dualistic principle, which, though it can largely be accounted for by the interaction of certain inner tendencies and outward sorrowful experience on the part of Judaism, may ultimately be derived from [[Ahura Mazda|Mazdean]] influences. This principle, which shows itself in the conception that the various nations are under angelic rulers, who are in a greater or less degree in rebellion against God, as in Daniel and Enoch, grows in strength with each succeeding age, till at last [[Satan]] is conceived as \"the ruler of this world\"<ref>John 12:31</ref> or \"the god of this age.\"<ref>2 Corinthians 4:4</ref>{{sfn|Charles|1911|pp=170-171}}\n\n===Conception of history===\nApocalyptic writing took a wider view of the world's history than did prophecy. Whereas prophecy had to deal with governments of other nations, apocalyptic writings arose at a time when Israel had been subject for generations to the sway of one or other of the great world-powers. Hence to harmonize Israel's difficulties with belief in God's righteousness, apocalyptic writing had to encompass such events in the counsels of God, the rise, duration and the downfall of each empire in turn, until, finally the lordship of the world passed into the hands of Israel, or the final judgment arrived. These events belonged in the main to the past, but the writer represented them as still in the future, arranged under certain artificial categories of time definitely determined from the beginning in the counsels of God and revealed by Him to His servants, the prophets. [[Determinism]] thus became a leading characteristic of Jewish apocalyptic, and its conception of history became mechanical.{{sfn|Charles|1911|p=171}}\n\n==Hebrew Bible==\n{{Jewish mysticism}}\n\n===Characteristics===\nThe [[revelation]]s from heavenly messengers, about the end times, came in the form of angels, or from people who have been taken up to heaven and are returned to earth with messages. The descriptions not only tell of the end times, but also describe both past and present events and their significance, often in heavily coded language. When speaking of the end times, apocalyptic literature generally included chronologies of events that will occur and frequently places them in the near future, which gives a sense of urgency to the prophet\u2019s broader message. Though the understanding of the present is bleak, the visions of the future are far more positive, and include divinely delivered victory and a complete reformation of absolutely everything. Many visions of these end times mirror creation mythologies, invoke the triumph of God over the primordial forces of chaos, and provide clear distinctions between light and dark, [[good and evil]]. In such revelations, humankind is typically divided into a small group that experiences salvation, while the wicked majority is destroyed.

The [[Book of Daniel]] offers a fully matured and classic example of this genre of literature.{{sfn|Charles|1911|p=169}}\n\n===Unfulfilled prophecy===\n{{Original research section|date=August 2018}}\nThe non-fulfillment of prophecies served to popularize the methods of apocalyptic in comparison with the non-fulfillment of the [[advent]] of the [[Jesus and Messianic prophecy|Messianic kingdom]]. Thus, though Jeremiah had promised that after seventy years<ref>Jeremiah 25:11, 29:10</ref> Israelites should be restored to their own land,<ref>Jeremiah 29:5,6</ref> and then enjoy the blessings of the Messianic kingdom under the Messianic king,<ref>Jeremiah 28:5,6</ref> this period passed by and things remained as of old.{{sfn|Charles|1911|pp=169-170}} Some {{Who|date=October 2009}} believe that the Messianic kingdom was not necessarily predicted to occur at the end of the seventy years of the Babylonian exile, but at some unspecified time in the future.  The only thing for certain that was predicted was the return of the Jews to their land, which occurred when [[Cyrus the Persian]] conquered Babylon in circa 539 BC. Thus, the fulfillment of the Messianic kingdom remained in the future for the Jews.\n\n[[Book of Haggai|Haggai]] and Zechariah explained the delay by the failure of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] to rebuild the temple, and so hope of the kingdom persisted, until in the first half of the 2nd century the delay is explained in the Books of Daniel and [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]] as due not to man's shortcomings but to the counsels of God.{{sfn|Charles|1911|p=170}} Regarding the 70 years of exile predicted in Jeremiah 29:10, the Jews were first exiled in 605&nbsp;BC in the reign of king [[Jehoiakim]] and were allowed to return to their land in c. 536&nbsp;BC when [[Cyrus the Great|King Cyrus]] conquered Babylon. This period was approximately 70 years, as prophesied by Jeremiah.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} But some people{{Who|date=October 2016}} believe that the 70 years of Jeremiah were later interpreted by the angel in Daniel 9 as 70 weeks of years, of which 69\u00bd have already expired, while Enoch 85 interprets the 70 years of Jeremiah as the 70 successive reigns of the 70 angelic patrons of the nations, which are to come to a close in his own generation.{{sfn|Charles|1911|p=170}} The Book of Enoch, however, was not considered inspired Scripture by the Jews, so that any failed prophecy in it is of no consequence to the Jewish faith.\n\nThe Greek empire of the East was overthrown by Rome, and prompted a new interpretation of Daniel. The [[Four empires|fourth and last empire]] was declared to be Roman by the [[Book of Baruch|Apocalypse of Baruch]]{{sfn|Charles|1911|p=170}} chapters 36\u201340 and [[4 Ezra]] 10:60\u201312:35. Again, these two books were not considered inspired Scripture by the Jews, and thus were not authoritative on matters of prophecy. In addition, earlier in Daniel chapter 7 and also in chapter 2, the fourth and final world empire is considered to be Rome since Babylon, Medo-Persia ([[Achaemenid Empire]]), Greece, and Rome were world empires which all clearly arrived in succession. Thus, it might be interpreted{{By whom|date=October 2016}} that Daniel was saying  that Rome would be the last world power before the kingdom of God.\n\nSuch ideas as those of \"the day of Yahweh\" and the \"new heavens and a new earth\" were re-interpreted by the Jewish people with fresh nuances in conformity with their new settings. Thus the inner development of Jewish apocalyptic was conditioned by the historical experiences of the nation.{{sfn|Charles|1911|p=170}} But the prophecies found in Jewish scriptures, which have not changed over time, await their fulfillment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n===Traditions===\nAnother source of apocalyptic thought was primitive mythological and cosmological traditions, in which the eye of the seer could see the secrets of the future. Thus the six days of the world's creation, followed by a seventh of rest, were regarded as at once a history of the past and a forecasting of the future. As the world was made in six days its history would be accomplished in six thousand years, since each day with God was as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day; and as the six days of creation were followed by one of rest, so the six thousand years of the world's history would be followed by a rest of a thousand years.<ref>2 Enoch 32:2\u201333:2</ref>{{sfn|Charles|1911|p=170}}\n\n==Object and contents==\nThe object of this literature in general was to square the righteousness of God with the suffering condition of His righteous servants on earth.  Early [[Old Testament]] prophecy taught the need of personal and national righteousness, and foretold the ultimate blessedness of the righteous nation on the present earth. Its views were not systematic and comprehensive in regard to the nations in general. Regarding the individual, it held that God\u2019s service here was its own and adequate reward, and saw no need of postulating another world to set right the evils of this one.\n\nBut later, with the growing claims of the individual and the acknowledgment of these in the religious and intellectual life, both problems, and especially the latter, pressed themselves irresistibly on the notice of religious thinkers, and made it impossible for any conception of the divine rule and righteousness to gain acceptance, which did not render adequate satisfaction to the claims of both problems. To render such satisfaction was the task undertaken by apocalyptic, as well as to vindicate the righteousness of God alike in respect of the individual and of the nation. Later prophecy incorporated an idea of future vindication of present evils, often including the idea of an afterlife.\n\nApocalyptic prophets sketched in outline the history of the world and mankind, the origin of evil and its course, and the final consummation of all things. The righteous as a nation should yet possess the earth, either via an eternal Messianic kingdom on earth, or else in temporary blessedness here and eternal blessedness hereafter. Though the individual might perish amid the disorders of this world, apocalyptic prophets taught that the righteous person would not fail to attain through resurrection the recompense that was due in the Messianic kingdom or, alternatively, in heaven itself.{{sfn|Charles|1911|p=170}}\n\n==Comparison to prophecy==\n{{original research|section|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Message===\nSome may distinguish between the messages of the prophets and the messages of proto-apocalyptic and apocalyptic literature by saying that the message of the prophets was primarily a preaching of repentance and righteousness needed for the nation to escape judgment; the message of the apocalyptic writers was of patience and trust for that deliverance and reward were sure to come.{{sfn|Charles|1911|p=170}} Neither the prophets nor the apocalyptic authors are without conflict between their messages, however, and there are significant similarities between prophecy and apocalyptic writings.\n\nApocalyptic literature shares with prophecy revelation through the use of visions and dreams, and these often combine reality and fantasy. In both cases, a heavenly interpreter is often provided to the receiver so that he may understand the many complexities of what he has seen. The oracles in Amos, Hosea, First Isaiah, and Jeremiah give a clear sense of how messages of imminent punishment develop into the later proto-apocalyptic literature, and eventually into the thoroughly apocalyptic literature of Daniel 7\u201312. The fully apocalyptic visions in Daniel 7\u201312, as well as those in the New Testament\u2019s Revelation, can trace their roots to the pre-exilic latter biblical prophets; the sixth century BCE prophets Ezekiel, Isaiah 40\u201355 and 56\u201366, Haggai 2, and Zechariah 1\u20138 show a transition phase between prophecy and apocalyptic literature.<ref>Coogan p.354</ref>\n\n===Dualistic theology===\nProphecy believes that this world is God's world and that in this world His goodness and truth will yet be vindicated. Hence the prophet prophesies of a definite future arising out of and organically connected with the present. The apocalyptic writer despairs of the present and directs his hopes to the future, to a new world standing in essential opposition to the present.<ref>[[4 Ezra]] 7:50</ref> This becomes a dualistic principle, which, though it can largely be accounted for by the interaction of certain inner tendencies and outward sorrowful experience on the part of Judaism, may ultimately be derived from [[Ahura Mazda|Mazdean]] influences. This principle, which shows itself in the conception that the various nations are under angelic rulers, who are in a greater or less degree in rebellion against God, as in Daniel and Enoch, grows in strength with each succeeding age, till at last [[Satan]] is conceived as \"the ruler of this world\"<ref>John 12:31</ref> or \"the god of this age.\"<ref>2 Corinthians 4:4</ref>{{sfn|Charles|1911|pp=170-171}}\n\n===Conception of history===\nApocalyptic writing took a wider view of the world's history than did prophecy. Whereas prophecy had to deal with governments of other nations, apocalyptic writings arose at a time when Israel had been subject for generations to the sway of one or other of the great world-powers. Hence to harmonize Israel's difficulties with belief in God's righteousness, apocalyptic writing had to encompass such events in the counsels of God, the rise, duration and the downfall of each empire in turn, until, finally the lordship of the world passed into the hands of Israel, or the final judgment arrived. These events belonged in the main to the past, but the writer represented them as still in the future, arranged under certain artificial categories of time definitely determined from the beginning in the counsels of God and revealed by Him to His servants, the prophets. [[Determinism]] thus became a leading characteristic of Jewish apocalyptic, and its conception of history became mechanical.{{sfn|Charles|1911|p=171}}\n\n==Hebrew Bible==\n{{Jewish mysticism}}\n\n===Characteristics===\nThe [[revelation]]s from heavenly messengers, about the end times, came in the form of angels, or from people who have been taken up to heaven and are returned to earth with messages. The descriptions not only tell of the end times, but also describe both past and present events and their significance, often in heavily coded language. When speaking of the end times, apocalyptic literature generally included chronologies of events that will occur and frequently places them in the near future, which gives a sense of urgency to the prophet\u2019s broader message. Though the understanding of the present is bleak, the visions of the future are far more positive, and include divinely delivered victory and a complete reformation of absolutely everything. Many visions of these end times mirror creation mythologies, invoke the triumph of God over the primordial forces of chaos, and provide clear distinctions between light and dark, [[good and evil]]. In such revelations, humankind is typically divided into a small group that experiences salvation, while the wicked majority is destroyed. Since the apocalyptic genre developed during the [[Yehud Medinata|Persian period]], this [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] may have developed under the influence of [[Persian thought]].<ref name=\"oyc\">{{cite web |first=Christine |last=Hayes |authorlink=Christine Hayes |year=2006 |url=http://oyc.yale.edu/religious-studies/rlst-145/lecture-23 |website=[[Open Yale Courses]] |publisher=[[Yale University]] |title=Introduction to the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) \u2014 Lecture 23 \u2014 Visions of the End: Daniel and Apocalyptic Literature}}</ref> The imagery in apocalyptic literature is not realistic or reflective of the physical world as it was, but is rather surreal and fantastic, invoking a sense of wonder at the complete newness of the new order to come.<ref>Coogan p.353</ref>\n\n===Canonical===\n\n====Proto-apocalyptic====\n* [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 24\u201327; 33; 34\u201335 \n* [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 33:14\u201326\n* [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]]  38\u201339\n* [[Book of Joel|Joel]] 3:9\u201317\n* [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 12\u201314\n\n====Apocalyptic====\n* [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 7\u201312\n\nSome are possibly falsely attributed works ([[pseudepigraphic]]) except for the passages from Ezekiel and Joel.

Formed in 1952, it has 87 representatives from [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]] as well as from the autonomous areas of the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]], and the [[\u00c5land Islands]]. The representatives are members of parliament in their respective countries or areas and are elected by those parliaments. The Council holds ordinary sessions each year in October/November and usually one extra session per year with a specific theme.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council|title=The Nordic Council|website=Nordic cooperation}}</ref> The Council's official languages are [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], though it uses only Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish as its [[working language]]s.<ref name=\"languages\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.norden.org/en/information/nordic-languages|title=The Nordic languages|website=Nordic cooperation|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref> These three comprise the first language of around 80% of the region's population and are learned as a second or foreign language by the remaining 20%.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.norden.org/en/fakta-om-norden-1/language|title=Language|date=6 August 2008|access-date=1 June 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, the [[Nordic Council of Ministers]], an [[intergovernmental organisation|intergovernmental]] forum, was established to complement the Council. The Council and the Council of Ministers are involved in various forms of cooperation with neighbouring areas, amongst them being the [[Baltic Assembly]] and the [[Benelux]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.err.ee/603573/ratas-meets-with-benelux-nordic-baltic-leaders-in-the-hague|title=Ratas meets with Benelux, Nordic, Baltic leaders in the Hague|last=ERR|date=22 June 2017|work=ERR|access-date=1 June 2018|language=en}}</ref> as well as [[Russia]]<ref name=\"Tobias Etzold 2015\">Tobias Etzold, \"Nordic Institutionalized Cooperation in a Larger Regional Setting,\" in Johan Strang (ed.), ''Nordic Cooperation: A European Region in Transition'', pp. 148ff, Routledge, 2015, {{ISBN|9781317626954}}</ref> and [[Schleswig-Holstein]].<ref name=\"Offices outside the Nordic Region\">[http://www.norden.org/en/om-samarbejdet-1/organisations-and-institutions/offices-outside-the-nordic-region Offices outside the Nordic Region].

Following the war, the [[Nordic countries]] pursued the idea of a [[Scandinavian defence union]] to ensure their mutual defence. However, Finland, due to its [[Paasikivi\u2013Kekkonen doctrine|Paasikivi-Kekkonen policy of neutrality]] and [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|FCMA treaty]] with the USSR, could not participate.\n\nIt was proposed that the Nordic countries would unify their foreign policy and defence, remain neutral in the event of a conflict and not ally with [[NATO]], which some were planning at the time. The [[United States]], keen on getting access to bases in Scandinavia and believing the Nordic countries incapable of defending themselves, stated it would not ensure military support for Scandinavia if they did not join NATO. As Denmark and Norway sought US aid for their post-war reconstruction, the project collapsed, with Denmark, Norway and Iceland joining NATO.<ref>[http://www.ena.lu/plan_scandinavian_defence_union-2-6834 The plan for a Scandinavian Defence Union], [[European Navigator]]. \u00c9tienne Deschamps. Translated by the CVCE.</ref>\n\nFurther Nordic co-operation, such as an economic customs union, also failed. This led [[Danish Prime Minister]] [[Hans Hedtoft]] to propose, in 1951, a consultative inter-parliamentary body. This proposal was agreed by Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden in 1952.<ref name=\"H1\">[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/the-history-of-the-nordic-council/before-1952 Before 1952], Nordic Council</ref> The Council's first session was held in the Danish Parliament on 13 February 1953 and it elected Hans Hedtoft as its president. When Finnish-Soviet relations thawed following the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], Finland joined the council in 1955.<ref name=\"H2\">[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/the-history-of-the-nordic-council/1953-1971 1953\u20131971 Finland joins in and the first Nordic rights are formulated.], Nordic Council</ref>\n\nOn 2 July 1954, the Nordic labour market was created and in 1958, building upon a 1952 passport-free travel area, the [[Nordic Passport Union]] was created. These two measures helped ensure Nordic citizens' free movement around the area. A Nordic Convention on Social Security was implemented in 1955. There were also plans for a [[single market]] but they were abandoned in 1959 shortly before Denmark, Norway, and Sweden joined the [[European Free Trade Area]] (EFTA). Finland became an associated member of EFTA in 1961 and Denmark and Norway applied to join the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC).<ref name=\"H2\"/>\n\nThis move towards the EEC led to desire for a formal Nordic treaty. The Treaty of Helsinki outlined the workings of the Council and came into force on 24 March 1962. Further advancements on Nordic cooperation were made in the following years: a Nordic School of Public Health, a Nordic Cultural Fund, and Nordic House in [[Reykjav\u00edk]] were created. Danish Prime Minister [[Hilmar Baunsgaard]] proposed full economic cooperation (\"[[Nordek]]\") in 1968. Nordek was agreed in 1970, but Finland then backtracked, stating that its ties with the Soviet Union meant it could not form close economic ties with potential members of the EEC (Denmark and Norway).<ref name=\"H2\"/> Nordek was then abandoned.\n\nAs a consequence, Denmark and Norway applied to join the EEC and the Nordic Council of Ministers was set up in 1971 to ensure continued Nordic cooperation.<ref name=\"HM1\">[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/the-period-up-to-1971 The period up to 1971] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120111240/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/the-period-up-to-1971 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers</ref> In 1970 representatives of the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[\u00c5land Islands|\u00c5land]] were allowed to take part in the Nordic Council as part of the Danish and Finnish delegations.<ref name=\"H2\"/> Norway turned down EEC membership in 1972 while Denmark acted as a bridge builder between the EEC and the Nordics.<ref name=\"HM2\">[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/197220131989 1972\u20131989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120111152/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/197220131989 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers</ref> Also in 1973, although it did not opt for full membership of the EEC, Finland negotiated a free trade treaty with the EEC that in practice removed customs duties from 1977 on, although there were transition periods up to 1985 for some products. Sweden did not apply due to its non-alliance policy, which was aimed at preserving neutrality. Greenland subsequently left the EEC and has since sought a more active role in [[Arctic cooperation and politics|circumpolar]] affairs.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Nordic Council founded the [[Nordic Industrial Fund]], Nordtest and the [[Nordic Investment Bank]]. The Council's remit was also expanded to include environmental protection and, in order to clean up the pollution in the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]], a joint energy network was established. The Nordic Science Policy Council was set up in 1983<ref name=\"HM2\"/> and, in 1984, representatives from Greenland were allowed to join the Danish delegation.<ref name=\"H2\"/>\n\nFollowing the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the Nordic Council began to cooperate more with the [[Baltic states]] and new Baltic Sea organisations. Sweden and Finland joined the [[European Union]] (EU), the EEC's successor, in 1995.

The Nordic Passport Union was also subsumed into the EU's [[Schengen Area]] in 1996.\n\nThe Nordic Council became more outward-looking, to the [[Arctic]], Baltic, Europe, and [[Canada]]. The [[\u00d8resund Bridge]] linking Sweden and Denmark led to a large amount of cross-border travel, which in turn led to further efforts to reduce barriers.<ref name=\"HM3\"/> However, the initially envisioned tasks and functions of the Nordic Council have become partially dormant due to the significant overlap with the EU and EEA.

Formed in 1952, it has 87 representatives from [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]] as well as from the autonomous areas of the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]], and the [[\u00c5land Islands]]. The representatives are members of parliament in their respective countries or areas and are elected by those parliaments. The Council holds ordinary sessions each year in October/November and usually one extra session per year with a specific theme.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council|title=The Nordic Council|website=Nordic cooperation}}</ref> The Council's official languages are [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], though it uses only Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish as its [[working language]]s.<ref name=\"languages\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.norden.org/en/information/nordic-languages|title=The Nordic languages|website=Nordic cooperation|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref> These three comprise the first language of around 80% of the region's population and are learned as a second or foreign language by the remaining 20%.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.norden.org/en/fakta-om-norden-1/language|title=Language|date=6 August 2008|access-date=1 June 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, the Nordic Council of Ministers, an [[intergovernmental organisation|intergovernmental]] forum, was established to complement the Council. The Council and the Council of Ministers are involved in various forms of cooperation with neighbouring areas, amongst them being the [[Baltic Assembly]] and the [[Benelux]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.err.ee/603573/ratas-meets-with-benelux-nordic-baltic-leaders-in-the-hague|title=Ratas meets with Benelux, Nordic, Baltic leaders in the Hague|last=ERR|date=22 June 2017|work=ERR|access-date=1 June 2018|language=en}}</ref> as well as [[Russia]]<ref name=\"Tobias Etzold 2015\">Tobias Etzold, \"Nordic Institutionalized Cooperation in a Larger Regional Setting,\" in Johan Strang (ed.), ''Nordic Cooperation: A European Region in Transition'', pp. 148ff, Routledge, 2015, {{ISBN|9781317626954}}</ref> and [[Schleswig-Holstein]].<ref name=\"Offices outside the Nordic Region\">[http://www.norden.org/en/om-samarbejdet-1/organisations-and-institutions/offices-outside-the-nordic-region Offices outside the Nordic Region].

Following the war, the [[Nordic countries]] pursued the idea of a [[Scandinavian defence union]] to ensure their mutual defence. However, Finland, due to its [[Paasikivi\u2013Kekkonen doctrine|Paasikivi-Kekkonen policy of neutrality]] and [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|FCMA treaty]] with the USSR, could not participate.\n\nIt was proposed that the Nordic countries would unify their foreign policy and defence, remain neutral in the event of a conflict and not ally with [[NATO]], which some were planning at the time. The [[United States]], keen on getting access to bases in Scandinavia and believing the Nordic countries incapable of defending themselves, stated it would not ensure military support for Scandinavia if they did not join NATO. As Denmark and Norway sought US aid for their post-war reconstruction, the project collapsed, with Denmark, Norway and Iceland joining NATO.<ref>[http://www.ena.lu/plan_scandinavian_defence_union-2-6834 The plan for a Scandinavian Defence Union], [[European Navigator]]. \u00c9tienne Deschamps. Translated by the CVCE.</ref>\n\nFurther Nordic co-operation, such as an economic customs union, also failed. This led [[Danish Prime Minister]] [[Hans Hedtoft]] to propose, in 1951, a consultative inter-parliamentary body. This proposal was agreed by Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden in 1952.<ref name=\"H1\">[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/the-history-of-the-nordic-council/before-1952 Before 1952], Nordic Council</ref> The Council's first session was held in the Danish Parliament on 13 February 1953 and it elected Hans Hedtoft as its president. When Finnish-Soviet relations thawed following the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], Finland joined the council in 1955.<ref name=\"H2\">[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/the-history-of-the-nordic-council/1953-1971 1953\u20131971 Finland joins in and the first Nordic rights are formulated.], Nordic Council</ref>\n\nOn 2 July 1954, the Nordic labour market was created and in 1958, building upon a 1952 passport-free travel area, the [[Nordic Passport Union]] was created. These two measures helped ensure Nordic citizens' free movement around the area. A Nordic Convention on Social Security was implemented in 1955. There were also plans for a [[single market]] but they were abandoned in 1959 shortly before Denmark, Norway, and Sweden joined the [[European Free Trade Area]] (EFTA). Finland became an associated member of EFTA in 1961 and Denmark and Norway applied to join the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC).<ref name=\"H2\"/>\n\nThis move towards the EEC led to desire for a formal Nordic treaty. The Treaty of Helsinki outlined the workings of the Council and came into force on 24 March 1962. Further advancements on Nordic cooperation were made in the following years: a Nordic School of Public Health, a Nordic Cultural Fund, and Nordic House in [[Reykjav\u00edk]] were created. Danish Prime Minister [[Hilmar Baunsgaard]] proposed full economic cooperation (\"[[Nordek]]\") in 1968. Nordek was agreed in 1970, but Finland then backtracked, stating that its ties with the Soviet Union meant it could not form close economic ties with potential members of the EEC (Denmark and Norway).<ref name=\"H2\"/> Nordek was then abandoned.\n\nAs a consequence, Denmark and Norway applied to join the EEC and the Nordic Council of Ministers was set up in 1971 to ensure continued Nordic cooperation.<ref name=\"HM1\">[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/the-period-up-to-1971 The period up to 1971] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120111240/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/the-period-up-to-1971 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers</ref> In 1970 representatives of the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[\u00c5land Islands|\u00c5land]] were allowed to take part in the Nordic Council as part of the Danish and Finnish delegations.<ref name=\"H2\"/> Norway turned down EEC membership in 1972 while Denmark acted as a bridge builder between the EEC and the Nordics.<ref name=\"HM2\">[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/197220131989 1972\u20131989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120111152/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/197220131989 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers</ref> Also in 1973, although it did not opt for full membership of the EEC, Finland negotiated a free trade treaty with the EEC that in practice removed customs duties from 1977 on, although there were transition periods up to 1985 for some products. Sweden did not apply due to its non-alliance policy, which was aimed at preserving neutrality. Greenland subsequently left the EEC and has since sought a more active role in [[Arctic cooperation and politics|circumpolar]] affairs.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Nordic Council founded the [[Nordic Industrial Fund]], Nordtest and the [[Nordic Investment Bank]]. The Council's remit was also expanded to include environmental protection and, in order to clean up the pollution in the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]], a joint energy network was established.

[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers The ''Nordic Council of Ministers''], founded in 1971, is responsible for inter-governmental cooperation.

As sessions are open to the public, anyone may be present and \"observe\" the proceedings, but that doesn't make them \"observer members\" in a formal sense, like at the UN, where observer status gives many formal rights.
