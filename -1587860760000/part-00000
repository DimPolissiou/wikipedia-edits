Being selfish and not caring about others, that person said she was proud of her for making peoples' lives worse in such a way which shows she sucks.\n\n'''Compulsory figures''' or '''school figures''' were formerly a segment of [[figure skating]], and gave the sport its name. They are the \"circular patterns which skaters trace on the ice to demonstrate skill in placing clean turns evenly on round circles\".<ref name=\"specialregs-1\" /> For approximately the first 50 years of figure skating as a sport, until 1947, compulsory figures made up 60 percent of the total score at most competitions around the world. These figures continued to dominate the sport, although they steadily declined in importance, until the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) voted to discontinue them as a part of competitions in 1990. Learning and training in compulsory figures instilled discipline and control; some in the figure skating community considered them necessary to teach skaters basic skills. Skaters would train for hours to learn and execute them well, and competing and judging figures would often take up to eight hours during competitions.\n\nSkaters traced compulsory figures, and were judged according to their smoothness and accuracy. The circle is the basis of all figures. Other elements in compulsory figures include curves, change of foot, change of [[Glossary of figure skating terms#E|edge]], and turns. Skaters had to trace precise circles while completing difficult turns and edges. The simple \"figure eight\" shape was executed by connecting two circles; other figures included the [[3 turn|three turn]], the [[counter turn]], the [[rocker turn]], the [[bracket turn]], and the loop.\n\nAlthough few skaters continue to practice compulsory figures, and few coaches still teach them to skaters, some skaters and coaches believe compulsory figures give skaters an advantage in developing alignment, core strength, body control, and discipline. The World Figure Sport Society has conducted festivals and competitions of compulsory figures, endorsed by the [[Ice Skating Institute]], since 2015.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nTracing figures in the ice is the oldest form of figure skating, especially during its first 200 years of existence, when it was a recreational activity practiced mostly by men.  Combined skating, or \"the sophisticated tracing of geometric figures by groups of skaters\", dominated the sport for almost 50 years in England.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 4\u20135</ref>  ''The Art of Skating'', one of the earliest books about figure skating, was written by Robert Jones in 1772 and described five advanced figures, three of which were illustrated with large color plates.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 25\u201325</ref>  Jones' limited body of figures, which emphasized correct technique, were the accepted and basic repertoire of figures in 18th century England.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 27, 62</ref>  The [[Edinburgh Skating Club]], one of the oldest skating clubs in the world, described combined figures and those done by multiple skaters; interlocking figure eights were the most important.<ref>Hines, p. 27</ref>  According to writer Ellyn Kestnbaum, the Edinburgh Skating Club required prospective members to pass proficiency tests in what became compulsory figures.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 58</ref> The London Skating Club, founded in 1830 in London, also required proficiency tests for members and pioneered combined skating, which contributed to the evolution of school figures.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 60</ref>  Artistic skating in France, which was derived from the English style of figure skating and was influenced by [[ballet]], developed figures that emphasized artistry, body position, and grace of execution. Jean Garcin, a member of an elite group of skaters in France, wrote a book about figure skating in 1813 that included descriptions and illustrations of over 30 figures, including a series of circle-eight figures that skaters still use today.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 62\u201364</ref>\n\nGeorge Anderson, writing in 1852, described backward-skating figures, including the flying Mercury and the shamrock, as well as the Q figure, which became, in its various forms, an important part of the repertoire of skating movements for the rest of the 1800s.  Anderson also described two combined figures, the salutation (already described by Jones) and the satellite.  By the 1850s, the most important figures (eights, threes, and Qs) were developed, and formed the basis for figure skating at the time.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 30\u201331</ref>  In 1869, Henry Vandervell and T. Maxwell Witham from the London Skating Club wrote ''System of Figure Skating'', which described variations of the three turn (the only figure known before 1860), the bracket (first done on roller skates), the rocker, the Mohawk, the loop, the Q, and other figures.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 31, 32\u201334</ref>  The Mohawk, a two-foot turn on the same circle, most likely originated in North America.<ref name=\"hines-34\">Hines (2006), p. 34</ref>  Figure skating historian James Hines called grapevines, which was probably invented in Canada, \"the most American of all figures\".<ref>Hines (2006), p. 59</ref>  The Viennese style of figure skating, as described by Max Wirth's book in 1881, described connecting figures, which ultimately led to modern free skating programs.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 67</ref>\n\nIn 1868, the American Skating Congress, precursor to [[U.S. Figure Skating]], adopted a series of movements used during competitions between skaters from the U.S. and Canada. Until 1947, for approximately the first 50 years of the existence of figure skating as a sport, compulsory figures made up 60 percent of the total score at most competitions around the world.<ref name=\"loosemore\">{{cite news |last1=Loosemore |first1=Sandra |title='Figures' don't add up in competition anymore |url=http://cbs.sportsline.com/u/women/skating/dec98/loosemore121698.htm |accessdate=16 November 2019 |work=CBS SportsLine |date=16 December 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727021537/http://cbs.sportsline.com/u/women/skating/dec98/loosemore121698.htm |archive-date=2008-07-27 }}</ref>  Other competitions held in the late 19th and early 20th centuries included [[special figures]], freeskating, and compulsories, most of the points they earned going towards how they performed the same set of compulsory moves.<ref>Kestnbaum, pp. 81\u201382</ref> The first international figure skating competition was in Vienna in 1882;<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=https://www.isu.org/isu-history |publisher=International Skating Union |accessdate=16 November 2019}}</ref><ref>Hines (2011), p. xx</ref> according to Kestnbaum, it established a precedent for future competitions.<ref name=\"cultureonice-67\"/> Skaters were required to perform 23 compulsory figures, as well as a four-minute freeskating program, and a section called \"special figures\", in which they had to perform moves or combinations of moves that highlighted their advanced skills.<ref name=\"cultureonice-67\">Kestnbaum, p. 67</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C0110-0014-001, Gabriele Seyfert, Ralph Borghardt.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ralph Borghardt]] and [[Gabriele Seyfert]] examine the print of a loop figure at the 1964 [[East German Figure Skating Championships|East German Championships]].|alt=Man on the left and woman on the right crouching on a piece of ice on a rink, the man tracing a figure on the ice with his thumb]]\n\nCompulsory figures were an important part of figure skating for the rest of the 19th century until the 1930s and 1940s. The first [[1891 European Figure Skating Championships|European Championships in 1891]] consisted of only compulsory figures.<ref>Hines (2011), p. 12</ref> In 1896, the newly formed [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) sponsored the [[1896 World Figure Skating Championships|first annual World Figure Skating Championships]] in St. Petersburg. The competition consisted of compulsory figures and freeskating.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 68</ref> Skaters had to perform six compulsory moves, or figures, so that judges could compare skaters according to an established standard. Compulsory figures were worth 60 percent of the competitors' total scores. Special figures were not included in World Championships, although they were included as a separate discipline in other competitions, including the [[1908 Summer Olympics|Olympics in 1908]].<ref name=\"cultureonice-82\"/>\n\nIn 1897, the ISU adopted a schedule of 41 school figures, each of increasing difficulty, which were proposed by the British. They remained the standard compulsory figures used throughout the world in proficiency testing and competitions until 1990, and U.S. Figure Skating continued to use them as a separate discipline in the 1990s. After [[World War II]], more countries were sending skaters to international competitions, so the ISU cut the numbers of figures to a maximum of six due to the extended time it took to judge them all.<ref name=\"cultureonice-82\"/><ref name=\"loosemore\"/>\n\n===Demise===\nCompulsory figures began to be progressively devalued in 1967, when the values of both compulsory figures and free skating were changed to 50 percent.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 197</ref> In 1973, the number of figures was decreased from six to three, and their overall weight was decreased to 30 percent, to make room for the introduction of the [[Short program (figure skating)|short program]].<ref name=\"loosemore\"/><ref name=\"nomorefigures\"/>  Hines stated that the decrease in the importance of compulsory figures was due to \"the unbalanced skating\"<ref name=\"hines2006-204\">Hines, (2006), p. 204</ref> of women skaters such as [[Trixi Schuba|Beatrix \"Trixi\" Schuba]] of Austria, who Hines called \"the last great practitioner of compulsory figures\".<ref name=\"hines2006-204\"/>  Schuba won several medals in the late 1960s and early 1970s based upon the strength of her figures, despite her lower results in free skating.  As Hines stated, \"she could not be defeated under a scoring system that gave preference to figures\".<ref name=\"hines2006-204\"/>  Hines also credited television coverage of figure skating, which helped to increase popularity of the sport, with the eventual demise of compulsory figures.  Television audiences were not exposed to the compulsory figures segments of competitions, so they did not understand why results contradicted what they saw in free skating segments.<ref name=\"hines2006-205\">Hines (2006), p. 205</ref>  Sports writer Sandra Loosemore agreed, stating that television was \"the driving force\"<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> for the rule changes regarding figures in 1968 and the years following. Figures were not broadcast on television because they were not exciting enough, so viewers \"found it incomprehensible that competitions could be won by skaters who had built up huge leads in the figures portion of the event but gave mediocre performances in the part of the competition shown on TV\".<ref name=\"loosemore\"/>  In 1973, the ISU lowered the value of compulsory figures from 50% to 40% and decreased the number of figures skaters were required to perform.  In 1977, the number of the list of figures skaters could chose to perform decreased even more, down to six figures per competition.<ref name=\"hines2006-205\"/>\n\nLoosemore attributed the decrease in the importance of figures to a \"lack of public accountability\"<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> from the judges of international competitions and other discrepancies in judging, which Loosemore called \"dirty judging\".<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> She speculated that television coverage of the sport, which brought more attention to how it was judged, was also responsible and \"since figures competitions weren't televised, fans could not be certain that the judges were on the level\".<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> Loosemore also speculated that \"the relative scarcity of rinks and practice ice for figures in Europe as compared to North America\"<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> ultimately made the difference in the removal of figures from competitions. Kestnbaum agreed, stating that the elimination of figures was motivated by finances, countries with an affluent middle class or government-supported training for athletes having more of a competitive advantage over less affluent and smaller countries with fewer ice rinks and resources to spend the time necessary to train for proficiency in figures. By the late 1970s and into the 1980s, there were discussions about eliminating them from international competitions.<ref name=\"cultureonice-86\">Kestnbaum, p. 86</ref>\n\nIn 1988, the ISU voted to remove compulsory figures from international single skating competitions, for both men and women, starting in the 1990\u20131991 season. Of 31 voting national associations, only the U.S., Canada, Britain, and New Zealand voted against the decision.<ref name=\"nomorefigures\">{{cite news |title=No More Figures in Figure Skating |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/09/sports/no-more-figures-in-figure-skating.html?pagewanted=print |accessdate=16 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |agency=Associated Press |date=9 June 1988 |page=D00025}}</ref> The last two seasons that compulsory figures were competed at an international competition were in 1989 and 1990; only two figures were skated and they were worth only 20 percent of the competitors' overall scores.<ref name=\"loosemore\"/><ref name=\"cultureonice-86\"/>  [[\u017deljka \u010ci\u017eme\u0161ija]] from Yugoslavia skated the last compulsory figure in international competition, at the [[1990 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], on March 7, 1990.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 235</ref>\n\nCompulsory figures have not been a part of any international or most national competitions since 1990.

The slightest misalignment or shift of body weight could cause errors in the execution of figures.<ref name=\"sausa\"/> American figure skating champion [[Irving Brokaw]] insisted that form was more essential to the production of figures than the tracings themselves because the skater needed to find a comfortable and natural position in which to perform them.<ref name=\"artofskating-19\"/> He expected skaters to trace figures without looking down at them because it gave \"a very slovenly appearance\",<ref name=\"artofskating-19\">Brokaw, p. 19</ref> and recommended that they not use their arms excessively or for balance like tightrope walkers. Brokaw wanted skaters to remain upright and avoid bending over as much as they could. Brokaw also thought that the unemployed leg, which he called the \"balance leg\", was as important as the tracing leg because it was used as much in the execution of a figure as the tracing leg. The balance leg also should be bent only slightly, since he believed bending it too much removed its usefulness and appeared clumsy.<ref>Brokaw, pp. 19\u201320</ref>\n\n[[File:Irving Brokaw skater.jpg|thumb|left|American Olympic figure skater [[Irving Brokaw]], who wrote one of the earliest books about figure skating and compulsory figures, ''The Art of Skating'' (1915)|alt=Man in his 30s, wearing dark trousers and coat, skating on an outdoor rink, facing to the right and looking downward towards the ice]]\n\nWriter Ellyn Kestnbaum noted that skaters who were adept at performing compulsory figures had to practice for hours to have precise body control and to become \"intimately familiar with how subtle shifts in the body's balance over the blade affected the tracings left on the ice\".<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 73</ref> She added that many skaters found figures and their visible results calming and rewarding.<ref name=\"cultureonice-84\">Kestnbaum, p. 84</ref> Sports writer Christie Sausa insisted that training in figures \"helps create better skaters and instills discipline, and can be practiced over a lifetime by skaters of all ages and abilities\".<ref name=\"sausa\"/>  The German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' declared in 1983 that compulsory figures stifled skaters' creativity because not much about figures had changed in 100 years of competitions.<ref name=\"spiegel\"/>\n\n===Figure elements===\n\nAll compulsory figures had the following: circles, curves, change of foot, change of [[Glossary of figure skating terms#E|edge]], and turns. The circle, the basis of all figures, was performed on both its long and short [[Radical axis|axes]]. Skaters had to trace precise circles, while completing difficult turns and edges.<ref name=\"sausa\"/><ref name=\"specialregs-2\">Special Regs, p. 2</ref> Most figures \"employ specific one-foot turns not done in combination with other one-foot turns\".<ref name=\"hines2006-99\"/>  Each figure consisted of two or three tangent circles. Each circle's [[diameter]] had to be about three times the skater's height, and the [[radii]] of all half-circles and circles had to be approximately the same length. Half-circles and circles had to begin and end as near as possible to the point in which the long and short axes intersected. The figure's long axis divided it longitudinally into equal-sized halves, and the figure's short axes divided the figures into equal-sized lobes.<ref name=\"specialregs-2\"/>\n\nCurves, which are parts of circles, had to be performed with an uninterrupted tracing and with a single clean edge, with no subcurves or wobbles.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\">Special Regs, p. 3</ref> Brokaw insisted that curves had to be done on all four edges of the skate, as well as on the inside and outside edges while skating both backwards and forwards.<ref name=\"artofskating-23\">Brokaw, p. 23</ref> He stated, \"It is the control of these circles that gives strength and power, and the holding of the body in the proper and graceful attitudes, while it is the execution of these large circles, changes of edges, threes and double-threes, brackets, loops, rockers and counters, which makes up the art of skating\".<ref name=\"artofskating-23\"/> Curves also included the forced turn (or [[Bracket turn|bracket]]) and the serpentine.<ref name=\"artofskating-23\"/>\n\nA change of foot, which happened during the short time the skater transferred weight from one foot to the other, was allowed in the execution of figures, but had to be done in a symmetrical zone of each side of the long axis. Skaters could choose the exact point in which they placed their foot in this zone, although it typically was just after the long axis, with the full weight of the body on the skate. It was at this point when the tracing began.<ref name=\"specialregs-2\"/> A change of edge happened at the point in which the long and short axes intersected. Its trace had to be continuously and symmetrically traced and could not be S-shaped. The edge change had to be as short as possible, and could not be longer than the length of the skate blade. Turns were skated with a single clean edge up to and after the turn, but with no double tracings, no skids or scrapes, or no illegal edge change either before, during, or after a turn. The turns' cusps had to be the same size, and the entry into and out of a turn had to be symmetrical.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\"/>\n\nThe simple \"figure eight\" shape was executed by connecting two circles<ref name=\"cultureonice-59\"/> \"about three times the height of the skater with one circle skated on each foot\".<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> The figure eight has four variations: inside edges, outside edges, backward, and forward. A turn added at the halfway point of each circle increased the level of complexity. Other figures included three-lobed figures with a [[counter turn]] or a [[rocker turn]], which were completed at the points where the lobes touched.<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> Counters and rockers had to be executed symmetrically, with no change of edge, with the points of their turns either pointing up or down or lying along the figure's long axis, and could not be beaked or hooked. Brackets, like threes, had to be skated on a circle, its turns' points either pointing up or down or lying along the figure's long axis.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\"/>\n\nSkaters also performed a group of smaller figures called loops.<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> The diameter of the loop's circular shape had to be about the same height of the skater, and they could not have any scrapes or points on the ice. The place in which the skater entered into or exited out of the crossing of both the loop tracing and the center of the loop had to sit on the figure's long axis, where the loop was divided into symmetrical halves. The center of the loop figure to the place in which the skater entered into or exited out of the loop's crossing had to measure five-sixths of the circle's diameter. The loop's length had to be about one-third of the distance from the place in which the skater entered into or exited out of the loop's crossing of the loop tracing to the figure's short axis. The loop's width had to be about two-thirds of its length.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\"/>  The Q figure begins at the tail of the figure, on the skater's outside edge.  It can also begin on any of the four edges, and the direction in which it can be skated can be reversed.  When the circle is skated first, it is called a reverse Q.<ref name=\"hines-34\"/>  Altered forms of the Q figure often do not look like the letter \"q\", but \"simply employ a serpentine line and a three turn\".<ref name=\"hines-34\"/>  United shamrocks, spectacles (shapes that trace the shape of eyeglasses), and united roses are alterations of the basic Q figures.<ref name=\"hines-34\"/>\n\nThere were three types of [[3 turn|three turns]]: the standard three, the double three, and the paragraph double three. The three turn had to be skated on a circle, its turns' points either pointing up or down or lying along the figure's long axis.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\"/><ref name=\"loosemore\"/> For the double three, the points of both threes had to be directed towards the center of each circle, and had to divide the circle into three equal curves. The middle curve had to divide the circles into halves by the figure's long axis.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\"/> The paragraph double three, which was executed at the highest levels of competition, was done by tracing \"two circles with two turns at each circle, all on one foot from one push-off\".<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> The paragraph double three was difficult to accomplish because the shape and placement of the turns had to be perfectly symmetrical, the turns had to be done on a true edge with no scrapes on the ice, and the circles had to be the same size and exactly round.<ref name=\"loosemore\"/>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Figure eight.png|The figure-eight\nFile:Threeturn.GIF|The [[3 turn]]\nFile:Counter.GIF|The [[counter turn]]\nFile:Rocker turn.gif|The [[rocker turn]]\nFile:Bracket.GIF|The [[bracket turn]]\nFile:Loop complusoryfigures.png|The loop\n</gallery>\n\n==Judging==\n\n''Der Spiegel'' compared judging compulsory figures to the work of forensic scientists.<ref name=\"spiegel\">{{cite news |title=Eiskunstlauf: Das Schlimmste |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14020212.html |accessdate=16 November 2019 |work=Der Spiegel |date=7 February 1983 |language=German}}</ref> After the skaters completed tracing figures, the judges scrutinized the circles made, and the process was repeated twice more.

They are the \"circular patterns which skaters trace on the ice to demonstrate skill in placing clean turns evenly on round circles\".<ref name=\"specialregs-1\" /> For approximately the first 50 years of figure skating as a sport, until 1947, compulsory figures made up 60 percent of the total score at most competitions around the world. These figures continued to dominate the sport, although they steadily declined in importance, until the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) voted to discontinue them as a part of competitions in 1990. Learning and training in compulsory figures instilled discipline and control; some in the figure skating community considered them necessary to teach skaters basic skills. Skaters would train for hours to learn and execute them well, and competing and judging figures would often take up to eight hours during competitions.\n\nSkaters traced compulsory figures, and were judged according to their smoothness and accuracy. The circle is the basis of all figures. Other elements in compulsory figures include curves, change of foot, change of [[Glossary of figure skating terms#E|edge]], and turns. Skaters had to trace precise circles while completing difficult turns and edges. The simple \"figure eight\" shape was executed by connecting two circles; other figures included the [[3 turn|three turn]], the [[counter turn]], the [[rocker turn]], the [[bracket turn]], and the loop.\n\nAlthough few skaters continue to practice compulsory figures, and few coaches still teach them to skaters, some skaters and coaches believe compulsory figures give skaters an advantage in developing alignment, core strength, body control, and discipline. The World Figure Sport Society has conducted festivals and competitions of compulsory figures, endorsed by the [[Ice Skating Institute]], since 2015.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nTracing figures in the ice is the oldest form of figure skating, especially during its first 200 years of existence, when it was a recreational activity practiced mostly by men.  Combined skating, or \"the sophisticated tracing of geometric figures by groups of skaters\", dominated the sport for almost 50 years in England.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 4\u20135</ref>  ''The Art of Skating'', one of the earliest books about figure skating, was written by Robert Jones in 1772 and described five advanced figures, three of which were illustrated with large color plates.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 25\u201325</ref>  Jones' limited body of figures, which emphasized correct technique, were the accepted and basic repertoire of figures in 18th century England.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 27, 62</ref>  The [[Edinburgh Skating Club]], one of the oldest skating clubs in the world, described combined figures and those done by multiple skaters; interlocking figure eights were the most important.<ref>Hines, p. 27</ref>  According to writer Ellyn Kestnbaum, the Edinburgh Skating Club required prospective members to pass proficiency tests in what became compulsory figures.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 58</ref> The London Skating Club, founded in 1830 in London, also required proficiency tests for members and pioneered combined skating, which contributed to the evolution of school figures.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 60</ref>  Artistic skating in France, which was derived from the English style of figure skating and was influenced by [[ballet]], developed figures that emphasized artistry, body position, and grace of execution. Jean Garcin, a member of an elite group of skaters in France, wrote a book about figure skating in 1813 that included descriptions and illustrations of over 30 figures, including a series of circle-eight figures that skaters still use today.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 62\u201364</ref>\n\nGeorge Anderson, writing in 1852, described backward-skating figures, including the flying Mercury and the shamrock, as well as the Q figure, which became, in its various forms, an important part of the repertoire of skating movements for the rest of the 1800s.  Anderson also described two combined figures, the salutation (already described by Jones) and the satellite.  By the 1850s, the most important figures (eights, threes, and Qs) were developed, and formed the basis for figure skating at the time.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 30\u201331</ref>  In 1869, Henry Vandervell and T. Maxwell Witham from the London Skating Club wrote ''System of Figure Skating'', which described variations of the three turn (the only figure known before 1860), the bracket (first done on roller skates), the rocker, the Mohawk, the loop, the Q, and other figures.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 31, 32\u201334</ref>  The Mohawk, a two-foot turn on the same circle, most likely originated in North America.<ref name=\"hines-34\">Hines (2006), p. 34</ref>  Figure skating historian James Hines called grapevines, which was probably invented in Canada, \"the most American of all figures\".<ref>Hines (2006), p. 59</ref>  The Viennese style of figure skating, as described by Max Wirth's book in 1881, described connecting figures, which ultimately led to modern free skating programs.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 67</ref>\n\nIn 1868, the American Skating Congress, precursor to [[U.S. Figure Skating]], adopted a series of movements used during competitions between skaters from the U.S. and Canada. Until 1947, for approximately the first 50 years of the existence of figure skating as a sport, compulsory figures made up 60 percent of the total score at most competitions around the world.<ref name=\"loosemore\">{{cite news |last1=Loosemore |first1=Sandra |title='Figures' don't add up in competition anymore |url=http://cbs.sportsline.com/u/women/skating/dec98/loosemore121698.htm |accessdate=16 November 2019 |work=CBS SportsLine |date=16 December 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727021537/http://cbs.sportsline.com/u/women/skating/dec98/loosemore121698.htm |archive-date=2008-07-27 }}</ref>  Other competitions held in the late 19th and early 20th centuries included [[special figures]], freeskating, and compulsories, most of the points they earned going towards how they performed the same set of compulsory moves.<ref>Kestnbaum, pp. 81\u201382</ref> The first international figure skating competition was in Vienna in 1882;<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=https://www.isu.org/isu-history |publisher=International Skating Union |accessdate=16 November 2019}}</ref><ref>Hines (2011), p. xx</ref> according to Kestnbaum, it established a precedent for future competitions.<ref name=\"cultureonice-67\"/> Skaters were required to perform 23 compulsory figures, as well as a four-minute freeskating program, and a section called \"special figures\", in which they had to perform moves or combinations of moves that highlighted their advanced skills.<ref name=\"cultureonice-67\">Kestnbaum, p. 67</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C0110-0014-001, Gabriele Seyfert, Ralph Borghardt.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ralph Borghardt]] and [[Gabriele Seyfert]] examine the print of a loop figure at the 1964 [[East German Figure Skating Championships|East German Championships]].|alt=Man on the left and woman on the right crouching on a piece of ice on a rink, the man tracing a figure on the ice with his thumb]]\n\nCompulsory figures were an important part of figure skating for the rest of the 19th century until the 1930s and 1940s. The first [[1891 European Figure Skating Championships|European Championships in 1891]] consisted of only compulsory figures.<ref>Hines (2011), p. 12</ref> In 1896, the newly formed [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) sponsored the [[1896 World Figure Skating Championships|first annual World Figure Skating Championships]] in St. Petersburg. The competition consisted of compulsory figures and freeskating.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 68</ref> Skaters had to perform six compulsory moves, or figures, so that judges could compare skaters according to an established standard. Compulsory figures were worth 60 percent of the competitors' total scores. Special figures were not included in World Championships, although they were included as a separate discipline in other competitions, including the [[1908 Summer Olympics|Olympics in 1908]].<ref name=\"cultureonice-82\"/>\n\nIn 1897, the ISU adopted a schedule of 41 school figures, each of increasing difficulty, which were proposed by the British. They remained the standard compulsory figures used throughout the world in proficiency testing and competitions until 1990, and U.S. Figure Skating continued to use them as a separate discipline in the 1990s. After [[World War II]], more countries were sending skaters to international competitions, so the ISU cut the numbers of figures to a maximum of six due to the extended time it took to judge them all.<ref name=\"cultureonice-82\"/><ref name=\"loosemore\"/>\n\n===Demise===\nCompulsory figures began to be progressively devalued in 1967, when the values of both compulsory figures and free skating were changed to 50 percent.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 197</ref> In 1973, the number of figures was decreased from six to three, and their overall weight was decreased to 30 percent, to make room for the introduction of the [[Short program (figure skating)|short program]].<ref name=\"loosemore\"/><ref name=\"nomorefigures\"/>  Hines stated that the decrease in the importance of compulsory figures was due to \"the unbalanced skating\"<ref name=\"hines2006-204\">Hines, (2006), p. 204</ref> of women skaters such as [[Trixi Schuba|Beatrix \"Trixi\" Schuba]] of Austria, who Hines called \"the last great practitioner of compulsory figures\".<ref name=\"hines2006-204\"/>  Schuba won several medals in the late 1960s and early 1970s based upon the strength of her figures, despite her lower results in free skating.  As Hines stated, \"she could not be defeated under a scoring system that gave preference to figures\".<ref name=\"hines2006-204\"/>  Hines also credited television coverage of figure skating, which helped to increase popularity of the sport, with the eventual demise of compulsory figures.  Television audiences were not exposed to the compulsory figures segments of competitions, so they did not understand why results contradicted what they saw in free skating segments.<ref name=\"hines2006-205\">Hines (2006), p. 205</ref>  Sports writer Sandra Loosemore agreed, stating that television was \"the driving force\"<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> for the rule changes regarding figures in 1968 and the years following. Figures were not broadcast on television because they were not exciting enough, so viewers \"found it incomprehensible that competitions could be won by skaters who had built up huge leads in the figures portion of the event but gave mediocre performances in the part of the competition shown on TV\".<ref name=\"loosemore\"/>  In 1973, the ISU lowered the value of compulsory figures from 50% to 40% and decreased the number of figures skaters were required to perform.  In 1977, the number of the list of figures skaters could chose to perform decreased even more, down to six figures per competition.<ref name=\"hines2006-205\"/>\n\nLoosemore attributed the decrease in the importance of figures to a \"lack of public accountability\"<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> from the judges of international competitions and other discrepancies in judging, which Loosemore called \"dirty judging\".<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> She speculated that television coverage of the sport, which brought more attention to how it was judged, was also responsible and \"since figures competitions weren't televised, fans could not be certain that the judges were on the level\".<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> Loosemore also speculated that \"the relative scarcity of rinks and practice ice for figures in Europe as compared to North America\"<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> ultimately made the difference in the removal of figures from competitions. Kestnbaum agreed, stating that the elimination of figures was motivated by finances, countries with an affluent middle class or government-supported training for athletes having more of a competitive advantage over less affluent and smaller countries with fewer ice rinks and resources to spend the time necessary to train for proficiency in figures. By the late 1970s and into the 1980s, there were discussions about eliminating them from international competitions.<ref name=\"cultureonice-86\">Kestnbaum, p. 86</ref>\n\nIn 1988, the ISU voted to remove compulsory figures from international single skating competitions, for both men and women, starting in the 1990\u20131991 season. Of 31 voting national associations, only the U.S., Canada, Britain, and New Zealand voted against the decision.<ref name=\"nomorefigures\">{{cite news |title=No More Figures in Figure Skating |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/09/sports/no-more-figures-in-figure-skating.html?pagewanted=print |accessdate=16 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |agency=Associated Press |date=9 June 1988 |page=D00025}}</ref> The last two seasons that compulsory figures were competed at an international competition were in 1989 and 1990; only two figures were skated and they were worth only 20 percent of the competitors' overall scores.<ref name=\"loosemore\"/><ref name=\"cultureonice-86\"/>  [[\u017deljka \u010ci\u017eme\u0161ija]] from Yugoslavia skated the last compulsory figure in international competition, at the [[1990 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], on March 7, 1990.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 235</ref>\n\nCompulsory figures have not been a part of any international or most national competitions since 1990.

The slightest misalignment or shift of body weight could cause errors in the execution of figures.<ref name=\"sausa\"/> American figure skating champion [[Irving Brokaw]] insisted that form was more essential to the production of figures than the tracings themselves because the skater needed to find a comfortable and natural position in which to perform them.<ref name=\"artofskating-19\"/> He expected skaters to trace figures without looking down at them because it gave \"a very slovenly appearance\",<ref name=\"artofskating-19\">Brokaw, p. 19</ref> and recommended that they not use their arms excessively or for balance like tightrope walkers. Brokaw wanted skaters to remain upright and avoid bending over as much as they could. Brokaw also thought that the unemployed leg, which he called the \"balance leg\", was as important as the tracing leg because it was used as much in the execution of a figure as the tracing leg. The balance leg also should be bent only slightly, since he believed bending it too much removed its usefulness and appeared clumsy.<ref>Brokaw, pp. 19\u201320</ref>\n\n[[File:Irving Brokaw skater.jpg|thumb|left|American Olympic figure skater [[Irving Brokaw]], who wrote one of the earliest books about figure skating and compulsory figures, ''The Art of Skating'' (1915)|alt=Man in his 30s, wearing dark trousers and coat, skating on an outdoor rink, facing to the right and looking downward towards the ice]]\n\nWriter Ellyn Kestnbaum noted that skaters who were adept at performing compulsory figures had to practice for hours to have precise body control and to become \"intimately familiar with how subtle shifts in the body's balance over the blade affected the tracings left on the ice\".<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 73</ref> She added that many skaters found figures and their visible results calming and rewarding.<ref name=\"cultureonice-84\">Kestnbaum, p. 84</ref> Sports writer Christie Sausa insisted that training in figures \"helps create better skaters and instills discipline, and can be practiced over a lifetime by skaters of all ages and abilities\".<ref name=\"sausa\"/>  The German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' declared in 1983 that compulsory figures stifled skaters' creativity because not much about figures had changed in 100 years of competitions.<ref name=\"spiegel\"/>\n\n===Figure elements===\n\nAll compulsory figures had the following: circles, curves, change of foot, change of [[Glossary of figure skating terms#E|edge]], and turns. The circle, the basis of all figures, was performed on both its long and short [[Radical axis|axes]]. Skaters had to trace precise circles, while completing difficult turns and edges.<ref name=\"sausa\"/><ref name=\"specialregs-2\">Special Regs, p. 2</ref> Most figures \"employ specific one-foot turns not done in combination with other one-foot turns\".<ref name=\"hines2006-99\"/>  Each figure consisted of two or three tangent circles. Each circle's [[diameter]] had to be about three times the skater's height, and the [[radii]] of all half-circles and circles had to be approximately the same length. Half-circles and circles had to begin and end as near as possible to the point in which the long and short axes intersected. The figure's long axis divided it longitudinally into equal-sized halves, and the figure's short axes divided the figures into equal-sized lobes.<ref name=\"specialregs-2\"/>\n\nCurves, which are parts of circles, had to be performed with an uninterrupted tracing and with a single clean edge, with no subcurves or wobbles.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\">Special Regs, p. 3</ref> Brokaw insisted that curves had to be done on all four edges of the skate, as well as on the inside and outside edges while skating both backwards and forwards.<ref name=\"artofskating-23\">Brokaw, p. 23</ref> He stated, \"It is the control of these circles that gives strength and power, and the holding of the body in the proper and graceful attitudes, while it is the execution of these large circles, changes of edges, threes and double-threes, brackets, loops, rockers and counters, which makes up the art of skating\".<ref name=\"artofskating-23\"/> Curves also included the forced turn (or [[Bracket turn|bracket]]) and the serpentine.<ref name=\"artofskating-23\"/>\n\nA change of foot, which happened during the short time the skater transferred weight from one foot to the other, was allowed in the execution of figures, but had to be done in a symmetrical zone of each side of the long axis. Skaters could choose the exact point in which they placed their foot in this zone, although it typically was just after the long axis, with the full weight of the body on the skate. It was at this point when the tracing began.<ref name=\"specialregs-2\"/> A change of edge happened at the point in which the long and short axes intersected. Its trace had to be continuously and symmetrically traced and could not be S-shaped. The edge change had to be as short as possible, and could not be longer than the length of the skate blade. Turns were skated with a single clean edge up to and after the turn, but with no double tracings, no skids or scrapes, or no illegal edge change either before, during, or after a turn. The turns' cusps had to be the same size, and the entry into and out of a turn had to be symmetrical.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\"/>\n\nThe simple \"figure eight\" shape was executed by connecting two circles<ref name=\"cultureonice-59\"/> \"about three times the height of the skater with one circle skated on each foot\".<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> The figure eight has four variations: inside edges, outside edges, backward, and forward. A turn added at the halfway point of each circle increased the level of complexity. Other figures included three-lobed figures with a [[counter turn]] or a [[rocker turn]], which were completed at the points where the lobes touched.<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> Counters and rockers had to be executed symmetrically, with no change of edge, with the points of their turns either pointing up or down or lying along the figure's long axis, and could not be beaked or hooked. Brackets, like threes, had to be skated on a circle, its turns' points either pointing up or down or lying along the figure's long axis.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\"/>\n\nSkaters also performed a group of smaller figures called loops.<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> The diameter of the loop's circular shape had to be about the same height of the skater, and they could not have any scrapes or points on the ice. The place in which the skater entered into or exited out of the crossing of both the loop tracing and the center of the loop had to sit on the figure's long axis, where the loop was divided into symmetrical halves. The center of the loop figure to the place in which the skater entered into or exited out of the loop's crossing had to measure five-sixths of the circle's diameter. The loop's length had to be about one-third of the distance from the place in which the skater entered into or exited out of the loop's crossing of the loop tracing to the figure's short axis. The loop's width had to be about two-thirds of its length.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\"/>  The Q figure begins at the tail of the figure, on the skater's outside edge.  It can also begin on any of the four edges, and the direction in which it can be skated can be reversed.  When the circle is skated first, it is called a reverse Q.<ref name=\"hines-34\"/>  Altered forms of the Q figure often do not look like the letter \"q\", but \"simply employ a serpentine line and a three turn\".<ref name=\"hines-34\"/>  United shamrocks, spectacles (shapes that trace the shape of eyeglasses), and united roses are alterations of the basic Q figures.<ref name=\"hines-34\"/>\n\nThere were three types of [[3 turn|three turns]]: the standard three, the double three, and the paragraph double three. The three turn had to be skated on a circle, its turns' points either pointing up or down or lying along the figure's long axis.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\"/><ref name=\"loosemore\"/> For the double three, the points of both threes had to be directed towards the center of each circle, and had to divide the circle into three equal curves. The middle curve had to divide the circles into halves by the figure's long axis.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\"/> The paragraph double three, which was executed at the highest levels of competition, was done by tracing \"two circles with two turns at each circle, all on one foot from one push-off\".<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> The paragraph double three was difficult to accomplish because the shape and placement of the turns had to be perfectly symmetrical, the turns had to be done on a true edge with no scrapes on the ice, and the circles had to be the same size and exactly round.<ref name=\"loosemore\"/>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Figure eight.png|The figure-eight\nFile:Threeturn.GIF|The [[3 turn]]\nFile:Counter.GIF|The [[counter turn]]\nFile:Rocker turn.gif|The [[rocker turn]]\nFile:Bracket.GIF|The [[bracket turn]]\nFile:Loop complusoryfigures.png|The loop\n</gallery>\n\n==Judging==\n\n''Der Spiegel'' compared judging compulsory figures to the work of forensic scientists.<ref name=\"spiegel\">{{cite news |title=Eiskunstlauf: Das Schlimmste |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14020212.html |accessdate=16 November 2019 |work=Der Spiegel |date=7 February 1983 |language=German}}</ref> After the skaters completed tracing figures, the judges scrutinized the circles made, and the process was repeated twice more.

In 1863 and 1864 it was temporarily known as the '''123rd Illinois Volunteer Mounted Infantry Regiment,''' as part of Wilder's Lightning Brigade.\n\n==Service==\nThis regiment was organized at Camp Terry, [[Mattoon, Illinois|Mattoon]], [[Coles County]], [[Illinois]], by Colonel James Monroe, who at the time was major of the [[7th Illinois Volunteer Regiment|7th Illinois Infantry]].<ref name=\"Reece\">Reece</ref> Companies A, C, D, H, I and K were from Coles County; B from [[Cumberland County, Illinois|Cumberland]]; E from [[Clark County, Illinois|Clark]]; F and G from Clark and [[Crawford County, Illinois|Crawford]]. As a colonel in 1861, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] organized his first command, the [[21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], in Mattoon.\n\nIt was mustered into service on September 6, 1862, with James Monroe as Colonel, Jonathan Biggs, of Westfield, Clark County, as Lieutenant Colonel, and James A. Connolly, of [[Charleston, Illinois]], as Major. On 19 September 1862, the Regiment was loaded into freight cars at Mattoon, and transported to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where it was at once put to work, under Major General [[William \"Bull\" Nelson]], to fortify the city against Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]], who was then advancing on it in pursuit of Union General [[Don Carlos Buell]].\n\nOn October 1, having been assigned to the Thirty-third Brigade (General [[William R. Terrill]]), Fourth Division (General [[James S. Jackson]]), in [[Alexander McDowell McCook|McCook's Corps]], the regiment started on the march under Buell, southward through Kentucky, after Bragg, who had turned back, and up to this time the regiment never had battalion drill, and hardly an attempt at company drill, as all the officers, except the colonel, were \"raw recruits\".\n\nJust 19 days after leaving Mattoon, the regiment engaged in the [[Battle of Perryville]], where 36 men were killed in action and 180 wounded.<ref name=\"Jared\">Jared </ref> Generals Terrill and Jackson were both killed immediately behind and within twenty feet of the line of the regiment. Among the wounded were Captain Coblentz of Company E, First Lieutenant S. M. Shepard of Company A and Adjutant Leander H. Hamlin. Following the devastating bloodshed the 123rd was assigned to protect the railroad bridge across the Green River at [[Munfordville]], [[Kentucky]], in November and December 1862. It has become known as the \"Battle for the Bridge,\" which began when the Union garrison led by [[John T. Wilder]], prior to his assuming command of the 123rd, surrendered during the [[Battle of Munfordville]].\n\nThe 123rd was initially assigned to the [[Army of the Ohio]] from September 1862 to November 1862, and then to the [[Army of the Cumberland]] from November 1862 to June 1865. The commanding general of the Army of the Cumberland was [[William Rosecrans]]. The regiment was in the 1st Brigade with Colonel Albert S. Hall, which was part of the 5th Division commanded by Brigadier General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]], reporting to Major General [[George Henry Thomas]]. \n\nIn February and March 1863, it was converted to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois' brigade became known as \"Wilder's [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]]\" commanded by [[John T. Wilder|Wilder]]. The brigade remained the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division, XIV Army Corps after its conversion. During this conversion, [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], were adopted as the command's primary weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> \n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade\" the 123rd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\n\nThe new increase in firepower that the Spencer gave, allowed the 123rd and its brigade mates to see off numerically superior Confederate infantry and cavalry in several engagements. The weapon was estimated to allow the regiment to deliver five t seven times the firepower of muzzle-loading opponents<ref name=\"Repeaters\">Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Sunderland</ref>.\n\nThe 123rd first used its new rifles in the [[Battle of Hoover's Gap]].<ref name=\"Repeaters\" /> The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe brigade surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/tullahoma-campaign-bus-tour.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After driving them through the gap, the brigade found it outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=\"ABT1\">[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=\"Repeaters\" />. The brigade entrenched and held this position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\" />. The brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=\"ABT1\" /> The regiment served quite well through the remainder of the campaign. }} \n\nDuring the calamitous [[Chickamauga Campaign]]|Tullahoma Campaign]], the 123rd and the rest of the Lightning Brigade, were one of the few positive results. The 123rd was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Feeling quite confident in the advantage their [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s gave them, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAt around 14:00 on 19 September, the 123rd and its brigade spoiled the left column of the main rebel attack by severely mauling both Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade and Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade. The attacking Confederates were surprised by the resolute, confident manner that the Lightning Brigade demonnstrated in driving them back.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Siege of Chattanooga]], the Lightning Brigade disbanded, and four of its regiments shifted to the Cavalry Corps where they served for the remainder of the war. The 123rd and the 72nd Indiana were sent to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Selma]], First Lieutenant O. J. McManus, Sergeants J. S. Mullen and Henry E. Cross, Corporal McMurry and Privates Daniel Cook, John Bowman, Marion White and Henry Woodruff were killed, with 50 wounded, including Lieutenant Colonel Biggs, Adjutant L. B. Bane, Captains W. E. Adams and Owen Wiley, Lieutenants Alex. McNutt and J. R. Harding.\n\nLate in the war, the regiment pursued Confederate General [[John Bell Hood]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |title=Battle Near Rome, Georgia, October 12, 1864 |access-date=2018-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707060209/http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The unit was instrumental in the capture of former Confederate capital [[Montgomery, Alabama]].\n\nIn June 1865 new recruits and some veterans were transferred to the [[61st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|61st Regiment]] as the 123rd prepared to disband.<ref name=\"ILNG\">GlobalSecurity.org 1st Battalion, 123d Infantry</ref> Those who remained were mustered out June 27, 1865, by Captain L.

In 1863 and 1864 it was temporarily known as the Mounted Infantry, 123rd Regiment as part of Wilder's Lightning Brigade.\n\n==Service==\nThis regiment was organized at Camp Terry, [[Mattoon, Illinois|Mattoon]], [[Coles County]], [[Illinois]], by Colonel James Monroe, who at the time was major of the [[7th Illinois Volunteer Regiment|7th Illinois Infantry]].<ref name=\"Reece\">Reece</ref> Companies A, C, D, H, I and K were from Coles County; B from [[Cumberland County, Illinois|Cumberland]]; E from [[Clark County, Illinois|Clark]]; F and G from Clark and [[Crawford County, Illinois|Crawford]]. As a colonel in 1861, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] organized his first command, the [[21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], in Mattoon.\n\nIt was mustered into service on September 6, 1862, with James Monroe as Colonel, Jonathan Biggs, of Westfield, Clark County, as Lieutenant Colonel, and James A. Connolly, of [[Charleston, Illinois]], as Major. On 19 September 1862, the Regiment was loaded into freight cars at Mattoon, and transported to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where it was at once put to work, under Major General [[William \"Bull\" Nelson]], to fortify the city against Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]], who was then advancing on it in pursuit of Union General [[Don Carlos Buell]].\n\nOn October 1, having been assigned to the Thirty-third Brigade (General [[William R. Terrill]]), Fourth Division (General [[James S. Jackson]]), in [[Alexander McDowell McCook|McCook's Corps]], the regiment started on the march under Buell, southward through Kentucky, after Bragg, who had turned back, and up to this time the regiment never had battalion drill, and hardly an attempt at company drill, as all the officers, except the colonel, were \"raw recruits\".\n\nJust 19 days after leaving Mattoon, the regiment engaged in the [[Battle of Perryville]], where 36 men were killed in action and 180 wounded.<ref name=\"Jared\">Jared </ref> Generals Terrill and Jackson were both killed immediately behind and within twenty feet of the line of the regiment. Among the wounded were Captain Coblentz of Company E, First Lieutenant S. M. Shepard of Company A and Adjutant Leander H. Hamlin. Following the devastating bloodshed the 123rd was assigned to protect the railroad bridge across the Green River at [[Munfordville]], [[Kentucky]], in November and December 1862. It has become known as the \"Battle for the Bridge,\" which began when the Union garrison led by [[John T. Wilder]], prior to his assuming command of the 123rd, surrendered during the [[Battle of Munfordville]].\n\nThe 123rd was initially assigned to the [[Army of the Ohio]] from September 1862 to November 1862, and then to the [[Army of the Cumberland]] from November 1862 to June 1865. The commanding general of the Army of the Cumberland was [[William Rosecrans]]. The regiment was in the 1st Brigade with Colonel Albert S. Hall, which was part of the 5th Division commanded by Brigadier General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]], reporting to Major General [[George Henry Thomas]]. \n\nIn February and March 1863, it was converted to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois' brigade became known as \"Wilder's [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]]\" commanded by [[John T. Wilder|Wilder]]. The brigade remained the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division, XIV Army Corps after its conversion. During this conversion, [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], were adopted as the command's primary weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> \n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade\" the 123rd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\n\nThe new increase in firepower that the Spencer gave, allowed the 123rd and its brigade mates to see off numerically superior Confederate infantry and cavalry in several engagements. The weapon was estimated to allow the regiment to deliver five t seven times the firepower of muzzle-loading opponents<ref name=\"Repeaters\">Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Sunderland</ref>.\n\nThe 123rd first used its new rifles in the [[Battle of Hoover's Gap]].<ref name=\"Repeaters\" /> The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe brigade surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/tullahoma-campaign-bus-tour.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After driving them through the gap, the brigade found it outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=\"ABT1\">[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=\"Repeaters\" />. The brigade entrenched and held this position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\" />. The brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=\"ABT1\" /> The regiment served quite well through the remainder of the campaign. }} \n\nDuring the calamitous [[Chickamauga Campaign]]|Tullahoma Campaign]], the 123rd and the rest of the Lightning Brigade, were one of the few positive results. The 123rd was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Feeling quite confident in the advantage their [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s gave them, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAt around 14:00 on 19 September, the 123rd and its brigade spoiled the left column of the main rebel attack by severely mauling both Brig.
