As Ali's army returned from the [[Greek War of Independence]], his son and the commander of the army, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], suggested the creation of an Egyptian Cavalry Corps. The Corps was established in 1828 and a school was founded in [[Giza]] to train Cavalry officers.\nIn 1839, the Cavalry Corps had a total of 15 regiments scattered all over Egypt. The regiments and their respective locations included:\n\n* 1st Guards Cavalry Regiment (Latakia)\n* 2nd Guards Cavalry Regiment (Besan)\n* 1st Cavalry Regiment (Urfa)\n* 2nd Cavalry Regiment (Zanba)\n* 3rd Cavalry Regiment (Alexandria)\n* 4th Cavalry Regiment (Adana)\n* 5th Cavalry Regiment (Alexandria)\n* 6th Cavalry Regiment (Damascus)\n* 7th Cavalry Regiment (Tarsus)\n* 8th Cavalry Regiment (Damascus)\n* 9th Cavalry Regiment (Alexandria )\n* 10th Cavalry Regiment (Acre)\n* 11th Cavalry Regiment (Kilis)\n* 12th Cavalry Regiment (Tarsus)\n* 13th Cavalry Regiment (Urfa)\n\n=== The Cavalry School in Giza ===\nIn his book Clot Bey mentioned {{Which|date=April 2020}} that the formation of the cavalry teams in the Egyptian army were not formed according to the new system until after the army's return from the [[Greek War of Independence]], because, during this war, Ibrahim Pasha had witnessed the cavalry system of France and realised the importance of cavalry organisation. After his return to Egypt, he began to form cavalry teams based on the European system, and several European teachers were hired for this purpose.\n\nThe Military Academy of Cavalry was established in [[Giza]] at [[Mourad Bey Palace]], which was turned into a cavalry barracks. The school was organised by [[Monsieu Varane|Monsieur Varane]], who was from the officers of the Napoleonic Empire including Yawar, Marshal Gouvion Sancer, and his subordinate in-training officers, who were learning about cavalry manoeuvres and infantry movements.\n\nThe school used to follow the system of the [[Somme Military School]] in France, except for some minor modifications that were required by the local conditions.{{Clarify|reason=|date=April 2020}} Young Egyptians and Turks graduated as officers of the Cavalry Corps.\n\n[[Auguste de Marmont|Marshal Marmon]] visited this school in 1834, and there were 360 trainees in it, and he admired it and wrote about it on his journey:<blockquote>\"When I saw these students in the field carrying out manoeuvres, I imagined that I was in front of a line of the finest verses in our horses. While the school was lacking to reach a degree of perfection, some lessons in language, drawing, and so forth, but there is no dispute that it is from the side of organising the cavalry teams, it lacks nothing, The students are good at riding horses, the manoeuvres they perform take place with lightness, accuracy and wisdom, their system and their best regret, and their morale is fine, they are soldiers with all the meanings of the word, and the trumpet bearers perform their work with perfection. \"</blockquote>\n\n== Post Anglo-Egyptian War ==\nAfter the [[British Conquest of Egypt (1882)|Anglo-Egyptian war]], the Egyptian Military High Command was controlled by [[British Empire|British]] generals and was downsized until it became a homeland defence.\nThe Cavalry Corps was split into [[Battalion]]s instead of [[Regiment]]s. Their main engagement after the war was the long-running [[Mahdist War]]\n\n== World War I ==\nIn [[World War I|World War I,]] it was estimated that around one million Egyptians fought for the Entente on many different fronts including 100,000 of them on European Fronts (Greece, Italy, France and Belgium). Most of the Cavalry participation was on the [[North Africa]]n and Arabian fronts.\n\n== Modernisation ==\n{{Main|Egyptian Armored Corps}}\nA few years after World War I, Egypt ended the British Protectorate and a Kingdom under the rule of [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] was established. Fuad's administration began to modernise everything in the country including the economy, military, education, etc. The military modernisation was focused on mechanisation, building new military schools and mobilising more men & reestablishing units. In 1928, the corps' name was changed to ''Royal Egyptian Cavalry Corps.'' The mechanisation process went totally on the Egyptian Cavalry Corps where many of its units (except the Royal Guards) replaced its traditional horse formations with Armoured Vehicles and Tanks that by the late 1930s all of the Corps was mechanised.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Military units and formations of Egypt]]\n[[Category:Cavalry units and formations]]\n", "name_user": "Shivaraj Vanamane", "label": "safe", "comment": "hdhd", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Egyptian_Cavalry_Corps&redirect=no"}

According to a local rhyme, the demise of ''Venta Icenorum'' led to the development of Norwich: \"Caistor was a city when Norwich was none, Norwich was built of Caistor stone.\"{{sfn |Morley |2006}}\n\n===Early English and Norman conquest===\n[[File:Norwich Cathedral, spire and south transept.jpg|thumb|[[Norwich Cathedral]] is one of the great Norman buildings of England.]]\nThere are two suggested models of development for Norwich. It is possible that three separate early Anglo-Saxon settlements, one north of the river and two either side on the south, joined together as they grew or that one Anglo-Saxon settlement, north of the river, emerged in the mid-7th century after the abandonment of the previous three. The ancient city was a thriving centre for trade and commerce in East Anglia in 1004 when it was raided and burnt by [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Swein Forkbeard]] the [[Viking]] king of Denmark. [[Mercia]]n coins and shards of pottery from the [[Rhineland]] dating from the 8th century suggest that long-distance trade was happening long before this. Between 924 and 939, Norwich became fully established as a town, with its own mint. The word ''Norvic'' appears on coins across Europe minted during this period, in the reign of [[Athelstan|King Athelstan]]. The Vikings were a strong cultural influence in Norwich for 40 to 50 years at the end of the 9th century, setting up an [[Anglo-Scandinavian]] district near the north end of present-day King Street. At the time of the [[Norman Conquest]], the city was one of the largest in England. The [[Domesday Book]] states that it had approximately 25 churches and a population of between 5,000 and 10,000. It also records the site of an Anglo-Saxon church in Tombland, the site of the Saxon market place and the later [[Norwich Cathedral|Norman cathedral]]. Norwich continued to be a major centre for trade, the River Wensum being a convenient export route to the [[River Yare]] and [[Great Yarmouth]], which served as the [[Port of Norwich|port for Norwich]]. [[Quern stone]]s and other artefacts from Scandinavia and the Rhineland have been found during excavations in Norwich city centre. These date from the 11th century onwards.\n\n[[File:Norwich Castle.jpg|thumb|[[Norwich Castle]]'s 12th-century keep]]\n[[Norwich Castle]] was founded soon after the Norman Conquest.<ref>{{PastScape |mnumber=132268 |mname=Norwich Castle |accessdate=29 December 2010}}</ref> The [[Domesday Book]] records that 98 Saxon homes were demolished to make way for the castle.{{sfn |Harfield |1991 |pp=373, 384}} The [[Normans]] established a new focus of settlement around the Castle and the area to the west of it: this became known as the \"New\" or \"French\" borough, centred on the Normans' own market place, which survives today as Norwich Market. In 1096, [[Herbert de Losinga]], [[Bishop of Thetford]], began construction of [[Norwich Cathedral]]. The chief building material for the Cathedral was limestone, imported from Caen in Normandy. To transport the building stone to the site, a canal was cut from the river (from the site of present-day Pulls Ferry) up to the east wall. Herbert de Losinga then moved his [[Episcopal see|See]] there, to what became the cathedral church for the [[Anglican Diocese of Norwich|Diocese of Norwich]]. The Bishop of Norwich still signs himself ''Norvic''. Norwich received a [[royal charter]] from [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] in 1158, and another from [[Richard I of England|Richard ''the Lionheart'']] in 1194. After a riot in the city in 1274, Norwich has the distinction of being the only complete English city to be excommunicated by the Pope.{{sfn |Blomefield |1806}}\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThe first recorded presence of [[Jews]] in Norwich is 1134.<ref name=\"heritagecity1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.heritagecity.org/research-centre/churches-and-creeds/jews-in-norwich.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130806235625/http://www.heritagecity.org/research-centre/churches-and-creeds/jews-in-norwich.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 August 2013 |title=Jews in Norwich |publisher=Heritagecity.org |accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref> In 1144, the Jews of Norwich were falsely accused of [[ritual murder]] after a boy ([[William of Norwich]]) was found dead with stab wounds.<ref name=\"heritagecity1\"/> William acquired the status of martyr and was subsequently [[canonization|canonised]]. Pilgrims made offerings to a shrine at the Cathedral (largely finished by 1140) up to the 16th century, but the records suggest there were few of them.{{sfn |Nilson |2001 |p=157}} In 1174, Norwich was sacked by the [[Flemish people|Flemings]]. In February 1190, all the Jews of Norwich were massacred except for a few who found refuge in the castle. At the site of a medieval well, the bones of 17 individuals, including 11 children, were found in 2004 by workers preparing the ground for construction of a Norwich shopping centre. The remains were determined by [[forensic science|forensic scientists]] to be most probably the remains of such murdered Jews, and a [[Genetic genealogy|DNA]] expert determined that the victims were all related, so that they probably came from one [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi Jewish]] family.{{sfn |Jewish Telegraphic Agency |2011}} The study of the remains featured in an episode of the [[BBC Television|BBC television]] documentary series ''[[History Cold Case]]''.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Bodies in the Well |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0125kbf |series=History Cold Case |network=[[BBC HD]] |airdate=28 June 2011 |seriesno=2 |number=3 |access-date=25 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816170740/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0125kbf |archivedate=16 August 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ethelbert Gate from Tombland, Norwich, UK.jpg|thumb|St Ethelbert's Gate at Tombland was built as penance for riots which occurred in the 1270s.]]\nIn 1216, the castle fell to Louis, Dauphin of France and Hildebrand's Hospital was founded, followed ten years later by the [[Franciscan]] Friary and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Friary. The Great Hospital dates from 1249 and the College of St Mary in the Field from 1250. In 1256, Whitefriars was founded. In 1266 the city was sacked by the \"Disinherited\". It has the distinction of being the only English city ever to be excommunicated, following a riot between citizens and monks in 1274.{{sfn |Blomefield |1806}} As a penance, St Ethelbert's Gate, one of the entrances to the cathedral priory, was constructed by Norwich citizens. In 1278 the Cathedral received final consecration. In 1290 the city flooded. Austin Friary was founded in that year.\n\nThe engine of trade was [[wool]] from Norfolk's [[sheepwalk]]s. Wool made England rich, and the [[staple right|staple port]] of Norwich \"in her state doth stand With towns of high'st regard the fourth of all the land\", as [[Michael Drayton]] noted in ''[[Poly-Olbion]]'' (1612). The wealth generated by the [[wool#History|wool trade]] throughout the [[Middle Ages]] financed the construction of many fine churches, so that Norwich still has more medieval churches than any other city in Western Europe north of the [[Alps]]. Throughout this period Norwich established wide-ranging trading links with other parts of Europe, its markets stretching from [[Scandinavia]] to Spain and the city housing a [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] warehouse. To organise and control its exports to the [[Low Countries]], Great Yarmouth, as the port for Norwich, was designated one of the staple ports under the terms of the 1353 [[Statute of the Staple]].\n\nFrom 1280 to 1340 the [[defensive wall|city walls]] were built. At around {{convert|2 + 1/2|mi|km|}}, these walls, along with the river, enclosed a larger area than that of the [[City of London]]. However, when the city walls were constructed it was made illegal to build outside them, inhibiting expansion of the city. Around this time, the city was made a [[county corporate]] and became the seat of one of the most densely populated and prosperous [[ancient counties of England|counties]] of England. Part of these walls remain standing today.\n\n===Early modern period (1485\u20131640)===\nHand-in-hand with the wool industry, this key religious centre experienced a Reformation significantly different to other parts of England. The magistracy in Tudor Norwich unusually found ways of managing religious discord whilst maintaining civic harmony.{{sfn |McClendon |1999}}\n\n[[File:John Crome 002.jpg|thumb|''Mousehold Heath, Norwich'' by Norfolk-based artist [[John Crome]]]]The summer of 1549 saw an unprecedented rebellion in Norfolk. Unlike popular challenges elsewhere in the Tudor period, it appears to have been [[Protestant]] in nature. For several weeks, rebels led by [[Robert Kett]] camped outside Norwich on [[Mousehold Heath]] and took control of the city on 29 July 1549 with the support of many of its poorer inhabitants. [[Kett's Rebellion]] was particularly in response to the enclosure of land by landlords, leaving peasants with nowhere to graze their animals and the general abuses of power by the nobility. The uprising ended on 27 August when the rebels were defeated by an army. Kett was convicted of treason and hanged from the walls of Norwich Castle.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.britainexpress.com/History/tudor/ketts-rebellion.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708183620/https://www.britainexpress.com/History/tudor/ketts-rebellion.htm |archive-date=8 July 2019 |url-status=live |title=Kett's Rebellion, 1549 |website=Passionate about British Heritage |publisher=Britain Express |first=David |last=Ross }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/robert_ket_and_the_norfolk_risin.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913132214/http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/robert_ket_and_the_norfolk_risin.htm |archive-date=13 September 2018 |url-status=live |title=Robert Ket and the Norfolk Rising }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |first=Jon |last=McGregor |date=20 May 2019 |department=Travel |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/may/20/radicalism-rebellion-and-robert-kett-a-walk-through-norwichs-history |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708183615/https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/may/20/radicalism-rebellion-and-robert-kett-a-walk-through-norwichs-history |archive-date=8 July 2019 |url-status=live |title=Radicalism, rebellion and Robert Kett: a walk through Norwich's history }}</ref>\n\nUnusually in England, the rebellion divided the city and appears to have linked Protestantism with the plight of the urban poor. In the case of Norwich, this process was underscored later by the arrival of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Flemish people|Flemish]] \"[[Elizabethan Strangers|Strangers]]\" fleeing persecution from the Catholics and eventually numbering as many as one-third of the city's population.{{sfn |Houlbroke |McClendon |2004 |p=257}} Large numbers of such exiles came to the city, especially Flemish Protestants from the Westkwartier (\"Western Quarter\"), a region in the [[Southern Netherlands]] where the first [[Calvinist]] fires of the [[Dutch Revolt]] had spread. Inhabitants of [[Ypres]], in particular, chose Norwich above other destinations.{{sfn |Fagel |2003 |p=52}} Perhaps in response to Kett, Norwich became the first provincial city to initiate compulsory payments for a civic scheme of poor relief, which it has been claimed led to its wider introduction, forming the basis of the later Elizabethan Poor Law of 1597\u20131598.{{sfn |Pound |2004 |pp=50\u201356}}\n\nNorwich has traditionally been the home of various minorities, notably French [[Huguenot]] and Belgian [[Walloons|Walloon]] communities in the 16th and 17th centuries. The great \"stranger\" immigration of 1567 brought a substantial Flemish and Walloon community of Protestant [[weaver (occupation)|weaver]]s to Norwich, where they are said to have been made welcome.{{sfn |Ketton-Cremer |1957}} The merchant's house which was their earliest base in the city \u2014 now a museum \u2014 is still known as [[Strangers' Hall]]. It seems that the strangers integrated into the local community without much animosity, at least among the business fraternity, who had the most to gain from their skills. Their arrival in Norwich boosted trade with mainland Europe and fostered a movement toward religious reform and radical politics in the city. By contrast, after being persecuted by the Anglican church for his [[Puritan]] beliefs, [[Michael Metcalf (puritan)|Michael Metcalf]], a 17th-century Norwich weaver, fled the city and settled in [[Dedham, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=A New England Town |last=Lockridge |first=Kenneth |year=1985 |publisher=W.

Along with their advanced techniques in textile working, they brought pet canaries which they began to breed locally; eventually becoming, in the 20th century, a mascot of the city and the emblem of its football club, [[Norwich City F.C.]], whose nickname is \"The Canaries\". \n\nPrinting was introduced to the city in 1567 by Anthony de Solempne, one of the strangers, but it did not take root and had died out by about 1572.{{sfn |Stoker |1981}}\n\n===Civil War to Victorian era===\nAcross the Eastern Counties, [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s powerful [[Eastern Association]] was eventually dominant. However, to begin with, there had been a large element of Royalist sympathy within Norwich, which seems to have experienced a continuity of its two-sided political tradition throughout the period. Bishop [[Matthew Wren]] was a forceful supporter of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Nonetheless, [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] recruitment took hold. The strong Royalist party was stifled by a lack of commitment from the aldermen and isolation from Royalist-held regions.{{sfn |Hopper |2004}} Serious inter-factional disturbances culminated in \"The Great Blow\" of 1648 when Parliamentary forces tried to quell a Royalist riot. The latter's gunpowder was set off by accident in the city centre, causing mayhem. According to Hopper<ref>{{harvnb |Hopper |2004}},</ref> the explosion \"ranks among the largest of the century\". Stoutly defended though East Anglia was by the Parliamentary army, there are said to have been pubs in Norwich where the king's health was still drunk and the name of the Protector sung to ribald verse.\n\nAt the cost of some discomfort to the Mayor, the moderate [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]] was targeted because of his position as Bishop of Norwich.\n\nNorwich was marked in the period after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] of 1660 and the ensuing century by a golden age of its cloth industry, comparable only to those in the [[West Country]] and Yorkshire.{{sfn |Wilson |2004a}} But unlike other cloth-manufacturing regions, Norwich weaving brought greater urbanisation, mainly concentrated in the surrounds of the city itself, creating an urban society, with features such as leisure time, alehouses and other public forums of debate and argument.{{sfn |Wilson |2004b}}\n\n[[File:Original Norfolk and Norwich Hospital - geograph.org.uk - 84361.jpg|thumb|Founded in 1771, the [[Norfolk and Norwich Hospital]] cared for the city's poor and sick. It closed in 2003 after services were moved to the [[Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital]].]]\nWriting of the early 18th century, Pound describes the city's rich cultural life, the winter theatre season, the festivities accompanying the summer assizes, and other popular entertainments. Norwich was the wealthiest town in England, with a sophisticated system of [[poor relief]], and a large influx of foreign refugees.{{sfn |Pound |2004 |p=61}} Despite severe outbreaks of plague, the city had a population of almost 30,000. This made Norwich unique in England, although there were some 50 cities of similar size in Europe. In some, like Lyon and [[Dresden]], this was, as in the case of Norwich, linked to an important proto-industry, such as textiles or china pottery, in some, such as Vienna, Madrid and Dublin, to the city's status as an administrative capital, and in some such as Antwerp, Marseilles and Cologne to a position on an important maritime or river trade route.{{efn|1=For table of city sizes see {{harvtxt |Corfield |2004 |p=143}}}}\n\nNorwich in the late 17th century was riven politically. Churchman [[Humphrey Prideaux]] described \"two factions, [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] and [[Tory]], and both contend for their way with the utmost violence.\"{{sfn |Knights |2004}} Nor did the city accept the outcome of the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]] with a unified voice. The pre-eminent citizen, Bishop William Lloyd, would not take the oaths of allegiance to the new monarchs. One report has it that in 1704 the landlord of Fowler's alehouse \"with a glass of beer in hand, went down on his knees and drank a health to James the third, wishing the Crowne [sic] well and settled on his head.\"{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174 |quote= \"Never was a city in the miserable kingdom so wretchedly divided as this,\" said the ''London Post''}}\n\nIn 1716, at a play at the ''New Inn'', the Pretender was cheered and the audience booed and hissed every time King George's name was mentioned. In 1722 supporters of the king were said to be \"hiss'd at and curst as they go in the streets,\" and in 1731 \"a Tory mobb, in a great body, went through several parts of this city, in a riotous manner, cursing and abusing such as they knew to be friends of the government.\"{{efn |1=Reports quoted by {{harvnb |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}}}} But the Whigs gradually gained control and by the 1720s they had successfully petitioned Parliament to allow all adult males working in the textile industry to take up the freedom, on the correct assumption that they would vote Whig. But it had the effect of boosting the city's popular Jacobitism, says Knights, and contests of the kind described continued in Norwich well into a period in which political stability had been discerned at a national level. The city's Jacobitism perhaps only ended with 1745, well after it had ceased to be a significant movement outside Scotland.{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}} Despite the Highlanders reaching Derby and Norwich citizens mustering themselves into an association to protect the city, some Tories refused to join in, and the vestry of [[St Peter Mancroft]] resolved that it would not ring its bells to summon the defence. Still, it was the end of the road for Norwich Jacobites, and the Whigs organised a notable celebration after the [[Battle of Culloden]].{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}}\n\nThe events of this period illustrate how Norwich had a strong tradition of popular protest favouring Church and Stuarts and attached to the street and alehouse. Knights tells how in 1716 the mayoral election had ended in a riot, with both sides throwing \"brick-ends and great paving stones\" at each other.{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}} A renowned Jacobite watering-hole, the ''Blue Bell Inn'' (nowadays ''The Bell Hotel''), owned in the early 18th century by the high-church Helwys family, became the central rendezvous of the Norwich Revolution Society in the 1790s.{{sfn |Jewson |1975 |p=38}}\n\nBritain's first provincial newspaper, the ''[[Norwich Post]]'', appeared in 1701. By 1726 there were rival Whig and Tory presses, and as early as mid-century, three-quarters of the males in some parishes were literate.{{efn |1=Quoted by {{harvnb |Knights |2004 |pp=181\u2013182}}}} The Norwich municipal library claims an excellent collection of these newspapers, also a folio collection of scrapbooks on 18th-century Norwich politics, which Knights says are \"valuable and important\". Norwich alehouses had 281 clubs and societies meeting in them in 1701, and at least 138 more were formed before 1758. The [[Theatre Royal, Norwich|Theatre Royal]] opened in 1758, alongside the city's stage productions in inns and puppet shows in rowdy alehouses.{{sfn |Chandler |1998}}{{sfn |Blackwell |Blackwell |2007 |loc=Chap 2}} In 1750 Norwich could boast nine booksellers and after 1780 a \"growing number of circulating and subscription libraries\".{{sfn |Dain |2004}} {{harvnb |Knights |2004}} says: \"[All this] made for a lively political culture, in which independence from governmental lines was particularly strong, evident in campaigns against the war with America and for reform... in which trade and the impact of war with [[Revolutionary France]] were key ingredients. The open and contestable structure of local government, the press, the clubs and societies, and dissent all ensured that politics overlapped with communities bound by economics, religion, ideology and print in a world in which public opinion could not be ignored.\"{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}}\n\n[[File:OctagonChapel.JPG|thumb|left|The Octagon Chapel]]\nAmid this metropolitan culture, the city burghers had built a sophisticated political structure. Freemen, who had the right to trade and to vote at elections, numbered about 2,000 in 1690, rising to over 3,300 by the mid-1730s. With growth partly the result of political manipulation, their numbers did at one point reach one-third of the adult male population.{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}} This was notoriously the age of [[rotten borough|\"rotten\"]] and [[pocket borough|\"pocket\"]] boroughs, and Norwich was unusual in having such a high proportion of its citizens able to vote. \"Of the political centres where the Jacobin propaganda had penetrated most deeply only Norwich and Nottingham had a franchise deep enough to allow radicals to make use of the electoral process.\"{{sfn |Thompson |1968 |p=513}} \"Apart from London, Norwich was probably still the largest of those boroughs which were democratically governed,\" says {{harvnb |Jewson |1975}}, describing other towns under the control of a single [[fief]]dom. In Norwich, he says, a powerful Anglican establishment, symbolised by the Cathedral and the great church of St Peter Mancroft was matched by scarcely less powerful [[wikt:congeries|congeries]] of Dissenters headed by the wealthy literate body [of Unitarians] worshipping at the [[Octagon Chapel, Norwich|Octagon Chapel]].{{sfn |Jewson |1975}}\n\n[[File:Map of Norwich 1781.jpg|thumb|Map of Norwich 1781]]\nIn the middle of political disorders of the late 18th century, Norwich intellectual life flourished. It contained one, so far unmentioned aspect: [[Harriet Martineau]] wrote of the city's ''literati'' of the period, including such people as [[William Taylor (scholar)|William Taylor]], one of England's first scholars of German. The city \"boasted of her intellectual supper-parties, where, amidst a pedantry which would now make laughter hold both his sides, there was much that was pleasant and salutary: and finally she called herself ''The Athens of England''.\"{{sfn |Martineau |1869}}\n\n[[File:St Peter Mancroft.jpg|thumb|[[St Peter Mancroft]]]]\nDespite Norwich's hitherto industrial prosperity, the wool trade was experiencing intense competition by the 1790s, from Yorkshire woollens and increasingly from Lancashire cottons. The effects were aggravated by the loss of continental markets after Britain went to war with France in 1793.{{efn |1={{harvnb |Hayes |1958}} Quote: \"a major city manufacturer, and government supporter, Robert Harvey Jr as writing on 12 March 1793: 'The consequences of this just and inevitable war visit this poor city severely and suspend the operations of the Dutch, German and Italian trade and the only lingering employment in the manufactory is the completion of a few Russian orders, and the last China [[camlet|cambletts]] which I hope will find encouragement in the new East India Charter. This languid trade has doubled our poor rate and a voluntary subscription of above \u00a32,000 is found inadequate to the exigencies of the poor.\"}} The early 19th century saw de-industrialisation accompanied by bitter squabbles. The 1820s were marked by wage cuts and personal recrimination against owners. So amid the rich commercial and cultural heritage of its recent past, Norwich suffered in the 1790s from incipient decline exacerbated by a serious trade recession.\n\nAs early in the war as 1793, a major city manufacturer and government supporter, Robert Harvey, complained of low order books, languid trade and doubling of the poor rate.{{efn |1=Quotations and facts from {{harvtxt |Wilson |2004b}}}} Like many of their Norwich forebears, the hungry poor took their complaints onto the streets. Hayes describes a meeting of 200 people in a Norwich public house, where \"Citizen Stanhope\" spoke.{{efn|1=Lord Stanhope was a radical peer, seen by many at the time as a dangerous menace. He is said to have given his rabble-rousing speech in a Norwich public house in 1794.}} The gathering \"[roared its] applause at Stanhope's declaration that the Ministers, unless they changed their policy, deserved to have their heads brought to the block; \u2013 and if there was a people still in England, the event might turn out to be so.\" Hayes says that \"the outbreak of war, in bringing the worsted manufacture almost to a standstill and so plunging the mass of the Norwich weavers into sudden distress made it almost inevitable that a crude appeal to working-class resentment should take the place of a temperate process of education which the earliest reformers had intended.\"{{sfn |Hayes |1958 |pp=242\u2013243}}\n\nAt this period opposition to Pitt's government and their war came \u2013 in their case almost unanimously \u2013 from a circle of radical Dissenting intellectuals of interest in their own right They included the Rigby, Taylor, Aitkin, Barbold, and Alderson families \u2013 all Unitarians, and some of the Quaker Gurneys, one of whose girls, Elizabeth, was under her married name of Fry to be noted campaigner for prison reform. Their activities included visits to revolutionary France (before the execution of Louis XVI), the earliest British research into German literature, studies on medical science, petitioning for parliamentary reform, and publishing a highbrow literary magazine called \"The Cabinet\", in 1795. Their blend of politics, religion and social campaigning was suspicious to Pitt and Windham, causing Pitt to denounce Norwich as \"the Jacobin city\". Edmund Burke attacked John Gurney in print for sponsoring anti-war protests. Politics aside, it is safe to say that Norwich was the most active intellectual hotbed outside London in the 1790s, and did not retrieve comparable prominence until the University of East of Anglia arrived in the late 20th century.<ref>Sources: C. B. Jewson: ''Jacobin City''; I. Scott: ''Reactions to Radicalism in Norwich 1989\u20131802''; J. P.

In April that year, the Norwich Patriotic Society was founded, its manifesto declaring \"that the great end of civil society was general happiness; that every individual had a right to share in the government.\"{{sfn |Jewson |1975 |p=66}} In December the price of bread reached a new peak, and in May 1796, when William Windham was forced to seek re-election after his appointment as war secretary, he only just held his seat.{{efn |1=Before the 20th century it was the practice for a sitting member to seek re-election if appointed to ministerial office.}} Amid the disorder and violence so often in Norwich elections, it was only by the narrowest margin that the radical Bartlett Gurney (\"Peace and Gurney \u2013 No More War \u2013 No more Barley Bread\") failed to unseat him.{{sfn |Thompson |1994}}\n\nThough informed by issues of recent national importance, the bipartisan political culture of Norwich in the 1790s cannot be divorced from local tradition. Two features stand out from a political continuum of three centuries. The first is a dichotomous power balance. From at least the time of the Reformation, Norwich was recorded as a \"two-party city\". In the mid-16th century, the weaving parishes fell under the control of opposition forces, as Kett's rebels held the north of the river, in support of poor clothworkers. Indeed there seems to be a case for saying that with this tradition of two-sided disputation, the city had steadily developed an infrastructure, evident in its many cultural and institutional networks of politics, religion, society, news media and the arts, whereby argument could be managed short of outright confrontation. Indeed at a time of hunger and tension on the Norwich streets, with alehouse crowds ready to have \"a Minister's head brought to the block\", the Anglican and Dissenting clergy exerted themselves to conduct a collegiate dialogue, seeking common ground and reinforcing the well-mannered civic tradition of earlier periods.\n\n[[File:Surrey House on Surrey Street - geograph.org.uk - 22919.jpg|thumb|left|[[Surrey House]], historic headquarters of the Norwich Union insurance company]]\nIn 1797 [[Thomas Bignold]], a 36-year-old wine merchant and banker, founded the first [[Norwich Union|Norwich Union Society]]. Some years earlier, when he moved from Kent to Norwich, Bignold had been unable to find anyone willing to insure him against the threat from highwaymen. With the entrepreneurial thought that nothing was impossible, and aware that in a city built largely of wood the threat of fire was uppermost in people's minds, Bignold formed the \"Norwich Union Society for the Insurance of Houses, Stock and Merchandise from Fire\". The new business, which became known as the Norwich Union Fire Insurance Office, was a \"mutual\" enterprise. [[Aviva|Norwich Union]] was later to become the country's largest insurance giant.\n\nFrom earliest times Norwich was a textile centre. In the 1780s the manufacture of Norwich [[shawl]]s became an important industry<ref>[http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Research/Academic_Articles/Social_History/Norwich_Shawls/index.htm Norfolk Museums & Archaeology Service website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324192534/http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Research/Academic_Articles/Social_History/Norwich_Shawls/index.htm |date=24 March 2012}} \u2014 \"Norwich Shawls\"</ref> and remained so for nearly a hundred years. The shawls were a high-quality fashion product and rivalled those of other towns such as [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], which had entered shawl manufacturing in about 1805, some 20 or more years after Norwich. With changes in women's fashion in the later [[Victorian period]], the popularity of shawls declined and eventually manufacture ceased. Examples of Norwich shawls are now sought after by collectors of textiles.\n\nNorwich's geographical isolation was such that until 1845, when a railway link was established, it was often quicker to travel to [[Amsterdam]] by boat than to London. The railway was introduced to Norwich by [[Samuel Morton Peto|Morton Peto]], who also built a line to [[Great Yarmouth]]. From 1808 to 1814, Norwich had a station in the [[Semaphore line|shutter telegraph chain]] that connected the [[Admiralty]] in London to its naval ships in the port of [[Great Yarmouth]]. A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of [[Britannia Barracks]] in 1897.<ref name=museum>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rnrm.org.uk/web_trail/web_bar_02.html |title=Britannia Barracks |publisher=Royal Norfolk Regiment Museum |accessdate=9 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109225923/http://www.rnrm.org.uk/web_trail/web_bar_02.html |archive-date=9 November 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Bethel Street drill hall, Norwich|Bethel Street]] and [[Cattle Market Street drill hall, Norwich|Cattle Market Street]] [[drill hall]]s were built around the same time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Norfolk/TownNorwich.htm |title=Norwich |publisher=Drill halls project |accessdate=16 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813144606/http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Norfolk/TownNorwich.htm |archive-date=13 August 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Waterloo Park Norwich Herbaceous Border.JPG|thumb|Waterloo Park, one of six parks built during the 1930s to help alleviate unemployment in the city]]\nIn the early 20th century, Norwich still had several major manufacturing industries. Among them were the large-scale and bespoke manufacture of shoes (for example the [[Start-rite]] and Van Dal brands, Bowhill & Elliott and Cheney & Sons Ltd respectively), clothing, joinery (including the cabinet makers and furniture retailer [[Arthur Brett and Sons]], which continues in business in the 21st century), structural engineering, and aircraft design and manufacture. Notable employers included [[Boulton & Paul]], Barnards (ironfounders and inventors of machine-produced [[wire netting]]), and the electrical engineers Laurence Scott and Electromotors.\n\nNorwich also has a long association with chocolate making, mainly through the local firm of Caley's, which began as a manufacturer and bottler of mineral water and later diversified into chocolate and [[Christmas crackers]].

Caley's was acquired by Mackintosh in the 1930s, and merged with [[Rowntree's]] in 1969 to become Rowntree-Mackintosh. Finally it was bought by [[Nestl\u00e9]] and closed in 1996, with all operations moving to [[York]] after a Norwich association of 120 years.

However, the ten years between 1960 and 1970 completely altered the city, and significantly large areas of Norwich were cleared to make way for modern redevelopment.\n\nIn 1960, the inner-city district of Richmond, locally known as 'the Village on the Hill' was condemned as slums, and many residents were forced to leave due to [[compulsory purchase order]]s on the old terraces and lanes. The whole borough was demolished, which consisted of around 56 acres of existing streets, including 833 dwellings (612 considered unfit for human habitation), 42 shops, four offices, 22 public houses and two schools.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/derek-james/returning-to-the-lost-village-on-the-hill-in-old-norwich-1-1697965 |title=Returning to the lost \"village on the hill\" in old Norwich |last=James |first=Derek |work=Norwich Evening News |access-date=2018-08-30 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830110811/http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/derek-james/returning-to-the-lost-village-on-the-hill-in-old-norwich-1-1697965 |archive-date=30 August 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Communities were moved to high-rise buildings such as Normandie Tower and new housing estates such as the Tuckswood Estate, which were being built at the time. A new road, Rouen Road was developed in the area's place, which consists mainly of light industrial units and council flats. [[Ber Street, Norwich|Ber Street]], a once historical main road into the city had its whole eastern side demolished. The final part of St Peters Street (opposite [[St Peter Mancroft]] church), along with large Georgian townhouses at the top of Bethel Street were demolished to make way for the new City Library in 1961.<ref name=\"oldcity.org.uk\"/> This burnt down in April 1994 and was replaced in 2001 with [[The Forum, Norwich|The Forum]].\n\nMany more buildings were demolished during the construction of the inner ring-road, which saw an ancient road junction \u2013 Stump Cross with Tudor and Georgian buildings in Magdalen Street, Botolph Street, St George's Street and most notably Pitt Street \u2013 cleared to make way for a fly-over and [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] concrete shopping centre, [[Anglia Square Shopping Centre, Norwich|Anglia Square]] and office blocks such as HMSO building Sovereign House. Other areas affected by the ring-road were Grapes Hill, a once narrow lane lined with 19th-century workers cottages, which was cleared and widened into a dual carriageway leading into a roundabout. Shortly before construction of this roundabout, the city's old [[Chapel Field Road drill hall, Norwich|Drill Hall]] was demolished, along with sections of the original city wall and other larger townhouses along the start of Unthank Road (named after the Unthank family, who were local landowners).<ref>{{Cite web |last1=James |first1=Derek |title=The real story behind Unthank Road |url=https://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/norwich-golden-triangle-unthank-derek-james-1-5352280 |website=Evening News |access-date=25 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125184433/https://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/norwich-golden-triangle-unthank-derek-james-1-5352280 |archive-date=25 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The north-westerly corner of Chapelfield Gardens was also cut off to accommodate the new roundabout. About a mile of Georgian houses along Chapelfield Road and Queens Road; which included many houses that were built into the city walls, were bulldozed in 1964. This included the surrounding district off Vauxhall Street, consisting of swathes of terrace housing which were condemned as slums. Post-war housing and maisonettes flats now stand where the [[Rookery (slum)|Rookery slums]] once did. Some aspects of The '45 Plan were put into action, which saw large three-story Edwardian houses in Grove Avenue and Grove Road, and other large properties on Southwell Road, demolished in 1962 to make way for flat-roofed single-story style maisonettes that still stand today.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://norfolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/FULL/PICNOR/BIBENQ/155332801/2219614,5?FMT=IMG|title=Spydus - Image Display \u2013 Record 5 of 8 |website=Civica |publisher=Norfolk County Council |language=en |access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref> [[Heigham (Norwich)|Heigham]] Hall, a large Victorian manor house off Old Palace Road was also demolished in 1963, to build Dolphin Grove flats.\n\nOther housing developments in the private and public sector took place after the Second World War, partly to accommodate the growing population of the city and to replace condemned and bomb-damaged areas, such as the [[Heigham (Norwich)|Heigham Grove]] district between Barn Road and Old Palace Road, and West Pottergate off Dereham Road/Earlham Road. Other central streets such as St Stephens Street was widened, firstly by [[Norwich Union]]'s new office blocks and shortly after with new buildings, after it suffered extensive damage during the [[Baedeker Blitz|Baedeker raids]]. In Surrey Street, many six-storey Georgian buildings were demolished to make way for Norwich Union's office. Other notable buildings that were lost were three theatres, the Norwich Hippodrome on St Giles Street, which is now a multi-storey car park, the Grosvenor Rooms and Electric Theatre in Prince of Wales Road, the Corn Hall in Exchange Street, the Free Library in Duke Street and the Great Eastern Hotel, which faced [[Norwich railway station|Norwich Station]].

Prince of Wales Road in the city centre, running from the Riverside district near [[Norwich railway station]] to Norwich Castle, is home to many pubs, bars and clubs.\n\n===Media and film===\n[[File:A Saturday in Norwich (14998715671) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Anglia House, the headquarters of Anglia Television, today [[ITV Anglia]]]]\nNorwich is the headquarters of BBC East, its presence in the east of England, and [[BBC Radio Norfolk]], ''[[BBC Look East]]'', ''Inside Out'' and ''[[The Politics Show]]'' are all broadcast from BBC studios in The Forum. [[Independent radio]] stations based in Norwich include [[Heart Norwich|Heart]], [[Smooth Radio]], [[99.9 Radio Norwich]], and the University of East Anglia's Livewire 1350, an online station. A community station, [[Future Radio]], was launched on 6 August 2007.\n\n[[ITV Anglia]], formerly [[Anglia Television]], is based in Norwich. Although one of the smaller ITV companies, it supplied the network with some of its most popular shows such as ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'', ''[[Survival (TV series)|Survival]]'' and ''[[Sale of the Century (UK game show)|Sale of the Century]]'' (1971\u20131983), which began each edition with [[John Benson (announcer)|John Benson]]'s enthusiastic announcement: \"And now from Norwich, it's the quiz of the week!\" The company also had a subsidiary called Anglia Multimedia, which produced educational content on CD and DVD mainly for schools, and was one of the three companies, along with [[Granada TV]] and the [[BBC]] vying for the right to produce a digital television station for English schools and colleges.\n\nLaunched in 1959, Anglia Television lost its independence in 1994 following a takeover by [[Meridian Broadcasting]] and subsequent mergers have seen it reduced from a significant producer of programmes to a regional news centre. The company is still based in Anglia House, the former Norfolk and Norwich Agricultural Hall, on Agricultural Hall Plain near Prince of Wales Road. However, despite the contraction of Anglia, television production in Norwich has by no means ended. Anglia's former network production centre at Magdalen Street has been taken over by Norfolk County Council and extensively re-vamped. After a total investment of \u00a34&nbsp;million from the East of England Development Agency (EEDA) it has re-opened as Epic Studios (East of England Production Innovation Centre). Degree courses in film and video are also run at the centre by Norwich University of the Arts. Epic has commercial, broadcast quality post-production facilities, a real-time virtual studio and a smaller HD discussion studio. The main studio opened as an HD facility in November 2008. Throughout 2008, the centre has concentrated on the development of new TV formats and has worked on pilot shows with Les Dennis, Gaby Roslin and Christopher Biggins.\n\n[[Archant]] publishes two daily newspapers in Norwich, the ''[[Norwich Evening News]]'', and the regional ''[[Eastern Daily Press]]'' (EDP), and had its own television operation, [[Mustard TV]], which has now closed after being bought out by the [[That's TV]] group. Mustard TV is now [[That's Norfolk]].\n\nThe character of [[Alan Partridge]] in the sitcom ''[[I'm Alan Partridge]]'' (1997\u20132002) and the comedy film ''[[Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa]]'' (2013) is a Norwich broadcaster played by [[Steve Coogan]].\n\n===Esoteric associations===\nBecause Norwich was England's second city during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it has, though little acknowledged, a number of significant associations with [[esoteric]] spirituality. It was the home of [[William Cuningham]], a physician who published ''An Invective Epistle in Defense of Astrologers'' in 1560.<ref>Bryan's Dictionary of Painters and Engravers by Michael Bryan, edited by Robert Edmund Graves and Sir Walter Armstrong, an 1886\u20131889 publication now in the public domain</ref> The [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] dramatist [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]], author of [[Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay]], was born in Norwich in 1558.

Many influential esoteric books-titles are listed as once in Browne's [[Library of Sir Thomas Browne#Esoteric|library]].<ref>Catalogue of the libraries of Sir Thomas Browne and his son Edward Browne, edited with an introduction by J.

Translated from Latin it reads, ''Great Virtues, &hellip; sleeping here the dust of his [[spagyric]] body converts the lead to gold''. Browne is also a significant figure in the history of [[physiognomy]].\n\nThe [[Church of St John Maddermarket]]'s graveyard includes the Crabtree headstone, which has the pre-Christian symbol of the [[Ouroboros]] along with [[Masonic]] [[Square and Compasses]] carved upon it.

Notable examples of [[Secularity|secular]] medieval architecture are [[Dragon Hall, Norwich|Dragon Hall]], built in about 1430, and [[Norwich Guildhall|The Guildhall]], built 1407\u20131413, with later additions. From the 18th century, the pre-eminent local name is [[Thomas Ivory]], who built the Assembly Rooms (1776), the Octagon Chapel (1756), St Helen's House (1752) in the grounds of the [[Great Hospital]], and innovative speculative housing in Surrey Street (c. 1761). Ivory should not be confused with the Irish architect of the same name and similar period.\n\nThe 19th century saw an explosion in Norwich's size and much of its housing stock, as well as commercial building in the city centre, dates from this period. The local architect of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] periods who has continued to command most critical respect was [[George Skipper]] (1856\u20131948). Examples of his work include the headquarters of [[Norwich Union]] on Surrey Street; the [[Art Nouveau]] Royal Arcade; and the Hotel de Paris in the nearby seaside town of [[Cromer]]. The [[neo-Gothic]] Roman Catholic [[St John the Baptist Cathedral, Norwich|cathedral]] dedicated to [[St John the Baptist]] on [[Earlham Road]], begun in 1882, is by [[George Gilbert Scott Junior]] and his brother, [[John Oldrid Scott]].\n\nThe city continued to grow through the 20th century, and much housing, particularly in areas further out from the city centre, dates from that century. The first notable building post-Skipper was the [[City Hall, Norwich|City Hall]] by CH James and SR Pierce, opened in 1938; at the same time, they moved the [[Norwich War Memorial|City War Memorial]], designed by [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]], to sit in a memorial garden between the city hall and the market place. Bombing during the Second World War, while resulting in relatively little loss of life, caused significant damage to the housing stock in the city centre. Much of the postwar replacement stock was designed by the local-authority architect, David Percival. However, the major postwar development in Norwich from an architectural point of view was the opening of the [[University of East Anglia]] in 1964. Originally designed by [[Denys Lasdun]] (his design was never completely executed), it has been added to over subsequent decades by major names such as [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] and [[Rick Mather]].\n\n<gallery heights=\"132\" mode=\"packed\">\nNorwichcathedral2.jpg|Norwich Cathedral lies close to Tombland in the city centre.\nElmHill.jpg|[[Elm Hill, Norwich|Elm Hill]] is an intact medieval street.\nCowtower.jpg|[[Cow Tower, Norwich|Cow Tower]] stands on the banks of the River Wensum.\nGentlemanswalk.JPG|The varying styles of architecture along Gentleman's Walk\n</gallery>\n\n===Parks, gardens and open spaces===\n[[File:Riverside Flats Norwich - geograph.org.uk - 73621.jpg|thumb|Riverside flats Norwich]]\n''See also [[List of parks, gardens and open spaces in Norwich]]''\n\nChapelfield Gardens in central Norwich became the city's first [[public park]] in November 1880.

In the 2018\u20132019 season it finished first in the second tier of English football, the Championship, earning promotion to the Premier League for the 2019-2020 season. Majority-owned by celebrity chef [[Delia Smith]] and her husband Michael Wynn-Jones, its ground is the [[Carrow Road|Carrow Road Stadium]]. It has a strong [[East Anglian Derby|East Anglian rivalry]] with [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. The club has enjoyed considerable success in the past, having played in the top division regularly since 1972, its longest spell being a nine-year run from 1986 to 1995. It has also won two [[Football League Cup]]s and finished third in the inaugural [[Premier League]] in 1993. Norwich City FC was relegated two years later and did not reclaim its top-flight place for nine years, going down again after just one season, only to return in 2011 after two successive promotions.\n\nPerhaps Norwich City's most famous result to date came later in 1993, when it eliminated the German giants [[Bayern Munich]] from the [[UEFA Cup]], in what is to date its only season in European competitions; it had qualified for the UEFA Cup three times between 1985 and 1989 but they were unable to compete as there was a ban on English clubs in European competitions at the time. Before emerging as a top division club, it famously eliminated [[Manchester United FC|Manchester United]] from the FA Cup in 1959, and went on to reach the semi-finals of the domestic cup competition, a run it achieved again in 1989 and most recently in 1992. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the club produced some of the most highly rated talent of that era, including striker [[Chris Sutton]], winger [[Ruel Fox]], defender [[Andy Linighan]], midfielder [[Mike Phelan]], midfielder [[Tim Sherwood]] and striker [[Justin Fashanu]].

The first permanent supply started in 1893 from a generating station in Duke Street. This supplied electricity to local industry and domestic users and, from 1900, the [[Norwich Electric Tramways]]. In the late 1920s a new 40 MW power station was built at Thorpe, this was expanded in 1937 with the addition of a 30 MW \u2018high pressure\u2019 generating plant. These power stations operated until 1975.\u00a0 A gas turbine plant was installed in 1964 to provide power at times of peak demand. This closed in 1986 and the entire Thorpe power station site was demolished and cleared in 1981\u20131982. Two tall electricity pylons stood near the site until they were dismantled in 2017.

City, farewell: I mourn thy cruel fate''.\n\n[[Thomas Fuller]] in his ''The Worthies of England'' described the City in 1662 as:\n: ''Either a city in an orchard or an orchard in a city, so equally are houses and trees blended in it, so that the pleasure of the country and the populousness of the city meet here together. Yet in this mixture, the inhabitants participate nothing of the rusticalness of the one, but altogether the urbanity and civility of the other''.\n\n[[Celia Fiennes]] (1662\u20131741) visited Norwich in 1698 and described it as\n: '' a city walled full round of towers, except on the river side which serves as a wall; they seem the best in repair of any walled city I know''. She also records that three times a year the city held:\n: ''great fairs. &hellip; to which resort a vast concourse of people and wares a full trade'', Norwich being ''a rich, thriving industrious place full of weaving, knitting and dyeing''.\n\n[[Daniel Defoe]] in his ''Tour of the whole Island of Great Britain'' (1724) wrote:\n: ''the inhabitants being all busy at their manufactures, dwell in their garrets at their looms, in their combing-shops, so they call them, twisting-mills, and other work-houses; almost all the works they are employed in being done within doors''.\n\n[[John Evelyn]] (1620\u20131706), royalist, traveller and diarist, wrote to [[Sir Thomas Browne]]:\n: '' I hear Norwich is a place very much addicted to the flowery part''. He visited the City as a courtier to [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1671 and described it thus:\n: ''The suburbs are large, the prospect sweet, and other amenities, not omitting the flower-garden, which all the Inhabitants excel in of this City, the fabric of stuffs, which affords the Merchants, and brings a vast trade to this populous Town''.\n[[James Woodforde]] (1740\u20131803), clergyman, on his first visit to Norwich, wrote in his Diary on 14 April 1775:\n\n: ''We took a walk over the City in the morning, and we both agreed that it was the finest City in England by far, in the center of it is a high Hill and on that a prodigious large old Castle almost perfect and forms a compleat square, round it is a fine Terrass Walk which commands the whole City. There are in the City 36 noble Churches mostly built with flint, besides many meeting Houses of divers sorts. A noble River runs almost thro the Center of the City. The City walls are also very perfect and all round the City but where the River is. On the Hills round the City stand many Wind Mills about a dozen, to be seen from Castle Mount''.\n[[George Borrow]] in his semi-autobiographical novel [[Lavengro]] (1851) wrote of Norwich as:\n: ''A fine old city, perhaps the most curious specimen at present extant of the genuine old English Town &hellip;.There it spreads from north to south, with its venerable houses, its numerous gardens, its thrice twelve churches, its mighty mound....There is an old grey castle on top of that mighty mound: and yonder rising three hundred feet above the soil, from amongst those noble forest trees, behold that old Norman master-work, that cloud-enriched cathedral spire.... Now who can wonder that the children of that fine old city are proud, and offer up prayers for her prosperity?''\n\nBorrow wrote far less favourably of the City in his translation of [[Faust]]:\n: ''They found the people of the place modelled after so unsightly a pattern, with such ugly figures and flat features that the devil owned he had never seen them equalled, except by the inhabitants of an English town, called Norwich, when dressed in their Sunday's best''.\n\nIn 1812, Andrew Robertson wrote to the painter [[Constable]]:\n: ''I arrived here a week ago and find it a place where the arts are very much cultivated &hellip; some branches of knowledge, chemistry, botany, etc. are carried to a great length.

According to a local rhyme, the demise of ''Venta Icenorum'' led to the development of Norwich: \"Caistor was a city when Norwich was none, Norwich was built of Caistor stone.\"{{sfn |Morley |2006}}\n\n===Early English and Norman conquest===\n[[File:Norwich Cathedral, spire and south transept.jpg|thumb|[[Norwich Cathedral]] is one of the great Norman buildings of England.]]\nThere are two suggested models of development for Norwich. It is possible that three separate early Anglo-Saxon settlements, one north of the river and two either side on the south, joined together as they grew or that one Anglo-Saxon settlement, north of the river, emerged in the mid-7th century after the abandonment of the previous three. The ancient city was a thriving centre for trade and commerce in East Anglia in 1004 when it was raided and burnt by [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Swein Forkbeard]] the [[Viking]] king of Denmark. [[Mercia]]n coins and shards of pottery from the [[Rhineland]] dating from the 8th century suggest that long-distance trade was happening long before this. Between 924 and 939, Norwich became fully established as a town, with its own mint. The word ''Norvic'' appears on coins across Europe minted during this period, in the reign of [[Athelstan|King Athelstan]]. The Vikings were a strong cultural influence in Norwich for 40 to 50 years at the end of the 9th century, setting up an [[Anglo-Scandinavian]] district near the north end of present-day King Street. At the time of the [[Norman Conquest]], the city was one of the largest in England. The [[Domesday Book]] states that it had approximately 25 churches and a population of between 5,000 and 10,000. It also records the site of an Anglo-Saxon church in Tombland, the site of the Saxon market place and the later [[Norwich Cathedral|Norman cathedral]]. Norwich continued to be a major centre for trade, the River Wensum being a convenient export route to the [[River Yare]] and [[Great Yarmouth]], which served as the [[Port of Norwich|port for Norwich]]. [[Quern stone]]s and other artefacts from Scandinavia and the Rhineland have been found during excavations in Norwich city centre. These date from the 11th century onwards.\n\n[[File:Norwich Castle.jpg|thumb|[[Norwich Castle]]'s 12th-century keep]]\n[[Norwich Castle]] was founded soon after the Norman Conquest.<ref>{{PastScape |mnumber=132268 |mname=Norwich Castle |accessdate=29 December 2010}}</ref> The [[Domesday Book]] records that 98 Saxon homes were demolished to make way for the castle.{{sfn |Harfield |1991 |pp=373, 384}} The [[Normans]] established a new focus of settlement around the Castle and the area to the west of it: this became known as the \"New\" or \"French\" borough, centred on the Normans' own market place, which survives today as Norwich Market. In 1096, [[Herbert de Losinga]], [[Bishop of Thetford]], began construction of [[Norwich Cathedral]]. The chief building material for the Cathedral was limestone, imported from Caen in Normandy. To transport the building stone to the site, a canal was cut from the river (from the site of present-day Pulls Ferry) up to the east wall. Herbert de Losinga then moved his [[Episcopal see|See]] there, to what became the cathedral church for the [[Anglican Diocese of Norwich|Diocese of Norwich]]. The Bishop of Norwich still signs himself ''Norvic''. Norwich received a [[royal charter]] from [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] in 1158, and another from [[Richard I of England|Richard ''the Lionheart'']] in 1194.

The Great Hospital dates from 1249 and the College of St Mary in the Field from 1250. In 1256, Whitefriars was founded. In 1266 the city was sacked by the \"Disinherited\". It has the distinction of being the only English city ever to be excommunicated, following a riot between citizens and monks in 1274.{{sfn |Blomefield |1806}} As a penance, St Ethelbert's Gate, one of the entrances to the cathedral priory, was constructed by Norwich citizens. In 1278 the Cathedral received final consecration. In 1290 the city flooded. Austin Friary was founded in that year.\n\nThe engine of trade was [[wool]] from Norfolk's [[sheepwalk]]s. Wool made England rich, and the [[staple right|staple port]] of Norwich \"in her state doth stand With towns of high'st regard the fourth of all the land\", as [[Michael Drayton]] noted in ''[[Poly-Olbion]]'' (1612). The wealth generated by the [[wool#History|wool trade]] throughout the [[Middle Ages]] financed the construction of many fine churches, so that Norwich still has more medieval churches than any other city in Western Europe north of the [[Alps]]. Throughout this period Norwich established wide-ranging trading links with other parts of Europe, its markets stretching from [[Scandinavia]] to Spain and the city housing a [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] warehouse. To organise and control its exports to the [[Low Countries]], Great Yarmouth, as the port for Norwich, was designated one of the staple ports under the terms of the 1353 [[Statute of the Staple]].\n\nFrom 1280 to 1340 the [[defensive wall|city walls]] were built. At around {{convert|2 + 1/2|mi|km|}}, these walls, along with the river, enclosed a larger area than that of the [[City of London]]. However, when the city walls were constructed it was made illegal to build outside them, inhibiting expansion of the city. Around this time, the city was made a [[county corporate]] and became the seat of one of the most densely populated and prosperous [[ancient counties of England|counties]] of England. Part of these walls remain standing today.\n\n===Early modern period (1485\u20131640)===\nHand-in-hand with the wool industry, this key religious centre experienced a Reformation significantly different to other parts of England.

Unlike popular challenges elsewhere in the Tudor period, it appears to have been [[Protestant]] in nature. For several weeks, rebels led by [[Robert Kett]] camped outside Norwich on [[Mousehold Heath]] and took control of the city on 29 July 1549 with the support of many of its poorer inhabitants. [[Kett's Rebellion]] was particularly in response to the enclosure of land by landlords, leaving peasants with nowhere to graze their animals and the general abuses of power by the nobility. The uprising ended on 27 August when the rebels were defeated by an army. Kett was convicted of treason and hanged from the walls of Norwich Castle.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.britainexpress.com/History/tudor/ketts-rebellion.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708183620/https://www.britainexpress.com/History/tudor/ketts-rebellion.htm |archive-date=8 July 2019 |url-status=live |title=Kett's Rebellion, 1549 |website=Passionate about British Heritage |publisher=Britain Express |first=David |last=Ross }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/robert_ket_and_the_norfolk_risin.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913132214/http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/robert_ket_and_the_norfolk_risin.htm |archive-date=13 September 2018 |url-status=live |title=Robert Ket and the Norfolk Rising }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |first=Jon |last=McGregor |date=20 May 2019 |department=Travel |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/may/20/radicalism-rebellion-and-robert-kett-a-walk-through-norwichs-history |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708183615/https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/may/20/radicalism-rebellion-and-robert-kett-a-walk-through-norwichs-history |archive-date=8 July 2019 |url-status=live |title=Radicalism, rebellion and Robert Kett: a walk through Norwich's history }}</ref>\n\nUnusually in England, the rebellion divided the city and appears to have linked Protestantism with the plight of the urban poor. In the case of Norwich, this process was underscored later by the arrival of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Flemish people|Flemish]] \"[[Elizabethan Strangers|Strangers]]\" fleeing persecution from the Catholics and eventually numbering as many as one-third of the city's population.{{sfn |Houlbroke |McClendon |2004 |p=257}} Large numbers of such exiles came to the city, especially Flemish Protestants from the Westkwartier (\"Western Quarter\"), a region in the [[Southern Netherlands]] where the first [[Calvinist]] fires of the [[Dutch Revolt]] had spread. Inhabitants of [[Ypres]], in particular, chose Norwich above other destinations.{{sfn |Fagel |2003 |p=52}} Perhaps in response to Kett, Norwich became the first provincial city to initiate compulsory payments for a civic scheme of poor relief, which it has been claimed led to its wider introduction, forming the basis of the later Elizabethan Poor Law of 1597\u20131598.{{sfn |Pound |2004 |pp=50\u201356}}\n\nNorwich has traditionally been the home of various minorities, notably French [[Huguenot]] and Belgian [[Walloons|Walloon]] communities in the 16th and 17th centuries. The great \"stranger\" immigration of 1567 brought a substantial Flemish and Walloon community of Protestant [[weaver (occupation)|weaver]]s to Norwich, where they are said to have been made welcome.{{sfn |Ketton-Cremer |1957}} The merchant's house which was their earliest base in the city \u2014 now a museum \u2014 is still known as [[Strangers' Hall]]. It seems that the strangers integrated into the local community without much animosity, at least among the business fraternity, who had the most to gain from their skills. Their arrival in Norwich boosted trade with mainland Europe and fostered a movement toward religious reform and radical politics in the city. By contrast, after being persecuted by the Anglican church for his [[Puritan]] beliefs, [[Michael Metcalf (puritan)|Michael Metcalf]], a 17th-century Norwich weaver, fled the city and settled in [[Dedham, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=A New England Town |last=Lockridge |first=Kenneth |year=1985 |publisher=W.

Along with their advanced techniques in textile working, they brought pet canaries which they began to breed locally; eventually becoming, in the 20th century, a mascot of the city and the emblem of its football club, [[Norwich City F.C.]], whose nickname is \"The Canaries\". \n\nPrinting was introduced to the city in 1567 by Anthony de Solempne, one of the strangers, but it did not take root and had died out by about 1572.{{sfn |Stoker |1981}}\n\n===Civil War to Victorian era===\nAcross the Eastern Counties, [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s powerful [[Eastern Association]] was eventually dominant. However, to begin with, there had been a large element of Royalist sympathy within Norwich, which seems to have experienced a continuity of its two-sided political tradition throughout the period. Bishop [[Matthew Wren]] was a forceful supporter of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Nonetheless, [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] recruitment took hold. The strong Royalist party was stifled by a lack of commitment from the aldermen and isolation from Royalist-held regions.{{sfn |Hopper |2004}} Serious inter-factional disturbances culminated in \"The Great Blow\" of 1648 when Parliamentary forces tried to quell a Royalist riot. The latter's gunpowder was set off by accident in the city centre, causing mayhem. According to Hopper<ref>{{harvnb |Hopper |2004}},</ref> the explosion \"ranks among the largest of the century\". Stoutly defended though East Anglia was by the Parliamentary army, there are said to have been pubs in Norwich where the king's health was still drunk and the name of the Protector sung to ribald verse.\n\nAt the cost of some discomfort to the Mayor, the moderate [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]] was targeted because of his position as Bishop of Norwich.\n\nNorwich was marked in the period after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] of 1660 and the ensuing century by a golden age of its cloth industry, comparable only to those in the [[West Country]] and Yorkshire.{{sfn |Wilson |2004a}} But unlike other cloth-manufacturing regions, Norwich weaving brought greater urbanisation, mainly concentrated in the surrounds of the city itself, creating an urban society, with features such as leisure time, alehouses and other public forums of debate and argument.{{sfn |Wilson |2004b}}\n\n[[File:Original Norfolk and Norwich Hospital - geograph.org.uk - 84361.jpg|thumb|Founded in 1771, the [[Norfolk and Norwich Hospital]] cared for the city's poor and sick. It closed in 2003 after services were moved to the [[Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital]].]]\nWriting of the early 18th century, Pound describes the city's rich cultural life, the winter theatre season, the festivities accompanying the summer assizes, and other popular entertainments. Norwich was the wealthiest town in England, with a sophisticated system of [[poor relief]], and a large influx of foreign refugees.{{sfn |Pound |2004 |p=61}} Despite severe outbreaks of plague, the city had a population of almost 30,000. This made Norwich unique in England, although there were some 50 cities of similar size in Europe. In some, like Lyon and [[Dresden]], this was, as in the case of Norwich, linked to an important proto-industry, such as textiles or china pottery, in some, such as Vienna, Madrid and Dublin, to the city's status as an administrative capital, and in some such as Antwerp, Marseilles and Cologne to a position on an important maritime or river trade route.{{efn|1=For table of city sizes see {{harvtxt |Corfield |2004 |p=143}}}}\n\nNorwich in the late 17th century was riven politically. Churchman [[Humphrey Prideaux]] described \"two factions, [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] and [[Tory]], and both contend for their way with the utmost violence.\"{{sfn |Knights |2004}} Nor did the city accept the outcome of the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]] with a unified voice. The pre-eminent citizen, Bishop William Lloyd, would not take the oaths of allegiance to the new monarchs. One report has it that in 1704 the landlord of Fowler's alehouse \"with a glass of beer in hand, went down on his knees and drank a health to James the third, wishing the Crowne [sic] well and settled on his head.\"{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174 |quote= \"Never was a city in the miserable kingdom so wretchedly divided as this,\" said the ''London Post''}}\n\nIn 1716, at a play at the ''New Inn'', the Pretender was cheered and the audience booed and hissed every time King George's name was mentioned. In 1722 supporters of the king were said to be \"hiss'd at and curst as they go in the streets,\" and in 1731 \"a Tory mobb, in a great body, went through several parts of this city, in a riotous manner, cursing and abusing such as they knew to be friends of the government.\"{{efn |1=Reports quoted by {{harvnb |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}}}} But the Whigs gradually gained control and by the 1720s they had successfully petitioned Parliament to allow all adult males working in the textile industry to take up the freedom, on the correct assumption that they would vote Whig. But it had the effect of boosting the city's popular Jacobitism, says Knights, and contests of the kind described continued in Norwich well into a period in which political stability had been discerned at a national level. The city's Jacobitism perhaps only ended with 1745, well after it had ceased to be a significant movement outside Scotland.{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}} Despite the Highlanders reaching Derby and Norwich citizens mustering themselves into an association to protect the city, some Tories refused to join in, and the vestry of [[St Peter Mancroft]] resolved that it would not ring its bells to summon the defence. Still, it was the end of the road for Norwich Jacobites, and the Whigs organised a notable celebration after the [[Battle of Culloden]].{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}}\n\nThe events of this period illustrate how Norwich had a strong tradition of popular protest favouring Church and Stuarts and attached to the street and alehouse. Knights tells how in 1716 the mayoral election had ended in a riot, with both sides throwing \"brick-ends and great paving stones\" at each other.{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}} A renowned Jacobite watering-hole, the ''Blue Bell Inn'' (nowadays ''The Bell Hotel''), owned in the early 18th century by the high-church Helwys family, became the central rendezvous of the Norwich Revolution Society in the 1790s.{{sfn |Jewson |1975 |p=38}}\n\nBritain's first provincial newspaper, the ''[[Norwich Post]]'', appeared in 1701. By 1726 there were rival Whig and Tory presses, and as early as mid-century, three-quarters of the males in some parishes were literate.{{efn |1=Quoted by {{harvnb |Knights |2004 |pp=181\u2013182}}}} The Norwich municipal library claims an excellent collection of these newspapers, also a folio collection of scrapbooks on 18th-century Norwich politics, which Knights says are \"valuable and important\". Norwich alehouses had 281 clubs and societies meeting in them in 1701, and at least 138 more were formed before 1758. The [[Theatre Royal, Norwich|Theatre Royal]] opened in 1758, alongside the city's stage productions in inns and puppet shows in rowdy alehouses.{{sfn |Chandler |1998}}{{sfn |Blackwell |Blackwell |2007 |loc=Chap 2}} In 1750 Norwich could boast nine booksellers and after 1780 a \"growing number of circulating and subscription libraries\".{{sfn |Dain |2004}} {{harvnb |Knights |2004}} says: \"[All this] made for a lively political culture, in which independence from governmental lines was particularly strong, evident in campaigns against the war with America and for reform... in which trade and the impact of war with [[Revolutionary France]] were key ingredients. The open and contestable structure of local government, the press, the clubs and societies, and dissent all ensured that politics overlapped with communities bound by economics, religion, ideology and print in a world in which public opinion could not be ignored.\"{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}}\n\n[[File:OctagonChapel.JPG|thumb|left|The Octagon Chapel]]\nAmid this metropolitan culture, the city burghers had built a sophisticated political structure. Freemen, who had the right to trade and to vote at elections, numbered about 2,000 in 1690, rising to over 3,300 by the mid-1730s. With growth partly the result of political manipulation, their numbers did at one point reach one-third of the adult male population.{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}} This was notoriously the age of [[rotten borough|\"rotten\"]] and [[pocket borough|\"pocket\"]] boroughs, and Norwich was unusual in having such a high proportion of its citizens able to vote. \"Of the political centres where the Jacobin propaganda had penetrated most deeply only Norwich and Nottingham had a franchise deep enough to allow radicals to make use of the electoral process.\"{{sfn |Thompson |1968 |p=513}} \"Apart from London, Norwich was probably still the largest of those boroughs which were democratically governed,\" says {{harvnb |Jewson |1975}}, describing other towns under the control of a single [[fief]]dom. In Norwich, he says, a powerful Anglican establishment, symbolised by the Cathedral and the great church of St Peter Mancroft was matched by scarcely less powerful [[wikt:congeries|congeries]] of Dissenters headed by the wealthy literate body [of Unitarians] worshipping at the [[Octagon Chapel, Norwich|Octagon Chapel]].{{sfn |Jewson |1975}}\n\n[[File:Map of Norwich 1781.jpg|thumb|Map of Norwich 1781]]\nIn the middle of political disorders of the late 18th century, Norwich intellectual life flourished. It contained one, so far unmentioned aspect: [[Harriet Martineau]] wrote of the city's ''literati'' of the period, including such people as [[William Taylor (scholar)|William Taylor]], one of England's first scholars of German. The city \"boasted of her intellectual supper-parties, where, amidst a pedantry which would now make laughter hold both his sides, there was much that was pleasant and salutary: and finally she called herself ''The Athens of England''.\"{{sfn |Martineau |1869}}\n\n[[File:St Peter Mancroft.jpg|thumb|[[St Peter Mancroft]]]]\nDespite Norwich's hitherto industrial prosperity, the wool trade was experiencing intense competition by the 1790s, from Yorkshire woollens and increasingly from Lancashire cottons. The effects were aggravated by the loss of continental markets after Britain went to war with France in 1793.{{efn |1={{harvnb |Hayes |1958}} Quote: \"a major city manufacturer, and government supporter, Robert Harvey Jr as writing on 12 March 1793: 'The consequences of this just and inevitable war visit this poor city severely and suspend the operations of the Dutch, German and Italian trade and the only lingering employment in the manufactory is the completion of a few Russian orders, and the last China [[camlet|cambletts]] which I hope will find encouragement in the new East India Charter. This languid trade has doubled our poor rate and a voluntary subscription of above \u00a32,000 is found inadequate to the exigencies of the poor.\"}} The early 19th century saw de-industrialisation accompanied by bitter squabbles. The 1820s were marked by wage cuts and personal recrimination against owners. So amid the rich commercial and cultural heritage of its recent past, Norwich suffered in the 1790s from incipient decline exacerbated by a serious trade recession.\n\nAs early in the war as 1793, a major city manufacturer and government supporter, Robert Harvey, complained of low order books, languid trade and doubling of the poor rate.{{efn |1=Quotations and facts from {{harvtxt |Wilson |2004b}}}} Like many of their Norwich forebears, the hungry poor took their complaints onto the streets. Hayes describes a meeting of 200 people in a Norwich public house, where \"Citizen Stanhope\" spoke.{{efn|1=Lord Stanhope was a radical peer, seen by many at the time as a dangerous menace. He is said to have given his rabble-rousing speech in a Norwich public house in 1794.}} The gathering \"[roared its] applause at Stanhope's declaration that the Ministers, unless they changed their policy, deserved to have their heads brought to the block; \u2013 and if there was a people still in England, the event might turn out to be so.\" Hayes says that \"the outbreak of war, in bringing the worsted manufacture almost to a standstill and so plunging the mass of the Norwich weavers into sudden distress made it almost inevitable that a crude appeal to working-class resentment should take the place of a temperate process of education which the earliest reformers had intended.\"{{sfn |Hayes |1958 |pp=242\u2013243}}\n\nAt this period opposition to Pitt's government and their war came \u2013 in their case almost unanimously \u2013 from a circle of radical Dissenting intellectuals of interest in their own right They included the Rigby, Taylor, Aitkin, Barbold, and Alderson families \u2013 all Unitarians, and some of the Quaker Gurneys, one of whose girls, Elizabeth, was under her married name of Fry to be noted campaigner for prison reform. Their activities included visits to revolutionary France (before the execution of Louis XVI), the earliest British research into German literature, studies on medical science, petitioning for parliamentary reform, and publishing a highbrow literary magazine called \"The Cabinet\", in 1795. Their blend of politics, religion and social campaigning was suspicious to Pitt and Windham, causing Pitt to denounce Norwich as \"the Jacobin city\". Edmund Burke attacked John Gurney in print for sponsoring anti-war protests. Politics aside, it is safe to say that Norwich was the most active intellectual hotbed outside London in the 1790s, and did not retrieve comparable prominence until the University of East of Anglia arrived in the late 20th century.<ref>Sources: C.

In April that year, the Norwich Patriotic Society was founded, its manifesto declaring \"that the great end of civil society was general happiness; that every individual had a right to share in the government.\"{{sfn |Jewson |1975 |p=66}} In December the price of bread reached a new peak, and in May 1796, when William Windham was forced to seek re-election after his appointment as war secretary, he only just held his seat.{{efn |1=Before the 20th century it was the practice for a sitting member to seek re-election if appointed to ministerial office.}} Amid the disorder and violence so often in Norwich elections, it was only by the narrowest margin that the radical Bartlett Gurney (\"Peace and Gurney \u2013 No More War \u2013 No more Barley Bread\") failed to unseat him.{{sfn |Thompson |1994}}\n\nThough informed by issues of recent national importance, the bipartisan political culture of Norwich in the 1790s cannot be divorced from local tradition. Two features stand out from a political continuum of three centuries. The first is a dichotomous power balance. From at least the time of the Reformation, Norwich was recorded as a \"two-party city\". In the mid-16th century, the weaving parishes fell under the control of opposition forces, as Kett's rebels held the north of the river, in support of poor clothworkers. Indeed there seems to be a case for saying that with this tradition of two-sided disputation, the city had steadily developed an infrastructure, evident in its many cultural and institutional networks of politics, religion, society, news media and the arts, whereby argument could be managed short of outright confrontation. Indeed at a time of hunger and tension on the Norwich streets, with alehouse crowds ready to have \"a Minister's head brought to the block\", the Anglican and Dissenting clergy exerted themselves to conduct a collegiate dialogue, seeking common ground and reinforcing the well-mannered civic tradition of earlier periods.\n\n[[File:Surrey House on Surrey Street - geograph.org.uk - 22919.jpg|thumb|left|[[Surrey House]], historic headquarters of the Norwich Union insurance company]]\nIn 1797 [[Thomas Bignold]], a 36-year-old wine merchant and banker, founded the first [[Norwich Union|Norwich Union Society]]. Some years earlier, when he moved from Kent to Norwich, Bignold had been unable to find anyone willing to insure him against the threat from highwaymen. With the entrepreneurial thought that nothing was impossible, and aware that in a city built largely of wood the threat of fire was uppermost in people's minds, Bignold formed the \"Norwich Union Society for the Insurance of Houses, Stock and Merchandise from Fire\". The new business, which became known as the Norwich Union Fire Insurance Office, was a \"mutual\" enterprise. [[Aviva|Norwich Union]] was later to become the country's largest insurance giant.\n\nFrom earliest times Norwich was a textile centre. In the 1780s the manufacture of Norwich [[shawl]]s became an important industry<ref>[http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Research/Academic_Articles/Social_History/Norwich_Shawls/index.htm Norfolk Museums & Archaeology Service website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324192534/http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Research/Academic_Articles/Social_History/Norwich_Shawls/index.htm |date=24 March 2012}} \u2014 \"Norwich Shawls\"</ref> and remained so for nearly a hundred years. The shawls were a high-quality fashion product and rivalled those of other towns such as [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], which had entered shawl manufacturing in about 1805, some 20 or more years after Norwich. With changes in women's fashion in the later [[Victorian period]], the popularity of shawls declined and eventually manufacture ceased. Examples of Norwich shawls are now sought after by collectors of textiles.\n\nNorwich's geographical isolation was such that until 1845, when a railway link was established, it was often quicker to travel to [[Amsterdam]] by boat than to London. The railway was introduced to Norwich by [[Samuel Morton Peto|Morton Peto]], who also built a line to [[Great Yarmouth]]. From 1808 to 1814, Norwich had a station in the [[Semaphore line|shutter telegraph chain]] that connected the [[Admiralty]] in London to its naval ships in the port of [[Great Yarmouth]]. A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of [[Britannia Barracks]] in 1897.<ref name=museum>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rnrm.org.uk/web_trail/web_bar_02.html |title=Britannia Barracks |publisher=Royal Norfolk Regiment Museum |accessdate=9 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109225923/http://www.rnrm.org.uk/web_trail/web_bar_02.html |archive-date=9 November 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Bethel Street drill hall, Norwich|Bethel Street]] and [[Cattle Market Street drill hall, Norwich|Cattle Market Street]] [[drill hall]]s were built around the same time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Norfolk/TownNorwich.htm |title=Norwich |publisher=Drill halls project |accessdate=16 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813144606/http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Norfolk/TownNorwich.htm |archive-date=13 August 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Waterloo Park Norwich Herbaceous Border.JPG|thumb|Waterloo Park, one of six parks built during the 1930s to help alleviate unemployment in the city]]\nIn the early 20th century, Norwich still had several major manufacturing industries.

This was in fact significantly under the actual amount, and the highest number of pubs in the city was in the year 1870, with over 780 beer-houses. A Licensing Act in 1872, had several detrimental effects for landlords and customers, with the total number of pubs dropping to 634.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} A \"Drink Map\" was produced in 1892 by the Norwich and Norfolk Gospel Temperance Union, which showed 631 pubs in and around the city centre and surrounding districts. By 1900, the number had dropped to 441 pubs within the City Walls. The title of a pub for every day of the year survived until 1966, when the Chief Constable informed the Licensing Justices that only 355 licences were still operative{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}, with the number slowly shrinking, as over 25 have closed in the last decade.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/the-city-of-pubs-but-more-than-25-have-closed-in-the-past-decade-1-5176681 |title=The city of pubs \u2013 but more than 25 have closed in the past decade |last=Betts |first=Marc |work=Eastern Daily Press |access-date=2018-08-29 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830041430/http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/the-city-of-pubs-but-more-than-25-have-closed-in-the-past-decade-1-5176681 |archive-date=30 August 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> As of 2018, around 100 pubs still trade in the city centre and surrounding areas.\n\n====Nazi bombing of Norwich====\n{{main|Norwich Blitz}}\nNorwich suffered extensive bomb damage during World War II, affecting large parts of the old city centre and Victorian terrace housing around the centre. Industry and the rail infrastructure also suffered. The heaviest raids occurred on the nights of 27/28 and 29/30 April 1942; as part of the [[Baedeker raids]] (so-called because Baedeker's series of tourist guides to the [[British Isles]] were used to select propaganda-rich targets of cultural and historic significance rather than strategic importance). [[Lord Haw-Haw]] made reference to the imminent destruction of Norwich's new [[City Hall, Norwich|City Hall]] (completed in 1938), although in the event it survived unscathed. Significant targets hit included the Morgan's Brewery building, [[Colman's]] [[Wincarnis]] works, [[Norwich City railway station|City Station]], the Mackintosh chocolate factory, and shopping areas including St Stephen's St and St Benedict's St, the site of Bond's [[department store]] (now [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]]) and Curl's department store.\n\n229 citizens were killed in the two [[Baedeker Blitz|Baedeker raids]] with 1000 others injured, and 340 by bombing throughout the war\u2014giving Norwich the highest air raid casualties in Eastern England. Out of the 35,000 domestic dwellings in Norwich, 2,000 were destroyed, and another 27,000 suffered some damage.<ref name=\"oldcity.org.uk\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.oldcity.org.uk/norwich/history/history09.php |title=A History of Norwich - 20th Century Norwich |website=www.oldcity.org.uk |access-date=2018-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205074817/http://www.oldcity.org.uk/norwich/history/history09.php |archive-date=5 February 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 1945 the city was also the intended target of a brief V2 rocket campaign, though all these missed the city.

However, the ten years between 1960 and 1970 completely altered the city, and significantly large areas of Norwich were cleared to make way for modern redevelopment.\n\nIn 1960, the inner-city district of Richmond, locally known as 'the Village on the Hill' was condemned as slums, and many residents were forced to leave due to [[compulsory purchase order]]s on the old terraces and lanes. The whole borough was demolished, which consisted of around 56 acres of existing streets, including 833 dwellings (612 considered unfit for human habitation), 42 shops, four offices, 22 public houses and two schools.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/derek-james/returning-to-the-lost-village-on-the-hill-in-old-norwich-1-1697965 |title=Returning to the lost \"village on the hill\" in old Norwich |last=James |first=Derek |work=Norwich Evening News |access-date=2018-08-30 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830110811/http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/derek-james/returning-to-the-lost-village-on-the-hill-in-old-norwich-1-1697965 |archive-date=30 August 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Communities were moved to high-rise buildings such as Normandie Tower and new housing estates such as the Tuckswood Estate, which were being built at the time. A new road, Rouen Road was developed in the area's place, which consists mainly of light industrial units and council flats. [[Ber Street, Norwich|Ber Street]], a once historical main road into the city had its whole eastern side demolished. The final part of St Peters Street (opposite [[St Peter Mancroft]] church), along with large Georgian townhouses at the top of Bethel Street were demolished to make way for the new City Library in 1961.<ref name=\"oldcity.org.uk\"/> This burnt down in April 1994 and was replaced in 2001 with [[The Forum, Norwich|The Forum]].\n\nMany more buildings were demolished during the construction of the inner ring-road, which saw an ancient road junction \u2013 Stump Cross with Tudor and Georgian buildings in Magdalen Street, Botolph Street, St George's Street and most notably Pitt Street \u2013 cleared to make way for a fly-over and [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] concrete shopping centre, [[Anglia Square Shopping Centre, Norwich|Anglia Square]] and office blocks such as HMSO building Sovereign House. Other areas affected by the ring-road were Grapes Hill, a once narrow lane lined with 19th-century workers cottages, which was cleared and widened into a dual carriageway leading into a roundabout. Shortly before construction of this roundabout, the city's old [[Chapel Field Road drill hall, Norwich|Drill Hall]] was demolished, along with sections of the original city wall and other larger townhouses along the start of Unthank Road (named after the Unthank family, who were local landowners).<ref>{{Cite web |last1=James |first1=Derek |title=The real story behind Unthank Road |url=https://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/norwich-golden-triangle-unthank-derek-james-1-5352280 |website=Evening News |access-date=25 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125184433/https://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/norwich-golden-triangle-unthank-derek-james-1-5352280 |archive-date=25 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The north-westerly corner of Chapelfield Gardens was also cut off to accommodate the new roundabout. About a mile of Georgian houses along Chapelfield Road and Queens Road; which included many houses that were built into the city walls, were bulldozed in 1964. This included the surrounding district off Vauxhall Street, consisting of swathes of terrace housing which were condemned as slums. Post-war housing and maisonettes flats now stand where the [[Rookery (slum)|Rookery slums]] once did. Some aspects of The '45 Plan were put into action, which saw large three-story Edwardian houses in Grove Avenue and Grove Road, and other large properties on Southwell Road, demolished in 1962 to make way for flat-roofed single-story style maisonettes that still stand today.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://norfolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/FULL/PICNOR/BIBENQ/155332801/2219614,5?FMT=IMG|title=Spydus - Image Display \u2013 Record 5 of 8 |website=Civica |publisher=Norfolk County Council |language=en |access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref> [[Heigham (Norwich)|Heigham]] Hall, a large Victorian manor house off Old Palace Road was also demolished in 1963, to build Dolphin Grove flats.\n\nOther housing developments in the private and public sector took place after the Second World War, partly to accommodate the growing population of the city and to replace condemned and bomb-damaged areas, such as the [[Heigham (Norwich)|Heigham Grove]] district between Barn Road and Old Palace Road, and West Pottergate off Dereham Road/Earlham Road. Other central streets such as St Stephens Street was widened, firstly by [[Norwich Union]]'s new office blocks and shortly after with new buildings, after it suffered extensive damage during the [[Baedeker Blitz|Baedeker raids]]. In Surrey Street, many six-storey Georgian buildings were demolished to make way for Norwich Union's office. Other notable buildings that were lost were three theatres, the Norwich Hippodrome on St Giles Street, which is now a multi-storey car park, the Grosvenor Rooms and Electric Theatre in Prince of Wales Road, the Corn Hall in Exchange Street, the Free Library in Duke Street and the Great Eastern Hotel, which faced [[Norwich railway station|Norwich Station]]. It has been said that more of Norwich's architecture was destroyed but by the council in post-war redevelopment schemes than during the Second World War.\n\n====Other events====\nIn 1976 the city's pioneering spirit was on show when Motum Road in Norwich, allegedly the scene of \"a number of accidents over the years\", became the third road in Britain to be equipped with [[sleeping policemen]], intended to encourage adherence to the road's {{convert|30|mph|km/h}} speed limit.<ref name=Autocar197605>{{Cite journal |journal=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] |volume=144 |issue=4147 |authorlink=Peter Garnier (Ed)|title=News: Humps \u2013 another road |page=2 |date=1 May 1976}}</ref> The bumps, installed at intervals of 50 and 150 yards, stretched 12 feet across the width of the road and their curved profile was, at its highest point, {{convert|4|inch|cm}} high.<ref name=Autocar197605/> The responsible [[Transport Research Laboratory|quango]] gave an assurance that the experimental devices would be removed not more than one year after installation.<ref name=Autocar197605/>\n\nFrom 1980 to 1985 the city became a frequent focus of national media due to squatting in [[Argyle Street, Norwich|Argyle Street]], a Victorian street that was demolished in 1986, despite being the last street to survive the Richmond Hill redevelopment.

The [[Theatre Royal, Norwich|Theatre Royal]] is the largest and has been on its present site for nearly 250 years, through several rebuildings and many alterations. It has 1,300 seats and hosts a mix of national touring productions including musicals, dance, drama, family shows, stand-up comedians, opera and pop.\n\nThe [[Maddermarket Theatre]] opened in 1921 as the first permanent recreation of an [[Elizabethan theatre]]. The founder was [[Nugent Monck]] who had worked with [[William Poel]]. The theatre is a [[Shakespearean]]-style playhouse and has a [[seating capacity]] of 310. [[Norwich Puppet Theatre]] was founded in 1979 by Ray and Joan DaSilva as a permanent base for their touring company and was first opened as a public venue in 1980, following the conversion of the medieval church of St. James in the heart of Norwich. Under subsequent artistic directors \u2014 Barry Smith and Luis Z. Boy \u2014 the theatre established its current pattern of operation. It is a nationally unique venue dedicated to puppetry, and currently houses a 185-seat raked auditorium, the 50-seat Octagon Studio, workshops, an exhibition gallery, shop and licensed bar. It is the only theatre in the Eastern region with a year-round programme of family-centred entertainment. [[Norwich Arts Centre]] theatre opened in 1977 in St Benedict's Street, and has a capacity of 290. The [[Norwich Playhouse]], which opened in 1995 and has a [[seating capacity]] of 300, is a venue in the heart of the city and one of the most modern performance spaces of its size in East Anglia.\n\nThe Garage studio theatre can seat up to 110 people in a range of layouts. It can also be used for standing events to accommodate up to 180 people. Platform Theatre is in the grounds of the City College Norwich. Productions are staged mainly during the autumn and summer months. The theatre is raked and seats about 250 people. On 20 April 2012, the theatre held a large relaunch event with an evening performance, show-casing it at its best with previews of upcoming performances and scenes from some of its past performances.<ref>[http://www.ccn.ac.uk/news/new-building-boost-creative-arts-city-college-norwich City College Norwich] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406070519/http://www.ccn.ac.uk/news/new-building-boost-creative-arts-city-college-norwich |date=6 April 2012}} Retrieved 23 March 2012</ref>\n\nThe Whiffler Theatre was built in 1981 and was given to the people of Norwich by the local newspaper group Eastern Daily Press. It is an open-air facility in Norwich Castle Gardens, with fixed-raked seating for up to 80 people and standing for another 30 on the balcony. The stage is brick-built and has its dressing-rooms set in a small building to stage left. The Whiffler mainly plays host to small Shakespeare productions. [[Sewell Barn Theatre]] is the smallest theatre in Norwich and has a [[seating capacity]] of just 100. The auditorium features raked seating on three sides of an open acting space. This unusual staging helps to draw the audience closer into the performance.\n\nPublic performance spaces include the Forum in the city centre, which has a large open-air [[amphitheatre]], hosting performances of many types throughout the year. Additionally, the [[cloister]]s of Norwich Cathedral are used for open-air performances as part of an annual Shakespeare festival.<ref>[http://www.cathedral.org.uk/whats-on/shakespeare-in-the-cloisters-2013-tour.aspx Shakespeare in the cloisters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121155413/http://www.cathedral.org.uk/whats-on/shakespeare-in-the-cloisters-2013-tour.aspx |date=21 January 2013}} Retrieved 13 December 2012</ref>\n\n===Museums===\nNorwich has a number of important museums which reflect the rich history of the city and of Norfolk, as well as wider interests.

Prince of Wales Road in the city centre, running from the Riverside district near [[Norwich railway station]] to Norwich Castle, is home to many pubs, bars and clubs.\n\n===Media and film===\n[[File:A Saturday in Norwich (14998715671) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Anglia House, the headquarters of Anglia Television, today [[ITV Anglia]]]]\nNorwich is the headquarters of BBC East, its presence in the east of England, and [[BBC Radio Norfolk]], ''[[BBC Look East]]'', ''Inside Out'' and ''[[The Politics Show]]'' are all broadcast from BBC studios in The Forum. [[Independent radio]] stations based in Norwich include [[Heart Norwich|Heart]], [[Smooth Radio]], [[99.9 Radio Norwich]], and the University of East Anglia's Livewire 1350, an online station. A community station, [[Future Radio]], was launched on 6 August 2007.\n\n[[ITV Anglia]], formerly [[Anglia Television]], is based in Norwich. Although one of the smaller ITV companies, it supplied the network with some of its most popular shows such as ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'', ''[[Survival (TV series)|Survival]]'' and ''[[Sale of the Century (UK game show)|Sale of the Century]]'' (1971\u20131983), which began each edition with [[John Benson (announcer)|John Benson]]'s enthusiastic announcement: \"And now from Norwich, it's the quiz of the week!\" The company also had a subsidiary called Anglia Multimedia, which produced educational content on CD and DVD mainly for schools, and was one of the three companies, along with [[Granada TV]] and the [[BBC]] vying for the right to produce a digital television station for English schools and colleges.\n\nLaunched in 1959, Anglia Television lost its independence in 1994 following a takeover by [[Meridian Broadcasting]] and subsequent mergers have seen it reduced from a significant producer of programmes to a regional news centre. The company is still based in Anglia House, the former Norfolk and Norwich Agricultural Hall, on Agricultural Hall Plain near Prince of Wales Road. However, despite the contraction of Anglia, television production in Norwich has by no means ended. Anglia's former network production centre at Magdalen Street has been taken over by Norfolk County Council and extensively re-vamped. After a total investment of \u00a34&nbsp;million from the East of England Development Agency (EEDA) it has re-opened as Epic Studios (East of England Production Innovation Centre). Degree courses in film and video are also run at the centre by Norwich University of the Arts. Epic has commercial, broadcast quality post-production facilities, a real-time virtual studio and a smaller HD discussion studio. The main studio opened as an HD facility in November 2008. Throughout 2008, the centre has concentrated on the development of new TV formats and has worked on pilot shows with Les Dennis, Gaby Roslin and Christopher Biggins.\n\n[[Archant]] publishes two daily newspapers in Norwich, the ''[[Norwich Evening News]]'', and the regional ''[[Eastern Daily Press]]'' (EDP), and had its own television operation, [[Mustard TV]], which has now closed after being bought out by the [[That's TV]] group.

It was the home of [[William Cuningham]], a physician who published ''An Invective Epistle in Defense of Astrologers'' in 1560.<ref>Bryan's Dictionary of Painters and Engravers by Michael Bryan, edited by Robert Edmund Graves and Sir Walter Armstrong, an 1886\u20131889 publication now in the public domain</ref> The [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] dramatist [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]], author of [[Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay]], was born in Norwich in 1558.

Many influential esoteric books-titles are listed as once in Browne's [[Library of Sir Thomas Browne#Esoteric|library]].<ref>Catalogue of the libraries of Sir Thomas Browne and his son Edward Browne, edited with an introduction by J.

Translated from Latin it reads, ''Great Virtues, &hellip; sleeping here the dust of his [[spagyric]] body converts the lead to gold''. Browne is also a significant figure in the history of [[physiognomy]].\n\nThe [[Church of St John Maddermarket]]'s graveyard includes the Crabtree headstone, which has the pre-Christian symbol of the [[Ouroboros]] along with [[Masonic]] [[Square and Compasses]] carved upon it.

Notable examples of [[Secularity|secular]] medieval architecture are [[Dragon Hall, Norwich|Dragon Hall]], built in about 1430, and [[Norwich Guildhall|The Guildhall]], built 1407\u20131413, with later additions. From the 18th century, the pre-eminent local name is [[Thomas Ivory]], who built the Assembly Rooms (1776), the Octagon Chapel (1756), St Helen's House (1752) in the grounds of the [[Great Hospital]], and innovative speculative housing in Surrey Street (c. 1761). Ivory should not be confused with the Irish architect of the same name and similar period.\n\nThe 19th century saw an explosion in Norwich's size and much of its housing stock, as well as commercial building in the city centre, dates from this period. The local architect of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] periods who has continued to command most critical respect was [[George Skipper]] (1856\u20131948). Examples of his work include the headquarters of [[Norwich Union]] on Surrey Street; the [[Art Nouveau]] Royal Arcade; and the Hotel de Paris in the nearby seaside town of [[Cromer]]. The [[neo-Gothic]] Roman Catholic [[St John the Baptist Cathedral, Norwich|cathedral]] dedicated to [[St John the Baptist]] on [[Earlham Road]], begun in 1882, is by [[George Gilbert Scott Junior]] and his brother, [[John Oldrid Scott]].\n\nThe city continued to grow through the 20th century, and much housing, particularly in areas further out from the city centre, dates from that century. The first notable building post-Skipper was the [[City Hall, Norwich|City Hall]] by CH James and SR Pierce, opened in 1938; at the same time, they moved the [[Norwich War Memorial|City War Memorial]], designed by [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]], to sit in a memorial garden between the city hall and the market place. Bombing during the Second World War, while resulting in relatively little loss of life, caused significant damage to the housing stock in the city centre. Much of the postwar replacement stock was designed by the local-authority architect, David Percival. However, the major postwar development in Norwich from an architectural point of view was the opening of the [[University of East Anglia]] in 1964. Originally designed by [[Denys Lasdun]] (his design was never completely executed), it has been added to over subsequent decades by major names such as [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] and [[Rick Mather]].\n\n<gallery heights=\"132\" mode=\"packed\">\nNorwichcathedral2.jpg|Norwich Cathedral lies close to Tombland in the city centre.\nElmHill.jpg|[[Elm Hill, Norwich|Elm Hill]] is an intact medieval street.\nCowtower.jpg|[[Cow Tower, Norwich|Cow Tower]] stands on the banks of the River Wensum.\nGentlemanswalk.JPG|The varying styles of architecture along Gentleman's Walk\n</gallery>\n\n===Parks, gardens and open spaces===\n[[File:Riverside Flats Norwich - geograph.org.uk - 73621.jpg|thumb|Riverside flats Norwich]]\n''See also [[List of parks, gardens and open spaces in Norwich]]''\n\nChapelfield Gardens in central Norwich became the city's first [[public park]] in November 1880.

In the 2018\u20132019 season it finished first in the second tier of English football, the Championship, earning promotion to the Premier League for the 2019-2020 season. Majority-owned by celebrity chef [[Delia Smith]] and her husband Michael Wynn-Jones, its ground is the [[Carrow Road|Carrow Road Stadium]]. It has a strong [[East Anglian Derby|East Anglian rivalry]] with [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. The club has enjoyed considerable success in the past, having played in the top division regularly since 1972, its longest spell being a nine-year run from 1986 to 1995. It has also won two [[Football League Cup]]s and finished third in the inaugural [[Premier League]] in 1993. Norwich City FC was relegated two years later and did not reclaim its top-flight place for nine years, going down again after just one season, only to return in 2011 after two successive promotions.\n\nPerhaps Norwich City's most famous result to date came later in 1993, when it eliminated the German giants [[Bayern Munich]] from the [[UEFA Cup]], in what is to date its only season in European competitions; it had qualified for the UEFA Cup three times between 1985 and 1989 but they were unable to compete as there was a ban on English clubs in European competitions at the time. Before emerging as a top division club, it famously eliminated [[Manchester United FC|Manchester United]] from the FA Cup in 1959, and went on to reach the semi-finals of the domestic cup competition, a run it achieved again in 1989 and most recently in 1992. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the club produced some of the most highly rated talent of that era, including striker [[Chris Sutton]], winger [[Ruel Fox]], defender [[Andy Linighan]], midfielder [[Mike Phelan]], midfielder [[Tim Sherwood]] and striker [[Justin Fashanu]]. The club's most successful managers have included [[Kenneth Brown (footballer born 1934)|Ken Brown]], [[Ron Saunders]], [[Dave Stringer]], [[Mike Walker (Welsh footballer)|Mike Walker]], [[Nigel Worthington]] and [[Paul Lambert]].\n\nThe city's second club, [[Norwich United FC|Norwich United]] (which is based in [[Blofield]] some {{convert|5|mi|km}} east of the city), along with [[Norwich CBS FC|Norwich CBS]], plays in the [[Eastern Counties Football League|Eastern Counties League]].

City, farewell: I mourn thy cruel fate''.\n\n[[Thomas Fuller]] in his ''The Worthies of England'' described the City in 1662 as:\n: ''Either a city in an orchard or an orchard in a city, so equally are houses and trees blended in it, so that the pleasure of the country and the populousness of the city meet here together. Yet in this mixture, the inhabitants participate nothing of the rusticalness of the one, but altogether the urbanity and civility of the other''.\n\n[[Celia Fiennes]] (1662\u20131741) visited Norwich in 1698 and described it as\n: '' a city walled full round of towers, except on the river side which serves as a wall; they seem the best in repair of any walled city I know''. She also records that three times a year the city held:\n: ''great fairs. &hellip; to which resort a vast concourse of people and wares a full trade'', Norwich being ''a rich, thriving industrious place full of weaving, knitting and dyeing''.\n\n[[Daniel Defoe]] in his ''Tour of the whole Island of Great Britain'' (1724) wrote:\n: ''the inhabitants being all busy at their manufactures, dwell in their garrets at their looms, in their combing-shops, so they call them, twisting-mills, and other work-houses; almost all the works they are employed in being done within doors''.\n\n[[John Evelyn]] (1620\u20131706), royalist, traveller and diarist, wrote to [[Sir Thomas Browne]]:\n: '' I hear Norwich is a place very much addicted to the flowery part''. He visited the City as a courtier to [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1671 and described it thus:\n: ''The suburbs are large, the prospect sweet, and other amenities, not omitting the flower-garden, which all the Inhabitants excel in of this City, the fabric of stuffs, which affords the Merchants, and brings a vast trade to this populous Town''.\n[[James Woodforde]] (1740\u20131803), clergyman, on his first visit to Norwich, wrote in his Diary on 14 April 1775:\n\n: ''We took a walk over the City in the morning, and we both agreed that it was the finest City in England by far, in the center of it is a high Hill and on that a prodigious large old Castle almost perfect and forms a compleat square, round it is a fine Terrass Walk which commands the whole City. There are in the City 36 noble Churches mostly built with flint, besides many meeting Houses of divers sorts. A noble River runs almost thro the Center of the City. The City walls are also very perfect and all round the City but where the River is. On the Hills round the City stand many Wind Mills about a dozen, to be seen from Castle Mount''.\n[[George Borrow]] in his semi-autobiographical novel [[Lavengro]] (1851) wrote of Norwich as:\n: ''A fine old city, perhaps the most curious specimen at present extant of the genuine old English Town &hellip;.There it spreads from north to south, with its venerable houses, its numerous gardens, its thrice twelve churches, its mighty mound....There is an old grey castle on top of that mighty mound: and yonder rising three hundred feet above the soil, from amongst those noble forest trees, behold that old Norman master-work, that cloud-enriched cathedral spire.... Now who can wonder that the children of that fine old city are proud, and offer up prayers for her prosperity?''\n\nBorrow wrote far less favourably of the City in his translation of [[Faust]]:\n: ''They found the people of the place modelled after so unsightly a pattern, with such ugly figures and flat features that the devil owned he had never seen them equalled, except by the inhabitants of an English town, called Norwich, when dressed in their Sunday's best''.\n\nIn 1812, Andrew Robertson wrote to the painter [[Constable]]:\n: ''I arrived here a week ago and find it a place where the arts are very much cultivated &hellip; some branches of knowledge, chemistry, botany, etc. are carried to a great length. General literature seems to be pursued with an ardour which is astonishing when we consider that it does not contain a university, as is merely a manufacturing town.''\n\nIn 1962, [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Sir Nikolaus Pevsner]] stated in his North-West Norfolk and Norwich volume of ''[[The Buildings of England]]'' that:\n: ''Norwich is distinguished by a prouder sense of civic responsibility than any other town of about the same size in Britain.''\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:Thomas Browne statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of Sir [[Thomas Browne]] on Hay Hill, near to where he lived.

The classic account of the Shang comes from texts such as the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'' and ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''.  According to the traditional chronology based on calculations made approximately 2,000 years ago by [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]], the Shang ruled from 1766 to 1122&nbsp;BC, but according to the chronology based upon the \"current text\" of ''Bamboo Annals'', they ruled from 1556 to 1046&nbsp;BC. The [[Xia\u2013Shang\u2013Zhou Chronology Project]] dated them from c. 1600 to 1046&nbsp;BC based on the carbon 14 dates of the [[Erligang]] site.\n\nThe Shang dynasty is the earliest dynasty of traditional [[Chinese history]] firmly supported by archaeological evidence. Excavation at the [[Yinxu|Ruins of Yin]] (near modern-day [[Anyang]]), which has been identified as the last Shang capital, uncovered eleven major royal tombs and the foundations of palaces and ritual sites, containing weapons of war and remains from both animal and human sacrifices.  Tens of thousands of [[bronze]], [[jade]], [[stone]], [[bone]], and [[ceramic]] artifacts have been found.\n\nThe Anyang site has yielded the earliest known body of [[Written Chinese|Chinese writing]], mostly [[divination]]s inscribed on [[oracle bone]]s \u2013 turtle shells, ox [[scapula]]e, or other bones. More than 20,000 were discovered in the initial scientific excavations during the 1920s and 1930s, and over four times as many have been found since.  The inscriptions provide critical insight into many topics from the politics, economy, and religious practices to the art and medicine of this early stage of [[History of China|Chinese civilization]].{{sfnp|Keightley|2000 MRT forever\n\n==Traditional accounts==\nMany events concerning the Shang dynasty are mentioned in various [[Chinese classics]], including the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'' and the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]''.  Working from all the available documents, the [[Han dynasty]] historian [[Sima Qian]] assembled a sequential account of the Shang dynasty as part of his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''.  His history describes some events in detail, while in other cases only the name of a king is given.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|pp=233\u2013235}}  A closely related, but slightly different, account is given by the ''[[Bamboo Annals]]''.  The ''Annals'' were interred in 296&nbsp;BC, but the text has a complex history and the authenticity of the surviving versions is controversial.{{sfnp|Keightley|1978b}}\n\nThe name ''Y\u012bn'' (\u6bb7) is used by Sima Qian for the dynasty, and in the \"current text\" version of the ''Bamboo Annals'' for both the dynasty and its final capital. It has been a popular name for the Shang throughout history. Since the ''Records of Emperors and Kings'' by [[Huangfu Mi]] (3rd century AD), it has often been used specifically to describe the later half of the Shang dynasty. In Japan and Korea, the Shang are still referred to almost exclusively as the Yin (''In'') dynasty. However, it seems to have been a [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] name for the earlier dynasty.  The word does not appear in the oracle bones, which refer to the state as ''Sh\u0101ng'' (\u5546), and the capital as ''D\u00e0y\u00ec Sh\u0101ng'' (\u5927\u9091\u5546 \"Great Settlement Shang\").{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|p=232}}  It also does not appear in securely-dated Western Zhou bronze inscriptions.{{sfnp|Keightley|1978a|p=xiv}}\n\n===Founding myth===\nThe founding myth of the Shang dynasty is described by Sima Qian in the ''Annals of the Yin''.  In the text, a woman named [[Jiandi]] (\u7c21\u72c4), who was the second wife of [[Emperor Ku]], swallowed an egg dropped by a black bird (\u7384\u9ce5) and subsequently gave birth miraculously to [[Xie of Shang|Xie]] (\u5070) \u2014 also appearing as Qi (\u5951).  Xie is said to have helped [[Yu the Great]] to control the [[Great Flood (China)|Great Flood]] and for his service to have been granted a place called Shang as a fief.<ref>{{harvp|Keightley|1999|p=233}}, with additional details from the ''Historical Records''.</ref>\n\n===Dynastic course===\nIn the ''Annals of the Yin'', Sima Qian writes that the dynasty was founded 13 generations after [[Xie of Shang|Xie]], when Xie's descendant [[Tang of Shang|Tang]] overthrew the impious and cruel final [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] ruler in the [[Battle of Mingtiao]].  The ''Records'' recount events from the reigns of Tang, [[Tai Jia]], [[Tai Wu]], [[Pan Geng]], [[Wu Ding]], [[Wu Yi of Shang|Wu Yi]] and the depraved final king [[King Zhou of Shang|Di Xin]], but the rest of the Shang rulers are merely mentioned by name.  According to the ''Records'', the Shang moved their capital five times, with the final move to Yin in the reign of Pan Geng inaugurating the golden age of the dynasty.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|p=233}}\n\nDi Xin, the last Shang king, is said to have committed suicide after his army was defeated by [[King Wu of Zhou|Wu of Zhou]]. Legends say that his army and his equipped slaves betrayed him by joining the Zhou rebels in the decisive [[Battle of Muye]]. According to the ''[[Yi Zhou Shu]]'' and [[Mencius]] the battle was very bloody. The classic, [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]-era novel ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]'' retells the story of the war between Shang and Zhou as a conflict with rival factions of gods supporting different sides in the war.\n\nAfter the Shang were defeated, King Wu allowed Di Xin's son [[Wu Geng]] to rule the Shang as a [[vassal]] kingdom.  However, Zhou Wu sent three of his brothers and an army to ensure that Wu Geng would not rebel.<ref>[http://www.pkucn.com/redirect.php?tid=228246 \u90b6\u3001\u9118\u4e8c\u570b\u8003] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617081821/http://www.pkucn.com/redirect.php?tid=228246 |date=17 June 2011 }} (Bei, Yong two national test)</ref><ref>[http://ch.shvoong.com/humanities/1230377-%E5%91%A8%E5%88%9D-%E4%B8%89%E7%9B%91-%E4%B8%8E%E9%82%B6-%E9%84%98-%E5%8D%AB%E5%9C%B0%E6%9C%9B%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6/ \u5468\u521d\"\u4e09\u76d1\"\u4e0e\u90b6\u3001\u9118\u3001\u536b\u5730\u671b\u7814\u7a76] (Bei, Yong, Wei \u2013 looking at the research)</ref><ref>[http://www.csscipaper.com/chinahistory/xianqin/110612.html \"\u4e09\u76d1\"\u4eba\u7269\u7586\u5730\u53ca\u5176\u5730\u671b\u8fa8\u6790 \u2014\u2014\u517c\u8bba\u5eb7\u53d4\u7684\u59cb\u5c01\u5730\u95ee\u9898] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509022308/http://www.csscipaper.com/chinahistory/xianqin/110612.html |date=9 May 2011 }} (breaking ground on Kangshu problem)</ref> After Zhou Wu's death, the Shang joined the [[Rebellion of the Three Guards]] against the [[Duke of Zhou]], but the rebellion collapsed after three years, leaving Zhou in control of Shang territory.\n\n===Descendants of the Shang royal family===\nAfter Shang's collapse, Zhou's rulers forcibly relocated \"Yin diehards\" (\u6bb7\u9811) and scattered them throughout Zhou territory.<ref>[http://www.guoxue.com/jrxz/lztdzdxl/yuan231.htm \u4e00 \u88ab\u5265\u524a\u8005\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u578b] (Expoited by the presence of...)</ref> Some surviving members of the Shang royal family collectively changed their surname from the ancestral name Zi (\u5b50) to the name of their fallen dynasty, Yin.

Over time, court rituals to appease spirits developed, and in addition to his secular duties, the king would serve as the head of the [[ancestor worship]] cult. Often, the king would even perform oracle bone divinations himself, especially near the end of the dynasty. Evidence from excavations of the royal tombs indicates that royalty were buried with articles of value, presumably for use in the afterlife. Perhaps for the same reason, hundreds of commoners, who may have been [[Slavery|slave]]s, were buried alive with the royal corpse.\n\nA line of hereditary Shang kings ruled over much of northern China, and Shang troops fought frequent wars with neighboring settlements and nomadic herdsmen from the inner Asian [[steppe]]s. The Shang king, in his oracular divinations, repeatedly showed concern about the ''fang'' groups, the barbarians living outside of the civilized ''tu'' regions, which made up the center of Shang territory.{{Clarify|reason=are tu areas all of Shang or only the Shang heartland?|date=September 2010}}  In particular, the ''tufang'' group of the [[Yan Mountains|Yanshan]] region were regularly mentioned as hostile to the Shang.{{sfnp|Sun|2006}}\n\nApart from their role as the head military commanders, Shang kings also asserted their social supremacy by acting as the high priests of society and leading the divination ceremonies.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=14}} As the oracle bone texts reveal, the Shang kings were viewed as the best qualified members of society to offer sacrifices to their royal ancestors and to the high god [[Shangdi|Di]], who in their beliefs was responsible for the rain, wind, and thunder.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=14}}\n\nThe King appointed officials to manage certain activities, usually in a specified area. These included field (agricultural) officials \u7530, pastors \u7267, dog officers \u72ac (hunting), and guards \u885b. These officers led their own retinues in the conduct of their duties, and some grew more independent and emerged as rulers of their own.  There was a basic system of bureaucracy in place, with references to positions such as the \"Many Dog officers\", \"Many horse officers\", the \"Many Artisans\", the \"Many Archers\" or court titles like \"Junior Servitor for Cultivation\" or \"Junior Servitor for labourers\". More distant rulers were known as marquess \u4faf or count \u4f2f, who sometimes provided tribute and support to the Shang King in exchange for military aid and augury services. However these alliances were unstable, as indicated by the frequent royal divinations about the sustainability of such relations. {{sfnp|Keightley|1999|pp=272-273, 286}}\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Shang bronze masks, 16-14th.JPG|thumb|Chinese Shang dynasty bronze face masks, 16th\u201314th century BC]]\nShang religious rituals featured divination and sacrifice.  The degree to which [[shamanism]] was a central aspect of Shang religion is a subject of debate.{{sfnp|Chang|1994}}{{sfnp|Keightley|1998}}\n\nThere were six main recipients of sacrifice: (1) Di (the High God), (2) nature powers like the sun and mountain powers, (3) former lords, deceased humans who had been added to the dynastic pantheon, (4) pre-dynastic ancestors, (5) dynastic ancestors, and (6) royal wives who were ancestors of the present king.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|pp=253\u2013254}}\n\nThe Shang believed that their ancestors held power over them and performed divination rituals to secure their approval for planned actions.{{sfnp|Keightley|2004}}  Divination involved cracking a turtle carapace or ox scapula to answer a question, and to then record the response to that question on the bone itself.{{sfnp|Chang|1994}}  It is unknown what criteria the diviners used to determine the response, but it is believed to be the sound or pattern of the cracks on the bone. {{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe Shang also seem to have believed in an afterlife, as evidenced by the elaborate burial tombs built for deceased rulers.  Often \"carriages, utensils, sacrificial vessels, [and] weapons\" would be included in the tomb.{{sfnp|Smith|1961}}  A king's burial involved the burial of up to several hundred humans and horses as well to accompany the king into the afterlife, in some cases even numbering four hundred.{{sfnp|Smith|1961}}  Finally, tombs included ornaments such as jade, which the Shang may have believed to protect against decay or confer immortality.\n\nThe Shang religion was highly bureaucratic and meticulously ordered.  Oracle bones contained descriptions of the date, ritual, person, ancestor, and questions associated with the divination.{{sfnp|Chang|1994}}  Tombs displayed highly ordered arrangements of bones, with groups of skeletons laid out facing the same direction.\n\n===Bronze working===\n{{main|Chinese ritual bronzes}}\n[[File:Bronze square ding (cauldron) with human faces.jpg|thumb|right|Shang dynasty bronze vessel ding (sacrificial vessel)]]\nChinese bronze casting and pottery advanced during the Shang dynasty, with bronze typically being used for ritually significant, rather than primarily utilitarian, items.\nAs far back as c. 1500&nbsp;BC, the early Shang dynasty engaged in large-scale production of [[bronze]]-ware vessels and weapons.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=17}} This production required a large labor force that could handle the mining, refining, and transportation of the necessary [[copper]], [[tin]], and [[lead]] ores.

With the increased amount of bronze available, the army could also better equip itself with an assortment of bronze weaponry.

The classic account of the Shang comes from texts such as the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'' and ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''.  According to the traditional chronology based on calculations made approximately 2,000 years ago by [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]], the Shang ruled from 1766 to 1122&nbsp;BC, but according to the chronology based upon the \"current text\" of ''Bamboo Annals'', they ruled from 1556 to 1046&nbsp;BC. The [[Xia\u2013Shang\u2013Zhou Chronology Project]] dated them from c. 1600 to 1046&nbsp;BC based on the carbon 14 dates of the [[Erligang]] site.\n\nThe Shang dynasty is the earliest dynasty of traditional [[Chinese history]] firmly supported by archaeological evidence. Excavation at the [[Yinxu|Ruins of Yin]] (near modern-day [[Anyang]]), which has been identified as the last Shang capital, uncovered eleven major royal tombs and the foundations of palaces and ritual sites, containing weapons of war and remains from both animal and human sacrifices.  Tens of thousands of [[bronze]], [[jade]], [[stone]], [[bone]], and [[ceramic]] artifacts have been found.\n\nThe Anyang site has yielded the earliest known body of [[Written Chinese|Chinese writing]], mostly [[divination]]s inscribed on [[oracle bone]]s \u2013 turtle shells, ox [[scapula]]e, or other bones. More than 20,000 were discovered in the initial scientific excavations during the 1920s and 1930s, and over four times as many have been found since.  The inscriptions provide critical insight into many topics from the politics, economy, and religious practices to the art and medicine of this early stage of [[History of China|Chinese civilization]].{{sfnp|Keightley|2000}}\n\n==Traditional accounts==\nMany events concerning the Shang dynasty are mentioned in various [[Chinese classics]], including the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'' and the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]''.  Working from all the available documents, the [[Han dynasty]] historian [[Sima Qian]] assembled a sequential account of the Shang dynasty as part of his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''.  His history describes some events in detail, while in other cases only the name of a king is given.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|pp=233\u2013235}}  A closely related, but slightly different, account is given by the ''[[Bamboo Annals]]''.  The ''Annals'' were interred in 296&nbsp;BC, but the text has a complex history and the authenticity of the surviving versions is controversial.{{sfnp|Keightley|1978b}}\n\nThe name ''Y\u012bn'' (\u6bb7) is used by Sima Qian for the dynasty, and in the \"current text\" version of the ''Bamboo Annals'' for both the dynasty and its final capital. It has been a popular name for the Shang throughout history. Since the ''Records of Emperors and Kings'' by [[Huangfu Mi]] (3rd century AD), it has often been used specifically to describe the later half of the Shang dynasty. In Japan and Korea, the Shang are still referred to almost exclusively as the Yin (''In'') dynasty. However, it seems to have been a [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] name for the earlier dynasty.  The word does not appear in the oracle bones, which refer to the state as ''Sh\u0101ng'' (\u5546), and the capital as ''D\u00e0y\u00ec Sh\u0101ng'' (\u5927\u9091\u5546 \"Great Settlement Shang\").{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|p=232}}  It also does not appear in securely-dated Western Zhou bronze inscriptions.{{sfnp|Keightley|1978a|p=xiv}}\n\n===Founding myth===\nThe founding myth of the Shang dynasty is described by Sima Qian in the ''Annals of the Yin''.  In the text, a woman named [[Jiandi]] (\u7c21\u72c4), who was the second wife of [[Emperor Ku]], swallowed an egg dropped by a black bird (\u7384\u9ce5) and subsequently gave birth miraculously to [[Xie of Shang|Xie]] (\u5070) \u2014 also appearing as Qi (\u5951).  Xie is said to have helped [[Yu the Great]] to control the [[Great Flood (China)|Great Flood]] and for his service to have been granted a place called Shang as a fief.<ref>{{harvp|Keightley|1999|p=233}}, with additional details from the ''Historical Records''.</ref>\n\n===Dynastic course===\nIn the ''Annals of the Yin'', Sima Qian writes that the dynasty was founded 13 generations after [[Xie of Shang|Xie]], when Xie's descendant [[Tang of Shang|Tang]] overthrew the impious and cruel final [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] ruler in the [[Battle of Mingtiao]].  The ''Records'' recount events from the reigns of Tang, [[Tai Jia]], [[Tai Wu]], [[Pan Geng]], [[Wu Ding]], [[Wu Yi of Shang|Wu Yi]] and the depraved final king [[King Zhou of Shang|Di Xin]], but the rest of the Shang rulers are merely mentioned by name.  According to the ''Records'', the Shang moved their capital five times, with the final move to Yin in the reign of Pan Geng inaugurating the golden age of the dynasty.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|p=233}}\n\nDi Xin, the last Shang king, is said to have committed suicide after his army was defeated by [[King Wu of Zhou|Wu of Zhou]]. Legends say that his army and his equipped slaves betrayed him by joining the Zhou rebels in the decisive [[Battle of Muye]]. According to the ''[[Yi Zhou Shu]]'' and [[Mencius]] the battle was very bloody. The classic, [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]-era novel ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]'' retells the story of the war between Shang and Zhou as a conflict with rival factions of gods supporting different sides in the war.\n\nAfter the Shang were defeated, King Wu allowed Di Xin's son [[Wu Geng]] to rule the Shang as a [[vassal]] kingdom.  However, Zhou Wu sent three of his brothers and an army to ensure that Wu Geng would not rebel.<ref>[http://www.pkucn.com/redirect.php?tid=228246 \u90b6\u3001\u9118\u4e8c\u570b\u8003] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617081821/http://www.pkucn.com/redirect.php?tid=228246 |date=17 June 2011 }} (Bei, Yong two national test)</ref><ref>[http://ch.shvoong.com/humanities/1230377-%E5%91%A8%E5%88%9D-%E4%B8%89%E7%9B%91-%E4%B8%8E%E9%82%B6-%E9%84%98-%E5%8D%AB%E5%9C%B0%E6%9C%9B%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6/ \u5468\u521d\"\u4e09\u76d1\"\u4e0e\u90b6\u3001\u9118\u3001\u536b\u5730\u671b\u7814\u7a76] (Bei, Yong, Wei \u2013 looking at the research)</ref><ref>[http://www.csscipaper.com/chinahistory/xianqin/110612.html \"\u4e09\u76d1\"\u4eba\u7269\u7586\u5730\u53ca\u5176\u5730\u671b\u8fa8\u6790 \u2014\u2014\u517c\u8bba\u5eb7\u53d4\u7684\u59cb\u5c01\u5730\u95ee\u9898] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509022308/http://www.csscipaper.com/chinahistory/xianqin/110612.html |date=9 May 2011 }} (breaking ground on Kangshu problem)</ref> After Zhou Wu's death, the Shang joined the [[Rebellion of the Three Guards]] against the [[Duke of Zhou]], but the rebellion collapsed after three years, leaving Zhou in control of Shang territory.\n\n===Descendants of the Shang royal family===\nAfter Shang's collapse, Zhou's rulers forcibly relocated \"Yin diehards\" (\u6bb7\u9811) and scattered them throughout Zhou territory.<ref>[http://www.guoxue.com/jrxz/lztdzdxl/yuan231.htm \u4e00 \u88ab\u5265\u524a\u8005\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u578b] (Expoited by the presence of...)</ref> Some surviving members of the Shang royal family collectively changed their surname from the ancestral name Zi (\u5b50) to the name of their fallen dynasty, Yin. The family retained an aristocratic standing and often provided needed administrative services to the succeeding Zhou dynasty. The ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' states that [[King Cheng of Zhou]], with the support of his regent and uncle, the [[Duke of Zhou]], [[feoffment|enfeoffed]] Weiziqi (\u5fae\u5b50\u555f), a brother of Di Xin, as the Duke of [[Song (state)|Song]], with its capital at [[Shangqiu]].

These included field (agricultural) officials \u7530, pastors \u7267, dog officers \u72ac (hunting), and guards \u885b. These officers led their own retinues in the conduct of their duties, and some grew more independent and emerged as rulers of their own.  There was a basic system of bureaucracy in place, with references to positions such as the \"Many Dog officers\", \"Many horse officers\", the \"Many Artisans\", the \"Many Archers\" or court titles like \"Junior Servitor for Cultivation\" or \"Junior Servitor for labourers\". More distant rulers were known as marquess \u4faf or count \u4f2f, who sometimes provided tribute and support to the Shang King in exchange for military aid and augury services.

The degree to which [[shamanism]] was a central aspect of Shang religion is a subject of debate.{{sfnp|Chang|1994}}{{sfnp|Keightley|1998}}\n\nThere were six main recipients of sacrifice: (1) Di (the High God), (2) nature powers like the sun and mountain powers, (3) former lords, deceased humans who had been added to the dynastic pantheon, (4) pre-dynastic ancestors, (5) dynastic ancestors, and (6) royal wives who were ancestors of the present king.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|pp=253\u2013254}}\n\nThe Shang believed that their ancestors held power over them and performed divination rituals to secure their approval for planned actions.{{sfnp|Keightley|2004}}  Divination involved cracking a turtle carapace or ox scapula to answer a question, and to then record the response to that question on the bone itself.{{sfnp|Chang|1994}}  It is unknown what criteria the diviners used to determine the response, but it is believed to be the sound or pattern of the cracks on the bone. {{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe Shang also seem to have believed in an afterlife, as evidenced by the elaborate burial tombs built for deceased rulers.  Often \"carriages, utensils, sacrificial vessels, [and] weapons\" would be included in the tomb.{{sfnp|Smith|1961}}  A king's burial involved the burial of up to several hundred humans and horses as well to accompany the king into the afterlife, in some cases even numbering four hundred.{{sfnp|Smith|1961}}  Finally, tombs included ornaments such as jade, which the Shang may have believed to protect against decay or confer immortality.\n\nThe Shang religion was highly bureaucratic and meticulously ordered.  Oracle bones contained descriptions of the date, ritual, person, ancestor, and questions associated with the divination.{{sfnp|Chang|1994}}  Tombs displayed highly ordered arrangements of bones, with groups of skeletons laid out facing the same direction.\n\n===Bronze working===\n{{main|Chinese ritual bronzes}}\n[[File:Bronze square ding (cauldron) with human faces.jpg|thumb|right|Shang dynasty bronze vessel ding (sacrificial vessel)]]\nChinese bronze casting and pottery advanced during the Shang dynasty, with bronze typically being used for ritually significant, rather than primarily utilitarian, items.\nAs far back as c. 1500&nbsp;BC, the early Shang dynasty engaged in large-scale production of [[bronze]]-ware vessels and weapons.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=17}} This production required a large labor force that could handle the mining, refining, and transportation of the necessary [[copper]], [[tin]], and [[lead]] ores. This in turn created a need for official managers that could oversee both hard-laborers and skilled artisans and craftsmen.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=17}} The Shang royal court and aristocrats required a vast number of different bronze vessels for various ceremonial purposes and events of religious [[divination]].{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=17}}  Ceremonial rules even decreed how many bronze containers of each type a nobleman or noblewoman of a certain rank could own. With the increased amount of bronze available, the army could also better equip itself with an assortment of bronze weaponry. Bronze was also used for the fittings of [[spoke]]-wheeled [[Chariot (Ancient China)|chariot]]s, which appeared in China around 1200&nbsp;BC.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=14}}\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Dinastia shang, tipode ding biansato, xiii-xii sec. ac.JPG|A Shang dynasty bronze ''ding'' vessel\nFile:HouMuWuDingFullView.jpg|The Shang dynasty [[Houmuwu Ding]] is the heaviest piece of bronze work found in China so far.\nFile:Liu Ding.jpg|A late Shang dynasty bronze ''ding'' vessel with [[taotie]] motif\nFile:Gu wine vessel from the Shang Dynasty.jpg|Bronze ''g\u016b'' ritual wine vessel\nFile:La Tigresse, bronze vessel to preserve drink.

There is little doubt that the chariot entered China through the Central Asia and the Northern Steppe, possibly indicating some form of contact with the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]].{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|1988|p=190}} Recent archaeological finds have shown that the late Shang used horses, chariots, bows and practiced [[horse burial]]s that are similar to the steppe peoples to the west.{{sfnp|Mair|2011|p=100}} These influences led [[Christopher I. Beckwith]] to speculate that Indo-Europeans \"may even have been responsible for the foundation of the Shang Dynasty\", though he admits there is no direct evidence.{{sfnp|Beckwith|2009|pp=43\u201348}} Oracle bone inscriptions suggest that the Shang used chariots in royal hunts and in battle only as mobile command vehicles.{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|1988|pp=213\u2013221}} In contrast, the western enemies of the Shang, such as the Zhou, began to use limited numbers of chariots in battle towards the end of the Shang period.{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|1988|pp=218\u2013221}}\n\nAlthough the Shang depended upon the military skills of their nobility, Shang rulers could mobilize the masses of town-dwelling and rural commoners as conscript laborers and soldiers for both campaigns of defense and conquest.{{sfnp|Sawyer|Sawyer|1994|p=33}}  Aristocrats and other state rulers were obligated to furnish their local garrisons with all necessary equipment, armor, and armaments. The Shang king maintained a force of about a thousand troops at his capital and would personally lead this force into battle.{{sfnp|Sawyer|Sawyer|1994|p=34}} A rudimentary military bureaucracy was also needed in order to muster forces ranging from three to five thousand troops for border campaigns to thirteen thousand troops for suppressing rebellions.\n\n== Kings ==\n{{Main list|List of rulers of China#Shang dynasty|Family tree of ancient Chinese emperors#Shang dynasty}}\n{{anchor|list|kings|king list|emperors}}\n\nThe earliest records are the [[oracle bone]]s inscribed during the reigns of the Shang kings from [[Wu Ding]].{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2013|p=684}}\nThe oracle bones do not contain king lists, but they do record the sacrifices to previous kings and the ancestors of the current king, which follow a standard schedule that scholars have reconstructed. From this evidence, scholars have assembled the implied king list and genealogy, finding that it is in substantial agreement with the later accounts, especially for later kings.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|p=235}}\nAccording to this implied king list, Wu Ding was the twenty-first Shang king.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|p=235}}\n\nThe Shang kings were referred to in the oracle bones by [[posthumous name]]s.\nThe last character of each name is one of the 10 [[celestial stem]]s, which also denoted the day of the 10-day Shang week on which sacrifices would be offered to that ancestor within the ritual schedule.\nThere were more kings than stems, so the names have distinguishing prefixes such as \u5927 ''D\u00e0'' (greater), \u4e2d ''Zh\u014dng'' (middle), \u5c0f ''Xi\u01ceo'' (lesser), \u535c ''B\u01d4'' (outer), \u7956 ''Z\u01d4'' (ancestor) and a few more obscure names.{{sfnp|Smith|2011|pp=3\u20135}} \n\nThe kings, in the order of succession derived from the oracle bones, are here grouped by generation.
