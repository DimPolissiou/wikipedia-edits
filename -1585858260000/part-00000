The first recorded laws dealing with prostitution were in [[Nova Scotia]] in 1759. Following [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867, the laws were consolidated in the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] in 1892. These dealt principally with pimping, procuring, operating brothels and soliciting. Most amendments to date have dealt with the latter; originally classified as a ''vagrancy'' offence, this was amended to ''soliciting'' in 1972, and ''communicating'' in 1985.

Other legal proceedings have dealt with [[ultra vires]] issues (whether a jurisdiction, such as a Provincial Government or municipality, has the powers to legislate on the matter).\n\nIn 1990, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] upheld the law which bans public solicitation of prostitution, arguing that the law had the goal to abolish prostitution, which was a valid goal. Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1 of Criminal Code, (the [[Prostitution Reference]]), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123 is a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada on the right to [[freedom of expression]] under [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 2(b)]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', and on [[prostitution]]. The Court held that, although the Criminal Code provision that prohibited communication for the purpose of engaging in prostitution was in violation of the right to [[freedom of expression]], it could be justified under [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]] of the ''Charter'' and so it was upheld. The majority found, with a 5:2 split and both women dissenting, that the purpose of eliminating prostitution was a valid goal, and that the provision was rationally connected and proportional to that goal. Accordingly, the provision was upheld.<ref>{{cite web |title=Reference re ss.\u00a0193 and 195.1(1)(C) of the criminal code (Man.) - SCC Cases (Lexum) |url=https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/611/index.do |website=scc-csc.lexum.com |accessdate=November 26, 2018 |language=en|date=January 2001 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, a decision of the Ontario Superior Court in ''[[Canada (AG) v Bedford|Bedford v. Canada]]'' held that the key provisions of the Criminal Code dealing with prostitution (Keeping a bawdy house; Living off the avails; Soliciting or Communicating for the purpose) were invalid, but a stay of effect was put in place. This was appealed by the crown resulting in a decision by the [[Ontario Court of Appeal]] on March 26, 2012.<ref name=oca/>\nThat court upheld the lower court's ruling on bawdy houses, modified the ruling on living on the avails to make exploitation a criminal offence, but reversed the decision on soliciting, holding that the effect on communities justified the limitation. Two of the five judges dissented from the last ruling, stating that the law on solicitation was not justifiable. The court continued a stay of effect of a further twelve months on the first provision, and thirty days on the second.\n\nBoth parties had up to sixty days to appeal this decision to the Supreme Court of Canada and on April 25, the federal government stated it would do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/feds-launch-11th-hour-bid-to-keep-ontario-pimping-law-in-place/article2413984/|title=Feds launch '11th-hour' bid to keep Ontario pimping law in place|first=KIRK|last=MAKIN|date=April 25, 2012|via=The Globe and Mail}}</ref>\nOn October 25, 2012, the Supreme Court of Canada agreed to hear the appeal.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/scc-to-hear-prostitution-law-appeal-1.1009866#ixzz2AJi9LwYl|title=SCC to hear prostitution law appeal|date=October 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Supreme Court to hear prostitution law appeal; brothel ban stays for now |author=The Canadian Press |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/301406/supreme-court-to-hear-prostitution-law-appeal-brothel-ban-stays-for-now-4/ |newspaper=[[Global News]] |date=October 25, 2012 |accessdate=January 17, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6nb5zqbM1?url=http://globalnews.ca/news/301406/supreme-court-to-hear-prostitution-law-appeal-brothel-ban-stays-for-now-4/ |archive-date=January 18, 2017 }}</ref> The Supreme Court also agreed to hear a cross-appeal by sex-trade workers on the Court of Appeal for Ontario's decision to ban solicitation.

Drug use has been found to vary substantially by region and gender: it is highest in the [[Atlantic provinces]], lowest in Qu\u00e9bec, and appears to be a problem for the men more than the women.

These trials did not focus on the overrepresentation of Indigenous women and girls in street sex and trafficking trade which has been largely attributed to three main root causes: gender inequality, a subordinate place in settler-colonial society, and targeted violence; thus when paired with the racism aimed at the Indigenous population by the settler-colonial society, a violent attitude towards the bodies of Indigenous street workers is accepted.

While expansive claims have been made as to its extent, expert reports conclude that such estimates cannot be relied upon. For instance, a 2002 report of the Justice Institute of British Columbia states that \"Because of the illicit nature of commercial sexual exploitation, there is no way to accurately measure the number of children and youth being commercially sexually exploited. Estimates of the number of commercially sexually exploited children and youth in Canada vary greatly.\"<ref>[http://www.jibc.ca/cccs/Publications/Commercial_Sexual_Exploitation_WWY_Manual.pdf Commercial sexual exploitation : creative ideas for working with children and youth.

In 1995, the [[Federal-Provincial-Territorial Working Group on Prostitution]] stated that these provisions \u201chave been ineffective in bringing customers and pimps of youths involved in prostitution to justice.\u201d They reported that charges under these provisions were rare, and that juvenile prostitutes and their clients continued to be charged under the general summary conviction offence prohibiting street prostitution, as with adults. Enforcement problems resulted from the reluctance of youths to testify against [[pimps]], and the difficulty of apprehending clients.\n\n====Bill C-27====\nThe 1996 amendments addressed the Working Group report. Bill C-27 included a new indictable offence of \u201caggravated\u201d procuring. This applied to pimps who coerce juveniles into prostitution through violence or intimidation, with a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in prison, and a maximum of 14 years. Bill C-27 extended some procedural safeguards to juvenile witnesses appearing in court, entitling them to testify outside the courtroom behind a screen (or on video). [[Publication ban]]s could protect the identity of complainants or witnesses under the age of 18. The addition of an offence for obtaining or attempting to obtain the sexual services of a person whom the offender believed to be under 18 was intended to make enforcement of s. 212(4) easier; s. 212(5) then added that evidence that a person was represented to the accused as being under 18 was proof of that belief, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. It was intended that [[undercover agent]]s rather than minors themselves would be used to detect such offences. C-27 was given Assent in April 1997.\n\nThe provinces then expressed concerns that convictions would be difficult to obtain because the Crown had to prove the belief of the accused as to the age of the young person, while the working group were unsure about the constitutionality.\n\n====Bill C-51====\nIn June 1998, C-51 was introduced, changing \u201cattempts to obtain\u201d to \u201ccommunicates with any person for the purpose of obtaining\u201d to simplify prosecution by removing any need to prove belief of age. [[Electronic surveillance]] was also explicitly allowed, and this was assented in March 1999.<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\n===Provincial and municipal initiatives===\nIn June 1999, provincial and territorial leaders declared child prostitution abuse rather than a crime and agreed to harmonise child welfare legislation. Several provinces and municipalities appointed task forces to implement the child as victim concept. Alberta led the way in this, followed by British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Ontario (June 2002).<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\n====British Columbia====\nMedia reports claim that [[Vancouver]] has about 500 [[street prostitutes]] under the age of 17, while some have claimed that many more children may be involved in indoor prostitution.<ref name=\"CBCfeb01\"/> Such numbers, however, should be treated with extreme caution (see above).\n\nApproximately 50% to 80% of the child sex trade in British Columbia is carried on in massage parlours, [[karaoke bar]]s, and \u201ctrick pads\u201d; only 20% to 50% of the trade is visible above ground with children being openly solicited on the streets.

They could then be confined for up to 72 hours in a protective [[safe house]], where they can receive emergency care, treatment, assessment and planning. Customers and pimps can be charged with child sexual abuse and fined up to $25,000, 2 years jail or both.\n\nHowever, in July 2000, the law was ruled [[unconstitutional]]. The [[Provincial Court of Alberta|Provincial Court]] determined that it did not respect a child's legal rights because it lacked the \u201cprocedural safeguards\u201d to allow youth the right to answer allegations or seek judicial appeal. But in December the [[Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta|Court of Queen's Bench]] quashed this. Nevertheless, the government had already introduced amendments ensuring that when a child is confined they be informed in writing as to why they were being confined, its duration, court dates and the right to legal representation. The child is also given an opportunity to contact [[Legal Aid]] and that they may request court review of the confinement.\n\nAmendments were also made to enable children to receive additional care and support, including extending the confinement period for up to five days and allowing for authorities to apply for a maximum of two additional confinement periods of up to 21 days each.<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\n====Manitoba====\nIn [[Winnipeg]], evidence was given at a 2008 inquest that hundreds of children, some as young as eight years old, are selling sex to adult men for money, drugs and even food and shelter.

The report cited as causes of [[commercial sexual exploitation of children]] factors such as social isolation; low self-esteem; a dysfunctional family where violence and substance misuse were common; neglect; early sexual abuse or other traumatizing experience; dropping out of school; hidden disabilities, including Fetal Alcohol Syndrome\u2014factors which pushed children into prostitution. Many children had a history of provincial care in a foster or group home, or living on their own, but some youth from well-functioning families had left home after a traumatic event becoming at risk of sexual exploitation once on the street. Some children came from families where prostitution was practised by other members, or from communities where prostitution was common.\n\nThey found that some children were preyed upon by pimps who may slowly gain their trust, befriend them and provide them with food, accommodation and clothes before hooking them on drugs and alcohol and forcing them into sexual service. However, only a small proportion were found to be controlled in this manner, and older girls frequently introduced younger ones into the trade. Some pimps were considered as boyfriends, the report found. Pimps may use romantic techniques to seduce young girls. Where pimps appeared to be involved in recruitment, they worked in areas where young people congregate such as food courts in malls, community centres and schools, preferring unsupervised venues including fast food restaurants and bus stops but also supervised locations including drop-in\nprograms, group homes, juvenile detention centres, youth shelters and treatment centres.<ref name=\"hay\"/> Runaway children are easily spotted by pimps at the bus and train stations of major Canadian cities.\n\n===Human trafficking in persons===\nIn the early 1990s, pressure was building for action on the sexual exploitation of foreign children by Canadian tourists travelling abroad, even though the extent was unknown, leading to the introduction of a number of private member's bills.\n\nC-27 (1996) amended s. 7 of the Criminal Code to address this. s. 7(4.1) extended its extraterritorial provisions to 11 sexual and sex-related offences against minors (but does not specify purchase of sex), and applies Canadian law to foreign jurisdictions.\n\nFollowing enactment of C-27 in 1997, the Department of Justice was involved in the development of the [[United Nations]]\u2019 Optional Protocol to the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] on the sale of children, child prostitution and [[child pornography]], and Canada became a signatory in November 2001 (in force as of January 2002). At the same time C-15 simplified such prosecutions which had previously distinguished between prostitution and other forms of sexual abuse.<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\nIn 2009, [[Joy Smith]] introduced Bill C-268, [[An Act to amend the Criminal Code (minimum sentence for offences involving trafficking of persons under the age of eighteen years)]]. This Bill amended Section 279.01 of Canada\u2019s Criminal Code to create a new offence for child trafficking with a five-year mandatory penalty. Bill C-268 has received broad support from stakeholders concerned with human trafficking including law enforcement, victims\u2019 services, First Nations representatives, and religious and secular non-governmental organizations. MP Joy Smith worked with her colleagues across party lines to gain support for the legislation. On September 30, 2009, Bill C-268 received near unanimous support from Conservative, Liberal and NDP parties and was passed by the House of Commons, although opposed by the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. On June 29, 2010, Bill C-268 was granted Royal Assent and became law. The successful passage of a Private Members Bill is rare and it is only the 15th time in the history of the Canada that a Private Members Bill amended the Criminal Code.\n\n==Policy issues==\nPolicy development around sex work in Canada is complex, divided across areas of jurisdictions and agencies. Issues that policy making bodies need to deal with include which jurisdiction should exercise powers, and which powers. There is debate on how far a government can go in terms of intruding into private lives, and even whether prostitution is actually a problem or merely part of larger problems.<ref name=\"justice03\">{{cite web|url=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/CIR/822-e.htm |first=James R. |last=Robertson|title=Prostitution |publisher=Department of Justice |date=September 19, 2003 |accessdate=October 22, 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhile the outdoor scene is the most visible and the one most likely to lead to complaints, there is an opinion that actions against them merely move the problem around rather than solve it, and that what harms there are in prostitution derive from public attitudes and inconsistent laws.

In 1983 the law was made technically gender neutral and provisions for prosecuting communication were widened in 1985, while special provisions for minors were enacted in 1988.

Following [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867, the laws were consolidated in the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] in 1892. These dealt principally with pimping, procuring, operating brothels and soliciting. Most amendments to date have dealt with the latter; originally classified as a ''vagrancy'' offence, this was amended to ''soliciting'' in 1972, and ''communicating'' in 1985. Since the Charter of Rights and Freedoms became law, the constitutionality of Canada's prostitution laws have been challenged on a number of occasions, successfully so in 2013, leading to a new legislative approach introduced in 2014.\n\nBefore the provisions were struck down, the Criminal Code made the following unlawful:<ref name=\"OWJN\">{{cite web |title=The Law of Sex Work |url=http://www.owjn.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=121&Itemid=107 |website=OWJN |accessdate=June 10, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727160809/http://www.owjn.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=121&Itemid=107 |archivedate=July 27, 2011 |date=July 2008}}</ref>\n\n* owning, managing, leasing, occupying, or being found in a bawdy house, as defined in Section 197 (Section 210) ''declared invalid by the Ontario Court of Appeal, March 2012''.<ref>'To remedy the constitutional problem posed by s. 210, we strike the word \"prostitution\" from the definition of \"common bawdy-house\" in s. 197(1) as it applies to s. 210 at 326', subject to stay of effect for 12 months.</ref>\n* transporting anyone to a bawdy house (Section 211)\n* procuring (Section 212)\n* [[pimping|Living on the avails of prostitution]] ''declared invalid by the Ontario Court of Appeal, March 2012, except in circumstances of exploitation''<ref>Modified to read \"Everyone who lives wholly or in part on the avails of prostitution of another person in ''circumstances of exploitation'' is guilty of an indictable offence\".

Other legal proceedings have dealt with [[ultra vires]] issues (whether a jurisdiction, such as a Provincial Government or municipality, has the powers to legislate on the matter).\n\nIn 1990, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] upheld the law which bans public solicitation of prostitution, arguing that the law had the goal to abolish prostitution, which was a valid goal. Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1 of Criminal Code, (the [[Prostitution Reference]]), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123 is a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada on the right to [[freedom of expression]] under [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 2(b)]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', and on [[prostitution]]. The Court held that, although the Criminal Code provision that prohibited communication for the purpose of engaging in prostitution was in violation of the right to [[freedom of expression]], it could be justified under [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]] of the ''Charter'' and so it was upheld. The majority found, with a 5:2 split and both women dissenting, that the purpose of eliminating prostitution was a valid goal, and that the provision was rationally connected and proportional to that goal. Accordingly, the provision was upheld.<ref>{{cite web |title=Reference re ss.\u00a0193 and 195.1(1)(C) of the criminal code (Man.) - SCC Cases (Lexum) |url=https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/611/index.do |website=scc-csc.lexum.com |accessdate=November 26, 2018 |language=en|date=January 2001 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, a decision of the Ontario Superior Court in ''[[Canada (AG) v Bedford|Bedford v.

These trials did not focus on the overrepresentation of Indigenous women and girls in street sex and trafficking trade which has been largely attributed to three main root causes: gender inequality, a subordinate place in settler-colonial society, and targeted violence; thus when paired with the racism aimed at the Indigenous population by the settler-colonial society, a violent attitude towards the bodies of Indigenous street workers is accepted.

In 1995, the [[Federal-Provincial-Territorial Working Group on Prostitution]] stated that these provisions \u201chave been ineffective in bringing customers and pimps of youths involved in prostitution to justice.\u201d They reported that charges under these provisions were rare, and that juvenile prostitutes and their clients continued to be charged under the general summary conviction offence prohibiting street prostitution, as with adults. Enforcement problems resulted from the reluctance of youths to testify against [[pimps]], and the difficulty of apprehending clients.\n\n====Bill C-27====\nThe 1996 amendments addressed the Working Group report. Bill C-27 included a new indictable offence of \u201caggravated\u201d procuring. This applied to pimps who coerce juveniles into prostitution through violence or intimidation, with a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in prison, and a maximum of 14 years. Bill C-27 extended some procedural safeguards to juvenile witnesses appearing in court, entitling them to testify outside the courtroom behind a screen (or on video). [[Publication ban]]s could protect the identity of complainants or witnesses under the age of 18. The addition of an offence for obtaining or attempting to obtain the sexual services of a person whom the offender believed to be under 18 was intended to make enforcement of s. 212(4) easier; s. 212(5) then added that evidence that a person was represented to the accused as being under 18 was proof of that belief, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. It was intended that [[undercover agent]]s rather than minors themselves would be used to detect such offences. C-27 was given Assent in April 1997.\n\nThe provinces then expressed concerns that convictions would be difficult to obtain because the Crown had to prove the belief of the accused as to the age of the young person, while the working group were unsure about the constitutionality.\n\n====Bill C-51====\nIn June 1998, C-51 was introduced, changing \u201cattempts to obtain\u201d to \u201ccommunicates with any person for the purpose of obtaining\u201d to simplify prosecution by removing any need to prove belief of age. [[Electronic surveillance]] was also explicitly allowed, and this was assented in March 1999.<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\n===Provincial and municipal initiatives===\nIn June 1999, provincial and territorial leaders declared child prostitution abuse rather than a crime and agreed to harmonise child welfare legislation. Several provinces and municipalities appointed task forces to implement the child as victim concept. Alberta led the way in this, followed by British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Ontario (June 2002).<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\n====British Columbia====\nMedia reports claim that [[Vancouver]] has about 500 [[street prostitutes]] under the age of 17, while some have claimed that many more children may be involved in indoor prostitution.<ref name=\"CBCfeb01\"/> Such numbers, however, should be treated with extreme caution (see above).\n\nApproximately 50% to 80% of the child sex trade in British Columbia is carried on in massage parlours, [[karaoke bar]]s, and \u201ctrick pads\u201d; only 20% to 50% of the trade is visible above ground with children being openly solicited on the streets. In smaller BC communities, the sexual exploitation of children is even less visible. It occurs in private homes, back alleys and parks, at public docks and truck stops, and on fishing boats.<ref name=\"hay\">{{Cite news|title= Marie D. Hay.

They could then be confined for up to 72 hours in a protective [[safe house]], where they can receive emergency care, treatment, assessment and planning. Customers and pimps can be charged with child sexual abuse and fined up to $25,000, 2 years jail or both.\n\nHowever, in July 2000, the law was ruled [[unconstitutional]]. The [[Provincial Court of Alberta|Provincial Court]] determined that it did not respect a child\u2019s legal rights because it lacked the \u201cprocedural safeguards\u201d to allow youth the right to answer allegations or seek judicial appeal. But in December the [[Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta|Court of Queen\u2019s Bench]] quashed this. Nevertheless, the government had already introduced amendments ensuring that when a child is confined they be informed in writing as to why they were being confined, its duration, court dates and the right to legal representation. The child is also given an opportunity to contact [[Legal Aid]] and that they may request court review of the confinement.\n\nAmendments were also made to enable children to receive additional care and support, including extending the confinement period for up to five days and allowing for authorities to apply for a maximum of two additional confinement periods of up to 21 days each.<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\n====Manitoba====\nIn [[Winnipeg]], evidence was given at a 2008 inquest that hundreds of children, some as young as eight years old, are selling sex to adult men for money, drugs and even food and shelter.

The report cited as causes of [[commercial sexual exploitation of children]] factors such as social isolation; low self-esteem; a dysfunctional family where violence and substance misuse were common; neglect; early sexual abuse or other traumatizing experience; dropping out of school; hidden disabilities, including Fetal Alcohol Syndrome\u2014factors which pushed children into prostitution. Many children had a history of provincial care in a foster or group home, or living on their own, but some youth from well-functioning families had left home after a traumatic event becoming at risk of sexual exploitation once on the street. Some children came from families where prostitution was practised by other members, or from communities where prostitution was common.\n\nThey found that some children were preyed upon by pimps who may slowly gain their trust, befriend them and provide them with food, accommodation and clothes before hooking them on drugs and alcohol and forcing them into sexual service. However, only a small proportion were found to be controlled in this manner, and older girls frequently introduced younger ones into the trade. Some pimps were considered as boyfriends, the report found. Pimps may use romantic techniques to seduce young girls. Where pimps appeared to be involved in recruitment, they worked in areas where young people congregate such as food courts in malls, community centres and schools, preferring unsupervised venues including fast food restaurants and bus stops but also supervised locations including drop-in\nprograms, group homes, juvenile detention centres, youth shelters and treatment centres.<ref name=\"hay\"/> Runaway children are easily spotted by pimps at the bus and train stations of major Canadian cities.\n\n===Human trafficking in persons===\nIn the early 1990s, pressure was building for action on the sexual exploitation of foreign children by Canadian tourists travelling abroad, even though the extent was unknown, leading to the introduction of a number of private member's bills.\n\nC-27 (1996) amended s. 7 of the Criminal Code to address this. s. 7(4.1) extended its extraterritorial provisions to 11 sexual and sex-related offences against minors (but does not specify purchase of sex), and applies Canadian law to foreign jurisdictions.\n\nFollowing enactment of C-27 in 1997, the Department of Justice was involved in the development of the [[United Nations]]\u2019 Optional Protocol to the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] on the sale of children, child prostitution and [[child pornography]], and Canada became a signatory in November 2001 (in force as of January 2002). At the same time C-15 simplified such prosecutions which had previously distinguished between prostitution and other forms of sexual abuse.<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\nIn 2009, [[Joy Smith]] introduced Bill C-268, [[An Act to amend the Criminal Code (minimum sentence for offences involving trafficking of persons under the age of eighteen years)]]. This Bill amended Section 279.01 of Canada\u2019s Criminal Code to create a new offence for child trafficking with a five-year mandatory penalty. Bill C-268 has received broad support from stakeholders concerned with human trafficking including law enforcement, victims\u2019 services, First Nations representatives, and religious and secular non-governmental organizations. MP Joy Smith worked with her colleagues across party lines to gain support for the legislation. On September 30, 2009, Bill C-268 received near unanimous support from Conservative, Liberal and NDP parties and was passed by the House of Commons, although opposed by the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. On June 29, 2010, Bill C-268 was granted Royal Assent and became law. The successful passage of a Private Members Bill is rare and it is only the 15th time in the history of the Canada that a Private Members Bill amended the Criminal Code.\n\n==Policy issues==\nPolicy development around sex work in Canada is complex, divided across areas of jurisdictions and agencies. Issues that policy making bodies need to deal with include which jurisdiction should exercise powers, and which powers. There is debate on how far a government can go in terms of intruding into private lives, and even whether prostitution is actually a problem or merely part of larger problems.<ref name=\"justice03\">{{cite web|url=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/CIR/822-e.htm |first=James R. |last=Robertson|title=Prostitution |publisher=Department of Justice |date=September 19, 2003 |accessdate=October 22, 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhile the outdoor scene is the most visible and the one most likely to lead to complaints, there is an opinion that actions against them merely move the problem around rather than solve it, and that what harms there are in prostitution derive from public attitudes and inconsistent laws. The legal status has been described as \"quasi-legal\"<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\nDebate comes from [[feminists]], [[civil libertarian]]s, politicians and law and order officials.

The most recent was the 2006 report of the parliamentary subcommittee on solicitation which split on ideological party lines, with recommendations for [[decriminalisation]] from the majority opposition parties, and for eradication by the minority government members.\n\nThe former majority Conservative government supported the prohibition of prostitution.

This notion, associated to that of volumography and volumology, allows him to insist on the unity of the human entity, its entirety, its unicitiy and also its stylistic continuity. \n\n\n==Books==\n* ''Les Jeux de la f\u00eate'', Paris, Publications de la Sorbonne, 1988.\n* {{cite book|title=Le mode mineur de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 : paradoxes et photographies en anthropologie|date=1992|publisher=Peeters|location=Louvain-la-Neuve|isbn=9789068314427}}\n* ''Les Religiosit\u00e9s s\u00e9culi\u00e8res'', Paris, [[PUF]], 1993.\n* {{cite book|title=Ethnographie de l'action : l'observation des d\u00e9tails|date=1996|publisher=Editions M\u00e9taili\u00e9|location=Paris|isbn=9782864242147}}\n* ''La Religion de pr\u00e8s.

Nicaraguan women and children are subjected to sex trafficking in the [[North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region|RAAN]] and [[South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region|RAAS]], where the lack of strong law enforcement institutions and a higher crime rate increase the vulnerability of the local population. \n\nNicaraguans from Northern-Central departments who migrate to other Central American countries and Europe are reportedly vulnerable to sextrafficking. During the reporting period, Nicaraguans were reported as among the primary nationalities of victims identified in Guatemala. In addition, children left by these migrants in Nicaragua reportedly become vulnerable to sex trafficking. \n\nThe [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Nicaragua as a [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2 Watch List]] country.<ref name=\"state18\">{{cite web |title=Nicaragua 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282720.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730020749/https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282720.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 July 2018 |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=29 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61734.htm U.S. Department of State - Country Reports on Human Rights Practices  - 2005 - Nicaragua]\n\n{{North America in topic|Prostitution in}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Prostitution In Nicaragua}}\n[[Category:Prostitution by country|Nicaragua]]\n[[Category:Prostitution in North America|Nicaragua]]\n[[Category:Nicaraguan society]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHIV:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_Nicaragua"}

Although similar institutions such as brothel ownership and pimping are illegal in [[Honduras]], prostitution has remained largely unchecked by the government. [[UNAIDS]] estimate there to be 22,771 prostitutes in the country.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sex workers: Population size estimate - Number, 2016 |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/dv/PivotData_2018_7_22_636678151733621264.htm |website=www.aidsinfoonline.org |publisher=UNAIDS |accessdate=21 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nLack of enforcement of current laws has created a profitable business out of prostitution - one in which both adults and children are a part. There are many causes to the high rates of involvement amongst the women and teens in cities, but the main reason is the high poverty levels. Participants see sex work as a viable option to escape poverty.\n\nProstitution poses risks to these sex workers, especially in terms of mental, physical, and sexual health effects. There are also worldwide effects due to prostitution out of Honduras and similar countries in [[Central America]]. \n\nHonduras has tried to curb these effects but has yet to find a stable solution, despite numerous policy recommendations.\n\n== Effects of adult prostitution ==\n\n=== Mental and physical ===\nAccording to a study, many commercial sex workers in cities, both men and women, are exposed to sexual and physical violence. 71.4% of street workers were exposed to violence/physical danger and almost 90% were exposed to sexual violence.<ref>Rio Navarro, Javier, Julien Cohen, Eva Rocillo Arechaga, and Edgardo Zuniga. 2012. \u201cPhysical and sexual violence, mental health indicators, and treatment seeking among street-based population groups in Tegucigalpa, Honduras\u201d ''Revista Panamericana De Salud Publica'' 31, no. 5: 388-395. ''Academic Search Premier'', EBSCO''host'' (accessed 2 March 2017)</ref> On top of this, 73.5% of victims were physically abused in their childhood, which shows the origins of such mental and physical effects. For some workers, a lifestyle of abuse and exploitation is all they know.\n\nAnother important aspect is the correlation between prostitution and drug use amongst sex workers. In the same study, nearly 1 in 4 commercial sex workers abuse [[cocaine]], which as a recreational drug, has its own physical effects.\n\nIn terms of mental effects, 63.3% of Commercial sex workers have reported having suicidal behavior in life; this percentage was even higher amongst the women. It is clear that prostitution in Honduran urban centers has created negative mental health issues among those who work in the field.\n\n=== Sexual ===\nContrary to the belief that prostitution equates to high levels of HIV/[[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], a medical report<ref>Ditmore, M. H. (2006). ''Encyclopedia of prostitution and sex work''. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press.</ref> from 2006 states that only 2.4% of its sample size of 790 female sex workers had HIV. They attribute this low number to the increase in the use of protection among sex workers. In fact, government STI prevention programs have been implemented since the early 2000s in cities across Honduras. Because prostitution is prolific in cities, these programs have proven extremely effective in reducing numbers of HIV incidents.\n\n== Child prostitution ==\nHonduras has unsuccessfully tried to curb [[child prostitution]]. Lax laws have turned child prostitution into a business that has created prostitution rings both within the country and trafficking to other countries, including the US. \n\nThe business continues to grow as children participate in sex work as a means of surviving.\n\nAlthough this article is specific to Honduras, child prostitution can be viewed in [[Central America]] as a whole, because of the networks of prostitution rings from as north as southern Mexico to as south as Costa Rica.<ref name=\":0\">Beyer, N.

''In modern bondage: Sex trafficking in the americas : National and regional overview of Central America and the caribbean : Belize, costa rica, dominican republic, el salvador, guatemala, Honduras, ''</ref>\n\n=== Causes ===\nThe first cause is poverty. Prostitution becomes a source of economic opportunity where there is a space of economic regression.<ref name=\":0\" /> Surprisingly, many children who go into prostitution are forced by the parents in order to provide for the family, hence there were high levels of reported abuse in sex workers' childhoods. In a country where there are low literacy rates in rural areas, there is little opportunity to gain economic prosperity through education. \n\nExploiting this reality, sex-tourist agents go to the countryside to find these children and contract them out for work. The agents pay the parents large sums of money up front in exchange for contractual labor done by their children, a form of modern-day slavery.\n\nAnother cause is the promise for a better lifestyle. Some children willingly participate in the child prostitution industry because they believe the quality of life will be better than before. There have even been reports of some sex workers believing they would get trafficked into a better country where they could start anew.<ref name=\":0\" />  Unfortunately, some children are homeless or surrounded by gang activity and find similar outlets to survive.\n\nAnother large issue that is rarely mentioned is the influence gender roles play in prostitution. Women in Honduras are seen as sexual objects and treated as such. This is why violence levels are so high against sex workers, especially women. Because these women are fundamentally seen as passive objects for a man's pleasure, they are dehumanized and treated as less than human.\n\n=== Effects of sex work on children ===\nThere are dangerous physical and mental effects of sex work on children. They live in terrible conditions, are poorly fed and are often physically abused by their contractors if they do not deliver well on their jobs.<ref name=\":1\" /> Children suffer from mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression, but also a lack of confidence and self-worth because they are used as tools. Children have been found to struggle from [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder]] as adults due to their experiences when younger.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn terms of health effects, children are more likely to suffer from life-threatening illnesses such as tuberculosis and HIV due to the amount of exposure to others in the work, and the immaturity of their bodies. Additionally, they are more susceptible to transferring STDs due to the ease with which their genitals can break.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Sex tourism ===\n[[Sex tourism]] is an issue that is tied to child prostitution because of the large demand by older, adult men. Individuals from developed countries come to major Honduran cities like Tegucigalpa in order to have sex with minors because it is legal and cheap. The demand of these individuals further spurs the business, and is the reason for the creation of the sex work contractors.\n\nAlthough pimping is considered illegal, it is commonplace and an industry has arisen through illegal tourism. \n\n== Sex trafficking ==\n{{see also|Human trafficking in Honduras}}\nBecause of a low-cost and available population, trafficking has occurred both in and out of Honduras. These rings have extended their reach to even the United States. Here are a few reasons why sex trafficking occurs.\n\nThe first reason is deceit. Sex workers are lured with the promise of a better life, and are sold to wealthy people in the United States.<ref name=\":2\">Golob, T. A. (2014).
