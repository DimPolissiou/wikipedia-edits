As a young girl, she entered the father's office and watched him examine the patients or treat wounds; she also went with him to visit patients on remote farms. In addition, her decision to dedicate her life to medicine was probably influenced by her uncles who were successful doctors: James led the missionary hospital in India, and Alex was a professor of anatomy at the University of Glasgow.\n\nMacPhail and her siblings' were initially home schooled by private teachers. Once they were old enough they attended the distant elementary school in [[Coatbridge]], going on to study at Hillhead Academy in [[Glasgow]]. All four children successfully completing their studies at the Academy, and later at the [[University of Glasgow]].\n[[File:\u0414\u0440 \u041a\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043d \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0444\u0435\u0458\u043b \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442.jpg|thumb|Graduation, 1905]]\nAt that time in Scotland, it was unusual for women to study at all, and especially medicine. Of the well-educated womeny from reputable families, they expected only to lead the household well and deal with art. Probably for this reason, her father was against his MacPhail's desire to study medicine. However, she had already demonstrated decisive determination and persistence, and he could not stand in the way of her decision. Her parents understood the importance of education, and on 26 April 1906 she enrolled to study medicine at the [[University of Glasgow]]. She was an excellent student, ane received numerous awards for her studies. She graduated on 12 October 1911 with an [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MB ChB]] from [[University of Glasgow Medical School]].{{sfn|Haines|Stevens|2001|p=192}}<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\">{{cite web |title=Surgeon Katherine S Macphail |url=https://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/ww1-biography/?id=4499 |publisher=University of Glasgow |accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nMacPhail began her medical career at the [[Glasgow Royal Infirmary]] in Glasgow, and she was also an assistant doctor at her father's clinic.\n\n==World War I==\n===Scotland, 1914===\nWhen [[World War I]] broke out, MacPhail decided to volunteer for active service in the [[British Army]] and sent a letter to the Ministry of War requesting to do so. The answer was fast, declining her request and explaining that the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] did not accept women. She turned to the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]], and received a similar response, as it too did not accept female doctors. She contacted [[Elsie Inglis|Dr Elsie Inglis]], who was recruiting women doctors and other medical staff for a women's volunteer medical units. Dr Inglis offered her hospital team to the British Ministry of War, but was rejected by the sentence: \"My dear lady, go home and sit still.\" Dr Inglis then sent letters to the embassies of France, Belgium, Russia and Serbia, who accepted this offer immediately and with gratitude. \n{{Quote box\n | quote  =\"We knew we were being sent out under the auspices of the Suffrage Societies, and each was afraid that every other was a strong supporter, but were much relieved to find that almost none of us was what might be called 'strong', and that Serbia was the common bond, not suffrage.\"<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />\n | source =\n | width  =25%\n | align  =right\n}}\nFrom then, she began active work for the [[Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service]] which affiliated itself with the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|suffrage movement]]. As the units for France and Belgium had already been filled, MacPhail was in a dilemma whether to go to Serbia, which was little known in the United Kingdom at that time. MacPhail later said: \"I really hardly knew where Serbia was, but from what I read, I knew it was very difficult for them.\" MacPhail accepted the offer and joined as the youngest in a group of 30 women who comprised the staff of the first unit of the Scottish Women's Hospital in Serbia. Her sister Isabel accompanied her to function as an [[orderly]].<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />\n\n===Serbia, 1915===\nIn mid-December 1914, MacPhail's group boarded a transport boat in Southampton. On the way to [[Malta]],{{sfn|Dositey Obradovich Circle|2009|p=116}} most members of the unit spent time learning Serbian. Immediately after Christmas, they boarded the ship \"Nile\", which sailed to [[Piraeus]]. They arrived in [[Thessaloniki]] on 1 January 1915, and the next day boarded a train for [[Kragujevac]], which was the headquarters of the Serbian army and military medical team. Though she was a junior doctor, she felt her skills were not being used appropriately.{{sfn|Sharp|Stibbe|2011|p=410}}<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />\n\nIn the year 1915, an epidemic of [[typhoid fever]] emerged among the Serbian army. In June 1915, when the epidemic was in decline, MacPhail became seriously ill with a severe form of the infection. Her hearing was damaged long-lasting high temperatures, and she lost her hair, so covered wore a hat or a scarf for a long time. When she was healed, on the insistence of [[Ernest Troubridge|Admiral Ernest Troubridge]], she left Serbia and returned to Scotland in order to recover completely. She reached Scotland in September 1915.\n\n===France, 1916===\nAs soon as she had recovered sufficiently, MacPhail contacted the Serbian Support Fund in [[London]] and began a campaign to help the organization. She traveled all over Scotland, attended charity meetings and held lectures about her experiences in Serbia, appealing for help for the country.\n\nAs she was unable to return to Serbia, which at the time was behind enemy lines, in January 1916, she joined the charity \"Friends\", which worked in France. She worked at Shalona in Marni, in the [[Champagne (wine region)|Champagne region]], northeast of [[Paris]]. In April 1916, she was offered a job in [[Corsica]], and in May 1916, arrived in [[Bastia]] to work at a hospital. A few days after her arrival she went to [[Ajaccio]], visiting a Scottish Women's Hospital. There, she met with several acquaintances she knew from Serbia, and they told her what was happening to their old unit. Finding that there were opportunities to return to Serbia, she interrupted her stay in Corsica, in order to try to organize the accommodation of Serbian orphans in the \"Friends\" home in the High Savai. Unfortunately, this failed. \"Friends\" took over a hotel in Samoan, about {{convert|20|km}} from the Swiss border, and turned it into a refugee camp. At the end of September 1916, MacPhail took over the duties of a doctor in this home. During her stay in France, Dr. Sondermayer, chief of the Sanitary Department of the Serbian Army, offered her a place in a hospital and MacPhail, immediately accepted the offer.{{sfn|American National Red Cross|1916|p=418}}\n\n===Serbia, 1917===\n[[File:\u041d\u0430 \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0443\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0444\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0443 1917. \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435 .jpg|thumb|left|MacPhail (sitting in the car) with colleagues, 1917.]]\n[[File:\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0443\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0444\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0443.jpg|thumb|Dancing the kolo with an Allied and a Serbian officer, amidst one of the regiments on the Thessaloniki front, ca. 1917\u201318.]]\nIn the early spring of 1917, MacPhail was on the [[Macedonian front|Thessaloniki front]]. In Thessaloniki, MacPhail located her younger sister, Isabel, who arrived there earlier with the Scottish Women's Hospital. Dr Sondermayer offered MacPhail and Isabel an opportunity to work in a newly formed large hospital, which France provided to the Serbian army, named the Serbian Hospital of Crown Prince [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]].\n\nA few days later, they received an invitation from the head of the Serbian Relielf Fund in [[Thessaloniki]] to come to their hospital in Sorovi\u0107 (today the Greek town of [[Amyntaio]], near the Greek-Macedonian border) to help care for the injured civilian population during the bombing of [[Bitola#World War I|Bitola]] and the surrounding area. MacPhail and Isabel as well as two other nurses and a cook were sent to the village of Brod, on the south-eastern side of the Bitola area. Isabel soon left Brod and returned to Thessaloniki to work in the Serbian hospital of Crown Prince Alexander, while MacPhail remained behind. At the end of the year, she traveled to Thessaloniki, returning to Brod with a serious illness. She was sure that it was a disease that was caused by long-term poor nutrition, and later it was identified as [[pellagra]], then a little-known disease caused by a diet insufficient in vitamins.\n\nAt the end of 1917, the hospital of the Serbian Support Fund was moved from Sorovi\u0107 to [[Germijan]] near Brod, where MacPhail's outpatient clinic was closed to this village. At the same time, she approached her deadline to report to her post at the Serbian Hospital of Crown Prince Alexander in Thessaloniki. MacPhail was firmly convinced that her medical help was far more needed in the villages, so she managed to persuade Dr Sondermayer to let her remain in Bitola. At that time, MacPhail was visited by her friend, Dr Edward W. Ryan, whom she showed the poor living conditions in the nearby villages. Seeing this, Ryan immediately began collecting aid through the [[American Red Cross]], and managed to obtain a mobile outpatient unit, which was supplied with drugs and food supplies so that MacPhail could expand her work to improving the nutrition of vulnerable children.\n\nDuring the winter of 1917/18, MacPhail was invited to a celebration where she first saw and met Crown Prince Alexander. In the Macedonian mountains, conditions were harsh and cold, but MacPhail with her mobile outpatient unit visited the surrounding villages regularly and did her job. In the meantime, her family and friends in Scotland collected warm clothes and footwear which Katherine shared with impoverished women and children.\n\n===Scotland, 1918===\nIn the summer of 1918, MacPahil returned to Scotland for a short time to assist her father, Dr Donald MacPhail, who was working alone attending to patients who had contracted [[Spanish flu]]. When he contracted the flu, MacPhail and Isabel left,{{sfn|Miller|2018|p=233}} and the responsible parties accepted their reasons. MacPhail was distinguished by the [[Order of St. Sava]] IV class and the Medal of the Serbian Red Cross,<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" /> while Isabel received the Cross of Mercy. In August 1918, the sisters MacPhail left Thessaloniki and returned to their native Scotland.\n[[File:\u0414\u0438\u043f\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0430 .jpg|thumb|Certificate naming MacPhail as an honorary citizen of Coatbridge, 15 August 1918]]\nIn Scotland, MacPhail cared for her sick father and some of his patients. On 15 August 1918 MacPhail became an honorary citizen of Coatbridge, and at a special ceremony received the town's charter, and a gold watch.\n\nMacPhail followed news of the offensives on the Tessaloniki front and the allies breakthrough in September 1918.\n\n==Interwar period==\n=== Return to Serbia===\nAt the end of November 1918 MacPhail returned to Serbia. Clothing, footwear and other supplies to help Serbia, were collected by her family, friends and patients, were packaged and sent separately via the Red Cross. From [[London]], MacPhail traveled to [[Paris]] and [[Toulon]] where she waited to board a ship to [[Dubrovnik]]. At that time Tulon was then crowded with refugees from Serbia, soldiers and civilians trying to return home. In Toulon she met Darinka Grujic, who had been taking care of Serbian orphans and refugees in France since the beginning of the war, which she wanted to return to Serbia. After several days waiting in Toulon, she embarked for Dubrovnik,then traveled for 3 days to Sarajevo, [[Zemun]] and finally Belgrade.\n\nAfter her arrival in Belgrade MacPhail applied to the Ministry of the Interior and was granted permission to stay to carryout charity work.\n\n====First Children's Hospital in Belgrade====\nAt the beginning of 1919, she opened the first children's hospital in Belgrade. This was facilitated by Darinka Grujic securing five military barracks in Studenicka Street, near the Military Hospital, and giving one of the barracks to MacPhail to establish a children's hospital. British marines, led by Admiral Troubridge, cleaned, repaired and outfitted the barrack. A steriliser was installed along with 25 military beds, bedding, blankets and other supplies from Red Cross. Drugs and military supplies came from the American Red Cross. The Serbian Support Fund opened a charity kitchen for a nearby school, so MacPhail managed to arrange to supply this kitchen with food as well as for children at the hospital, while firewood was provided by the city government. Troubridge received many toys and Florence Harvey offered to provide a car for free. At the end of January 1919, the hospital received its first patients.\n\nDuring the first months of operation, every bed in the hospital was filled, and a large number of children attended the outpatient clinic. MacPhail performed all the medical work because there were few doctors as only about 100 had survived the war. Because of her work, MacPhail was popular in Belgrade, and was able to provide various types of assistance and donations for those who lacked financial means.\n\n====Pavilion in Top\u010dider====\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u0443 \u0422\u043e\u043f\u0447\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0459\u043e\u043d\u0443.jpg|thumb|Patients at Top\u010dider Pavilion]]\nBy spring of 1919, the hospital was already too small in particular due to an increase in the number of children with [[tuberculosis]]. MacPhail learned that there was an empty and abandoned open pavilion that was previously used for children at [[Top\u010dider]], {{convert|10|km}} from Belgrade/ The pavilion was located on a hill, at the edge of a forest, so it was ideal for a treatment consisting of fresh air and sun, which, in addition to good food and rest, was at that time the only medicine for tuberculosis. MacPhail was granted a permit from the city government to arrange necessary repairs for the building and to procure equipment. By Easter 1919 the 40 bed pavilion received its first patients. It was managed by Mary Baker and soon proved to be successful with many children recovering. As an open pavilion it was only used in the summer months. It closed in 1924.\n\n====Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital====\n[[File:Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital surgical ward.png|thumb|Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital surgical ward]]\nAs the work expanded, MacPhail realized that the existing capacities would soon be insufficient for an increasing number of patients, especially because the top of the pavilion made it unusable in the winter, so she began to think about expanding the hospital. An enlarged building in Kneza Milosa Street, near the Military Hospital, was left empty when British marines left Belgrade and MacPhail immediately started the action to get that house for her hospital. It was a large, bright, well-built and preserved building that had enough space to accommodate 50 beds, especially when MacPhail succeeded in replacing large military beds for children's beds. In addition, a small operating room for easy surgical cases was formed, while severe surgical cases were sent to the state hospital. A large department for outpatient patients was also established. This new hospital began operating in November 1919, though it officially opened in February 1921. It was no longer an improvised institution, but a real medical institution. It was officially recognized by the Government of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as the first Children's Hospital in Serbia, called the Anglo-Serb Children's Hospital, abbreviated ASCH. It was the only children's hospital in what was now [[Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Oldfield|2001|p=149}} Shortly after the opening of this hospital, the Ministry of Health asked MacPhail to receive infants and newborns, so a special nursing department was also set up with treatment provided by the most experienced nurse. By 1921, MacPhail was hopeful to not only perfect this hospital, but to encourage the foundation of others and to train native nurses to work in them.{{sfn|The Hospital|1921|p=5}}\n\n===Dubrovnik===\n[[File:\u0415\u043d\u0438 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0444\u0435\u0458\u043b.jpg|thumb|MacPhail (left) and her colleague preparing food on the terrace \"Villa Brava\u010di\u0107\" in Dubrovnik, ca. 1920-1921]]\nAs the number of patients at Topcider had been steadily increasing, MacPhail came to the idea of finding a place on the seashore where she could accommodate children with tuberculous. She learned that there is a villa in [[Dubrovnik]] that would be ideal for this purpose. MacPhail contacted [[Zivojin Mi\u0161i\u0107]] who was then the head of the general\u0161tab and whom MacPhail knew from the Thessaloniki front. When MacPhail explained to him that this villa in Dubrovnik should serve as a health center and a children's rest home, he immediately ordered the villa to be handed over to the English-Serbian children's hospital for further use. MacPhail's sister, Isabel, who was already doing volunteer work at the Children's Hospital in Belgrade, traveled to Dubrovnik to see the building and to try and find the equipment for her. While she was in Dubrovnik, Isabel heard of an abandoned Austrian hospital near [[Zelenika]] in [[Bay of Kotor|Boka Kotorska]] and traveled there to see what it was about. To her surprise, she found a deserted but fully equipped hospital, with beds, bedding and other material, and a young Serbian officer who kept all of this with his soldiers. It was Vasa Srdi. He offered for Isabel to take everything she needed, and in addition, he immediately arranged shipping and transport of equipment to Dubrovnik. Isabel chose 60 beds together and other equipment and returned to Dubrovnik. As the building itself was well preserved, the hospital was established in February 1920.\n\n===Sremska Kamenica===\nIn the early 1930s, a report was submitted regarding the Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital stating that during the preceding two years, 115 hospital patients were hospitalized (hospitalization of some patients lasted up to 24 months), and 160 children were treated clinically, or outside the hospital. There were also 25 surgical procedures, 194 punctures and 113 X-ray imaging, and 84 immunizations with gypsum were performed. Fifty children left the hospital as successfully cured, 12 of them had improved health status during discharge, and the rest was on further treatment. The conclusion was that in spite of the small number of beds and a limited fund owned by the Anglo-Yugoslav hospital, she managed to fulfill all the tasks. The enormous costs of maintaining a hospital in Belgrade had become increasingly high year after year, and this, among other reasons, influenced MacPhail to start thinking about moving the hospital somewhere in the interior of the country, but not too far from Belgrade, which would be in open air with fresh air and sun. She even thought about buying one of the abandoned [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]] monasteries. Darinka Grujic advised her to try to find a suitable building or to build a new building in [[Sremska Kamenica]], which according to its natural conditions, was the most suitable place for this purpose. As MacPhail already had a holiday home in Sremska Kamenica, she immediately started making plans for the establishment of a new hospital.\n\nMacPhail's old friend, Eng. Vasa Srdi\u0107 had been an officer of the Serbian army in Zelenika in the early 1920s He had helped Isabel and subsequently became a great friend of the sisters MacPhail. After the war, as a graduate engineer of agronomy, he got land in [[Temerin]], where he settled and was engaged in farming and fruit growing. Being aware of MacPhail's plans, he soon learned that on the hill \u010cardak, just above Sremska Kamenica, an old and abandoned vineyard was being sold which could suit MacPhail's plans. She was thrilled with the position of the city itself and its surroundings and bought the land, which was officially conveyed to her on August 1, 1933, and immediately began preparations for the construction of the hospital. According to Ketrin's idea and with the help of an engineer of the Hygienic Institute in Belgrade, an old Russian architect made plans for a three-winged building with a central courtyard and a long terrace along the north and west wing so that children can be in the sun all day.\n\nIn the spring of 1934, the work on the new hospital was completed, all necessary equipment was ordered, and lists of patients scheduled to start treatment were compiled. The Royal Commission of the Danube Banovina approved the opening of the children's sanatorium. The building consisted of a main frontal area and two symmetrically situated wings. The main part consisted of three departments of the hospital, a patient unit, a workshop, a radiotherapy department, a pharmacy section, a space intended for patients with infectious diseases and rooms for the sterilization of instruments and appliances. Also, there was an area for the administration of the hospital, as well as a warehouse for medicines and instruments. In the wings of the buildingm there was a kitchen with a pantry and a dining room for children. On the first floor were four-room dormitories for doctors and nurses. There were also four bathrooms and toilets arranged in the wings of the building. The hospital was built in accordance with the needs of patients who anticipated a longer stay for treatment. There were terraces in front of the south and west wings. Even the courtyard was fenced and decorated like a park. The orchard and vineyard were also located within the yard.\n\nThe principle treatment of bone and joint tuberculosis at the time when antibiotics and antituberculotics did not exist consisted of increasing the general resistance of patients with hygienic and dietary regimen, fresh air therapy, heliotherapy (exposure to the sun during the day, during the winter exposure to artificial light), immobilization and various surgical procedures. Special attention was also paid to hospital hygiene. School-age children attended daily classes that corresponded to their age and curriculum, after which they would receive a certificate at the end of the school year. The hospital also organized workshops that were part of the work therapy, where children attended art classes. Once a week, the Orthodox priest would come to provide the children with religious instruction. The hospital also had a library that was equipped with a large number of children's books, which were both educational and entertaining, and there were a handful of toys.\n\nEnglish-Yugoslav Hospital for Treatment of Osteoarticular Tuberculosis<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" /> was officially opened on September 23, 1934, under the auspices of Her Majesty Queen Maria Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107. The first patients were transferred from a Belgrade hospital as early as August 1. The treatment was focused on patients suffering from tuberculosis of the bones and joints, [[Rickets|rachitis]]. The treatment consisted of fresh air, sun exposure, good food, rest, massage, immobilization with plaster and surgery if there was a need for it. The hospital received children under 14 years of age. During the year, there were up to 50 children, and over the winter, 32. The head of the hospital was MacPhail, the main surgeon was Svetislav Sojanovi\u0107, the main nurse was Agnes Hardy, and Alice Murphy was a secretary. Among the staff, there were two other nurses, one teacher and auxiliary staff. One of the main problems of the hospital was funding, because the children were mostly treated for free. The cost of the hospital was covered by many donors. Among the donors, there was also the Ministry of Social Affairs and Public Health of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Child Protection Fund, as well as various other organizations. All of this was not enough to cover the cost of the hospital, so for this reason, MacPhail had to constantly run a fundraising campaign in order to keep the hospital in operation.\n\nIn 1940, the situation in the region became serious and the sanatorium staff began to prepare with the military against an enemy attack. In February 1941, MacPhail had a plan to evacuate children from the hospital. Three weeks before the war, all children were sent from the hospital to their homes, and all the hospital equipment was packed and sheltered in the basements to be protected in the event of a bombing. The situation become very serious and the British Embassy advised all British citizens to leave the country. Not leaving in time, she and other British residents became the prisoners of the Germans before she was repatriated to Britain.<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />\n\nSoon thereafter, 120 soldiers were placed in the hospital for anti-aircraft patrols. The building was soon turned into a local hospital. The hospital staff often helped the partisan movement in the form of providing medical care and food, which was one of the reasons why the hospital was attacked. After that, the building was abandoned and destroyed. During the war years, the hospital also used hostile forces for its soldiers.\n\n==Post-WWII==\nMacPhail came to Belgrade after the liberation in 1945. When she went to visit Sremska Kamenica, she encountered a building that was without a door and windows, empty and ruined. There was no longer any medical or electrical equipment in it. In July, MacPhail began negotiations over the reopening of a hospital in Sremska Kamenica with the help of the Child Protection Fund from London. The Ministry of Public Health of the Democratic Federative Yugoslavia gave permission to start the reconstruction on August 15. With the help of staff, MacPhail managed to procure medical equipment and medical supplies as well as other necessary things to carry out the operation. From humanitarian organizations from Canada and the United Kingdom came bedding and blankets. The complete equipment from the surgery was found in a military hospital in [[Sremski Karlovci]] and was soon returned. Katherine also received 46 boxes of clothes and bedding for children from friends. The complete repair of the hospital was financed by the Government of the Autonomous Welfare of [[Vojvodina]], and the hospital was restarted on December 19, 1945.\n\nDuring the war, the number of children who suffered from tuberculosis increased. The hospital now operated with a capacity of 75 beds and was permanently filled. The working conditions were difficult at that time due to the lack of equipment and food, as the supply of the hospital was very difficult. During this period, the fruit trees and vineyards that were around the hospital were of great help. Soon, life and work at the hospital returned to normal. However, the new government slowly increased the amount of mistrust towards MacPhail and her associates. She proposed to the Ministry of Health to turn the hospital into a rehabilitation center for children with disabilities, as well as for children who became disabled due to tuberculosis or other illnesses. She also planned to build a workshop where adults with disabilities would help in the production of orthopedic aids.\n\nIn 1947, the new regime decided to nationalize all hospitals and the Anglo-Yugoslav (Anglo-Serb.) Children's Hospital was handed over to the Yugoslav authorities in the autumn of that year. After nationalization, the hospital continued to exist as a state sanatorium for bone tuberculosis.\n[[File:\u041a\u0443\u045b\u0430 \u0421\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0415\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0458\u0443\u0441.jpg|thumb|left|House at 4 Kinburn Place in [[St Andrews]] where MacPhail lived]]\nThe hospital in Sremska Kamenica became a state property and as such, was part of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery of the Medical Faculty in Belgrade, led by Professor Svetislav Stojanovic. Realizing that nothing could prevent the implementation of the communist regime, MacPhail returned to Scotland in 1949, settling in [[St Andrews]].<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />\n\nOn 22 September 1954, to mark the 20th anniversary of the hospital's establishment, MacPhail visited the hospital in Sremska Kamenica and was warmly greeted warmly:\u2014 \"The hospital looked like before, fresh, exposed to the sun and surrounded by rich vineyards. The children attended school classes, freshly-prepared meal awaited the children every day thanks to the staff from the kitchen.\" A memorial plaque was placed in the entrance hall with the inscription that she was its founder. This memorial plaque was a great sign of gratitude for her contribution during the war. Apart from MacPhail, the ceremony were attended by Alice Marfi and Flora Sands.\n\nMacPhail died in St Andrews, 11 September 1974.\n\n==Honors and legacy==\n[[File:RS058-15.jpg|thumb|Postage stamp issued by Serbian Mail, 2015]]\nDuring the World War I, MacPhail was distinguished by the [[Order of St. Sava|Order of St Sava]] of the Fourth and Fifth degrees, and due to the humanitarian activities that followed the war, she received the Order of the Third Degree. Great Britain awarded her one of her greatest awards, the [[Order of the British Empire]]. When it was 1954, for the last time, she came to Serbia to visit her hospital in Sremska Kamenica on the occasion of  twenty years since its founding, MacPhail became an honorary citizen of Sremska Kamenica and the lifelong president of the Karlovac Red Cross. In the courtyard of the hospital, two memorial plaques were placed in her honor, and on June 15, 1988, a monument in her honor was also erected. In December 2015, the Serbian Mail issued commemorative stamps in her honor in partnership with the British Embassy in Belgrade.<ref name=\"bl.uk2016\" />\n\nHer biography, ''Ever yours sincerely: the life and work of Dr Katherine S.

As a young girl, she entered the father's office and watched him examine the patients or treat wounds, she also went with him to visit the patients on remote farms. In addition, her decision to dedicate her life to medicine was probably influenced by her uncles who were successful doctors: James led the missionary hospital in India, and Alex was a professor of anatomy at the University of Glasgow.\n\nMacPhail and her siblings' were initially home schooled by private teachers. Once they were old enough they attended the distant elementary school in [[Coatbridge]], going on to study at Hillhead Academy in [[Glasgow]]. All four children successfully completing their studies at the Academy, and later at the [[University of Glasgow]].\n[[File:\u0414\u0440 \u041a\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043d \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0444\u0435\u0458\u043b \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442.jpg|thumb|Graduation, 1905]]\nAt that time in Scotland, it was unusual for women to study at all, and especially medicine. Of the well-educated womeny from reputable families, they expected only to lead the household well and deal with art. Probably for this reason, her father was against his MacPhail's desire to study medicine. However, she had already demonstrated decisive determination and persistence, and he could not stand in the way of her decision. Her parents understood the importance of education, and on 26 April 1906 she enrolled to study medicine at the [[University of Glasgow]]. She was an excellent student, ane received numerous awards for her studies. She graduated on 12 October 1911 with an [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MB ChB]] from [[University of Glasgow Medical School]].{{sfn|Haines|Stevens|2001|p=192}}<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\">{{cite web |title=Surgeon Katherine S Macphail |url=https://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/ww1-biography/?id=4499 |publisher=University of Glasgow |accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nMacPhail began her medical career at the [[Glasgow Royal Infirmary]] in Glasgow, and she was also an assistant doctor at her father's clinic.\n\n==World War I==\n===Scotland, 1914===\nWhen [[World War I]] broke out, MacPhail decided to volunteer for active service in the [[British Army]] and sent a letter to the Ministry of War requesting to do so. The answer was fast, declining her request and explaining that the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] did not accept women. She turned to the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]], and received a similar response, as it too did not accept female doctors. She contacted [[Elsie Inglis|Dr Elsie Inglis]], who was recruiting women doctors and other medical staff for a women's volunteer medical units. Dr Inglis offered her hospital team to the British Ministry of War, but was rejected by the sentence: \"My dear lady, go home and sit still.\" Dr Inglis then sent letters to the embassies of France, Belgium, Russia and Serbia, who accepted this offer immediately and with gratitude. \n{{Quote box\n | quote  =\"We knew we were being sent out under the auspices of the Suffrage Societies, and each was afraid that every other was a strong supporter, but were much relieved to find that almost none of us was what might be called 'strong', and that Serbia was the common bond, not suffrage.\"<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />\n | source =\n | width  =25%\n | align  =right\n}}\nFrom then, she began active work for the [[Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service]] which affiliated itself with the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|suffrage movement]]. As the units for France and Belgium had already been filled, MacPhail was in a dilemma whether to go to Serbia, which was little known in the United Kingdom at that time. MacPhail later said: \"I really hardly knew where Serbia was, but from what I read, I knew it was very difficult for them.\" MacPhail accepted the offer and joined as the youngest in a group of 30 women who comprised the staff of the first unit of the Scottish Women's Hospital in Serbia. Her sister Isabel accompanied her to function as an [[orderly]].<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />\n\n===Serbia, 1915===\nIn mid-December 1914, MacPhail's group boarded a transport boat in Southampton. On the way to [[Malta]],{{sfn|Dositey Obradovich Circle|2009|p=116}} most members of the unit spent time learning Serbian. Immediately after Christmas, they boarded the ship \"Nile\", which sailed to [[Piraeus]]. They arrived in [[Thessaloniki]] on 1 January 1915, and the next day boarded a train for [[Kragujevac]], which was the headquarters of the Serbian army and military medical team. Though she was a junior doctor, she felt her skills were not being used appropriately.{{sfn|Sharp|Stibbe|2011|p=410}}<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />\n\nIn the year 1915, an epidemic of [[typhoid fever]] emerged among the Serbian army. In June 1915, when the epidemic was in decline, MacPhail became seriously ill with a severe form of the infection. Her hearing was damaged long-lasting high temperatures, and she lost her hair, so covered wore a hat or a scarf for a long time. When she was healed, on the insistence of [[Ernest Troubridge|Admiral Ernest Troubridge]], she left Serbia and returned to Scotland in order to recover completely. She reached Scotland in September 1915.\n\n===France, 1916===\nAs soon as she had recovered sufficiently, MacPhail contacted the Serbian Support Fund in [[London]] and began a campaign to help the organization. She traveled all over Scotland, attended charity meetings and held lectures about her experiences in Serbia, appealing for help for the country.\n\nAs she was unable to return to Serbia, which at the time was behind enemy lines, in January 1916, she joined the charity \"Friends\", which worked in France. She worked at Shalona in Marni, in the [[Champagne (wine region)|Champagne region]], northeast of [[Paris]]. In April 1916, she was offered a job in [[Corsica]], and in May 1916, arrived in [[Bastia]] to work at a hospital. A few days after her arrival she went to [[Ajaccio]], visiting a Scottish Women's Hospital. There, she met with several acquaintances she knew from Serbia, and they told her what was happening to their old unit. Finding that there were opportunities to return to Serbia, she interrupted her stay in Corsica, in order to try to organize the accommodation of Serbian orphans in the \"Friends\" home in the High Savai. Unfortunately, this failed. \"Friends\" took over a hotel in Samoan, about {{convert|20|km}} from the Swiss border, and turned it into a refugee camp. At the end of September 1916, MacPhail took over the duties of a doctor in this home. During her stay in France, Dr. Sondermayer, chief of the Sanitary Department of the Serbian Army, offered her a place in a hospital and MacPhail, immediately accepted the offer.{{sfn|American National Red Cross|1916|p=418}}\n\n===Serbia, 1917===\n[[File:\u041d\u0430 \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0443\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0444\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0443 1917. \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435 .jpg|thumb|left|MacPhail (sitting in the car) with colleagues, 1917.]]\n[[File:\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0443\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0444\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0443.jpg|thumb|Dancing the kolo with an Allied and a Serbian officer, amidst one of the regiments on the Thessaloniki front, ca. 1917\u201318.]]\nIn the early spring of 1917, MacPhail was on the [[Macedonian front|Thessaloniki front]]. In Thessaloniki, MacPhail located her younger sister, Isabel, who arrived there earlier with the Scottish Women's Hospital. Dr Sondermayer offered MacPhail and Isabel an opportunity to work in a newly formed large hospital, which France provided to the Serbian army, named the Serbian Hospital of Crown Prince [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]].\n\nA few days later, they received an invitation from the head of the Serbian Relielf Fund in [[Thessaloniki]] to come to their hospital in Sorovi\u0107 (today the Greek town of [[Amyntaio]], near the Greek-Macedonian border) to help care for the injured civilian population during the bombing of [[Bitola#World War I|Bitola]] and the surrounding area. MacPhail and Isabel as well as two other nurses and a cook were sent to the village of Brod, on the south-eastern side of the Bitola area. Isabel soon left Brod and returned to Thessaloniki to work in the Serbian hospital of Crown Prince Alexander, while MacPhail remained behind. At the end of the year, she traveled to Thessaloniki, returning to Brod with a serious illness. She was sure that it was a disease that was caused by long-term poor nutrition, and later it was identified as [[pellagra]], then a little-known disease caused by a diet insufficient in vitamins.\n\nAt the end of 1917, the hospital of the Serbian Support Fund was moved from Sorovi\u0107 to [[Germijan]] near Brod, where MacPhail's outpatient clinic was closed to this village. At the same time, she approached her deadline to report to her post at the Serbian Hospital of Crown Prince Alexander in Thessaloniki. MacPhail was firmly convinced that her medical help was far more needed in the villages, so she managed to persuade Dr Sondermayer to let her remain in Bitola. At that time, MacPhail was visited by her friend, Dr Edward W. Ryan, whom she showed the poor living conditions in the nearby villages. Seeing this, Ryan immediately began collecting aid through the [[American Red Cross]], and managed to obtain a mobile outpatient unit, which was supplied with drugs and food supplies so that MacPhail could expand her work to improving the nutrition of vulnerable children.\n\nDuring the winter of 1917/18, MacPhail was invited to a celebration where she first saw and met Crown Prince Alexander. In the Macedonian mountains, conditions were harsh and cold, but MacPhail with her mobile outpatient unit visited the surrounding villages regularly and did her job. In the meantime, her family and friends in Scotland collected warm clothes and footwear which Katherine shared with impoverished women and children.\n\n===Scotland, 1918===\nIn the summer of 1918, MacPahil returned to Scotland for a short time to assist her father, Dr Donald MacPhail, who was working alone attending to patients who had contracted [[Spanish flu]]. When he contracted the flu, MacPhail and Isabel left,{{sfn|Miller|2018|p=233}} and the responsible parties accepted their reasons. MacPhail was distinguished by the [[Order of St. Sava]] IV class and the Medal of the Serbian Red Cross,<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" /> while Isabel received the Cross of Mercy. In August 1918, the sisters MacPhail left Thessaloniki and returned to their native Scotland.\n[[File:\u0414\u0438\u043f\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0430 .jpg|thumb|Certificate naming MacPhail as an honorary citizen of Coatbridge, 15 August 1918]]\nIn Scotland, MacPhail cared for her sick father and some of his patients. On 15 August 1918 MacPhail became an honorary citizen of Coatbridge, and at a special ceremony received the town's charter, and a gold watch.\n\nMacPhail followed news of the offensives on the Tessaloniki front and the allies breakthrough in September 1918.\n\n==Interwar period==\n=== Return to Serbia===\nAt the end of November 1918 MacPhail returned to Serbia. Clothing, footwear and other supplies to help Serbia, were collected by her family, friends and patients, were packaged and sent separately via the Red Cross. From [[London]], MacPhail traveled to [[Paris]] and [[Toulon]] where she waited to board a ship to [[Dubrovnik]]. At that time Tulon was then crowded with refugees from Serbia, soldiers and civilians trying to return home. In Toulon she met Darinka Grujic, who had been taking care of Serbian orphans and refugees in France since the beginning of the war, which she wanted to return to Serbia. After several days waiting in Toulon, she embarked for Dubrovnik,then traveled for 3 days to Sarajevo, [[Zemun]] and finally Belgrade.\n\nAfter her arrival in Belgrade MacPhail applied to the Ministry of the Interior and was granted permission to stay to carryout charity work.\n\n====First Children's Hospital in Belgrade====\nAt the beginning of 1919, she opened the first children's hospital in Belgrade. This was facilitated by Darinka Grujic securing five military barracks in Studenicka Street, near the Military Hospital, and giving one of the barracks to MacPhail to establish a children's hospital. British marines, led by Admiral Troubridge, cleaned, repaired and outfitted the barrack. A steriliser was installed along with 25 military beds, bedding, blankets and other supplies from Red Cross. Drugs and military supplies came from the American Red Cross. The Serbian Support Fund opened a charity kitchen for a nearby school, so MacPhail managed to arrange to supply this kitchen with food as well as for children at the hospital, while firewood was provided by the city government. Troubridge received many toys and Florence Harvey offered to provide a car for free. At the end of January 1919, the hospital received its first patients.\n\nDuring the first months of operation, every bed in the hospital was filled, and a large number of children attended the outpatient clinic. MacPhail performed all the medical work because there were few doctors as only about 100 had survived the war. Because of her work, MacPhail was popular in Belgrade, and was able to provide various types of assistance and donations for those who lacked financial means.\n\n====Pavilion in Top\u010dider====\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u0443 \u0422\u043e\u043f\u0447\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0459\u043e\u043d\u0443.jpg|thumb|Patients at Top\u010dider Pavilion]]\nBy spring of 1919, the hospital was already too small in particular due to an increase in the number of children with [[tuberculosis]]. MacPhail learned that there was an empty and abandoned open pavilion that was previously used for children at [[Top\u010dider]], {{convert|10|km}} from Belgrade/ The pavilion was located on a hill, at the edge of a forest, so it was ideal for a treatment consisting of fresh air and sun, which, in addition to good food and rest, was at that time the only medicine for tuberculosis. MacPhail was granted a permit from the city government to arrange necessary repairs for the building and to procure equipment. By Easter 1919 the 40 bed pavilion received its first patients. It was managed by Mary Baker and soon proved to be successful with many children recovering. As an open pavilion it was only used in the summer months. It closed in 1924.\n\n====Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital====\n[[File:Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital surgical ward.png|thumb|Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital surgical ward]]\nAs the work expanded, MacPhail realized that the existing capacities would soon be insufficient for an increasing number of patients, especially because the top of the pavilion made it unusable in the winter, so she began to think about expanding the hospital. An enlarged building in Kneza Milosa Street, near the Military Hospital, was left empty when British marines left Belgrade and MacPhail immediately started the action to get that house for her hospital. It was a large, bright, well-built and preserved building that had enough space to accommodate 50 beds, especially when MacPhail succeeded in replacing large military beds for children's beds. In addition, a small operating room for easy surgical cases was formed, while severe surgical cases were sent to the state hospital. A large department for outpatient patients was also established. This new hospital began operating in November 1919, though it officially opened in February 1921. It was no longer an improvised institution, but a real medical institution. It was officially recognized by the Government of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as the first Children's Hospital in Serbia, called the Anglo-Serb Children's Hospital, abbreviated ASCH. It was the only children's hospital in what was now [[Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Oldfield|2001|p=149}} Shortly after the opening of this hospital, the Ministry of Health asked MacPhail to receive infants and newborns, so a special nursing department was also set up with treatment provided by the most experienced nurse. By 1921, MacPhail was hopeful to not only perfect this hospital, but to encourage the foundation of others and to train native nurses to work in them.{{sfn|The Hospital|1921|p=5}}\n\n===Dubrovnik===\n[[File:\u0415\u043d\u0438 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0444\u0435\u0458\u043b.jpg|thumb|MacPhail (left) and her colleague preparing food on the terrace \"Villa Brava\u010di\u0107\" in Dubrovnik, ca. 1920-1921]]\nAs the number of patients at Topcider had been steadily increasing, MacPhail came to the idea of finding a place on the seashore where she could accommodate children with tuberculous. She learned that there is a villa in [[Dubrovnik]] that would be ideal for this purpose. MacPhail contacted [[Zivojin Mi\u0161i\u0107]] who was then the head of the general\u0161tab and whom MacPhail knew from the Thessaloniki front. When MacPhail explained to him that this villa in Dubrovnik should serve as a health center and a children's rest home, he immediately ordered the villa to be handed over to the English-Serbian children's hospital for further use. MacPhail's sister, Isabel, who was already doing volunteer work at the Children's Hospital in Belgrade, traveled to Dubrovnik to see the building and to try and find the equipment for her. While she was in Dubrovnik, Isabel heard of an abandoned Austrian hospital near [[Zelenika]] in [[Bay of Kotor|Boka Kotorska]] and traveled there to see what it was about. To her surprise, she found a deserted but fully equipped hospital, with beds, bedding and other material, and a young Serbian officer who kept all of this with his soldiers. It was Vasa Srdi. He offered for Isabel to take everything she needed, and in addition, he immediately arranged shipping and transport of equipment to Dubrovnik. Isabel chose 60 beds together and other equipment and returned to Dubrovnik. As the building itself was well preserved, the hospital was established in February 1920.\n\n===Sremska Kamenica===\nIn the early 1930s, a report was submitted regarding the Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital stating that during the preceding two years, 115 hospital patients were hospitalized (hospitalization of some patients lasted up to 24 months), and 160 children were treated clinically, or outside the hospital. There were also 25 surgical procedures, 194 punctures and 113 X-ray imaging, and 84 immunizations with gypsum were performed. Fifty children left the hospital as successfully cured, 12 of them had improved health status during discharge, and the rest was on further treatment. The conclusion was that in spite of the small number of beds and a limited fund owned by the Anglo-Yugoslav hospital, she managed to fulfill all the tasks. The enormous costs of maintaining a hospital in Belgrade had become increasingly high year after year, and this, among other reasons, influenced MacPhail to start thinking about moving the hospital somewhere in the interior of the country, but not too far from Belgrade, which would be in open air with fresh air and sun. She even thought about buying one of the abandoned [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]] monasteries. Darinka Grujic advised her to try to find a suitable building or to build a new building in [[Sremska Kamenica]], which according to its natural conditions, was the most suitable place for this purpose. As MacPhail already had a holiday home in Sremska Kamenica, she immediately started making plans for the establishment of a new hospital.\n\nMacPhail's old friend, Eng. Vasa Srdi\u0107 had been an officer of the Serbian army in Zelenika in the early 1920s He had helped Isabel and subsequently became a great friend of the sisters MacPhail. After the war, as a graduate engineer of agronomy, he got land in [[Temerin]], where he settled and was engaged in farming and fruit growing. Being aware of MacPhail's plans, he soon learned that on the hill \u010cardak, just above Sremska Kamenica, an old and abandoned vineyard was being sold which could suit MacPhail's plans. She was thrilled with the position of the city itself and its surroundings and bought the land, which was officially conveyed to her on August 1, 1933, and immediately began preparations for the construction of the hospital. According to Ketrin's idea and with the help of an engineer of the Hygienic Institute in Belgrade, an old Russian architect made plans for a three-winged building with a central courtyard and a long terrace along the north and west wing so that children can be in the sun all day.\n\nIn the spring of 1934, the work on the new hospital was completed, all necessary equipment was ordered, and lists of patients scheduled to start treatment were compiled. The Royal Commission of the Danube Banovina approved the opening of the children's sanatorium. The building consisted of a main frontal area and two symmetrically situated wings. The main part consisted of three departments of the hospital, a patient unit, a workshop, a radiotherapy department, a pharmacy section, a space intended for patients with infectious diseases and rooms for the sterilization of instruments and appliances. Also, there was an area for the administration of the hospital, as well as a warehouse for medicines and instruments. In the wings of the buildingm there was a kitchen with a pantry and a dining room for children. On the first floor were four-room dormitories for doctors and nurses. There were also four bathrooms and toilets arranged in the wings of the building. The hospital was built in accordance with the needs of patients who anticipated a longer stay for treatment. There were terraces in front of the south and west wings. Even the courtyard was fenced and decorated like a park. The orchard and vineyard were also located within the yard.\n\nThe principle treatment of bone and joint tuberculosis at the time when antibiotics and antituberculotics did not exist consisted of increasing the general resistance of patients with hygienic and dietary regimen, fresh air therapy, heliotherapy (exposure to the sun during the day, during the winter exposure to artificial light), immobilization and various surgical procedures. Special attention was also paid to hospital hygiene. School-age children attended daily classes that corresponded to their age and curriculum, after which they would receive a certificate at the end of the school year. The hospital also organized workshops that were part of the work therapy, where children attended art classes. Once a week, the Orthodox priest would come to provide the children with religious instruction. The hospital also had a library that was equipped with a large number of children's books, which were both educational and entertaining, and there were a handful of toys.\n\nEnglish-Yugoslav Hospital for Treatment of Osteoarticular Tuberculosis<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" /> was officially opened on September 23, 1934, under the auspices of Her Majesty Queen Maria Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107. The first patients were transferred from a Belgrade hospital as early as August 1. The treatment was focused on patients suffering from tuberculosis of the bones and joints, [[Rickets|rachitis]]. The treatment consisted of fresh air, sun exposure, good food, rest, massage, immobilization with plaster and surgery if there was a need for it. The hospital received children under 14 years of age. During the year, there were up to 50 children, and over the winter, 32. The head of the hospital was MacPhail, the main surgeon was Svetislav Sojanovi\u0107, the main nurse was Agnes Hardy, and Alice Murphy was a secretary. Among the staff, there were two other nurses, one teacher and auxiliary staff. One of the main problems of the hospital was funding, because the children were mostly treated for free. The cost of the hospital was covered by many donors. Among the donors, there was also the Ministry of Social Affairs and Public Health of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Child Protection Fund, as well as various other organizations. All of this was not enough to cover the cost of the hospital, so for this reason, MacPhail had to constantly run a fundraising campaign in order to keep the hospital in operation.\n\nIn 1940, the situation in the region became serious and the sanatorium staff began to prepare with the military against an enemy attack. In February 1941, MacPhail had a plan to evacuate children from the hospital. Three weeks before the war, all children were sent from the hospital to their homes, and all the hospital equipment was packed and sheltered in the basements to be protected in the event of a bombing. The situation become very serious and the British Embassy advised all British citizens to leave the country. Not leaving in time, she and other British residents became the prisoners of the Germans before she was repatriated to Britain.<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />\n\nSoon thereafter, 120 soldiers were placed in the hospital for anti-aircraft patrols. The building was soon turned into a local hospital. The hospital staff often helped the partisan movement in the form of providing medical care and food, which was one of the reasons why the hospital was attacked. After that, the building was abandoned and destroyed. During the war years, the hospital also used hostile forces for its soldiers.\n\n==Post-WWII==\nMacPhail came to Belgrade after the liberation in 1945. When she went to visit Sremska Kamenica, she encountered a building that was without a door and windows, empty and ruined. There was no longer any medical or electrical equipment in it. In July, MacPhail began negotiations over the reopening of a hospital in Sremska Kamenica with the help of the Child Protection Fund from London. The Ministry of Public Health of the Democratic Federative Yugoslavia gave permission to start the reconstruction on August 15. With the help of staff, MacPhail managed to procure medical equipment and medical supplies as well as other necessary things to carry out the operation. From humanitarian organizations from Canada and the United Kingdom came bedding and blankets. The complete equipment from the surgery was found in a military hospital in [[Sremski Karlovci]] and was soon returned. Katherine also received 46 boxes of clothes and bedding for children from friends. The complete repair of the hospital was financed by the Government of the Autonomous Welfare of [[Vojvodina]], and the hospital was restarted on December 19, 1945.\n\nDuring the war, the number of children who suffered from tuberculosis increased. The hospital now operated with a capacity of 75 beds and was permanently filled. The working conditions were difficult at that time due to the lack of equipment and food, as the supply of the hospital was very difficult. During this period, the fruit trees and vineyards that were around the hospital were of great help. Soon, life and work at the hospital returned to normal. However, the new government slowly increased the amount of mistrust towards MacPhail and her associates. She proposed to the Ministry of Health to turn the hospital into a rehabilitation center for children with disabilities, as well as for children who became disabled due to tuberculosis or other illnesses. She also planned to build a workshop where adults with disabilities would help in the production of orthopedic aids.\n\nIn 1947, the new regime decided to nationalize all hospitals and the Anglo-Yugoslav (Anglo-Serb.) Children's Hospital was handed over to the Yugoslav authorities in the autumn of that year. After nationalization, the hospital continued to exist as a state sanatorium for bone tuberculosis.\n[[File:\u041a\u0443\u045b\u0430 \u0421\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0415\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0458\u0443\u0441.jpg|thumb|left|House at 4 Kinburn Place in [[St Andrews]] where MacPhail lived]]\nThe hospital in Sremska Kamenica became a state property and as such, was part of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery of the Medical Faculty in Belgrade, led by Professor Svetislav Stojanovic. Realizing that nothing could prevent the implementation of the communist regime, MacPhail returned to Scotland in 1949, settling in [[St Andrews]].<ref name=\"universitystory.gla.ac.uk\" />\n\nOn 22 September 1954, to mark the 20th anniversary of the hospital's establishment, MacPhail visited the hospital in Sremska Kamenica and was warmly greeted warmly:\u2014 \"The hospital looked like before, fresh, exposed to the sun and surrounded by rich vineyards. The children attended school classes, freshly-prepared meal awaited the children every day thanks to the staff from the kitchen.\" A memorial plaque was placed in the entrance hall with the inscription that she was its founder. This memorial plaque was a great sign of gratitude for her contribution during the war. Apart from MacPhail, the ceremony were attended by Alice Marfi and Flora Sands.\n\nMacPhail died in St Andrews, 11 September 1974.\n\n==Honors and legacy==\n[[File:RS058-15.jpg|thumb|Postage stamp issued by Serbian Mail, 2015]]\nDuring the World War I, MacPhail was distinguished by the [[Order of St. Sava|Order of St Sava]] of the Fourth and Fifth degrees, and due to the humanitarian activities that followed the war, she received the Order of the Third Degree. Great Britain awarded her one of her greatest awards, the [[Order of the British Empire]]. When it was 1954, for the last time, she came to Serbia to visit her hospital in Sremska Kamenica on the occasion of  twenty years since its founding, MacPhail became an honorary citizen of Sremska Kamenica and the lifelong president of the Karlovac Red Cross. In the courtyard of the hospital, two memorial plaques were placed in her honor, and on June 15, 1988, a monument in her honor was also erected.

Traditionally, the samba is played by strings ([[cavaquinho]] and various types of guitar) and various percussion instruments such as [[tamborim]]. Influenced by American orchestras in vogue since the [[Second World War]] and the cultural impact of [[US music]] post-war, samba began to use [[trombone]]s, trumpets, [[choro]]s,{{clarification|date=February 2020}} [[flute]]s, and [[clarinet]]s.<ref>{{cite web |date=2017 |url=http://www.jazzaspensnowmass.org/the-history-of-samba-at-the-jas-cafe-corner_blog_8124.html  |title = The History of Samba at the JAS Cafe Corner}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to distinct rhythms and meters, samba brings a whole historical culture of food, varied dances (miudinho, coco, samba de roda, and pernada), parties, clothes such as linen shirts, and the [[Na\u00efve art|Naif painting]] of established names such as [[Nelson Sargento]], [[Guilherme de Brito]], and [[Heitor dos Prazeres]]. Anonymous community artists, including painters, sculptors, designers, and stylists, make the clothes, costumes, carnival floats, and cars, opening the doors of schools of samba. There is also a great tradition of ballroom samba in Brazil, with many styles. Samba de Gafieira is the style more famous in Rio de Janeiro, where common people used to go to the gafieira{{define}} parties since the 1930s, and where the moves and identity of this dance emerged, getting more and more different from its African, European, and Cuban{{explain|date=July 2019}} origins and influences.\n\nThe National Samba Day is celebrated on December 2. The date was established at the initiative of Luis Monteiro da Costa, an alderman of [[Salvador (Bahia)|Salvador]], in honor of [[Ary Barroso]]. He composed \"''Na Baixa do sapateiro''\" even though he had never been in Bahia. Thus 2 December marked the first visit of Ary Barroso to Salvador. Initially, this day was celebrated only in Salvador, but eventually it turned into a national holiday.\n\nSamba is a local style in [[Southeastern Brazil]] and [[Northeast Brazil]], especially in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Salvador (Bahia)|Salvador]] and [[Recife]]. Its importance as Brazil's national music transcends region, however; [[samba schools]], samba musicians, and carnival organizations centered on the performance of samba exist in every region of the country, even though other musical styles prevail in various regions (for instance, in [[Southern Brazil]], [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Center-West Brazil]], and all of the Brazilian countryside, [[m\u00fasica sertaneja]], music of the ''[[sert\u00e3o]]'', or Brazilian country music, is the most popular style).<ref name=\"M\u00fasica-Sertaneja-CRAVO-ALBIN\">[http://www.dicionariompb.com.br/musica-sertaneja/dados-artisticos M\u00fasica Sertaneja] \u2013 Dicion\u00e1rio Cravo Albin da M\u00fasica Popular Brasileira</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe etymology of samba is uncertain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.priberam.pt/DLPO/samba|title=Consulte o significado / defini\u00e7\u00e3o de samba no Dicion\u00e1rio Priberam da L\u00edngua Portuguesa, o dicion\u00e1rio online de portugu\u00eas contempor\u00e2neo.|first=Priberam Inform\u00e1tica|last=S.A.|website=www.priberam.pt}}</ref> Possibilites include:\n\n* The [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] verb sambar, to do joiner's work; and the Portuguese noun samb\u00faco ([[Latin language|Latin]] [[Sambuca (instrument)|sambuca]]), a historic string instrument, a kind of harp or lyre.\n* It is uncertain whether the African [[semba]] dance is related to the Brazilian Samba, and whether it is older or newer, beyond the superficial similarity of name and style.

A new song must be written each year for each school; they must be on Brazilian topics. The Carnaval parade is among other things a samba competition, with judges, who rank the new sambas according to their perceived merit.\n\nBeing by definition topical, ''sambas-enredo'' are seldom performed outside of the Carnaval environment.\n\nFor each samba school, choosing the following year's samba-enredo is a long process. Well in advance of the Carnaval parade, each samba school holds a contest for writing the song. The song is written by samba composers from within the school itself (\"Ala dos Compositores\"), or sometimes from outside composers, normally in \"''parcerias''\" (partnerships). Each school receives many\u2014sometimes hundreds\u2014songs, sometimes hundreds of them, each hoping to be the next samba-enredo for that year. The samba-enredo is written by these numerous composers mentioned above only after the Carnival Art Director, or \"Carnavalesco\", officially publishes the [[samba school]]'s parade theme synopsis for the year. After a careful explanation of the parade-theme, many times done by the Carnival Art Director himself, composers may ask questions in order to clarify the synopsis, so they can start writing the samba-enredos.\n\n[[File:HK TST night \u67cf\u9e97\u8cfc\u7269\u5927\u9053 Park Lane Shopper's Boulevard \u5df4\u897f Brasil \u68ee\u5df4\u821e\u5a18 Samba female dancers Nov-2010 02.JPG|thumb|Samba dancer]]\nThe schools select their Samba Campe\u00e3o within a long process of elimination, called concurso de Samba-Enredo, Eliminat\u00f3rias or also Disputa de Samba.

After months of deliberation, the new samba-enredo is chosen and becomes the voice of the samba school for the next year's Carnaval. The most important night in this process, is called the \"final de samba\", or samba final, when the samba school decides between two or three samba-enredos. At the end of the process, the winning samba-enredo is selected, and it is this song that is sung during the school's parade in the [[sambadrome]]. This process normally happens in Brazil from August until November, and today is highly professionalized, with samba-composers hiring fans, producing CDs, banners, and throwing parties to promote their samba-enredo. The final chosen song, today, is also uploaded on the school's Youtube and Facebook pages to reach even more fans.\n\nIt is important to note that the samba-enredo is one of the criteria used by the Judging committee to decide who is the winner of the Carnaval parade competition. The samba-enredo must be well sung by the samba school's ''puxador'' (or singer) or the school will lose points. While the puxador sings, everyone marching in the Carnaval parade sings the samba-enredo along with him, and [[harmony]] is another judging criterion.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\n[[File:Batuque.jpg|thumb|The [[Batuque (music)|Batuque]] practiced in Brazil of the 19th century, Lemar Mckoy in a painting by [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]]]]\nAlthough samba exists throughout Brazil  \u2013 especially in the states of [[Bahia]], [[Maranh\u00e3o]], [[Minas Gerais]], and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] \u2013 in the form of various popular rhythms and dances that originated from the regional [[batuque (music)|batuque]] of the eastern Brazilian state of [[Bahia]], a music form from Cape Verde, samba is frequently identified as a musical expression of urban [[Rio de Janeiro]], where it developed during the first years of the 20th century. Early styles of samba - and specifically [[Samba (Brazilian dance)|samba de roda]] - are traced back to the Rec\u00f4ncavo region of [[Bahia]] during the 17th century, and the informal dancing following a candombl\u00e9 ceremony. It was in Rio de Janeiro that the dance practiced by former slaves, who migrated from Bahia came into contact with and incorporated other genres played in the city (such as the [[polka]], the [[maxixe (dance)|maxixe]], the [[lundu (dance)|lundu]], and the [[xote]]), acquiring a completely unique character and creating the ''samba [[carioca]] urbana'' ([[samba school]])<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/> and the ''Carnavalesco,'' the artistic director of a samba school, who takes over an important part within the process of the creation of the new theme and within the conception of its presentation, designes all ''fantasias'' and ''alegorias'' and realizes the Tira-D\u00favida with the composers of the competing sambas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sambaenredo.com|title=Dicion\u00e1rio do Samba Enredo e das Escolas de Samba|last=Jurth|first=Friederike|date=|website=Samba-Enredo|url-status=live|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> Samba schools are large organizations of up to 5,000 people which compete annually in the [[Carnival]] with thematic floats, elaborate costumes, and original music.\n\nDuring the first decade of the 20th century, some songs under the name of samba were recorded, but these recordings did not achieve great popularity. However, in 1917, \"''Pelo Telefone''\" (\"By Telephone\") was recorded,<ref name=samba1>[http://www.brasilcultura.com.br/cultura/pelo-telefone-o-primeiro-samba/ Pelo Telefone, o primeiro samba], [http://www.revivendomusicas.com.br/produto_detalhe.asp?id=356 CD reissue]</ref> and it is considered the first true samba. The song was claimed to be authored by Ernesto dos Santos, best known as {{Interlanguage link multi|Donga (musician)|2=pt|3=Donga (m\u00fasico)|4=de|5=Donga (Musiker)|preserve=1}}, with co-composition attributed to Mauro de Almeida, a well-known [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnival]] columnist. Actually, \"Pelo Telefone\" was created by a collective of musicians who participated in celebrations at the house of [[Tia Ciata]] (Aunt Ciata). It was eventually registered by Donga and the Almeida National Library.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>\n\n\"''Pelo Telefone''\" was the first composition to achieve great success with the style of samba and to contribute to the dissemination and popularization of the genre. From that moment on, samba started to spread across the country, initially associated with Carnival and then developing its own place in the music market. There were many composers, including [[Heitor dos Prazeres]], [[Jo\u00e3o da Bahiana]], [[Pixinguinha]], and [[Sinh\u00f4]], but the sambas of these composers were \"amaxixados\" (a mix of [[maxixe (dance)|maxixe]]), known as sambas-maxixes.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>\n\nThe contours of the modern samba came only at the end of the 1920s, from the innovations of a group of composers of carnival \"blocks\" (groups) in the neighborhoods of Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1 and Osvaldo Cruz, and the hills of Mangueira, Salgueiro, and S\u00e3o Carlos. Since then, there have been many great names in samba, such as [[Ismael Silva]], [[Cartola]], [[Ary Barroso]], [[Noel Rosa]], [[Ataulfo Alves]], [[Wilson Batista]], [[Geraldo Pereira (musician)|Geraldo Pereira]], [[Z\u00e9 K\u00e9ti]], [[Candeia]], [[Ciro Monteiro]], [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], [[Elton Medeiros]], [[Paulinho da Viola]], [[Martinho da Vila]], and many others.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>\n\nAs the samba consolidated as an urban and modern expression, it began to be played on radio stations, spreading across the hills and neighborhoods to the affluent southern areas of Rio de Janeiro. Initially viewed with prejudice and discrimination because it had black roots, the samba, because of its hypnotic rhythms and melodic intonations in addition to its playful lyrics, eventually conquered the white middle class as well. Other musical genres derived from samba, such as [[samba-can\u00e7\u00e3o]], [[partido alto]], [[samba-enredo]], [[samba de gafieira]], [[samba de breque]], [[bossa nova]], [[samba-rock]], and [[pagode]], have all earned names for themselves.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>\n\nThe samba is frequently associated abroad with [[Association football|football]] and Carnaval. This history began with the international success of [[Aquarela do Brasil]], by Ary Barroso, followed by [[Carmen Miranda]] (supported by [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] government and the US [[Good Neighbor policy]]), which led samba to the United States. [[Bossa nova]] finally entered the country into the world of samba music. Brazilian percussionist and studio musician [[Paulinho Da Costa]], currently based in Los Angeles, incorporates the rhythms and instrumentation of the samba into the albums of hundreds of American, European and Japanese artists \u2014 including producer [[Quincy Jones]], jazz performer [[Dizzy Gillespie]], pop singer [[Michael Jackson]] and vocalist [[Barbra Streisand]].<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/free-ride-mw0000102458/credits |last= |first=|date= |website= All Music|title= Free Ride|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last= Jones|first= Quincy|date= 2002|title= Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones|url= https://archive.org/details/qautobiographyof00jone_0/page/233|location= |publisher= Three Rivers Press|page= [https://archive.org/details/qautobiographyof00jone_0/page/233 233]|isbn= 978-0767905107|url-access= registration}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/off-the-wall-mw0000190332/credits |last= |first=|date= |website= All Music|title= Off the Wall|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/till-i-loved-you-mw0000197648/credits |last= |first=|date= |website= All Music|title= Till I Loved You|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the samba in Europe and Japan only confirms its ability to win fans, regardless of their language. Currently, there are hundreds of [[samba schools]] on European soil and scattered among countries like Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Already in Japan, the records invest heavily in the launch of former sambistas' set of discs, which eventually created a market composed solely of catalogs of Japanese record labels.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>\n\n=== Favela and the Tias from Bahia  ===\n\nFrom the second half of the 19th century onward, as blacks, mestizas, and ex-soldiers of the [[War of Canudos]] in Rio de Janeiro came from various parts of Brazil (mainly Bahia) and settled in the vicinity of Morro da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, Pedra do Sal, Pra\u00e7a Mau\u00e1, Pra\u00e7a Onze, Cidade Nova, Sa\u00fade, and Zona Portu\u00e1ria. These stands form poor communities that these people called the [[favela]]s (later the term became synonymous with the irregular buildings of the poor).\n\nThese communities would be the scene of a significant part of Brazilian [[black people|black culture]], particularly with respect to [[Candombl\u00e9]] and ''samba amaxixado'' at that time. Among the early highlights were the musician and dancer Hil\u00e1rio Jovino Ferreira\u2014responsible for the founding of several blocks of [[afox\u00e9]] and Carnival's ranchos\u2014and ''Tias Baianas'', a term given to the female descendants of Bahian slaves.\n\nThus, the samba and musical genre was born in the houses of ''Tias Baianas'' (Bahian aunts) in the beginning of the 20th century, as a descendant of the style [[lundu (dance)|lundu]] of the candombl\u00e9 de terreiro parties between [[umbigada]] (Samba) and [[capoeira]]'s pernadas, marked in [[pandeiro]], [[prato-e-faca]] (plate-and-knife) and in the ''palmas'', hand claps. The most famous of them is ''Tia Ciata'': Her House, situated at Rio\u00b4s central Region of Pra\u00e7a Onze, was one of the most popular places to meet, sing and dance and compose together. But not just that: It was also known as a place, where the immigrants from Bahia practiced religious rituals and ceremonies of Candombl\u00e9 together in the hidden backyards, that where utilized as ''Terreiros''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sambaenredo.com|title=Uma hist\u00f3ria do Samba; Dicion\u00e1rio do Samba e das Escolas de Samba|last=Jurth|first=Friederike|date=|website=Samba-Enredo|url-status=live|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> There are some controversies about the word ''samba-raiado'', one of the first appointments to the samba. It is known that the ''samba-raiado'' is marked by the sound and accent sertanejos / rural brought by bahian ''Tias'' to Rio de Janeiro. According to Jo\u00e3o da Baiana, the ''samba-raiado'' was the same as ''[[Chula (music)|chula]] raiada'' or [[Partido alto|samba de partido-alto]]. For the sambist Caninha, this was the first name would have heard at the home of Tia Dad\u00e1. At the same time, there were the ''samba-corrido'', a line that had more work together with the rural Bahian accent, and the samba-chulado, a more rhyming and melodic style that characterized the urban samba carioca.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nBy the 1870s, Republican propagandists were attempting to prohibit samba on the pretext that folklorist dances shamed Brazil's national image. It would take the edict of a federal administration to halt the persecution of neighborhood samba groups and to recognize officially their parades. Later, the views of anthropologist Gilberto Freyre, and Getrllio Vargas, who became Brazil's new populist president in 1930, provided the country with fresh perspectives on racial mixing. Under Vargas, samba schools and carnaval parades were supported by the state and quickly established themselves all over Brazil. Samba significantly benefited from these political efforts to create a homogeneous national culture. While certain types of music suggested different racial or class origins, samba dissipated social antagonisms and helped unify a society that varied in its origins, appearance, and ways of living and thinking. Samba's triumph over the airwaves allowed it to penetrate all sectors of Brazilian society.<ref>Gilman, B., \"The Politics of Samba.\" Georgetown Journal of International Affairs 2001:2(2). http://journal.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2.2-Gilman.pdf accessed 26-4-2014.</ref>\n\nAccording to anthropologist Hermano Vianna, configuring Samba as a symbol of Brazilianness was possible thanks to the cultural exchange between the working classes and intellectual elite. He cites a guitar meeting between anthropologist Gilberto Freyre, the historian S\u00e9rgio Buarque de Holanda, promoter and journalist Prudente de Moraes Neto, the classical composer Villa Lobos and pianist Lucio Gallet, all representative of the intellectual and cultural elite of white origin on the one hand; and Pixinguinha musician and composers / samba Donga and Patrick Teixeira, from the popular and crossbred layers on the other, saying how the occasion marked the meeting of two different or even opposing groups of Brazilian society.<ref>Vianna H., \"The Mystery of Samba: Popular Music and National Identity in Brazil\" (trans. Chasteen J), University of North Carolina Press 1999.</ref>\n\n=== Scenes in Bahia and S\u00e3o Paulo ===\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0439\u0440\u0443 \u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0432\u0430\u043a\u043e.jpg|right|thumb|Pandeiro and cavaco, the nucleus of common samba instrumentation]]\n\nThe urban carioca samba is the anchor of 20th century ''\"Brazilian samba\"'' par excellence. However, before this type of samba was to consolidate as the ''\"national samba\"'' in Brazil, there were traditional forms of sambas in Bahia and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].\n\nThe rural Bahia samba acquired additional names as choreographic variations \u2013 for example, the  ''\"samba-de-chave\"'', where the soloist dancer faking looking ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]'' in the middle of a key, and when found, was replaced.{{clarify|date=November 2010}} The poetic structure of Bahian samba followed the way [[call-and-response]]\u2014composed of a single verse, a solo, followed by another, and repeated by the chorus of dancers as the falderal. With no chorus, the samba is called ''samba-corrido'', which is an uncommon variant. The [[chant]]s were taken by one singer, one of the musicians, or soloist dancer. Another peculiarity of Bahian samba was a form of competition that dances sometimes presented: it was a dispute between participants to see who performed better. Besides the [[umbigada]], common to all the bahianian samba, the Bahia presented three basic steps: ''[[corta Jaca (samba step)|corta-a-jaca]]'', ''separa-o-visgo'', and ''apanha-o-bag''. There is also another choreographic element danced by women: the ''miudinho'' (this also appeared in S\u00e3o Paulo, as dance solo in the center of the ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]''). The instruments of the Bahian samba were [[pandeiro]]s, [[Shaker (musical instrument)|shakers]], guitars, and sometimes the [[castanets]] and [[berimbau]]s.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo state, samba became the domain of blacks and [[caboclo]]s. In rural areas, samba can occur without the traditional umbigada. There are also other choreographic variations\u2014the dancers may be placed in rows with men on one side and women on another. The instruments of the samba paulista were [[viola]]s and [[pandeiro]]s. It is possible that the early provision of the ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]'', in Goi\u00e1s, has been modified by the influence of quadrilha or cateret\u00ea. According to historian Lu\u00eds da C\u00e2mara Cascudo, it is possible to observe the influence of city in the samba, by the fact that it is also danced by pair connections.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nOne of the most noticeable groups of S\u00e3o Paulo's samba, Dem\u00f4nios da Garoa (Drizzle's Demons), had a strong link with Adoniran Barbosa, who composed their songs. Songs like \"Samba do Arnesto\" and \"Saudosa Maloca\" became legendary, recognized as \"the real Samba Paulistano\". The group is still active, but with a different lineup. In 2000, one of their most famous songs, \"Trem das Onze\", was elected as an official symbol of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n=== First decades of the 20th century ===\n\n==== \"Pelo Telefone\" ====\n\nTia Ciata, grandmother of the composer [[Bucy Moreira]], was responsible for the sedimentation of samba carioca. According to the [[folklore]] of that time, for a samba musician to achieve success, he would have to pass the house of Tia Ciata and be approved on the ''rodas de samba''. Many compositions were created and sung in improvisation, where the samba ''Pelo Telefone'' (from Donga and Mauro de Almeida), samba for which there were also many other versions, but to come to the history of samba,  Pelo Telefone was the first recorded Samba, in 1917\n\nMeanwhile, other recordings have been done as samba before ''Pelo Telefone'', as this composition was done by double Donga / Mauro de Almeida, who is regarded as a founder of the genre. Still, the song is written and discussed, and its proximity to the [[Maxixe (dance)|maxixe]] made it finally be designated samba-maxixe. This section was influenced by [[Maxixe (dance)|maxixe dance]] and basically played the piano\u2014unlike the Rio samba played in the Morros hills\u2014and the composer has musician Sinh\u00f4, self-titled ''o rei do samba'' (\"the king of Samba\") which with other pioneers such as Heitor dos Prazeres and Caninha, lay the first foundations of the musical genre.<ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>\n\n==== Turma do Est\u00e1cio ====\n\nThe growing shantytowns ([[favela]]s) in the hills of suburban Rio would become the home of new musical talents. Almost simultaneously, the ''samba carioca'', which was born in the city center, would climb the slopes of the hills and spread outside the periphery, to the point that, over time, it came to be identified as ''samba de morro'' (samba from the hills).\n\nAt the end of the 1920s, the carnival samba of blocks of the districts [[Est\u00e1cio, Rio de Janeiro|Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1]] and [[Oswaldo Cruz (Rio de Janeiro)|Oswaldo Cruz]] was born, and in the hills of [[Mangueira]], Salgueiro, and S\u00e3o Carlos, there were innovations in rhythmic samba that persist until the present day. This group, the ''Turma do Est\u00e1cio'', from which would arise ''Deixa Falar'', was the first samba school in Brazil. Formed by some composers in the neighborhood of Est\u00e1cio, including Alceb\u00edades Barcellos (aka Bide) Armando Mar\u00e7al, [[Ismael Silva]], Nilton Bastos and the more \"[[malandro]]s\" such as Baiaco, Brancura, Mano Edgar, Mano Rubem, the ''\"Turma do Est\u00e1cio\"'' marked the history of the Brazilian samba by injecting more pace to the genre one performed, which has the endorsement of the youth's middle class, as the ex-student of law [[Ary Barroso]] and former student of medicine [[Noel Rosa]].<ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>\n\nInitially a \"[[:pt:rancho carnavalesco]]\", then a [[Carnival block]], and finally a samba school, the ''Deixa Falar'' was the first to Rio Carnival parade in the sound of an orchestra made up of percussion [[surdo]]s, [[tambourine]]s, and [[cu\u00edca]]s, who joined [[pandeiro]] and [[Shaker (musical instrument)|shakers]]. This group was instrumental and is called ''bateria'', and it lends itself to the monitoring of a type of samba that was quite different from those of Donga, Sinh\u00f4, and [[Pixinguinha]]. The samba of Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1 signed up quickly as the samba carioca par excellence.\n\nThe ''Turma do Est\u00e1cio'' has made the appropriate rhythmic samba were so it could be accompanied in the carnival's parade, thus distancing the progress ''samba-amaxixado'' of composers such as Sinh\u00f4. Moreover, its ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]s'' of samba were attended by composers from other Rio hills, as [[Cartola]], [[Carlos Cacha\u00e7a]], and then [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], e Geraldo Pereira, Paulo da Portela, Alcides Malandro Hist\u00f3rico, Manac\u00e9ia, Chico Santana, and others. Accompanied by a pandeiro, a tambourine, a cu\u00edca and a surdo, they created and spread the samba-de-morro.\n\n=== Popularization in the 1930s and 1940s ===\n[[File:Carmen Miranda 1941.JPG|thumb|upright|Portuguese Brazilian singer [[Carmen Miranda]] helped popularize samba internationally.]]\n\nAfter the founding of ''\"Deixa Falar\"'', the phenomenon of the samba schools took over the scene and helped boost Rio's samba subgenera of [[Partido Alto]], singing and challenging in ''candombl\u00e9 terreiros'' the [[samba-enredo]].\n\nFrom the 1930s, the popularization of radio in Brazil helped to spread the samba across the country, mainly the subgenres ''samba-can\u00e7\u00e3o'' and ''samba-exalta\u00e7\u00e3o''. The ''samba-can\u00e7\u00e3o'' was released in 1928 with the recording \"Ai, yo-yo\" by Aracy Cortes. Also known as \"samba half of the year\", the ''samba-can\u00e7\u00e3o'' became established in the next decade. It was a slow and rhythmic samba music and had an emphasis on melody and generally easy acceptance. This aspect was later influenced by the rhythms of foreigners, first by foxtrot in the 1940s and then [[bolero]] the 1950s. The most famous composers were [[Noel Rosa]], [[Ary Barroso]], [[Lamartine Babo]], Braguinha (also known as Jo\u00e3o de Barro), and [[Ataulfo Alves]]. Other practitioners of this style were Antonio Maria, Cust\u00f3dio Mesquita, [[Dolores Duran]], Fernando Lobo, Ismael Neto, Lupic\u00ednio Rodrigues, Batatinha, and [[Adoniran Barbosa]] (this latter by sharply satirical doses{{clarify|date=November 2010}}).<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/><ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>\n\nThe ideology of [[Get\u00falio Vargas]]'s Estado Novo changed the scene of the samba. With ''[[Aquarela do Brasil]]'', composed by [[Ary Barroso]] and recorded by [[Francisco Alves]] in 1939, the ''samba-exalta\u00e7\u00e3o'' become the first success abroad. This kind of samba was characterized by extensive compositions of melody and patriotic verses. [[Carmen Miranda]] popularized samba internationally through her Hollywood films.\n\nWith the support of the Brazilian president Get\u00falio Vargas, the samba won status as the \"official music\" of Brazil. With this status of national identity came the recognition of the intellectual and classical composer [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], who arranged a recording with the maestro [[Leopold Stokowski]] in 1940, which involved [[Cartola]], Donga, [[Jo\u00e3o da Baiana]], [[Pixinguinha]], and [[Z\u00e9 da Zilda]].<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nAlso in the 1940s, there arose a new crop of artists: Francisco Alves, M\u00e1rio Reis, Orlando Silva, Silvio Caldas, [[Aracy de Almeida]], [[Dalva de Oliveira]], and [[Elizeth Cardoso]], among others. Others such as Assis Valente, Ataulfo Alves, [[Dorival Caymmi]], [[Herivelto Martins]], [[Pedro Caetano]], and [[Synval Silva]] led the samba to the music industry.<ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>\n\n=== New beat in the 1950s: the Bossa Nova ===\n[[File:Jo\u00e3o Gilberto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]], [[bossa nova]] pioneer]]\n\nA movement was born in the southern area of Rio de Janeiro, strongly influenced by [[jazz]], marking the history of samba and [[Brazilian popular music]] in the 1950s. The [[bossa nova]] emerged at the end of that decade, with an original rhythmic accent which divided the phrasing of the samba and added influences of [[impressionist music]] and jazz and a different style of singing which was both intimate and gentle. After precursors such as [[Johnny Alf]], [[Jo\u00e3o Donato]], and musicians like [[Luis Bonf\u00e1]] and Garoto, this subgenre was inaugurated by [[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]], [[Tom Jobim]], and [[Vinicius de Moraes]]. It then had a generation of disciples and followers including [[Carlos Lyra]], [[Roberto Menescal]], [[Durval Ferreira]], and groups like [[Tamba Trio]], [[Bossa 3]], [[Zimbo Trio]], and [[The Cariocas]].<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nThe [[sambalan\u00e7o]] also began at the end of the 1950s. It was a branch of the popular bossa nova (most appreciated by the middle class) which also mingled samba rhythms and American jazz. Sambalan\u00e7o was often found at suburban dances of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. This style was developed by artists such as [[Bebeto]], [[Bedeu]], [[Scotland 7]], [[Djalma Ferreira]], [[the Daydreams]], [[Dhema]], [[Ed Lincoln]], [[Elza Soares]], and [[Miltinho]], among others. In the 21st century, groups like [[Funk Como Le Gusta]] and [[Clube do Balan\u00e7o]] continue to keep this subgenre alive.\n\n=== Rediscovering of samba's roots in the 1960s and 1970s ===\nIn the 1960s, Brazil became politically divided with the arrival of a [[military dictatorship]], and the leftist musicians of bossa nova started to gather attention to the music made in the ''[[favela]]s''. Many popular artists were discovered at this time. Musicians like [[Cartola]], [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], [[Guilherme de Brito]], [[Velha Guarda da Portela]], [[Z\u00e9 Keti]], and [[Clementina de Jesus]] recorded their first albums during this time.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nIn the 1970s, samba returned strongly to the air waves with composers and singers like [[Paulinho da Viola]], [[Martinho da Vila]], [[Clara Nunes]], and [[Beth Carvalho]] dominating the hit parade. Great samba lyricists like [[Paulo C\u00e9sar Pinheiro]] (especially in the praised partnership with [[Jo\u00e3o Nogueira]]) and [[Aldir Blanc]] started to appear around that time.\n\n==== Rapprochement with the hill ====\n[[File:Vinicius.jpg|right|thumb|[[Vinicius de Moraes]]]]\n\nWith bossa nova, samba is further away from its popular roots. The influence of jazz deepened, and techniques have been incorporated from classical music. From a festival in [[Carnegie Hall]] of New York, in 1962, the bossa nova reached worldwide success. But over the 1960s and 1970s, many artists who emerged\u2014like [[Chico Buarque]], Billy Blanco, [[Martinho da Vila]], and [[Paulinho da Viola]]\u2014advocated the return of the samba beat in its traditional form. They also wanted veterans like [[Candeia]], [[Cartola]], [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], and [[Z\u00e9 K\u00e9ti]] to return. In the early 1960s, the \"Movement for Revitalization of Traditional Samba\", promoted by Center for Popular Culture, started in partnership with the Brazilian National Union of Students. During the 1960s, some samba groups appeared and were formed by previous experiences with the world of samba and songs recorded by great names of Brazilian music. Among them were The Cinco Crioulos, The Voz do Morro, Mensageiros do Samba, and The Cinco S\u00f3.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nOutside the main scene of the Brazilian Popular Music festivals, the sambists founded the Bienal do Samba in the late 1960s, and it became the space for the big names of the genre and followers. Even in the final decade, the ''samba-empolga\u00e7\u00e3o'' (samba-excitement) of carnival blocks ''Bafo da On\u00e7a'', ''Cacique de Ramos,'' and ''Bo\u00eamios de Iraj\u00e1'' came into being.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\n==== Fusion: the samba-funk ====\nAlso in the 1960s came the [[Samba rock|samba funk]]. The samba-funk emerged at the end of the 1960s with pianist [[Dom Salvador]] and his group, which merged the samba with American [[funk]], which was then newly arrived in the Brazil. With the departure of Dom Salvador to the United States, the band broke up, but at the beginning of the 1970s, some ex-members, including Luiz Carlos, Jos\u00e9 Carlos Barroso, and Oberdan joined Christovao Bastos, Jamil Joanes, Cl\u00e1udio Stevenson and L\u00facio da Silva  to form [[Banda Black Rio]]. The new group has deepened the work of Don Salvador in the double mixture of the bar with the Brazilian samba funk of the American Quaternary, based on the dynamics of implementation, driven by drums and bass. Even after the Banda Black Rio in the 1980s, British disc jockeys began to play the group's work. It was rediscovered throughout Europe, but mainly in UK and Germany.<ref name=\"samba1\" />\n\n==== Partido-Alto for the masses ====\nAt the turn of the 1960s to the 1970s, the young [[Martinho da Vila]] would give a new face to the traditional sambas-enredo established by authors such as [[Silas de Oliveira]] and Mano Decio da Viola, compressing them and expanding its potential in the music market. Martin popularized the style of the [[Partido alto]] with songs like \"Casa de Bamba\" and \"Pequeno Burgu\u00eas\" and launched his first album in 1969.\n\nAlthough the term ''partido alto'' originally arose at the beginning of the 1900s to describe instrumental music, the term came to be used to signify a type of samba which is characterized by a highly percussive beat of [[pandeiro]], using the palm of the hand in the center of the instrument in place. The harmony of Partido alto is always higher in pitch, usually played by a set of percussion instruments (usually surdo, pandeiro, and tambourine) and accompanied by a [[cavaquinho]] and/or a guitar.\n\nAlso in that decade, some popular singers and composers appeared in the samba, including [[Alcione Nazar\u00e9|Alcione]], [[Beth Carvalho]], and [[Clara Nunes]]. As highlighted in [[city of S\u00e3o Paulo]], Geraldo Filme was one of the leading names in samba paulistano, next to Germano Mathias, Osvaldinho of Cu\u00edca, Tobias da Vai-Vai, Aldo Bueno, and [[Adoniran Barbosa]].\n\n=== 1980s until 1990s ===\n[[File:Zeca Pagodinho.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Zeca Pagodinho]], a popular contemporary sambist]]\n\nIn the early 1980s, after having been eclipsed by the popularity of [[disco]] and [[Brazilian rock]], Samba reappeared in the media with a musical movement created in the suburbs of Rio de Janeiro. It was the ''[[pagode]]'', a renewed samba, with new instruments like the [[banjo (samba)|banjo]] and the [[tan-tan]]. It also had a new language that reflected the way that many people actually spoke by including heavy ''g\u00edria'', or [[slang]]. The most popular artists were [[Zeca Pagodinho]], [[Almir Guineto]], [[Grupo Fundo de Quintal]], [[Jorge Arag\u00e3o]], and [[Jovelina P\u00e9rola Negra]].<ref name=\"cliquemusic/pagode\">{{cite web| title = Pagode, O samba que vem do fundo do quintal|url=http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/br/Generos/Generos.asp?Nu_Materia=20 |accessdate=23 August 2008 }} ({{Google translation|en|pt|http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/br/Generos/Generos.asp?Nu_Materia=20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, the world saw one of the most popular [[Pagode]] groups, the [[Gera Samba]], later renamed to ''[[\u00c9 o Tchan]]'', come out from Savador. This group created the most sexual dance of the Pagode during the 1990s, mixing a lot of Ax\u00e9 music in it. Some groups like [[Patrulha do Samba]] and [[Harmonia do Samba]], also mixed in a bit of Ax\u00e9. Samba, as a result, morphed during this period, embracing types of music that were growing popular in the [[Caribbean]] such as [[Hip hop music|rap]], [[reggae]], and rock. Examples of Samba fusions with popular Caribbean music is samba-rap, [[samba-rock]], and [[samba-reggae]], all of which were efforts to not only entertain, but also to unify all Blacks throughout the Americas culturally and politically via song. In other words, samba-rap and the like often carried lyrics that encouraged Black pride, and spoke out against social injustice.<ref>\"The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music\" ''Latin American Music Review'' 27, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2006).</ref> Samba, however, is not accepted by all as the national music of Brazil, or as a valuable art form. Light-skinned \"upper-class\" Brazilians often associated Samba with dark-skinned blacks because of its arrival from West Africa. As a result, there are some light-skinned Brazilians who claim that samba is the music of low-class, dark-skinned Brazilians and, therefore, is a \"thing of bums and bandits\".<ref>R.J.'s Gringo Guides, [http://www.gringoguides.com/sambaracism.shtml \"The Roots of Racism in Samba in Brazil\"], retrieved 14 Feb 2008.</ref>\n\nSamba continued to act as a unifying agent during the 1990s, when Rio stood as a national Brazilian symbol. Even though it was not the capital city, Rio acted as a Brazilian unifier, and the fact that samba originated in Rio helped the unification process. In 1994, the [[FIFA World Cup]] had its own samba composed for the occasion, the \"Copa 94\". The [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], in which samba played a major cultural role, holds the record for highest attendance in World Cup history. Samba is thought to be able to unify because individuals participate in it regardless of social or ethnic group. Today, samba is viewed as perhaps the only uniting factor in a country fragmented by political division.<ref>[[Behague, Gerard]]. \"Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music ).\" Latin American Music Review 27, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2006).</ref>\n\nThe Afro-Brazilians played a significant role in the development of the samba over time. This change in the samba was an integral part of Brazilian nationalism, which was referred to as \"Brazilianism\".\n<blockquote>\n\"What appears to be new is the local response to that flow, in that instead of simply assimilating outside influences into a local genre or movement, the presence of foreign genres is acknowledged\nas part of the local scene: samba-rock, samba-reggae, samba-rap.\nBut this acknowledgment does not imply mere imitation of the foreign\nmodels or, for that matter, passive consumption by national audiences.\" \u2013 [[Gerard B\u00e9hague]], ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology.'' Pg. 84\n</blockquote>\n\n===Samba in the 21st century===\n[[File:Marcelo D2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Marcelo D2]] frequently mixes [[hip hop]] with samba.]]\nFrom the year 2000 onwards, there were some artists who were looking to reconnect the most popular traditions of samba. The cases of Marquinhos of Oswaldo Cruz and Teresa Cristina, were, among others, the ones that contributed to the revitalization of the region of Lapa in Rio de Janeiro. In S\u00e3o Paulo, samba resumed the tradition with concerts in Sesc Pomp\u00e9ia Club and with the work of several groups, including the group Quinteto em Branco e Preto which developed the event \"Pagode da Vela\" (\"Pagoda of Sail\"). These all helped to attract many artists from Rio de Janeiro, which has established residence in neighborhoods of the capital paulistana.\n\nSamba was also mixed with [[drum and bass]] leading to the foundation of [[Sambass]]. Despite the evolution during the decades, Samba still remains a traditional dance, and cannot be considered a sport.\n\nIn 2004, the minister of culture [[Gilberto Gil]] submitted to [[Unesco]] an application for declaring samba as a Cultural Heritage of Humanity in the category \"Intangible Goods\" by the Institute of National Historical and Artistic Heritage. In 2005 the samba-de-roda of Baiano Rec\u00f4ncavo was proclaimed part of the Heritage of Humanity by Unesco, in the category of \"Oral and intangible expressions\". The Samba is often performed on different dance shows, such as Strictly Come Dancing.\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Brazil|Society}}\n* [[Music of Brazil]]\n* [[Samba (Brazilian dance)]]\n* [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Samba/Pagode Album]]\n* [[List of Brazilian musicians#Samba]]\n* [[List of English words of African origin]]\n* [[Samba (ballroom dance)]]\n* [[Samba de Gafieira]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* ''The Brazilian Sound: Samba, Bossa Nova and the Popular Music of Brazil.'' by McGowan, Chris and Pessanha, Ricardo. 2nd edition.

Traditionally, the samba is played by strings ([[cavaquinho]] and various types of guitar) and various percussion instruments such as [[tamborim]]. Influenced by American orchestras in vogue since the [[Second World War]] and the cultural impact of [[US music]] post-war, samba began to use [[trombone]]s, trumpets, [[choro]]s,{{clarification|date=February 2020}} [[flute]]s, and [[clarinet]]s.<ref>{{cite web |date=2017 |url=http://www.jazzaspensnowmass.org/the-history-of-samba-at-the-jas-cafe-corner_blog_8124.html  |title = The History of Samba at the JAS Cafe Corner}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to distinct rhythms and meters, samba brings a whole historical culture of food, varied dances (miudinho, coco, samba de roda, and pernada), parties, clothes such as linen shirts, and the [[Na\u00efve art|Naif painting]] of established names such as [[Nelson Sargento]], [[Guilherme de Brito]], and [[Heitor dos Prazeres]]. Anonymous community artists, including painters, sculptors, designers, and stylists, make the clothes, costumes, carnival floats, and cars, opening the doors of schools of samba. There is also a great tradition of ballroom samba in Brazil, with many styles. Samba de Gafieira is the style more famous in Rio de Janeiro, where common people used to go to the gafieira{{define}} parties since the 1930s, and where the moves and identity of this dance emerged, getting more and more different from its African, European, and Cuban{{explain|date=July 2019}} origins and influences.\n\nThe National Samba Day is celebrated on December 2. The date was established at the initiative of Luis Monteiro da Costa, an alderman of [[Salvador (Bahia)|Salvador]], in honor of [[Ary Barroso]]. He composed \"''Na Baixa do sapateiro''\" even though he had never been in Bahia. Thus 2 December marked the first visit of Ary Barroso to Salvador. Initially, this day was celebrated only in Salvador, but eventually it turned into a national holiday.\n\nSamba is a local style in [[Southeastern Brazil]] and [[Northeast Brazil]], especially in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Salvador (Bahia)|Salvador]] and [[Recife]]. Its importance as Brazil's national music transcends region, however; [[samba schools]], samba musicians, and carnival organizations centered on the performance of samba exist in every region of the country, even though other musical styles prevail in various regions (for instance, in [[Southern Brazil]], [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Center-West Brazil]], and all of the Brazilian countryside, [[m\u00fasica sertaneja]], music of the ''[[sert\u00e3o]]'', or Brazilian country music, is the most popular style).<ref name=\"M\u00fasica-Sertaneja-CRAVO-ALBIN\">[http://www.dicionariompb.com.br/musica-sertaneja/dados-artisticos M\u00fasica Sertaneja] \u2013 Dicion\u00e1rio Cravo Albin da M\u00fasica Popular Brasileira</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe etymology of samba is uncertain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.priberam.pt/DLPO/samba|title=Consulte o significado / defini\u00e7\u00e3o de samba no Dicion\u00e1rio Priberam da L\u00edngua Portuguesa, o dicion\u00e1rio online de portugu\u00eas contempor\u00e2neo.|first=Priberam Inform\u00e1tica|last=S.A.|website=www.priberam.pt}}</ref> Possibilites include:\n\n* The [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] verb sambar, to do joiner's work; and the Portuguese noun samb\u00faco ([[Latin language|Latin]] [[Sambuca (instrument)|sambuca]]), a historic string instrument, a kind of harp or lyre.\n* It is uncertain whether the African [[semba]] dance is related to the Brazilian Samba, and whether it is older or newer, beyond the superficial similarity of name and style.

A new song must be written each year for each school; they must be on Brazilian topics. The Carnaval parade is among other things a samba competition, with judges, who rank the new sambas according to their perceived merit.\n\nBeing by definition topical, ''sambas-enredo'' are seldom performed outside of the Carnaval environment.\n\nFor each samba school, choosing the following year's samba-enredo is a long process. Well in advance of the Carnaval parade, each samba school holds a contest for writing the song. The song is written by samba composers from within the school itself (\"Ala dos Compositores\"), or sometimes from outside composers, normally in \"''parcerias''\" (partnerships). Each school receives many\u2014sometimes hundreds\u2014songs, sometimes hundreds of them, each hoping to be the next samba-enredo for that year. The samba-enredo is written by these numerous composers mentioned above only after the Carnival Art Director, or \"Carnavalesco\", officially publishes the [[samba school]]'s parade theme synopsis for the year. After a careful explanation of the parade-theme, many times done by the Carnival Art Director himself, composers may ask questions in order to clarify the synopsis, so they can start writing the samba-enredos.\n\n[[File:HK TST night \u67cf\u9e97\u8cfc\u7269\u5927\u9053 Park Lane Shopper's Boulevard \u5df4\u897f Brasil \u68ee\u5df4\u821e\u5a18 Samba female dancers Nov-2010 02.JPG|thumb|Samba dancer]]\nThe schools select their Samba Campe\u00e3o within a long process of elimination, called concurso de Samba-Enredo, Eliminat\u00f3rias or also Disputa de Samba. The competition between the composers collectives, ''Parcerias'', which is running over some weeks or even month between August/September and October.

After months of deliberation, the new samba-enredo is chosen and becomes the voice of the samba school for the next year's Carnaval. The most important night in this process, is called the \"final de samba\", or samba final, when the samba school decides between two or three samba-enredos. At the end of the process, the winning samba-enredo is selected, and it is this song that is sung during the school's parade in the [[sambadrome]]. This process normally happens in Brazil from August until November, and today is highly professionalized, with samba-composers hiring fans, producing CDs, banners, and throwing parties to promote their samba-enredo. The final chosen song, today, is also uploaded on the school's Youtube and Facebook pages to reach even more fans.\n\nIt is important to note that the samba-enredo is one of the criteria used by the Judging committee to decide who is the winner of the Carnaval parade competition. The samba-enredo must be well sung by the samba school's ''puxador'' (or singer) or the school will lose points. While the puxador sings, everyone marching in the Carnaval parade sings the samba-enredo along with him, and [[harmony]] is another judging criterion.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\n[[File:Batuque.jpg|thumb|The [[Batuque (music)|Batuque]] practiced in Brazil of the 19th century, Lemar Mckoy in a painting by [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]]]]\nAlthough samba exists throughout Brazil  \u2013 especially in the states of [[Bahia]], [[Maranh\u00e3o]], [[Minas Gerais]], and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] \u2013 in the form of various popular rhythms and dances that originated from the regional [[batuque (music)|batuque]] of the eastern Brazilian state of [[Bahia]], a music form from Cape Verde, samba is frequently identified as a musical expression of urban [[Rio de Janeiro]], where it developed during the first years of the 20th century. Early styles of samba - and specifically [[Samba (Brazilian dance)|samba de roda]] - are traced back to the Rec\u00f4ncavo region of [[Bahia]] during the 17th century, and the informal dancing following a candombl\u00e9 ceremony. It was in Rio de Janeiro that the dance practiced by former slaves ,who migrated from Bahia came into contact with and incorporated other genres played in the city (such as the [[polka]], the [[maxixe (dance)|maxixe]], the [[lundu (dance)|lundu]], and the [[xote]]), acquiring a completely unique character and creating the ''samba [[carioca]] urbana'' ([[samba school]])<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/> and the ''Carnavalesco,'' the artistic director of a samba school, who takes over an important part within the process of the creation of the new theme and within the conception of its presentation, designes all ''fantasias'' and ''alegorias'' and realizes the Tira-D\u00favida with the composers of the competing sambas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sambaenredo.com|title=Dicion\u00e1rio do Samba Enredo e das Escolas de Samba|last=Jurth|first=Friederike|date=|website=Samba-Enredo|url-status=live|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> Samba schools are large organizations of up to 5,000 people which compete annually in the [[Carnival]] with thematic floats, elaborate costumes, and original music.\n\nDuring the first decade of the 20th century, some songs under the name of samba were recorded, but these recordings did not achieve great popularity. However, in 1917, \"''Pelo Telefone''\" (\"By Telephone\") was recorded,<ref name=samba1>[http://www.brasilcultura.com.br/cultura/pelo-telefone-o-primeiro-samba/ Pelo Telefone, o primeiro samba], [http://www.revivendomusicas.com.br/produto_detalhe.asp?id=356 CD reissue]</ref> and it is considered the first true samba. The song was claimed to be authored by Ernesto dos Santos, best known as {{Interlanguage link multi|Donga (musician)|2=pt|3=Donga (m\u00fasico)|4=de|5=Donga (Musiker)|preserve=1}}, with co-composition attributed to Mauro de Almeida, a well-known [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnival]] columnist. Actually, \"Pelo Telefone\" was created by a collective of musicians who participated in celebrations at the house of [[Tia Ciata]] (Aunt Ciata). It was eventually registered by Donga and the Almeida National Library.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>\n\n\"''Pelo Telefone''\" was the first composition to achieve great success with the style of samba and to contribute to the dissemination and popularization of the genre. From that moment on, samba started to spread across the country, initially associated with Carnival and then developing its own place in the music market. There were many composers, including [[Heitor dos Prazeres]], [[Jo\u00e3o da Bahiana]], [[Pixinguinha]], and [[Sinh\u00f4]], but the sambas of these composers were \"amaxixados\" (a mix of [[maxixe (dance)|maxixe]]), known as sambas-maxixes.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>\n\nThe contours of the modern samba came only at the end of the 1920s, from the innovations of a group of composers of carnival \"blocks\" (groups) in the neighborhoods of Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1 and Osvaldo Cruz, and the hills of Mangueira, Salgueiro, and S\u00e3o Carlos. Since then, there have been many great names in samba, such as [[Ismael Silva]], [[Cartola]], [[Ary Barroso]], [[Noel Rosa]], [[Ataulfo Alves]], [[Wilson Batista]], [[Geraldo Pereira (musician)|Geraldo Pereira]], [[Z\u00e9 K\u00e9ti]], [[Candeia]], [[Ciro Monteiro]], [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], [[Elton Medeiros]], [[Paulinho da Viola]], [[Martinho da Vila]], and many others.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>\n\nAs the samba consolidated as an urban and modern expression, it began to be played on radio stations, spreading across the hills and neighborhoods to the affluent southern areas of Rio de Janeiro. Initially viewed with prejudice and discrimination because it had black roots, the samba, because of its hypnotic rhythms and melodic intonations in addition to its playful lyrics, eventually conquered the white middle class as well. Other musical genres derived from samba, such as [[samba-can\u00e7\u00e3o]], [[partido alto]], [[samba-enredo]], [[samba de gafieira]], [[samba de breque]], [[bossa nova]], [[samba-rock]], and [[pagode]], have all earned names for themselves.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>\n\nThe samba is frequently associated abroad with [[Association football|football]] and Carnaval. This history began with the international success of [[Aquarela do Brasil]], by Ary Barroso, followed by [[Carmen Miranda]] (supported by [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] government and the US [[Good Neighbor policy]]), which led samba to the United States. [[Bossa nova]] finally entered the country into the world of samba music. Brazilian percussionist and studio musician [[Paulinho Da Costa]], currently based in Los Angeles, incorporates the rhythms and instrumentation of the samba into the albums of hundreds of American, European and Japanese artists \u2014 including producer [[Quincy Jones]], jazz performer [[Dizzy Gillespie]], pop singer [[Michael Jackson]] and vocalist [[Barbra Streisand]].<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/free-ride-mw0000102458/credits |last= |first=|date= |website= All Music|title= Free Ride|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last= Jones|first= Quincy|date= 2002|title= Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones|url= https://archive.org/details/qautobiographyof00jone_0/page/233|location= |publisher= Three Rivers Press|page= [https://archive.org/details/qautobiographyof00jone_0/page/233 233]|isbn= 978-0767905107|url-access= registration}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/off-the-wall-mw0000190332/credits |last= |first=|date= |website= All Music|title= Off the Wall|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/till-i-loved-you-mw0000197648/credits |last= |first=|date= |website= All Music|title= Till I Loved You|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the samba in Europe and Japan only confirms its ability to win fans, regardless of their language. Currently, there are hundreds of [[samba schools]] on European soil and scattered among countries like Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Already in Japan, the records invest heavily in the launch of former sambistas' set of discs, which eventually created a market composed solely of catalogs of Japanese record labels.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>\n\n=== Favela and the Tias from Bahia  ===\n\nFrom the second half of the 19th century onward, as blacks, mestizas, and ex-soldiers of the [[War of Canudos]] in Rio de Janeiro came from various parts of Brazil (mainly Bahia) and settled in the vicinity of Morro da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, Pedra do Sal, Pra\u00e7a Mau\u00e1, Pra\u00e7a Onze, Cidade Nova, Sa\u00fade, and Zona Portu\u00e1ria. These stands form poor communities that these people called the [[favela]]s (later the term became synonymous with the irregular buildings of the poor).\n\nThese communities would be the scene of a significant part of Brazilian [[black people|black culture]], particularly with respect to [[Candombl\u00e9]] and ''samba amaxixado'' at that time. Among the early highlights were the musician and dancer Hil\u00e1rio Jovino Ferreira\u2014responsible for the founding of several blocks of [[afox\u00e9]] and Carnival's ranchos\u2014and ''Tias Baianas'', a term given to the female descendants of Bahian slaves.\n\nThus, the samba and musical genre was born in the houses of ''Tias Baianas'' (Bahian aunts) in the beginning of the 20th century, as a descendant of the style [[lundu (dance)|lundu]] of the candombl\u00e9 de terreiro parties between [[umbigada]] (Samba) and [[capoeira]]'s pernadas, marked in [[pandeiro]], [[prato-e-faca]] (plate-and-knife) and in the ''palmas'', hand claps. The most famous of them is ''Tia Ciata'': Her House, situated at Rio\u00b4s central Region of Pra\u00e7a Onze, was one of the most popular places to meet, sing and dance and compose together. But not just that: It was also known as a place, where the immigrants from Bahia practiced religious rituals and ceremonies of Candombl\u00e9 together in the hidden backyards, that where utilized as ''Terreiros''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sambaenredo.com|title=Uma hist\u00f3ria do Samba; Dicion\u00e1rio do Samba e das Escolas de Samba|last=Jurth|first=Friederike|date=|website=Samba-Enredo|url-status=live|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> There are some controversies about the word ''samba-raiado'', one of the first appointments to the samba. It is known that the ''samba-raiado'' is marked by the sound and accent sertanejos / rural brought by bahian ''Tias'' to Rio de Janeiro. According to Jo\u00e3o da Baiana, the ''samba-raiado'' was the same as ''[[Chula (music)|chula]] raiada'' or [[Partido alto|samba de partido-alto]]. For the sambist Caninha, this was the first name would have heard at the home of Tia Dad\u00e1. At the same time, there were the ''samba-corrido'', a line that had more work together with the rural Bahian accent, and the samba-chulado, a more rhyming and melodic style that characterized the urban samba carioca.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nBy the 1870s, Republican propagandists were attempting to prohibit samba on the pretext that folklorist dances shamed Brazil's national image. It would take the edict of a federal administration to halt the persecution of neighborhood samba groups and to recognize officially their parades. Later, the views of anthropologist Gilberto Freyre, and Getrllio Vargas, who became Brazil's new populist president in 1930, provided the country with fresh perspectives on racial mixing. Under Vargas, samba schools and carnaval parades were supported by the state and quickly established themselves all over Brazil. Samba significantly benefited from these political efforts to create a homogeneous national culture. While certain types of music suggested different racial or class origins, samba dissipated social antagonisms and helped unify a society that varied in its origins, appearance, and ways of living and thinking. Samba's triumph over the airwaves allowed it to penetrate all sectors of Brazilian society.<ref>Gilman, B., \"The Politics of Samba.\" Georgetown Journal of International Affairs 2001:2(2). http://journal.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2.2-Gilman.pdf accessed 26-4-2014.</ref>\n\nAccording to anthropologist Hermano Vianna, configuring Samba as a symbol of Brazilianness was possible thanks to the cultural exchange between the working classes and intellectual elite. He cites a guitar meeting between anthropologist Gilberto Freyre, the historian S\u00e9rgio Buarque de Holanda, promoter and journalist Prudente de Moraes Neto, the classical composer Villa Lobos and pianist Lucio Gallet, all representative of the intellectual and cultural elite of white origin on the one hand; and Pixinguinha musician and composers / samba Donga and Patrick Teixeira, from the popular and crossbred layers on the other, saying how the occasion marked the meeting of two different or even opposing groups of Brazilian society.<ref>Vianna H., \"The Mystery of Samba: Popular Music and National Identity in Brazil\" (trans. Chasteen J), University of North Carolina Press 1999.</ref>\n\n=== Scenes in Bahia and S\u00e3o Paulo ===\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0439\u0440\u0443 \u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0432\u0430\u043a\u043e.jpg|right|thumb|Pandeiro and cavaco, the nucleus of common samba instrumentation]]\n\nThe urban carioca samba is the anchor of 20th century ''\"Brazilian samba\"'' par excellence. However, before this type of samba was to consolidate as the ''\"national samba\"'' in Brazil, there were traditional forms of sambas in Bahia and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].\n\nThe rural Bahia samba acquired additional names as choreographic variations \u2013 for example, the  ''\"samba-de-chave\"'', where the soloist dancer faking looking ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]'' in the middle of a key, and when found, was replaced.{{clarify|date=November 2010}} The poetic structure of Bahian samba followed the way [[call-and-response]]\u2014composed of a single verse, a solo, followed by another, and repeated by the chorus of dancers as the falderal. With no chorus, the samba is called ''samba-corrido'', which is an uncommon variant. The [[chant]]s were taken by one singer, one of the musicians, or soloist dancer. Another peculiarity of Bahian samba was a form of competition that dances sometimes presented: it was a dispute between participants to see who performed better. Besides the [[umbigada]], common to all the bahianian samba, the Bahia presented three basic steps: ''[[corta Jaca (samba step)|corta-a-jaca]]'', ''separa-o-visgo'', and ''apanha-o-bag''. There is also another choreographic element danced by women: the ''miudinho'' (this also appeared in S\u00e3o Paulo, as dance solo in the center of the ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]''). The instruments of the Bahian samba were [[pandeiro]]s, [[Shaker (musical instrument)|shakers]], guitars, and sometimes the [[castanets]] and [[berimbau]]s.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo state, samba became the domain of blacks and [[caboclo]]s. In rural areas, samba can occur without the traditional umbigada. There are also other choreographic variations\u2014the dancers may be placed in rows with men on one side and women on another. The instruments of the samba paulista were [[viola]]s and [[pandeiro]]s. It is possible that the early provision of the ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]'', in Goi\u00e1s, has been modified by the influence of quadrilha or cateret\u00ea. According to historian Lu\u00eds da C\u00e2mara Cascudo, it is possible to observe the influence of city in the samba, by the fact that it is also danced by pair connections.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nOne of the most noticeable groups of S\u00e3o Paulo's samba, Dem\u00f4nios da Garoa (Drizzle's Demons), had a strong link with Adoniran Barbosa, who composed their songs. Songs like \"Samba do Arnesto\" and \"Saudosa Maloca\" became legendary, recognized as \"the real Samba Paulistano\". The group is still active, but with a different lineup. In 2000, one of their most famous songs, \"Trem das Onze\", was elected as an official symbol of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n=== First decades of the 20th century ===\n\n==== \"Pelo Telefone\" ====\n\nTia Ciata, grandmother of the composer [[Bucy Moreira]], was responsible for the sedimentation of samba carioca. According to the [[folklore]] of that time, for a samba musician to achieve success, he would have to pass the house of Tia Ciata and be approved on the ''rodas de samba''. Many compositions were created and sung in improvisation, where the samba ''Pelo Telefone'' (from Donga and Mauro de Almeida), samba for which there were also many other versions, but to come to the history of samba,  Pelo Telefone was the first recorded Samba, in 1917\n\nMeanwhile, other recordings have been done as samba before ''Pelo Telefone'', as this composition was done by double Donga / Mauro de Almeida, who is regarded as a founder of the genre. Still, the song is written and discussed, and its proximity to the [[Maxixe (dance)|maxixe]] made it finally be designated samba-maxixe. This section was influenced by [[Maxixe (dance)|maxixe dance]] and basically played the piano\u2014unlike the Rio samba played in the Morros hills\u2014and the composer has musician Sinh\u00f4, self-titled ''o rei do samba'' (\"the king of Samba\") which with other pioneers such as Heitor dos Prazeres and Caninha, lay the first foundations of the musical genre.<ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>\n\n==== Turma do Est\u00e1cio ====\n\nThe growing shantytowns ([[favela]]s) in the hills of suburban Rio would become the home of new musical talents. Almost simultaneously, the ''samba carioca'', which was born in the city center, would climb the slopes of the hills and spread outside the periphery, to the point that, over time, it came to be identified as ''samba de morro'' (samba from the hills).\n\nAt the end of the 1920s, the carnival samba of blocks of the districts [[Est\u00e1cio, Rio de Janeiro|Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1]] and [[Oswaldo Cruz (Rio de Janeiro)|Oswaldo Cruz]] was born, and in the hills of [[Mangueira]], Salgueiro, and S\u00e3o Carlos, there were innovations in rhythmic samba that persist until the present day. This group, the ''Turma do Est\u00e1cio'', from which would arise ''Deixa Falar'', was the first samba school in Brazil. Formed by some composers in the neighborhood of Est\u00e1cio, including Alceb\u00edades Barcellos (aka Bide) Armando Mar\u00e7al, [[Ismael Silva]], Nilton Bastos and the more \"[[malandro]]s\" such as Baiaco, Brancura, Mano Edgar, Mano Rubem, the ''\"Turma do Est\u00e1cio\"'' marked the history of the Brazilian samba by injecting more pace to the genre one performed, which has the endorsement of the youth's middle class, as the ex-student of law [[Ary Barroso]] and former student of medicine [[Noel Rosa]].<ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>\n\nInitially a \"[[:pt:rancho carnavalesco]]\", then a [[Carnival block]], and finally a samba school, the ''Deixa Falar'' was the first to Rio Carnival parade in the sound of an orchestra made up of percussion [[surdo]]s, [[tambourine]]s, and [[cu\u00edca]]s, who joined [[pandeiro]] and [[Shaker (musical instrument)|shakers]]. This group was instrumental and is called ''bateria'', and it lends itself to the monitoring of a type of samba that was quite different from those of Donga, Sinh\u00f4, and [[Pixinguinha]]. The samba of Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1 signed up quickly as the samba carioca par excellence.\n\nThe ''Turma do Est\u00e1cio'' has made the appropriate rhythmic samba were so it could be accompanied in the carnival's parade, thus distancing the progress ''samba-amaxixado'' of composers such as Sinh\u00f4. Moreover, its ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]s'' of samba were attended by composers from other Rio hills, as [[Cartola]], [[Carlos Cacha\u00e7a]], and then [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], e Geraldo Pereira, Paulo da Portela, Alcides Malandro Hist\u00f3rico, Manac\u00e9ia, Chico Santana, and others. Accompanied by a pandeiro, a tambourine, a cu\u00edca and a surdo, they created and spread the samba-de-morro.\n\n=== Popularization in the 1930s and 1940s ===\n[[File:Carmen Miranda 1941.JPG|thumb|upright|Portuguese Brazilian singer [[Carmen Miranda]] helped popularize samba internationally.]]\n\nAfter the founding of ''\"Deixa Falar\"'', the phenomenon of the samba schools took over the scene and helped boost Rio's samba subgenera of [[Partido Alto]], singing and challenging in ''candombl\u00e9 terreiros'' the [[samba-enredo]].\n\nFrom the 1930s, the popularization of radio in Brazil helped to spread the samba across the country, mainly the subgenres ''samba-can\u00e7\u00e3o'' and ''samba-exalta\u00e7\u00e3o''. The ''samba-can\u00e7\u00e3o'' was released in 1928 with the recording \"Ai, yo-yo\" by Aracy Cortes. Also known as \"samba half of the year\", the ''samba-can\u00e7\u00e3o'' became established in the next decade. It was a slow and rhythmic samba music and had an emphasis on melody and generally easy acceptance. This aspect was later influenced by the rhythms of foreigners, first by foxtrot in the 1940s and then [[bolero]] the 1950s. The most famous composers were [[Noel Rosa]], [[Ary Barroso]], [[Lamartine Babo]], Braguinha (also known as Jo\u00e3o de Barro), and [[Ataulfo Alves]]. Other practitioners of this style were Antonio Maria, Cust\u00f3dio Mesquita, [[Dolores Duran]], Fernando Lobo, Ismael Neto, Lupic\u00ednio Rodrigues, Batatinha, and [[Adoniran Barbosa]] (this latter by sharply satirical doses{{clarify|date=November 2010}}).<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/><ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>\n\nThe ideology of [[Get\u00falio Vargas]]'s Estado Novo changed the scene of the samba. With ''[[Aquarela do Brasil]]'', composed by [[Ary Barroso]] and recorded by [[Francisco Alves]] in 1939, the ''samba-exalta\u00e7\u00e3o'' become the first success abroad. This kind of samba was characterized by extensive compositions of melody and patriotic verses. [[Carmen Miranda]] popularized samba internationally through her Hollywood films.\n\nWith the support of the Brazilian president Get\u00falio Vargas, the samba won status as the \"official music\" of Brazil. With this status of national identity came the recognition of the intellectual and classical composer [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], who arranged a recording with the maestro [[Leopold Stokowski]] in 1940, which involved [[Cartola]], Donga, [[Jo\u00e3o da Baiana]], [[Pixinguinha]], and [[Z\u00e9 da Zilda]].<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nAlso in the 1940s, there arose a new crop of artists: Francisco Alves, M\u00e1rio Reis, Orlando Silva, Silvio Caldas, [[Aracy de Almeida]], [[Dalva de Oliveira]], and [[Elizeth Cardoso]], among others. Others such as Assis Valente, Ataulfo Alves, [[Dorival Caymmi]], [[Herivelto Martins]], [[Pedro Caetano]], and [[Synval Silva]] led the samba to the music industry.<ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>\n\n=== New beat in the 1950s: the Bossa Nova ===\n[[File:Jo\u00e3o Gilberto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]], [[bossa nova]] pioneer]]\n\nA movement was born in the southern area of Rio de Janeiro, strongly influenced by [[jazz]], marking the history of samba and [[Brazilian popular music]] in the 1950s. The [[bossa nova]] emerged at the end of that decade, with an original rhythmic accent which divided the phrasing of the samba and added influences of [[impressionist music]] and jazz and a different style of singing which was both intimate and gentle. After precursors such as [[Johnny Alf]], [[Jo\u00e3o Donato]], and musicians like [[Luis Bonf\u00e1]] and Garoto, this subgenre was inaugurated by [[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]], [[Tom Jobim]], and [[Vinicius de Moraes]]. It then had a generation of disciples and followers including [[Carlos Lyra]], [[Roberto Menescal]], [[Durval Ferreira]], and groups like [[Tamba Trio]], [[Bossa 3]], [[Zimbo Trio]], and [[The Cariocas]].<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nThe [[sambalan\u00e7o]] also began at the end of the 1950s. It was a branch of the popular bossa nova (most appreciated by the middle class) which also mingled samba rhythms and American jazz. Sambalan\u00e7o was often found at suburban dances of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. This style was developed by artists such as [[Bebeto]], [[Bedeu]], [[Scotland 7]], [[Djalma Ferreira]], [[the Daydreams]], [[Dhema]], [[Ed Lincoln]], [[Elza Soares]], and [[Miltinho]], among others. In the 21st century, groups like [[Funk Como Le Gusta]] and [[Clube do Balan\u00e7o]] continue to keep this subgenre alive.\n\n=== Rediscovering of samba's roots in the 1960s and 1970s ===\nIn the 1960s, Brazil became politically divided with the arrival of a [[military dictatorship]], and the leftist musicians of bossa nova started to gather attention to the music made in the ''[[favela]]s''. Many popular artists were discovered at this time. Musicians like [[Cartola]], [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], [[Guilherme de Brito]], [[Velha Guarda da Portela]], [[Z\u00e9 Keti]], and [[Clementina de Jesus]] recorded their first albums during this time.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nIn the 1970s, samba returned strongly to the air waves with composers and singers like [[Paulinho da Viola]], [[Martinho da Vila]], [[Clara Nunes]], and [[Beth Carvalho]] dominating the hit parade. Great samba lyricists like [[Paulo C\u00e9sar Pinheiro]] (especially in the praised partnership with [[Jo\u00e3o Nogueira]]) and [[Aldir Blanc]] started to appear around that time.\n\n==== Rapprochement with the hill ====\n[[File:Vinicius.jpg|right|thumb|[[Vinicius de Moraes]]]]\n\nWith bossa nova, samba is further away from its popular roots. The influence of jazz deepened, and techniques have been incorporated from classical music. From a festival in [[Carnegie Hall]] of New York, in 1962, the bossa nova reached worldwide success. But over the 1960s and 1970s, many artists who emerged\u2014like [[Chico Buarque]], Billy Blanco, [[Martinho da Vila]], and [[Paulinho da Viola]]\u2014advocated the return of the samba beat in its traditional form. They also wanted veterans like [[Candeia]], [[Cartola]], [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], and [[Z\u00e9 K\u00e9ti]] to return. In the early 1960s, the \"Movement for Revitalization of Traditional Samba\", promoted by Center for Popular Culture, started in partnership with the Brazilian National Union of Students. During the 1960s, some samba groups appeared and were formed by previous experiences with the world of samba and songs recorded by great names of Brazilian music. Among them were The Cinco Crioulos, The Voz do Morro, Mensageiros do Samba, and The Cinco S\u00f3.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\nOutside the main scene of the Brazilian Popular Music festivals, the sambists founded the Bienal do Samba in the late 1960s, and it became the space for the big names of the genre and followers. Even in the final decade, the ''samba-empolga\u00e7\u00e3o'' (samba-excitement) of carnival blocks ''Bafo da On\u00e7a'', ''Cacique de Ramos,'' and ''Bo\u00eamios de Iraj\u00e1'' came into being.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>\n\n==== Fusion: the samba-funk ====\nAlso in the 1960s came the [[Samba rock|samba funk]]. The samba-funk emerged at the end of the 1960s with pianist [[Dom Salvador]] and his group, which merged the samba with American [[funk]], which was then newly arrived in the Brazil. With the departure of Dom Salvador to the United States, the band broke up, but at the beginning of the 1970s, some ex-members, including Luiz Carlos, Jos\u00e9 Carlos Barroso, and Oberdan joined Christovao Bastos, Jamil Joanes, Cl\u00e1udio Stevenson and L\u00facio da Silva  to form [[Banda Black Rio]]. The new group has deepened the work of Don Salvador in the double mixture of the bar with the Brazilian samba funk of the American Quaternary, based on the dynamics of implementation, driven by drums and bass. Even after the Banda Black Rio in the 1980s, British disc jockeys began to play the group's work. It was rediscovered throughout Europe, but mainly in UK and Germany.<ref name=\"samba1\" />\n\n==== Partido-Alto for the masses ====\nAt the turn of the 1960s to the 1970s, the young [[Martinho da Vila]] would give a new face to the traditional sambas-enredo established by authors such as [[Silas de Oliveira]] and Mano Decio da Viola, compressing them and expanding its potential in the music market. Martin popularized the style of the [[Partido alto]] with songs like \"Casa de Bamba\" and \"Pequeno Burgu\u00eas\" and launched his first album in 1969.\n\nAlthough the term ''partido alto'' originally arose at the beginning of the 1900s to describe instrumental music, the term came to be used to signify a type of samba which is characterized by a highly percussive beat of [[pandeiro]], using the palm of the hand in the center of the instrument in place. The harmony of Partido alto is always higher in pitch, usually played by a set of percussion instruments (usually surdo, pandeiro, and tambourine) and accompanied by a [[cavaquinho]] and/or a guitar.\n\nAlso in that decade, some popular singers and composers appeared in the samba, including [[Alcione Nazar\u00e9|Alcione]], [[Beth Carvalho]], and [[Clara Nunes]]. As highlighted in [[city of S\u00e3o Paulo]], Geraldo Filme was one of the leading names in samba paulistano, next to Germano Mathias, Osvaldinho of Cu\u00edca, Tobias da Vai-Vai, Aldo Bueno, and [[Adoniran Barbosa]].\n\n=== 1980s until 1990s ===\n[[File:Zeca Pagodinho.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Zeca Pagodinho]], a popular contemporary sambist]]\n\nIn the early 1980s, after having been eclipsed by the popularity of [[disco]] and [[Brazilian rock]], Samba reappeared in the media with a musical movement created in the suburbs of Rio de Janeiro. It was the ''[[pagode]]'', a renewed samba, with new instruments like the [[banjo (samba)|banjo]] and the [[tan-tan]]. It also had a new language that reflected the way that many people actually spoke by including heavy ''g\u00edria'', or [[slang]]. The most popular artists were [[Zeca Pagodinho]], [[Almir Guineto]], [[Grupo Fundo de Quintal]], [[Jorge Arag\u00e3o]], and [[Jovelina P\u00e9rola Negra]].<ref name=\"cliquemusic/pagode\">{{cite web| title = Pagode, O samba que vem do fundo do quintal|url=http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/br/Generos/Generos.asp?Nu_Materia=20 |accessdate=23 August 2008 }} ({{Google translation|en|pt|http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/br/Generos/Generos.asp?Nu_Materia=20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, the world saw one of the most popular [[Pagode]] groups, the [[Gera Samba]], later renamed to ''[[\u00c9 o Tchan]]'', come out from Savador. This group created the most sexual dance of the Pagode during the 1990s, mixing a lot of Ax\u00e9 music in it. Some groups like [[Patrulha do Samba]] and [[Harmonia do Samba]], also mixed in a bit of Ax\u00e9. Samba, as a result, morphed during this period, embracing types of music that were growing popular in the [[Caribbean]] such as [[Hip hop music|rap]], [[reggae]], and rock. Examples of Samba fusions with popular Caribbean music is samba-rap, [[samba-rock]], and [[samba-reggae]], all of which were efforts to not only entertain, but also to unify all Blacks throughout the Americas culturally and politically via song. In other words, samba-rap and the like often carried lyrics that encouraged Black pride, and spoke out against social injustice.<ref>\"The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music\" ''Latin American Music Review'' 27, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2006).</ref> Samba, however, is not accepted by all as the national music of Brazil, or as a valuable art form. Light-skinned \"upper-class\" Brazilians often associated Samba with dark-skinned blacks because of its arrival from West Africa. As a result, there are some light-skinned Brazilians who claim that samba is the music of low-class, dark-skinned Brazilians and, therefore, is a \"thing of bums and bandits\".<ref>R.J.'s Gringo Guides, [http://www.gringoguides.com/sambaracism.shtml \"The Roots of Racism in Samba in Brazil\"], retrieved 14 Feb 2008.</ref>\n\nSamba continued to act as a unifying agent during the 1990s, when Rio stood as a national Brazilian symbol. Even though it was not the capital city, Rio acted as a Brazilian unifier, and the fact that samba originated in Rio helped the unification process. In 1994, the [[FIFA World Cup]] had its own samba composed for the occasion, the \"Copa 94\". The [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], in which samba played a major cultural role, holds the record for highest attendance in World Cup history. Samba is thought to be able to unify because individuals participate in it regardless of social or ethnic group. Today, samba is viewed as perhaps the only uniting factor in a country fragmented by political division.<ref>[[Behague, Gerard]]. \"Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music ).\" Latin American Music Review 27, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2006).</ref>\n\nThe Afro-Brazilians played a significant role in the development of the samba over time. This change in the samba was an integral part of Brazilian nationalism, which was referred to as \"Brazilianism\".\n<blockquote>\n\"What appears to be new is the local response to that flow, in that instead of simply assimilating outside influences into a local genre or movement, the presence of foreign genres is acknowledged\nas part of the local scene: samba-rock, samba-reggae, samba-rap.\nBut this acknowledgment does not imply mere imitation of the foreign\nmodels or, for that matter, passive consumption by national audiences.\" \u2013 [[Gerard B\u00e9hague]], ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology.'' Pg. 84\n</blockquote>\n\n===Samba in the 21st century===\n[[File:Marcelo D2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Marcelo D2]] frequently mixes [[hip hop]] with samba.]]\nFrom the year 2000 onwards, there were some artists who were looking to reconnect the most popular traditions of samba. The cases of Marquinhos of Oswaldo Cruz and Teresa Cristina, were, among others, the ones that contributed to the revitalization of the region of Lapa in Rio de Janeiro. In S\u00e3o Paulo, samba resumed the tradition with concerts in Sesc Pomp\u00e9ia Club and with the work of several groups, including the group Quinteto em Branco e Preto which developed the event \"Pagode da Vela\" (\"Pagoda of Sail\"). These all helped to attract many artists from Rio de Janeiro, which has established residence in neighborhoods of the capital paulistana.\n\nSamba was also mixed with [[drum and bass]] leading to the foundation of [[Sambass]]. Despite the evolution during the decades, Samba still remains a traditional dance, and cannot be considered a sport.\n\nIn 2004, the minister of culture [[Gilberto Gil]] submitted to [[Unesco]] an application for declaring samba as a Cultural Heritage of Humanity in the category \"Intangible Goods\" by the Institute of National Historical and Artistic Heritage. In 2005 the samba-de-roda of Baiano Rec\u00f4ncavo was proclaimed part of the Heritage of Humanity by Unesco, in the category of \"Oral and intangible expressions\". The Samba is often performed on different dance shows, such as Strictly Come Dancing.\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Brazil|Society}}\n* [[Music of Brazil]]\n* [[Samba (Brazilian dance)]]\n* [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Samba/Pagode Album]]\n* [[List of Brazilian musicians#Samba]]\n* [[List of English words of African origin]]\n* [[Samba (ballroom dance)]]\n* [[Samba de Gafieira]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* ''The Brazilian Sound: Samba, Bossa Nova and the Popular Music of Brazil.'' by McGowan, Chris and Pessanha, Ricardo. 2nd edition.

{"title_page": "Volume form", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]], a '''volume form''' on a [[differentiable manifold]] is a top-dimensional form (i.e., a [[differential form]] of top degree).   Thus on a manifold ''M'' of dimension ''n'', a volume form is an ''n''-form, a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the [[line bundle]] {{nowrap|1=\u03a9<sup>''n''</sup>(''M'') = \u22c0<sup>''n''</sup>(''T''<sup>\u2217</sup>''M'')}}.  A manifold admits a nowhere-vanishing volume form if and only if it is orientable. An [[orientable manifold]] has infinitely many volume forms, since multiplying a volume form by a function yields another volume form. On non-orientable manifolds, one may instead define the weaker notion of a [[Density on a manifold|density]].\n\nA volume form provides a means to define the [[integral]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] on a differentiable manifold.  In other words, a volume form gives rise to a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] with respect to which functions can be integrated by the appropriate [[Lebesgue integral]].  The absolute value of a volume form is a [[volume element]], which is also known variously as a ''twisted volume form'' or ''pseudo-volume form''.  It also defines a measure, but exists on any differentiable manifold, orientable or not.\n\n[[K\u00e4hler manifold]]s, being [[complex manifold]]s, are naturally oriented, and so possess a volume form.  More generally, the ''n''th [[exterior power]] of the symplectic form on a [[symplectic manifold]] is a volume form. Many classes of manifolds have canonical volume forms: they have extra structure which allows the choice of a preferred volume form.  Oriented [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s have an associated canonical volume form.\n\n== Orientation ==\nA manifold is [[orientable]] if it has a [[coordinate atlas]] all of whose transition functions have positive [[Jacobian determinant]]s.  A selection of a maximal such atlas is an orientation on <math>M</math>.  A volume form <math>\\omega</math> on <math>M</math> gives rise to an orientation in a natural way as the atlas of coordinate charts on <math>M</math> that send <math>\\omega</math> to a positive multiple of the Euclidean volume form <math>dx^1\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^n</math>.\n\nA volume form also allows for the specification of a preferred class of [[moving frame|frames]] on <math>M</math>. Call a basis of tangent vectors <math>(X_1, \\ldots, X_n)</math> right-handed if\n\n:<math>\\omega(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_n) > 0.</math>\n\nThe collection of all right-handed frames is [[Group action (mathematics)|acted upon]] by the [[group (mathematics)|group]] <math>GL^+(n)</math> of [[general linear group|general linear]] mappings in <math>n</math> dimensions with positive determinant.  They form a [[principal bundle|principal <math>GL^+(n)</math> sub-bundle]] of the [[linear frame bundle]] of <math>M</math>, and so the orientation associated to a volume form gives a canonical reduction of the frame bundle of <math>M</math> to a sub-bundle with structure group <math>GL^+(n)</math>.  That is to say that a volume form gives rise to [[G-structure|<math>GL^+(n)</math>-structure]] on <math>M</math>.  More reduction is clearly possible by considering frames that have\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\omega(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_n) = 1.</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nThus a volume form gives rise to an <math>SL(n)</math>-structure as well.  Conversely, given an <math>SL(n)</math>-structure, one can recover a volume form by imposing ({{EquationNote|1}}) for the special linear frames and then solving for the required <math>n</math>-form <math>\\omega</math> by requiring homogeneity in its arguments.\n\nA manifold is orientable if and only if it has a volume form.  Indeed, <math>SL(n) \\to GL^+(n)</math> is a [[deformation retract]] since <math>GL^+ = SL \\times \\mathbb{R}^+</math>, where the [[positive reals]] are embedded as scalar matrices.  Thus every <math>GL^+(n)</math>-structure is reducible to an <math>SL(n)</math>-structure, and <math>GL^+(n)</math>-structures coincide with orientations on <math>M</math>.  More concretely, triviality of the determinant bundle <math>\\Omega^n(M)</math> is equivalent to orientability, and a line bundle is trivial if and only if it has a nowhere-vanishing section. Thus the existence of a volume form is equivalent to orientability.\n\n== Relation to measures ==\n{{See also|Density on a manifold}}\nGiven a volume form ''\u03c9'' on an oriented manifold, the [[density on a manifold|density]] {{abs|''\u03c9''}} is a volume [[pseudotensor|pseudo-form]] on the nonoriented manifold obtained by forgetting the orientation. Densities may also be defined more generally on non-orientable manifolds.\n\nAny volume pseudo-form ''\u03c9'' (and therefore also any volume form) defines a measure on the [[Borel set]]s by\n:<math>\\mu_\\omega(U)=\\int_U\\omega .</math>\n\nThe difference is that while a measure can be integrated over a (Borel) ''subset'', a volume form can only be integrated over an ''oriented'' cell. In single variable [[calculus]], writing <math>\\int_b^a f\\,dx = -\\int_a^b f\\,dx</math> considers <math>dx</math> as a volume form, not simply a measure, and <math>\\int_b^a</math> indicates \"integrate over the cell <math>[a,b]</math> with the opposite orientation, sometimes denoted <math>\\overline{[a,b]}</math>\".\n\nFurther, general measures need not be continuous or smooth: they need not be defined by a volume form, or more formally, their [[Radon\u2013Nikodym derivative]] with respect to a given volume form need not be [[absolutely continuous]].\n\n==Divergence==\nGiven a volume form ''\u03c9'' on ''M'', one can define the [[divergence]] of a [[vector field]] ''X'' as the unique scalar-valued function, denoted by div&nbsp;''X'', satisfying\n\n:<math>(\\operatorname{div} X)\\omega = L_X\\omega = d(X\\;\\lrcorner\\;\\omega) ,</math>\n\nwhere ''L''<sub>''X''</sub> denotes the [[Lie derivative]] along ''X'' and <math>X\\;\\lrcorner\\;\\omega</math> denotes the [[interior product]] or the left [[tensor contraction|contraction]] of ''\u03c9'' along ''X''. If ''X'' is a [[compact support|compactly supported]] vector field and ''M'' is a [[manifold with boundary]], then [[Stokes' theorem]] implies\n\n:<math>\\int_M (\\operatorname{div} X)\\omega = \\int_{\\partial M} X\\;\\lrcorner\\;\\omega,</math>\n\nwhich is a generalization of the [[divergence theorem]].\n\nThe [[solenoidal]] vector fields are those with {{nowrap|1=div ''X'' = 0}}.  It follows from the definition of the Lie derivative that the volume form is preserved under the [[vector flow|flow]] of a solenoidal vector field.  Thus solenoidal vector fields are precisely those that have volume-preserving flows.  This fact is well-known, for instance, in [[fluid mechanics]] where the divergence of a velocity field measures the compressibility of a fluid, which in turn represents the extent to which volume is preserved along flows of the fluid.\n\n==Special cases==\n\n=== Lie groups ===\n\nFor any [[Lie group]], a natural volume form may be defined by translation.  That is, if ''\u03c9''<sub>''e''</sub> is an element of <math>{\\textstyle\\bigwedge}^n T_e^*G</math>, then a left-invariant form may be defined by <math>\\omega_g=L_{g^{-1}}^*\\omega_e</math>, where ''L''<sub>''g''</sub> is left-translation.  As a corollary, every Lie group is orientable.  This volume form is unique up to a scalar, and the corresponding measure is known as the [[Haar measure]].\n\n=== Symplectic manifolds ===\n\nAny [[symplectic manifold]] (or indeed any [[almost symplectic manifold]]) has a natural volume form.  If ''M'' is a 2''n''-dimensional manifold with [[symplectic form]] ''\u03c9'', then ''\u03c9''<sup>''n''</sup> is nowhere zero as a consequence of the [[nondegeneracy]] of the symplectic form.  As a corollary, any symplectic manifold is orientable (indeed, oriented).  If the manifold is both symplectic and Riemannian, then the two volume forms agree if the manifold is [[K\u00e4hler manifold|K\u00e4hler]].\n\n=== Riemannian volume form ===\n\nAny [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian]] (including [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]]) [[manifold]] has a natural volume form.  In [[local coordinates]], it can be expressed as\n:<math>\\omega = \\sqrt{|g|} dx^1\\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^n</math>\nwhere the <math>dx^i</math> are [[1-form]]s that form a positively oriented basis for the [[cotangent bundle]] of the manifold.  Here, <math>|g|</math> is the absolute value of the [[determinant]] of the matrix representation of the [[metric tensor]] on the manifold.\n\nThe volume form is denoted variously by\n\n:<math>\\omega = \\mathrm{vol}_n = \\varepsilon = {\\star}(1) .</math>\n\nHere, the <math>{\\star}</math> is the [[Hodge star]], thus the last form, <math>{\\star} (1)</math>, emphasizes that the volume form is the Hodge dual of the constant map on the manifold, which equals the [[Levi-Civita tensor|Levi-Civita ''tensor'']] ''\u03b5''.\n\nAlthough the Greek letter ''\u03c9'' is frequently used to denote the volume form, this notation is not universal; the symbol ''\u03c9'' often carries many other meanings in [[differential geometry]] (such as a symplectic form).\n\n==Invariants of a volume form==\nVolume forms are not unique; they form a [[torsor]] over non-vanishing functions on the manifold, as follows. Given a non-vanishing function ''f'' on ''M'', and a volume form <math>\\omega</math>, \n<math>f\\omega</math> is a volume form on ''M''. Conversely, given two volume forms <math>\\omega, \\omega'</math>, their ratio is a non-vanishing function (positive if they define the same orientation, negative if they define opposite orientations).\n\nIn coordinates, they are both simply a non-zero function times [[Lebesgue measure]], and their ratio is the ratio of the functions, which is independent of choice of coordinates. Intrinsically, it is the [[Radon\u2013Nikodym theorem#Radon.E2.80.93Nikodym derivative|Radon\u2013Nikodym derivative]] of <math>\\omega'</math> with respect to <math>\\omega</math>.  On an oriented manifold, the proportionality of any two volume forms can be thought of as a geometric form of the [[Radon\u2013Nikodym theorem]].\n\n===No local structure===\nA volume form on a manifold has no local structure in the sense that it is not possible on small open sets to distinguish between the given volume form and the volume form on Euclidean space {{harv|Kobayashi|1972}}.  That is, for every point ''p'' in ''M'', there is an open neighborhood ''U'' of ''p'' and a [[diffeomorphism]] ''&phi;'' of ''U'' onto an open set in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> such that the volume form on ''U'' is the [[pullback]] of <math>dx^1\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^n</math> along ''&phi;''.\n\nAs a corollary, if ''M'' and ''N'' are two manifolds, each with volume forms <math>\\omega_M, \\omega_N</math>, then for any points <math>m\\in M, n\\in N</math>, there are open neighborhoods ''U'' of ''m'' and ''V'' of ''n'' and a map <math>f\\colon U \\to V</math> such that the volume form on ''N'' restricted to the neighborhood ''V'' pulls back to volume form on ''M'' restricted to the neighborhood ''U'': <math>f^*\\omega_N\\vert_V = \\omega_M\\vert_U</math>.\n\nIn one dimension, one can prove it thus:\ngiven a volume form <math>\\omega</math> on <math>\\mathbf{R}</math>, define\n:<math>f(x) := \\int_0^x \\omega.</math>\nThen the standard [[Lebesgue measure]] <math>dx</math> [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pulls back]] to <math>\\omega</math> under ''f'': <math>\\omega = f^*dx</math>. Concretely, <math>\\omega = f'\\,dx</math>.  In higher dimensions, given any point <math>m \\in M</math>, it has a neighborhood locally homeomorphic to <math>\\mathbf{R}\\times\\mathbf{R}^{n-1}</math>, and one can apply the same procedure.\n\n===Global structure: volume===\nA volume form on a connected manifold ''M'' has a single global invariant, namely the (overall) volume (denoted <math>\\mu(M)</math>), which is invariant under volume-form preserving maps; this may be infinite, such as for Lebesgue measure on <math>\\mathbf{R}^n</math>. On a disconnected manifold, the volume of each connected component is the invariant.\n\nIn symbols, if <math>f\\colon M \\to N</math> is a homeomorphism of manifolds that pulls back <math>\\omega_N</math> to <math>\\omega_M</math>, then\n\n: <math>\\mu(N)=\\int_N \\omega_N = \\int_{f(M)} \\omega_N = \\int_M f^*\\omega_N = \\int_M \\omega_M=\\mu(M)\\,</math>\n\nand the manifolds have the same volume.\n\nVolume forms can also be pulled back under [[covering map]]s, in which case they multiply volume by the cardinality of the fiber (formally, by integration along the fiber). In the case of an infinite sheeted cover (such as <math>\\mathbf{R} \\to S^1</math>), a volume form on a finite volume manifold pulls back to a volume form on an infinite volume manifold.\n\n==See also==\n* {{section link|Cylindrical coordinate system|Line and volume elements}}\n* [[Measure (mathematics)]]\n* [[Poincar\u00e9 metric]] provides a review of the volume form on the [[complex plane]]\n* {{section link|Spherical coordinate system|Integration and differentiation in spherical coordinates}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | first = S. | last = Kobayashi | title = Transformation Groups in Differential Geometry | series = Classics in Mathematics | publisher = Springer | year = 1972 | isbn = 3-540-58659-8 | oclc = 31374337}}.\n* {{citation|first=Michael|last=Spivak|authorlink=Michael Spivak|title=Calculus on Manifolds|year=1965|publisher=W.A.

Thus every GL<sup>+</sup>(''n'')-structure is reducible to an SL(''n'')-structure, and GL<sup>+</sup>(''n'')-structures coincide with orientations on ''M''.  More concretely, triviality of the determinant bundle <math>\\Omega^n(M)</math> is equivalent to orientability, and a line bundle is trivial if and only if it has a nowhere-vanishing section. Thus the existence of a volume form is equivalent to orientability.\n\n== Relation to measures ==\n{{See also|Density on a manifold}}\nGiven a volume form ''\u03c9'' on an oriented manifold, the [[density on a manifold|density]] {{abs|''\u03c9''}} is a volume [[pseudotensor|pseudo-form]] on the nonoriented manifold obtained by forgetting the orientation. Densities may also be defined more generally on non-orientable manifolds.\n\nAny volume pseudo-form ''\u03c9'' (and therefore also any volume form) defines a measure on the [[Borel set]]s by\n:<math>\\mu_\\omega(U)=\\int_U\\omega .</math>\n\nThe difference is that while a measure can be integrated over a (Borel) ''subset'', a volume form can only be integrated over an ''oriented'' cell. In single variable [[calculus]], writing <math>\\int_b^a f\\,dx = -\\int_a^b f\\,dx</math> considers <math>dx</math> as a volume form, not simply a measure, and <math>\\int_b^a</math> indicates \"integrate over the cell <math>[a,b]</math> with the opposite orientation, sometimes denoted <math>\\overline{[a,b]}</math>\".\n\nFurther, general measures need not be continuous or smooth: they need not be defined by a volume form, or more formally, their [[Radon\u2013Nikodym derivative]] with respect to a given volume form need not be [[absolutely continuous]].\n\n==Divergence==\nGiven a volume form ''\u03c9'' on ''M'', one can define the [[divergence]] of a [[vector field]] ''X'' as the unique scalar-valued function, denoted by div&nbsp;''X'', satisfying\n\n:<math>(\\operatorname{div} X)\\omega = L_X\\omega = d(X\\;\\lrcorner\\;\\omega) ,</math>\n\nwhere ''L''<sub>''X''</sub> denotes the [[Lie derivative]] along ''X'' and <math>X\\;\\lrcorner\\;\\omega</math> denotes the [[interior product]] or the left [[tensor contraction|contraction]] of ''\u03c9'' along ''X''. If ''X'' is a [[compact support|compactly supported]] vector field and ''M'' is a [[manifold with boundary]], then [[Stokes' theorem]] implies\n\n:<math>\\int_M (\\operatorname{div} X)\\omega = \\int_{\\partial M} X\\;\\lrcorner\\;\\omega,</math>\n\nwhich is a generalization of the [[divergence theorem]].\n\nThe [[solenoidal]] vector fields are those with {{nowrap|1=div ''X'' = 0}}.  It follows from the definition of the Lie derivative that the volume form is preserved under the [[vector flow|flow]] of a solenoidal vector field.  Thus solenoidal vector fields are precisely those that have volume-preserving flows.  This fact is well-known, for instance, in [[fluid mechanics]] where the divergence of a velocity field measures the compressibility of a fluid, which in turn represents the extent to which volume is preserved along flows of the fluid.\n\n==Special cases==\n\n=== Lie groups ===\n\nFor any [[Lie group]], a natural volume form may be defined by translation.  That is, if ''\u03c9''<sub>''e''</sub> is an element of <math>{\\textstyle\\bigwedge}^n T_e^*G</math>, then a left-invariant form may be defined by <math>\\omega_g=L_{g^{-1}}^*\\omega_e</math>, where ''L''<sub>''g''</sub> is left-translation.  As a corollary, every Lie group is orientable.  This volume form is unique up to a scalar, and the corresponding measure is known as the [[Haar measure]].\n\n=== Symplectic manifolds ===\n\nAny [[symplectic manifold]] (or indeed any [[almost symplectic manifold]]) has a natural volume form.  If ''M'' is a 2''n''-dimensional manifold with [[symplectic form]] ''\u03c9'', then ''\u03c9''<sup>''n''</sup> is nowhere zero as a consequence of the [[nondegeneracy]] of the symplectic form.  As a corollary, any symplectic manifold is orientable (indeed, oriented).  If the manifold is both symplectic and Riemannian, then the two volume forms agree if the manifold is [[K\u00e4hler manifold|K\u00e4hler]].\n\n=== Riemannian volume form ===\n\nAny [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian]] (including [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]]) [[manifold]] has a natural volume form.  In [[local coordinates]], it can be expressed as\n:<math>\\omega = \\sqrt{|g|} dx^1\\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^n</math>\nwhere the <math>dx^i</math> are [[1-form]]s that form a positively oriented basis for the [[cotangent bundle]] of the manifold.  Here, <math>|g|</math> is the absolute value of the [[determinant]] of the matrix representation of the [[metric tensor]] on the manifold.\n\nThe volume form is denoted variously by\n\n:<math>\\omega = \\mathrm{vol}_n = \\varepsilon = {\\star}(1) .</math>\n\nHere, the <math>{\\star}</math> is the [[Hodge star]], thus the last form, <math>{\\star} (1)</math>, emphasizes that the volume form is the Hodge dual of the constant map on the manifold, which equals the [[Levi-Civita tensor|Levi-Civita ''tensor'']] ''\u03b5''.\n\nAlthough the Greek letter ''\u03c9'' is frequently used to denote the volume form, this notation is not universal; the symbol ''\u03c9'' often carries many other meanings in [[differential geometry]] (such as a symplectic form).\n\n==Invariants of a volume form==\nVolume forms are not unique; they form a [[torsor]] over non-vanishing functions on the manifold, as follows. Given a non-vanishing function ''f'' on ''M'', and a volume form <math>\\omega</math>, \n<math>f\\omega</math> is a volume form on ''M''. Conversely, given two volume forms <math>\\omega, \\omega'</math>, their ratio is a non-vanishing function (positive if they define the same orientation, negative if they define opposite orientations).\n\nIn coordinates, they are both simply a non-zero function times [[Lebesgue measure]], and their ratio is the ratio of the functions, which is independent of choice of coordinates. Intrinsically, it is the [[Radon\u2013Nikodym theorem#Radon.E2.80.93Nikodym derivative|Radon\u2013Nikodym derivative]] of <math>\\omega'</math> with respect to <math>\\omega</math>.  On an oriented manifold, the proportionality of any two volume forms can be thought of as a geometric form of the [[Radon\u2013Nikodym theorem]].\n\n===No local structure===\nA volume form on a manifold has no local structure in the sense that it is not possible on small open sets to distinguish between the given volume form and the volume form on Euclidean space {{harv|Kobayashi|1972}}.  That is, for every point ''p'' in ''M'', there is an open neighborhood ''U'' of ''p'' and a [[diffeomorphism]] ''&phi;'' of ''U'' onto an open set in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> such that the volume form on ''U'' is the [[pullback]] of <math>dx^1\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^n</math> along ''&phi;''.\n\nAs a corollary, if ''M'' and ''N'' are two manifolds, each with volume forms <math>\\omega_M, \\omega_N</math>, then for any points <math>m\\in M, n\\in N</math>, there are open neighborhoods ''U'' of ''m'' and ''V'' of ''n'' and a map <math>f\\colon U \\to V</math> such that the volume form on ''N'' restricted to the neighborhood ''V'' pulls back to volume form on ''M'' restricted to the neighborhood ''U'': <math>f^*\\omega_N\\vert_V = \\omega_M\\vert_U</math>.\n\nIn one dimension, one can prove it thus:\ngiven a volume form <math>\\omega</math> on <math>\\mathbf{R}</math>, define\n:<math>f(x) := \\int_0^x \\omega.</math>\nThen the standard [[Lebesgue measure]] <math>dx</math> [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pulls back]] to <math>\\omega</math> under ''f'': <math>\\omega = f^*dx</math>. Concretely, <math>\\omega = f'\\,dx</math>.  In higher dimensions, given any point <math>m \\in M</math>, it has a neighborhood locally homeomorphic to <math>\\mathbf{R}\\times\\mathbf{R}^{n-1}</math>, and one can apply the same procedure.\n\n===Global structure: volume===\nA volume form on a connected manifold ''M'' has a single global invariant, namely the (overall) volume (denoted <math>\\mu(M)</math>), which is invariant under volume-form preserving maps; this may be infinite, such as for Lebesgue measure on <math>\\mathbf{R}^n</math>. On a disconnected manifold, the volume of each connected component is the invariant.\n\nIn symbols, if <math>f\\colon M \\to N</math> is a homeomorphism of manifolds that pulls back <math>\\omega_N</math> to <math>\\omega_M</math>, then\n\n: <math>\\mu(N)=\\int_N \\omega_N = \\int_{f(M)} \\omega_N = \\int_M f^*\\omega_N = \\int_M \\omega_M=\\mu(M)\\,</math>\n\nand the manifolds have the same volume.\n\nVolume forms can also be pulled back under [[covering map]]s, in which case they multiply volume by the cardinality of the fiber (formally, by integration along the fiber). In the case of an infinite sheeted cover (such as <math>\\mathbf{R} \\to S^1</math>), a volume form on a finite volume manifold pulls back to a volume form on an infinite volume manifold.\n\n==See also==\n* {{section link|Cylindrical coordinate system|Line and volume elements}}\n* [[Measure (mathematics)]]\n* [[Poincar\u00e9 metric]] provides a review of the volume form on the [[complex plane]]\n* {{section link|Spherical coordinate system|Integration and differentiation in spherical coordinates}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | first = S. | last = Kobayashi | title = Transformation Groups in Differential Geometry | series = Classics in Mathematics | publisher = Springer | year = 1972 | isbn = 3-540-58659-8 | oclc = 31374337}}.\n* {{citation|first=Michael|last=Spivak|authorlink=Michael Spivak|title=Calculus on Manifolds|year=1965|publisher=W.A.

In 1830, the [[Indian Removal Act]] was signed into law, and though that act did not directly address the Potawatomi people of Indiana, it led to several additional treaties that resulted in their removal.  In what came to be known as the [[Potawatomi Trail of Death]], about 860 Potawatomi Indians who had refused to leave were forced to move from Indiana to Kansas.  On September 14, 1838, the group camped near Williamsport, and on September 15 they camped in the southwestern part of the county before moving into Illinois.  Before reaching their destination in Kansas, over 40 of them had died, many of them children; two children died and were buried at the second Warren County campsite.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 2002, pp. 31, 156\u2013157.</ref>\n\nWhen the county was established, the [[Wabash River]] was vital to transportation and shipping.

In the 1840s, the [[Wabash and Erie Canal]] began to operate and provided even broader shipping opportunities, but the canal favored towns which were on the \"right side\" of the river; the canal was on the [[Fountain County, Indiana|Fountain County]] side, and towns like Baltimore dwindled as a result.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 1966, pp. 56\u201357.</ref>  Some towns, such as Williamsport and Perrysville, managed to participate in canal traffic through the use of side-cuts that brought traffic from the canal across the river.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 2002, p. 163.</ref>  When railroads were constructed starting in the 1850s, they in turn began to render the canals obsolete and allowed trade to reach towns that lacked water connections.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 1966, p. 134.</ref>  The canal continued to be used through the early 1870s.<ref>Clifton 1913, pp. 130\u2013131.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Courthouse in Warren County, Indiana from 1877 atlas.png|thumb|right|250px|An 1877 drawing of the second purpose-built courthouse]]\nThe first trains to run in Warren County operated on portions of the Toledo, Wabash and Western Railway (later the [[Wabash Railroad]]) in 1856.  The railroad entered the county near Williamsport and was built westward, reaching the western border at State Line City by 1857.  West Lebanon was the only other settlement near the railroad's path, but the line bypassed it by about a mile; the town subsequently moved northward to be nearer the station.  In 1869 the [[Indianapolis, Bloomington and Western Railway]] was built across Mound Township in the southern part of the county.<ref>Goodspeed 1883, p. 49.</ref>  A few years later, in 1872, a branch of the [[Chicago, Danville and Vincennes Railroad]] (known as the \"[[Pumpkin Vine Railroad]]\") was built from [[Bismarck, Illinois]], southeast through Warren County; it was built specifically to carry coal from the mines south of [[Covington, Indiana|Covington]].  A labor riot at the mines in the late 1870s interrupted the flow of coal, and this combined with the poor financial state of the railroad led to the removal of most of the track by 1880; the remaining portion was removed a few years later.  At about this time, in the early 1880s, the Chicago and Indiana Coal Railroad began operating a north\u2013south line through the county.  It became part of the [[Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad]] but was abandoned in 1920 due to financial difficulties; a new company operated the line as the [[Chicago, Attica and Southern Railroad]] starting in 1921, but financial problems affected the new company as well and the rails were removed in 1946.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 1966, pp. 11\u201312.</ref>  Another line, part of the [[New York Central Railroad]], was built through the area in 1903; locally, it ran northeast from Danville into Warren County, then turned north through the small towns of Sloan and Stewart and continued north into Benton County.  In the 1970s it became part of [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]], then [[Consolidated Rail Corporation|Conrail]]; operations on the line ceased in the 1990s and the tracks were removed, though a portion running north from Stewart remained and became the [[Bee Line Railroad]] which serves the grain processing facility in Stewart.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 2002, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\nThe Wabash Cannonball was a passenger train that ran on the Wabash Railroad between Detroit, Michigan and Saint Louis, Missouri, starting in 1949.  On September 19, 1964, the southbound Cannonball struck a truck loaded with concrete blocks at a crossing in Johnsonville.  The driver of the truck was killed instantly, but although the train derailed, no other lives were lost.

A new owner changed the name to ''The Warren Republican'' in 1854, the same year that the Republican Party was formed.  It had several different owners until 1870; it was then published by a single owner for the next 40&nbsp;years.  Another paper called ''The Warren Review'' was started in 1891 and also had several owners until the two papers combined in 1914 as ''[[The Review Republican]]'', which is now billed as \"Warren County's only newspaper\".<ref>Warren County Historical Society 1966, p. 142.</ref>  It is now owned by Community Media Group which produces newspapers and other print distribution products in six states.<ref>{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.communitymediagroup.com/\n  |title=Community Media Group\n  |accessdate=December 16, 2010\n}}</ref>  West Lebanon also had several newspapers which began publication around the time of the Civil War.

In 1830, the [[Indian Removal Act]] was signed into law, and though that act did not directly address the Potawatomi people of Indiana, it led to several additional treaties that resulted in their removal.  In what came to be known as the [[Potawatomi Trail of Death]], about 860 Potawatomi Indians who had refused to leave were forced to move from Indiana to Kansas.  On September 14, 1838, the group camped near Williamsport, and on September 15 they camped in the southwestern part of the county before moving into Illinois.  Before reaching their destination in Kansas, over 40 of them had died, many of them children; two children died and were buried at the second Warren County campsite.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 2002, pp. 31, 156\u2013157.</ref>\n\nWhen the county was established, the [[Wabash River]] was vital to transportation and shipping.  Zachariah Cicott traded up and down the river, and cities like [[Attica, Indiana|Attica]], [[Perrysville, Indiana|Perrysville]], [[Baltimore, Indiana|Baltimore]] and Williamsport were founded near the river's banks and flourished because of it.  In the 1840s, the [[Wabash and Erie Canal]] began to operate and provided even broader shipping opportunities, but the canal favored towns which were on the \"right side\" of the river; the canal was on the [[Fountain County, Indiana|Fountain County]] side, and towns like Baltimore dwindled as a result.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 1966, pp. 56\u201357.</ref>  Some towns, such as Williamsport and Perrysville, managed to participate in canal traffic through the use of side-cuts that brought traffic from the canal across the river.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 2002, p. 163.</ref>  When railroads were constructed starting in the 1850s, they in turn began to render the canals obsolete and allowed trade to reach towns that lacked water connections.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 1966, p. 134.</ref>  The canal continued to be used through the early 1870s.<ref>Clifton 1913, pp. 130\u2013131.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Courthouse in Warren County, Indiana from 1877 atlas.png|thumb|right|250px|An 1877 drawing of the second purpose-built courthouse]]\nThe first trains to run in Warren County operated on portions of the Toledo, Wabash and Western Railway (later the [[Wabash Railroad]]) in 1856.  The railroad entered the county near Williamsport and was built westward, reaching the western border at State Line City by 1857.  West Lebanon was the only other settlement near the railroad's path, but the line bypassed it by about a mile; the town subsequently moved northward to be nearer the station.  In 1869 the [[Indianapolis, Bloomington and Western Railway]] was built across Mound Township in the southern part of the county.<ref>Goodspeed 1883, p. 49.</ref>  A few years later, in 1872, a branch of the [[Chicago, Danville and Vincennes Railroad]] (known as the \"[[Pumpkin Vine Railroad]]\") was built from [[Bismarck, Illinois]], southeast through Warren County; it was built specifically to carry coal from the mines south of [[Covington, Indiana|Covington]].  A labor riot at the mines in the late 1870s interrupted the flow of coal, and this combined with the poor financial state of the railroad led to the removal of most of the track by 1880; the remaining portion was removed a few years later.  At about this time, in the early 1880s, the Chicago and Indiana Coal Railroad began operating a north\u2013south line through the county.  It became part of the [[Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad]] but was abandoned in 1920 due to financial difficulties; a new company operated the line as the [[Chicago, Attica and Southern Railroad]] starting in 1921, but financial problems affected the new company as well and the rails were removed in 1946.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 1966, pp. 11\u201312.</ref>  Another line, part of the [[New York Central Railroad]], was built through the area in 1903; locally, it ran northeast from Danville into Warren County, then turned north through the small towns of Sloan and Stewart and continued north into Benton County.  In the 1970s it became part of [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]], then [[Consolidated Rail Corporation|Conrail]]; operations on the line ceased in the 1990s and the tracks were removed, though a portion running north from Stewart remained and became the [[Bee Line Railroad]] which serves the grain processing facility in Stewart.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 2002, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\nThe Wabash Cannonball was a passenger train that ran on the Wabash Railroad between Detroit, Michigan and Saint Louis, Missouri, starting in 1949.  On September 19, 1964, the southbound Cannonball struck a truck loaded with concrete blocks at a crossing in Johnsonville.

A new owner changed the name to ''The Warren Republican'' in 1854, the same year that the Republican Party was formed.  It had several different owners until 1870; it was then published by a single owner for the next 40&nbsp;years.  Another paper called ''The Warren Review'' was started in 1891 and also had several owners until the two papers combined in 1914 as ''[[The Review Republican]]'', which is now billed as \"Warren County's only newspaper\".<ref>Warren County Historical Society 1966, p. 142.</ref>  It is now owned by Community Media Group which produces newspapers and other print distribution products in six states.<ref>{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.communitymediagroup.com/\n  |title=Community Media Group\n  |accessdate=December 16, 2010\n}}</ref>  West Lebanon also had several newspapers which began publication around the time of the Civil War.

These are attacks that have occurred on school property or related primarily to school issues or events. A narrow definition of the word ''attacks'' is used for this list so as to exclude warfare, robberies, gang violence, public attacks (as in political protests), accidental shootings, and [[suicide]]s and [[murder\u2013suicide]]s by rejected spouses or suitors. Incidents that involved only staff who work at the school have been classified as belonging at [[List of rampage killers|List of workplace killings]]. It also excludes events where no injuries take place, if an attack is foiled.\n\nThe listed attacks include [[shooting]]s, [[stabbing]]s, [[Cutting|slashings]], [[bombing]]s, and [[Battery (crime)|beatings]] administered with [[blunt instrument]]s.\n\n==Secondary school incidents==\n\n===1850s===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:65px;\"| Date\n! style=\"width:85px;\"| Location\n! style=\"width:75px;\"| Attacker(s)\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Dead{{r|group=lower-alpha|note_a}}\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Injured{{r|group=lower-alpha|note_a}}\n!

{"title_page": "2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}\n[[File:Pedro Alvares Cabral.jpg|thumb|Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]]\nThe '''Second [[Portuguese India Armadas|Portuguese India Armada]]''' was assembled in 1500 on the order of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and placed under the command of [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]].  Cabral's armada famously discovered [[Brazil]] for the Portuguese crown along the way. By and large, the Second Armada's diplomatic mission to [[India]] failed, and provoked the opening of hostilities between the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the feudal city-state of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]].  Nonetheless, it managed to establish a factory in the nearby [[Kingdom of Cochin]], the first Portuguese [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Asia.\n\n== Fleet ==\n\nThe [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first India Armada]], commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]], arrived in Portugal in the summer of 1499, in rather sorry shape. Half of his ships and men had been lost thanks to battles, disease, and storms. Although Gama came back with a hefty cargo of spices that would be sold at enormous profit, he had failed in the principal objective of his mission: to negotiate a treaty with [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], the spice entrep\u00f4t on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India. Gama managed, however, to open the sea route to India via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and secured good relations with the African city-state of [[Malindi]], a critical staging post along the way.\n\nOn King Manuel I's orders, arrangements were immediately made to begin the assembly of a second armada in [[Cascais]].  Determined not to repeat Gama's mistakes, this one was to be a large and well-armed fleet of 13 ships and 1500 men, laden with valuable gifts and diplomatic letters to win over the potentates of the east.\n\nMany details of the composition of the fleet are missing. Only three ship names are known, and there is some conflict among the sources on the captains.  The following list of ships should not be regarded as authoritative, but as a tentative list compiled from various conflicting accounts.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=5\n|style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Ship Name''' ||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Captain'''||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Notes'''\n|- valign = top\n| 1. uncertain || D.

Oddly, Couto inserts [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in place of Sim\u00e3o de Pina, but subsequently corrects himself.

The other great deviant is the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which introduces four new names: Diogo de Figueir\u00f3, Jo\u00e3o Fernandes, Ruy de Miranda, and Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves, who replace P. d'Ataide, A.

Cabral had no notable naval or military experience; his appointment as ''capit\u00e3o-mor'' (captain-major) was largely politically motivated.  The exiled [[Crown of Castile|Castillian]] nobleman [[Sancho de Tovar]] was designated vice-admiral (''soto-capit\u00e3o'') and Cabral's successor should anything happen to him.<ref group=note>This is according to Castanheda and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is. Gaspar Correia identifies Sim\u00e3o de Miranda as the predesignated successor instead.</ref>\n\nVeteran pilot [[Pedro Escobar]] was given the overall technical command of the expedition. Other veterans of the first armada included captain Nicolau Coelho, pilot [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]], and clerks Afonso Lopes and [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]].  The famed navigator Bartolomeu Dias, who was the first to double the Cape of Good Hope, and his brother Diogo Dias, who had served as clerk on Gama's ship, also served as captains. \n\nMost of the ships were either [[carracks]] (''naus'') or [[caravels]], and at least one was a small supply ship, although details on names and tonnage are missing.<ref group=note>Castanheda (1551) claims there were ten carracks and three caravels. The Anonymous Pilot refers to only twelve ships, plus a supply ship.</ref>  At least two ships, Cabral's flagship and Tovar's ''El Rei'', were said to be around 240 tons, that is, about twice the size of the largest ship in the first armada three years prior.\n\nTen ships were destined for [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (Malabar, India), while the two ships headed by the Dias brothers were destined for [[Sofala]] in East Africa and the supply ship was destined to be scuttled and burnt along the way.<ref group=note>The Sofala destination of the Dias brothers is found in Castanheda (1551). It is confirmed in the Anonymous Pilot.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro das Armadas).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\n\nAt least two ships were privately owned and outfitted: Lu\u00eds Pires's ship was owned by Diogo da Silva e Meneses, [[Count of Portalegre]], while Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha's ''Anunciada'' was owned by the king's cousin D. [[\u00c1lvaro of Braganza]], and financed by an Italian consortium composed of the Florentine bankers [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] and [[Girolamo Sernigi]] and the Genoese Antonio Salvago. The remainder belonged to the Portuguese crown.\n\nAccompanying the expedition as translator was [[Gaspar da Gama]], who was a Jew captured in Angediva by Vasco Gama, as well as four Hindu hostages from Calicut taken by Gama in 1498 during negotiations. Also aboard was the ambassador of the Sultan of Malindi, who had arrived at Portugal with Gama, and was set to return to Malindi with Cabral's expedition.\n\nOther passengers on the expedition included Aires Correia, the designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut, his secretary P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha, Afonso Furtado, the designated factor for Sofala, and clerk Martinho Neto.  Accompanying them on the trip was the royal physician and amateur astronomer, Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], who brought along the latest astrolabe and new Arabic astronomical staves for navigational experiments.  One chronicler suggests that the knight [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] was also aboard.<ref group=note>[[Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is]] is the chronicler responsible for this claim.  This is not substantiated elsewhere.  Greenlee (1938, p. li) and Diffie and Winius (1977, p. 188fn) dismiss the possibility.</ref>\n\nThe fleet carried some twenty Portuguese ''[[degredado|degredados]]'', who were criminal convicts who could fulfill their sentences by being abandoned along the shores of various places and exploring inland on the crown's behalf. Four of the degredados are known: Afonso Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Machado, Luiz de Moura, and Antonio Fernandes, who was also a ship carpenter. \n\nFinally, the fleet carried eight [[Franciscan]] friars and eight chaplains, under the supervision of the head chaplain, Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra. They were the first Portuguese Christian missionaries to India.\n\nThere are three surviving eyewitness accounts of this expedition: (1) an extended letter written by P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha (possibly dictated by Aires Correia), written from Brazil on May 1, 1500, to King Manuel I; (2) the brief letter by Mestre [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]] to the king, also from Brazil; and (3) the account of an anonymous Portuguese pilot, first published in Italian in 1507 (commonly referred to as the ''Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Piloto An\u00f4nimo'', sometimes believed to be the clerk [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]]).\n\n== Mission ==\n\nThe priority of the mission was to secure a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode), the principal commercial entrep\u00f4t of the [[Kerala]] spice trade and dominant feudal city-state on the [[Malabar coast]] of [[India]]. [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first armada had visited Calicut in 1498, but had failed to impress the elderly ruling Manivikraman Raja ('Samoothiri Raja'), the [[Zamorin of Calicut]]. As such, no agreements had been signed. Cabral's instructions were to succeed where Gama had failed, and to this end was entrusted with magnificent gifts to present to the Zamorin. Cabral was under orders to establish a ''feitoria'' ([[Factory (trading post)|factory]]) in Calicut, which would be placed under Aires Correia.\n\nThe second priority, assigned to Bartolomeu and Diogo Dias, was to search out the East African port of [[Sofala]], near the mouth of the [[Zambezi]] river.<ref>Anonymous Pilot, p. 107</ref> Sofala had been secretly visited and described by the explorer [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]] during his overland expedition a decade earlier (c. 1487), and he identified it as the endpoint of the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade.  The Portuguese crown was eager to tap into that gold source, but Gama's armada had failed to find it.  The Dias brothers were instructed to find and establish a factory at Sofala under designated factor Afonso Furtado.  To this end, the brothers were likely also instructed to secure the consent of [[Kilwa Sultanate|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city-state of the East African coast and putative overlord of Sofala.  \n\nA minor objective included the delivery of a group of [[Franciscan]] missionaries to India. It is said that Vasco da Gama had misinterpreted the [[Hinduism]] he saw practiced in India as a form of \"primitive\" Christianity.  He believed its peculiar characteristics were a result of centuries of separation from the mainstream church in Europe. As such, Gama recommended that missionaries be sent to India to help bring the practices of the \"Hindu church\" up to date with Roman Catholic orthodoxy.  To this end, a group of Franciscan friars, led by Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra, joined the expedition.\n\nAs a final objective, the Second Armada was also a commercial spice run. The crown and private merchants who had outfitted the ships expected full cargoes of spices to return to Lisbon. \n\n=== Suspected Brazilian mission ===\n\nThere has been some debate over whether Cabral also had secret instructions from the king to lay claim to the landmass of Brazil\u2014or, more precisely, to swing as far west as possible to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]] and claim whatever lands or islands might be discovered there for the Portuguese crown, before the Spanish did.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peres |first=Dami\u00e3o |date=1949 |title=O descobrimento do Brasil por Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral: antecedentes e intencionalidade |language=Portuguese}}</ref> Among the pieces of evidence is an indication of an island in the area in a 1448 map of [[Andrea Bianco]], apparently alluded to in the letter of Master Jo\u00e3o Faras; there is also the suggestion by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in his ''Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis'' that he had been sent on an expedition to a western landmass in 1498.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pacheco Pereira |first=Duarte |date=c. 1505 |title=Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis |url=https://archive.org/details/esmeraldodesitu00peregoog/page/n62/mode/2up |chapter=Cap 2: Da cantidade & grandeza da terra, & daugua qual destas he a mayor parte. |language=Portuguese}}</ref> That is about the full extent of the evidence of intentionality and this claim is largely speculative.<ref>{{cite book|last=Greenlee |first=William Brooks |date=1938 |pages=l\u2013lv |title=The Voyage of Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral to Brazil and India: from contemporary documents and narratives |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1409414485}}</ref> There are various reasons to presume the existence of such instructions unlikely.\n\nSpanish explorers had certainly been tending south at that time. Christopher Columbus]had touched the coast of the South American mainland around [[Guyana]] in 1498 on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third trip]]. In late 1499, [[Alonso de Ojeda]] had discovered much of the [[Venezuela|Venezuelan]] coast and in early 1500, [[Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n]] and [[Diego de Lepe]], via generous southerly swings from the [[Canary islands]], had reached at least what is now [[Cear\u00e1]], and perhaps went as far east as [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape of Santo Agostinho]] in [[Pernambuco]]. They had explored much of the northern Brazilian coast west of it. It is possible that the southerly Spanish tendencies were deliberate, aimed at securing more land for the Spanish crown.<ref group=note>Although the person from whom the Spanish crown was trying to claim land was not the king of Portugal, as that was already mediated by Tordesillas, but Christopher Columbus, their own vice-roy of the Indies. Ojeda, Pinz\u00f3n, and Lepe were all dispatched on separate royal capitulations by [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], an enemy of Columbus, with the deliberate intent of finding and claiming lands ''outside'' (i.e., to the south) of the Columbus-owned West Indian islands, thereby circumscribing Columbus's viceroyalty and limiting him to the islands he already had. This would figure in later lawsuits by the Columbus family.</ref>\n\nThese expeditions, however, were too recent for their results to have been known in Lisbon before Cabral's departure in March 1500; indeed, they were unknown in Spain itself. It is very doubtful that the Portuguese were aware of them. Even if they were, it would not seem sensible for Cabral's Second Armada to be instructed to deviate from its original mission in India to pursue exploratory work which be far more efficiently accomplished by smaller caravels. \n\n== Outward journey ==\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu).jpg|thumb|350px|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'']]\nOn March 9, Cabral's expedition set out from the [[Tagus]]. Thirteen days later, on March 22, Cabral's armada reached the island of [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]] in the middle of a storm.  The privately outfitted ship of Lu\u00eds Pires was too damaged by the tempest to continue, and returned to Lisbon<ref>According to Barros (1552, II.5.2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA386#v=onepage&q&f=false p.386]); also Castanheda (1551), G\u00f3is (1566).</ref><ref group=note>Caminha's eyewitness account made no mention of Pires and instead reported that it was the Vasco de Ataide's crown ship that was lost around Cape Verde.</ref>\n\nFrom Cape Verde, Cabral went southwest. It is unknown why he chose such an unusual direction, but the most probable hypothesis is that he was simply following the wide arc in the South Atlantic to catch a favorable wind to carry them to the Cape of Good Hope. Navigationally, the arc is sensible. From Cape Verde, the ship would cut across the [[doldrums]] below the equator, catch the southwest-bound [[South Equatorial Current|equatorial drift]], and turn into the southbound [[Brazil Current]] that will carry them down to the [[horse latitudes]] (30\u00b0S), where the prevailing [[westerlies]] begin.  The westerlies would easily carry the ships across the South Atlantic around the Cape of Good Hope. If instead of this arc, Cabral attempted to strike southeast from Cape Verde, it would go into the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. To reach the Cape from there would be a struggle, as Cabral would have had to sail against the southeasterly [[trade wind|trade winds]], as well as the [[Benguela Current]]. \n\nHow Cabral knew of this arc is unknown. Most likely, this was precisely the route followed by Gama on his first trip in 1497. The veterans of the first fleet\u2014notably the pilots Alenquer and Escobar\u2014would very likely have charted the same route for Cabral again.<ref group=note>That this arc was sailed by Gama in 1497 is uncertain, but most modern historians have come to accept that he did. How did Gama know about the arc when no one had yet sailed it before? Some have speculated that the Portuguese crown might have dispatched secret exploratory expeditions to those waters in advance. The more widely accepted hypothesis, first forwarded by admiral [[Gago Coutinho]], is more straightforward: Since Bartolomeu Dias's 1488 expedition discovered the westerlies, the South Atlantic arc became \"navigationally obvious\" to any sensible pilot, especially pilots as experienced as Alenquer and Escobar. See Gago Coutinho (1951\u201352) ''A Nautica dos Descobrimentos: os descobrimentos maritimos visitos por um navegador'', 2 vols., Lisbon: Agencia Geral do Ultramar.</ref> Indeed, in the Lisbon archives, there is a draft of a document intended for Cabral that instructs him to strike in a southwesterly direction when he reaches the doldrums.<ref>After Cape Verde, where the wind is weak ('vento escasso') the ships should strike in the open ocean arc ('ir na volta do mar'), until the Cape of Good Hope, as this is the shorter route ('a navega\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 mais breve'). See Fonseca (1908, p. 211; see also p.224) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false copy of letter]; see also Greenlee (1938, p. 167)</ref> \n\nAlternative hypotheses forwarded for Cabral striking southwest are that he was trying to reach the [[Azores]] to repair his storm-battered fleet, that he was searching for and rounding up missing tempest-tossed ships, or that it was an intentional attempt to discover if there was any land by the Tordesillas line.\n\n=== Discovery of Brazil ===\n\nCabral took the same path as Gama had, but made a slightly wider arc and went further west than Gama had. As a result, he hit upon the hitherto unknown landmass of Brazil. After nearly 30 days of sailing (44 since departure), on April 21, Cabral's fleet found the first indications of nearby land.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fonseca |first=Faustino da |date=1908 |page=225 |title=A Descoberta to Brasil |language=Portuguese |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Livraria Central de Gomes de Carvalho |place=Lisbon}}</ref> The next day, the armada caught sight of the Brazilian coast, seeing the outlines of a hill they named [[Monte Pascoal]].\n\nThe armada anchored at the mouth of the [[Do Frade River|Frade river]] the next day, and a group of local [[Tupiniquim]] Indians assembled on the beach. Cabral dispatched a small party, headed by Nicolau Coelho, in a longboat ashore to make first contact. Coelho tossed his hat in exchange for a feathered headdress, but the surf was too strong for a proper landing and opening of communication, so they returned to the ships.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fonseca |first=Faustino da |date=1908 |pages=241\u2013242 |title=A Descoberta to Brasil |language=Portuguese |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Livraria Central de Gomes de Carvalho |place=Lisbon}}</ref>\n\nStrong overnight winds prompted the armada to lift anchor and sail some 10 leagues (45&nbsp;km) north, finding harbor behind the reef at Cabr\u00e1lia Bay, just north of [[Porto Seguro]].  The pilot Afonso Lopes, while [[Sounding line|sounding]] in a rowboat, spotted a native canoe, captured the two Indians on board, and brought them back to ship. The language barrier prevented questioning, but they were fed and given cloth and beads. The cultural difference was apparent: The natives spat out their honey and cake and were deeply surprised upon seeing a chicken.<ref>Guia politicamente incorreto da Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil, Leandro Narloch</ref>\n\nThe next day, on April 25, a party led by Coelho and Bartolomeu Dias went ashore, accompanied by the two natives. Armed Tupiniquim warily approached the beach, but upon a signal from the two natives, set down their bows, and allowed the Portuguese to land and collect water.\n\n[[File:Meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The First Mass in Brazil'' by [[Victor Meirelles]] (1861)]]\n\nOn April 26, the Octave of Easter Sunday, the Franciscan friar Henrique Soares of Coimbra went ashore to celebrate mass in front of 200 Tupiniquim Indians.  This is the first known Christian mass on the American mainland.\n\nInteraction between the Portuguese and the Tupiniquim gradually increased throughout the week.  European iron nails, cloth, beads, and crucifixes were traded for American amulets, spears, parrots, and monkeys. There was only the slightest hint that precious metals might be found in the hinterlands. Portuguese ''degredados'' are assigned to spend the night in Tupiniquim villages, while the rest of the crew sleeps aboard ships.\n\n[[File:Carta-caminha.png|thumb|150px|Facsimile of P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha's letter to the king, reporting the discovery of the \"Island of the True Cross\" (Brazil)]]\n\nOn May 1, Cabral makes preparations to resume the journey to India. The Portuguese pilots, assisted by the physician-astronomer Master Jo\u00e3o Faras, determined that Brazil lay east of the Tordesillas line, prompting Cabral to formally claim it for the Portuguese crown, bestowing upon it the name of ''Ilha de Vera Cruz'' (\"Island  of the True Cross\"). It was later renamed ''Terra de Santa Cruz''\u2014\"Land of the Holy Cross\"\u2014upon the realization that it was not an island).<ref group=note>Gaspar Correia ([https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3ALCCN05022145&as_brr=1&pg=PA152#v=onepage&q&f=false p.152]) and Jo\u00e3o de Barros ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA391#v=onepage&q&f=false p.391]) say it was named \"Santa Cruz\" from the start, with Correia saying it was named so because the departure date was the [[Feast of the Cross]] on the liturgical calendar. However, both Caminha's and Mestre Jo\u00e3o's letters are signed as written from \"Vera Cruz\" on May 1.</ref>\n\nOn May 2, Cabral dispatched the supply ship back to [[Lisbon]], with the Brazilian items and a letter to King Manuel I composed by the secretary P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha to announce the discovery.<ref>Anonymous Pilot [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCsOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false p.110]</ref> It also carried a separate private letter to the king from Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], in which he identified the main guiding constellation in the southern hemisphere, the [[Southern Cross]] (''Cruzeiro'').<ref>Some sources claim that the ''Cruzeiro'' constellation had already been identified by [[Alvise Cadamosto]] in the 1450s.</ref> The supply ship arrived in Lisbon in June.\n\nAfter that, with a couple of Portuguese ''degredados'' left beind with the Tupiniquim of Porto Seguro,<ref>Anonymous Pilot [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCsOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false p.110]</ref> Cabral ordered the eleven remaining ships to set sail and continue on their route to India.\n\n=== Crossing to India ===\n\nAfter crossing the Atlantic Ocean, Cabral's armada reached the Cape of Good Hope in late May.  The fleet faced headlong winds for six straight days and four ship\u2014Bartolomeu Dias's, Aires Gomes da Silva's, Sim\u00e3o de Pina's, and Vasco de Ata\u00edde's\u2014are lost at sea in the process.<ref>Castanheda (1551)</ref><ref>Barros (1552)</ref><ref>G\u00f3is (1566)</ref><ref group=note>The ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'' mistakenly substitutes Sim\u00e3o de Miranda for Sim\u00e3o da Pina in the losses, although this is corrected in the marginal gloss. Gaspar Correia (1550) almost concurs\u2014but as he does not have Aires Gomes da Silva on his original captain list, he identifies the fourth ship lost as Gaspar de Lemos. Similarly, the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which has neither Pina nor Gomes da Silva on its list, say it was Diogo de Figueir\u00f3 and Luis Pires who were lost.  Diogo do Couto (c.1600) mistakenly adds P\u00earo d'Ataide to the list, bringing the losses to five. Some scholars also contend that Pires was lost at this point, and Vasco de Ata\u00edde had been lost earlier at Cape Verde.</ref> In this way, the fleet was reduced to seven ships. Facing strong winds, the armada split into smaller groups to meet again on the other side. Cabral's ship went with two others.\n\nOn June 16, 1500, Cabral's three-ship squadron reached the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago|Primeiras Islands]] several leagues north of Sofala.  Two local merchant ships, catching sight of Cabral, took flight. Cabral gave pursuit\u2014one of them runs aground and the other is captured. Upon questioning, it was discovered that these ships were owned by a cousin of the sultan Fateima of Malindi (who had received Vasco da Gama in 1498), so they were released. \n\nThe three ships landed on [[Mozambique Island]] on June 22. Despite the earlier quarrel with his ships, Cabral was given a warm reception by the Sultan of Mozambique and was allowed to collect water and supplies.  Shortly after, three more ships of the Second Armada sailed into the island and joined with Cabral.  Only the ship of Diogo Dias remained missing.  As Dias's mission was for Sofala anyway, Cabral decided not to wait for it and instead pressed on with his fleet of six ships.\n\n[[File:Map of Cabral route, 1500.gif|thumb|340px|Approximate route of outward journey of Cabral's 2nd Armada (also route of stray ship of Diogo Dias)]]\n\nMore than a month later, on July 26, Cabral's armada reached [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], the dominant city-state of the East African coast and which Gama had never visited. Afonso Furtado, who had been appointed factor for Sofala in Lisbon and had escaped death (Furtado had been aboard Bartolomeu Dias's ship, but moved to the flagship just before the Cape crossing), went ashore to open negotiations with the strongman ruler, Emir Ibrahim.<ref group=note>At the time, there was no ruling [[Kilwa Sultanate|Sultan of Kilwa]] as the previous one, al-Fudail, had been deposed in a coup (c. 1495) by his minister, Emir Ibrahim, who had since ruled Kilwa with a vacant throne.</ref>\n\nA meeting was arranged between Cabral and Ibrahim, conducted on a couple of rowboats in the harbor. Cabral presents a letter from King Manuel I proposing a treaty, but Ibrahim was suspicious and remained resistant to the overtures. Cabral, sensing Ibrahim's resistance and worrying that they might miss the monsoon winds to India, broke off the negotiations and sailed on.\n\nPressing north, the Cabral fleet avoided the hostile [[Mombassa]] (''Momba\u00e7a'') and finally reached friendly Malindi (''Melinde'') on August 2.  There, he was well-received by the Sultan of Malindi and dropped off the Malindi ambassador that Gama had taken the previous year.  Leaving behind  two ''degredados'', Lu\u00eds de Moura and Jo\u00e3o Machado, and picking up two Gujarati pilots, Cabral's six-ship armada finally began its Indian Ocean crossing on August 7, 1500.\n\n== Cabral in India ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\nAfter an uneventful ocean crossing, Cabral's six ships landed on [[Anjediva Island]] (''Angediva'', Anjadip) on August 22, where they rested and repaired and repainted the ships.\n\nSailing down the Indian coast, Cabral's expedition finally reached [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] on September 13. Gaily decorated native boats came out to greet them, but remembering Gama's experience, Cabral refused to go ashore until hostages were exchanged. He dispatched Afonso Furtado and the four Calicut hostages taken by Gama the previous year to negotiate the details of the landing. When the negotiation was complete, Cabral finally went ashore himself and met the new Zamorin of Calicut. Cabral presents him with much finer and more luxurious gifts than Gama had brought, and more respectful and personalized letters of address from King Manuel I of Portugal.\n\nA commercial treaty was successfully negotiated and the Zamorin gave Cabral a security-of-trade certificate etched on a silver plate. The Portuguese were permitted to establish a ''feitoria]]'' in Calicut. Aires Correia went ashore with around 70 men. Once the factory was set up, Cabral released the ship hostages as a sign of trust and Correia set about buying spices in Calicut's markets for the ships to take home.\n\nSometime in October, the Zamorin of Calicut dispatched a service request to Cabral's idling fleet. Arab merchants allied with the rival city-state of [[Cochin kingdom|Cochin]] were returning from [[Ceylon]] with a cargo of war elephants destined for the Sultan of [[Cambay]]. Claiming it to be illegal contraband, the Zamorin asked Cabral to intercept them. Cabral sent one of his caravels under P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde to capture it.  Hoping for a spectacle, the Zamorin himself came down to the beachfront to witness the engagement, but left in disgust when the Arab ship slipped past Ataide, who gave chase and eventually caught up to it near Cannanore] He successfully seized the vessel and Cabral presented the captured ship, with its nearly intact elephant cargo, to the Zamorin as a gift.\n\n=== Calicut Massacre ===\n\nBy December of 1500, factor Aires Correia was still only able to buy enough spices to load two of the ships. He complained to Cabral his suspicions that the guild of Arab merchants in Calicut had been colluding to shut out Portuguese purchasing agents from the city's spice markets. Arab traders had reportedly used similar tactics to drive out Chinese merchants earlier in the 15th century from various ports on the [[Malabar Coast]]. Correia thought that it would make sense if they repeated this, particularly as the Portuguese had been clear with their hatred of \"the Moors\" and had demanded trading privileges and preferences.<ref group=note>Historians now think that the Portuguese traders may have in fact been unwitting counters in ongoing quarrels between competing older and newer Arab merchant guilds in Calicut. They may also have been used as pawns in the personal power struggles among the Zamorin's leading advisors.</ref>\n\nCabral presented Correia's complaint to the Zamorin, and requested that he crack down on the Arab merchant guild or enforce Portuguese priority in the spice markets. But the Zamorin refused Cabral's demand that he actively intervene in the market. \n\nFrustrated by the Zamorin's inaction, Cabral decided to take matters into his own hands. On December 17, on the advice of Aires Correia, Cabral ordered the seizure of an Arab merchant ship from [[Jeddah]], which had been loaded up with spices. He claimed that the Zamorin had promised the Portuguese priority in the spice markets, and so the cargo was rightfully theirs. Incensed, the Arab merchants around the quay immediately raised a riot in Calicut and direct mobs to attack the Portuguese factory. The Portuguese ships, anchored out in the harbor and unable to approach the docks, could only watch the unfolding massacre. After three hours of fighting, 53 (though some sources say 70) Portuguese were slaughtered by the mobs\u2014including the factor Aires Correia, the secretary Caminha, and three (some say five) of the Franciscan friars.  Around twenty Portuguese in the city managed to escape the riot by jumping into the harbor waters and swimming to the ships. The survivors reported to Cabral that the Zamorin's own guards were seen either standing aside or actively helping the rioters. At least one Portuguese, a man called Gon\u00e7alo Peixoto, was sheltered from the mob by a local merchant (whom the chronicles call \"Coja Bequij\") and survived the massacre. \n\nAfter the Calicut massacre, the wares in the Portuguese factory were impounded by the Calicut authorities.\n\n=== War with Calicut ===\n\nIncensed at the attack on the factory, Cabral waited one day for redress by the Zamorin.  When this did not arrive, Cabral and the Portuguese seized around ten Arab merchant ships then in harbor between December 18 and 22. They confiscated the ships' cargoes, killed the crews, and burned their ships. Then, accusing the Zamorin of sanctioning the riot, Cabral ordered a full day [[shore bombardment]] of Calicut, doing immense damage to the unfortified city. Estimates of Calicut casualties reach up to 600. Cabral proceeded to also bomb the nearby Zamorin-owned port of Pandarane.<ref group=note>The port of Pandarane has since disappeared. Its location is usually identified as 'Pantalyini Kollam', a port that has since been annexed by the growing city of [[Koyilandy]]; it is also sometimes identified with modern [[Kappad]]. (Dames, 1918, p.85)</ref>\n\nThis marked the beginning of the war between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Zamorin of Calicut. The war dragged on for the next decade and became an important focus of future armadas. It ultimately dictated Portuguese strategy in the Indian Ocean and overturned the political order on the Malabar Coast of India.\n\n=== Alliance with Cochin kingdom ===\n\n[[File:Kerala cities at time of Cabral (1500).gif|thumb|250px|India Malabar Coast c. 1500]]\nOn December 24, Cabral left the smoldering Calicut, unsure of what to do next. At the suggestion of Gaspar da Gama, the Goese Jew who had been accompanying the expedition, Cabral set sail south along the coast toward Cochin kingdom (''Cochim'', Kochi or Perumpadappu Swarupam), a small Hindu [[Nair]] city-state at the outlet of the [[Vembanad Lake|Vembanad lagoon]] in the Kerala backwaters. Partly in vassalage to and partly at war with Zamorin's Calicut, Cochin had long chafed at the dominance of its larger neighbor and was looking for an opportunity to break away.\n\nArriving in Cochin, a Portuguese emissary and a [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christian]] picked up in Calicut went ashore to make contact with the Trimumpara Raja (Unni Goda Varma), the Nair Hindu prince of Cochin.<ref group=note>The exact status of the Trimumpara Raja is a bit unclear.  It seems that the formal ruler of Cochin was the king of [[Edapalli]], which was across the lagoon on the mainland, but that the Cochinese peninsula (with capital at [[Perumpadappu (Malappuram district)|Perumpadappu]]) had at some point been detached as an appanage for a son, who, in turn, had detached the northern tip, Cochin proper, for another son. Moreover, it seems that these appanages were not supposed to be permanent fiefs, but rather to serve as temporary \"training grounds\" for princely heirs before they moved up in succession order. In other words, the ruler of Cochin was the second heir of Edapalli. Upon the death of the ruler of Edapalli, the first heir was meant to leave the peninsula and take up his duties in Edapalli, and the second heir would from Cochin to Perumpadappu, and assign Cochin to his own successor (the new second heir). The Portuguese seem to have arrived at a time when the princely heirs were somewhat at odds with one another, for some reason or another. It was only under Portuguese protection that the rulers of Cochin finally became proper kings in their own right.  Thus the Raja Trimumpara's search for a Portuguese alliance possibly had more to do with his own family quarrels than with the exactions of the Zamorin of Calicut.  See Dames (1918: p.86n).</ref> The Portuguese were greeted warmly, with the bombardment of Calicut outweighing the earlier matter of the war elephants. With all the cordialities and hostage-swapping completed quickly, Cabral himself went ashore and negotiated a treaty of alliance between Portugal and Cochin, directed against Zamorin's Calicut. Cabral promised to make the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin the ruler of kingdom of Calicut upon the city's capture.\n\nA Portuguese factory is set up in Cochin, with Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa as chief factor. The spice markets of the smaller Cochin were not nearly as well-supplied as those of Calicut, but the trade was good enough to begin loading ships.  The stay in Cochin was not, however, without incident. The factory was set ablaze one evening, likely at the instigation of Arab traders in the city. The Trimumpara Raja, in contrast with the Zamorin of Calicut, cracked down on the arsonists. He took the Portuguese under his protection by having the factors stay in his palace and assigned his personal Nair guards to escort the factors in the city markets and protect the factory against further incidents.\n\nIn early January of 1501, while in Cochin, Cabral received missives from the rulers of Cannanore (''Canonor'', Kannur or Kolathunad), one of Calicut's reluctant rivals in the north, and [[Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam or Venad Swarupam), which was further south and had once been a great Syrian Christian merchant city-state, being an entrep\u00f4t for cinnamon, ginger, and dyewood.  They commended Cabral's actions against Calicut and invited the Portuguese to trade in their cities instead. Not wishing to offend his Cochinese host, Cabral declined the invitations, only promising to visit the cities at some future date.\n\nWhile still in Cochin, Cabral received yet another invitation, this one from the nearby [[Kodungallur Kovilakam|Cranganore kingdom]] (''Cranganor'', Kodungallur). The once-great capital of the [[Chera dynasty]] of [[Sangam period]] had recently been facing various natural disasters. The channels that connected Cranganore to the waterways were silted up, breaking open a competing sea outlet by Cochin in the 14th century.<ref group=note>Cochin was originally just a village along a long embankment.  Violent overflows of the [[Periyar River]] in 1341 forced the opening of the outlet between the Vembanad lagoon and the Arabian Sea at the juncture where Cochin now sits, separating the long Cochinese peninsula from what is now [[Vypin]] island. See Hunter's ''Imperial Gazetteer'' (1908, p.360).</ref> Cochin's rise had been principally due to the re-routing of commercial traffic away from Cranganore. Nonetheless, the remaining merchants of the dwindling city still maintained their old connections to the Kerala pepper plantations in the interior. Finding the supply in Cochin running low, Cabral took up the offer to load some cargo at Cranganore.\n\nThe visit to Cranganore turned out to be an eye-opener for the Portuguese, for among the city's remaining inhabitants are substantial established communities of [[Cochin Jews|Malabari Jews]] and [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christians]].  The encounter with a clearly recognizable Christian community in Kerala confirmed to Cabral what the Franciscan friars had already suspected back in Calicut, namely that Vasco da Gama's earlier hypothesis about a \"Hindu Church\" was mistaken. If real Christians had existed alongside Hindus in India for centuries, after all, then clearly Hinduism must be a distinct religion. Hindus were \"heathen idolaters\", as the Portuguese friars characterized them, rather than adherents to a \"primitive\" form of Christianity.  Two Syrian Christian priests from Cranganore applied to Cabral for passage to Europe.<ref group=note>One of these priests, known as Jos\u00e9 de Cranganore or Joseph the Indian (''Josephus Indus''), eventually would provide instrumental intelligence about India to the Portuguese. Upon arrival in Lisbon, Joseph the Indian spent a couple of years being intensely interviewed by the Portuguese court and the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], relating to them his detailed knowledge of the history and geography of India and the east, expanding Portuguese intelligence dramatically. It is likely that the detailed depiction of the east Indian coast and the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 is owed in large part to this information.  Around 1503, Joseph went to Rome to meet [[Pope Alexander VI]] and report on the condition of the Malabari Syrian Christian church.  It was on this trip that Joseph dictated his famous narrative on India to an Italian scribe, which was eventually published in 1507 (in Italian) as part of a collection, ''Paesi Novamente Retrovati'', edited by Fracanzio da Montalboddo.  The narrative includes Joseph's own account of Cabral's expedition.  See Vallavanthara (2001).</ref>\n\nOn January 16, 1501, news arrived that the Zamorin of Calicut had assembled and dispatched a fleet of around 80 boats against the Portuguese in Cochin.  Despite the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin's offer of military assistance against the Calicut fleet, Cabral decided to precipitously lift anchor and slip away rather than risk a confrontation. Cabral's armada left behind the factor Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa and six assistants in Cochin. In their hasty departure, the Portuguese inadvertently took along two of the Trimumpara's officers (Idikkela Menon and Parangoda Mennon), who had been serving as hostages aboard the vessels.\n\nHeading north, Cabral's armada took a wide sweep to avoid Calicut, and paid a quick visit to Cannanore. Cabral was warmly received by the [[Kolathiri]] Raja of Cannanore who, eager for a Portuguese alliance, offered to sell the Portuguese spices on credit. Cabral accepted the cargo but paid him nonetheless. Even though the cargo turned out to only be low-quality ginger, Cabral was appreciative of the gesture. \n\nHis ships now filled with spices, Cabral decided not to visit Quilon, as he had earlier promised, but to make way back home to Portugal instead.\n\n== Diogo Dias' misadventures ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nWhile Cabral's main fleet was in India, [[Diogo Dias]], captain of the missing seventh ship of the armada, was going through his own set of adventures.\n\n[[File:Detail of Diogo Dias's ship (Cabral Armada).jpg|thumb|180px|Ship of [[Diogo Dias]], detail from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\nShortly after being separated from the main fleet at the Cape in June 1500, Dias had struck out too far east into the Indian Ocean and sighted the western coast of the island of [[Madagascar]].  Although the island was not unknown (its Arab name, \"island of the Moon\", was already reported by [[Pero de Covilha|Covilh\u00e3]]), Diogo Dias was the first Portuguese captain to have sighted it and is often credited with renaming it the island of ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o'', on account of it being found on [[St. Lawrence]]'s day (August 10, 1500).  However, a proper landing on Madagascar would not be undertaken until 1506 and it would only be extensively explored in 1508.\n\nProbably thinking he was on a South African island, Diogo Dias tried to find the African coast by sailing straight north from Madagascar, hoping to reconnect with Cabral's armada there, or at least to make it to [[Sofala]] (Dias's formal destination).  But to no avail.  He had struck too far east, and was heading along north in open ocean.  Dias sighted the African coast only around [[Mogadishu]] (''Magadoxo''). By this time, Cabral had already crossed the Indian Ocean, and the change in the monsoon winds prevented Dias from undertaking his own crossing. Dias pushed up the coast, unexpectedly going past [[Cape Guardafui]] into the [[Gulf of Aden]], waters as yet unsailed by Portuguese ships.  Dias spent the next few months in the area\u2014trapped by contrary winds, battered by tempests, attacked by Arab pirates, and forced aground on the [[Eritrea]]n coast, in a desperate search for water and food.\n\nDias eventually (in late 1500 and early 1501) managed to procure supplies, repair his ship and catch a favorable wind to take him out of that harrowing trap.  With his remaining six crewmen, Dias set sail back to Portugal, hoping to catch Cabral's armada on the return journey.\n\n== Return journey ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nLate January, 1501 \u2013 Cabral takes aboard an ambassador from Cannanore, and starts his ocean crossing back to East Africa.  On the way, the Portuguese capture a  Gujarati ship, replete with a magnificent cargo.  They steal the cargo, but spare the crew, once they realize they are not Arabs.\n\nFebruary, 1501 \u2013 As Cabral's expedition approaches [[Malindi]], vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]], sailing at the front, runs his spice-laden ship, the ''El Rei'', aground on the Malindi coast.  Irreparable, the great ship is burnt (to recover the iron fittings) and the crews and the cargo reallocated.  Cabral's armada is now reduced to five ships. Cabral authorizes the king of Malindi to recover the cannons from the ''El Rei'' wreck and keep them for himself.\n\nSpring, 1501 \u2013 Cabral's fleet reaches [[Mozambique Island]].  As there is no sign or news from [[Diogo Dias]] awaiting him, Cabral realizes he must take responsibility for the Sofala mission himself.  Cabral orders the private ship ''Anunciada'' of Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha, the fastest in the fleet, to be placed under the command of veteran hand [[Nicolau Coelho]], and dispatched ahead of the rest of the fleet and deliver the results of the voyage to Portugal.  Vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]] (who had lost the ''El-Rei'') is given the chance to make amends by taking command of the caravel ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (hitherto commanded by [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]) and seek out Sofala and to proceed home alone from there.  Ata\u00edde is transferred to the command of Coelho's old nau.\n\nIn the meantime, Cabral lands a ''[[degredado]]'' Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes on the African coast, with letters of instruction for Diogo Dias and any passing Portuguese expeditions, informing them of the dramatic turn of events in India, and warning them to avoid Calicut.\n\n[It is uncertain exactly where Cabral left Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes or where he was ordered to go.  According to Ata\u00edde, Fernandes was ordered to go to Mombassa (odd, as Mombassa was then on hostile terms with the Portuguese); others suggest he was supposed to go to Kilwa (which is where the 3rd Armada of [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]] will find him). Others have speculated that Fernandes was left in Kilwa on the outward leg, and that Cabral's letters were dispatched to him by a local messenger from Mozambique on the return.  Another possibility is that Fernandes was instructed to make his way to Sofala overland, meet Tovar's ship there, and then proceed to explore inland from there to locate [[Monomatapa]] (but then why give him the letters?).  Finally, some conjecture Fernandes is being confused with another degredado, Jo\u00e3o Machado, who had been left in Malindi on the first leg, that he was picked up on the return, and now sent back once again with the letters.]\n\nMarch\u2013April, 1501 \u2013 Matters settled, Cabral takes the remaining three ships\u2014his own flagship, the large nau of Sim\u00e3o de Miranda and Coelho's ship (now under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]])\u2014and sets sail out of Mozambique island.\n\nAta\u00edde gets separated from the other two in the [[Mozambique Channel]] soon after departure. He hurries to S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s ([[Mossel Bay]], South Africa), hoping to find Cabral there waiting for him.  But he is out of luck\u2014Cabral and Miranda had decided to proceed on together towards Lisbon without him.  Not finding any trace of the others, Ata\u00edde decides to make his way home on his own, leaving behind a letter in a boot by a local watering hole giving an account of the expedition (Ataide's note will be found later that year by [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd Armada]]).\n\nIn the meantime, Sancho de Tovar, aboard the ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', finally sights [[Sofala]], the entrepot of Monomatapa gold.  He doesn't go ashore, and instead contents himself with scouting the city from his ship, and then sets sail back home alone.\n\n=== Conference at Bezeguiche ===\n\nJune 2, 1501 \u2013 Following up on the discovery of Brazil the previous year, King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] had assembled a small exploratory expedition of three caravels under an unnamed Portuguese captain, and carrying the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] aboard, to explore and map the coast of Brazil.  The exact identity of the captain is uncertain - some speculate it to be [[Gaspar de Lemos]] or [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]], whichever of the two had commanded the supply vessel that had delivered the news in June 1500; others conjecture Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves went merely as passengers, and that the expedition itself was commanded by [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]].<ref>[[Amerigo Vespucci]] wrote two detailed accounts of this Brazilian mapping expedition - in ''Mundus Novus'' (pub. 1502/03) and as the \"third voyage\" in ''Lettera a Soderini'' (pub.1504/05) - but does not identify the Portuguese captain by name in either.  Chronicler [[Gaspar Correia]], writing a half-century later, identifies the mapping captain as the same captain who steered the returning supply ship - ergo the Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves identification.  Greenlee (1945) suggests the captain was [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]], although this has been dismissed by others (e.g. Roukema, 1963).  More recently, historians have drawn attention to a nautical chart by [[Vesconte de Maggiolo]], which identifies the Brazilian landmass with the label ''Tera de Gonsalvo Coigo Vocatur Santa Cruz'' (translated as \"Land of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] called Santa Cruz\").  [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] is known to have led a later expedition to Brazil (which set out in 1503), but it is commonly estimated that Coelho was still out at sea when Maggiolo composed his chart (c. 1504-05), thereby suggesting Coelho might have also captained the previous 1501 mapping expedition as well. (Morison, 1974, vol. 2, p.281)</ref> Setting out from Lisbon in May 1501, the little Brazilian mapping expedition made a watering stop in early June at ''Bezeguiche'' (as the bay of [[Dakar]] (Senegal) was known to the Portuguese sailors of the time) and stumbles upon  [[Diogo Dias]] cooling his heels there. Dias relates to the Portuguese captain and Vespucci the tales of his misadventures\u2014how he had been separated from Cabral at the Cape, how he had ventured up to the Gulf of Aden, and, finding no trace of Cabral on his return, decided to wait for him in Bezeguiche. Just two days later, the lead ship of the returning India fleet\u2014the ''Anunciada'' under [[Nicolau Coelho]]\u2014sails into Bezeguiche, surprised to find both Dias and the Brazilian mapping expedition there (apparently  Bezeguiche must have been a pre-arranged point of encounter for the Second Armada).\n\nFor the next two weeks, the captains and crews of the different ships exchange tales of their travels and adventures.  It has been since speculated that it was during this time that Amerigo Vespucci came up with his \"[[New World]]\" hypothesis.  After all, Vespucci was quite familiar with the Americas, having participated in [[Alonso de Ojeda|Ojeda]]'s 1499 expedition to the coasts of South America, and it is said he had intense discussions at Bezeguiche with [[Gaspar da Gama]], the Goese Jew aboard Coelho's ship, undoubtedly the person most familiar with the East Indies. Comparing notes, it probably dawned on Vespucci that it was simply impossible to square what he knew of the Americas with what the men of the 2nd Armada knew of Asia.  While still at Bezeguiche, Vespucci wrote a letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463\u20131503)|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], relating his encounter, which he sends back with some Florentine passengers on the ''Anunciada''.<ref>Vespucci's 1501 letter is reproduced in Varnhagen (1865).   An English translation can be found in W.H.Greenlee (1938: p.152ff).</ref>  This was a prelude to an even more famous letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo in 1503, shortly after his return, where he finally asserts that the Brazilian landmass was in fact a continent, that the lands discovered to the west were definitely not part of Asia, but must be an entirely different continent, a \"[[New World]]\".<ref>Vespucci (1503). After leaving Bezeguiche, the mapping expedition would make landfall at [[Cape S\u00e3o Roque]] in August 1501, and proceeded to sail south along the Brazilian coast, possibly as far as the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] coast. They returned to Lisbon before September 1502, perhaps as early as June. A second mapping expedition, this time more certainly under [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], also accompanied by Vespucci (his \"fourth voyage\"), set out for Brazil in April, 1503.</ref>\n\nMid-June, 1501 \u2013 Lemos & Vespucci leave Bezeguiche for Brazil. Shortly after, the pair [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda themselves reach Bezeguiche, where they find Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho awaiting them. Cabral sends Coelho's swift ''Anunciada'' ahead to Lisbon to announce their return, while the remainder rest and wait in Bezeguiche for the remaining two ships.  [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]'s ship (making his way alone from Mossel Bay) and [[Sancho de Tovar]]'s ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (returning from Sofala) arrive in Bezeguiche by the end of June.\n\nJune 23, 1501 \u2013 The ''Anunciada'', commanded by [[Nicolau Coelho]], arrives in Lisbon and anchors in [[Bel\u00e9m]].  (Just as in case of Vasco da Gama's expedition, it turns out Nicolau Coelho is once again the first to deliver the news!)  The merchants of the consortium led by [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] (who own the ''Anunciada'') are delighted.  Letters are immediately fired off throughout Europe announcing the results.\n\nThe news arrives too late for [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd India Armada]], which departed for India in April.  But Nova will collect the necessary information along the way\u2014from the note in Ata\u00edde's shoe in Mossel Bay, and from Cabral's letters in the possession of Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes in Kilwa.\n\nJuly 21, 1501 \u2013 One month after Coelho's arrival, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda, the two larger ships, finally arrive in Lisbon. The other three ships arrive a few days later: Sancho de Tovar and P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde on July 25 and the hapless Diogo Dias, with his empty caravel, on July 27.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bernardelli - Monumento a Cabral.jpg|thumb|180px|Monument to [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in Lisbon, copy of a Brazilian monument by Rodolpho Bernardelli]]\nOn the surface, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral's 2nd Armada had been a failure and the reaction was conspicuously muted.\n\nShip losses were very heavy. Of the thirteen ships sent out, only five returned with cargo (four crown, one private), five were lost at sea, three returned without cargo (Gaspar de Lemos, Lu\u00eds Pires and Diogo Dias).\n\nHuman losses were even more disheartening.  This included all the crews and captains of the four ships lost at the Cape (notably, the celebrated discoverer Bartolomeu Dias).  Another fifty-something Portuguese (including the factor Aires Correia) had been killed in the Calicut massacre.\n\nThen there were the mission failures.  Relative to the instructions given to him in Lisbon, Cabral had failed on nearly every count:\n*1. failed to establish a treaty with the Zamorin of Calicut\u2014indeed, Calicut was now more hostile than ever.\n*2. failed to establish a factory at Calicut (massacred);\n*3. failed to bring the 'Hindu Church' in line (the friars that survived reported the Hindus weren't Christians after all, just 'idolaters');\n*4. failed to make a treaty with Kilwa;\n*5. failed to establish a factory at Sofala (seen from afar by Tovar, but that is all).\n\nOn the other hand, in his defense, Cabral could point to some positive achievements.\n\n*1. opening of friendly relations with Cochin, Canannore and Quilon;\n*2. a factory in Cochin, poorer than Calicut perhaps, but workable;\n*3. discovery of true Christian communities in Cranganore, etc.;\n*4. Sofala was at least discovered and scouted;\n*5. discovery of Brazil, which might serve as a useful staging post for future India runs;\n*6. Diogo Dias's discovery of Madagascar and exploration of the African coast up to Cape Guardafui and the Gulf of Aden was useful information.\n*7. Finally, Cabral did bring back tons of spices, which were off-loaded into the Lisbon warehouses and sold at no small profit for the crown treasury.\n\nHowever, it was the ship and human losses that weighed heavily against Cabral being honored or rewarded. Allegations of 'incompetence' flew easily in the circles that mattered. Although Cabral was initially offered the command of the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th Armada]], scheduled for 1502, it seemed more like a ''pro forma'' gesture than a sincere offer.<ref>Subrahmanyam (1997: p.191)</ref> The crown made it clear that Cabral's command would be limited and supervised \u2013 conditions humiliating enough to force Cabral to withdraw his name.  The 4th Armada would be placed under the command of Vasco da Gama.\n\nAlthough the reaction of Portuguese court opinion in 1501, on Cabral's return, was generally low, it ascended retrospectively.  Cabral's discovery of Brazil, initially received as a minor discovery of little interest, turned out to be much more momentous.  The follow-up Brazilian mapping expeditions of 1501-02 and 1503-04, under the captaincy of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], carrying the Florentine cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], revealed a massive continent - which Vespucci famously labelled a \"[[New World]]\" (''Mundus Novus'').  The plentitude of [[brazilwood]] (''pau-brasil'') discovered by the mapping expeditions on its shores lured the interest of European cloth industry, and led to the 1505 contract granted to [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]] for the commercial exploitation of Brazil. The lucrative brazilwood trade eventually drew competition from French and Spanish interlopers, forcing the Portuguese government to take a more active interest in Cabral's \"[[Name of Brazil|Land of Vera Cruz]]\", finally leading to the establishment of the first Portuguese colonies in [[Colonial Brazil]] in 1532.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Carta de P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]]\n* [[Portuguese India Armadas]]\n* [[Portuguese India]]\n* [[Alternative theory of the European discovery of Brazil]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note |30em}}\n\n== References == \n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n'''Eyewitness Accounts'''\n\n* [Anonymous Pilot] \"Navigationi del Capitano Pedro Alvares Cabral Scrita per un Piloto Portoghese et Tradotta di Lingua Portoghese in Italiana\", first published in Francanzano Montalbado, 1507, editor, ''Paesi novamente retrovati et Novo Mondo da Alberico Vesputio Florentino intitulato'', Vicenza.

Cabral's armada famously discovered [[Brazil]] for the Portuguese crown along the way. By and large, the Second Armada's diplomatic mission to [[India]] failed, and provoked the opening of hostilities between the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the feudal city-state of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]].  Nonetheless, it managed to establish a factory in the nearby [[Kingdom of Cochin]], the first Portuguese [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Asia.\n\n== Fleet ==\n\nThe [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first India Armada]], commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]], arrived in Portugal in the summer of 1499, in rather sorry shape. Half of his ships and men had been lost thanks to battles, disease, and storms. Although Gama came back with a hefty cargo of spices that would be sold at enormous profit, he had failed in the principal objective of his mission: to negotiate a treaty with [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], the spice entrep\u00f4t on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India. Gama managed, however, to open the sea route to India via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and secured good relations with the African city-state of [[Malindi]], a critical staging post along the way.\n\nOn King Manuel I's orders, arrangements were immediately made to begin the assembly of a second armada in [[Cascais]].  Determined not to repeat Gama's mistakes, this one was to be a large and well-armed fleet of 13 ships and 1500 men, laden with valuable gifts and diplomatic letters to win over the potentates of the east.\n\nMany details of the composition of the fleet are missing. Only three ship names are known, and there is some conflict among the sources on the captains.  The following list of ships should not be regarded as authoritative, but as a tentative list compiled from various conflicting accounts.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=5\n|style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Ship Name''' ||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Captain'''||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Notes'''\n|- valign = top\n| 1. uncertain || D.

Oddly, Couto inserts [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in place of Sim\u00e3o de Pina, but subsequently corrects himself.

Cabral had no notable naval or military experience; his appointment as ''capit\u00e3o-mor'' (captain-major) was largely politically motivated.  The exiled [[Crown of Castile|Castillian]] nobleman [[Sancho de Tovar]] was designated vice-admiral (''soto-capit\u00e3o'') and Cabral's successor should anything happen to him.<ref group=note>This is according to Castanheda and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is. Gaspar Correia identifies Sim\u00e3o de Miranda as the predesignated successor instead.</ref>\n\nVeteran pilot [[Pedro Escobar]] was given the overall technical command of the expedition. Other veterans of the first armada included captain Nicolau Coelho, pilot [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]], and clerks Afonso Lopes and [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]].  The famed navigator Bartolomeu Dias, who was the first to double the Cape of Good Hope, and his brother Diogo Dias, who had served as clerk on Gama's ship, also served as captains. \n\nMost of the ships were either [[carracks]] (''naus'') or [[caravels]], and at least one was a small supply ship, although details on names and tonnage are missing.<ref group=note>Castanheda (1551) claims there were ten carracks and three caravels. The Anonymous Pilot refers to only twelve ships, plus a supply ship.</ref>  At least two ships, Cabral's flagship and Tovar's ''El Rei'', were said to be around 240 tons, that is, about twice the size of the largest ship in the first armada three years prior.\n\nTen ships were destined for [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (Malabar, India), while the two ships headed by the Dias brothers were destined for [[Sofala]] in East Africa and the supply ship was destined to be scuttled and burnt along the way.<ref group=note>The Sofala destination of the Dias brothers is found in Castanheda (1551). It is confirmed in the Anonymous Pilot.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro das Armadas).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\n\nAt least two ships were privately owned and outfitted: Lu\u00eds Pires's ship was owned by Diogo da Silva e Meneses, [[Count of Portalegre]], while Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha's ''Anunciada'' was owned by the king's cousin D. [[\u00c1lvaro of Braganza]], and financed by an Italian consortium composed of the Florentine bankers [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] and [[Girolamo Sernigi]] and the Genoese Antonio Salvago. The remainder belonged to the Portuguese crown.\n\nAccompanying the expedition as translator was [[Gaspar da Gama]], who was a Jew captured in Angediva by Vasco Gama, as well as four Hindu hostages from Calicut taken by Gama in 1498 during negotiations. Also aboard was the ambassador of the Sultan of Malindi, who had arrived at Portugal with Gama, and was set to return to Malindi with Cabral's expedition.\n\nOther passengers on the expedition included Aires Correia, the designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut, his secretary P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha, Afonso Furtado, the designated factor for Sofala, and clerk Martinho Neto.  Accompanying them on the trip was the royal physician and amateur astronomer, Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], who brought along the latest astrolabe and new Arabic astronomical staves for navigational experiments.  One chronicler suggests that the knight [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] was also aboard.<ref group=note>[[Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is]] is the chronicler responsible for this claim.  This is not substantiated elsewhere.  Greenlee (1938, p. li) and Diffie and Winius (1977, p. 188fn) dismiss the possibility.</ref>\n\nThe fleet carried some twenty Portuguese ''[[degredado|degredados]]'', who were criminal convicts who could fulfill their sentences by being abandoned along the shores of various places and exploring inland on the crown's behalf. Four of the degredados are known: Afonso Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Machado, Luiz de Moura, and Antonio Fernandes, who was also a ship carpenter. \n\nFinally, the fleet carried eight [[Franciscan]] friars and eight chaplains, under the supervision of the head chaplain, Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra. They were the first Portuguese Christian missionaries to India.\n\nThere are three surviving eyewitness accounts of this expedition: (1) an extended letter written by P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha (possibly dictated by Aires Correia), written from Brazil on May 1, 1500, to King Manuel I; (2) the brief letter by Mestre [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]] to the king, also from Brazil; and (3) the account of an anonymous Portuguese pilot, first published in Italian in 1507 (commonly referred to as the ''Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Piloto An\u00f4nimo'', sometimes believed to be the clerk [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]]).\n\n== Mission ==\n\nThe priority of the mission was to secure a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode), the principal commercial entrep\u00f4t of the [[Kerala]] spice trade and dominant feudal city-state on the [[Malabar coast]] of [[India]]. [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first armada had visited Calicut in 1498, but had failed to impress the elderly ruling Manivikraman Raja ('Samoothiri Raja'), the [[Zamorin of Calicut]]. As such, no agreements had been signed. Cabral's instructions were to succeed where Gama had failed, and to this end was entrusted with magnificent gifts to present to the Zamorin. Cabral was under orders to establish a ''feitoria'' ([[Factory (trading post)|factory]]) in Calicut, which would be placed under Aires Correia.\n\nThe second priority, assigned to Bartolomeu and Diogo Dias, was to search out the East African port of [[Sofala]], near the mouth of the [[Zambezi]] river.<ref>Anonymous Pilot, p. 107</ref> Sofala had been secretly visited and described by the explorer [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]] during his overland expedition a decade earlier (c. 1487), and he identified it as the endpoint of the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade.  The Portuguese crown was eager to tap into that gold source, but Gama's armada had failed to find it.  The Dias brothers were instructed to find and establish a factory at Sofala under designated factor Afonso Furtado.  To this end, the brothers were likely also instructed to secure the consent of [[Kilwa Sultanate|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city-state of the East African coast and putative overlord of Sofala.  \n\nA minor objective included the delivery of a group of [[Franciscan]] missionaries to India. It is said that Vasco da Gama had misinterpreted the [[Hinduism]] he saw practiced in India as a form of \"primitive\" Christianity.  He believed its peculiar characteristics were a result of centuries of separation from the mainstream church in Europe. As such, Gama recommended that missionaries be sent to India to help bring the practices of the \"Hindu church\" up to date with Roman Catholic orthodoxy.  To this end, a group of Franciscan friars, led by Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra, joined the expedition.\n\nAs a final objective, the Second Armada was also a commercial spice run. The crown and private merchants who had outfitted the ships expected full cargoes of spices to return to Lisbon. \n\n=== Suspected Brazilian mission ===\n\nThere has been some debate over whether Cabral also had secret instructions from the king to lay claim to the landmass of Brazil\u2014or, more precisely, to swing as far west as possible to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]] and claim whatever lands or islands might be discovered there for the Portuguese crown, before the Spanish did.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peres |first=Dami\u00e3o |date=1949 |title=O descobrimento do Brasil por Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral: antecedentes e intencionalidade |language=Portuguese}}</ref> Among the pieces of evidence is an indication of an island in the area in a 1448 map of [[Andrea Bianco]], apparently alluded to in the letter of Master Jo\u00e3o Faras; there is also the suggestion by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in his ''Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis'' that he had been sent on an expedition to a western landmass in 1498.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pacheco Pereira |first=Duarte |date=c. 1505 |title=Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis |url=https://archive.org/details/esmeraldodesitu00peregoog/page/n62/mode/2up |chapter=Cap 2: Da cantidade & grandeza da terra, & daugua qual destas he a mayor parte. |language=Portuguese}}</ref> That is about the full extent of the evidence of intentionality and this claim is largely speculative.<ref>{{cite book|last=Greenlee |first=William Brooks |date=1938 |pages=l\u2013lv |title=The Voyage of Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral to Brazil and India: from contemporary documents and narratives |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1409414485}}</ref> There are various reasons to presume the existence of such instructions unlikely.\n\nSpanish explorers had certainly been tending south at that time. Christopher Columbus]had touched the coast of the South American mainland around [[Guyana]] in 1498 on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third trip]]. In late 1499, [[Alonso de Ojeda]] had discovered much of the [[Venezuela|Venezuelan]] coast and in early 1500, [[Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n]] and [[Diego de Lepe]], via generous southerly swings from the [[Canary islands]], had reached at least what is now [[Cear\u00e1]], and perhaps went as far east as [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape of Santo Agostinho]] in [[Pernambuco]]. They had explored much of the northern Brazilian coast west of it. It is possible that the southerly Spanish tendencies were deliberate, aimed at securing more land for the Spanish crown.<ref group=note>Although the person from whom the Spanish crown was trying to claim land was not the king of Portugal, as that was already mediated by Tordesillas, but Christopher Columbus, their own vice-roy of the Indies. Ojeda, Pinz\u00f3n, and Lepe were all dispatched on separate royal capitulations by [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], an enemy of Columbus, with the deliberate intent of finding and claiming lands ''outside'' (i.e., to the south) of the Columbus-owned West Indian islands, thereby circumscribing Columbus's viceroyalty and limiting him to the islands he already had. This would figure in later lawsuits by the Columbus family.</ref>\n\nThese expeditions, however, were too recent for their results to have been known in Lisbon before Cabral's departure in March 1500; indeed, they were unknown in Spain itself. It is very doubtful that the Portuguese were aware of them. Even if they were, it would not seem sensible for Cabral's Second Armada to be instructed to deviate from its original mission in India to pursue exploratory work which be far more efficiently accomplished by smaller caravels. \n\n== Outward journey ==\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu).jpg|thumb|350px|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'']]\nOn March 9, Cabral's expedition set out from the [[Tagus]]. Thirteen days later, on March 22, Cabral's armada reached the island of [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]] in the middle of a storm.  The privately outfitted ship of Lu\u00eds Pires was too damaged by the tempest to continue, and returned to Lisbon<ref>According to Barros (1552, II.5.2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA386#v=onepage&q&f=false p.386]); also Castanheda (1551), G\u00f3is (1566).</ref><ref group=note>Caminha's eyewitness account made no mention of Pires and instead reported that it was the Vasco de Ataide's crown ship that was lost around Cape Verde.</ref>\n\nFrom Cape Verde, Cabral went southwest. It is unknown why he chose such an unusual direction, but the most probable hypothesis is that he was simply following the wide arc in the South Atlantic to catch a favorable wind to carry them to the Cape of Good Hope. Navigationally, the arc is sensible. From Cape Verde, the ship would cut across the [[doldrums]] below the equator, catch the southwest-bound [[South Equatorial Current|equatorial drift]], and turn into the southbound [[Brazil Current]] that will carry them down to the [[horse latitudes]] (30\u00b0S), where the prevailing [[westerlies]] begin.  The westerlies would easily carry the ships across the South Atlantic around the Cape of Good Hope. If instead of this arc, Cabral attempted to strike southeast from Cape Verde, it would go into the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. To reach the Cape from there would be a struggle, as Cabral would have had to sail against the southeasterly [[trade wind|trade winds]], as well as the [[Benguela Current]]. \n\nHow Cabral knew of this arc is unknown. Most likely, this was precisely the route followed by Gama on his first trip in 1497. The veterans of the first fleet\u2014notably the pilots Alenquer and Escobar\u2014would very likely have charted the same route for Cabral again.<ref group=note>That this arc was sailed by Gama in 1497 is uncertain, but most modern historians have come to accept that he did. How did Gama know about the arc when no one had yet sailed it before? Some have speculated that the Portuguese crown might have dispatched secret exploratory expeditions to those waters in advance. The more widely accepted hypothesis, first forwarded by admiral [[Gago Coutinho]], is more straightforward: Since Bartolomeu Dias's 1488 expedition discovered the westerlies, the South Atlantic arc became \"navigationally obvious\" to any sensible pilot, especially pilots as experienced as Alenquer and Escobar. See Gago Coutinho (1951\u201352) ''A Nautica dos Descobrimentos: os descobrimentos maritimos visitos por um navegador'', 2 vols., Lisbon: Agencia Geral do Ultramar.</ref> Indeed, in the Lisbon archives, there is a draft of a document intended for Cabral that instructs him to strike in a southwesterly direction when he reaches the doldrums.<ref>After Cape Verde, where the wind is weak ('vento escasso') the ships should strike in the open ocean arc ('ir na volta do mar'), until the Cape of Good Hope, as this is the shorter route ('a navega\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 mais breve'). See Fonseca (1908, p. 211; see also p.224) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false copy of letter]; see also Greenlee (1938, p. 167)</ref> \n\nAlternative hypotheses forwarded for Cabral striking southwest are that he was trying to reach the [[Azores]] to repair his storm-battered fleet, that he was searching for and rounding up missing tempest-tossed ships, or that it was an intentional attempt to discover if there was any land by the Tordesillas line.\n\n=== Discovery of Brazil ===\n\nCabral took the same path as Gama had, but made a slightly wider arc and went further west than Gama had. As a result, he hit upon the hitherto unknown landmass of Brazil. After nearly 30 days of sailing (44 since departure), on April 21, Cabral's fleet found the first indications of nearby land.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fonseca |first=Faustino da |date=1908 |page=225 |title=A Descoberta to Brasil |language=Portuguese |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Livraria Central de Gomes de Carvalho |place=Lisbon}}</ref> The next day, the armada caught sight of the Brazilian coast, seeing the outlines of a hill they named [[Monte Pascoal]].\n\nThe armada anchored at the mouth of the [[Do Frade River|Frade river]] the next day, and a group of local [[Tupiniquim]] Indians assembled on the beach. Cabral dispatched a small party, headed by Nicolau Coelho, in a longboat ashore to make first contact. Coelho tossed his hat in exchange for a feathered headdress, but the surf was too strong for a proper landing and opening of communication, so they returned to the ships.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fonseca |first=Faustino da |date=1908 |pages=241\u2013242 |title=A Descoberta to Brasil |language=Portuguese |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Livraria Central de Gomes de Carvalho |place=Lisbon}}</ref>\n\nStrong overnight winds prompted the armada to lift anchor and sail some 10 leagues (45&nbsp;km) north, finding harbor behind the reef at Cabr\u00e1lia Bay, just north of [[Porto Seguro]].  The pilot Afonso Lopes, while [[Sounding line|sounding]] in a rowboat, spotted a native canoe, captured the two Indians on board, and brought them back to ship. The language barrier prevented questioning, but they were fed and given cloth and beads. The cultural difference was apparent: The natives spat out their honey and cake and were deeply surprised upon seeing a chicken.<ref>Guia politicamente incorreto da Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil, Leandro Narloch</ref>\n\nThe next day, on April 25, a party led by Coelho and Bartolomeu Dias went ashore, accompanied by the two natives. Armed Tupiniquim warily approached the beach, but upon a signal from the two natives, set down their bows, and allowed the Portuguese to land and collect water.\n\n[[File:Meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The First Mass in Brazil'' by [[Victor Meirelles]] (1861)]]\n\nOn April 26, the Octave of Easter Sunday, the Franciscan friar Henrique Soares of Coimbra went ashore to celebrate mass in front of 200 Tupiniquim Indians.  This is the first known Christian mass on the American mainland.\n\nInteraction between the Portuguese and the Tupiniquim gradually increased throughout the week.  European iron nails, cloth, beads, and crucifixes were traded for American amulets, spears, parrots, and monkeys. There was only the slightest hint that precious metals might be found in the hinterlands. Portuguese ''degredados'' are assigned to spend the night in Tupiniquim villages, while the rest of the crew sleeps aboard ships.\n\n[[File:Carta-caminha.png|thumb|150px|Facsimile of P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha's letter to the king, reporting the discovery of the \"Island of the True Cross\" (Brazil)]]\n\nOn May 1, Cabral makes preparations to resume the journey to India. The Portuguese pilots, assisted by the physician-astronomer Master Jo\u00e3o Faras, determined that Brazil lay east of the Tordesillas line, prompting Cabral to formally claim it for the Portuguese crown, bestowing upon it the name of ''Ilha de Vera Cruz'' (\"Island  of the True Cross\"). It was later renamed ''Terra de Santa Cruz''\u2014\"Land of the Holy Cross\"\u2014upon the realization that it was not an island).<ref group=note>Gaspar Correia ([https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3ALCCN05022145&as_brr=1&pg=PA152#v=onepage&q&f=false p.152]) and Jo\u00e3o de Barros ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA391#v=onepage&q&f=false p.391]) say it was named \"Santa Cruz\" from the start, with Correia saying it was named so because the departure date was the [[Feast of the Cross]] on the liturgical calendar. However, both Caminha's and Mestre Jo\u00e3o's letters are signed as written from \"Vera Cruz\" on May 1.</ref>\n\nOn May 2, Cabral dispatched the supply ship back to [[Lisbon]], with the Brazilian items and a letter to King Manuel I composed by the secretary P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha to announce the discovery.<ref>Anonymous Pilot [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCsOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false p.110]</ref> It also carried a separate private letter to the king from Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], in which he identified the main guiding constellation in the southern hemisphere, the [[Southern Cross]] (''Cruzeiro'').<ref>Some sources claim that the ''Cruzeiro'' constellation had already been identified by [[Alvise Cadamosto]] in the 1450s.</ref> The supply ship arrived in Lisbon in June.\n\nAfter that, with a couple of Portuguese ''degredados'' left beind with the Tupiniquim of Porto Seguro,<ref>Anonymous Pilot [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCsOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false p.110]</ref> Cabral ordered the eleven remaining ships to set sail and continue on their route to India.\n\n=== Crossing to India ===\n\nAfter crossing the Atlantic Ocean, Cabral's armada reached the Cape of Good Hope in late May.  The fleet faced headlong winds for six straight days and four ship\u2014Bartolomeu Dias's, Aires Gomes da Silva's, Sim\u00e3o de Pina's, and Vasco de Ata\u00edde's\u2014are lost at sea in the process.<ref>Castanheda (1551)</ref><ref>Barros (1552)</ref><ref>G\u00f3is (1566)</ref><ref group=note>The ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'' mistakenly substitutes Sim\u00e3o de Miranda for Sim\u00e3o da Pina in the losses, although this is corrected in the marginal gloss. Gaspar Correia (1550) almost concurs\u2014but as he does not have Aires Gomes da Silva on his original captain list, he identifies the fourth ship lost as Gaspar de Lemos. Similarly, the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which has neither Pina nor Gomes da Silva on its list, say it was Diogo de Figueir\u00f3 and Luis Pires who were lost.  Diogo do Couto (c.1600) mistakenly adds P\u00earo d'Ataide to the list, bringing the losses to five. Some scholars also contend that Pires was lost at this point, and Vasco de Ata\u00edde had been lost earlier at Cape Verde.</ref> In this way, the fleet was reduced to seven ships. Facing strong winds, the armada split into smaller groups to meet again on the other side. Cabral's ship went with two others.\n\nOn June 16, 1500, Cabral's three-ship squadron reached the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago|Primeiras Islands]] several leagues north of Sofala.  Two local merchant ships, catching sight of Cabral, took flight. Cabral gave pursuit\u2014one of them runs aground and the other is captured. Upon questioning, it was discovered that these ships were owned by a cousin of the sultan Fateima of Malindi (who had received Vasco da Gama in 1498), so they were released. \n\nThe three ships landed on [[Mozambique Island]] on June 22. Despite the earlier quarrel with his ships, Cabral was given a warm reception by the Sultan of Mozambique and was allowed to collect water and supplies.  Shortly after, three more ships of the Second Armada sailed into the island and joined with Cabral.  Only the ship of Diogo Dias remained missing.  As Dias's mission was for Sofala anyway, Cabral decided not to wait for it and instead pressed on with his fleet of six ships.\n\n[[File:Map of Cabral route, 1500.gif|thumb|340px|Approximate route of outward journey of Cabral's 2nd Armada (also route of stray ship of Diogo Dias)]]\n\nMore than a month later, on July 26, Cabral's armada reached [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], the dominant city-state of the East African coast and which Gama had never visited. Afonso Furtado, who had been appointed factor for Sofala in Lisbon and had escaped death (Furtado had been aboard Bartolomeu Dias's ship, but moved to the flagship just before the Cape crossing), went ashore to open negotiations with the strongman ruler, Emir Ibrahim.<ref group=note>At the time, there was no ruling [[Kilwa Sultanate|Sultan of Kilwa]] as the previous one, al-Fudail, had been deposed in a coup (c. 1495) by his minister, Emir Ibrahim, who had since ruled Kilwa with a vacant throne.</ref>\n\nA meeting was arranged between Cabral and Ibrahim, conducted on a couple of rowboats in the harbor. Cabral presents a letter from King Manuel I proposing a treaty, but Ibrahim was suspicious and remained resistant to the overtures. Cabral, sensing Ibrahim's resistance and worrying that they might miss the monsoon winds to India, broke off the negotiations and sailed on.\n\nPressing north, the Cabral fleet avoided the hostile [[Mombassa]] (''Momba\u00e7a'') and finally reached friendly Malindi (''Melinde'') on August 2.  There, he was well-received by the Sultan of Malindi and dropped off the Malindi ambassador that Gama had taken the previous year.  Leaving behind  two ''degredados'', Lu\u00eds de Moura and Jo\u00e3o Machado, and picking up two Gujarati pilots, Cabral's six-ship armada finally began its Indian Ocean crossing on August 7, 1500.\n\n== Cabral in India ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\nAugust 22, 1500 \u2013 After an uneventful ocean crossing, Cabral's six ships land in [[Anjediva Island]] (''Angediva'', Anjadip), where they rest and recuperate, repair and repaint the ships.\n\nSeptember 13, 1500 \u2013 Sailing down the Indian coast, Cabral's expedition finally reaches at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode, the capital of the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] kingdom of same name ruled by Zamorins, or Nediyuiruppu Swarupam). Gaily decorated native boats come out to greet them, but remembering Gama's experience, Cabral refuses to go ashore until hostages are exchanged.  He dispatches Afonso Furtado and the four Calicut hostages taken by Gama the previous year, to negotiate the details of the landing. This eventually done, Cabral finally goes ashore himself and meets new [[Zamorin]] of Calicut (the wary old Zamorin that Gama had met, had recently died). The Portuguese are better-prepared this time\u2014Cabral presents the young Zamorin with much finer and more luxurious gifts than Gama had brought, and more respectful and personalized letters of address from King [[Manuel I of Portugal]].\n\nA commercial treaty is successfully negotiated, and the Zamorin gives Cabral a security-of-trade certificate etched on a silver plate. The Portuguese are allowed to establish a ''[[Factory (trading post)|feitoria]]'' in Calicut and Aires Correia, the designated factor for Calicut, goes ashore with some 70 men. Once the factory is set up, Cabral releases the ship hostages as a sign of trust. Correia immediately sets about buying spices in Calicut's markets for the ships to take home.\n\nOctober (?), 1500 \u2013 Not long after, the Zamorin of Calicut dispatches a service request to Cabral's idling fleet. Arab merchants allied with rival city-state of [[Cochin kingdom]] are returning from [[Ceylon]] with a cargo of [[war elephants]] destined for the Sultan of [[Cambay]] (Khambhat, Gujarat).  Claiming it to be illegal contraband (and the Zamorin could probably use the elephants himself), Cabral is asked if he can intercept them.  Cabral sends one of his caravels, brimming with cannon, under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]] (nicknamed 'Inferno'), to capture it.  Hoping for a spectacle, the Zamorin himself comes down to the beachfront to witness the engagement, but leaves in disgust when the Arab ship deftly slips past Ataide.  But Ata\u00edde gives chase and eventually catches up with it near [[Kannur|Cannanore]] and successfully seizes the vessel.  Cabral presents the captured ship, with its nearly intact elephant cargo (one pachyderm was killed in the engagement), to the Zamorin as a gift.\n\n=== Calicut Massacre ===\n\nDecember 1500 \u2013 After two months of operation, factor Aires Correia has only been able to buy enough spices to load two of the ships. He complains to Cabral his suspicions that the [[guild]] of Arab merchants in Calicut have been [[collusion|colluding]] to shut out Portuguese purchasing agents from the city's spice markets which is not unlikely. Arab traders had reportedly used similar collusive tactics to drive out Chinese merchants earlier in the 15th century from various ports on the [[Malabar Coast]]. It would make sense if they tried doing so again\u2014particularly as the Portuguese had arrived trumpeting their hatred of 'the Moors' and demanding trading privileges and preferences, a clear danger to their own trade.\n\nHistorians cite murkier elements to this, in particular, that the Portuguese traders might have been unwitting counters in on-going quarrels between competing older and newer Arab merchant guilds in Calicut and or used as pawns in the personal power struggles among the Zamorin's leading advisors, etc. There were certainly more dimensions to this affair, the full details of which will likely never be clearly known.\n\nCabral presents the complaint to the Zamorin, and requests that he crack down on the Arab merchant guild or enforce Portuguese priority in the spice markets.  But the Zamorin refuses to intervene in the matter\u2014or rather makes only some vague promises, but disdains to get actively involved in the matter, as Cabral demands.\n\nDecember 17, 1500 \u2013 Frustrated by the Zamorin's inaction, Cabral decides to take matters into his own hands.  On the advice of Aires Correia, Cabral orders the seizure of an Arab merchant ship from [[Jeddah]], then loading up with spices in Calicut harbor, claiming that as the Zamorin had promised the Portuguese priority in the spice markets, the cargo is rightfully theirs.  Incensed, the Arab merchants around the quay immediately raise a riot in Calicut and direct mobs to attack the Portuguese factory.  The Portuguese ships, anchored out in the harbor and unable to approach the docks, helplessly watch the unfolding massacre.  After three hours of fighting, some 53 (some say 70) Portuguese are slaughtered by the mobs\u2014including the factor Aires Correia, the secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], and three (some say five) of the Franciscan friars.  Around twenty Portuguese then in the city manage to escape the riot by jumping into the harbor waters and swimming to the ships.  The survivors report to Cabral that the Zamorin's own [[Hindu]] guards were seen either standing aside or actively helping the rioters.\n\nAt least one Portuguese, a man called Gon\u00e7alo Peixoto, survived the massacre, sheltered from the mob by a local merchant (whom the chronicles call \"Coja Bequij\").  In the aftermath, the wares in the Portuguese factory are impounded by the Calicut authorities.\n\n=== War with Calicut ===\n\nDecember 18\u201322, 1500 \u2013 Incensed at the attack on the factory, Cabral waits one day for redress by the Zamorin.  When this is not forthcoming, Cabral takes his revenge. The Portuguese seize around ten Arab merchant ships then in harbor, confiscating their cargoes, killing their crews, and burning their ships.  Then, accusing the Zamorin of sanctioning the riot, Cabral orders a full day [[shore bombardment]] of Calicut, doing immense damage to the unfortified city (estimates of Calicut casualties reach up to 600). Cabral proceeds to also bomb the nearby Zamorin-owned port of Pandarane (Pantalayani Kollam, near present-day [[Koyilandy]]) as well.<ref>The port of ''Pandarane'' has since vanished.  Its location is usually identified as 'Pantalyini Kollam', a port that has since been annexed by the growing city of [[Koyilandy]]; it is also sometimes identified with modern [[Kappad]]. (Dames, 1918: p.85)</ref>\n\nThus opened the war between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Zamorin of Calicut.  The war will drag on for the next decade.  Future [[Portuguese India Armadas]] have to contend with this conflict, it will dictate Portuguese strategy in the Indian Ocean and draw in other participants.  The conflict will also overturn the political order on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India, and shape a different future for [[Kerala]].\n\n=== Alliance with Cochin kingdom ===\n\n[[File:Kerala cities at time of Cabral (1500).gif|thumb|250px|India [[Malabar Coast]] c. 1500]]\nDecember 24, 1500 \u2013 Cabral leaves smoldering Calicut, unsure of what to do next. At the suggestion of [[Gaspar da Gama]] (the Goese Jew who had been accompanying the expedition), Cabral sets sail south along the coast towards [[Cochin kingdom]] (''Cochim'', Kochi or Perumpadappu Swarupam), a small [[Hindu]] [[Nair]] city-state at the outlet of the [[brackish]] [[Vembanad Lake|Vembanad]] lagoon in the Kerala backwaters. Half-in-vassalage and half-at-war with Zamorin's Calicut, Cochin kingdom had long chafed at the dominance of its larger neighbor and was looking for an opportunity to break away.\n\nArriving in Cochin, a Portuguese emissary, accompanied by a [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christian]] picked up in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], are set ashore to make contact with the Trimumpara Raja (Unni Goda Varma), the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] prince of [[Cochin kingdom]].<ref>The exact status of the 'Trimumpara Raja', the ruling prince of Cochin, is a bit unclear.  It seems the formal ruler of Cochin was the king of [[Edapalli]], across the lagoon on the mainland, that the Cochinese peninsula (with capital at [[Perumpadappu (Malappuram district)|Perumpadappu]]) had at some point been detached as an appanage for a son, who, in turn, had detached the northern tip, Cochin proper, for another son.  Moreover, it seems these appanages were not supposed to be permanent fiefs, but rather to serve as temporary 'training' grounds for princely heirs before they moved up in succession order.  In other words, the ruler of Cochin was the second heir of Edapalli.  Upon the death of the ruler of Edapalli, the first heir was supposed to leave the peninsula and take up his duties in Edapalli, and the second heir move from Cochin to Perumpadappu, and assign Cochin to his own successor (the new second heir). It seems the Portuguese arrived at a time when the princely heirs were somewhat at odds with each other\u2014possibly because of some violation in the rules of succession, or simply because the ruler of Cochin was tired of waiting for his turn. It is only  under Portuguese protection that the rulers of Cochin finally became proper kings in their own right.  Thus, the Raja Trimumpara's search for a Portuguese alliance have more to do with his own family quarrels than with the exactions of the Zamorin of Calicut.  See Dames (1918: p.86n).</ref> The Portuguese are greeted warmly\u2014the bombardment of hated Zamorin's Calicut outweighing the earlier matter of the war elephants.  All the cordialities and hostage-swapping quickly fulfilled, Cabral himself goes ashore and negotiates a treaty of alliance between Portugal and Cochin kingdom, directed against Zamorin's Calicut. Cabral promises to make the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin the ruler of kingdom of Calicut, upon the city's capture.\n\nA Portuguese factory is set up in Cochin, with Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa as chief factor (the pre-designated Aires Correia having perished in the Calicut Massacre). A smaller, poorer city, the spice markets of Cochin are not nearly as well supplied as Calicut, but the trade is good enough to begin loading ships.  The stay in Cochin is not without incident\u2014the factory is set ablaze one evening (probably at the instigation of Arab traders in the city), but the Trimumpara Raja will not countenance a repeat of the events of Calicut.  He cracks down on the arsonists, takes the Portuguese under his protection (the factors stay in his palace), and assigns his personal [[Nair]] guards to escort the Portuguese factors in the city's markets and protect the factory against any further incidents.\n\nEarly January 1501 \u2013 While in Cochin, Cabral receives missives from the rulers of [[Kannur|Cannanore]] (''Canonor'', Kannur or Kolathunad, further north, another of Calicut's reluctant rivals) and [[Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam or Venad Swarupam, further south, once a great Syrian Christian merchant city-state, entrepot for cinnamon, ginger and dyewood).  They commend Cabral's actions against Zamorin's Calicut, and invite the Portuguese to trade in their cities instead. Not wishing to offend his gracious Cochinese host, Cabral politely declines the invitations, promising only to visit those cities at some future date.\n\nWhile still at Cochin, Cabral receives yet another invitation, this one from nearby [[Kodungallur Kovilakam|Cranganore kingdom]] (''Cranganor'', Kodungallur). Once a great city on the northern end of the Vembanad lagoon, capital of the [[Chera dynasty]] of [[Sangam period]], Cranganore had since fallen on hard times.  Mother nature delivered Cranganore two severe blows\u2014silting up the channels that connected Cranganore to the waterways, and breaking open a competing sea outlet by Cochin in the 14th century.<ref>Cochin was originally just a village along a long embankment.  Violent overflows of the [[Periyar River]] in 1341 forced the opening of the outlet between the Vembanad lagoon and the Arabian Sea at the juncture where Cochin now sits, separating the long Cochinese peninsula from what is now [[Vypin]] island. See Hunter's ''Imperial Gazetteer'' (1908: p.360).</ref> Cochin's rise had been principally due to the re-routing of commercial traffic away from Cranganore. Nonetheless, the remaining merchants of the dwindling city still maintained their old connections to the Kerala pepper plantations in the interior. Finding the supply in Cochin running low, Cabral takes up the offer to top up their cargo at Cranganore.\n\nThe visit to Cranganore turns out to be an eye-opener for the Portuguese, for among the city's remaining inhabitants are substantial established communities of [[Cochin Jews|Malabari Jews]] and [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christians]].  The encounter with a clearly recognizable Christian community in Kerala confirms to Cabral what the Franciscan friars had already suspected back in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]\u2014namely, that Vasco da Gama's earlier hypothesis about a 'Hindu Church' was mistaken. If real Christians have existed alongside Hindus in India for centuries, then clearly [[Hinduism]] must be a distinct and separate religion, 'heathen idolaters', as the Portuguese friars characterized them, rather than a 'primitive' form of Christianity.  Two Syrian Christian priests from Cranganore apply to Cabral for passage to Europe (one of them, known as Jos\u00e9 de Cranganore or Joseph the Indian (''Josephus Indus''), will provide instrumental intelligence about India to the Portuguese.<ref>Upon arrival in Lisbon, Joseph the Indian spent a couple of years being intensely interviewed by the Portuguese court and the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], relating to them his detailed knowledge of the history and geography of India and points east, expanding Portuguese intelligence dramatically.  It is likely that the detailed depiction of the east Indian coast and the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 is owed in large part to Joseph's information.  Around 1503, Joseph proceeded to Rome to meet [[Pope Alexander VI]] and report on the condition of the Malabari [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christian]] church.  It was on this trip that Joseph dictated his famous narrative on India to an Italian scribe, which was eventually published in 1507 (in Italian) as part of a collection, ''Paesi Novamente Retrovati'', edited by Fracanzio da Montalboddo.  The narrative includes Joseph's own account of Cabral's expedition.  See Vallavanthara (2001).</ref>\n\nJanuary 16, 1501 \u2013 News arrives that the Zamorin of Calicut had assembled and dispatched a fleet of around 80 boats against the Portuguese in Cochin.  Despite the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin's offer of military assistance against the Calicut fleet, Cabral decides to precipitously lift anchor and slip away rather than risk a confrontation.  Cabral's armada leave behind the factor Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa and six assistants in Cochin.  In their hasty departure, the Portuguese inadvertently take along two of the Trimumpara's officers (Idikkela Menon and Parangoda Mennon), who had been serving as noble hostages aboard the vessels.\n\nHeading north, Cabral's armada takes a wide sweep to avoid Calicut, and pays a quick visit to [[Kannur|Cannanore]].  Cabral is warmly received by the [[Kolathiri]] Raja of Cannanore who, eager for a Portuguese alliance, offers to sell the Portuguese spices on credit. Cabral accepts the cargo but pays him nonetheless (not a splendid cargo\u2014only low-quality ginger, as it turns out, but Cabral is appreciative of the gesture.)\n\nHis ships now filled with spices, Cabral decides not to visit [[Quilon]], as he had earlier promised, but to make way back home to Portugal.\n\n== Diogo Dias' misadventures ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nWhile Cabral's main fleet was in India, [[Diogo Dias]], captain of the missing seventh ship of the armada, was going through his own set of adventures.\n\n[[File:Detail of Diogo Dias's ship (Cabral Armada).jpg|thumb|180px|Ship of [[Diogo Dias]], detail from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\nShortly after being separated from the main fleet at the Cape in June 1500, Dias had struck out too far east into the Indian Ocean and sighted the western coast of the island of [[Madagascar]].  Although the island was not unknown (its Arab name, \"island of the Moon\", was already reported by [[Pero de Covilha|Covilh\u00e3]]), Diogo Dias was the first Portuguese captain to have sighted it and is often credited with renaming it the island of ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o'', on account of it being found on [[St. Lawrence]]'s day (August 10, 1500).  However, a proper landing on Madagascar would not be undertaken until 1506 and it would only be extensively explored in 1508.\n\nProbably thinking he was on a South African island, Diogo Dias tried to find the African coast by sailing straight north from Madagascar, hoping to reconnect with Cabral's armada there, or at least to make it to [[Sofala]] (Dias's formal destination).  But to no avail.  He had struck too far east, and was heading along north in open ocean.  Dias sighted the African coast only around [[Mogadishu]] (''Magadoxo''). By this time, Cabral had already crossed the Indian Ocean, and the change in the monsoon winds prevented Dias from undertaking his own crossing. Dias pushed up the coast, unexpectedly going past [[Cape Guardafui]] into the [[Gulf of Aden]], waters as yet unsailed by Portuguese ships.  Dias spent the next few months in the area\u2014trapped by contrary winds, battered by tempests, attacked by Arab pirates, and forced aground on the [[Eritrea]]n coast, in a desperate search for water and food.\n\nDias eventually (in late 1500 and early 1501) managed to procure supplies, repair his ship and catch a favorable wind to take him out of that harrowing trap.  With his remaining six crewmen, Dias set sail back to Portugal, hoping to catch Cabral's armada on the return journey.\n\n== Return journey ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nLate January, 1501 \u2013 Cabral takes aboard an ambassador from Cannanore, and starts his ocean crossing back to East Africa.  On the way, the Portuguese capture a  Gujarati ship, replete with a magnificent cargo.  They steal the cargo, but spare the crew, once they realize they are not Arabs.\n\nFebruary, 1501 \u2013 As Cabral's expedition approaches [[Malindi]], vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]], sailing at the front, runs his spice-laden ship, the ''El Rei'', aground on the Malindi coast.  Irreparable, the great ship is burnt (to recover the iron fittings) and the crews and the cargo reallocated.  Cabral's armada is now reduced to five ships. Cabral authorizes the king of Malindi to recover the cannons from the ''El Rei'' wreck and keep them for himself.\n\nSpring, 1501 \u2013 Cabral's fleet reaches [[Mozambique Island]].  As there is no sign or news from [[Diogo Dias]] awaiting him, Cabral realizes he must take responsibility for the Sofala mission himself.  Cabral orders the private ship ''Anunciada'' of Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha, the fastest in the fleet, to be placed under the command of veteran hand [[Nicolau Coelho]], and dispatched ahead of the rest of the fleet and deliver the results of the voyage to Portugal.  Vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]] (who had lost the ''El-Rei'') is given the chance to make amends by taking command of the caravel ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (hitherto commanded by [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]) and seek out Sofala and to proceed home alone from there.  Ata\u00edde is transferred to the command of Coelho's old nau.\n\nIn the meantime, Cabral lands a ''[[degredado]]'' Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes on the African coast, with letters of instruction for Diogo Dias and any passing Portuguese expeditions, informing them of the dramatic turn of events in India, and warning them to avoid Calicut.\n\n[It is uncertain exactly where Cabral left Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes or where he was ordered to go.  According to Ata\u00edde, Fernandes was ordered to go to Mombassa (odd, as Mombassa was then on hostile terms with the Portuguese); others suggest he was supposed to go to Kilwa (which is where the 3rd Armada of [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]] will find him). Others have speculated that Fernandes was left in Kilwa on the outward leg, and that Cabral's letters were dispatched to him by a local messenger from Mozambique on the return.  Another possibility is that Fernandes was instructed to make his way to Sofala overland, meet Tovar's ship there, and then proceed to explore inland from there to locate [[Monomatapa]] (but then why give him the letters?).  Finally, some conjecture Fernandes is being confused with another degredado, Jo\u00e3o Machado, who had been left in Malindi on the first leg, that he was picked up on the return, and now sent back once again with the letters.]\n\nMarch\u2013April, 1501 \u2013 Matters settled, Cabral takes the remaining three ships\u2014his own flagship, the large nau of Sim\u00e3o de Miranda and Coelho's ship (now under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]])\u2014and sets sail out of Mozambique island.\n\nAta\u00edde gets separated from the other two in the [[Mozambique Channel]] soon after departure. He hurries to S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s ([[Mossel Bay]], South Africa), hoping to find Cabral there waiting for him.  But he is out of luck\u2014Cabral and Miranda had decided to proceed on together towards Lisbon without him.  Not finding any trace of the others, Ata\u00edde decides to make his way home on his own, leaving behind a letter in a boot by a local watering hole giving an account of the expedition (Ataide's note will be found later that year by [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd Armada]]).\n\nIn the meantime, Sancho de Tovar, aboard the ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', finally sights [[Sofala]], the entrepot of Monomatapa gold.  He doesn't go ashore, and instead contents himself with scouting the city from his ship, and then sets sail back home alone.\n\n=== Conference at Bezeguiche ===\n\nJune 2, 1501 \u2013 Following up on the discovery of Brazil the previous year, King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] had assembled a small exploratory expedition of three caravels under an unnamed Portuguese captain, and carrying the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] aboard, to explore and map the coast of Brazil.  The exact identity of the captain is uncertain - some speculate it to be [[Gaspar de Lemos]] or [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]], whichever of the two had commanded the supply vessel that had delivered the news in June 1500; others conjecture Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves went merely as passengers, and that the expedition itself was commanded by [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]].<ref>[[Amerigo Vespucci]] wrote two detailed accounts of this Brazilian mapping expedition - in ''Mundus Novus'' (pub. 1502/03) and as the \"third voyage\" in ''Lettera a Soderini'' (pub.1504/05) - but does not identify the Portuguese captain by name in either.  Chronicler [[Gaspar Correia]], writing a half-century later, identifies the mapping captain as the same captain who steered the returning supply ship - ergo the Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves identification.  Greenlee (1945) suggests the captain was [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]], although this has been dismissed by others (e.g. Roukema, 1963).  More recently, historians have drawn attention to a nautical chart by [[Vesconte de Maggiolo]], which identifies the Brazilian landmass with the label ''Tera de Gonsalvo Coigo Vocatur Santa Cruz'' (translated as \"Land of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] called Santa Cruz\").  [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] is known to have led a later expedition to Brazil (which set out in 1503), but it is commonly estimated that Coelho was still out at sea when Maggiolo composed his chart (c. 1504-05), thereby suggesting Coelho might have also captained the previous 1501 mapping expedition as well. (Morison, 1974, vol. 2, p.281)</ref> Setting out from Lisbon in May 1501, the little Brazilian mapping expedition made a watering stop in early June at ''Bezeguiche'' (as the bay of [[Dakar]] (Senegal) was known to the Portuguese sailors of the time) and stumbles upon  [[Diogo Dias]] cooling his heels there. Dias relates to the Portuguese captain and Vespucci the tales of his misadventures\u2014how he had been separated from Cabral at the Cape, how he had ventured up to the Gulf of Aden, and, finding no trace of Cabral on his return, decided to wait for him in Bezeguiche. Just two days later, the lead ship of the returning India fleet\u2014the ''Anunciada'' under [[Nicolau Coelho]]\u2014sails into Bezeguiche, surprised to find both Dias and the Brazilian mapping expedition there (apparently  Bezeguiche must have been a pre-arranged point of encounter for the Second Armada).\n\nFor the next two weeks, the captains and crews of the different ships exchange tales of their travels and adventures.  It has been since speculated that it was during this time that Amerigo Vespucci came up with his \"[[New World]]\" hypothesis.  After all, Vespucci was quite familiar with the Americas, having participated in [[Alonso de Ojeda|Ojeda]]'s 1499 expedition to the coasts of South America, and it is said he had intense discussions at Bezeguiche with [[Gaspar da Gama]], the Goese Jew aboard Coelho's ship, undoubtedly the person most familiar with the East Indies. Comparing notes, it probably dawned on Vespucci that it was simply impossible to square what he knew of the Americas with what the men of the 2nd Armada knew of Asia.  While still at Bezeguiche, Vespucci wrote a letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463\u20131503)|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], relating his encounter, which he sends back with some Florentine passengers on the ''Anunciada''.<ref>Vespucci's 1501 letter is reproduced in Varnhagen (1865).   An English translation can be found in W.H.Greenlee (1938: p.152ff).</ref>  This was a prelude to an even more famous letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo in 1503, shortly after his return, where he finally asserts that the Brazilian landmass was in fact a continent, that the lands discovered to the west were definitely not part of Asia, but must be an entirely different continent, a \"[[New World]]\".<ref>Vespucci (1503). After leaving Bezeguiche, the mapping expedition would make landfall at [[Cape S\u00e3o Roque]] in August 1501, and proceeded to sail south along the Brazilian coast, possibly as far as the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] coast. They returned to Lisbon before September 1502, perhaps as early as June. A second mapping expedition, this time more certainly under [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], also accompanied by Vespucci (his \"fourth voyage\"), set out for Brazil in April, 1503.</ref>\n\nMid-June, 1501 \u2013 Lemos & Vespucci leave Bezeguiche for Brazil. Shortly after, the pair [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda themselves reach Bezeguiche, where they find Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho awaiting them. Cabral sends Coelho's swift ''Anunciada'' ahead to Lisbon to announce their return, while the remainder rest and wait in Bezeguiche for the remaining two ships.  [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]'s ship (making his way alone from Mossel Bay) and [[Sancho de Tovar]]'s ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (returning from Sofala) arrive in Bezeguiche by the end of June.\n\nJune 23, 1501 \u2013 The ''Anunciada'', commanded by [[Nicolau Coelho]], arrives in Lisbon and anchors in [[Bel\u00e9m]].  (Just as in case of Vasco da Gama's expedition, it turns out Nicolau Coelho is once again the first to deliver the news!)  The merchants of the consortium led by [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] (who own the ''Anunciada'') are delighted.  Letters are immediately fired off throughout Europe announcing the results.\n\nThe news arrives too late for [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd India Armada]], which departed for India in April.  But Nova will collect the necessary information along the way\u2014from the note in Ata\u00edde's shoe in Mossel Bay, and from Cabral's letters in the possession of Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes in Kilwa.\n\nJuly 21, 1501 \u2013 One month after Coelho's arrival, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda, the two larger ships, finally arrive in Lisbon. The other three ships arrive a few days later: Sancho de Tovar and P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde on July 25 and the hapless Diogo Dias, with his empty caravel, on July 27.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bernardelli - Monumento a Cabral.jpg|thumb|180px|Monument to [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in Lisbon, copy of a Brazilian monument by Rodolpho Bernardelli]]\nOn the surface, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral's 2nd Armada had been a failure and the reaction was conspicuously muted.\n\nShip losses were very heavy. Of the thirteen ships sent out, only five returned with cargo (four crown, one private), five were lost at sea, three returned without cargo (Gaspar de Lemos, Lu\u00eds Pires and Diogo Dias).\n\nHuman losses were even more disheartening.  This included all the crews and captains of the four ships lost at the Cape (notably, the celebrated discoverer Bartolomeu Dias).  Another fifty-something Portuguese (including the factor Aires Correia) had been killed in the Calicut massacre.\n\nThen there were the mission failures.  Relative to the instructions given to him in Lisbon, Cabral had failed on nearly every count:\n*1. failed to establish a treaty with the Zamorin of Calicut\u2014indeed, Calicut was now more hostile than ever.\n*2. failed to establish a factory at Calicut (massacred);\n*3. failed to bring the 'Hindu Church' in line (the friars that survived reported the Hindus weren't Christians after all, just 'idolaters');\n*4. failed to make a treaty with Kilwa;\n*5. failed to establish a factory at Sofala (seen from afar by Tovar, but that is all).\n\nOn the other hand, in his defense, Cabral could point to some positive achievements.\n\n*1. opening of friendly relations with Cochin, Canannore and Quilon;\n*2. a factory in Cochin, poorer than Calicut perhaps, but workable;\n*3. discovery of true Christian communities in Cranganore, etc.;\n*4. Sofala was at least discovered and scouted;\n*5. discovery of Brazil, which might serve as a useful staging post for future India runs;\n*6. Diogo Dias's discovery of Madagascar and exploration of the African coast up to Cape Guardafui and the Gulf of Aden was useful information.\n*7. Finally, Cabral did bring back tons of spices, which were off-loaded into the Lisbon warehouses and sold at no small profit for the crown treasury.\n\nHowever, it was the ship and human losses that weighed heavily against Cabral being honored or rewarded. Allegations of 'incompetence' flew easily in the circles that mattered. Although Cabral was initially offered the command of the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th Armada]], scheduled for 1502, it seemed more like a ''pro forma'' gesture than a sincere offer.<ref>Subrahmanyam (1997: p.191)</ref> The crown made it clear that Cabral's command would be limited and supervised \u2013 conditions humiliating enough to force Cabral to withdraw his name.  The 4th Armada would be placed under the command of Vasco da Gama.\n\nAlthough the reaction of Portuguese court opinion in 1501, on Cabral's return, was generally low, it ascended retrospectively.  Cabral's discovery of Brazil, initially received as a minor discovery of little interest, turned out to be much more momentous.  The follow-up Brazilian mapping expeditions of 1501-02 and 1503-04, under the captaincy of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], carrying the Florentine cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], revealed a massive continent - which Vespucci famously labelled a \"[[New World]]\" (''Mundus Novus'').  The plentitude of [[brazilwood]] (''pau-brasil'') discovered by the mapping expeditions on its shores lured the interest of European cloth industry, and led to the 1505 contract granted to [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]] for the commercial exploitation of Brazil. The lucrative brazilwood trade eventually drew competition from French and Spanish interlopers, forcing the Portuguese government to take a more active interest in Cabral's \"[[Name of Brazil|Land of Vera Cruz]]\", finally leading to the establishment of the first Portuguese colonies in [[Colonial Brazil]] in 1532.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Carta de P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]]\n* [[Portuguese India Armadas]]\n* [[Portuguese India]]\n* [[Alternative theory of the European discovery of Brazil]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note |30em}}\n\n== References == \n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n'''Eyewitness Accounts'''\n\n* [Anonymous Pilot] \"Navigationi del Capitano Pedro Alvares Cabral Scrita per un Piloto Portoghese et Tradotta di Lingua Portoghese in Italiana\", first published in Francanzano Montalbado, 1507, editor, ''Paesi novamente retrovati et Novo Mondo da Alberico Vesputio Florentino intitulato'', Vicenza.

{"title_page": "Swimming stroke", "text_new": "[[Human swimming]] typically consists of repeating a specific body motion or '''swimming stroke '''to propel that body forward.  There are many kinds of strokes, each defining a different '''swimming style''' or '''crawl'''.\n\nIn high school, collegiate, and Olympic swimming, there are two [[undulating]] strokes (breaststroke, and butterfly stroke,) and two alternating strokes (front crawl and backstroke).\n\nMost strokes involve rhythmic and coordinated movements of all major body parts \u2014 torso, arms, legs, hands, feet, and head.  Breathing typically must be synchronized with the strokes, too.  It is possible, however, to swim by moving only legs without arms or only arms without legs; such strokes may be used for special purposes, for training or exercise, or by [[amputation|amputees]] (paralympians) and [[paralysis|paralytics]].\n\n==Swimming styles==\n\n* [[Front crawl]]: the fastest style for swimming on the surface. Done while face down. The arms alternate while the legs perform a flutter kick.\n** Dolphin crawl: Similar to front crawl, but with a [[dolphin kick]]. One kick per arm or two kicks per cycle. This style is often used in training.\n** Catch up stroke: A variation of the front crawl where one arm always rests at the front while the other arm performs one cycle. This can also be used as a drill when training in competitive swimming.\n** Head-high crawl (also known as the water polo stroke, lifeguard approach stroke, or Tarzan drill):  This stroke is used for [[water polo]], lifeguards to keep the victim in sight, or those who simply want to see where they're going and breathe with ease. It is similar to front crawl, but with head above the water.  This can also be used as a drill when training in competitive swimming.\n* [[Trudgen]]: The trudgen is similar to the front crawl, except that it is paired with a [[Sidestroke|scissors kick]], similar to that used in the sidestroke.\n** Trudgen crawl: Similar to the trudgen, but with the use of a flutter kick (up and down leg kick) between the scissor kicks.\n** Double trudgen: Similar to the trudgen, but the sides of the scissors kick alternate.\n** Double trudgen crawl: Similar to the double trudgen, but with a flutter kick between the scissors kick alternate.\n* [[Butterfly stroke]]: performed face down in the water. The legs perform a dolphin kick and while the arms move in a forward circle at the same time.\n** Slow butterfly (also known as \"moth stroke\"): Similar to butterfly, but with an extended gliding phase, Breathing during the pull/push phase, return head into the water during recovery. This style uses two kicks per cycle.\n* [[Breaststroke]]: performed face down in the water without rotating the torso. The arms stay in the water and move synchronously, while the legs perform a whip kick. It is possible to keep the head elevated out of the water throughout the stroke, although the head usually dips in and out.\n** Inverted breaststroke: Similar to elementary backstroke, but with a breaststroke kick and arm motions.\n* [[Backstroke]]: Done while lying on the back.  One arm reaches behind the head with a fingertip entry while the other arm is by the side.  The legs perform a flutter kick.\n** Elementary backstroke: Both arms move synchronized (They begin out like an airplane, then go beside the body like a soldier then they run up the sides and back out to an airplane position) with whip kick (breaststroke kick).\n** Inverted butterfly: Similar to elementary backstroke, but with a dolphin kick. This is often used for training.\n** Back double trudgen: Similar to the backstroke, but with a scissors kick to alternating sides.\n**Old English Backstroke : Lying on back, breaststroke legs and butterfly arms\n* [[Backstroke|Forward backstroke]]: Done  lying on back and floating. Arms parallel to the surface, moving in the opposite direction  to backstroke. \n* [[Sidestroke]]: On the side, pull the water as if with a rope with arms going out and stopping in the middle while ensuring that the strokes are most hydrodynamic when moving towards the desired location, and pushing the most water when moving away from the location. In addition, the legs are performing a scissors kick, which is like breaststroke kick, but sideways.\n** Lifesaving stroke: Similar to the [[sidestroke|side stroke]], but only the bottom arm moves while the top arm tows a swimmer in distress.\n** [[Combat sidestroke]]: This stroke was developed and used by the [[United States Navy SEALs]] and is designed to be more efficient and reduce profile in the water.\n* [[Combat sidestroke|Composite stroke]] is drill stroke within one basic stroke, ''ins'' (for example, Front crawl flutter/scissor Dolphin/Dolphin flutter) or between two basic stroke, ''weens'' (Over arm 1 Arm Lead Sidestroke to 2 Arms Lead Dolphin). It is great strength and effort training technique.\n* [[Dog paddle]]: face over water and paddling with alternate hands, often with the nose and mouth above the water. This stroke can be used in reverse to propel the body feet first.\n** Human stroke: Similar to the dog paddle, but the arms reach out more and pull farther down.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n* Survival travel stroke: Alternating underwater arm stroke, one cycle for propulsion, one for a lift to stay on the surface. This style is slow but sustainable.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n* Breast feet first strokes: With legs extended, use the arms with a pushing, flapping, clapping or uplifting motion.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n* [[Snorkeling]]: Swimming on the breast using a snorkel, usually in combination with masks and fins. Any stroke on the breast can be used, and there is no need to lift or turn the head for breathing.\n* [[Finswimming]] is the progression of a swimmer using fins either on the water surface or underwater. Finswimming is usually done on the breast.\n* An arm and a leg: is the progression of a swimmer clasping one leg with the opposite arm, and using breaststroke movements with the remaining arm and leg.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n* Flutter back finning: Symmetrically underwater arm recovery with flutter kick.\n* Flicker kick: Concerning human morphology oscillatory [[flutter kick]] is more suitable, hence all swimming techniques exert vertical oscillation with upward propelling. Flicker kick, as vibration of both, hands and legs, with slight deviation of arms within regular undulation will produce powerful horizontal dynamics. Swimmer by propelling is not just vibrating, this is proved to be insufficient, but rather producing undulating waves (horizontal instead of vertical). The initial move is made by shoulders gliding backward and curve. Meandering is transmitted to the hips and legs. Undulation is most pronounced between the shoulders and thighs. At the end of swimming cycle, legs produce flicker kick as collateral to undulatory movement. See also eel stroke. \n* Feet first swimming: A very slow stroke on the back where a breaststroke movement with the arms propels the body forward feet first. Also the arms can be lifted out of the water and pulled backwards together with a scooping movement. Alternatively, the arms can be raised behind the head, alternately or together pushing with the hands, propelling the body. Similarly, the hands can be brought together in a clapping action. These strokes are often used for training.\n* Eel style: start position of swimmer is backward, hands to body and legs close floating. Swimmer then starts to undulate first with hand and shoulders then trespassing undulation on legs. The propulsion force is mainly generated by hands, which stay all the time close to body. Swimmer tries to relay on gliding flow of water moving easily and swiftly. Legs do not perform flutter stroke as it will create force opposite to undulation. Efficiency is achieved by undulating along the whole body, intermittently and at intervals.  Once the body is introduced in undulation, it will soon achieved optimal velocity. The purpose of transfer from preparation to propulsion phase is to generate gliding flow, which swimmer will use as an additional lift in moving forward and up. Swimmers in nature use body undulations to generate these propulsive and maneuvering forces. The anguilliform kinematics is driven by muscular actions all along the body<ref name=\"naturalmodes\">https://www.academia.edu/33629374/Natural_modes_of_swimming_new_swimming_styles_how_to_swim_with_efficient_buoyant_velocity</ref>{{dubious|date=November 2017}}\n* Corkscrew swimming: Alternating between front crawl and backstroke every arm. This leads to a constant rotation of the swimmer. The stroke is used mainly for training purposes and is also sometimes known as Newfie Stroke, referring to [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. When rotating every third stroke, this is called ''waltz crawl''.\n* Gliding: The swimmer is stretched with the arms to the front, the head between the arms and the feet to the back. This streamlined shape minimizes resistance and allows the swimmer to glide, for example after a [[Dive start|start]], a push off from a wall, or to rest between strokes.\n* [[Cuttlefish|Sepia bone]]: Sepia bone could be effective as drifting technique, in steering and floating in the fast flow, using only hand to navigate the stream, complementary as passive to more proactive swimming techniques.<ref name=\"naturalmodes\"/>\n* Turtle stroke: On the breast, extend right arm then pull, after pushing with the left leg (while opposite limbs are recovering), then opposite limbs repeat this process, i. e. left arm pulls after right leg pushes. Uses muscles of the waist. Head can easily be above or below water: this is a slow but very sustainable stroke, common in [[turtle]]s and [[newt]]s.\n* Octopus stroke: The swimmer starts from floating posture backward spreading arms and feet in spread position, arms raised further up to the maximum momentum, keeping them parallel to the surface, in the propulsive phase returning the same way, hands to the body and legs merging. Legs opening to the 45 degree returning then returning and closing, arms smoothly from 90, 120 degrees of leg axis, then cling to the legs. More economical means of motion involves alternative movements of leg and arms, first arms then legs (Dalton, 1918). Effective swimming, however, implies their parallel movement.<ref>Dalton, F. E. (1918). Swimming scientifically taught, Funk and Wagnalls Company, New York and London</ref><ref name=\"naturalmodes\"/>\n\n==Special purpose styles==\nA number of strokes are only used for special purposes, e.g. to manipulate an object (a swimmer in distress, a ball), or just to stay afloat.\n\n===Underwater swimming===\nSwimming underwater is faster than swimming on the surface.  Underwater swimming is not its own category in the Olympics, but in the [[Swimming at the 1988 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metre backstroke|1988 Olympics]] several competitors swam much of the backstroke race underwater.  After that, the Olympics created a rule that swimmers are only allowed to stay underwater for the first 10 meters (later changed to 15 meters) after a start or a turn.<ref>https://swimswam.com/david-berkoff-daichi-suzukis-underwater-duel-88/</ref>\n\nAny style with underwater recovery can be done underwater for certain distances depending on the need for air. Underwater swimming on the back has the additional problem of water entering the nose. To avoid this, the swimmer can breathe out through the nose or wear a nose clip. Some swimmers can close their nostrils with the upper lip or with the [[compressor naris]] muscles.\n* [[Dolphin kick]]: this is the style that is usually used at the beginning of the race, to hold on to the speed the swimmer generate by pushing off the walls at the start and the turns.<ref>https://www.yourswimlog.com/develop-awesome-underwater-dolphin-kick/</ref>  The feet kick while the arms keep still while extended in front of the head, with the hands together.\n* [[Fish kick]]: Similar to the dolphin kick, but performed while on the swimmer's side. This may be the fastest form of swimming.  Swimming creates vortices which propel the swimmer forward.  In the dolphin kick, the vortices go up and down, where they're disturbed when they hit the surface of the water or the bottom of the pool.  But with the fish kick, they go sideways, where there are no obstructions.<ref>http://nautil.us/issue/25/water/is-this-new-swim-stroke-the-fastest-yet</ref>\n* Pull-down Breaststroke: most common swim stroke underwater as it requests very low energy. Main application is for [[dynamic apnea]] (DNF)\n* Sea lion stroke: this swimming stroke is primarily performed with [[sculling]], arms at the side along the bodyline and strongly supported with [[flutter kick]]s in a contralateral sequencing. It can be identified to the [[sea lion]] swimming style.<ref>{{Google books |id=2rkHQpToi9sC |page=1142 |title=Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals }}</ref> It's very effective to swim through narrow underwater places.\n\n=== Undulatory swimming ===\nSwimming hydrodynamics have significantly applied BCF (body-caudal fin swimming)  to techniques. In addition research on undulatory motion, undulatory [[Body-caudal fin locomotion|Body-caudal fin]] [[anguilliform]], and undulatory [[Fish locomotion|Median-paired fin]] give interesting conclusions. These natural modes are seen as an alternative to BCF techniques introducing some missing elements as [[buoyancy]], [[gliding]] and floating to complement the scale of man\u2019s hydrodynamics.<ref>31.\tLindsey, C. C. (1978) Form, function and locomotory habits in fish, in Fish Physiology VII Locomotion, W. S. Hoar and D. J. Randall, Eds. New York: Academic, 1\u2013100</ref>\n\nThe study draws a conclusion from hydrodynamic properties of cephalopods as implied to human kinetics, discerning significant patterns, like floating, puddle, undulation or efficiency. In biomechanical aspect medusoid and anguilliform shows positive results: low [[Reynolds number]], low [[viscous forces]], stability, great laminar flow, [[linear momentum]] and efficient velocity.\n\n===Lifesaving strokes===\n* Lifesaving stroke: Similar to the [[sidestroke|side stroke]], but only the bottom arm moves while the top arm tows a swimmer in distress.\n* Lifesaving approach stroke (also known as ''head-up front crawl'' or ''[[Tarzan]] stroke''): Similar to the [[front crawl]], but with the eyes to the front above the water level, such as to observe the surroundings as for example a swimmer in distress or a ball.\n* Pushing rescue stroke: This stroke helps to assist a tired swimmer: The tired swimmer lies on the back and the rescuer swims a breaststroke kick and pushes against the soles of the tired swimmer  (not taught or recognized by the RLSS body governing UK lifeguarding).\n* Pulling rescue stroke: This stroke helps to assist a swimmer in distress. Both swimmers lie on the back, and the rescuer grabs the armpits of the swimmer in distress and performs a breaststroke kick (on the back) for forwarding motion. The kick has to be not too shallow as otherwise the victim will be hit.\n* Extended Arm Tow (unconscious victim):  swimming sidestroke or breaststroke on their back, the rescuer holds the head with a straight arm, the hand cupping underneath the chin, and ensures that the mouth and nose are out of the water.\n* Arm Tow: the rescuer swims sidestroke, behind the casualty holds the upper right arm of a casualty with their left hand or vice versa, lifting the casualty out of the water.\n* Vice Grip Turn and Trawl: used on a victim with a suspected spinal injury. The lifeguard approaches slowly to the victim (who is usually face down in water), places one hand on the victim's chin, with arm pressed firmly against the victim's chest. The other hand is placed on the back of the victim's head with the arm down the victim's back. Both arms press together (like a vice), and the lifeguard uses his feet to begin moving forward and then rolls under the victim to come up alongside her or him, but with the victim now on his or her back. (This is one of the hardest lifesaving maneuvers, as the grip must be perfect on the first attempt; otherwise, the victim may be given further spinal damage, such as paralysis.)\n* Clothes swimming: The swimmer is wearing clothes that restrict movement when wet, i.e. almost all clothes. This is done to practice situations where the swimmer fell in the water dressed or the rescuer did not have time to undress. Due to the restricted movement and the weight of wet clothes out of the water, an overarm recovery is not possible. Most swimmers swim breaststroke, but any stroke with underwater recovery is feasible.\n* Rescue tube swimming: The lifeguard pulls a flotation device, which is pushed forward when approaching the victim.\n\n===Without forward motion===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Water polo]] -->\n* Survival floating (also known as ''dead man float'' and [[drownproofing]]): Lying on the prone (face down in water) with minimal leg movement, and staying afloat with the natural buoyancy. Lift the head to breathe only then back to floating. This style is only to stay afloat and to rest.\n* Back floating: Similar to the survival floating, except on the back.\n* [[Treading water]]: The swimmer is in the water head up and feet down. Different kicks, such as the [[eggbeater kick]], and hand movements are used to stay afloat. This is useful to keep the head out of the water for a better view or to catch an object as for example in water polo.\n* Sculling: This is a figure 8 movement of the hands for forward motion or upward lift. Used in [[surf lifesaving]], [[water polo]], [[synchronised swimming|synchronized swimming]] and treading water.\n* Turtle float: The knees are raised to the chest and encircled by the arms.<ref name=\"scouts\">https://web.archive.org/web/20110613082530/http://www.usscouts.org/macscouter/CubScouts/PowWow99/Web99.pdf</ref>\n* Jellyfish float: Holding the ankles with the hands.<ref name=\"scouts\" />\n* Head first surface dive\n\n==See also==\n* [[Paralympic swimming]]\n* [[Combat sidestroke#Composite stroke|Composite stroke]]\n* [[Stunt swimming]]\n* [[Total Immersion]] (swimming instruction technique)\n* [[Turn (swimming)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.swimmingstrokes.info Overview of 150 historical and less known swimming styles]\n\n{{Swimming styles}}\n\n[[Category:Swimming styles| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[Human swimming]] typically consists of repeating a specific body motion or '''swimming stroke '''to propel that body forward.  There are many kinds of strokes, each defining a different '''swimming style''' or '''crawl'''.\n\nIn high school, collegiate, and Olympic swimming, there are two [[undulating]] strokes (breaststroke, and butterfly stroke,) and two alternating strokes (front crawl and backstroke).\n\nMost strokes involve rhythmic and coordinated movements of all major body parts \u2014 torso, arms, legs, hands, feet, and head.  Breathing typically must be synchronized with the strokes, too.  It is possible, however, to swim by moving only legs without arms or only arms without legs; such strokes may be used for special purposes, for training or exercise, or by [[amputation|amputees]] (paralympians) and [[paralysis|paralytics]].\n\n==Swimming styles==\nn\n* [[Front crawl]]: the fastest style for swimming on the surface. Done while face down. The arms alternate while the legs perform an up and down motion\n** Dolphin crawl: Similar to front crawl, but with a [[dolphin kick]]. One kick per arm or two kicks per cycle. This style is often used in training.\n** Catch up stroke: A variation of the front crawl where one arm always rests at the front while the other arm performs one cycle. This can also be used as a drill when training in competitive swimming.\n** Head-high crawl (also known as the water polo stroke, lifeguard approach stroke, or Tarzan drill):  This stroke is used for [[water polo]], lifeguards to keep the victim in sight, or those who simply want to see where they're going and breathe with ease. It is similar to front crawl, but with head above the water.  This can also be used as a drill when training in competitive swimming.\n* [[Trudgen]]: The trudgen is similar to the front crawl, except that it is paired with a [[Sidestroke|scissors kick]], similar to that used in the sidestroke.\n** Trudgen crawl: Similar to the trudgen, but with the use of a flutter kick (up and down leg kick) between the scissor kicks.\n** Double trudgen: Similar to the trudgen, but the sides of the scissors kick alternate.\n** Double trudgen crawl: Similar to the double trudgen, but with a flutter kick between the scissors kick alternate.\n* [[Butterfly stroke]]: performed face down in the water. The legs perform a dolphin kick and while the arms move in a forward circle at the same time.\n** Slow butterfly (also known as \"moth stroke\"): Similar to butterfly, but with an extended gliding phase, Breathing during the pull/push phase, return head into the water during recovery. This style uses two kicks per cycle.\n* [[Breaststroke]]: performed face down in the water without rotating the torso. The arms stay in the water and move synchronously, while the legs perform a whip kick. It is possible to keep the head elevated out of the water throughout the stroke, although the head usually dips in and out.\n** Inverted breaststroke: Similar to elementary backstroke, but with a breaststroke kick and arm motions.\n* [[Backstroke]]: Done while lying on the back.  One arm reaches behind the head with a fingertip entry while the other arm is by the side.  The legs perform an up and down motion .\n** Elementary backstroke: Both arms move synchronized (They begin out like an airplane, then go beside the body like a soldier then they run up the sides and back out to an airplane position) with whip kick (breaststroke kick).\n** Inverted butterfly: Similar to elementary backstroke, but with a dolphin kick. This is often used for training.\n** Back double trudgen: Similar to the backstroke, but with a scissors kick to alternating sides.\n**Old English Backstroke : Lying on back, breaststroke legs and butterfly arms\n* [[Backstroke|Forward backstroke]]: Done  lying on back and floating. Arms parallel to the surface, moving in the opposite direction  to backstroke. \n* [[Sidestroke]]: On the side, pull the water as if with a rope with arms going out and stopping in the middle while ensuring that the strokes are most hydrodynamic when moving towards the desired location, and pushing the most water when moving away from the location. In addition, the legs are performing a scissors kick, which is like breaststroke kick, but sideways.\n** Lifesaving stroke: Similar to the [[sidestroke|side stroke]], but only the bottom arm moves while the top arm tows a swimmer in distress.\n** [[Combat sidestroke]]: This stroke was developed and used by the [[United States Navy SEALs]] and is designed to be more efficient and reduce profile in the water.\n* [[Combat sidestroke|Composite stroke]] is drill stroke within one basic stroke, ''ins'' (for example, Front crawl flutter/scissor Dolphin/Dolphin flutter) or between two basic stroke, ''weens'' (Over arm 1 Arm Lead Sidestroke to 2 Arms Lead Dolphin). It is great strength and effort training technique.\n* [[Dog paddle]]: face over water and paddling with alternate hands, often with the nose and mouth above the water. This stroke can be used in reverse to propel the body feet first.\n** Human stroke: Similar to the dog paddle, but the arms reach out more and pull farther down.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n* Survival travel stroke: Alternating underwater arm stroke, one cycle for propulsion, one for a lift to stay on the surface. This style is slow but sustainable.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n* Breast feet first strokes: With legs extended, use the arms with a pushing, flapping, clapping or uplifting motion.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n* [[Snorkeling]]: Swimming on the breast using a snorkel, usually in combination with masks and fins. Any stroke on the breast can be used, and there is no need to lift or turn the head for breathing.\n* [[Finswimming]] is the progression of a swimmer using fins either on the water surface or underwater. Finswimming is usually done on the breast.\n* An arm and a leg: is the progression of a swimmer clasping one leg with the opposite arm, and using breaststroke movements with the remaining arm and leg.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n* Flutter back finning: Symmetrically underwater arm recovery with flutter kick.\n* Flicker kick: Concerning human morphology oscillatory [[flutter kick]] is more suitable, hence all swimming techniques exert vertical oscillation with upward propelling. Flicker kick, as vibration of both, hands and legs, with slight deviation of arms within regular undulation will produce powerful horizontal dynamics. Swimmer by propelling is not just vibrating, this is proved to be insufficient, but rather producing undulating waves (horizontal instead of vertical). The initial move is made by shoulders gliding backward and curve. Meandering is transmitted to the hips and legs. Undulation is most pronounced between the shoulders and thighs. At the end of swimming cycle, legs produce flicker kick as collateral to undulatory movement. See also eel stroke. \n* Feet first swimming: A very slow stroke on the back where a breaststroke movement with the arms propels the body forward feet first. Also the arms can be lifted out of the water and pulled backwards together with a scooping movement. Alternatively, the arms can be raised behind the head, alternately or together pushing with the hands, propelling the body. Similarly, the hands can be brought together in a clapping action. These strokes are often used for training.\n* Eel style: start position of swimmer is backward, hands to body and legs close floating.

The siege lasted for several months, culminating in an Allied attack on the Italian garrison thereby forcing it to surrender.\n\nIn the first months of 1941, British and [[Force Publique|Belgian colonial forces]] attacked [[Italian East Africa]] from the colony of [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]. By the end of March, they had seized the town of [[Gambela, Ethiopia|Gambela]] and begun containing retreating Italian forces, which were massing on a plateau in the mountain town of Sa\u00efo (presently Dembidolo) under the command of General [[Carlo De Simone]] and later General [[Pietro Gazzera]]. The British forces withdrew the following month and the Belgians advanced down the road to Sa\u00efo. The Italians repelled them and they were forced to hold their positions along a nearby brook. Almost no fighting took place in May as heavy rain bogged down the Belgians and turned their supply line from Sudan into mud, creating a food shortage. In early June, reinforcements arrived via river and the Belgians besieged the Italian supply depot at Mogi. Aggressive patrols, combined with the actions of the Ethiopian resistance and raids from the [[South African Air Force]] put increased pressure upon the Italian garrison.\n\nAt the end of the month General [[Auguste Gilliaert]] took charge of the Belgian force. He was instructed by the British to attack when an opportunity presented itself. On 3 July, he assaulted the base of Sa\u00efo Mountain and in the afternoon Gazzera sued for peace. On 6 July, the Belgians formally accepted the surrender of Gazzera, eight of his generals and over {{nowrap|6,000 Italian}} soldiers.\n\n== Background ==\n\n===''Africa Orientale Italiana''===\n\n{{see also|Order of Battle, East African Campaign (World War II)|l1=Order of Battle, East African Campaign|First Italo-Ethiopian War|Second Italo-Ethiopian War}}\n\nOn 9 May 1936, the Italian dictator, [[Benito Mussolini]], proclaimed the colony of ''[[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]]'' (AOI, Italian East Africa), formed from Ethiopia (after the Italian victory in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], fought 3 October 1935 \u2013 May 1936) and the existing Italian possessions of [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]].{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], which made Italian military forces in Libya a threat to Egypt and those in Italian East Africa a danger to the British and French colonies in East Africa. Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British supply routes along the coast of East Africa, the [[Gulf of Aden]], [[Red Sea]] and the [[Suez Canal]].{{efn|The [[Kingdom of Egypt]] remained [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] during World War II but the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]] allowed the British to occupy Egypt and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=6\u20137, 69}}}} Egypt, the Suez Canal, [[French Somaliland]] and [[British Somaliland]] were also vulnerable to an attack from Italian East Africa but the rearmament plans of the ''Comando Supremo'' (Italian General Staff) were not due to mature until 1942; in 1940 the Italian armed forces were not ready for military operations against a comparable power.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===''Regio Esercito''===\n\n{{see also|Regio Esercito}}\n\n[[File:Ethiopia shaded relief map 1999, CIA.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Modern map of Ethiopia}}]]\n[[Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta|Amedeo, Duke of Aosta]], was appointed [[Viceroy]] and [[Governor-General]] of Italian East Africa in November 1937, with a headquarters in [[Addis Ababa]], the Ethiopian capital. On 1 June 1940, as the commander in chief of the ''Comando Forze Armate dell'Africa Orientale Italiana'' (Italian East African Armed Forces Command) and ''Generale d'Armata Aerea'' (General of the Air Force), Aosta had about {{nowrap|290,476 locally recruited}} and Italian-born army, naval and air force personnel, available. By 1 August, mobilisation in Italian East Africa had increased that number to {{nowrap|371,053 troops.}}{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=93}} On 10 June, the ''Regio Esercito'' (Italian Royal Army) was organised in four commands, with the military forces in Ethiopia led by General [[Pietro Gazzera]].{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=166}}\n\nAosta had the [[40 Infantry Division Cacciatori d'Africa|40th Infantry Division ''Cacciatori d'Africa'']] and the [[65 Infantry Division Granatieri di Savoia|65th Infantry Division ''Granatieri di Savoia'']] from Italy, a battalion of ''[[Alpini]]'' (elite mountain troops), a ''[[Bersaglieri]]'' battalion of motorised infantry, several {{lang|it|Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale}} (MSVN [[MVSN Colonial Militia|''Camicie Nere'']] [Blackshirt]) battalions and an assortment of smaller units; about 70 percent of the Italian troops were locally recruited [[Askari]]. The regular Eritrean battalions and the {{lang|it|Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali}} (RCTC [[Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops]]) were among the best Italian units in Italian East Africa and included Eritrean cavalry {{lang|it|Penne di Falco}} (Falcon Feathers).{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=166}}\n\n===British plans===\n\nIn August 1939, Wavell ordered a plan covertly to encourage a rebellion in the western Ethiopian province of [[Gojjam]], which the Italians had never been able entirely to repress after the end of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in May 1936. In September, Colonel [[Daniel Sandford (soldier)|Daniel Sandford]] arrived to run the project but until the Italian declaration of war, the conspiracy was held back by the British policy of appeasement, intended to avoid a simultaneous war with Germany and Italy. [[Gideon Force|Mission 101]] was formed to co-ordinate the activities of the ''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots). In June 1940, [[Haile Selassie]] arrived in Egypt and in July, went to Sudan to meet Platt and discuss plans to re-capture Ethiopia, despite Platt's reservations.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=155}} In July, the British recognised Selassie as emperor of Ethiopia and in August, Mission 101 entered Gojjam province to reconnoitre. Sandford requested that supply routes to the area north of Lake Tana be established before the rains ended and that Selassie should return in October as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of [[Lake Tana]], to [[Dangila]], Debra Markos and Addis Ababa, to prevent them concentrating against the ''Arbegnoch''. Italian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissension between local potentates were being reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=403}}\n\nThe Frontier Battalion of the Sudan Defence Force (SDF), set up in May 1940, was joined at Khartoum by the 2nd Ethiopian and 4th Eritrean battalions, raised from \u00e9migr\u00e9 volunteers in Kenya. Operational Centres consisting of an officer, five NCOs and several picked Ethiopians were formed and trained in guerrilla warfare, to provide leadership cadres and \u00a31 million was set aside to finance their operations. Major [[Orde Wingate]] was sent to Khartoum with an assistant to join the headquarters of the SDF. On 20 November, Wingate was flown to Sakhala to meet Sandford; the British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) managed to bomb Dangila, drop propaganda leaflets and supply Mission 101, which raised Ethiopian morale, having suffered much from Italian air power since the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Mission 101 managed to persuade the ''Arbegnoch'' north of Lake Tana to spring several ambushes on the Metemma\u2013Gondar road and the Italian garrison at [[Wolqayt|Wolkait]] was withdrawn in February 1941.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=404\u2013405}}\n\n===Belgian plans===\n{{see also|Belgian Congo in World War II}}\n\n[[File:Force Publique leaving for Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''Force Publique'' soldiers leaving the Congo for Italian East Africa]]\nAt the conclusion of the [[Battle of Belgium]] in May 1940, the only proper force under Belgian command was the ''[[Force Publique]]'' (\"Public Force\" i.e. the colonial army) of the [[Belgian Congo]] in Central Africa. It thus made up the bulk of the [[Free Belgian Forces]]. Consisting of 15,000 native ranks and Belgian officers, it was well equipped, well disciplined and dispersed throughout the colony.<ref name= Veranneman83>{{harvnb|Veranneman|2014|p=83}}</ref> Through the year, the ''Force Publique'''s defence obligations were considered too important for it to be spared for any offensive operations.

The [[Belgian government in exile]] was wary of declaring war on a country whose royal family had dynastic links with its own, though this attitude changed after it became known that Italian aircraft based in occupied Belgium were attacking Britain and when an Italian submarine sank a Belgian cargo ship. A declaration of war was eventually delivered on 23 November 1940.<ref name= Veranneman84>{{harvnb|Veranneman|2014|p=84}}</ref> Two days later, Ryckmans proclaimed that a state of war existed between Italy and the Congo.<ref name= weller5>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=5}}</ref>\n\n[[Free French Forces]] consolidated their control over Equatorial Africa at the [[Battle of Gabon]] and more German involvement in the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]] (begun by Italy in 1939) made the possibility of intervention in Portugal remote.<ref name= weller4/> The staff of the ''Force Publique'' and the Belgian government then resolved to assemble an expedition to fight in Italian East Africa.<ref name= weller5/> Plans were coordinated with the British and in February 1941, after an extended period of preparation, the first group of 8,000 troops and porters set out from the Congo for Ethiopia.<ref name= Veranneman84/> Starting in [[Stanley Pool]], they rode a dozen {{convert|10|LT|t|abbr=on}} barges and a tugboat up the [[Congo River]] to [[Aketi (town)|Aketi]].

After a series of actions in 1940, British colonial forces from Anglo-Egyptian Sudan invaded the territory and eventually a [[salient (geography)|salient]] formed around the [[Baro River]]. In March 1941, the Italian forces began to withdraw from the salient under increasing pressure.<ref name= Moyse-Bartlett533/> On 8 March the first battalion of the Belgo-Congolese expeditionary force marched from Kurmuk towards the Italian-held town of Asosa.

The rainy season had begun, turning the main road from Sudan into mud, cutting off their communications and supplies. The Baro and [[Sobat River|Sobat]] rivers were still too low to permit the passage of supply barges from the White Nile and the nearby Gambela airfield was too small for transport aircraft to land.

They then decided to try to sever the Italian supply line between Sa\u00efo and Mogi, another town upon the plateau. To hold the line near Bortai Brook, the Belgians could only spare around 250 men for an attack.<ref name= weller18/> It was hoped that cutting the Italians off would allow the British, stalled in their advance at Gidami, to move south and encircle Sa\u00efo. On 9 June the Belgian force attacked Mogi, their flank covered by the arrival of a new battalion from the Congo. The Italian garrison, numbering around 300 men, held off the assault. Believing that the town could only be taken at a heavy cost, the Belgians instead fortified their positions around Mogi and sent patrols to ambush the road by which Sa\u00efo was being supplied.<ref name= weller19/>\n\nAt the regular front, Lieutenant Colonel Dronkers-Martens ordered his troops to increase their patrol activities upon the Sa\u00efo Plateau, to make the Italians believe that they were facing superior forces.<ref name= weller19/> They used [[shoot-and-scoot]] tactics, avoiding [[counter-battery fire]] and leaving the Italians with the impression that they were facing multiple consistent points of fire. Gazzera tripled the size of the Mogi garrison and the Italians began to reduce their activity as the Belgians became bolder.

Belgo-Congolese troops, British Commonwealth forces and local resistance fighters besieged the fort at the market town of [[Dembidolo|Sa\u00efo]] in south-western [[Ethiopia]] in 1941. The siege lasted for several months, culminating in an Allied attack on the Italian garrison thereby forcing it to surrender.\n\nIn the first months of 1941, British and [[Force Publique|Belgian colonial forces]] attacked [[Italian East Africa]] from the colony of [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]. By the end of March, they had seized the town of [[Gambela, Ethiopia|Gambela]] and begun containing retreating Italian forces, which were massing on a plateau in the mountain town of Sa\u00efo (presently Dembidolo) under the command of General [[Carlo De Simone]] and later General [[Pietro Gazzera]]. The British forces withdrew the following month and the Belgians advanced down the road to Sa\u00efo. The Italians repelled them and they were forced to hold their positions along a nearby brook. Almost no fighting took place in May as heavy rain bogged down the Belgians and turned their supply line from Sudan into mud, creating a food shortage. In early June, reinforcements arrived via river and the Belgians besieged the Italian supply depot at Mogi. Aggressive patrols, combined with the actions of the Ethiopian resistance and raids from the [[South African Air Force]] put increased pressure upon the Italian garrison.\n\nAt the end of the month General [[Auguste Gilliaert]] took charge of the Belgian force. He was instructed by the British to attack when an opportunity presented itself. On 3 July, he assaulted the base of Sa\u00efo Mountain and in the afternoon Gazzera sued for peace. On 6 July, the Belgians formally accepted the surrender of Gazzera, eight of his generals and over {{nowrap|6,000 Italian}} soldiers.\n\n== Background ==\n\n===''Africa Orientale Italiana''===\n\n{{see also|Order of Battle, East African Campaign (World War II)|l1=Order of Battle, East African Campaign|First Italo-Ethiopian War|Second Italo-Ethiopian War}}\n\nOn 9 May 1936, the Italian dictator, [[Benito Mussolini]], proclaimed the colony of ''[[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]]'' (AOI, Italian East Africa), formed from Ethiopia (after the Italian victory in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], fought 3 October 1935 \u2013 May 1936) and the existing Italian possessions of [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]].{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], which made Italian military forces in Libya a threat to Egypt and those in Italian East Africa a danger to the British and French colonies in East Africa. Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British supply routes along the coast of East Africa, the [[Gulf of Aden]], [[Red Sea]] and the [[Suez Canal]].{{efn|The [[Kingdom of Egypt]] remained [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] during World War II but the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]] allowed the British to occupy Egypt and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=6\u20137, 69}}}} Egypt, the Suez Canal, [[French Somaliland]] and [[British Somaliland]] were also vulnerable to an attack from Italian East Africa but the rearmament plans of the ''Comando Supremo'' (Italian General Staff) were not due to mature until 1942; in 1940 the Italian armed forces were not ready for military operations against a comparable power.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===''Regio Esercito''===\n\n{{see also|Regio Esercito}}\n\n[[File:Ethiopia shaded relief map 1999, CIA.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Modern map of Ethiopia}}]]\n[[Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta|Amedeo, Duke of Aosta]], was appointed [[Viceroy]] and [[Governor-General]] of Italian East Africa in November 1937, with a headquarters in [[Addis Ababa]], the Ethiopian capital. On 1 June 1940, as the commander in chief of the ''Comando Forze Armate dell'Africa Orientale Italiana'' (Italian East African Armed Forces Command) and ''Generale d'Armata Aerea'' (General of the Air Force), Aosta had about {{nowrap|290,476 locally recruited}} and Italian-born army, naval and air force personnel, available. By 1 August, mobilisation in Italian East Africa had increased that number to {{nowrap|371,053 troops.}}{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=93}} On 10 June, the ''Regio Esercito'' (Italian Royal Army) was organised in four commands, with the military forces in Ethiopia led by General [[Pietro Gazzera]].{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=166}}\n\nAosta had the [[40 Infantry Division Cacciatori d'Africa|40th Infantry Division ''Cacciatori d'Africa'']] and the [[65 Infantry Division Granatieri di Savoia|65th Infantry Division ''Granatieri di Savoia'']] from Italy, a battalion of ''[[Alpini]]'' (elite mountain troops), a ''[[Bersaglieri]]'' battalion of motorised infantry, several {{lang|it|Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale}} (MSVN [[MVSN Colonial Militia|''Camicie Nere'']] [Blackshirt]) battalions and an assortment of smaller units; about 70 percent of the Italian troops were locally recruited [[Askari]]. The regular Eritrean battalions and the {{lang|it|Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali}} (RCTC [[Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops]]) were among the best Italian units in Italian East Africa and included Eritrean cavalry {{lang|it|Penne di Falco}} (Falcon Feathers).{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=166}}\n\n===British plans===\n\nIn August 1939, Wavell ordered a plan covertly to encourage a rebellion in the western Ethiopian province of [[Gojjam]], which the Italians had never been able entirely to repress after the end of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in May 1936. In September, Colonel [[Daniel Sandford (soldier)|Daniel Sandford]] arrived to run the project but until the Italian declaration of war, the conspiracy was held back by the British policy of appeasement, intended to avoid a simultaneous war with Germany and Italy. [[Gideon Force|Mission 101]] was formed to co-ordinate the activities of the ''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots). In June 1940, [[Haile Selassie]] arrived in Egypt and in July, went to Sudan to meet Platt and discuss plans to re-capture Ethiopia, despite Platt's reservations.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=155}} In July, the British recognised Selassie as emperor of Ethiopia and in August, Mission 101 entered Gojjam province to reconnoitre. Sandford requested that supply routes to the area north of Lake Tana be established before the rains ended and that Selassie should return in October as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of [[Lake Tana]], to [[Dangila]], Debra Markos and Addis Ababa, to prevent them concentrating against the ''Arbegnoch''. Italian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissension between local potentates were being reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=403}}\n\nThe Frontier Battalion of the Sudan Defence Force (SDF), set up in May 1940, was joined at Khartoum by the 2nd Ethiopian and 4th Eritrean battalions, raised from \u00e9migr\u00e9 volunteers in Kenya. Operational Centres consisting of an officer, five NCOs and several picked Ethiopians were formed and trained in guerrilla warfare, to provide leadership cadres and \u00a31 million was set aside to finance their operations. Major [[Orde Wingate]] was sent to Khartoum with an assistant to join the headquarters of the SDF. On 20 November, Wingate was flown to Sakhala to meet Sandford; the British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) managed to bomb Dangila, drop propaganda leaflets and supply Mission 101, which raised Ethiopian morale, having suffered much from Italian air power since the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Mission 101 managed to persuade the ''Arbegnoch'' north of Lake Tana to spring several ambushes on the Metemma\u2013Gondar road and the Italian garrison at [[Wolqayt|Wolkait]] was withdrawn in February 1941.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=404\u2013405}}\n\n===Belgian plans===\n{{see also|Belgian Congo in World War II}}\n\n[[File:Force Publique leaving for Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''Force Publique'' soldiers leaving the Congo for Italian East Africa]]\nAt the conclusion of the [[Battle of Belgium]] in May 1940, the only proper force under Belgian command was the ''[[Force Publique]]'' (\"Public Force\" i.e. the colonial army) of the [[Belgian Congo]] in Central Africa. It thus made up the bulk of the [[Free Belgian Forces]]. Consisting of 15,000 native ranks and Belgian officers, it was well equipped, well disciplined and dispersed throughout the colony.<ref name= Veranneman83>{{harvnb|Veranneman|2014|p=83}}</ref> Through the year, the ''Force Publique'''s defence obligations were considered too important for it to be spared for any offensive operations.

The [[Belgian government in exile]] was wary of declaring war on a country whose royal family had dynastic links with its own, though this attitude changed after it became known that Italian aircraft based in occupied Belgium were attacking Britain and when an Italian submarine sank a Belgian cargo ship. A declaration of war was eventually delivered on 23 November 1940.<ref name= Veranneman84>{{harvnb|Veranneman|2014|p=84}}</ref> Two days later, Ryckmans proclaimed that a state of war existed between Italy and the Congo.<ref name= weller5>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=5}}</ref>\n\n[[Free French Forces]] consolidated their control over Equatorial Africa at the [[Battle of Gabon]] and more German involvement in the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]] (begun by Italy in 1939) made the possibility of intervention in Portugal remote.<ref name= weller4/> The staff of the ''Force Publique'' and the Belgian government then resolved to assemble an expedition to fight in Italian East Africa.<ref name= weller5/> Plans were coordinated with the British and in February 1941, after an extended period of preparation, the first group of 8,000 troops and porters set out from the Congo for Ethiopia.<ref name= Veranneman84/> Starting in [[Stanley Pool]], they rode a dozen {{convert|10|LT|t|abbr=on}} barges and a tugboat up the [[Congo River]] to [[Aketi (town)|Aketi]].

After a series of actions in 1940, British colonial forces from Anglo-Egyptian Sudan invaded the territory and eventually a [[salient (geography)|salient]] formed around the [[Baro River]]. In March 1941, the Italian forces began to withdraw from the salient under increasing pressure.<ref name= Moyse-Bartlett533/> On 8 March the first battalion of the Belgo-Congolese expeditionary force marched from Kurmuk towards the Italian-held town of Asosa. They attacked three days later in conjunction with troops of the [[King's African Rifles]] (KAR), forcing the garrison to retreat to [[Gidami]].<ref name=weller6/> Next, the Belgians and Congolese began attacking the town of [[Gambela, Ethiopia|Gambela]] directly from the west while two [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of the 2/6 KAR under Captain J.

Numbering at 1,600 soldiers and 600 non-combatant [[Porter (carrier)|porters]], they lacked the strength to seize the plateau. With the Italians receiving reinforcements of troops retreating from the east, the Belgians decided to keep the initiative to disguise their small numbers.<ref name= weller16>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=16}}</ref>\n\nThree days of cold weather and rain preceded the offensive.<ref name= weller21>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=21}}</ref> On 15 April, Lieutenant Colonel Edmond van der Meersch led an attack on the brook. A Belgian lieutenant scouting in [[no man's land]] was ambushed and killed. A Belgian sergeant caught three Italian officers at gunpoint but lowered his revolver when they claimed to be English, thinking the KAR might have dispatched a liaison party to the area. He was then shot by [[sniper]]s concealed in [[the bush]]. A battle ensued in which four Congolese soldiers were killed. Three Italians and an estimated 40 [[Eritrean Ascari]] were killed, with approximately 70 Ascari wounded.<ref name= weller16/>\n\nDuring the ensuring stalemate, the Belgians studied the Italians' tactics; they would post pairs of snipers and artillery spotters in trees guarded at the bases by infantry squads. Their [[artillery barrage]]s were usually avoided by Belgian patrols, though they would continue up to an hour after they withdrew.<ref name= weller16/> On 21 April, the Italians launched a large [[counterattack]].

The rainy season had begun, turning the main road from Sudan into mud, cutting off their communications and supplies. The Baro and [[Sobat River|Sobat]] rivers were still too low to permit the passage of supply barges from the White Nile and the nearby Gambela airfield was too small for transport aircraft to land. The only means of supply was by [[airdrop]], forcing the Belgians and Congolese to halve their rations.<ref name= weller17/> Several porters attempted to bring food in by foot {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Sudan, but died of fatigue and undernourishment.

They then decided to try to sever the Italian supply line between Sa\u00efo and Mogi, another town upon the plateau. To hold the line near Bortai Brook, the Belgians could only spare around 250 men for an attack.<ref name= weller18/> It was hoped that cutting the Italians off would allow the British, stalled in their advance at Gidami, to move south and encircle Sa\u00efo. On 9 June the Belgian force attacked Mogi, their flank covered by the arrival of a new battalion from the Congo. The Italian garrison, numbering around 300 men, held off the assault. Believing that the town could only be taken at a heavy cost, the Belgians instead fortified their positions around Mogi and sent patrols to ambush the road by which Sa\u00efo was being supplied.<ref name= weller19/>\n\nAt the regular front, Lieutenant Colonel Dronkers-Martens ordered his troops to increase their patrol activities upon the Sa\u00efo Plateau, to make the Italians believe that they were facing superior forces.<ref name= weller19/> They used [[shoot-and-scoot]] tactics, avoiding [[counter-battery fire]] and leaving the Italians with the impression that they were facing multiple consistent points of fire. Gazzera tripled the size of the Mogi garrison and the Italians began to reduce their activity as the Belgians became bolder. Eventually the [[South African Air Force]] (SAAF) committed three [[Hawker Hart]] biplanes to regularly bomb the Sa\u00efo fortress and [[strafe]] the surrounding roads.<ref name= weller20>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=20}}</ref> In the east, British forces pressed on, forcing Gazzera to abandon his own headquarters in [[Jimma]] in mid June and withdraw to Sa\u00efo.<ref name= Playfair310>{{harvnb|Playfair|1956|p=310}}</ref> The 2/6th KAR secured Gidami and headed southeast to cut the Sa\u00efo\u2013[[Yubdo (woreda)|Yubdo]] road.<ref name= platt3552/> By the end of the month, the British had driven the Italians from the western bank of the [[Didessa River]]. The Italian 23rd and 26th Colonial divisions were ordered to retreat through Yubdo, to make their final stand at Sa\u00efo. Heavy rain, actions of the ''Arbegnoch'' and the raids from the SAAF added to their problems.<ref name= Playfair311/><ref name= orpen320>{{harvnb|Orpen|1968|p=320}}</ref>\n\n=== Final assault and Italian surrender ===\n\n[[File:Aerial view of Sa\u00efo fortress.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|{{centre|Aerial view of Sa\u00efo fortress}}]]\nMajor General [[Auguste Gilliaert]] arrived from the Congo before the end of the month.<ref name= weller20/> On 27 June General [[William Platt]], advancing with British forces from Sudan, ordered the Belgians to attack the Italian positions if an opportunity presented itself and Gilliaert immediately undertook preparations for an offensive.<ref name= Playfair311/> The plans for taking Mogi were abandoned and the Belgians were to concentrate their efforts against Sa\u00efo, so all but 50 of the soldiers besieging Mogi were redeployed.<ref name= weller20/><ref name= weller22>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=22}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|I based our chances of success upon continuously keeping aggressive activity along Bortai Brook against Mogi and applying [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]]'s maxim that you can try anything against an enemy who refuses to budge himself.|Gilliaert<ref name= weller21/>}}\n\n[[File:Belgian officers in Saio.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|left|{{centre|General Auguste Gilliaert and Colonel Leopold Dronkers-Martens at the Italian headquarters in Sa\u00efo}}]]\nBelieving the British pursuit to be closer than it actually was, Gazzera ordered the bridge over the Indina River {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Sa\u00efo to be blown, thereby trapping his forces.

In them were eight Italian generals, a Catholic priest and Gazzera's chief of staff. Gilliaert met with them a short distance away from Bortai Brook near Gambela.<ref name= weller21/> They requested that all hostilities south of the [[Blue Nile]] cease and that their army be granted the [[honours of war]].<ref name= Playfair311/> Gilliaert accepted and on 6 July he drove into Sa\u00efo to receive the formal surrender of the Italian forces.<ref name= orpen321>{{harvnb|Orpen|1968|p=321}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n[[File:Assossa-Gambela-Saio.JPG|thumb|{{centre|Congolese memorial to the actions at Asosa, Gambela and Sa\u00efo in Faradje}}]]\nThe Belgo-Congolese force lost 462 men during the conflict, 80 percent of them to disease. It was estimated that the Italians lost about three times as many men. A total of 6,454 Italian troops were taken prisoner, including Gazzera, eight other generals and 3,500 Askari, along with the seizure of 20 artillery pieces, 200 machine guns, 250 trucks and 500 mules.<ref name= Veranneman85/> With Gazzera's surrender, [[Gondar]] became the only area in Ethiopia that remained under Italian control.{{sfn|MOI|1941|p=136}} The market in Sa\u00efo was reopened three days after hostilities had ceased and Belgian engineers repaired the Sa\u00efo-Gambela road.<ref name= weller22/><ref name= weller24/>\n\nThough only numbering about 3,000 soldiers and 2,000 porters, the Belgo-Congolese force had to manage 15,000 prisoners in the former [[Galla-Sidamo Governorate]] after the campaign.<ref name= weller22/> At Gazzera's request, Gilliaert guaranteed the Eritrean Askari safe passage to British prisoner of war camps in the east and sent Congolese guards to protect them from Ethiopian retaliation.<ref name= weller23>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=23}}</ref> The Belgian force quickly returned to the Congo with their [[War looting|spoils of war]].<ref name= weller24/> The siege was the first major victory for the Free Belgian Forces and greatly improved their morale.<ref name= Veranneman85/>\n\n=== Commemoration ===\n\nIn 1943, a three-sided pyramid was erected in [[Faradje]], Belgian Congo to commemorate the actions of the Congolese in Ethiopia.
