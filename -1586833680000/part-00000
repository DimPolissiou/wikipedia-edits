In ''[[Richardson v. Ramirez]]'' (1974), the [[United States Supreme Court]] upheld the constitutionality of felon disenfranchisement statutes, finding that the practice did not deny equal protection to disenfranchised voters. The Court looked to Section 2 of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which proclaims that States in which adult male citizens are denied the right to vote for any reason other than \"participation in rebellion, or other crime\" will suffer a reduction in the basis of their [[United States congressional apportionment|representation in Congress]]. Based on this language, the Court found that this amounted to an \"affirmative sanction\" of the practice of felon disenfranchisement, and the 14th Amendment could not prohibit in one section that which is expressly authorized in another. {{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nBut, critics{{who|date=September 2018}} of the practice argue that Section 2 of the 14th Amendment allows, but does not represent an endorsement of, felony disenfranchisement statutes as constitutional in light of the [[equal protection clause]] and is limited only to the issue of reduced representation. The Court ruled in ''[[Hunter v. Underwood]]'' 471 U.S. 222, 232 (1985) that a state's crime disenfranchisement provision will violate Equal Protection if it can be demonstrated that the provision, as enacted, had \"both [an] impermissible racial motivation and racially discriminatory impact.\" (The law in question also disenfranchised people convicted of vagrancy, adultery, and any misdemeanor \"involving [[moral turpitude]]\"; the test case involved two individuals who faced disenfranchisement for presenting [[Cheque fraud|invalid checks]], which the state authorities had found to be morally [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/turpid turpid] behavior.) A felony disenfranchisement law, which on its face is indiscriminate in nature, cannot be invalidated by the Supreme Court unless its enforcement is proven to racially discriminate and to have been enacted with racially discriminatory [[animus nocendi|animus]].{{Citation needed|reason=In ''Hunter v. Underwood'', the S.C. explicitly did not endorse the constitutionality of designing disenfranchisement to deprive poor whites suffrage to undermine support for an opposition party; but there then was no further need for them to decide finally one way or the other.

In ''[[Richardson v. Ramirez]]'' (1974), the [[United States Supreme Court]] upheld the constitutionality of felon disenfranchisement statutes, finding that the practice did not deny equal protection to disenfranchised voters. The Court looked to Section 2 of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which proclaims that States in which adult male citizens are denied the right to vote for any reason other than \"participation in rebellion, or other crime\" will suffer a reduction in the basis of their [[United States congressional apportionment|representation in Congress]]. Based on this language, the Court found that this amounted to an \"affirmative sanction\" of the practice of felon disenfranchisement, and the 14th Amendment could not prohibit in one section that which is expressly authorized in another. {{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nBut, critics{{who|date=September 2018}} of the practice argue that Section 2 of the 14th Amendment allows, but does not represent an endorsement of, felony disenfranchisement statutes as constitutional in light of the [[equal protection clause]] and is limited only to the issue of reduced representation. The Court ruled in ''[[Hunter v. Underwood]]'' 471 U.S. 222, 232 (1985) that a state's crime disenfranchisement provision will violate Equal Protection if it can be demonstrated that the provision, as enacted, had \"both [an] impermissible racial motivation and racially discriminatory impact.\" (The law in question also disenfranchised people convicted of vagrancy, adultery, and any misdemeanor \"involving [[moral turpitude]]\"; the test case involved two individuals who faced disenfranchisement for presenting [[Cheque fraud|invalid checks]], which the state authorities had found to be morally [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/turpid turpid] behavior.) A felony disenfranchisement law, which on its face is indiscriminate in nature, cannot be invalidated by the Supreme Court unless its enforcement is proven to racially discriminate and to have been enacted with racially discriminatory [[animus nocendi|animus]].{{Citation needed|reason=In ''Hunter v. Underwood'', the S.C. explicitly did not endorse the constitutionality of designing disenfranchisement to deprive poor whites suffrage to undermine support for an opposition party; but there then was no further need for them to decide finally one way or the other.

The copyright holder is typically the work's creator, or a publisher or other business to whom copyright has been assigned. Copyright holders routinely invoke legal and technological measures to prevent and penalize copyright infringement.\n\nCopyright infringement disputes are usually resolved through direct negotiation, a [[notice and take down]] process, or litigation in [[civil court]]. Egregious or large-scale commercial infringement, especially when it involves [[counterfeit]]ing, is sometimes prosecuted via the [[criminal justice]] system. Shifting public expectations, advances in digital technology, and the increasing reach of the Internet have led to such widespread, anonymous infringement that copyright-dependent industries now focus less on pursuing individuals who seek and share copyright-protected content online, and more on expanding copyright law to recognize and penalize, as indirect infringers, the service providers and software distributors who are said to facilitate and encourage individual acts of infringement by others.\n\nEstimates of the actual economic impact of copyright infringement vary widely and depend on many factors. Nevertheless, copyright holders, industry representatives, and legislators have long characterized copyright infringement as piracy or theft \u2013 language which some U.S. courts now regard as [[pejorative]] or otherwise contentious.<ref name=Dowling /><ref name=Hotfile_TF>{{Cite web\n  | title = MPAA Banned From Using Piracy and Theft Terms in Hotfile Trial\n  | accessdate = November 30, 2013\n  | url = http://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-banned-from-using-piracy-and-theft-terms-in-hotfile-trial-131129/| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131130144431/http://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-banned-from-using-piracy-and-theft-terms-in-hotfile-trial-131129/| archivedate= 30 November 2013| url-status= live| date = 2013-11-29\n }}</ref><ref name=Hotfile_TD>{{Cite web\n  | title = MPAA Banned From Using Piracy and Theft Terms in Hotfile Trial\n  | accessdate = November 30, 2013\n  | url = http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131130/15263725410/surprise-mpaa-told-it-cant-use-terms-piracy-theft-stealing-during-hotfile-trial.shtml| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131203072723/http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131130/15263725410/surprise-mpaa-told-it-cant-use-terms-piracy-theft-stealing-during-hotfile-trial.shtml| archivedate= 3 December 2013| url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe ter  africa yaya ce.com/browse/piracy?s=t|work=Dictionary.com|publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC|accessdate=21 April 2014|year=2014}}</ref> but the term has been in use for centuries as a synonym for acts of copyright infringement.<ref name=\"Dekker\">T.

In U.S. law, those rights include reproduction, the preparation of derivative works, distributing copies by sale or rental, and public performance or display.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106|title=17 U.S. Code \u00a7&nbsp;106 \u2013 Exclusive rights in copyrighted works|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref>\n\nIn the U.S., copyright infringement is sometimes confronted via [[lawsuit]]s in civil court, against alleged infringers directly, or against providers of services and software that support unauthorized copying. For example, major motion-picture corporation MGM Studios filed suit against P2P file-sharing services Grokster and Streamcast for their contributory role in copyright infringement.<ref>McDonald, Paul, and Janet Wasko. The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub., 2008. Print. p.202</ref> In 2005, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of MGM, holding that such services could be held liable for copyright infringement since they functioned and, indeed, willfully marketed themselves as venues for acquiring copyrighted movies. The ''[[MGM v. Grokster]]'' case did not overturn the earlier ''[[Sony v. Universal City Studios]]'' decision, but rather clouded the legal waters; future designers of software capable of being used for copyright infringement were warned.<ref>McDonald, Paul, and Janet Wasko. The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub., 2008.

If the work was produced under [[corporate authorship]] it may last 120 years after creation or 95 years after publication, whichever is sooner.\n\nArticle 50 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) requires that signatory countries enable [[court]]s to remedy copyright infringement with injunctions and the destruction of infringing products, and award damages.<ref name=\"Xuan_p208\" /> Some jurisdictions only allow actual, provable damages, and some, like the U.S., allow for large [[statutory damage]] awards intended to deter would-be infringers and allow for compensation in situations where actual damages are difficult to prove.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, copyright or the right to enforce it can be contractually assigned to a third party which did not have a role in producing the work. When this outsourced litigator appears to have no intention of taking any copyright infringement cases to trial, but rather only takes them just far enough through the legal system to identify and exact settlements from suspected infringers, critics commonly refer to the party as a \"[[copyright troll]]\". Such practices have had mixed results in the U.S.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.hsog.tk/2015/02/piracy-and-copyright-in-australia/|title = Piracy and Copyright in Australia|date = 19 February 2015|accessdate = 19 February 2015|website = Howard Smith of Geelong|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150219143600/http://hsog.tk/2015/02/piracy-and-copyright-in-australia/|archivedate = 19 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Criminal law ===\n{{Main|Criminal Copyright Law in the United States}}\n\nPunishment of copyright infringement varies case-by-case across countries.

To establish criminal liability, the [[prosecutor]] must first show the basic elements of copyright infringement: ownership of a valid copyright, and the violation of one or more of the copyright holder's exclusive rights. The government must then establish that [[defendant]] willfully infringed or, in other words, possessed the necessary ''[[mens rea]]''. [[Misdemeanor]] infringement has a very low threshold in terms of number of copies and the value of the infringed works.\n\nThe [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement|ACTA trade agreement]], signed in May 2011 by the United States, Japan, and the EU, requires that its parties add criminal penalties, including incarceration and fines, for copyright and trademark infringement, and obligated the parties to actively police for infringement.<ref name=Xuan_p211 /><ref name=Bitton>Miriam Bitton (2012) [http://www.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/backissues/v102/n1/1021_67.Bitton.pdf Rethinking the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement's Criminal Copyright Enforcement Measures] The Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology 102(1):67\u2013117</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement&nbsp;\u2013 Summary of Key Elements Under Discussion| work = transparency paper| publisher = Swiss federation of Intellectual Property| date = November 2009| url = https://www.ige.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/Juristische_Infos/e/transparency_paper.pdf| accessdate = 8 June 2010 }}</ref>\n\n''[[United States v.

Maximum penalties can be five years in [[prison]] and up to $250,000 in [[Fine (penalty)|fines]]. The NET Act also raised [[statutory damages for copyright infringement|statutory damages]] by 50%. The court's ruling explicitly drew attention to the shortcomings of current law that allowed people to facilitate mass copyright infringement while being immune to prosecution under the [[Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act]].\n\nProposed laws such as the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] broaden the definition of \"willful infringement\", and introduce felony charges for unauthorized [[media streaming]]. These bills are aimed towards defeating websites that carry or contain links to infringing content, but have raised concerns about domestic abuse and internet censorship.\n\n=== Noncommercial file sharing ===\n\n==== Legality of downloading ====\nTo an extent, copyright law in some countries permits downloading copyright-protected content for personal, noncommercial use. Examples include [[Canada]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourinterview/2008/04/michael_geist.html |title=Your Interview: Michael Geist |date=2008-04-07 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412063751/http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourinterview/2008/04/michael_geist.html |archivedate=2008-04-12 |quote=Downloading music for personal, non-commercial purposes is arguably legal in Canada due to the private copying levy which places a levy on blank media such as blank CDs.

The Directive was not intended to legitimize file-sharing, but rather the common practice of [[space shifting]] copyright-protected content from a legally purchased [[compact disc|CD]] (for example) to certain kinds of devices and media, provided rights holders are compensated and no copy protection measures are circumvented. Rights-holder compensation takes various forms, depending on the country, but is generally either a levy on \"recording\" devices and media, or a tax on the content itself. In some countries, such as Canada, the applicability of such laws to copying onto general-purpose storage devices like computer hard drives, portable media players, and phones, for which no levies are collected, has been the subject of debate and further efforts to reform copyright law.\n\nIn some countries, the personal copying exemption explicitly requires that the content being copied was obtained legitimately \u2013 i.e., from authorized sources, not file-sharing networks. Other countries, such as the Netherlands, make no such distinction; the exemption there had been assumed, even by the government, to apply to any such copying, even from file-sharing networks. However, in April 2014, the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] ruled that \"national legislation which makes no distinction between private copies made from lawful sources and those made from counterfeited or pirated sources cannot be tolerated.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2014-04/cp140058en.pdf | date=April 10, 2014 |title=The amount of the levy payable for making private copies of a protected work may not take unlawful reproductions into account |publisher=Court of Justice of the European Union}}</ref>\n\n==== Legality of uploading ====\nAlthough downloading or other private copying is sometimes permitted, public distribution \u2013 by uploading or otherwise offering to share copyright-protected content \u2013 remains illegal in most, if not all countries. For example, in Canada, even though it was once legal to download any copyrighted file as long as it was for noncommercial use, it was still illegal to distribute the copyrighted files (e.g. by uploading them to a [[P2P network]]).<ref>{{cite news|date=2003-12-12|url=http://news.cnet.com/Canada+deems+P2P+downloading+legal/2100-1025_3-5121479.html?tag=st.rc.targ_mb\n|title=Canada deems P2P downloading legal|accessdate=2012-12-27|publisher=CNET News}}</ref>\n\n==== Relaxed penalties ====\nSome countries, like Canada and Germany, have limited the penalties for non-commercial copyright infringement. For example, Germany has passed a bill to limit the fine for individuals accused of sharing movies and series to \u20ac800-900. Canada's [[Copyright Modernization Act]] claims that statutory damages for non-commercial copyright infringement are capped at C$5,000 but this only applies to copies that have been made without the breaking of any \"digital lock\". However, this only applies to \"bootleg distribution\" and not non-commercial use.<ref>For a discussion, see [http://copyright.infringementadvisor.com/2012/11/5000-cap-on-non-commercial-copyright.html Copyright Infringement Advisor] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413150715/http://copyright.infringementadvisor.com/2012/11/5000-cap-on-non-commercial-copyright.html |date=2014-04-13 }} : ''Cap on Non-Commercial Copyright Damages''</ref>\n\n=== DMCA and anti-circumvention laws ===\nTitle I of the U.S. [[DMCA]], the [[WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act]] has provisions that prevent persons from \"circumvent[ing] a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work\".

The first laws on online intermediaries' liability were passed from the mid-1990s onwards.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nThe debate has shifted away from questions about liability for specific content, including that which may infringe copyright, towards whether online intermediaries should be ''generally'' responsible for content accessible through their services or infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web| last = Edwards| first = Lilian | last2 = Waelde| first2 = Charlotte| title = Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright Infringement| work = Keynote paper at WIPO Workshop on Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright, Geneva| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)| year = 2005| page = 5| url = http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/2305/1/wipo-onlineintermediaries.pdf| accessdate =1 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (1998) and the European [[E-Commerce Directive]] (2000) provide online intermediaries with limited statutory immunity from liability for copyright infringement. Online intermediaries hosting content that infringes copyright are not liable, so long as they do not know about it and take actions once the infringing content is brought to their attention. In U.S. law this is characterized as \"[[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]]\" provisions. Under European law, the governing principles for Internet Service Providers are \"mere conduit\", meaning that they are neutral 'pipes' with no knowledge of what they are carrying; and 'no obligation to monitor' meaning that they cannot be given a general mandate by governments to monitor content. These two principles are a barrier for certain forms of online copyright enforcement and they were the reason behind an attempt to amend the European [[Telecoms Package]] in 2009 to support new measures against copyright infringement.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Horten| first = Monica | title = The Copyright Enforcement Enigma&nbsp;\u2013 Internet Politics and the Telecoms Package | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year = 2012| pages = 104\u2013106| url = http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?PID=526246| isbn =978-0-230-32171-7}}</ref>\n\n==== Peer-to-peer issues ====\n[[Peer-to-peer file sharing]] intermediaries have been denied access to safe harbor provisions in relation to copyright infringement. Legal action against such intermediaries, such as [[Napster]], are generally brought in relation to principles of [[secondary liability]] for copyright infringement, such as [[contributory liability]] and [[vicarious liability]].<ref>{{cite web| last = Edwards| first = Lilian | last2 = Waelde| first2 = Charlotte| title = Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright Infringement| work = Keynote paper at WIPO Workshop on Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright, Geneva| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)| year = 2005| page = 10| url = http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/2305/1/wipo-onlineintermediaries.pdf| accessdate =1 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Torrentcomp small.gif|thumb|300px|alt=Animation showing seven remote computers exchanging data with an 8th (local) computer over a network |The [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent protocol]]: In this animation, the colored bars beneath all of the seven clients in the upper region above represent the file, with each color representing an individual piece of the file. After the initial pieces transfer from the seed (large system at the bottom), the pieces are individually transferred from client to client. The original ''seeder'' only needs to send out one copy of the file for all the clients to receive a copy.]]\n\nThese types of intermediaries do not host or transmit infringing content, themselves, but may be regarded in some courts as encouraging, enabling or facilitating infringement by users. These intermediaries may include the author, publishers and marketers of [[peer-to-peer]] networking software, and the websites that allow users to download such software. In the case of the BitTorrent protocol, intermediaries may include the [[torrent tracker]] and any websites or search engines which facilitate access to torrent files. Torrent files do not contain copyrighted content, but they may make reference to files that do, and they may point to trackers which coordinate the sharing of those files. Some torrent indexing and search sites, such as The Pirate Bay, now encourage the use of [[magnet URI scheme|magnet links]], instead of direct links to torrent files, creating another layer of indirection; using such links, torrent files are obtained from other peers, rather than from a particular website.\n\nSince the late 1990s, copyright holders have taken legal actions against a number of peer-to-peer intermediaries, such as pir, [[Grokster]], [[eMule]], [[SoulSeek]], [[BitTorrent (company)|BitTorrent]] and [[Limewire]], and case law on the liability of Internet service providers (ISPs) in relation to copyright infringement has emerged primarily in relation to these cases.<ref>{{cite web| last = Edwards| first = Lilian | last2 = Waelde| first2 = Charlotte| title = Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright Infringement| work = Keynote paper at WIPO Workshop on Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright, Geneva| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)| year = 2005| page = 7| url = http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/2305/1/wipo-onlineintermediaries.pdf| accessdate =1 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, whether and to what degree any of these types of intermediaries have secondary liability is the subject of ongoing litigation. The decentralised structure of [[peer-to-peer networks]], in particular, does not sit easily with existing laws on online intermediaries' liability. The BitTorrent protocol established an entirely decentralised network architecture in order to distribute large files effectively. Recent developments in peer-to-peer technology towards more complex network configurations are said to have been driven by a desire to avoid liability as intermediaries under existing laws.<ref>{{cite web| last = Edwards| first = Lilian | last2 = Waelde| first2 = Charlotte| title = Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright Infringement| work = Keynote paper at WIPO Workshop on Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright, Geneva| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)| year = 2005| page = 9| url = http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/2305/1/wipo-onlineintermediaries.pdf| accessdate =1 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\nCopyright law does not grant authors and publishers absolute control over the use of their work. Only certain types of works and kinds of uses are protected;<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Chris|title=Pirating copyrighted content is legal in Europe, if done correctly|url=http://bgr.com/2014/06/05/streaming-movies-and-tv-shows-for-free/|website=www.bgr.com|publisher=Boy Genius Report|accessdate=20 December 2014}}</ref> only unauthorized uses of protected works can be said to be infringing.\n\n=== Non-infringing uses ===\nArticle 10 of the Berne Convention mandates that national laws provide for limitations to copyright, so that copyright protection does not extend to certain kinds of uses that fall under what the treaty calls \"fair practice\", including but not limited to minimal quotations used in journalism and education.<ref name=Berne10>Berne Convention [http://zvon.org/law/r/bern.html#p~13 Article&nbsp;10], [http://zvon.org/law/r/bern.html#p~14 article 10bis].</ref> The laws implementing these [[limitations and exceptions to copyright|limitations and exceptions]] for uses that would otherwise be infringing broadly fall into the categories of either [[fair use]] or [[fair dealing]]. In common law systems, these fair practice statutes typically enshrine principles underlying many earlier judicial precedents,<!--see [[Copyright Act of 1976#Fair use]], also uncited--> and are considered essential to [[freedom of speech]].<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Eldred v.

Compulsory licensing laws generally say that for certain uses of certain works, no infringement occurs as long as a [[royalties|royalty]], at a rate determined by law rather than private negotiation, is paid to the copyright owner or representative [[copyright collective]].

That is, a copy of someone else's original idea is not infringing unless it copies that person's unique, tangible ''expression'' of the idea. Some of these limitations, especially regarding what qualifies as original, are embodied only in case law (judicial precedent), rather than in statutes.\n\nIn the U.S., for example, copyright case law contains a [[substantial similarity]] requirement to determine whether the work was copied. Likewise, courts may require computer software to pass an [[Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison test]] (AFC Test)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifosslr.org/ifosslr/article/download/30/54 |title=Copyright in Open Source Software&nbsp;\u2013 Understanding the Boundaries |publisher=Ifosslr.org |accessdate=2012-09-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linux.com/news/feature-8-cores-budget-building-better-workstation/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213110414/http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/113252|url-status=dead|title=Feature: 8 Cores on a Budget- Building a Better Workstation|date=September 11, 2008|archivedate=February 13, 2010}}</ref> to determine if it is too abstract to qualify for protection, or too dissimilar to an original work to be considered infringing. Software-related case law has also clarified that the amount of R&D, effort and expense put into a work's creation does not affect copyright protection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ladas.com/Patents/Computer/SoftwareAndCopyright/Softwa06.html#fn30 |title=3.3 The \"Abstraction, Filtration, Comparison\" Test |publisher=Ladas.com |accessdate=2012-01-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127214713/http://www.ladas.com/Patents/Computer/SoftwareAndCopyright/Softwa06.html#fn30 |archivedate=2012-01-27 }}</ref>\n\nEvaluation of alleged copyright infringement in a court of law may be substantial; the time and costs required to apply these tests vary based on the size and complexity of the copyrighted material. Furthermore, there is no standard or universally accepted test; some courts have rejected the AFC Test, for example, in favor of narrower criteria.\n\nThe POSAR test,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.igi-global.com/book/judiciary-friendly-forensics-software-copyright/94860|title=Judiciary-friendly forensics of software copyright infringement |publisher=IGI Global |accessdate=2014-04-14}}</ref> a recently devised forensic procedure for establishing software copyright infringement cases, is an extension or an enhancement of the AFC test.  POSAR, with its added features and additional facilities, offers something more to the legal and the judicial domain than what the AFC test offers. These additional features and facilities make the test more sensitive to the technical and legal requirements of software copyright infringement.\n\n== Preventive measures ==\nThe BSA outlined four strategies that governments can adopt to reduce software piracy rates in its 2011 piracy study results:\n\n* \"Increase public education and raise awareness about software piracy and IP rights in cooperation with industry and law enforcement.\"\n* \"Modernize protections for software and other copyrighted materials to keep pace with new innovations such as cloud computing and the proliferation of networked mobile devices.\"\n* \"Strengthen enforcement of IP laws with dedicated resources, including specialized enforcement units, training for law enforcement and judiciary officials, improved cross-border cooperation among law enforcement agencies, and fulfillment of obligations under the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).\"\n* \"Lead by example by using only fully licensed software, implementing software asset management (SAM) programs, and promoting the use of legal software in state-owned enterprises, and among all contractors and suppliers.\"<ref name=\"Study\" />\n\n=== Legal ===\nCorporations and legislatures take different types of preventive measures to deter copyright infringement, with much of the focus since the early 1990s being on preventing or reducing digital methods of infringement. Strategies include education, civil & criminal legislation, and international agreements,<ref name=\"Gopal\">Ram D. Gopal and G. Lawrence Sanders. \"International Software Piracy: Analysis of Key Issues and Impacts.\" Information Systems Research 9, no. 4 (December 1998): 380\u2013397.</ref> as well as publicizing anti-piracy litigation successes and imposing forms of digital media copy protection, such as controversial [[digital rights management|DRM]] technology and [[anti-circumvention]] laws, which limit the amount of control consumers have over the use of products and content they have purchased.\n\nLegislatures have reduced infringement by narrowing the scope of what is considered infringing. Aside from upholding international copyright treaty obligations to provide general limitations and exceptions,<ref name=Berne10 /> nations have enacted compulsory licensing laws applying specifically to digital works and uses. For example, in the U.S., the DMCA, an implementation of the 1996 [[WIPO Copyright Treaty]], considers digital transmissions of audio recordings to be licensed as long as a designated copyright collective's royalty and reporting requirements are met.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|17|514(f)\u2013(g)}}; see [[SoundExchange]].</ref> The DMCA also provides safe harbor for digital service providers whose users are suspected of copyright infringement, thus reducing the likelihood that the providers themselves will be considered directly infringing.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|17|512(a)\u2013(d)}}; see [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]].</ref>\n\nSome copyright owners voluntarily reduce the scope of what is considered infringement by employing relatively permissive, \"open\" licensing strategies: rather than privately negotiating license terms with individual users who must first seek out the copyright owner and ask for permission, the copyright owner publishes and distributes the work with a prepared license that anyone can use, as long as they adhere to certain conditions. This has the effect of reducing infringement \u2013 and the burden on courts \u2013 by simply permitting certain types of uses under terms that the copyright owner considers reasonable. Examples include [[free software license]]s, like the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), and the [[Creative Commons license]]s, which are predominantly applied to visual and literary works.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/|title=Creative Commons \u2013 About The Licenses|work=creativecommons.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Protected distribution ===\nTo prevent piracy of films, the standard drill of [[film distribution]] is to have a movie first released through [[movie theaters]] (theatrical window), on average approximately 16 and a half weeks,<ref name=\"wsj\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704337004575059713216224640|title=Movie Studios Push to Unlock DVD Release Dates \u2013 WSJ|author1 =Ethan Smith |author2 =Lauren A.

Retailers have lost over a billion dollars, while piracy has resulted in 46,000 fewer production-level jobs and almost 25,000 retail jobs.

In one decision, US District Court Judge [[James Parker Jones|James P. Jones]] found that the \"[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA's]] request problematically assumes that every illegal download resulted in a lost sale,\"<ref>United States of America v. Daniel Dove; the decision, entered November 7, 2008, can be viewed at http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/OPINIONS/JONES/207CR15REST.PDF</ref> indicating profit-loss estimates were likely extremely off.\n\nOther critics of industry estimates argue that those who use peer-to-peer sharing services, or practice \"piracy\" are actually more likely to pay for music. A [[Jupiter Research]] study in 2000 found that \"Napster users were 45 percent more likely to have increased their music purchasing habits than online music fans who don't use the software were.\"<ref>Aram Sinnreich, \"Digital Music Subscriptions: Post-Napster Product Formats,\" Jupiter Research (2000).</ref> This indicated that users of peer-to-peer sharing did not hurt the profits of the music industry, but in fact may have increased it.\n\nProfessor Aram Sinnreich, in his book ''The Piracy Crusade'', states that the connection between declining music sales and the creation of peer to peer file sharing sites such as Napster is tenuous, based on correlation rather than causation. He argues that the industry at the time was undergoing artificial expansion, what he describes as a \"'perfect bubble'\u2014a confluence of economic, political, and technological forces that drove the aggregate value of music sales to unprecedented heights at the end of the twentieth century\".\n\nSinnreich cites multiple causes for the [[economic bubble]], including the CD format replacement cycle; the shift from music specialty stores to wholesale suppliers of music and 'minimum advertised pricing'; and the economic expansion of 1991\u20132001. He believes that with the introduction of new digital technologies, the bubble burst, and the industry suffered as a result.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Piracy Crusade: How the Music Industry's War on Sharing Destroys Markets and Erodes Civil Liberties|last=Sinnreich|first=Aram|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-62534-052-8|location=|pages=94\u2013118}}</ref>\n\n=== Economic impact of infringement in emerging markets ===\nThe 2011 Business Software Alliance Piracy Study Standard, estimates the total commercial value of illegally copied software to be at $59 billion in 2010, with emerging markets accounting for $31.9 billion, over half of the total. Furthermore, mature markets for the first time received less PC shipments than emerging economies in 2010. In addition with software infringement rates of 68 percent comparing to 24 percent of mature markets, emerging markets thus possess the majority of the global increase in the commercial value of counterfeit software.

The copyright holder is typically the work's creator, or a publisher or other business to whom copyright has been assigned. Copyright holders routinely invoke legal and technological measures to prevent and penalize copyright infringement.\n\nCopyright infringement disputes are usually resolved through direct negotiation, a [[notice and take down]] process, or litigation in [[civil court]]. Egregious or large-scale commercial infringement, especially when it involves [[counterfeit]]ing, is sometimes prosecuted via the [[criminal justice]] system. Shifting public expectations, advances in digital technology, and the increasing reach of the Internet have led to such widespread, anonymous infringement that copyright-dependent industries now focus less on pursuing individuals who seek and share copyright-protected content online, and more on expanding copyright law to recognize and penalize, as indirect infringers, the service providers and software distributors who are said to facilitate and encourage individual acts of infringement by others.\n\nEstimates of the actual economic impact of copyright infringement vary widely and depend on many factors. Nevertheless, copyright holders, industry representatives, and legislators have long characterized copyright infringement as piracy or theft \u2013 language which some U.S. courts now regard as [[pejorative]] or otherwise contentious.<ref name=Dowling /><ref name=Hotfile_TF>{{Cite web\n  | title = MPAA Banned From Using Piracy and Theft Terms in Hotfile Trial\n  | accessdate = November 30, 2013\n  | url = http://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-banned-from-using-piracy-and-theft-terms-in-hotfile-trial-131129/| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131130144431/http://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-banned-from-using-piracy-and-theft-terms-in-hotfile-trial-131129/| archivedate= 30 November 2013| url-status= live| date = 2013-11-29\n }}</ref><ref name=Hotfile_TD>{{Cite web\n  | title = MPAA Banned From Using Piracy and Theft Terms in Hotfile Trial\n  | accessdate = November 30, 2013\n  | url = http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131130/15263725410/surprise-mpaa-told-it-cant-use-terms-piracy-theft-stealing-during-hotfile-trial.shtml| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131203072723/http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131130/15263725410/surprise-mpaa-told-it-cant-use-terms-piracy-theft-stealing-during-hotfile-trial.shtml| archivedate= 3 December 2013| url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe terms ''piracy'' and ''theft'' are often associated with copyright infringement.<ref name=\"Cara\" /><ref name=\"Nick\">{{cite web|title=Game of Thrones: Another case for piracy|url=http://www.abc.net.au/technology/articles/2014/04/08/3980980.htm|work=ABC technology+games|publisher=ABC|accessdate=21 April 2014|author=Nick Ross|date=8 April 2014}}</ref> The original meaning of ''[[wikt:piracy|piracy]]'' is \"robbery or illegal violence at sea\",<ref>{{cite web|title=piracy|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/piracy?s=t|work=Dictionary.com|publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC|accessdate=21 April 2014|year=2014}}</ref> but the term has been in use for centuries as a synonym for acts of copyright infringement.<ref name=\"Dekker\">T.

For example, major motion-picture corporation MGM Studios filed suit against P2P file-sharing services Grokster and Streamcast for their contributory role in copyright infringement.<ref>McDonald, Paul, and Janet Wasko. The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub., 2008. Print. p.202</ref> In 2005, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of MGM, holding that such services could be held liable for copyright infringement since they functioned and, indeed, willfully marketed themselves as venues for acquiring copyrighted movies. The ''[[MGM v. Grokster]]'' case did not overturn the earlier ''[[Sony v. Universal City Studios]]'' decision, but rather clouded the legal waters; future designers of software capable of being used for copyright infringement were warned.<ref>McDonald, Paul, and Janet Wasko.

If the work was produced under [[corporate authorship]] it may last 120 years after creation or 95 years after publication, whichever is sooner.\n\nArticle 50 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) requires that signatory countries enable [[court]]s to remedy copyright infringement with injunctions and the destruction of infringing products, and award damages.<ref name=\"Xuan_p208\" /> Some jurisdictions only allow actual, provable damages, and some, like the U.S., allow for large [[statutory damage]] awards intended to deter would-be infringers and allow for compensation in situations where actual damages are difficult to prove.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, copyright or the right to enforce it can be contractually assigned to a third party which did not have a role in producing the work. When this outsourced litigator appears to have no intention of taking any copyright infringement cases to trial, but rather only takes them just far enough through the legal system to identify and exact settlements from suspected infringers, critics commonly refer to the party as a \"[[copyright troll]]\".

Maximum penalties can be five years in [[prison]] and up to $250,000 in [[Fine (penalty)|fines]]. The NET Act also raised [[statutory damages for copyright infringement|statutory damages]] by 50%. The court's ruling explicitly drew attention to the shortcomings of current law that allowed people to facilitate mass copyright infringement while being immune to prosecution under the [[Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act]].\n\nProposed laws such as the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] broaden the definition of \"willful infringement\", and introduce felony charges for unauthorized [[media streaming]]. These bills are aimed towards defeating websites that carry or contain links to infringing content, but have raised concerns about domestic abuse and internet censorship.\n\n=== Noncommercial file sharing ===\n\n==== Legality of downloading ====\nTo an extent, copyright law in some countries permits downloading copyright-protected content for personal, noncommercial use.

The Directive was not intended to legitimize file-sharing, but rather the common practice of [[space shifting]] copyright-protected content from a legally purchased [[compact disc|CD]] (for example) to certain kinds of devices and media, provided rights holders are compensated and no copy protection measures are circumvented. Rights-holder compensation takes various forms, depending on the country, but is generally either a levy on \"recording\" devices and media, or a tax on the content itself. In some countries, such as Canada, the applicability of such laws to copying onto general-purpose storage devices like computer hard drives, portable media players, and phones, for which no levies are collected, has been the subject of debate and further efforts to reform copyright law.\n\nIn some countries, the personal copying exemption explicitly requires that the content being copied was obtained legitimately \u2013 i.e., from authorized sources, not file-sharing networks. Other countries, such as the Netherlands, make no such distinction; the exemption there had been assumed, even by the government, to apply to any such copying, even from file-sharing networks. However, in April 2014, the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] ruled that \"national legislation which makes no distinction between private copies made from lawful sources and those made from counterfeited or pirated sources cannot be tolerated.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2014-04/cp140058en.pdf | date=April 10, 2014 |title=The amount of the levy payable for making private copies of a protected work may not take unlawful reproductions into account |publisher=Court of Justice of the European Union}}</ref>\n\n==== Legality of uploading ====\nAlthough downloading or other private copying is sometimes permitted, public distribution \u2013 by uploading or otherwise offering to share copyright-protected content \u2013 remains illegal in most, if not all countries. For example, in Canada, even though it was once legal to download any copyrighted file as long as it was for noncommercial use, it was still illegal to distribute the copyrighted files (e.g. by uploading them to a [[P2P network]]).<ref>{{cite news|date=2003-12-12|url=http://news.cnet.com/Canada+deems+P2P+downloading+legal/2100-1025_3-5121479.html?tag=st.rc.targ_mb\n|title=Canada deems P2P downloading legal|accessdate=2012-12-27|publisher=CNET News}}</ref>\n\n==== Relaxed penalties ====\nSome countries, like Canada and Germany, have limited the penalties for non-commercial copyright infringement. For example, Germany has passed a bill to limit the fine for individuals accused of sharing movies and series to \u20ac800-900. Canada's [[Copyright Modernization Act]] claims that statutory damages for non-commercial copyright infringement are capped at C$5,000 but this only applies to copies that have been made without the breaking of any \"digital lock\".

The first laws on online intermediaries' liability were passed from the mid-1990s onwards.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nThe debate has shifted away from questions about liability for specific content, including that which may infringe copyright, towards whether online intermediaries should be ''generally'' responsible for content accessible through their services or infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web| last = Edwards| first = Lilian | last2 = Waelde| first2 = Charlotte| title = Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright Infringement| work = Keynote paper at WIPO Workshop on Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright, Geneva| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)| year = 2005| page = 5| url = http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/2305/1/wipo-onlineintermediaries.pdf| accessdate =1 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (1998) and the European [[E-Commerce Directive]] (2000) provide online intermediaries with limited statutory immunity from liability for copyright infringement. Online intermediaries hosting content that infringes copyright are not liable, so long as they do not know about it and take actions once the infringing content is brought to their attention. In U.S. law this is characterized as \"[[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]]\" provisions. Under European law, the governing principles for Internet Service Providers are \"mere conduit\", meaning that they are neutral 'pipes' with no knowledge of what they are carrying; and 'no obligation to monitor' meaning that they cannot be given a general mandate by governments to monitor content. These two principles are a barrier for certain forms of online copyright enforcement and they were the reason behind an attempt to amend the European [[Telecoms Package]] in 2009 to support new measures against copyright infringement.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Horten| first = Monica | title = The Copyright Enforcement Enigma&nbsp;\u2013 Internet Politics and the Telecoms Package | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year = 2012| pages = 104\u2013106| url = http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?PID=526246| isbn =978-0-230-32171-7}}</ref>\n\n==== Peer-to-peer issues ====\n[[Peer-to-peer file sharing]] intermediaries have been denied access to safe harbor provisions in relation to copyright infringement. Legal action against such intermediaries, such as [[Napster]], are generally brought in relation to principles of [[secondary liability]] for copyright infringement, such as [[contributory liability]] and [[vicarious liability]].<ref>{{cite web| last = Edwards| first = Lilian | last2 = Waelde| first2 = Charlotte| title = Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright Infringement| work = Keynote paper at WIPO Workshop on Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright, Geneva| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)| year = 2005| page = 10| url = http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/2305/1/wipo-onlineintermediaries.pdf| accessdate =1 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Torrentcomp small.gif|thumb|300px|alt=Animation showing seven remote computers exchanging data with an 8th (local) computer over a network |The [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent protocol]]: In this animation, the colored bars beneath all of the seven clients in the upper region above represent the file, with each color representing an individual piece of the file.

These intermediaries may include the author, publishers and marketers of [[peer-to-peer]] networking software, and the websites that allow users to download such software. In the case of the BitTorrent protocol, intermediaries may include the [[torrent tracker]] and any websites or search engines which facilitate access to torrent files. Torrent files do not contain copyrighted content, but they may make reference to files that do, and they may point to trackers which coordinate the sharing of those files. Some torrent indexing and search sites, such as The Pirate Bay, now encourage the use of [[magnet URI scheme|magnet links]], instead of direct links to torrent files, creating another layer of indirection; using such links, torrent files are obtained from other peers, rather than from a particular website.\n\nSince the late 1990s, copyright holders have taken legal actions against a number of peer-to-peer intermediaries, such as pir, [[Grokster]], [[eMule]], [[SoulSeek]], [[BitTorrent (company)|BitTorrent]] and [[Limewire]], and case law on the liability of Internet service providers (ISPs) in relation to copyright infringement has emerged primarily in relation to these cases.<ref>{{cite web| last = Edwards| first = Lilian | last2 = Waelde| first2 = Charlotte| title = Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright Infringement| work = Keynote paper at WIPO Workshop on Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright, Geneva| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)| year = 2005| page = 7| url = http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/2305/1/wipo-onlineintermediaries.pdf| accessdate =1 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, whether and to what degree any of these types of intermediaries have secondary liability is the subject of ongoing litigation. The decentralised structure of [[peer-to-peer networks]], in particular, does not sit easily with existing laws on online intermediaries' liability. The BitTorrent protocol established an entirely decentralised network architecture in order to distribute large files effectively. Recent developments in peer-to-peer technology towards more complex network configurations are said to have been driven by a desire to avoid liability as intermediaries under existing laws.<ref>{{cite web| last = Edwards| first = Lilian | last2 = Waelde| first2 = Charlotte| title = Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright Infringement| work = Keynote paper at WIPO Workshop on Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright, Geneva| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)| year = 2005| page = 9| url = http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/2305/1/wipo-onlineintermediaries.pdf| accessdate =1 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\nCopyright law does not grant authors and publishers absolute control over the use of their work.

Compulsory licensing laws generally say that for certain uses of certain works, no infringement occurs as long as a [[royalties|royalty]], at a rate determined by law rather than private negotiation, is paid to the copyright owner or representative [[copyright collective]].

That is, a copy of someone else's original idea is not infringing unless it copies that person's unique, tangible ''expression'' of the idea. Some of these limitations, especially regarding what qualifies as original, are embodied only in case law (judicial precedent), rather than in statutes.\n\nIn the U.S., for example, copyright case law contains a [[substantial similarity]] requirement to determine whether the work was copied. Likewise, courts may require computer software to pass an [[Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison test]] (AFC Test)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifosslr.org/ifosslr/article/download/30/54 |title=Copyright in Open Source Software&nbsp;\u2013 Understanding the Boundaries |publisher=Ifosslr.org |accessdate=2012-09-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linux.com/news/feature-8-cores-budget-building-better-workstation/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213110414/http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/113252|url-status=dead|title=Feature: 8 Cores on a Budget- Building a Better Workstation|date=September 11, 2008|archivedate=February 13, 2010}}</ref> to determine if it is too abstract to qualify for protection, or too dissimilar to an original work to be considered infringing.

Furthermore, there is no standard or universally accepted test; some courts have rejected the AFC Test, for example, in favor of narrower criteria.\n\nThe POSAR test,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.igi-global.com/book/judiciary-friendly-forensics-software-copyright/94860|title=Judiciary-friendly forensics of software copyright infringement |publisher=IGI Global |accessdate=2014-04-14}}</ref> a recently devised forensic procedure for establishing software copyright infringement cases, is an extension or an enhancement of the AFC test.  POSAR, with its added features and additional facilities, offers something more to the legal and the judicial domain than what the AFC test offers. These additional features and facilities make the test more sensitive to the technical and legal requirements of software copyright infringement.\n\n== Preventive measures ==\nThe BSA outlined four strategies that governments can adopt to reduce software piracy rates in its 2011 piracy study results:\n\n* \"Increase public education and raise awareness about software piracy and IP rights in cooperation with industry and law enforcement.\"\n* \"Modernize protections for software and other copyrighted materials to keep pace with new innovations such as cloud computing and the proliferation of networked mobile devices.\"\n* \"Strengthen enforcement of IP laws with dedicated resources, including specialized enforcement units, training for law enforcement and judiciary officials, improved cross-border cooperation among law enforcement agencies, and fulfillment of obligations under the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).\"\n* \"Lead by example by using only fully licensed software, implementing software asset management (SAM) programs, and promoting the use of legal software in state-owned enterprises, and among all contractors and suppliers.\"<ref name=\"Study\" />\n\n=== Legal ===\nCorporations and legislatures take different types of preventive measures to deter copyright infringement, with much of the focus since the early 1990s being on preventing or reducing digital methods of infringement. Strategies include education, civil & criminal legislation, and international agreements,<ref name=\"Gopal\">Ram D. Gopal and G. Lawrence Sanders. \"International Software Piracy: Analysis of Key Issues and Impacts.\" Information Systems Research 9, no. 4 (December 1998): 380\u2013397.</ref> as well as publicizing anti-piracy litigation successes and imposing forms of digital media copy protection, such as controversial [[digital rights management|DRM]] technology and [[anti-circumvention]] laws, which limit the amount of control consumers have over the use of products and content they have purchased.\n\nLegislatures have reduced infringement by narrowing the scope of what is considered infringing. Aside from upholding international copyright treaty obligations to provide general limitations and exceptions,<ref name=Berne10 /> nations have enacted compulsory licensing laws applying specifically to digital works and uses. For example, in the U.S., the DMCA, an implementation of the 1996 [[WIPO Copyright Treaty]], considers digital transmissions of audio recordings to be licensed as long as a designated copyright collective's royalty and reporting requirements are met.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|17|514(f)\u2013(g)}}; see [[SoundExchange]].</ref> The DMCA also provides safe harbor for digital service providers whose users are suspected of copyright infringement, thus reducing the likelihood that the providers themselves will be considered directly infringing.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|17|512(a)\u2013(d)}}; see [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]].</ref>\n\nSome copyright owners voluntarily reduce the scope of what is considered infringement by employing relatively permissive, \"open\" licensing strategies: rather than privately negotiating license terms with individual users who must first seek out the copyright owner and ask for permission, the copyright owner publishes and distributes the work with a prepared license that anyone can use, as long as they adhere to certain conditions. This has the effect of reducing infringement \u2013 and the burden on courts \u2013 by simply permitting certain types of uses under terms that the copyright owner considers reasonable. Examples include [[free software license]]s, like the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), and the [[Creative Commons license]]s, which are predominantly applied to visual and literary works.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/|title=Creative Commons \u2013 About The Licenses|work=creativecommons.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Protected distribution ===\nTo prevent piracy of films, the standard drill of [[film distribution]] is to have a movie first released through [[movie theaters]] (theatrical window), on average approximately 16 and a half weeks,<ref name=\"wsj\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704337004575059713216224640|title=Movie Studios Push to Unlock DVD Release Dates \u2013 WSJ|author1 =Ethan Smith |author2 =Lauren A.

According to the study, musicians and those involved in the recording industry are not the only ones who experience losses attributed to music piracy. Retailers have lost over a billion dollars, while piracy has resulted in 46,000 fewer production-level jobs and almost 25,000 retail jobs. The U.S. government was also reported to suffer from music piracy, losing $422 million in tax revenue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.informationweek.com/music-piracy-costs-us-economy-125-billio/201801704|title=Music Piracy Costs U.S. Economy $12.5 Billion, Report Reveals|website=InformationWeek}}</ref>\n\nA 2007 study in the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'' found that the effect of  music downloads on legal music sales was \"statistically indistinguishable from zero\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oberholzer-Gee |first1=Felix |title=The Effect of File Sharing on Record Sales: An Empirical Analysis |journal=Journal of Political Economy |date=February 2007 |volume=115 |issue=1 |page=1\u201342 |doi=10.1086/511995|hdl=1808/10115 |url=https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/1808/10115/1/The%20Effect%20of%20File%20Sharing%20on%20Record%20Sales%20-%20An%20Empirical%20Analysis.pdf }}</ref>\n\nA report from 2013, released by the European Commission [[Joint Research Centre]] suggests that illegal music downloads have almost no effect on the number of legal music downloads.  The study analyzed the behavior of 16,000 European music consumers and found that although music piracy negatively affects offline music sales, illegal music downloads had a positive effect on legal music purchases. Without illegal downloading, legal purchases were about two percent lower.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/about/jrc-site/seville|title=The JRC in Seville (Spain)|first=Dominique|last=DELEHAYE|date=November 19, 2013|website=EU Science Hub \u2013 European Commission}}</ref>\n\nThe study has received criticism, particularly from  the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]], which believes the study is flawed and misleading. One argument against the research is that many music consumers only download music illegally. The IFPI also points out that music piracy affects not only online music sales but also multiple facets of the music industry, which is not addressed in the study.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/03/21/illegal-music-downloads-not-hurting-industry-study-claims/|title=Illegal Music Downloads Not Hurting Industry, Study Claims|first=Lily|last=Rothman|via=entertainment.time.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Media industry estimates ===\nIn March 2019, a [[New York Times]] article reported that the Qatar-based [[beIN Media Group]] suffered \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d of losses, following the unilateral cancellation of an exclusive contract it shared with the [[Asian Football Confederation]] for the past 10 years. The decision by A.F.C. to invalidate its license for broadcasting rights to air games in [[Saudi Arabia]] came after the kingdom was accused of leading a piracy operation through its television broadcaster, [[beoutQ]], misappropriating sports content owned by [[beIN Sports]] since 2017, worth billions of dollars.<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/sports/bein-media-qatar-saudi-arabia.html|title=Feud Over Soccer Piracy Deepens as A.F.C.

The report named as many as 13 countries, including Argentina, Brazil, China, Ecuador, India, Indonesia and also included [[Saudi Arabia]] for the first time. The report said piracy is \"causing considerable harm to EU businesses\" and high economic losses have occurred in Argentina, China, Ecuador and India. It also informed Saudi Arabia has not \"taken  sufficient  steps  to  stop  the  infringement\" caused via [[BeoutQ]], like other countries have to minimize the extent of financial and economic loss.<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2020/01/28/european-commission-calls-out-saudi-arabia-for-sports-piracy/|title=European Commission calls out Saudi Arabia for sports piracy|accessdate=28 January 2020|website=Broadband TV News}}</ref>\n\n=== Criticism of industry estimates ===\nThe methodology of studies utilized by industry spokespeople has been heavily criticized. Inflated claims for damages and allegations of economic harm are common in copyright disputes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100511/1516059386.shtml |title=If It's May It's Time For The Press To Parrot Bogus Stats Announcement From The BSA |publisher=Techdirt |date=2010-05-12 |accessdate=2012-01-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090527/1125035034.shtml |title=BSA's Canadian Piracy Numbers Based On Hunches, Not Actual Surveys |publisher=Techdirt |date=2009-05-27 |accessdate=2012-01-27}}</ref> Some studies and figures, including those cited by the MPAA and RIAA with regards to the economic effects of film and music downloads, have been widely disputed as based on questionable assumptions which resulted in statistically unsound numbers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reid|first=Robert|title=The numbers behind the Copyright Math|url=http://blog.ted.com/2012/03/20/the-numbers-behind-the-copyright-math/|date=March 20, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Salmon|first=Felix E.|title=Beware Copyright Statistics|url=http://upstart.bizjournals.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2007/10/04/beware-copyright-statistics.html?page=all |date=October 4, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn one extreme example, the RIAA claimed damages against [[LimeWire]] totaling $75 trillion&nbsp;\u2013 more than the global GDP&nbsp;\u2013 and \"respectfully\" disagreed with the judge's ruling that such claims were \"absurd\".<ref>{{cite web|last= Vijayan|first=Jaikumar|title=Judge rules punitive damages against LimeWire 'absurd'|url=http://news.techworld.com/sme/3267255/judge-rules-punitive-damages-against-limewire-absurd/|date=28 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nHowever, this $75 trillion figure is obtained through one specific interpretation of copyright law that would count each song downloaded as an infringement of copyright. After the conclusion of the case, LimeWire agreed to pay $105 million to RIAA.<ref>{{cite news|title=LimeWire Settlement: RIAA, Record Labels Win $105M, But Artists May Not Benefit|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/17/riaa-and-record-labels-wi_n_862725.html|publisher=Huffington Post | first=Travis|last=Korte|date=2011-05-17}}</ref>\n\nThe judicial system has also found flaws in industry estimates and calculations. In one decision, US District Court Judge [[James Parker Jones|James P. Jones]] found that the \"[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA's]] request problematically assumes that every illegal download resulted in a lost sale,\"<ref>United States of America v. Daniel Dove; the decision, entered November 7, 2008, can be viewed at http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/OPINIONS/JONES/207CR15REST.PDF</ref> indicating profit-loss estimates were likely extremely off.\n\nOther critics of industry estimates argue that those who use peer-to-peer sharing services, or practice \"piracy\" are actually more likely to pay for music. A [[Jupiter Research]] study in 2000 found that \"Napster users were 45 percent more likely to have increased their music purchasing habits than online music fans who don't use the software were.\"<ref>Aram Sinnreich, \"Digital Music Subscriptions: Post-Napster Product Formats,\" Jupiter Research (2000).</ref> This indicated that users of peer-to-peer sharing did not hurt the profits of the music industry, but in fact may have increased it.\n\nProfessor Aram Sinnreich, in his book ''The Piracy Crusade'', states that the connection between declining music sales and the creation of peer to peer file sharing sites such as Napster is tenuous, based on correlation rather than causation. He argues that the industry at the time was undergoing artificial expansion, what he describes as a \"'perfect bubble'\u2014a confluence of economic, political, and technological forces that drove the aggregate value of music sales to unprecedented heights at the end of the twentieth century\".\n\nSinnreich cites multiple causes for the [[economic bubble]], including the CD format replacement cycle; the shift from music specialty stores to wholesale suppliers of music and 'minimum advertised pricing'; and the economic expansion of 1991\u20132001. He believes that with the introduction of new digital technologies, the bubble burst, and the industry suffered as a result.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Piracy Crusade: How the Music Industry's War on Sharing Destroys Markets and Erodes Civil Liberties|last=Sinnreich|first=Aram|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-62534-052-8|location=|pages=94\u2013118}}</ref>\n\n=== Economic impact of infringement in emerging markets ===\nThe 2011 Business Software Alliance Piracy Study Standard, estimates the total commercial value of illegally copied software to be at $59 billion in 2010, with emerging markets accounting for $31.9 billion, over half of the total. Furthermore, mature markets for the first time received less PC shipments than emerging economies in 2010. In addition with software infringement rates of 68 percent comparing to 24 percent of mature markets, emerging markets thus possess the majority of the global increase in the commercial value of counterfeit software. China continues to have the highest commercial value of such software at $8.9 billion among developing countries and second in the world behind the US at $9.7 billion in 2011.<ref>{{cite web| title = Shadow Market: 2011 BSA Global Software Piracy Study| url = http://globalstudy.bsa.org/2011/downloads/study_pdf/2011_BSA_Piracy_Study-Standard.pdf| publisher = Business Software Alliance| year = 2012| page = 4| accessdate = 1 April 2013| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131101095612/http://globalstudy.bsa.org/2011/downloads/study_pdf/2011_BSA_Piracy_Study-Standard.pdf| archive-date = 1 November 2013| url-status = dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_sof_pir_rat-crime-software-piracy-rate |title=Software piracy rate statistics&nbsp;\u2013 countries compared |publisher=Nation Master |accessdate=2012-01-27}}</ref> In 2011, the Business Software Alliance announced that 83 percent of software deployed on PCs in [[Africa]] has been pirated (excluding South Africa).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://torrentfreak.com/software-piracy-110822/ |title=Software Piracy (Infographic) |date=August 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\nSome countries distinguish corporate piracy from private use, which is tolerated as a welfare service.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} This is the leading reason developing countries refuse to accept or respect copyright laws.
