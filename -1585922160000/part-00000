Additionally, most passages are printed in the same size type, in order not to lend the impression that some prayers are more important than others (see similar re the [[Birnbaum siddur]]).\n\nNew prayers recognizing the rebirth of the State of [[Israel]] have been added, including a [[Prayer for the Welfare of the State of Israel]], a Prayer for the Soldiers of The [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]], and a service for [[Israel Independence Day]].\n\nRinat Yisrael has been published in three different versions, or ''[[Nusach|Nuschaot]]'': [[Nusach Ashkenaz|Ashkenaz]] (published in both Israel and Diaspora versions), [[Nusach Sefard|Sefard]], and [[Sephardic]] / [[Edot HaMizrach]]. Rabbi [[Amram Aburbeh]] edited the latter.  The siddurim are published in various sizes.\n\nAlong with the siddur, other publications in the Rinat Yisrael series include [[machzor]]im for [[Rosh Hashanah]], [[Yom Kippur]], [[Sukkot]], [[Pesach]], and [[Shavuot]]; a [[haggadah]]; a book of [[selichot]], and a book of ''[[kinnot]]'' for [[Tisha B'av]].

To further this goal, Rinat Yisrael uses a large [[typeface]], a modern, easy to read [[font]] ([[:he:\u05e4\u05e8\u05e0\u05e7-\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4\u05dc|Frank-R\u00fchl]]) and uses special symbols to denote which syllable a word is accented on. Also included are references to verses quoted from the [[Tanakh]], and translations of difficult words, including passages in [[Aramaic]], into [[modern Hebrew]]. Additionally, most passages are printed in the same size type, in order not to lend the impression that some prayers are more important than others (see similar re the [[Birnbaum siddur]]).\n\nNew prayers recognizing the rebirth of the State of [[Israel]] have been added, including a [[Prayer for the Welfare of the State of Israel]], a Prayer for the Soldiers of The [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]], and a service for [[Israel Independence Day]].\n\nRinat Yisrael has been published in three different versions, or ''[[Nusach|Nuschaot]]'': [[Nusach Ashkenaz|Ashkenaz]] (published in both Israel and Diaspora versions), [[Nusach Sefard|Sefard]], and [[Sephardic]] / [[Edot HaMizrach]]. Rabbi [[Amram Aburbeh]] edited the latter.  The siddurim are published in various sizes.\n\nAlong with the siddur, other publications in the Rinat Yisrael series include [[machzor]]im for [[Rosh Hashanah]], [[Yom Kippur]], [[Sukkot]], [[Pesach]], and [[Shavuot]]; a [[haggadah]]; a book of [[selichot]], and a book of ''[[kinnot]]'' for [[Tisha B'av]]. These are all produced in different versions, as the prayer book above.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Koren Siddur]]\n\n[[Category:Siddur versions]]\n[[Category:Religious_Zionism]]\n[[Category:1970 non-fiction books]]\n", "name_user": "Fintor", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinat_Yisrael"}
