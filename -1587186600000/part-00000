Unlike the company's previous virtual assistant, [[Google Now]], the Google Assistant can engage in two-way conversations.\n\nAssistant initially debuted in May 2016 as part of Google's messaging app [[Google Allo|Allo]], and its voice-activated speaker [[Google Home]]. After a period of exclusivity on the [[Pixel (smartphone)|Pixel and Pixel XL]] smartphones, it began to be deployed on other [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices in February 2017, including third-party smartphones and Android Wear (now [[Wear OS]]), and was released as a standalone app on the [[iOS]] operating system in May 2017. Alongside the announcement of a [[software development kit]] in April 2017, the Assistant has been further extended to support a large variety of devices, including cars and third party smart home appliances. The functionality of the Assistant can also be enhanced by third-party developers.\n\nUsers primarily interact with the Google Assistant through [[natural language processing|natural voice]], though keyboard input is also supported. In the same nature and manner as Google Now, the Assistant is able to search the Internet, schedule events and alarms, adjust hardware settings on the user's device, and show information from the user's Google account. Google has also announced that the Assistant will be able to identify objects and gather visual information through the device's camera, and support purchasing products and sending money, as well as identifying songs.\n\nAt [[CES 2018]], the first Assistant-powered smart displays ([[smart speakers]] with video screens) were announced, with the first one being released in July 2018.<ref

The voice in the assistant has been able to add expression to the games. For instance, in the Crystal Ball game the voice would speak slow and soft during the intro and before the answer is revealed to make the game more excitable and in the Lucky Trivia game the voice would become excitable like a game show host. In the British accent voice of Crystal Ball, the voice would say the word 'probably' in a downwards slide like she's not too sure. The games used the text to speech voice which makes the voice more robotic. In May 2019 however, it turned out to be a bug in the speech API that caused the games to lose the studio quality voices. These audio games were fixed on May 20th 2019.\n\nOn December 12, 2019, Google rolled out its interpreter mode for iOS and Android Google Assistant smartphone apps.

Alongside the announcement of a [[software development kit]] in April 2017, the Assistant has been further extended to support a large variety of devices, including cars and third party smart home appliances. The functionality of the Assistant can also be enhanced by third-party developers.\n\nUsers primarily interact with the Google Assistant through [[natural language processing|natural voice]], though keyboard input is also supported.

The voice in the assistant has been able to add expression to the games. For instance, in the Crystal Ball game the voice would speak slow and soft during the intro and before the answer is revealed to make the game more excitable and in the Lucky Trivia game the voice would become excitable like a game show host.

In addition to the sense in which God is \"Father\" to all men because he created the world (and in that sense \"fathered\" the world), the same God is also uniquely the law-giver to his [[chosen people]]. He maintains a special, [[covenant (Biblical)|covenantal]] father-child relationship with the people, giving them the [[Shabbat]], stewardship of his [[prophecy|prophecies]], and a unique heritage in the things of God, calling Israel \"my son\" because he delivered the descendants of Jacob out of slavery in Egypt {{Bibleref2c|Hosea|11:1|NIV}} according to his covenants and oaths to their fathers, [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]]. In the [[Hebrew Bible]], in Isaiah 63:16 (JP) it reads: \"For You are our father, for Abraham did not know us, neither did Israel recognize us; You, O [YHWH], are our father; our redeemer of old is your name.\" To God, according to Judaism, is attributed the fatherly role of protector. He is titled the Father of the poor, of the orphan and the widow, their guarantor of justice. He is also titled the Father of the king, as the teacher and helper over the judge of Israel.<ref>Marianne Meye Thompson, ''The promise of the Father: Jesus and God in the New Testament'' ch. 2 God as Father in the Old Testament and Second Temple Judaism p.35 2000. \"Christian theologians have often accentuated the distinctiveness of the portrait of God as Father in the New Testament on the basis of an alleged discontinuity.\"</ref>\n\nAccording to Alon Goshen-Gottstein, in the Old Testament \"Father\" is generally a [[metaphor]]; it is not a proper [[Name of God in Judaism|name for God]] but rather one of many titles by which Jews speak of and to God. In Christianity fatherhood is taken in a more literal and substantive sense, and is explicit about the need for the Son as a means of accessing the Father, making for a more [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] rather than metaphorical interpretation.<ref name=metaphor>{{cite web|url=http://www.elijah-interfaith.org/uploads/media/god_the_father_in_rabbinic_judaism_and_christianity_01.pdf|title=God the Father in Rabbinic Judaism and Christianity: Transformed Background or Common Ground?, Alon Goshen-Gottstein.

In addition to the sense in which God is \"Father\" to all men because he created the world (and in that sense \"fathered\" the world), the same God is also uniquely the law-giver to his [[chosen people]]. He maintains a special, [[covenant (Biblical)|covenantal]] father-child relationship with the people, giving them the [[Shabbat]], stewardship of his [[prophecy|prophecies]], and a unique heritage in the things of God, calling Israel \"my son\" because he delivered the descendants of Jacob out of slavery in Egypt {{Bibleref2c|Hosea|11:1|NIV}} according to his covenants and oaths to their fathers, [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]]. In the [[Hebrew Bible]], in Isaiah 63:16 (JP) it reads: \"For You are our father, for Abraham did not know us, neither did Israel recognize us; You, O [YHWH], are our father; our redeemer of old is your name.\" To God, according to Judaism, is attributed the fatherly role of protector. He is titled the Father of the poor, of the orphan and the widow, their guarantor of justice. He is also titled the Father of the king, as the teacher and helper over the judge of Israel.<ref>Marianne Meye Thompson, ''The promise of the Father: Jesus and God in the New Testament'' ch. 2 God as Father in the Old Testament and Second Temple Judaism p.35 2000. \"Christian theologians have often accentuated the distinctiveness of the portrait of God as Father in the New Testament on the basis of an alleged discontinuity.\"</ref>\n\nAccording to Alon Goshen-Gottstein, in the Old Testament \"Father\" is generally a [[metaphor]]; it is not a proper [[Name of God in Judaism|name for God]] but rather one of many titles by which Jews speak of and to God. In Christianity fatherhood is taken in a more literal and substantive sense, and is explicit about the need for the Son as a means of accessing the Father, making for a more [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] rather than metaphorical interpretation.<ref name=metaphor>{{cite web|url=http://www.elijah-interfaith.org/uploads/media/god_the_father_in_rabbinic_judaism_and_christianity_01.pdf|title=God the Father in Rabbinic Judaism and Christianity: Transformed Background or Common Ground?, Alon Goshen-Gottstein.

Western art eventually required some way to illustrate the presence of the Father, so through successive representations a set of artistic styles for the depiction of the Father in human form gradually emerged around the tenth century [[Common Era|CE]].<ref name=\"Cornwell2\" />\n\nBy the twelfth century depictions of a figure of God the Father, essentially based on the [[Ancient of Days]] in the [[Book of Daniel]] had started to appear in French manuscripts and in stained glass church windows in England. In the 14th century the illustrated [[Naples Bible]] had a depiction of God the Father in the [[Burning bush]]. By the 15th century, the [[Rohan Book of Hours]] included depictions of God the Father in human form or [[anthropomorphic]] imagery.  The depiction remains rare and often controversial in [[Eastern Orthodox]] art, and by the time of the [[Renaissance]] artistic representations of God the Father were freely used in the Western Church.<ref>George Ferguson, 1996 ''Signs & symbols in Christian art'' {{ISBN|0195014324}} p. 92</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons|God the Father}}\n* [[Divine filiation]]\n* [[God Alone]]\n* [[Eugenia Elisabetta Ravasio]]\n* [[Sabellianism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Christian theology|state=uncollapsed}}\n{{Names of God}}\n[[Category:Biblical phrases]]\n[[Category:Creator gods]]\n[[Category:Conceptions of God]]\n[[Category:Names of God]]\n[[Category:Patriology]]\n[[Category:Trinitarianism]]\n", "name_user": "BD2412", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eB\u00e0i Sh\u00e0ngd\u00ec Hu\u00ec:Fixing links to disambiguation pages, improving links, other minor cleanup tasks", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_the_Father"}

And when his armies failed to take Liao-tung Fortress (modern Liao-yang), the anchor of Kogury\u014f's first line of defense, he had a nearly a third of his forces, some 300,000 strong, break off the battle there and strike directly at the Kogury\u014f capital of P'y\u014fngyang. But the Sui army was lured into a trap by the famed Kogury\u014f commander \u016clchi Mund\u014fk, and suffered a calamitous defeat at the Salsu (Ch'\u014fngch'\u014fn) River. It is said that only 2,700 of the 300,000 Sui soldiers who had crossed the Yalu survived to find their way back, and the Sui emperor now lifted the siege of Liao-tung Fortress and withdrew his forces to China proper. Yang Ti continued to send his armies against Kogury\u014f but again without success, and before long his war-weakened empire crumbled.|year=1984}}</ref><ref name=\"Nahm\">{{cite book|last1=Nahm|first1=Andrew C.|title=A Panorama of 5000 Years: Korean History|date=2005|publisher=Hollym International Corporation|location=Seoul|isbn=978-0-930878-68-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/panoramaof5000ye0000nahm/page/18 18]|edition=Second revised|quote=China, which had been split into many states since the early 3rd century, was reunified by the Sui dynasty at the end of the 6th century.

However, the people of Kogury\u014f were united and they were able to repel the Chinese aggressors. In 612, Sui troops invaded Korea again, but Kogury\u014f forces fought bravely and destroyed Sui troops everywhere. General \u016clchi Mund\u014fk of Kogury\u014f completely wiped out some 300,000 Sui troops which came across the Yalu River in the battles near the Salsu River (now Ch'\u014fngch'\u014fn River) with his ingenious military tactics.

At the time, the Soviet Union had boycotted the United Nations (UN), thus forfeiting their veto rights. This allowed the UN to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior North Korean forces would unify the entire country. The Soviet Union and China backed North Korea, with the later participation of millions of [[People's Volunteer Army|Chinese troops]]. After an ebb and flow that saw both sides almost pushed to the brink of extinction, and massive losses among Korean civilians in both the north and the south, the war eventually reached a stalemate.

This was followed by 13 months of political instability as South Korea was led by a weak and ineffectual government.  This instability was broken by the [[May 16 coup|May 16, 1961, coup]] led by General [[Park Chung-hee]]. As president, Park oversaw a period of rapid [[Export-oriented industrialization|export-led economic growth]] enforced by political repression.\n\nPark was heavily criticized as a ruthless military dictator, who in 1972 extended his rule by creating a [[Yusin Constitution|new constitution]], which gave the president sweeping (almost dictatorial) powers and permitted him to run for an unlimited number of six-year terms. The [[Economy of South Korea|Korean economy]] developed significantly during Park's tenure.  The government developed the [[Expressways in South Korea|nationwide expressway system]], the [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway|Seoul subway system]], and laid the foundation for economic development during his 17-year tenure, which ended with [[Assassination of Park Chung-hee|his assassination]] in 1979.\n\nThe years after Park's assassination were marked again by political turmoil, as the previously suppressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void. In 1979 there came the [[Coup d'\u00e9tat of December Twelfth]] led by General [[Chun Doo-hwan]]. Following the Coup d'\u00e9tat, Chun Doo-hwan planned to rise to power through several measures. On May 17, Chun Doo-hwan forced the Cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation, which had previously not applied to the island of [[Jejudo]]. The expanded martial law closed universities, banned political activities and further curtailed the press. Chun's assumption of the presidency in the events of May 17, triggered nationwide protests demanding democracy, in particular in the city of [[Gwangju]], to which Chun sent special forces to violently suppress the [[Gwangju massacre|Gwangju Democratization Movement]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/752055.stm Flashback: The Kwangju massacre], May 17, 2000.</ref>\n\nChun subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee and took the presidency according to his political plan. Chun and his government held South Korea under a despotic rule until 1987, when a [[Seoul National University]] student, [[Bak Jongcheol|Park Jong-chul]], was tortured to death.<ref>[http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/184219.html \"20 years later, father still seeks truth in son's death\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303173203/http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/184219.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}, ''The Hankyoreh'', January 15, 2007.

Ingredients and dishes vary by province. There are many significant regional dishes that have proliferated in different variations across the country in the present day. The [[Korean royal court cuisine]] once brought all of the unique regional specialties together for the royal family. Meals consumed both by the royal family and ordinary Korean citizens have been regulated by a unique culture of etiquette.\n\nKorean cuisine is largely based on [[rice]], [[noodle]]s, [[tofu]], vegetables, fish and meats. Traditional Korean meals are noted for the number of side dishes, ''[[banchan]]'' (\ubc18\ucc2c), which accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Every meal is accompanied by numerous banchan. [[Kimchi]] (\uae40\uce58), a fermented, usually spicy vegetable dish is commonly served at every meal and is one of the best known Korean dishes. Korean cuisine usually involves heavy seasoning with [[sesame oil]], ''[[doenjang]]'' (\ub41c\uc7a5), a type of [[fermented bean paste|fermented soybean paste]], [[Korean soy sauce|soy sauce]], salt, garlic, ginger, and ''[[gochujang]]'' (\uace0\ucd94\uc7a5), a hot pepper paste. Other well-known dishes are ''[[Bulgogi]]'' (\ubd88\uace0\uae30), grilled marinated beef, ''[[Gimbap]]'' (\uae40\ubc25), and ''[[Tteokbokki]]'' (\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774), a spicy snack consisting of rice cake seasoned with gochujang or a spicy chili paste.\n\nSoups are also a common part of a Korean meal and are served as part of the main course rather than at the beginning or the end of the meal. Soups known as ''[[guk]]'' (\uad6d) are often made with meats, shellfish and vegetables. Similar to guk, ''tang'' (\ud0d5; \u6e6f) has less water, and is more often served in restaurants. Another type is ''[[jjigae]]'' (\ucc0c\uac1c), a [[stew]] that is typically heavily seasoned with chili pepper and served boiling hot.\n\nPopular [[Korean alcoholic beverages]] include [[Soju]], [[Makgeolli]] and [[Bokbunja ju]].\n\nKorea is unique among East Asian countries in its use of metal [[chopstick]]s. Metal chopsticks have been discovered in Goguryeo archaeological sites.<ref>[http://article.joins.com/news/blognews/article.asp?listid=12803159 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\ub294 \ub3d9\uc5913\uad6d\uc758 \uc813\uac00\ub77d \ubb38\ud654\ube44\uad50].

Many K-pop acts have also been able secure a strong overseas following using online social media platforms such as the video sharing website [[YouTube]]. South Korean singer [[PSY]] became an international sensation when his song \"[[Gangnam Style]]\" topped global music charts in 2012. <!--Do not add a list of groups here without first suggesting it at the Talk page.-->\n\nSince the success of the film ''[[Shiri (film)|Shiri]]'' in 1999, the [[Korean film]] industry has begun to gain recognition internationally. Domestic film has a dominant share of the market, partly because of the existence of [[screen quotas]] requiring cinemas to show Korean films at least 73 days a year.<ref>[http://rki.kbs.co.kr/english/news/news_Ec_detail.htm?No=74142 \"S.Korea's Screen Quota Hinders Market Access\"], KBS World, July 16, 2010.</ref>\n\n[[Television in South Korea|South Korean television shows]] have become popular outside of Korea.

The Sui emperor, Wen Ti, launched a retaliatory attack on Kogury\u014f but met with reverses and turned back in mid-course. Yang Ti, the next Sui emperor, proceeded in 612 to mount an invasion of unprecedented magnitude, marshalling a huge force said to number over a million men. And when his armies failed to take Liao-tung Fortress (modern Liao-yang), the anchor of Kogury\u014f's first line of defense, he had a nearly a third of his forces, some 300,000 strong, break off the battle there and strike directly at the Kogury\u014f capital of P'y\u014fngyang. But the Sui army was lured into a trap by the famed Kogury\u014f commander \u016clchi Mund\u014fk, and suffered a calamitous defeat at the Salsu (Ch'\u014fngch'\u014fn) River. It is said that only 2,700 of the 300,000 Sui soldiers who had crossed the Yalu survived to find their way back, and the Sui emperor now lifted the siege of Liao-tung Fortress and withdrew his forces to China proper.

At the time, the Soviet Union had boycotted the United Nations (UN), thus forfeiting their veto rights. This allowed the UN to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior North Korean forces would unify the entire country. The Soviet Union and China backed North Korea, with the later participation of millions of [[People's Volunteer Army|Chinese troops]]. After an ebb and flow that saw both sides almost pushed to the brink of extinction, and massive losses among Korean civilians in both the north and the south, the war eventually reached a stalemate. During the war, Rhee's party promoted the [[Ilminism|One-People Principle]] (based on the German [[ideology]] of the ''[[Master race|Herrenvolk]]'') an effort to build an obedient citizenry through [[ethnicity|ethnic]] homogeneity and authoritarian appeals to [[nationalism]].<ref name=Hwang93>Su-kyoung Hwang, ''Korea's Grievous War.''

This was followed by 13 months of political instability as South Korea was led by a weak and ineffectual government.  This instability was broken by the [[May 16 coup|May 16, 1961, coup]] led by General [[Park Chung-hee]]. As president, Park oversaw a period of rapid [[Export-oriented industrialization|export-led economic growth]] enforced by political repression.\n\nPark was heavily criticized as a ruthless military dictator, who in 1972 extended his rule by creating a [[Yusin Constitution|new constitution]], which gave the president sweeping (almost dictatorial) powers and permitted him to run for an unlimited number of six-year terms. The [[Economy of South Korea|Korean economy]] developed significantly during Park's tenure.  The government developed the [[Expressways in South Korea|nationwide expressway system]], the [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway|Seoul subway system]], and laid the foundation for economic development during his 17-year tenure, which ended with [[Assassination of Park Chung-hee|his assassination]] in 1979.\n\nThe years after Park's assassination were marked again by political turmoil, as the previously suppressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void. In 1979 there came the [[Coup d'\u00e9tat of December Twelfth]] led by General [[Chun Doo-hwan]]. Following the Coup d'\u00e9tat, Chun Doo-hwan planned to rise to power through several measures. On May 17, Chun Doo-hwan forced the Cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation, which had previously not applied to the island of [[Jejudo]]. The expanded martial law closed universities, banned political activities and further curtailed the press. Chun's assumption of the presidency in the events of May 17, triggered nationwide protests demanding democracy, in particular in the city of [[Gwangju]], to which Chun sent special forces to violently suppress the [[Gwangju massacre|Gwangju Democratization Movement]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/752055.stm Flashback: The Kwangju massacre], May 17, 2000.</ref>\n\nChun subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee and took the presidency according to his political plan.

Ingredients and dishes vary by province. There are many significant regional dishes that have proliferated in different variations across the country in the present day. The [[Korean royal court cuisine]] once brought all of the unique regional specialties together for the royal family. Meals consumed both by the royal family and ordinary Korean citizens have been regulated by a unique culture of etiquette.\n\nKorean cuisine is largely based on [[rice]], [[noodle]]s, [[tofu]], vegetables, fish and meats. Traditional Korean meals are noted for the number of side dishes, ''[[banchan]]'' (\ubc18\ucc2c), which accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Every meal is accompanied by numerous banchan. [[Kimchi]] (\uae40\uce58), a fermented, usually spicy vegetable dish is commonly served at every meal and is one of the best known Korean dishes. Korean cuisine usually involves heavy seasoning with [[sesame oil]], ''[[doenjang]]'' (\ub41c\uc7a5), a type of [[fermented bean paste|fermented soybean paste]], [[Korean soy sauce|soy sauce]], salt, garlic, ginger, and ''[[gochujang]]'' (\uace0\ucd94\uc7a5), a hot pepper paste. Other well-known dishes are ''[[Bulgogi]]'' (\ubd88\uace0\uae30), grilled marinated beef, ''[[Gimbap]]'' (\uae40\ubc25), and ''[[Tteokbokki]]'' (\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774), a spicy snack consisting of rice cake seasoned with gochujang or a spicy chili paste.\n\nSoups are also a common part of a Korean meal and are served as part of the main course rather than at the beginning or the end of the meal. Soups known as ''[[guk]]'' (\uad6d) are often made with meats, shellfish and vegetables. Similar to guk, ''tang'' (\ud0d5; \u6e6f) has less water, and is more often served in restaurants. Another type is ''[[jjigae]]'' (\ucc0c\uac1c), a [[stew]] that is typically heavily seasoned with chili pepper and served boiling hot.\n\nPopular [[Korean alcoholic beverages]] include [[Soju]], [[Makgeolli]] and [[Bokbunja ju]].\n\nKorea is unique among East Asian countries in its use of metal [[chopstick]]s. Metal chopsticks have been discovered in Goguryeo archaeological sites.<ref>[http://article.joins.com/news/blognews/article.asp?listid=12803159 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\ub294 \ub3d9\uc5913\uad6d\uc758 \uc813\uac00\ub77d \ubb38\ud654\ube44\uad50].

Many K-pop acts have also been able secure a strong overseas following using online social media platforms such as the video sharing website [[YouTube]].

After the failure of these negotiations, GoPro entered into an agreement with [[3D Robotics]] (3DR) for a similar partnership based on 3DR's flight controllers. 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines.

The HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called \"SuperView\") which increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.) etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30\u201350% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.\n\nThe Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10 MP stills at up to 10 fps.<ref>[http://gopro.com/cameras/hd-hero3-silver-edition HERO3+ Silver Edition]</ref> In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%\u201350% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination, and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras.

The HERO7 Silver was intended as the mid-range camera, featuring 4K resolutions for video and time-lapse video resolutions and WDR in its photo mode. Initially, both the HERO7 White and Silver defaulted to a video resolution of 1440p with 1080p only available by cropping.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://community.gopro.com/t5/Cameras/GoPro-Hero-7-White-Resolution-Change/m-p/256828#M74643|title=GoPro Hero 7 White Resolution Change|date=2018-11-01|website=community.gopro.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> This was met with considerable criticism, of which GoPro responded by releasing software updates to both cameras to allow for change in default resolution to 1080p.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gopro.com/en/hk/update/hero7-silver|title=HERO7 SILVER|website=gopro.com|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> In contrast to the HERO7 Black, these cameras lacked most time-lapse photo modes, ProTune, wake-on-voice capabilities, H.265 formats and live-streaming.\n\nBy contrast, the HERO7 Black was introduced at the high-end level and primarily encompasses the features of the HERO6 Black with major improvements.   The HERO7 Black introduced a heavily improved electronic image stabilisation known as \"HyperSmooth\" video stabilization, which GoPro has advertised heavily as \"Gimbal-Like\", as its primary improvement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gopro.com/help/articles/block/what-is-hypersmooth|website=gopro.com|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> This feature has resulted in a new time-lapse video feature known as \"TimeWarp\", essentially a hyperlapse mode, although the original time-lapse video mode continues to remain. The HERO7 Black also introduced a live-streaming feature that would live-stream content, in 720p, directly from the HERO7 Black to the user's social media account, provided the user keeps a nearby internet-connected device.\n\nDuring its release, the HERO7 Black largely competed with rival camera and camera accessory manufacturer [[DJI (company)|DJI]] which released the DJI OSMO Action, which also introduced a similar enhanced stabilization feature. \n\nOn February 28, 2019, GoPro released HERO7 Black in a new \"dusk white\" color.

Most notably, the \"HyperSmooth\" feature introduced in the HERO7 Black was improved on and named \"HyperSmooth 2.0\", also resulting in an improvement of the TimeWarp feature introduced in the HERO7 Black. The HERO8 Black also improved the image quality, improving the HDR functions of the camera to allow HDR to assist the SuperPhoto function of the camera that automatically chooses what image processing to use such as high dynamic range (HDR). GoPro also reintroduced the field-of-view (FOV) functionality as, \"Digital Lenses\" which retains the original SuperView, Wide, Narrow, Linear FOV settings. Moreover, live-streaming now streams in 1080p instead of the HERO7 Black's 720p and the RAW imaging functionality has now been expanded for all photo modes. \n\nThe HERO8 Black largely introduced several new functions into the camera. Physically, the HERO8 Black now incorporates the connecting prongs that are used to connect accessories, directly onto the camera. Originally, the cameras would only be able to access the prongs if the cameras utilised either the frames (for cameras HERO5 to HERO7) or the protective cases for HERO4 and before. Moreover, the GoPro logo moved under the LCD screen to make way for extra microphones. More additions to the camera most notably were part of the software aspects of the camera. These included an option to switch between various settings presets, including standard, activity, cinematic and action shots and adjusting on-screen shortcuts of the user interface. Most notably as part of software, was the introduction of the night-lapse video, which similar to the time-lapse video mode, automatically stitches the frames captured by the camera at set intervals, however with the addition of improved low-light performance.  \n\nThe HERO8 Black also attempts to address vloggers who may wish to use the GoPro in such a manner. As such, GoPro has also introduced an external accessory known as the \"Media Mod\" which includes a USB Type-C port for supplying power to external microphones and accessories, a micro-HDMI port and a 3.5mm microphone port. Moreover, the accessory includes a mount to connect either external microphones, LEDs or an LCD screen.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Model !!

The available resolutions are 4K60, 2.7K120 and 1080p240 unstabilized or 4K30, 2.7K60 and 1080p120 digitally stabilized.\n\n==Microphone support==\nThe following cameras have official external microphone support: <ref>[https://gopro.com/help/articles/question_answer/External-Microphone-Recommendations]</ref>\n* HERO 8\n* HERO7 Black\n* HERO6 Black\n* HERO5 Black\n* HERO5 Session\n* HERO4 Black\n* HERO3+\n* HERO3\n\nThe following cameras lack official support for an external microphone: \n* HERO (2018)\n* HERO (2014)\n* HERO+\n* HERO+LCD\n* HERO4 Session\n\nCameras up to and including the HERO 4 series can use a simple 3.5mm to Mini-USB adapter to connect external microphones and other audio sources. Starting with the HERO 5 Black, the digital-to-analogue converter is no longer part of the camera itself, and instead relies on an external USB-C Audio Adapter manufactured and sold by GoPro. Although simpler models exist, they do not trigger the required menu item in the camera to enable external sources, and hence do not provide an audio signal. The adapter provides an option to connect audio and power simultaneously. \n\nWhile the adapter still works with HERO 8 cameras, the battery door needs to be removed to expose the USB-C port. This can lead to power loss during operation when the camera is subjected to minor vibrations. Third party doors are available that expose the port while holding the battery firmly in place. GoPro's own Media Mod also provides access to an external audio source.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV)\n* [[Egocentric vision]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|GoPro}}\n* {{Official website}}\n*Video [http://www.peachpit.com/promotions/gopro-videos-140450 gallery to show methods and examples] for book, ''GoPro Professional Filmmaking'' (2015 Peachpit Press).\n\n[[Category:2002 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Action cameras]]\n[[Category:Camcorders]]\n[[Category:Photography companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies based in San Mateo, California]]\n[[Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Technology companies established in 2002]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 2002]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Video surveillance companies]]\n[[Category:2014 initial public offerings]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date=September 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2019}}\n{{short description|American technology company}}\n{{about|the company|the song|Ride On (Texas Hippie Coalition album) }}\n{{Infobox company\n| name = GoPro, Inc.hh\n| logo = GoPro logo light.svg\n| former_names = Woodman Labs, Inc.\n| type = [[Public company|Public]]\n| traded_as = {{NASDAQ|GPRO}} (Class A)<br>[[Russell 2000 Index|Russell 2000 Component]]\n| industry = {{flatlist|\n*[[Technology]]\n*[[Videography]]\n*[[Consumer electronics]]\n}}\n| foundation = {{Start date and age|2002}}\n| founder = [[Nick Woodman]]\n| location_city = [[San Mateo, California|San Mateo]], [[California]]\n| area_served = Worldwide\n| key_people = {{plainlist|\n*[[Nick Woodman]] ([[Chief executive officer|CEO]])\n}}\n| products = {{flatlist|\n*[[Action camera]]\n*[[Video editing software]]\n*[[Mobile app]]\n}}\n| brands = Authentic design logo Andi Nugraha [[alt]]{{dn|date=March 2020}}\n| revenue = {{decrease}} [[United States dollar|US$]]1.18 billion (2017)<ref name=\"2017results\">{{cite web|title=GoPro Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Results |url=https://investor.gopro.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2018/GoPro-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2017-Results/default.aspx |publisher=GoPro |accessdate=April 3, 2018 |location=San Mateo, California |date=February 1, 2018}}</ref>\n| operating_income = {{decrease}} \u2212US$163.46 million (2017)<ref name=\"2017results\" />\n| net_income = {{decrease}} \u2212US$182.87 million (2017)<ref name=\"2017results\" />\n| assets = {{decrease}} US$0.85 billion (2017)<ref name=\"2017results\" />\n| equity = \n| num_employees = 964 (2019)\n| divisions = \n| subsid = {{plainlist|\n*[[CineForm]]\n*Replay\n*Splice\n}}\n| location_country = [[United States|U.S.]]\n| homepage = {{URL|https://www.gopro.com}}\n}}\n\n'''GoPro, Inc.'''<ref name=\"sec-filing\">{{cite web|title= FORM S-1 REGISTRATION STATEMENT \u2013 GOPRO, INC. |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000119312514204902/d552193ds1.htm |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] |access-date= May 21, 2014}}</ref> (marketed as '''GoPro''' and sometimes stylized as '''GoPRO''') is an [[United States|American]] [[technology]] company founded in 2002 by [[Nick Woodman]].

After the failure of these negotiations, GoPro entered into an agreement with [[3D Robotics]] (3DR) for a similar partnership based on 3DR's flight controllers. 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines.

The HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called \"SuperView\") which increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.) etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30\u201350% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.\n\nThe Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10 MP stills at up to 10 fps.<ref>[http://gopro.com/cameras/hd-hero3-silver-edition HERO3+ Silver Edition]</ref> In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%\u201350% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination, and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras.

The HERO7 Silver was intended as the mid-range camera, featuring 4K resolutions for video and time-lapse video resolutions and WDR in its photo mode. Initially, both the HERO7 White and Silver defaulted to a video resolution of 1440p with 1080p only available by cropping.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://community.gopro.com/t5/Cameras/GoPro-Hero-7-White-Resolution-Change/m-p/256828#M74643|title=GoPro Hero 7 White Resolution Change|date=2018-11-01|website=community.gopro.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> This was met with considerable criticism, of which GoPro responded by releasing software updates to both cameras to allow for change in default resolution to 1080p.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gopro.com/en/hk/update/hero7-silver|title=HERO7 SILVER|website=gopro.com|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> In contrast to the HERO7 Black, these cameras lacked most time-lapse photo modes, ProTune, wake-on-voice capabilities, H.265 formats and live-streaming.\n\nBy contrast, the HERO7 Black was introduced at the high-end level and primarily encompasses the features of the HERO6 Black with major improvements.   The HERO7 Black introduced a heavily improved electronic image stabilisation known as \"HyperSmooth\" video stabilization, which GoPro has advertised heavily as \"Gimbal-Like\", as its primary improvement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gopro.com/help/articles/block/what-is-hypersmooth|website=gopro.com|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> This feature has resulted in a new time-lapse video feature known as \"TimeWarp\", essentially a hyperlapse mode, although the original time-lapse video mode continues to remain. The HERO7 Black also introduced a live-streaming feature that would live-stream content, in 720p, directly from the HERO7 Black to the user's social media account, provided the user keeps a nearby internet-connected device.\n\nDuring its release, the HERO7 Black largely competed with rival camera and camera accessory manufacturer [[DJI (company)|DJI]] which released the DJI OSMO Action, which also introduced a similar enhanced stabilization feature. \n\nOn February 28, 2019, GoPro released HERO7 Black in a new \"dusk white\" color.

Most notably, the \"HyperSmooth\" feature introduced in the HERO7 Black was improved on and named \"HyperSmooth 2.0\", also resulting in an improvement of the TimeWarp feature introduced in the HERO7 Black. The HERO8 Black also improved the image quality, improving the HDR functions of the camera to allow HDR to assist the SuperPhoto function of the camera that automatically chooses what image processing to use such as high dynamic range (HDR). GoPro also reintroduced the field-of-view (FOV) functionality as, \"Digital Lenses\" which retains the original SuperView, Wide, Narrow, Linear FOV settings. Moreover, live-streaming now streams in 1080p instead of the HERO7 Black's 720p and the RAW imaging functionality has now been expanded for all photo modes. \n\nThe HERO8 Black largely introduced several new functions into the camera. Physically, the HERO8 Black now incorporates the connecting prongs that are used to connect accessories, directly onto the camera. Originally, the cameras would only be able to access the prongs if the cameras utilised either the frames (for cameras HERO5 to HERO7) or the protective cases for HERO4 and before. Moreover, the GoPro logo moved under the LCD screen to make way for extra microphones. More additions to the camera most notably were part of the software aspects of the camera. These included an option to switch between various settings presets, including standard, activity, cinematic and action shots and adjusting on-screen shortcuts of the user interface. Most notably as part of software, was the introduction of the night-lapse video, which similar to the time-lapse video mode, automatically stitches the frames captured by the camera at set intervals, however with the addition of improved low-light performance.  \n\nThe HERO8 Black also attempts to address vloggers who may wish to use the GoPro in such a manner. As such, GoPro has also introduced an external accessory known as the \"Media Mod\" which includes a USB Type-C port for supplying power to external microphones and accessories, a micro-HDMI port and a 3.5mm microphone port. Moreover, the accessory includes a mount to connect either external microphones, LEDs or an LCD screen.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Model !!

The available resolutions are 4K60, 2.7K120 and 1080p240 unstabilized or 4K30, 2.7K60 and 1080p120 digitally stabilized.\n\n==Microphone support==\nThe following cameras have official external microphone support: <ref>[https://gopro.com/help/articles/question_answer/External-Microphone-Recommendations]</ref>\n* HERO 8\n* HERO7 Black\n* HERO6 Black\n* HERO5 Black\n* HERO5 Session\n* HERO4 Black\n* HERO3+\n* HERO3\n\nThe following cameras lack official support for an external microphone: \n* HERO (2018)\n* HERO (2014)\n* HERO+\n* HERO+LCD\n* HERO4 Session\n\nCameras up to and including the HERO 4 series can use a simple 3.5mm to Mini-USB adapter to connect external microphones and other audio sources. Starting with the HERO 5 Black, the digital-to-analogue converter is no longer part of the camera itself, and instead relies on an external USB-C Audio Adapter manufactured and sold by GoPro. Although simpler models exist, they do not trigger the required menu item in the camera to enable external sources, and hence do not provide an audio signal. The adapter provides an option to connect audio and power simultaneously. \n\nWhile the adapter still works with HERO 8 cameras, the battery door needs to be removed to expose the USB-C port. This can lead to power loss during operation when the camera is subjected to minor vibrations. Third party doors are available that expose the port while holding the battery firmly in place. GoPro's own Media Mod also provides access to an external audio source.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV)\n* [[Egocentric vision]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|GoPro}}\n* {{Official website}}\n*Video [http://www.peachpit.com/promotions/gopro-videos-140450 gallery to show methods and examples] for book, ''GoPro Professional Filmmaking'' (2015 Peachpit Press).\n\n[[Category:2002 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Action cameras]]\n[[Category:Camcorders]]\n[[Category:Photography companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies based in San Mateo, California]]\n[[Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Technology companies established in 2002]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 2002]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Video surveillance companies]]\n[[Category:2014 initial public offerings]]\n", "name_user": "BD2412", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIPO:Fixing links to disambiguation pages, improving links, other minor cleanup tasks", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoPro"}
