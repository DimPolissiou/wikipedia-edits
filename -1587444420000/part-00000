They were also involved in the arts.

Depew was the nephew of [[Chauncey Depew]], President of [[New York Central]] and [[United States Senator]] from New York from 1900&ndash;1911. Ganson was admitted to the bar in 1887, but stopped practicing law to work for his father-in-law and became Manager of [[Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad|Goodyear Lumber Co.]], Vice-President of [[Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad|Buffalo and Susquehanna Coal]], and assistant to the President of the [[Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad]].<ref name=\"Canisius College Press\"/> \n(2) Josephine Goodyear, who married George Montgomery Sicard in 1900. Sicard came from [[Utica, New York]]; his paternal uncle, George J. Sicard, was a partner of ''Cleveland, Bissell & Sicard'', and later of Goodyear's firm of ''Bissell, Sicard & Goodyear''. George Sicard attended [[Yale University]], entering with the class of 1894, and leaving at the end of his freshman year to attend the [[University of the State of New York]], where he received his LL.B. in 1895. He moved to Buffalo where he began practice with ''Moot, Sprague & Brownell''. After his marriage to Josephine, he went to work for the Goodyear companies. Josephine died in 1904. Soon afterward Sicard, who purportedly did not get along well with his father-in-law Frank Goodyear, resigned from the Goodyear companies and moved to [[Pelham Manor]] for the last 30 years of his life.<ref name=\"Canisius College Press\"/> \n(3) Florence Goodyear, who married George Olds Wagner in 1902 in Buffalo. Florence attended the now defunct Saint Margaret's School, Buffalo, and finishing school in New York City. Wagner was a graduate of [[Cornell University]].<ref name=\"Canisius College Press\"/> \n(4) Frank Henry Goodyear, Jr., who married Dorothy Knox. Dorothy was the daughter of [[Seymour H. Knox I|Seymour]] and Grace Knox. Knox was known for forming the [[F. W. Woolworth Company]] with his cousin [[Frank Winfield Woolworth]], and held prominent positions in the [[Marine Midland Bank|Marine Trust Co]]. The Knoxes lived in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[East Aurora, New York|East Aurora]]. They had a winter cottage on [[Jekyll Island, Georgia]]. After Frank Jr. died in 1930, his widow Dorothy Knox Goodyear later married Edmund Pendleton Rogers (1882&ndash;1966) in 1931.\n\n*Frank Jr.'s son, Frank Henry Goodyear, III, was known as \"Frank Goodyear, Sr.\" He graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1941, and served at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] during [[World War II]].
