With about 4,600 officers and 1,600 civilian staff, it is the second largest municipal police agency in Canada after the [[Toronto Police Service]] and second largest in the province behind the [[S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n==History==\nThe Montreal Police Service was created on March 15, 1843. At that time, there were 51 police officers in Montreal. The first officers did not wear uniforms. In order to be recognizable as police officers by civilians, the first uniforms were created in 1848. In 1853, they won the right to carry firearms in the performance of their duties.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, the Montreal Police Service counted 467 constables, inspectors and managers. The force was subdivided, as squads of morality and local departments were created.\n\nThe size of the police force remained roughly the same from the beginning of the century until 1930, when it hired more staff in the context of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]]. During the [[Great Depression]], tens of thousands of workers lost their jobs and there was an increase in crime. In the late 1930s, the Montreal Police Service had about 1,500 employees.\n\nFollowing the progress of scientific analysis, a mobile laboratory was created in 1957. It evolved and changed in the 1980s to become the technical section.\n\nThe Museum of the Montreal Police ({{lang-fr|Mus\u00e9e de la police de Montr\u00e9al}}) was established in 1992 to preserve the history of the Montreal Police Service.<ref name=\"Museum\">{{cite web|title=Mus\u00e9e de la police: About the Museum|url=http://www.spvm.qc.ca/en/documentation/3_7_1_a_propos_du_musee.asp|publisher=Service de Police de la Ville de Montr\u00e9al|accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Chiefs of Police===\n[[File:Pierre Belanger - directeur du Service de la police de Montreal de 1921 a 1928.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Pierre B\u00e9langer, Director from 1921 to 1928]]\nThe following is a list of the Chiefs and Directors of the Service de police de la Ville de Montr\u00e9al.<ref name=\"Chefs-Directeurs\">{{cite web|title=Chefs/Directeurs de police de la Ville de Montr\u00e9al|url=http://www.spvm.qc.ca/upload/documentations/Chefs-Directeurs-de-police-de-Montreal_.pdf|publisher=Service de police de la Ville de Montr\u00e9al|accessdate=10 February 2014}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

With about 4,600 officers and 1,600 civilian staff, it is the second largest municipal police agency in Canada after the [[Toronto Police Service]] and second largest in the province behind the [[S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n==History==\nThe Montreal Police Service was created on March 15, 1843. At that time, there were 51 police officers in Montreal. The first officers did not wear uniforms. In order to be recognizable as police officers by civilians, the first uniforms were created in 1848. In 1853, they won the right to carry firearms in the performance of their duties.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, the Montreal Police Service counted 467 constables, inspectors and managers. The force was subdivided, as squads of morality and local departments were created.\n\nThe size of the police force remained roughly the same from the beginning of the century until 1930, when it hired more staff in the context of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]]. During the [[Great Depression]], tens of thousands of workers lost their jobs and there was an increase in crime. In the late 1930s, the Montreal Police Service had about 1,500 employees.\n\nFollowing the progress of scientific analysis, a mobile laboratory was created in 1957. It evolved and changed in the 1980s to become the technical section.\n\nThe Museum of the Montreal Police ({{lang-fr|Mus\u00e9e de la police de Montr\u00e9al}}) was established in 1992 to preserve the history of the Montreal Police Service.<ref name=\"Museum\">{{cite web|title=Mus\u00e9e de la police: About the Museum|url=http://www.spvm.qc.ca/en/documentation/3_7_1_a_propos_du_musee.asp|publisher=Service de Police de la Ville de Montr\u00e9al|accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Chiefs of Police===\n[[File:Pierre Belanger - directeur du Service de la police de Montreal de 1921 a 1928.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Pierre B\u00e9langer, Director from 1921 to 1928]]\nThe following is a list of the Chiefs and Directors of the Service de police de la Ville de Montr\u00e9al.<ref name=\"Chefs-Directeurs\">{{cite web|title=Chefs/Directeurs de police de la Ville de Montr\u00e9al|url=http://www.spvm.qc.ca/upload/documentations/Chefs-Directeurs-de-police-de-Montreal_.pdf|publisher=Service de police de la Ville de Montr\u00e9al|accessdate=10 February 2014}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

McCarty has been known more for his fists than his scoring ability, taking on the role of the Red Wings [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcer]] most of his career, a role in which he won the [[Stanley Cup]] four times in [[1997 Stanley Cup Finals|1997]], [[1998 Stanley Cup Finals|1998]], [[2002 Stanley Cup Finals|2002]], and [[2008 Stanley Cup Finals|2008]], the last of which after resurrecting his career in the Red Wings minor league system.\n\nMcCarty spent much of his childhood in the small town of [[Leamington, Ontario]], playing for the Southpoint Capitals ([[Ontario Minor Hockey Association|OMHA]]) minor teams.\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Belleville Bulls===\nMcCarty played for the [[Belleville Bulls]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League]] from 1989 through 1992. As captain of the team during the [[1991-92 OHL season|1991-92 season]], McCarty recorded 55 goals and 72 assists for 127 points in 65 games. He was awarded the [[Jim Mahon Memorial Trophy]] as the top scoring [[Winger (ice hockey)|right winger]].\n\n===Detroit Red Wings===\n\nDrafted in the 2nd round, 49th overall, by the Red Wings in the [[1992 NHL Entry Draft]], McCarty scored 26 points in his rookie season as the Wings won the Central Division title. In the [[1996\u201397 NHL season]], McCarty scored a career best 19 goals and 42 points as the Wings [[1997 Stanley Cup Finals|swept]] the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] for their first [[Stanley Cup]] in 42 years. McCarty scored the Cup-clinching goal in Game 4. This goal, scored on an inside-outside move around a Flyers' defenseman ([[Janne Niinimaa]]), and goalie ([[Ron Hextall]]), was honored as one of the best goals of the year.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o93Hxjt-fcA]\n\nFrom the [[1997\u201398 NHL season|1997\u201398 season]] until his departure from the team, McCarty was part of Detroit's famous [[Grind Line]] with [[Centre (ice hockey)|center]] [[Kris Draper]] and [[winger (ice hockey)|winger]] [[Kirk Maltby]], which was often matched up against the opponent's top offensive line.\n\nOne of McCarty's most infamous moments was in the famous \"[[Red Wings \u2013 Avalanche brawl|Fight Night at the Joe]]\" on March 26, 1997, where a massive [[bench-clearing brawl|brawl]] broke out between the [[Colorado Avalanche]] and Red Wings. McCarty stunned Avalanche right winger [[Claude Lemieux]] with a blistering punch, and continued punching Lemieux while Lemieux \"turtled\" his body to avoid damage. The fight was revenge for a hit that Lemieux inflicted on Kris Draper in the previous years playoffs that caused significant injuries to Draper. The fight was also considered what had broken the curse over the Red Wings, as they went on to win their first Stanley cup in over 40 years. McCarty also scored the overtime winning goal to make it 6-5.\n\nIn the [[2002 Stanley Cup playoffs|2002 Stanley Cup Playoffs]], McCarty registered his first [[hat-trick]] in Game One of the [[2002 Stanley Cup Playoffs#Western Conference|Western Conference Finals]] against the [[Colorado Avalanche]]'s [[Patrick Roy]]. McCarty scored four goals in the series, a career best. Detroit won the series and eventually a [[2002 Stanley Cup Finals|third Stanley Cup]] in six years.\n\n===Calgary Flames===\nAfter 11 seasons with the Red Wings, McCarty and the team parted ways as the lockout canceled the [[2004\u201305 NHL season]]. McCarty's contract was bought out by the Red Wings as a result of the newly implemented salary cap. He then signed as a free agent with the [[Calgary Flames]] on August 2, 2005. He scored seven goals for the Flames during the regular season. He scored the overtime winning goal in Game 1 of the Flames first round series against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, a series Calgary would eventually lose in 7 games. In the 2006\u201307 season, McCarty appeared in only 32 games and for the first time in his career, failed to score a point.\n\n===Flint Generals===\nOn December 31, 2007, the [[Flint Generals]] of the [[International Hockey League (2007\u2013)|International Hockey League]] announced that McCarty had signed with the team.<ref>{{cite web |title=Darren McCarty attempting comeback with Flint Generals |url=http://freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071230/SPORTS05/312300014/1053 |publisher=[[Detroit Free Press]] |date=December 31, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205043432/http://freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20071230%2FSPORTS05%2F312300014%2F1053 |archivedate=2008-02-05 }}</ref>  The Generals are co-owned by McCarty's former Grind Liner, [[Kris Draper]], who encouraged McCarty to make a comeback to professional hockey.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071231/SPORTS18/712310382/1053 |title=Former teammates Kris Draper, Darren McCarty reconnect |first=George |last=Sipple |publisher=[[Detroit Free Press]] |date=December 31, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205073839/http://freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20071231%2FSPORTS18%2F712310382%2F1053 |archivedate=2008-02-05 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080127/SPORTS05/801270692/1048/SPORTS |title=FROM GRIND TO GRACE: Darren McCarty tries to find himself and his career again |publisher=[[Detroit Free Press]] |date=January 27, 2008}}</ref> McCarty made his home debut for the Generals on January 12, 2008 and recorded one assist in the 4\u20133 victory.

McCarty has been known more for his fists than his scoring ability, taking on the role of the Red Wings [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcer]] most of his career, a role in which he won the [[Stanley Cup]] four times in [[1997 Stanley Cup Finals|1997]], [[1998 Stanley Cup Finals|1998]], [[2002 Stanley Cup Finals|2002]], and [[2008 Stanley Cup Finals|2008]], the last of which after resurrecting his career in the Red Wings minor league system.\n\nMcCarty spent much of his childhood in the small town of [[Leamington, Ontario]], playing for the Southpoint Capitals ([[Ontario Minor Hockey Association|OMHA]]) minor teams.\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Belleville Bulls===\nMcCarty played for the [[Belleville Bulls]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League]] from 1989 through 1992. As captain of the team during the [[1991-92 OHL season|1991-92 season]], McCarty recorded 55 goals and 72 assists for 127 points in 65 games. He was awarded the [[Jim Mahon Memorial Trophy]] as the top scoring [[Winger (ice hockey)|right winger]].\n\n===Detroit Red Wings===\n\nDrafted in the 2nd round, 49th overall, by the Red Wings in the [[1992 NHL Entry Draft]], McCarty scored 26 points in his rookie season as the Wings won the Central Division title. In the [[1996\u201397 NHL season]], McCarty scored a career best 19 goals and 42 points as the Wings [[1997 Stanley Cup Finals|swept]] the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] for their first [[Stanley Cup]] in 42 years. McCarty scored the Cup-clinching goal in Game 4. This goal, scored on an inside-outside move around a Flyers' defenseman ([[Janne Niinimaa]]), and goalie ([[Ron Hextall]]), was honored as one of the best goals of the year.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o93Hxjt-fcA]\n\nFrom the [[1997\u201398 NHL season|1997\u201398 season]] until his departure from the team, McCarty was part of Detroit's famous [[Grind Line]] with [[Centre (ice hockey)|center]] [[Kris Draper]] and [[winger (ice hockey)|winger]] [[Kirk Maltby]], which was often matched up against the opponent's top offensive line.\n\nOne of McCarty's most infamous moments was in the famous \"[[Red Wings \u2013 Avalanche brawl|Fight Night at the Joe]]\" on March 26, 1997, where a massive [[bench-clearing brawl|brawl]] broke out between the [[Colorado Avalanche]] and Red Wings. McCarty stunned Avalanche right winger [[Claude Lemieux]] with a blistering punch, and continued punching Lemieux while Lemieux \"turtled\" his body to avoid damage. The fight was revenge for a hit that Lemieux inflicted on Kris Draper in the previous years playoffs that caused significant injuries to Draper. The fight was also considered what had broken the curse over the Red Wings, as they went on to win their first Stanley cup in over 40 years. McCarty also scored the overtime winning goal to make it 6-5.\n\nIn the [[2002 Stanley Cup playoffs|2002 Stanley Cup Playoffs]], McCarty registered his first [[hat-trick]] in Game One of the [[2002 Stanley Cup Playoffs#Western Conference|Western Conference Finals]] against the [[Colorado Avalanche]]'s [[Patrick Roy]]. McCarty scored four goals in the series, a career best. Detroit won the series and eventually a [[2002 Stanley Cup Finals|third Stanley Cup]] in six years.\n\n===Calgary Flames===\nAfter 11 seasons with the Red Wings, McCarty and the team parted ways as the lockout canceled the [[2004\u201305 NHL season]]. McCarty's contract was bought out by the Red Wings as a result of the newly implemented salary cap. He then signed as a free agent with the [[Calgary Flames]] on August 2, 2005. He scored seven goals for the Flames during the regular season. He scored the overtime winning goal in Game 1 of the Flames first round series against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, a series Calgary would eventually lose in 7 games. In the 2006\u201307 season, McCarty appeared in only 32 games and for the first time in his career, failed to score a point.\n\n===Flint Generals===\nOn December 31, 2007, the [[Flint Generals]] of the [[International Hockey League (2007\u2013)|International Hockey League]] announced that McCarty had signed with the team.<ref>{{cite web |title=Darren McCarty attempting comeback with Flint Generals |url=http://freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071230/SPORTS05/312300014/1053 |publisher=[[Detroit Free Press]] |date=December 31, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205043432/http://freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20071230%2FSPORTS05%2F312300014%2F1053 |archivedate=2008-02-05 }}</ref>  The Generals are co-owned by McCarty's former Grind Liner, [[Kris Draper]], who encouraged McCarty to make a comeback to professional hockey.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071231/SPORTS18/712310382/1053 |title=Former teammates Kris Draper, Darren McCarty reconnect |first=George |last=Sipple |publisher=[[Detroit Free Press]] |date=December 31, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205073839/http://freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20071231%2FSPORTS18%2F712310382%2F1053 |archivedate=2008-02-05 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080127/SPORTS05/801270692/1048/SPORTS |title=FROM GRIND TO GRACE: Darren McCarty tries to find himself and his career again |publisher=[[Detroit Free Press]] |date=January 27, 2008}}</ref> McCarty made his home debut for the Generals on January 12, 2008 and recorded one assist in the 4\u20133 victory.

The Red Wings eventually won the Stanley Cup in June 2008, McCarty's fourth championship with the team. McCarty signed a one-year contract with the Wings in the offseason.\n\nOn November 18, the Red Wings placed McCarty on waivers, knowing he would not be claimed.  McCarty cleared waivers and remained with the team. After being sent to Grand Rapids for one game, McCarty was soon recalled. He played 13 games in the 2008-2009 season scoring one goal and 25 penalty minutes. McCarty later suffered a groin strain which landed him on [[injured reserve]] in late November. On February 24, 2009 the Detroit Red Wings reassigned McCarty to the Grand Rapids Griffins, after being activated from the injured reserve list. There, he played in 19 games for the Griffins, scoring 5 goals and 6 assists while also collecting 21 penalty minutes. During the Griffins' playoff run McCarty scored 3 goals, 1 assist and 8 penalty minutes in 10 games. After the Griffins were eliminated in the playoffs by the Manitoba Moose, McCarty was recalled by the Red Wings along with several other Griffins players on May 10.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20090319035346/http://www.griffinshockey.com/news/releases/index.html?article_id=1244]\n\nOn July 1, 2009, McCarty became an unrestricted free agent. One week later, Red Wings' general manager [[Ken Holland]] stated that the team would likely move on from McCarty.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110511161903/http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/sports/story.html?id=4ab1fe65-b10c-4601-9d1b-e3c76d125f2d]\n\n== Retirement ==\nOn December 7, 2009 McCarty officially retired, and had already accepted a job as color analyst for Versus. A fifteen-season veteran and fan favorite in Detroit, McCarty thanked the Red Wings and Flames organizations as well as the fans for helping him to realize his dreams.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=508980 |title=Longtime Red Wing McCarty announces retirement |date=7 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcasting==\nOn November 23, 2009 McCarty made his debut as an NHL Analyst for [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]].  McCarty made occasional appearances on the Versus post game show, [[Hockey Central (Versus)|Hockey Central]].

Later, American Jewelry and Loan owners Les and Seth Gold and tru TV hired McCarty to do some cameo appearances on the show.\n\nMcCarty started his weekly podcast, Grind Time with Daren McCarty, in December 2018.  He broadcast weekly from Radio for One Studios featuring guests to discuss topics ranging from hockey to music to life's journey to legalization of cannabis.\n\nIn January, 2020 Darren McCarty and his \"Grind Time with Darren McCarty\" team consisting of his Co-Host Perry Vellucci, Producer Mike Mahkool, and Executive Producer / Business Manager Nick Antonucci, has joined NRM (New Radio Media Streamcast)in Farmington HIlls, MI. \n\n==Personal life==\nMcCarty's father, Craig, was diagnosed with [[multiple myeloma]], an incurable cancer of the bone marrow and blood, in 1995. In 1997, Darren McCarty established the McCarty Cancer Foundation to raise funds to finance research for a cure of this type of cancer.\n\nDuring the early 2000's he was part of an investigative journalism piece for [[Rob Wolchek]] of [[WJBK|WJBK-TV Fox 2 News]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], in which a self-proclaimed masseuse fabricated family ties to McCarty in an attempt to further garner clientele from the local area while practicing without any certifications.\n\nDuring the offseason, McCarty is the lead singer for hard rock band \"Grinder\" which has been in hiatus with the sudden passing of their bass player and friend, James B. Anders from [[cardiomyopathy]].\n\nMcCarty appeared on the 2005 ESPN game show ''Teammates'' with his teammate on the Red Wings at the time, [[Brendan Shanahan]].\n\nMcCarty has four kids with first wife, Cheryl: Griffin, Emerson, Avery, and Gracyn.\n\nIn 2012, McCarty wed long time girlfriend Sheryl Sirmons. He lives in [[Clawson, Michigan]].\n\nMcCarty's autobiography, ''My Last Fight: The True Story of a Hockey Rock Star'', was released on December 1, 2013 by [[Triumph Books]].\n\nMcCarty is a proponent for the legalization of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stanton|first1=Ryan|title=Former Red Wings player Darren McCarty speaks up for marijuana at Hash Bash|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2016/04/former_red_wings_player_darren.html|accessdate=February 21, 2018|work=mlive.com|date=April 2, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Skye|first1=Dan|title=Hockey Great Darren McCarty: Pot Advocate on Ice|url=https://hightimes.com/culture/hockey-great-darren-mccarty-pot-advocate-on-ice/|accessdate=February 21, 2018|work=High Times|date=September 9, 2016}}</ref>  He credits cannabis with helping him overcome his [[alcoholism|alcohol addiction]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=McNeill|first1=Sandra|title=Darren McCarty Praises Medical Marijuana: 'I'm Finally Becoming The Person That I Can Be'|url=http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2016/03/11/darren-mccarty-praises-medical-marijuana-im-finally-becoming-the-person-that-i-can-be/|accessdate=February 21, 2018|work=WWJ-TV|date=March 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n* '''1992''': [[Ontario Hockey League]] First All-Star Team\n* '''1992''': [[Jim Mahon Memorial Trophy]]\n* '''1997, 1998, 2002, 2008''': Won the [[Stanley Cup]] with the Red Wings\n* '''1998''': ESPY Award NHL Play of the Year<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espy2001/s/pastwinners.html | title= ''ESPY Awards''}}</ref>\n* '''2003''' Named the winner of the [[NHL Foundation Player Award]]\n\n==Career statistics==\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | &nbsp;\n! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | &nbsp;\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[regular season|Regular&nbsp;season]]\n! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | &nbsp;\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[Playoffs]]\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n!
