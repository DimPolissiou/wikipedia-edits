The city is situated geographically within [[Simcoe County]], however it is a [[Independent city|politically independent]] single-tier municipality. It is within the historically significant [[Huronia (region)|Huronia]] region of Central Ontario, and is part of the [[Golden Horseshoe|Greater Golden Horseshoe]], a densely populated and industrialised sub-region of Ontario. As of the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 census]], the city's population was 141,434 making it the [[List of the 100 largest municipalities in Canada by population|34th largest]] in Canada in terms of population proper. The Barrie [[Census metropolitan areas|census metropolitan area]] (CMA) as of the same census had a population of 197,059 residents, making it the [[List of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in Canada|21st largest CMA in Canada]]. The city itself has seen significant growth in recent decades due to its emergence as a [[bedroom community]] for that of [[Toronto]]. The affordability of housing and robust job market perhaps contribute to a Toronto buyer's appeasement with Barrie. [[GO Transit]] offers daily service to and from the [[Greater Toronto Area]] from two stations in the city. Barrie is located {{convert|85|km|mi}} north of Toronto, {{convert|355|km|mi}} northeast of [[Detroit]] and {{convert|335|km|mi}} west of [[Ottawa]]. This represents the city's highly centralised and historically advantageous situation, providing an ease of access to major centres and airports across the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.placestogrow.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=9&Itemid=14 |title=Ministry of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure |website=Placestogrow.ca |date= |accessdate=December 29, 2015}}</ref> \n\nThe Barrie area was first settled during the [[War of 1812]] as a key supply depot for British forces. It would be named 20 years later after Sir [[Robert Barrie]], who frequently commanded forces through the region. The 1980s and 1990s would be a period of immense growth for Barrie, with the population tripling in the span of twenty-five years. In 1981, the city had a population of 38,423; in 2006, Barrie had 128,430 residents living within city limits. Barrie's ongoing success would be punctuated by high-rise condominium development along Kempenfelt Bay, instigating a sort of downtown renaissance. Great investment by the city into their beachfront amenities would culminate in Barrie becoming a prime tourist destination. With several ski resorts in the vicinity and a picturesque waterfront, Barrie is known not just for its tourism, but also as the 'Gateway to Cottage Country'.<ref name=\"Barrie Wards Map\">{{cite web |title=Barrie Wards Map |publisher=City of Barrie |url=https://barrie.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=3369de0cb238453ba0376b9c392e2b6d }}</ref> The city's economy is diverse, with [[education]], [[healthcare]], [[information technology]] and [[manufacturing]] all prevalent sectors. The [[Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre]] is Barrie's largest employer, with nearly 3,000 workers. [[Retail]] in the city has flourished too in recent decades, bolstered by the completion of [[Park Place (Ontario)|Park Place]] in 2008. Barrie experiences cold, snowy winters with an average January minimum temperature of {{convert|-12.4|C}}. Summers are hot and humid, with an average July maximum temperature of {{convert|26.3|C}}.<ref name=\"Barrie Wards Map\"/>\n\n== History ==\nAt its inception, Barrie was an establishment of houses and warehouses at the foot of the [[Nine Mile Portage]] from [[Kempenfelt Bay]] to [[Fort Willow]], an aboriginal transportation route that existed centuries before Europeans arrived in [[Simcoe County]]. The portage linked Kempenfelt Bay through Willow Creek, connecting [[Lake Simcoe]] to the [[Nottawasaga River]] which flows into [[Georgian Bay]] off Lake Huron. Barrie played an integral role in the [[War of 1812]]. During the war, the city became a [[supply depot]] for British forces and in addition, the Nine Mile Portage was adopted by the British military as a key piece of their supply line which provided a strategic path for communication, personnel and vital supplies and equipment to and from Fort Willow and Georgian Bay/[[Lake Huron]]. Today, the Nine Mile Portage is marked by signs along roads in Barrie and in [[Springwater, Ontario|Springwater Township]]. The scenic path from Memorial Square to Fort Willow is accessible to visitors year-round. The city was named in 1833 after [[Robert Barrie|Sir Robert Barrie]], who was in charge of the naval forces in Canada and frequently commanded forces through the city and along the Nine Mile Portage. Barrie was also the final destination for a branch of the [[Underground Railroad]]. In the mid-19th century, this network of secret routes allowed many American slaves to enter Barrie and the surrounding area. This contributed to the development (and name) of nearby [[Shanty Bay, Ontario|Shanty Bay]]. In 1846, the population of Barrie was roughly 500, mostly from England, Ireland and Scotland. A private school, three churches, a brick courthouse and a limestone jail, (built in 1842), were in operation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Simcoe County Court-House and Gaol |url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Simcoe25.html |publisher=Ontario's Historical Plaques |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref> Local businesses included three [[tavern]]s, six stores, three [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]], a wagon maker, a bakery, a cabinet maker and six shoemakers, as well as a bank.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

It was a station of the [[Northern Railway of Canada|Northern Railway]] and was situated on Lake Simcoe's western arm, known as Kempenfelt Bay. Throughout the latter of the 19th century, [[Steamship]]s ran from Barrie to the [[District Municipality of Muskoka|Muskoka Territory]], [[Orillia, Ontario|Orillia]] and other communities and stages were taking passengers to [[Penetanguishene]].<ref>The Province of Ontario Gazetteer and Directory. H. McEvoy Editor and Compiler, Toronto : Robertson & Cook, Publishers, 1869</ref> The period of 1870 to 1890 defined Barrie's downtown development with a series of raging fires that sequentially destroyed multiple landmarks, giving rise to the moniker that Barrie was \"among the best burning towns in Canada.\" <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.simcoe.com/news-story/2069137-huge-fires-defined-barrie-s-downtown-development/|title=Huge fires defined Barrie\u2019s downtown development|date=2007-12-07|website=Simcoe.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref> Many local businesses like breweries, tanneries and sawmills depended on fire to operate, endangering the ramshackle assortment of wooden homes and buildings that made up the city centre. One of the most destructive fires came in mid-1875, when the entire section north of Dunlop to Collier, bounded by Clapperton and Owen Streets, was reduced to ash, destroying around 20 local businesses. After this period, the modern streets and buildings of Barrie began to take form in a massive rebuilding process. Other landmarks to eventually burn down over the years include the Barrie Opera House (1926), The Queen's Hotel (1915) and two of Barrie's largest and most prominent companies; the Sevigny Carriage Shop and the Anderton Brewery in 1916.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the midst of [[World War I]], dedicated residents of Barrie helped to hastily construct [[Canadian Forces Base Borden]] (CFB Borden) as a means of additional support and to serve as a major training centre of [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] battalions. The base would open on July 11, 1916, and since then has become the largest Canadian Forces Base in the country, playing a paramount role through the remainder of the war, and throughout history. During [[World War II]], the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] named a {{sclass2-|Flower|corvette}} {{HMCS|Barrie}}. On September 7, 1977, a private aircraft dropped to an altitude of {{convert|500|ft|m|0}} in dense fog and struck the {{convert|1,000|ft|m|adj=on|0}} [[CKVR-TV]] tower, killing all five occupants aboard the plane and destroying the tower and antenna. The station's {{convert|225|ft|m|adj=on|0}} auxiliary tower was also destroyed and damage had been inflicted on the roof of the main studio. CKVR was back on the air in the weeks following using a temporary {{convert|400|ft|m|adj=on|0}} tower; a power reduction of nearly 40,000 watts occurred upon their return to the air on September 19 at 8:55&nbsp;p.m. The new 1,000-foot tower was rebuilt in 1978.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} On May 31, 1985, an [[Fujita scale|F4]] tornado struck Barrie, touching down in [[Essa Township]], less than 10 kilometres (6.2&nbsp;mi) southwest of [[Highway 400]] and the Barrie city limits. At approximately 4:00 PM, all electrical power in Barrie went out, as the Grand Valley/Tottenham tornado took out the main hydro transformers southwest of the city. It then entered the southern part of Barrie shortly before 5:00pm, causing devastating damage in the subdivisions within its immediate path. The visibility in the general vicinity had been reduced drastically as the tornado was cloaked in heavy rain and dust. It became known as one of the most [[1985 Barrie tornado outbreak|violent and deadliest tornadoes]] in Canadian history, claiming the lives of eight within the city and injuring over 155 people. A [[state of emergency]] had been issued for the city that evening, with services from surrounding municipalities being required as the weeks following wore on. Between June 12-13, 1987, a sculpture called ''[[Spirit Catcher]]'' by [[Ron Baird]] was moved to Barrie from [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], where it had been exhibited as part of [[Expo '86]]. The sculpture was erected permanently at the foot of Maple Avenue on the shore of Kempenfelt Bay and has since become a principal facet in the Barrie city skyline and tourism. However, with the re-development along the waterfront and Lakeshore Drive, the city is considering moving the Spirit Catcher to a gravel outcropping at the foot of Bayfield Street. On January 12, 2004, the former [[Molson Brewery]] in south Barrie was found to be home to an illegal marijuana grow-op housing an estimated 30,000 marijuana plants with an estimated street value of $30 million; at the time, it was the largest marijuana grow-op bust in Canada's history. Barrie's [[Park Place (Ontario)|Park Place]] (formerly Molson Park) was chosen to host [[live8|Live 8]] Canada on July 2, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1119352066774_150 |title=Barrie, Ont. to host Canadian edition of Live 8 |accessdate=September 14, 2006 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226043121/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1119352066774_150 |archivedate=December 26, 2005 |df= }}</ref> The overall success of the concert contributed to a plan to convert the prior [[Molson Park]] lands into a commercial district. On October 31, 2006, commercial real estate developers North American Acquisition Inc (NAA), a subsidiary of North American Development Group, LLC (NADG) won an [[Ontario Municipal Board]] (OMB) appeal of a rezoning application that had been previously denied by the City of Barrie to rezone the new Park Place lands from general industrial to business park zones, and general commercial or mixed employment. The proposal was followed by several concepts, including a [[box store]] abstraction originally conceived in 2002. The development of the lands was halted temporarily in 2009 due to disputes with the past OMB appeal, and construction of the complex would resume in 2010. An explosion in the Royal Thai restaurant, housed in the landmark Wellington Hotel at the \"Five Points\" intersection in downtown Barrie, occurred at 11:20pm on December 6, 2007. The fire quickly spread to several neighbouring buildings and firefighters battled the blaze well into the following morning, requiring assistance from other Simcoe County fire services. Officials estimated the damages to be in the millions. The 100-year-old Wellington Hotel building collapsed later in the morning.<ref name=\"canada.com\">{{cite web   |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=4f3ddae9-5044-4f4d-a4fb-7adee1d63299&k=71332 |title=Massive blaze destroys six buildings in Barrie |date=December 7, 2007 |accessdate=December 7, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071209023032/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=4f3ddae9-5044-4f4d-a4fb-7adee1d63299&k=71332| archivedate= December 9, 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref><ref name=\"ctv.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20071207/barrie_fire_071207/20071207?hub=TorontoHome |title=Fire destroys historic buildings in Barrie, Ont.\n |date=December 7, 2007 |accessdate=December 7, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071210055740/http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20071207/barrie_fire_071207/20071207?hub=TorontoHome| archivedate= December 10, 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref> On February 17, 2008, two people were charged in connection with the fire after the Ontario Fire Marshal's office concluded the explosion and subsequent fire were the result of arson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2008/02/18/pf-4856783.html|title=Pair charged in Barrie fire had ties to destroyed restaurant|publisher=Canoe.ca CNEWS|accessdate=February 4, 2011|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709132558/http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2008/02/18/pf-4856783.html|archive-date=July 9, 2012|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nBarrie is located in the central portion of Southern Ontario, approximately {{convert|abbr=on|80|km}} north of [[Toronto]], {{convert|abbr=on|303|km}} south southeast of [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] and {{convert|abbr=on|412|km}} west southwest of [[Ottawa]], within the Greater [[Golden Horseshoe]] subregion. It is additionally located approximately {{convert|abbr=on|38|km}} southeast of the sought-after summertime destination, [[Wasaga Beach]] and {{convert|abbr=on|112|km}} south of the [[Muskoka District Municipality]] and cottage country, accessible via Highways [[Highway 26 (Ontario)|26]], [[Ontario Highway 400|400]] and [[Highway 11 (Ontario)|11]]. Barrie's historic downtown area is situated in a distinct curved or wrapped valley, surrounding the western edge of Kempenfelt Bay. The terrain is generally flat near the city's centre, with small but relevant hills and valleys being prominent astride the aforementioned. Moving up the valley slopes toward the city's north and south ends and the terrain can be rather steep in some areas. The earth flattens considerably just outside the city's limits to the south and northeast, especially beyond the airport where vast expanses of vegetation and farmland are most notable. The land surrounding Barrie is rich with agricultural activity. Barrie falls into Plant Hardiness Zone 5b. The city does not have any major rivers within its limits but does have numerous creeks and streams, most of which empty into Kempenfelt Bay.\n\n=== Interurban communities ===\n[[File:Barrie Condos and Houses in Winter.jpg|thumb|right|Residential condominiums and houses in Barrie after a snowfall]]\n* Letitia Heights\n* Cundles\n* Ardagh Bluffs\n* The Grove\n* Eastview\n* Holly\n* Downtown\n* Painswick\n* Allandale\n* Minet's Point\n\n=== Expansion ===\nBarrie has been designated an Urban Growth Centre by the Province of Ontario (Places to Grow Simcoe Area, 2009). Its population growth, largely due to its emergence as a bedroom community for Toronto, has given rise to the development of numerous subdivisions on the southern side of the city.

The city is situated on Lake Simcoe, a climatically insignificant body of water. Barrie is located in close proximity to [[Georgian Bay]], which, along with the [[Great Lakes]], act as a \"buffer\" of sorts, moderating year-round temperatures to a fair extent, while combined with the [[Lake-effect snow|lake effect]] can spawn blinding snow squalls in the winter, and strong thunderstorms in the spring and summer. The average July maximum in Barrie is {{convert|26.3|C|0}}, while the average January minimum is {{convert|-12.4|C|0}}. Barrie experiences four distinct seasons, with considerable variance in length. As a result of the rapid passage of weather systems (such as high- and low-pressure systems), the weather is variable from day to day in all seasons, similar to [[Toronto]], the city's southern neighbour. Barrie does not, however, see the effects of [[diurnal temperature variation]], owing to its northerly location and rural outskirts. The city can be subject of noticeably cooler afternoons in the spring and early summer, due to the influence of a [[lake breeze]] since nearby lakes, such as Lake Huron, are cool relative to the air during these seasons. These aforementioned \"lake breezes\" mostly occur throughout the summer, bringing much-needed relief on hot days. Other low-scale maritime effects on the climate include constant [[lake-effect snow]] in the winter, fog and delaying of spring- and fall-like conditions, known as [[seasonal lag]]. Winters are typically cold with frequent snow. During the winter months, temperatures are usually below {{convert|0|C|0}}. Barrie winters sometimes feature cold snaps when maximum temperatures remain below {{convert|-10|C|0}}, often made to feel colder by a biting [[wind chill]]. Occasionally, temperatures can drop below {{convert|-25|C|0}}. Snowstorms, sometimes mixed with ice and rain, can disrupt work and travel schedules, while accumulating snow can fall anytime from late-October until mid-April. However, on the contrary, mild bouts also occur in most winters, melting any accumulated snow. The summer months are characterized by very warm temperatures and muggy conditions. Daytime temperatures are normally above {{convert|20|C|0}}, and often rise above {{convert|30|C|0}}. However, they can sometimes surpass {{convert|35|C|0}}, accompanied by high humidity. The short transitional seasons of spring and autumn have generally mild or cool temperatures with alternating periods of dry and wet. Daytime temperatures average around {{convert|10 to 12|C|0}} during these seasons. Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, but summer is usually the wettest season, the bulk falling during thunderstorms. Barrie is known for heavy thunderstorm activity in the late spring and summer months, all due to its location within a [[Convergence zone|convergence of breezes]] originating from Georgian Bay, [[Lake Ontario]] and [[Lake Erie]]. There can be short periods of dry weather, but [[drought]]-like conditions are rare. The average yearly precipitation is about {{convert|932|mm|0}}, with an average annual snowfall of about {{convert|223|cm|0}}.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The highest temperature ever recorded in Barrie was {{convert|38.9|C|0}} on July 5, 1911.<ref name=\"July 1911\">{{cite web\n| publisher = [[Environment Canada]]\n| url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?hlyRange=%7C&dlyRange=1866-01-01%7C1958-06-30&mlyRange=1866-01-01%7C1958-12-01&StationID=4406&Prov=ON&urlExtension=_e.html&searchType=stnName&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2016&selRowPerPage=25&Line=0&searchMethod=contains&Month=7&Day=25&txtStationName=barrie&timeframe=2&Year=1911\n| title = July 1911\n| work = Canadian Climate Data\n| accessdate = March 26, 2016}}</ref> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-38.9|C|0}} on January 8, 1866.<ref name=\"January 1866\">{{cite web\n| publisher = [[Environment Canada]]\n| url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?hlyRange=%7C&dlyRange=1866-01-01%7C1958-06-30&mlyRange=1866-01-01%7C1958-12-01&StationID=4406&Prov=ON&urlExtension=_e.html&searchType=stnName&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2016&selRowPerPage=25&Line=0&searchMethod=contains&Month=1&Day=25&txtStationName=barrie&timeframe=2&Year=1866\n| title = January 1866\n| work = Canadian Climate Data\n| accessdate = March 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n| open         =  <!-- Any entry in this line will make the template permanently open, and remove the hide button.

In the 2016 census, the city's population increased to 141,434, a growth of 3.9% over the 2011 population of 136,063. The median age is 38.5 years, somewhat lower than the provincial average of 39.0 years.<ref name=\"2016Census\" /> The [[census metropolitan area]] of Barrie is 197,059 and consists of the city proper; the town of [[Innisfil]] directly to the south, west of [[Lake Simcoe]]'s southern arm (population 36,566); and the township of [[Springwater, Ontario|Springwater]] in the agricultural north (population 19,059). Barrie has a total land area of {{convert|898.02|sqkm}} in its metropolitan area, with a significant portion of the precinct being farmland or grassland. Roughly 40% of the Barrie [[census metropolitan area]] is developed land. In the 2016 census, Barrie's \"[[bedroom community]]\" for that of the city of Toronto distinction would be represented once again in another census by its demography. Barrie's median household income was $113,575, far higher than Ontario's median of $74,287, potentially depicting the higher-paying occupations available in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] as opposed to those offered within city limits.<ref name=\"2016Census\" /> Barrie's economic stature is not lacking, however several jobs are offered across different fields locally. Barrie's average commute time is the third highest in Ontario at 59 minutes, also possibly displaying the populous' tendency to work abroad in the more desirable and opportunity-oriented south.

Barrie's historic downtown and [[Dock (maritime)|waterfront]] are at the heart of its tourism industry. Downtown Barrie hosts many older buildings that have been kept up over the years or given new facades that exemplify their historical importance.  Many speciality shops, boutiques, pubs and restaurants are located throughout downtown Barrie, most notably along Dunlop Street East.  Downtown Barrie is becoming well known for its fashion boutiques, local art, live theatre, indie-music and nightlife scenes. In addition, downtown Barrie is home to numerous annual festivals and events such as The Barrie Waterfront Festival, Barrielicious, Winterfest, Celebrate Barrie, Ecofest, Jazz & Blues Festival, Promenade Days, Ribfest and Craft Beer Show, Caribfest, Lawnchair Luminata, [[Kempenfest]], The New Music Festival, [[Barrie Film Festival]], Santa Claus Parade and the New Year's Countdown. In the summer months, the city boasts several beaches including Minet's Point Beach, Johnsons Beach, The Gables, Tyndale Beach, and Centennial Beach. Boating in also very popular in Kempenfelt Bay and Lake Simcoe as it connects to the [[Trent Severn Waterway]]. In 2011, Barrie's waterfront was under redevelopment, with the relocation of several roadways to provide more greenspace and parkland along the lakeshore. There are numerous winter recreation activities and facilities in the surrounding area, including skiing, snow tubing and snowboarding resorts, snowmobile trails and ice fishing. Recreational activities include skiing at nearby [[Horseshoe Resort]], [[Snow Valley (ski area)|Snow Valley]], [[Mount St. Louis Moonstone]] and [[Blue Mountain (ski resort)|Blue Mountain]].\n\n== Arts and culture ==\n[[File:Barrie Canada Day Fireworks.png|thumb|Fireworks over Kempenfelt Bay during Barrie's [[Canada Day]] celebrations]]\nBarrie is home to vibrant performing and fine arts scenes.  There are a number of live performance companies including Theatre by the Bay, Talk Is Free Theatre and the Huronia Symphony. Grove Park Home is the practice hall for On-Stage Performance Group which performs in [[Cookstown, Ontario|Cookstown]]. The Strolling Youth Players and the Kempenfelt Community Players also all perform in Barrie. In addition, an annual live concert series is hosted by Georgian College. There are two main performing arts venues in the city: the Five Points Theatre, and the Georgian Theatre. Originally, the Five Points Theatre was known as The Mady Centre For The Performing Arts, but it was renamed in January 2018. It is located in Barrie's downtown at the Five Points intersection and was completed in 2011. This modern facility is home to many professional and amateur cultural productions, film screenings, theatrical plays, concerts, dance recitals and other performances. It is also the main venue for Theatre by the Bay and the Talk Is Free Theatre Companies. The venue features a flexible stage area with lighting and sound for professional theatre, music, dance, and other presentations, an automated riser/seating system with capacity for 120-200 seats and a sprung performance floor. The Georgian Theatre is a professional performing arts facility located in Barrie's north end on the campus of Georgian College. The theatre features a proscenium stage, sound, lights, fly gallery and seating for 427 on the main level with three pods which can be used to increase the seating capacity to 690. The Theatre is used for both theatrical and non-theatrical activity including conferences and seminars.\n\n[[File:Spiritcatcher barrie wide.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Ron Baird's ''The [[Spirit Catcher]]'' (1986), installed along the waterfront in Barrie]]\nThe prominent [[MacLaren Art Centre]] is located in Barrie. This is an innovative art gallery that inspired the \"Art City\" project, which has had many different large sculptures installed around the city. These can be found in parks and along the scenic waterfront. The MacLaren Art Centre is a large and beautiful building on Mulcaster Street in downtown Barrie. International and Canadian artists display in the three main galleries. A permanent collection of art is growing, the Radio Cafe, a gift shop, film nights, speakers, theatre and many children's programs and community art projects are just a small part of the gallery's mandate. The gallery contributes overall to a vibrant arts community in the Barrie area with it leading edge arts. Barrie is also home to many independent galleries and studios. A concentration of independent galleries, studios and boutiques is located in Lakeshore Mews. This area is located behind the downtown's Dunlop Street and provides a location where one-of-a-kind items can be purchased. Lakeshore Mews artists also organize the annual \"Arts ce Soir\"; an all-night contemporary art event in celebration of visual, musical, theatrical and literary art. In addition, a studio tour in the Barrie/Orillia area takes place on the [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|Canadian Thanksgiving]] weekend every year. It is called the Images Studio Tour and has over 25 artists on average. The self-guided tour allows people to visit artists in their working studio and see how the art is created while enjoying the beautiful fall colours driving through the two cities and the countryside. Potters, jewellers, painters, textile artists and fashion designers make up a few of the disciplines of the talents on display. Barrie is also home to [[Kempenfest]]; one of the largest outdoor arts and crafts celebrations in Ontario. This festival occurs annually over the August long weekend and features over 300 artisans, an antique show, food demonstrations, children's activities and live entertainment, including an indie-music stage. Some of the main arts and culture groups in the city include:\n* Barrie Art Club\n* Barrie Concert Band<ref>{{cite web|title=Barrie Concert Band|url=http://www.barrieconcertband.org/|website=Barrieconcertband.org|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Barrie Film Festival]]\n* Barrie Folk Society<ref>{{cite web|title=Barrie Folk Society|url=http://www.barriefolk.com/|website=Barriefolk.com|accessdate=December 29, 2015}}</ref>\n* Campus Gallery\n* Caribbean Culture Institute\n* Huronia Symphony Orchestra<ref>{{cite web|title=Huronia Symphony Orchestra|url=http://huroniasymphony.ca/|website=Huroniasymphony.ca|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}</ref>\n* Kempenfelt Community Players\n* King Edward Choir<ref>{{cite web|title=King Edward Choir|url=http://www.kingedwardchoir.ca/|website=Kingedwardchoir.ca|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}</ref>\n* Lyrica Chamber Choir\n* Simcoe Contemporary Dancers\n* Talk Is Free Theatre\n* Theatre By The Bay\n* Kiwanis\n\n== Attractions ==\nBarrie has numerous recreational venues and community centres throughout the city.\n* Allandale Recreation Centre\n* [[Barrie Community Sports Complex]]\n* [https://www.barrielibrary.ca/ Barrie Public Library]\n* [[Barrie Uptown Theater]]\n* Dorian Parker Centre\n* East Bayfield Community Centre\n* Eastview Arena\n* Holly Community Centre\n* Lampman Park\n* Lampman Lane Community Centre\n* Parkview Community Centre\n* Southshore Community Centre\n* Victoria Village\n* YMCA of Barrie\n\n== Sports ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

By the time of the [[1837 Rebellion]], Simcoe County had a sufficient population to form a [[battalion]] of [[Militia|Sedentary Militia]] of almost 600 strong. This battalion was involved in marching suspected rebels down Yonge Street to Toronto in order to face justice. By 1855, Barrie was home to an [[Company (military unit)|independent company]] of Rifle Company of militia, followed in 1863 by a company of Infantry. These companies served during the [[Fenian Raids]]. With the [[Militia Act of 1866]], the companies in Barrie were respectively organized as Number 1 and Number 5 companies, in the newly formed 35th Battalion of Infantry (Simcoe Foresters), gazetted on September 14, 1866. In 1885, four companies the 35th Simcoe Foresters, including those from Barrie, formed with four companies from the 12th York Battalion to form the York-Simcoe Battalion. This specially raised battalion served in Western Canada during the [[Northwest Rebellion]], under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel W.E. O'Brien of [[Shanty Bay]], Ontario. For its efforts, The Simcoe Foresters received its first [[Battle Honour]] \"Northwest Canada 1885.\" Citizens of Barrie would next volunteer for military service during the [[Boer War]] in South Africa 1899\u20131902. It was during this conflict that at the [[Battle of Paardeberg]] the citizens of Barrie and The Simcoe Foresters suffered their first fatal casualty, Private James Halkett Findlay. Private Findlay was killed-in-action on February 18, 1900, while serving with C Company of the 2nd Battalion [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] of Infantry. In 1914, the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out and many citizens of Barrie were quick to volunteer for service overseas with The Simcoe Foresters. Late the following year, the Regiment was tasked with raising two overseas battalions, the [[157th Battalion (Simcoe Foresters), CEF]] and the [[177th Battalion (Simcoe Foresters), CEF]]. In the spring of 1916, the Barrie and [[Collingwood, Ontario|Collingwood]] companies of the 157th Battalion began clearing the land and construction of the new military camp on the Simcoe Pines Plain&nbsp;\u2014 Camp Borden (now [[CFB Borden]]). This began Barrie's long friendship with the Base, hence the reason CFB Borden was used for ''[[Canada's Worst Driver 2]]'' and ''[[Canada's Worst Driver 5]].'' With a re-organization of the Canadian Militia between the two world wars, The Simcoe Foresters, headquartered in Barrie, were amalgamated in 1936 with the Grey Regiment, headquartered at [[Owen Sound]], Ontario. This event created the present-day regiment of [[The Grey and Simcoe Foresters]], which is headquartered at the Armoury in Queen's Park, downtown Barrie. With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, citizens of Barrie volunteered for service overseas with The Grey and Simcoe Foresters, the Royal Canadian Navy and the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]. The City of Barrie sponsored a ship in the Royal Canadian Navy, HMCS ''Barrie,'' a Flower-class corvette.\n<br />\n{{wide image|Barrie-panorama-2016-08-29.jpg|1000px|Barrie waterfront}}\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n=== Airports ===\nThere are no major airports with scheduled flights near Barrie (the closest being [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], located in [[Mississauga]]). There are a few airports that are used for light aviation aircraft:\n\n* [[Lake Simcoe Regional Airport]]\n* [[Barrie/Little Lake Water Aerodrome]]\n* [[Springwater (Barrie Airpark) Aerodrome]]\n\n=== Roads ===\nBarrie is served by Provincial Highway [[Ontario Highway 400|Highway&nbsp;400]], which acts as the primary route between Barrie and Toronto. Highway&nbsp;400 bisects the city on a roughly north\u2013south basis. [[Ontario Highway 26|Highway&nbsp;26]], also located in the city, is the main route to the Collingwood area and is known as Bayfield Street within the city limits. Barrie was once served by [[Ontario Highway 27|Highway&nbsp;27]], [[Ontario Highway 90|Highway&nbsp;90]], [[Ontario Highway 93|Highway&nbsp;93]], [[Ontario Highway 131|Highway&nbsp;131]] and [[Ontario Highway 11|Highway&nbsp;11]]. However, the province downgraded many highways in 1997 and 1998; these highways are now known as [[Simcoe County Road&nbsp;27]], [[Simcoe County Road&nbsp;90]] (Dunlop Street), [[Simcoe County Road&nbsp;93]] and Simcoe County Road&nbsp;30. The portion of Highway&nbsp;11 through Barrie is known as [[Yonge Street]], though it is actually part of the [[Penetanguishene Road]]. Major arterial roads within the city include Mapleview Drive, Ferndale Drive, 10th Line, Big Bay Point Road, Essa Road, Huronia Road, Bayfield Street, Cundles Road, Anne Street, Dunlop Street, Livingstone Street, Duckworth Street, Wellington Street and St. Vincent Street.\n\n=== Public transit ===\nPublic transport is provided by [[Barrie Transit]], which operates numerous bus routes within the city. Accessible transit is offered by booking with city run [[Barrie Accessible Community Transportation Service]]. Most regular bus routes operated by Barrie Transit are accessible using low floor vehicles.\nBarrie also has GO Trains and Buses.\n\n=== Interurban/commuter rail ===\n[[GO Transit]] connects the city to the [[Greater Toronto Area]] through daily train service along the [[Barrie line]], with trains operating from the [[Allandale Waterfront GO Station]] and the [[Barrie South GO Station]]. This is primarily a commuter rail service to the GTA, with southbound trips to Toronto's [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] in the morning rush hour and northbound trips in the evening rush hour. Limited weekend service to and from Toronto is also operated.\n\n=== Interurban/commuter bus ===\nIn addition to train service, GO Transit offers daily commuter-oriented bus service to the Greater Toronto Area.  Barrie is served by various private interurban bus lines such as [[Penetang-Midland Coach Lines]] and parent [[Greyhound Canada]], which run buses between Barrie and Toronto's [[Yorkdale Bus Terminal]]. Greyhound operates QuickLink commuter service from Barrie to Toronto seven days a week. In the past [[Gray Coach]] offered service from Toronto to Barrie; the route was later acquired by Greyhound. [[Ontario Northland Motor Coach Services|Ontario Northland]] operates bus routes from various locations to and from Barrie. All inter-urban buses operate from the [[Barrie Transit Terminal]] at 24 Maple Street.\n\n=== Passenger rail ===\nHistorically, Barrie was served by scheduled passenger rail service. Allandale Station was a stop for the [[Grand Trunk Railway]], [[Canadian National Railway]] and [[Via Rail]]. In addition, [[Ontario Northland]]'s [[Northlander]] used the station as a stop, as did [[CN Rail]]/Via Rail (namely [[The Canadian]]). Regular passenger rail service to the station ended in the 1980s and has largely been replaced by interurban / commuter rail service.\n\n== Education ==\nBarrie has two major English school boards that operate inside the city at a public level. The [[Simcoe County District School Board]] administers a Public education in Barrie and Simcoe County, while the [[Simcoe Muskoka Catholic District School Board]] administers to the Catholic population and serves the Simcoe and Muskoka areas. It also has two French school boards, [[Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir]] (formerly Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud), the Catholic board, and [[Conseil scolaire Viamonde]] (CSV, formerly Conseil Scolaire de District du Centre-Sud-Ouest), the secular board. There are also several private schools both for K-8 and K-12.\n\n=== High schools ===\n* [[Barrie North Collegiate Institute]]\n* [[Bear Creek Secondary School]]\n* [[Eastview Secondary School]]\n* \u00c9cole Secondaire Catholique Nouvelle Alliance\n* [[Innisdale Secondary School]]\n* [[St. Joseph's High School (Barrie)|St. Joseph's High School]]\n* Saint Joan of Arc\n* [[St. Peter's Catholic Secondary School]]\n* \u00c9cole secondaire Rom\u00e9o Dallaire\n* [[Unity Christian High School (Barrie)|Unity Christian High School]]\n\n=== Georgian College ===\n[[Georgian College]]'s main campus, with over 10,000 full-time students and approximately 25,000 part-time students, is located in Barrie.\n\n== Media ==\n=== Online ===\n[[Village Media]] operates ''BarrieToday.com.''\n\n=== Print ===\nThere are both semi-weekly and monthly newspapers serving the City of Barrie. The ''[[Barrie Advance]],'' published by [[Metroland Media Group]], is a free newspaper established in 1983 delivered weekly (Thursdays) to every residence in the city as well as residents of Springwater Township and parts of Oro-Medonte. The newspaper contains local news, classifieds, advertisements and flyers. ''Barrie Business'' is a free newsprint publication covering local and regional business news. Published monthly and distributed to every business in the City of Barrie through Canada Post, it seeks to highlight and support Barrie's local business community and events. The ''[[Barrie Examiner]],'' established in 1864, was one of Canada's oldest daily newspapers.

The city is situated geographically within [[Simcoe County]], however it is a [[Independent city|politically independent]] single-tier municipality. It is within the historically significant [[Huronia (region)|Huronia]] region of Central Ontario, and is part of the [[Golden Horseshoe|Greater Golden Horseshoe]], a densely populated and industrialised sub-region of Ontario. As of the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 census]], the city's population was 141,434 making it the [[List of the 100 largest municipalities in Canada by population|34th largest]] in Canada in terms of population proper. The Barrie [[Census metropolitan areas|census metropolitan area]] (CMA) as of the same census had a population of 197,059 residents, making it the [[List of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in Canada|21st largest CMA in Canada]]. The city itself has seen significant growth in recent decades due to its emergence as a [[bedroom community]] for that of [[Toronto]]. The affordability of housing and robust job market perhaps contribute to a Toronto buyer's appeasement with Barrie. [[GO Transit]] offers daily service to and from the [[Greater Toronto Area]] from two stations in the city. Barrie is located {{convert|85|km|mi}} north of Toronto, {{convert|355|km|mi}} northeast of [[Detroit]] and {{convert|335|km|mi}} west of [[Ottawa]]. This represents the city's highly centralised and historically advantageous situation, providing an ease of access to major centres and airports across the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.placestogrow.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=9&Itemid=14 |title=Ministry of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure |website=Placestogrow.ca |date= |accessdate=December 29, 2015}}</ref> \n\nThe Barrie area was first settled during the [[War of 1812]] as a key supply depot for British forces. It would be named 20 years later after Sir [[Robert Barrie]], who frequently commanded forces through the region. The 1980s and 1990s would be a period of immense growth for Barrie, with the population tripling in the span of twenty-five years. In 1981, the city had a population of 38,423; in 2006, Barrie had 128,430 residents living within city limits. Barrie's ongoing success would be punctuated by high-rise condominium development along Kempenfelt Bay, instigating a sort of downtown renaissance. Great investment by the city into their beachfront amenities would culminate in Barrie becoming a prime tourist destination. With several ski resorts in the vicinity and a picturesque waterfront, Barrie is known not just for its tourism, but also as the 'Gateway to Cottage Country'.<ref name=\"Barrie Wards Map\">{{cite web |title=Barrie Wards Map |publisher=City of Barrie |url=https://barrie.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=3369de0cb238453ba0376b9c392e2b6d }}</ref> The city's economy is diverse, with [[education]], [[healthcare]], [[information technology]] and [[manufacturing]] all prevalent sectors. The [[Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre]] is Barrie's largest employer, with nearly 3,000 workers. [[Retail]] in the city has flourished too in recent decades, bolstered by the completion of [[Park Place (Ontario)|Park Place]] in 2008. Barrie experiences cold, snowy winters with an average January minimum temperature of {{convert|-12.4|C}}. Summers are hot and humid, with an average July maximum temperature of {{convert|26.3|C}}.<ref name=\"Barrie Wards Map\"/>\n\n== History ==\nAt its inception, Barrie was an establishment of houses and warehouses at the foot of the [[Nine Mile Portage]] from [[Kempenfelt Bay]] to [[Fort Willow]], an aboriginal transportation route that existed centuries before Europeans arrived in [[Simcoe County]]. The portage linked Kempenfelt Bay through Willow Creek, connecting [[Lake Simcoe]] to the [[Nottawasaga River]] which flows into [[Georgian Bay]] off Lake Huron. Barrie played an integral role in the [[War of 1812]]. During the war, the city became a [[supply depot]] for British forces and in addition, the Nine Mile Portage was adopted by the British military as a key piece of their supply line which provided a strategic path for communication, personnel and vital supplies and equipment to and from Fort Willow and Georgian Bay/[[Lake Huron]]. Today, the Nine Mile Portage is marked by signs along roads in Barrie and in [[Springwater, Ontario|Springwater Township]]. The scenic path from Memorial Square to Fort Willow is accessible to visitors year-round. The city was named in 1833 after [[Robert Barrie|Sir Robert Barrie]], who was in charge of the naval forces in Canada and frequently commanded forces through the city and along the Nine Mile Portage. Barrie was also the final destination for a branch of the [[Underground Railroad]]. In the mid-19th century, this network of secret routes allowed many American slaves to enter Barrie and the surrounding area. This contributed to the development (and name) of nearby [[Shanty Bay, Ontario|Shanty Bay]]. In 1846, the population of Barrie was roughly 500, mostly from England, Ireland and Scotland. A private school, three churches, a brick courthouse and a limestone jail, (built in 1842), were in operation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Simcoe County Court-House and Gaol |url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Simcoe25.html |publisher=Ontario's Historical Plaques |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref> Local businesses included three [[tavern]]s, six stores, three [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]], a wagon maker, a bakery, a cabinet maker and six shoemakers, as well as a bank.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

It was a station of the [[Northern Railway of Canada|Northern Railway]] and was situated on Lake Simcoe's western arm, known as Kempenfelt Bay. Throughout the latter of the 19th century, [[Steamship]]s ran from Barrie to the [[District Municipality of Muskoka|Muskoka Territory]], [[Orillia, Ontario|Orillia]] and other communities and stages were taking passengers to [[Penetanguishene]].<ref>The Province of Ontario Gazetteer and Directory. H. McEvoy Editor and Compiler, Toronto : Robertson & Cook, Publishers, 1869</ref> The period of 1870 to 1890 defined Barrie's downtown development with a series of raging fires that sequentially destroyed multiple landmarks, giving rise to the moniker that Barrie was \"among the best burning towns in Canada.\" <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.simcoe.com/news-story/2069137-huge-fires-defined-barrie-s-downtown-development/|title=Huge fires defined Barrie\u2019s downtown development|date=2007-12-07|website=Simcoe.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref> Many local businesses like breweries, tanneries and sawmills depended on fire to operate, endangering the ramshackle assortment of wooden homes and buildings that made up the city centre. One of the most destructive fires came in mid-1875, when the entire section north of Dunlop to Collier, bounded by Clapperton and Owen Streets, was reduced to ash, destroying around 20 local businesses. After this period, the modern streets and buildings of Barrie began to take form in a massive rebuilding process. Other landmarks to eventually burn down over the years include the Barrie Opera House (1926), The Queen's Hotel (1915) and two of Barrie's largest and most prominent companies; the Sevigny Carriage Shop and the Anderton Brewery in 1916.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the midst of [[World War I]], dedicated residents of Barrie helped to hastily construct [[Canadian Forces Base Borden]] (CFB Borden) as a means of additional support and to serve as a major training centre of [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] battalions. The base would open on July 11, 1916, and since then has become the largest Canadian Forces Base in the country, playing a paramount role through the remainder of the war, and throughout history. During [[World War II]], the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] named a {{sclass2-|Flower|corvette}} {{HMCS|Barrie}}. On September 7, 1977, a private aircraft dropped to an altitude of {{convert|500|ft|m|0}} in dense fog and struck the {{convert|1,000|ft|m|adj=on|0}} [[CKVR-TV]] tower, killing all five occupants aboard the plane and destroying the tower and antenna. The station's {{convert|225|ft|m|adj=on|0}} auxiliary tower was also destroyed and damage had been inflicted on the roof of the main studio. CKVR was back on the air in the weeks following using a temporary {{convert|400|ft|m|adj=on|0}} tower; a power reduction of nearly 40,000 watts occurred upon their return to the air on September 19 at 8:55&nbsp;p.m. The new 1,000-foot tower was rebuilt in 1978.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} On May 31, 1985, an [[Fujita scale|F4]] tornado struck Barrie, touching down in [[Essa Township]], less than 10 kilometres (6.2&nbsp;mi) southwest of [[Highway 400]] and the Barrie city limits. At approximately 4:00 PM, all electrical power in Barrie went out, as the Grand Valley/Tottenham tornado took out the main hydro transformers southwest of the city. It then entered the southern part of Barrie shortly before 5:00pm, causing devastating damage in the subdivisions within its immediate path. The visibility in the general vicinity had been reduced drastically as the tornado was cloaked in heavy rain and dust. It became known as one of the most [[1985 Barrie tornado outbreak|violent and deadliest tornadoes]] in Canadian history, claiming the lives of eight within the city and injuring over 155 people. A [[state of emergency]] had been issued for the city that evening, with services from surrounding municipalities being required as the weeks following wore on. Between June 12-13, 1987, a sculpture called ''[[Spirit Catcher]]'' by [[Ron Baird]] was moved to Barrie from [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], where it had been exhibited as part of [[Expo '86]]. The sculpture was erected permanently at the foot of Maple Avenue on the shore of Kempenfelt Bay and has since become a principal facet in the Barrie city skyline and tourism. However, with the re-development along the waterfront and Lakeshore Drive, the city is considering moving the Spirit Catcher to a gravel outcropping at the foot of Bayfield Street. On January 12, 2004, the former [[Molson Brewery]] in south Barrie was found to be home to an illegal marijuana grow-op housing an estimated 30,000 marijuana plants with an estimated street value of $30 million; at the time, it was the largest marijuana grow-op bust in Canada's history. Barrie's [[Park Place (Ontario)|Park Place]] (formerly Molson Park) was chosen to host [[live8|Live 8]] Canada on July 2, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1119352066774_150 |title=Barrie, Ont. to host Canadian edition of Live 8 |accessdate=September 14, 2006 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226043121/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1119352066774_150 |archivedate=December 26, 2005 |df= }}</ref> The overall success of the concert contributed to a plan to convert the prior [[Molson Park]] lands into a commercial district. On October 31, 2006, commercial real estate developers North American Acquisition Inc (NAA), a subsidiary of North American Development Group, LLC (NADG) won an [[Ontario Municipal Board]] (OMB) appeal of a rezoning application that had been previously denied by the City of Barrie to rezone the new Park Place lands from general industrial to business park zones, and general commercial or mixed employment. The proposal was followed by several concepts, including a [[box store]] abstraction originally conceived in 2002. The development of the lands was halted temporarily in 2009 due to disputes with the past OMB appeal, and construction of the complex would resume in 2010. An explosion in the Royal Thai restaurant, housed in the landmark Wellington Hotel at the \"Five Points\" intersection in downtown Barrie, occurred at 11:20pm on December 6, 2007. The fire quickly spread to several neighbouring buildings and firefighters battled the blaze well into the following morning, requiring assistance from other Simcoe County fire services. Officials estimated the damages to be in the millions. The 100-year-old Wellington Hotel building collapsed later in the morning.<ref name=\"canada.com\">{{cite web   |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=4f3ddae9-5044-4f4d-a4fb-7adee1d63299&k=71332 |title=Massive blaze destroys six buildings in Barrie |date=December 7, 2007 |accessdate=December 7, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071209023032/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=4f3ddae9-5044-4f4d-a4fb-7adee1d63299&k=71332| archivedate= December 9, 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref><ref name=\"ctv.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20071207/barrie_fire_071207/20071207?hub=TorontoHome |title=Fire destroys historic buildings in Barrie, Ont.\n |date=December 7, 2007 |accessdate=December 7, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071210055740/http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20071207/barrie_fire_071207/20071207?hub=TorontoHome| archivedate= December 10, 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref> On February 17, 2008, two people were charged in connection with the fire after the Ontario Fire Marshal's office concluded the explosion and subsequent fire were the result of arson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2008/02/18/pf-4856783.html|title=Pair charged in Barrie fire had ties to destroyed restaurant|publisher=Canoe.ca CNEWS|accessdate=February 4, 2011|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709132558/http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2008/02/18/pf-4856783.html|archive-date=July 9, 2012|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nBarrie is located in the central portion of Southern Ontario, approximately {{convert|abbr=on|80|km}} north of [[Toronto]], {{convert|abbr=on|303|km}} south southeast of [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] and {{convert|abbr=on|412|km}} west southwest of [[Ottawa]], within the Greater [[Golden Horseshoe]] subregion. It is additionally located approximately {{convert|abbr=on|38|km}} southeast of the sought-after summertime destination, [[Wasaga Beach]] and {{convert|abbr=on|112|km}} south of the [[Muskoka District Municipality]] and cottage country, accessible via Highways [[Highway 26 (Ontario)|26]], [[Ontario Highway 400|400]] and [[Highway 11 (Ontario)|11]]. Barrie's historic downtown area is situated in a distinct curved or wrapped valley, surrounding the western edge of Kempenfelt Bay. The terrain is generally flat near the city's centre, with small but relevant hills and valleys being prominent astride the aforementioned. Moving up the valley slopes toward the city's north and south ends and the terrain can be rather steep in some areas. The earth flattens considerably just outside the city's limits to the south and northeast, especially beyond the airport where vast expanses of vegetation and farmland are most notable. The land surrounding Barrie is rich with agricultural activity. Barrie falls into Plant Hardiness Zone 5b. The city does not have any major rivers within its limits but does have numerous creeks and streams, most of which empty into Kempenfelt Bay.\n\n=== Interurban communities ===\n[[File:Barrie Condos and Houses in Winter.jpg|thumb|right|Residential condominiums and houses in Barrie after a snowfall]]\n* Letitia Heights\n* Cundles\n* Ardagh Bluffs\n* The Grove\n* Eastview\n* Holly\n* Downtown\n* Painswick\n* Allandale\n* Minet's Point\n\n=== Expansion ===\nBarrie has been designated an Urban Growth Centre by the Province of Ontario (Places to Grow Simcoe Area, 2009). Its population growth, largely due to its emergence as a bedroom community for Toronto, has given rise to the development of numerous subdivisions on the southern side of the city.

The city is situated on Lake Simcoe, a climatically insignificant body of water. Barrie is located in close proximity to [[Georgian Bay]], which, along with the [[Great Lakes]], act as a \"buffer\" of sorts, moderating year-round temperatures to a fair extent, while combined with the [[Lake-effect snow|lake effect]] can spawn blinding snow squalls in the winter, and strong thunderstorms in the spring and summer. The average July maximum in Barrie is {{convert|26.3|C|0}}, while the average January minimum is {{convert|-12.4|C|0}}. Barrie experiences four distinct seasons, with considerable variance in length. As a result of the rapid passage of weather systems (such as high- and low-pressure systems), the weather is variable from day to day in all seasons, similar to [[Toronto]], the city's southern neighbour. Barrie does not, however, see the effects of [[diurnal temperature variation]], owing to its northerly location and rural outskirts. The city can be subject of noticeably cooler afternoons in the spring and early summer, due to the influence of a [[lake breeze]] since nearby lakes, such as Lake Huron, are cool relative to the air during these seasons. These aforementioned \"lake breezes\" mostly occur throughout the summer, bringing much-needed relief on hot days. Other low-scale maritime effects on the climate include constant [[lake-effect snow]] in the winter, fog and delaying of spring- and fall-like conditions, known as [[seasonal lag]]. Winters are typically cold with frequent snow. During the winter months, temperatures are usually below {{convert|0|C|0}}. Barrie winters sometimes feature cold snaps when maximum temperatures remain below {{convert|-10|C|0}}, often made to feel colder by a biting [[wind chill]]. Occasionally, temperatures can drop below {{convert|-25|C|0}}. Snowstorms, sometimes mixed with ice and rain, can disrupt work and travel schedules, while accumulating snow can fall anytime from late-October until mid-April. However, on the contrary, mild bouts also occur in most winters, melting any accumulated snow. The summer months are characterized by very warm temperatures and muggy conditions. Daytime temperatures are normally above {{convert|20|C|0}}, and often rise above {{convert|30|C|0}}. However, they can sometimes surpass {{convert|35|C|0}}, accompanied by high humidity. The short transitional seasons of spring and autumn have generally mild or cool temperatures with alternating periods of dry and wet. Daytime temperatures average around {{convert|10 to 12|C|0}} during these seasons. Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, but summer is usually the wettest season, the bulk falling during thunderstorms. Barrie is known for heavy thunderstorm activity in the late spring and summer months, all due to its location within a [[Convergence zone|convergence of breezes]] originating from Georgian Bay, [[Lake Ontario]] and [[Lake Erie]]. There can be short periods of dry weather, but [[drought]]-like conditions are rare. The average yearly precipitation is about {{convert|932|mm|0}}, with an average annual snowfall of about {{convert|223|cm|0}}.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The highest temperature ever recorded in Barrie was {{convert|38.9|C|0}} on July 5, 1911.<ref name=\"July 1911\">{{cite web\n| publisher = [[Environment Canada]]\n| url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?hlyRange=%7C&dlyRange=1866-01-01%7C1958-06-30&mlyRange=1866-01-01%7C1958-12-01&StationID=4406&Prov=ON&urlExtension=_e.html&searchType=stnName&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2016&selRowPerPage=25&Line=0&searchMethod=contains&Month=7&Day=25&txtStationName=barrie&timeframe=2&Year=1911\n| title = July 1911\n| work = Canadian Climate Data\n| accessdate = March 26, 2016}}</ref> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-38.9|C|0}} on January 8, 1866.<ref name=\"January 1866\">{{cite web\n| publisher = [[Environment Canada]]\n| url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?hlyRange=%7C&dlyRange=1866-01-01%7C1958-06-30&mlyRange=1866-01-01%7C1958-12-01&StationID=4406&Prov=ON&urlExtension=_e.html&searchType=stnName&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2016&selRowPerPage=25&Line=0&searchMethod=contains&Month=1&Day=25&txtStationName=barrie&timeframe=2&Year=1866\n| title = January 1866\n| work = Canadian Climate Data\n| accessdate = March 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n| open         =  <!-- Any entry in this line will make the template permanently open, and remove the hide button.

In the 2016 census, the city's population increased to 141,434, a growth of 3.9% over the 2011 population of 136,063. The median age is 38.5 years, somewhat lower than the provincial average of 39.0 years.<ref name=\"2016Census\" /> The [[census metropolitan area]] of Barrie is 197,059 and consists of the city proper; the town of [[Innisfil]] directly to the south, west of [[Lake Simcoe]]'s southern arm (population 36,566); and the township of [[Springwater, Ontario|Springwater]] in the agricultural north (population 19,059). Barrie has a total land area of {{convert|898.02|sqkm}} in its metropolitan area, with a significant portion of the precinct being farmland or grassland. Roughly 40% of the Barrie [[census metropolitan area]] is developed land. In the 2016 census, Barrie's \"[[bedroom community]]\" for that of the city of Toronto distinction would be represented once again in another census by its demography. Barrie's median household income was $113,575, far higher than Ontario's median of $74,287, potentially depicting the higher-paying occupations available in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] as opposed to those offered within city limits.<ref name=\"2016Census\" /> Barrie's economic stature is not lacking, however several jobs are offered across different fields locally. Barrie's average commute time is the third highest in Ontario at 59 minutes, also possibly displaying the populous' tendency to work abroad in the more desirable and opportunity-oriented south.

Barrie's historic downtown and [[Dock (maritime)|waterfront]] are at the heart of its tourism industry. Downtown Barrie hosts many older buildings that have been kept up over the years or given new facades that exemplify their historical importance.  Many speciality shops, boutiques, pubs and restaurants are located throughout downtown Barrie, most notably along Dunlop Street East.  Downtown Barrie is becoming well known for its fashion boutiques, local art, live theatre, indie-music and nightlife scenes. In addition, downtown Barrie is home to numerous annual festivals and events such as The Barrie Waterfront Festival, Barrielicious, Winterfest, Celebrate Barrie, Ecofest, Jazz & Blues Festival, Promenade Days, Ribfest and Craft Beer Show, Caribfest, Lawnchair Luminata, [[Kempenfest]], The New Music Festival, [[Barrie Film Festival]], Santa Claus Parade and the New Year's Countdown. In the summer months, the city boasts several beaches including Minet's Point Beach, Johnsons Beach, The Gables, Tyndale Beach, and Centennial Beach. Boating in also very popular in Kempenfelt Bay and Lake Simcoe as it connects to the [[Trent Severn Waterway]]. In 2011, Barrie's waterfront was under redevelopment, with the relocation of several roadways to provide more greenspace and parkland along the lakeshore. There are numerous winter recreation activities and facilities in the surrounding area, including skiing, snow tubing and snowboarding resorts, snowmobile trails and ice fishing. Recreational activities include skiing at nearby [[Horseshoe Resort]], [[Snow Valley (ski area)|Snow Valley]], [[Mount St. Louis Moonstone]] and [[Blue Mountain (ski resort)|Blue Mountain]].\n\n== Arts and culture ==\n[[File:Barrie Canada Day Fireworks.png|thumb|Fireworks over Kempenfelt Bay during Barrie's [[Canada Day]] celebrations]]\nBarrie is home to vibrant performing and fine arts scenes.  There are a number of live performance companies including Theatre by the Bay, Talk Is Free Theatre and the Huronia Symphony. Grove Park Home is the practice hall for On-Stage Performance Group which performs in [[Cookstown, Ontario|Cookstown]]. The Strolling Youth Players and the Kempenfelt Community Players also all perform in Barrie. In addition, an annual live concert series is hosted by Georgian College. There are two main performing arts venues in the city: the Five Points Theatre, and the Georgian Theatre. Originally, the Five Points Theatre was known as The Mady Centre For The Performing Arts, but it was renamed in January 2018. It is located in Barrie's downtown at the Five Points intersection and was completed in 2011. This modern facility is home to many professional and amateur cultural productions, film screenings, theatrical plays, concerts, dance recitals and other performances. It is also the main venue for Theatre by the Bay and the Talk Is Free Theatre Companies. The venue features a flexible stage area with lighting and sound for professional theatre, music, dance, and other presentations, an automated riser/seating system with capacity for 120-200 seats and a sprung performance floor. The Georgian Theatre is a professional performing arts facility located in Barrie's north end on the campus of Georgian College. The theatre features a proscenium stage, sound, lights, fly gallery and seating for 427 on the main level with three pods which can be used to increase the seating capacity to 690. The Theatre is used for both theatrical and non-theatrical activity including conferences and seminars.\n\n[[File:Spiritcatcher barrie wide.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Ron Baird's ''The [[Spirit Catcher]]'' (1986), installed along the waterfront in Barrie]]\nThe prominent [[MacLaren Art Centre]] is located in Barrie. This is an innovative art gallery that inspired the \"Art City\" project, which has had many different large sculptures installed around the city. These can be found in parks and along the scenic waterfront. The MacLaren Art Centre is a large and beautiful building on Mulcaster Street in downtown Barrie. International and Canadian artists display in the three main galleries. A permanent collection of art is growing, the Radio Cafe, a gift shop, film nights, speakers, theatre and many children's programs and community art projects are just a small part of the gallery's mandate. The gallery contributes overall to a vibrant arts community in the Barrie area with it leading edge arts. Barrie is also home to many independent galleries and studios. A concentration of independent galleries, studios and boutiques is located in Lakeshore Mews. This area is located behind the downtown's Dunlop Street and provides a location where one-of-a-kind items can be purchased. Lakeshore Mews artists also organize the annual \"Arts ce Soir\"; an all-night contemporary art event in celebration of visual, musical, theatrical and literary art. In addition, a studio tour in the Barrie/Orillia area takes place on the [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|Canadian Thanksgiving]] weekend every year. It is called the Images Studio Tour and has over 25 artists on average. The self-guided tour allows people to visit artists in their working studio and see how the art is created while enjoying the beautiful fall colours driving through the two cities and the countryside. Potters, jewellers, painters, textile artists and fashion designers make up a few of the disciplines of the talents on display. Barrie is also home to [[Kempenfest]]; one of the largest outdoor arts and crafts celebrations in Ontario. This festival occurs annually over the August long weekend and features over 300 artisans, an antique show, food demonstrations, children's activities and live entertainment, including an indie-music stage. Some of the main arts and culture groups in the city include:\n* Barrie Art Club\n* Barrie Concert Band<ref>{{cite web|title=Barrie Concert Band|url=http://www.barrieconcertband.org/|website=Barrieconcertband.org|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Barrie Film Festival]]\n* Barrie Folk Society<ref>{{cite web|title=Barrie Folk Society|url=http://www.barriefolk.com/|website=Barriefolk.com|accessdate=December 29, 2015}}</ref>\n* Campus Gallery\n* Caribbean Culture Institute\n* Huronia Symphony Orchestra<ref>{{cite web|title=Huronia Symphony Orchestra|url=http://huroniasymphony.ca/|website=Huroniasymphony.ca|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}</ref>\n* Kempenfelt Community Players\n* King Edward Choir<ref>{{cite web|title=King Edward Choir|url=http://www.kingedwardchoir.ca/|website=Kingedwardchoir.ca|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}</ref>\n* Lyrica Chamber Choir\n* Simcoe Contemporary Dancers\n* Talk Is Free Theatre\n* Theatre By The Bay\n* Kiwanis\n\n== Attractions ==\nBarrie has numerous recreational venues and community centres throughout the city.\n* Allandale Recreation Centre\n* [[Barrie Community Sports Complex]]\n* [https://www.barrielibrary.ca/ Barrie Public Library]\n* [[Barrie Uptown Theater]]\n* Dorian Parker Centre\n* East Bayfield Community Centre\n* Eastview Arena\n* Holly Community Centre\n* Lampman Park\n* Lampman Lane Community Centre\n* Parkview Community Centre\n* Southshore Community Centre\n* Victoria Village\n* YMCA of Barrie\n\n== Sports ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

By the time of the [[1837 Rebellion]], Simcoe County had a sufficient population to form a [[battalion]] of [[Militia|Sedentary Militia]] of almost 600 strong. This battalion was involved in marching suspected rebels down Yonge Street to Toronto in order to face justice. By 1855, Barrie was home to an [[Company (military unit)|independent company]] of Rifle Company of militia, followed in 1863 by a company of Infantry. These companies served during the [[Fenian Raids]]. With the [[Militia Act of 1866]], the companies in Barrie were respectively organized as Number 1 and Number 5 companies, in the newly formed 35th Battalion of Infantry (Simcoe Foresters), gazetted on September 14, 1866. In 1885, four companies the 35th Simcoe Foresters, including those from Barrie, formed with four companies from the 12th York Battalion to form the York-Simcoe Battalion. This specially raised battalion served in Western Canada during the [[Northwest Rebellion]], under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel W.E. O'Brien of [[Shanty Bay]], Ontario. For its efforts, The Simcoe Foresters received its first [[Battle Honour]] \"Northwest Canada 1885.\" Citizens of Barrie would next volunteer for military service during the [[Boer War]] in South Africa 1899\u20131902. It was during this conflict that at the [[Battle of Paardeberg]] the citizens of Barrie and The Simcoe Foresters suffered their first fatal casualty, Private James Halkett Findlay. Private Findlay was killed-in-action on February 18, 1900, while serving with C Company of the 2nd Battalion [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] of Infantry. In 1914, the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out and many citizens of Barrie were quick to volunteer for service overseas with The Simcoe Foresters. Late the following year, the Regiment was tasked with raising two overseas battalions, the [[157th Battalion (Simcoe Foresters), CEF]] and the [[177th Battalion (Simcoe Foresters), CEF]]. In the spring of 1916, the Barrie and [[Collingwood, Ontario|Collingwood]] companies of the 157th Battalion began clearing the land and construction of the new military camp on the Simcoe Pines Plain&nbsp;\u2014 Camp Borden (now [[CFB Borden]]). This began Barrie's long friendship with the Base, hence the reason CFB Borden was used for ''[[Canada's Worst Driver 2]]'' and ''[[Canada's Worst Driver 5]].'' With a re-organization of the Canadian Militia between the two world wars, The Simcoe Foresters, headquartered in Barrie, were amalgamated in 1936 with the Grey Regiment, headquartered at [[Owen Sound]], Ontario. This event created the present-day regiment of [[The Grey and Simcoe Foresters]], which is headquartered at the Armoury in Queen's Park, downtown Barrie. With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, citizens of Barrie volunteered for service overseas with The Grey and Simcoe Foresters, the Royal Canadian Navy and the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]. The City of Barrie sponsored a ship in the Royal Canadian Navy, HMCS ''Barrie,'' a Flower-class corvette.\n<br />\n{{wide image|Barrie-panorama-2016-08-29.jpg|1000px|Barrie waterfront}}\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n=== Airports ===\nThere are no major airports with scheduled flights near Barrie (the closest being [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], located in [[Mississauga]]). There are a few airports that are used for light aviation aircraft:\n\n* [[Lake Simcoe Regional Airport]]\n* [[Barrie/Little Lake Water Aerodrome]]\n* [[Springwater (Barrie Airpark) Aerodrome]]\n\n=== Roads ===\nBarrie is served by Provincial Highway [[Ontario Highway 400|Highway&nbsp;400]], which acts as the primary route between Barrie and Toronto. Highway&nbsp;400 bisects the city on a roughly north\u2013south basis. [[Ontario Highway 26|Highway&nbsp;26]], also located in the city, is the main route to the Collingwood area and is known as Bayfield Street within the city limits. Barrie was once served by [[Ontario Highway 27|Highway&nbsp;27]], [[Ontario Highway 90|Highway&nbsp;90]], [[Ontario Highway 93|Highway&nbsp;93]], [[Ontario Highway 131|Highway&nbsp;131]] and [[Ontario Highway 11|Highway&nbsp;11]]. However, the province downgraded many highways in 1997 and 1998; these highways are now known as [[Simcoe County Road&nbsp;27]], [[Simcoe County Road&nbsp;90]] (Dunlop Street), [[Simcoe County Road&nbsp;93]] and Simcoe County Road&nbsp;30. The portion of Highway&nbsp;11 through Barrie is known as [[Yonge Street]], though it is actually part of the [[Penetanguishene Road]]. Major arterial roads within the city include Mapleview Drive, Ferndale Drive, 10th Line, Big Bay Point Road, Essa Road, Huronia Road, Bayfield Street, Cundles Road, Anne Street, Dunlop Street, Livingstone Street, Duckworth Street, Wellington Street and St. Vincent Street.\n\n=== Public transit ===\nPublic transport is provided by [[Barrie Transit]], which operates numerous bus routes within the city. Accessible transit is offered by booking with city run [[Barrie Accessible Community Transportation Service]]. Most regular bus routes operated by Barrie Transit are accessible using low floor vehicles.\nBarrie also has GO Trains and Buses.\n\n=== Interurban/commuter rail ===\n[[GO Transit]] connects the city to the [[Greater Toronto Area]] through daily train service along the [[Barrie line]], with trains operating from the [[Allandale Waterfront GO Station]] and the [[Barrie South GO Station]]. This is primarily a commuter rail service to the GTA, with southbound trips to Toronto's [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] in the morning rush hour and northbound trips in the evening rush hour. Limited weekend service to and from Toronto is also operated.\n\n=== Interurban/commuter bus ===\nIn addition to train service, GO Transit offers daily commuter-oriented bus service to the Greater Toronto Area.  Barrie is served by various private interurban bus lines such as [[Penetang-Midland Coach Lines]] and parent [[Greyhound Canada]], which run buses between Barrie and Toronto's [[Yorkdale Bus Terminal]]. Greyhound operates QuickLink commuter service from Barrie to Toronto seven days a week. In the past [[Gray Coach]] offered service from Toronto to Barrie; the route was later acquired by Greyhound. [[Ontario Northland Motor Coach Services|Ontario Northland]] operates bus routes from various locations to and from Barrie. All inter-urban buses operate from the [[Barrie Transit Terminal]] at 24 Maple Street.\n\n=== Passenger rail ===\nHistorically, Barrie was served by scheduled passenger rail service. Allandale Station was a stop for the [[Grand Trunk Railway]], [[Canadian National Railway]] and [[Via Rail]]. In addition, [[Ontario Northland]]'s [[Northlander]] used the station as a stop, as did [[CN Rail]]/Via Rail (namely [[The Canadian]]). Regular passenger rail service to the station ended in the 1980s and has largely been replaced by interurban / commuter rail service.\n\n== Education ==\nBarrie has two major English school boards that operate inside the city at a public level. The [[Simcoe County District School Board]] administers a Public education in Barrie and Simcoe County, while the [[Simcoe Muskoka Catholic District School Board]] administers to the Catholic population and serves the Simcoe and Muskoka areas. It also has two French school boards, [[Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir]] (formerly Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud), the Catholic board, and [[Conseil scolaire Viamonde]] (CSV, formerly Conseil Scolaire de District du Centre-Sud-Ouest), the secular board. There are also several private schools both for K-8 and K-12.\n\n=== High schools ===\n* [[Barrie North Collegiate Institute]]\n* [[Bear Creek Secondary School]]\n* [[Eastview Secondary School]]\n* \u00c9cole Secondaire Catholique Nouvelle Alliance\n* [[Innisdale Secondary School]]\n* [[St. Joseph's High School (Barrie)|St. Joseph's High School]]\n* Saint Joan of Arc\n* [[St. Peter's Catholic Secondary School]]\n* \u00c9cole secondaire Rom\u00e9o Dallaire\n* [[Unity Christian High School (Barrie)|Unity Christian High School]]\n\n=== Georgian College ===\n[[Georgian College]]'s main campus, with over 10,000 full-time students and approximately 25,000 part-time students, is located in Barrie.\n\n== Media ==\n=== Online ===\n[[Village Media]] operates ''BarrieToday.com.''\n\n=== Print ===\nThere are both semi-weekly and monthly newspapers serving the City of Barrie. The ''[[Barrie Advance]],'' published by [[Metroland Media Group]], is a free newspaper established in 1983 delivered weekly (Thursdays) to every residence in the city as well as residents of Springwater Township and parts of Oro-Medonte. The newspaper contains local news, classifieds, advertisements and flyers. ''Barrie Business'' is a free newsprint publication covering local and regional business news. Published monthly and distributed to every business in the City of Barrie through Canada Post, it seeks to highlight and support Barrie's local business community and events. The ''[[Barrie Examiner]],'' established in 1864, was one of Canada's oldest daily newspapers. It was distributed five days a week (Tuesday to Saturday) to paid subscribers and also delivered to the remainder of the market free on Thursdays. The ''Examiner'' was one of several [[Postmedia Network]] newspapers purchased by [[Torstar]] in a transaction between the two companies in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kopun|first1=Francine|title=Torstar, Postmedia announce community and daily paper deal|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2017/11/27/torstar-postmedia-announce-community-and-daily-paper-deal.html|accessdate=November 27, 2017|work=Toronto Star|date=November 27, 2017}}</ref> Following the acquisition, Torstar subsidiary [[Metroland Media Group]] announced the closure of the paper effective November 27, 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=Postmedia and Torstar swap dozens of community papers, but will shut down most of them|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/postmedia-torstar-1.4420955|accessdate=November 27, 2017|work=CBC News|agency=The Canadian Press|date=November 27, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Metroland Media to publish 4 daily papers purchased from Postmedia|url=https://metroland.com/press-releases/metroland-media-to-publish-4-daily-papers-purchased-from-postmedia/|website=Metroland Media Group|publisher=Torstar Corporation|accessdate=November 27, 2017|date=November 27, 2017|quote=The closure of the newspapers, which is effective immediately, will affect 46 full-time and part-time employees}}</ref>\n\n===Radio===\nLocal radio stations serving Barrie and area include:\n* FM 93.1 - [[CHAY-FM|CHAY]] (\"Fresh 93.1\"), [[Top 40]]\n* FM 95.7 - [[CFJB-FM|CFJB]] (\"Rock 95\"), [[active rock]]\n* FM 100.3 - [[CJLF-FM|CJLF]] (\"Life 100.3\"), [[christian radio]]\n* FM 101.1 - [[CIQB-FM|CIQB]] (\"Big 101\"), [[Classic Hits]]\n* FM 107.5 - [[CKMB-FM|CKMB]] (\"1075 Kool FM\"), [[hot adult contemporary]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Barrie Police Service]]\n* [[Barrie Speedway]]\n* [[Georgian Mall]]\n* [[Sandy Hollow Landfill]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Barrie, Ontario}}\n{{Wikivoyage|Barrie}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Barrie}}\n*[http://www.barrie.ca/ Official City of Barrie Website]\n*[http://www.barrietourism.on.ca/ Barrie Tourism]\n\n{{Geographic location\n | Centre    = Barrie\n | North     = [[Springwater, Ontario|Springwater]]\n | Northeast = [[Oro-Medonte]]\n | East      = ''[[Kempenfelt Bay]]'' of ''[[Lake Simcoe]]''\n | Southeast =\n | South     = [[Innisfil, Ontario|Innisfil]]\n | Southwest = [[Essa, Ontario|Essa]]\n | West      = [[Springwater, Ontario|Springwater]]\n | Northwest =\n}}\n{{Barrie}}\n{{Simcoe County}}\n{{Subdivisions of Ontario}}\n{{Census metropolitan areas by size}}\n\n[[Category:Barrie| ]]\n[[Category:Populated places on the Underground Railroad]]\n[[Category:Single-tier municipalities in Ontario]]\n", "name_user": "1980fast", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRadio:Rephrase", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrie"}

By this time Golden Dawn had adopted several southern Balkan focused regional objectives as its main programme: to promote the idea of a [[Megali Idea|Greater Greece]] through the expansion of Greek territory into southern Albania ([[Northern Epirus]]), the [[Republic of North Macedonia]], and southern Bulgaria, and ultimately Greece's reconquest of [[Constantinople]] (modern day [[Istanbul]]) and western Anatolia through war with Turkey. They also called to push for the complete [[Hellenisation]] of [[Greek Macedonia]] and [[Western Thrace]] through the expulsion of [[Northern Greece|Northern Greece's]] last remaining [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|Macedonian-speaking minority]] (or so-called Slavophone Greeks) and the [[Turks of Western Thrace|Turkish-speaking Muslim minority]] of [[East Macedonia and Thrace]] that were settled during the Ottoman period (see [[Western Thrace Turks]]). They also aspire \"to combat Islam in the region\", such as through contributing fighters to the [[Greek Volunteer Guard]] that helped [[Siege of Srebrenica|capture Srebrenica]].<ref>See Golden Dawn journal, summer 1995 issue, for a manifesto of this program.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-2000s, Golden Dawn had redirected its attention to opposing non-European, and particularly Muslim, [[European migrant crisis|immigration]] into the mainly Greek areas of southern Greece and Athens. Golden Dawn had temporarily ceased political operations in 2005 and was absorbed by the [[Patriotic Alliance (Greece)|Patriotic Alliance]]. The Alliance, in turn, ceased operations after Michaloliakos withdrew support in the spring of 2007. Golden Dawn held its sixth congress, in March 2007, where party officials announced the resumption of political activities.

By this time Golden Dawn had adopted several southern Balkan focused regional objectives as its main programme: to promote the idea of a [[Megali Idea|Greater Greece]] through the expansion of Greek territory into southern Albania ([[Northern Epirus]]), the [[Republic of North Macedonia]], and southern Bulgaria, and ultimately Greece's reconquest of [[Constantinople]] (modern day [[Istanbul]]) and western Anatolia through war with Turkey. They also called to push for the complete [[Hellenisation]] of [[Greek Macedonia]] and [[Western Thrace]] through the expulsion of [[Northern Greece|Northern Greece's]] last remaining [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|Macedonian-speaking minority]] (or so-called Slavophone Greeks) and the [[Turks of Western Thrace|Turkish-speaking Muslim minority]] of [[East Macedonia and Thrace]] that were settled during the Ottoman period (see [[Western Thrace Turks]]). They also aspire \"to combat Islam in the region\", such as through contributing fighters to the [[Greek Volunteer Guard]] that helped [[Siege of Srebrenica|capture Srebrenica]].<ref>See Golden Dawn journal, summer 1995 issue, for a manifesto of this program.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-2000s, Golden Dawn had redirected its attention to opposing non-European, and particularly Muslim, [[European migrant crisis|immigration]] into the mainly Greek areas of southern Greece and Athens. Golden Dawn had temporarily ceased political operations in 2005 and was absorbed by the [[Patriotic Alliance (Greece)|Patriotic Alliance]]. The Alliance, in turn, ceased operations after Michaloliakos withdrew support in the spring of 2007. Golden Dawn held its sixth congress, in March 2007, where party officials announced the resumption of political activities. At [[2010 Greek local elections|local elections]] on 7 November 2010 Golden Dawn got 5.3% of the vote in the municipality of Athens, winning a seat at the City Council.

It is loosely based on the [[Art School Confidential (comic)|comic of the same name]] by [[Daniel Clowes]]. The film is Zwigoff's second collaboration with Clowes, the first being 2001's ''[[Ghost World (film)|Ghost World]]'' (which was also released by [[United Artists]]).\n\nThe film was partially shot at the [[Otis College of Art and Design]] in [[Los Angeles]] and at Pasadena City College in Pasadena, California. Otis Foundation Professor Gary Garaths worked as a consultant on the film.\n\n==Plot==\nStarting from childhood attempts at illustration, young Jerome pursues his true obsession to art school. Jerome enrolls in Strathmore, an urban college. His roommates are aspiring filmmaker Vince and closeted-gay fashion major Matthew. Jerome looks for love amongst the coeds, but is turned off by them all, before falling in love with the art model, Audrey. In his art classes, he forms a friendship with perennial loser, Bardo, who guides him through the college scene and introduces him to a failed artist, Jimmy, a belligerent drunk.\n\nAs Jerome learns how the art world really works, he finds that he must adapt his vision to the reality that confronts him. The community has been wracked by a serial killer, the Strathmore Strangler, who has confounded the police. As Jerome slowly loses his idealism at art school, he finds himself in competition with a strange newcomer, Jonah, both for Audrey's affection and for artistic recognition.\n\nIn a wild attempt to win a prestigious art competition, Jerome asks for, and gets, Jimmy's paintings, all of which are of the Strangler's victims. Jerome leaves a lit cigarette in Jimmy's apartment by accident, setting a fire and burning up the apartment and Jimmy. The police arrest Jerome as the Strangler (who in fact was Jimmy); Audrey realizes that her true love is Jerome and that she was stupid to be in love with Jonah (who is actually an undercover detective investigating the murders, and is also married); and Jerome is sent to prison. Jerome's paintings, especially one of Audrey, become prized by collectors; Vince scores a huge hit with his documentary of the Strangler called ''My Roommate: The Murderer''. In prison, Jerome continues to paint and sells his works at high prices, not caring that people think he is the killer, while all the while Audrey is still in love with him. At the end, Audrey and Jerome share a kiss through the protective glass.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Max Minghella]] as Jerome\n* [[Sophia Myles]] as Audrey\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Professor Sandiford\n* [[Anjelica Huston]] as Art History Teacher\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Jimmy\n* [[Matt Keeslar]] as Jonah\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as Vince\n* [[Joel David Moore|Joel Moore]] as Bardo\n* [[Nick Swardson]] as Matthew\n* [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]] as Marvin Bushmiller\n* [[Ezra Buzzington]] as Leslie\n* [[Katherine Moennig]] as Candace\n* [[Bob Golub]] as Hector\n* [[Scoot McNairy]] as Army-Jacket\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] (''uncredited'') as Broadway Bob D'Annunzio\n* [[Ozman Sirgood]] as Dad Platz\n* Charlie Talbert as Vince's editor\n* [[Brian Geraghty]] as Stoob\n* [[Michael Shamus Wiles]] as Donald Baumgarten\n* [[Shelly Cole]] as Filthy-Haired Girl\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote|text=[Art School Confidential] was really negatively received both at the box office and critically.

It is loosely based on the [[Art School Confidential (comic)|comic of the same name]] by [[Daniel Clowes]]. The film is Zwigoff's second collaboration with Clowes, the first being 2001's ''[[Ghost World (film)|Ghost World]]'' (which was also released by [[United Artists]]).\n\nThe film was partially shot at the [[Otis College of Art and Design]] in [[Los Angeles]] and at Pasadena City College in Pasadena, California. Otis Foundation Professor Gary Garaths worked as a consultant on the film.\n\n==Plot==\nStarting from childhood attempts at illustration, young Jerome pursues his true obsession to art school. Jerome enrolls in Strathmore, an urban college. His roommates are aspiring filmmaker Vince and closeted-gay fashion major Matthew. Jerome looks for love amongst the coeds, but is turned off by them all, before falling in love with the art model, Audrey. In his art classes, he forms a friendship with perennial loser, Bardo, who guides him through the college scene and introduces him to a failed artist, Jimmy, a belligerent drunk.\n\nAs Jerome learns how the art world really works, he finds that he must adapt his vision to the reality that confronts him. The community has been wracked by a serial killer, the Strathmore Strangler, who has confounded the police. As Jerome slowly loses his idealism at art school, he finds himself in competition with a strange newcomer, Jonah (an undercover detective), both for Audrey's affection and for artistic recognition.\n\nIn a wild attempt to win a prestigious art competition, Jerome asks for, and gets, Jimmy's paintings, all of which are of the Strangler's victims. Jerome leaves a lit cigarette in Jimmy's apartment by accident, setting a fire and burning up the apartment and Jimmy. The police arrest Jerome as the Strangler (who in fact was Jimmy); Audrey realizes that her true love is Jerome and that she was stupid to be in love with Jonah (who is actually married); and Jerome is sent to prison. Jerome's paintings, especially one of Audrey, become prized by collectors; Vince scores a huge hit with his documentary of the Strangler called ''My Roommate: The Murderer''. In prison, Jerome continues to paint and sells his works at high prices, not caring that people think he is the killer, while all the while Audrey is still in love with him. At the end, Audrey and Jerome share a kiss through the protective glass.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Max Minghella]] as Jerome\n* [[Sophia Myles]] as Audrey\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Professor Sandiford\n* [[Anjelica Huston]] as Art History Teacher\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Jimmy\n* [[Matt Keeslar]] as Jonah\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as Vince\n* [[Joel David Moore|Joel Moore]] as Bardo\n* [[Nick Swardson]] as Matthew\n* [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]] as Marvin Bushmiller\n* [[Ezra Buzzington]] as Leslie\n* [[Katherine Moennig]] as Candace\n* [[Bob Golub]] as Hector\n* [[Scoot McNairy]] as Army-Jacket\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] (''uncredited'') as Broadway Bob D'Annunzio\n* [[Ozman Sirgood]] as Dad Platz\n* Charlie Talbert as Vince's editor\n* [[Brian Geraghty]] as Stoob\n* [[Michael Shamus Wiles]] as Donald Baumgarten\n* [[Shelly Cole]] as Filthy-Haired Girl\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote|text=[Art School Confidential] was really negatively received both at the box office and critically.

Named after Grand Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], the architect of the [[Imperial German Navy|''Kaiserliche Marine'']] (Imperial Navy), the ship was laid down at the [[Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven]] in November 1936 and her [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] was launched two and a half years later. Work was completed in February 1941, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Like her sister ship {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}}, ''Tirpitz'' was armed with a main battery of eight {{convert|38|cm|adj=on}} [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|guns]] in four twin [[Gun turret|turrets]]. After a series of wartime modifications she was 2000 tonnes heavier than ''Bismarck'', making her the heaviest battleship ever built by a European navy.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=203}}\n\nAfter completing [[sea trial]]s in early 1941, ''Tirpitz'' briefly served as the centrepiece of the Baltic Fleet, which was intended to prevent a possible break-out attempt by the [[Soviet Baltic Fleet#Great Patriotic War|Soviet Baltic Fleet]]. In early 1942, the ship sailed to Norway to act as a deterrent against an Allied invasion. While stationed in Norway, ''Tirpitz'' was also intended to be used to intercept Allied convoys to the Soviet Union, and two such missions were attempted in 1942. This was the only feasible role for her, since the [[St Nazaire Raid]] had made operations against the Atlantic convoy lanes too risky. ''Tirpitz'' acted as a [[fleet in being]], forcing the British [[Royal Navy]] to retain significant naval forces in the area to contain the battleship.{{sfn|Kemp|p=153}}\n\nIn September 1943, ''Tirpitz'', along with the battleship {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}}, bombarded Allied positions on [[Spitzbergen (island)|Spitzbergen]], the only time the ship used her main battery in an offensive role. Shortly thereafter, the ship was damaged in [[Operation Source|an attack by British mini-submarines]] and subsequently subjected to a series of large-scale air raids. On 12 November 1944, British [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] equipped with {{convert|12000|lb|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|\"Tallboy\" bombs]] scored two direct hits and a near miss which caused the ship to [[capsize]] rapidly. A deck fire spread to the ammunition magazine for one of the main battery turrets, which caused a large explosion. Figures for the number of men killed in the attack range from 950 to 1,204. Between 1948 and 1957, the wreck was broken up by a joint Norwegian and German salvage operation.\n\n== Design ==\n{{main|Bismarck-class battleship}}\n\nThe two {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship}}s were designed in the mid-1930s by the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' as a counter to French naval expansion, specifically the two {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|1}}s France had started in 1935. Laid down after the signing of the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935, ''Tirpitz'' and her [[sister ship|sister]] {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} were nominally within the {{convert|35000|LT|adj=on}} limit imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington regime]] that governed battleship construction in the [[interwar period]]. The ships secretly exceeded the figure by a wide margin, though before either vessel was completed, the international treaty system had fallen apart following Japan's withdrawal in 1937, allowing signatories to invoke an \"escalator clause\" that permitted displacements as high as {{convert|45000|LT}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=203\u2013208}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz-1.jpg|thumb|left|Recognition drawing prepared by the US Navy]]\n\n''Tirpitz'' [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|42900|t|LT|lk=on}} [[Standard displacement|as built]] and {{cvt|52600|t|LT}} [[Full-load displacement|fully loaded]], with a length of {{convert|251|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|36|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|10.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.{{efn|According to naval historians Gerhard Koop and Klaus-Peter Schmolke, ''Tirpitz'' displaced {{convert|53,500|t|LT|sp=us}} at full load in 1944.{{sfn|Koop & Schmolke|p=18}}}} Her standard crew numbered 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted men; during the war this was increased to 108 officers and 2,500 men. She was powered by three [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, each driving a [[screw propeller]], with steam provided by twelve oil-fired Wagner superheated [[water-tube boiler]]s. Her propulsion system developed a total of {{convert|163023|PS|shp kW|lk=on|abbr=on}} and yielded a maximum speed of {{convert|30.8|kn}} on speed trials.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|pp=33, 35}}\n\nShe was armed with eight [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|38&nbsp;cm SK C/34]] L/52 guns arranged in four twin [[gun turret]]s: two [[superfire|superfiring]] turrets forward\u2014Anton and Bruno\u2014and two aft\u2014Caesar and Dora.{{efn|SK stands for ''Schiffskanone'' (ship's gun), C/34 stands for ''Constructionjahr'' (Construction year) 1934, and L/52 denotes the length of the gun in terms of [[Caliber (artillery)|calibres]], meaning that the gun is 52 times long as it is in internal diameter.{{sfn|Campbell|p=219}}}} Her secondary armament consisted of twelve [[15 cm SK C/28|15&nbsp;cm L/55]] guns, sixteen [[10.5&nbsp;cm FlaK 38|10.5&nbsp;cm L/65]] and sixteen [[3.7 cm SK C/30|{{convert|3.7|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] L/83, and initially twelve [[2 cm FlaK 30|{{convert|2|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}} C/30]] antiaircraft guns. The number of 2&nbsp;cm guns was eventually increased to 58. After 1942, eight {{convert|53.3|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} above-water [[torpedo tube]]s were installed in two quadruple mounts, one mount on each side of the ship.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} \n\nAs built, ''Tirpitz'' was equipped with Model 23 search radars{{efn|Named FuMO for ''Funkmessortungsger\u00e4t'' (Radio direction-finding device).{{sfn|Williamson|p=42}}}} mounted on the forward, foretop, and rear rangefinders. These were later replaced with Model 27 and then Model 26 radars, which had a larger antenna array. A Model 30 radar, known as the ''[[FuG 200 Hohentwiel|Hohentwiel]]'', was mounted in 1944 in her topmast, and a Model 213 ''[[W\u00fcrzburg radar|W\u00fcrzburg]]'' fire-control radar was added on her stern {{convert|10.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} Flak rangefinders.{{sfn|Williamson|p=43}}\n\nThe ship's [[belt armour|main belt]] was {{convert|320|mm|abbr=on}} thick and was covered by a pair of upper and main armoured decks that were {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|100|to|120|mm|abbr=on}} thick, respectively.

The ship would be able to attack convoys bound for the Soviet Union, as well as act as a [[fleet in being]] to tie down British naval assets and deter an Allied invasion of Norway. Hitler, who had forbidden an Atlantic sortie after the loss of ''Bismarck'', agreed to the proposal. The ship was taken into dock for modifications for the deployment. The ship's antiaircraft battery was strengthened, and the 10.5&nbsp;cm guns on the superstructure next to the [[Aircraft catapult#Interwar and World War II|catapult]] were moved outboard to increase their field of fire.

Sports activities were organised to keep the crew occupied and physically fit.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=207}}\n\n=== Operations against Allied convoys ===\nSeveral factors hindered ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s freedom of operation in Norway. The most pressing were shortages of fuel and the withdrawal of the German destroyer forces to support [[Operation Cerberus]], the movement of the battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} and the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}} up through the [[English Channel]]. These caused a planned attack against the outbound [[convoy PQ 8]] at the end of January to be abandoned.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} A planned British air attack at the end of January by four-engined heavy bombers was disrupted by poor weather over the target, which prevented the aircraft from finding the ship.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=23\u201324}} In early February, ''Tirpitz'' took part in the deceptions that distracted the British in the run-up to Operation ''Cerberus''. These included steaming out of the fjord and the appearance of preparations for a sortie into the [[North Sea]].{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=24\u201325}} Later that month, the ship was reinforced by the heavy cruisers ''Admiral Scheer'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' and several destroyers. ''Prinz Eugen'' had been torpedoed by a British submarine at the entrance to the F\u00e6ttenfjord, and was therefore temporarily out of action.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=25\u201326}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz early.jpg|thumb|left|''Tirpitz'' under way, probably in 1941]]\nIn March 1942 ''Tirpitz'' and ''Admiral Scheer'', along with the destroyers {{ship|German destroyer|Z14 Friedrich Ihn||2}}, ''Z5 Paul Jakobi'', {{ship|German destroyer|Z7 Hermann Schoemann||2}} and {{ship|German destroyer|Z25||2}} and a pair of [[torpedo boat]]s,{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=240}} were intended to attack the homebound convoy QP&nbsp;8 and the outbound [[Convoy PQ 12]] as part of [[Operation Sportpalast|''Unternehmen Sportpalast'']] (Operation Sports Palace).{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}}{{sfn|Sweetman|p=27}} ''Admiral Scheer'',{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} with a design speed of {{convert|26|kn}},{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=60}} was too slow to operate with ''Tirpitz'' and was left in port,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} as was the destroyer ''Paul Jakobi''. The two torpedo boats were also released from the operation.{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=240}} On 5&nbsp;March, [[Luftwaffe]] reconnaissance aircraft spotted PQ&nbsp;12 near [[Jan Mayen Island]]; the reconnaissance failed to note the battleship {{HMS|Duke of York|17|6}} or the battlecruiser {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}}, both of which were escorting the convoy, along with four destroyers. Unknown to the Germans, Admiral Tovey was providing distant support to the convoys with the battleship {{HMS|King George V|41|6}}, the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Victorious|R38|6}}, the heavy cruiser {{HMS|Berwick|65|6}}, and six destroyers. Enigma intercepts again forewarned the British of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s attack, which allowed them to reroute the convoys. Admiral Tovey attempted to pursue ''Tirpitz'' on 9&nbsp;March,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} but Admiral Otto Ciliax, the commander of the German squadron, had decided to return to port the previous evening. An air attack was launched early on the 9th; twelve [[Fairey Albacore]] torpedo bombers attacked the ship in three groups, and ''Tirpitz'' successfully evaded the torpedoes. Only three men were wounded in the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=250\u2013251}} ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s anti-aircraft gunners shot down two of the British aircraft.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=149}} After the conclusion of the attack, ''Tirpitz'' made for [[Vestfjorden (Norway)|Vestfjord]], and from there to Trondheim, arriving on the evening of 13 March.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} On 30 March, thirty-three [[Handley Page Halifax|Halifax bombers]] attacked the ship; they scored no hits, and five aircraft were shot down.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=156}} The RAF launched a pair of unsuccessful strikes in late April. On the night of 27\u201328 April, thirty-one Halifaxes and twelve [[Avro Lancaster|Lancasters]] attacked; five of the bombers were shot down. Another raid, composed of twenty-three Halifaxes and eleven Lancasters, took place the following night. Two of the bombers were shot down by the German anti-aircraft defences.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=162}}\n\nThe actions of ''Tirpitz'' and her escorting destroyers in March used up {{convert|8230|t|LT|sp=us}} of [[fuel oil]], which greatly reduced the available fuel supply. It took the Germans three months to replenish the fuel spent in the attempt to intercept the two Allied convoys. [[Convoy PQ 17]], which left Iceland on 27 June bound for the Soviet Union, was the next convoy targeted by ''Tirpitz'' and the rest of the German fleet stationed in Norway,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} during [[Operation R\u00f6sselsprung (1942)|''Unternehmen R\u00f6sselsprung'']] ([[Knight (chess)#Movement|Operation Knight's Move]]).{{sfn|Sweetman|p=54}} Escorting the convoy were the battleships ''Duke of York'' and {{USS|Washington|BB-56|6}} and the carrier ''Victorious''.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} ''Tirpitz'', {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}}, and six destroyers sortied from Trondheim, while a second task force consisting of {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}}, ''Admiral Scheer'', and six destroyers operated out of [[Narvik]] and Bogenfjord.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=253\u2013255}} ''L\u00fctzow'' and three of the destroyers struck uncharted rocks while en route to the rendezvous and had to return to port.

Aware that they had been detected, the Germans aborted the operation and turned over the attack to [[U-boat]]s and the Luftwaffe. The scattered vessels could no longer be protected by the convoy escorts, and the Germans sank 21 of the 34 isolated transports.

By this time, the ship needed a major overhaul. Hitler had forbidden the ship to make the dangerous return to Germany, and so the overhaul was conducted in Trondheim. On 23 October, the ship left Bogenfjord and returned to F\u00e6ttenfjord outside Trondheim. The defences of the anchorage were further strengthened; additional anti-aircraft guns were installed, and double anti-torpedo nets were erected around the vessel. The repairs were conducted in limited phases, such that ''Tirpitz'' would remain partially operational for the majority of the overhaul. A [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] was built around the stern to allow the replacement of the ship's rudders.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}} During the repair process, the British attempted to attack the battleship with two [[Chariot manned torpedo|Chariot]] [[human torpedo]]es, but before they could be launched, rough seas caused the human torpedoes to break away from the fishing vessel which was towing them.{{sfn|Bishop|pp=165\u2013172}} By 28 December, the overhaul had been completed, and ''Tirpitz'' began sea trials.

To give the ships an opportunity to work together, Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], who had replaced Raeder in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Barents Sea]] on 31 December 1942, ordered [[Operation Zitronella|an attack]] on the island of Spitzbergen, which housed a British weather station and refuelling base.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} Several settlements and outposts on Spitzbergen were defended by a garrison of 152 men from the [[Norwegian Armed Forces in exile]].{{sfn|Torkildsen|p=221}} The two battleships, escorted by ten destroyers, left port on 6&nbsp;September; in a [[Ruse of war|''ruse de guerre'']], ''Tirpitz'' flew the [[white ensign]] on the approach to the island the following day.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=76}} During the bombardment, ''Tirpitz'' fired 52 main-battery shells and 82 rounds from her 15&nbsp;cm secondaries.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=77}} This was the first and only time the ship fired her main battery at an enemy surface target.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} An assault force destroyed shore installations and captured 74 prisoners.{{sfn|Torkildsen|p=221}}{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=76\u201377}} By 11:00, the battleships had destroyed their targets and headed back to their Norwegian ports.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}}\n\n=== British attacks on ''Tirpitz'' ===\n[[File:Tirpitz altafjord 2.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' in the [[Ofotfjord]]/[[Bogen, Evenes|Bogenfjord]]]]\n{{see also|List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz}}\n\n==== Operation Source ====\n{{main|Operation Source}}\n\nThe British were determined to neutralise ''Tirpitz'' and remove the threat she posed to the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Allied arctic convoys]]. Following the repeated, ineffectual bombing attacks and the failed Chariot attack in October 1942, the British turned to the newly designed [[X-class submarine|X Craft]] [[midget submarine]]s.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} The planned attack, [[Operation Source]], included attacks on ''Tirpitz'', ''Scharnhorst'', and ''L\u00fctzow''.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=195\u2013196}} The X&nbsp;Craft were towed by large submarines to their destinations, where they could slip under anti-torpedo nets and each drop two powerful two-tonne [[naval mine|mines]] onto the sea bed under the target. Ten vessels were assigned to the operation, scheduled for 20\u201325 September 1943. Only eight of them reached [[K\u00e5fjorden (Alta)|K\u00e5fjord]] in Norway for the attack, which began early on 22 September.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} Three of the vessels, ''X5'', ''X6'', and ''X7'', successfully breached ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s defences, two of which\u2014''X6'' and ''X7''\u2014managed to lay their mines. ''X5'' was detected some {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} from the nets and sunk by a combination of gunfire and depth charges.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\nThe mines caused extensive damage to the ship; the first exploded abreast of turret Caesar, and the second detonated {{convert|45|to|55|m|abbr=on}} off the port bow.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=259}} A fuel oil tank was ruptured, shell plating was torn, a large indentation was formed in the bottom of the ship, and bulkheads in the [[double bottom]] buckled. Some {{convert|1430|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the ship in fuel tanks and void spaces in the double bottom of the port side, which caused a [[List (watercraft)|list]] of one to two degrees, which was balanced by counter-flooding on the starboard side. The flooding damaged all of the turbo-generators in generator room No. 2, and all apart from one generator in generator room No.&nbsp;1 were disabled by broken steam lines or severed power cables. Turret Dora was thrown from its bearings and could not be rotated; this was particularly significant, as there were no heavy-lift cranes in Norway powerful enough to lift the turret and place it back on its bearings.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=259\u2013261}} The ship's two [[Arado Ar 196]] floatplanes were thrown by the explosive concussion and completely destroyed.

The first wave struck at 05:29, as tugs were preparing to assist the ship out of her mooring. The second wave arrived over the target an hour later, shortly after 06:30. Despite the alertness of the German antiaircraft gunners, only one other bomber was shot down.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=265}}\n\nThe air strikes did not penetrate the main armour but nonetheless caused significant damage to the ship's superstructure and inflicted serious casualties.

Several of the bomb hits caused serious fires aboard the ship. Concussive shock disabled the starboard turbine engine, and saltwater used to fight the fires reached the boilers and contaminated the feed water. Some {{convert|2000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the ship, primarily through the two holes in the side shell created by shell splinters from near misses. Water used to fight the fires also contributed to the flooding.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=265\u2013267}} D\u00f6nitz ordered the ship be repaired, regardless of the cost, despite the fact that he understood ''Tirpitz'' could no longer be used in a surface action because of insufficient fighter support. Repair work began in early May; destroyers ferried important equipment and workers from Kiel to Altafjord over the span of three days. By 2&nbsp;June, the ship was again able to steam under her own power, and by the end of the month gunnery trials were possible.

A repeat of Operation Tungsten, codenamed Operation Planet, was scheduled for 24 April. Operation Brawn, which was to have been carried out by 27 bombers and 36 fighters from ''Victorious'' and ''Furious'', was to have taken place on 15 May, and Operation Tiger Claw was intended for 28 May. ''Victorious'' and ''Furious'' were joined by {{HMS|Indefatigable|R10|2}} for [[Operation Mascot]], which was to have been carried out on 17 July by 62 bombers and 30 fighters. The weather finally broke in late August, which saw the [[Operation Goodwood (naval)|Goodwood series of attacks]]. Operations Goodwood I and II were launched on 22 August; a carrier force consisting of the fleet carriers ''Furious'', ''Indefatigable'' and {{HMS|Formidable|67|2}} and the escort carriers {{HMS|Nabob|D77|2}} and {{HMS|Trumpeter|D09|2}} launched a total of 38 bombers and 43 escort fighters between the two raids.

The RAF used Lancaster bombers to carry {{convert|6|ST|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy bombs]] to penetrate the ship's heavy armour.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=132\u2013139}} The first attack, [[Operation Paravane]], took place on 15 September 1944; operating from a forward base at [[Yagodnik]] in Russia, 23 Lancasters (17 each carrying one Tallboy and six each carrying twelve [[Johnny Walker (bomb)#Inventions|JW mines]]), scored a single hit on the ship's bow.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The Tallboy penetrated the ship, exited the keel, and exploded in the bottom of the fjord. {{convert|800|to|1000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the bow and caused a serious increase in [[Glossary of nautical terms#T|trim]] forward. The ship was rendered unseaworthy and was limited to {{convert|8|to|10|kn}}. Concussive shock caused severe damage to fire-control equipment. The damage persuaded the naval command to repair the ship for use only as a floating gun battery. Repair work was estimated to take nine months, but patching of the holes could be effected within a few weeks, allowing ''Tirpitz'' to be moved further south to [[Troms\u00f8]]. On 15 October, the ship made the {{convert|200|nmi|abbr=on}} trip to Troms\u00f8 under her own power, the last voyage of her career.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}}\n\nThe RAF made a second attempt on 29 October, after the ship was moored off [[H\u00e5k\u00f8ya]] Island outside Troms\u00f8. Thirty-two Lancasters attacked the ship with Tallboys during [[Operation Obviate]].{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} As on Operation Paravane, [[No. IX Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;9 Squadron]] and [[No. 617 Squadron]] carried out the attack together, which resulted in only one near miss,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} partially the result of bad weather over the target.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=193}} The underwater explosion damaged the port rudder and shaft and caused some flooding. ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s 38&nbsp;cm fragmentation shells proved ineffective in countering the high-level bombers; one aircraft was damaged by ground-based anti-aircraft guns.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} Following the attack, the ship's anchorage was significantly improved. A large sand bank was constructed under and around the ship to prevent her from capsizing, and anti-torpedo nets were installed. ''Tirpitz'' retained a one-degree list to port from earlier damage, and this was not corrected by counter-flooding to retain as much reserve buoyancy as possible. The ship was also prepared for her role as a floating artillery platform: fuel was limited to only what was necessary to power the turbo-generators, and the crew was reduced to 1,600 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=270}}\n\n==== Operation Catechism ====\n[[File:1944-11-22 RAF Sinks Tirpitz.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=0:10|[[Universal Newsreel]] about the attack on ''Tirpitz'']]\n{{main|Operation Catechism}}\n\n[[Operation Catechism]], the final British attack on ''Tirpitz'', took place on 12 November 1944.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The ship again used her 38&nbsp;cm guns against the bombers, which approached the battleship at 09:35; ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s main guns forced the bombers to disperse temporarily, but could not break up the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}} A force of 32 Lancasters from Nos.&nbsp;9 and 617 Squadrons dropped 29 Tallboys on the ship, with two direct hits and one near miss.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} Several other bombs landed within the anti-torpedo net barrier and caused significant cratering of the seabed; this removed much of the sandbank that had been constructed to prevent the ship from capsizing. One bomb penetrated the ship's deck between turrets Anton and Bruno but failed to explode. A second hit [[amidships]] between the aircraft catapult and the funnel and caused severe damage. A very large hole was blown in the ship's side and bottom; the entire section of belt armour abreast of the bomb hit was completely destroyed. A third bomb may have struck the ship on the port side of turret Caesar.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}}\n\nThe amidships hit caused significant flooding and quickly increased the port list to between 15 and 20&nbsp;degrees. In ten minutes the list increased to 30 to 40&nbsp;degrees; the captain issued the order to abandon ship. Progressive flooding increased the list to 60&nbsp;degrees by 09:50, though this appeared to stabilise temporarily. Eight minutes later, a large explosion rocked turret Caesar. The turret roof and part of the rotating structure were thrown {{convert|25|m|abbr=on}} into the air and over into a group of men swimming to shore, crushing them.

Named after Grand Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], the architect of the [[Imperial German Navy|''Kaiserliche Marine'']] (Imperial Navy), the ship was laid down at the [[Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven]] in November 1936 and her [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] was launched two and a half years later. Work was completed in February 1941, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Like her sister ship {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}}, ''Tirpitz'' was armed with a main battery of eight {{convert|38|cm|adj=on}} [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|guns]] in four twin [[Gun turret|turrets]]. After a series of wartime modifications she was 2000 tonnes heavier than ''Bismarck'', making her the heaviest battleship ever built by a European navy.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=203}}\n\nAfter completing [[sea trial]]s in early 1941, ''Tirpitz'' briefly served as the centrepiece of the Baltic Fleet, which was intended to prevent a possible break-out attempt by the [[Soviet Baltic Fleet#Great Patriotic War|Soviet Baltic Fleet]]. In early 1942, the ship sailed to Norway to act as a deterrent against an Allied invasion. While stationed in Norway, ''Tirpitz'' was also intended to be used to intercept Allied convoys to the Soviet Union, and two such missions were attempted in 1942. This was the only feasible role for her, since the [[St Nazaire Raid]] had made operations against the Atlantic convoy lanes too risky. ''Tirpitz'' acted as a [[fleet in being]], forcing the British [[Royal Navy]] to retain significant naval forces in the area to contain the battleship.{{sfn|Kemp|p=153}}\n\nIn September 1943, ''Tirpitz'', along with the battleship {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}}, bombarded Allied positions on [[Spitzbergen (island)|Spitzbergen]], the only time the ship used her main battery in an offensive role. Shortly thereafter, the ship was damaged in [[Operation Source|an attack by British mini-submarines]] and subsequently subjected to a series of large-scale air raids. On 12 November 1944, British [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] equipped with {{convert|12000|lb|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|\"Tallboy\" bombs]] scored two direct hits and a near miss which caused the ship to [[capsize]] rapidly. A deck fire spread to the ammunition magazine for one of the main battery turrets, which caused a large explosion. Figures for the number of men killed in the attack range from 950 to 1,204. Between 1948 and 1957, the wreck was broken up by a joint Norwegian and German salvage operation.\n\n== Design ==\n{{main|Bismarck-class battleship}}\n\nThe two {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship}}s were designed in the mid-1930s by the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' as a counter to French naval expansion, specifically the two {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|1}}s France had started in 1935. Laid down after the signing of the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935, ''Tirpitz'' and her [[sister ship|sister]] {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} were nominally within the {{convert|35000|LT|adj=on}} limit imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington regime]] that governed battleship construction in the [[interwar period]]. The ships secretly exceeded the figure by a wide margin, though before either vessel was completed, the international treaty system had fallen apart following Japan's withdrawal in 1937, allowing signatories to invoke an \"escalator clause\" that permitted displacements as high as {{convert|45000|LT}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=203\u2013208}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz-1.jpg|thumb|left|Recognition drawing prepared by the US Navy]]\n\n''Tirpitz'' [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|42900|t|LT|lk=on}} [[Standard displacement|as built]] and {{cvt|52600|t|LT}} [[Full-load displacement|fully loaded]], with a length of {{convert|251|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|36|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|10.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.{{efn|According to naval historians Gerhard Koop and Klaus-Peter Schmolke, ''Tirpitz'' displaced {{convert|53,500|t|LT|sp=us}} at full load in 1944.{{sfn|Koop & Schmolke|p=18}}}} Her standard crew numbered 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted men; during the war this was increased to 108 officers and 2,500 men. She was powered by three [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, each driving a [[screw propeller]], with steam provided by twelve oil-fired Wagner superheated [[water-tube boiler]]s. Her propulsion system developed a total of {{convert|163023|PS|shp kW|lk=on|abbr=on}} and yielded a maximum speed of {{convert|30.8|kn}} on speed trials.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|pp=33, 35}}\n\nShe was armed with eight [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|38&nbsp;cm SK C/34]] L/52 guns arranged in four twin [[gun turret]]s: two [[superfire|superfiring]] turrets forward\u2014Anton and Bruno\u2014and two aft\u2014Caesar and Dora.{{efn|SK stands for ''Schiffskanone'' (ship's gun), C/34 stands for ''Constructionjahr'' (Construction year) 1934, and L/52 denotes the length of the gun in terms of [[Caliber (artillery)|calibres]], meaning that the gun is 52 times long as it is in internal diameter.{{sfn|Campbell|p=219}}}} Her secondary armament consisted of twelve [[15 cm SK C/28|15&nbsp;cm L/55]] guns, sixteen [[10.5&nbsp;cm FlaK 38|10.5&nbsp;cm L/65]] and sixteen [[3.7 cm SK C/30|{{convert|3.7|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] L/83, and initially twelve [[2 cm FlaK 30|{{convert|2|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}} C/30]] antiaircraft guns. The number of 2&nbsp;cm guns was eventually increased to 58. After 1942, eight {{convert|53.3|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} above-water [[torpedo tube]]s were installed in two quadruple mounts, one mount on each side of the ship.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} \n\nAs built, ''Tirpitz'' was equipped with Model 23 search radars{{efn|Named FuMO for ''Funkmessortungsger\u00e4t'' (Radio direction-finding device).{{sfn|Williamson|p=42}}}} mounted on the forward, foretop, and rear rangefinders.

The ship would be able to attack convoys bound for the Soviet Union, as well as act as a [[fleet in being]] to tie down British naval assets and deter an Allied invasion of Norway. Hitler, who had forbidden an Atlantic sortie after the loss of ''Bismarck'', agreed to the proposal. The ship was taken into dock for modifications for the deployment. The ship's antiaircraft battery was strengthened, and the 10.5&nbsp;cm guns on the superstructure next to the [[Aircraft catapult#Interwar and World War II|catapult]] were moved outboard to increase their field of fire.

It took the Germans three months to replenish the fuel spent in the attempt to intercept the two Allied convoys. [[Convoy PQ 17]], which left Iceland on 27 June bound for the Soviet Union, was the next convoy targeted by ''Tirpitz'' and the rest of the German fleet stationed in Norway,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} during [[Operation R\u00f6sselsprung (1942)|''Unternehmen R\u00f6sselsprung'']] ([[Knight (chess)#Movement|Operation Knight's Move]]).{{sfn|Sweetman|p=54}} Escorting the convoy were the battleships ''Duke of York'' and {{USS|Washington|BB-56|6}} and the carrier ''Victorious''.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} ''Tirpitz'', {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}}, and six destroyers sortied from Trondheim, while a second task force consisting of {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}}, ''Admiral Scheer'', and six destroyers operated out of [[Narvik]] and Bogenfjord.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=253\u2013255}} ''L\u00fctzow'' and three of the destroyers struck uncharted rocks while en route to the rendezvous and had to return to port.

By this time, the ship needed a major overhaul. Hitler had forbidden the ship to make the dangerous return to Germany, and so the overhaul was conducted in Trondheim. On 23 October, the ship left Bogenfjord and returned to F\u00e6ttenfjord outside Trondheim. The defences of the anchorage were further strengthened; additional anti-aircraft guns were installed, and double anti-torpedo nets were erected around the vessel. The repairs were conducted in limited phases, such that ''Tirpitz'' would remain partially operational for the majority of the overhaul. A [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] was built around the stern to allow the replacement of the ship's rudders.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}} During the repair process, the British attempted to attack the battleship with two [[Chariot manned torpedo|Chariot]] [[human torpedo]]es, but before they could be launched, rough seas caused the human torpedoes to break away from the fishing vessel which was towing them.{{sfn|Bishop|pp=165\u2013172}} By 28 December, the overhaul had been completed, and ''Tirpitz'' began sea trials.

The flooding damaged all of the turbo-generators in generator room No. 2, and all apart from one generator in generator room No.&nbsp;1 were disabled by broken steam lines or severed power cables. Turret Dora was thrown from its bearings and could not be rotated; this was particularly significant, as there were no heavy-lift cranes in Norway powerful enough to lift the turret and place it back on its bearings.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=259\u2013261}} The ship's two [[Arado Ar 196]] floatplanes were thrown by the explosive concussion and completely destroyed.

Repair work began in early May; destroyers ferried important equipment and workers from Kiel to Altafjord over the span of three days. By 2&nbsp;June, the ship was again able to steam under her own power, and by the end of the month gunnery trials were possible.

The damage persuaded the naval command to repair the ship for use only as a floating gun battery. Repair work was estimated to take nine months, but patching of the holes could be effected within a few weeks, allowing ''Tirpitz'' to be moved further south to [[Troms\u00f8]]. On 15 October, the ship made the {{convert|200|nmi|abbr=on}} trip to Troms\u00f8 under her own power, the last voyage of her career.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}}\n\nThe RAF made a second attempt on 29 October, after the ship was moored off [[H\u00e5k\u00f8ya]] Island outside Troms\u00f8. Thirty-two Lancasters attacked the ship with Tallboys during [[Operation Obviate]].{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} As on Operation Paravane, [[No. IX Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;9 Squadron]] and [[No. 617 Squadron]] carried out the attack together, which resulted in only one near miss,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} partially the result of bad weather over the target.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=193}} The underwater explosion damaged the port rudder and shaft and caused some flooding. ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s 38&nbsp;cm fragmentation shells proved ineffective in countering the high-level bombers; one aircraft was damaged by ground-based anti-aircraft guns.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} Following the attack, the ship's anchorage was significantly improved. A large sand bank was constructed under and around the ship to prevent her from capsizing, and anti-torpedo nets were installed. ''Tirpitz'' retained a one-degree list to port from earlier damage, and this was not corrected by counter-flooding to retain as much reserve buoyancy as possible. The ship was also prepared for her role as a floating artillery platform: fuel was limited to only what was necessary to power the turbo-generators, and the crew was reduced to 1,600 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=270}}\n\n==== Operation Catechism ====\n[[File:1944-11-22 RAF Sinks Tirpitz.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=0:10|[[Universal Newsreel]] about the attack on ''Tirpitz'']]\n{{main|Operation Catechism}}\n\n[[Operation Catechism]], the final British attack on ''Tirpitz'', took place on 12 November 1944.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The ship again used her 38&nbsp;cm guns against the bombers, which approached the battleship at 09:35; ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s main guns forced the bombers to disperse temporarily, but could not break up the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}} A force of 32 Lancasters from Nos.&nbsp;9 and 617 Squadrons dropped 29 Tallboys on the ship, with two direct hits and one near miss.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} Several other bombs landed within the anti-torpedo net barrier and caused significant cratering of the seabed; this removed much of the sandbank that had been constructed to prevent the ship from capsizing. One bomb penetrated the ship's deck between turrets Anton and Bruno but failed to explode. A second hit [[amidships]] between the aircraft catapult and the funnel and caused severe damage. A very large hole was blown in the ship's side and bottom; the entire section of belt armour abreast of the bomb hit was completely destroyed. A third bomb may have struck the ship on the port side of turret Caesar.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}}\n\nThe amidships hit caused significant flooding and quickly increased the port list to between 15 and 20&nbsp;degrees. In ten minutes the list increased to 30 to 40&nbsp;degrees; the captain issued the order to abandon ship. Progressive flooding increased the list to 60&nbsp;degrees by 09:50, though this appeared to stabilise temporarily. Eight minutes later, a large explosion rocked turret Caesar. The turret roof and part of the rotating structure were thrown {{convert|25|m|abbr=on}} into the air and over into a group of men swimming to shore, crushing them. ''Tirpitz'' rapidly rolled over and buried her superstructure in the sea floor.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=273}}\n\n[[File:Troms\u00f6, Royal Air Force Bomber Command, 1942-1945 CL2830.jpg|thumb|left|''Tirpitz'' capsized]]\nIn the aftermath of the attack, 82 men trapped in the upturned hull were rescued by cutting through the exposed bottom.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} Figures for the death toll vary from approximately 950 to 1,204.{{efn|John Sweetman states that 1,000 out of a crew of 1,900 were killed,{{sfn|Sweetman|p=248}} while Niklas Zetterling and Michael Tamelander estimated nearly 1,000 deaths.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=327}} Siegfried Breyer and [[Erich Gr\u00f6ner]] agree on 1,204 deaths,{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}}{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} and Gordon Williamson gives the death toll at 971.{{sfn|Williamson|p=40}} William Dulin and Robert Dulin place the number of deaths at \"about 950.\"{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=273}}}} Approximately 200 survivors of the sinking were transferred to the heavy cruiser ''L\u00fctzow'' in January 1945.{{sfn|Prager|p=287}}\n\nThe performance of the Luftwaffe in the defence of ''Tirpitz'' was heavily criticised after her loss.

He was court-martialled in Oslo and threatened with the death penalty. Evidence was presented that his unit had failed to help the Kriegsmarine when requested.

They have long, thin legs; a pointy, downward curving bill; and a brush-like tipped tongue. Adult males are covered in brown feathers, have red crowns and under parts; a black mask around their eyes; and white throats. Females and younger chats are colored similarly, but with paler markings. The males are usually more brightly colored than females, specifically during the breeding season in order to attract a mate.\n\n==='''Similar species'''===\nA bird species similar to and often confused with the crimson chat is the male [[red-capped robin]], whose scientific name is ''Petroica goodenovii''. However, there are three main differences between their characteristics. A male crimson chat has crimson crown and underparts, white throat and a yellow eye; whereas the red-capped robin has a black body with crimson chest and cap, white wing marks and a dark eye. Also, the crimson chat's bill is thinner and longer than the robin's. When a crimson chat is seen, a saltbush, ''Spinifex'', or mulga can usually be found nearby, as they are plants often associated with this species. According to relevant Federal and NSW organizations, the conservation of this bird is secure. Its only significant threat is being killed by predators.'''\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nCrimson chats can be found in deserts, semi-arid regions, woodlands, grasslands and coastal shrublands in the central part of Australia from the west coast to the Great Dividing Range and from the tropics to the south coast. Generally, they tend to inhabit areas on the fringes of wet regions, where it is more dry. They live in various types of shrubland: saltbush, bluebush, acacia and samphire. They move to wetter areas when rainfall is insufficient, which means that there are not enough nutrients produced for the birds to consume. Flocks of crimson chats may wander over a wide area around their range in order to track rain. This nomadic movement helps them find the best flowers and nectar. However, chats do not follow routine seasonal migrations.\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[Image:Crimson Chat female.jpg|thumb|left|Female]]\n\n===Diet===\nCrimson chats eat insects and spiders that are on the ground or in shrubs, and they can use their brush-like tongue to extract nectar or take seeds from flowers close to the ground. They walk more often than they hop and are usually seen on or near the ground.\n\n===Breeding===\nCrimson chats are found in small flocks and go in pairs throughout the breeding season and the rest of the year. Chats have a long breeding season from August to November and a shorter period after the rain season from March to April. These flocks form clusters of nests, which are defended by both the male and female chats. Most calls are soft, metallic twangs (\u2018dik it - dik it\u2019) or high pitched whistles (like \u2018see\u2019 or 'seet'). When agitated they make a chattering sound (a quick \u2018check - check\u2019), which is where their name originates.\n\nIn this species, both sexes help build a nest in a cup shape, which is located close to the ground. It is usually made with grass, rootlets, hair, feathers and twigs. The female lays 2 to 5 pink and white, brown-red spotted eggs, approximately 1\u20132&nbsp;cm (\u00bd inch) in length and width. Both parents help incubate the eggs for around two weeks and feed the young birds once they have hatched until they can fly on their own to find food. If a predator comes near the nest either parent will fake an injury to distract the creature away from the nest. Predators include cats, snakes, foxes and larger birds like ravens.\n\n'''Summary of Facts''' <br />'''Minimum Size:''' 11&nbsp;cm<br />'''Maximum Size:''' 13&nbsp;cm<br />'''Average Size:''' 12&nbsp;cm<br />'''Minimum Weight:''' 9 g<br />'''Maximum Weight:''' 12 g<br />'''Average Weight:''' 10.5 g<br />'''Breeding Season:''' August to October (or any time after rain)<br />'''Clutch Size:''' 2 to 4<br />'''Incubation:''' 14 days<br />'''Time in Nest:''' 14 days<br />'''Egg Size:''' 17x14&nbsp;mm\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* \"Honeyeaters and Australian Chats.\"Firefly Encyclopedia of Birds. 1st ed. 2003.\n* Perrins, Christopher. \"Australian Chats.\"Birds: Their Life, Their Ways, Their World. 3rd ed. 1979.\n* \"Australian Chats: Epthianuridae.\" 21 Dec 2003. 13 Dec 2006 [http://montereybay.com/creagrus/Australian_chats.html].\n* \"Australian Chat.\" Ebsco Animals.

They have long, thin legs; a pointy, downward curving bill; and a brush-like tipped tongue. Adult males are covered in brown feathers, have red crowns and under parts; a black mask around their eyes; and white throats. Females and younger chats are colored similarly, but with paler markings. The males are usually more brightly colored than females, specifically during the breeding season in order to attract a mate.\n\n==='''Similar species'''===\nA bird species similar to and often confused with the crimson chat is the male [[red-capped robin]], whose scientific name is ''Petroica goodenovii''. However, there are three main differences between their characteristics. A male crimson chat has crimson crown and underparts, white throat and a yellow eye; whereas the red-capped robin has a black body with crimson chest and cap, white wing marks and a dark eye. Also, the crimson chat's bill is thinner and longer than the robin's. When a crimson chat is seen, a saltbush, ''Spinifex'', or mulga can usually be found nearby, as they are plants often associated with this species. According to relevant Federal and NSW organizations, the conservation of this bird is secure. Its only significant threat is being killed by predators.'''\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nCrimson chats can be found in deserts, semi-arid regions, woodlands, grasslands and coastal shrublands in the central part of Australia from the west coast to the Great Dividing Range and from the tropics to the south coast. Generally, they tend to inhabit areas on the fringes of wet regions, where it is more dry. They live in various types of shrubland: saltbush, bluebush, acacia and samphire. They move to wetter areas when rainfall is insufficient, which means that there are not enough nutrients produced for the birds to consume. Flocks of crimson chats may wander over a wide area around their range in order to track rain. This nomadic movement helps them find the best flowers and nectar. However, chats do not follow routine seasonal migrations.\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[Image:Crimson Chat female.jpg|thumb|left|Female]]\n\n===Diet===\nCrimson chats eat insects and spiders that are on the ground or in shrubs, and they can use their brush-like tongue to extract nectar or take seeds from flowers close to the ground. They walk more often than they hop and are usually seen on or near the ground.\n\n===Breeding===\nCrimson chats are found in small flocks and go in pairs throughout the breeding season and the rest of the year. Chats have a long breeding season from August to November and a shorter period after the rain season from March to April. These flocks form clusters of nests, which are defended by both the male and female chats. Most calls are soft, metallic twangs (\u2018dik it - dik it\u2019) or high pitched whistles (like \u2018see\u2019 or 'seet'). When agitated they make a chattering sound (a quick \u2018check - check\u2019), which is where their name originates.\n\nIn this species, both sexes help build a nest in a cup shape, which is located close to the ground. It is usually made with grass, rootlets, hair, feathers and twigs. The female lays 2 to 5 pink and white, brown-red spotted eggs, approximately 1\u20132&nbsp;cm (\u00bd inch) in length and width. Both parents help incubate the eggs for around two weeks and feed the young birds once they have hatched until they can fly on their own to find food. If a predator comes near the nest either parent will fake an injury to distract the creature away from the nest. Predators include cats, snakes, foxes and larger birds like ravens.\n\n==== Summary of Facts ==== <br />'''Minimum Size:''' 11&nbsp;cm<br />'''Maximum Size:''' 13&nbsp;cm<br />'''Average Size:''' 12&nbsp;cm<br />'''Minimum Weight:''' 9 g<br />'''Maximum Weight:''' 12 g<br />'''Average Weight:''' 10.5 g<br />'''Breeding Season:''' August to October (or any time after rain)<br />'''Clutch Size:''' 2 to 4<br />'''Incubation:''' 14 days<br />'''Time in Nest:''' 14 days<br />'''Egg Size:''' 17x14&nbsp;mm\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* \"Honeyeaters and Australian Chats.\"Firefly Encyclopedia of Birds. 1st ed. 2003.\n* Perrins, Christopher. \"Australian Chats.\"Birds: Their Life, Their Ways, Their World. 3rd ed. 1979.\n* \"Australian Chats: Epthianuridae.\" 21 Dec 2003. 13 Dec 2006 [http://montereybay.com/creagrus/Australian_chats.html].\n* \"Australian Chat.\" Ebsco Animals.
