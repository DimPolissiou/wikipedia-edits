He observes how policemen make money in the form of bribes, finding himself motivated to become a police officer, and succeeds. Getting bribes from some local thieves and a jeweller, Simmba enjoys and takes full advantage of the lifestyle of a corrupt cop.\n\nHe is soon transferred to Miramar police station, where he sees Shagun Sathe and falls in love with her at first sight. He meets his fellow policemen and one of his juniors, Nityanand Mohile, who is an honest constable, hesitates to salute Simmba as he's a corrupt cop. To prove his worth in Miramar, he interrupts a pub party run by Durva Yashwant Ranade's brothers, Sadashiv \"Sada\" Ranade and Gaurav \"Giri\" Ranade and demands more money from them, whilst promising that he will let them continue with their illegal activities. Durva agrees and uses Simmba to free a land from an old person Vaaman Rao, who is forced to sign the papers by Simmba. Meanwhile, Simmba develops motherly and sisterly bonds with several women and girls, one of whom happens to be Aakruti Dave, a young woman who reminds Simmba of his teacher.\n\nAakruti files a complaint against Sada and Giri for dealing illicit drugs in their pub and using children as peddlers. Simmba initially ignores this after being pacified by Durva, and Shagun in the meantime falls in love with him. Meanwhile, Aakruti learns about the drug racket in the club and goes there one night with Chotu, a mute boy who's her student. She videotapes by cell phone to show evidence to the police, but is caught by Sada and Giri. Chotu discreetly records Sada and Giri assaulting Aakruti and flees once both of them realise.\n\nAakruti is brutally raped and murdered by Sada and Giri. Chotu tries to tell Akruti's friend Kavya about Akruti being in danger. Kavya whilst being chased by Durva's goons goes to Simmba to file Aakruti's missing complaint. Aakruti is found injured in hospital. Simmba tries to talk to her but she dies, leaving him devastated. Police recover the phone and the video and Durva sends his goons to get the phone from Simmba, who is present, mends his ways, and fights them all. Simmba finally wears his police uniform and seeing this change in him, Mohile finally salutes him as they arrest Sada and Giri. He apologises to Vaaman Rao, and returns the land swindled from him. In the court, Simmba is shocked to find Aakruti's video being deleted. He beats up Durva's friend who gave a false statement in the court, leading to his suspension orders. He decides to kill Sada and Giri before he goes, and plans to show it as an encounter. He shoots them both and shows as if he killed them in an act of self-defence. A SIT committee is set up by the state, who question Simmba's encounter. To achieve clarity to the situation, Home Minister Vinayak Dutta appoints a neutral officer to handle Aakruti's case, as well as Simmba's controversial encounter.\n\nEnraged, Durva and his goons capture Simmba. Suddenly DCP Bajirao Singham comes to his rescue and both of them beat up Durva and his men. Singham tells Simmba that he is the officer, appointed by the committee to handle his case and gives a statement that Simmba killed Sadashiv and Gaurav in an act of self-defence. He also calls Dhurva's mother and wife, who each give a statement that it was Sadashiv and Gaurav who raped Aakruti and that the brothers ran a drug racket and several other criminal activities. Singham reveals that he helped Simmba despite being against his corrupt actions, so that he could instill a fear of law in the minds of men who do not respect women.\n\nAs Singham leaves Miramar Police Station, he is talking to DCP Veer Sooryavanshi<ref name=\"indtod\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/confirmed-akshay-kumar-will-romance-katrina-kaif-in-rohit-shetty-s-sooryavanshi-1507084-2019-04-22|title=Confirmed: Akshay Kumar will romance Katrina Kaif in Rohit Shetty's Sooryavanshi|website=India Today|access-date=22 April 2019|date=22 April 2019}}</ref> ([[Akshay Kumar]]).

In February 2018, a dispute between ''Kedarnath'' director [[Abhishek Kapoor]] and its producers [[KriArj Entertainment]] led to a lawsuit that threatened the completion of its production. Due to having free days as per the ''Kedarnath'' court case, Khan allotted those days to film with the ''Simmba'' crew; this decision was unfitting to Kapoor, who took Khan to court.  The case also had an effect on the release of the ''Kedarnath''; as the producers ended up losing several lucrative prospective release slots near the end of the year; it seemed as if the film would be releasing in 2019 and that ''Simmba'' would be instead Sara Ali Khan's debut film.  Several media outlets speculated and even reported as such.  However, when the producers' of Ajay Devgn-starrer ''[[Total Dhamaal]]'' relinquished their 7 December release date in favour of late February 2019, RSVP Movies was quick to secure it for ''Kedarnath.''<ref name=\"timesnownews.com2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/bollywood-news/article/kedarnath-dialogue-promo-unabashed-sara-ali-khan-asks-for-sushant-singh-rajput-s-attention/325692|title=Kedarnath dialogue promo: Unabashed Sara Ali Khan asks for Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019s attention {{!}} Bollywood News|website=www.timesnownews.com|language=en-GB|access-date=6 December 2018}}</ref> This allowed Khan to debut with it and keep ''Simmba'' as her second film, as was originally planned.-->\n\nIn October 2018, lead actors Singh and Khan left for Switzerland to film a song sequence for the film.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/photos/simmba-ranveer-singh-and-sara-ali-khan-head-switzerland-428723|title=Simmba: Ranveer Singh and Sara Ali Khan head to Switzerland|website=PINKVILLA|access-date=9 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118121246/https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/photos/simmba-ranveer-singh-and-sara-ali-khan-head-switzerland-428723|archive-date=18 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> By late October, the crew had returned to Mumbai to film a second song, \"Aankh Marey\"\u2014a remake of a 90s classic song.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latestly.com/entertainment/sara-ali-khan-and-ranveer-singh-shoot-a-dance-number-for-simmba-view-pics-461510.html|title=Sara Ali Khan and Ranveer Singh Shoot a Dance Number for Simmba \u2013 View Pics|date= 30 October 2018|website=Latestly|access-date= 9 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nBecause Singh was to be married in November 2018, Shetty shot most of the major sequences before the wedding date.

He observes how policemen make money in the form of bribes, finding himself motivated to become a police officer, and succeeds. Getting bribes from some local thieves and a jeweller, Simmba enjoys and takes full advantage of the lifestyle of a corrupt cop.\n\nHe is soon transferred to Miramar police station, where he sees Shagun Sathe and falls in love with her at first sight. He meets his fellow policemen and one of his juniors, Nityanand Mohile, who is an honest constable, hesitates to salute Simmba as he's a corrupt cop. To prove his worth in Miramar, he interrupts a pub party run by Durva Yashwant Ranade's brothers, Sadashiv \"Sada\" Ranade and Gaurav \"Giri\" Ranade and demands more money from them, whilst promising that he will let them continue with their illegal activities. Durva agrees and uses Simmba to free a land from an old person Vaaman Rao, who is forced to sign the papers by Simmba. Meanwhile, Simmba develops motherly and sisterly bonds with several women and girls, one of whom happens to be Aakruti Dave, a young woman who reminds Simmba of his teacher.\n\nAakruti files a complaint against Sada and Giri for dealing illicit drugs in their pub and using children as peddlers. Simmba initially ignores this after being pacified by Durva, and Shagun in the meantime falls in love with him. Meanwhile, Aakruti learns about the drug racket in the club and goes there one night with Chotu, a mute boy who's her student. She videotapes by cell phone to show evidence to the police, but is caught by Sada and Giri. Chotu discreetly records Sada and Giri assaulting Aakruti and flees once both of them realise.\n\nAakruti is brutally raped and murdered by Sada and Giri. Chotu tries to tell Akruti's friend Kavya about Akruti being in danger. Kavya whilst being chased by Durva's goons goes to Simmba to file Aakruti's missing complaint. Aakruti is found injured in hospital. Simmba tries to talk to her but she dies, leaving him devastated. Police recover the phone and the video and Durva sends his goons to get the phone from Simmba, who is present, mends his ways, and fights them all. Simmba finally wears his police uniform and seeing this change in him, Mohile finally salutes him as they arrest Sada and Giri. He apologises to Vaaman Rao, and returns the land swindled from him. In the court, Simmba is shocked to find Aakruti's video being deleted. He beats up Durva's friend who gave a false statement in the court, leading to his suspension orders. He decides to kill Sada and Giri before he goes, and plans to show it as an encounter. He shoots them both and shows as if he killed them in an act of self-defence. A SIT committee is set up by the state, who question Simmba's encounter. To achieve clarity to the situation, Home Minister Vinayak Dutta appoints a neutral officer to handle Aakruti's case, as well as Simmba's controversial encounter.\n\nEnraged, Durva and his goons capture Simmba. Suddenly DCP Bajirao Singham comes to his rescue and both of them beat up Durva and his men. Singham tells Simmba that he is the officer, appointed by the committee to handle his case and gives a statement that Simmba killed Sadashiv and Gaurav in an act of self-defence. He also calls Dhurva's mother and wife, who each give a statement that it was Sadashiv and Gaurav who raped Aakruti and that the brothers ran a drug racket and several other criminal activities. Singham reveals that he helped Simmba despite being against his corrupt actions, so that he could instill a fear of law in the minds of men who do not respect women.\n\nAs Singham leaves Miramar Police Station, he is talking to DCP Veer Sooryavanshi<ref name=\"indtod\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/confirmed-akshay-kumar-will-romance-katrina-kaif-in-rohit-shetty-s-sooryavanshi-1507084-2019-04-22|title=Confirmed: Akshay Kumar will romance Katrina Kaif in Rohit Shetty's Sooryavanshi|website=India Today|access-date=22 April 2019|date=22 April 2019}}</ref> ([[Akshay Kumar]]).

In February 2018, a dispute between ''Kedarnath'' director [[Abhishek Kapoor]] and its producers [[KriArj Entertainment]] led to a lawsuit that threatened the completion of its production. Due to having free days as per the ''Kedarnath'' court case, Khan allotted those days to film with the ''Simmba'' crew; this decision was unfitting to Kapoor, who took Khan to court.  The case also had an effect on the release of the ''Kedarnath''; as the producers ended up losing several lucrative prospective release slots near the end of the year; it seemed as if the film would be releasing in 2019 and that ''Simmba'' would be instead Sara Ali Khan's debut film.  Several media outlets speculated and even reported as such.  However, when the producers' of Ajay Devgn-starrer ''[[Total Dhamaal]]'' relinquished their 7 December release date in favour of late February 2019, RSVP Movies was quick to secure it for ''Kedarnath.''<ref name=\"timesnownews.com2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/bollywood-news/article/kedarnath-dialogue-promo-unabashed-sara-ali-khan-asks-for-sushant-singh-rajput-s-attention/325692|title=Kedarnath dialogue promo: Unabashed Sara Ali Khan asks for Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019s attention {{!}} Bollywood News|website=www.timesnownews.com|language=en-GB|access-date=6 December 2018}}</ref> This allowed Khan to debut with it and keep ''Simmba'' as her second film, as was originally planned.-->\n\nIn October 2018, lead actors Singh and Khan left for Switzerland to film a song sequence for the film.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/photos/simmba-ranveer-singh-and-sara-ali-khan-head-switzerland-428723|title=Simmba: Ranveer Singh and Sara Ali Khan head to Switzerland|website=PINKVILLA|access-date=9 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118121246/https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/photos/simmba-ranveer-singh-and-sara-ali-khan-head-switzerland-428723|archive-date=18 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> By late October, the crew had returned to Mumbai to film a second song, \"Aankh Marey\"\u2014a remake of a 90s classic song.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latestly.com/entertainment/sara-ali-khan-and-ranveer-singh-shoot-a-dance-number-for-simmba-view-pics-461510.html|title=Sara Ali Khan and Ranveer Singh Shoot a Dance Number for Simmba \u2013 View Pics|date= 30 October 2018|website=Latestly|access-date= 9 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nBecause Singh was to be married in November 2018, Shetty shot most of the major sequences before the wedding date.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland and the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] team.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later.

Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]].

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

His debut season in the code continued to be an impressive one.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. They made efforts to organise a game with the newly formed Rotorua league team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8079\n| date = 1922-09-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220902.2.4\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nA game against the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] was also arranged which was a remarkable achievement in itself given that rugby league was not even played in the area until a month earlier. The match was between New South Wales and Bay of Plenty. George Iles naturally played and the team also featured future Kiwi [[George Gardiner (rugby league)|George Gardiner]] while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of [[Frank Burge]] and [[Reg Latta]]. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5 with Borell scoring a try and Joseph Rogers kicking a goal for the local team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kangaroos 29 Bay of Plenty 5\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8101\n| date = 1922-09-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220928.2.33\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga again made history by playing in the first ever rugby league game in [[Te Puke]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

These efforts to grow the game in the area, while somewhat remarkable, ultimately proved futile and Iles returned to the rugby union field the following season.\n\n===Back to Rugby Union===\nIn 1923 he played for Tauranga rugby team against Te Puke in [[Te Puke]] and then again in the return match in [[Tauranga]].

They then beat Whakatane in the semi final.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland and the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] team.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. They made efforts to organise a game with the newly formed Rotorua league team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8079\n| date = 1922-09-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220902.2.4\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He was still playing rugby union through this period and played for Tauranga in a drawn match with Rangataua in June\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rugby Union's Cup Matches Continued/Tauranga and Rangataua Play a Draw\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8007\n| date = 1922-06-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220612.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. On August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nOn the 16th of September history was made in Tauranga with the first ever game of rugby keague played there. Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nA game against the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] was also arranged which was a remarkable achievement in itself given that rugby league was not even played in the area until a month earlier. The match was between New South Wales and Bay of Plenty. George Iles naturally played and the team also featured future Kiwi [[George Gardiner (rugby league)|George Gardiner]] while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of [[Frank Burge]] and [[Reg Latta]]. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5 with Borell scoring a try and Joseph Rogers kicking a goal for the local team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kangaroos 29 Bay of Plenty 5\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8101\n| date = 1922-09-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220928.2.33\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga again made history by playing in the first ever rugby league game in [[Te Puke]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. On October 14 Tauranga played a match on the Waihi Recreation Ground and lost 6-19 in front of a large attendance, Iles again leading the Tauranga team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =The Waihi-Tauranga League Match\n| page =2\n| publisher =Waihi Daily Telegraph, Volume XX, Issue 6741\n| date = 1922-10-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/WHDT19221016.2.23\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>. These efforts to grow the game in the area, while somewhat remarkable, ultimately proved futile and Iles returned to the rugby union field the following season.\n\n===Back to Rugby Union===\nIn 1923 he played for Tauranga rugby team against Te Puke in [[Te Puke]] and then again in the return match in [[Tauranga]]. He was also turning out for the Cadets Old Boys senior side in the club competition <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rugby Football on Monday Next/Te Puke Representatives to Visit Tauranga\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8302\n| date = 1923-05-31\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19230531.2.14\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

They then beat Whakatane in the semi final. On August 2 [[Karl Ifwersen]] brought down a team from Auckland from the Grammar Old Boys, College Rifles and Ponsonby clubs to play against a Tauranga XV captained by George Iles.
