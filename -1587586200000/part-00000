It included the parishes of East Carroll (after the split in 1877), Concordia, Madison and Tensas.<ref>John C. Rodrigue, ''Reconstruction in the Cane Fields: From Slavery to Free Labor in Louisiana's Sugar Parishes, 1862--1880'', LSU Press, 2001, p. 176</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nBefore being divided, Carroll Parish was named for [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]], [[Maryland]], the only [[Roman Catholic]] signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the last surviving signer of the document. It was organized by European Americans after the Louisiana Purchase.\n\nWest Carroll Parish has a long history of inhabitants who predated the formation of the United States by thousands of years. For a complete history of West Carroll Parish, see ''Between the Rivers'' by Florence McKoin, Claitor\u2019s Publishing Company of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]].\n\nOn the south end of West Carroll Parish is [[Poverty Point]], a nearly square-mile complex of ancient major [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] semi-circles and radiating lanes, plus additional [[platform mounds]].  This is one of the largest Native American earthworks in North America. [[Archeologists]] have determined that the site was built in the Late [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]] beginning about 1500 BCE, and it was the central trading grounds for the [[Poverty Point culture]] that occupied the lower Mississippi River Valley. It has been referred to as the [[New York City]] of more than two millennia ago. Artifacts show trading reached to present-day [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Great Lakes]] states such as [[Wisconsin]]. Later historic tribes in the area included the [[Choctaw]] and [[Chickasaw]].\n\nThough the area was explored by many French and Spanish in the 16th through 18th centuries, they did not establish permanent settlements, favoring areas on rivers with more direct access to the Gulf and major markets.\n\n===US annexation and development===\nAfter the United States' [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, all of Northeast Louisiana was considered part of [[Ouachita Parish]], including West Carroll. In 1807, a [[Methodist]] minister, Moses Floyd, settled on the west bank of the [[Bayou Macon]]. Later a trading post known as \"Floyd\" developed, and the village began to grow. It developed less than a mile from the Poverty Point site.\n\nAs the European-American population of Ouachita Parish continued to increase, the area was organized into smaller parishes; in 1832 [[Carroll Parish]] was carved out of Ouachita by the state legislature. This was in the period of [[Indian Removal]], when most members of local tribes were moved to [[Indian Territory]] (now Oklahoma) in order to extinguish their land claims in Louisiana.\n\nThe parish seat was located in [[Lake Providence]] on the banks of the Mississippi River. Throughout the early part of the 19th century, the European-American population of the western portion of Carroll Parish continued to grow; its economy was based mainly on cotton production and timber. By 1855 the population had grown to the point where there were enough votes to move the parish seat west of the [[Bayou Macon]] and [[Floyd, Louisiana|Floyd]] was selected.  This area had developed into a thriving trading post due to [[steamboat]] traffic on the Macon. In 1856 construction began on the new courthouse, which was finished in late 1857.\n\nWith the move of the parish seat, more professionals and tradesmen settled in Floyd, and the town grew markedly. It developed as a typical frontier town with a hotel, post office, general store, and saloons.\n\nIn January 1861 the Louisiana Legislature voted to secede from the Union and declare itself a free and sovereign state. Less than two months later, Louisiana joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. According to the book, ''Between the Rivers,'' the war resulted in a divide that would eventually lead to the creation of West Carroll Parish:\n<blockquote>\nWhen the Confederate Flag flew over the court house in Floyd, it was saluted by nearly everyone, but not so with our neighbors across the river. Plantation|Planters to the east, either out of conviction to their consciences or to save their property, signed an oath of allegiance to the United States, thus bringing a rift among neighbors who were willing to lose everything including their lives, for the cause of the South; and, they felt very bitter toward any neighbor signing such an oath.</blockquote> (Note: This oath was required after Union forces occupied Louisiana.)\n\nThere was little fighting in this area associated with the Civil War. Union efforts were focused on trying to gain and maintain control of the Mississippi River, especially at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]].\n\nSome historians believed that [[insurgent]] activity, such as the [[Quantrill Gang]], which operated primarily in [[Missouri]], replaced regular forces. This area was isolated and vast lowland swamps surrounded Floyd. [[Frank James]] was said to come through with Quantrill in the winter of 1863-1864, on their way to and from Texas. In the early 1870s during Reconstruction, Frank and his brother [[Jesse James]] continued their outlaw  activities, robbing banks for personal gain from Missouri to Texas.\n\nDuring the [[Reconstruction era]], local leaders opposed those appointed by the federally appointed state government. Some people worked against the provision of rights to [[freedmen]]. In the 1870s, chapters of the [[White League]] developed throughout Louisiana, [[paramilitary]] groups that intimidated Republicans, suppressed voting by freedmen, and supported white Democrats returning to power in the state legislature.\n\n===Post-Reconstruction to present===\nFederal troops were withdrawn from the state in March 1877 as part of a federal compromise. Soon after white Democrats regained power in the state legislature, they approved the creation of West Carroll Parish, which had a majority-white population. Initially it had a population of 800 people and 200 families, both white and black.  East Carroll Parish was majority black, as it had been the center of cotton plantation agriculture, dependent on the labor of numerous enslaved African Americans. After emancipation, they voted in support of the Republican Party.\n\nCotton and timber continued to be the life-blood of the new parish, although areas dependent on agriculture in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century had economic difficulties.  The parish had ten cotton gins and three sawmills, and steamboats continued to run Bayou Macon as the main hub of transportation.  Steamboat traffic on the Boeuf and Macon rivers dwindled due to the competition of [[railways]] constructed through the South. With the railroad, parish towns began to develop along the north-south road (La. 17). Among these were Pioneer, Forest, Oak Grove and Kilbourne. Closest to the parish seat and with a major sawmill, Pioneer grew rapidly.\n\nIn January 1909, Oak Grove was incorporated.  Many of the parish\u2019s prominent citizens, such as Leopold Lipp, considered it as the intersection of the North-South and East-West (La. 2) roads. It was to become the economic center of the parish in the near future.\n\nIn 1915, an election was held to move the parish seat from Floyd to a town located on the railroad. The two towns competing for the honor were Oak Grove and Pioneer. With the largest population living in the south end of the parish, the people of Pioneer felt confident they would get the seat; but, the people of the north end of the parish gained the selection of [[Oak Grove, West Carroll Parish, Louisiana|Oak Grove]] by a small margin.  With the parish seat moved, Pioneer began to decline.\n\nIn 1916, construction began on the new courthouse at Oak Grove. Before it was completed, a hail storm and tornado devastated the town late that year. It destroyed the first theater, a large majority of the new courthouse, and many other buildings in town. In January 1917 the new courthouse was opened, and so began of the modern era of Oak Grove.  Its Main Street had businesses varying from general stores, drug stores, a modern theater, cafes, two banks and more.\n\nThe economy of the parish continued to be dominated by the timber and cotton industry. In the early part of the 20th century, Donald B. Fiske opened a state-of the art [[cotton gin]] and compress to complement his sawmill.  It became one of the largest employers of the parish.\n\nAfter World War II, the town and parish continued to prosper with new industry and business.  In 1950, the most modern movie theatre in the South was opened by Fiske, and it is still in operation today. In this area, farmers began to cultivate sweet potatoes rather than cotton. The textile industry gradually moved out of southern mills to offshore locations out of the United States.  A cannery was built along the railroad, and operated until near the end of the 20th century.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, city growth continued, with the construction of a modern hospital and nursing home, and the Wells Lamont garment factory. In 1969 the entrepreneur Shelton Ruffin built a pre-manufactured pole barn for personal use. Its style and construction quickly gained in popularity around the region, thus spurring the formation of Ruffin Building Systems. It is now one of the largest manufacturers of metal buildings in the South and ships buildings internationally.\n\nWith the coming of the 1980s and the rise of the large department stores in malls, business on Main Street began to decline.  But this historic district continues to remain vibrant with over 50 percent of its buildings occupied.\n\nBy the early 21st century, entertainment and retail shopping have become major parts of the economy in West Carroll. In 2004 the Thomas Jason Lingo Community Center opened with a 1,000-seat auditorium; it has many live events each year.  The Fiske Theatre has been renovated and returned to regular operation as a first-run movie theatre. Both of these venues attract families from all over Northeast Louisiana and Southeast Arkansas to the parish for entertainment. The opening of a Super [[Wal-Mart]] in 2006 has contributed to West Carroll becoming a regional retail hub.\n\nToday agriculture is still king in West Carroll; the main crops are corn, rice, cotton, and sweet potatoes. But the largest employers are West Carroll Health Systems, West Carroll School Board, Ruffin Building Systems, and Wal-Mart.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 11,604.<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/22/22123.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=August 18, 2013}}</ref> The [[parish seat]] is [[Oak Grove, West Carroll Parish, Louisiana|Oak Grove]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> The parish was founded in 1877, when Carroll Parish was divided.<ref>{{cite web|title=West Carroll Parish|url=http://ccet.louisiana.edu/tourism/parishes/North_Louisiana/westcarroll.html|publisher=Center for Cultural and Eco-Tourism|accessdate=September 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe area of cotton culture in Louisiana in parishes along this part of the Mississippi River was also referred to as the [[Natchez District]]. It included the parishes of East Carroll (after the split in 1877), Concordia, Madison and Tensas.<ref>John C. Rodrigue, ''Reconstruction in the Cane Fields: From Slavery to Free Labor in Louisiana's Sugar Parishes, 1862--1880'', LSU Press, 2001, p. 176</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nBefore being divided, Carroll Parish was named for [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]], [[Maryland]], the only [[Roman Catholic]] signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the last surviving signer of the document. It was organized by European Americans after the Louisiana Purchase.\n\nWest Carroll Parish has a long history of inhabitants who predated the formation of the United States by thousands of years. For a complete history of West Carroll Parish, see ''Between the Rivers'' by Florence McKoin, Claitor\u2019s Publishing Company of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]].\n\nOn the south end of West Carroll Parish is [[Poverty Point]], a nearly square-mile complex of ancient major [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] semi-circles and radiating lanes, plus additional [[platform mounds]].  This is one of the largest Native American earthworks in North America. [[Archeologists]] have determined that the site was built in the Late [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]] beginning about 1500 BCE, and it was the central trading grounds for the [[Poverty Point culture]] that occupied the lower Mississippi River Valley. It has been referred to as the [[New York City]] of more than two millennia ago. Artifacts show trading reached to present-day [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Great Lakes]] states such as [[Wisconsin]]. Later historic tribes in the area included the [[Choctaw]] and [[Chickasaw]].\n\nThough the area was explored by many French and Spanish in the 16th through 18th centuries, they did not establish permanent settlements, favoring areas on rivers with more direct access to the Gulf and major markets.\n\n===US annexation and development===\nAfter the United States' [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, all of Northeast Louisiana was considered part of [[Ouachita Parish]], including West Carroll. In 1807, a [[Methodist]] minister, Moses Floyd, settled on the west bank of the [[Bayou Macon]]. Later a trading post known as \"Floyd\" developed, and the village began to grow. It developed less than a mile from the Poverty Point site.\n\nAs the European-American population of Ouachita Parish continued to increase, the area was organized into smaller parishes; in 1832 [[Carroll Parish]] was carved out of Ouachita by the state legislature. This was in the period of [[Indian Removal]], when most members of local tribes were moved to [[Indian Territory]] (now Oklahoma) in order to extinguish their land claims in Louisiana.\n\nThe parish seat was located in [[Lake Providence]] on the banks of the Mississippi River. Throughout the early part of the 19th century, the European-American population of the western portion of Carroll Parish continued to grow; its economy was based mainly on cotton production and timber. By 1855 the population had grown to the point where there were enough votes to move the parish seat west of the [[Bayou Macon]] and [[Floyd, Louisiana|Floyd]] was selected.  This area had developed into a thriving trading post due to [[steamboat]] traffic on the Macon. In 1856 construction began on the new courthouse, which was finished in late 1857.\n\nWith the move of the parish seat, more professionals and tradesmen settled in Floyd, and the town grew markedly. It developed as a typical frontier town with a hotel, post office, general store, and saloons.\n\nIn January 1861 the Louisiana Legislature voted to secede from the Union and declare itself a free and sovereign state. Less than two months later, Louisiana joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. According to the book, ''Between the Rivers,'' the war resulted in a divide that would eventually lead to the creation of West Carroll Parish:\n<blockquote>\nWhen the Confederate Flag flew over the court house in Floyd, it was saluted by nearly everyone, but not so with our neighbors across the river. Plantation|Planters to the east, either out of conviction to their consciences or to save their property, signed an oath of allegiance to the United States, thus bringing a rift among neighbors who were willing to lose everything including their lives, for the cause of the South; and, they felt very bitter toward any neighbor signing such an oath.</blockquote> (Note: This oath was required after Union forces occupied Louisiana.)\n\nThere was little fighting in this area associated with the Civil War. Union efforts were focused on trying to gain and maintain control of the Mississippi River, especially at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]].\n\nSome historians believed that [[insurgent]] activity, such as the [[Quantrill Gang]], which operated primarily in [[Missouri]], replaced regular forces. This area was isolated and vast lowland swamps surrounded Floyd. [[Frank James]] was said to come through with Quantrill in the winter of 1863-1864, on their way to and from Texas. In the early 1870s during Reconstruction, Frank and his brother [[Jesse James]] continued their outlaw  activities, robbing banks for personal gain from Missouri to Texas.\n\nDuring the [[Reconstruction era]], local leaders opposed those appointed by the federally appointed state government. Some people worked against the provision of rights to [[freedmen]]. In the 1870s, chapters of the [[White League]] developed throughout Louisiana, [[paramilitary]] groups that intimidated Republicans, suppressed voting by freedmen, and supported white Democrats returning to power in the state legislature.\n\n===Post-Reconstruction to present===\nFederal troops were withdrawn from the state in March 1877 as part of a federal compromise. Soon after white Democrats regained power in the state legislature, they approved the creation of West Carroll Parish, which had a majority-white population. Initially it had a population of 800 people and 200 families, both white and black.  East Carroll Parish was majority black, as it had been the center of cotton plantation agriculture, dependent on the labor of numerous enslaved African Americans. After emancipation, they voted in support of the Republican Party.\n\nCotton and timber continued to be the life-blood of the new parish, although areas dependent on agriculture in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century had economic difficulties.  The parish had ten cotton gins and three sawmills, and steamboats continued to run Bayou Macon as the main hub of transportation.  Steamboat traffic on the Boeuf and Macon rivers dwindled due to the competition of [[railways]] constructed through the South. With the railroad, parish towns began to develop along the north-south road (La. 17). Among these were Pioneer, Forest, Oak Grove and Kilbourne. Closest to the parish seat and with a major sawmill, Pioneer grew rapidly.\n\nIn January 1909, Oak Grove was incorporated.  Many of the parish\u2019s prominent citizens, such as Leopold Lipp, considered it as the intersection of the North-South and East-West (La. 2) roads. It was to become the economic center of the parish in the near future.\n\nIn 1915, an election was held to move the parish seat from Floyd to a town located on the railroad. The two towns competing for the honor were Oak Grove and Pioneer. With the largest population living in the south end of the parish, the people of Pioneer felt confident they would get the seat; but, the people of the north end of the parish gained the selection of [[Oak Grove, West Carroll Parish, Louisiana|Oak Grove]] by a small margin.  With the parish seat moved, Pioneer began to decline.\n\nIn 1916, construction began on the new courthouse at Oak Grove. Before it was completed, a hail storm and tornado devastated the town late that year. It destroyed the first theater, a large majority of the new courthouse, and many other buildings in town. In January 1917 the new courthouse was opened, and so began of the modern era of Oak Grove.  Its Main Street had businesses varying from general stores, drug stores, a modern theater, cafes, two banks and more.\n\nThe economy of the parish continued to be dominated by the timber and cotton industry. In the early part of the 20th century, Donald B. Fiske opened a state-of the art [[cotton gin]] and compress to complement his sawmill.  It became one of the largest employers of the parish.\n\nAfter World War II, the town and parish continued to prosper with new industry and business.  In 1950, the most modern movie theatre in the South was opened by Fiske, and it is still in operation today. In this area, farmers began to cultivate sweet potatoes rather than cotton. The textile industry gradually moved out of southern mills to offshore locations out of the United States.  A cannery was built along the railroad, and operated until near the end of the 20th century.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, city growth continued, with the construction of a modern hospital and nursing home, and the Wells Lamont garment factory. In 1969 the entrepreneur Shelton Ruffin built a pre-manufactured pole barn for personal use. Its style and construction quickly gained in popularity around the region, thus spurring the formation of Ruffin Building Systems. It is now one of the largest manufacturers of metal buildings in the South and ships buildings internationally.\n\nWith the coming of the 1980s and the rise of the large department stores in malls, business on Main Street began to decline.  But this historic district continues to remain vibrant with over 50 percent of its buildings occupied.\n\nBy the early 21st century, entertainment and retail shopping have become major parts of the economy in West Carroll. In 2004 the Thomas Jason Lingo Community Center opened with a 1,000-seat auditorium; it has many live events each year.  The Fiske Theatre has been renovated and returned to regular operation as a first-run movie theatre. Both of these venues attract families from all over Northeast Louisiana and Southeast Arkansas to the parish for entertainment. The opening of a Super [[Wal-Mart]] in 2006 has contributed to West Carroll becoming a regional retail hub.\n\nToday agriculture is still king in West Carroll; the main crops are corn, rice, cotton, and sweet potatoes. But the largest employers are West Carroll Health Systems, West Carroll School Board, Ruffin Building Systems, and Wal-Mart. West Carroll has five banking institutions to serve people\u2019s financial needs.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the parish has a total area of {{convert|361|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|360|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|0.9|sqmi}} (0.3%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 2, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928155956/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|archivedate=September 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Major highways===\n*[[Image:Louisiana 2.svg|20px]] [[Louisiana Highway 2]]\n*[[Image:Louisiana 17.svg|20px]] [[Louisiana Highway 17]]\n\n===Adjacent counties and parishes===\n*[[Chicot County, Arkansas|Chicot County]], [[Arkansas]]  (north)\n*[[East Carroll Parish, Louisiana|East Carroll Parish]]  (east)\n*[[Richland Parish, Louisiana|Richland Parish]]  (south)\n*[[Morehouse Parish, Louisiana|Morehouse Parish]]  (west)\n\n===National protected area===\n* [[Poverty Point National Monument]]\n\n==Law enforcement==\nThe West Carroll Sheriff's Office provides full-time law enforcement for the parish and has seventeen full-time deputies.

Managers can also use futures and options to hedge.\n\n==Products==\nIn addition to its fundamental long/short equity strategies, Marshall Wace runs a proprietary [[alpha capture system]] called TOPS (Trade Optimised Portfolio System), which polls the investment ideas of equity sell-side practitioners (generalists, sector specialists, strategists, and economists) around the world and uses algorithms to analyse and optimise this information into liquid equity portfolios.<ref name=\"NewYorkTimes2012July15MorgensonjulyGretchen\">{{cite news|last1=Morgensonjuly|first1=Gretchen|title=Surveys Give Big Investors an Early View From Analysts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/business/in-surveys-hedge-funds-see-early-views-of-stock-analysts.html|accessdate=17 May 2019|agency=The New York Times Company|issue=DealBook|publisher=New York Times|date=15 July 2012|location=United States|page=A1|language=English|url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\nMost of Marshall Wace's investors are major institutions.

The Canarii called the island '''Tamar\u00e1n''' ('land of the brave\").\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], after over a century of European incursions and attempts at conquest, the island was conquered on April 29, 1483 by the [[Crown of Castile]], under [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella I]]. The conquest succeeded after a campaign that lasted five years, and it was an important step towards the expansion of the unified Spain.\n\nThe capital city of [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] was founded on June 24, 1478, under the name \"Real de Las Palmas\", by [[Juan Rej\u00f3n]], head of the invading [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] army. In 1492, [[Christopher Columbus]] anchored in the [[Port of Las Palmas]] (and spent some time on the island) on his first trip to the Americas. Las Palmas de Gran Canaria is, jointly with [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], the capital of the [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of the Canary Islands.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Gc01.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Topography of Gran Canaria]]\n[[File:Gran Canaria 3D version1.gif|thumb|left|Gran Canaria 3D]]\n\nGran Canaria is located in the [[Canary Islands]] archipelago southeast of [[Tenerife]] and west of [[Fuerteventura]]. The island is of [[volcano|volcanic]] origin, mostly made of [[fissure vent]]s. It has a round shape, with a diameter of approximately {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} and a surface area of {{convert|1,560|km2|abbr=on}}. Gran Canaria's maximum elevation is {{convert|1,956|m}} at [[Morro de la Agujereada]], although the nearby [[Pico de las Nieves]] has traditionally been considered the island's tallest peak.\n\n=== Geology ===\nAbout 80% of the volume of the island was formed during the [[Miocene]] period eruptions, between 14 and 9 million years ago. This is called the \"Old Cycle\" and is estimated to have lasted some 200,000 years and have emitted about {{convert|1000|km3|abbr=on}}, mostly of fissural [[alkali basalt]]. This cycle continued with the emission of [[trachyte]]s, [[phonolite]]s and [[peralkaline]] rocks. This period was followed by one of erosion, which lasted some 4 million years.<ref name=\"canarian_volcanoes\">Ara\u00f1a, V and Carracedo, J.C: ''Canarian Volcanoes'', Volume 3: Gran Canaria, pp. 8, 24. Editorial Rueda, Madrid, 1978.</ref>\n\nA second cycle of volcanic eruptions, known as the \"Roque Nublo cycle\", took place between 4.5 and 3.4 million years ago. This shorter cycle emitted about {{convert|100|km3|abbr=on}}. Most of the inland peaks were formed by erosion from these materials. This period also started with fissural basalts, but ended with violent eruptions of [[pyroclastic flows]]. Some phonolitic features, like the Risco Blanco, were also formed in its last stages.<ref name=\"canarian_volcanoes\"/>\n\nThe third or recent cycle is held to have started some 2.8 million years ago and is considered to be still active. The last eruptions are held to have occurred some 3,500 years ago.<ref name=\"canarian_volcanoes\"/>\n\nThe changes in volume and, therefore, weight of the island have also caused the island to rise above the previous sea level during erosive periods and to sink during eruptive periods. Some of these \"fossil beaches\" can be seen in the cliff faces of the more eroded northern coast.<ref name=\"canarian_volcanoes_sealevel\">Oscillations of up to {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the level corresponding to sea level have occurred in geological history. The highest point known is in the Bay of El Confital, Las Palmas ({{convert|130|m|ft|disp=comma|abbr=on}} above current sea level) while subaerial materials have been extracted from a well at {{convert|230|m|ft|abbr=on}} below sea level in the area of La Aldea.

Gran Canaria is noted for its rich variety of [[microclimate]]s. Generally speaking though, the average daytime high ranges from {{convert|20|C|F}} in winter to {{convert|26|C|F}} in summer. Some cool nights occur in winter, but lows below {{convert|10|C|F}} are unknown near the coast. Inland the climate is still mild but mountainous areas see the occasional frost or snow. Annual rainfall averages {{convert|228|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, most of this falling in the cooler months, with July, August and September normally rainless. Rainfall is unevenly distributed through the island with some areas being much drier than others.\nCloud cover and sunshine is often quite variable during the cooler months, and there can be several rather cloudy days at times in winter. Summers are generally quite sunny however, with the south of the island being most favoured.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Gran Canaria Airport (1981\u20132010)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 20.8\n|Feb high C = 21.2\n|Mar high C = 22.3\n|Apr high C = 22.6\n|May high C = 23.6\n|Jun high C = 25.3\n|Jul high C = 26.9\n|Aug high C = 27.5\n|Sep high C = 27.2\n|Oct high C = 26.2\n|Nov high C = 24.2\n|Dec high C = 22.2\n|year high C = 24.2\n|Jan mean C = 17.9\n|Feb mean C = 18.2\n|Mar mean C = 19.0\n|Apr mean C = 19.4\n|May mean C = 20.4\n|Jun mean C = 22.2\n|Jul mean C = 23.8\n|Aug mean C = 24.6\n|Sep mean C = 24.3\n|Oct mean C = 23.1\n|Nov mean C = 21.2\n|Dec mean C = 19.2\n|year mean C = 21.2\n|Jan low C = 15.0\n|Feb low C = 15.0\n|Mar low C = 15.7\n|Apr low C = 16.2\n|May low C = 17.3\n|Jun low C = 19.2\n|Jul low C = 20.8\n|Aug low C = 21.6\n|Sep low C = 21.4\n|Oct low C = 20.1\n|Nov low C = 18.1\n|Dec low C = 16.2\n|year low C = 18.2\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 25\n|Feb precipitation mm = 24\n|Mar precipitation mm = 13\n|Apr precipitation mm = 6\n|May precipitation mm = 1\n|Jun precipitation mm = 0\n|Jul precipitation mm = 0\n|Aug precipitation mm = 0\n|Sep precipitation mm = 9\n|Oct precipitation mm = 16\n|Nov precipitation mm = 22\n|Dec precipitation mm = 31\n|year precipitation mm = 151\n|Jan precipitation days = 3\n|Feb precipitation days = 3\n|Mar precipitation days = 2\n|Apr precipitation days = 1\n|May precipitation days = 0\n|Jun precipitation days = 0\n|Jul precipitation days = 0\n|Aug precipitation days = 0\n|Sep precipitation days = 1\n|Oct precipitation days = 2\n|Nov precipitation days = 4\n|Dec precipitation days = 5\n|unit precipitation days = 1&nbsp;mm\n|year precipitation days = 21\n|Jan sun = 184\n|Feb sun = 191\n|Mar sun = 229\n|Apr sun = 228\n|May sun = 272\n|Jun sun = 284\n|Jul sun = 308\n|Aug sun = 300\n|Sep sun = 241\n|Oct sun = 220\n|Nov sun = 185\n|Dec sun = 179\n|year sun = 2821\n|source 1 = [[Agencia Estatal de Meteorolog\u00eda]] ,<ref>{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=C649I&k=coo\n  |title=Standard Climate Values.

The [[Maspalomas Dunes]] are located between Playa del Ingl\u00e9s (\"The Englishman's Beach\") and the distinctive 19th century [[Maspalomas Lighthouse|Maspalomas lighthouse]]. Playa del Ingles is home to the Yumbo Centre,<ref>http://yumbocentrum.com/home/</ref> which was opened in 1982 and has almost 200 shops, including bars, restaurants, cafes, fashion boutiques, electronic outlets and jewellery stores.\n\nIn Tarajalillo, an Aeroclub exists from where tourist flights can be taken over the island.\n\nStill further to the west along the southern shore, in the Municipality of Mog\u00e1n, are the communities of [[Puerto Rico, Las Palmas|Puerto Rico]] and [[Puerto de Mog\u00e1n]], a village referred to as \"Little Venice\" on account of its many canals.\n\nOther attractions include Cocodrilos Park, [[Roque Nublo]] (an 80&nbsp;m monolith), [[Cenobio de Valer\u00f3n]] with more than 350 storage cavities, [[Painted Cave, Galdar|Painted cave of Galdar]] the most important archaeological park in Canary Islands, or the botanical gardens ''[[Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico Canario Viera y Clavijo|Jard\u00edn Canario]]'' (in Tafira Alta) and ''Cactualdea'' (in [[La Aldea de San Nicol\u00e1s]]).\n\n[[El Dedo de Dios]], or \"God's Finger\", was a rocky spire jutting from the sea in [[Puerto de las Nieves]], and was previously the signature attraction of the Canary Islands until it was destroyed by [[Tropical Storm Delta (2005)|tropical storm Delta]] that crossed the archipelago on November 2005.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4482384.stm BBC NEWS - ''Tropical Storm Delta batters Canaries''].</ref>\n\nOther well-known rock formations are El Cura (also known as El Fraile), The Frog (La Rana), [[Roque Bentayga]], the Roque de Gando, and the Pe\u00f1\u00f3n Bermejo. Traditionally, the highest peak of the island has been considered to be the [[Pico de las Nieves]], at {{convert|1949|m}}; however, [[Morro de la Agujereada]] is taller, at {{convert|1956|m}}.\n\nThe capital city is [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]]. ''Las Canteras'' beach, a protected area and diving zone, lies in the heart of the city. Las Palmas de Gran Canaria is also known for its annual ''[[Carnival|carnaval]]''. It was the first stop of Christopher Columbus' expedition on his way back from the Americas,{{sfn|Andrews & Quintero|2007|p=29}} a commemoration of which is the Hermitage of San Antonio Abad, where the navigator prayed, and the ''Casa de Col\u00f3n''. Other attractions in the capital city include the ''Museo Canario'' (the most important archaeology museum in the archipelago), the cathedral and the ''Plaza del Esp\u00edritu Santo''. In [[Teror]] the shrine of ''[[Virgen del Pino]]'' (\"Virgin of the Pine\"), patron saint of Gran Canaria, can be found. Its feast is celebrated on September 8.\n\nThe town of [[Ag\u00fcimes]], on the eastern part of the island, has been carefully restored and its town centre, centered on its old church and a peaceful square, now evokes the quiet living of a traditional Canarian town. The district also has some of the best preserved cave dwellings, in the protected area of the [[Guayadeque ravine]], where even the church has been built into the mountainside and visitors can find a number of popular cave restaurants. The district also includes the most renowned scuba diving area on the island: the marine reserve at the ''playa de El Cabr\u00f3n'' just outside the town of Arinaga.\n\nOther important towns are [[Telde]], known among other things for their [[Surfing|surf]] schools in Salinetas, Vecindario (within the municipality of Santa Luc\u00eda de Tirajana) and [[G\u00e1ldar]], that contains an important diving zone. In [[Arucas]] there is a Neogothic temple, popularly known as \"Arucas' Cathedral\", as well as a large fertile plain where bananas are grown.

The Canarii called the island '''Tamar\u00e1n''' ('land of the brave\").\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], after over a century of European incursions and attempts at conquest, the island was conquered on April 29, 1483 by the [[Crown of Castile]], under [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella I]]. The conquest succeeded after a campaign that lasted five years, and it was an important step towards the expansion of the unified Spain.\n\nThe capital city of [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] was founded on June 24, 1478, under the name \"Real de Las Palmas\", by [[Juan Rej\u00f3n]], head of the invading [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] army. In 1492, [[Christopher Columbus]] anchored in the [[Port of Las Palmas]] (and spent some time on the island) on his first trip to the Americas. Las Palmas de Gran Canaria is, jointly with [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], the capital of the [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of the Canary Islands.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Gc01.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Topography of Gran Canaria]]\n[[File:Gran Canaria 3D version1.gif|thumb|left|Gran Canaria 3D]]\n\nGran Canaria is located in the [[Canary Islands]] archipelago southeast of [[Tenerife]] and west of [[Fuerteventura]]. The island is of [[volcano|volcanic]] origin, mostly made of [[fissure vent]]s. It has a round shape, with a diameter of approximately {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} and a surface area of {{convert|1,560|km2|abbr=on}}. Gran Canaria's maximum elevation is {{convert|1,956|m}} at [[Morro de la Agujereada]], although the nearby [[Pico de las Nieves]] has traditionally been considered the island's tallest peak.\n\n=== Geology ===\nAbout 80% of the volume of the island was formed during the [[Miocene]] period eruptions, between 14 and 9 million years ago. This is called the \"Old Cycle\" and is estimated to have lasted some 200,000 years and have emitted about {{convert|1000|km3|abbr=on}}, mostly of fissural [[alkali basalt]]. This cycle continued with the emission of [[trachyte]]s, [[phonolite]]s and [[peralkaline]] rocks. This period was followed by one of erosion, which lasted some 4 million years.<ref name=\"canarian_volcanoes\">Ara\u00f1a, V and Carracedo, J.C: ''Canarian Volcanoes'', Volume 3: Gran Canaria, pp. 8, 24. Editorial Rueda, Madrid, 1978.</ref>\n\nA second cycle of volcanic eruptions, known as the \"Roque Nublo cycle\", took place between 4.5 and 3.4 million years ago. This shorter cycle emitted about {{convert|100|km3|abbr=on}}. Most of the inland peaks were formed by erosion from these materials. This period also started with fissural basalts, but ended with violent eruptions of [[pyroclastic flows]]. Some phonolitic features, like the Risco Blanco, were also formed in its last stages.<ref name=\"canarian_volcanoes\"/>\n\nThe third or recent cycle is held to have started some 2.8 million years ago and is considered to be still active. The last eruptions are held to have occurred some 3,500 years ago.<ref name=\"canarian_volcanoes\"/>\n\nThe changes in volume and, therefore, weight of the island have also caused the island to rise above the previous sea level during erosive periods and to sink during eruptive periods. Some of these \"fossil beaches\" can be seen in the cliff faces of the more eroded northern coast.<ref name=\"canarian_volcanoes_sealevel\">Oscillations of up to {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the level corresponding to sea level have occurred in geological history. The highest point known is in the Bay of El Confital, Las Palmas ({{convert|130|m|ft|disp=comma|abbr=on}} above current sea level) while subaerial materials have been extracted from a well at {{convert|230|m|ft|abbr=on}} below sea level in the area of La Aldea.

Gran Canaria is noted for its rich variety of [[microclimate]]s. Generally speaking though, the average daytime high ranges from {{convert|20|C|F}} in winter to {{convert|26|C|F}} in summer. Some cool nights occur in winter, but lows below {{convert|10|C|F}} are unknown near the coast. Inland the climate is still mild but mountainous areas see the occasional frost or snow. Annual rainfall averages {{convert|228|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, most of this falling in the cooler months, with July, August and September normally rainless. Rainfall is unevenly distributed through the island with some areas being much drier than others.\nCloud cover and sunshine is often quite variable during the cooler months, and there can be several rather cloudy days at times in winter. Summers are generally quite sunny however, with the south of the island being most favoured.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Gran Canaria Airport (1981\u20132010)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 20.8\n|Feb high C = 21.2\n|Mar high C = 22.3\n|Apr high C = 22.6\n|May high C = 23.6\n|Jun high C = 25.3\n|Jul high C = 26.9\n|Aug high C = 27.5\n|Sep high C = 27.2\n|Oct high C = 26.2\n|Nov high C = 24.2\n|Dec high C = 22.2\n|year high C = 24.2\n|Jan mean C = 17.9\n|Feb mean C = 18.2\n|Mar mean C = 19.0\n|Apr mean C = 19.4\n|May mean C = 20.4\n|Jun mean C = 22.2\n|Jul mean C = 23.8\n|Aug mean C = 24.6\n|Sep mean C = 24.3\n|Oct mean C = 23.1\n|Nov mean C = 21.2\n|Dec mean C = 19.2\n|year mean C = 21.2\n|Jan low C = 15.0\n|Feb low C = 15.0\n|Mar low C = 15.7\n|Apr low C = 16.2\n|May low C = 17.3\n|Jun low C = 19.2\n|Jul low C = 20.8\n|Aug low C = 21.6\n|Sep low C = 21.4\n|Oct low C = 20.1\n|Nov low C = 18.1\n|Dec low C = 16.2\n|year low C = 18.2\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 25\n|Feb precipitation mm = 24\n|Mar precipitation mm = 13\n|Apr precipitation mm = 6\n|May precipitation mm = 1\n|Jun precipitation mm = 0\n|Jul precipitation mm = 0\n|Aug precipitation mm = 0\n|Sep precipitation mm = 9\n|Oct precipitation mm = 16\n|Nov precipitation mm = 22\n|Dec precipitation mm = 31\n|year precipitation mm = 151\n|Jan precipitation days = 3\n|Feb precipitation days = 3\n|Mar precipitation days = 2\n|Apr precipitation days = 1\n|May precipitation days = 0\n|Jun precipitation days = 0\n|Jul precipitation days = 0\n|Aug precipitation days = 0\n|Sep precipitation days = 1\n|Oct precipitation days = 2\n|Nov precipitation days = 4\n|Dec precipitation days = 5\n|unit precipitation days = 1&nbsp;mm\n|year precipitation days = 21\n|Jan sun = 184\n|Feb sun = 191\n|Mar sun = 229\n|Apr sun = 228\n|May sun = 272\n|Jun sun = 284\n|Jul sun = 308\n|Aug sun = 300\n|Sep sun = 241\n|Oct sun = 220\n|Nov sun = 185\n|Dec sun = 179\n|year sun = 2821\n|source 1 = [[Agencia Estatal de Meteorolog\u00eda]] ,<ref>{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=C649I&k=coo\n  |title=Standard Climate Values.

The [[Maspalomas Dunes]] are located between Playa del Ingl\u00e9s (\"The Englishman's Beach\") and the distinctive 19th century [[Maspalomas Lighthouse|Maspalomas lighthouse]]. Playa del Ingles is home to the Yumbo Centre,<ref>http://yumbocentrum.com/home/</ref> which was opened in 1982 and has almost 200 shops, including bars, restaurants, cafes, fashion boutiques, electronic outlets and jewellery stores.\n\nIn Tarajalillo, an Aeroclub exists from where tourist flights can be taken over the island.\n\nStill further to the west along the southern shore, in the Municipality of Mog\u00e1n, are the communities of [[Puerto Rico, Las Palmas|Puerto Rico]] and [[Puerto de Mog\u00e1n]], a village referred to as \"Little Venice\" on account of its many canals.\n\nOther attractions include Cocodrilos Park, [[Roque Nublo]] (an 80&nbsp;m monolith), [[Cenobio de Valer\u00f3n]] with more than 350 storage cavities, [[Painted Cave, Galdar|Painted cave of Galdar]] the most important archaeological park in Canary Islands, or the botanical gardens ''[[Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico Canario Viera y Clavijo|Jard\u00edn Canario]]'' (in Tafira Alta) and ''Cactualdea'' (in [[La Aldea de San Nicol\u00e1s]]).\n\n[[El Dedo de Dios]], or \"God's Finger\", was a rocky spire jutting from the sea in [[Puerto de las Nieves]], and was previously the signature attraction of the Canary Islands until it was destroyed by [[Tropical Storm Delta (2005)|tropical storm Delta]] that crossed the archipelago on November 2005.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4482384.stm BBC NEWS - ''Tropical Storm Delta batters Canaries''].</ref>\n\nOther well-known rock formations are El Cura (also known as El Fraile), The Frog (La Rana), [[Roque Bentayga]], the Roque de Gando, and the Pe\u00f1\u00f3n Bermejo. Traditionally, the highest peak of the island has been considered to be the [[Pico de las Nieves]], at {{convert|1949|m}}; however, [[Morro de la Agujereada]] is taller, at {{convert|1956|m}}.\n\nThe capital city is [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]]. ''Las Canteras'' beach, a protected area and diving zone, lies in the heart of the city. Las Palmas de Gran Canaria is also known for its annual ''[[Carnival|carnaval]]''. It was the first stop of Christopher Columbus' expedition on his way back from the Americas,{{sfn|Andrews & Quintero|2007|p=29}} a commemoration of which is the Hermitage of San Antonio Abad, where the navigator prayed, and the ''Casa de Col\u00f3n''. Other attractions in the capital city include the ''Museo Canario'' (the most important archaeology museum in the archipelago), the cathedral and the ''Plaza del Esp\u00edritu Santo''. In [[Teror]] the shrine of ''[[Virgen del Pino]]'' (\"Virgin of the Pine\"), patron saint of Gran Canaria, can be found. Its feast is celebrated on September 8.\n\nThe town of [[Ag\u00fcimes]], on the eastern part of the island, has been carefully restored and its town centre, centered on its old church and a peaceful square, now evokes the quiet living of a traditional Canarian town. The district also has some of the best preserved cave dwellings, in the protected area of the [[Guayadeque ravine]], where even the church has been built into the mountainside and visitors can find a number of popular cave restaurants. The district also includes the most renowned scuba diving area on the island: the marine reserve at the ''playa de El Cabr\u00f3n'' just outside the town of Arinaga.\n\nOther important towns are [[Telde]], known among other things for their [[Surfing|surf]] schools in Salinetas, Vecindario (within the municipality of Santa Luc\u00eda de Tirajana) and [[G\u00e1ldar]], that contains an important diving zone. In [[Arucas]] there is a Neogothic temple, popularly known as \"Arucas' Cathedral\", as well as a large fertile plain where bananas are grown.

For that reason, cats are often depicted in paintings alongside Islamic scholars and bibliophiles. The medieval Egyptian zoologist [[Al-Damiri]] (1344\u20131405) wrote that the first cat was created when [[God in Islam|God]] caused a [[lion]] to sneeze, after animals on [[Noah's Ark]] complained of mice.<ref name=Campo>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|last=Campo|first=Juan Eduardo|pages=131|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2009|isbn=1438126964}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Hygiene and neutering ==\n[[File:Cat outside a mosque.jpg|thumb|A cat on the doorstep of a mosque in [[\u015eirince]], [[Turkey]]]]\nIn Islamic tradition, cats are admired for their cleanliness.

If a matching EphID is found, then the user has come in close contact with an infected patient, and is warned by the client. Since each device locally verifies contact logs, and thus contact logs are never transmitted to third parties, the central reporting server cannot by itself ascertain the identity or contact log of any client in the network.

These EphIDs are logged locally on a receiving client's device and is never transmitted to third parties.\n\nTo generate an EphID, first a client generates a secret key that rotates daily (<math>SK_t</math>) by computing <math>SK_t = H(SK_{t-1})</math>, where <math>H()</math> is a cryptographic hash function such as [[SHA-2|SHA-256]]. <math>SK_0</math> is calculated by a standard secret key algorithm such as [[Ed25519]]. The client will use <math>SK_t</math> during day <math>t</math> to generate a list of EphIDs. At the beginning of the day, a client generates a local list of size <math>n=(24*60)/l</math> new EphIDs to broadcast throughout the day, where <math>l</math> is the lifetime of a EphID in minutes. To prevent malicious third parties from establishing patterns of movement by tracing static identifiers over a large area, EphIDs are rotated frequently. Given the secret day key <math>SK_t</math>, each device computes <math>EphID_n(BK) = PRG(PRF(SK_t, BK))</math>, where <math>BK</math> is a global fixed string, <math>PRF()</math> is a pseudo-random function like [[HMAC-SHA256]], and <math>PRG()</math> is a stream cipher producing <math>n * 16</math> bytes.

This stream is then split into 16-byte chunks and randomly sorted to obtain the EphIDs of the day.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[BlueTrace]]\n* [[TCN Protocol]]\n* [[Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing]]\n* [[Google / Apple contact tracing project]]\n\n== References ==\n\n<references />{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://github.com/DP-3T DP-3T Github]\n\n[[Category:Application layer protocols]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2020]]\n[[Category:Software associated with the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]\n[[Category:Software using the MPL license]]\n[[Category:Digital contact tracing protocols]]\n[[Category:Software using the Apache license]]\n[[Category:2020 coronavirus pandemic in Europe]]\n", "name_user": "Mirive", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removing logo pending verification", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_Privacy-Preserving_Proximity_Tracing"}
