This was quite unfortunate for the Smart Gilas program, as many of the players were waiting for an offer and still undecided with a chance to pull out of the draft. On August 28, 2011, Lassiter was selected 4th overall in the draft by [[Powerade Tigers]]. Smart Gilas teammate [[JVee Casio]] was also chosen by the Tigers as the first overall pick.\n\n===Powerade Tigers===\nThe team finished with 6 wins and 8 losses and ranked 8th after the elimination in the [[2011\u201312 PBA Philippine Cup|2011\u201312 Philippine Cup]].

The combination of Casio, Lassiter and David also beat the [[Yeng Guiao]]-led [[Rain or Shine Elasto Painters]] in the semifinals in seven games. They entered the finals with a heavy underdog tag against the [[Chot Reyes]]-mentored [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters]]. They lost the Finals to Talk 'N Text, 4-1.\n\nHe was one of the starters for the RSJ team alongside Smart Gilas teammates [[JV Casio]], [[Dylan Ababou]] and [[Chris Lutz]] alongside B-Meg point guard [[Josh Urbiztondo]] for the [[2012 PBA All-Star Weekend|2012 All-Star Game]].\n\n===Petron / San Miguel===\nOn April 20, 2012, the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] approved the trade in which Powerade sent Marcio Lassiter and [[Celino Cruz]] to the [[San Miguel Beermen|Petron Blaze Boosters]] for [[Rey Guevarra]], [[Rabeh Al-Hussaini]], and [[Lordy Tugade]]. However, an injury prevented him to play for the entire duration of the [[2012 PBA Governors Cup]]. He played his first game as a Booster, on October 26, 2012, at the final minute of their contest against [[GlobalPort Batang Pier|GlobalPort]] through a 3-pointer. The next game, Lassiter only scored 5 points on 2-for-7 from the field. He misses his five 3-point attempts in that game in a loss to the Air21 Express. On November 14, Lassiter recorded his first double-figure scoring output with 12 points to go along with 2 rebounds in 21 minutes of playing time on a 96-86 win over the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters. \n\nIn the [[2014\u201315 PBA Philippine Cup|2014\u201315 Philippine Cup]], Lassiter helped San Miguel win its twentieth franchise title after defeating [[Alaska Aces (PBA)|Alaska]] in [[2014\u201315 PBA Philippine Cup Finals|a hard-fought seven-game series]]. The title was also Lassiter's first championship in the PBA. Lassiter had previously been in the PBA Finals twice with Powerade in the [[2011\u201312 PBA Philippine Cup|2011\u201312 Philippine Cup]] and with San Miguel, his current team in the [[2013 PBA Governors' Cup|2013 Governors' Cup]]. \n\nOn May 17, 2015, Lassiter recorded 24 points, 5 rebounds, 2 assists and 5 3-pointers in a 102-124 win over the NorthPort Batang Pier.

This was quite unfortunate for the Smart Gilas program, as many of the players were waiting for an offer and still undecided with a chance to pull out of the draft. On August 28, 2011, Lassiter was selected 4th overall in the draft by [[Powerade Tigers]]. Smart Gilas teammate [[JVee Casio]] was also chosen by the Tigers as the first overall pick.\n\n===Powerade Tigers===\nThe team finished with 6 wins and 8 losses and ranked 8th after the elimination in the [[2011\u201312 PBA Philippine Cup|2011\u201312 Philippine Cup]]. With teammate [[Gary David]] averaging almost 30 points per game during the playoffs, they had managed to beat the [[Star Hotshots|B-Meg Llamados]], the first-seeded team in two games. The combination of Casio, Lassiter and David also beat the [[Yeng Guiao]]-led [[Rain or Shine Elasto Painters]] in the semifinals in seven games. They entered the finals with a heavy underdog tag against the [[Chot Reyes]]-mentored [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters]]. They lost the Finals to Talk 'N Text, 4-1.\n\nHe was one of the starters for the RSJ team alongside Smart Gilas teammates [[JV Casio]], [[Dylan Ababou]] and [[Chris Lutz]] alongside B-Meg point guard [[Josh Urbiztondo]] for the [[2012 PBA All-Star Weekend|2012 All-Star Game]].\n\n===Petron / San Miguel===\nOn April 20, 2012, the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] approved the trade in which Powerade sent Marcio Lassiter and [[Celino Cruz]] to the [[San Miguel Beermen|Petron Blaze Boosters]] for [[Rey Guevarra]], [[Rabeh Al-Hussaini]], and [[Lordy Tugade]]. However, an injury prevented him to play for the entire duration of the [[2012 PBA Governors Cup]]. He played his first game as a Booster, on October 26, 2012, at the final minute of their contest against [[GlobalPort Batang Pier|GlobalPort]] through a 3-pointer. The next game, Lassiter only scored 5 points on 2-for-7 from the field. He misses his five 3-point attempts in that game in a loss to the Air21 Express. On November 14, Lassiter recorded his first double-figure scoring output with 12 points to go along with 2 rebounds in 21 minutes of playing time on a 96-86 win over the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters. \n\nIn the [[2014\u201315 PBA Philippine Cup|2014\u201315 Philippine Cup]], Lassiter helped San Miguel win its twentieth franchise title after defeating [[Alaska Aces (PBA)|Alaska]] in [[2014\u201315 PBA Philippine Cup Finals|a hard-fought seven-game series]].

The goal of the company was to focus on producing, acquiring and distributing commercial motion picture and television productions. Krevoy and Stabler quickly managed to position MPCA as one of the largest suppliers of high-quality, lower-budget films.\n\nDuring the company's formative years, they produced a few cult favorites, including ''[[The Purple People Eater]]'' (1988) with [[Ned Beatty]]; [[Back to Back (1996 film)|''Back to Back'']] (1989), starring [[Bill Paxton]] and [[Apollonia Kotero|Apollonia]]; and the sex comedy ''[[Miracle Beach]]'' (1992).\n\n==== Dumb and Dumber ====\nKrevoy and Stabler took MPCA to new heights when they released the 1994 blockbuster comedy ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]''. The script had been around for nearly seven years and was rejected by every major studio. The writers, [[Bobby Farrelly|Bobby]] and [[Peter Farrelly]], desperately wanted to direct the feature as well, but no one would give them a shot. Once MPCA got behind the script, they were able to package the project, complete with the Farrellys directing and then rising star, [[Jim Carrey]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Produce Your Own Damn Movie!.|last=Kaufman, Lloyd.|date=2009|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-092788-6|location=Burlington|oclc=466443796}}</ref>\n\n''Dumb and Dumber'' broke box office comedy records; it also opened and remained at number 1 on the U.S. box office for 4 straight weeks over the holiday season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl4014900737/weekend/|title=Dumb and Dumber|website=Box Office Mojo|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> The film went on to gross $127 million domestically and $120 million overseas for a worldwide total of $247 million off of a $16 million budget.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0109686/?ref_=bo_se_r_1|title=Dumb and Dumber|website=Box Office Mojo|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> The film was one of the highest grossing comedies of the 90's.

The success of ''Dumb and Dumber'' helped get the Farrellys' passion project, ''[[Kingpin (1996 film)|Kingpin]]'', off the ground. It was released in June 1996, starring [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Randy Quaid]] and [[Bill Murray]]. Despite many critics praising the film, it was a commercial disappointment, grossing only $27 million against a $25 million budget over the course of its theatrical run.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3143403009/weekend/|title=Kingpin|website=Box Office Mojo|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] championed the film and gave it 3 and a half stars out 4, praising the film's daring comedy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/kingpin-1996|title=Kingpin movie review & film summary (1996) {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Ebert|first=Roger|website=www.rogerebert.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> ''Kingpin'' became a huge release on home video, finding a dedicated and passionate cult following.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://splitsider.com/2012/04/kingpin-the-farrelly-brothers-biggest-flop-and-greatest-triumph/|title=Kingpin: The Farrelly Brothers' Biggest Flop and Greatest Triumph {{!}} Splitsider|date=2014-05-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520142417/http://splitsider.com/2012/04/kingpin-the-farrelly-brothers-biggest-flop-and-greatest-triumph/|access-date=2020-01-30|archive-date=2014-05-20}}</ref>\n\nMPCA expanded on their success and went on to produce more big-budget studio comedies, including ''[[Beverly Hills Ninja]]'' starring [[Chris Farley]] and ''[[Jungle 2 Jungle]]'' with [[Tim Allen]]. They also produced ''[[Threesome (1994 film)|Threesome]]'', starring [[Lara Flynn Boyle]] and [[Stephen Baldwin]]. The film was one of the most successful independent arthouse films of the year, grossing just under $15 million domestically.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0111418/?ref_=bo_se_r_1|title=Threesome|website=Box Office Mojo|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> ''Threesome'' was an autobiographical comedy by writer and director, [[Andrew Fleming]].

MPCA also signed a first-look deal with [[Sony Pictures]] in the late 90s, where they produced more than 10 movies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1995/film/features/par-gets-first-look-at-mpca-99129209/|title=Par gets first look at MPCA|last=Staff|first=Variety|last2=Staff|first2=Variety|date=1995-11-06|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref>\n\n== Acquisition by Orion (1996\u20131998) ==\nIn 1996, MPCA was purchased by [[John Kluge]]'s Metromedia International Group. Metromedia had just purchased the independent production company [[Orion Pictures]] from chapter 11 bankruptcy. When MPCA was merged into the company, Krevoy and Stabler took over as the Co-President's of Orion Pictures and were given a six-picture deal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-feb-21-et-mgm21-story.html|title=Coming soon, to very few theaters|date=2005-02-21|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref>\n\nAt Orion, Krevoy and Stabler oversaw the production, acquisition, and distribution of Orion's motion picture and television programming. He produced films for Academy Award-winner [[Tom Schulman]] (''[[Dead Poets Society]]'') and released films such as 1997's Academy Award and Golden Globe nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, ''[[Prisoner of the Mountains]]'' (directed by [[Sergei Bodrov]]), and the acclaimed ''[[Ulee's Gold]]'' (directed by [[Victor Nu\u00f1ez|Victor Nunez]] and presented by [[Jonathan Demme]]). ''Ulee\u2019s Gold'' was a critical hit and won its leading actor, [[Peter Fonda]], his first and only Golden Globe for best actor. Fonda also received his first and only Oscar nomination for best actor.\n\nAfter two years of revitalizing Orion Pictures, Metromedia went on to sell Orion to MGM. Krevoy was able to take the MPCA name back as part of his original deal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/film/news/mgm-ends-orion-orbit-1116676950/|title=MGM ends Orion orbit|last=Weiner|first=Rex|last2=Weiner|first2=Rex|date=1997-07-11|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref>\n\n== Restarting as an independent company (1998\u20132014) ==\nIn 1998, Krevoy returned to his independent filmmaking roots and restarted MPCA with a distribution deal through MGM.\n\nSince then, MPCA has produced a wide array of motion pictures including: boxing drama ''[[Joe and Max]]'' (which collected both ESPN and ACE award nominations); the 2002 Sundance premiere [[Bookies (film)|Bookies]] (for director [[Mark Illsley]] of [[Happy, Texas (film)|''Happy, Texas'']] fame); and ''[[Boat Trip (film)|Boat Trip]]'' starring Academy Award-winner [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]], [[Horatio Sanz]], [[Vivica A. Fox]], and [[Roger Moore]] for Artisan/[[Lionsgate]].\n\nIn 2004 MPCA produced the drama ''[[A Love Song for Bobby Long]]'', starring [[John Travolta]] and [[Scarlett Johansson]]. The film was well received by audiences and critics, with Roger Ebert awarding it 3 out of 4 stars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-love-song-for-bobby-long-2005|title=A Love Song for Bobby Long movie review (2005) {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Ebert|first=Roger|website=www.rogerebert.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> The film also earned Scarlett Johansson a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nAfter the credit crunch hit in 2008, Krevoy found new investors and ramped up production at MPCA. He built a strong international sales team and began assembling an eclectic slate of programming.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.screendaily.com/interviews/the-remaking-of-mpca/5033964.article|title=The remaking of MPCA|last=Kay2011-11-06T01:27:00+00:00|first=Jeremy|website=Screen|language=en|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref>\n\nMPCA produced the 2009 war drama ''[[Taking Chance]]'', based on the true experiences of Lt.

It was shown at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] before premiering on [[HBO]]. The film was well received by critics who praised the apolitical stance of the film, as well as the discipline of the filmmakers to veer away from emotional sentimentality. Mary McNamara of the [[Los Angeles Times]] wrote that the film \u201cdoesn't miss a single emotional pressure point \u2013 Katz clearly believes in the power and necessity of catharsis.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-taking-chance21-2009feb21-story.html|title=Review: HBO's 'Taking Chance'|date=2014-09-16|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> ''Taking Chance'' received a total of 27 award nominations and 6 wins including Kevin Bacon for Best Performance by an Actor in a Miniseries or a Motion Picture Made for Television.

1986 by longtime business partners [[Brad Krevoy]] and Steve Stabler. The goal of the company was to focus on producing, acquiring and distributing commercial motion picture and television productions. Krevoy and Stabler quickly managed to position MPCA as one of the largest suppliers of high-quality, lower-budget films.\n\nDuring the company's formative years, they produced a few cult favorites, including [[The Purple People Eater|''The Purple People Eater'']] (1988) with [[Ned Beatty]]; [[Back to Back (1996 film)|''Back to Back'']] (1989), starring [[Bill Paxton]] and [[Apollonia Kotero|Apollonia]]; and the sex comedy [[Miracle Beach|''Miracle Beach'']] (1992).\n\n==== Dumb and Dumber ====\nKrevoy and Stabler took MPCA to new heights when they released the 1994 blockbuster comedy ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]''. The script had been around for nearly seven years and was rejected by every major studio. The writers, [[Bobby Farrelly|Bobby]] and [[Peter Farrelly]], desperately wanted to direct the feature as well, but no one would give them a shot. Once MPCA got behind the script, they were able to package the project, complete with the Farrellys directing and then rising star, [[Jim Carrey]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Produce Your Own Damn Movie!.|last=Kaufman, Lloyd.|date=2009|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-092788-6|location=Burlington|oclc=466443796}}</ref>\n\n''Dumb and Dumber'' broke box office comedy records; it also opened and remained at number 1 on the U.S. box office for 4 straight weeks over the holiday season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl4014900737/weekend/|title=Dumb and Dumber|website=Box Office Mojo|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> The film went on to gross $127 million domestically and $120 million overseas for a worldwide total of $247 million off of a $16 million budget.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0109686/?ref_=bo_se_r_1|title=Dumb and Dumber|website=Box Office Mojo|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> The film was one of the highest grossing comedies of the 90's.

The success of ''Dumb and Dumber'' helped get the Farrellys' passion project, ''[[Kingpin (1996 film)|Kingpin]]'', off the ground. It was released in June 1996, starring [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Randy Quaid]] and [[Bill Murray]]. Despite many critics praising the film, it was a commercial disappointment, grossing only $27 million against a $25 million budget over the course of its theatrical run.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3143403009/weekend/|title=Kingpin|website=Box Office Mojo|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] championed the film and gave it 3 and a half stars out 4, praising the film's daring comedy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/kingpin-1996|title=Kingpin movie review & film summary (1996) {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Ebert|first=Roger|website=www.rogerebert.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> ''Kingpin'' became a huge release on home video, finding a dedicated and passionate cult following.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://splitsider.com/2012/04/kingpin-the-farrelly-brothers-biggest-flop-and-greatest-triumph/|title=Kingpin: The Farrelly Brothers' Biggest Flop and Greatest Triumph {{!}} Splitsider|date=2014-05-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520142417/http://splitsider.com/2012/04/kingpin-the-farrelly-brothers-biggest-flop-and-greatest-triumph/|access-date=2020-01-30|archive-date=2014-05-20}}</ref>\n\nMPCA expanded on their success and went on to produce more big-budget studio comedies, including ''[[Beverly Hills Ninja]]'' starring [[Chris Farley]] and ''[[Jungle 2 Jungle]]'' with [[Tim Allen]]. They also produced ''[[Threesome (1994 film)|Threesome]]'', starring [[Lara Flynn Boyle]] and [[Stephen Baldwin]]. The film was one of the most successful independent arthouse films of the year, grossing just under $15 million domestically.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0111418/?ref_=bo_se_r_1|title=Threesome|website=Box Office Mojo|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> ''Threesome'' was an autobiographical comedy by writer and director, [[Andrew Fleming]].

MPCA also signed a first-look deal with [[Sony Pictures]] in the late 90s, where they produced more than 10 movies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1995/film/features/par-gets-first-look-at-mpca-99129209/|title=Par gets first look at MPCA|last=Staff|first=Variety|last2=Staff|first2=Variety|date=1995-11-06|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref>\n\n== Acquisition by Orion (1996\u20131998) ==\nIn 1996, MPCA was purchased by [[John Kluge]]'s Metromedia International Group. Metromedia had just purchased the independent production company [[Orion Pictures]] from chapter 11 bankruptcy. When MPCA was merged into the company, Krevoy and Stabler took over as the Co-President's of Orion Pictures and were given a six-picture deal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-feb-21-et-mgm21-story.html|title=Coming soon, to very few theaters|date=2005-02-21|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref>\n\nAt Orion, Krevoy and Stabler oversaw the production, acquisition, and distribution of Orion's motion picture and television programming. He produced films for Academy Award-winner [[Tom Schulman]] ([[Dead Poets Society|''Dead Poets Society'']]) and released films such as 1997's Academy Award and Golden Globe nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, ''[[Prisoner of the Mountains]]'' (directed by [[Sergei Bodrov]]), and the acclaimed ''[[Ulee's Gold]]'' (directed by [[Victor Nu\u00f1ez|Victor Nunez]] and presented by [[Jonathan Demme]]).

In May 1917 a place became available as a [[King's Scholar]] at [[Eton College|Eton]]. At this time the family lived at Mall Chambers, Notting Hill Gate. Blair remained at Eton until December 1921, when he left midway between his 18th and 19th birthday.

For this he had to pass an entrance examination. In December 1921 he left Eton and travelled to join his retired father, mother, and younger sister Avril, who that month had moved to 40 Stradbroke Road, [[Southwold]], Suffolk, the first of their four homes in the town.<ref name=Binns>{{Cite book |last=Binns|first=Ronald |title=Orwell in Southwold |publisher=Zoilus Press |year=2018 |isbn=978-1999735920}}</ref> Blair was enrolled at a [[crammer]] there called Craighurst, and brushed up on his Classics, English, and History.

In October 1922 he sailed on board SS ''Herefordshire'' via the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Ceylon]] to join the [[Indian Imperial Police]] in Burma.

When he was posted farther east in the Delta to [[Twante]] as a sub-divisional officer, he was responsible for the security of some 200,000 people. At the end of 1924, he was posted to [[Syriam]], closer to Rangoon. Syriam had the refinery of the [[Burmah Oil Company]], \"the surrounding land a barren waste, all vegetation killed off by the fumes of [[sulphur dioxide]] pouring out day and night from the stacks of the refinery.\" But the town was near Rangoon, a cosmopolitan seaport, and Blair went into the city as often as he could, \"to browse in a bookshop; to eat well-cooked food; to get away from the boring routine of police life\".<ref>Stansky & Abrahams, ''The Unknown Orwell'', pp. 170\u201371</ref> In September 1925 he went to [[Insein Township|Insein]], the home of [[Insein Prison]], the second largest prison in Burma.

She noted his \"sense of utter fairness in minutest details\".<ref name=Shelden>Michael Shelden ''Orwell: The Authorised Biography'', William Heinemann, 1991</ref> By this time, Blair had completed his training and was receiving a monthly salary of Rs. 740, including allowances (approximately \u20a474 per month).<ref>{{cite book|page=409|title=The Combined Civil List for India: July\u2013September 1925|first= |last=|publisher=The Pioneer Press|year=1925|isbn=|subject=}}</ref>{{refn|Approximately \u20a44,012 in 2017, using the Retail Price Index <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/ukcompare/ |title=Measuring Worth |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=measuringworth.com |access-date=21 January 2019 }}</ref>|group= n}}\n\n[[File:KatharBritishClub.JPG|left|thumb|British Club in [[Katha, Myanmar|Katha]] ]]\nIn Burma, Blair acquired a reputation as an outsider. He spent much of his time alone, reading or pursuing non-''[[Pukka sahib|pukka]]'' activities, such as attending the churches of the [[Karen people|Karen]] ethnic group. A colleague, Roger Beadon, recalled (in a 1969 recording for the BBC) that Blair was fast to learn the language and that before he left Burma, \"was able to speak fluently with Burmese priests in 'very high-flown Burmese.'\"<ref>''A Kind of Compulsion, 1903\u201336'', p. 87</ref> Blair made changes to his appearance in Burma that remained for the rest of his life. This included adopting a [[pencil moustache]], a thin line above the lip (he previously had a [[toothbrush moustache]]). [[Emma Larkin]] writes in the introduction to ''Burmese Days'', \"While in Burma, he acquired a moustache similar to those worn by officers of the British regiments stationed there. [He] also acquired some tattoos; on each knuckle he had a small untidy blue circle. Many Burmese living in rural areas still sport tattoos like this\u2014they are believed to protect against bullets and snake bites.\"<ref>[[Emma Larkin]], Introduction, ''Burmese Days'', Penguin Classics edition, 2009</ref> Later, he wrote that he felt guilty about his role in the work of [[British Empire|empire]] and he \"began to look more closely at his own country and saw that England also had its oppressed.\"\n\nIn April 1926 he moved to Moulmein, where his maternal grandmother lived. At the end of that year, he was assigned to [[Katha, Myanmar|Katha]] in [[Upper Burma]], where he contracted [[dengue fever]] in 1927. Entitled to a [[leave (military)|leave]] in England that year, he was allowed to return in July due to his illness. While on leave in England and on holiday with his family in [[Cornwall]] in September 1927, he reappraised his life. Deciding against returning to Burma, he resigned from the Indian Imperial Police to become a writer, with effect from 12 March 1928 after five-and-a-half years of service.<ref>{{cite book|page=894|title=The India Office and Burma Office List: 1929|first= |last=|publisher=Harrison & Sons, Ltd.|year=1929|isbn=|subject=}}</ref> He drew on his experiences in the Burma police for the novel ''[[Burmese Days]]'' (1934) and the essays \"[[A Hanging]]\" (1931) and \"[[Shooting an Elephant]]\" (1936).\n\n===London and Paris===\n[[File:Portobello Road - George Orwell House.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Blair's 1927 lodgings in [[Portobello Road]], London]]\n\nIn England, he settled back in the family home at [[Southwold]], renewing acquaintance with local friends and attending an [[Old Etonian]] dinner.

In fact he decided to write of \"certain aspects of the present that he set out to know\" and ventured into the [[East End of London]]\u2014the first of the occasional sorties he would make to discover for himself the world of poverty and the down-and-outers who inhabit it. He had found a subject. These sorties, explorations, expeditions, tours or immersions were made intermittently over a period of five years.<ref>Stansky & Abrahams, ''The Unknown Orwell'', p. 204</ref>\n\nIn imitation of [[Jack London]], whose writing he admired (particularly ''[[The People of the Abyss]]''), Blair started to explore the poorer parts of London. On his first outing he set out to [[Limehouse Causeway]], spending his first night in a common lodging house, possibly George Levy's 'kip'. For a while he \"went native\" in his own country, dressing like a [[tramp]], adopting the name P.S. Burton and making no concessions to middle-class ''[[etiquette|mores]]'' and expectations; he recorded his experiences of the low life for use in \"[[The Spike (essay)|The Spike]]\", his first published essay in English, and in the second half of his first book, ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]'' (1933).\n[[File:Rue du Pot-de-Fer.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Rue du Pot de Fer on the [[Rive Gauche (Paris)|Left Bank]] in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th arrondissement]], where Blair lived in Paris]]\n\nIn early 1928 he moved to Paris. He lived in the rue du Pot de Fer, a working class district in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th Arrondissement]].<ref name=Taylor/> His aunt Nellie Limouzin also lived in Paris and gave him social and, when necessary, financial support. He began to write novels, including an early version of ''Burmese Days'', but nothing else survives from that period.<ref name=Taylor/> He was more successful as a journalist and published articles in ''[[Monde (review)|Monde]]'', a political/literary journal edited by [[Henri Barbusse]] (his first article as a professional writer, \"La Censure en Angleterre\", appeared in that journal on 6 October 1928); ''[[G. K.'s Weekly]]'', where his first article to appear in England, \"A Farthing Newspaper\", was printed on 29 December 1928;<ref>''A Kind of Compulsion'' (1903\u201336), p. 113</ref> and ''Le Progr\u00e8s Civique'' (founded by the left-wing coalition [[Cartel des Gauches|Le Cartel des Gauches]]). Three pieces appeared in successive weeks in ''Le Progr\u00e8s Civique'': discussing unemployment, a day in the life of a tramp, and the beggars of London, respectively. \"In one or another of its destructive forms, poverty was to become his obsessive subject\u2014at the heart of almost everything he wrote until ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]''.\"<ref>Stansky & Abrahams, ''The Unknown Orwell'', p. 216</ref>\n\nHe fell seriously ill in February 1929 and was taken to the [[H\u00f4pital Cochin]] in the [[14th arrondissement of Paris|14th arrondissement]], a free hospital where medical students were trained. His experiences there were the basis of his essay \"[[How the Poor Die]]\", published in 1946. He chose not to identify the hospital, and indeed was deliberately misleading about its location. Shortly afterwards, he had all his money stolen from his lodging house. Whether through necessity or to collect material, he undertook menial jobs such as dishwashing in a fashionable hotel on the [[rue de Rivoli]], which he later described in ''Down and Out in Paris and London''. In August 1929, he sent a copy of \"[[The Spike (essay)|The Spike]]\" to [[John Middleton Murry]]'s ''[[Adelphi (magazine)|New Adelphi]]'' magazine in London. The magazine was edited by [[Max Plowman]] and [[Sir Richard Rees, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Rees]], and Plowman accepted the work for publication.\n\n===Southwold===\n[[File:Southwold North Parade.jpg|right|thumb|[[Southwold]]&nbsp;\u2013 North Parade]]\n\nIn December 1929 after nearly two years in Paris, Blair returned to England and went directly to his parents' house in [[Southwold]], a coastal town in [[Suffolk]], which remained his base for the next five years. The family was well established in the town, and his sister Avril was running a tea-house there. He became acquainted with many local people, including Brenda Salkeld, the clergyman's daughter who worked as a gym-teacher at [[Saint Felix School|St Felix Girls' School]] in the town. Although Salkeld rejected his offer of marriage, she remained a friend and regular correspondent for many years. He also renewed friendships with older friends, such as Dennis Collings, whose girlfriend Eleanor Jacques was also to play a part in his life.<ref name=Taylor/>\n\nIn early 1930 he stayed briefly in [[Bramley, Leeds]], with his sister Marjorie and her husband Humphrey Dakin, who was as unappreciative of Blair as when they knew each other as children. Blair was writing reviews for ''Adelphi'' and acting as a private tutor to a disabled child at Southwold. He then became tutor to three young brothers, one of whom, [[Richard Stanley Peters|Richard Peters]], later became a distinguished academic.<ref>R.S. Peters (1974). ''A Boy's View of George Orwell'' Psychology and Ethical Development. Allen & Unwin</ref> \"His history in these years is marked by dualities and contrasts. There is Blair leading a respectable, outwardly eventless life at his parents' house in Southwold, writing; then in contrast, there is Blair as Burton (the name he used in his down-and-out episodes) in search of experience in the kips and spikes, in the East End, on the road, and in the hop fields of Kent.\"<ref>Stansky & Abrahams, p. 230 ''The Unknown Orwell''</ref> He went painting and bathing on the beach, and there he met Mabel and Francis Fierz, who later influenced his career. Over the next year he visited them in London, often meeting their friend Max Plowman. He also often stayed at the homes of Ruth Pitter and Richard Rees, where he could \"change\" for his sporadic tramping expeditions. One of his jobs was domestic work at a lodgings for [[half crown (British coin)|half a crown]] (two shillings and sixpence, or one-eighth of a pound) a day.<ref name=\"autogenerated1996\">Stella Judt \"I once met George Orwell\" in ''I once Met'' 1996</ref>\n\nBlair now contributed regularly to ''Adelphi'', with \"[[A Hanging]]\" appearing in August 1931. From August to September 1931 his explorations of poverty continued, and, like the protagonist of ''[[A Clergyman's Daughter]]'', he followed the [[East End]] tradition of working in the Kent [[Hops|hop]] fields. He kept a diary about his experiences there. Afterwards, he lodged in the [[Tooley Street#George Orwell|Tooley Street kip]], but could not stand it for long, and with financial help from his parents moved to Windsor Street, where he stayed until Christmas. \"Hop Picking\", by Eric Blair, appeared in the October 1931 issue of ''[[New Statesman]]'', whose editorial staff included his old friend Cyril Connolly. Mabel Fierz put him in contact with [[Leonard Moore (literary agent)|Leonard Moore]], who became his [[literary agent]].\n\nAt this time [[Jonathan Cape]] rejected ''A Scullion's Diary'', the first version of ''Down and Out''. On the advice of Richard Rees, he offered it to [[Faber and Faber]], but their editorial director, [[T. S. Eliot]], also rejected it. Blair ended the year by deliberately getting himself arrested,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1214/041214-orwell-court-record|title=Discovery of 'drunk and incapable' arrest record shows Orwell's 'honesty'|work=ucl.ac.uk|accessdate=25 February 2015|date=2014-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106070123/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1214/041214-orwell-court-record/|archive-date=6 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> so that he could experience Christmas in prison, but the authorities did not regard his \"drunk and disorderly\" behaviour as imprisonable, and he returned home to Southwold after two days in a police cell.\n\n===Teaching career===\n<!-- Courtesy note: [[P. S. Burton]] links here. as {{R to section}} -->\nIn April 1932 Blair became a teacher at The Hawthorns High School, a school for boys, in [[Hayes, Hillingdon|Hayes]], West London. This was a small school offering private schooling for children of local tradesmen and shopkeepers, and had only 14 or 16 boys aged between ten and sixteen, and one other master.<ref>Crick (1982), p. 221</ref> While at the school he became friendly with the curate of the local parish church and became involved with activities there. Mabel Fierz had pursued matters with Moore, and at the end of June 1932, Moore told Blair that [[Victor Gollancz]] was prepared to publish ''A Scullion's Diary'' for a \u00a340 advance, through his recently founded publishing house, [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]], which was an outlet for radical and socialist works.\n\nAt the end of the summer term in 1932, Blair returned to Southwold, where his parents had used a legacy to buy their own home. Blair and his sister Avril spent the holidays making the house habitable while he also worked on ''Burmese Days''.<ref>Avril Dunn ''My Brother George Orwell'' Twentieth Century 1961</ref> He was also spending time with Eleanor Jacques, but her attachment to Dennis Collings remained an obstacle to his hopes of a more serious relationship.[[File:River Orwell Shore - geograph.org.uk - 1044570.jpg|thumb|The pen name George Orwell was inspired by the [[River Orwell]] in the English county of Suffolk<ref>Voorhees (1986: 11)</ref> ]]\n\"Clink\", an essay describing his failed attempt to get sent to prison, appeared in the August 1932 number of ''Adelphi''. He returned to teaching at Hayes and prepared for the publication of his book, now known as ''Down and Out in Paris and London''. He wished to publish under a different name to avoid any embarrassment to his family over his time as a \"tramp\".<ref name=\"nybooks\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/may/26/intimate-orwell/?pagination=false |title=The Intimate Orwell |last=Leys |first=Simon |date=6 May 2011 |accessdate=6 May 2011 |magazine=[[The New York Review of Books]]}}</ref> In a letter to Moore (dated 15 November 1932), he left the choice of pseudonym to Moore and to Gollancz.

Lewis Allways.<ref>Orwell, Sonia and Angus, Ian (eds.)''Orwell: An Age Like This'', letters 31 and 33 (New York: Harcourt, Brace & World)</ref> He finally adopted the ''[[nom de plume]]'' George Orwell because \"It is a good round English name.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=George Orwell: from Animal Farm to Zog, an A\u2013Z of Orwell|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/5386673/George-Orwell-from-Animal-Farm-to-Zog-an-A-Z-of-Orwell.html|agency=The Telegraph|date=20 March 2018}}</ref> ''Down and Out in Paris and London'' was published on 9 January 1933 as Orwell continued to work on ''Burmese Days''. ''Down and Out'' was modestly successful and was next published by [[Harper (publisher)|Harper & Brothers]] in New York.\n\nIn mid-1933 Blair left Hawthorns to become a teacher at [[Frays River|Frays College]], in [[Uxbridge]], [[Middlesex]]. This was a much larger establishment with 200 pupils and a full complement of staff. He acquired a motorcycle and took trips through the surrounding countryside. On one of these expeditions he became soaked and caught a chill that developed into pneumonia. He was taken to Uxbridge Cottage Hospital, where for a time his life was believed to be in danger. When he was discharged in January 1934, he returned to Southwold to convalesce and, supported by his parents, never returned to teaching.\n\nHe was disappointed when Gollancz turned down ''Burmese Days'', mainly on the grounds of potential suits for libel, but Harper were prepared to publish it in the United States. Meanwhile, Blair started work on the novel ''[[A Clergyman's Daughter]]'', drawing upon his life as a teacher and on life in Southwold. Eleanor Jacques was now married and had gone to Singapore and Brenda Salkeld had left for Ireland, so Blair was relatively isolated in Southwold\u2014working on the [[allotment (gardening)|allotments]], walking alone and spending time with his father. Eventually in October, after sending ''A Clergyman's Daughter'' to Moore, he left for London to take a job that had been found for him by his aunt Nellie Limouzin.\n\n===Hampstead===\n[[File:orwell hampstead home.JPG|thumb|Orwell's former home at 77 Parliament Hill, [[Hampstead]], London]]\n\nThis job was as a part-time assistant in Booklovers' Corner, a second-hand bookshop in Hampstead run by Francis and Myfanwy Westrope, who were friends of Nellie Limouzin in the [[Esperanto]] movement. The Westropes were friendly and provided him with comfortable accommodation at Warwick Mansions, Pond Street. He was sharing the job with [[Jon Kimche]], who also lived with the Westropes. Blair worked at the shop in the afternoons and had his mornings free to write and his evenings free to socialise. These experiences provided background for the novel ''[[Keep the Aspidistra Flying]]'' (1936). As well as the various guests of the Westropes, he was able to enjoy the company of Richard Rees and the ''Adelphi'' writers and Mabel Fierz. The Westropes and Kimche were members of the [[Independent Labour Party]], although at this time Blair was not seriously politically active. He was writing for the ''Adelphi'' and preparing ''A Clergyman's Daughter'' and ''Burmese Days'' for publication.\n\nAt the beginning of 1935 he had to move out of Warwick Mansions, and Mabel Fierz found him a flat in Parliament Hill. ''A Clergyman's Daughter'' was published on 11 March 1935. In early 1935 Blair met his future wife [[Eileen O'Shaughnessy]], when his landlady, Rosalind Obermeyer, who was studying for a master's degree in psychology at [[University College London]], invited some of her fellow students to a party. One of these students, Elizaveta Fen, a biographer and future translator of [[Chekhov]], recalled Blair and his friend [[Richard Rees]] \"draped\" at the fireplace, looking, she thought, \"moth-eaten and prematurely aged.\"<ref>Stansky & Abrahams, ''Orwell:The Transformation'' pp.&nbsp;100\u201301</ref> Around this time, Blair had started to write reviews for ''[[The New English Weekly]]''.\n[[File:George Orwell in Hampstead - geograph.org.uk - 432863.jpg|alt=|thumb|Orwell's time as a bookseller is commemorated with this plaque in Hampstead]]\n\nIn June, ''Burmese Days'' was published and Cyril Connolly's review in the ''New Statesman'' prompted Blair (as he then became known) to re-establish contact with his old friend. In August, he moved into a flat in [[Kentish Town]], which he shared with Michael Sayers and [[Rayner Heppenstall]]. The relationship was sometimes awkward and Blair and Heppenstall even came to blows, though they remained friends and later worked together on BBC broadcasts.<ref>A Kind of Compulsion, p. 392</ref> Blair was now working on ''Keep the Aspidistra Flying'', and also tried unsuccessfully to write a serial for the ''[[News Chronicle]]''. By October 1935 his flatmates had moved out and he was struggling to pay the rent on his own. He remained until the end of January 1936, when he stopped working at Booklovers' Corner.\n\n===''The Road to Wigan Pier''===\n{{main|The Road to Wigan Pier}}\nAt this time, Victor Gollancz suggested Orwell spend a short time investigating social conditions in economically depressed [[northern England]].{{refn|The conventional view, based on Geoffrey Gorer's recollections, is of a specific commission with a \u00a3500 advance. Taylor argues that Orwell's subsequent life does not suggest he received such a large advance, Gollancz was not known to pay large sums to relatively unknown authors, and Gollancz took little proprietorial interest in progress.<ref>D. J. Taylor ''Orwell: The Life'' Chatto & Windus 2003</ref>|group= n}} Two years earlier, [[J. B. Priestley]] had written about England north of the [[River Trent|Trent]], sparking an interest in reportage. The depression had also introduced a number of working-class writers from the North of England to the reading public. It was one of these working-class authors, [[Jack Hilton (author)|Jack Hilton]], whom Orwell sought for advice. Orwell had written to Hilton seeking lodging and asking for recommendations on his route. Hilton was unable to provide him lodging, but suggested that he travel to [[Wigan]] rather than Rochdale, \"for there are the colliers and they're good stuff.\"<ref>Clarke, Ben. \"George Orwell, Jack Hilton, and the Working Class.\" ''Review of English Studies'' 67.281 (2016) 764\u201385.</ref>\n\nOn 31 January 1936, Orwell set out by public transport and on foot, reaching [[Manchester]] via [[Coventry]], Stafford, the [[Staffordshire Potteries|Potteries]] and [[Macclesfield]]. Arriving in Manchester after the banks had closed, he had to stay in a common lodging-house. The next day he picked up a list of contacts sent by Richard Rees. One of these, the trade union official Frank Meade, suggested [[Wigan]], where Orwell spent February staying in dirty lodgings over a [[tripe]] shop. At Wigan, he visited many homes to see how people lived, took detailed notes of housing conditions and wages earned, went down [[Bryn Hall Colliery|Bryn Hall coal mine]], and used the [[Museum of Wigan Life|local public library]] to consult public health records and reports on working conditions in mines.\n\nDuring this time, he was distracted by concerns about style and possible libel in ''Keep the Aspidistra Flying''. He made a quick visit to [[Liverpool]] and during March, stayed in south Yorkshire, spending time in [[Sheffield]] and [[Barnsley]]. As well as visiting mines, including [[Grimethorpe]], and observing social conditions, he attended meetings of the Communist Party and of [[Oswald Mosley]] (\"his speech the usual claptrap\u2014The blame for everything was put upon mysterious international gangs of Jews\") where he saw the tactics of the [[British Union of Fascists|Blackshirts]] (\"...one is liable to get both a hammering and a fine for asking a question which Mosley finds it difficult to answer.\").<ref>A Kind of Compulsion, p. 457</ref> He also made visits to his sister at [[Headingley]], during which he visited the [[Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum|Bront\u00eb Parsonage]] at [[Haworth]], where he was \"chiefly impressed by a pair of [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s cloth-topped boots, very small, with square toes and lacing up at the sides.\"<ref>A Kind of Compulsion, p. 450. The Road to Wigan Pier Diary</ref>\n[[File:Wigan Pier - geograph.org.uk - 4175.jpg|alt=|thumb|A former warehouse at [[Wigan Pier]] is named after Orwell]] [[File:KitsLaneNo2WallingtonHertzUK2.jpg|thumb|No 2 Kits Lane, [[Wallington, Hertfordshire]], Orwell's residence c. 1936\u20131940]]\n\nOrwell needed somewhere he could concentrate on writing his book, and once again help was provided by Aunt Nellie, who was living at [[Wallington, Hertfordshire]] in a very small 16th-century cottage called the \"Stores\". Wallington was a tiny village 35 miles north of London, and the cottage had almost no modern facilities. Orwell took over the tenancy and moved in on 2 April 1936.<ref>A Kind of Compulsion, p. 468</ref> He started work on ''The Road to Wigan Pier'' by the end of April, but also spent hours working on the garden and testing the possibility of reopening the Stores as a village shop. ''Keep the Aspidistra Flying'' was published by Gollancz on 20 April 1936. On 4 August, Orwell gave a talk at the Adelphi Summer School held at [[Langham, Essex|Langham]], entitled ''An Outsider Sees the Distressed Areas''; others who spoke at the school included [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]], [[Max Plowman]], [[Karl Polanyi]] and [[Reinhold Niebuhr]].\n\nThe result of his journeys through the north was ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'', published by Gollancz for the [[Left Book Club]] in 1937. The first half of the book documents his social investigations of [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]], including an evocative description of working life in the coal mines. The second half is a long essay on his upbringing and the development of his political conscience, which includes an argument for socialism (although he goes to lengths to balance the concerns and goals of socialism with the barriers it faced from the movement's own advocates at the time, such as \"priggish\" and \"dull\" socialist intellectuals and \"proletarian\" socialists with little grasp of the actual ideology). Gollancz feared the second half would offend readers and added a disculpatory preface to the book while Orwell was in Spain.\n\nOrwell's research for ''The Road to Wigan Pier'' led to him being placed under surveillance by the [[Special Branch]] from 1936, for 12 years, until one year before the publication of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''.<ref>\"Freedom of Information, National Archives\" http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/releases/2005/highlights_july/july19/default.htm)</ref>\n\nOrwell married [[Eileen O'Shaughnessy]] on 9 June 1936. Shortly afterwards, the political crisis began in Spain and Orwell followed developments there closely. At the end of the year, concerned by [[Francisco Franco]]'s military uprising (supported by [[Nazi Germany]], [[Italy under fascism|Fascist Italy]] and local groups such as [[Falange]]), Orwell decided to go to Spain to take part in the [[Spanish Civil War]] on [[Second Spanish Republic|the Republican side]]. Under the erroneous impression that he needed papers from some left-wing organisation to cross the frontier, on [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]]'s recommendation he applied unsuccessfully to [[Harry Pollitt]], leader of the [[British Communist Party]]. Pollitt was suspicious of Orwell's political reliability; he asked him whether he would undertake to join the [[International Brigade]] and advised him to get a safe-conduct from the Spanish Embassy in Paris.<ref>\"Notes on the Spanish Militias\" in Orwell in Spain, p. 278</ref> Not wishing to commit himself until he had seen the situation ''in situ'', Orwell instead used his Independent Labour Party contacts to get a letter of introduction to [[John McNair (UK politician)|John McNair]] in Barcelona.\n\n===Spanish Civil War===\n{{contradict section|The language refers to Communist vs POUM fighting, yet both groups are communist.

The American writer told Orwell that going to fight in the Civil War out of some sense of obligation or guilt was \"sheer stupidity\" and that the Englishman's ideas \"about combating Fascism, defending democracy, etc., etc., were all baloney.\"<ref>Haycock, ''I Am Spain'' (2013), 152</ref> A few days later in [[Barcelona]], Orwell met John McNair of the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) Office who quoted him: \"I've come to fight against Fascism\".<ref>John McNair \u2013 Interview with Ian Angus UCL 1964</ref> Orwell stepped into a complex political situation in [[Catalonia]]. The [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican government]] was supported by a number of factions with conflicting aims, including the [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification]] (POUM&nbsp;\u2013 Partido Obrero de Unificaci\u00f3n Marxista), the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) and the [[Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia]] (a wing of the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Spanish Communist Party]], which was backed by Soviet arms and aid). The ILP was linked to the POUM so Orwell joined the POUM.\n\nAfter a time at the Lenin Barracks in Barcelona he was sent to the relatively quiet [[Aragon]] Front under [[Georges Kopp]]. By January 1937 he was at [[Alcubierre]] {{convert|1500|ft|m}} above sea level, in the depth of winter. There was very little military action and Orwell was shocked by the lack of munitions, food and firewood as well as other extreme deprivations.<ref>See article by [[Iain King]] on Orwell's war experiences, [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-george-orwell.htm here.]</ref> With his Cadet Corps and police training, Orwell was quickly made a corporal. On the arrival of a British [[ILP Contingent]] about three weeks later, Orwell and the other English militiaman, Williams, were sent with them to Monte Oscuro. The newly arrived ILP contingent included Bob Smillie, [[Robert Edwards (politician)|Bob Edwards]], Stafford Cottman and Jack Branthwaite. The unit was then sent on to [[Huesca]].\n\nMeanwhile, back in England, Eileen had been handling the issues relating to the publication of ''The Road to Wigan Pier'' before setting out for Spain herself, leaving Nellie Limouzin to look after The Stores. Eileen volunteered for a post in John McNair's office and with the help of Georges Kopp paid visits to her husband, bringing him English tea, chocolate and cigars.<ref>Letter to Eileen Blair April 1937 in ''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 1&nbsp;\u2013 An Age Like This 1945\u20131950'' p. 296 (Penguin)</ref> Orwell had to spend some days in hospital with a poisoned hand<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|last1=Hicks|first1=Granville|title=George Orwell's Prelude in Spain|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/05/16/specials/orwell-homage.html|website=New York Times|date=18 May 1952}}</ref> and had most of his possessions stolen by the staff.

Instead of joining the International Brigades as he had intended, he decided to return to the Aragon Front.

Unable to speak, and with blood pouring from his mouth, Orwell was carried on a stretcher to [[Si\u00e9tamo]], loaded on an ambulance and after a bumpy journey via [[Barbastro]] arrived at the hospital at [[L\u00e9rida]].

In the first week of July 1937 Orwell arrived back at Wallington; on 13 July 1937 a deposition was presented to the Tribunal for Espionage & High Treason in [[Valencia]], charging the Orwells with \"rabid [[Trotskyism]]\", and being agents of the [[POUM]].<ref>Facing Unpleasant Facts, p. xxix, Secker & Warburg, 2000</ref> The trial of the leaders of the POUM and of Orwell (in his absence) took place in Barcelona in October and November 1938.

He found his views on the Spanish Civil War out of favour. [[Kingsley Martin]] rejected two of his works and Gollancz was equally cautious. At the same time, the communist ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Daily Worker]]'' was running an attack on ''The Road to Wigan Pier'', taking out of context Orwell writing that \"the working classes smell\"; a letter to Gollancz from Orwell threatening libel action brought a stop to this. Orwell was also able to find a more sympathetic publisher for his views in [[Fredric Warburg]] of Secker & Warburg. Orwell returned to Wallington, which he found in disarray after his absence.

He was admitted to [[Preston Hall, Aylesford|Preston Hall Sanatorium]] at [[Aylesford]], Kent, a [[British Legion]] hospital for ex-servicemen to which his brother-in-law Laurence O'Shaughnessy was attached. He was thought initially to be suffering from [[tuberculosis]] and stayed in the sanatorium until September. A stream of visitors came to see him, including Common, Heppenstall, Plowman and Cyril Connolly. Connolly brought with him [[Stephen Spender]], a cause of some embarrassment as Orwell had referred to Spender as a \"pansy friend\" some time earlier. ''Homage to Catalonia'' was published by Secker & Warburg and was a commercial flop. In the latter part of his stay at the clinic, Orwell was able to go for walks in the countryside and study nature.\n\nThe novelist [[Leo Myers|L. H. Myers]] secretly funded a trip to [[French Morocco]] for half a year for Orwell to avoid the English winter and recover his health. The Orwells set out in September 1938 via [[Gibraltar]] and [[Tangier]] to avoid [[Spanish Morocco]] and arrived at [[Marrakech]]. They rented a villa on the road to [[Casablanca]] and during that time Orwell wrote ''[[Coming Up for Air]]''. They arrived back in England on 30 March 1939 and ''Coming Up for Air'' was published in June. Orwell spent time in Wallington and Southwold working on a [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] essay and it was in June 1939 that Orwell's father, Richard Blair, died.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Connelly |first1=Mark |title=George Orwell: A Literary Companion |date=2018 |publisher=McFarland |page=17}}</ref>\n\n===Second World War and ''Animal Farm''===\n\n[[File:George Orwell, c. 1940.jpg|alt=Orwell smiling|thumb|upright|left|A photo of Orwell, c. 1940, digitally coloured]]\nAt the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Orwell's wife Eileen started working in the Censorship Department of the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] in central London, staying during the week with her family in [[Greenwich]]. Orwell also submitted his name to the Central Register for war work, but nothing transpired. \"They won't have me in the army, at any rate at present, because of my lungs\", Orwell told Geoffrey Gorer. He returned to Wallington, and in late 1939 he wrote material for his first collection of essays, ''[[Inside the Whale and Other Essays|Inside the Whale]]''. For the next year he was occupied writing reviews for plays, films and books for ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'', ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]'' and ''New Adelphi''. On 29 March 1940 his long association with ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' began<ref>''A Patriot After All, 1940\u201341'', p. xvii 1998 Secker & Warburg</ref> with a review of a sergeant's account of [[Napoleon]]'s [[French invasion of Russia|retreat from Moscow]]. At the beginning of 1940, the first edition of Connolly's ''[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]'' appeared, and this provided a new outlet for Orwell's work as well as new literary contacts. In May the Orwells took lease of a flat in London at Dorset Chambers, Chagford Street, [[Marylebone]]. It was the time of the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] and the death in France of Eileen's brother Lawrence caused her considerable grief and long-term depression. Throughout this period Orwell kept a wartime diary.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Churchwell |first1=Sarah |title=Diaries |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/books/2009/09/domestic-diaries-orwell-life |accessdate=22 October 2018 |work=New Statesman}}</ref>\n\nOrwell was declared \"unfit for any kind of military service\" by the Medical Board in June, but soon afterwards found an opportunity to become involved in war activities by joining the [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/newsroom/orwell/story/0,,1048203,00.html|title=About George Orwell |website=www.theguardian.com \u2013 Newsroom|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref> He shared [[Tom Wintringham]]'s socialist vision for the Home Guard as a revolutionary People's Militia. His lecture notes for instructing platoon members include advice on street fighting, field fortifications, and the use of [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]] of various kinds. Sergeant Orwell managed to recruit [[Fredric Warburg]] to his unit. During the [[Battle of Britain]] he used to spend weekends with Warburg and his new [[Zionist]] friend, [[T. R. Fyvel|Tosco Fyvel]], at Warburg's house at [[Twyford, Berkshire]]. At Wallington he worked on \"[[England Your England]]\" and in London wrote reviews for various periodicals. Visiting Eileen's family in Greenwich brought him face-to-face with the effects of [[the Blitz]] on East London. In mid-1940, Warburg, Fyvel and Orwell planned [[Searchlight Books]]. Eleven volumes eventually appeared, of which Orwell's ''[[The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius]]'', published on 19 February 1941, was the first.<ref>''A Patriot After All'', p. xviii</ref>\n\nEarly in 1941 he began to write for the American ''[[Partisan Review]]'' which linked Orwell with [[The New York Intellectuals]] who were also anti-Stalinist,<ref>[[Frances Stonor Saunders]], ''[[Who Paid the Piper?]]'', p. 160</ref> and contributed to the Gollancz anthology ''The Betrayal of the Left'', written in the light of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] (although Orwell referred to it as the Russo-German Pact and the Hitler-Stalin Pact<ref>''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 2&nbsp;\u2013 My Country Right or Left 1940\u20131943'' p. 40 (Penguin)</ref>). He also applied unsuccessfully for a job at the [[Air Ministry]]. Meanwhile, he was still writing reviews of books and plays and at this time met the novelist [[Anthony Powell]]. He also took part in a few radio broadcasts for the Eastern Service of the BBC. In March the Orwells moved to a seventh-floor flat at Langford Court, [[St John's Wood]], while at Wallington Orwell was \"[[Dig for Victory|digging for victory]]\" by planting potatoes.\n\n{{Quotation|One could not have a better example of the moral and emotional shallowness of our time, than the fact that we are now all more or less pro Stalin.

He supervised cultural broadcasts to India to counter propaganda from Nazi Germany designed to undermine Imperial links. This was Orwell's first experience of the rigid conformity of life in an office, and it gave him an opportunity to create cultural programmes with contributions from [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Dylan Thomas]], [[E. M. Forster]], [[Ahmad Ali|Ahmed Ali]], [[Mulk Raj Anand]], and [[William Empson]] among others.\n\nAt the end of August he had a dinner with [[H. G. Wells]] which degenerated into a row because Wells had taken offence at observations Orwell made about him in a ''Horizon'' article. In October Orwell had a bout of bronchitis and the illness recurred frequently. [[David Astor]] was looking for a provocative contributor for ''[[The Observer]]'' and invited Orwell to write for him\u2014the first article appearing in March 1942. In early 1942 Eileen changed jobs to work at the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] and in mid-1942 the Orwells moved to a larger flat, a ground floor and basement, 10a Mortimer Crescent in [[Maida Vale]]/[[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]]\u2014\"the kind of lower-middle-class ambience that Orwell thought was London at its best.\" Around the same time Orwell's mother and sister Avril, who had found work in a [[sheet-metal]] factory behind [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross Station]], moved into a flat close to George and Eileen.<ref>Crick (1982), pp. 432\u201333</ref>\n[[File:George-orwell-BBC.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Orwell spoke on many [[BBC]] and other broadcasts, but no recordings are known to survive.<ref name=\"Bowker2013\">{{cite book|author=Gordon Bowker|title=George Orwell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bdAzAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT309|year= 2013|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=978-1405528054|pages=309\u201310}}</ref><ref name=\"Recordings Capture Writers' Voices Off The Page Listen Queue\">{{cite web|title=Recordings Capture Writers' Voices Off The Page Listen Queue|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96030704|publisher=NPR|accessdate=5 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC tried to take George Orwell off air because of 'unattractive' voice\">{{Cite news|last1=Khan|first1=Urmeen|title=BBC tried to take George Orwell off air because of 'unattractive' voice|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/5445579/BBC-tried-to-take-George-Orwell-off-air-because-of-unattractive-voice.html|website=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=5 November 2016|quote=The BBC tried to take the author George Orwell off air because his voice was \"unattractive\", according to archive documents released by the corporation...no recording of Orwell's voice survives but contemporaries\u2014such as the artist Lucian Freud\u2014have described it as \"monotonous\" with \"no power\".|date=2009-06-04}}</ref>]]\nAt the BBC, Orwell introduced ''Voice'', a literary programme for his Indian broadcasts, and by now was leading an active social life with literary friends, particularly on the political left.

In March 1943 Orwell's mother died and around the same time he told Moore he was starting work on a new book, which turned out to be ''[[Animal Farm]]''.\n\nIn September 1943, Orwell resigned from the BBC post that he had occupied for two years.<ref name=\"Crick-LBC\">{{cite book|last=Crick|first=Bernard R.|title=George Orwell: A Life|url=https://archive.org/details/georgeorwelllife0000cric|url-access=registration|date=1980|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston|isbn=978-0316161121}}</ref>{{RP|352}} His resignation followed a report confirming his fears that few Indians listened to the broadcasts,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://orwell.ru/library/novels/Burmese_Days/english/e_mm_int|first=Malcolm |last=Muggeridge|title=Burmese Days ''(Introduction)''|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|year=1962}} Muggeridge recalls that he asked Orwell if such broadcasts were useful, \"'Perhaps not', he said, somewhat crestfallen. He added, more cheerfully, that anyway, no one could pick up the broadcasts except on short-wave sets which cost about the equivalent of an Indian labourer's earnings over 10 years\"</ref> but he was also keen to concentrate on writing ''Animal Farm''. Just six days before his last day of service, on 24 November 1943, his adaptation of the [[fairy tale]], [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s ''[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]'' was broadcast. It was a genre in which he was greatly interested and which appeared on ''Animal Farm''{{'}}s title-page.<ref>''Two Wasted Years'', 1943, p. xxi, Secker & Warburg, 2001</ref> At this time he also resigned from the Home Guard on medical grounds.<ref>''I Have Tried to Tell the Truth'', p. xv. Secker & Warburg, 2001</ref>\n\nIn November 1943, Orwell was appointed literary editor at ''Tribune'', where his assistant was his old friend [[Jon Kimche]]. Orwell was on staff until early 1945, writing over 80 book reviews<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=yRHBGAAACAAJ&dq=ISBN0436205521 |author1=Orwell, G. |author2=Davison, P. |title=I Have Tried to Tell the Truth |publisher=Secker & Warburg |location =London |year=1999 |isbn=978-0436203701}}</ref> and on 3 December 1943 started his regular personal column, \"[[As I Please]]\", usually addressing three or four subjects in each.<ref>''I Have Tried to Tell the Truth'', p. xxix</ref> He was still writing reviews for other magazines, including ''Partisan Review'', ''Horizon'', and the New York ''[[The Nation|Nation]]'' and becoming a respected pundit among left-wing circles but also a close friend of people on the right such as Powell, Astor and [[Malcolm Muggeridge]]. By April 1944 ''Animal Farm'' was ready for publication. Gollancz refused to publish it, considering it an attack on the Soviet regime which was a crucial ally in the war. A similar fate was met from other publishers (including [[T. S. Eliot]] at [[Faber and Faber]]) until [[Jonathan Cape]] agreed to take it.\n\nIn May the Orwells had the opportunity to adopt a child, thanks to the contacts of Eileen's sister Gwen O'Shaughnessy, then a doctor in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. In June a [[V-1 flying bomb]] struck Mortimer Crescent and the Orwells had to find somewhere else to live. Orwell had to scrabble around in the rubble for his collection of books, which he had finally managed to transfer from Wallington, carting them away in a wheelbarrow.\n\nAnother blow was Cape's reversal of his plan to publish ''Animal Farm''. The decision followed his personal visit to [[Peter Smollett]], an official at the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].

[[Secker & Warburg]] had agreed to publish ''Animal Farm'', planned for the following March, although it did not appear in print until August 1945. By February 1945 David Astor had invited Orwell to become a war correspondent for the ''Observer''. Orwell had been looking for the opportunity throughout the war, but his failed medical reports prevented him from being allowed anywhere near action. He went to Paris after the liberation of France and to Cologne once it had been occupied by the Allies.\n\nIt was while he was there that Eileen went into hospital for a [[hysterectomy]] and died under anaesthetic on 29 March 1945. She had not given Orwell much notice about this operation because of worries about the cost and because she expected to make a speedy recovery. Orwell returned home for a while and then went back to Europe. He returned finally to London to cover the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] at the beginning of July. ''[[Animal Farm|Animal Farm: A Fairy Story]]'' was published in Britain on 17 August 1945, and a year later in the US, on 26 August 1946.\n\n===Jura and ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''===\n''Animal Farm'' had particular resonance in the post-war climate and its worldwide success made Orwell a sought-after figure. For the next four years, Orwell mixed journalistic work\u2014mainly for ''Tribune'', ''The Observer'' and the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'', though he also contributed to many small-circulation political and [[literary magazine]]s\u2014with writing his best-known work, ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', which was published in 1949.\n[[File:Barnhill (Cnoc an t-Sabhail) - geograph.org.uk - 451643.jpg|thumb|[[Barnhill, Jura|Barnhill]] on the Isle of [[Jura, Scotland]]. Orwell completed ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' while living in the farmhouse.]]\n\nIn the year following Eileen's death he published around 130 articles and a selection of his ''[[Critical Essays (Orwell)|Critical Essays]]'', while remaining active in various political lobbying campaigns. He employed a housekeeper, Susan Watson, to look after his adopted son at the [[Islington]] flat, which visitors now described as \"bleak\". In September he spent a fortnight on the island of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]] in the [[Inner Hebrides]] and saw it as a place to escape from the hassle of London literary life. David Astor was instrumental in arranging a place for Orwell on Jura.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theorwellprize.co.uk/news/remembering-jura/ |title=Remembering Jura, Richard Blair |publisher=Theorwellprize.co.uk |date=5 October 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref> Astor's family owned Scottish estates in the area and a fellow Old Etonian, Robin Fletcher, had a property on the island. In late 1945 and early 1946 Orwell made several hopeless and unwelcome marriage proposals to younger women, including [[Celia Kirwan]] (who later became [[Arthur Koestler]]'s sister-in-law), Ann Popham who happened to live in the same block of flats and [[Sonia Brownell]], one of Connolly's coterie at the ''Horizon'' office. Orwell suffered a tubercular haemorrhage in February 1946 but disguised his illness. In 1945 or early 1946, while still living at Canonbury Square, Orwell wrote an article on \"British Cookery\", complete with recipes, commissioned by the [[British Council]]. Given the post-war shortages, both parties agreed not to publish it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theorwellprize.co.uk/life-and-work.aspx |title=The Orwell Prize {{!}} Life and Work \u2013 Exclusive Access to the Orwell Archive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210180526/http://www.theorwellprize.co.uk/life-and-work.aspx |archivedate=10 December 2007}}</ref> His sister Marjorie died of kidney disease in May and shortly after, on 22 May 1946, Orwell set off to live on the Isle of Jura at a house known as [[Barnhill, Jura|Barnhill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orwelltoday.com/jurabarnhillvisit.shtml|title= Barnhill}} is located at {{Coord|56|06|39|N|5|41|30|W|display=inline}} ([[British national grid reference system]] NR705970)</ref>\n\nThis was an abandoned farmhouse with outbuildings near the northern end of the island, situated at the end of a five-mile (8&nbsp;km), heavily rutted track from Ardlussa, where the owners lived. Conditions at the farmhouse were primitive but the natural history and the challenge of improving the place appealed to Orwell. His sister Avril accompanied him there and young novelist [[Paul Potts (writer)|Paul Potts]] made up the party. In July Susan Watson arrived with Orwell's son Richard. Tensions developed and Potts departed after one of his manuscripts was used to light the fire. Orwell meanwhile set to work on ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. Later Susan Watson's boyfriend [[David Holbrook]] arrived. A fan of Orwell since school days, he found the reality very different, with Orwell hostile and disagreeable probably because of Holbrook's membership of the Communist Party.<ref>David Holbrook in Stephen Wadham's ''Remembering Orwell'' Penguin Books 1984</ref> Susan Watson could no longer stand being with Avril and she and her boyfriend left.\n\nOrwell returned to London in late 1946 and picked up his literary journalism again. Now a well-known writer, he was swamped with work. Apart from a visit to Jura in the new year he stayed in London for [[Winter of 1946\u20131947 in the United Kingdom|one of the coldest British winters on record]] and with such a national shortage of fuel that he burnt his furniture and his child's toys. The heavy smog in the days before the [[Clean Air Act 1956]] did little to help his health about which he was reticent, keeping clear of medical attention. Meanwhile, he had to cope with rival claims of publishers Gollancz and Warburg for publishing rights. About this time he co-edited a collection titled ''British Pamphleteers'' with [[Reginald Reynolds]]. As a result of the success of ''Animal Farm'', Orwell was expecting a large bill from the Inland Revenue and he contacted a firm of accountants of which the senior partner was Jack Harrison. The firm advised Orwell to establish a company to own his copyright and to receive his royalties and set up a \"service agreement\" so that he could draw a salary. Such a company \"George Orwell Productions Ltd\" (GOP Ltd) was set up on 12 September 1947 although the service agreement was not then put into effect. Jack Harrison left the details at this stage to junior colleagues.<ref name=Carroll>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article466206.ece |title=Tim Carroll 'A writer wronged' |journal=The Sunday Times |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |date= 15 August 2014|accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nOrwell left London for Jura on 10 April 1947.<ref name=Taylor/> In July he ended the lease on the Wallington cottage.<ref>Crick (1982), p. 530</ref> Back on Jura he worked on ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' and made good progress.

In December a chest specialist was summoned from Glasgow who pronounced Orwell seriously ill and a week before Christmas 1947 he was in [[Hairmyres Hospital]] in East Kilbride, then a small village in the countryside, on the outskirts of Glasgow. [[Tuberculosis]] was diagnosed and the request for permission to import [[streptomycin]] to treat Orwell went as far as [[Aneurin Bevan]], then Minister of Health. [[David Astor]] helped with supply and payment and Orwell began his course of streptomycin on 19 or 20 February 1948.<ref>It Is what I Think, p. 274</ref> By the end of July 1948 Orwell was able to return to Jura and by December he had finished the manuscript of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''. In January 1949, in a very weak condition, he set off for a sanatorium at [[Cranham, Gloucestershire]], escorted by Richard Rees.\n\nThe sanatorium at Cranham consisted of a series of small wooden chalets or huts in a remote part of the [[Cotswolds]] near [[Stroud]]. Visitors were shocked by Orwell's appearance and concerned by the shortcomings and ineffectiveness of the treatment. Friends were worried about his finances, but by now he was comparatively well-off. He was writing to many of his friends, including Jacintha Buddicom, who had \"rediscovered\" him, and in March 1949, was visited by Celia Kirwan. Kirwan had just started working for a [[Foreign Office]] unit, the [[Information Research Department]], set up by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government to publish anti-communist propaganda, and Orwell gave her a list of people he considered to be unsuitable as IRD authors because of their pro-communist leanings.

According to [[Irving Howe]], Orwell was \"the best English essayist since [[William Hazlitt|Hazlitt]], perhaps since [[Samuel Johnson|Dr Johnson]].\"<ref name=\"Howe\">{{Cite journal|authorlink=Irving Howe|title=George Orwell: 'As the bones know'|first=Irving|last=Howe|journal=[[Harper's Magazine]]|date= January 1969}}(reprinted in ''[[Newsweek]]''). Howe considered Orwell \"the finest journalist of his day and the foremost architect of the English essay since [[William Hazlitt|Hazlitt]]\".</ref>\n\nModern readers are more often introduced to Orwell as a novelist, particularly through his enormously successful titles ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. The former is often thought to reflect degeneration in the Soviet Union after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the rise of [[Stalinism]]; the latter, life under [[totalitarianism|totalitarian rule]]. ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' is often compared to ''[[Brave New World]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]]; both are powerful [[dystopia]]n novels warning of a future world where the state machine exerts complete control over social life. In 1984, ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' and [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' were honoured with the [[Prometheus Award]] for their contributions to dystopian literature. In 2011 he received it again for ''Animal Farm''.\n\n''[[Coming Up for Air]]'', his last novel before World War II, is the most \"English\" of his novels; alarms of war mingle with images of idyllic [[Thames]]-side [[Edwardian]] childhood of protagonist George Bowling. The novel is pessimistic; industrialism and capitalism have killed the best of Old England, and there were great, new external threats. In homely terms, its protagonist George Bowling posits the totalitarian hypotheses of [[Franz Borkenau]], Orwell, [[Ignazio Silone]] and Koestler: \"Old Hitler's something different. So's Joe Stalin. They aren't like these chaps in the old days who crucified people and chopped their heads off and so forth, just for the fun of it&nbsp;... They're something quite new\u2014something that's never been heard of before\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Penguin complete novels of George Orwell |date=1976 |publisher=Penguin |page=523}}</ref>\n\n===Literary influences===\nIn an autobiographical piece that Orwell sent to the editors of ''Twentieth Century Authors'' in 1940, he wrote: \"The writers I care about most and never grow tired of are: [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], [[Henry Fielding|Fielding]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Charles Reade]], [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]] and, among modern writers, [[James Joyce]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[D. H. Lawrence]]. But I believe the modern writer who has influenced me most is [[W. Somerset Maugham]], whom I admire immensely for his power of telling a story straightforwardly and without frills.\" Elsewhere, Orwell strongly praised the works of [[Jack London]], especially his book ''[[The Road (London book)|The Road]]''. Orwell's investigation of poverty in ''The Road to Wigan Pier'' strongly resembles that of Jack London's ''[[The People of the Abyss]]'', in which the American journalist disguises himself as an out-of-work sailor to investigate the lives of the poor in London. In his essay \"Politics vs. Literature: An Examination of Gulliver's Travels\" (1946) Orwell wrote: \"If I had to make a list of six books which were to be preserved when all others were destroyed, I would certainly put ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' among them.\"\n\nOrwell was an admirer of [[Arthur Koestler]] and became a close friend during the three years that Koestler and his wife Mamain spent at the cottage of Bwlch Ocyn, a secluded farmhouse that belonged to [[Clough Williams-Ellis]], in the [[Vale of Ffestiniog]]. Orwell reviewed Koestler's. ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' for the ''[[New Statesman]]'' in 1941, saying:\n<blockquote>\nBrilliant as this book is as a novel, and a piece of brilliant literature, it is probably most valuable as an interpretation of the Moscow \"confessions\" by someone with an inner knowledge of totalitarian methods. What was frightening about these trials was not the fact that they happened\u2014for obviously such things are necessary in a totalitarian society\u2014but the eagerness of Western intellectuals to justify them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesartsreview.org/to-the-detriment-of-us-all-the-untouched-legacy-of-arthur-koestler-and-george-orwell/|title=The Untouched Legacy of Arthur Koestler and George Orwell|date=24 February 2016|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nOther writers admired by Orwell included: [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[George Gissing]], [[Graham Greene]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Tobias Smollett]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Joseph Conrad]], and [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]].<ref>''Letter to Gleb Struve, 17 February 1944'', Orwell: Essays, Journalism and Letters Vol 3, eds.

What one sees is the face that the writer ought to have. Well, in the case of Dickens I see a face that is not quite the face of Dickens's photographs, though it resembles it. It is the face of a man of about forty, with a small beard and a high colour. He is laughing, with a touch of anger in his laughter, but no triumph, no malignity. It is the face of a man who is always fighting against something, but who fights in the open and is not frightened, the face of a man who is generously angry\u2014in other words, of a nineteenth-century liberal, a free intelligence, a type hated with equal hatred by all the smelly little orthodoxies which are now contending for our souls.}}\n\n[[George Woodcock]] suggested that the last two sentences also describe Orwell.<ref>George Woodcock Introduction to Stephen Wadhams ''Remembering Orwell'' Penguin 1984</ref>\n\nOrwell wrote a critique of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play ''[[Arms and the Man#Critical acclaim|Arms and the Man]]''.

His 1945 essay ''In Defence of P.G. Wodehouse'' contains an amusing assessment of Wodehouse's writing and also argues that his broadcasts from Germany (during the war) did not really make him a traitor. He accused [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|The Ministry of Information]] of exaggerating Wodehouse's actions for propaganda purposes.\n\n=== Food writing ===\nIn 1946, the [[British Council]] commissioned Orwell to write an essay on British food as part of a drive to promote British relations abroad.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|agency=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47155257|title=Orwell gets apology for rejected food essay|date=7 February 2019|access-date=7 February 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref> In the essay titled ''British Cookery,'' Orwell described the British diet as \"a simple, rather heavy, perhaps slightly barbarous diet\" and where \"hot drinks are acceptable at most hours of the day\".<ref name=\":0\"/> He discusses the ritual of breakfast in the UK, \"this is not a snack but a serious meal.

In ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', Orwell described a totalitarian government that controlled thought by controlling language, making certain ideas literally unthinkable. Several words and phrases from ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' have entered popular language. \"[[Newspeak]]\" is a simplified and obfuscatory language designed to make independent thought impossible. \"[[Doublethink]]\" means holding two contradictory beliefs simultaneously. The \"[[Thought Police]]\" are those who suppress all dissenting opinion. \"[[Prolefeed]]\" is homogenised, manufactured superficial literature, film and music used to control and indoctrinate the populace through docility. \"[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]\" is a supreme dictator who watches everyone.\n\nOrwell may have been the first to use the term \"[[cold war (general term)|cold war]]\" to refer to the state of tension between powers in the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc that followed World War II in his essay, \"You and the Atom Bomb\", published in ''Tribune'' on 19 October 1945.

''George Orwell: Complete Works'' XI 336</ref> Jackson was to be the most critical of Orwell's marriage to [[Eileen O'Shaughnessy]], but their later correspondence hints at a complicity. Eileen at the time was more concerned about Orwell's closeness to Brenda Salkield. Orwell had an affair with his secretary at ''Tribune'' which caused Eileen much distress, and others have been mooted. In a letter to Ann Popham he wrote: \"I was sometimes unfaithful to Eileen, and I also treated her badly, and I think she treated me badly, too, at times, but it was a real marriage, in the sense that we had been through awful struggles together and she understood all about my work, etc.\"<ref>Crick (1982), p. 480</ref> Similarly he suggested to Celia Kirwan that they had both been unfaithful.<ref>Celia Goodman interview with Shelden June 1989 in Michael Shelden ''Orwell: The Authorised Biography''</ref> There are several testaments that it was a well-matched and happy marriage.<ref name=Dakin>Henry Dakin in Stephen Wadhams ''Remembering Orwell''</ref><ref name=Donahue>Patrica Donahue in Stephen Wadhams ''Remembering Orwell''</ref><ref>Michael Meyer ''Not Prince Hamlet: Literary and Theatrical Memoirs'' 1989</ref>\n\nIn June 1944, Orwell and Eileen adopted a three-week-old boy they named Richard Horatio.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Lost Orwell|first=Peter|last=Davison|authorlink=Peter Davison (professor)|page=244|publisher=Timewell Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1857252149}}</ref> According to Richard, Orwell was a wonderful father who gave him devoted, if rather rugged, attention and a great degree of freedom.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/george-packer/orwell-and-son|title=Orwell and Son|journal=The New Yorker|accessdate=2 September 2017|date=2009-03-25}}</ref> After Orwell's death Richard went to live with Orwell's sister and her husband.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://orwellsocietyblog.wordpress.com/2011/10/27/richard-blair-on-life-with-my-aunt-avril/|title=Richard Blair on Life With My Aunt Avril|date=27 October 2011|accessdate=2 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829203004/https://orwellsocietyblog.wordpress.com/2011/10/27/richard-blair-on-life-with-my-aunt-avril/|archive-date=29 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nBlair was very lonely after Eileen's death in 1945, and desperate for a wife, both as companion for himself and as mother for Richard.

Ungregarious, he was out of place in a crowd and his discomfort was exacerbated when he was outside his own class. Though representing himself as a spokesman for the common man, he often appeared out of place with real working people. His brother-in-law Humphrey Dakin, a \"Hail fellow, well met\" type, who took him to a local pub in Leeds, said that he was told by the landlord: \"Don't bring that bugger in here again.\"<ref>Ian Angus Interview 23\u201325 April 1965 quoted in Stansky and Abrahams ''The Unknown George Orwell''</ref> Adrian Fierz commented \"He wasn't interested in racing or greyhounds or pub crawling or [[shove ha'penny]].

His extreme politeness was recalled by a member of the family he worked for; she declared that the family referred to him as \"[[Stan Laurel|Laurel]]\" after the film comedian.<ref name=\"autogenerated1996\"/> With his gangling figure and awkwardness, Orwell's friends often saw him as a figure of fun. [[Geoffrey Gorer]] commented \"He was awfully likely to knock things off tables, trip over things. I mean, he was a gangling, physically badly co-ordinated young man. I think his feeling [was] that even the inanimate world was against him.\"<ref>Geoffrey Gorer&nbsp;\u2013 recorded for Melvyn Bragg BBC Omnibus production ''The Road to the Left'' 1970</ref> When he shared a flat with Heppenstall and Sayer, he was treated in a patronising manner by the younger men.<ref>Rayner Heppenstall ''Four Absentees'' in Audrey Coppard and Bernard Crick ''Orwell Remembered'' 1984</ref> At the BBC in the 1940s, \"everybody would pull his leg\"<ref name =Wilshin>Sunday Wilshin in Stephen Wadhams ''Remembering Orwell'' Penguin Books 1984</ref> and Spender described him as having real entertainment value \"like, as I say, watching a Charlie Chaplin movie.\"<ref>Stephen Spender in Stephen Wadhams ''Remembering Orwell'' Penguin Books 1984</ref> A friend of Eileen's reminisced about her tolerance and humour, often at Orwell's expense.<ref name=Donahue/>\n\nOne biography of Orwell accused him of having had an authoritarian streak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780805076936-1 |title=Powell's Books&nbsp;\u2013 Synopses and Reviews of D J Taylor ''Orwell: The Life'' |publisher=Powells.com |date=12 October 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref> In Burma, he struck out at a Burmese boy who, while \"fooling around\" with his friends, had \"accidentally bumped into him\" at a station, resulting in Orwell falling \"heavily\" down some stairs.<ref>Maung Htin Aung ''George Orwell and Burma'' in Miriam Goss ''The World of George Orwell'' Weidenfeld & Nicolson 1971</ref> One of his former pupils recalled [[school corporal punishment|being beaten]] so hard he could not sit down for a week.<ref>Interview with Geoffrey Stevens, Crick (1982), pp. 222\u201323</ref> When sharing a flat with Orwell, Heppenstall came home late one night in an advanced stage of loud inebriation. The upshot was that Heppenstall ended up with a bloody nose and was locked in a room. When he complained, Orwell hit him across the legs with a [[shooting stick]] and Heppenstall then had to defend himself with a chair. Years later, after Orwell's death, Heppenstall wrote a dramatic account of the incident called \"The Shooting Stick\"<ref>Heppenstall ''The Shooting Stick'' Twentieth Century April 1955</ref> and Mabel Fierz confirmed that Heppenstall came to her in a sorry state the following day.<ref>Crick (1982), pp. 274\u201375</ref>\n\nOrwell got on well with young people. The pupil he beat considered him the best of teachers and the young recruits in Barcelona tried to drink him under the table without success. His nephew recalled Uncle Eric laughing louder than anyone in the cinema at a [[Charlie Chaplin]] film.<ref name= Dakin/>\n\nIn the wake of his most famous works, he attracted many uncritical hangers-on, but many others who sought him found him aloof and even dull. With his soft voice, he was sometimes shouted down or excluded from discussions.<ref>Michael Meyer ''Not Prince Hamlet: Literary and Theatrical Memoirs'' Secker and Warburg 1989</ref> At this time, he was severely ill; it was wartime or the austerity period after it; during the war his wife suffered from depression; and after her death he was lonely and unhappy. In addition to that, he always lived frugally and seemed unable to care for himself properly. As a result of all this, people found his circumstances bleak.<ref>T. R.

His first article, \"La Censure en Angleterre\" (\"Censorship in England\"), was an attempt to account for the \"extraordinary and illogical\" moral censorship of plays and novels then practised in Britain. His own explanation was that the rise of the \"puritan middle class,\" who had stricter morals than the aristocracy, tightened the rules of censorship in the 19th century. Orwell's first published article in his home country, \"A Farthing Newspaper\", was a critique of the new French daily the ''Ami de Peuple''. This paper was sold much more cheaply than most others, and was intended for ordinary people to read. Orwell pointed out that its proprietor [[Fran\u00e7ois Coty]] also owned the right-wing dailies ''[[Le Figaro]]'' and ''[[Le Gaulois]]'', which the ''Ami de Peuple'' was supposedly competing against. Orwell suggested that cheap newspapers were no more than a vehicle for advertising and anti-leftist propaganda, and predicted the world might soon see [[free newspapers]] which would drive legitimate dailies out of business.<ref>{{Citation |first = P |last = Davison |title = A Kind of Compulsion |publisher = Secker & Warburg |place = London |year = 2000 |pages = 117\u201321}}</ref>\n\nWriting for ''Le Progr\u00e8s Civique'', Orwell described the [[British Raj|British colonial government]] in Burma and India:\n\n{{Quote |The government of all the Indian provinces under the control of the [[British Empire]] is of necessity despotic, because only the threat of force can subdue a population of several million subjects.

According to biographer [[John Newsinger]]:\n{{Quote|The other crucial dimension to Orwell's socialism was his recognition that the Soviet Union was not socialist.

He left the ILP because of its opposition to the war and adopted a political position of \"revolutionary patriotism\". In December 1940 he wrote in ''Tribune'' (the Labour left's weekly): \"We are in a strange period of history in which a revolutionary has to be a patriot and a patriot has to be a revolutionary.\" During the war, Orwell was highly critical of the popular idea that an Anglo-Soviet alliance would be the basis of a post-war world of peace and prosperity. In 1942, commenting on journalist [[E. H. Carr]]'s pro-Soviet views, Orwell stated that \"all the appeasers, e.g. Professor E.H.

In any state of society where crime can be profitable you have got to have a harsh criminal law and administer it ruthlessly.\"\n\nIn his reply (dated 15 November 1943) to an invitation from the [[Katharine Stewart-Murray, Duchess of Atholl|Duchess of Atholl]] to speak for the British League for European Freedom, he stated that he did not agree with their objectives. He admitted that what they said was \"more truthful than the lying propaganda found in most of the press\", but added that he could not \"associate himself with an essentially Conservative body\" that claimed to \"defend democracy in Europe\" but had \"nothing to say about British imperialism.\" His closing paragraph stated: \"I belong to the Left and must work inside it, much as I hate Russian totalitarianism and its poisonous influence in this country.\"<ref name=\"In Front of Your Nose\">Orwell, Sonia and Angus, Ian (eds.).

In May 1917 a place became available as a [[King's Scholar]] at [[Eton College|Eton]]. At this time the family lived at Mall Chambers, Notting Hill Gate. Blair remained at Eton until December 1921, when he left midway between his 18th and 19th birthday.

When he was posted farther east in the Delta to [[Twante]] as a sub-divisional officer, he was responsible for the security of some 200,000 people. At the end of 1924, he was posted to [[Syriam]], closer to Rangoon. Syriam had the refinery of the [[Burmah Oil Company]], \"the surrounding land a barren waste, all vegetation killed off by the fumes of [[sulphur dioxide]] pouring out day and night from the stacks of the refinery.\" But the town was near Rangoon, a cosmopolitan seaport, and Blair went into the city as often as he could, \"to browse in a bookshop; to eat well-cooked food; to get away from the boring routine of police life\".<ref>Stansky & Abrahams, ''The Unknown Orwell'', pp. 170\u201371</ref> In September 1925 he went to [[Insein Township|Insein]], the home of [[Insein Prison]], the second largest prison in Burma. In Insein, he had \"long talks on every conceivable subject\" with Elisa Maria Langford-Rae (who later married [[Kazi Lhendup Dorjee]]). She noted his \"sense of utter fairness in minutest details\".<ref name=Shelden>Michael Shelden ''Orwell: The Authorised Biography'', William Heinemann, 1991</ref> By this time, Blair had completed his training and was receiving a monthly salary of Rs. 740, including allowances (approximately \u20a474 per month).<ref>{{cite book|page=409|title=The Combined Civil List for India: July\u2013September 1925|first= |last=|publisher=The Pioneer Press|year=1925|isbn=|subject=}}</ref>{{refn|Approximately \u20a44,012 in 2017, using the Retail Price Index <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/ukcompare/ |title=Measuring Worth |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=measuringworth.com |access-date=21 January 2019 }}</ref>|group= n}}\n\n[[File:KatharBritishClub.JPG|left|thumb|British Club in [[Katha, Myanmar|Katha]] ]]\nIn Burma, Blair acquired a reputation as an outsider. He spent much of his time alone, reading or pursuing non-''[[Pukka sahib|pukka]]'' activities, such as attending the churches of the [[Karen people|Karen]] ethnic group. A colleague, Roger Beadon, recalled (in a 1969 recording for the BBC) that Blair was fast to learn the language and that before he left Burma, \"was able to speak fluently with Burmese priests in 'very high-flown Burmese.'\"<ref>''A Kind of Compulsion, 1903\u201336'', p. 87</ref> Blair made changes to his appearance in Burma that remained for the rest of his life. This included adopting a [[pencil moustache]], a thin line above the lip (he previously had a [[toothbrush moustache]]). [[Emma Larkin]] writes in the introduction to ''Burmese Days'', \"While in Burma, he acquired a moustache similar to those worn by officers of the British regiments stationed there. [He] also acquired some tattoos; on each knuckle he had a small untidy blue circle. Many Burmese living in rural areas still sport tattoos like this\u2014they are believed to protect against bullets and snake bites.\"<ref>[[Emma Larkin]], Introduction, ''Burmese Days'', Penguin Classics edition, 2009</ref> Later, he wrote that he felt guilty about his role in the work of [[British Empire|empire]] and he \"began to look more closely at his own country and saw that England also had its oppressed.\"\n\nIn April 1926 he moved to Moulmein, where his maternal grandmother lived. At the end of that year, he was assigned to [[Katha, Myanmar|Katha]] in [[Upper Burma]], where he contracted [[dengue fever]] in 1927. Entitled to a [[leave (military)|leave]] in England that year, he was allowed to return in July due to his illness. While on leave in England and on holiday with his family in [[Cornwall]] in September 1927, he reappraised his life. Deciding against returning to Burma, he resigned from the Indian Imperial Police to become a writer, with effect from 12 March 1928 after five-and-a-half years of service.<ref>{{cite book|page=894|title=The India Office and Burma Office List: 1929|first= |last=|publisher=Harrison & Sons, Ltd.|year=1929|isbn=|subject=}}</ref> He drew on his experiences in the Burma police for the novel ''[[Burmese Days]]'' (1934) and the essays \"[[A Hanging]]\" (1931) and \"[[Shooting an Elephant]]\" (1936).\n\n===London and Paris===\n[[File:Portobello Road - George Orwell House.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Blair's 1927 lodgings in [[Portobello Road]], London]]\n\nIn England, he settled back in the family home at [[Southwold]], renewing acquaintance with local friends and attending an [[Old Etonian]] dinner.

In fact he decided to write of \"certain aspects of the present that he set out to know\" and ventured into the [[East End of London]]\u2014the first of the occasional sorties he would make to discover for himself the world of poverty and the down-and-outers who inhabit it. He had found a subject. These sorties, explorations, expeditions, tours or immersions were made intermittently over a period of five years.<ref>Stansky & Abrahams, ''The Unknown Orwell'', p. 204</ref>\n\nIn imitation of [[Jack London]], whose writing he admired (particularly ''[[The People of the Abyss]]''), Blair started to explore the poorer parts of London. On his first outing he set out to [[Limehouse Causeway]], spending his first night in a common lodging house, possibly George Levy's 'kip'. For a while he \"went native\" in his own country, dressing like a [[tramp]], adopting the name P.S. Burton and making no concessions to middle-class ''[[etiquette|mores]]'' and expectations; he recorded his experiences of the low life for use in \"[[The Spike (essay)|The Spike]]\", his first published essay in English, and in the second half of his first book, ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]'' (1933).\n[[File:Rue du Pot-de-Fer.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Rue du Pot de Fer on the [[Rive Gauche (Paris)|Left Bank]] in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th arrondissement]], where Blair lived in Paris]]\n\nIn early 1928 he moved to Paris.

Three pieces appeared in successive weeks in ''Le Progr\u00e8s Civique'': discussing unemployment, a day in the life of a tramp, and the beggars of London, respectively. \"In one or another of its destructive forms, poverty was to become his obsessive subject\u2014at the heart of almost everything he wrote until ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]''.\"<ref>Stansky & Abrahams, ''The Unknown Orwell'', p. 216</ref>\n\nHe fell seriously ill in February 1929 and was taken to the [[H\u00f4pital Cochin]] in the [[14th arrondissement of Paris|14th arrondissement]], a free hospital where medical students were trained. His experiences there were the basis of his essay \"[[How the Poor Die]]\", published in 1946. He chose not to identify the hospital, and indeed was deliberately misleading about its location. Shortly afterwards, he had all his money stolen from his lodging house. Whether through necessity or to collect material, he undertook menial jobs such as dishwashing in a fashionable hotel on the [[rue de Rivoli]], which he later described in ''Down and Out in Paris and London''. In August 1929, he sent a copy of \"[[The Spike (essay)|The Spike]]\" to [[John Middleton Murry]]'s ''[[Adelphi (magazine)|New Adelphi]]'' magazine in London. The magazine was edited by [[Max Plowman]] and [[Sir Richard Rees, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Rees]], and Plowman accepted the work for publication.\n\n===Southwold===\n[[File:Southwold North Parade.jpg|right|thumb|[[Southwold]]&nbsp;\u2013 North Parade]]\n\nIn December 1929 after nearly two years in Paris, Blair returned to England and went directly to his parents' house in [[Southwold]], a coastal town in [[Suffolk]], which remained his base for the next five years. The family was well established in the town, and his sister Avril was running a tea-house there. He became acquainted with many local people, including Brenda Salkeld, the clergyman's daughter who worked as a gym-teacher at [[Saint Felix School|St Felix Girls' School]] in the town. Although Salkeld rejected his offer of marriage, she remained a friend and regular correspondent for many years. He also renewed friendships with older friends, such as Dennis Collings, whose girlfriend Eleanor Jacques was also to play a part in his life.<ref name=Taylor/>\n\nIn early 1930 he stayed briefly in [[Bramley, Leeds]], with his sister Marjorie and her husband Humphrey Dakin, who was as unappreciative of Blair as when they knew each other as children. Blair was writing reviews for ''Adelphi'' and acting as a private tutor to a disabled child at Southwold. He then became tutor to three young brothers, one of whom, [[Richard Stanley Peters|Richard Peters]], later became a distinguished academic.<ref>R.S. Peters (1974). ''A Boy's View of George Orwell'' Psychology and Ethical Development. Allen & Unwin</ref> \"His history in these years is marked by dualities and contrasts. There is Blair leading a respectable, outwardly eventless life at his parents' house in Southwold, writing; then in contrast, there is Blair as Burton (the name he used in his down-and-out episodes) in search of experience in the kips and spikes, in the East End, on the road, and in the hop fields of Kent.\"<ref>Stansky & Abrahams, p. 230 ''The Unknown Orwell''</ref> He went painting and bathing on the beach, and there he met Mabel and Francis Fierz, who later influenced his career. Over the next year he visited them in London, often meeting their friend Max Plowman. He also often stayed at the homes of Ruth Pitter and Richard Rees, where he could \"change\" for his sporadic tramping expeditions. One of his jobs was domestic work at a lodgings for [[half crown (British coin)|half a crown]] (two shillings and sixpence, or one-eighth of a pound) a day.<ref name=\"autogenerated1996\">Stella Judt \"I once met George Orwell\" in ''I once Met'' 1996</ref>\n\nBlair now contributed regularly to ''Adelphi'', with \"[[A Hanging]]\" appearing in August 1931. From August to September 1931 his explorations of poverty continued, and, like the protagonist of ''[[A Clergyman's Daughter]]'', he followed the [[East End]] tradition of working in the Kent [[Hops|hop]] fields. He kept a diary about his experiences there. Afterwards, he lodged in the [[Tooley Street#George Orwell|Tooley Street kip]], but could not stand it for long, and with financial help from his parents moved to Windsor Street, where he stayed until Christmas. \"Hop Picking\", by Eric Blair, appeared in the October 1931 issue of ''[[New Statesman]]'', whose editorial staff included his old friend Cyril Connolly. Mabel Fierz put him in contact with [[Leonard Moore (literary agent)|Leonard Moore]], who became his [[literary agent]].\n\nAt this time [[Jonathan Cape]] rejected ''A Scullion's Diary'', the first version of ''Down and Out''. On the advice of Richard Rees, he offered it to [[Faber and Faber]], but their editorial director, [[T. S. Eliot]], also rejected it. Blair ended the year by deliberately getting himself arrested,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1214/041214-orwell-court-record|title=Discovery of 'drunk and incapable' arrest record shows Orwell's 'honesty'|work=ucl.ac.uk|accessdate=25 February 2015|date=2014-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106070123/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1214/041214-orwell-court-record/|archive-date=6 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> so that he could experience Christmas in prison, but the authorities did not regard his \"drunk and disorderly\" behaviour as imprisonable, and he returned home to Southwold after two days in a police cell.\n\n===Teaching career===\n<!-- Courtesy note: [[P. S. Burton]] links here. as {{R to section}} -->\nIn April 1932 Blair became a teacher at The Hawthorns High School, a school for boys, in [[Hayes, Hillingdon|Hayes]], West London. This was a small school offering private schooling for children of local tradesmen and shopkeepers, and had only 14 or 16 boys aged between ten and sixteen, and one other master.<ref>Crick (1982), p. 221</ref> While at the school he became friendly with the curate of the local parish church and became involved with activities there. Mabel Fierz had pursued matters with Moore, and at the end of June 1932, Moore told Blair that [[Victor Gollancz]] was prepared to publish ''A Scullion's Diary'' for a \u00a340 advance, through his recently founded publishing house, [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]], which was an outlet for radical and socialist works.\n\nAt the end of the summer term in 1932, Blair returned to Southwold, where his parents had used a legacy to buy their own home. Blair and his sister Avril spent the holidays making the house habitable while he also worked on ''Burmese Days''.<ref>Avril Dunn ''My Brother George Orwell'' Twentieth Century 1961</ref> He was also spending time with Eleanor Jacques, but her attachment to Dennis Collings remained an obstacle to his hopes of a more serious relationship.[[File:River Orwell Shore - geograph.org.uk - 1044570.jpg|thumb|The pen name George Orwell was inspired by the [[River Orwell]] in the English county of Suffolk<ref>Voorhees (1986: 11)</ref> ]]\n\"Clink\", an essay describing his failed attempt to get sent to prison, appeared in the August 1932 number of ''Adelphi''. He returned to teaching at Hayes and prepared for the publication of his book, now known as ''Down and Out in Paris and London''. He wished to publish under a different name to avoid any embarrassment to his family over his time as a \"tramp\".<ref name=\"nybooks\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/may/26/intimate-orwell/?pagination=false |title=The Intimate Orwell |last=Leys |first=Simon |date=6 May 2011 |accessdate=6 May 2011 |magazine=[[The New York Review of Books]]}}</ref> In a letter to Moore (dated 15 November 1932), he left the choice of pseudonym to Moore and to Gollancz. Four days later, he wrote to Moore, suggesting the pseudonyms P. S. Burton (a name he used when tramping), Kenneth Miles, George Orwell, and H. Lewis Allways.<ref>Orwell, Sonia and Angus, Ian (eds.)''Orwell: An Age Like This'', letters 31 and 33 (New York: Harcourt, Brace & World)</ref> He finally adopted the ''[[nom de plume]]'' George Orwell because \"It is a good round English name.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=George Orwell: from Animal Farm to Zog, an A\u2013Z of Orwell|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/5386673/George-Orwell-from-Animal-Farm-to-Zog-an-A-Z-of-Orwell.html|agency=The Telegraph|date=20 March 2018}}</ref> ''Down and Out in Paris and London'' was published on 9 January 1933 as Orwell continued to work on ''Burmese Days''. ''Down and Out'' was modestly successful and was next published by [[Harper (publisher)|Harper & Brothers]] in New York.\n\nIn mid-1933 Blair left Hawthorns to become a teacher at [[Frays River|Frays College]], in [[Uxbridge]], [[Middlesex]]. This was a much larger establishment with 200 pupils and a full complement of staff. He acquired a motorcycle and took trips through the surrounding countryside. On one of these expeditions he became soaked and caught a chill that developed into pneumonia. He was taken to Uxbridge Cottage Hospital, where for a time his life was believed to be in danger. When he was discharged in January 1934, he returned to Southwold to convalesce and, supported by his parents, never returned to teaching.\n\nHe was disappointed when Gollancz turned down ''Burmese Days'', mainly on the grounds of potential suits for libel, but Harper were prepared to publish it in the United States. Meanwhile, Blair started work on the novel ''[[A Clergyman's Daughter]]'', drawing upon his life as a teacher and on life in Southwold. Eleanor Jacques was now married and had gone to Singapore and Brenda Salkeld had left for Ireland, so Blair was relatively isolated in Southwold\u2014working on the [[allotment (gardening)|allotments]], walking alone and spending time with his father. Eventually in October, after sending ''A Clergyman's Daughter'' to Moore, he left for London to take a job that had been found for him by his aunt Nellie Limouzin.\n\n===Hampstead===\n[[File:orwell hampstead home.JPG|thumb|Orwell's former home at 77 Parliament Hill, [[Hampstead]], London]]\n\nThis job was as a part-time assistant in Booklovers' Corner, a second-hand bookshop in Hampstead run by Francis and Myfanwy Westrope, who were friends of Nellie Limouzin in the [[Esperanto]] movement. The Westropes were friendly and provided him with comfortable accommodation at Warwick Mansions, Pond Street. He was sharing the job with [[Jon Kimche]], who also lived with the Westropes. Blair worked at the shop in the afternoons and had his mornings free to write and his evenings free to socialise. These experiences provided background for the novel ''[[Keep the Aspidistra Flying]]'' (1936). As well as the various guests of the Westropes, he was able to enjoy the company of Richard Rees and the ''Adelphi'' writers and Mabel Fierz. The Westropes and Kimche were members of the [[Independent Labour Party]], although at this time Blair was not seriously politically active. He was writing for the ''Adelphi'' and preparing ''A Clergyman's Daughter'' and ''Burmese Days'' for publication.\n\nAt the beginning of 1935 he had to move out of Warwick Mansions, and Mabel Fierz found him a flat in Parliament Hill. ''A Clergyman's Daughter'' was published on 11 March 1935. In early 1935 Blair met his future wife [[Eileen O'Shaughnessy]], when his landlady, Rosalind Obermeyer, who was studying for a master's degree in psychology at [[University College London]], invited some of her fellow students to a party. One of these students, Elizaveta Fen, a biographer and future translator of [[Chekhov]], recalled Blair and his friend [[Richard Rees]] \"draped\" at the fireplace, looking, she thought, \"moth-eaten and prematurely aged.\"<ref>Stansky & Abrahams, ''Orwell:The Transformation'' pp.&nbsp;100\u201301</ref> Around this time, Blair had started to write reviews for ''[[The New English Weekly]]''.\n[[File:George Orwell in Hampstead - geograph.org.uk - 432863.jpg|alt=|thumb|Orwell's time as a bookseller is commemorated with this plaque in Hampstead]]\n\nIn June, ''Burmese Days'' was published and Cyril Connolly's review in the ''New Statesman'' prompted Blair (as he then became known) to re-establish contact with his old friend. In August, he moved into a flat in [[Kentish Town]], which he shared with Michael Sayers and [[Rayner Heppenstall]]. The relationship was sometimes awkward and Blair and Heppenstall even came to blows, though they remained friends and later worked together on BBC broadcasts.<ref>A Kind of Compulsion, p. 392</ref> Blair was now working on ''Keep the Aspidistra Flying'', and also tried unsuccessfully to write a serial for the ''[[News Chronicle]]''. By October 1935 his flatmates had moved out and he was struggling to pay the rent on his own. He remained until the end of January 1936, when he stopped working at Booklovers' Corner.\n\n===''The Road to Wigan Pier''===\n{{main|The Road to Wigan Pier}}\nAt this time, Victor Gollancz suggested Orwell spend a short time investigating social conditions in economically depressed [[northern England]].{{refn|The conventional view, based on Geoffrey Gorer's recollections, is of a specific commission with a \u00a3500 advance. Taylor argues that Orwell's subsequent life does not suggest he received such a large advance, Gollancz was not known to pay large sums to relatively unknown authors, and Gollancz took little proprietorial interest in progress.<ref>D. J. Taylor ''Orwell: The Life'' Chatto & Windus 2003</ref>|group= n}} Two years earlier, [[J. B. Priestley]] had written about England north of the [[River Trent|Trent]], sparking an interest in reportage. The depression had also introduced a number of working-class writers from the North of England to the reading public. It was one of these working-class authors, [[Jack Hilton (author)|Jack Hilton]], whom Orwell sought for advice. Orwell had written to Hilton seeking lodging and asking for recommendations on his route. Hilton was unable to provide him lodging, but suggested that he travel to [[Wigan]] rather than Rochdale, \"for there are the colliers and they're good stuff.\"<ref>Clarke, Ben. \"George Orwell, Jack Hilton, and the Working Class.\" ''Review of English Studies'' 67.281 (2016) 764\u201385.</ref>\n\nOn 31 January 1936, Orwell set out by public transport and on foot, reaching [[Manchester]] via [[Coventry]], Stafford, the [[Staffordshire Potteries|Potteries]] and [[Macclesfield]]. Arriving in Manchester after the banks had closed, he had to stay in a common lodging-house. The next day he picked up a list of contacts sent by Richard Rees. One of these, the trade union official Frank Meade, suggested [[Wigan]], where Orwell spent February staying in dirty lodgings over a [[tripe]] shop. At Wigan, he visited many homes to see how people lived, took detailed notes of housing conditions and wages earned, went down [[Bryn Hall Colliery|Bryn Hall coal mine]], and used the [[Museum of Wigan Life|local public library]] to consult public health records and reports on working conditions in mines.\n\nDuring this time, he was distracted by concerns about style and possible libel in ''Keep the Aspidistra Flying''. He made a quick visit to [[Liverpool]] and during March, stayed in south Yorkshire, spending time in [[Sheffield]] and [[Barnsley]]. As well as visiting mines, including [[Grimethorpe]], and observing social conditions, he attended meetings of the Communist Party and of [[Oswald Mosley]] (\"his speech the usual claptrap\u2014The blame for everything was put upon mysterious international gangs of Jews\") where he saw the tactics of the [[British Union of Fascists|Blackshirts]] (\"...one is liable to get both a hammering and a fine for asking a question which Mosley finds it difficult to answer.\").<ref>A Kind of Compulsion, p. 457</ref> He also made visits to his sister at [[Headingley]], during which he visited the [[Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum|Bront\u00eb Parsonage]] at [[Haworth]], where he was \"chiefly impressed by a pair of [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s cloth-topped boots, very small, with square toes and lacing up at the sides.\"<ref>A Kind of Compulsion, p. 450. The Road to Wigan Pier Diary</ref>\n[[File:Wigan Pier - geograph.org.uk - 4175.jpg|alt=|thumb|A former warehouse at [[Wigan Pier]] is named after Orwell]] [[File:KitsLaneNo2WallingtonHertzUK2.jpg|thumb|No 2 Kits Lane, [[Wallington, Hertfordshire]], Orwell's residence c. 1936\u20131940]]\n\nOrwell needed somewhere he could concentrate on writing his book, and once again help was provided by Aunt Nellie, who was living at [[Wallington, Hertfordshire]] in a very small 16th-century cottage called the \"Stores\". Wallington was a tiny village 35 miles north of London, and the cottage had almost no modern facilities. Orwell took over the tenancy and moved in on 2 April 1936.<ref>A Kind of Compulsion, p. 468</ref> He started work on ''The Road to Wigan Pier'' by the end of April, but also spent hours working on the garden and testing the possibility of reopening the Stores as a village shop. ''Keep the Aspidistra Flying'' was published by Gollancz on 20 April 1936. On 4 August, Orwell gave a talk at the Adelphi Summer School held at [[Langham, Essex|Langham]], entitled ''An Outsider Sees the Distressed Areas''; others who spoke at the school included [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]], [[Max Plowman]], [[Karl Polanyi]] and [[Reinhold Niebuhr]].\n\nThe result of his journeys through the north was ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'', published by Gollancz for the [[Left Book Club]] in 1937. The first half of the book documents his social investigations of [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]], including an evocative description of working life in the coal mines. The second half is a long essay on his upbringing and the development of his political conscience, which includes an argument for socialism (although he goes to lengths to balance the concerns and goals of socialism with the barriers it faced from the movement's own advocates at the time, such as \"priggish\" and \"dull\" socialist intellectuals and \"proletarian\" socialists with little grasp of the actual ideology). Gollancz feared the second half would offend readers and added a disculpatory preface to the book while Orwell was in Spain.\n\nOrwell's research for ''The Road to Wigan Pier'' led to him being placed under surveillance by the [[Special Branch]] from 1936, for 12 years, until one year before the publication of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''.<ref>\"Freedom of Information, National Archives\" http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/releases/2005/highlights_july/july19/default.htm)</ref>\n\nOrwell married [[Eileen O'Shaughnessy]] on 9 June 1936. Shortly afterwards, the political crisis began in Spain and Orwell followed developments there closely. At the end of the year, concerned by [[Francisco Franco]]'s military uprising (supported by [[Nazi Germany]], [[Italy under fascism|Fascist Italy]] and local groups such as [[Falange]]), Orwell decided to go to Spain to take part in the [[Spanish Civil War]] on [[Second Spanish Republic|the Republican side]]. Under the erroneous impression that he needed papers from some left-wing organisation to cross the frontier, on [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]]'s recommendation he applied unsuccessfully to [[Harry Pollitt]], leader of the [[British Communist Party]]. Pollitt was suspicious of Orwell's political reliability; he asked him whether he would undertake to join the [[International Brigade]] and advised him to get a safe-conduct from the Spanish Embassy in Paris.<ref>\"Notes on the Spanish Militias\" in Orwell in Spain, p. 278</ref> Not wishing to commit himself until he had seen the situation ''in situ'', Orwell instead used his Independent Labour Party contacts to get a letter of introduction to [[John McNair (UK politician)|John McNair]] in Barcelona.\n\n===Spanish Civil War===\n{{contradict section|The language refers to Communist vs POUM fighting, yet both groups are communist.

The American writer told Orwell that going to fight in the Civil War out of some sense of obligation or guilt was \"sheer stupidity\" and that the Englishman's ideas \"about combating Fascism, defending democracy, etc., etc., were all baloney.\"<ref>Haycock, ''I Am Spain'' (2013), 152</ref> A few days later in [[Barcelona]], Orwell met John McNair of the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) Office who quoted him: \"I've come to fight against Fascism\".<ref>John McNair \u2013 Interview with Ian Angus UCL 1964</ref> Orwell stepped into a complex political situation in [[Catalonia]]. The [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican government]] was supported by a number of factions with conflicting aims, including the [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification]] (POUM&nbsp;\u2013 Partido Obrero de Unificaci\u00f3n Marxista), the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) and the [[Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia]] (a wing of the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Spanish Communist Party]], which was backed by Soviet arms and aid). The ILP was linked to the POUM so Orwell joined the POUM.\n\nAfter a time at the Lenin Barracks in Barcelona he was sent to the relatively quiet [[Aragon]] Front under [[Georges Kopp]]. By January 1937 he was at [[Alcubierre]] {{convert|1500|ft|m}} above sea level, in the depth of winter. There was very little military action and Orwell was shocked by the lack of munitions, food and firewood as well as other extreme deprivations.<ref>See article by [[Iain King]] on Orwell's war experiences, [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-george-orwell.htm here.]</ref> With his Cadet Corps and police training, Orwell was quickly made a corporal. On the arrival of a British [[ILP Contingent]] about three weeks later, Orwell and the other English militiaman, Williams, were sent with them to Monte Oscuro. The newly arrived ILP contingent included Bob Smillie, [[Robert Edwards (politician)|Bob Edwards]], Stafford Cottman and Jack Branthwaite. The unit was then sent on to [[Huesca]].\n\nMeanwhile, back in England, Eileen had been handling the issues relating to the publication of ''The Road to Wigan Pier'' before setting out for Spain herself, leaving Nellie Limouzin to look after The Stores. Eileen volunteered for a post in John McNair's office and with the help of Georges Kopp paid visits to her husband, bringing him English tea, chocolate and cigars.<ref>Letter to Eileen Blair April 1937 in ''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 1&nbsp;\u2013 An Age Like This 1945\u20131950'' p. 296 (Penguin)</ref> Orwell had to spend some days in hospital with a poisoned hand<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|last1=Hicks|first1=Granville|title=George Orwell's Prelude in Spain|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/05/16/specials/orwell-homage.html|website=New York Times|date=18 May 1952}}</ref> and had most of his possessions stolen by the staff.

He spent much of the time on a roof, with a stack of novels, but encountered [[Jon Kimche]] from his Hampstead days during the stay.

Penguin, 1980</ref> in which the POUM was accused of collaborating with the fascists, had a dramatic effect on Orwell. Instead of joining the International Brigades as he had intended, he decided to return to the Aragon Front. Once the May fighting was over, he was approached by a Communist friend who asked if he still intended transferring to the International Brigades.

Unable to speak, and with blood pouring from his mouth, Orwell was carried on a stretcher to [[Si\u00e9tamo]], loaded on an ambulance and after a bumpy journey via [[Barbastro]] arrived at the hospital at [[L\u00e9rida]]. He recovered sufficiently to get up and on 27 May 1937 was sent on to [[Tarragona]] and two days later to a POUM sanatorium in the suburbs of Barcelona. The bullet had missed his main artery by the barest margin and his voice was barely audible. It had been such a clean shot that the wound immediately went through the process of [[cauterisation]]. He received [[electrotherapy]] treatment and was declared medically unfit for service.<ref>Taylor (2003: 228\u201329))</ref>\n\nBy the middle of June the political situation in Barcelona had deteriorated and the POUM\u2014painted by the pro-Soviet Communists as a [[Trotskyist]] organisation\u2014was outlawed and under attack.

In the first week of July 1937 Orwell arrived back at Wallington; on 13 July 1937 a deposition was presented to the Tribunal for Espionage & High Treason in [[Valencia]], charging the Orwells with \"rabid [[Trotskyism]]\", and being agents of the [[POUM]].<ref>Facing Unpleasant Facts, p. xxix, Secker & Warburg, 2000</ref> The trial of the leaders of the POUM and of Orwell (in his absence) took place in Barcelona in October and November 1938.

He found his views on the Spanish Civil War out of favour. [[Kingsley Martin]] rejected two of his works and Gollancz was equally cautious. At the same time, the communist ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Daily Worker]]'' was running an attack on ''The Road to Wigan Pier'', taking out of context Orwell writing that \"the working classes smell\"; a letter to Gollancz from Orwell threatening libel action brought a stop to this. Orwell was also able to find a more sympathetic publisher for his views in [[Fredric Warburg]] of Secker & Warburg. Orwell returned to Wallington, which he found in disarray after his absence.

He was admitted to [[Preston Hall, Aylesford|Preston Hall Sanatorium]] at [[Aylesford]], Kent, a [[British Legion]] hospital for ex-servicemen to which his brother-in-law Laurence O'Shaughnessy was attached. He was thought initially to be suffering from [[tuberculosis]] and stayed in the sanatorium until September. A stream of visitors came to see him, including Common, Heppenstall, Plowman and Cyril Connolly. Connolly brought with him [[Stephen Spender]], a cause of some embarrassment as Orwell had referred to Spender as a \"pansy friend\" some time earlier. ''Homage to Catalonia'' was published by Secker & Warburg and was a commercial flop. In the latter part of his stay at the clinic, Orwell was able to go for walks in the countryside and study nature.\n\nThe novelist [[Leo Myers|L. H. Myers]] secretly funded a trip to [[French Morocco]] for half a year for Orwell to avoid the English winter and recover his health. The Orwells set out in September 1938 via [[Gibraltar]] and [[Tangier]] to avoid [[Spanish Morocco]] and arrived at [[Marrakech]]. They rented a villa on the road to [[Casablanca]] and during that time Orwell wrote ''[[Coming Up for Air]]''. They arrived back in England on 30 March 1939 and ''Coming Up for Air'' was published in June. Orwell spent time in Wallington and Southwold working on a [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] essay and it was in June 1939 that Orwell's father, Richard Blair, died.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Connelly |first1=Mark |title=George Orwell: A Literary Companion |date=2018 |publisher=McFarland |page=17}}</ref>\n\n===Second World War and ''Animal Farm''===\n\n[[File:George Orwell, c. 1940.jpg|alt=Orwell smiling|thumb|upright|left|A photo of Orwell, c. 1940, digitally coloured]]\nAt the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Orwell's wife Eileen started working in the Censorship Department of the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] in central London, staying during the week with her family in [[Greenwich]]. Orwell also submitted his name to the Central Register for war work, but nothing transpired. \"They won't have me in the army, at any rate at present, because of my lungs\", Orwell told Geoffrey Gorer. He returned to Wallington, and in late 1939 he wrote material for his first collection of essays, ''[[Inside the Whale and Other Essays|Inside the Whale]]''. For the next year he was occupied writing reviews for plays, films and books for ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'', ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]'' and ''New Adelphi''. On 29 March 1940 his long association with ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' began<ref>''A Patriot After All, 1940\u201341'', p. xvii 1998 Secker & Warburg</ref> with a review of a sergeant's account of [[Napoleon]]'s [[French invasion of Russia|retreat from Moscow]]. At the beginning of 1940, the first edition of Connolly's ''[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]'' appeared, and this provided a new outlet for Orwell's work as well as new literary contacts. In May the Orwells took lease of a flat in London at Dorset Chambers, Chagford Street, [[Marylebone]]. It was the time of the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] and the death in France of Eileen's brother Lawrence caused her considerable grief and long-term depression. Throughout this period Orwell kept a wartime diary.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Churchwell |first1=Sarah |title=Diaries |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/books/2009/09/domestic-diaries-orwell-life |accessdate=22 October 2018 |work=New Statesman}}</ref>\n\nOrwell was declared \"unfit for any kind of military service\" by the Medical Board in June, but soon afterwards found an opportunity to become involved in war activities by joining the [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/newsroom/orwell/story/0,,1048203,00.html|title=About George Orwell |website=www.theguardian.com \u2013 Newsroom|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref> He shared [[Tom Wintringham]]'s socialist vision for the Home Guard as a revolutionary People's Militia. His lecture notes for instructing platoon members include advice on street fighting, field fortifications, and the use of [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]] of various kinds. Sergeant Orwell managed to recruit [[Fredric Warburg]] to his unit. During the [[Battle of Britain]] he used to spend weekends with Warburg and his new [[Zionist]] friend, [[T. R. Fyvel|Tosco Fyvel]], at Warburg's house at [[Twyford, Berkshire]]. At Wallington he worked on \"[[England Your England]]\" and in London wrote reviews for various periodicals. Visiting Eileen's family in Greenwich brought him face-to-face with the effects of [[the Blitz]] on East London. In mid-1940, Warburg, Fyvel and Orwell planned [[Searchlight Books]]. Eleven volumes eventually appeared, of which Orwell's ''[[The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius]]'', published on 19 February 1941, was the first.<ref>''A Patriot After All'', p. xviii</ref>\n\nEarly in 1941 he began to write for the American ''[[Partisan Review]]'' which linked Orwell with [[The New York Intellectuals]] who were also anti-Stalinist,<ref>[[Frances Stonor Saunders]], ''[[Who Paid the Piper?]]'', p. 160</ref> and contributed to the Gollancz anthology ''The Betrayal of the Left'', written in the light of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] (although Orwell referred to it as the Russo-German Pact and the Hitler-Stalin Pact<ref>''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 2&nbsp;\u2013 My Country Right or Left 1940\u20131943'' p. 40 (Penguin)</ref>). He also applied unsuccessfully for a job at the [[Air Ministry]]. Meanwhile, he was still writing reviews of books and plays and at this time met the novelist [[Anthony Powell]]. He also took part in a few radio broadcasts for the Eastern Service of the BBC. In March the Orwells moved to a seventh-floor flat at Langford Court, [[St John's Wood]], while at Wallington Orwell was \"[[Dig for Victory|digging for victory]]\" by planting potatoes.\n\n{{Quotation|One could not have a better example of the moral and emotional shallowness of our time, than the fact that we are now all more or less pro Stalin.

He supervised cultural broadcasts to India to counter propaganda from Nazi Germany designed to undermine Imperial links. This was Orwell's first experience of the rigid conformity of life in an office, and it gave him an opportunity to create cultural programmes with contributions from [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Dylan Thomas]], [[E. M. Forster]], [[Ahmad Ali|Ahmed Ali]], [[Mulk Raj Anand]], and [[William Empson]] among others.\n\nAt the end of August he had a dinner with [[H. G. Wells]] which degenerated into a row because Wells had taken offence at observations Orwell made about him in a ''Horizon'' article. In October Orwell had a bout of bronchitis and the illness recurred frequently. [[David Astor]] was looking for a provocative contributor for ''[[The Observer]]'' and invited Orwell to write for him\u2014the first article appearing in March 1942. In early 1942 Eileen changed jobs to work at the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] and in mid-1942 the Orwells moved to a larger flat, a ground floor and basement, 10a Mortimer Crescent in [[Maida Vale]]/[[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]]\u2014\"the kind of lower-middle-class ambience that Orwell thought was London at its best.\" Around the same time Orwell's mother and sister Avril, who had found work in a [[sheet-metal]] factory behind [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross Station]], moved into a flat close to George and Eileen.<ref>Crick (1982), pp. 432\u201333</ref>\n[[File:George-orwell-BBC.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Orwell spoke on many [[BBC]] and other broadcasts, but no recordings are known to survive.<ref name=\"Bowker2013\">{{cite book|author=Gordon Bowker|title=George Orwell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bdAzAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT309|year= 2013|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=978-1405528054|pages=309\u201310}}</ref><ref name=\"Recordings Capture Writers' Voices Off The Page Listen Queue\">{{cite web|title=Recordings Capture Writers' Voices Off The Page Listen Queue|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96030704|publisher=NPR|accessdate=5 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC tried to take George Orwell off air because of 'unattractive' voice\">{{Cite news|last1=Khan|first1=Urmeen|title=BBC tried to take George Orwell off air because of 'unattractive' voice|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/5445579/BBC-tried-to-take-George-Orwell-off-air-because-of-unattractive-voice.html|website=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=5 November 2016|quote=The BBC tried to take the author George Orwell off air because his voice was \"unattractive\", according to archive documents released by the corporation...no recording of Orwell's voice survives but contemporaries\u2014such as the artist Lucian Freud\u2014have described it as \"monotonous\" with \"no power\".|date=2009-06-04}}</ref>]]\nAt the BBC, Orwell introduced ''Voice'', a literary programme for his Indian broadcasts, and by now was leading an active social life with literary friends, particularly on the political left.

In March 1943 Orwell's mother died and around the same time he told Moore he was starting work on a new book, which turned out to be ''[[Animal Farm]]''.\n\nIn September 1943, Orwell resigned from the BBC post that he had occupied for two years.<ref name=\"Crick-LBC\">{{cite book|last=Crick|first=Bernard R.|title=George Orwell: A Life|url=https://archive.org/details/georgeorwelllife0000cric|url-access=registration|date=1980|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston|isbn=978-0316161121}}</ref>{{RP|352}} His resignation followed a report confirming his fears that few Indians listened to the broadcasts,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://orwell.ru/library/novels/Burmese_Days/english/e_mm_int|first=Malcolm |last=Muggeridge|title=Burmese Days ''(Introduction)''|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|year=1962}} Muggeridge recalls that he asked Orwell if such broadcasts were useful, \"'Perhaps not', he said, somewhat crestfallen. He added, more cheerfully, that anyway, no one could pick up the broadcasts except on short-wave sets which cost about the equivalent of an Indian labourer's earnings over 10 years\"</ref> but he was also keen to concentrate on writing ''Animal Farm''. Just six days before his last day of service, on 24 November 1943, his adaptation of the [[fairy tale]], [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s ''[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]'' was broadcast. It was a genre in which he was greatly interested and which appeared on ''Animal Farm''{{'}}s title-page.<ref>''Two Wasted Years'', 1943, p. xxi, Secker & Warburg, 2001</ref> At this time he also resigned from the Home Guard on medical grounds.<ref>''I Have Tried to Tell the Truth'', p. xv. Secker & Warburg, 2001</ref>\n\nIn November 1943, Orwell was appointed literary editor at ''Tribune'', where his assistant was his old friend [[Jon Kimche]]. Orwell was on staff until early 1945, writing over 80 book reviews<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=yRHBGAAACAAJ&dq=ISBN0436205521 |author1=Orwell, G. |author2=Davison, P. |title=I Have Tried to Tell the Truth |publisher=Secker & Warburg |location =London |year=1999 |isbn=978-0436203701}}</ref> and on 3 December 1943 started his regular personal column, \"[[As I Please]]\", usually addressing three or four subjects in each.<ref>''I Have Tried to Tell the Truth'', p. xxix</ref> He was still writing reviews for other magazines, including ''Partisan Review'', ''Horizon'', and the New York ''[[The Nation|Nation]]'' and becoming a respected pundit among left-wing circles but also a close friend of people on the right such as Powell, Astor and [[Malcolm Muggeridge]]. By April 1944 ''Animal Farm'' was ready for publication. Gollancz refused to publish it, considering it an attack on the Soviet regime which was a crucial ally in the war. A similar fate was met from other publishers (including [[T. S. Eliot]] at [[Faber and Faber]]) until [[Jonathan Cape]] agreed to take it.\n\nIn May the Orwells had the opportunity to adopt a child, thanks to the contacts of Eileen's sister Gwen O'Shaughnessy, then a doctor in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. In June a [[V-1 flying bomb]] struck Mortimer Crescent and the Orwells had to find somewhere else to live. Orwell had to scrabble around in the rubble for his collection of books, which he had finally managed to transfer from Wallington, carting them away in a wheelbarrow.\n\nAnother blow was Cape's reversal of his plan to publish ''Animal Farm''. The decision followed his personal visit to [[Peter Smollett]], an official at the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]]. Smollett was later identified as a Soviet agent.<ref name=\"TGA\">{{cite news |author=Garton Ash, Timothy |authorlink=Timothy Garton Ash |title=Orwell's List |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |date=25 September 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305071504/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2003/09/25/orwells-list/|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2003/09/25/orwells-list/|archivedate=5 March 2016|accessdate=26 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Caute2009\">{{cite book |last=Caute |first=David |authorlink=David Caute |title=Politics and the Novel during the Cold War |year=2009 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |location=New Brunswick, NJ |isbn=978-1412811613 |page=79}}</ref>\n\nThe Orwells spent some time in the North East, near [[Carlton, County Durham]], dealing with matters in the adoption of a boy whom they named Richard Horatio Blair.<ref>\"He had led a quiet life as Richard Blair, not 'Richard Orwell'\": Shelden (1991: 398; 489)</ref> By September 1944 they had set up home in [[Islington]], at 27b [[Canonbury]] Square.<ref>Orwell: Collected Works, I Have Tried to Tell the Truth, p. 283</ref> Baby Richard joined them there, and Eileen gave up her work at the Ministry of Food to look after her family. [[Secker & Warburg]] had agreed to publish ''Animal Farm'', planned for the following March, although it did not appear in print until August 1945. By February 1945 David Astor had invited Orwell to become a war correspondent for the ''Observer''. Orwell had been looking for the opportunity throughout the war, but his failed medical reports prevented him from being allowed anywhere near action. He went to Paris after the liberation of France and to Cologne once it had been occupied by the Allies.\n\nIt was while he was there that Eileen went into hospital for a [[hysterectomy]] and died under anaesthetic on 29 March 1945. She had not given Orwell much notice about this operation because of worries about the cost and because she expected to make a speedy recovery. Orwell returned home for a while and then went back to Europe. He returned finally to London to cover the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] at the beginning of July. ''[[Animal Farm|Animal Farm: A Fairy Story]]'' was published in Britain on 17 August 1945, and a year later in the US, on 26 August 1946.\n\n===Jura and ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''===\n''Animal Farm'' had particular resonance in the post-war climate and its worldwide success made Orwell a sought-after figure. For the next four years, Orwell mixed journalistic work\u2014mainly for ''Tribune'', ''The Observer'' and the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'', though he also contributed to many small-circulation political and [[literary magazine]]s\u2014with writing his best-known work, ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', which was published in 1949.\n[[File:Barnhill (Cnoc an t-Sabhail) - geograph.org.uk - 451643.jpg|thumb|[[Barnhill, Jura|Barnhill]] on the Isle of [[Jura, Scotland]]. Orwell completed ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' while living in the farmhouse.]]\n\nIn the year following Eileen's death he published around 130 articles and a selection of his ''[[Critical Essays (Orwell)|Critical Essays]]'', while remaining active in various political lobbying campaigns. He employed a housekeeper, Susan Watson, to look after his adopted son at the [[Islington]] flat, which visitors now described as \"bleak\". In September he spent a fortnight on the island of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]] in the [[Inner Hebrides]] and saw it as a place to escape from the hassle of London literary life. David Astor was instrumental in arranging a place for Orwell on Jura.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theorwellprize.co.uk/news/remembering-jura/ |title=Remembering Jura, Richard Blair |publisher=Theorwellprize.co.uk |date=5 October 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref> Astor's family owned Scottish estates in the area and a fellow Old Etonian, Robin Fletcher, had a property on the island. In late 1945 and early 1946 Orwell made several hopeless and unwelcome marriage proposals to younger women, including [[Celia Kirwan]] (who later became [[Arthur Koestler]]'s sister-in-law), Ann Popham who happened to live in the same block of flats and [[Sonia Brownell]], one of Connolly's coterie at the ''Horizon'' office. Orwell suffered a tubercular haemorrhage in February 1946 but disguised his illness. In 1945 or early 1946, while still living at Canonbury Square, Orwell wrote an article on \"British Cookery\", complete with recipes, commissioned by the [[British Council]]. Given the post-war shortages, both parties agreed not to publish it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theorwellprize.co.uk/life-and-work.aspx |title=The Orwell Prize {{!}} Life and Work \u2013 Exclusive Access to the Orwell Archive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210180526/http://www.theorwellprize.co.uk/life-and-work.aspx |archivedate=10 December 2007}}</ref> His sister Marjorie died of kidney disease in May and shortly after, on 22 May 1946, Orwell set off to live on the Isle of Jura at a house known as [[Barnhill, Jura|Barnhill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orwelltoday.com/jurabarnhillvisit.shtml|title= Barnhill}} is located at {{Coord|56|06|39|N|5|41|30|W|display=inline}} ([[British national grid reference system]] NR705970)</ref>\n\nThis was an abandoned farmhouse with outbuildings near the northern end of the island, situated at the end of a five-mile (8&nbsp;km), heavily rutted track from Ardlussa, where the owners lived. Conditions at the farmhouse were primitive but the natural history and the challenge of improving the place appealed to Orwell. His sister Avril accompanied him there and young novelist [[Paul Potts (writer)|Paul Potts]] made up the party. In July Susan Watson arrived with Orwell's son Richard. Tensions developed and Potts departed after one of his manuscripts was used to light the fire. Orwell meanwhile set to work on ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. Later Susan Watson's boyfriend [[David Holbrook]] arrived. A fan of Orwell since school days, he found the reality very different, with Orwell hostile and disagreeable probably because of Holbrook's membership of the Communist Party.<ref>David Holbrook in Stephen Wadham's ''Remembering Orwell'' Penguin Books 1984</ref> Susan Watson could no longer stand being with Avril and she and her boyfriend left.\n\nOrwell returned to London in late 1946 and picked up his literary journalism again. Now a well-known writer, he was swamped with work. Apart from a visit to Jura in the new year he stayed in London for [[Winter of 1946\u20131947 in the United Kingdom|one of the coldest British winters on record]] and with such a national shortage of fuel that he burnt his furniture and his child's toys. The heavy smog in the days before the [[Clean Air Act 1956]] did little to help his health about which he was reticent, keeping clear of medical attention. Meanwhile, he had to cope with rival claims of publishers Gollancz and Warburg for publishing rights. About this time he co-edited a collection titled ''British Pamphleteers'' with [[Reginald Reynolds]]. As a result of the success of ''Animal Farm'', Orwell was expecting a large bill from the Inland Revenue and he contacted a firm of accountants of which the senior partner was Jack Harrison. The firm advised Orwell to establish a company to own his copyright and to receive his royalties and set up a \"service agreement\" so that he could draw a salary. Such a company \"George Orwell Productions Ltd\" (GOP Ltd) was set up on 12 September 1947 although the service agreement was not then put into effect. Jack Harrison left the details at this stage to junior colleagues.<ref name=Carroll>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article466206.ece |title=Tim Carroll 'A writer wronged' |journal=The Sunday Times |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |date= 15 August 2014|accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nOrwell left London for Jura on 10 April 1947.<ref name=Taylor/> In July he ended the lease on the Wallington cottage.<ref>Crick (1982), p. 530</ref> Back on Jura he worked on ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' and made good progress.

In December a chest specialist was summoned from Glasgow who pronounced Orwell seriously ill and a week before Christmas 1947 he was in [[Hairmyres Hospital]] in East Kilbride, then a small village in the countryside, on the outskirts of Glasgow. [[Tuberculosis]] was diagnosed and the request for permission to import [[streptomycin]] to treat Orwell went as far as [[Aneurin Bevan]], then Minister of Health. [[David Astor]] helped with supply and payment and Orwell began his course of streptomycin on 19 or 20 February 1948.<ref>It Is what I Think, p. 274</ref> By the end of July 1948 Orwell was able to return to Jura and by December he had finished the manuscript of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''. In January 1949, in a very weak condition, he set off for a sanatorium at [[Cranham, Gloucestershire]], escorted by Richard Rees.\n\nThe sanatorium at Cranham consisted of a series of small wooden chalets or huts in a remote part of the [[Cotswolds]] near [[Stroud]]. Visitors were shocked by Orwell's appearance and concerned by the shortcomings and ineffectiveness of the treatment. Friends were worried about his finances, but by now he was comparatively well-off. He was writing to many of his friends, including Jacintha Buddicom, who had \"rediscovered\" him, and in March 1949, was visited by Celia Kirwan. Kirwan had just started working for a [[Foreign Office]] unit, the [[Information Research Department]], set up by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government to publish anti-communist propaganda, and Orwell gave her a list of people he considered to be unsuitable as IRD authors because of their pro-communist leanings.

According to [[Irving Howe]], Orwell was \"the best English essayist since [[William Hazlitt|Hazlitt]], perhaps since [[Samuel Johnson|Dr Johnson]].\"<ref name=\"Howe\">{{Cite journal|authorlink=Irving Howe|title=George Orwell: 'As the bones know'|first=Irving|last=Howe|journal=[[Harper's Magazine]]|date= January 1969}}(reprinted in ''[[Newsweek]]''). Howe considered Orwell \"the finest journalist of his day and the foremost architect of the English essay since [[William Hazlitt|Hazlitt]]\".</ref>\n\nModern readers are more often introduced to Orwell as a novelist, particularly through his enormously successful titles ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. The former is often thought to reflect degeneration in the Soviet Union after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the rise of [[Stalinism]]; the latter, life under [[totalitarianism|totalitarian rule]]. ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' is often compared to ''[[Brave New World]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]]; both are powerful [[dystopia]]n novels warning of a future world where the state machine exerts complete control over social life. In 1984, ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' and [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' were honoured with the [[Prometheus Award]] for their contributions to dystopian literature. In 2011 he received it again for ''Animal Farm''.\n\n''[[Coming Up for Air]]'', his last novel before World War II, is the most \"English\" of his novels; alarms of war mingle with images of idyllic [[Thames]]-side [[Edwardian]] childhood of protagonist George Bowling. The novel is pessimistic; industrialism and capitalism have killed the best of Old England, and there were great, new external threats. In homely terms, its protagonist George Bowling posits the totalitarian hypotheses of [[Franz Borkenau]], Orwell, [[Ignazio Silone]] and Koestler: \"Old Hitler's something different. So's Joe Stalin. They aren't like these chaps in the old days who crucified people and chopped their heads off and so forth, just for the fun of it&nbsp;... They're something quite new\u2014something that's never been heard of before\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Penguin complete novels of George Orwell |date=1976 |publisher=Penguin |page=523}}</ref>\n\n===Literary influences===\nIn an autobiographical piece that Orwell sent to the editors of ''Twentieth Century Authors'' in 1940, he wrote: \"The writers I care about most and never grow tired of are: [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], [[Henry Fielding|Fielding]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Charles Reade]], [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]] and, among modern writers, [[James Joyce]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[D. H. Lawrence]]. But I believe the modern writer who has influenced me most is [[W. Somerset Maugham]], whom I admire immensely for his power of telling a story straightforwardly and without frills.\" Elsewhere, Orwell strongly praised the works of [[Jack London]], especially his book ''[[The Road (London book)|The Road]]''. Orwell's investigation of poverty in ''The Road to Wigan Pier'' strongly resembles that of Jack London's ''[[The People of the Abyss]]'', in which the American journalist disguises himself as an out-of-work sailor to investigate the lives of the poor in London. In his essay \"Politics vs. Literature: An Examination of Gulliver's Travels\" (1946) Orwell wrote: \"If I had to make a list of six books which were to be preserved when all others were destroyed, I would certainly put ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' among them.\"\n\nOrwell was an admirer of [[Arthur Koestler]] and became a close friend during the three years that Koestler and his wife Mamain spent at the cottage of Bwlch Ocyn, a secluded farmhouse that belonged to [[Clough Williams-Ellis]], in the [[Vale of Ffestiniog]]. Orwell reviewed Koestler's. ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' for the ''[[New Statesman]]'' in 1941, saying:\n<blockquote>\nBrilliant as this book is as a novel, and a piece of brilliant literature, it is probably most valuable as an interpretation of the Moscow \"confessions\" by someone with an inner knowledge of totalitarian methods. What was frightening about these trials was not the fact that they happened\u2014for obviously such things are necessary in a totalitarian society\u2014but the eagerness of Western intellectuals to justify them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesartsreview.org/to-the-detriment-of-us-all-the-untouched-legacy-of-arthur-koestler-and-george-orwell/|title=The Untouched Legacy of Arthur Koestler and George Orwell|date=24 February 2016|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nOther writers admired by Orwell included: [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[George Gissing]], [[Graham Greene]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Tobias Smollett]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Joseph Conrad]], and [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]].<ref>''Letter to Gleb Struve, 17 February 1944'', Orwell: Essays, Journalism and Letters Vol 3, eds.

It is the face of a man of about forty, with a small beard and a high colour. He is laughing, with a touch of anger in his laughter, but no triumph, no malignity. It is the face of a man who is always fighting against something, but who fights in the open and is not frightened, the face of a man who is generously angry\u2014in other words, of a nineteenth-century liberal, a free intelligence, a type hated with equal hatred by all the smelly little orthodoxies which are now contending for our souls.}}\n\n[[George Woodcock]] suggested that the last two sentences also describe Orwell.<ref>George Woodcock Introduction to Stephen Wadhams ''Remembering Orwell'' Penguin 1984</ref>\n\nOrwell wrote a critique of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play ''[[Arms and the Man#Critical acclaim|Arms and the Man]]''. He considered this Shaw's best play and the most likely to remain socially relevant, because of its theme that war is not, generally speaking, a glorious romantic adventure. His 1945 essay ''In Defence of P.G. Wodehouse'' contains an amusing assessment of Wodehouse's writing and also argues that his broadcasts from Germany (during the war) did not really make him a traitor. He accused [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|The Ministry of Information]] of exaggerating Wodehouse's actions for propaganda purposes.\n\n=== Food writing ===\nIn 1946, the [[British Council]] commissioned Orwell to write an essay on British food as part of a drive to promote British relations abroad.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|agency=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47155257|title=Orwell gets apology for rejected food essay|date=7 February 2019|access-date=7 February 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref> In the essay titled ''British Cookery,'' Orwell described the British diet as \"a simple, rather heavy, perhaps slightly barbarous diet\" and where \"hot drinks are acceptable at most hours of the day\".<ref name=\":0\"/> He discusses the ritual of breakfast in the UK, \"this is not a snack but a serious meal.

In ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', Orwell described a totalitarian government that controlled thought by controlling language, making certain ideas literally unthinkable. Several words and phrases from ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' have entered popular language. \"[[Newspeak]]\" is a simplified and obfuscatory language designed to make independent thought impossible. \"[[Doublethink]]\" means holding two contradictory beliefs simultaneously. The \"[[Thought Police]]\" are those who suppress all dissenting opinion. \"[[Prolefeed]]\" is homogenised, manufactured superficial literature, film and music used to control and indoctrinate the populace through docility. \"[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]\" is a supreme dictator who watches everyone.\n\nOrwell may have been the first to use the term \"[[cold war (general term)|cold war]]\" to refer to the state of tension between powers in the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc that followed World War II in his essay, \"You and the Atom Bomb\", published in ''Tribune'' on 19 October 1945.

''George Orwell: Complete Works'' XI 336</ref> Jackson was to be the most critical of Orwell's marriage to [[Eileen O'Shaughnessy]], but their later correspondence hints at a complicity. Eileen at the time was more concerned about Orwell's closeness to Brenda Salkield. Orwell had an affair with his secretary at ''Tribune'' which caused Eileen much distress, and others have been mooted. In a letter to Ann Popham he wrote: \"I was sometimes unfaithful to Eileen, and I also treated her badly, and I think she treated me badly, too, at times, but it was a real marriage, in the sense that we had been through awful struggles together and she understood all about my work, etc.\"<ref>Crick (1982), p. 480</ref> Similarly he suggested to Celia Kirwan that they had both been unfaithful.<ref>Celia Goodman interview with Shelden June 1989 in Michael Shelden ''Orwell: The Authorised Biography''</ref> There are several testaments that it was a well-matched and happy marriage.<ref name=Dakin>Henry Dakin in Stephen Wadhams ''Remembering Orwell''</ref><ref name=Donahue>Patrica Donahue in Stephen Wadhams ''Remembering Orwell''</ref><ref>Michael Meyer ''Not Prince Hamlet: Literary and Theatrical Memoirs'' 1989</ref>\n\nIn June 1944, Orwell and Eileen adopted a three-week-old boy they named Richard Horatio.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Lost Orwell|first=Peter|last=Davison|authorlink=Peter Davison (professor)|page=244|publisher=Timewell Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1857252149}}</ref> According to Richard, Orwell was a wonderful father who gave him devoted, if rather rugged, attention and a great degree of freedom.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/george-packer/orwell-and-son|title=Orwell and Son|journal=The New Yorker|accessdate=2 September 2017|date=2009-03-25}}</ref> After Orwell's death Richard went to live with Orwell's sister and her husband.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://orwellsocietyblog.wordpress.com/2011/10/27/richard-blair-on-life-with-my-aunt-avril/|title=Richard Blair on Life With My Aunt Avril|date=27 October 2011|accessdate=2 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829203004/https://orwellsocietyblog.wordpress.com/2011/10/27/richard-blair-on-life-with-my-aunt-avril/|archive-date=29 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nBlair was very lonely after Eileen's death in 1945, and desperate for a wife, both as companion for himself and as mother for Richard. He proposed marriage to four women, including Celia Kirwan, and eventually [[Sonia Brownell]] accepted.<ref>Spurling, Hilary. 2002.

Some maintain that Sonia was the model for Julia in ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''.\n\n===Social interactions===\nOrwell was noted for very close and enduring friendships with a few friends, but these were generally people with a similar background or with a similar level of literary ability. Ungregarious, he was out of place in a crowd and his discomfort was exacerbated when he was outside his own class. Though representing himself as a spokesman for the common man, he often appeared out of place with real working people. His brother-in-law Humphrey Dakin, a \"Hail fellow, well met\" type, who took him to a local pub in Leeds, said that he was told by the landlord: \"Don't bring that bugger in here again.\"<ref>Ian Angus Interview 23\u201325 April 1965 quoted in Stansky and Abrahams ''The Unknown George Orwell''</ref> Adrian Fierz commented \"He wasn't interested in racing or greyhounds or pub crawling or [[shove ha'penny]].

His extreme politeness was recalled by a member of the family he worked for; she declared that the family referred to him as \"[[Stan Laurel|Laurel]]\" after the film comedian.<ref name=\"autogenerated1996\"/> With his gangling figure and awkwardness, Orwell's friends often saw him as a figure of fun. [[Geoffrey Gorer]] commented \"He was awfully likely to knock things off tables, trip over things. I mean, he was a gangling, physically badly co-ordinated young man. I think his feeling [was] that even the inanimate world was against him.\"<ref>Geoffrey Gorer&nbsp;\u2013 recorded for Melvyn Bragg BBC Omnibus production ''The Road to the Left'' 1970</ref> When he shared a flat with Heppenstall and Sayer, he was treated in a patronising manner by the younger men.<ref>Rayner Heppenstall ''Four Absentees'' in Audrey Coppard and Bernard Crick ''Orwell Remembered'' 1984</ref> At the BBC in the 1940s, \"everybody would pull his leg\"<ref name =Wilshin>Sunday Wilshin in Stephen Wadhams ''Remembering Orwell'' Penguin Books 1984</ref> and Spender described him as having real entertainment value \"like, as I say, watching a Charlie Chaplin movie.\"<ref>Stephen Spender in Stephen Wadhams ''Remembering Orwell'' Penguin Books 1984</ref> A friend of Eileen's reminisced about her tolerance and humour, often at Orwell's expense.<ref name=Donahue/>\n\nOne biography of Orwell accused him of having had an authoritarian streak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780805076936-1 |title=Powell's Books&nbsp;\u2013 Synopses and Reviews of D J Taylor ''Orwell: The Life'' |publisher=Powells.com |date=12 October 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref> In Burma, he struck out at a Burmese boy who, while \"fooling around\" with his friends, had \"accidentally bumped into him\" at a station, resulting in Orwell falling \"heavily\" down some stairs.<ref>Maung Htin Aung ''George Orwell and Burma'' in Miriam Goss ''The World of George Orwell'' Weidenfeld & Nicolson 1971</ref> One of his former pupils recalled [[school corporal punishment|being beaten]] so hard he could not sit down for a week.<ref>Interview with Geoffrey Stevens, Crick (1982), pp. 222\u201323</ref> When sharing a flat with Orwell, Heppenstall came home late one night in an advanced stage of loud inebriation. The upshot was that Heppenstall ended up with a bloody nose and was locked in a room. When he complained, Orwell hit him across the legs with a [[shooting stick]] and Heppenstall then had to defend himself with a chair. Years later, after Orwell's death, Heppenstall wrote a dramatic account of the incident called \"The Shooting Stick\"<ref>Heppenstall ''The Shooting Stick'' Twentieth Century April 1955</ref> and Mabel Fierz confirmed that Heppenstall came to her in a sorry state the following day.<ref>Crick (1982), pp. 274\u201375</ref>\n\nOrwell got on well with young people. The pupil he beat considered him the best of teachers and the young recruits in Barcelona tried to drink him under the table without success. His nephew recalled Uncle Eric laughing louder than anyone in the cinema at a [[Charlie Chaplin]] film.<ref name= Dakin/>\n\nIn the wake of his most famous works, he attracted many uncritical hangers-on, but many others who sought him found him aloof and even dull. With his soft voice, he was sometimes shouted down or excluded from discussions.<ref>Michael Meyer ''Not Prince Hamlet: Literary and Theatrical Memoirs'' Secker and Warburg 1989</ref> At this time, he was severely ill; it was wartime or the austerity period after it; during the war his wife suffered from depression; and after her death he was lonely and unhappy. In addition to that, he always lived frugally and seemed unable to care for himself properly. As a result of all this, people found his circumstances bleak.<ref>T. R.

His first article, \"La Censure en Angleterre\" (\"Censorship in England\"), was an attempt to account for the \"extraordinary and illogical\" moral censorship of plays and novels then practised in Britain. His own explanation was that the rise of the \"puritan middle class,\" who had stricter morals than the aristocracy, tightened the rules of censorship in the 19th century. Orwell's first published article in his home country, \"A Farthing Newspaper\", was a critique of the new French daily the ''Ami de Peuple''. This paper was sold much more cheaply than most others, and was intended for ordinary people to read. Orwell pointed out that its proprietor [[Fran\u00e7ois Coty]] also owned the right-wing dailies ''[[Le Figaro]]'' and ''[[Le Gaulois]]'', which the ''Ami de Peuple'' was supposedly competing against. Orwell suggested that cheap newspapers were no more than a vehicle for advertising and anti-leftist propaganda, and predicted the world might soon see [[free newspapers]] which would drive legitimate dailies out of business.<ref>{{Citation |first = P |last = Davison |title = A Kind of Compulsion |publisher = Secker & Warburg |place = London |year = 2000 |pages = 117\u201321}}</ref>\n\nWriting for ''Le Progr\u00e8s Civique'', Orwell described the [[British Raj|British colonial government]] in Burma and India:\n\n{{Quote |The government of all the Indian provinces under the control of the [[British Empire]] is of necessity despotic, because only the threat of force can subdue a population of several million subjects.

In Part 2 of ''The Road to Wigan Pier'', published by the [[Left Book Club]], Orwell stated that \"a real Socialist is one who wishes\u2014not merely conceives it as desirable, but actively wishes\u2014to see tyranny overthrown.\" Orwell stated in \"Why I Write\" (1946): \"Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against [[totalitarianism]] and for [[democratic socialism]], as I understand it.\"<ref>{{Citation |contribution = Why I Write |title = The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell |volume = 1&nbsp;\u2013 An Age Like This 1945\u20131950 |page = 23 |publisher = Penguin}}</ref> Orwell was a proponent of a federal socialist Europe, a position outlined in his 1947 essay \"Toward European Unity,\" which first appeared in ''[[Partisan Review]]''. According to biographer [[John Newsinger]]:\n{{Quote|The other crucial dimension to Orwell's socialism was his recognition that the Soviet Union was not socialist. Unlike many on the left, instead of abandoning socialism once he discovered the full horror of Stalinist rule in the Soviet Union, Orwell abandoned the Soviet Union and instead remained a socialist\u2014indeed he became more committed to the socialist cause than ever.<ref name=\"newsinger\"/>}}\n\nIn his 1938 essay \"Why I joined the Independent Labour Party,\" published in the ILP-affiliated ''[[Labour Leader|New Leader]]'', Orwell wrote:\n{{Quote |For some years past I have managed to make the capitalist class pay me several pounds a week for writing books against capitalism.

He left the ILP because of its opposition to the war and adopted a political position of \"revolutionary patriotism\". In December 1940 he wrote in ''Tribune'' (the Labour left's weekly): \"We are in a strange period of history in which a revolutionary has to be a patriot and a patriot has to be a revolutionary.\" During the war, Orwell was highly critical of the popular idea that an Anglo-Soviet alliance would be the basis of a post-war world of peace and prosperity. In 1942, commenting on journalist [[E. H. Carr]]'s pro-Soviet views, Orwell stated that \"all the appeasers, e.g. Professor E.H. Carr, have switched their allegiance from Hitler to Stalin.\"<ref>{{cite web |last = Collini |first =Stefan |title = E.H.

In any state of society where crime can be profitable you have got to have a harsh criminal law and administer it ruthlessly.\"\n\nIn his reply (dated 15 November 1943) to an invitation from the [[Katharine Stewart-Murray, Duchess of Atholl|Duchess of Atholl]] to speak for the British League for European Freedom, he stated that he did not agree with their objectives. He admitted that what they said was \"more truthful than the lying propaganda found in most of the press\", but added that he could not \"associate himself with an essentially Conservative body\" that claimed to \"defend democracy in Europe\" but had \"nothing to say about British imperialism.\" His closing paragraph stated: \"I belong to the Left and must work inside it, much as I hate Russian totalitarianism and its poisonous influence in this country.\"<ref name=\"In Front of Your Nose\">Orwell, Sonia and Angus, Ian (eds.).

Once a whore, always a whore.\" According to Newsinger, although Orwell \"was always critical of the 1945\u201351 Labour government's moderation, his support for it began to pull him to the right politically.

Eberhart has an underhanded goal in mind: He wants to get his talented nephew Tom Fletcher ([[Gordon MacRae]]) out of the Corps of Cadets and turn him into a Broadway star. Bix, who is broke or nearly, agrees to arrange this in return for a cut of Fletcher's future earnings.\n\nHe and his loyal assistant and girlfriend, Eve Dillon ([[Virginia Mayo]]), travel to West Point to turn the annual 100th Night Show written by Tom and his friend  Hal Courtland ([[Gene Nelson]]) from amateur hour into a Broadway-level production. Bix quickly runs afoul of the Military Academy's rules and customs, cold-cocking Bull Gilbert ([[Alan Hale Jr.]]), the cadet who is playing the Princess in the show, after Bull mouths off during rehearsal. The Commandant of Cadets wants to throw him off the Academy grounds, but the cadets in the 100th Night Show, led by Tom, persuade the Commandant to extend to Bixby a privilege seldom offered to outsiders: to live as one of them, a temporary plebe in the Corps of Cadets. The Com is dubious; he's seen Bixby's wartime record, an equal amount of appalling breaches of discipline (including selling a B-17 to an Arab sheik, and going AWOL from a rest camp to fight the Germans with the French Resistance) and incredible acts of valor that garnered Bix the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], the [[Silver Star]], two [[Purple Heart|Purple Hearts]], and the French  [[Medaille Militaire]], a medal seldom awarded to foreigners.\n\nIn pursuit of the goal of getting Tom Fletcher out of the Army, Bix persuades his protege Jan Wilson ([[Doris Day]]), a chorus girl he discovered and turned into a movie star, to come to a \"hop\" (dance) thrown by the cast of the 100th Night Show as Tom's date. She finds herself very taken with Cadet Fletcher, and takes on the role of the Princess in the show (courtesy of Bix persuading the Commandant to break tradition and allow a woman to play a female role, West Point at the time being an all-male school; he later persuades the Commandant to allow Eve to play in the show as well). The two of them fall in love, but there are the problems of Tom's military obligation and Jan's Hollywood contracts to be resolved.\n\nTom goes off the deep end and submits his resignation from the Military Academy. Bix, Bull Gilbert, and Hal, the lead dancer of the 100th Nigh Show, go AWOL, follow Tom to New York where he has gone to be with Jan, and bring him back to West Point. But before they return to the Academy, Jan says no to Tom's proposal, realizing how important it is to him that he graduate and be commissioned. Tom is devastated.\n\nWise in the ways of military bureaucracy, Bixby succeeds in intercepting and destroying Tom's resignation letter before official notice can be taken of it, but Tom, Bull, and Hal  are arrested on their return to the Academy by order of the Commandant and are confined to quarters except when on duty or in class. The show is threatened with cancellation.\n\nThe cadets in the show and Bix use their influence to arrange a meeting with the French Premier, visiting the United States on a diplomatic mission. Because of a West Point custom that a visiting dignitary can \"request amnesty,\" the forgiving of all disciplinary offenses for the Corps of Cadets, he is the one man in the country who can insure that the 100th Night Show goes on. Bixby shows the Premier his Medaille Militaire, and the Premier rearranges his schedule to visit the Military Academy, requesting that the Superintendent grant the cadets amnesty at a military parade in his honor.  The Superintendent does so, and the show will go on.\n\nEberhart comes to West Point to see the show, presuming that he will be bringing his nephew home with him to become a Broadway star. Deciding that her love for Tom is more important than her career, Jan comes north in time to take Bull Gilbert's place as the Princess (much to Bull's relief) for the \"Flirtation Rock\" number and the two reconcile, with their marriage on graduation implied.\n\nEberhart, the Broadway producer, comes backstage to find out from Bix when he can take Fletcher back to New York to start his career. When Bixby tells him that Tom is going to become a second lieutenant and not an actor, Eberhart swears that he will see to it Bix never works in show business again. With nothing to lose, Bix  takes a swing at the producer, who ducks. The punch connects with Hal, knocking him out and injuring his leg so he can't go on. Bix goes on with Eve for the specialty dance number \"It Could Only Happen In Brooklyn.\"\n\nBefore the Finale, Tom calls Bix out onto the stage and informs him that instead of the book and libretto going into the Academy archives never to be seen again, they are being given to him to turn into a Broadway show.

The ceremony is observed during various times like equinoxes, commencement of an era (''[[Yuga]]'') and its ending, eclipses and [[Makara Sankranti]]. The ceremony is usually performed in sacred places like temples, rivers and tanks. The amount of gold thus weighed is distributed among deserving men. As per Hindu legend, after the end of each era, the whole world immerses in a deluge on account of the wrath of Hindu god [[Shiva]] for the sins committed by humans in earth. [[Brahma]], the Hindu god of creation, recreated the world during the start of current ''[[Kali Yuga]]'' (Iron Age). Shiva declared that after the end of previous era, a divine pot would reach a holy spot. As the divine pot reached Kumbakonam, Shiva, in the form of a hunter, broke the pot with an arrow. The pot broke into many parts and scattered around, which became the cause for so many temples in the town - Kumbeswara, Someswara, Kasi Viswanatha, Nageswara, Kamata Viswanatha, Abimukeshwara, Goutameswara, Banapuriswara, Varahar, Lakshminaryana, Sarangapani, Chakrapani and Varadharaja. Brahma prayed to Shiva to allow pilgrims to visit the tank during the sacred occasion.

The ceremony is observed during various times like equinoxes, commencement of an era (''[[Yuga]]'') and its ending, eclipses and [[Makara Sankranti]]. The ceremony is usually performed in sacred places like temples, rivers and tanks. The amount of gold thus weighed is distributed among deserving men. As per Hindu legend, after the end of each era, the whole world immerses in a deluge on account of the wrath of Hindu god [[Shiva]] for the sins committed by humans in earth. [[Brahma]], the Hindu god of creation, recreated the world during the start of current ''[[Kali Yuga]]'' (Iron Age). Shiva declared that after the end of previous era, a divine pot would reach a holy spot. As the divine pot reached Kumbakonam, Shiva, in the form of a hunter, broke the pot with an arrow. The pot broke into many parts and scattered around, which became the cause for so many temples in the town - Kumbeswara, Someswara, Kasi Viswanatha, Nageswara, Kamata Viswanatha, Abimukeshwara, Goutameswara, Banapuriswara, Varahar, Lakshminaryana, Sarangapani, Chakrapani and Varadharaja. Brahma prayed to Shiva to allow pilgrims to visit the tank during the sacred occasion. Shiva acceded to the demand and is believed to arrive along with Vishnu and other celestial deities at the centre of the tank. Astronomically, when the planet Jupiter passes over Leo on the day of the festival, it is believed to bring all water bodies together and enrich the tank with minerals.

During the late 1960s, Obote's [[move to the left]], which included his [[Common Man's Charter]] and the [[nationalization|nationalisation]] of 80 British companies, had made the West worried that he would pose a threat to Western capitalist interests in Africa and make Uganda an ally of the [[Soviet Union]]. Amin, who had served with the King's African Rifles and taken part in Britain's suppression of the [[Mau Mau uprising]] prior to Ugandan independence, was known by the British as \"intensely loyal to Britain\".

Nyabire, a member of the [[Kakwa people|Kakwa ethnic group]], converted from [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] to [[Islam]] in 1910 and changed his name to Amin Dada. He named his first-born son after himself. Abandoned by his father at a young age, Idi Amin grew up with his mother's family in a rural farming town in north-western Uganda. Guweddeko states that Amin's mother was Assa Aatte (1904\u20131970), an ethnic [[Lugbara people|Lugbara]] and a traditional herbalist who treated members of [[Buganda]] royalty, among others.<ref name=\"monitor_01012004\"/> Some sources have also described Amin as being of mixed Kakwa-Nubian origin.{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=85}}{{efn|The Nubians of Uganda were \"an extremely fluid category\".{{sfn|Nugent|2012|p=233}} They are often portrayed as descendants of [[Emin Pasha]]'s mostly Muslim soldiers who fled to Uganda after being defeated by [[Mahdist State|Mahdist Sudanese forces]] in the 1880s. Regarded as martial people, they were consequently recruited into British colonial units; as a result, West Nile people who wanted to join the military often claimed to be Nubians. This led to the paradoxical situation that the Nubians were both \"detribalised\" yet had also a distinct identity intimately linked to the West Nile region, to Islam, and to military service.{{sfn|Leopold|2005|p=60}} Amin himself stated that members of different tribes could become Nubians.{{sfn|Nugent|2012|pp=233\u2013234}} }}\n\nAmin joined an Islamic school in [[Bombo, Uganda|Bombo]] in 1941.
