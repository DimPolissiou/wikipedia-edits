ELF waves can penetrate [[seawater]], which makes them useful in [[communication with submarines]], and a few nations have built military ELF transmitters to transmit signals to their submerged submarines, consisting of huge grounded wire antennas ([[ground dipole]]s) 15 - 60 km long driven by transmitters producing [[megawatt]]s of power.

The space between the conductive Earth's surface and the conductive D layer acts as a parallel-plate [[waveguide]] which confines ELF waves, allowing them to propagate long distances without escaping into space. In contrast to VLF waves, the height of the layer is much less than one wavelength at ELF frequencies, so the only mode that can propagate at ELF frequencies is the [[TEM mode]] in [[vertical polarization]], with the [[electric field]] vertical and the [[magnetic field]] horizontal.

The fundamental Schumann resonance is at approximately 7.83&nbsp;Hz, the frequency at which the [[wavelength]] equals the circumference of the Earth, and higher harmonics occur at 14.1, 20.3, 26.4, and 32.4&nbsp;Hz, etc. Lightning strikes excite these resonances, causing the Earth-ionosphere cavity to \"ring\" like a bell, resulting in a peak in the noise spectrum at these frequencies, so the Schumann resonances can be used to monitor global thunderstorm activity.\n\nInterest in Schumann resonances was renewed in 1993 when E. R. Williams showed a correlation between the resonance frequency and tropical air temperatures, suggesting the resonance could be used to monitor [[global warming]].<ref name=\"Williams\">{{cite journal\n  | last1  = Williams\n  | first1 = Earle R.\n  | title = The Schumann resonance: A global tropical thermometer\n  | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]\n  | volume = 256\n  | issue = 5060\n  | pages = 1184\u20131187\n  | date = May 22, 1992\n  | issn = \n  | doi =  10.1126/science.256.5060.1184 \n  | pmid = 17795213\n | id = \n  | bibcode =1992Sci...256.1184W}}</ref><ref name=\"Barr2\" />\n\n==Submarine communications==\n[[Image:Ground dipole ELF antenna.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|A [[ground dipole]] antenna used for transmitting ELF waves, similar to the U.S. Navy Clam Lake antennas, showing how it works.

Signals in the ELF frequency range, however, can penetrate much deeper. Two factors limit the usefulness of ELF communications channels: the low data transmission rate of a few characters per minute and, to a lesser extent, the one-way nature due to the impracticality of installing an antenna of the required size on a submarine (the antenna needs to be of an exceptional size in order to achieve successful communication). Generally, ELF signals have been used to order a submarine to rise to a shallow depth where it could receive some other form of communication.\n\n===Difficulties of ELF communication===\nOne of the difficulties posed when broadcasting in the ELF frequency range is [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] size, because the length of the antenna must be at least a substantial fraction of the length of the waves. Simply put, a 3 [[hertz|Hz]] (cycle per second) signal would have a wavelength equal to the distance EM waves travel through a given medium in one third of a second. Taking account of [[refractive index]], ELF waves propagate slightly slower than the speed of light in a vacuum. As used in military applications, the wavelength is {{convert|299,792|km|abbr=on}} per second divided by 50\u201385&nbsp;Hz, which equals around {{convert|3500|to|6000|km|abbr=on}} long. This is comparable to the [[Earth]]'s diameter of around {{convert|12742|km|abbr=on}}. Because of this huge size requirement, to transmit internationally using ELF frequencies, the Earth itself forms a significant part of the antenna, and extremely long leads are necessary into the ground. Various means, such as [[electrical lengthening]], are used to construct practical radio stations with smaller sizes.\n\nThe U.S. maintained two sites, in the [[Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest]], [[Wisconsin]] and in the [[Escanaba River State Forest]], [[Michigan]] (originally named [[Project Sanguine]], then downsized and rechristened Project ELF prior to construction), until they were dismantled, beginning in late September 2004. Both sites used long [[electric power transmission|power line]]s, so-called [[ground dipole]]s, as leads. These leads were in multiple strands ranging from {{convert|22.5|to|45|km}} long. Because of the inefficiency of this method, considerable amounts of [[electric power|electrical power]] were required to operate the system.\n\n===Ecological impact===\nThere have been some concerns over the possible ecological impact of ELF signals. In 1984 a federal judge halted construction, requiring more environmental and health studies. This judgment was overruled by a federal appeals court on the basis that the [[US Navy]] claimed to have spent over $25 million studying the effects of the electromagnetic fields, with results indicating that they were similar to the effect produced by standard power distribution lines. The judgment was not accepted by everyone and, during the time that ELF was in use, some Wisconsin politicians such as Democratic Senators [[Herb Kohl]], [[Russ Feingold]] and Congressman [[Dave Obey]] called for its closure. Similar concerns have, in the past, been raised about electromagnetic radiation and health.\n\n==Other uses==\nTransmitters in the 22&nbsp;Hz range are also used in pipeline maintenance or [[pigging]]. The signal is generated as an alternating magnetic field, and the transmitter is mounted to, or to part of, the \"pig\", the cleaning device inserted into the pipe. The pig is pushed through a pipeline mostly made of metal. The ELF signal can be detected through the metal allowing its location to be detected by receivers located outside of the pipe.<ref>St\u00e9phane Sainson, ''Inspection en ligne des pipelines. Principes et m\u00e9thodes''. Ed. Lavoisier. 2007. {{ISBN|978-2743009724}}. 332 p.</ref> It is needed to check if a pig has passed a certain location and to locate a pig which has become stuck.\n\nSome radio monitoring hobbyists record ELF [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]]s using antennas ranging in size from eighteen inch active antennas up to several thousand feet in length taking advantage of fences, highway guard rails, and even decommissioned railroad tracks, and [[pitch control|play them back at higher speeds]] to more easily observe natural low frequency fluctuations in the [[Earth science#Earth's electromagnetic field|Earth's electromagnetic field]]. Increasing the playback speed increases the [[pitch (music)|pitch]], so that it can be brought into the [[audio frequency]] range for audibility.\n\n==Natural sources==\nNaturally occurring ELF waves are present on Earth, resonating in the region between [[ionosphere]] and surface seen in [[lightning]] strikes that make electrons in the atmosphere oscillate.<ref name=\"Titan ELF\">{{cite news| url=http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features/feature20070601c.cfm| title=Titan's Mysterious Radio Wave| date=1 June 2007| publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory| accessdate=2007-06-02| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603142552/http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features/feature20070601c.cfm| archivedate=3 June 2007| df=dmy-all}} Republished as \"''[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/whycassini/cassinif-20070601-02.html Casini - Unlocking Saturn's Secrets - Titan's mysterious radio wave]''\". 22 November 2007.

Titan's surface is thought to be a poor reflector of ELF waves, so the waves may instead be reflecting off the liquid-ice boundary of a subsurface ocean of water and ammonia, the existence of which is predicted by some theoretical models. Titan's ionosphere is also more complex than Earth's, with the main ionosphere at an altitude of {{convert|1200|km|abbr=on}} but with an additional layer of charged particles at {{convert|63|km|abbr=on}}.

In contrast to VLF waves, the height of the layer is much less than one wavelength at ELF frequencies, so the only mode that can propagate at ELF frequencies is the [[TEM mode]] in [[vertical polarization]], with the [[electric field]] vertical and the [[magnetic field]] horizontal.

Signals in the ELF frequency range, however, can penetrate much deeper. Two factors limit the usefulness of ELF communications channels: the low data transmission rate of a few characters per minute and, to a lesser extent, the one-way nature due to the impracticality of installing an antenna of the required size on a submarine (the antenna needs to be of an exceptional size in order to achieve successful communication). Generally, ELF signals have been used to order a submarine to rise to a shallow depth where it could receive some other form of communication.\n\n===Difficulties of ELF communication===\nOne of the difficulties posed when broadcasting in the ELF frequency range is [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] size, because the length of the antenna must be at least a substantial fraction of the length of the waves. Simply put, a 3 [[hertz|Hz]] (cycle per second) signal would have a wavelength equal to the distance EM waves travel through a given medium in one third of a second. Taking account of [[refractive index]], ELF waves propagate slightly slower than the speed of light in a vacuum. As used in military applications, the wavelength is {{convert|299,792|km|abbr=on}} per second divided by 50\u201385&nbsp;Hz, which equals around {{convert|3500|to|6000|km|abbr=on}} long. This is comparable to the [[Earth]]'s diameter of around {{convert|12742|km|abbr=on}}. Because of this huge size requirement, to transmit internationally using ELF frequencies, the Earth itself forms a significant part of the antenna, and extremely long leads are necessary into the ground. Various means, such as [[electrical lengthening]], are used to construct practical radio stations with smaller sizes.\n\nThe U.S. maintained two sites, in the [[Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest]], [[Wisconsin]] and in the [[Escanaba River State Forest]], [[Michigan]] (originally named [[Project Sanguine]], then downsized and rechristened Project ELF prior to construction), until they were dismantled, beginning in late September 2004. Both sites used long [[electric power transmission|power line]]s, so-called [[ground dipole]]s, as leads. These leads were in multiple strands ranging from {{convert|22.5|to|45|km}} long. Because of the inefficiency of this method, considerable amounts of [[electric power|electrical power]] were required to operate the system.\n\n===Ecological impact===\nThere have been some concerns over the possible ecological impact of ELF signals. In 1984 a federal judge halted construction, requiring more environmental and health studies. This judgment was overruled by a federal appeals court on the basis that the [[US Navy]] claimed to have spent over $25 million studying the effects of the electromagnetic fields, with results indicating that they were similar to the effect produced by standard power distribution lines. The judgment was not accepted by everyone and, during the time that ELF was in use, some Wisconsin politicians such as Democratic Senators [[Herb Kohl]], [[Russ Feingold]] and Congressman [[Dave Obey]] called for its closure. Similar concerns have, in the past, been raised about electromagnetic radiation and health.\n\n==Other uses==\nTransmitters in the 22&nbsp;Hz range are also used in pipeline maintenance or [[pigging]]. The signal is generated as an alternating magnetic field, and the transmitter is mounted to, or to part of, the \"pig\", the cleaning device inserted into the pipe. The pig is pushed through a pipeline mostly made of metal. The ELF signal can be detected through the metal allowing its location to be detected by receivers located outside of the pipe.<ref>St\u00e9phane Sainson, ''Inspection en ligne des pipelines. Principes et m\u00e9thodes''. Ed. Lavoisier. 2007. {{ISBN|978-2743009724}}. 332 p.</ref> It is needed to check if a pig has passed a certain location and to locate a pig which has become stuck.\n\nSome radio monitoring hobbyists record ELF [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]]s using antennas ranging in size from eighteen inch active antennas up to several thousand feet in length taking advantage of fences, highway guard rails, and even decommissioned railroad tracks, and [[pitch control|play them back at higher speeds]] to more easily observe natural low frequency fluctuations in the [[Earth science#Earth's electromagnetic field|Earth's electromagnetic field]]. Increasing the playback speed increases the [[pitch (music)|pitch]], so that it can be brought into the [[audio frequency]] range for audibility.\n\n==Natural sources==\nNaturally occurring ELF waves are present on Earth, resonating in the region between [[ionosphere]] and surface seen in [[lightning]] strikes that make electrons in the atmosphere oscillate.<ref name=\"Titan ELF\">{{cite news| url=http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features/feature20070601c.cfm| title=Titan's Mysterious Radio Wave| date=1 June 2007| publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory| accessdate=2007-06-02| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603142552/http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features/feature20070601c.cfm| archivedate=3 June 2007| df=dmy-all}} Republished as \"''[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/whycassini/cassinif-20070601-02.html Casini - Unlocking Saturn's Secrets - Titan's mysterious radio wave]''\". 22 November 2007.

Titan's surface is thought to be a poor reflector of ELF waves, so the waves may instead be reflecting off the liquid-ice boundary of a subsurface ocean of water and ammonia, the existence of which is predicted by some theoretical models.

One possibility is the influence of race-based ideas from the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries, which were based on theories of White superiority. On the other hand, Brazilian [[latifundia]]ries had been using slave manpower for centuries, with no complaints about the quality of this workforce, and there were not important changes in Brazilian economy or work processes that could justify such sudden preoccupation with the \"race\" of the labourers. Their embracing of those new identitarian ideas, moreover, proved quite flexible, even opportunist: with the slowdown of Italian immigration since 1902 and the Prinetti Decree, Japanese immigration started in 1908, with any qualms about their typically non-European origins being quickly forgotten.\n\nAn important, and usually ignored, part of this equation was the political situation in Brazil, during the final crisis of slavery. According to Petr\u00f4nio Domingues, by 1887 the slave struggles pointed to a real possibility of widespread insurrection. On October 23, in S\u00e3o Paulo, for instance, there were violent confrontations between the police and rioting Blacks, who chanted \"long live freedom\" and \"death to the slaveowners\".<ref name=Domingues>Petr\u00f4nio Domingues.

Fights were happening in daylight, guns were spotted among the fugitives, who, instead of hiding from police, seemed ready to engage in confrontation.\n\nIt was as a response to such events that, on May 13, 1888, slavery was abolished, as a means to restore order and the control of the ruling class,<ref name=Domingues/>{{rp|76}} in a situation in which the slave system was almost completely disorganised.\n\nAs an abolitionist newspaper, ''O Rebate'', put it, ten years later,\n\n<blockquote>Hadn't the slaves fled massively from the plantations, rebelling against the masters ... Hadn't they, in more than 20,000, gone to the famous ''quilombo'' of Jabaquara (out of Santos, itself a center of abolitionist agitation), and maybe they would today be still slaves ... Slavery ended because slaves no longer wanted to be slaves, because slaves rebelled against their masters and against the law that enslaved them ... The law of 13 May was nothing more than the legal recognition \u2013 so that public authority wasn't discredited \u2013 of an act that had already been accomplished by the mass revolt of slaves.<ref>O Rebate.

In this respect, what was new in \"immigration to Brazil\" was not the \"immigration\", but the \"to Brazil\" part. As Wilson do Nascimento Barbosa puts it,\n\n<blockquote>The collapse of slavery was the economic result of three conjugated movements: a) the end of the first industrial revolution (1760\u20131840) and the beginning of the so-called second industrial revolution (1880\u20131920); b) the lowering of the reproduction costs of the White man in Europe (1760\u20131860), due to the sanitary and pharmacological impact of the first industrial revolution; c) the rising costs of African Black slaves, due to the increasing reproduction costs of Black men in Africa.<ref>Wilson do Nascimento Barbosa.

While very few remained stuck with the idea of preserving slavery, some{{Who|date=April 2010}} proposed the reintegration of \"national workers\" (which was understood as including the soon-to-be former slaves) into a \"free-labour\" system; others{{Who|date=April 2010}} proposed Chinese immigration. It was against these positions, not against any imaginary African immigration, that racial arguments were made. So, besides a dispute \"immigrantists\" and \"anti-immigrantists\", there was also a debate between pro-Chinese and pro-European immigrantists; the latter also were divided between those, like Nicolau Moreira, who defended not only European immigration, but also a land reform, so to attract immigrants as small farmers, and those{{Who|date=April 2010}} who wanted immigrants as wage labourers for the plantations.\n\nIn Brazil, particularly in S\u00e3o Paulo, the dominant idea was that national workers were unable to develop the country, and that only foreign workers would be able to work in a regime of \"free\" (i.e., wage) labour. The goal was to \"whiten\" Brazil through new immigrants and through future genetic mixing in which former slaves would disappear by becoming \"whiter\".<ref>VAINFAS, Ronaldo. Dicion\u00e1rio do Brasil Imperial. Rio de Janeiro: Objetiva, 2002, p 152</ref><!--- Not really so. There are two different phases here; at first the idea - as exposed, for instance, by Nicolau Moreira - seems to be an actual displacement of non-Whites by Whites, miscegenation still understood as something detrimental to eugenics. The idea of whitening through miscegenation comes later. --->\n\nIn 1878, ten years before the abolition of slavery, [[Rio de Janeiro]] hosted the ''Congresso Agr\u00edcola'' (Agricultural Congress) and that meeting reflected what the Brazilian elite (especially coffee planters) expected from their future workers.<ref>SANTOS, Sales Augusto dos.

The ''Congresso Agr\u00edcola'' showed that the elite was convinced that Europeans were racially and culturally superior to other races.\n\nAlthough discussions were situated in a theoretical field, immigrants arrived and colonies were founded through all this period (the rule of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]]), especially from 1850 on, particularly in the [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] and [[Southern Brazil]].\n\nThese discussions culminated in the Decree 528 in 1890, signed by Brazil's first President [[Deodoro da Fonseca]], which opened the national harbors{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} to immigration except for Africans and Asians. This decree remained valid until October 5, 1892 when, due to pressures of coffee planters interested in cheap manpower, it was overturned by Law 97.<ref>Masato Ninomiya [http://www.usp.br/revistausp/28/17-massato.pdf O centen\u00e1rio do Tratado de Amizade, Com\u00e9rcio e Navega\u00e7\u00e3o entre Brasil e  Jap\u00e3o] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229002618/http://www.usp.br/revistausp/28/17-massato.pdf |date=December 29, 2013 }}. in Revista USP, December 1995/February 1996. p. 248.</ref>\n\nAs a result of those discussions and policies{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, Brazil experienced immigration mostly from countries such as Italy, Germany, Spain, [[Portugal]] and [[Poland]] during the end of the empire and the beginning of the republic period (late 19th and early 20th centuries). Later immigration, from 1908 on, was not so much influenced by that race discussions and Brazil attracted, besides Europeans, more immigrants from [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and Japan, for example{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.\n\n===Oliveira Vianna and the ideology of \"Whitening\"===\n{{See also|Racial whitening|Mongrel complex}}\nThe Brazilian government, as was commonplace at that time, endorsed positions expressed by Brazilian intellectuals. An example is a text, written by [[Oliveira Vianna]], that was issued as introductory material to 1920 Census results. Many pages of Vianna's work were dedicated to the discussion of a \"pure race\" of [[white Brazilian]]s. According to the text, written by Oliveira Vianna, the first Portuguese colonists who came to Brazil were part of the blond [[Germanic people|Germanic]] nobility that ruled Portugal, while the dark-haired \"poor\" Portuguese only came to Brazil later, in the 17th and especially the 18th century.<ref name=\"Text from the 1920 Brazilian Census\">{{cite web|url=http://biblioteca.ibge.gov.br/visualizacao/monografias/GEBIS%20-%20RJ/Censode1920/RecenGeraldoBrasil1920_v1_Introduccao.pdf|title=Text from the 1920 Brazilian Census|website=Biblioteca.ibge.gov.br|accessdate=August 21, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Reden\u00e7\u00e3o.jpg|thumb|280px|left|''A Reden\u00e7\u00e3o de Cam'' (''[[Curse of Ham|Redemption of Ham]]''), [[Modesto Brocos]], 1895, [[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes]]. The painting depicts a black grandmother, mulatta mother, white father and their [[quadroon]] child, hence three generations of [[hypergamy]] through [[racial whitening]].]]\nAccording to Oliveira Vianna, the blond Portuguese of Germanic origin were \"restless and migratory\", and that's why they emigrated to Brazil. On the other hand, the Portuguese of darker complexions were of [[Celts|Celtic]] or [[Iberians|Iberian]] origin and came when the Portuguese settlement in Brazil was already well established, because, according to him, \"The peninsular brachyoids, of [[Celts|Celtic]] race, or the dolicoides, of [[Iberians|Iberian]] race, of sedentary habits and peaceful nature, did not have, of course, that mobility nor that bellicosity nor that spirit of adventure and conquest\".<ref name=\"Text from the 1920 Brazilian Census\"/>\n\nThe text reported the different levels of [[Intelligence#Human intelligence|intelligence]] found among blacks and highlights the existence of \"lazy blacks\" (G\u00eagis and Angolans) or \"laborious blacks\" (Timinins, Minas, Dahomeyanos) and also the existence of \"peaceful and obedient blacks\" and of \"rebels and fierce\" ones. Vianna also compares the \"morality\" and intellectual level found among blacks and reports that G\u00eagis, Krumanos and Cabindas revealed the \"mental inferiority, typical from the lowest types of the black race\".<ref name=\"Text from the 1920 Brazilian Census\"/>\n\n===Gilberto Freyre's work===\n\nIn 1933, Brazilian anthropologist [[Gilberto Freyre]] published his famous book ''[[Casa-Grande & Senzala]]'' (''The Masters and the Slaves''). The book appeared at a moment when there was a widespread belief among social scientists that some [[Race (human categorization)|races]] were superior to other ones, and in the same period when the [[Nazi Party]] in Germany was on the rise. Freyre's work was very important to change the mentality, especially of the white Brazilian elite, who considered the Brazilian people as \"inferior\" because of their African and Amerindian ancestry. In this book, Freyre argued against the idea that Brazil would have an \"inferior race\" because of the race-mixing.\n\nThen, he pointed the positive elements that permeate the Brazilian cultural formation because of genetic mixing (especially between Portuguese, Indians and blacks). Freyre's book has changed the mentality in Brazil, and the mixing of races, then, became a reason to be a national pride. However, Freyre's book created the Brazilian myth of the [[Racial democracy]], so that Brazil was a \"post-racial\" country without identitarianism or desire to preserve one's European ancestry. This theory was later challenged by several anthropologists who claim that, despite the race-mixing, the white Brazilian population still occupies the top of the Brazilian society, while Blacks, Indians and mixed-race people are largely found in the poor population.\n\n==Gilberto Freyre on the criticisms that he received==\n\nThe life of [[Gilberto Freyre]], after he published ''[[Casa-Grande & Senzala]]'', became an eternal source of explanation. He repeated several times that he did not create the myth of a racial democracy and that the fact that his books recognized the intense mixing between \"races\" in Brazil did not mean a lack of prejudice or discrimination. He pointed out that many people have claimed the United States to have been an \"exemplary democracy\" whereas [[slavery]] and [[racial segregation]] were present throughout most of the history of the United States.<ref name=\"imil.org.br\">{{cite web|url=http://www.imil.org.br/artigos/a-importancia-de-gilberto-freyre-para-a-construcao-da-nacao-brasileira-parte-ii/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214200424/http://www.imil.org.br/artigos/a-importancia-de-gilberto-freyre-para-a-construcao-da-nacao-brasileira-parte-ii/|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 14, 2009|title=A import\u00e2ncia de Gilberto Freyre para a constru\u00e7\u00e3o da Na\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira \u2013 Parte II - Instituto Millenium|website=Imil.org.br|accessdate=August 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n\"The interpretation of those who want to place me among the sociologists or anthropologists who said prejudice of race among the Portuguese or the Brazilians never existed is extreme.

In the census, respondents choose their race or color in five categories: ''branca'' (white), ''parda'' (brown), ''preta'' (black), ''amarela'' (yellow) or ''ind\u00edgena'' (indigenous). The term \"parda\" needs further explanation; it has been systematically used since the census of 1940. People were then asked for their \"colour or race\"; if the answer was not \"White\", \"Black\", or \"Yellow\", interviewers were instructed to fill the \"colour or race\" box with a slash. These slashes were later summed up in the category \"pardo\". In practice this means answers such as \"[[pardo]]\", \"moreno\", \"mulato\", and \"[[caboclo]]\". In the following censuses, \"pardo\" became a category on its own, and included Amerindians,<ref name=\"Censo Demogr\u00e1fico\"/> which became a separate category only in 1991. So it describes people who have a skin darker than Whites and lighter than Blacks, but doesn't necessarily imply a White-Black mixture.\n\nTelles' second system is that of popular classification. Two IBGE surveys (the 1976 PNAD and the July 1998 PME) have sought to understand the way Brazilians think of themselves in \"racial\" terms, with the explicit aim of adjusting the census classification (neither, however, resulted in actual changes in the census). Besides that, Data Folha has also conducted research on this subject. The results of these surveys are somewhat varied, but seem to coincide in some fundamental aspects. First, there is an enormous variety of \"racial\" terms in use in Brazil; when Brazilians are inquired in an open ended question, from 135 to 500 different race-color terms may be brought. The 1976 PNAD found 136 different answers to the question about race;<ref>{{cite web | url=http://almanaque.folha.uol.com.br/racismo05.pdf | title=Brasil quer ser chamado de moreno e s\u00f3 39% se autodefinem como brancos | date=25 June 1995}}</ref> the July 1998 PME found 143.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Luiz Petrucelli\">Jos\u00e9 Luiz Petrucelli. ''A Cor Denominada''. (unavailable online).</ref>{{rp|18}} However, most of these terms are used by very small minorities. Telles remarks that 95% of the population chose only six different terms (''branco, moreno, pardo, moreno-claro, preto'' and ''negro''); Petrucelli shows that the 7 most common responses (the above plus ''amarela'') sum up 97%, and the 10 more common (the previous plus ''mulata'', ''clara'', and ''morena-escura'') make 99%.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Luiz Petrucelli\"/>{{rp|19}}\n\nPetrucelli, analysing the July 98 PME, finds that 77 denominations were mentioned by only one person in the sample. Other 12 are misunderstandings, referring to national or regional origin (''francesa, italiana, baiana, cearense''). Many of the \"racial\" terms are (or could be) remarks about the relation between skin colour and exposure to sun (''amorenada, bem morena, branca-morena, branca-queimada, corada, bronzeada, meio morena, morena-bronzeada, morena-trigueira, morenada, moren\u00e3o, moreninha, pouco morena, queimada, queimada de sol, tostada, rosa queimada, tostada''). Others are clearly variations of the same idea (''preto, negro, escuro, crioulo, retinto'', for Black, ''alva, clara, cor-de-leite, galega, rosa, rosada, p\u00e1lida'', for White, ''parda, mulata, mesti\u00e7a, mista'', for \"parda\"), or precisions of the same concept (''branca morena, branca clara''), and can actually grouped together with one of the main racial terms without falsifying the interpretation.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Luiz Petrucelli\"/>{{rp|19}} Some seem to express an outright refusal of classification: ''azul-marinho'' (navy blue), ''azul'' (blue), ''verde'' (green), ''cor-de-burro-quando-foge'' (literally, \"the color of a donkey that has run away\", a humorous [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] term for a color that cannot be determined).\n\nPetrucelli grouped those 136 terms into 28 wider categories.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Luiz Petrucelli\"/>{{rp|47}} Most of these 28 wider categories can be situated in the White-Black continuum when the answers to the open-ended question are compared to the answers in the IBGE format:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Category||Frequency||White||Brown||Black||Amerindian||Yellow||Total||difference between White and Black\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|branca (White)||54.28%||98.96%||0.73%||0.11%||0.07%||0.14%||100.00%||98,85\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|loira (Blonde)||0.05%||95.24%||0.00%||4.76%||0.00%||0.00%||100.00%||90,48\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|brasileira (Brazilian)||0.12%||91.20%||6.05%||2.27%||0.00%||0.47%||100.00%||88,93\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|branca + (adjectivated White)||0.14%||86.47%||9.62%||0.00%||3.91%||0.00%||100.00%||86,47\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|clara (of light colour)||0.78%||86.40%||11.93%||0.35%||0.14%||1.18%||100.00%||86,05\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|galega (Galician)||0.01%||70.99%||19.78%||0.00%||0.00%||9.23%||100.00%||70,99\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|castanha (Brown)||0.01%||63.81%||36.19%||0.00%||0.00%||0.00%||100.00%||63,81\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|morena clara (light ''Morena'')||2.92%||38.35%||57.12%||1.46%||2.27%||0.81%||100.00%||36,89\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|jambo||0.02%||14.47%||77.96%||2.39%||5.18%||0.00%||100.00%||12,08\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|morena||20.89%||13.75%||76.97%||6.27%||2.62%||0.38%||100.00%||7,48\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|mesti\u00e7a, mista (miscegenated, mixed)||0.08%||17.29%||59.44%||14.96%||7.60%||0.70%||100.00%||2,33\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|parda (Brown)||10.40%||1.03%||97.25%||1.40%||0.21%||0.10%||100.00%||\u22120,37\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|sarar\u00e1||0.04%||9.09%||60.14%||23.25%||0.00%||7.53%||100.00%||\u221214,16\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|canela (of the colour of cinnamon)||0.01%||11.13%||57.55%||26.45%||4.87%||0.00%||100.00%||\u221215,32\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|mulata (Mulatto)||0.81%||1.85%||71.53%||25.26%||1.37%||0.00%||100.00%||\u221223,41\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|marrom, chocolate (Brown, chocolate)||0.03%||4.56%||57.30%||38.14%||0.00%||0.00%||100.00%||\u221233,58\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|morena escura (dark ''Morena'')||0.45%||2.77%||54.80%||38.05%||4.15%||0.24%||100.00%||\u221235,28\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|escura (of dark colour)||0.38%||0.59%||16.32%||81.67%||1.42%||0.00%||100.00%||\u221281,08\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|negra (Black)||3.14%||0.33%||6.54%||92.62%||0.50%||0.02%||100.00%||\u221292,29\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|preta (Black)||4.26%||0.37%||1.73%||97.66%||0.17%||0.06%||100.00%||\u221297,29\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|-\n|}\n\nThe other categories, except, naturally, for \"amarela\" (Yellow) seem related to Amerindian \"race\":\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Category ||Frequency|| White || Brown || Black || Amerindian || Yellow ||Total\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|vermelha (Red)||0.02%||58,97||8,22||0,00||21,56||11,24||100,00\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|cafusa||0.01%||6,02||65,14||22,82||6,02||0,00||100,00\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|caboverde (Capeverdian)||0.02%||0,00||48,72||23,08||28,21||0,00||100,00\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|cabocla||0.02%||3,60||49,37||10,43||36,60||0,00||100,00\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|bugre (Indian)||0.00%||12,50||37,50||0,00||50,00||0,00||100,00\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|amarela (Yellow)||1.11%||3,27||0,98||0,24||0,15||95,36||100,00\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|ind\u00edgena (Indigenous)||0.13%||0,44||2,12||0,00||96,13||1,30||100,00\n|-\n|}\n\nThe remarkable difference of the popular system is the use of the term \"moreno\".

It is commonplace to say that, in Brazil, \"money whitens\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=The concept and measurement of race and their relationship to public health: a review focused on Brazil and the United States|first1=Claudia|last1=Travassos|first2=David R.|last2=Williams|date=June 1, 2004|journal=Cadernos de Sa\u00fade P\u00fablica|volume=20|issue=3|pages=660\u2013678|doi=10.1590/S0102-311X2004000300003|pmid=15263977|doi-access=free}}</ref> There is a persistent belief, both in academy and popularly, that Brazilians from the wealthier classes with darker phenotypes tend to see themselves and be seen by others in lighter categories. Other things, such as dressing and social status, also influence perceptions of race.\n\nHowever, some studies, focusing in the difference between self- and alter-classification show that this phenomenon is far more complex than \"money whitens\". For instance, according to a study conducted by Paula Miranda-Ribeiro and Andr\u00e9 Junqueira Caetano among women in Recife, while there is significant inconsistency between the \"parda\" and \"preta\" categories, most women are consistently classified by themselves and interviewers into \"brancas\" and non-brancas. 21.97% of women were consistently classified as White, and 55.13% of women were consistently classified as non-White, while 22.89% of women where inconsistently classified. But the inconsistently classified women reveal an important aspect of economic \"whitening\". \"Self-darkening\" women, i.e., those who view themselves as \"pretas\" or \"pardas\" but are classified as \"brancas\" by the interviewers (4.08% of women) have above average education, while the 18.82% \"self-whitening\" women have a low average education, lower indeed than that of consistently non-White women.<ref name=\"Como eu me vejo e como ela me v\u00ea\">Paula Miranda-Ribeiro and Andr\u00e9 Junqueira Caetano. [http://www.cedeplar.ufmg.br/pesquisas/td/TD%20250.pdf Como eu me vejo e como ela me v\u00ea]. pp. 12\u201313</ref>\n\nThis, assuming, that there is a correlation between wealth and education,<ref name=\"Como eu me vejo e como ela me v\u00ea\"/> would show that, rather than \"Brazilians from the wealthier classes with darker phenotypes seeing themselves and being seen by others in lighter categories\", either wealth affects their perception by others, but does not affect, or at least affects considerably less, their self-perception, or that wealth in fact affects their self-perception in the opposite way: it is poor people who are more prone to self-whitening. This, naturally, contributes to show that self-classification in censuses is in fact more objective than alter-classification; but most importantly, it shows that economic differences between Whites and non-Whites effectively exist.\n\nIt is important to notice that the alter-classification in this survey was made by a group of college students, i.e., mostly middle-class people.\n\nThere are important differences in social position concerning \"races\". These differences encompass income, education, housing, etc. According to the 2007 PNAD, White workers wages were almost twice those of Blacks and \"pardos\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Blacks and \"pardos\" earned on average 1.8 minimum wages, while Whites averaged 3.4 minimum wages.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} These differences cannot be exclusively attributed to differences in education: among workers with over 12 years of study, Whites earned on average R$15.90 per hour, while Blacks and \"pardos\" made R$11.40.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nIn 2000, the illiteracy rate among White people over 5 years old was 10.87%; among Blacks, 23.23%, and among \"pardos\", 21.09%.<ref>IBGE.

The blacks and browns earned on average 1.8 [[minimum wages]], while the whites had a yield of 3.4 minimum wages. Among workers with over 12 years of study, the difference was also large. While the whites earned on average [[Brazilian real|R$]]15.90 per hour, the blacks and browns received R$11.40, when they worked the same period. Among the 1% richest population of Brazil, only 12% were blacks and browns, while whites constituted 86.3% of the group.

Brazilian population is characterized by a genetic background of three parental populations (European, African, and Brazilian Native Amerindians) with a wide degree and diverse patterns of admixture. In this work we analyzed the information content of 28 ancestry-informative SNPs into multiplexed panels using three parental population sources (African, Amerindian, and European) to infer the genetic admixture in an urban sample of the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. The SNPs assigned apart the parental populations from each other and thus can be applied for ancestry estimation in a three hybrid admixed population. Data was used to infer genetic ancestry in Brazilians with an admixture model. Pairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085).

In 1824 they established [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]], a German community. Major Schaeffer, a German who was living in Brazil, was sent to Germany in order to bring immigrants. From [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], the Major brought the immigrants and soldiers. Settlers from Germany were brought to work as small farmers, because there were many land holdings without workers. To attract the immigrants, the Brazilian government had promised large tracts of land, where they could settle with their families and colonize the region. The first years were not easy. Many Germans died of tropical disease, while others left the colonies to find better living conditions. The German colony of S\u00e3o Leopoldo was a disaster. Nevertheless, in the following years, a further 4,830 Germans arrived at S\u00e3o Leopoldo, and then the colony started to develop, with the immigrants establishing the town of [[Novo Hamburgo]] (''New Hamburg''). From S\u00e3o Leopoldo and Novo Hamburgo, the German immigrants spread into others areas of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], mainly close to sources of rivers. The whole region of Vale dos Sinos was populated by Germans. During the 1830s and part of the 1840s German immigration to Brazil was interrupted due to conflicts in the country ([[Ragamuffin War]]). The immigration restarted after 1845 with the creation of new colonies. The most important ones were [[Blumenau]], in 1850, and [[Joinville]] in 1851, both in [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina state]]; these attracted thousands of German immigrants to the region.\nIn the next five decades, other 28 thousand Germans were brought to Rio Grande do Sul to work as small farmers in the countryside.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mre.gov.br/CDBRASIL/ITAMARATY/WEB/ingles/consnac/imigra/alemaes/index.htm|title=Germans|website=Mre.gov.br|accessdate=August 21, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716191844/http://www.mre.gov.br/CDBRASIL/ITAMARATY/WEB/ingles/consnac/imigra/alemaes/index.htm|archivedate=July 16, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> By 1914 it is estimated that 50 thousand Germans settled in this state.\n\nAnother immigration boom to this region started in 1875. Communities with Italian immigrants were also created in southern Brazil. The first colonies to be populated by Italians were created in the highlands of Rio Grande do Sul ([[Serra Ga\u00facha]]). These were [[Garibaldi (city)|Garibaldi]] and [[Bento Gon\u00e7alves, Rio Grande do Sul|Bento Gon\u00e7alves]]. These immigrants were predominantly from [[Veneto]], in northern Italy. After five years, in 1880, the great numbers of Italian immigrants arriving caused the Brazilian government to create another Italian colony, [[Caxias do Sul]]. After initially settling in the government-promoted colonies, many of the Italian immigrants spread themselves into other areas of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] seeking further opportunities. They created many other Italian colonies on their own, mainly in highlands, because the lowlands were already populated by Germans and native ''ga\u00fachos''. The Italian established many vineyards in the region. Nowadays, the wine produced in these areas of Italian colonization in southern Brazil is much appreciated within the country, though little is available for export. In 1875, the first Italian colonies were established in [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], which lies immediately to the north of Rio Grande do Sul. The colonies gave rise to towns such as [[Crici\u00fama]], and later also spread further north, to [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]].\n\nA significant number of [[Poles]] have settled in Southern Brazil. The first immigrants arrived in 1869. From 1872 to 1959, 110,243 \"Russian\" citizens entered Brazil. In fact, the majority of them were Poles, since Poland was under Russian rule until 1917, and ethnic Poles immigrated with Russian passports.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/anais/pdf/2000/Todos/Uma%20Hist%C3%B3ria%20Oculta%20a%20Imigra%C3%A7ao%20dos%20Pa%C3%ADses....pdf |title=Uma hist\u00f3ria oculta: a imigra\u00e7\u00e3o dos pa\u00edses da Europa do Centro-Leste para o Brasil |accessdate=2009-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225173649/http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/anais/pdf/2000/Todos/Uma%20Hist%C3%B3ria%20Oculta%20a%20Imigra%C3%A7ao%20dos%20Pa%C3%ADses....pdf |archivedate=February 25, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Southeast===\nThe [[Southeastern Brazil|Southeastern region]] of Brazil is the ethnically most diverse part of the country.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nSoutheast Brazil is home to the oldest Portuguese settlement in the Americas, [[S\u00e3o Vicente, S\u00e3o Paulo]], established in 1532.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rankbrasil.com.br/maismais/turismo/saovicente/default.asp|title=RankBrasil - Recordes Brasileiros|first=Luciano|last=Cadari|website=Rankbrasil.com.br|accessdate=August 21, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224114234/http://www.rankbrasil.com.br/maismais/turismo/saovicente/default.asp|archivedate=December 24, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The region, since the beginning of its colonization, is a [[melting pot]] of Whites, Indians and Blacks.

Many workers were attracted to the region, mostly from northeastern Brazil.\n\nA new migratory movement started arriving from the 1970s.

One possibility is the influence of race-based ideas from the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries, which were based on theories of White superiority. On the other hand, Brazilian [[latifundia]]ries had been using slave manpower for centuries, with no complaints about the quality of this workforce, and there were not important changes in Brazilian economy or work processes that could justify such sudden preoccupation with the \"race\" of the labourers. Their embracing of those new identitarian ideas, moreover, proved quite flexible, even opportunist: with the slowdown of Italian immigration since 1902 and the Prinetti Decree, Japanese immigration started in 1908, with any qualms about their typically non-European origins being quickly forgotten.\n\nAn important, and usually ignored, part of this equation was the political situation in Brazil, during the final crisis of slavery. According to Petr\u00f4nio Domingues, by 1887 the slave struggles pointed to a real possibility of widespread insurrection. On October 23, in S\u00e3o Paulo, for instance, there were violent confrontations between the police and rioting Blacks, who chanted \"long live freedom\" and \"death to the slaveowners\".<ref name=Domingues>Petr\u00f4nio Domingues.

Fights were happening in daylight, guns were spotted among the fugitives, who, instead of hiding from police, seemed ready to engage in confrontation.\n\nIt was as a response to such events that, on May 13, 1888, slavery was abolished, as a means to restore order and the control of the ruling class,<ref name=Domingues/>{{rp|76}} in a situation in which the slave system was almost completely disorganised.\n\nAs an abolitionist newspaper, ''O Rebate'', put it, ten years later,\n\n<blockquote>Hadn't the slaves fled massively from the plantations, rebelling against the masters ... Hadn't they, in more than 20,000, gone to the famous ''quilombo'' of Jabaquara (out of Santos, itself a center of abolitionist agitation), and maybe they would today be still slaves ... Slavery ended because slaves no longer wanted to be slaves, because slaves rebelled against their masters and against the law that enslaved them ... The law of 13 May was nothing more than the legal recognition \u2013 so that public authority wasn't discredited \u2013 of an act that had already been accomplished by the mass revolt of slaves.<ref>O Rebate.

In this respect, what was new in \"immigration to Brazil\" was not the \"immigration\", but the \"to Brazil\" part. As Wilson do Nascimento Barbosa puts it,\n\n<blockquote>The collapse of slavery was the economic result of three conjugated movements: a) the end of the first industrial revolution (1760\u20131840) and the beginning of the so-called second industrial revolution (1880\u20131920); b) the lowering of the reproduction costs of the White man in Europe (1760\u20131860), due to the sanitary and pharmacological impact of the first industrial revolution; c) the rising costs of African Black slaves, due to the increasing reproduction costs of Black men in Africa.<ref>Wilson do Nascimento Barbosa.

While very few remained stuck with the idea of preserving slavery, some{{Who|date=April 2010}} proposed the reintegration of \"national workers\" (which was understood as including the soon-to-be former slaves) into a \"free-labour\" system; others{{Who|date=April 2010}} proposed Chinese immigration. It was against these positions, not against any imaginary African immigration, that racial arguments were made. So, besides a dispute \"immigrantists\" and \"anti-immigrantists\", there was also a debate between pro-Chinese and pro-European immigrantists; the latter also were divided between those, like Nicolau Moreira, who defended not only European immigration, but also a land reform, so to attract immigrants as small farmers, and those{{Who|date=April 2010}} who wanted immigrants as wage labourers for the plantations.\n\nIn Brazil, particularly in S\u00e3o Paulo, the dominant idea was that national workers were unable to develop the country, and that only foreign workers would be able to work in a regime of \"free\" (i.e., wage) labour. The goal was to \"whiten\" Brazil through new immigrants and through future genetic mixing in which former slaves would disappear by becoming \"whiter\".<ref>VAINFAS, Ronaldo. Dicion\u00e1rio do Brasil Imperial. Rio de Janeiro: Objetiva, 2002, p 152</ref><!--- Not really so. There are two different phases here; at first the idea - as exposed, for instance, by Nicolau Moreira - seems to be an actual displacement of non-Whites by Whites, miscegenation still understood as something detrimental to eugenics. The idea of whitening through miscegenation comes later. --->\n\nIn 1878, ten years before the abolition of slavery, [[Rio de Janeiro]] hosted the ''Congresso Agr\u00edcola'' (Agricultural Congress) and that meeting reflected what the Brazilian elite (especially coffee planters) expected from their future workers.<ref>SANTOS, Sales Augusto dos.

The ''Congresso Agr\u00edcola'' showed that the elite was convinced that Europeans were racially and culturally superior to other races.\n\nAlthough discussions were situated in a theoretical field, immigrants arrived and colonies were founded through all this period (the rule of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]]), especially from 1850 on, particularly in the [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] and [[Southern Brazil]].\n\nThese discussions culminated in the Decree 528 in 1890, signed by Brazil's first President [[Deodoro da Fonseca]], which opened the national harbors{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} to immigration except for Africans and Asians. This decree remained valid until October 5, 1892 when, due to pressures of coffee planters interested in cheap manpower, it was overturned by Law 97.<ref>Masato Ninomiya [http://www.usp.br/revistausp/28/17-massato.pdf O centen\u00e1rio do Tratado de Amizade, Com\u00e9rcio e Navega\u00e7\u00e3o entre Brasil e  Jap\u00e3o] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229002618/http://www.usp.br/revistausp/28/17-massato.pdf |date=December 29, 2013 }}. in Revista USP, December 1995/February 1996. p. 248.</ref>\n\nAs a result of those discussions and policies{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, Brazil experienced immigration mostly from countries such as Italy, Germany, Spain, [[Portugal]] and [[Poland]] during the end of the empire and the beginning of the republic period (late 19th and early 20th centuries). Later immigration, from 1908 on, was not so much influenced by that race discussions and Brazil attracted, besides Europeans, more immigrants from [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and Japan, for example{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.\n\n===Oliveira Vianna and the ideology of \"Whitening\"===\n{{See also|Racial whitening|Mongrel complex}}\nThe Brazilian government, as was commonplace at that time, endorsed positions expressed by Brazilian intellectuals. An example is a text, written by [[Oliveira Vianna]], that was issued as introductory material to 1920 Census results. Many pages of Vianna's work were dedicated to the discussion of a \"pure race\" of [[white Brazilian]]s. According to the text, written by Oliveira Vianna, the first Portuguese colonists who came to Brazil were part of the blond [[Germanic people|Germanic]] nobility that ruled Portugal, while the dark-haired \"poor\" Portuguese only came to Brazil later, in the 17th and especially the 18th century.<ref name=\"Text from the 1920 Brazilian Census\">{{cite web|url=http://biblioteca.ibge.gov.br/visualizacao/monografias/GEBIS%20-%20RJ/Censode1920/RecenGeraldoBrasil1920_v1_Introduccao.pdf|title=Text from the 1920 Brazilian Census|website=Biblioteca.ibge.gov.br|accessdate=August 21, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Reden\u00e7\u00e3o.jpg|thumb|280px|left|''A Reden\u00e7\u00e3o de Cam'' (''[[Curse of Ham|Redemption of Ham]]''), [[Modesto Brocos]], 1895, [[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes]]. The painting depicts a black grandmother, mulatta mother, white father and their [[quadroon]] child, hence three generations of [[hypergamy]] through [[racial whitening]].]]\nAccording to Oliveira Vianna, the blond Portuguese of Germanic origin were \"restless and migratory\", and that's why they emigrated to Brazil. On the other hand, the Portuguese of darker complexions were of [[Celts|Celtic]] or [[Iberians|Iberian]] origin and came when the Portuguese settlement in Brazil was already well established, because, according to him, \"The peninsular brachyoids, of [[Celts|Celtic]] race, or the dolicoides, of [[Iberians|Iberian]] race, of sedentary habits and peaceful nature, did not have, of course, that mobility nor that bellicosity nor that spirit of adventure and conquest\".<ref name=\"Text from the 1920 Brazilian Census\"/>\n\nThe text reported the different levels of [[Intelligence#Human intelligence|intelligence]] found among blacks and highlights the existence of \"lazy blacks\" (G\u00eagis and Angolans) or \"laborious blacks\" (Timinins, Minas, Dahomeyanos) and also the existence of \"peaceful and obedient blacks\" and of \"rebels and fierce\" ones. Vianna also compares the \"morality\" and intellectual level found among blacks and reports that G\u00eagis, Krumanos and Cabindas revealed the \"mental inferiority, typical from the lowest types of the black race\".<ref name=\"Text from the 1920 Brazilian Census\"/>\n\n===Gilberto Freyre's work===\n\nIn 1933, Brazilian anthropologist [[Gilberto Freyre]] published his famous book ''[[Casa-Grande & Senzala]]'' (''The Masters and the Slaves''). The book appeared at a moment when there was a widespread belief among social scientists that some [[Race (human categorization)|races]] were superior to other ones, and in the same period when the [[Nazi Party]] in Germany was on the rise. Freyre's work was very important to change the mentality, especially of the white Brazilian elite, who considered the Brazilian people as \"inferior\" because of their African and Amerindian ancestry. In this book, Freyre argued against the idea that Brazil would have an \"inferior race\" because of the race-mixing.\n\nThen, he pointed the positive elements that permeate the Brazilian cultural formation because of genetic mixing (especially between Portuguese, Indians and blacks). Freyre's book has changed the mentality in Brazil, and the mixing of races, then, became a reason to be a national pride. However, Freyre's book created the Brazilian myth of the [[Racial democracy]], so that Brazil was a \"post-racial\" country without identitarianism or desire to preserve one's European ancestry. This theory was later challenged by several anthropologists who claim that, despite the race-mixing, the white Brazilian population still occupies the top of the Brazilian society, while Blacks, Indians and mixed-race people are largely found in the poor population.\n\n==Gilberto Freyre on the criticisms that he received==\n\nThe life of [[Gilberto Freyre]], after he published ''[[Casa-Grande & Senzala]]'', became an eternal source of explanation. He repeated several times that he did not create the myth of a racial democracy and that the fact that his books recognized the intense mixing between \"races\" in Brazil did not mean a lack of prejudice or discrimination. He pointed out that many people have claimed the United States to have been an \"exemplary democracy\" whereas [[slavery]] and [[racial segregation]] were present throughout most of the history of the United States.<ref name=\"imil.org.br\">{{cite web|url=http://www.imil.org.br/artigos/a-importancia-de-gilberto-freyre-para-a-construcao-da-nacao-brasileira-parte-ii/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214200424/http://www.imil.org.br/artigos/a-importancia-de-gilberto-freyre-para-a-construcao-da-nacao-brasileira-parte-ii/|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 14, 2009|title=A import\u00e2ncia de Gilberto Freyre para a constru\u00e7\u00e3o da Na\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira \u2013 Parte II - Instituto Millenium|website=Imil.org.br|accessdate=August 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n\"The interpretation of those who want to place me among the sociologists or anthropologists who said prejudice of race among the Portuguese or the Brazilians never existed is extreme.

In the census, respondents choose their race or color in five categories: ''branca'' (white), ''parda'' (brown), ''preta'' (black), ''amarela'' (yellow) or ''ind\u00edgena'' (indigenous). The term \"parda\" needs further explanation; it has been systematically used since the census of 1940. People were then asked for their \"colour or race\"; if the answer was not \"White\", \"Black\", or \"Yellow\", interviewers were instructed to fill the \"colour or race\" box with a slash. These slashes were later summed up in the category \"pardo\". In practice this means answers such as \"[[pardo]]\", \"moreno\", \"mulato\", and \"[[caboclo]]\". In the following censuses, \"pardo\" became a category on its own, and included Amerindians,<ref name=\"Censo Demogr\u00e1fico\"/> which became a separate category only in 1991. So it describes people who have a skin darker than Whites and lighter than Blacks, but doesn't necessarily imply a White-Black mixture.\n\nTelles' second system is that of popular classification. Two IBGE surveys (the 1976 PNAD and the July 1998 PME) have sought to understand the way Brazilians think of themselves in \"racial\" terms, with the explicit aim of adjusting the census classification (neither, however, resulted in actual changes in the census). Besides that, Data Folha has also conducted research on this subject. The results of these surveys are somewhat varied, but seem to coincide in some fundamental aspects. First, there is an enormous variety of \"racial\" terms in use in Brazil; when Brazilians are inquired in an open ended question, from 135 to 500 different race-color terms may be brought. The 1976 PNAD found 136 different answers to the question about race;<ref>{{cite web | url=http://almanaque.folha.uol.com.br/racismo05.pdf | title=Brasil quer ser chamado de moreno e s\u00f3 39% se autodefinem como brancos | date=25 June 1995}}</ref> the July 1998 PME found 143.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Luiz Petrucelli\">Jos\u00e9 Luiz Petrucelli. ''A Cor Denominada''. (unavailable online).</ref>{{rp|18}} However, most of these terms are used by very small minorities. Telles remarks that 95% of the population chose only six different terms (''branco, moreno, pardo, moreno-claro, preto'' and ''negro''); Petrucelli shows that the 7 most common responses (the above plus ''amarela'') sum up 97%, and the 10 more common (the previous plus ''mulata'', ''clara'', and ''morena-escura'') make 99%.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Luiz Petrucelli\"/>{{rp|19}}\n\nPetrucelli, analysing the July 98 PME, finds that 77 denominations were mentioned by only one person in the sample. Other 12 are misunderstandings, referring to national or regional origin (''francesa, italiana, baiana, cearense''). Many of the \"racial\" terms are (or could be) remarks about the relation between skin colour and exposure to sun (''amorenada, bem morena, branca-morena, branca-queimada, corada, bronzeada, meio morena, morena-bronzeada, morena-trigueira, morenada, moren\u00e3o, moreninha, pouco morena, queimada, queimada de sol, tostada, rosa queimada, tostada''). Others are clearly variations of the same idea (''preto, negro, escuro, crioulo, retinto'', for Black, ''alva, clara, cor-de-leite, galega, rosa, rosada, p\u00e1lida'', for White, ''parda, mulata, mesti\u00e7a, mista'', for \"parda\"), or precisions of the same concept (''branca morena, branca clara''), and can actually grouped together with one of the main racial terms without falsifying the interpretation.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Luiz Petrucelli\"/>{{rp|19}} Some seem to express an outright refusal of classification: ''azul-marinho'' (navy blue), ''azul'' (blue), ''verde'' (green), ''cor-de-burro-quando-foge'' (literally, \"the color of a donkey that has run away\", a humorous [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] term for a color that cannot be determined).\n\nPetrucelli grouped those 136 terms into 28 wider categories.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Luiz Petrucelli\"/>{{rp|47}} Most of these 28 wider categories can be situated in the White-Black continuum when the answers to the open-ended question are compared to the answers in the IBGE format:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Category||Frequency||White||Brown||Black||Amerindian||Yellow||Total||difference between White and Black\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|branca (White)||54.28%||98.96%||0.73%||0.11%||0.07%||0.14%||100.00%||98,85\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|loira (Blonde)||0.05%||95.24%||0.00%||4.76%||0.00%||0.00%||100.00%||90,48\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|brasileira (Brazilian)||0.12%||91.20%||6.05%||2.27%||0.00%||0.47%||100.00%||88,93\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|branca + (adjectivated White)||0.14%||86.47%||9.62%||0.00%||3.91%||0.00%||100.00%||86,47\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|clara (of light colour)||0.78%||86.40%||11.93%||0.35%||0.14%||1.18%||100.00%||86,05\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|galega (Galician)||0.01%||70.99%||19.78%||0.00%||0.00%||9.23%||100.00%||70,99\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|castanha (Brown)||0.01%||63.81%||36.19%||0.00%||0.00%||0.00%||100.00%||63,81\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|morena clara (light ''Morena'')||2.92%||38.35%||57.12%||1.46%||2.27%||0.81%||100.00%||36,89\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|jambo||0.02%||14.47%||77.96%||2.39%||5.18%||0.00%||100.00%||12,08\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|morena||20.89%||13.75%||76.97%||6.27%||2.62%||0.38%||100.00%||7,48\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|mesti\u00e7a, mista (miscegenated, mixed)||0.08%||17.29%||59.44%||14.96%||7.60%||0.70%||100.00%||2,33\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|parda (Brown)||10.40%||1.03%||97.25%||1.40%||0.21%||0.10%||100.00%||\u22120,37\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|sarar\u00e1||0.04%||9.09%||60.14%||23.25%||0.00%||7.53%||100.00%||\u221214,16\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|canela (of the colour of cinnamon)||0.01%||11.13%||57.55%||26.45%||4.87%||0.00%||100.00%||\u221215,32\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|mulata (Mulatto)||0.81%||1.85%||71.53%||25.26%||1.37%||0.00%||100.00%||\u221223,41\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|marrom, chocolate (Brown, chocolate)||0.03%||4.56%||57.30%||38.14%||0.00%||0.00%||100.00%||\u221233,58\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|morena escura (dark ''Morena'')||0.45%||2.77%||54.80%||38.05%||4.15%||0.24%||100.00%||\u221235,28\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|escura (of dark colour)||0.38%||0.59%||16.32%||81.67%||1.42%||0.00%||100.00%||\u221281,08\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|negra (Black)||3.14%||0.33%||6.54%||92.62%||0.50%||0.02%||100.00%||\u221292,29\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|preta (Black)||4.26%||0.37%||1.73%||97.66%||0.17%||0.06%||100.00%||\u221297,29\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|-\n|}\n\nThe other categories, except, naturally, for \"amarela\" (Yellow) seem related to Amerindian \"race\":\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Category ||Frequency|| White || Brown || Black || Amerindian || Yellow ||Total\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|vermelha (Red)||0.02%||58,97||8,22||0,00||21,56||11,24||100,00\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|cafusa||0.01%||6,02||65,14||22,82||6,02||0,00||100,00\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|caboverde (Capeverdian)||0.02%||0,00||48,72||23,08||28,21||0,00||100,00\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|cabocla||0.02%||3,60||49,37||10,43||36,60||0,00||100,00\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|bugre (Indian)||0.00%||12,50||37,50||0,00||50,00||0,00||100,00\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|amarela (Yellow)||1.11%||3,27||0,98||0,24||0,15||95,36||100,00\n|-align=\"right\u201d\n|ind\u00edgena (Indigenous)||0.13%||0,44||2,12||0,00||96,13||1,30||100,00\n|-\n|}\n\nThe remarkable difference of the popular system is the use of the term \"moreno\".

It is commonplace to say that, in Brazil, \"money whitens\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=The concept and measurement of race and their relationship to public health: a review focused on Brazil and the United States|first1=Claudia|last1=Travassos|first2=David R.|last2=Williams|date=June 1, 2004|journal=Cadernos de Sa\u00fade P\u00fablica|volume=20|issue=3|pages=660\u2013678|doi=10.1590/S0102-311X2004000300003|pmid=15263977|doi-access=free}}</ref> There is a persistent belief, both in academy and popularly, that Brazilians from the wealthier classes with darker phenotypes tend to see themselves and be seen by others in lighter categories. Other things, such as dressing and social status, also influence perceptions of race.\n\nHowever, some studies, focusing in the difference between self- and alter-classification show that this phenomenon is far more complex than \"money whitens\". For instance, according to a study conducted by Paula Miranda-Ribeiro and Andr\u00e9 Junqueira Caetano among women in Recife, while there is significant inconsistency between the \"parda\" and \"preta\" categories, most women are consistently classified by themselves and interviewers into \"brancas\" and non-brancas. 21.97% of women were consistently classified as White, and 55.13% of women were consistently classified as non-White, while 22.89% of women where inconsistently classified. But the inconsistently classified women reveal an important aspect of economic \"whitening\". \"Self-darkening\" women, i.e., those who view themselves as \"pretas\" or \"pardas\" but are classified as \"brancas\" by the interviewers (4.08% of women) have above average education, while the 18.82% \"self-whitening\" women have a low average education, lower indeed than that of consistently non-White women.<ref name=\"Como eu me vejo e como ela me v\u00ea\">Paula Miranda-Ribeiro and Andr\u00e9 Junqueira Caetano. [http://www.cedeplar.ufmg.br/pesquisas/td/TD%20250.pdf Como eu me vejo e como ela me v\u00ea]. pp. 12\u201313</ref>\n\nThis, assuming, that there is a correlation between wealth and education,<ref name=\"Como eu me vejo e como ela me v\u00ea\"/> would show that, rather than \"Brazilians from the wealthier classes with darker phenotypes seeing themselves and being seen by others in lighter categories\", either wealth affects their perception by others, but does not affect, or at least affects considerably less, their self-perception, or that wealth in fact affects their self-perception in the opposite way: it is poor people who are more prone to self-whitening. This, naturally, contributes to show that self-classification in censuses is in fact more objective than alter-classification; but most importantly, it shows that economic differences between Whites and non-Whites effectively exist.\n\nIt is important to notice that the alter-classification in this survey was made by a group of college students, i.e., mostly middle-class people.\n\nThere are important differences in social position concerning \"races\". These differences encompass income, education, housing, etc. According to the 2007 PNAD, White workers wages were almost twice those of Blacks and \"pardos\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Blacks and \"pardos\" earned on average 1.8 minimum wages, while Whites averaged 3.4 minimum wages.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} These differences cannot be exclusively attributed to differences in education: among workers with over 12 years of study, Whites earned on average R$15.90 per hour, while Blacks and \"pardos\" made R$11.40.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nIn 2000, the illiteracy rate among White people over 5 years old was 10.87%; among Blacks, 23.23%, and among \"pardos\", 21.09%.<ref>IBGE.

The blacks and browns earned on average 1.8 [[minimum wages]], while the whites had a yield of 3.4 minimum wages. Among workers with over 12 years of study, the difference was also large. While the whites earned on average [[Brazilian real|R$]]15.90 per hour, the blacks and browns received R$11.40, when they worked the same period. Among the 1% richest population of Brazil, only 12% were blacks and browns, while whites constituted 86.3% of the group.

Brazilian population is characterized by a genetic background of three parental populations (European, African, and Brazilian Native Amerindians) with a wide degree and diverse patterns of admixture. In this work we analyzed the information content of 28 ancestry-informative SNPs into multiplexed panels using three parental population sources (African, Amerindian, and European) to infer the genetic admixture in an urban sample of the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. The SNPs assigned apart the parental populations from each other and thus can be applied for ancestry estimation in a three hybrid admixed population. Data was used to infer genetic ancestry in Brazilians with an admixture model. Pairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085).

Between 1748 and 1756, six thousand [[Azorean people|Azoreans]] moved to the coast of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]. They were mainly newly married who were seeking a better life. At that time, the Azores were one of the poorest regions of Portugal. They established themselves mainly in the [[Santa Catarina Island]], nowadays the region of Bigua\u00e7u. Later, some couples moved to [[Rio Grande do Sul]], where they established [[Porto Alegre]], the capital. The Azoreans lived on fishing and agriculture, especially flour.

In 1824 they established [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]], a German community. Major Schaeffer, a German who was living in Brazil, was sent to Germany in order to bring immigrants. From [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], the Major brought the immigrants and soldiers. Settlers from Germany were brought to work as small farmers, because there were many land holdings without workers. To attract the immigrants, the Brazilian government had promised large tracts of land, where they could settle with their families and colonize the region. The first years were not easy. Many Germans died of tropical disease, while others left the colonies to find better living conditions. The German colony of S\u00e3o Leopoldo was a disaster. Nevertheless, in the following years, a further 4,830 Germans arrived at S\u00e3o Leopoldo, and then the colony started to develop, with the immigrants establishing the town of [[Novo Hamburgo]] (''New Hamburg''). From S\u00e3o Leopoldo and Novo Hamburgo, the German immigrants spread into others areas of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], mainly close to sources of rivers. The whole region of Vale dos Sinos was populated by Germans. During the 1830s and part of the 1840s German immigration to Brazil was interrupted due to conflicts in the country ([[Ragamuffin War]]). The immigration restarted after 1845 with the creation of new colonies. The most important ones were [[Blumenau]], in 1850, and [[Joinville]] in 1851, both in [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina state]]; these attracted thousands of German immigrants to the region.\nIn the next five decades, other 28 thousand Germans were brought to Rio Grande do Sul to work as small farmers in the countryside.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mre.gov.br/CDBRASIL/ITAMARATY/WEB/ingles/consnac/imigra/alemaes/index.htm|title=Germans|website=Mre.gov.br|accessdate=August 21, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716191844/http://www.mre.gov.br/CDBRASIL/ITAMARATY/WEB/ingles/consnac/imigra/alemaes/index.htm|archivedate=July 16, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> By 1914 it is estimated that 50 thousand Germans settled in this state.\n\nAnother immigration boom to this region started in 1875. Communities with Italian immigrants were also created in southern Brazil. The first colonies to be populated by Italians were created in the highlands of Rio Grande do Sul ([[Serra Ga\u00facha]]). These were [[Garibaldi (city)|Garibaldi]] and [[Bento Gon\u00e7alves, Rio Grande do Sul|Bento Gon\u00e7alves]]. These immigrants were predominantly from [[Veneto]], in northern Italy. After five years, in 1880, the great numbers of Italian immigrants arriving caused the Brazilian government to create another Italian colony, [[Caxias do Sul]]. After initially settling in the government-promoted colonies, many of the Italian immigrants spread themselves into other areas of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] seeking further opportunities. They created many other Italian colonies on their own, mainly in highlands, because the lowlands were already populated by Germans and native ''ga\u00fachos''. The Italian established many vineyards in the region. Nowadays, the wine produced in these areas of Italian colonization in southern Brazil is much appreciated within the country, though little is available for export. In 1875, the first Italian colonies were established in [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], which lies immediately to the north of Rio Grande do Sul. The colonies gave rise to towns such as [[Crici\u00fama]], and later also spread further north, to [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]].\n\nA significant number of [[Poles]] have settled in Southern Brazil. The first immigrants arrived in 1869. From 1872 to 1959, 110,243 \"Russian\" citizens entered Brazil. In fact, the majority of them were Poles, since Poland was under Russian rule until 1917, and ethnic Poles immigrated with Russian passports.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/anais/pdf/2000/Todos/Uma%20Hist%C3%B3ria%20Oculta%20a%20Imigra%C3%A7ao%20dos%20Pa%C3%ADses....pdf |title=Uma hist\u00f3ria oculta: a imigra\u00e7\u00e3o dos pa\u00edses da Europa do Centro-Leste para o Brasil |accessdate=2009-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225173649/http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/anais/pdf/2000/Todos/Uma%20Hist%C3%B3ria%20Oculta%20a%20Imigra%C3%A7ao%20dos%20Pa%C3%ADses....pdf |archivedate=February 25, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Southeast===\nThe [[Southeastern Brazil|Southeastern region]] of Brazil is the ethnically most diverse part of the country.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nSoutheast Brazil is home to the oldest Portuguese settlement in the Americas, [[S\u00e3o Vicente, S\u00e3o Paulo]], established in 1532.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rankbrasil.com.br/maismais/turismo/saovicente/default.asp|title=RankBrasil - Recordes Brasileiros|first=Luciano|last=Cadari|website=Rankbrasil.com.br|accessdate=August 21, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224114234/http://www.rankbrasil.com.br/maismais/turismo/saovicente/default.asp|archivedate=December 24, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The region, since the beginning of its colonization, is a [[melting pot]] of Whites, Indians and Blacks.

Brazil attracted nearly 5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953. The large numbers of Italians are visible in many parts of Southeast Brazil. Their descendants are nowadays predominant in many areas.\n\nThe arrival of immigrants from several places of Europe, the Middle East and Asia produced an ethnically diverse population.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The city of S\u00e3o Paulo is home to the largest population of Japanese origin outside of Japan itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitesaopaulo.com/english/city/itineraries-saopaulo.htm|title=Visite S\u00e3o Paulo - P\u00e1gina n\u00e3o encontrada|first=S\u00e3o Paulo Convention & Visitors|last=Bureau|website=Visitesaopaulo.com|accessdate=August 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107110018/http://www.visitesaopaulo.com/english/city/itineraries-saopaulo.htm|archive-date=January 7, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Northeast===\nThe influx of immigrants in this region in the 19th century was much smaller than in Southern Brazil.

Who, in fact, worked as slaves in the gold mines were the local Indians{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. The contact between the Portuguese and the Indians created a mixed-race population{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. Until the mid-20th century, Central-West Brazil had a very small population. The situation changed with the construction of [[Brasilia]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}, the new capital of Brazil, in 1960. Many workers were attracted to the region, mostly from northeastern Brazil.\n\nA new migratory movement started arriving from the 1970s. With the mechanization of agriculture in the South of Brazil, rural workers of that region, many of them of German and Italian origin migrated to the Central-West region.\n\n==Days celebrating racial groups in Brazil==\n\nIn Brazil, the \"Day of the [[Caboclo]]\" (''Dia do Caboclo'') is observed annually on June 24, in celebration of the contributions and identity of the [[mameluco|original caboclos]] and their descendants.

He actually works as a security service provider for an [[Prostitution in South Korea|illegal prostitution business]] under the name \"Uncle\" with the help of Lee Whang-chul, also called \"Old Man\", who protects the sex workers and transfers the money to Ji-soo. His classmate Seo Min-hee is one of the workers, though she does not know who \"Uncle\" is. One weekend, Ji-soo has a study project to do with Bae Gyu-ri, a girl he has a crush on, and thus tells Mr. Lee to take the day off. Knowing that she won't be protected, Min-hee still accepts the offer of a client unaware that he had previously assaulted one of the sex workers and that she is walking into a trap. She sends the alert and Ji-soo eventually leaves Gyu-ri to save her, calling the police but giving the wrong motel room only to scare the client. The latter takes a picture of Min-hee before leaving and intents to upload it on the high school's website at a [[PC bang]] before he is stopped by Mr. Lee. In a bus, it is revealed that Gyu-ri is the one who stole the expensive phone case that Min-hee had bought for her boyfriend as she receives a message from a potential buyer and tries to resell it at a higher price. Back at school, as Ji-soo is sleeping alone at his desk, Gyu-ri who noticed before that Ji-soo had another phone confirms what she previously saw. \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Episode 2\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = Gyu-ri steals Ji-soo's business phone, finds the password and starts blackmailing him. Through the app, Gyu-ri accepts Min-hee's request to go to a client's room where she has a panic attack due to her [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] and requires Mr. Lee's help. Ji-soo starts tracking his second phone, having a violent encounter with Ki-tae \u2013 Min-hee's bully boyfriend \u2013 in the process, but Gyu-ri outsmarts him. Ji-soo's father wants to take him to [[Ulsan]] where he now lives but his son sees that he is only doing so because he needs money. Afraid of leaving his home because the blackmailer threatened to expose him, Ji-soo is visited by Gyu-ri who finds a way to make him leave the apartment and searches for the money. She hides when Ji-soo's father sneaks into the apartment and accidentally discovers the money before stealing it. She chases him, in vain. In the street, Ji-soo sees his father fleeing with the money and discovers that Gyu-ri is the blackmailer. The following day, she tells her classmates that Ji-soo is her boyfriend in order to stop Ki-tae from bullying him.

Gyu-ri argues that Ji-soo is a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] but he insists that he is only a security service provider and falls asleep after she refuses to explain why she needs money when her family is rich. In the morning, they catch Ji-soo's father and learn that he invested all the money in [[cryptocurrency]]. They witness as he looses more than 90% of the money and Ji-soo glares at a kitchen knife but restrains himself from stabbing his father. Back in Seoul, Ji-soo is struggling financially and cannot pay Mr. Lee who refuses to work until he receives his monthly payment. Mr. Lee tries to convince Min-hee to stop working but she refuses, and when Sung-mi \u2013 Min-hee's colleague who was assaulted by the same client \u2013 pressures other sex workers to look for another security service provider, Min-hee says she will only work with Mr. Lee who himself will only work with Uncle. Gyu-ri offers money to Ji-soo in exchange for a partnership in his business but he refuses. After failing his midterm exam, because he had to work part-time and was too mentally and physically exhausted to study, Ji-soo has a breakdown and hits his classmate Chae-bin in the face before accepting Gyu-ri's offer.\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |Title           = Episode 4\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = Now able to pay Mr. Lee, Ji-soo tells him that they are back in business.

In a [[billiard room]], Ki-tae gives Chae-bin advice on how to bully Ji-soo without Gyu-ri knowing (since she is protected by juniors and seniors, including the judo team). Gyu-ri shows Ji-soo that many students do illegal businesses and then try to recruit her judo friends by sending them [[messaging spam]]s, but fails. At school, a detective specialized in juvenile crime called Lee Hae-gyoung, who has been investigating a possible underage prostitution case since she saw a teenager leaving a motel a few weeks earlier, encounters students smoking and recognizes Min-hee's bag. Chae-bin breaks Ji-soo's chair and paints his locker in black, before putting an adult toy for men box in his backpack and tipping off a teacher with the help of Ki-tae. Consequently, the teacher enters the classroom and starts searching the bags of each student.

Gyu-ri's mother is waiting for her at the school's exit and offers Ji-soo a ride; she questions them about their relationship and reprimands her daughter about the fire alarm incident. At Ki-tae's birthday party, Min-hee offers him a cap that he finds cheap which angers her. Gyu-ri succeeds in recruiting their first male sex worker: an [[Korean idol|idol]] trainee from her mother's company. At school, Min-hee gives Ji-soo the cap after bumping into him in the corridor which makes Gyu-ri jealous.

The virus is often latent until the chicks reach maturity. Thereafter, the matured chickens begin to excrete virus and transmit through the eggs and droppings.\n\nThe virus is also transmitted horizontally between chickens.

Other restrictions may limit the use of [[ultrasonics|ultrasonic]] devices like [[sonar]] (which may confuse the guidance system of [[cetaceans]]), development, construction and the like. Some fishing restrictions include \"no-take\" zones, which means that no fishing is allowed. Less than 1% of US MPAs are no-take.\n\nShip transit can also be restricted or banned, either as a preventive measure or to avoid direct disturbance to individual species. The degree to which environmental regulations affect shipping varies according to whether MPAs are located in [[territorial waters]], [[exclusive economic zone]]s, or the [[high seas]]. The [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|law of the sea]] regulates these limits.\n\nMost MPAs have been located in territorial waters, where the appropriate government can enforce them. However, MPAs have been established in exclusive economic zones and in [[international waters]]. For example, Italy, France and Monaco in 1999 jointly established a cetacean sanctuary in the [[Ligurian Sea]] named the [[Pelagos Sanctuary for Mediterranean Marine Mammals]]. This sanctuary includes both national and international waters. Both the [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]] and [[IUCN]] recommended a variety of management systems for use in a protected area system. They advocated that MPAs be seen as one of many \"nodes\" in a network of protected areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unep-wcmc.org/marine-protected-areas_470.html/ |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111220214403/http://www.unep-wcmc.org/marine-protected-areas_470.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-12-20 |title=Marine Protected Area Networks |publisher=Unep-Wcmc |date=2011-01-18 |accessdate=2012-06-07 }}</ref> The following are the most common management systems:\n\n[[File:Asinara-Island01.jpg|thumb|right|Asinara, Italy is listed by WDPA as both a marine reserve and a national marine park, and as such could be labelled 'multiple-use'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/Area_Naturale_Marina_Protetta_Isola_Dell_Asinara_Natural_Marine_Reserve_And_Natural_Protected_Marine_Areas/ |title=Asinara Natural Marine Reserve |publisher=Protectedplanet.net |accessdate=2012-06-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608184308/http://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/Area_Naturale_Marina_Protetta_Isola_Dell_Asinara_Natural_Marine_Reserve_And_Natural_Protected_Marine_Areas |archivedate=2012-06-08 }}</ref>]]\n\n'''Seasonal and temporary management'''\u2014Activities, most critically fishing, are restricted seasonally or temporarily, e.g., to protect spawning/nursing grounds or to let a rapidly reducing species recover.\n\n'''Multiple-use MPAs'''\u2014These are the most common and arguably the most effective.

The Convention bound contracting nations to abide by previously agreed upon Antarctic territorial claims and peaceful use of the region while protecting ecosystem integrity south of the [[Antarctic Convergence]] and [[60th parallel south|60 S latitude]]. In so doing, it also established a commission of the original signatories and acceding parties called the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to advance these aims through protection, scientific study, and rational use, such as harvesting, of those marine resources. Though separate, the Antarctic Treaty and CCAMLR, make up part the broader system of international agreements called the Antarctic Treaty System. Since 1982, the CCAMLR meets annually to implement binding conservations measures like the creation of 'protected areas' at the suggestion of the convention's scientific committee.\n\nIn 2009, the CCAMLR created the first 'high-seas' MPA entirely within international waters over the southern shelf of the [[South Orkney Islands]]. This area encompasses {{convert|94,000|km2|sqmi}} and all fishing activity including transhipment, and dumping or discharge of waste is prohibited with the exception of scientific research endeavors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Protection of the South Orkney Islands southern shelf|url=https://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-91-03-2009|website=www.ccamlr.org|publisher=Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources|accessdate=29 October 2016}}</ref> On 28 October 2016, the CCAMLR, composed of 24 member countries and the European Union at the time, agreed to establish the world's largest marine park encompassing 1.55 million km<sup>2</sup> (600,000 sq mi) in the Ross Sea after several years of failed negotiations.

The MPAs are [[Banyuls]], [[Carry-le-Rouet]] and Scandola, off the island of [[Corsica]].<ref name=sd>{{cite journal\n|journal=Science Daily\n|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100511102115.htm\n|title=Marine Protected Areas Conserve Mediterranean Red Coral\n|date=May 11, 2010|accessdate=June 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\n*[[Mediterranean Science Commission]]; proposed the creation of 7 marine protected areas (\"peace parcs\")<ref>{{cite web|url=http://magazine.nationalgeographic.nl/2011/02/22/in-het-kielzog-van-jacques-cousteau/ |title=7 peace parcs proposed by CIESM |publisher=Magazine.nationalgeographic.nl |accessdate=2012-06-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228162959/http://magazine.nationalgeographic.nl/2011/02/22/in-het-kielzog-van-jacques-cousteau/ |archivedate=2011-02-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ciesm.org |title=CIESM webpage |publisher=Ciesm.org |accessdate=2012-06-07}}</ref>\n\n* WWF together with other partners<ref>[http://medpan.org/about/medpan/organisation/ The association]</ref> proposed the creation of MedPan (Network of Marine Protected Areas Managers in the Mediterranean) which aims to protect 10% of the surface of the mediterranean by 2020<ref>[http://mediterranean.panda.org/?206841 The Mediterranean needs more marine reserves \u2013 they are an antidote to the crisis, says WWF]</ref>\n\nA 2018 study published in [[Science (journal)|Science]] found that trawling is more intense inside official EU marine sanctuaries and that endangered fish species such as sharks and rays are more common outside them.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/20/marine-life-worse-off-inside-protected-areas-analysis-reveals  Marine life worse off inside 'protected' areas, analysis reveals] The Guardian, 2019</ref>\n\n===Notable marine protected areas===\n{{clarify|Reason=What makes these specifically notable?|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Marine protected areas detailed map.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Marine protected areas]]\n* The [[Bowie Seamount|Bowie Seamount Marine Protected Area]] off the [[British Columbia Coast|coast of British Columbia]], Canada.\n* The [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park]] in [[Queensland, Australia|Queensland]], Australia.\n* The [[Ligurian Sea Cetacean Sanctuary]] in the seas of Italy, [[Monaco]] and France.\n* The [[Dry Tortugas National Park]] in the [[Florida Keys]], USA.\n* The [[Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument]] in [[Hawaii]].\n* The [[Phoenix Islands Protected Area]], [[Kiribati]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservation.org/newsroom/pressreleases/Pages/PIPA-largest-protected-area-in-pacific.aspx |title=Conservation International \u2013 World's Largest Marine Protected Area Created in Pacific Ocean |publisher=Conservation.org |accessdate=2012-06-07}}</ref>\n* The [[Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary]] in [[California]], USA.{{sfn|Smith|Miller|2003|}}\n* The [[Chagos Marine Protected Area]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].<ref>{{cite web|last=North Sea Marine Cluster |title=Managing Marine Protected Areas |url=http://nsmc.eu.com/Marine-Protected-Areas-Report-3.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530213720/http://nsmc.eu.com/Marine-Protected-Areas-Report-3.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 May 2013 |publisher=NSMC |accessdate=11 February 2013 }}</ref>\n*The [[Wadden Sea]] bordering the [[North Sea]] in the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark.\n\n===Marine protected areas as percentage of territorial waters===\n<!-- Color scheme= \n0 \u2013 2,5% = red\n2,5 \u2013 5% = orange\n5 \u2013 7,5% = yellow\n7,5- 10% = green\n10%+ = blue\nno data or landlocked country = grey\n-->\nThe following shows a list of countries and their marine protected areas as percentage of their territorial waters (click \"show\" to expand).<ref>{{cite web| url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ER.MRN.PTMR.ZS| title=Marine protected areas % of territorial waters| date=2016-2017| publisher=The World Bank| accessdate=March 12, 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 85%; width: auto; table-layout: fixed;\"\n|-\n!

A. | doi=10.1126/science.1125295 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n== Fish ==\nMPAs can be an effective tool to maintain fish populations; see [[refuge (ecology)]]. The general concept is to create overpopulation within the MPA. The fish expand into the surrounding areas to reduce crowding, increasing the population of unprotected areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://innri.unuftp.is/pdf/Marine%20Protected%20Areas.pdf|title=Marine Protected Areas (Innri)|author=|date=|website=unuftp.is}}</ref> This helps support local fisheries in the surrounding area, while maintaining a healthy population within the MPA. Such MPAs are most commonly used for coral reef ecosystems.\n\nOne example is at Goat Island Bay in New Zealand, established in 1977. Research gathered at Goat Bay documented the spillover effect. \"Spillover and larval export\u2014the drifting of millions of eggs and larvae beyond the reserve\u2014have become central concepts of marine conservation\". This positively impacted commercial fishermen in surrounding areas.<ref>Warne, Kennedy. [http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/04/table-of-contents] \"Saving the Sea's Bounty\"] National Geographic. April 2007.</ref>\n\nAnother unexpected result of MPAs is their impact on predatory marine species, which in some conditions can increase in population. When this occurs, prey populations decrease. One study showed that in 21 out of 39 cases, \"trophic cascades,\" caused a decrease in herbivores, which led to an increase in the quantity of plant life. (This occurred in the Malindi Kisite and Watamu Marian National Parks in Kenya; the Leigh Marine Reserve in New Zealand; and Brackett's Landing Conservation Area in the US.<ref>MPA News, [https://mpanews.openchannels.org/mpanews/issue/july-2004-61 Vol. 6 No. 1, July 2004]</ref>\n\n== Success criteria ==\nBoth [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]] and [[IUCN]] have criteria for setting up and maintaining MPA networks, which emphasize 4 factors:<ref name=\"Wells17\">{{harvnb|Wells|Sheppard|van_Lavieren|Barnard|2008|p=17}}\nThe [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] defines a ''protected area'' as:\n<blockquote>\"A clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated, and managed, through legal or effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem service and cultural value.\"</blockquote></ref>\n*'''Adequacy'''\u2014ensuring that the sites have the size, shape, and distribution to ensure the success of selected species.\n*'''Representability'''\u2014protection for all of the local environment's biological processes\n*'''Resilience'''\u2014the resistance of the system to natural disaster, such as a tsunami or flood.\n*'''Connectivity'''\u2014maintaining population links across nearby MPAs.\n\n== Misconceptions ==\nMisconceptions about MPAs include the belief that all MPAs are no-take or no-fishing areas. However, less than 1 percent of US waters are no-take areas. MPA activities can include consumption fishing, diving and other activities.\n\nAnother misconception is that most MPAs are federally managed. Instead, MPAs are managed under hundreds of laws and jurisdictions. They can exist in state, commonwealth, territory and tribal waters.\n\nAnother misconception is that a federal mandate dedicates a set percentage of ocean to MPAs. Instead the mandate requires an evaluation of current MPAs and creates a public resource on current MPAs.<ref>[http://mpa.gov/pdf/helpful-resources/factsheets/mpamisconceptions2.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215150109/http://mpa.gov/pdf/helpful-resources/factsheets/mpamisconceptions2.pdf |date=February 15, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\nSome existing and proposed MPAs have been criticized by indigenous populations and their supporters, as impinging on land usage rights. For example, the proposed Chagos Protected Area in the Chagos Islands is contested by [[Chagossians]] deported from their homeland in 1965 by the [[United Kingdom|British]] as part of the creation of the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] (BIOT). According to [[WikiLeaks]] [[CableGate]] documents,<ref name=\"[http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2010/12/23/18667425.php]\">{{cite web |url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2010/12/23/18667425.php |title=WikiLeaks reveals U.S., British use marine reserves as tool of imperialism |accessdate=2010-12-24 |date=2009-05-15 |work=Embassy London}}</ref> the UK proposed that the BIOT become a \"marine reserve\" with the aim of preventing the former inhabitants from returning to their lands and to protect the joint UK/US military base on [[Diego Garcia]] Island.\n\nOther critiques include: their cost (higher than that of passive management), conflicts with human development goals, inadequate scope to address factors such as climate change and invasive species.<ref name=\"MoraAndSale2011\" />\n\nIn Scotland, environmental groups have criticised the government for failing to enforce fishing rules around MPAs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theferret.scot/fines-fishermen-prosecution/|title=Fines to rogue fishermen fall and illegal fishing escapes prosecution|date=2019-10-06|website=The Ferret|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\n== Recent research ==\n[[File:Zebrasoma flavescens Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|right|The larvae of the [[yellow tang]] can drift more than 100 miles and reseed in a distant location.<ref name=Christie2010 />]]\n\nIn 2010, one study found that [[fish larvae]] can drift on ocean currents and reseed [[fish stock]]s at a distant location.

Other restrictions may limit the use of [[ultrasonics|ultrasonic]] devices like [[sonar]] (which may confuse the guidance system of [[cetaceans]]), development, construction and the like. Some fishing restrictions include \"no-take\" zones, which means that no fishing is allowed. Less than 1% of US MPAs are no-take.\n\nShip transit can also be restricted or banned, either as a preventive measure or to avoid direct disturbance to individual species. The degree to which environmental regulations affect shipping varies according to whether MPAs are located in [[territorial waters]], [[exclusive economic zone]]s, or the [[high seas]]. The [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|law of the sea]] regulates these limits.\n\nMost MPAs have been located in territorial waters, where the appropriate government can enforce them. However, MPAs have been established in exclusive economic zones and in [[international waters]]. For example, Italy, France and Monaco in 1999 jointly established a cetacean sanctuary in the [[Ligurian Sea]] named the [[Pelagos Sanctuary for Mediterranean Marine Mammals]]. This sanctuary includes both national and international waters. Both the [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]] and [[IUCN]] recommended a variety of management systems for use in a protected area system. They advocated that MPAs be seen as one of many \"nodes\" in a network of protected areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unep-wcmc.org/marine-protected-areas_470.html/ |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111220214403/http://www.unep-wcmc.org/marine-protected-areas_470.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-12-20 |title=Marine Protected Area Networks |publisher=Unep-Wcmc |date=2011-01-18 |accessdate=2012-06-07 }}</ref> The following are the most common management systems:\n\n[[File:Asinara-Island01.jpg|thumb|right|Asinara, Italy is listed by WDPA as both a marine reserve and a national marine park, and as such could be labelled 'multiple-use'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/Area_Naturale_Marina_Protetta_Isola_Dell_Asinara_Natural_Marine_Reserve_And_Natural_Protected_Marine_Areas/ |title=Asinara Natural Marine Reserve |publisher=Protectedplanet.net |accessdate=2012-06-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608184308/http://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/Area_Naturale_Marina_Protetta_Isola_Dell_Asinara_Natural_Marine_Reserve_And_Natural_Protected_Marine_Areas |archivedate=2012-06-08 }}</ref>]]\n\n'''Seasonal and temporary management'''\u2014Activities, most critically fishing, are restricted seasonally or temporarily, e.g., to protect spawning/nursing grounds or to let a rapidly reducing species recover.\n\n'''Multiple-use MPAs'''\u2014These are the most common and arguably the most effective.

The Convention bound contracting nations to abide by previously agreed upon Antarctic territorial claims and peaceful use of the region while protecting ecosystem integrity south of the [[Antarctic Convergence]] and [[60th parallel south|60 S latitude]]. In so doing, it also established a commission of the original signatories and acceding parties called the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to advance these aims through protection, scientific study, and rational use, such as harvesting, of those marine resources. Though separate, the Antarctic Treaty and CCAMLR, make up part the broader system of international agreements called the Antarctic Treaty System. Since 1982, the CCAMLR meets annually to implement binding conservations measures like the creation of 'protected areas' at the suggestion of the convention's scientific committee.\n\nIn 2009, the CCAMLR created the first 'high-seas' MPA entirely within international waters over the southern shelf of the [[South Orkney Islands]]. This area encompasses {{convert|94,000|km2|sqmi}} and all fishing activity including transhipment, and dumping or discharge of waste is prohibited with the exception of scientific research endeavors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Protection of the South Orkney Islands southern shelf|url=https://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-91-03-2009|website=www.ccamlr.org|publisher=Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources|accessdate=29 October 2016}}</ref> On 28 October 2016, the CCAMLR, composed of 24 member countries and the European Union at the time, agreed to establish the world's largest marine park encompassing 1.55 million km<sup>2</sup> (600,000 sq mi) in the Ross Sea after several years of failed negotiations.

The general concept is to create overpopulation within the MPA. The fish expand into the surrounding areas to reduce crowding, increasing the population of unprotected areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://innri.unuftp.is/pdf/Marine%20Protected%20Areas.pdf|title=Marine Protected Areas (Innri)|author=|date=|website=unuftp.is}}</ref> This helps support local fisheries in the surrounding area, while maintaining a healthy population within the MPA. Such MPAs are most commonly used for coral reef ecosystems.\n\nOne example is at Goat Island Bay in New Zealand, established in 1977. Research gathered at Goat Bay documented the spillover effect. \"Spillover and larval export\u2014the drifting of millions of eggs and larvae beyond the reserve\u2014have become central concepts of marine conservation\". This positively impacted commercial fishermen in surrounding areas.<ref>Warne, Kennedy. [http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/04/table-of-contents] \"Saving the Sea's Bounty\"] National Geographic. April 2007.</ref>\n\nAnother unexpected result of MPAs is their impact on predatory marine species, which in some conditions can increase in population. When this occurs, prey populations decrease. One study showed that in 21 out of 39 cases, \"trophic cascades,\" caused a decrease in herbivores, which led to an increase in the quantity of plant life. (This occurred in the Malindi Kisite and Watamu Marian National Parks in Kenya; the Leigh Marine Reserve in New Zealand; and Brackett's Landing Conservation Area in the US.<ref>MPA News, [https://mpanews.openchannels.org/mpanews/issue/july-2004-61 Vol. 6 No. 1, July 2004]</ref>\n\n== Success criteria ==\nBoth [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]] and [[IUCN]] have criteria for setting up and maintaining MPA networks, which emphasize 4 factors:<ref name=\"Wells17\">{{harvnb|Wells|Sheppard|van_Lavieren|Barnard|2008|p=17}}\nThe [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] defines a ''protected area'' as:\n<blockquote>\"A clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated, and managed, through legal or effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem service and cultural value.\"</blockquote></ref>\n*'''Adequacy'''\u2014ensuring that the sites have the size, shape, and distribution to ensure the success of selected species.\n*'''Representability'''\u2014protection for all of the local environment's biological processes\n*'''Resilience'''\u2014the resistance of the system to natural disaster, such as a tsunami or flood.\n*'''Connectivity'''\u2014maintaining population links across nearby MPAs.\n\n== Misconceptions ==\nMisconceptions about MPAs include the belief that all MPAs are no-take or no-fishing areas. However, less than 1 percent of US waters are no-take areas. MPA activities can include consumption fishing, diving and other activities.\n\nAnother misconception is that most MPAs are federally managed. Instead, MPAs are managed under hundreds of laws and jurisdictions. They can exist in state, commonwealth, territory and tribal waters.\n\nAnother misconception is that a federal mandate dedicates a set percentage of ocean to MPAs. Instead the mandate requires an evaluation of current MPAs and creates a public resource on current MPAs.<ref>[http://mpa.gov/pdf/helpful-resources/factsheets/mpamisconceptions2.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215150109/http://mpa.gov/pdf/helpful-resources/factsheets/mpamisconceptions2.pdf |date=February 15, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\nSome existing and proposed MPAs have been criticized by indigenous populations and their supporters, as impinging on land usage rights. For example, the proposed Chagos Protected Area in the Chagos Islands is contested by [[Chagossians]] deported from their homeland in 1965 by the [[United Kingdom|British]] as part of the creation of the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] (BIOT).
