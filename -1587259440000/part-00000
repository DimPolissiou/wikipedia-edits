The club was founded in 1937 and its colours are red and black. Their home stadium, [[Omar Hamadi Stadium]], has a capacity of 10,000 spectators. The club is currently playing in the [[Algerian Ligue Professionnelle 1]].\n\nThe club has one of Algeria's most prominent football charts, won the [[Algerian Ligue Professionnelle 1]] 8 times, the [[Algerian Cup]] 8 times and the [[Algerian Super Cup]] 2 times, Internationally, USM Alger has won the [[UAFA Club Championship]] once in [[2012\u201313 UAFA Club Cup|2013]].

USM Alger reached the final of the [[2015 CAF Champions League]] but they lost to [[TP Mazembe]].\n\nWith the past of the Union Sportive Musulmane d'Alger (former name of the USMA), winner of the first [[1962\u201363 Algerian Championnat National]], the USMA is the postwar reference [[Algerian War]]). In one year, the club Alg\u00e9rois won a titles of champion of Algeria and subsequently finalist of the Algerian Cup 1969. The club is going through a difficult period, the club is financially supported, the USMA is bought in 2010. This privatization is accompanied by positive sporting results: solidly anchored in [[Algerian Ligue Professionnelle 1|Ligue 1]] since with the arrival of the Algerian investor [[Ali Haddad]] follows the title of champion of Algeria Of the Ligue 1 in [[2013\u201314 Algerian Ligue Professionnelle 1|2014]], the club regularly qualifies for the current African cups [[CAF Champions League]] or [[CAF Confederation Cup]] And realized 3 titles in 2 years championship-Algerian cup and Super Cup during the season 2013\u20132014. That football season, USM Alger drew an average home attendance of 24,286 for domestic league games, one of the highest in Africa.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of USM Alger}}\n{{see also|List of USM Alger seasons}}\n\nThe discussion soon began despite some reluctance: \"I wished a round table would be present all former living. The risks of failure are reduced. \" A suggestion very relevant, but for time we had to content ourselves with our initiative.\nMr. Kemmat admit that the idea of creating a club came like that. She had begun to sprout during the month of May [[1937 in association football|1937]]. \"There was a neighborhood team, the sports club of the street that Sallust had enjoyed. We thought this was ''Lahmar said Ali Zaid'', ''Zemmour Ali'', ''Ali Slimani'', ''Bennour Said'', ''Meddad Arezki'', ''Sid Ali Terkmane'' and I, a group of friends district who lived hard times of colonization. We often discussed, of all things in life .. And then by little we arrived at the sport. The example of Muslims clubs of the time we inflamed. A burning desire to do something we earned every time the subject was discussed. All these clubs had inspired us, including the MSO Oran created it in [[1928 in association football|1928]] in terms of the name I knew all the workings of such an operation. My frequent contact with ''Mouloud Djazouli'' very active leader of the [[MC Alger]] had taught me a lot. I began immediately to work. We had to prepare the statutes and the case to be filed with the prefecture services. No sooner said than done, the file is saved under the number&nbsp;\u2013 wait if I remember correctly&nbsp;\u2013 1687. The only thing that \"shocked\" the colonial administration was the word Muslim. He was very unpopular. They discussed, we argued on both sides and the approval was granted. On 5 July [[1937 in association football|1937]] the club was created. USMA was born. His office was in the street Divan. Its first board of course includes the first named above which will add ''Abdelkader Amrani'', ''Hemmaz Omar'', ''Omar Lakehal'', ''Basta Mohamed Ouali'' ''Zennagui Mohamed'' and ''Ali Cherifi''.

In one year, the club Alg\u00e9rois won a titles of champion of Algeria and subsequently finalist of the Algerian Cup 1969. The club is going through a difficult period, the club is financially supported, the USMA is bought in 2010. This privatization is accompanied by positive sporting results: solidly anchored in [[Algerian Ligue Professionnelle 1|Ligue 1]] since with the arrival of the Algerian investor [[Ali Haddad]] follows the title of champion of Algeria Of the Ligue 1 in [[2013\u201314 Algerian Ligue Professionnelle 1|2014]], the club regularly qualifies for the current African cups [[CAF Champions League]] or [[CAF Confederation Cup]] And realized 3 titles in 2 years championship-Algerian cup and Super Cup during the season 2013\u20132014. That football season, USM Alger drew an average home attendance of 24,286 for domestic league games, one of the highest in Africa.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of USM Alger}}\n{{see also|List of USM Alger seasons}}\n\nThe discussion soon began despite some reluctance: \"I wished a round table would be present all former living. The risks of failure are reduced. \" A suggestion very relevant, but for time we had to content ourselves with our initiative.\nMr. Kemmat admit that the idea of creating a club came like that. She had begun to sprout during the month of May [[1937 in association football|1937]]. \"There was a neighborhood team, the sports club of the street that Sallust had enjoyed. We thought this was ''Lahmar said Ali Zaid'', ''Zemmour Ali'', ''Ali Slimani'', ''Bennour Said'', ''Meddad Arezki'', ''Sid Ali Terkmane'' and I, a group of friends district who lived hard times of colonization. We often discussed, of all things in life .. And then by little we arrived at the sport. The example of Muslims clubs of the time we inflamed. A burning desire to do something we earned every time the subject was discussed. All these clubs had inspired us, including the MSO Oran created it in [[1928 in association football|1928]] in terms of the name I knew all the workings of such an operation. My frequent contact with ''Mouloud Djazouli'' very active leader of the [[MC Alger]] had taught me a lot. I began immediately to work. We had to prepare the statutes and the case to be filed with the prefecture services. No sooner said than done, the file is saved under the number&nbsp;\u2013 wait if I remember correctly&nbsp;\u2013 1687. The only thing that \"shocked\" the colonial administration was the word Muslim. He was very unpopular. They discussed, we argued on both sides and the approval was granted. On 5 July [[1937 in association football|1937]] the club was created. USMA was born. His office was in the street Divan. Its first board of course includes the first named above which will add ''Abdelkader Amrani'', ''Hemmaz Omar'', ''Omar Lakehal'', ''Basta Mohamed Ouali'' ''Zennagui Mohamed'' and ''Ali Cherifi''.
