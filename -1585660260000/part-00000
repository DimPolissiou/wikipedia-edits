{"title_page": "Romania in the Middle Ages", "text_new": "{{short description|history of Romania from the withdrawal of the Mongols to the rule of Michael the Brave}}\n{{good article}}\n{{history of Romania}}\nThe '''Middle Ages in Romania''' began with the withdrawal of the [[Mongols]], the last of the migrating populations to invade the territory of modern [[Romania]], after [[Mongol invasion of Europe|their attack of 1241\u20131242]]. It came to an end with the reign of [[Michael the Brave]] (1593&ndash;1601) who managed, for a short time in 1600, to rule [[Wallachia]], [[Moldavia]] and [[Transylvania]], the three principalities whose territories were to be united some three centuries later to form Romania. \n\nOver most of this period, [[Banat]], [[Cri\u015fana]], [[Maramure\u015f]] and Transylvania \u2013&nbsp;now [[historical regions of Romania|regions in Romania]] to the west of the [[Carpathian Mountains]]&nbsp;\u2013 were part of the '''[[Kingdom of Hungary]]'''. They were divided into several types of administrative units, such as \"[[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)|counties]]\" and \"[[Seat (territorial-administrative unit)|seats]]\". The heads of the Transylvanian counties or \"[[Isp\u00e1ns|counts]]\" were subordinated to a special royal official called ''[[Voivode of Transylvania|voivode]]'', but the province was seldom treated as a single unit, since the [[Sz\u00e9kely]] and [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] seats were administered separately. In the kingdom, [[Romanians|Romanian]] peasants, being [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], were exempt from the [[tithe]], an ecclesiastical tax payable by all [[Roman Catholic]] commoners. However, Romanian noblemen slowly lost the ability to participate in political life, as the 14th-century monarchs pursued a zealous pro-Catholic policy. Their position became even worse after 1437 when the so-called \"[[Union of Three Nations]]\", an alliance of the Hungarian noblemen, the Sz\u00e9kelys, and the Saxons, was formed in order to crush the [[Bob\u00e2lna revolt|Bob\u00e2lna peasant uprising]].\n\nWallachia, the first independent [[Middle Ages|medieval]] state between the Carpathians and the [[Danube#Geography#Sectioning|lower Danube]] was created when [[Basarab I of Wallachia|Basarab I]] (''c.''&nbsp;1310&ndash;1352) terminated the [[suzerainty]] of the [[king of Hungary]] with his victory in the [[battle of Posada]] in 1330. The independence of Moldavia, to the east of the Carpathians, was achieved by [[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan I]] (1359&ndash;1365), a nobleman from Maramure\u015f, who led a revolt against the former ruler who was appointed by the Hungarian monarch. The independence of the two principalities, however, was rarely secure, and [[vassalage]] to multiple states became an important aspect of their diplomacy. Although Wallachia paid tribute to the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1417, and Moldavia from 1456, their two medieval monarchs, [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea the Old of Wallachia]] (1386&ndash;1418) and [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great of Moldavia]] (1457&ndash;1504) conducted successful military operations against the [[Ottoman Turks]]. The two principalities' trade with other parts of [[Europe]] began to decrease after the last decades of the 15th&nbsp;century. Before this the sale of [[Hide (skin)|hides]], grain, honey, and wax to the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Venice]] and [[Poland]], and the import of silk, weapons and other manufactured goods from these areas had been widespread, but by the end of the 16th&nbsp;century the Ottoman Empire became the main market for Romanian products.\n\nTransylvania, together with the neighboring counties, gained the status of an autonomous state under Ottoman suzerainty after the central territories of the Kingdom of Hungary had been annexed by the Ottomans in 1541. The fall of the kingdom also deprived Wallachia and Moldavia of their main ally in the struggle against the Ottoman Empire. In 1594, Michael the Brave of Wallachia joined the anti-Ottoman alliance initiated by [[Pope Clement VIII]]. After a series of victory over the Ottomans, he turned against Transylvania and Moldavia where pro-Polish and pro-Ottoman princes were reigning. He invaded and occupied Transylvania in 1599, and Moldavia in 1600. Although the personal union of the three countries collapsed four months later, it served as an ideal for later generations working for the unification of the lands that now form Romania.\n\n==Early

It came to an end with the reign of [[Michael the Brave]] (1593&ndash;1601) who managed, for a short time in 1600, to rule [[Wallachia]], [[Moldavia]] and [[Transylvania]], the three principalities whose territories were to be united some three centuries later to form Romania. \n\nOver most of this period, [[Banat]], [[Cri\u015fana]], [[Maramure\u015f]] and Transylvania \u2013&nbsp;now [[historical regions of Romania|regions in Romania]] to the west of the [[Carpathian Mountains]]&nbsp;\u2013 were part of the '''[[Kingdom of Hungary]]'''. They were divided into several types of administrative units, such as \"[[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)|counties]]\" and \"[[Seat (territorial-administrative unit)|seats]]\". The heads of the Transylvanian counties or \"[[Isp\u00e1ns|counts]]\" were subordinated to a special royal official called ''[[Voivode of Transylvania|voivode]]'', but the province was seldom treated as a single unit, since the [[Sz\u00e9kely]] and [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] seats were administered separately. In the kingdom, [[Romanians|Romanian]] peasants, being [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], were exempt from the [[tithe]], an ecclesiastical tax payable by all [[Roman Catholic]] commoners. However, Romanian noblemen slowly lost the ability to participate in political life, as the 14th-century monarchs pursued a zealous pro-Catholic policy. Their position became even worse after 1437 when the so-called \"[[Union of Three Nations]]\", an alliance of the Hungarian noblemen, the Sz\u00e9kelys, and the Saxons, was formed in order to crush the [[Bob\u00e2lna revolt|Bob\u00e2lna peasant uprising]].\n\nWallachia, the first independent [[Middle Ages|medieval]] state between the Carpathians and the [[Danube#Geography#Sectioning|lower Danube]] was created when [[Basarab I of Wallachia|Basarab I]] (''c.''&nbsp;1310&ndash;1352) terminated the [[suzerainty]] of the [[king of Hungary]] with his victory in the [[battle of Posada]] in 1330. The independence of Moldavia, to the east of the Carpathians, was achieved by [[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan I]] (1359&ndash;1365), a nobleman from Maramure\u015f, who led a revolt against the former ruler who was appointed by the Hungarian monarch. The independence of the two principalities, however, was rarely secure, and [[vassalage]] to multiple states became an important aspect of their diplomacy. Although Wallachia paid tribute to the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1417, and Moldavia from 1456, their two medieval monarchs, [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea the Old of Wallachia]] (1386&ndash;1418) and [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great of Moldavia]] (1457&ndash;1504) conducted successful military operations against the [[Ottoman Turks]]. The two principalities' trade with other parts of [[Europe]] began to decrease after the last decades of the 15th&nbsp;century. Before this the sale of [[Hide (skin)|hides]], grain, honey, and wax to the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Venice]] and [[Poland]], and the import of silk, weapons and other manufactured goods from these areas had been widespread, but by the end of the 16th&nbsp;century the Ottoman Empire became the main market for Romanian products.\n\nTransylvania, together with the neighboring counties, gained the status of an autonomous state under Ottoman suzerainty after the central territories of the Kingdom of Hungary had been annexed by the Ottomans in 1541. The fall of the kingdom also deprived Wallachia and Moldavia of their main ally in the struggle against the Ottoman Empire. In 1594, Michael the Brave of Wallachia joined the anti-Ottoman alliance initiated by [[Pope Clement VIII]]. After a series of victory over the Ottomans, he turned against Transylvania and Moldavia where pro-Polish and pro-Ottoman princes were reigning. He invaded and occupied Transylvania in 1599, and Moldavia in 1600. Although the personal union of the three countries collapsed four months later, it served as an ideal for later generations working for the unification of the lands that now form Romania.\n\n==Early

The scene shifts to Heaven, where God asks [[Satan]] ({{lang-he-n|\u05d4\u05b7\u05e9\u05b8\u05bc\u05c2\u05d8\u05b8\u05df}} \u2013 ''ha\u015b\u015b\u0101\u1e6d\u0101n'', literally \"the accuser\") for his opinion of Job's piety. Satan answers that Job is pious only because God has blessed him; if God were to take away everything that Job has, then he would surely curse God. God gives Satan permission to take Job's wealth and kill his children and servants, but Job nonetheless praises God: \"Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return: the Lord has given, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.\"<ref>{{Bibleref2|Job|1:21}}</ref> God allows Satan to afflict his body with [[boil]]s. Job sits in ashes, and his wife prompts him to \"curse God, and die,\" but Job answers: \"Shall we receive good from God and shall we not receive evil?\"<ref>{{Bibleref2|Job|2:9\u201310}}</ref>\n\n=== Job's opening monologue and dialogues between Job and his three friends ===\nJob laments the day of his birth; he would like to die, but even that is denied to him. His three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, console him. The friends do not waver in their belief that Job's suffering is a punishment for sin, for God causes no one to suffer innocently, and they advise him to repent and seek God's mercy. Job responds with scorn: his interlocutors are \"miserable comforters\" ([[Vulgate]] {{lang-la|consolatores onerosi}}),<ref>{{bibleref2|Job 16:2||NIV;VULGATE}}.</ref> since a just God would not treat him so harshly, patience in suffering is impossible, and the Creator should not take his creatures so lightly, to come against them with such force.{{sfn|Kugler|Hartin|2009|p=190}} \n\nJob's responses represent one of the most radical restatements of Israelite theology in the Hebrew Bible.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clines |first1=David J. A. |title=Job's God |journal=Concilium |date=2004 |volume=2004 |issue=4 |page=39\u201351}}</ref> He moves away from the pious attitude as shown in the prologue and began to berate God for the disproportionate wrath against him. He sees God as, among others, intrusive and suffocating (7:17\u201319); unforgiving and obsessed with destroying a human target (7:20\u201321); angry (9:13; 14:13; 16:9; 19:11); fixated on punishment (10:13\u201314); and hostile and destructive (16:11\u201314). He then shifts his focus from the injustice that he himself suffers to God's governance of the world. He suggests that the wicked have taken advantage of the needy and the helpless, who remain in significant hardship, but God does nothing to punish them (24:1\u201312).\n\n=== Three monologues: Poem to Wisdom, Job's closing monologue, and Elihu's speeches ===\n[[File:Job and his friends.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.3|''Job and His Friends'' by [[Ilya Repin]] (1869)]]\n\nThe dialogues of Job and his friends are followed by a poem (the \"hymn to wisdom\") on the inaccessibility of wisdom: \"Where is wisdom to be found?\" it asks, and concludes that it has been hidden from man (chapter 28).{{sfn|Seow|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOn3ZK2n0UUC&pg=PA33-34 33\u201334]}} Job contrasts his previous fortune with his present plight, an outcast, mocked and in pain. He protests his innocence, lists the principles he has lived by, and demands that God answer him.{{sfn|Sawyer|2013|p=27}} [[Elihu (Job)|Elihu]] (a character not previously mentioned) intervenes to state that wisdom comes from God, who reveals it through dreams and visions to those who will then declare their knowledge.{{sfn|Seow|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOn3ZK2n0UUC&pg=PA33-34 33\u201334]}}\n\n===Two speeches by God===\nGod speaks from a whirlwind. His speeches neither explain Job's suffering, nor defend divine justice, nor enter into the courtroom confrontation that Job has demanded, nor respond to his oath of innocence.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=339}} Instead they contrast Job's weakness with divine wisdom and omnipotence: \"Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?\" Job makes a brief response, but God's monologue resumes, never addressing Job directly.{{sfn|Sawyer|2013|p=28}} In 42:1\u20136 Job makes his final response, confessing God's power and his own lack of knowledge \"of things beyond me which I did not know\". Previously he has only heard, but now his eyes have seen God, and \"therefore I retract/ And repent in dust and ashes.\"{{sfn|Habel|1985|p=575}}\n\n===Epilogue===\nGod tells Eliphaz that he and the two other friends \"have not spoken of me what is right as my servant Job has done\". The three (Elihu, the fourth friend introduced in chapter 32 is not mentioned here) are told to make [[Burnt offering (Judaism)|a burnt offering]] with Job as their intercessor, \"for only to him will I show favour\". Job is restored to health, riches and family, and lives to see his children to the fourth generation.{{sfn|Kugler|Hartin|2009|p=33}}\n\n==Composition==\n[[File:LB100fol165.JPG|fol.165-Job.XXXVIII|thumb|Anonymous Byzantine illustration.<br>The [[Incarnation (Christianity)|pre-incarnate]] Christ speaks to Job]]\n\n===Authorship, language, texts===\nJob appears in the 6th-century BCE [[book of Ezekiel]] as a man of antiquity renowned for his righteousness, and the author of the Book of Job has apparently chosen this legendary hero for his [[parable]].{{sfn|Fokkelman|2012|p=20}} Rabbinic tradition ascribes it to [[Moses]], but scholars generally agree that it was written between the 7th and 4th centuries BCE, with the 6th century BCE as the most likely period for various reasons.{{sfn|Kugler|Hartin|2009|p=193}} The anonymous author was almost certainly an Israelite, although he has set his story outside Israel, in southern [[Edom]] or northern Arabia, and makes allusion to places as far apart as [[Mesopotamia]] and Egypt.{{sfn|Seow|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOn3ZK2n0UUC&pg=PA44 44]}}\n\nThe language of Job stands out for its conservative spelling and for its exceptionally large number of words and forms not found elsewhere in the Bible.{{sfn|Seow|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOn3ZK2n0UUC&pg=PA17 17]}} The 12th century Jewish scholar [[Abraham ibn Ezra|Ibn Ezra]] concluded that the book must have been written in some other language and translated into Hebrew,<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org/Ibn_Ezra_on_Job.2.3?lang=bi Ibn Ezra on Job 2:11]</ref> and many later scholars down to the 20th century looked for an [[Aramaic]], [[Arabic]] or [[Edomite language|Edomite]] original, but a close analysis suggests that the foreign words and foreign-looking forms are literary affectations designed to lend authenticity to the book's distant setting.{{sfn|Seow|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOn3ZK2n0UUC&pg=PA21-24 21\u201324]}}\n\nJob exists in a number of forms: the Hebrew [[Masoretic Text]], which underlies many modern Bible translations; the Greek [[Septuagint]] made in Egypt in the last centuries BCE; and Aramaic and Hebrew manuscripts found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].{{sfn|Seow|2013|pp=1\u201316}}\n\n===Job and the wisdom tradition===\nJob, [[Ecclesiastes]] and the [[Book of Proverbs]] belong to the genre of [[wisdom literature]], sharing a perspective that they themselves call the \"way of wisdom\".{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=129}} Wisdom means both a way of thinking and a body of knowledge gained through such thinking, as well as the ability to apply it to life. It is attainable in part through human effort and in part as a gift from God, but never in its entirety \u2013 except by God.{{sfn|Farmer|1998|pp=129\u201330}} The three books share attitudes and assumptions but differ in their conclusions: Proverbs makes confident statements about the world and its workings that are flatly contradicted by Job and Ecclesiastes.{{sfn|Farmer|1998|pp=130\u201331}} Wisdom literature from Sumeria and Babylonia can be dated to the second millennium BCE.{{sfn|Bullock|2007|p=84}} Several texts from ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt offer parallels to Job,{{sfn|Hartley|2008|p=346}} and while it is impossible to tell whether the author of Job was influenced by any of them, their existence suggests that he was the recipient of a long tradition of reflection on the existence of inexplicable suffering.{{sfn|Hartley|2008|p=360}}\n\n==Themes==\n[[File:Destruction of Leviathan.png|thumb|''The Destruction of Leviathan'' by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] (1865)]]\n\nJob is an investigation of the problem of divine justice.{{sfn|Bullock|2007|p=82}} This problem, known in theology as the [[problem of evil]], can be rephrased as a question: \"Why do the righteous suffer?\"{{sfn|Lawson|2005|p=11}} The conventional answer in ancient Israel was that God rewards virtue and punishes sin (the principle known as \"[[retributive justice]]\").{{sfn|Hooks|2006|p=58}} This assumes a world in which human choices and actions are morally significant, but experience demonstrates that suffering is frequently unmerited.{{sfn|Brueggemann|2002|p=201}}\n\nThe biblical concept of righteousness was rooted in the covenant-making God who had ordered creation for communal well-being, and the righteous were those who invested in the community, showing special concern for the poor and needy (see Job's description of his life in chapter 31). Their antithesis were the wicked, who were selfish and greedy.{{sfn|Brueggemann|2002|pp=177\u201378}} The Satan (or The Adversary) raises the question of whether there is such a thing as disinterested righteousness: if God rewards righteousness with prosperity, will men not act righteously from selfish motives? He asks God to test this by removing the prosperity of Job, the most righteous of all God's servants.{{sfn|Walton|2008|pp=336\u201337}}\n\nThe book begins with the frame narrative, giving the reader an omniscient \"God's eye perspective\" which introduces Job as a man of exemplary faith and piety, \"blameless and upright\", who \"fears God\" and \"shuns evil\".{{sfn|Hooks|2006|p=57}}{{sfn|O'Dowd|2008|pp=242\u201343}} The contrast between the frame and the poetic dialogues and monologues, in which Job never learns of the opening scenes in heaven or of the reason for his suffering, creates a sense of dramatic irony between the divine view of the Adversary's wager, and the human view of Job's suffering \"without any reason\" (2:3).{{sfn|O'Dowd|2008|pp=242\u201343}}\n\nIn the poetic dialogues Job's friends see his suffering and assume he must be guilty, since God is just. Job, knowing he is innocent, concludes that God must be unjust.{{sfn|Seow|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOn3ZK2n0UUC&pg=PA97-98 97\u201398]}} He retains his piety throughout the story (belying Satan's suspicion that his righteousness is due to the expectation of reward), but makes clear from his first speech that he agrees with his friends that God should and does reward righteousness.{{sfn|Kugler|Hartin|2009|p=194}} Elihu rejects the arguments of both parties: Job is wrong to accuse God of injustice, as God is greater than human beings, and nor are the friends correct; for suffering, far from being a punishment, may \"rescue the afflicted from their affliction\" and make them more amenable to revelation \u2013 literally, \"open their ears\" (36:15).{{sfn|Seow|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOn3ZK2n0UUC&pg=PA97-98 97\u201398]}}\n\nChapter 28, the Hymn to Wisdom, introduces another theme, divine wisdom. The hymn does not place any emphasis on retributive justice, stressing instead the inaccessibility of wisdom.{{sfn|Dell|2003|p=356}} Wisdom cannot be invented or purchased, it says; God alone knows the meaning of the world, and he grants it only to those who live in reverence before him.{{sfn|Hooks|2006|pp=329\u201330}} God possesses wisdom because he grasps the complexities of the world (28:24\u201326) \u2013 a theme which looks forward to God's speech in chapters 38\u201341 with its repeated refrain \"Where were you when...?\"{{sfn|Fiddes|1996|p=174}}\n\nWhen God finally speaks he neither explains the reason for Job's suffering (revealed to the reader in the prologue in heaven) nor defends his justice. The first speech focuses on his role in maintaining order in the universe: the list of things that God does and Job cannot do demonstrates divine wisdom because order is the heart of wisdom. Job then confesses his lack of wisdom, meaning his lack of understanding of the workings of the cosmos and of the ability to maintain it. The second speech concerns God's role in controlling [[behemoth]] and [[leviathan]], sometimes translated as the hippopotamus and crocodile, but more probably representing primeval cosmic creatures, in either case demonstrating God's wisdom and power.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=338}} Job's reply to God's final speech is longer than his first and more complicated. The usual view is that he admits to being wrong to challenge God and now repents \"in dust and ashes\" (42:6), but the Hebrew is difficult, and an alternative understanding is that Job says he was wrong to repent and mourn and does not retract any of his arguments.{{sfn|Sawyer|2013|p=34}} In the concluding part of the frame narrative God restores and increases his prosperity, indicating that the divine policy on retributive justice remains unchanged.{{sfn|Barton|2008|pp=338\u201339}}\n\n==Later influence and interpretation==\n[[File:Carved wooden figure of Job. Probably from Germany, 1750-1850 CE. The Wellcome Collection, London.jpg|thumb|left|Carved wooden figure of Job. Probably from Germany, 1750\u20131850 CE. The Wellcome Collection, London]]\n===History of interpretation===\nIn the [[Second Temple]] period (500 BCE \u2013 70 CE) Job began being transformed into something more patient and steadfast, with his suffering a test of virtue and a vindication of righteousness for the glory of God.{{sfn|Seow|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOn3ZK2n0UUC&pg=PA111 111]}} The process of \"sanctifying\" Job began with the Greek [[Septuagint]] translation (c. 200 BCE) and was furthered in the [[Testament of Job]] (1st century BCE \u2013 1st century CE), which makes him the hero of patience.{{sfn|Allen|2008|pp=362\u201363}} This reading pays little attention to the Job of the dialogue sections of the book,{{sfn|Dell|1991|pp=6\u20137}} but it was the tradition taken up by the [[Epistle of James]] in the [[New Testament]], which presents Job as one whose patience and endurance should be emulated by believers (James 5:7\u201311).{{sfn|Allen|2008|p=362}} When Christianity began interpreting Job 19:23\u201329 (verses concerning a \"redeemer\" whom Job hopes can save him from God) as a prophecy of Christ,{{sfn|Simonetti|Conti|Oden|2006|pp=105\u201306}} the predominant Jewish view became \"Job the blasphemer\", with some rabbis even saying that he was rightly punished by God because he had stood by while Pharaoh massacred the innocent Jewish infants.{{sfn|Allen|2008|pp=361\u201362}}{{sfn|Noegel|Wheeler|2010|p=171}}\n\n[[Augustine of Hippo]] recorded that Job had prophesied the coming of Christ, and [[Gregory the Great]] offered him as a model of right living worthy of respect. The medieval Jewish scholar [[Maimonides]] declared his story a parable, and the medieval Christian [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote a detailed commentary declaring it true history. In the Reformation [[Martin Luther]] explained how Job's confession of sinfulness and worthlessness underlay his saintliness, and [[John Calvin]]'s Job demonstrated the doctrine of the resurrection and the ultimate certainty of divine justice.{{sfn|Allen|2008|pp=368\u201371}}\n\nThe contemporary movement known as creation theology, an [[Environmental theology|ecological theology]] valuing the needs of all creation, interprets God's speeches in Job 38\u201341 to imply that his interests and actions are not exclusively focused on humankind.{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=150}}\n\n===Liturgical use===\nJewish liturgy does not use readings from the Book of Job in the manner of the [[Torah|Pentateuch]], [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], or [[Five Megillot]], although it is quoted at funerals and times of mourning. However, there are some Jews, particularly the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]], who do hold public readings of Job on the [[Tisha B'Av]] fast (a day of mourning over the destruction of the [[Solomon's Temple|First]] and [[Second Temple|Second]] [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temples]] and other tragedies). The [[cantillation]] signs for the large poetic section in the middle of the Book of Job differ from those of most of the biblical books, using a system shared with it only by [[Psalms]] and [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]].\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] reads from Job and Exodus during [[Holy Week]]. Exodus prepares for the understanding of Christ's exodus to his Father, of his fulfillment of the whole history of salvation; Job, the sufferer, is the Old Testament icon of Christ. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] reads from Job during [[Matins]] in the first two weeks of September and in the Office of the Dead, and in the revised [[Liturgy of the Hours]] Job is read during the Eighth and Ninth Weeks in [[Ordinary Time]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nDo you analyze jobs if you run a company or an organization?

Musical settings from Job include [[Orlande de Lassus]]'s 1565 cycle of motets, the ''Sacrae Lectiones Novem ex Propheta Job'', and [[George Frideric Handel]]'s use of Job 19:25 (\"I know that my redeemer liveth\") as an aria in his 1741 oratorio ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''. Modern works based on the book include [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]'s ''[[Job: A Masque for Dancing]]'', French composer [[Darius Milhaud]]'s ''Cantata From Job'', and Joseph Stein's Broadway interpretation ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', based on an earlier Yiddish memoir by Sholem Alchem in 1894. \nJoni Mitchell composed The Sire of Sorrow (Job's Sad Song.)\nNeil Simon wrote ''[[God's Favorite]]'' which is a modern retelling of the Book of Job. Breughel and [[Georges de la Tour]] depicted Job visited by his wife, and [[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|William Blake produced an entire cycle of illustrations for the book]]. Writers Job has inspired or influenced include{{original research inline|date=May 2015}} [[John Milton]] (''[[Samson Agonistes]]''), Dostoevsky (''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''), Alfred Doblin (\"[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]\"), Franz Kafka (''[[The Trial]]''), [[Carl Jung]] (''[[Answer to Job]]''), [[Joseph Roth]] (''[[Job (novel)|Job]]''), and Bernard Malamud. Archibald MacLeish's drama, ''[[J.B. (play)|JB]]'', one of the most prominent uses of the Book of Job in modern literature, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1959. Job's influence can also be seen in the [[Coen brothers]]' 2009 film, ''[[A Serious Man]]'', which was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]. [[Terrence Malick]]'s 2011 film ''[[The Tree of Life (film)|The Tree of Life]]'', which won the [[Palme d'Or]], is heavily influenced by the themes of the Book of Job, as the film starts with a quote from the beginning of God's speech to Job. A 2014 Malayalam film called \"[[Iyobinte Pusthakam]]\" tells the story of a man who is losing everything in his life and also has parallels with Dostoevsky's (''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''). The Russian film ''[[Leviathan (2014 film)|Leviathan]]'' also draws themes from the Book of Job. In 2015 two Ukrainian composers Roman Grygoriv and Illia Razumeiko created opera-requiem [[IYOV]]. The premiere of the opera was held on 21 September 2015 on the main stage of the international multidisciplinary festival [[Gogolfest]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2015.gogolfest.org/eng/programm/1247/|title=Program 2015|author=GogolFest}}</ref>\n\n===In Islam and Arab folk tradition===\n{{Main|Job in Islam}}\nJob (Arabic ''Ayyub'' \u0627\u064a\u0648\u0628) is one of the 25 prophets mentioned by name in the [[Quran]], where he is lauded as a steadfast and upright worshiper (Q.38:44). His story has the same basic outline as in the Bible, although the three friends are replaced by his brothers, and his wife stays by his side.{{sfn|Noegel|Wheeler|2010|p=171}}{{sfn|Wheeler|2002|p=8}}\n\nIn [[Palestinian folklore]] Job's place of trial is [[Al-Jura|Al-Joura]], a village outside the town of Al Majdal ([[Ashkelon]]). It was there that God rewarded him with a [[Fountain of Youth]] that removed whatever illnesses he had and restored his youth. Al-Joura was a place of annual festivities (four days in all) when people of many faiths gathered and bathed in a natural spring. In Lebanon the Muwahideen (or [[Druze]]) community have a shrine built in the Shouf area that allegedly contains Job's tomb. In [[Turkey]], Job is known as ''Ey\u00fcp'', and he is supposed to have lived in [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa]]. There is also a tomb of Job outside the city of [[Salalah]] in Oman.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Answer to Job]]'' by Carl Jung.\n*[[Book of Job in Byzantine illuminated manuscripts]]\n*[[Commentary on Job]]\n*[[Ludlul b\u0113l n\u0113meqi]] the \"Babylonian Job\"\n*[[Testament of Job]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n\n* {{cite book\n| last = Allen\n| first = J.\n| chapter = Job III: History of Interpretation\n| editor1-last = Longman\n| editor1-first = Tremper\n| editor2-last = Enns\n| editor2-first = Peter\n| title = Dictionary of the Old Testament: Wisdom, Poetry & Writings\n| publisher = InterVarsity Press\n| year = 2008\n| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kE2k36XAkv4C&pg=PA361\n| ref = harv\n| isbn = 9780830817832\n}}\n\n* {{Cite book\n| last = Brueggemann\n| first = Walter\n| title = Reverberations of Faith: A Theological Handbook of Old Testament Themes\n| publisher = Westminster John Knox\n| year = 2002\n| url = https://books.google.com/?id=dBJQ71RIpdMC\n| isbn = 9780664222314\n| ref = harv\n}}\n\n* {{Cite book\n| last = Bullock\n| first = C.

The scene shifts to Heaven, where God asks [[Satan]] ({{lang-he-n|\u05d4\u05b7\u05e9\u05b8\u05bc\u05c2\u05d8\u05b8\u05df}} \u2013 ''ha\u015b\u015b\u0101\u1e6d\u0101n'', literally \"the accuser\") for his opinion of Job's piety. Satan answers that Job is pious only because God has blessed him; if God were to take away everything that Job has, then he would surely curse God. God gives Satan permission to take Job's wealth and kill his children and servants, but Job nonetheless praises God: \"Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return: the Lord has given, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.\"<ref>{{Bibleref2|Job|1:21}}</ref> God allows Satan to afflict his body with [[boil]]s. Job sits in ashes, and his wife prompts him to \"curse God, and die,\" but Job answers: \"Shall we receive good from God and shall we not receive evil?\"<ref>{{Bibleref2|Job|2:9\u201310}}</ref>\n\n=== Job's opening monologue and dialogues between Job and his three friends ===\nJob laments the day of his birth; he would like to die, but even that is denied to him. His three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, console him. The friends do not waver in their belief that Job's suffering is a punishment for sin, for God causes no one to suffer innocently, and they advise him to repent and seek God's mercy. Job responds with scorn: his interlocutors are \"miserable comforters\" ([[Vulgate]] {{lang-la|consolatores onerosi}}),<ref>{{bibleref2|Job 16:2||NIV;VULGATE}}.</ref> since a just God would not treat him so harshly, patience in suffering is impossible, and the Creator should not take his creatures so lightly, to come against them with such force.{{sfn|Kugler|Hartin|2009|p=190}} \n\nJob's responses represent one of the most radical restatements of Israelite theology in the Hebrew Bible.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clines |first1=David J. A. |title=Job's God |journal=Concilium |date=2004 |volume=2004 |issue=4 |page=39\u201351}}</ref> He moves away from the pious attitude as shown in the prologue and began to berate God for the disproportionate wrath against him. He sees God as, among others, intrusive and suffocating (7:17\u201319); unforgiving and obsessed with destroying a human target (7:20\u201321); angry (9:13; 14:13; 16:9; 19:11); fixated on punishment (10:13\u201314); and hostile and destructive (16:11\u201314). He then shifts his focus from the injustice that he himself suffers to God's governance of the world. He suggests that the wicked have taken advantage of the needy and the helpless, who remain in significant hardship, but God does nothing to punish them (24:1\u201312).\n\n=== Three monologues: Poem to Wisdom, Job's closing monologue, and Elihu's speeches ===\n[[File:Job and his friends.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.3|''Job and His Friends'' by [[Ilya Repin]] (1869)]]\n\nThe dialogues of Job and his friends are followed by a poem (the \"hymn to wisdom\") on the inaccessibility of wisdom: \"Where is wisdom to be found?\" it asks, and concludes that it has been hidden from man (chapter 28).{{sfn|Seow|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOn3ZK2n0UUC&pg=PA33-34 33\u201334]}} Job contrasts his previous fortune with his present plight, an outcast, mocked and in pain. He protests his innocence, lists the principles he has lived by, and demands that God answer him.{{sfn|Sawyer|2013|p=27}} [[Elihu (Job)|Elihu]] (a character not previously mentioned) intervenes to state that wisdom comes from God, who reveals it through dreams and visions to those who will then declare their knowledge.{{sfn|Seow|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOn3ZK2n0UUC&pg=PA33-34 33\u201334]}}\n\n===Two speeches by God===\nGod speaks from a whirlwind. His speeches neither explain Job's suffering, nor defend divine justice, nor enter into the courtroom confrontation that Job has demanded, nor respond to his oath of innocence.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=339}} Instead they contrast Job's weakness with divine wisdom and omnipotence: \"Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?\" Job makes a brief response, but God's monologue resumes, never addressing Job directly.{{sfn|Sawyer|2013|p=28}} In 42:1\u20136 Job makes his final response, confessing God's power and his own lack of knowledge \"of things beyond me which I did not know\". Previously he has only heard, but now his eyes have seen God, and \"therefore I retract/ And repent in dust and ashes.\"{{sfn|Habel|1985|p=575}}\n\n===Epilogue===\nGod tells Eliphaz that he and the two other friends \"have not spoken of me what is right as my servant Job has done\". The three (Elihu, the fourth friend introduced in chapter 32 is not mentioned here) are told to make [[Burnt offering (Judaism)|a burnt offering]] with Job as their intercessor, \"for only to him will I show favour\". Job is restored to health, riches and family, and lives to see his children to the fourth generation.{{sfn|Kugler|Hartin|2009|p=33}}\n\n==Composition==\n[[File:LB100fol165.JPG|fol.165-Job.XXXVIII|thumb|Anonymous Byzantine illustration.<br>The [[Incarnation (Christianity)|pre-incarnate]] Christ speaks to Job]]\n\n===Authorship, language, texts===\nJob appears in the 6th-century BCE [[book of Ezekiel]] as a man of antiquity renowned for his righteousness, and the author of the Book of Job has apparently chosen this legendary hero for his [[parable]].{{sfn|Fokkelman|2012|p=20}} Rabbinic tradition ascribes it to [[Moses]], but scholars generally agree that it was written between the 7th and 4th centuries BCE, with the 6th century BCE as the most likely period for various reasons.{{sfn|Kugler|Hartin|2009|p=193}} The anonymous author was almost certainly an Israelite, although he has set his story outside Israel, in southern [[Edom]] or northern Arabia, and makes allusion to places as far apart as [[Mesopotamia]] and Egypt.{{sfn|Seow|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOn3ZK2n0UUC&pg=PA44 44]}}\n\nThe language of Job stands out for its conservative spelling and for its exceptionally large number of words and forms not found elsewhere in the Bible.{{sfn|Seow|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOn3ZK2n0UUC&pg=PA17 17]}} The 12th century Jewish scholar [[Abraham ibn Ezra|Ibn Ezra]] concluded that the book must have been written in some other language and translated into Hebrew,<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org/Ibn_Ezra_on_Job.2.3?lang=bi Ibn Ezra on Job 2:11]</ref> and many later scholars down to the 20th century looked for an [[Aramaic]], [[Arabic]] or [[Edomite language|Edomite]] original, but a close analysis suggests that the foreign words and foreign-looking forms are literary affectations designed to lend authenticity to the book's distant setting.{{sfn|Seow|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOn3ZK2n0UUC&pg=PA21-24 21\u201324]}}\n\nJob exists in a number of forms: the Hebrew [[Masoretic Text]], which underlies many modern Bible translations; the Greek [[Septuagint]] made in Egypt in the last centuries BCE; and Aramaic and Hebrew manuscripts found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].{{sfn|Seow|2013|pp=1\u201316}}\n\n===Job and the wisdom tradition===\nJob, [[Ecclesiastes]] and the [[Book of Proverbs]] belong to the genre of [[wisdom literature]], sharing a perspective that they themselves call the \"way of wisdom\".{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=129}} Wisdom means both a way of thinking and a body of knowledge gained through such thinking, as well as the ability to apply it to life. It is attainable in part through human effort and in part as a gift from God, but never in its entirety \u2013 except by God.{{sfn|Farmer|1998|pp=129\u201330}} The three books share attitudes and assumptions but differ in their conclusions: Proverbs makes confident statements about the world and its workings that are flatly contradicted by Job and Ecclesiastes.{{sfn|Farmer|1998|pp=130\u201331}} Wisdom literature from Sumeria and Babylonia can be dated to the second millennium BCE.{{sfn|Bullock|2007|p=84}} Several texts from ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt offer parallels to Job,{{sfn|Hartley|2008|p=346}} and while it is impossible to tell whether the author of Job was influenced by any of them, their existence suggests that he was the recipient of a long tradition of reflection on the existence of inexplicable suffering.{{sfn|Hartley|2008|p=360}}\n\n==Themes==\n[[File:Destruction of Leviathan.png|thumb|''The Destruction of Leviathan'' by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] (1865)]]\n\nJob is an investigation of the problem of divine justice.{{sfn|Bullock|2007|p=82}} This problem, known in theology as the [[problem of evil]], can be rephrased as a question: \"Why do the righteous suffer?\"{{sfn|Lawson|2005|p=11}} The conventional answer in ancient Israel was that God rewards virtue and punishes sin (the principle known as \"[[retributive justice]]\").{{sfn|Hooks|2006|p=58}} This assumes a world in which human choices and actions are morally significant, but experience demonstrates that suffering is frequently unmerited.{{sfn|Brueggemann|2002|p=201}}\n\nThe biblical concept of righteousness was rooted in the covenant-making God who had ordered creation for communal well-being, and the righteous were those who invested in the community, showing special concern for the poor and needy (see Job's description of his life in chapter 31). Their antithesis were the wicked, who were selfish and greedy.{{sfn|Brueggemann|2002|pp=177\u201378}} The Satan (or The Adversary) raises the question of whether there is such a thing as disinterested righteousness: if God rewards righteousness with prosperity, will men not act righteously from selfish motives? He asks God to test this by removing the prosperity of Job, the most righteous of all God's servants.{{sfn|Walton|2008|pp=336\u201337}}\n\nThe book begins with the frame narrative, giving the reader an omniscient \"God's eye perspective\" which introduces Job as a man of exemplary faith and piety, \"blameless and upright\", who \"fears God\" and \"shuns evil\".{{sfn|Hooks|2006|p=57}}{{sfn|O'Dowd|2008|pp=242\u201343}} The contrast between the frame and the poetic dialogues and monologues, in which Job never learns of the opening scenes in heaven or of the reason for his suffering, creates a sense of dramatic irony between the divine view of the Adversary's wager, and the human view of Job's suffering \"without any reason\" (2:3).{{sfn|O'Dowd|2008|pp=242\u201343}}\n\nIn the poetic dialogues Job's friends see his suffering and assume he must be guilty, since God is just. Job, knowing he is innocent, concludes that God must be unjust.{{sfn|Seow|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOn3ZK2n0UUC&pg=PA97-98 97\u201398]}} He retains his piety throughout the story (belying Satan's suspicion that his righteousness is due to the expectation of reward), but makes clear from his first speech that he agrees with his friends that God should and does reward righteousness.{{sfn|Kugler|Hartin|2009|p=194}} Elihu rejects the arguments of both parties: Job is wrong to accuse God of injustice, as God is greater than human beings, and nor are the friends correct; for suffering, far from being a punishment, may \"rescue the afflicted from their affliction\" and make them more amenable to revelation \u2013 literally, \"open their ears\" (36:15).{{sfn|Seow|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOn3ZK2n0UUC&pg=PA97-98 97\u201398]}}\n\nChapter 28, the Hymn to Wisdom, introduces another theme, divine wisdom. The hymn does not place any emphasis on retributive justice, stressing instead the inaccessibility of wisdom.{{sfn|Dell|2003|p=356}} Wisdom cannot be invented or purchased, it says; God alone knows the meaning of the world, and he grants it only to those who live in reverence before him.{{sfn|Hooks|2006|pp=329\u201330}} God possesses wisdom because he grasps the complexities of the world (28:24\u201326) \u2013 a theme which looks forward to God's speech in chapters 38\u201341 with its repeated refrain \"Where were you when...?\"{{sfn|Fiddes|1996|p=174}}\n\nWhen God finally speaks he neither explains the reason for Job's suffering (revealed to the reader in the prologue in heaven) nor defends his justice. The first speech focuses on his role in maintaining order in the universe: the list of things that God does and Job cannot do demonstrates divine wisdom because order is the heart of wisdom. Job then confesses his lack of wisdom, meaning his lack of understanding of the workings of the cosmos and of the ability to maintain it. The second speech concerns God's role in controlling [[behemoth]] and [[leviathan]], sometimes translated as the hippopotamus and crocodile, but more probably representing primeval cosmic creatures, in either case demonstrating God's wisdom and power.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=338}} Job's reply to God's final speech is longer than his first and more complicated. The usual view is that he admits to being wrong to challenge God and now repents \"in dust and ashes\" (42:6), but the Hebrew is difficult, and an alternative understanding is that Job says he was wrong to repent and mourn and does not retract any of his arguments.{{sfn|Sawyer|2013|p=34}} In the concluding part of the frame narrative God restores and increases his prosperity, indicating that the divine policy on retributive justice remains unchanged.{{sfn|Barton|2008|pp=338\u201339}}\n\n==Later influence and interpretation==\n[[File:Carved wooden figure of Job. Probably from Germany, 1750-1850 CE. The Wellcome Collection, London.jpg|thumb|left|Carved wooden figure of Job. Probably from Germany, 1750\u20131850 CE. The Wellcome Collection, London]]\n===History of interpretation===\nIn the [[Second Temple]] period (500 BCE \u2013 70 CE) Job began being transformed into something more patient and steadfast, with his suffering a test of virtue and a vindication of righteousness for the glory of God.{{sfn|Seow|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOn3ZK2n0UUC&pg=PA111 111]}} The process of \"sanctifying\" Job began with the Greek [[Septuagint]] translation (c. 200 BCE) and was furthered in the [[Testament of Job]] (1st century BCE \u2013 1st century CE), which makes him the hero of patience.{{sfn|Allen|2008|pp=362\u201363}} This reading pays little attention to the Job of the dialogue sections of the book,{{sfn|Dell|1991|pp=6\u20137}} but it was the tradition taken up by the [[Epistle of James]] in the [[New Testament]], which presents Job as one whose patience and endurance should be emulated by believers (James 5:7\u201311).{{sfn|Allen|2008|p=362}} When Christianity began interpreting Job 19:23\u201329 (verses concerning a \"redeemer\" whom Job hopes can save him from God) as a prophecy of Christ,{{sfn|Simonetti|Conti|Oden|2006|pp=105\u201306}} the predominant Jewish view became \"Job the blasphemer\", with some rabbis even saying that he was rightly punished by God because he had stood by while Pharaoh massacred the innocent Jewish infants.{{sfn|Allen|2008|pp=361\u201362}}{{sfn|Noegel|Wheeler|2010|p=171}}\n\n[[Augustine of Hippo]] recorded that Job had prophesied the coming of Christ, and [[Gregory the Great]] offered him as a model of right living worthy of respect. The medieval Jewish scholar [[Maimonides]] declared his story a parable, and the medieval Christian [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote a detailed commentary declaring it true history. In the Reformation [[Martin Luther]] explained how Job's confession of sinfulness and worthlessness underlay his saintliness, and [[John Calvin]]'s Job demonstrated the doctrine of the resurrection and the ultimate certainty of divine justice.{{sfn|Allen|2008|pp=368\u201371}}\n\nThe contemporary movement known as creation theology, an [[Environmental theology|ecological theology]] valuing the needs of all creation, interprets God's speeches in Job 38\u201341 to imply that his interests and actions are not exclusively focused on humankind.{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=150}}\n\n===Liturgical use===\nJewish liturgy does not use readings from the Book of Job in the manner of the [[Torah|Pentateuch]], [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], or [[Five Megillot]], although it is quoted at funerals and times of mourning. However, there are some Jews, particularly the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]], who do hold public readings of Job on the [[Tisha B'Av]] fast (a day of mourning over the destruction of the [[Solomon's Temple|First]] and [[Second Temple|Second]] [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temples]] and other tragedies). The [[cantillation]] signs for the large poetic section in the middle of the Book of Job differ from those of most of the biblical books, using a system shared with it only by [[Psalms]] and [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]].\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] reads from Job and Exodus during [[Holy Week]]. Exodus prepares for the understanding of Christ's exodus to his Father, of his fulfillment of the whole history of salvation; Job, the sufferer, is the Old Testament icon of Christ. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] reads from Job during [[Matins]] in the first two weeks of September and in the Office of the Dead, and in the revised [[Liturgy of the Hours]] Job is read during the Eighth and Ninth Weeks in [[Ordinary Time]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===In music, art, literature, and film===\n[[File:Georges de La Tour 044.jpg|thumb|[[Georges de La Tour]],<br />''Job Mocked by his Wife'']]\n\nThe Book of Job has been deeply influential in Western culture, to such an extent that no list could be more than representative. Musical settings from Job include [[Orlande de Lassus]]'s 1565 cycle of motets, the ''Sacrae Lectiones Novem ex Propheta Job'', and [[George Frideric Handel]]'s use of Job 19:25 (\"I know that my redeemer liveth\") as an aria in his 1741 oratorio ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''. Modern works based on the book include [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]'s ''[[Job: A Masque for Dancing]]'', French composer [[Darius Milhaud]]'s ''Cantata From Job'', and Joseph Stein's Broadway interpretation ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', based on an earlier Yiddish memoir by Sholem Alchem in 1894. \nJoni Mitchell composed The Sire of Sorrow (Job's Sad Song.)\nNeil Simon wrote ''[[God's Favorite]]'' which is a modern retelling of the Book of Job. Breughel and [[Georges de la Tour]] depicted Job visited by his wife, and [[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|William Blake produced an entire cycle of illustrations for the book]]. Writers Job has inspired or influenced include{{original research inline|date=May 2015}} [[John Milton]] (''[[Samson Agonistes]]''), Dostoevsky (''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''), Alfred Doblin (\"[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]\"), Franz Kafka (''[[The Trial]]''), [[Carl Jung]] (''[[Answer to Job]]''), [[Joseph Roth]] (''[[Job (novel)|Job]]''), and Bernard Malamud. Archibald MacLeish's drama, ''[[J.B. (play)|JB]]'', one of the most prominent uses of the Book of Job in modern literature, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1959. Job's influence can also be seen in the [[Coen brothers]]' 2009 film, ''[[A Serious Man]]'', which was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]. [[Terrence Malick]]'s 2011 film ''[[The Tree of Life (film)|The Tree of Life]]'', which won the [[Palme d'Or]], is heavily influenced by the themes of the Book of Job, as the film starts with a quote from the beginning of God's speech to Job. A 2014 Malayalam film called \"[[Iyobinte Pusthakam]]\" tells the story of a man who is losing everything in his life and also has parallels with Dostoevsky's (''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''). The Russian film ''[[Leviathan (2014 film)|Leviathan]]'' also draws themes from the Book of Job. In 2015 two Ukrainian composers Roman Grygoriv and Illia Razumeiko created opera-requiem [[IYOV]]. The premiere of the opera was held on 21 September 2015 on the main stage of the international multidisciplinary festival [[Gogolfest]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2015.gogolfest.org/eng/programm/1247/|title=Program 2015|author=GogolFest}}</ref>\n\n===In Islam and Arab folk tradition===\n{{Main|Job in Islam}}\nJob (Arabic ''Ayyub'' \u0627\u064a\u0648\u0628) is one of the 25 prophets mentioned by name in the [[Quran]], where he is lauded as a steadfast and upright worshiper (Q.38:44). His story has the same basic outline as in the Bible, although the three friends are replaced by his brothers, and his wife stays by his side.{{sfn|Noegel|Wheeler|2010|p=171}}{{sfn|Wheeler|2002|p=8}}\n\nIn [[Palestinian folklore]] Job's place of trial is [[Al-Jura|Al-Joura]], a village outside the town of Al Majdal ([[Ashkelon]]). It was there that God rewarded him with a [[Fountain of Youth]] that removed whatever illnesses he had and restored his youth. Al-Joura was a place of annual festivities (four days in all) when people of many faiths gathered and bathed in a natural spring. In Lebanon the Muwahideen (or [[Druze]]) community have a shrine built in the Shouf area that allegedly contains Job's tomb. In [[Turkey]], Job is known as ''Ey\u00fcp'', and he is supposed to have lived in [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa]]. There is also a tomb of Job outside the city of [[Salalah]] in Oman.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Answer to Job]]'' by Carl Jung.\n*[[Book of Job in Byzantine illuminated manuscripts]]\n*[[Commentary on Job]]\n*[[Ludlul b\u0113l n\u0113meqi]] the \"Babylonian Job\"\n*[[Testament of Job]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n\n* {{cite book\n| last = Allen\n| first = J.\n| chapter = Job III: History of Interpretation\n| editor1-last = Longman\n| editor1-first = Tremper\n| editor2-last = Enns\n| editor2-first = Peter\n| title = Dictionary of the Old Testament: Wisdom, Poetry & Writings\n| publisher = InterVarsity Press\n| year = 2008\n| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kE2k36XAkv4C&pg=PA361\n| ref = harv\n| isbn = 9780830817832\n}}\n\n* {{Cite book\n| last = Brueggemann\n| first = Walter\n| title = Reverberations of Faith: A Theological Handbook of Old Testament Themes\n| publisher = Westminster John Knox\n| year = 2002\n| url = https://books.google.com/?id=dBJQ71RIpdMC\n| isbn = 9780664222314\n| ref = harv\n}}\n\n* {{Cite book\n| last = Bullock\n| first = C.

His father\u2019s family was of [[Danube Swabians|Swabian]] peasant descent. Ker\u00e9nyi learnt German as a foreign language at school, and chose it as his language for scientific work. He identified himself with the city of [[Arad, Romania|Arad]], where he attended secondary school, because of its liberal spirits as the city of the [[The 13 Martyrs of Arad|13 martyrs of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848/49]].<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi, K.: ''Tessiner Schreibtisch (Writing Desk in Ticino)'', 1963; pp. 148ff</ref> He moved on to study classical philology at the [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University|University of Budapest]] where he mostly appreciated the teaching of the Latinist G\u00e9za N\u00e9methy as well as of the Indo-Germanist Josef Schmidt.<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi, K.: ''Tessiner Schreibtisch'', 1963; pp. 152f</ref> After graduation Ker\u00e9nyi travelled extensively in the Mediterranean region and spent time as a visiting student at the Universities of [[Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Universit\u00e4t Greifswald|Greifswald]], [[Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Ruprecht-Karls-Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], learning from the professors of antiquity and classical philology, [[Eduard Norden]], [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]] and [[Franz Boll (philologist)|Franz Boll]]. In 1919 Ker\u00e9nyi earned his doctorate in Budapest with a dissertation on ''[[Plato]] and [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]], Investigations in Classical Literary and Aesthetic History''. Subsequently he taught Greek and Latin in a secondary school. He earned his postdoctoral lecture qualification ([[habilitation]]) in 1927, and then was asked in 1934 to become a professor of classical philology and ancient history ''(Griechische und Lateinische Philologie und Alte Geschichte)'' at the [[University of P\u00e9cs]].<ref>Schlesier, R. and R. Sanchi\u00f1o Martinez (eds.): ''Neuhumanismus und Anthropologie des Griechischen [[Mythos]] \u2013 Karl Ker\u00e9nyi im Europ\u00e4ischen Kontext des 20. Jahrhunderts (Modern Humanism and Anthropology of the Greek Mythology \u2013 K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi in the European Context of the 20th Century)'', 2006; p. 203</ref> In Budapest he continued to lecture as [[privatdozent|private docent]] on the history of religions, classical literature and mythology, weekly events that were attended by many intellectuals because of their liberal connotations.<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi, K.: ''Tessiner Schreibtisch'', 1963; p. 154</ref>\n\nAfter Hungary experienced in 1940 a [[Tripartite Pact|strong move to the political right]], the University system was reformed submitting itself to political pressure. Professors who didn\u2019t subordinate themselves were concentrated at the [[University of Szeged]].<ref>Mann, T. and K. Ker\u00e9nyi: ''Gespr\u00e4ch in Briefen (Conversation in Letters)'', 1960; p. 210</ref> Correspondingly, Ker\u00e9nyi was sent there in 1941 against his will, to teach [[classical antiquity]]. The liberal, pro-western prime minister [[Mikl\u00f3s K\u00e1llay]] attempted in 1943 to reverse the Nazi-friendly politics of the prior years. He started to send liberal scientists who had already made themselves a name to Western Europe, to show that a liberal, anti-fascist Hungary also existed. As part of this push, the foreign ministry offered Ker\u00e9nyi the opportunity to spend a year in Switzerland with diplomatic status. He accepted on condition that he would stay in [[Ticino]], on the shore of [[Lago Maggiore]], instead of the capital Bern. When the Germans [[Operation Margarethe|entered Hungary in 1944]] and installed a right-wing government, Ker\u00e9nyi returned his passport. Like many other Hungarians at the time residing in Switzerland with diplomatic status, he thereby became overnight a stateless, political refugee.\n\n=== Switzerland, 1943\u20131973 ===\nSince 1941 K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi was lecturing at the [[Eranos]]-conferences in [[Ascona]] (Switzerland), to which he had been invited by [[Carl Jung|Carl Gustav Jung]]. This regular contact with the Swiss psychologist had originally established the connection to Switzerland, which ultimately led to the permanent emigration to the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino. During 1946/47 Ker\u00e9nyi lectured on Hungarian language and literature at the [[University of Basel]]. In 1947 he travelled to Hungary to give his inauguration speech at the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]], with the intent of contributing to the democratic development of Hungary. However, due to warnings of the imminent communist overthrow under [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]], Ker\u00e9nyi immediately turned around and left Budapest again. During the following Stalinist dictatorship he was discredited and banned by the political propaganda under [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]], the leading communist ideologist. His academic title was withdrawn and only as late as 1989 it was reinstated post mortem.\n\nIn Switzerland K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi wrote and published between 1945 and 1968 the substantial body of his work. Despite the fact that he can be considered an academic outsider, it was during that time that he developed his largest influence as one of the latest representatives of the great tradition of humanistic scholars of antiquity.<ref>C. Jamme in Schlesier, R. and R. Sanchi\u00f1o Martinez (eds.): ''Neuhumanismus und Anthropologie des Griechischen Mythos \u2013 Karl Ker\u00e9nyi im Europ\u00e4ischen Kontext des 20. Jahrhunderts'', 2006; p. 33</ref> Over the course of two decades, from 1934 to 1955, Ker\u00e9nyi maintained an active correspondence with the German writer [[Thomas Mann]] on many topics, including mythology, religion, humanism and psychology. Since his emigration, Ker\u00e9nyi additionally held positions as visiting professor at several universities, including [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] (1955/56), [[University of Oslo|Oslo]] and [[Sapienza University of Rome|Rome]] (1960), [[University of Zurich|Zurich]] (1961) and [[University of Genoa|Genoa]] (1964). Between 1960 and 1971 he held annual lectures at conferences of the institute of philosophy of the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]]. From 1948 until 1966 Ker\u00e9nyi was co-founder and research director at the C. G. Jung Institute in K\u00fcsnacht/Zurich, where he held lectures on mythology until 1962. During these years he lived near the [[Monte Verit\u00e0]] in Ascona. 1962 he received the Swiss citizenship.\n\nK\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi died on 14 April 1973 in [[Kilchberg, Zurich|Kilchberg/Zurich]] and is buried on the cemetery of Ascona. His second wife, Magda Ker\u00e9nyi, dedicated her subsequent life to the maintenance and promotion of Ker\u00e9nyi\u2019s legacy. Since her death in 2004 all documentation of Ker\u00e9nyi\u2019s life (photos, correspondence, manuscripts, etc.) that hadn\u2019t been destroyed in Budapest during the war, are archived and accessible at the [[Museum of Modern Literature|German Archive for Literature]] in [[Marbach am Neckar|Marbach]] (near Stuttgart). His comprehensive library and the estate of Magda Ker\u00e9nyi are at the University of P\u00e9cs, where a street has also been named after him.\n\n== Scientific work and philosophical body of thought ==\n\n=== Philological foundation ===\nIn early years K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi was mainly influenced by philosophers like [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Johann Jakob Bachofen|Bachofen]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], writers like [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin|H\u00f6lderlin]] and [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]], and scholars like [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]].<ref>C. Jamme in Schlesier, R. and R. Sanchi\u00f1o Martinez (eds.): ''Neuhumanismus und Anthropologie des Griechischen Mythos \u2013 Karl Ker\u00e9nyi im Europ\u00e4ischen Kontext des 20. Jahrhunderts'', 2006; pp. 33</ref> At the time of his studies of classical philology, [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]] was internationally the most influential philologist. However, for Ker\u00e9nyi, [[Erwin Rohde]]\u2019s line of thought on the fictional literature in antiquity was more important. This led to his first book ''Die griechisch-orientalische Romanliteratur in religionsgeschichtlicher Beleuchtung. Ein Versuch (The Greek-Oriental Romances in the Light of the History of Religions)'', with which he earned his postdoctoral qualification. Early afterwards, in 1929, Ker\u00e9nyi grew weary of the official scholarly line of philology. He increasingly saw the objective of philology in analyzing the written record of antiquity as a critical representation of real life, just like archeology is dedicated to the record of antiquity through actual touch.<ref>Mann, T. and K. Ker\u00e9nyi: ''Gespr\u00e4ch in Briefen'', 1960; p. 20</ref> The first steps away from the official line were his early books ''Apollon'' (a collection of essays) and ''Die antike Religion ([[Religion in ancient Greece|Religion in Antiquity]])''.<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi, M.: ''A bibliography of C. Ker\u00e9nyi'', 1976</ref> Throughout his life Ker\u00e9nyi explored every classical site of the entire Mediterranean and in Greece in 1929 he met for the first time [[Walter F. Otto]], who would prove to influence him greatly. Otto inspired Ker\u00e9nyi to focus on the religious element of human life in antiquity as the core element, thereby combining the historical with the [[comparative religion|theological focus]]. This is highlighted in his works ''Mythologie der Griechen'' and ''Mysterien der Eleusis (Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter)''.\n\n=== Dissociation from Wilamowitz and the German idea of ''myth'' ===\nThereafter K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi consciously started to distance himself from the philology taught by Wilamowitz.<ref>Mann, T. and K. Ker\u00e9nyi: ''Gespr\u00e4ch in Briefen'', 1960; p. 102</ref> In Ker\u00e9nyi\u2019s understanding Wilamowitz\u2019 approach stood for an [[authoritarianism]] that lay beneath the emergence of [[National Socialism]] in Germany, which he couldn\u2019t ethically support.<ref>Graf F., in Schlesier, R. and R. Sanchi\u00f1o Martinez (eds.): ''Neuhumanismus und Anthropologie des Griechischen Mythos \u2013 Karl Ker\u00e9nyi im Europ\u00e4ischen Kontext des 20. Jahrhunderts'', 2006; p. 82</ref> Ker\u00e9nyi hence developed an increasingly hostile position towards the German idea of myth, which was used as reference by Nazi-Germany.<ref>Mann, T. and K. Ker\u00e9nyi: ''Gespr\u00e4ch in Briefen'', 1960; pp. 21</ref> As early as 1934 he expressed his clear-sighted horror at the radicalizing developments in Germany.<ref>Mann, T. and K. Ker\u00e9nyi: ''Gespr\u00e4ch in Briefen'', 1960; p. 59</ref> It became a continuous objective of Ker\u00e9nyi to establish a liberal and human-psychological idea of myth that could not be abused for [[Nationalism|nationalistic ideology]]. This also influenced his position towards several of his scientific mentors.<ref name=\"NZZ\">Graf F., in Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung: ''Philologe, Mythologe, Humanist \u2013 Vor hundert Jahren wurde Karl Ker\u00e9nyi geboren'', 18/19 January 1997</ref> With regards to Wilamowitz this was most pronounced, but later Ker\u00e9nyi also started to distance himself from those aspects in Otto\u2019s and Mann\u2019s understanding of myth that he saw reflected in German nationalism.<ref>With respect to Wilamowitz: Mann, T. and K. Ker\u00e9nyi: ''Gespr\u00e4ch in Briefen'', 1960; pp. 59 and pp. 102. With regards to Otto: Graf F. in Schlesier, R. and R. Sanchi\u00f1o Martinez (eds.): ''Neuhumanismus und Anthropologie des Griechischen Mythos \u2013 Karl Ker\u00e9nyi im Europ\u00e4ischen Kontext des 20. Jahrhunderts'', 2006; p. 77. With regards to Mann: Edler M. in Schlesier, R. and R. Sanchi\u00f1o Martinez (eds.): ''Neuhumanismus und Anthropologie des Griechischen Mythos \u2013 Karl Ker\u00e9nyi im Europ\u00e4ischen Kontext des 20. Jahrhunderts'', 2006; p. 46</ref>\n\n=== Psychological expansion of mythology ===\nK\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi\u2019s scientific interpretation of the figures of Greek mythology as archetypes of the human soul was in line with the approach of the Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung. Together with Jung he endeavored to establish mythology as a science in its own right.<ref name=\"NZZ\"/> Jung described Ker\u00e9nyi as having \"supplied such a wealth of connections [of psychology] with Greek mythology that the cross-fertilization of the two branches of science can no longer be doubted.\"<ref name=\"Jung2015\">{{cite book|last=Jung|first=C.G. |title=Collected Works of C.G. Jung: The First Complete English Edition of the Works of C.G. Jung|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9eY4CQAAQBAJ&pg=PA8321|year=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-53016-9|page=8321}}</ref> Ker\u00e9nyi compiled in collaboration with Jung the two editions ''Das g\u00f6ttliche Kind in mythologischer und psychologischer Beleuchtung (The Myths of the Divine Child)'' and ''Das g\u00f6ttliche M\u00e4dchen (The Divine Maiden)'', which were published together under the title ''Einf\u00fchrung in das Wesen der Mythologie (Essays on a Science of Mythology)'' in 1941.<ref name=\"NZZ\"/> Ker\u00e9nyi saw the theory of religion as a human and humanistic topic which coined his reputation as [[Humanism|humanist]] further.<ref>Mann, T. and K. Ker\u00e9nyi: ''Gespr\u00e4ch in Briefen'', 1960; p. 43</ref> So for him every view of mythology had to be a view of man \u2013 and hence ''theology'' always had to be at the same time ''anthropology''.<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi, M: ''A bibliography of C. Ker\u00e9nyi'', 1976</ref> In this humanist spirit Ker\u00e9nyi defined himself as ''philological-historical'' '''''as well as''''' ''psychological scholar''.<ref>Mann, T. and K. Ker\u00e9nyi: ''Gespr\u00e4ch in Briefen'', 1960; p. 29</ref> In later years Ker\u00e9nyi evolved his psychological interpretation further and replaced the concept of archetypes with one that he labeled ''\u2019Urbild\u2019''. This became particularly clear in some of his most important publications: ''[[Prometheus]]'' as well as especially in ''[[Dionysus|Dionysos]]'', likely Ker\u00e9nyi\u2019s most crucial work, which he had started as idea in 1931 and finished writing in 1969.<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi, K: ''Dionysos \u2013 Urbild des unzerst\u00f6rbaren Lebens (Dionysos: Archetypal Image of Indestructible Life)'', 1976; Inside cover</ref> Ker\u00e9nyi hence looked at the appearances in Greek religion not as curiosities, but as expressions of real human experience. As a historian of myth as it was embedded in the details of Hellenic culture, its \"characteristic social existence\" as he put it, Ker\u00e9nyi opposed his \"differentiated thinking about the concrete realities of human life\" with the \"summary thinking\" that represented for him the influence of Sir [[James Frazer]] on the study of the peoples of [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] and [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greek religion]] especially.<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi, K: ''Dionysos \u2013 Urbild des unzerst\u00f6rbaren Lebens'', 1976; Preface p. xxvii</ref>\n\n=== Ker\u00e9nyi as cultural anthropologist ===\nNot least as a result of his own personal experience, K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi highlighted the role of the philologist as ''interpreter'', whereby \"the better he interprets, the more he becomes himself the subject, both as receiver as well as messenger. His whole essence and being, his structure and his own experiences, become a factor that cannot be overlooked for interpretation.\u201d<ref>Translated from: Mann, T. and K. Ker\u00e9nyi: ''Gespr\u00e4ch in Briefen'', 1960; p. 31</ref> In this sense Ker\u00e9nyi\u2019s understanding of science was very modern in 1944. In a time when human sciences were trying to establish themselves as objective-scientific, he recognized that the only means by which to achieve scientific objectivity was by disclosing each scholar's own individual subjectivity.<ref name=\"NZZ\"/> Ker\u00e9nyi also anticipated a paradigm shift of the late 20th century, by subscribing to an interdisciplinary approach that combined the subjects of human sciences including literature, art, history, philosophy and religion.<ref>Schlesier, R. and R. Sanchi\u00f1o Martinez (eds.): ''Neuhumanismus und Anthropologie des Griechischen Mythos \u2013 Karl Ker\u00e9nyi im Europ\u00e4ischen Kontext des 20. Jahrhunderts'', 2006; p. 11</ref> The inclusion of fictional writing into his studies of mythology and humanism is also documented by the publications of his correspondence with Thomas Mann and [[Hermann Hesse]]. Ker\u00e9nyi published a further series of thoughts on European humanism in 1955 with the title ''Geistiger Weg Europas (Europe\u2019s Intellectual Journey)''. Among the numerous personalities with whom Ker\u00e9nyi maintained important personal and scholarly interaction were the Hungarian poets [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 N\u00e9meth]], [[Antal Szerb]] and P\u00e1l Guly\u00e1s, the psychologist [[Leopold Szondi]], the writer Otto Heuschele and the historian [[Carl Jacob Burckhardt]]. Thanks to his essay-style, Ker\u00e9nyi managed to speak a language that was approachable for many people outside the academic world, but it also meant he remained relatively isolated in academic philology.\n\nIn Hungary K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi\u2019s scientific achievements remained during his lifetime only known to a small circle of intellectuals. Of all his publications only few have been published in Hungarian. As a prominent member of the former Hungarian intellectual establishment and the bearer of an aristocratic name, he was banished from Hungarian cultural life since the 1940s as being too liberal, first by the right-wing pro-Nazi governments, later by the communist regime. Even though Ker\u00e9nyi was fiercely defended by famous Hungarian writers like Laszlo N\u00e9meth and Antal Szerb, it took until the 1980s before his complete moral and scholarly rehabilitation took place.<ref>Monostori, I . in Schlesier, R. and R. Sanchi\u00f1o Martinez (eds.): ''Neuhumanismus und Anthropologie des Griechischen Mythos \u2013 Karl Ker\u00e9nyi im Europ\u00e4ischen Kontext des 20. Jahrhunderts'', 2006; pp. 161</ref> The Hungarian writer Antal Szerb has modeled some features of K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi into the figure Rudi Waldheim in his novel ''Reise im Mondlicht (Journey in the Moonlight)''.\n\n== Honors and awards ==\n* 1929: Scholarship at the German Archeological Institute in Athens\n* 1931: Medal of Honor of [[George I of Greece]]\n* 1946: [[Baumgarten Prize]]\n* 1947: Fellowship of the [[Bollingen Foundation]] (maintained until 1973)\n* 1961: Member of the [[Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters]]\n* 1963: Honorary doctorate of the Theological Faculty of the [[University of Uppsala]]\n* 1969: Goldmedal of the Humboldt Society\n* 1970: [[Willibald Pirckheimer|Pirckheimer]]-Ring of the City of [[Nuremberg]]\n* 1989: Post mortem: Member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]\n* 1990: [[Sz\u00e9chenyi Prize]] of the Hungarian Government\n\n== Works and publications ==\n'''First editions:'''\n* ''Apollon.

His father\u2019s family was of [[Danube Swabians|Swabian]] peasant descent. Ker\u00e9nyi learnt German as a foreign language at school, and chose it as his language for scientific work. He identified himself with the city of [[Arad, Romania|Arad]], where he attended secondary school, because of its liberal spirits as the city of the [[The 13 Martyrs of Arad|13 martyrs of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848/49]].<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi, K.: ''Tessiner Schreibtisch (Writing Desk in Ticino)'', 1963; pp. 148ff</ref> He moved on to study classical philology at the [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University|University of Budapest]] where he mostly appreciated the teaching of the Latinist G\u00e9za N\u00e9methy as well as of the Indo-Germanist Josef Schmidt.<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi, K.: ''Tessiner Schreibtisch'', 1963; pp. 152f</ref> After graduation Ker\u00e9nyi travelled extensively in the Mediterranean region and spent time as a visiting student at the Universities of [[Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Universit\u00e4t Greifswald|Greifswald]], [[Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Ruprecht-Karls-Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], learning from the professors of antiquity and classical philology, [[Eduard Norden]], [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]] and [[Franz Boll (philologist)|Franz Boll]]. In 1919 Ker\u00e9nyi earned his doctorate in Budapest with a dissertation on ''[[Plato]] and [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]], Investigations in Classical Literary and Aesthetic History''. Subsequently he taught Greek and Latin in a secondary school. He earned his postdoctoral lecture qualification ([[habilitation]]) in 1927, and then was asked in 1934 to become a professor of classical philology and ancient history ''(Griechische und Lateinische Philologie und Alte Geschichte)'' at the [[University of P\u00e9cs]].<ref>Schlesier, R. and R. Sanchi\u00f1o Martinez (eds.): ''Neuhumanismus und Anthropologie des Griechischen [[Mythos]] \u2013 Karl Ker\u00e9nyi im Europ\u00e4ischen Kontext des 20. Jahrhunderts (Modern Humanism and Anthropology of the Greek Mythology \u2013 K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi in the European Context of the 20th Century)'', 2006; p. 203</ref> In Budapest he continued to lecture as [[privatdozent|private docent]] on the history of religions, classical literature and mythology, weekly events that were attended by many intellectuals because of their liberal connotations.<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi, K.: ''Tessiner Schreibtisch'', 1963; p. 154</ref>\n\nAfter Hungary experienced in 1940 a [[Tripartite Pact|strong move to the political right]], the University system was reformed submitting itself to political pressure. Professors who didn\u2019t subordinate themselves were concentrated at the [[University of Szeged]].<ref>Mann, T. and K. Ker\u00e9nyi: ''Gespr\u00e4ch in Briefen (Conversation in Letters)'', 1960; p. 210</ref> Correspondingly, Ker\u00e9nyi was sent there in 1941 against his will, to teach [[classical antiquity]]. The liberal, pro-western prime minister [[Mikl\u00f3s K\u00e1llay]] attempted in 1943 to reverse the Nazi-friendly politics of the prior years. He started to send liberal scientists who had already made themselves a name to Western Europe, to show that a liberal, anti-fascist Hungary also existed. As part of this push, the foreign ministry offered Ker\u00e9nyi the opportunity to spend a year in Switzerland with diplomatic status. He accepted on condition that he would stay in [[Ticino]], on the shore of [[Lago Maggiore]], instead of the capital Bern. When the Germans [[Operation Margarethe|entered Hungary in 1944]] and installed a right-wing government, Ker\u00e9nyi returned his passport. Like many other Hungarians at the time residing in Switzerland with diplomatic status, he thereby became overnight a stateless, political refugee.\n\n=== Switzerland, 1943\u20131973 ===\nSince 1941 K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi was lecturing at the [[Eranos]]-conferences in [[Ascona]] (Switzerland), to which he had been invited by [[Carl Jung|Carl Gustav Jung]]. This regular contact with the Swiss psychologist had originally established the connection to Switzerland, which ultimately led to the permanent emigration to the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino. During 1946/47 Ker\u00e9nyi lectured on Hungarian language and literature at the [[University of Basel]]. In 1947 he travelled to Hungary to give his inauguration speech at the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]], with the intent of contributing to the democratic development of Hungary. However, due to warnings of the imminent communist overthrow under [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]], Ker\u00e9nyi immediately turned around and left Budapest again. During the following Stalinist dictatorship he was discredited and banned by the political propaganda under [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]], the leading communist ideologist. His academic title was withdrawn and only as late as 1989 it was reinstated post mortem.\n\nIn Switzerland K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi wrote and published between 1945 and 1968 the substantial body of his work. Despite the fact that he can be considered an academic outsider, it was during that time that he developed his largest influence as one of the latest representatives of the great tradition of humanistic scholars of antiquity.<ref>C.

Jahrhunderts'', 2006; p. 33</ref> Over the course of two decades, from 1934 to 1955, Ker\u00e9nyi maintained an active correspondence with the German writer [[Thomas Mann]] on many topics, including mythology, religion, humanism and psychology. Since his emigration, Ker\u00e9nyi additionally held positions as visiting professor at several universities, including [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] (1955/56), [[University of Oslo|Oslo]] and [[Sapienza University of Rome|Rome]] (1960), [[University of Zurich|Zurich]] (1961) and [[University of Genoa|Genoa]] (1964). Between 1960 and 1971 he held annual lectures at conferences of the institute of philosophy of the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]]. From 1948 until 1966 Ker\u00e9nyi was co-founder and research director at the C. G. Jung Institute in K\u00fcsnacht/Zurich, where he held lectures on mythology until 1962. During these years he lived near the [[Monte Verit\u00e0]] in Ascona. 1962 he received the Swiss citizenship.\n\nK\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi died on 14 April 1973 in [[Kilchberg, Zurich|Kilchberg/Zurich]] and is buried on the cemetery of Ascona. His second wife, Magda Ker\u00e9nyi, dedicated her subsequent life to the maintenance and promotion of Ker\u00e9nyi\u2019s legacy. Since her death in 2004 all documentation of Ker\u00e9nyi\u2019s life (photos, correspondence, manuscripts, etc.) that hadn\u2019t been destroyed in Budapest during the war, are archived and accessible at the [[Museum of Modern Literature|German Archive for Literature]] in [[Marbach am Neckar|Marbach]] (near Stuttgart). His comprehensive library and the estate of Magda Ker\u00e9nyi are at the University of P\u00e9cs, where a street has also been named after him.\n\n== Scientific work and philosophical body of thought ==\n\n=== Philological foundation ===\nIn early years K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi was mainly influenced by philosophers like [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Johann Jakob Bachofen|Bachofen]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], writers like [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin|H\u00f6lderlin]] and [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]], and scholars like [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]].<ref>C. Jamme in Schlesier, R. and R. Sanchi\u00f1o Martinez (eds.): ''Neuhumanismus und Anthropologie des Griechischen Mythos \u2013 Karl Ker\u00e9nyi im Europ\u00e4ischen Kontext des 20. Jahrhunderts'', 2006; pp. 33</ref> At the time of his studies of classical philology, [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]] was internationally the most influential philologist. However, for Ker\u00e9nyi, [[Erwin Rohde]]\u2019s line of thought on the fictional literature in antiquity was more important. This led to his first book ''Die griechisch-orientalische Romanliteratur in religionsgeschichtlicher Beleuchtung. Ein Versuch (The Greek-Oriental Romances in the Light of the History of Religions)'', with which he earned his postdoctoral qualification. Early afterwards, in 1929, Ker\u00e9nyi grew weary of the official scholarly line of philology. He increasingly saw the objective of philology in analyzing the written record of antiquity as a critical representation of real life, just like archeology is dedicated to the record of antiquity through actual touch.<ref>Mann, T. and K. Ker\u00e9nyi: ''Gespr\u00e4ch in Briefen'', 1960; p. 20</ref> The first steps away from the official line were his early books ''Apollon'' (a collection of essays) and ''Die antike Religion ([[Religion in ancient Greece|Religion in Antiquity]])''.<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi, M.: ''A bibliography of C. Ker\u00e9nyi'', 1976</ref> Throughout his life Ker\u00e9nyi explored every classical site of the entire Mediterranean and in Greece in 1929 he met for the first time [[Walter F. Otto]], who would prove to influence him greatly. Otto inspired Ker\u00e9nyi to focus on the religious element of human life in antiquity as the core element, thereby combining the historical with the [[comparative religion|theological focus]]. This is highlighted in his works ''Mythologie der Griechen'' and ''Mysterien der Eleusis (Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter)''.\n\n=== Dissociation from Wilamowitz and the German idea of ''myth'' ===\nThereafter K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi consciously started to distance himself from the philology taught by Wilamowitz.<ref>Mann, T. and K. Ker\u00e9nyi: ''Gespr\u00e4ch in Briefen'', 1960; p. 102</ref> In Ker\u00e9nyi\u2019s understanding Wilamowitz\u2019 approach stood for an [[authoritarianism]] that lay beneath the emergence of [[National Socialism]] in Germany, which he couldn\u2019t ethically support.<ref>Graf F., in Schlesier, R. and R. Sanchi\u00f1o Martinez (eds.): ''Neuhumanismus und Anthropologie des Griechischen Mythos \u2013 Karl Ker\u00e9nyi im Europ\u00e4ischen Kontext des 20. Jahrhunderts'', 2006; p. 82</ref> Ker\u00e9nyi hence developed an increasingly hostile position towards the German idea of myth, which was used as reference by Nazi-Germany.<ref>Mann, T. and K. Ker\u00e9nyi: ''Gespr\u00e4ch in Briefen'', 1960; pp. 21</ref> As early as 1934 he expressed his clear-sighted horror at the radicalizing developments in Germany.<ref>Mann, T. and K. Ker\u00e9nyi: ''Gespr\u00e4ch in Briefen'', 1960; p. 59</ref> It became a continuous objective of Ker\u00e9nyi to establish a liberal and human-psychological idea of myth that could not be abused for [[Nationalism|nationalistic ideology]]. This also influenced his position towards several of his scientific mentors.<ref name=\"NZZ\">Graf F., in Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung: ''Philologe, Mythologe, Humanist \u2013 Vor hundert Jahren wurde Karl Ker\u00e9nyi geboren'', 18/19 January 1997</ref> With regards to Wilamowitz this was most pronounced, but later Ker\u00e9nyi also started to distance himself from those aspects in Otto\u2019s and Mann\u2019s understanding of myth that he saw reflected in German nationalism.<ref>With respect to Wilamowitz: Mann, T. and K. Ker\u00e9nyi: ''Gespr\u00e4ch in Briefen'', 1960; pp. 59 and pp. 102. With regards to Otto: Graf F. in Schlesier, R. and R. Sanchi\u00f1o Martinez (eds.): ''Neuhumanismus und Anthropologie des Griechischen Mythos \u2013 Karl Ker\u00e9nyi im Europ\u00e4ischen Kontext des 20. Jahrhunderts'', 2006; p. 77. With regards to Mann: Edler M. in Schlesier, R. and R. Sanchi\u00f1o Martinez (eds.): ''Neuhumanismus und Anthropologie des Griechischen Mythos \u2013 Karl Ker\u00e9nyi im Europ\u00e4ischen Kontext des 20. Jahrhunderts'', 2006; p. 46</ref>\n\n=== Psychological expansion of mythology ===\nK\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi\u2019s scientific interpretation of the figures of Greek mythology as archetypes of the human soul was in line with the approach of the Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung. Together with Jung he endeavored to establish mythology as a science in its own right.<ref name=\"NZZ\"/> Jung described Ker\u00e9nyi as having \"supplied such a wealth of connections [of psychology] with Greek mythology that the cross-fertilization of the two branches of science can no longer be doubted.\"<ref name=\"Jung2015\">{{cite book|last=Jung|first=C.G. |title=Collected Works of C.G. Jung: The First Complete English Edition of the Works of C.G. Jung|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9eY4CQAAQBAJ&pg=PA8321|year=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-53016-9|page=8321}}</ref> Ker\u00e9nyi compiled in collaboration with Jung the two editions ''Das g\u00f6ttliche Kind in mythologischer und psychologischer Beleuchtung (The Myths of the Divine Child)'' and ''Das g\u00f6ttliche M\u00e4dchen (The Divine Maiden)'', which were published together under the title ''Einf\u00fchrung in das Wesen der Mythologie (Essays on a Science of Mythology)'' in 1941.<ref name=\"NZZ\"/> Ker\u00e9nyi saw the theory of religion as a human and humanistic topic which coined his reputation as [[Humanism|humanist]] further.<ref>Mann, T. and K. Ker\u00e9nyi: ''Gespr\u00e4ch in Briefen'', 1960; p. 43</ref> So for him every view of mythology had to be a view of man \u2013 and hence ''theology'' always had to be at the same time ''anthropology''.<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi, M: ''A bibliography of C. Ker\u00e9nyi'', 1976</ref> In this humanist spirit Ker\u00e9nyi defined himself as ''philological-historical'' '''''as well as''''' ''psychological scholar''.<ref>Mann, T. and K. Ker\u00e9nyi: ''Gespr\u00e4ch in Briefen'', 1960; p. 29</ref> In later years Ker\u00e9nyi evolved his psychological interpretation further and replaced the concept of archetypes with one that he labeled ''\u2019Urbild\u2019''. This became particularly clear in some of his most important publications: ''[[Prometheus]]'' as well as especially in ''[[Dionysus|Dionysos]]'', likely Ker\u00e9nyi\u2019s most crucial work, which he had started as idea in 1931 and finished writing in 1969.<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi, K: ''Dionysos \u2013 Urbild des unzerst\u00f6rbaren Lebens (Dionysos: Archetypal Image of Indestructible Life)'', 1976; Inside cover</ref> Ker\u00e9nyi hence looked at the appearances in Greek religion not as curiosities, but as expressions of real human experience. As a historian of myth as it was embedded in the details of Hellenic culture, its \"characteristic social existence\" as he put it, Ker\u00e9nyi opposed his \"differentiated thinking about the concrete realities of human life\" with the \"summary thinking\" that represented for him the influence of Sir [[James Frazer]] on the study of the peoples of [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] and [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greek religion]] especially.<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi, K: ''Dionysos \u2013 Urbild des unzerst\u00f6rbaren Lebens'', 1976; Preface p. xxvii</ref>\n\n=== Ker\u00e9nyi as cultural anthropologist ===\nNot least as a result of his own personal experience, K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi highlighted the role of the philologist as ''interpreter'', whereby \"the better he interprets, the more he becomes himself the subject, both as receiver as well as messenger. His whole essence and being, his structure and his own experiences, become a factor that cannot be overlooked for interpretation.\u201d<ref>Translated from: Mann, T. and K. Ker\u00e9nyi: ''Gespr\u00e4ch in Briefen'', 1960; p. 31</ref> In this sense Ker\u00e9nyi\u2019s understanding of science was very modern in 1944. In a time when human sciences were trying to establish themselves as objective-scientific, he recognized that the only means by which to achieve scientific objectivity was by disclosing each scholar's own individual subjectivity.<ref name=\"NZZ\"/> Ker\u00e9nyi also anticipated a paradigm shift of the late 20th century, by subscribing to an interdisciplinary approach that combined the subjects of human sciences including literature, art, history, philosophy and religion.<ref>Schlesier, R. and R. Sanchi\u00f1o Martinez (eds.): ''Neuhumanismus und Anthropologie des Griechischen Mythos \u2013 Karl Ker\u00e9nyi im Europ\u00e4ischen Kontext des 20. Jahrhunderts'', 2006; p. 11</ref> The inclusion of fictional writing into his studies of mythology and humanism is also documented by the publications of his correspondence with Thomas Mann and [[Hermann Hesse]]. Ker\u00e9nyi published a further series of thoughts on European humanism in 1955 with the title ''Geistiger Weg Europas (Europe\u2019s Intellectual Journey)''. Among the numerous personalities with whom Ker\u00e9nyi maintained important personal and scholarly interaction were the Hungarian poets [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 N\u00e9meth]], [[Antal Szerb]] and P\u00e1l Guly\u00e1s, the psychologist [[Leopold Szondi]], the writer Otto Heuschele and the historian [[Carl Jacob Burckhardt]]. Thanks to his essay-style, Ker\u00e9nyi managed to speak a language that was approachable for many people outside the academic world, but it also meant he remained relatively isolated in academic philology.\n\nIn Hungary K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi\u2019s scientific achievements remained during his lifetime only known to a small circle of intellectuals. Of all his publications only few have been published in Hungarian. As a prominent member of the former Hungarian intellectual establishment and the bearer of an aristocratic name, he was banished from Hungarian cultural life since the 1940s as being too liberal, first by the right-wing pro-Nazi governments, later by the communist regime. Even though Ker\u00e9nyi was fiercely defended by famous Hungarian writers like Laszlo N\u00e9meth and Antal Szerb, it took until the 1980s before his complete moral and scholarly rehabilitation took place.<ref>Monostori, I . in Schlesier, R. and R. Sanchi\u00f1o Martinez (eds.): ''Neuhumanismus und Anthropologie des Griechischen Mythos \u2013 Karl Ker\u00e9nyi im Europ\u00e4ischen Kontext des 20. Jahrhunderts'', 2006; pp. 161</ref> The Hungarian writer Antal Szerb has modeled some features of K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi into the figure Rudi Waldheim in his novel ''Reise im Mondlicht (Journey in the Moonlight)''.\n\n== Honors and awards ==\n* 1929: Scholarship at the German Archeological Institute in Athens\n* 1931: Medal of Honor of [[George I of Greece]]\n* 1946: [[Baumgarten Prize]]\n* 1947: Fellowship of the [[Bollingen Foundation]] (maintained until 1973)\n* 1961: Member of the [[Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters]]\n* 1963: Honorary doctorate of the Theological Faculty of the [[University of Uppsala]]\n* 1969: Goldmedal of the Humboldt Society\n* 1970: [[Willibald Pirckheimer|Pirckheimer]]-Ring of the City of [[Nuremberg]]\n* 1989: Post mortem: Member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]\n* 1990: [[Sz\u00e9chenyi Prize]] of the Hungarian Government\n\n== Works and publications ==\n'''First editions:'''\n* ''Apollon.
