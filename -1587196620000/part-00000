Dynamic and differencing VHDs begin with a copy of the VHD footer (padded to 512 bytes), and for dynamic or differencing VHDs created by Microsoft products this results in a VHD-cookie string ''<abbr title=\"'connectix', trimmed to eight characters\">conectix</abbr>'' at the beginning of the VHD file.<ref name=\"spec\" />\n* Differencing hard disk image: a set of modified blocks (maintained in a separate file referred to as the \"child image\") in comparison to a parent image. The Differencing hard disk image format allows the concept of ''Undo Changes'': when enabled, all changes to a hard drive contained within a VHD (the parent image) are stored in a separate file (the child image). Options are available to undo the changes to the VHD, or to merge them permanently into the VHD. Different child images based on the same parent image also allow \"cloning\" of VHDs; at least the [[globally unique identifier]] (GUID) must be different.\n* Linked to a hard disk (aka pass-through): a file that contains a link to a physical hard drive or partition of a physical hard drive.\n\n=== Advantages ===\n\nSignificant benefits result from the ability to boot a physical computer from a virtual hard drive:\n\n* Ease of deployment: IT organizations can deploy standardized, 'pre-built' configurations on a single VHD. As an example, software engineering organizations that need a specific set of tools for a particular project could simply 'pull' the appropriately-configured VHD from a network location.\n* Backup-and-Restore: Changes to the contents of a VHD (such as infection by a virus, or accidental deletion of critical files) are easily undone.\n* Multi-User Isolation: Many current operating systems support having multiple users, but offer varying degrees of protection between them (e.g., one user of the OS could become infected by a virus that infects other users, or make changes to the OS that affect other users).

In addition to a [[wavefunction]] on the space of all possible configurations, it also postulates an actual configuration that exists even when unobserved. The evolution over time of the configuration (that is, the positions of all particles or the configuration of all fields) is defined by the wave function by a [[#Guiding equation|guiding equation]]. The evolution of the wave function over time is given by the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]. The theory is named after [[Louis de Broglie]] (1892\u20131987) and [[David Bohm]] (1917\u20131992).\n\nThe theory is [[deterministic system|deterministic]]<ref>{{Cite journal| first = David | last = Bohm | title = A Suggested Interpretation of the Quantum Theory in Terms of 'Hidden Variables' I | journal = Physical Review | year = 1952 | volume = 85 | issue = 2 | pages = 166\u2013179 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.85.166|bibcode = 1952PhRv...85..166B }} (\"In contrast to the usual interpretation, this alternative interpretation permits us to conceive of each individual system as being in a precisely definable state, whose changes with time are determined by definite laws, analogous to (but not identical with) the classical equations of motion.

The theory's explicit non-locality resolves the \"[[measurement problem]]\", which is conventionally delegated to the topic of [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]] in the Copenhagen interpretation.\nThe [[Born rule]] in Broglie\u2013Bohm theory is not a basic law. Rather, in this theory, the link between the probability density and the wave function has the status of a hypothesis, called the [[quantum equilibrium hypothesis]], which is additional to the basic principles governing the wave function.\n\nThe theory was historically developed in the 1920s by de Broglie, who, in 1927, was persuaded to abandon it in favour of the then-mainstream Copenhagen interpretation. David Bohm, dissatisfied with the prevailing orthodoxy, rediscovered de Broglie's pilot-wave theory in 1952. Bohm's suggestions were not then widely received, partly due to reasons unrelated to their content, but instead were connected to Bohm's youthful [[communist]] affiliations.<ref>F. David Peat, ''Infinite Potential: The Life and Times of David Bohm'' (1997), p. 133. James T. Cushing, ''Quantum Mechanics: Historical Contingency and the Copenhagen Hegemony'' (1994) discusses \"the hegemony of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics\" over theories like Bohmian mechanics as an example of how the acceptance of scientific theories may be guided by social aspects.</ref> De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory was widely deemed unacceptable by mainstream theorists, mostly because of its explicit non-locality. [[Bell's theorem]] (1964) was inspired by Bell's discovery of the Bohm's work; he wondered whether the theory's obvious nonlocality could be eliminated. Since the 1990s, there has been renewed interest in formulating extensions to de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, attempting to reconcile it with [[special relativity]] and [[quantum field theory]], besides other features such as spin or curved spatial geometries.<ref>David Bohm and Basil J.

The configuration space is different for different versions of pilot-wave theory. For example, this may be the space of positions <math>\\mathbf{Q}_k</math> of <math>N</math> particles, or, in case of field theory, the space of field configurations <math>\\phi(x)</math>. The configuration evolves (for spin=0) according to the guiding equation\n::<math>m_k \\frac{d q^k}{dt}(t) = \\hbar \\nabla_k \\operatorname{Im} \\ln\\psi(q,t) = \\hbar \\operatorname{Im}\\left(\\frac{\\nabla_k \\psi}{\\psi}\\right)(q, t) = \\frac{m_k \\mathbf{j}_k}{\\psi^*\\psi} = \\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{\\hat P}_k\\Psi}{\\Psi}\\right), </math>\n:where <math>\\mathbf{j}</math> is the [[probability current]] or probability flux, and <math>\\mathbf{\\hat P}</math> is the [[momentum operator]]. Here, <math>\\psi(q,t)</math> is the standard complex-valued wavefunction known from quantum theory, which evolves according to [[Schr\u00f6dinger's equation]]\n::<math>i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\psi(q,t) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_i}\\nabla_i^2\\psi(q,t) + V(q)\\psi(q,t).</math>\n:This already completes the specification of the theory for any quantum theory with Hamilton operator of type <math>H =\\sum \\frac{1}{2m_i}\\hat{p}_i^2 + V(\\hat{q})</math>.\n* The configuration is distributed according to <math>|\\psi(q,t)|^2</math> at some moment of time <math>t</math>, and this consequently holds for all times. Such a state is named quantum equilibrium. With quantum equilibrium, this theory agrees with the results of standard quantum mechanics.\n\nNotably, even though this latter relation is frequently presented as an axiom of the theory, in Bohm's original papers of 1952 it was presented as derivable from statistical-mechanical arguments. This argument was further supported by the work of Bohm in 1953 and was substantiated by Vigier and Bohm's paper of 1954, in which they introduced stochastic ''fluid fluctuations'' that drive a process of asymptotic relaxation from [[quantum non-equilibrium]] to quantum equilibrium (\u03c1 \u2192 |\u03c8|<sup>2</sup>).<ref>Publications of D.

A similar pattern was also extrapolated from [[weak measurement]]s of single photons.<ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6034/1170.figures-only \"Observing the Average Trajectories of Single Photons in a Two-Slit Interferometer\"]</ref>]]\n\nThe [[double-slit experiment]] is an illustration of [[wave-particle duality]]. In it, a beam of particles (such as electrons) travels through a barrier that has two slits. If one puts a detector screen on the side beyond the barrier, the pattern of detected particles shows interference fringes characteristic of waves arriving at the screen from two sources (the two slits); however, the interference pattern is made up of individual dots corresponding to particles that had arrived on the screen. The system seems to exhibit the behaviour of both waves (interference patterns) and particles (dots on the screen).\n\nIf we modify this experiment so that one slit is closed, no interference pattern is observed. Thus, the state of both slits affects the final results. We can also arrange to have a minimally invasive detector at one of the slits to detect which slit the particle went through. When we do that, the interference pattern disappears.\n\nThe [[Copenhagen interpretation]] states that the particles are not localised in space until they are detected, so that, if there is no detector on the slits, there is no information about which slit the particle has passed through. If one slit has a detector on it, then the wavefunction collapses due to that detection.\n\nIn de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, the wavefunction is defined at both slits, but each particle has a well-defined trajectory that passes through exactly one of the slits. The final position of the particle on the detector screen and the slit through which the particle passes is determined by the initial position of the particle. Such initial position is not knowable or controllable by the experimenter, so there is an appearance of randomness in the pattern of detection. In Bohm's 1952 papers he used the wavefunction to construct a quantum potential that, when included in Newton's equations, gave the trajectories of the particles streaming through the two slits. In effect the wavefunction interferes with itself and guides the particles by the quantum potential in such a way that the particles avoid the regions in which the interference is destructive and are attracted to the regions in which the interference is constructive, resulting in the interference pattern on the detector screen.\n\nTo explain the behavior when the particle is detected to go through one slit, one needs to appreciate the role of the conditional wavefunction and how it results in the collapse of the wavefunction; this is explained below. The basic idea is that the environment registering the detection effectively separates the two wave packets in configuration space.\n\nAn experiment was conducted in 2016 which demonstrated the potential validity of the de-Broglie-Bohm theory via use of silicone oil droplets. In this experiment a drop of silicone oil is placed into a vibrating fluid bath, it then bounces across the bath propelled by waves produced by its own collisions, mimicking an electron's statistical behavior with remarkable accuracy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=MacIsaac|first=Dan|date=January 2017|title=Bouncing droplets, pilot waves, the double-slit experiment, and deBroglie-Bohm theory|journal=The Physics Teacher|language=en|volume=55|issue=1|pages=62|doi=10.1119/1.4972510|issn=0031-921X|bibcode=2017PhTea..55S..62.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.mit.edu/2013/when-fluid-dynamics-mimic-quantum-mechanics-0729|title=When fluid dynamics mimic quantum mechanics|work=MIT News|access-date=2018-07-19}}</ref>\n\n==Theory==\n\n===Ontology===\n\nThe [[ontology]] of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory consists of a configuration <math>q(t) \\in Q</math> of the universe and a pilot wave <math>\\psi(q,t) \\in \\mathbb{C}</math>. The configuration space <math>Q</math> can be chosen differently, as in classical mechanics and standard quantum mechanics.\n\nThus, the ontology of pilot-wave theory contains as the trajectory <math>q(t) \\in Q</math> we know from classical mechanics, as the wavefunction <math>\\psi(q,t) \\in \\mathbb{C}</math> of quantum theory. So, at every moment of time there exists not only a wavefunction, but also a well-defined configuration of the whole universe (i.e., the system as defined by the boundary conditions used in solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation). The correspondence to our experiences is made by the identification of the configuration of our brain with some part of the configuration of the whole universe <math>q(t) \\in Q</math>, as in classical mechanics.\n\nWhile the ontology of classical mechanics is part of the ontology of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, the dynamics are very different. In classical mechanics, the accelerations of the particles are imparted directly by forces, which exist in physical three-dimensional space. In de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, the velocities of the particles are given by the wavefunction, which exists in a 3''N''-dimensional configuration space, where ''N'' corresponds to the number of particles in the system;<ref>{{cite book|author=David Bohm|title=Causality and Chance in Modern Physics|year=1957|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul and D.

And that distribution is guaranteed to be true for all time by the guiding equation if the initial distribution of the particles satisfies <math>|\\psi|^2</math>.\n\nFor a given experiment, we can postulate this as being true and verify experimentally that it does indeed hold true, as it does.

In summary, in a universe governed by the de Broglie\u2013Bohm dynamics, Born rule behavior is typical.\n\nThe situation is thus analogous to the situation in classical statistical physics. A low-[[entropy]] initial condition will, with overwhelmingly high probability, evolve into a higher-entropy state: behavior consistent with the [[second law of thermodynamics]] is typical. There are, of course, anomalous initial conditions that would give rise to violations of the second law. However, in the absence of some very detailed evidence supporting the actual realization of one of those special initial conditions, it would be quite unreasonable to expect anything but the actually observed uniform increase of entropy. Similarly, in the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, there are anomalous initial conditions that would produce measurement statistics in violation of the Born rule (i.e., in conflict with the predictions of standard quantum theory). But the typicality theorem shows that, in the absence of some specific reason to believe that one of those special initial conditions was in fact realized, the Born rule behavior is what one should expect.\n\nIt is in that qualified sense that the Born rule is, for the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, a theorem rather than (as in ordinary quantum theory) an additional postulate.\n\nIt can also be shown that a distribution of particles that is ''not'' distributed according to the Born rule (that is, a distribution \"out of quantum equilibrium\") and evolving under the de Broglie\u2013Bohm dynamics is overwhelmingly likely to evolve dynamically into a state distributed as <math>|\\psi|^2</math>.<ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=1103.1589|last1= Towler|first1= M.

It should, however, be noted that the \"universe\" is simply the system limited by the same boundary conditions used to solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. However, once the theory is formulated, it is convenient to introduce a notion of wavefunction also for subsystems of the universe. Let us write the wavefunction of the universe as <math>\\psi(t, q^\\text{I}, q^\\text{II})</math>, where <math>q^\\text{I}</math> denotes the configuration variables associated to some subsystem (I) of the universe, and <math>q^\\text{II}</math> denotes the remaining configuration variables. Denote respectively by <math>Q^\\text{I}(t)</math> and <math>Q^\\text{II}(t)</math> the actual configuration of subsystem (I) and of the rest of the universe. For simplicity, we consider here only the spinless case. The ''conditional wavefunction'' of subsystem (I) is defined by\n\n:<math>\\psi^\\text{I}(t, q^\\text{I}) = \\psi(t, q^\\text{I}, Q^\\text{II}(t)).</math>\n\nIt follows immediately from the fact that <math>Q(t) = (Q^\\text{I}(t), Q^\\text{II}(t))</math> satisfies the guiding equation that also the configuration <math>Q^\\text{I}(t)</math> satisfies a guiding equation identical to the one presented in the formulation of the theory, with the universal wavefunction <math>\\psi</math> replaced with the conditional wavefunction <math>\\psi^\\text{I}</math>. Also, the fact that <math>Q(t)</math> is random with [[Probability density function|probability density]] given by the square modulus of <math>\\psi(t,\\cdot)</math> implies that the [[Conditional probability density function|conditional probability density]] of <math>Q^\\text{I}(t)</math> given <math>Q^\\text{II}(t)</math> is given by the square modulus of the (normalized) conditional wavefunction <math>\\psi^\\text{I}(t,\\cdot)</math> (in the terminology of D\u00fcrr et al.<ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=quant-ph/0308039 |last1=D\u00fcrr |first1=Detlef |title=Quantum Equilibrium and the Origin of Absolute Uncertainty |journal=Journal of Statistical Physics |volume=67 |issue=5\u20136 |pages=843\u2013907 |last2=Goldstein |first2=Sheldon |last3=Zangh\u00ed |first3=Nino |year=2003 |doi=10.1007/BF01049004 |bibcode=1992JSP....67..843D}}</ref> this fact is called the ''fundamental conditional probability formula'').\n\nUnlike the universal wavefunction, the conditional wavefunction of a subsystem does not always evolve by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, but in many situations it does. For instance, if the universal wavefunction factors as\n\n:<math>\\psi(t, q^\\text{I} ,q^\\text{II}) = \\psi^\\text{I}(t, q^\\text{I}) \\psi^\\text{II}(t, q^\\text{II}),</math>\n\nthen the conditional wavefunction of subsystem (I) is (up to an irrelevant scalar factor) equal to <math>\\psi^\\text{I}</math> (this is what standard quantum theory would regard as the wavefunction of subsystem (I)). If, in addition, the Hamiltonian does not contain an interaction term between subsystems (I) and (II), then <math>\\psi^\\text{I}</math> does satisfy a Schr\u00f6dinger equation. More generally, assume that the universal wave function <math>\\psi</math> can be written in the form\n\n:<math>\\psi(t, q^\\text{I}, q^\\text{II}) = \\psi^\\text{I}(t, q^\\text{I}) \\psi^\\text{II}(t, q^\\text{II}) + \\phi(t, q^\\text{I}, q^\\text{II}),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\phi</math> solves Schr\u00f6dinger equation and, <math>\\phi(t, q^\\text{I}, Q^\\text{II}(t)) = 0</math> for all <math>t</math> and <math>q^\\text{I}</math>. Then, again, the conditional wavefunction of subsystem (I) is (up to an irrelevant scalar factor) equal to <math>\\psi^\\text{I}</math>, and if the Hamiltonian does not contain an interaction term between subsystems (I) and (II), then <math>\\psi^\\text{I}</math> satisfies a Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nThe fact that the conditional wavefunction of a subsystem does not always evolve by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is related to the fact that the usual collapse rule of standard quantum theory emerges from the Bohmian formalism when one considers conditional wavefunctions of subsystems.\n\n== Extensions ==\n\n=== Relativity ===\nPilot-wave theory is explicitly nonlocal, which is in ostensible conflict with [[special relativity]]. Various extensions of \"Bohm-like\" mechanics exist that attempt to resolve this problem. Bohm himself in 1953 presented an extension of the theory satisfying the [[Dirac equation]] for a single particle. However, this was not extensible to the many-particle case because it used an absolute time.<ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=quant-ph/0611032|last1=Passon|first1=Oliver|title=What you always wanted to know about Bohmian mechanics but were afraid to ask|journal=Physics and Philosophy|volume=3|issue=2006|pages=<!---->|year=2006|bibcode=2006quant.ph.11032P|doi=10.17877/DE290R-14213|hdl=2003/23108}}</ref>\n\nA renewed interest in constructing Lorentz-invariant extensions of Bohmian theory arose in the 1990s; see Bohm and Hiley: The Undivided Universe, and,<ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=quant-ph/0208185|last1= Nikolic|first1= H.|title= Bohmian particle trajectories in relativistic bosonic quantum field theory|journal= Foundations of Physics Letters|volume= 17|issue= 4|pages= 363\u2013380|year= 2004|doi= 10.1023/B:FOPL.0000035670.31755.0a|bibcode= 2004FoPhL..17..363N|citeseerx= 10.1.1.253.838}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=quant-ph/0302152|last1= Nikolic|first1= H.|title= Bohmian particle trajectories in relativistic fermionic quantum field theory|journal= Foundations of Physics Letters|volume= 18|issue= 2|pages= 123\u2013138|year= 2005|doi= 10.1007/s10702-005-3957-3|bibcode= 2005FoPhL..18..123N}}</ref> and references therein.

(1999) showed that it is possible to formally restore Lorentz invariance for the Bohm\u2013Dirac theory by introducing additional structure. This approach still requires a [[foliation]] of space-time. While this is in conflict with the standard interpretation of relativity, the preferred foliation, if unobservable, does not lead to any empirical conflicts with relativity. In 2013, D\u00fcrr et al. suggested that the required foliation could be covariantly determined by the wavefunction.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = D\u00fcrr | first1 = Detlef | last2 = Goldstein | first2 = Sheldon | last3 = Norsen | first3 = Travis | last4 = Struyve | first4 = Ward | last5 = Zangh\u00ec | first5 = Nino | year = 2014 | title = Can Bohmian mechanics be made relativistic? | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences| volume =  470| issue = 2162| pages =  20130699| doi = 10.1098/rspa.2013.0699 | pmid = 24511259 | pmc = 3896068 | arxiv = 1307.1714 | bibcode = 2013RSPSA.47030699D }}</ref>\n\nThe relation between nonlocality and preferred foliation can be better understood as follows. In de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, nonlocality manifests as the fact that the velocity and acceleration of one particle depends on the instantaneous positions of all other particles. On the other hand, in the theory of relativity the concept of instantaneousness does not have an invariant meaning. Thus, to define particle trajectories, one needs an additional rule that defines which space-time points should be considered instantaneous. The simplest way to achieve this is to introduce a preferred foliation of space-time by hand, such that each hypersurface of the foliation defines a hypersurface of equal time.\n\nInitially, it had been considered impossible to set out a description of photon trajectories in the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory in view of the difficulties of describing bosons relativistically.<ref name=\"ghose-1996\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ghose | first1 = Partha | year = 1996 | title = Relativistic quantum mechanics of spin-0 and spin-1 bosons | journal = Foundations of Physics | volume = 26 | issue = 11| pages = 1441\u20131455 | doi = 10.1007/BF02272366 |bibcode = 1996FoPh...26.1441G }}</ref> In 1996, [[Partha Ghose]] had presented a relativistic quantum-mechanical description of spin-0 and spin-1 bosons starting from the [[Duffin\u2013Kemmer\u2013Petiau equation]], setting out Bohmian trajectories for massive bosons and for massless bosons (and therefore [[photon]]s).<ref name=\"ghose-1996\" /> In 2001, [[Jean-Pierre Vigier]] emphasized the importance of deriving a well-defined description of light in terms of particle trajectories in the framework of either the Bohmian mechanics or the Nelson stochastic mechanics.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cufaro Petroni | first1 = Nicola | last2 = Vigier | first2 = Jean-Pierre | year = 2001| title = Remarks on Observed Superluminal Light Propagation | url = | journal = Foundations of Physics Letters | volume = 14 | issue = 4| pages = 395\u2013400 | doi = 10.1023/A:1012321402475 }}, therein: section ''3.

Sutherland at the University in Sydney has a Lagrangian formalism for the pilot wave and its beables.

The basic idea was already published by [[Olivier Costa de Beauregard|Costa de Beauregard]] in the 1950s and is also used by [[John G. Cramer|John Cramer]] in his transactional interpretation except the beables that exist between the von Neumann strong projection operator measurements. Sutherland's Lagrangian includes two-way action-reaction between pilot wave and beables. Therefore, it is a post-quantum non-statistical theory with final boundary conditions that violate the no-signal theorems of quantum theory. Just as special relativity is a limiting case of general relativity when the spacetime curvature vanishes, so, too is statistical no-entanglement signaling quantum theory with the Born rule a limiting case of the post-quantum action-reaction Lagrangian when the reaction is set to zero and the final boundary condition is integrated out.<ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=1509.02442|last1=Sutherland|first1=Roderick|title=Lagrangian Description for Particle Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics -- Entangled Many-Particle Case|journal=Foundations of Physics|year=2015|doi=10.1007/s10701-016-0043-6|volume=47|issue=2|pages=174\u2013207|bibcode=2017FoPh...47..174S}}</ref>\n\n=== Spin ===\nTo incorporate [[Spin (physics)|spin]], the [[wavefunction]] becomes complex-vector-valued.

This introduces an instability, a feedback loop that pushes the hidden variables out of \"sub-quantal heat death\". The resulting theory becomes nonlinear and non-unitary. Valentini argues that the laws of quantum mechanics are [[Emergence|emergent]] and form a \"quantum equilibrium\" that is analogous to thermal equilibrium in classical dynamics, such that other \"[[quantum non-equilibrium]]\" distributions may in principle be observed and exploited, for which the statistical predictions of quantum theory are violated. It is controversially argued that quantum theory is merely a special case of a much wider nonlinear physics, a physics in which non-local ([[Faster-than-light|superluminal]]) signalling is possible, and in which the uncertainty principle can be violated.<ref name=\"Valentini2009\">{{cite journal|last1=Valentini|first1=Antony|title=Beyond the quantum|journal=Physics World|volume=22|issue=11|year=2009|pages=32\u201337|issn=0953-8585|doi=10.1088/2058-7058/22/11/36|arxiv=1001.2758|bibcode=2009PhyW...22k..32V}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Musser|first1=George|title=Cosmological Data Hint at a Level of Physics Underlying Quantum Mechanics|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/critical-opalescence/cosmological-data-hint-at-a-level-of-physics-underlying-quantum-mechanics-guest-post/|website=blogs.scientificamerican.com|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=5 December 2016|date=18 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Results ==\nBelow are some highlights of the results that arise out of an analysis of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory. Experimental results agree with all of quantum mechanics' standard predictions insofar as it has them. But while standard quantum mechanics is limited to discussing the results of \"measurements\", de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory governs the dynamics of a system without the intervention of outside observers (p.&nbsp;117 in Bell<ref name=\"bell\" />).\n\nThe basis for agreement with standard quantum mechanics is that the particles are distributed according to <math>|\\psi|^2</math>. This is a statement of observer ignorance, but it can be proven<ref name=\"dgz92\" /> that for a universe governed by this theory, this will typically be the case. There is apparent collapse of the wave function governing subsystems of the universe, but there is no collapse of the universal wavefunction.\n\n=== Measuring spin and polarization ===\nAccording to ordinary quantum theory, it is not possible to measure the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] or [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of a particle directly; instead, the component in one direction is measured; the outcome from a single particle may be 1, meaning that the particle is aligned with the measuring apparatus, or \u22121, meaning that it is aligned the opposite way. For an ensemble of particles, if we expect the particles to be aligned, the results are all 1. If we expect them to be aligned oppositely, the results are all \u22121. For other alignments, we expect some results to be 1 and some to be \u22121 with a probability that depends on the expected alignment. For a full explanation of this, see the [[Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment]].\n\nIn de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, the results of a spin experiment cannot be analyzed without some knowledge of the experimental setup. It is possible<ref>Albert, D. Z., 1992, Quantum Mechanics and Experience, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref> to modify the setup so that the trajectory of the particle is unaffected, but that the particle with one setup registers as spin-up, while in the other setup it registers as spin-down. Thus, for the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, the particle's spin is not an intrinsic property of the particle; instead spin is, so to speak, in the wavefunction of the particle in relation to the particular device being used to measure the spin. This is an illustration of what is sometimes referred to as contextuality and is related to naive realism about operators.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Daumer | first1 = M. | last2 = D\u00fcrr | first2 = D. | last3 = Goldstein | first3 = S. | last4 = Zangh\u00ec | first4 = N. | year = 1997 | title = Naive Realism About Operators | arxiv = quant-ph/9601013| journal = Erkenntnis | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 379\u2013397 | bibcode = 1996quant.ph..1013D }}</ref> Interpretationally, measurement results are a deterministic property of the system and its environment, which includes information about the experimental setup including the context of co-measured observables; in no sense does the system itself possess the property being measured, as would have been the case in classical physics.\n\n=== Measurements, the quantum formalism, and observer independence ===\nDe Broglie\u2013Bohm theory gives the same results as quantum mechanics. It treats the wavefunction as a fundamental object in the theory, as the wavefunction describes how the particles move. This means that no experiment can distinguish between the two theories. This section outlines the ideas as to how the standard quantum formalism arises out of quantum mechanics. References include Bohm's original 1952 paper and D\u00fcrr et al.<ref name=\"dgz92\" />\n\n==== Collapse of the wavefunction ====\nDe Broglie\u2013Bohm theory is a theory that applies primarily to the whole universe. That is, there is a single wavefunction governing the motion of all of the particles in the universe according to the guiding equation. Theoretically, the motion of one particle depends on the positions of all of the other particles in the universe. In some situations, such as in experimental systems, we can represent the system itself in terms of a de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory in which the wavefunction of the system is obtained by conditioning on the environment of the system. Thus, the system can be analyzed with Schr\u00f6dinger's equation and the guiding equation, with an initial <math>|\\psi|^2</math> distribution for the particles in the system (see the section on [[#The conditional wavefunction of a subsystem|the conditional wavefunction of a subsystem]] for details).\n\nIt requires a special setup for the conditional wavefunction of a system to obey a quantum evolution. When a system interacts with its environment, such as through a measurement, the conditional wavefunction of the system evolves in a different way. The evolution of the universal wavefunction can become such that the wavefunction of the system appears to be in a superposition of distinct states. But if the environment has recorded the results of the experiment, then using the actual Bohmian configuration of the environment to condition on, the conditional wavefunction collapses to just one alternative, the one corresponding with the measurement results.\n\n[[Wavefunction collapse|Collapse]] of the universal wavefunction never occurs in de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory. Its entire evolution is governed by Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, and the particles' evolutions are governed by the guiding equation. Collapse only occurs in a phenomenological way for systems that seem to follow their own Schr\u00f6dinger's equation. As this is an effective description of the system, it is a matter of choice as to what to define the experimental system to include, and this will affect when \"collapse\" occurs.\n\n==== Operators as observables ====\nIn the standard quantum formalism, measuring observables is generally thought of as measuring operators on the Hilbert space. For example, measuring position is considered to be a measurement of the position operator. This relationship between physical measurements and Hilbert space operators is, for standard quantum mechanics, an additional axiom of the theory. The de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, by contrast, requires no such measurement axioms (and measurement as such is not a dynamically distinct or special sub-category of physical processes in the theory). In particular, the usual operators-as-observables formalism is, for de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, a theorem.<ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=quant-ph/0308038|last1=D\u00fcrr|first1=Detlef|title=Quantum Equilibrium and the Role of Operators as Observables in Quantum Theory|journal=Journal of Statistical Physics |volume=116|issue=1\u20134|pages=959|last2=Goldstein|first2=Sheldon|last3=Zangh\u00ec|first3=Nino|year=2003|doi=10.1023/B:JOSS.0000037234.80916.d0|bibcode=2004JSP...116..959D|citeseerx=10.1.1.252.1653}}</ref> A major point of the analysis is that many of the measurements of the observables do not correspond to properties of the particles; they are (as in the case of spin discussed above) measurements of the wavefunction.\n\nIn the history of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, the proponents have often had to deal with claims that this theory is impossible. Such arguments are generally based on inappropriate analysis of operators as observables. If one believes that spin measurements are indeed measuring the spin of a particle that existed prior to the measurement, then one does reach contradictions. De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory deals with this by noting that spin is not a feature of the particle, but rather that of the wavefunction. As such, it only has a definite outcome once the experimental apparatus is chosen. Once that is taken into account, the impossibility theorems become irrelevant.\n\nThere have also been claims that experiments reject the Bohm trajectories <ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=quant-ph/0206196|last1= Brida|first1= G.|title= A first experimental test of de Broglie-Bohm theory against standard quantum mechanics|journal= Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics|volume= 35|issue= 22|pages= 4751|last2=  Cagliero|first2= E.|last3=  Falzetta|first3= G.|last4=  Genovese|first4= M.|last5=  Gramegna|first5= M.|last6=  Novero|first6= C.|year= 2002|doi= 10.1088/0953-4075/35/22/316|bibcode=2002JPhB...35.4751B}}</ref> in favor of the standard QM lines. But as shown in other work,<ref>{{Cite book|arxiv=quant-ph/0108038|last1= Struyve|first1= W.|chapter= Comments on some recently proposed experiments that should distinguish Bohmian mechanics from quantum mechanics|title=Quantum Theory: Reconsideration of Foundations |publisher=Vaxjo University Press |location=Vaxjo|page= 355|year= 2001 |last2=  De Baere|first2= W.|bibcode= 2001quant.ph..8038S}}</ref><ref>{{cite arxiv|eprint=quant-ph/0305131|last1= Nikolic|first1= H.|title= On compatibility of Bohmian mechanics with standard quantum mechanics|year= 2003}}</ref> such experiments cited above only disprove a misinterpretation of the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, not the theory itself.\n\nThere are also objections to this theory based on what it says about particular situations usually involving eigenstates of an operator. For example, the ground state of hydrogen is a real wavefunction. According to the guiding equation, this means that the electron is at rest when in this state. Nevertheless, it is distributed according to <math>|\\psi|^2</math>, and no contradiction to experimental results is possible to detect.\n\nOperators as observables leads many to believe that many operators are equivalent. De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, from this perspective, chooses the position observable as a favored observable rather than, say, the momentum observable. Again, the link to the position observable is a consequence of the dynamics. The motivation for de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory is to describe a system of particles. This implies that the goal of the theory is to describe the positions of those particles at all times. Other observables do not have this compelling ontological status. Having definite positions explains having definite results such as flashes on a detector screen. Other observables would not lead to that conclusion, but there need not be any problem in defining a mathematical theory for other observables; see Hyman et al.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1088/0305-4470/37/44/L02|title=Bohmian mechanics with discrete operators|journal=Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General|volume=37|issue=44|pages=L547|year=2004|last1=Hyman|first1=Ross|last2=Caldwell|first2=Shane A|last3=Dalton|first3=Edward|bibcode=2004JPhA...37L.547H|arxiv=quant-ph/0401008}}</ref> for an exploration of the fact that a probability density and probability current can be defined for any set of commuting operators.\n\n==== Hidden variables ====\nDe Broglie\u2013Bohm theory is often referred to as a \"hidden-variable\" theory. Bohm used this description in his original papers on the subject, writing: \"From the point of view of the [[Copenhagen interpretation|usual interpretation]], these additional elements or parameters [permitting a detailed causal and continuous description of all processes] could be called 'hidden' variables.\" Bohm and Hiley later stated that they found Bohm's choice of the term \"hidden variables\" to be too restrictive. In particular, they argued that a particle is not actually hidden but rather \"is what is most directly manifested in an observation [though] its properties cannot be observed with arbitrary precision (within the limits set by [[uncertainty principle]])\".<ref>David Bohm, Basil Hiley: ''The Undivided Universe: An Ontological Interpretation of Quantum Theory'', edition published in the Taylor & Francis e-library 2009 (first edition Routledge, 1993), {{ISBN|0-203-98038-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vt9XKjc4WAQC&pg=PA2 p. 2].</ref> However, others nevertheless treat the term \"hidden variable\" as a suitable description.<ref>\"While the testable predictions of Bohmian mechanics are isomorphic to standard Copenhagen quantum mechanics, its underlying hidden variables have to be, in principle, unobservable. If one could observe them, one would be able to take advantage of that and signal faster than light, which \u2013 according to the special theory of relativity \u2013 leads to physical temporal paradoxes.\" J. Kofler and A. Zeiliinger, \"Quantum Information and Randomness\", ''European Review'' (2010), Vol. 18, No. 4, 469\u2013480.</ref>\n\nGeneralized particle trajectories can be extrapolated from numerous weak measurements on an ensemble of equally prepared systems, and such trajectories coincide with the de Broglie\u2013Bohm trajectories. In particular, an experiment with two entangled photons, in which a set of Bohmian trajectories for one of the photons was determined using weak measurements and postselection, can be understood in terms of a nonlocal connection between that photon's trajectory and the other photon's polarization.<ref>Dylan H.

As an example, if one measures the position with an accuracy of <math>\\Delta x</math> and the momentum with an accuracy of <math>\\Delta p</math>, then <math>\\Delta x \\Delta p \\gtrsim h.</math> If we make further measurements in order to get more information, we disturb the system and change the trajectory into a new one depending on the measurement setup; therefore, the measurement results are still subject to Heisenberg's uncertainty relation.\n\nIn de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, there is always a matter of fact about the position and momentum of a particle. Each particle has a well-defined trajectory, as well as a wavefunction. Observers have limited knowledge as to what this trajectory is (and thus of the position and momentum). It is the lack of knowledge of the particle's trajectory that accounts for the uncertainty relation. What one can know about a particle at any given time is described by the wavefunction. Since the uncertainty relation can be derived from the wavefunction in other interpretations of quantum mechanics, it can be likewise derived (in the [[Epistemology|epistemic]] sense mentioned above) on the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory.\n\nTo put the statement differently, the particles' positions are only known statistically. As in [[classical mechanics]], successive observations of the particles' positions refine the experimenter's knowledge of the particles' [[initial conditions]]. Thus, with succeeding observations, the initial conditions become more and more restricted. This formalism is consistent with the normal use of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nFor the derivation of the uncertainty relation, see [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], noting that this article describes the principle from the viewpoint of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]].\n\n=== Quantum entanglement, Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen paradox, Bell's theorem, and nonlocality ===\nDe Broglie\u2013Bohm theory highlighted the issue of [[Quantum nonlocality|nonlocality]]: it inspired [[John Stewart Bell]] to prove his now-famous [[Bell's theorem|theorem]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bell J.

In particular, Bell proved that any local theory with unique results must make empirical predictions satisfying a statistical constraint called \"Bell's inequality\".\n\n[[Alain Aspect]] performed a series of [[Bell test experiments]] that test Bell's inequality using an EPR-type setup. Aspect's results show experimentally that Bell's inequality is in fact violated, meaning that the relevant quantum-mechanical predictions are correct. In these Bell test experiments, entangled pairs of particles are created; the particles are separated, traveling to remote measuring apparatus. The orientation of the measuring apparatus can be changed while the particles are in flight, demonstrating the apparent nonlocality of the effect.\n\nThe de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory makes the same (empirically correct) predictions for the Bell test experiments as ordinary quantum mechanics. It is able to do this because it is manifestly nonlocal. It is often criticized or rejected based on this; Bell's attitude was: \"It is a merit of the de Broglie\u2013Bohm version to bring this [nonlocality] out so explicitly that it cannot be ignored.\"<ref>Bell, page 115.</ref>\n\nThe de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory describes the physics in the Bell test experiments as follows: to understand the evolution of the particles, we need to set up a wave equation for both particles; the orientation of the apparatus affects the wavefunction. The particles in the experiment follow the guidance of the wavefunction. It is the wavefunction that carries the faster-than-light effect of changing the orientation of the apparatus. An analysis of exactly what kind of nonlocality is present and how it is compatible with relativity can be found in Maudlin.<ref>{{cite book |last=Maudlin |first=T. |year=1994 |title=Quantum Non-Locality and Relativity: Metaphysical Intimations of Modern Physics |location=Cambridge, Mass. |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-18609-0 }}</ref> Note that in Bell's work, and in more detail in Maudlin's work, it is shown that the nonlocality does not allow signaling at speeds faster than light.\n\n=== Classical limit ===\nBohm's formulation of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory in terms of a classically looking version has the merits that the emergence of classical behavior seems to follow immediately for any situation in which the quantum potential is negligible, as noted by Bohm in 1952. Modern methods of [[decoherence]] are relevant to an analysis of this limit.

Wyatt]] in the early 2000s attempted to use the Bohm \"particles\" as an adaptive mesh that follows the actual trajectory of a quantum state in time and space. In the \"quantum trajectory\" method, one samples the quantum wavefunction with a mesh of quadrature points. One then evolves the quadrature points in time according to the Bohm equations of motion. At each time step, one then re-synthesizes the wavefunction from the points, recomputes the quantum forces, and continues the calculation. (QuickTime movies of this for H + H<sub>2</sub> reactive scattering can be found on the [http://research.cm.utexas.edu/rwyatt/movies/qtm/index.html Wyatt group web-site] at UT Austin.)\nThis approach has been adapted, extended, and used by a number of researchers in the chemical physics community as a way to compute semi-classical and quasi-classical molecular dynamics. A recent (2007) issue of the [http://pubs.acs.org/toc/jpcafh/111/41 Journal of Physical Chemistry A] was dedicated to Prof. Wyatt and his work on \"computational Bohmian dynamics\".\n\n[[Eric R. Bittner]]'s [http://k2.chem.uh.edu/ group] at the [[University of Houston]] has advanced a statistical variant of this approach that uses Bayesian sampling technique to sample the quantum density and compute the quantum potential on a structureless mesh of points. This technique was recently used to estimate quantum effects in the heat capacity of small clusters Ne<sub>n</sub> for ''n'' \u2248 100.\n\nThere remain difficulties using the Bohmian approach, mostly associated with the formation of singularities in the quantum potential due to nodes in the quantum wavefunction. In general, nodes forming due to interference effects lead to the case where <math>R^{-1}\\nabla^2R \\to \\infty.</math> This results in an infinite force on the sample particles forcing them to move away from the node and often crossing the path of other sample points (which violates single-valuedness). Various schemes have been developed to overcome this; however, no general solution has yet emerged.\n\nThese methods, as does Bohm's Hamilton\u2013Jacobi formulation, do not apply to situations in which the full dynamics of spin need to be taken into account.\n\nThe properties of trajectories in the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory differ significantly from the [[method of quantum characteristics|Moyal quantum trajectories]] as well as the [[Quantum_stochastic_calculus#Quantum_trajectories|quantum trajectories]] from the unraveling of an open quantum system.\n\n==Zitterbewegung==\nAs has been recently demonstrated, charged extended particles can experience [[Self-oscillation|self-oscillatory]] dynamics as a result of classical electrodynamic self-interactions.<ref>{{cite arxiv|last=L\u00f3pez|first=\u00c1lvaro G.|date=2020-01-30|title=On an electrodynamic origin of quantum fluctuations|eprint=2001.07392|class=quant-ph}}</ref> This trembling motion has a frequency closely related to the [[zitterbewegung]] frequency in Dirac's equation. The mechanism producing these fluctuations arises because some parts of an accelerated charged corpuscle emit electromagnetic perturbations that can affect another part of the body, producing self-forces. Using the Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert potential as solutions to Maxwell's equations with sources, it can be shown that these forces can be described in terms of state-dependent delay differential equations, which display limit cycle behavior. Therefore, the principle of inertia, as in Newton's first law, would hold only in an average sense, since uniform motion is unstable. Consequently, pilot waves would necessarily be attached to any electrodynamic body.\n\n==Similarities with the many-worlds interpretation==\nKim Joris Bostr\u00f6m has proposed a non-relativistic quantum mechanical theory that combines elements of de Broglie-Bohm mechanics and Everett\u2019s many-worlds. In particular, the unreal many-worlds interpretation of Hawking and Weinberg is similar to the Bohmian concept of unreal empty branch worlds:\n\n{{quote|The second issue with Bohmian mechanics may, at first sight, appear rather harmless, but which on a closer look develops considerable destructive power: the issue of empty branches. These are the components of the post-measurement state that do not guide any particles because they do not have the actual configuration ''q'' in their support. At first sight, the empty branches do not appear problematic but on the contrary very helpful as they enable the theory to explain unique outcomes of measurements. Also, they seem to explain why there is an effective \u201ccollapse of the wavefunction\u201d, as in ordinary quantum mechanics. On a closer view, though, one must admit that these empty branches do not actually disappear. As the wavefunction is taken to describe a really existing field, all their branches really exist and will evolve forever by the Schr\u00f6dinger dynamics, no matter how many of them will become empty in the course of the evolution. Every branch of the global wavefunction potentially describes a complete world which is, according to Bohm\u2019s ontology, only a possible world that would be the actual world if only it were filled with particles, and which is in every respect identical to a corresponding world in Everett\u2019s theory. Only one branch at a time is occupied by particles, thereby representing the actual world, while all other branches, though really existing as part of a really existing wavefunction, are empty and thus contain some sort of \u201czombie worlds\u201d with planets, oceans, trees, cities, cars and people who talk like us and behave like us, but who do not actually exist. Now, if the Everettian theory may be accused of ontological extravagance, then Bohmian mechanics could be accused of ontological wastefulness. On top of the ontology of empty branches comes the additional ontology of particle positions that are, on account of the quantum equilibrium hypothesis, forever unknown to the observer. Yet, the actual configuration is never needed for the calculation of the statistical predictions in experimental reality, for these can be obtained by mere wavefunction algebra. From this perspective, Bohmian mechanics may appear as a wasteful and redundant theory. I think it is considerations like these that are the biggest obstacle in the way of a general acceptance of Bohmian mechanics.<ref>{{Cite arxiv |eprint = 1208.5632|last1 = Valentini|first1 = Antony|title = Combining Bohm and Everett: Axiomatics for a Standalone Quantum Mechanics|last2 = Westman|first2 = Hans|class = quant-ph|year = 2012}}</ref>}}\n\nMany authors have expressed critical views of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory by comparing it to Everett's many-worlds approach. Many (but not all) proponents of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory (such as Bohm and Bell) interpret the universal wavefunction as physically real. According to some supporters of Everett's theory, if the (never collapsing) wavefunction is taken to be physically real, then it is natural to interpret the theory as having the same many worlds as Everett's theory. In the Everettian view the role of the Bohmian particle is to act as a \"pointer\", tagging, or selecting, just one branch of the [[universal wavefunction]] (the assumption that this branch indicates which ''wave packet'' determines the observed result of a given experiment is called the \"result assumption\"<ref name=BrownWallace />); the other branches are designated \"empty\" and implicitly assumed by Bohm to be devoid of conscious observers.<ref name=BrownWallace /> [[H. Dieter Zeh]] comments on these \"empty\" branches:<ref>[[Daniel Dennett]] (2000). ''With a little help from my friends.'' In D. Ross, A. Brook, and D.

Everett's [[many-worlds interpretation]] is an attempt to demonstrate that the [[wavefunction]] alone is sufficient to account for all our observations. When we see the particle detectors flash or hear the click of a [[Geiger counter]], Everett's theory interprets this as our ''wavefunction'' responding to changes in the detector's ''wavefunction'', which is responding in turn to the passage of another ''wavefunction'' (which we think of as a \"particle\", but is actually just another [[wave packet]]).<ref name=BrownWallace>{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = Harvey R. | authorlink = Harvey Brown (philosopher) | last2 = Wallace | first2 = David | year = 2005 | title = Solving the measurement problem: de Broglie\u2013Bohm loses out to Everett | url = http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00001659/01/Cushing.pdf | journal = Foundations of Physics | volume = 35 | issue = 4| pages = 517\u2013540 | doi=10.1007/s10701-004-2009-3|arxiv = quant-ph/0403094 |bibcode = 2005FoPh...35..517B }} Abstract: \"The quantum theory of de Broglie and Bohm solves the measurement problem, but the hypothetical corpuscles play no role in the argument.

Below are six derivations, all of which are very different and lead to different ways of understanding and extending this theory.\n* [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation#Derivation|Schr\u00f6dinger's equation]] can be derived by using [[Photoelectric effect|Einstein's light quanta hypothesis]]: <math>E = \\hbar \\omega</math> and [[Matter wave|de Broglie's hypothesis]]: <math>\\mathbf{p} = \\hbar \\mathbf{k}</math>.\n:The guiding equation can be derived in a similar fashion. We assume a plane wave: <math>\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, t) = A e^{i(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{x} -  \\omega t)}</math>. Notice that <math>i\\mathbf{k} = \\nabla\\psi/\\psi</math>. Assuming that <math>\\mathbf{p} = m \\mathbf{v}</math> for the particle's actual velocity, we have that <math>\\mathbf{v} = \\frac{\\hbar}{m} \\operatorname{Im}\\left(\\frac{\\nabla\\psi}{\\psi}\\right)</math>. Thus, we have the guiding equation.\n:Notice that this derivation does not use Schr\u00f6dinger's equation.\n* Preserving the density under the time evolution is another method of derivation. This is the method that Bell cites. It is this method that generalizes to many possible alternative theories. The starting point is the [[continuity equation]] <math>-\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho v^\\psi)</math> {{clarify|date=March 2018}} for the density <math>\\rho = |\\psi|^2</math>. This equation describes a probability flow along a current. We take the velocity field associated with this current as the velocity field whose integral curves yield the motion of the particle.\n* A method applicable for particles without spin is to do a polar decomposition of the wavefunction and transform Schr\u00f6dinger's equation into two coupled equations: the [[continuity equation]] from above and the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation]]. This is the method used by Bohm in 1952. The decomposition and equations are as follows:\n\n:Decomposition: <math>\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, t) = R(\\mathbf{x}, t) e^{i S(\\mathbf{x}, t) / \\hbar}.</math> Note that <math>R^2(\\mathbf{x}, t)</math> corresponds to the probability density <math>\\rho(\\mathbf{x}, t) = |\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, t)|^2</math>.\n\n:Continuity equation: <math>-\\frac{\\partial\\rho(\\mathbf{x}, t)}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\rho(\\mathbf{x}, t) \\frac{\\nabla S(\\mathbf{x}, t)}{m}\\right)</math>.\n\n:Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation: <math>\\frac{\\partial S(\\mathbf{x}, t)}{\\partial t} = -\\left[\\frac{1}{2m}(\\nabla S(\\mathbf{x}, t))^2 + V - \\frac{\\hbar ^2}{2m} \\frac{\\nabla^2R(\\mathbf{x}, t)}{R(\\mathbf{x}, t)}\\right].</math>\n\n:The Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation is the equation derived from a Newtonian system with potential <math>V - \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\nabla^2 R}{R}</math> and velocity field <math>\\frac{\\nabla S}{m}.</math> The potential <math>V</math> is the classical potential that appears in Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, and the other term involving <math>R</math> is the [[quantum potential]], terminology introduced by Bohm.\n\n:This leads to viewing the quantum theory as particles moving under the classical force modified by a quantum force. However, unlike standard [[Newtonian mechanics]], the initial velocity field is already specified by <math>\\frac{\\nabla S}{m}</math>, which is a symptom of this being a first-order theory, not a second-order theory.\n* A fourth derivation was given by D\u00fcrr et al.<ref name=\"dgz92\" /> In their derivation, they derive the velocity field by demanding the appropriate transformation properties given by the various symmetries that Schr\u00f6dinger's equation satisfies, once the wavefunction is suitably transformed. The guiding equation is what emerges from that analysis.\n* A fifth derivation, given by D\u00fcrr et al.<ref name=\"dgtz04\" /> is appropriate for generalization to quantum field theory and the Dirac equation. The idea is that a velocity field can also be understood as a first-order differential operator acting on functions. Thus, if we know how it acts on functions, we know what it is. Then given the Hamiltonian operator <math>H</math>, the equation to satisfy for all functions <math>f</math> (with associated multiplication operator <math>\\hat{f}</math>) is <math>(v(f))(q) = \\operatorname{Re}\\frac{\\left(\\psi, \\frac{i}{\\hbar} [H, \\hat f] \\psi\\right)}{(\\psi, \\psi)}(q)</math>, where <math>(v, w)</math> is the local Hermitian inner product on the value space of the wavefunction.\n\n:This formulation allows for stochastic theories such as the creation and annihilation of particles.\n* A further derivation has been given by Peter R. Holland, on which he bases the entire work presented in his quantum-physics textbook ''The Quantum Theory of Motion'',<ref>Peter R. Holland: ''The quantum theory of motion'', Cambridge University Press, 1993 (re-printed 2000, transferred to digital printing 2004), {{ISBN|0-521-48543-6}}, p. 66 ff.</ref> a main reference book on the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory. It is based on three basic postulates and an additional fourth postulate that links the wavefunction to measurement probabilities:\n:1. A physical system consists in a spatiotemporally propagating wave and a point particle guided by it.\n:2. The wave is described mathematically by a solution <math>\\psi</math> to Schr\u00f6dinger's wave equation.\n:3. The particle motion is described by a solution to <math>\\mathbf{\\dot x}(t) = [\\nabla S (\\mathbf{x}(t), t))]/m</math> in dependence on initial condition <math>\\mathbf{x}(t = 0)</math>, with <math>S</math> the phase of <math>\\psi</math>.\n:The fourth postulate is subsidiary yet consistent with the first three:\n:4. The probability <math>\\rho(\\mathbf{x}(t))</math> to find the particle in the differential volume <math>d^3 x</math> at time ''t'' equals <math>|\\psi(\\mathbf{x}(t))|^2</math>.\n\n== History ==\nDe Broglie\u2013Bohm theory has a history of different formulations and names. In this section, each stage is given a name and a main reference.\n\n=== Pilot-wave theory ===\n\n[[Louis de Broglie]] presented his pilot wave theory at the 1927 Solvay Conference,<ref>Solvay Conference, 1928, Electrons et Photons: Rapports et Descussions du Cinquieme Conseil de Physique tenu a Bruxelles du 24 au 29 October 1927 sous les auspices de l'Institut International Physique Solvay</ref> after close collaboration with Schr\u00f6dinger, who developed his wave equation for de Broglie's theory. At the end of the presentation, [[Wolfgang Pauli]] pointed out that it was not compatible with a semi-classical technique Fermi had previously adopted in the case of inelastic scattering.  Contrary to a popular legend, de Broglie actually gave the correct rebuttal that the particular technique could not be generalized for Pauli's purpose, although the audience might have been lost in the technical details and de Broglie's mild manner left the impression that Pauli's objection was valid. He was eventually persuaded to abandon this theory nonetheless because he was \"discouraged by criticisms which [it] roused\".<ref>Louis be Broglie, in the foreword to David Bohm's ''Causality and Chance in Modern Physics'' (1957). p. x.</ref> De Broglie's theory already applies to multiple spin-less particles, but lacks an adequate theory of measurement as no one understood [[quantum decoherence]] at the time.

This sealed the fate of de Broglie's theory for the next two decades.\n\nIn 1926, [[Erwin Madelung]] had developed a hydrodynamic version of [[Schr\u00f6dinger's equation]], which is incorrectly considered as a basis for the density current derivation of the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Madelung |first=E. |title=Quantentheorie in hydrodynamischer Form |journal=[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik|Z.

The result was 'A Suggested Interpretation of the Quantum Theory in Terms of \"Hidden Variables\" I and II' [Bohm 1952]. It was an independent origination of the pilot wave theory, and extended it to incorporate a consistent theory of measurement, and to address a criticism of Pauli that de Broglie did not properly respond to; it is taken to be deterministic (though Bohm hinted in the original papers that there should be disturbances to this, in the way [[Brownian motion]] disturbs Newtonian mechanics). This stage is known as the ''de Broglie\u2013Bohm Theory'' in Bell's work [Bell 1987] and is the basis for 'The Quantum Theory of Motion' [Holland 1993].\n\nThis stage applies to multiple particles, and is deterministic.\n\nThe de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory is an example of a [[hidden-variables theory]]. Bohm originally hoped that hidden variables could provide a [[principle of locality|local]], [[causal]], [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] description that would resolve or eliminate many of the paradoxes of quantum mechanics, such as [[Schr\u00f6dinger's cat]], the [[measurement problem]] and the collapse of the wavefunction. However, [[Bell's theorem]] complicates this hope, as it demonstrates that there can be no local hidden-variable theory that is compatible with the predictions of quantum mechanics. The Bohmian interpretation is [[causal]] but not [[principle of locality|local]].\n\nBohm's paper was largely ignored or panned by other physicists. [[Albert Einstein]], who had suggested that Bohm search for a realist alternative to the prevailing [[Copenhagen interpretation|Copenhagen approach]], did not consider Bohm's interpretation to be a satisfactory answer to the quantum nonlocality question, calling it \"too cheap\",<ref>(Letter of 12 May 1952 from Einstein to Max Born, in ''The Born\u2013Einstein Letters'', Macmillan, 1971, p. 192.</ref> while [[Werner Heisenberg]] considered it a \"superfluous 'ideological superstructure' \".<ref>Werner Heisenberg, ''Physics and Philosophy'' (1958), p. 133.</ref> [[Wolfgang Pauli]], who had been unconvinced by de Broglie in 1927, conceded to Bohm as follows:\n\n<blockquote>I just received your long letter of 20th November, and I also have studied more thoroughly the details of your paper.

The term \"Bohmian mechanics\" is also often used to include most of the further extensions past the spin-less version of Bohm. While de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory has [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangians]] and [[Hamilton-Jacobi equations]] as a primary focus and backdrop, with the icon of the [[quantum potential]], Bohmian mechanics considers the [[continuity equation]] as primary and has the guiding equation as its icon. They are mathematically equivalent in so far as the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation applies, i.e., spin-less particles. The papers of D\u00fcrr et al. popularized the term.\n\nAll of non-relativistic quantum mechanics can be fully accounted for in this theory.\n\n=== Causal interpretation and ontological interpretation ===\nBohm developed his original ideas, calling them the ''Causal Interpretation''. Later he felt that ''causal'' sounded too much like ''deterministic'' and preferred to call his theory the ''Ontological Interpretation''. The main reference is \"The Undivided Universe\" (Bohm, Hiley 1993).\n\nThis stage covers work by Bohm and in collaboration with [[Jean-Pierre Vigier]] and [[Basil Hiley]]. Bohm is clear that this theory is non-deterministic (the work with Hiley includes a stochastic theory). As such, this theory is not strictly speaking a formulation of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, but it deserves mention here because the term \"Bohm Interpretation\" is ambiguous between this theory and de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory.\n\nIn 1996 [[philosopher of science]] [[Arthur Fine]] gave an in-depth analysis of possible interpretations of Bohm's model of 1952.<ref>A.

A dissipative system is characterized by the spontaneous appearance of symmetry breaking ([[anisotropy]]) and the formation of complex, sometimes [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] or [[Emergence|emergent]], dynamics where interacting fields can exhibit long range correlations. [[Stochastic electrodynamics]] (SED) is an extension of the de Broglie\u2013Bohm interpretation of [[quantum mechanics]], with the electromagnetic [[Zero-point energy|zero-point field]] (ZPF) playing a central role as the guiding [[pilot-wave]]. Modern approaches to SED, like those proposed by the group around late Gerhard Gr\u00f6ssing, among others, consider wave and particle-like quantum effects as well-coordinated emergent systems. These emergent systems are the result of speculated and calculated sub-quantum interactions with the zero-point field.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Pena|first1=Luis de la|last2=Cetto|first2=Ana Maria|last3=Valdes-Hernandez|first3=Andrea|title=The Emerging Quantum: The Physics Behind Quantum Mechanics|date=2014|page=95|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-07893-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v0MqBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=978-3-319-07893-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gr\u00f6ssing|first1=G.|last2=Fussy|first2=S.|last3=Mesa Pascasio|first3=J.|last4=Schwabl|first4=H.|title=An explanation of interference effects in the double slit experiment: Classical trajectories plus ballistic diffusion caused by zero-point fluctuations|journal=Annals of Physics|date=2012|volume=327|issue=2|pages=421\u2013437|doi=10.1016/j.aop.2011.11.010|arxiv=1106.5994|bibcode=2012AnPhy.327..421G}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gr\u00f6ssing|first1=G.|last2=Fussy|first2=S.|last3=Mesa Pascasio|first3=J.|last4=Schwabl|first4=H.|title=The Quantum as an Emergent System|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series|date=2012|volume=361|issue=1|page=012008|doi=10.1088/1742-6596/361/1/012008|arxiv=1205.3393|bibcode=2012JPhCS.361a2008G}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ A comparison by Bush (2015)<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bush|first1=John W.M.|title=Pilot-Wave Hydrodynamics|journal=Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics|date=2015|volume=47|pages=269\u2013292|doi=10.1146/annurev-fluid-010814-014506|url=http://math.mit.edu/~bush/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Bush-AnnRev2015.pdf|bibcode=2015AnRFM..47..269B|hdl=1721.1/89790}}</ref> among the walking droplet system, de Broglie\u2019s double-solution pilot-wave theory<ref>{{cite journal|last1=De Broglie|first1=Louis|title=Une tentative d'interpr\u00e9tation causale et non lin\u00e9aire de la m\u00e9canique ondulatoire: (la th\u00e9orie de la double solution)|journal=Gauthier-Villars|date=1956}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=de Broglie|first1=Louis|title=Interpretation of quantum mechanics by the double solution theory|journal=Annales de la Fondation|date=1987|volume=12|issue=4|pages=399\u2013421|url=http://aflb.ensmp.fr/AFLB-classiques/aflb124p001.pdf|issn=0182-4295}}</ref> and its extension to SED<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kracklauer|first1=A.

In addition to a [[wavefunction]] on the space of all possible configurations, it also postulates an actual configuration that exists even when unobserved. The evolution over time of the configuration (that is, the positions of all particles or the configuration of all fields) is defined by the wave function by a [[#Guiding equation|guiding equation]]. The evolution of the wave function over time is given by the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]. The theory is named after [[Louis de Broglie]] (1892\u20131987) and [[David Bohm]] (1917\u20131992).\n\nThe theory is [[deterministic system|deterministic]]<ref>{{Cite journal| first = David | last = Bohm | title = A Suggested Interpretation of the Quantum Theory in Terms of 'Hidden Variables' I | journal = Physical Review | year = 1952 | volume = 85 | issue = 2 | pages = 166\u2013179 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.85.166|bibcode = 1952PhRv...85..166B }} (\"In contrast to the usual interpretation, this alternative interpretation permits us to conceive of each individual system as being in a precisely definable state, whose changes with time are determined by definite laws, analogous to (but not identical with) the classical equations of motion. Quantum-mechanical probabilities are regarded (like their counterparts in classical statistical mechanics) as only a practical necessity and not as an inherent lack of complete determination in the properties of matter at the quantum level.\")</ref> and explicitly [[Principle of locality|nonlocal]]: the velocity of any one particle depends on the value of the guiding equation, which depends on the configuration of the system given by its wave function; the latter depends on the boundary conditions of the system, which, in principle, may be the entire universe.\n\nThe theory results in a measurement formalism, analogous to thermodynamics for classical mechanics, that yields the standard quantum formalism generally associated with the [[Copenhagen interpretation]]. The theory's explicit non-locality resolves the \"[[measurement problem]]\", which is conventionally delegated to the topic of [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]] in the Copenhagen interpretation.\nThe [[Born rule]] in Broglie\u2013Bohm theory is not a basic law. Rather, in this theory, the link between the probability density and the wave function has the status of a hypothesis, called the [[quantum equilibrium hypothesis]], which is additional to the basic principles governing the wave function.\n\nThe theory was historically developed in the 1920s by de Broglie, who, in 1927, was persuaded to abandon it in favour of the then-mainstream Copenhagen interpretation. David Bohm, dissatisfied with the prevailing orthodoxy, rediscovered de Broglie's pilot-wave theory in 1952. Bohm's suggestions were not then widely received, partly due to reasons unrelated to their content, but instead were connected to Bohm's youthful [[communist]] affiliations.<ref>F. David Peat, ''Infinite Potential: The Life and Times of David Bohm'' (1997), p. 133. James T.

The configuration space is different for different versions of pilot-wave theory. For example, this may be the space of positions <math>\\mathbf{Q}_k</math> of <math>N</math> particles, or, in case of field theory, the space of field configurations <math>\\phi(x)</math>. The configuration evolves (for spin=0) according to the guiding equation\n::<math>m_k \\frac{d q^k}{dt}(t) = \\hbar \\nabla_k \\operatorname{Im} \\ln\\psi(q,t) = \\hbar \\operatorname{Im}\\left(\\frac{\\nabla_k \\psi}{\\psi}\\right)(q, t) = \\frac{m_k \\mathbf{j}_k}{\\psi^*\\psi} = \\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{\\hat P}_k\\Psi}{\\Psi}\\right), </math>\n:where <math>\\mathbf{j}</math> is the [[probability current]] or probability flux, and <math>\\mathbf{\\hat P}</math> is the [[momentum operator]]. Here, <math>\\psi(q,t)</math> is the standard complex-valued wavefunction known from quantum theory, which evolves according to [[Schr\u00f6dinger's equation]]\n::<math>i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\psi(q,t) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_i}\\nabla_i^2\\psi(q,t) + V(q)\\psi(q,t).</math>\n:This already completes the specification of the theory for any quantum theory with Hamilton operator of type <math>H =\\sum \\frac{1}{2m_i}\\hat{p}_i^2 + V(\\hat{q})</math>.\n* The configuration is distributed according to <math>|\\psi(q,t)|^2</math> at some moment of time <math>t</math>, and this consequently holds for all times. Such a state is named quantum equilibrium. With quantum equilibrium, this theory agrees with the results of standard quantum mechanics.\n\nNotably, even though this latter relation is frequently presented as an axiom of the theory, in Bohm's original papers of 1952 it was presented as derivable from statistical-mechanical arguments. This argument was further supported by the work of Bohm in 1953 and was substantiated by Vigier and Bohm's paper of 1954, in which they introduced stochastic ''fluid fluctuations'' that drive a process of asymptotic relaxation from [[quantum non-equilibrium]] to quantum equilibrium (\u03c1 \u2192 |\u03c8|<sup>2</sup>).<ref>Publications of D.

A similar pattern was also extrapolated from [[weak measurement]]s of single photons.<ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6034/1170.figures-only \"Observing the Average Trajectories of Single Photons in a Two-Slit Interferometer\"]</ref>]]\n\nThe [[double-slit experiment]] is an illustration of [[wave-particle duality]]. In it, a beam of particles (such as electrons) travels through a barrier that has two slits. If one puts a detector screen on the side beyond the barrier, the pattern of detected particles shows interference fringes characteristic of waves arriving at the screen from two sources (the two slits); however, the interference pattern is made up of individual dots corresponding to particles that had arrived on the screen. The system seems to exhibit the behaviour of both waves (interference patterns) and particles (dots on the screen).\n\nIf we modify this experiment so that one slit is closed, no interference pattern is observed. Thus, the state of both slits affects the final results. We can also arrange to have a minimally invasive detector at one of the slits to detect which slit the particle went through. When we do that, the interference pattern disappears.\n\nThe [[Copenhagen interpretation]] states that the particles are not localised in space until they are detected, so that, if there is no detector on the slits, there is no information about which slit the particle has passed through. If one slit has a detector on it, then the wavefunction collapses due to that detection.\n\nIn de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, the wavefunction is defined at both slits, but each particle has a well-defined trajectory that passes through exactly one of the slits. The final position of the particle on the detector screen and the slit through which the particle passes is determined by the initial position of the particle. Such initial position is not knowable or controllable by the experimenter, so there is an appearance of randomness in the pattern of detection. In Bohm's 1952 papers he used the wavefunction to construct a quantum potential that, when included in Newton's equations, gave the trajectories of the particles streaming through the two slits. In effect the wavefunction interferes with itself and guides the particles by the quantum potential in such a way that the particles avoid the regions in which the interference is destructive and are attracted to the regions in which the interference is constructive, resulting in the interference pattern on the detector screen.\n\nTo explain the behavior when the particle is detected to go through one slit, one needs to appreciate the role of the conditional wavefunction and how it results in the collapse of the wavefunction; this is explained below. The basic idea is that the environment registering the detection effectively separates the two wave packets in configuration space.\n\nAn experiment was conducted in 2016 which demonstrated the potential validity of the de-Broglie-Bohm theory via use of silicone oil droplets. In this experiment a drop of silicone oil is placed into a vibrating fluid bath, it then bounces across the bath propelled by waves produced by its own collisions, mimicking an electron's statistical behavior with remarkable accuracy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=MacIsaac|first=Dan|date=January 2017|title=Bouncing droplets, pilot waves, the double-slit experiment, and deBroglie-Bohm theory|journal=The Physics Teacher|language=en|volume=55|issue=1|pages=62|doi=10.1119/1.4972510|issn=0031-921X|bibcode=2017PhTea..55S..62.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.mit.edu/2013/when-fluid-dynamics-mimic-quantum-mechanics-0729|title=When fluid dynamics mimic quantum mechanics|work=MIT News|access-date=2018-07-19}}</ref>\n\n==Theory==\n\n===Ontology===\n\nThe [[ontology]] of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory consists of a configuration <math>q(t) \\in Q</math> of the universe and a pilot wave <math>\\psi(q,t) \\in \\mathbb{C}</math>. The configuration space <math>Q</math> can be chosen differently, as in classical mechanics and standard quantum mechanics.\n\nThus, the ontology of pilot-wave theory contains as the trajectory <math>q(t) \\in Q</math> we know from classical mechanics, as the wavefunction <math>\\psi(q,t) \\in \\mathbb{C}</math> of quantum theory. So, at every moment of time there exists not only a wavefunction, but also a well-defined configuration of the whole universe (i.e., the system as defined by the boundary conditions used in solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation). The correspondence to our experiences is made by the identification of the configuration of our brain with some part of the configuration of the whole universe <math>q(t) \\in Q</math>, as in classical mechanics.\n\nWhile the ontology of classical mechanics is part of the ontology of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, the dynamics are very different. In classical mechanics, the accelerations of the particles are imparted directly by forces, which exist in physical three-dimensional space. In de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, the velocities of the particles are given by the wavefunction, which exists in a 3''N''-dimensional configuration space, where ''N'' corresponds to the number of particles in the system;<ref>{{cite book|author=David Bohm|title=Causality and Chance in Modern Physics|year=1957|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul and D.

And that distribution is guaranteed to be true for all time by the guiding equation if the initial distribution of the particles satisfies <math>|\\psi|^2</math>.\n\nFor a given experiment, we can postulate this as being true and verify experimentally that it does indeed hold true, as it does. But, as argued in D\u00fcrr et al.,<ref name=\"dgz92\">{{cite journal | last1 = D\u00fcrr | first1 = D. | last2 = Goldstein | first2 = S. | last3 = Zangh\u00ec | first3 = N. | year = 1992 | title = Quantum Equilibrium and the Origin of Absolute Uncertainty | journal = Journal of Statistical Physics | volume = 67 | issue = 5\u20136| pages = 843\u2013907 |arxiv = quant-ph/0308039 |bibcode = 1992JSP....67..843D |doi = 10.1007/BF01049004 }}</ref> one needs to argue that this distribution for subsystems is typical. They argue that <math>|\\psi|^2</math> by virtue of its equivariance under the dynamical evolution of the system, is the appropriate measure of typicality for [[initial condition]]s of the positions of the particles. They then prove that the vast majority of possible initial configurations will give rise to statistics obeying the [[Born rule]] (i.e., <math>|\\psi|^2</math>) for measurement outcomes. In summary, in a universe governed by the de Broglie\u2013Bohm dynamics, Born rule behavior is typical.\n\nThe situation is thus analogous to the situation in classical statistical physics. A low-[[entropy]] initial condition will, with overwhelmingly high probability, evolve into a higher-entropy state: behavior consistent with the [[second law of thermodynamics]] is typical. There are, of course, anomalous initial conditions that would give rise to violations of the second law. However, in the absence of some very detailed evidence supporting the actual realization of one of those special initial conditions, it would be quite unreasonable to expect anything but the actually observed uniform increase of entropy. Similarly, in the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, there are anomalous initial conditions that would produce measurement statistics in violation of the Born rule (i.e., in conflict with the predictions of standard quantum theory). But the typicality theorem shows that, in the absence of some specific reason to believe that one of those special initial conditions was in fact realized, the Born rule behavior is what one should expect.\n\nIt is in that qualified sense that the Born rule is, for the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, a theorem rather than (as in ordinary quantum theory) an additional postulate.\n\nIt can also be shown that a distribution of particles that is ''not'' distributed according to the Born rule (that is, a distribution \"out of quantum equilibrium\") and evolving under the de Broglie\u2013Bohm dynamics is overwhelmingly likely to evolve dynamically into a state distributed as <math>|\\psi|^2</math>.<ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=1103.1589|last1= Towler|first1= M.

It should, however, be noted that the \"universe\" is simply the system limited by the same boundary conditions used to solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. However, once the theory is formulated, it is convenient to introduce a notion of wavefunction also for subsystems of the universe. Let us write the wavefunction of the universe as <math>\\psi(t, q^\\text{I}, q^\\text{II})</math>, where <math>q^\\text{I}</math> denotes the configuration variables associated to some subsystem (I) of the universe, and <math>q^\\text{II}</math> denotes the remaining configuration variables. Denote respectively by <math>Q^\\text{I}(t)</math> and <math>Q^\\text{II}(t)</math> the actual configuration of subsystem (I) and of the rest of the universe. For simplicity, we consider here only the spinless case. The ''conditional wavefunction'' of subsystem (I) is defined by\n\n:<math>\\psi^\\text{I}(t, q^\\text{I}) = \\psi(t, q^\\text{I}, Q^\\text{II}(t)).</math>\n\nIt follows immediately from the fact that <math>Q(t) = (Q^\\text{I}(t), Q^\\text{II}(t))</math> satisfies the guiding equation that also the configuration <math>Q^\\text{I}(t)</math> satisfies a guiding equation identical to the one presented in the formulation of the theory, with the universal wavefunction <math>\\psi</math> replaced with the conditional wavefunction <math>\\psi^\\text{I}</math>. Also, the fact that <math>Q(t)</math> is random with [[Probability density function|probability density]] given by the square modulus of <math>\\psi(t,\\cdot)</math> implies that the [[Conditional probability density function|conditional probability density]] of <math>Q^\\text{I}(t)</math> given <math>Q^\\text{II}(t)</math> is given by the square modulus of the (normalized) conditional wavefunction <math>\\psi^\\text{I}(t,\\cdot)</math> (in the terminology of D\u00fcrr et al.<ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=quant-ph/0308039 |last1=D\u00fcrr |first1=Detlef |title=Quantum Equilibrium and the Origin of Absolute Uncertainty |journal=Journal of Statistical Physics |volume=67 |issue=5\u20136 |pages=843\u2013907 |last2=Goldstein |first2=Sheldon |last3=Zangh\u00ed |first3=Nino |year=2003 |doi=10.1007/BF01049004 |bibcode=1992JSP....67..843D}}</ref> this fact is called the ''fundamental conditional probability formula'').\n\nUnlike the universal wavefunction, the conditional wavefunction of a subsystem does not always evolve by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, but in many situations it does. For instance, if the universal wavefunction factors as\n\n:<math>\\psi(t, q^\\text{I} ,q^\\text{II}) = \\psi^\\text{I}(t, q^\\text{I}) \\psi^\\text{II}(t, q^\\text{II}),</math>\n\nthen the conditional wavefunction of subsystem (I) is (up to an irrelevant scalar factor) equal to <math>\\psi^\\text{I}</math> (this is what standard quantum theory would regard as the wavefunction of subsystem (I)). If, in addition, the Hamiltonian does not contain an interaction term between subsystems (I) and (II), then <math>\\psi^\\text{I}</math> does satisfy a Schr\u00f6dinger equation. More generally, assume that the universal wave function <math>\\psi</math> can be written in the form\n\n:<math>\\psi(t, q^\\text{I}, q^\\text{II}) = \\psi^\\text{I}(t, q^\\text{I}) \\psi^\\text{II}(t, q^\\text{II}) + \\phi(t, q^\\text{I}, q^\\text{II}),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\phi</math> solves Schr\u00f6dinger equation and, <math>\\phi(t, q^\\text{I}, Q^\\text{II}(t)) = 0</math> for all <math>t</math> and <math>q^\\text{I}</math>. Then, again, the conditional wavefunction of subsystem (I) is (up to an irrelevant scalar factor) equal to <math>\\psi^\\text{I}</math>, and if the Hamiltonian does not contain an interaction term between subsystems (I) and (II), then <math>\\psi^\\text{I}</math> satisfies a Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nThe fact that the conditional wavefunction of a subsystem does not always evolve by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is related to the fact that the usual collapse rule of standard quantum theory emerges from the Bohmian formalism when one considers conditional wavefunctions of subsystems.\n\n== Extensions ==\n\n=== Relativity ===\nPilot-wave theory is explicitly nonlocal, which is in ostensible conflict with [[special relativity]]. Various extensions of \"Bohm-like\" mechanics exist that attempt to resolve this problem. Bohm himself in 1953 presented an extension of the theory satisfying the [[Dirac equation]] for a single particle. However, this was not extensible to the many-particle case because it used an absolute time.<ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=quant-ph/0611032|last1=Passon|first1=Oliver|title=What you always wanted to know about Bohmian mechanics but were afraid to ask|journal=Physics and Philosophy|volume=3|issue=2006|pages=<!---->|year=2006|bibcode=2006quant.ph.11032P|doi=10.17877/DE290R-14213|hdl=2003/23108}}</ref>\n\nA renewed interest in constructing Lorentz-invariant extensions of Bohmian theory arose in the 1990s; see Bohm and Hiley: The Undivided Universe, and,<ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=quant-ph/0208185|last1= Nikolic|first1= H.|title= Bohmian particle trajectories in relativistic bosonic quantum field theory|journal= Foundations of Physics Letters|volume= 17|issue= 4|pages= 363\u2013380|year= 2004|doi= 10.1023/B:FOPL.0000035670.31755.0a|bibcode= 2004FoPhL..17..363N|citeseerx= 10.1.1.253.838}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=quant-ph/0302152|last1= Nikolic|first1= H.|title= Bohmian particle trajectories in relativistic fermionic quantum field theory|journal= Foundations of Physics Letters|volume= 18|issue= 2|pages= 123\u2013138|year= 2005|doi= 10.1007/s10702-005-3957-3|bibcode= 2005FoPhL..18..123N}}</ref> and references therein.

While this is in conflict with the standard interpretation of relativity, the preferred foliation, if unobservable, does not lead to any empirical conflicts with relativity. In 2013, D\u00fcrr et al. suggested that the required foliation could be covariantly determined by the wavefunction.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = D\u00fcrr | first1 = Detlef | last2 = Goldstein | first2 = Sheldon | last3 = Norsen | first3 = Travis | last4 = Struyve | first4 = Ward | last5 = Zangh\u00ec | first5 = Nino | year = 2014 | title = Can Bohmian mechanics be made relativistic? | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences| volume =  470| issue = 2162| pages =  20130699| doi = 10.1098/rspa.2013.0699 | pmid = 24511259 | pmc = 3896068 | arxiv = 1307.1714 | bibcode = 2013RSPSA.47030699D }}</ref>\n\nThe relation between nonlocality and preferred foliation can be better understood as follows. In de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, nonlocality manifests as the fact that the velocity and acceleration of one particle depends on the instantaneous positions of all other particles. On the other hand, in the theory of relativity the concept of instantaneousness does not have an invariant meaning. Thus, to define particle trajectories, one needs an additional rule that defines which space-time points should be considered instantaneous. The simplest way to achieve this is to introduce a preferred foliation of space-time by hand, such that each hypersurface of the foliation defines a hypersurface of equal time.\n\nInitially, it had been considered impossible to set out a description of photon trajectories in the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory in view of the difficulties of describing bosons relativistically.<ref name=\"ghose-1996\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ghose | first1 = Partha | year = 1996 | title = Relativistic quantum mechanics of spin-0 and spin-1 bosons | journal = Foundations of Physics | volume = 26 | issue = 11| pages = 1441\u20131455 | doi = 10.1007/BF02272366 |bibcode = 1996FoPh...26.1441G }}</ref> In 1996, [[Partha Ghose]] had presented a relativistic quantum-mechanical description of spin-0 and spin-1 bosons starting from the [[Duffin\u2013Kemmer\u2013Petiau equation]], setting out Bohmian trajectories for massive bosons and for massless bosons (and therefore [[photon]]s).<ref name=\"ghose-1996\" /> In 2001, [[Jean-Pierre Vigier]] emphasized the importance of deriving a well-defined description of light in terms of particle trajectories in the framework of either the Bohmian mechanics or the Nelson stochastic mechanics.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cufaro Petroni | first1 = Nicola | last2 = Vigier | first2 = Jean-Pierre | year = 2001| title = Remarks on Observed Superluminal Light Propagation | url = | journal = Foundations of Physics Letters | volume = 14 | issue = 4| pages = 395\u2013400 | doi = 10.1023/A:1012321402475 }}, therein: section ''3.

Sutherland at the University in Sydney has a Lagrangian formalism for the pilot wave and its beables. It draws on [[Yakir Aharonov]]'s retrocasual weak measurements to explain many-particle entanglement in a special relativistic way without the need for configuration space. The basic idea was already published by [[Olivier Costa de Beauregard|Costa de Beauregard]] in the 1950s and is also used by [[John G.

Sutherland's Lagrangian includes two-way action-reaction between pilot wave and beables. Therefore, it is a post-quantum non-statistical theory with final boundary conditions that violate the no-signal theorems of quantum theory.

Experimental results agree with all of quantum mechanics' standard predictions in so far it has them. But while standard quantum mechanics is limited to discussing the results of \"measurements\", de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory governs the dynamics of a system without the intervention of outside observers (p.&nbsp;117 in Bell<ref name=\"bell\" />).\n\nThe basis for agreement with standard quantum mechanics is that the particles are distributed according to <math>|\\psi|^2</math>. This is a statement of observer ignorance, but it can be proven<ref name=\"dgz92\" /> that for a universe governed by this theory, this will typically be the case. There is apparent collapse of the wave function governing subsystems of the universe, but there is no collapse of the universal wavefunction.\n\n=== Measuring spin and polarization ===\nAccording to ordinary quantum theory, it is not possible to measure the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] or [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of a particle directly; instead, the component in one direction is measured; the outcome from a single particle may be 1, meaning that the particle is aligned with the measuring apparatus, or \u22121, meaning that it is aligned the opposite way. For an ensemble of particles, if we expect the particles to be aligned, the results are all 1. If we expect them to be aligned oppositely, the results are all \u22121. For other alignments, we expect some results to be 1 and some to be \u22121 with a probability that depends on the expected alignment. For a full explanation of this, see the [[Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment]].\n\nIn de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, the results of a spin experiment cannot be analyzed without some knowledge of the experimental setup. It is possible<ref>Albert, D. Z., 1992, Quantum Mechanics and Experience, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref> to modify the setup so that the trajectory of the particle is unaffected, but that the particle with one setup registers as spin-up, while in the other setup it registers as spin-down. Thus, for the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, the particle's spin is not an intrinsic property of the particle; instead spin is, so to speak, in the wavefunction of the particle in relation to the particular device being used to measure the spin. This is an illustration of what is sometimes referred to as contextuality and is related to naive realism about operators.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Daumer | first1 = M. | last2 = D\u00fcrr | first2 = D. | last3 = Goldstein | first3 = S. | last4 = Zangh\u00ec | first4 = N. | year = 1997 | title = Naive Realism About Operators | arxiv = quant-ph/9601013| journal = Erkenntnis | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 379\u2013397 | bibcode = 1996quant.ph..1013D }}</ref> Interpretationally, measurement results are a deterministic property of the system and its environment, which includes information about the experimental setup including the context of co-measured observables; in no sense does the system itself possess the property being measured, as would have been the case in classical physics.\n\n=== Measurements, the quantum formalism, and observer independence ===\nDe Broglie\u2013Bohm theory gives the same results as quantum mechanics. It treats the wavefunction as a fundamental object in the theory, as the wavefunction describes how the particles move. This means that no experiment can distinguish between the two theories. This section outlines the ideas as to how the standard quantum formalism arises out of quantum mechanics. References include Bohm's original 1952 paper and D\u00fcrr et al.<ref name=\"dgz92\" />\n\n==== Collapse of the wavefunction ====\nDe Broglie\u2013Bohm theory is a theory that applies primarily to the whole universe. That is, there is a single wavefunction governing the motion of all of the particles in the universe according to the guiding equation. Theoretically, the motion of one particle depends on the positions of all of the other particles in the universe. In some situations, such as in experimental systems, we can represent the system itself in terms of a de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory in which the wavefunction of the system is obtained by conditioning on the environment of the system. Thus, the system can be analyzed with Schr\u00f6dinger's equation and the guiding equation, with an initial <math>|\\psi|^2</math> distribution for the particles in the system (see the section on [[#The conditional wavefunction of a subsystem|the conditional wavefunction of a subsystem]] for details).\n\nIt requires a special setup for the conditional wavefunction of a system to obey a quantum evolution. When a system interacts with its environment, such as through a measurement, the conditional wavefunction of the system evolves in a different way. The evolution of the universal wavefunction can become such that the wavefunction of the system appears to be in a superposition of distinct states. But if the environment has recorded the results of the experiment, then using the actual Bohmian configuration of the environment to condition on, the conditional wavefunction collapses to just one alternative, the one corresponding with the measurement results.\n\n[[Wavefunction collapse|Collapse]] of the universal wavefunction never occurs in de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory. Its entire evolution is governed by Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, and the particles' evolutions are governed by the guiding equation. Collapse only occurs in a phenomenological way for systems that seem to follow their own Schr\u00f6dinger's equation. As this is an effective description of the system, it is a matter of choice as to what to define the experimental system to include, and this will affect when \"collapse\" occurs.\n\n==== Operators as observables ====\nIn the standard quantum formalism, measuring observables is generally thought of as measuring operators on the Hilbert space. For example, measuring position is considered to be a measurement of the position operator. This relationship between physical measurements and Hilbert space operators is, for standard quantum mechanics, an additional axiom of the theory. The de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, by contrast, requires no such measurement axioms (and measurement as such is not a dynamically distinct or special sub-category of physical processes in the theory). In particular, the usual operators-as-observables formalism is, for de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, a theorem.<ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=quant-ph/0308038|last1=D\u00fcrr|first1=Detlef|title=Quantum Equilibrium and the Role of Operators as Observables in Quantum Theory|journal=Journal of Statistical Physics |volume=116|issue=1\u20134|pages=959|last2=Goldstein|first2=Sheldon|last3=Zangh\u00ec|first3=Nino|year=2003|doi=10.1023/B:JOSS.0000037234.80916.d0|bibcode=2004JSP...116..959D|citeseerx=10.1.1.252.1653}}</ref> A major point of the analysis is that many of the measurements of the observables do not correspond to properties of the particles; they are (as in the case of spin discussed above) measurements of the wavefunction.\n\nIn the history of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, the proponents have often had to deal with claims that this theory is impossible. Such arguments are generally based on inappropriate analysis of operators as observables. If one believes that spin measurements are indeed measuring the spin of a particle that existed prior to the measurement, then one does reach contradictions. De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory deals with this by noting that spin is not a feature of the particle, but rather that of the wavefunction. As such, it only has a definite outcome once the experimental apparatus is chosen. Once that is taken into account, the impossibility theorems become irrelevant.\n\nThere have also been claims that experiments reject the Bohm trajectories <ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=quant-ph/0206196|last1= Brida|first1= G.|title= A first experimental test of de Broglie-Bohm theory against standard quantum mechanics|journal= Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics|volume= 35|issue= 22|pages= 4751|last2=  Cagliero|first2= E.|last3=  Falzetta|first3= G.|last4=  Genovese|first4= M.|last5=  Gramegna|first5= M.|last6=  Novero|first6= C.|year= 2002|doi= 10.1088/0953-4075/35/22/316|bibcode=2002JPhB...35.4751B}}</ref> in favor of the standard QM lines.

For example, the ground state of hydrogen is a real wavefunction. According to the guiding equation, this means that the electron is at rest when in this state. Nevertheless, it is distributed according to <math>|\\psi|^2</math>, and no contradiction to experimental results is possible to detect.\n\nOperators as observables leads many to believe that many operators are equivalent. De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, from this perspective, chooses the position observable as a favored observable rather than, say, the momentum observable. Again, the link to the position observable is a consequence of the dynamics. The motivation for de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory is to describe a system of particles. This implies that the goal of the theory is to describe the positions of those particles at all times. Other observables do not have this compelling ontological status. Having definite positions explains having definite results such as flashes on a detector screen. Other observables would not lead to that conclusion, but there need not be any problem in defining a mathematical theory for other observables; see Hyman et al.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1088/0305-4470/37/44/L02|title=Bohmian mechanics with discrete operators|journal=Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General|volume=37|issue=44|pages=L547|year=2004|last1=Hyman|first1=Ross|last2=Caldwell|first2=Shane A|last3=Dalton|first3=Edward|bibcode=2004JPhA...37L.547H|arxiv=quant-ph/0401008}}</ref> for an exploration of the fact that a probability density and probability current can be defined for any set of commuting operators.\n\n==== Hidden variables ====\nDe Broglie\u2013Bohm theory is often referred to as a \"hidden-variable\" theory. Bohm used this description in his original papers on the subject, writing: \"From the point of view of the [[Copenhagen interpretation|usual interpretation]], these additional elements or parameters [permitting a detailed causal and continuous description of all processes] could be called 'hidden' variables.\" Bohm and Hiley later stated that they found Bohm's choice of the term \"hidden variables\" to be too restrictive. In particular, they argued that a particle is not actually hidden but rather \"is what is most directly manifested in an observation [though] its properties cannot be observed with arbitrary precision (within the limits set by [[uncertainty principle]])\".<ref>David Bohm, Basil Hiley: ''The Undivided Universe: An Ontological Interpretation of Quantum Theory'', edition published in the Taylor & Francis e-library 2009 (first edition Routledge, 1993), {{ISBN|0-203-98038-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vt9XKjc4WAQC&pg=PA2 p. 2].</ref> However, others nevertheless treat the term \"hidden variable\" as a suitable description.<ref>\"While the testable predictions of Bohmian mechanics are isomorphic to standard Copenhagen quantum mechanics, its underlying hidden variables have to be, in principle, unobservable. If one could observe them, one would be able to take advantage of that and signal faster than light, which \u2013 according to the special theory of relativity \u2013 leads to physical temporal paradoxes.\" J. Kofler and A. Zeiliinger, \"Quantum Information and Randomness\", ''European Review'' (2010), Vol. 18, No. 4, 469\u2013480.</ref>\n\nGeneralized particle trajectories can be extrapolated from numerous weak measurements on an ensemble of equally prepared systems, and such trajectories coincide with the de Broglie\u2013Bohm trajectories. In particular, an experiment with two entangled photons, in which a set of Bohmian trajectories for one of the photons was determined using weak measurements and postselection, can be understood in terms of a nonlocal connection between that photon's trajectory and the other photon's polarization.<ref>Dylan H.

As an example, if one measures the position with an accuracy of <math>\\Delta x</math> and the momentum with an accuracy of <math>\\Delta p</math>, then <math>\\Delta x \\Delta p \\gtrsim h.</math> If we make further measurements in order to get more information, we disturb the system and change the trajectory into a new one depending on the measurement setup; therefore, the measurement results are still subject to Heisenberg's uncertainty relation.\n\nIn de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, there is always a matter of fact about the position and momentum of a particle. Each particle has a well-defined trajectory, as well as a wavefunction. Observers have limited knowledge as to what this trajectory is (and thus of the position and momentum). It is the lack of knowledge of the particle's trajectory that accounts for the uncertainty relation. What one can know about a particle at any given time is described by the wavefunction. Since the uncertainty relation can be derived from the wavefunction in other interpretations of quantum mechanics, it can be likewise derived (in the [[Epistemology|epistemic]] sense mentioned above) on the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory.\n\nTo put the statement differently, the particles' positions are only known statistically. As in [[classical mechanics]], successive observations of the particles' positions refine the experimenter's knowledge of the particles' [[initial conditions]]. Thus, with succeeding observations, the initial conditions become more and more restricted. This formalism is consistent with the normal use of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nFor the derivation of the uncertainty relation, see [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], noting that this article describes the principle from the viewpoint of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]].\n\n=== Quantum entanglement, Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen paradox, Bell's theorem, and nonlocality ===\nDe Broglie\u2013Bohm theory highlighted the issue of [[Quantum nonlocality|nonlocality]]: it inspired [[John Stewart Bell]] to prove his now-famous [[Bell's theorem|theorem]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bell J.

In particular, Bell proved that any local theory with unique results must make empirical predictions satisfying a statistical constraint called \"Bell's inequality\".\n\n[[Alain Aspect]] performed a series of [[Bell test experiments]] that test Bell's inequality using an EPR-type setup. Aspect's results show experimentally that Bell's inequality is in fact violated, meaning that the relevant quantum-mechanical predictions are correct. In these Bell test experiments, entangled pairs of particles are created; the particles are separated, traveling to remote measuring apparatus. The orientation of the measuring apparatus can be changed while the particles are in flight, demonstrating the apparent nonlocality of the effect.\n\nThe de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory makes the same (empirically correct) predictions for the Bell test experiments as ordinary quantum mechanics. It is able to do this because it is manifestly nonlocal. It is often criticized or rejected based on this; Bell's attitude was: \"It is a merit of the de Broglie\u2013Bohm version to bring this [nonlocality] out so explicitly that it cannot be ignored.\"<ref>Bell, page 115.</ref>\n\nThe de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory describes the physics in the Bell test experiments as follows: to understand the evolution of the particles, we need to set up a wave equation for both particles; the orientation of the apparatus affects the wavefunction. The particles in the experiment follow the guidance of the wavefunction. It is the wavefunction that carries the faster-than-light effect of changing the orientation of the apparatus. An analysis of exactly what kind of nonlocality is present and how it is compatible with relativity can be found in Maudlin.<ref>{{cite book |last=Maudlin |first=T. |year=1994 |title=Quantum Non-Locality and Relativity: Metaphysical Intimations of Modern Physics |location=Cambridge, Mass. |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-18609-0 }}</ref> Note that in Bell's work, and in more detail in Maudlin's work, it is shown that the nonlocality does not allow signaling at speeds faster than light.\n\n=== Classical limit ===\nBohm's formulation of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory in terms of a classically looking version has the merits that the emergence of classical behavior seems to follow immediately for any situation in which the quantum potential is negligible, as noted by Bohm in 1952. Modern methods of [[decoherence]] are relevant to an analysis of this limit.

Wyatt]] in the early 2000s attempted to use the Bohm \"particles\" as an adaptive mesh that follows the actual trajectory of a quantum state in time and space. In the \"quantum trajectory\" method, one samples the quantum wavefunction with a mesh of quadrature points. One then evolves the quadrature points in time according to the Bohm equations of motion. At each time step, one then re-synthesizes the wavefunction from the points, recomputes the quantum forces, and continues the calculation. (QuickTime movies of this for H + H<sub>2</sub> reactive scattering can be found on the [http://research.cm.utexas.edu/rwyatt/movies/qtm/index.html Wyatt group web-site] at UT Austin.)\nThis approach has been adapted, extended, and used by a number of researchers in the chemical physics community as a way to compute semi-classical and quasi-classical molecular dynamics. A recent (2007) issue of the [http://pubs.acs.org/toc/jpcafh/111/41 Journal of Physical Chemistry A] was dedicated to Prof. Wyatt and his work on \"computational Bohmian dynamics\".\n\n[[Eric R. Bittner]]'s [http://k2.chem.uh.edu/ group] at the [[University of Houston]] has advanced a statistical variant of this approach that uses Bayesian sampling technique to sample the quantum density and compute the quantum potential on a structureless mesh of points. This technique was recently used to estimate quantum effects in the heat capacity of small clusters Ne<sub>n</sub> for ''n'' \u2248 100.\n\nThere remain difficulties using the Bohmian approach, mostly associated with the formation of singularities in the quantum potential due to nodes in the quantum wavefunction. In general, nodes forming due to interference effects lead to the case where <math>R^{-1}\\nabla^2R \\to \\infty.</math> This results in an infinite force on the sample particles forcing them to move away from the node and often crossing the path of other sample points (which violates single-valuedness). Various schemes have been developed to overcome this; however, no general solution has yet emerged.\n\nThese methods, as does Bohm's Hamilton\u2013Jacobi formulation, do not apply to situations in which the full dynamics of spin need to be taken into account.\n\nThe properties of trajectories in the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory differ significantly from the [[method of quantum characteristics|Moyal quantum trajectories]] as well as the [[Quantum_stochastic_calculus#Quantum_trajectories|quantum trajectories]] from the unraveling of an open quantum system.\n\n==Zitterbewegung==\nAs has been recently demonstrated, charged extended particles can experience [[Self-oscillation|self-oscillatory]] dynamics as a result of classical electrodynamic self-interactions.<ref>{{cite arxiv|last=L\u00f3pez|first=\u00c1lvaro G.|date=2020-01-30|title=On an electrodynamic origin of quantum fluctuations|eprint=2001.07392|class=quant-ph}}</ref> This trembling motion has a frequency closely related to the [[zitterbewegung]] frequency in Dirac's equation. The mechanism producing these fluctuations arises because some parts of an accelerated charged corpuscle emit electromagnetic perturbations that can affect another part of the body, producing self-forces. Using the Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert potential as solutions to Maxwell's equations with sources, it can be shown that these forces can be described in terms of state-dependent delay differential equations, which display limit cycle behavior. Therefore, the principle of inertia, as in Newton's first law, would hold only in an average sense, since uniform motion is unstable. Consequently, pilot waves would necessarily be attached to any electrodynamic body.\n\n==Similarities with the many-worlds interpretation==\nKim Joris Bostr\u00f6m has proposed a non-relativistic quantum mechanical theory that combines elements of de Broglie-Bohm mechanics and Everett\u2019s many-worlds. In particular, the unreal many-worlds interpretation of Hawking and Weinberg is similar to the Bohmian concept of unreal empty branch worlds:\n\n{{quote|The second issue with Bohmian mechanics may, at first sight, appear rather harmless, but which on a closer look develops considerable destructive power: the issue of empty branches. These are the components of the post-measurement state that do not guide any particles because they do not have the actual configuration ''q'' in their support. At first sight, the empty branches do not appear problematic but on the contrary very helpful as they enable the theory to explain unique outcomes of measurements. Also, they seem to explain why there is an effective \u201ccollapse of the wavefunction\u201d, as in ordinary quantum mechanics. On a closer view, though, one must admit that these empty branches do not actually disappear. As the wavefunction is taken to describe a really existing field, all their branches really exist and will evolve forever by the Schr\u00f6dinger dynamics, no matter how many of them will become empty in the course of the evolution. Every branch of the global wavefunction potentially describes a complete world which is, according to Bohm\u2019s ontology, only a possible world that would be the actual world if only it were filled with particles, and which is in every respect identical to a corresponding world in Everett\u2019s theory. Only one branch at a time is occupied by particles, thereby representing the actual world, while all other branches, though really existing as part of a really existing wavefunction, are empty and thus contain some sort of \u201czombie worlds\u201d with planets, oceans, trees, cities, cars and people who talk like us and behave like us, but who do not actually exist. Now, if the Everettian theory may be accused of ontological extravagance, then Bohmian mechanics could be accused of ontological wastefulness. On top of the ontology of empty branches comes the additional ontology of particle positions that are, on account of the quantum equilibrium hypothesis, forever unknown to the observer. Yet, the actual configuration is never needed for the calculation of the statistical predictions in experimental reality, for these can be obtained by mere wavefunction algebra. From this perspective, Bohmian mechanics may appear as a wasteful and redundant theory. I think it is considerations like these that are the biggest obstacle in the way of a general acceptance of Bohmian mechanics.<ref>{{Cite arxiv |eprint = 1208.5632|last1 = Valentini|first1 = Antony|title = Combining Bohm and Everett: Axiomatics for a Standalone Quantum Mechanics|last2 = Westman|first2 = Hans|class = quant-ph|year = 2012}}</ref>}}\n\nMany authors have expressed critical views of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory by comparing it to Everett's many-worlds approach. Many (but not all) proponents of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory (such as Bohm and Bell) interpret the universal wavefunction as physically real. According to some supporters of Everett's theory, if the (never collapsing) wavefunction is taken to be physically real, then it is natural to interpret the theory as having the same many worlds as Everett's theory. In the Everettian view the role of the Bohmian particle is to act as a \"pointer\", tagging, or selecting, just one branch of the [[universal wavefunction]] (the assumption that this branch indicates which ''wave packet'' determines the observed result of a given experiment is called the \"result assumption\"<ref name=BrownWallace />); the other branches are designated \"empty\" and implicitly assumed by Bohm to be devoid of conscious observers.<ref name=BrownWallace /> [[H.

Everett's [[many-worlds interpretation]] is an attempt to demonstrate that the [[wavefunction]] alone is sufficient to account for all our observations. When we see the particle detectors flash or hear the click of a [[Geiger counter]], Everett's theory interprets this as our ''wavefunction'' responding to changes in the detector's ''wavefunction'', which is responding in turn to the passage of another ''wavefunction'' (which we think of as a \"particle\", but is actually just another [[wave packet]]).<ref name=BrownWallace>{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = Harvey R. | authorlink = Harvey Brown (philosopher) | last2 = Wallace | first2 = David | year = 2005 | title = Solving the measurement problem: de Broglie\u2013Bohm loses out to Everett | url = http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00001659/01/Cushing.pdf | journal = Foundations of Physics | volume = 35 | issue = 4| pages = 517\u2013540 | doi=10.1007/s10701-004-2009-3|arxiv = quant-ph/0403094 |bibcode = 2005FoPh...35..517B }} Abstract: \"The quantum theory of de Broglie and Bohm solves the measurement problem, but the hypothetical corpuscles play no role in the argument.

Below are six derivations, all of which are very different and lead to different ways of understanding and extending this theory.\n* [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation#Derivation|Schr\u00f6dinger's equation]] can be derived by using [[Photoelectric effect|Einstein's light quanta hypothesis]]: <math>E = \\hbar \\omega</math> and [[Matter wave|de Broglie's hypothesis]]: <math>\\mathbf{p} = \\hbar \\mathbf{k}</math>.\n:The guiding equation can be derived in a similar fashion. We assume a plane wave: <math>\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, t) = A e^{i(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{x} -  \\omega t)}</math>. Notice that <math>i\\mathbf{k} = \\nabla\\psi/\\psi</math>. Assuming that <math>\\mathbf{p} = m \\mathbf{v}</math> for the particle's actual velocity, we have that <math>\\mathbf{v} = \\frac{\\hbar}{m} \\operatorname{Im}\\left(\\frac{\\nabla\\psi}{\\psi}\\right)</math>. Thus, we have the guiding equation.\n:Notice that this derivation does not use Schr\u00f6dinger's equation.\n* Preserving the density under the time evolution is another method of derivation. This is the method that Bell cites. It is this method that generalizes to many possible alternative theories. The starting point is the [[continuity equation]] <math>-\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho v^\\psi)</math> {{clarify|date=March 2018}} for the density <math>\\rho = |\\psi|^2</math>. This equation describes a probability flow along a current. We take the velocity field associated with this current as the velocity field whose integral curves yield the motion of the particle.\n* A method applicable for particles without spin is to do a polar decomposition of the wavefunction and transform Schr\u00f6dinger's equation into two coupled equations: the [[continuity equation]] from above and the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation]]. This is the method used by Bohm in 1952.

However, unlike standard [[Newtonian mechanics]], the initial velocity field is already specified by <math>\\frac{\\nabla S}{m}</math>, which is a symptom of this being a first-order theory, not a second-order theory.\n* A fourth derivation was given by D\u00fcrr et al.<ref name=\"dgz92\" /> In their derivation, they derive the velocity field by demanding the appropriate transformation properties given by the various symmetries that Schr\u00f6dinger's equation satisfies, once the wavefunction is suitably transformed. The guiding equation is what emerges from that analysis.\n* A fifth derivation, given by D\u00fcrr et al.<ref name=\"dgtz04\" /> is appropriate for generalization to quantum field theory and the Dirac equation. The idea is that a velocity field can also be understood as a first-order differential operator acting on functions. Thus, if we know how it acts on functions, we know what it is.

In this section, each stage is given a name and a main reference.\n\n=== Pilot-wave theory ===\n\n[[Louis de Broglie]] presented his pilot wave theory at the 1927 Solvay Conference,<ref>Solvay Conference, 1928, Electrons et Photons: Rapports et Descussions du Cinquieme Conseil de Physique tenu a Bruxelles du 24 au 29 October 1927 sous les auspices de l'Institut International Physique Solvay</ref> after close collaboration with Schr\u00f6dinger, who developed his wave equation for de Broglie's theory. At the end of the presentation, [[Wolfgang Pauli]] pointed out that it was not compatible with a semi-classical technique Fermi had previously adopted in the case of inelastic scattering.  Contrary to a popular legend, de Broglie actually gave the correct rebuttal that the particular technique could not be generalized for Pauli's purpose, although the audience might have been lost in the technical details and de Broglie's mild manner left the impression that Pauli's objection was valid. He was eventually persuaded to abandon this theory nonetheless because he was \"discouraged by criticisms which [it] roused\".<ref>Louis be Broglie, in the foreword to David Bohm's ''Causality and Chance in Modern Physics'' (1957). p. x.</ref> De Broglie's theory already applies to multiple spin-less particles, but lacks an adequate theory of measurement as no one understood [[quantum decoherence]] at the time.

This sealed the fate of de Broglie's theory for the next two decades.\n\nIn 1926, [[Erwin Madelung]] had developed a hydrodynamic version of [[Schr\u00f6dinger's equation]], which is incorrectly considered as a basis for the density current derivation of the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Madelung |first=E. |title=Quantentheorie in hydrodynamischer Form |journal=[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik|Z.

The result was 'A Suggested Interpretation of the Quantum Theory in Terms of \"Hidden Variables\" I and II' [Bohm 1952]. It was an independent origination of the pilot wave theory, and extended it to incorporate a consistent theory of measurement, and to address a criticism of Pauli that de Broglie did not properly respond to; it is taken to be deterministic (though Bohm hinted in the original papers that there should be disturbances to this, in the way [[Brownian motion]] disturbs Newtonian mechanics). This stage is known as the ''de Broglie\u2013Bohm Theory'' in Bell's work [Bell 1987] and is the basis for 'The Quantum Theory of Motion' [Holland 1993].\n\nThis stage applies to multiple particles, and is deterministic.\n\nThe de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory is an example of a [[hidden-variables theory]]. Bohm originally hoped that hidden variables could provide a [[principle of locality|local]], [[causal]], [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] description that would resolve or eliminate many of the paradoxes of quantum mechanics, such as [[Schr\u00f6dinger's cat]], the [[measurement problem]] and the collapse of the wavefunction. However, [[Bell's theorem]] complicates this hope, as it demonstrates that there can be no local hidden-variable theory that is compatible with the predictions of quantum mechanics. The Bohmian interpretation is [[causal]] but not [[principle of locality|local]].\n\nBohm's paper was largely ignored or panned by other physicists. [[Albert Einstein]], who had suggested that Bohm search for a realist alternative to the prevailing [[Copenhagen interpretation|Copenhagen approach]], did not consider Bohm's interpretation to be a satisfactory answer to the quantum nonlocality question, calling it \"too cheap\",<ref>(Letter of 12 May 1952 from Einstein to Max Born, in ''The Born\u2013Einstein Letters'', Macmillan, 1971, p. 192.</ref> while [[Werner Heisenberg]] considered it a \"superfluous 'ideological superstructure' \".<ref>Werner Heisenberg, ''Physics and Philosophy'' (1958), p. 133.</ref> [[Wolfgang Pauli]], who had been unconvinced by de Broglie in 1927, conceded to Bohm as follows:\n\n<blockquote>I just received your long letter of 20th November, and I also have studied more thoroughly the details of your paper. I do not see any longer the possibility of any logical contradiction as long as your results agree completely with those of the usual wave mechanics and as long as no means is given to measure the values of your hidden parameters both in the measuring apparatus and in the observe [sic] system. As far as the whole matter stands now, your \u2018extra wave-mechanical predictions\u2019 are still a check, which cannot be cashed.<ref>Pauli to Bohm, 3 December 1951, in Wolfgang Pauli, ''Scientific Correspondence'', Vol IV \u2013 Part I, [ed. by Karl von Meyenn], (Berlin, 1996), pp. 436\u2013441.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe subsequently described Bohm's theory as \"artificial metaphysics\".<ref>Pauli, W.

Paris: Editions Albin Michel.</ref>\n\nAccording to physicist Max Dresden, when Bohm's theory was presented at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, many of the objections were [[ad hominem]], focusing on Bohm's sympathy with communists as exemplified by his refusal to give testimony to the House Un-American Activities Committee.<ref>F.

It probably still is the kiss of death for a physics career to be actually working on Bohm, but maybe that\u2019s changing.\"<ref name=\"newscientist.com\" />\n\n=== Bohmian mechanics ===\nBohmian mechanics is the same theory, but with an emphasis on the notion of current flow, which is determined on the basis of the [[quantum equilibrium hypothesis]] that the probability follows the [[Born rule]]. The term \"Bohmian mechanics\" is also often used to include most of the further extensions past the spin-less version of Bohm. While de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory has [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangians]] and [[Hamilton-Jacobi equations]] as a primary focus and backdrop, with the icon of the [[quantum potential]], Bohmian mechanics considers the [[continuity equation]] as primary and has the guiding equation as its icon. They are mathematically equivalent in so far as the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation applies, i.e., spin-less particles. The papers of D\u00fcrr et al. popularized the term.\n\nAll of non-relativistic quantum mechanics can be fully accounted for in this theory.\n\n=== Causal interpretation and ontological interpretation ===\nBohm developed his original ideas, calling them the ''Causal Interpretation''. Later he felt that ''causal'' sounded too much like ''deterministic'' and preferred to call his theory the ''Ontological Interpretation''. The main reference is \"The Undivided Universe\" (Bohm, Hiley 1993).\n\nThis stage covers work by Bohm and in collaboration with [[Jean-Pierre Vigier]] and [[Basil Hiley]]. Bohm is clear that this theory is non-deterministic (the work with Hiley includes a stochastic theory). As such, this theory is not strictly speaking a formulation of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, but it deserves mention here because the term \"Bohm Interpretation\" is ambiguous between this theory and de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory.\n\nIn 1996 [[philosopher of science]] [[Arthur Fine]] gave an in-depth analysis of possible interpretations of Bohm's model of 1952.<ref>A.

The remaining five editions of the Men's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won each by a different country including [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] and the defunct [[FR Yugoslavia men's national volleyball team|Yugoslavia]].\n\nGold medals are less evenly distributed in women's volleyball than in men's; the fourteen editions of the Women's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won by only five different countries: [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] and the former [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of Olympic volleyball can be traced back to the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], where volleyball was played as part of an American sports demonstration event. Its addition to the Olympic program, however, was given only after [[World War II]], with the foundation of the [[FIVB]] and of some of the continental confederations. In 1957, a special tournament was held during the [[List of IOC meetings|53rd IOC session]] in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], to support such request. The competition was a success, and the sport was officially introduced in [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The Olympic Committee initially dropped volleyball for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]], meeting protests.<ref>{{cite book|title=Black Belt Vol. 2, No. 2|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|year=Mar 1964|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ|quote=Sone Kaminaga black belt.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ/page/n26 27]}}</ref>\n\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament was originally a simple competition, whose format paralleled the one still employed in the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|World Cup]]: all teams played against each other team and then were ranked by number of wins, set average and point average. One disadvantage of this round-robin system is that medal winners could be determined before the end of the games, making the audience lose interest in the outcome of the remaining matches.\n\nTo cope with this situation, the competition was split into two phases: a \"final round\" was introduced, consisting of quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. Since its creation in [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]], this new system has become the standard for the volleyball Olympic tournament, and is usually referred to as the \"Olympic format\".\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has grown steadily since 1964. Since [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], both men's and women's indoor events count 12 participant nations. Each of the five continental volleyball confederations has at least one affiliated national federation involved in the Olympic Games.\n\n===Events===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

In [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], the introduction of a new offensive skill, the back row attack, helped [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] win the competition over the Soviets in a very tight five-setter.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], many of the strongest teams in men's volleyball belonged to the [[Eastern Bloc]], so the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]] did not have as great an effect on these events as it had on the women's. The Soviet Union collected their third Olympic gold medal with a 3\u20131 victory over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]]. With a Soviet-led boycott in [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] confirmed their new volleyball leadership in the Western World by sweeping smoothly over [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] at the finals. In that edition a minor nation, [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], won their first medal, but Italy would rise to prominence in volleyball in later decades. A long-awaited confrontation between the US and Soviet volleyball teams came in the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] final: powerplayers [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]] pushed the United States to a second gold medal setting the issue in favor of the Americans.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], Brazil upset favorites [[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], and Italy for their first Olympic championship. Runners-up Netherlands, with [[Ron Zwerver]] and [[Olof van der Meulen]], came back in the [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|following edition]] for a five-set win over Italy. In spite of their success in other major volleyball competitions in the 1990s, Italy did not fare well at the Olympics. After winning bronze in Atlanta, [[Serbia and Montenegro men's national volleyball team|Serbia and Montenegro]], led by [[Vladimir Grbi\u0107|Vladimir]] and [[Nikola Grbi\u0107]], beat [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] at the final in [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] to secure the gold (in 1996 and 2000 they played under the name [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]).\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], Brazil beat Italy in the final, adding a second gold medal to their record and confirming their role as the men's volleyball superpowers of the 2000s. In [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], United States beat Brazil in the final, winning their third gold medal. Russia won the bronze for the second time by defeating Italy. In the [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] final, Russia came back from a 0\u20132 set deficit, not letting the Brazilians take advantage of any of their 2 match points in the third set. [[Dmitriy Muserskiy]] scored 31 points, which is an Olympic Games record in a final. Italy defeated Bulgaria and took Bronze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivb.org/EN/Olympics/London2012/viewPressRelease.asp?No=36516&Language=en|title=FIVB - London 2012 Olympic Games|author=|date=|website=www.fivb.org|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter coming up short in the previous two editions of the Olympics as runners-up, the Brazilians captured their third gold medal in the history of the competition playing home in [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] after their straight-set victory against Italy in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/brazil-make-triumphant-return-to-the-top?id=64552|title=Brazil make triumphant return to the top of the podium|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> The United States pulled off a comeback from a 0\u20132 deficit to claim the bronze medal with a victory over Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/usa-grab-mens-bronze-with-fantastic-comeback?id=64545|title=USA grab men's bronze with fantastic comeback|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nGold medals appear to be more evenly distributed in men's volleyball than in women's: former Soviet Union (three titles), United States (three) and Brazil (three) are the only teams to have won the tournament more than once. The remaining four editions were won each by a different country. Despite being a major force in men's volleyball since the 1990s, Italy are still the only volleyball powerhouses that lack a gold medal at the Olympic Games.\n\n===Women's winners===\n[[File:Women's Volleyball semifinals - 6.jpg|thumbnail|right|Women's volleyball semifinals match between [[United States women's national volleyball team|USA]] and [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].]]\n\nThe opening edition of the volleyball Olympic tournament, in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]], was won by the host nation [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]]. There followed two victories in a row by the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] and [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] were expected to get their first gold after beating Japan in the 1975 Pre-Olympic Games, but Japan came back again in [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] for one last Olympic gold before losing their status of women's volleyball superpowers.\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott]] of the [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Games]] left many strong volleyball nations like Japan and South Korea out of the games. As a result, the Soviet Union easily secured a third Olympic gold medal. In [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[Eastern bloc]] was, in its turn, boycotting the games, and the Soviet Union did not participate. As a result, host nation [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] won its first medals in volleyball, losing the finals to [[China women's national volleyball team|China]]. With eastern and western nations again involved in the Olympics, the Soviet Union obtained a remarkable victory over [[Peru women's national volleyball team|Peru]] after trailing 0\u20132 in [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988's]] marking one of the most dramatic female matches of the 20th century. The 1988 games were, however, boycotted by Cuba.\n\n[[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] saw a new force go down in Olympic history: organized under the name [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]], the nations of the former Soviet Union that chose to form a combined team easily reached the gold medal game, but did not resist the power play of the young, rising Cuban squad. Led by superstars [[Mireya Luis]] and [[Regla Torres]], Cuba would eventually set the record for consecutive wins in the Olympic Games by also taking the gold in [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] and [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] against China and [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]], respectively.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the winners were once again China. Second were Russia who beat [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in a very tough and dramatic semifinal match after being down 1\u20132, 19\u201324 in the fourth set.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], Brazil finally won the gold, beating the United States in the final and losing only one set in the competition. China were awarded the bronze by beating Cuba. After a troubled start, Brazil secured the double gold in [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] after beating the United States once again in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/olympics/summer/2012/volleyball/story/_/id/8259676/2012-london-olympics-brazil-shocks-us-women-volleyball-gold|title=Brazil wins women's volleyball gold|work=espn.go.com|accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref> Japan won the bronze medal after defeating South Korea.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]], home team Brazil were favorites to once again win the title, thus equalling Cuba's three consecutive gold medals between 1992 and 2000. After winning all of their preliminary round matches without dropping a set, the team was, however, stunned by a young Chinese squad in a tiebreaker in the quarterfinals. China went on to win the title, their third in Olympic history, by beating [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]] in four sets in the gold medal match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/china-crowned-champions-in-rio-de-janeiro?id=64539|title=China crowned champions in Rio de Janeiro|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> In the process, [[Lang Ping]] became the first person to win a gold medal as a player in Los Angeles 1984 and repeat the feat now as a coach in Rio de Janeiro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/lang-ping-becomes-first-person-in-volleyball?id=64550|title=Lang Ping became the first person in volleyball to win Olympic gold as player and coach|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> China also became the first team to win the Olympics after losing three matches in the preliminary round.

Despite becoming a women's volleyball powerhouse in the 21st century, United States still lack an Olympic gold.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament has a very stable competition formula. The following rules apply:\n\n; Qualification\n\n*Twelve teams participate in each event.\n*Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n*Two teams qualify through the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|Men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] (this number was reduced from three prior to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]).\n*Five teams qualify as winners of continental qualification tournaments.\n*The four remaining berths are decided in world qualification tournaments.\n\n; Competition format\n\n*For the first phase, called qualification round, teams are ranked by the [[FIVB World Rankings]] and then divided in two pools of six teams using the [[serpentine system]]. The host nation is always ranked 1.\n*At the qualification round, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. Top four teams in each pool advance, the remaining two leave the competition.\n*At the second phase, usually called final round, teams play quarterfinals, semifinals and finals.\n*For the final round, matches are organized according to the results obtained in the qualification round. Let the top four teams in each pool be A1, A2, A3, A4 (group A); and B1, B2, B3, B4 (group B). Quarterfinals would then be: A1xB4; A2xB3; A3xB2; A4xB1.\n*Winners of quarterfinals play semifinals as follows: (A1/B4) x (A3/B2) ; (A2/B3) x (A4xB1).\n*At the finals, winners of semifinals play for the gold, and losers for the bronze.\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Men's

women consistently since [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]].\n\n[[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], and the former [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], are the only teams to win multiple gold medals at the men's tournament since its introduction. The remaining five editions of the Men's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won each by a different country including [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] and the defunct [[FR Yugoslavia men's national volleyball team|Yugoslavia]].\n\nGold medals are less evenly distributed in women's volleyball than in men's; the fourteen editions of the Women's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won by only five different countries: [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] and the former [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of Olympic volleyball can be traced back to the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], where volleyball was played as part of an American sports demonstration event. Its addition to the Olympic program, however, was given only after [[World War II]], with the foundation of the [[FIVB]] and of some of the continental confederations. In 1957, a special tournament was held during the [[List of IOC meetings|53rd IOC session]] in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], to support such request. The competition was a success, and the sport was officially introduced in [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The Olympic Committee initially dropped volleyball for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]], meeting protests.<ref>{{cite book|title=Black Belt Vol. 2, No. 2|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|year=Mar 1964|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ|quote=Sone Kaminaga black belt.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ/page/n26 27]}}</ref>\n\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament was originally a simple competition, whose format paralleled the one still employed in the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|World Cup]]: all teams played against each other team and then were ranked by number of wins, set average and point average. One disadvantage of this round-robin system is that medal winners could be determined before the end of the games, making the audience lose interest in the outcome of the remaining matches.\n\nTo cope with this situation, the competition was split into two phases: a \"final round\" was introduced, consisting of quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. Since its creation in [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]], this new system has become the standard for the volleyball Olympic tournament, and is usually referred to as the \"Olympic format\".\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has grown steadily since 1964. Since [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], both men's and women's indoor events count 12 participant nations. Each of the five continental volleyball confederations has at least one affiliated national federation involved in the Olympic Games.\n\n===Events===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Bronze in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and silver in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] won gold in [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. In [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], the introduction of a new offensive skill, the back row attack, helped [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] win the competition over the Soviets in a very tight five-setter.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], many of the strongest teams in men's volleyball belonged to the [[Eastern Bloc]], so the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]] did not have as great an effect on these events as it had on the women's. The Soviet Union collected their third Olympic gold medal with a 3\u20131 victory over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]]. With a Soviet-led boycott in [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] confirmed their new volleyball leadership in the Western World by sweeping smoothly over [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] at the finals. In that edition a minor nation, [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], won their first medal, but Italy would rise to prominence in volleyball in later decades. A long-awaited confrontation between the US and Soviet volleyball teams came in the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] final: powerplayers [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]] pushed the United States to a second gold medal setting the issue in favor of the Americans.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], Brazil upset favorites [[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], and Italy for their first Olympic championship. Runners-up Netherlands, with [[Ron Zwerver]] and [[Olof van der Meulen]], came back in the [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|following edition]] for a five-set win over Italy. In spite of their success in other major volleyball competitions in the 1990s, Italy did not fare well at the Olympics. After winning bronze in Atlanta, [[Serbia and Montenegro men's national volleyball team|Serbia and Montenegro]], led by [[Vladimir Grbi\u0107|Vladimir]] and [[Nikola Grbi\u0107]], beat [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] at the final in [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] to secure the gold (in 1996 and 2000 they played under the name [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]).\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], Brazil beat Italy in the final, adding a second gold medal to their record and confirming their role as the men's volleyball superpowers of the 2000s. In [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], United States beat Brazil in the final, winning their third gold medal. Russia won the bronze for the second time by defeating Italy. In the [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] final, Russia came back from a 0\u20132 set deficit, not letting the Brazilians take advantage of any of their 2 match points in the third set. [[Dmitriy Muserskiy]] scored 31 points, which is an Olympic Games record in a final. Italy defeated Bulgaria and took Bronze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivb.org/EN/Olympics/London2012/viewPressRelease.asp?No=36516&Language=en|title=FIVB - London 2012 Olympic Games|author=|date=|website=www.fivb.org|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter coming up short in the previous two editions of the Olympics as runners-up, the Brazilians captured their third gold medal in the history of the competition playing home in [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] after their straight-set victory against Italy in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/brazil-make-triumphant-return-to-the-top?id=64552|title=Brazil make triumphant return to the top of the podium|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> The United States pulled off a comeback from a 0\u20132 deficit to claim the bronze medal with a victory over Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/usa-grab-mens-bronze-with-fantastic-comeback?id=64545|title=USA grab men's bronze with fantastic comeback|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nGold medals appear to be more evenly distributed in men's volleyball than in women's: former Soviet Union (three titles), United States (three) and Brazil (three) are the only teams to have won the tournament more than once. The remaining four editions were won each by a different country. Despite being a major force in men's volleyball since the 1990s, Italy are still the only volleyball powerhouses that lack a gold medal at the Olympic Games.\n\n===Women's winners===\n[[File:Women's Volleyball semifinals - 6.jpg|thumbnail|right|Women's volleyball semifinals match between [[United States women's national volleyball team|USA]] and [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].]]\n\nThe opening edition of the volleyball Olympic tournament, in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]], was won by the host nation [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]]. There followed two victories in a row by the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] and [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] were expected to get their first gold after beating Japan in the 1975 Pre-Olympic Games, but Japan came back again in [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] for one last Olympic gold before losing their status of women's volleyball superpowers.\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott]] of the [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Games]] left many strong volleyball nations like Japan and South Korea out of the games. As a result, the Soviet Union easily secured a third Olympic gold medal. In [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[Eastern bloc]] was, in its turn, boycotting the games, and the Soviet Union did not participate. As a result, host nation [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] won its first medals in volleyball, losing the finals to [[China women's national volleyball team|China]]. With eastern and western nations again involved in the Olympics, the Soviet Union obtained a remarkable victory over [[Peru women's national volleyball team|Peru]] after trailing 0\u20132 in [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988's]] marking one of the most dramatic female matches of the 20th century. The 1988 games were, however, boycotted by Cuba.\n\n[[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] saw a new force go down in Olympic history: organized under the name [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]], the nations of the former Soviet Union that chose to form a combined team easily reached the gold medal game, but did not resist the power play of the young, rising Cuban squad. Led by superstars [[Mireya Luis]] and [[Regla Torres]], Cuba would eventually set the record for consecutive wins in the Olympic Games by also taking the gold in [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] and [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] against China and [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]], respectively.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the winners were once again China. Second were Russia who beat [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in a very tough and dramatic semifinal match after being down 1\u20132, 19\u201324 in the fourth set.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], Brazil finally won the gold, beating the United States in the final and losing only one set in the competition. China were awarded the bronze by beating Cuba. After a troubled start, Brazil secured the double gold in [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] after beating the United States once again in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/olympics/summer/2012/volleyball/story/_/id/8259676/2012-london-olympics-brazil-shocks-us-women-volleyball-gold|title=Brazil wins women's volleyball gold|work=espn.go.com|accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref> Japan won the bronze medal after defeating South Korea.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]], home team Brazil were favorites to once again win the title, thus equalling Cuba's three consecutive gold medals between 1992 and 2000. After winning all of their preliminary round matches without dropping a set, the team was, however, stunned by a young Chinese squad in a tiebreaker in the quarterfinals. China went on to win the title, their third in Olympic history, by beating [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]] in four sets in the gold medal match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/china-crowned-champions-in-rio-de-janeiro?id=64539|title=China crowned champions in Rio de Janeiro|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> In the process, [[Lang Ping]] became the first person to win a gold medal as a player in Los Angeles 1984 and repeat the feat now as a coach in Rio de Janeiro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/lang-ping-becomes-first-person-in-volleyball?id=64550|title=Lang Ping became the first person in volleyball to win Olympic gold as player and coach|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> China also became the first team to win the Olympics after losing three matches in the preliminary round.

Despite becoming a women's volleyball powerhouse in the 21st century, United States still lack an Olympic gold.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament has a very stable competition formula. The following rules apply:\n\n; Qualification\n\n*Twelve teams participate in each event.\n*Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n*Two teams qualify through the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|Men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] (this number was reduced from three prior to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]).\n*Five teams qualify as winners of continental qualification tournaments.\n*The four remaining berths are decided in world qualification tournaments.\n\n; Competition format\n\n*For the first phase, called qualification round, teams are ranked by the [[FIVB World Rankings]] and then divided in two pools of six teams using the [[serpentine system]]. The host nation is always ranked 1.\n*At the qualification round, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. Top four teams in each pool advance, the remaining two leave the competition.\n*At the second phase, usually called final round, teams play quarterfinals, semifinals and finals.\n*For the final round, matches are organized according to the results obtained in the qualification round. Let the top four teams in each pool be A1, A2, A3, A4 (group A); and B1, B2, B3, B4 (group B). Quarterfinals would then be: A1xB4; A2xB3; A3xB2; A4xB1.\n*Winners of quarterfinals play semifinals as follows: (A1/B4) x (A3/B2) ; (A2/B3) x (A4xB1).\n*At the finals, winners of semifinals play for the gold, and losers for the bronze.\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Men's

Men are no longer born, and they have disappeared from all important positions. The male sex has become a dying breed.

On the first occasion some forty mounted men were collected in the Tug before our zariba; but this did not satisfy the Sultan, and he arranged a second \"fantasia,\" in which fully two hundred warriors were engaged. It was the best and most characteristic thing of the kind I had ever seen. A procession was first formed in the river's bed, and on a given signal all dashed off, brandishing their spears and shields. Dressed in tobes of many colours, and sitting loosely on their gaily-caparisoned horses, they engaged in mimic contest with spear and shield, reining their horses upon their haunches when at full gallop, and with wild shouts flinging their spears into the air. Each warrior carried a short-handled whip with a broad raw hide thong, and with it lashed his steed unmercifully. Some of the riders went through regular circus feats, leaping from their horses when at full gallop, picking up objects thrown on the ground, and then remounting. After this had continued for some time they would gallop close to our zariba, and reining up, shout \"Mort, mort\" (\"Welcome, welcome\"), to which we replied, \"Kul liban\" (\"Thanks\").<ref>The Unknown Horn of Africa: An Exploration From Berbera to the Leopard River, by Frank Linsly james, p.67</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Garhajis-Sanaag-Sool.png|thumb|300px|Map showing Garhajis territory in the [[Sanaag]] and [[Sool, Somalia|Sool]] regions, circa 1840]]\nD.

In 1841 Sharmarke with 50 [[Matchlock]] men, 2 [[cannons]] and an army of mounted spearmen managed to invade Zeila and depose its Arab Governor, Mohammed Al Barr. Sharmarke used the canons to fire at the city walls which frightened Al Barr's followers and caused them to flee. Sharmarke succeeded Al Barr as the ruler of Zeila and its dependencies.<ref>First footseps in to Africa, by Richard Burton, p.16-p.30</ref><ref> Sun, sand and Somals; leaves from the note-book of a district commissioner in British Somaliland, by Rayne Henry. p.15-16</ref> Sharmarke's governorship had an instant effect on the city, as he maneuvered to monopolize as much of the regional trade as possible, with his sights set as far as Harar and the Ogaden.<ref>Ethiopia: the Era of the Princes: The Challenge of Islam and Re-unification of the Christian Empire, 1769-1855. p.18 </ref> Having secured Zeila, in 1845 Sharmarke moved on to Berbera which at the time was experiencing instability as a result of a war between the [[Habr Awal]] Reer Yunis Nur and Reer Ahmed Nur sub-clans over the control of Berbera's trade. Sharmarke took advantage of this rivalry and supported the Reer Ahmed Nuh who had since been expelled from Berbera. Sharmarke took over Berbera and  built four [[Martello tower|Martello towers]] in the vicinity of the town and garrisoned them with 30 [[Matchlock]] men. A war ensued with in the city as Reer Yunis Nuh tried gain a foothold within Berbera, the Reer Yunis Nuh were no match for Sharmarke and his modern weapons and thus failed.

These battles are today known as the Rayyad or Guba Wars. It was a volatile era that gave birth to some of the best known Somali poetry.\n\nIn 1874 German Explorer G.A Haggenmacher witnessed the aftermath of a battle between Habr yunis and Ogaden. He wrote:\n<blockquote>The Habr Yunis had many wounded, but were also extremely rich in loot, the estimated number of loot was at least 10,000 camels.<ref>G. A. Haggenmacher's Reise Im Somali-Lande, 1874: Mit Einer Originalkarte by G.A.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1877 the Garhajis under the leadership of Sultan Hersi Aman conquered [[Daroor (woreda)|Daroor]] and subjugated the Haroun sub-clan of the Ogaden, during the battle they captured and subsequently executed their Sultan.<ref>The Unknown Horn of Africa, by James, F. L. (Frank Linsly) 1851-1890; Thrupp, James Godfrey. p. 264.</ref> The Habr Yunis then proceeded to expand into Doolo region and took control of watering wells, grazing land and looted thousands of camels from the Cabdille, Makahil, Ali and Haroun sub clans of the Ogaden, forcing them to leave their homeland and flee south to [[Hiiraan]]. This particular series of conquests was what initiated the famous chains of poems known as ''Guba'' in which [[Ali Dhuh]] a [[Daarood]] poet laments, and berates the Ogadenis for losing so much land and exchanges heated poems with the Ogaden and Habr Yunis.<ref name=PXV>Proceedings of the XVth International Conference of Ethiopian Studies Hamburg (2003), p. 215.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=39JMAgAAQBAJ&pg=RA2-PA171&lpg=RA2-PA171&dq=Ali+Dhuh&source=bl&ots=1zdp4mrsUp&sig=tEhYPccXZpdwFBSYVNZfwrIpPug&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Ali%20Dhuh&f=false|title= Dictionary of African Biography. 1St- Ed.; 1970 , p.171 |first=}}</ref>\n\nHistorian Siegbert Uhlig commenting on the Guba poem writes the following:\n\n<blockquote>From a historical point of view Ali dhuhs poem explicitly details the large gains in traditionally Ogaden territory and wells, and the looting of Ogaden camels by the Isaq. He details the scatterring of the Ogaden clan, their forced migration southwards seeking refuge in the feverish river valleys, and even turning to hunting and farming- measures that were again considered very shameful usually only undertaken by slaves and low-caste Somalis and utterly demeaning for the once great pastoral Ogaden clan. The Ogaden, Ali recounts, have been forced to accept refuge with the clans that defeated them, especially the Habr Yunis, and cannot take revenge. The Isaq are portrayed as particularly callous and shameful in the way they parade looted Ogaden camels in front of their previous owners. Even in translation it is a very evocative poem\".<ref name=PXV/></blockquote>\n\nThe Habr Yunis advance into Ogaden territory was eventually halted by the intervention of the [[British Somaliland|British protectrate]] authorities with assistance from the Ethiopian Empire, who considered the Ogaden their subjects and whose safety was their priority. In one incident the Habar Yunis looted 1330 camels from the Ogaden, but were pressured by the British and the Ethiopians to return the camels to their previous owners. The Habr Yunis obliged and promised to desist in their raids, but despite their promise they continued to successfully raid the Ogadens unhindered up until the British ceded the Haud to Ethiopia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_8YVBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA149&dq=Ogaden+camels+Habr+Yunis&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg4rKyheTZAhULCMAKHRgQCLcQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Ogaden%20camels%20Habr%20Yunis&f=false |title= Churchill and the Mad Mullah of Somaliland ,p.149|first=}}</ref><ref>The Mad Mullah of Somaliland, Douglas Jardine, p.197</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ukw6AQAAMAAJ&q=looted+camels+Habr+yunis&dq=looted+camels+Habr+yunis&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiKrtLfjencAhVsBMAKHQJlAK4Q6AEIVTAJ |title= The Parliamentary Debates (official Report) House of Commons. 4th session of the 28th Parliament through the 1st session of the 48th Parliament, 1914.|first=}}</ref>\n\n===Dervish period===\nThe Garhajis clan played a prominent role in the inception of the [[Dervish state|Dervish movement]] and its subsequent struggle against the [[British Empire]]. Among the prominent members of the Dervish was the Sultan of the Habar Yunis, [[Nur Ahmed Aman]], whose letter to [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] initiated the Dervish rebillion. Nur was the principle agitator that rallied the dervish behind his anti-French [[Catholic missions|Catholic Mission]] campaign that would become the cause of the dervish uprise.<ref>Foreign Department-External-B, August 1899, N. 33-234, NAI, New Delhi, Inclosure 2 in No. 1.

The incident in question was that of a group of Somali children that were converted to Christianity and adopted by the French Catholic Mission at Berbera in 1899. Whether Sultan Nur experienced the incident first hand or whether he was told of it is not clear but what is known is that he propagated the incident in the [[Tariqa]] at Kob Fardod in June 1899 precipitating the religious rebellion that later morphed into the Somali Dervish.<ref>F.O.78/5031,Sayyid Mohamad To The Aidagalla, Enclosed Sadler To Salisbury. 69, 20 August 1899.</ref>\n\nSultan Nur leading his Dervish clansmen participated in numerous battles against the British. These confrontations took place at Samala, Ferdidin, Erigo, Daratoleh and Gumburu. In 1899 Sultan Nur was among the top five (Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, [[Haji Sudi]], Deria Arrale and Deria Gure) wanted leaders of the movement.<ref>Official history of the operations in Somaliland, 1901\u201304 by Great Britain.

In his article Macfayden only identified Sultan Nur's tomb by name out of the four dervish entombed in Taleh:\n\n<blockquote>\"South of the main cave-well is the considerable tomb of Abdullah Hasan\nsenior, well plastered inside and out; it is now said to be empty.

There are still odd bushes\nand signs of cultivation to be seen, but the comparatively deep well in the middle\nis dry. To the east lies a row of four tombs. The most northerly is that of one\nSoldan Nur of the Habr Yunis tribe; the next two, neither being plastered.\nand the first with the top left unfinished, are those of Hawiya notables whose\nnames my Somalis did not know. The most southerly tomb is that of a\nman of the Habr Jaalo tribe. The isolated tomb still farther east is that of\n'AbdullahHasan's mother.

The Gadwein Dervishes who were located in coastal [[Sanaag]] and the towns of  [[Midisho]] and Jidali created complications for the Warsengeli Sultanate, who they regularly raided. The Warsengeli who were at that time allied with the British called for their assistance. Consequently, in 1912 the British sent the warship [[HMS Philomel (1890)|HMS Philomel]] and shelled the Gadwein Dervishes, pushing them from the coast and inland towards Las Dureh.<ref>Official History of the Operation Volume 1, p.49</ref><ref>The Mad Mullah of Somaliland , p.252-p.258</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= \nhttp://www.drabruzzi.com/Mad%20Mullah%20of%20Northern%20Somaliland.pdf |title= The \"Mad Mullah\" and Northern Somalia,by Robert L.Hess|first=}}</ref><ref name=\"kings coll1\">{{cite web|url= \nhttp://www.kingscollections.org/exhibitions/archives/armies-abroad/dervish-state/establishment#Gallery[gallery1]/1/ |title= King's College London, King's collection: Ismay's summary as Intelligence Officer (1916-1918) of Mohammed Abdullah Hassan|first=}}</ref> The Dervish forces of Sanaag were supplied with arms and munitions by two Habr Yunis men of the Musa Arreh clan, namely, Haji Hirsi of [[Maydh]] and Bulhan Ali, they both operated with in [[Yemen]], the former being stationed at [[Mukalla]] and the latter at [[Aden]].

This resulted in a shoot out in which Captain Allan Gibb, a Dervish war veteran, was shot and killed.

The Indian [[Sepoys]] having been sent back to the sub-continent forced the Government to rely on the Somali B company, but when ordered to open fire on the hostile Habr Yunis clansmen, they declined. The British had to resort to sending Indian troops from Aden as they could not trust the native Somalis. Instead The B company was tasked with collecting the fine imposed on the Rer Ainanshe.

From the information available, his murder does not appear to have been premeditated, but it inevitably had a disturbing effect upon the surrounding tribes, and immediate dispositions of troops became necessary in order to ensure the apprehension and punishment of those responsible for the murder. On 27th February the Governor telegraphed that, in order to meet the situation which had arisen, he required two aeroplanes for purposes of demonstration, and suggested that two aeroplanes from the Royal Air Force Detachment at Aden should fly over to Berber a from Aden.

His coronation took place after the victorious battle of Lafaruug in which he successfully led the Eidagale in battle and defeated the Absame tribes, permanently pushing them out of present-day Waqooyi Galbeed region. After witnessing his leadership skills, noble conduct and valiance, the Isaaq chiefs recognized him as their Grand Sultan. Guled's Sultanate predates the Habr Yunis Sultanate, which broke off from Eidagale tutelage several decades after the start of his rule. Sultan Guled ruled the Isaaq from the 1750's up until his death in the early 19th century, where he was succeeded by his eldest son Farah. Sultan Farah further expanded the influence of the Sultanate by establishing ties with various Muslim polities across the Gulf, particularly the [[Al-Qasimi]] family whom he regularly corresponded with in regard to military action against the British Navy who blockaded Berbera and threatening to cut off vital trade.<ref>http://t-3abersbeelculture.blogspot.com/2014/03/blog-post_14.html?m=1</ref> \n\nFor centuries, the tomb of saint [[Aw Barkhadle]], which is located between [[Berbera]] and [[Hargeisa]], was used by the Isaaq clans to settle disputes and to swear oaths of alliances under a holy relic attributed to [[Bilal Ibn Rabah]].

The Kingdom's territory encompassed the lands settled by the Habr Yunis tribe of the Garhajis clan. The Habr Yunis Sultans received a tax in the form of an annual tribute of livestock from their subjects and they regularly taxed the trade caravans that went through their territory. Moreover, the sultanate had a significant standing army which was used to enforce the taxation, as well as to defend their realm.<ref > The Journal of The anthropological institute of Great Britain and Ireland| Vol.21 p. 161 </ref><ref > Journal of the East Africa Natural History Society: Official Publication of the Coryndon Memorial Museum Vol.17 p. 76</ref> \n\nThe first Habr Yunis chief to assume the title Sultan was Sugulleh Ainanshe of the Ismail Arrah clan, his father Ainanshe was a traditional chief. Sugulleh was succeeded by his son Diriyeh Sugule in the late 18th century. Sultan Diriyeh reigned for more than 50 years and was eventually succeeded by his grandson Hersi Aman. Hersi is most notable for expanding Habr Yunis territory in the Haud and for engaging the first Rer Sugulleh civil war which resulted in his death. Sultan Hersi's death caused a decade-long civil war when his nephew Nur was crowned Sultan and his great uncle Awad Sultan Deriyeh and eldest living son of sultan Deriyeh declared himself a rival sultan in 1881.The two Sultans were now at war with each other and divided the Kingdoms territory between themselves, with Nur being based in the Toyo plains and Awd establishing himself at Burao. In the 1890's Sultan Awad was killed in a battle which resulted in Sultan Nur facing no opposition and was the sole ruler of the Habr Yunis Sultanate up until he started the Dervish uprising, which resulted in his uncle Madar Hersi being crowned. The Habr Yunis were now divided into two factions: pro-Dervish and anti-Dervish, the former being ruled by Sultan Nur and the latter the newly crowned Sultan Madar. After Nur's death in the Dervish camp, the Habr Yunis elders crowned his son Dolal, and with the Dervish defeat none of his heirs succeeded him leaving Madar's descendants as the undisputed Sultans of the Habr Yunis.<ref >Cosmos: communicazioni sui progressi recenti e notevoli della geografia e delle scienze affini di Guido Cora p. 201</ref><ref>''British Somaliland'' by Drake Borckmen, p. 79 - 82, 1912</ref> \n\n===Sultans of the Habr Yunis===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Name\n!Reign\nFrom\n!Reign\nTill\n\n|-\n|1\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" | '''Ainasha Hersi''' (''traditional chief'')\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|2\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Sugulleh''' Ainasha (''first sultan'')\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|3\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Diriyeh''' ''Sultan'' Sugulleh Ainasha \n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|4\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Hersi''' ''Aman'' ''Sultan'' Diriyeh\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|5\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Nur''' ''Ahmed'' Aman ''Sultan'' Diriyeh \n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|6\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Awad''' ''Sultan'' Diiriye\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|7\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Dolal''' ''Sultan'' Nur\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|8\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Madar''' Hersi ''Sultan'' cabdale\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|9\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Ali''' ''Sultan'' Madar Hersi\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|10\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Osman''' ''Sultan'' Ali ''Sultan'' Madar\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n| \n|\n|}\n\n== Clan tree==\n\nA summarized clan family tree of the major Garhajis subclan of Habar Yonis is presented below.<ref name=\"musa 140\">{{cite web|url= \nhttps://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yPVWJxtLG6IC&pg=PA140&dq=Musa+Arreh&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiHmcfOjvjZAhVBW8AKHQWxDUIQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Musa%20Arreh&f=false|title= A grammar of the Somali Language, p.140|first=}}</ref><ref name=\"survey 147\">A general survey of the Somaliland Protectorate 1944-1950, p147</ref>\n*Sheikh Ishaaq Bin Ahmed (Sheikh Ishaaq)\n**''Habar Habuusheed''\n***  Ahmed (Tol-Ja'lo) \n***  Muuse (Habr Je'lo)\n***  Ibrahiim (Sanbuur)\n***  Muhammad ('Ibraan)\n** ''Habar Magaadle''\n*** Abdirahman (Subeer Awal)\n***  Ayub\n***  Muhammad (Arap)\n*** '''Ismail''' ('''Garhajis''')\n**** Said Ismail (Habar Yonis) \n*****Ali Said\n*****Arreh Said\n******Ishaq Arreh\n*******Abdalle Ishaq \n*******Qaasin Ishaq\n******Musa Arreh\n*******Hassan Musa,Ibrahim Musa,Damal Musa (Dir Roble)\n******Ismail Arreh\n*******Sa'ad Yunis\n*******Musa Ismail\n********Salah Musa (Turwa)\n********Salah Musa\n********Mohammed Musa (Urursuge)\n********Yunis Musa\n*******Abdallah Ismail\n********Idris (idrays)\n********Musa Abdallah\n********Omar Abdallah \n*********Hersi Osman\n**********Said Hersi\n***********Rer Warsama (Waraba)\n***********Rer Weid\n**********Abdi Hersi\n**********Ainanshe Hersi (The Ainanshe Hersi are the royal sub-clan of the Habr Yunis and the hereditary Sultanate is currently held by them.)<ref name=gram>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=89k8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA141&dq=Farah+Ainanshe&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiaqOrNovLZAhWPW8AKHS2CCBgQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&q=Farah%20Ainanshe&f=false |title= A grammar of the Somali language, p. 141.|first=}}</ref><ref name=\"survey 147\"/>\n***********Sugulle Ainanshe \n***********Eise Ainanshe\n***********Wa\u2019ays Ainanshe\n***********Suban Ainanshe\n***********Abdi Ainanshe\n***********Egal Ainanshe\n***********Omar Ainanshe\n***********Koshin Ainanshe \n***********Maygag Ainanshe \n***********Butiye Ainanshe\n***********Ahmed Ainanshe\n***********Farah Ainanshe\n***********Samaale Ainanshe\n***********Hersi Ainanshe\n***********Guled Ainanshe\n***********Gutale Ainanshe\n***********Liibaan Ainanshe \n*Daud Ismail (Eidagale) (The Eidagale sub-clan are divided into the following sections)<ref name=\"musa 140\"/>\n**Abokor Musa\n**Rer Yunis Abdurahman\n**Ba delo\n**Gashanbur\n**Damal Yera\n**Rer Esa\n\n==Notable people==\n\n* [[Abdirahman Ahmed Ali Tuur]],The first President of Somaliland and the last Somali National Movement(SNM) Chairman. \n* [[Abdullahi Qarshe]], Somali musician, poet and playwright;

On the first occasion some forty mounted men were collected in the Tug before our zariba; but this did not satisfy the Sultan, and he arranged a second \"fantasia,\" in which fully two hundred warriors were engaged. It was the best and most characteristic thing of the kind I had ever seen. A procession was first formed in the river's bed, and on a given signal all dashed off, brandishing their spears and shields. Dressed in tobes of many colours, and sitting loosely on their gaily-caparisoned horses, they engaged in mimic contest with spear and shield, reining their horses upon their haunches when at full gallop, and with wild shouts flinging their spears into the air. Each warrior carried a short-handled whip with a broad raw hide thong, and with it lashed his steed unmercifully. Some of the riders went through regular circus feats, leaping from their horses when at full gallop, picking up objects thrown on the ground, and then remounting. After this had continued for some time they would gallop close to our zariba, and reining up, shout \"Mort, mort\" (\"Welcome, welcome\"), to which we replied, \"Kul liban\" (\"Thanks\").<ref>The Unknown Horn of Africa: An Exploration From Berbera to the Leopard River, by Frank Linsly james, p.67</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Garhajis-Sanaag-Sool.png|thumb|300px|Map showing Garhajis territory in the [[Sanaag]] and [[Sool, Somalia|Sool]] regions, circa 1840]]\nD.

In 1841 Sharmarke with 50 [[Matchlock]] men, 2 [[cannons]] and an army of mounted spearmen managed to invade Zeila and depose its Arab Governor, Mohammed Al Barr.

Sharmarke succeeded Al Barr as the ruler of Zeila and its dependencies.<ref>First footseps in to Africa, by Richard Burton, p.16-p.30</ref><ref> Sun, sand and Somals; leaves from the note-book of a district commissioner in British Somaliland, by Rayne Henry. p.15-16</ref> Sharmarke's governorship had an instant effect on the city, as he maneuvered to monopolize as much of the regional trade as possible, with his sights set as far as Harar and the Ogaden.<ref>Ethiopia: the Era of the Princes: The Challenge of Islam and Re-unification of the Christian Empire, 1769-1855. p.18 </ref> Having secured Zeila, in 1845 Sharmarke moved on to Berbera which at the time was experiencing instability as a result of a war between the [[Habr Awal]] Reer Yunis Nur and Reer Ahmed Nur sub-clans over the control of Berbera's trade. Sharmarke took advantage of this rivalry and supported the Reer Ahmed Nuh who had since been expelled from Berbera. Sharmarke took over Berbera and  built four [[Martello tower|Martello towers]] in the vicinity of the town and garrisoned them with 30 [[Matchlock]] men. A war ensued with in the city as Reer Yunis Nuh tried gain a foothold within Berbera, the Reer Yunis Nuh were no match for Sharmarke and his modern weapons and thus failed.

These battles are today known as the Rayyad or Guba Wars. It was a volatile era that gave birth to some of the best known Somali poetry.\n\nIn 1874 German Explorer G.A Haggenmacher witnessed the aftermath of a battle between Habr yunis and Ogaden. He wrote:\n<blockquote>The Habr Yunis had many wounded, but were also extremely rich in loot, the estimated number of loot was at least 10,000 camels.<ref>G. A. Haggenmacher's Reise Im Somali-Lande, 1874: Mit Einer Originalkarte by G.A.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1877 the Garhajis under the leadership of Sultan Hersi Aman conquered [[Daroor (woreda)|Daroor]] and subjugated the Haroun sub-clan of the Ogaden, during the battle they captured and subsequently executed their Sultan.<ref>The Unknown Horn of Africa, by James, F. L. (Frank Linsly) 1851-1890; Thrupp, James Godfrey. p. 264.</ref> The Habr Yunis then proceeded to expand into Doolo region and took control of watering wells, grazing land and looted thousands of camels from the Cabdille, Makahil, Ali and Haroun sub clans of the Ogaden, forcing them to leave their homeland and flee south to [[Hiiraan]]. This particular series of conquests was what initiated the famous chains of poems known as ''Guba'' in which [[Ali Dhuh]] a [[Daarood]] poet laments, and berates the Ogadenis for losing so much land and exchanges heated poems with the Ogaden and Habr Yunis.<ref name=PXV>Proceedings of the XVth International Conference of Ethiopian Studies Hamburg (2003), p. 215.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=39JMAgAAQBAJ&pg=RA2-PA171&lpg=RA2-PA171&dq=Ali+Dhuh&source=bl&ots=1zdp4mrsUp&sig=tEhYPccXZpdwFBSYVNZfwrIpPug&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Ali%20Dhuh&f=false|title= Dictionary of African Biography. 1St- Ed.; 1970 , p.171 |first=}}</ref>\n\nHistorian Siegbert Uhlig commenting on the Guba poem writes the following:\n\n<blockquote>From a historical point of view Ali dhuhs poem explicitly details the large gains in traditionally Ogaden territory and wells, and the looting of Ogaden camels by the Isaq. He details the scatterring of the Ogaden clan, their forced migration southwards seeking refuge in the feverish river valleys, and even turning to hunting and farming- measures that were again considered very shameful usually only undertaken by slaves and low-caste Somalis and utterly demeaning for the once great pastoral Ogaden clan. The Ogaden, Ali recounts, have been forced to accept refuge with the clans that defeated them, especially the Habr Yunis, and cannot take revenge. The Isaq are portrayed as particularly callous and shameful in the way they parade looted Ogaden camels in front of their previous owners.

The Eidagale caravan merchants founded several inland trade [[entrep\u00f4ts]] in the interior, which also includes the modern city of [[Hargeisa]], founded in the 19th century as a caravan junction between [[Berbera]] and the Somali interior.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Frederick|title=\nAn Account of the British Settlement of Aden in Arabia|date=1877|publisher=Cengage Gale|pages=41|language=english}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Journal of African Languages|date=1963|publisher=University of Michigan Press|pages=27|language=english}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Seventeen Trips Through Somaliland and a Visit to Abyssinia|last=Carlos-Swayne|first=Harald|publisher=|year=1900|isbn=|location=|pages=96}}</ref>\n\n===Sultans of the Eidagale===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Name\n!Reign\nFrom\n!Reign\nTill\n\n|-\n|1\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" | '''Abdi Eisa''' ('Traditional Chief'')\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |1680\n|1750\n|\n|-\n|2\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Guled ''' Abdi (''First Sultan'')\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |1750\n|1808\n|\n|-\n|3\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Farah''' ''Sultan'' Guled\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |1808\n|1845\n|\n|-\n|4\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Hassan''' ''Sultan'' Farah\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |1845\n|1870\n|\n|-\n|5\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Diriye''' ''Sultan'' Hassan\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |1870\n|1939\n|\n|-\n|6\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Abdilahi''' ''Sultan'' Diriye\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |1939\n|1967\n|\n|-\n|7\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Rashid''' '' Sultan'' Abdilahi\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |1967\n|1969\n|\n|-\n|8\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Abdulkadir''' ''Sultan'' Rashid\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |1969\n|1975\n|\n|-\n|9\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Mohamed''' ''Sultan'' Abdikadir\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |1975\n|\n|\n|}\n\n==Sultanate of the Habr Yunis==\n\n[[File:Sultan Nur Map.png|thumb|500px|1896 German map showing Sultan Nur's Domain in the [[Togdheer]] area]]\nThe Habr Yunis Sultanate was a Somali Kingdom that ruled parts of the Horn of Africa during the 18th and 19th centuries. The Kingdom's territory encompassed the lands settled by the Habr Yunis tribe of the Garhajis clan. The Habr Yunis Sultans received a tax in the form of an annual tribute of livestock from their subjects and they regularly taxed the trade caravans that went through their territory. Moreover, the sultanate had a significant standing army which was used to enforce the taxation, as well as to defend their realm.<ref > The Journal of The anthropological institute of Great Britain and Ireland| Vol.21 p. 161 </ref><ref > Journal of the East Africa Natural History Society: Official Publication of the Coryndon Memorial Museum Vol.17 p. 76</ref> \n\nThe first Habr Yunis chief to assume the title Sultan was Sugulleh Ainanshe of the Ismail Arrah clan, his father Ainanshe was a traditional chief. Sugulleh was succeeded by his son Diriyeh Sugule in the late 18th century. Sultan Diriyeh reigned for more than 50 years and was eventually succeeded by his grandson Hersi Aman. Hersi is most notable for expanding Habr Yunis territory in the Haud and for engaging the first Rer Sugulleh civil war which resulted in his death. Sultan Hersi's death caused a decade-long civil war when his nephew Nur was crowned Sultan and his great uncle Awad Sultan Deriyeh and eldest living son of sultan Deriyeh declared himself a rival sultan in 1881.The two Sultans were now at war with each other and divided the Kingdoms territory between themselves, with Nur being based in the Toyo plains and Awd establishing himself at Burao. In the 1890's Sultan Awad was killed in a battle which resulted in Sultan Nur facing no opposition and was the sole ruler of the Habr Yunis Sultanate up until he started the Dervish uprising, which resulted in his uncle Madar Hersi being crowned. The Habr Yunis were now divided into two factions: pro-Dervish and anti-Dervish, the former being ruled by Sultan Nur and the latter the newly crowned Sultan Madar. After Nur's death in the Dervish camp, the Habr Yunis elders crowned his son Dolal, and with the Dervish defeat none of his heirs succeeded him leaving Madar's descendants as the undisputed Sultans of the Habr Yunis.<ref >Cosmos: communicazioni sui progressi recenti e notevoli della geografia e delle scienze affini di Guido Cora p. 201</ref><ref>''British Somaliland'' by Drake Borckmen, p. 79 - 82, 1912</ref> \n\n===Sultans of the Habr Yunis===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Name\n!Reign\nFrom\n!Reign\nTill\n\n|-\n|1\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" | '''Ainasha Hersi''' (''traditional chief'')\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|2\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Sugulleh''' Ainasha (''first sultan'')\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|3\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Diriyeh''' ''Sultan'' Sugulleh Ainasha \n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|4\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Hersi''' ''Aman'' ''Sultan'' Diriyeh\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|5\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Nur''' ''Ahmed'' Aman ''Sultan'' Diriyeh \n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|6\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Awad''' ''Sultan'' Diiriye\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|7\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Dolal''' ''Sultan'' Nur\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|8\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Madar''' Hersi ''Sultan'' cabdale\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|9\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Ali''' ''Sultan'' Madar Hersi\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n|\n|\n|-\n|10\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |''Sultan'' '''Osman''' ''Sultan'' Ali ''Sultan'' Madar\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap\" |\n| \n|\n|}\n\n== Clan tree==\n\nA summarized clan family tree of the major Garhajis subclan of Habar Yonis is presented below.<ref name=\"musa 140\">{{cite web|url= \nhttps://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yPVWJxtLG6IC&pg=PA140&dq=Musa+Arreh&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiHmcfOjvjZAhVBW8AKHQWxDUIQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Musa%20Arreh&f=false|title= A grammar of the Somali Language, p.140|first=}}</ref><ref name=\"survey 147\">A general survey of the Somaliland Protectorate 1944-1950, p147</ref>\n*Sheikh Ishaaq Bin Ahmed (Sheikh Ishaaq)\n**''Habar Habuusheed''\n***  Ahmed (Tol-Ja'lo) \n***  Muuse (Habr Je'lo)\n***  Ibrahiim (Sanbuur)\n***  Muhammad ('Ibraan)\n** ''Habar Magaadle''\n*** Abdirahman (Subeer Awal)\n***  Ayub\n***  Muhammad (Arap)\n*** '''Ismail''' ('''Garhajis''')\n**** Said Ismail (Habar Yonis) \n*****Ali Said\n*****Arreh Said\n******Ishaq Arreh\n*******Abdalle Ishaq \n*******Qaasin Ishaq\n******Musa Arreh\n*******Hassan Musa,Ibrahim Musa,Damal Musa (Dir Roble)\n******Ismail Arreh\n*******Sa'ad Yunis\n*******Musa Ismail\n********Salah Musa (Turwa)\n********Salah Musa\n********Mohammed Musa (Urursuge)\n********Yunis Musa\n*******Abdallah Ismail\n********Idris (idrays)\n********Musa Abdallah\n********Omar Abdallah \n*********Hersi Osman\n**********Said Hersi\n***********Rer Warsama (Waraba)\n***********Rer Weid\n**********Abdi Hersi\n**********Ainanshe Hersi (The Ainanshe Hersi are the royal sub-clan of the Habr Yunis and the hereditary Sultanate is currently held by them.)<ref name=gram>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=89k8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA141&dq=Farah+Ainanshe&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiaqOrNovLZAhWPW8AKHS2CCBgQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&q=Farah%20Ainanshe&f=false |title= A grammar of the Somali language, p. 141.|first=}}</ref><ref name=\"survey 147\"/>\n***********Sugulle Ainanshe \n***********Eise Ainanshe\n***********Wa\u2019ays Ainanshe\n***********Suban Ainanshe\n***********Abdi Ainanshe\n***********Egal Ainanshe\n***********Omar Ainanshe\n***********Koshin Ainanshe \n***********Maygag Ainanshe \n***********Butiye Ainanshe\n***********Ahmed Ainanshe\n***********Farah Ainanshe\n***********Samaale Ainanshe\n***********Hersi Ainanshe\n***********Guled Ainanshe\n***********Gutale Ainanshe\n***********Liibaan Ainanshe \n*Daud Ismail (Eidagale) (The Eidagale sub-clan are divided into the following sections)<ref name=\"musa 140\"/>\n**Abokor Musa\n**Rer Yunis Abdurahman\n**Ba delo\n**Gashanbur\n**Damal Yera\n**Rer Esa\n\n==Notable people==\n\n* [[Abdirahman Ahmed Ali Tuur]],The first President of Somaliland and the last Somali National Movement(SNM) Chairman. \n* [[Abdullahi Qarshe]], Somali musician, poet and playwright;
