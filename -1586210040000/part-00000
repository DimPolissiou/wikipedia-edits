Directed by [[John Gray (director)|John Gray]], the first presentation aired as part of ''[[Hallmark Hall of Fame]]'' on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network on May 1, 1994.\n\n==Plot==\n{{More plot|date=May 2016}}\nNurse Susan cares for six week old Annie, an [[HIV]] positive baby. Rather than seeing her being left at Treemont Centre where she will wait to die, Susan decides that she wants her. Reasoning with her son David, who is understandably concerned about the idea, Susan files and signs adoption papers and Annie is legally her foster daughter. Next, Susan calls for a babysitter and finds one in the form of Dorothy.\n\nOne year later at Annie's first birthday, Alice comes to tell Susan that Annie's mother, Linda, wants her back as she has finished her drug rehab and has taken the notion to a court hearing with Alice representing her. Knowing that Linda knows nothing about taking care of Annie, Susan fights but loses the case however she is granted supervised visits.\n\nOn one of these visit, Susan finds that Linda is surprisingly apathetic towards her own daughter which only causes her cold demeanor towards Linda to harden even more so.\n\nDespite agreeing to Susan's instructions for Annie's care Linda refuses to phone her and let her know of how things are proceeding. When Susan and David find Linda's slovenly apartment they remove Annie from the premises as the living conditions could further weaken Annie's already compromised immune system but unfortunately this only results in the judge awarding custody to Linda the very next day.\n\nSeeing no alternative, Susan takes Linda into her home as she needs to be in decent accommodations and Susan needs to be with Annie. Although many heated confrontations arise, Linda soon settles in and explains the complications she faced during her childhood. Likewise, Susan opens up to Linda and tells her that her parent don't talk to her anymore as they disowned her when she was pregnant with David because she and David's father weren't married at the time.\n\nThis inspires Linda to come to the conclusion that the reason she wanted Annie was so she could do at least one thing right and be a mother to her as she had fouled up her own life so many times. Days later, Susan calls Linda's mother to let her know of Linda's progress. This ends in failure as Linda's mother gives Susan the funeral home number. Linda then laments sadly on how she has tried to find some sort of forgiveness for all the bad choices she has made throughout her life and how she couldn't believe it when Susan told her that she was disowned by her parents and that they can live their lives without knowing their own daughter or even their own grandson while Susan herself is such a good person and mother.\n\nOn the way to have a smoke, Linda collapses in the hallway and is immediately rushed to the hospital. On the way to the emergency room, Linda informs the doctors that she probably won't live through the ordeal and that when it's time for her to go let her go. Susan visits her and Linda vows to go to school and make something of herself like Susan did if she makes it but voices that she won't live to do so. Susan expresses hope that Linda does pull through as she has a lot to give.\n\nNext day at home, a doctor comes and informs Susan that Annie is no longer testing for the HIV antibodies. Apparently Annie only contracted the HIV antibodies from Linda when she was born but not the virus in and of itself. The doctors thought she had HIV due to her low T-cell count and her susceptibility to her infections. The doctor explains that this means Annie will live a long, normal and healthy life.\n\nSusan then revisits Linda and tells her that Annie doesn't have HIV and is going to do all the things that any other child can.\n\nSometime later, Linda recovers and returns to Susan's home where she is warmly welcomed. Linda checks on Annie, saying that she is going to have a great life. To everyone's surprise Linda prepares to leave for a hospice as she doesn't want Annie to see her die. With great reluctance Susan allows Linda to follow through on this idea as it is the right thing to do. Linda gives Annie a letter to deliver to Susan and then departs. Susan reads Linda's letter: it is the maternity paper wavering all legal custody of Annie to Susan.\n\nSusan and Annie wave goodbye to Linda as she leaves for the hospice.\n\n==Critical reception==\n''[[AllMovie]]'' gave the film three out of five stars and described it as a \"touching drama\".<ref name=\"allmovie1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/a-place-for-annie-v154246 |title=A Place for Annie (1994) - Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast |publisher=AllMovie |date= |accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave a favorable review and said: \"There are a few crucial twists in this TV movie that don't bear giving away.

The all pervasive nature of slavery in this period in Central Asia is shown by the 17th century records of one Juybari Sheikh, a [[Naqshbandi]] [[Sufi]] leader, owning over 500 slaves, forty of whom were specialists in pottery production while the others were engaged in agricultural work.<ref>Muhammad Talib, Malab al-alibn, Oriental Studies Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Tashkent, Uzbekistan , Ms. No. 80, fols 117a-18a.</ref> High demand for skilled slaves, and India's larger and more advanced textile industry, agricultural production and tradition of architecture demonstrated to its neighbours that skilled-labour was abundant in the subcontinent leading to enslavement and export of large numbers of skilled labour as slaves, following their successful invasions.<ref>Peter Jackson, The Delhi Sultanate: A Political and Military History (Cambridge, 1999), See also Indian textile industry in Scott Levi, The Indian Diaspora in Central Asia and its Trade, 1550\u20131900 (Leiden, 2002)</ref>\n\nAfter sacking [[Delhi]], [[Timur]] enslaved several thousand skilled artisans, presenting many of these slaves to his subordinate elite, although reserving the masons for use in the construction of the [[Bibi-Khanym Mosque]] in [[Samarkand]].<ref>Beatrice Manz, The Rise and Rule of Tamerlane (Cambridge, 1989); [[Tapan Raychaudhuri]] and Irfan Habib, eds, The Cambridge Economic History of India, vol. 1, (Hyderabad, 1984); Surendra Gopal, 'Indians in Central Asia, Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries', Presidential Address, Medieval India Section of the Indian History Congress, New Delhi, February 1992 (Patna, 1992)</ref> Young female slaves fetched higher market price than skilled construction slaves, sometimes by 150%.<ref>E.

D. Mandelslo, a German itinerant writer, \"have many slaves of both sexes, whom they employ not only on and about their persons, but also upon the business they are capable of, for what they get comes with the master.\"\n\nThe Dutch, too, largely dealt in slaves. They were mainly Abyssian, known in India as Habshis or Sheedes. The curious mixed race in [[Kanara]] on the West coast has traces of these slaves.<ref name=\"tribuneindia.com\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020720/windows/slice.htm | title=The Tribune - Windows - Slice of history}}</ref>\n\nThe Dutch Indian Ocean slave trade was primarily mediated by the Dutch East India Company, drawing captive labour from three commercially closely linked regions: the western, or [[Southeast Africa]], [[Madagascar]], and the [[Mascarene Islands]] (Mauritius and Reunion); the middle, or Indian subcontinent (Malabar, Coromandel, and the Bengal/Arakan coast); and the eastern, or [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[New Guinea]] (Irian Jaya), and the southern [[Philippines]].\n\nThe Dutch traded slaves from fragmented or weak small states and stateless societies in the East beyond the sphere of Islamic influence, to the company's Asian headquarters, the \"Chinese colonial city\" of Batavia (Jakarta), and its regional centre in coastal Sri Lanka. Other destinations included the important markets of Malacca (Melaka) and Makassar (Ujungpandang), along with the plantation economies of eastern Indonesia (Maluku, Ambon, and Banda Islands), and the agricultural estates of the southwestern Cape Colony (South Africa).\n\nOn the Indian subcontinent, Arakan/Bengal, Malabar, and Coromandel remained the most important source of forced labour until the 1660s. Between 1626 and 1662, the Dutch exported on an average 150\u2013400 slaves annually from the Arakan-Bengal coast. During the first thirty years of Batavia's existence, Indian and Arakanese slaves provided the main labour force of the company's Asian headquarters. Of the 211 manumitted slaves in Batavia between 1646 and 1649, 126 (59.71%) came from South Asia, including 86 (40.76%) from Bengal. Slave raids into the Bengal estuaries were conducted by joint forces of Magh pirates, and Portuguese traders (chatins) operating from Chittagong outside the jurisdiction and patronage of the Estado da India, using armed vessels (galias). These raids occurred with the active connivance of the Taung-ngu (Toungoo) rulers of Arakan. The eastward expansion of the Mughal Empire, however, completed with the conquest of Chittagong in 1666, cut off the traditional supplies from Arakan and Bengal.  Until the Dutch seizure of the Portuguese settlements on the Malabar coast (1658\u201363), large numbers of slaves were also captured and sent from India's west coast to Batavia, Ceylon, and elsewhere. After 1663, however, the stream of forced labour from Cochin dried up to a trickle of about 50\u2013100 and 80\u2013120 slaves per year to Batavia and Ceylon, respectively.\n\nIn contrast with other areas of the Indian subcontinent, Coromandel remained the centre of a sporadic slave trade throughout the seventeenth century. In various short-lived expansions accompanying natural and human-induced calamities, the Dutch exported thousands of slaves from the east coast of India. A prolonged period of drought followed by famine conditions in 1618\u201320 saw the first large-scale export of slaves from the Coromandel coast in the seventeenth century. Between 1622 and 1623, 1,900 slaves were shipped from central Coromandel ports, like Pulicat and Devanampattinam. Company officials on the coast declared that 2,000 more could have been bought if only they had the funds.\n\nThe second expansion in the export of Coromandel slaves occurred during a famine following the revolt of the Nayaka Indian rulers of South India (Tanjavur, Senji, and Madurai) against Bijapur overlordship (1645) and the subsequent devastation of the Tanjavur countryside by the Bijapur army. Reportedly, more than 150,000 people were taken by the invading Deccani Muslim armies to Bijapur and Golconda. In 1646, 2,118 slaves were exported to Batavia, the overwhelming majority from southern Coromandel. Some slaves were also acquired further south at Tondi, Adirampatnam, and Kayalpatnam.\n\nA third phase in slaving took place between 1659 and 1661 from Tanjavur as a result of a series of successive Bijapuri raids. At Nagapatnam, Pulicat, and elsewhere, the company purchased 8,000\u201310,000 slaves, the bulk of whom were sent to Ceylon while a small portion were exported to Batavia and Malacca. A fourth phase (1673\u201377) started from a long drought in Madurai and southern Coromandel starting in 1673, and intensified by the prolonged Madurai-Maratha struggle over Tanjavur and punitive fiscal practices. Between 1673 and 1677, 1,839 slaves were exported from the Madurai coast alone. A fifth phase occurred in 1688, caused by poor harvests and the Mughal advance into the Karnatak. Thousands of people from Tanjavur, mostly girls and little boys, were sold into slavery and exported by Asian traders from Nagapattinam to Aceh, Johor, and other slave markets. In September 1687, 665 slaves were exported by the English from Fort St. George, Madras.  Finally, in 1694\u201396, when warfare once more ravaged South India, a total of 3,859 slaves were imported from Coromandel by private individuals into Ceylon.<ref>S.

The all pervasive nature of slavery in this period in Central Asia is shown by the 17th century records of one Juybari Sheikh, a [[Naqshbandi]] [[Sufi]] leader, owning over 500 slaves, forty of whom were specialists in pottery production while the others were engaged in agricultural work.<ref>Muhammad Talib, Malab al-alibn, Oriental Studies Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Tashkent, Uzbekistan , Ms. No. 80, fols 117a-18a.</ref> High demand for skilled slaves, and India's larger and more advanced textile industry, agricultural production and tradition of architecture demonstrated to its neighbours that skilled-labour was abundant in the subcontinent leading to enslavement and export of large numbers of skilled labour as slaves, following their successful invasions.<ref>Peter Jackson, The Delhi Sultanate: A Political and Military History (Cambridge, 1999), See also Indian textile industry in Scott Levi, The Indian Diaspora in Central Asia and its Trade, 1550\u20131900 (Leiden, 2002)</ref>\n\nAfter sacking [[Delhi]], [[Timur]] enslaved several thousand skilled artisans, presenting many of these slaves to his subordinate elite, although reserving the masons for use in the construction of the [[Bibi-Khanym Mosque]] in [[Samarkand]].<ref>Beatrice Manz, The Rise and Rule of Tamerlane (Cambridge, 1989); [[Tapan Raychaudhuri]] and Irfan Habib, eds, The Cambridge Economic History of India, vol. 1, (Hyderabad, 1984); Surendra Gopal, 'Indians in Central Asia, Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries', Presidential Address, Medieval India Section of the Indian History Congress, New Delhi, February 1992 (Patna, 1992)</ref> Young female slaves fetched higher market price than skilled construction slaves, sometimes by 150%.<ref>E.

D. Mandelslo, a German itinerant writer, \"have many slaves of both sexes, whom they employ not only on and about their persons, but also upon the business they are capable of, for what they get comes with the master.\"\n\nThe Dutch, too, largely dealt in slaves. They were mainly Abyssian, known in India as Habshis or Sheedes. The curious mixed race in [[Kanara]] on the West coast has traces of these slaves.<ref name=\"tribuneindia.com\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020720/windows/slice.htm | title=The Tribune - Windows - Slice of history}}</ref>\n\nThe Dutch Indian Ocean slave trade was primarily mediated by the Dutch East India Company, drawing captive labour from three commercially closely linked regions: the western, or [[Southeast Africa]], [[Madagascar]], and the [[Mascarene Islands]] (Mauritius and Reunion); the middle, or Indian subcontinent (Malabar, Coromandel, and the Bengal/Arakan coast); and the eastern, or [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[New Guinea]] (Irian Jaya), and the southern [[Philippines]].\n\nThe Dutch traded slaves from fragmented or weak small states and stateless societies in the East beyond the sphere of Islamic influence, to the company's Asian headquarters, the \"Chinese colonial city\" of Batavia (Jakarta), and its regional centre in coastal Sri Lanka. Other destinations included the important markets of Malacca (Melaka) and Makassar (Ujungpandang), along with the plantation economies of eastern Indonesia (Maluku, Ambon, and Banda Islands), and the agricultural estates of the southwestern Cape Colony (South Africa).\n\nOn the Indian subcontinent, Arakan/Bengal, Malabar, and Coromandel remained the most important source of forced labour until the 1660s. Between 1626 and 1662, the Dutch exported on an average 150\u2013400 slaves annually from the Arakan-Bengal coast. During the first thirty years of Batavia's existence, Indian and Arakanese slaves provided the main labour force of the company's Asian headquarters. Of the 211 manumitted slaves in Batavia between 1646 and 1649, 126 (59.71%) came from South Asia, including 86 (40.76%) from Bengal. Slave raids into the Bengal estuaries were conducted by joint forces of Magh pirates, and Portuguese traders (chatins) operating from Chittagong outside the jurisdiction and patronage of the Estado da India, using armed vessels (galias). These raids occurred with the active connivance of the Taung-ngu (Toungoo) rulers of Arakan. The eastward expansion of the Mughal Empire, however, completed with the conquest of Chittagong in 1666, cut off the traditional supplies from Arakan and Bengal.  Until the Dutch seizure of the Portuguese settlements on the Malabar coast (1658\u201363), large numbers of slaves were also captured and sent from India's west coast to Batavia, Ceylon, and elsewhere. After 1663, however, the stream of forced labour from Cochin dried up to a trickle of about 50\u2013100 and 80\u2013120 slaves per year to Batavia and Ceylon, respectively.\n\nIn contrast with other areas of the Indian subcontinent, Coromandel remained the centre of a sporadic slave trade throughout the seventeenth century. In various short-lived expansions accompanying natural and human-induced calamities, the Dutch exported thousands of slaves from the east coast of India. A prolonged period of drought followed by famine conditions in 1618\u201320 saw the first large-scale export of slaves from the Coromandel coast in the seventeenth century. Between 1622 and 1623, 1,900 slaves were shipped from central Coromandel ports, like Pulicat and Devanampattinam. Company officials on the coast declared that 2,000 more could have been bought if only they had the funds.\n\nThe second expansion in the export of Coromandel slaves occurred during a famine following the revolt of the Nayaka Indian rulers of South India (Tanjavur, Senji, and Madurai) against Bijapur overlordship (1645) and the subsequent devastation of the Tanjavur countryside by the Bijapur army. Reportedly, more than 150,000 people were taken by the invading Deccani Muslim armies to Bijapur and Golconda. In 1646, 2,118 slaves were exported to Batavia, the overwhelming majority from southern Coromandel. Some slaves were also acquired further south at Tondi, Adirampatnam, and Kayalpatnam.\n\nA third phase in slaving took place between 1659 and 1661 from Tanjavur as a result of a series of successive Bijapuri raids. At Nagapatnam, Pulicat, and elsewhere, the company purchased 8,000\u201310,000 slaves, the bulk of whom were sent to Ceylon while a small portion were exported to Batavia and Malacca. A fourth phase (1673\u201377) started from a long drought in Madurai and southern Coromandel starting in 1673, and intensified by the prolonged Madurai-Maratha struggle over Tanjavur and punitive fiscal practices. Between 1673 and 1677, 1,839 slaves were exported from the Madurai coast alone. A fifth phase occurred in 1688, caused by poor harvests and the Mughal advance into the Karnatak. Thousands of people from Tanjavur, mostly girls and little boys, were sold into slavery and exported by Asian traders from Nagapattinam to Aceh, Johor, and other slave markets. In September 1687, 665 slaves were exported by the English from Fort St. George, Madras.  Finally, in 1694\u201396, when warfare once more ravaged South India, a total of 3,859 slaves were imported from Coromandel by private individuals into Ceylon.<ref>S.

On 19 voyages between 1677 and 1732, the mortality rate was somewhat lower (22.7%). See Shell, \"Slavery at the Cape of Good Hope, 1680\u20131731,\" p. 332.

Politically it is a [[Social Democrats (Sweden)|Social Democratic]] stronghold. The city is a well-known [[hockeytown|ice hockey town]], with its main team [[Skellefte\u00e5 AIK]] playing in the Swedish top division: the [[Swedish Hockey League|SHL]], which they have won on several occasions.\n\nThe city was incorporated in 1845 and grew to its current population size mostly in the 1950s and 1960s, growing only slowly since. It is the second largest city in V\u00e4sterbotten after [[Ume\u00e5]] and is located roughly halfway between it and [[Lule\u00e5]]. The [[Skellefte River]] passes through the city and it is located around {{convert|15|km|mi}} from the [[Bothnian Bay]] open sea. Skellefte\u00e5 is served by [[Skellefte\u00e5 Airport]], abbreviated as SKF locally known as ''Falmark'' because of the village nearby, also around {{convert|15|km|mi}} from the city centre to the south.\n\n==History==\nThe name Skellefte\u00e5 is recorded to having been spelled as ''Skelepht'' in 1327. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} On [[Carta marina]] the name is spelt ''Skellitta''. The origin of the name remains unknown, but is assumed to be of Sami origin.\n\nFrom the 14th century on, attempts were made to Christianize Skellefte\u00e5. A parish was formed and a church built. However, \u2013 for the most part \u2013 the entire large Northern Swedish territory of [[Norrland]] was not Christianized until several hundred years after the rest of Sweden, and many northern areas such as Skellefte\u00e5 remained unexplored well past the Middle Ages.\n\nNot before the very end of the 17th century did the indigenous [[Sami people]] of Northern Sweden begin turning to Christianity, much due to the efforts by the Northern Swedish superintendent [[Mathias Steuchius]], who worked hard to accomplish this.

32,775 inhabitants in 2010.<ref name=scb /> The municipality had approximately 72,000 inhabitants at the end of 2013.<ref name=scb />\n\nThe city is a historically industrial city with mining being a large industry, especially for gold \u2013 hence the nickname \"Gold Town\". Politically it is a [[Social Democrats (Sweden)|Social Democratic]] stronghold. The city is a well-known [[hockeytown|ice hockey town]], with its main team [[Skellefte\u00e5 AIK]] playing in the Swedish top division: the [[Swedish Hockey League|SHL]], which they have won on several occasions.\n\nThe city was incorporated in 1845 and grew to its current population size mostly in the 1950s and 1960s, growing only slowly since. It is the second largest city in V\u00e4sterbotten after [[Ume\u00e5]] and is located roughly halfway between it and [[Lule\u00e5]]. The [[Skellefte River]] passes through the city and it is located around {{convert|15|km|mi}} from the [[Bothnian Bay]] open sea. Skellefte\u00e5 is served by [[Skellefte\u00e5 Airport]], abbreviated as SKF locally known as ''Falmark'' because of the village nearby, also around {{convert|15|km|mi}} from the city centre to the south.\n\n==History==\nThe name Skellefte\u00e5 is recorded to having been spelled as ''Skelepht'' in 1327. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} On [[Carta marina]] the name is spelt ''Skellitta''. The origin of the name remains unknown, but is assumed to be of Sami origin.\n\nFrom the 14th century on, attempts were made to christianize Skellefte\u00e5. A parish was formed and a church built. However, \u2013 for the most part \u2013 the entire large Northern Swedish territory of [[Norrland]] was not christianized until several hundred years after the rest of Sweden, and many northern areas such as Skellefte\u00e5 remained unexplored well past the Middle Ages.\n\nNot before the very end of the 17th century did the indigenous [[Sami people]] of Northern Sweden begin turning to Christianity, much due to the efforts by the Northern Swedish superintendent [[Mathias Steuchius]], who worked hard to accomplish this. Several [[Noaidi|Sami priests]] were killed for this reason.\n\nEventually, the reason for the sudden awakened interest towards Skellefte\u00e4lven and the surrounding areas were the great northern fishing grounds of [[salmon]].  The increased demand for fish was sparked by a stricter enforcement of the annual month-long [[fasting]] by the Catholic Church, whereby meat was substituted by fish. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThe actual city of Skellefte\u00e5 is one of the youngest cities of Norrland.

The site was called Wells Landing, Wella having previously founded Wellsville and Wellsburg along the [[Ohio River]] and having served in the Virginia legislature from Brooke County in 1793.<ref>Luke N. Peters, Sistersville and Tyler County (Arcadia Publishing 2007) p. 7</ref> The Virginia General Assembly created Tyler County in 1814, weeks before Wells' death, and a court session was held at Wells' house in Sistersville (\"Welkin\") in 1815 (the plat having included lots for a courthouse and lawyers' offices), but in 1816 voters selected [[Middlebourne, West Virginia|Middlebourne]], on Middle Island Creek about halfway between Pennsylvania and the Kanawha salt springs (and which incorporated in 1813) as the county seat. The Virginia General Assembly chartered Sistersville in 1839.<ref>{{cite book|last=Capace|first=Nancy|title=Encyclopedia of West Virginia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K30UKW0aewgC&pg=PA191|year=1999|publisher=North American Book Dist LLC|isbn=978-0-403-09843-9|page=191}}</ref> By 1850, Sistersville had grain and wool carding mills. The ferry across the Ohio River which James Jolly had started decades earlier would still be operating in the 21st century. The Russell Building (built in 1840 as a ferry house) would survive many floods and later serve as a market and the offices of the ''Oil Review'' edited by J. Hanford McCoy.<ref name=\"Peters p. 15\">Peters p. 15</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Virginia Secession Convention of 1861]], Sistersville and Tyler County were divided, but leaned toward the Union (s did their militia group, the \"Sistersville Blues\"). Nonetheless, Confederate sympathizers seized militia equipment at Sistersville, including dozens of rifles and two small cannons, and the Ohio militiamen sent to protect Parkersburg took more than a month to recover them.<ref>Henry Edmund Matheny, Wood County, West Virginia in Civil War Times, with an account of Guerilla Warfare in the Little Kanawha Valley (Trans-Allegheny Books, Parkersburg 1987) pp. 95, 131</ref> Judge [[Abraham Soper]], a New York lawyer and New Jersey judge who had moved to Sisterville in 1847, became Tyler County's representative to the [[Wheeling Convention]] and the West Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1862\u20131863. Fellow delegates elected him their President for the reconvened session of February 1863 (because Congress required the new state's constitution to contain an antislavery provision, which President Abraham Lincoln approved in December 1862). On March 26, voters overwhelmingly ratified the new Constitution (28,321 to 572), so President Lincoln soon acknowledged the revision as adequate thus creating the state of [[West Virginia]].<ref>Gooden, Randall S. \"Constitutional Convention of 1861\u201363.\" e-WV: The West Virginia Encyclopedia. 08 December 2011. available at https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/1566</ref> When West Virginia's first legislature divided Tyler County in to districts in 1863, Sistersville was in the Lincoln District.\n\nFor years, many believed that oil and natural gas was under Sistersville, because natural gas and salt water had been bubbling up in [[Burning Springs, West Virginia|Burning Springs]] since before 1836 (in what became [[Wirt County, West Virginia|Wirt County]] and development there became an oil boom beginning in 1860). However, the drill Philo Stocking used in 1865 became stuck before it reached oil, but he made sure to retain oil and gas rights to land he sold, which later made him rich.<ref name=\"Peters p. 15\"/> The large Sistersville Oil Field was only confirmed in 1891, with the \"Joshua Russell Pole Cat No. 1\", successfully drilled by Russell and Edward Paden near Pole Cat creek after they drained salt water for a year.<ref>Peters, p. 11</ref> The find proved one of the more productive wells in the field, still producing oil (some refined as gasoline) in 1925. The find occurred as the oil fields in [[Oil City, Pennsylvania]] (developed beginning 1861) were running dry and technology had progressed to drain the initial water cap above the oil. Within a few years, Sistersville had ballooned into a city of 15,000 people.<ref>Peters p. 9</ref> In 1893, Sisterville (briefly) was the \"oil capital of the world\".<ref>abstract of paper presented to 1996 meeting of American Association of Petroleum Geologists, available at https://www.osti.gov/biblio/411936-sistersville-west-virginia-oil-capital-world</ref> Unlike some of the Pennsylvania boom towns which became ghost towns, Sistersville invested in infrastructure, and the railroad had arrived in 1884. A spur connected Sistersville to the county seat at Middlebourne.\n\nA disastrous flood of the Ohio River in 1913 (which crested at 51.5 feet at Wheeling upriver and 69.9 feet downriver at Cincinnati) caused considerable damage in Sistersville,<ref>Peters pp. 11825-121</ref> Otherwise, the disasters Sistersville faced usually involved fire, long before a 1970 fire that destroyed a historic downtown block. Sistersville long had several fire brigades or pumping companies. A gasoline plant was built at the oil field and in 1911 the Carter Oil company built the world's largest gasoline print south of SIstersville, which had an explosion in 1913 but rebuilt, such that the American Petroleum Institute cited for its gas development work in 1925.<ref>Peters p. 125-126</ref> Sistersville took pride in Tyler High School graduate Cecil Harland Underwood (1922-) who at age 22 represented the county in the House of Delegates, and became the youngest-ever West Virginia governor in 1956, then in 1996 was elected again and became the state's oldest governor.<ref>Peters p. 47</ref>\n\n===Historical sites===\nThe [[Sistersville City Hall]] is a historic city hall building listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The City Hall is contributing property of the [[Sistersville Historic District]].\n\nOther listed historic properties in Sistersville include the [[Wells-Schaff House]] (a/k/a \"Welkin\" was built beginning in 1832 by Eli Wells, son of Charles Wells, who wanted a residence outside the flood plain, and expanded in 1896 and renovated circa 1935), the [[Wells Inn]] (opened 1895, built by Eli Wells's son Ephraim who fostered local business development), the [[E.

County]], [[West Virginia]], United States, along the [[Ohio River]]. The population was 1,396 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].  The [[Sistersville Ferry]] crosses the Ohio River to the [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] community of Fly in [[Monroe County, Ohio]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-CWFN4uL8L8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Ohio River Guidebook | publisher=Inland Waterways Books | date=2008 | accessdate=22 November 2013 | author=Hay, Jerry M. | pages=28| isbn=9781605852171 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nSistersville was named because two sisters, Sarah Wells McCoy and Delilah Wells Grier, inherited the land underlying the town from their father, pioneer Charles Wells, in 1815 and laid out the town.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kenny|first=Hamill|title=West Virginia Place Names: Their Origin and Meaning, Including the Nomenclature of the Streams and Mountains|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015009099824;view=1up;seq=606;size=125|year=1945|publisher=The Place Name Press|location=Piedmont, WV|page=582}}</ref> Wells had settled on the sandy bottomland with his second wife, Elizabeth Prather and many of his 22 children (Sarah and Delilah were the 12th and 17th; his first wife Michal Owings had died in 1783 after giving birth to 10 children). The site was called Wells Landing, Wella having previously founded Wellsville and Wellsburg along the [[Ohio River]] and having served in the Virginia legislature from Brooke County in 1793.<ref>Luke N. Peters, Sistersville and Tyler County (Arcadia Publishing 2007) p. 7</ref> The Virginia General Assembly created Tyler County in 1814, weeks before Wells' death, and a court session was held at Wells' house in Sistersville (\"Welkin\") in 1815 (the plat having included lots for a courthouse and lawyers' offices), but in 1816 voters selected [[Middlebourne, West Virginia|Middlebourne]], on Middle Island Creek about halfway between Pennsylvania and the Kanawha salt springs (and which incorporated in 1813) as the county seat. The Virginia General Assembly chartered Sistersville in 1839.<ref>{{cite book|last=Capace|first=Nancy|title=Encyclopedia of West Virginia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K30UKW0aewgC&pg=PA191|year=1999|publisher=North American Book Dist LLC|isbn=978-0-403-09843-9|page=191}}</ref> By 1850, Sistersville had grain and wool carding mills. The ferry across the Ohio River which James Jolly had started decades earlier would still be operating in the 21st century. The Russell Building (built in 1840 as a ferry house) would survive many floods and later serve as a market and the offices of the ''Oil Review'' edited by J. Hanford McCoy.<ref name=\"Peters p. 15\">Peters p. 15</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Virginia Secession Convention of 1861]], Sistersville and Tyler County were divided, but leaned toward the Union (s did their militia group, the \"Sistersville Blues\"). Nonetheless, Confederate sympathizers seized militia equipment at Sistersville, including dozens of rifles and two small cannons, and the Ohio militiamen sent to protect Parkersburg took more than a month to recover them.<ref>Henry Edmund Matheny, Wood County, West Virginia in Civil War Times, with an account of Guerilla Warfare in the Little Kanawha Valley (Trans-Allegheny Books, Parkersburg 1987) pp. 95, 131</ref> Judge [[Abraham Soper]], a New York lawyer and New Jersey judge who had moved to Sisterville in 1847, became Tyler County's representative to the [[Wheeling Convention]] and the West Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1862-1863. Fellow delegates elected him their President for the reconvened session of February 1863 (because Congress required the new state's constitution to contain an antislavery provision, which President Abraham Lincoln approved in December 1862). On March 26, voters overwhelmingly ratified the new Constitution (28,321 to 572), so President Lincoln soon acknowledged the revision as adequate thus creating the state of [[West Virginia]].<ref>Gooden, Randall S. \"Constitutional Convention of 1861\u201363.\" e-WV: The West Virginia Encyclopedia. 08 December 2011. available at https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/1566</ref> When West Virginia's first legislature divided Tyler County in to districts in 1863, Sistersville was in the Lincoln District.\n\nFor years, many believed that oil and natural gas was under Sistersville, because natural gas and salt water had been bubbling up in [[Burning Springs, West Virginia|Burning Springs]] since before 1836 (in what became [[Wirt County, West Virginia|Wirt County]] and development there became an oil boom beginning in 1860). However, the drill Philo Stocking used in 1865 became stuck before it reached oil, but he made sure to retain oil and gas rights to land he sold, which later made him rich.<ref name=\"Peters p. 15\"/> The large Sistersville Oil Field was only confirmed in 1891, with the \"Joshua Russell Pole Cat No. 1\", successfully drilled by Russell and Edward Paden near Pole Cat creek after they drained salt water for a year.<ref>Peters, p. 11</ref> The find proved one of the more productive wells in the field, still producing oil (some refined as gasoline) in 1925. The find occurred as the oil fields in [[Oil City, Pennsylvania]] (developed beginning 1861) were running dry and technology had progressed to drain the initial water cap above the oil. Within a few years, Sistersville had balooned into a city of 15,000 people.<ref>Peters p. 9</ref> In 1893, Sisterville (briefly) was the \"oil capital of the world\".<ref>abstract of paper presented to 1996 meeting of American Association of Petroleum Geologists, available at https://www.osti.gov/biblio/411936-sistersville-west-virginia-oil-capital-world</ref> Unlike some of the Pennsylvania boom towns which became ghost towns, Sistersville invested in infrastructure, and the railroad had arrived in 1884. A spur connected Sistersville to the county seat at Middlebourne.\n\nA disastrous flood of the Ohio River in 1913 (which crested at 51.5 feet at Wheeling upriver and 69.9 feet downriver at Cincinnati) caused considerable damage in Sistersville,<ref>Peters pp. 11825-121</ref> Otherwise, the disasters Sistersville faced usually involved fire, long before a 1970 fire that destroyed a historic downtown block. Sistersville long had several fire brigades or pumping companies. A gasoline plant was built at the oil field and in 1911 the Carter Oil company built the world's largest gasoline print south of SIstersville, which had an explosion in 1913 but rebuilt, such that the American Petroleum Institute cited for its gas development work in 1925.<ref>Peters p. 125-126</ref> Sistersville took pride in Tyler High School graduate Cecil Harland Underwood (1922-) who at age 22 represented the county in the House of Delegates, and became the youngest-ever West Virginia governor in 1956, then in 1996 was elected again and became the state's oldest governor.<ref>Peters p. 47</ref>\n\n===Historical sites===\nThe [[Sistersville City Hall]] is a historic city hall building listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The City Hall is contributing property of the [[Sistersville Historic District]].\n\nOther listed historic properties in Sistersville include the [[Wells-Schaff House]] (a/k/a \"Welkin\" was built beginning in 1832 by Eli Wells, son of Charles Wells, who wanted a residence outside the flood plain, and expanded in 1896 and renovated circa 1935), the [[Wells Inn]] (opened 1895, built by Eli Wells's son Ephraim who fostered local business development), the [[E. A. Durham House]] (built circa 1921 for oil executive E.A. Durham), and the [[Wells-Twyford House]] (built beginning 1854 by Eli Wells and owned by his heirs until acquired by the Twyford family, descended from Elizabeth Wells Archer, a different family than the Charles Wells descendants).\n\n==Geography==\nSistersville is located at {{coord|39|33|42|N|80|59|52|W|type:city}} (39.561615, -80.997791).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|0.53|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-25}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sistersville 1896.jpg|thumb|Map of Sistersville 1896]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 351\n|1870= 304\n|1880= 386\n|1890= 469\n|1900= 2979\n|1910= 2684\n|1920= 3238\n|1930= 3072\n|1940= 2702\n|1950= 2313\n|1960= 2331\n|1970= 2246\n|1980= 2367\n|1990= 1797\n|2000= 1588\n|2010= 1396\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1297\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-24}}</ref> of 2010, there were 1,396 people, 593 households, and 355 families living in the city.

Originally the head of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and later part of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], it changed hands between [[Russian Empire|Imperial]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet Russia]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], and Lithuania multiple times. It was especially often the site of conflict [[Interwar period|after the end of World War I]] and during [[World War II]]. It officially became the capital of independent, modern-day Lithuania when the Soviet Union recognized the country's independence in August 1991.\n\n==Grand Duchy of Lithuania==\nThe earliest settlements in the area of present-day Vilnius appear to be of [[mesolithic]] origin. Numerous [[archaeology|archaeological]] findings in different parts of the city prove that the area has been inhabited by peoples of various cultures since the early [[Middle Ages]]. Initially a [[Baltic peoples|Baltic]] settlement, later it was also inhabited by [[Slavs]], [[Jews]] and Germans. Some historians identify the city with [[Voruta]], a forgotten capital of [[Mindaugas|King Mindaugas]].\n\nThe city was first mentioned in written sources as Vilna in 1323 as the capital city of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] in the [[letters of Gediminas]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rowell|first1=Stephen Christopher|title=Chartularium Lithuaniae res gestas magni ducis Gedeminne illustrans \u2013 Gedimino lai\u0161kai|date=2003|publisher=Leidykla Vaga|location=Vilnius|url=http://www.epaveldas.lt/recordText/LNB/C1B0002960629/Gedimino_+laiskai.pdf?exId=315462&seqNr=2#Gedimino%20laiskai.indt:.56765:2344|accessdate=7 June 2017}}</ref> Gediminas built his wooden castle on a hill in the city. The city became more widely known after he wrote a circular letter of invitation to Germans and Jews to the principal [[Hanseatic League|Hansa]] towns in 1325, offering free access into his domains to men of every order and profession. Vilnius was granted [[Magdeburg rights|city rights]] by [[Jogaila]] in 1387, following the [[Christianization of Lithuania]] and the construction of the [[Vilnius Cathedral]]. The town was initially populated by local [[Lithuanians]], but soon the population began to grow as [[artisan|craftsmen]] and [[merchants]] of other nationalities settled in the city.\n\n[[File:Vilnius in 14th c.jpg|thumb|The earliest known depiction of Vilnius, late 14th century<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arhiv.gov.si/en/media_room/news/article/1217/5516/9a84f34162/ |title=Presentation of the earliest known depiction of the Lithuanian capital |accessdate=29 April 2012 |publisher=Archives of Slovenia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216105613/http://www.arhiv.gov.si/en/media_room/news/article/1217/5516/9a84f34162/ |archive-date=16 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://uifs.zrc-sazu.si/?q=/node/256 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120718164942/http://uifs.zrc-sazu.si/?q=/node/256 |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 July 2012 |title=Noch einmal zur sogenannten b\u00f6hmischen Stra\u00dfenkarte in den Sammlungen des Archivs der Republik Slowenien |language=Slovenian, German |journal=Acta Historiae Artis Slovenica |first=Janez |last=H\u00f6fler |year=2001 |volume=6 |issn=1408-0419 |publisher=Scientific Research Centre, Slovenian Academy of Arts and Sciences}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Mikalojus Church.jpg|221 px|thumb|left|[[St. Nicholas Church, Vilnius|St. Nicholas]], the oldest church in Lithuania built before 1387]]\n[[File:Bastion of Vilnius Defence Wall02.JPG|221px|thumb|left|Remaining [[Wall of Vilnius]] fragment]]\n\nAccording to a tale, tired after a busy hunting day, [[Gediminas]] had a prophetic dream about an [[iron]] [[wolf]] howling on a top of the hill.

During this campaign Henry Bolingbroke also bought captured Lithuanian princes and then apparently took them back to England. King Henry's second expedition to [[Lithuania]] in 1392 illustrates the financial benefits to the Order of these guest crusaders. His small army consisted of over 100 men, including [[longbow]] archers and six minstrels, at a total cost to the Lancastrian purse of \u00a34,360. Much of this sum benefited the local economy through the purchase of silverware and the hiring of boats and equipment. Despite the efforts of Bolingbroke and his English crusaders, two years of attacks on Vilnius proved fruitless.\n\nBetween 1503 and 1522, for the sake of protection from [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] attacks, the city was surrounded by [[Vilnius city wall|defensive walls]] that had nine [[city gate|gates]] and three towers. Communities of [[Lithuanians]], [[Jews]], [[Ruthenians]], and [[Germans]] were present in different areas of Vilnius. The Orthodox inhabitants concentrated in the eastern part of the city left of the \"[[Pilies Street|Castle Street]]\", while mostly Germans and Jews occupied the western side of the city around the \"German Street\". The town reached the peak of its development under the reign of [[Sigismund II Augustus]], Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland, who relocated there in 1544. In the 16th century Vilnius became a constantly growing and developing city, as Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland [[Sigismund II Augustus]] and his mother [[Queen dowager|queen]] [[Bona Sforza]] were spending much of their time in the [[Royal Palace of Lithuania]].\n\nThe [[Polonization]] of Vilnius proceeded through the influx of Polish elements and assimilation of non-Polish burghers. It started in the late 14th century with the arrival of Polish clergy, followed by artisans and merchants; they migrated in larger numbers after the Polish court of Sigismund August moved to the city.<ref name=\"Ochmanski\">Jerzy Ochma\u0144ski, \"The National Idea in Lithuania from the 16th to the First Half of the 19th Century: The Problem of Cultural-Linguistic Differentiation\", ''Harvard Ukrainian Studies'', Vol. X.

It officially became the capital of independent, modern-day Lithuania when the Soviet Union recognized the country's independence in August 1991.\n\n==Grand Duchy of Lithuania==\nThe earliest settlements in the area of present-day Vilnius appear to be of [[mesolithic]] origin.

The Orthodox inhabitants concentrated in the eastern part of the city left of the \"[[Pilies Street|Castle Street]]\", while mostly Germans and Jews occupied the western side of the city around the \"German Street\". The town reached the peak of its development under the reign of [[Sigismund II Augustus]], Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland, who relocated there in 1544. In the 16th century Vilnius became a constantly growing and developing city, as Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland [[Sigismund II Augustus]] and his mother [[Queen dowager|queen]] [[Bona Sforza]] were spending much of their time in the [[Royal Palace of Lithuania]].\n\nThe [[Polonization]] of Vilnius proceeded through the influx of Polish elements and assimilation of non-Polish burghers. It started in the late 14th century with the arrival of Polish clergy, followed by artisans and merchants; they migrated in larger numbers after the Polish court of Sigismund August moved to the city.<ref name=\"Ochmanski\">Jerzy Ochma\u0144ski, \"The National Idea in Lithuania from the 16th to the First Half of the 19th Century: The Problem of Cultural-Linguistic Differentiation\", ''Harvard Ukrainian Studies'', Vol. X.

The Museum of Jewish culture was founded there in 1919, and [[YIVO]] \u2013 Institute for Jewish Research, was founded there in 1924. A number of important Jewish cultural institutions including theatres, newspapers and magazines, museums and schools, and Jewish PEN-Club were created before [[Second World War]] in Vilnius.

As a result of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] and subsequent Soviet invasion, the territories of Eastern Poland were occupied by [[Red Army]], which seized the city [[Battle of Wilno (1939)|following a one-day defence]] on 19 September 1939.

In exchange Lithuania agreed to allow Soviet military bases to be established in strategic parts of the country. Lithuanian envoys were under pressure, because at the same time there were talks about attaching entire Vilnius region to [[Belarusian Soviet Republic]].<ref>Ma\u010diulis & Stali\u016bnas 2015, p. 173-174</ref> Only one fifth of [[Vilnius region]] was actually given back to Lithuania, despite the fact that the Soviets were recognizing the whole region as a part of Lithuania while it was still under Polish control.

Apparently, the Lithuanian government was deliberately slowing down the transfer of the capital back to Vilnius due to fears that the Soviet military presence around the city <!--Soviet base in Nowa Wilejka--> would enable the Russians to overthrow the Lithuanian government if it were based there.\n\n[[File:Celebrations of Vilnius return to Lithuania near Vilnius Cathedral in 1939.jpg|thumb|250 px|Lithuanian army entering Vilnius]]\n[[File:Lithuanian tanks in capital Vilnius 1939.jpg|thumb|left|Lithuanian tanks in Vilnius]]\n[[File:Lithuanian soldier in Vilnius 1939.jpg|thumb|250 px|Lithuanian soldier observing Vilnius]]\nAnnexation of Vilnius was greeted with rejoice among Lithuanians, the whole generation was raised in believe that Lithuania cannot be truly itself without a city of Vilnius, so recent events were commonly perceived as an act of a historical justice.

The same decision was taken in case of [[Society of Friends of Science in Wilno|Society of Friends of Science]] (est. 1907), which has been permitted to function even under the oppressive Tsarist Russia rule and other Polish scientific institutions. In the process of ''[[Lithuanization]]'' Polish language books were removed from stores and Polish language street names were replaced with new, in Lithuanian. Polish offices, schools, charitable social and cultural organizations, stores and businesses were closed. By June 1940 only two institutions in the entire city offered instruction in the Polish language, while roughly 4000 Polish teachers lost their jobs.<ref name=\"Piotrowski\"/> The [[displaced person|refugees]], many of whom were Poles and Jews who moved to the city in order to avoid being captured by the Germans, were denied free movement, and by 28 March 1940, all people who had not been citizens of the town in October 1920, were declared to be refugees.<ref name=\"Bauer\"/> Altogether, some 12,000 people were granted Lithuanian citizenship, while 150,000 of the city's inhabitants, mostly Poles, were declared foreigners, excluded from many jobs and even prohibited from riding on trains.<ref name=\"Piotrowski\"/>\n\n===Soviet occupation===\nThe process of moving the capital was not yet finished when in June 1940, despite Lithuanian resistance,{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Vilnius was again seized by the [[Soviet Union]] and became the capital of the [[Lithuanian SSR]].

In the old town centre two [[Vilna Ghetto|ghetto]]s were set up for the large [[Jews|Jewish]] population \u2013 the smaller of which was \"liquidated\" by October. The second ghetto lasted until 1943, though its population was regularly decimated in so called ''Aktionen''. A failed Jewish ghetto uprising on 1 September 1943, could not prevent its final destruction.{{fact|date=June 2019}} About 95% of the local Jewish population was murdered. Many of them were among 100,000 victims of the [[Ponary massacre|mass executions in Paneriai]], about 10 kilometers west of the old town centre. Most of the remaining 30,000 victims of the massacre were Poles \u2013 [[POW]]s, [[intelligentsia]] and members of the [[Armia Krajowa]], which at the time was fighting against both Germans and [[Dubingiai_massacre#Further_reprisals|Lithuanians]].\n\n==Soviet occupation==\nThe Germans were forced to leave Vilnius in July 1944 by the combined pressure from the [[Polish Home Army]] ([[Operation Ostra Brama]]) and the [[Red Army]] ([[Battle of Vilnius (1944)]]). In 1944\u20131947 the opponents of the regime, included were captured, interrogated in the NKVD Palace in [[Luki\u0161k\u0117s Square]], executed and buried in the [[Tuskul\u0117nai Manor]] park.\n\n[[File:KGB Vilnius.JPG|left|thumb|Monument to the victims of [[KGB]] terror in Vilnius.]]\nThe Soviets decided that Vilnius was to become again part of the [[Lithuanian SSR]].

On January 13, during the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] attack on the State Radio and Television Building and the [[Vilnius TV Tower]], known as the [[January Events]], 14 people were killed and more than 700 were seriously injured. The Soviet Union finally recognized Lithuanian independence in August 1991, after the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991]].\n\nThe importance of Vilnius for Belarus remained at the end of the 20th century. In June 1989 Vilnius was the site of the [[Belarusian Popular Front]] conference as the Belorussian Soviet authorities would not allow the event to take place in Belarus. At the beginning of 21st century several institutes such as the [[European Humanities University]] and the independent sociology center [[NISEPI]] persecuted in Belarus by the government of [[Alexander Lukashenko]] have found an asylum in Vilnius.\n\nIn the years following its independence, Vilnius has been rapidly evolving and improving, transforming from a Soviet dominated enclave into a modern European city in less than 15 years.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of Vilnius history]]\n* [[History of Lithuania]]\n* [[History of Poland]]\n* [[Vilnius]]\n* [[Ethnic history of the Vilnius region]]\n* [[Lithuanian partisans]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{see also|Timeline of Vilnius#Bibliography}}\n*{{cite book | first = Jerzy | last = Borzecki | title = The Soviet-Polish Peace of 1921 and the Creation of Interwar Europe | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 2008}}\n* Theodore R.

It was granted town status in 1817.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} Between the 1860s and 1917, the town was a place of political exile, with some of the more prominent exiles including the [[Poles|Polish]] writer [[Wac\u0142aw Sieroszewski]], as well as Bolshevik revolutionaries [[Ivan Babushkin]] and [[Viktor Nogin]].\n\n==Administrative and municipal status==\nAs an [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|inhabited locality]], Verkhoyansk is classified as a town under district jurisdiction.<ref name=\"SakhaR_admlist\">''Registry of the Administrative-Territorial Divisions of the Sakha Republic''</ref> Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is incorporated within [[Verkhoyansky District]] as the '''[[Town of district significance|Town]] of Verkhoyansk'''.<ref name=\"SakhaR_admlist\" /> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the Town of Verkhoyansk is incorporated within Verkhoyansky Municipal District as '''Verkhoyansk Urban Settlement'''.<ref name=\"Ref531\">Law #173-Z #353-III</ref>\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nThere is a [[inland port|river port]], an [[airport]], a [[fur]]-collecting depot, and the center of a [[reindeer]]-raising area.

Average monthly temperatures range from {{convert|-45.4|C}} in January to {{convert|+16.5|C}} in July. Mean monthly temperatures are below freezing from October through April and exceed {{convert|+10|C}} from June through August, with the intervening months of May and September constituting very short transitional seasons. Despite being located within the Arctic Circle, Verkhoyansk has an extreme [[subarctic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfd'') dominated much of the year by [[anticyclone|high pressure]]. This has the effect of cutting off the region from warming influences in winter and together with a lack of cloud cover leads to extensive heat losses during the cooler months.\n\nVerkhoyansk is one of the places considered the northern [[Pole of Cold]], the other being [[Oymyakon]], located 629 km (391 miles) away by air.

Mean monthly temperatures are below freezing from October through April and exceed {{convert|+10|C}} from June through August, with the intervening months of May and September constituting very short transitional seasons. Despite being located within the Arctic circle, Verkhoyansk has an extreme [[subarctic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfd'') dominated much of the year by [[anticyclone|high pressure]]. This has the effect of cutting off the region from warming influences in winter and together with a lack of cloud cover leads to extensive heat losses during the cooler months.\n\nVerkhoyansk is one of the places considered the northern [[Pole of Cold]], the other being [[Oymyakon]], located 629 km (391 miles) away by air.

Benfica sections}}\n'''Sport Lisboa e Benfica''' \"'''B'''\", commonly known as '''Benfica B''', is a Portuguese professional [[association football|football]] team based in [[Seixal]]. Founded in 1999, dissolved in 2006, and restarted in 2012, it is the [[reserve team]] of Portuguese club [[S.L. Benfica]]. They play in the [[LigaPro]], holding home matches at [[Futebol Campus]]'s main pitch.\n\nDuring the 2012\u201313 season, Benfica B played home matches at the [[Est\u00e1dio da Luz]] until February, when they moved to [[Est\u00e1dio da Tapadinha]] to prevent excessive wear of the stadium's grass.<ref>{{cite web|title=Benfica B muda-se para a Tapadinha|url=https://maisfutebol.iol.pt/superliga-geral/benfica-tapadinha-atletico-portimonense-ii-liga-maisfutebol/1424267-1676.html|website=Maisfutebol}}</ref> In [[2013\u201314 Segunda Liga|2013\u201314]], they moved permanently to their own training ground, capable of receiving professional league matches.\n\nAs a reserve team, Benfica B cannot play in the same division as the club's main team, thus being ineligible for promotion to the [[Primeira Liga]]. Moreover, they cannot enter domestic cup competitions such as the [[Ta\u00e7a de Portugal]] and [[Ta\u00e7a da Liga]].\n\n==History==\nAs [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] sought a way to provide playing time for their youth and reserve players, they created a B team in 1999. The team officially started competing in the 1999\u20132000 season, with their first match played away against [[Portimonense S.C.]] (2\u20132) in late August.<ref>\"Despertador encarnado tocou tarde\" ''[[A Bola]]'', 30 August 1999 {{in lang|pt}}</ref> After three seasons in the [[Portuguese Second Division]], they suffered relegation to the [[Portuguese Third Division]], where they would spend three years,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.zerozero.pt/edicao.php?id_edicao=1152 |title=II Divis\u00e3o S\u00e9rie D|trans-title=|website=zerozero |date=9 June 2012 |access-date=9 June 2012}}</ref> before achieving promotion to the Portuguese Second Division in 2005. In May of the following year, the board of directors extinguished the side, which returned to activity shortly after as part of the [[Liga Intercalar]]. As part of this competition, the team's best league finish was a second place, behind [[G.D. Estoril-Praia|Estoril B]], in the South Zone of the 2010\u201311 season.\n\nBefore the end of the 2011\u201312 football season in Portugal, seven [[Primeira Liga]] clubs announced their interest in creating a reserve team to fill the six vacancies available in the [[Segunda Liga]] (now LigaPro) for the [[2012\u201313 Segunda Liga|2012\u201313 campaign]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://relvado.sapo.pt/2-liga/sete-clubes-interessados-nas-seis-vagas-para-equipas-b-350876 |title=Sete clubes interessados nas seis vagas para equipas B |trans-title=Seven clubs interested for the six vacancies for B teams |website=Relvado |date=17 February 2012 |access-date=9 June 2012  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420022036/http://relvado.sapo.pt/2-liga/sete-clubes-interessados-nas-seis-vagas-para-equipas-b-350876 |archive-date=20 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Of those seven clubs, six were selected to take part in the competition: Benfica, [[S.C.

LPFP also decided that reserve teams are unable to compete in cup competitions and to gain promotion to the Primeira Liga due to the possibility of playing against their club's first team.\n\nIn late May 2012, it was officially announced that the B teams of six Primeira Liga clubs would compete in the 2012\u201313 Segunda Liga, a decision that increased the number of teams from 16 to 22 and the number of matches from 30 to 42.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://maisfutebol.iol.pt/fcporto/liga-equipas-b-liga-de-honra-porto-sporting-benfica/1351480-1304.html|title=Liga: seis clubes inscreveram a equipa \"B\"|trans-title=League: six clubs register for a B team|website=Maisfutebol|date=28 May 2012|access-date=9 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Benfica B v FCUM.jpg|thumbnail|Starting line-up of Benfica B for a friendly match against [[F.C.
