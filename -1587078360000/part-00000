In the philosophy of science, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are logical constructions that can be impossible.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> For example, the law \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" contradicts it and, even if it was impossible, it would still contradict it and make the law falsifiable.<ref name=\"blackswanimpossible\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nIt differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>{{sfn|Grayling|2019|p=397}}\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} we infer that <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> He also says (see section [[Falsifiability#Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability| Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability]]) that it's not an obstacle to the definition of an empirical basis and of falsifiability.\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==The demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.<ref name=\"neveruseinduction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice.{{sfn|Popper|1963}} In contradistinction, the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and the [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]], both hold that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true. To defend his approach against this verifiability criterion, which was at the time the accepted approach to demarcate science from non-science, Popper criticized its practical side. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the general attitude associated with verificationism originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability==\nPopper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of science and its applied methodology.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/>  The logical part consists of theories, statements and their purely logical relationship. The methodological part consists, in Popper's view, of informal rules, which we use to guess theories, accept observation statements as factual, etc.  When we apply this distinction to the term \"falsifiability\", it corresponds to a distinction between two completely different meanings of the term. The same is true for the term \"falsifiable\".  Popper says that he only uses \"falsifiability\" or \"falsifiable\" in reference to the logical side and that, when he refers to the methodological side, he speaks of falsification and of its problems instead.<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=upper-alpha/>  He is aware that we have a lot of problems in the methodological side. He even proposed methodological rules to address them. For example, one such rule is that, if one refuses to go along with falsifications, then he has retired himself from the game of science. The logical side does not have the same problem as the methodological side, in particular with regard to the falsifiability of a theory, because  basic statements are not required to be possible. The methodological rules are only needed when we consider actual falsifications.  He says that an entire literature exists because this distinction was not understood.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  \n\n===Basic statements===\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  They are the statements that can be used to show the falsifiability of a theory. Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  \n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if we accept that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nPopper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is clearly impossible, yet a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because we can measure the position of the apple at different times. In contrast, \"this man is immortal\" is not a basic statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Indeed, \"All men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement. Yet another example is \"this angel has large wings\". It is not a basic statement, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify angels.\n\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 13-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes to define laws. For example, in the law \"all swans are white\" the concept of swans is a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist, existed or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\n\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> This agreement, if we can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. This is where the distinction between the logical and methodological sides of science becomes important. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in details and, as mentioned in section [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| Away from dogmatic falsificationism]],  an actual agreement is needed.  This may require that we use a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples). \n\nDespite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to a solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which, Popper says, the whole logical process of science as we know it would not be possible.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see section [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism |Away from_naive falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v. Arkansas|1982|loc=at the end of section IV. (C)}}}}\n\n==== ''Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals'' case ====\nIn the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

However, when these predictions were not in fact borne out, the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses which made it compatible with the facts. By this means, Popper asserted, a theory which was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudo-scientific dogma.\"}}\n\nSome economists, such as those of the [[Austrian School]], believe that [[macroeconomics]] is [[Empiricism|empirically]] unfalsifiable and that thus the only appropriate means to understand economic events is by [[deductive reasoning|logically]] studying [[Subjective theory of value|the intentions]] of [[methodological individualism|individual economic decision-makers]], [[Praxeology#Austrian School approach|based on]] certain fundamental [[Action axiom|truths]].{{sfn|Heath|2015}}{{sfn|Mises|1998|p=11}} Prominent figures within the Austrian School of economics, [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] were associates of Karl Popper, with whom they co-founded the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].\n\n===Evolution===\n{{Main|Objections to evolution#Unfalsifiability|l1=Objections to evolution: Unfalsifiability}}\nNumerous examples of potential (indirect) ways to falsify common descent have been proposed by its proponents. [[J.B.S. Haldane]], when asked what hypothetical evidence could disprove evolution, replied \"[[precambrian rabbit|fossil rabbits in the Precambrian era]]\".{{sfn|Ridley|2003}} [[Richard Dawkins]] adds that any other modern animal, such as a hippo, would suffice.{{sfn|Wallis|2005}}{{sfn|Dawkins|1995}}{{sfn|Dawkins|1986}} [[Karl Popper]] at first spoke against the testability of natural selection{{sfn|Popper|1982b}}{{sfn|Popper|1976}} but recanted, \"I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection, and I am glad to have the opportunity to make a recantation.\"{{sfn|Popper|1978}}\n\n===Young-earth creationism===\n{{Main|Omphalos hypothesis}}\nMuch of the criticism against [[young-Earth creationism]] is based on evidence in nature that the Earth is much older than adherents believe.  Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''.

Thus a few stray basic statements contradicting a theory will hardly induce us to reject it as falsified. We shall take it as falsified only if we discover a reproducible effect which refutes the theory.

In the philosophy of science, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are logical constructions that can be impossible.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> For example, the law \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" contradicts it and, even if it was impossible<ref name=\"blackswanimpossible\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, it would still contradict it and make the law falsifiable.\n\nFalsifiability was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nIt differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>{{sfn|Grayling|2019|p=397}}\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} we infer that <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> He also says (see section [[Falsifiability#Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability| Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability]]) that it's not an obstacle to the definition of an empirical basis and of falsifiability.\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==The demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.<ref name=\"neveruseinduction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice.{{sfn|Popper|1963}} In contradistinction, the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and the [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]], both hold that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true. To defend his approach against this verifiability criterion, which was at the time the accepted approach to demarcate science from non-science, Popper criticized its practical side. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the general attitude associated with verificationism originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability==\nPopper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of science and its applied methodology.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/>  The logical part consists of theories, statements and their purely logical relationship. The methodological part consists, in Popper's view, of informal rules, which we use to guess theories, accept observation statements as factual, etc.  When we apply this distinction to the term \"falsifiability\", it corresponds to a distinction between two completely different meanings of the term. The same is true for the term \"falsifiable\".  Popper says that he only uses \"falsifiability\" or \"falsifiable\" in reference to the logical side and that, when he refers to the methodological side, he speaks of falsification and of its problems instead.<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=upper-alpha/>  He is aware that we have a lot of problems in the methodological side. He even proposed methodological rules to address them. For example, one such rule is that, if one refuses to go along with falsifications, then he has retired himself from the game of science. The logical side does not have the same problem as the methodological side, in particular with regard to the falsifiability of a theory, because  basic statements are not required to be possible. The methodological rules are only needed when we consider actual falsifications.  He says that an entire literature exists because this distinction was not understood.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  \n\n===Basic statements===\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  They are the statements that can be used to show the falsifiability of a theory. Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  \n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if we accept that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nPopper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is clearly impossible, yet a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because we can measure the position of the apple at different times. In contrast, \"this man is immortal\" is not a basic statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Indeed, \"All men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement. Yet another example is \"this angel has large wings\". It is not a basic statement, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify angels.\n\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 13-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes to define laws. For example, in the law \"all swans are white\" the concept of swans is a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist, existed or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\n\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> This agreement, if we can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. This is where the distinction between the logical and methodological sides of science becomes important. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in details and, as mentioned in section [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| Away from dogmatic falsificationism]],  an actual agreement is needed.  This may require that we use a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples). \n\nDespite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to a solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which, Popper says, the whole logical process of science as we know it would not be possible.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see section [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism |Away from_naive falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v. Arkansas|1982|loc=at the end of section IV. (C)}}}}\n\n==== ''Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals'' case ====\nIn the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims.

This is repeated in the [[Books of Chronicles|First Book of Chronicles]] 1:10, and the \"Land of Nimrod\" used as a synonym for Assyria or Mesopotamia, is mentioned in the [[Book of Micah]] 5:6:\n\n{{quote|And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the'' land of Nimrod ''in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.}}\n\nGenesis says that the \"beginning of his kingdom\" (''reshit mamlakhto'') were the towns of \"[[Babylon|Babel]], [[Erech]], [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]] and [[Calneh]] in the land of [[Shinar]]\" ([[Mesopotamia]]) (Gen 10:10)\u2014understood variously to imply that he either founded these cities, ruled over them, or both. Owing to an ambiguity in the original [[Hebrew]] text, it is unclear whether it is he or [[Ashur]] who additionally built [[Nineveh]], [[Resen (Genesis)|Resen]], [[Rehoboth-Ir]] and [[Calah]] (both interpretations are reflected in various [[English language|English]] versions). [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] devoted several pages in his ''History of the World'' (c. 1616) to reciting past scholarship regarding the question of whether it had been Nimrod or Ashur who built the cities in Assyria.<ref>{{cite book |last = Raleigh |first = Walter |title = History of the World |pages = 358\u2013365 }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Traditions and legends==\n\nIn [[Hebrew Bible stories|Hebrew]] and [[Christian tradition]], Nimrod is considered the leader of those who built the Tower of Babel in the land of [[Shinar]],<ref>{{cite magazine |last = Menner |first = Robert J. |year = 1938 |title = Nimrod and the Wolf in the Old English 'Solomon and Saturn' |magazine = [[Journal of English and Germanic Philology]] |volume = 37 |issue = 3 |pages = 332\u201384 |jstor = 27704407 }}</ref> though the Bible never actually states this.

Several of these early Judaic sources also assert that the king [[Amraphel]], who wars with Abraham later in Genesis, is none other than Nimrod himself.\n\nSince Accad (Babylonian [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]) was destroyed and lost with the destruction of its Empire in the period 2200\u20132154 BCE ([[long chronology]]), the stories mentioning Nimrod seem to recall the late [[Early Bronze Age]]. The association with Erech (Babylonian [[Uruk]]), a city that lost its prime importance around 2,000 BCE as a result of struggles between [[Isin]], [[Larsa]] and [[Elam]], also attests the early provenance of the stories of Nimrod. According to some modern-day theorists, their placement in the Bible suggests a Babylonian origin\u2014possibly inserted during the [[Babylonian captivity]].<ref name=vans />\n\nJudaic interpreters as early as [[Philo]] and [[Yochanan ben Zakai]] (1st century AD) interpreted \"a mighty hunter ''before'' the Lord\" (Heb.: \u05d2\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e6\u05d9\u05d3 \u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4, ''\u1e21ibb\u014dr-\u1e63ayi\u1e0f lip\u0304n\u00ea Yahweh'', lit. \"in the face of [[Yahweh]]\") as signifying \"''in opposition to'' the Lord\"; a similar interpretation is found in [[Pseudo-Philo]], as well as later in [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]]. Some rabbinic commentators have also connected the name ''Nimrod'' with a Hebrew word meaning 'rebel'. In Pseudo-Philo (dated c. AD 70), Nimrod is made leader of the Hamites, while [[Joktan]] as leader of the Semites, and Fenech as leader of the Japhethites, are also associated with the building of the Tower.<ref>{{cite book |first = James |last = Kugel |title = Traditions of the Bible |year = 1998 |page = 230 }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}</ref> Versions of this story are again picked up in later works such as ''[[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius]]'' (7th century AD).\n\nThe [[Book of Jubilees]] mentions the name of \"Nebrod\" (the Greek form of Nimrod) only as being the father of [[Azurad]], the wife of [[Eber]] and mother of [[Peleg]] (8:7). This account would thus make Nimrod an ancestor of Abraham, and hence of all Hebrews.\n\n[[File:Danziger, Itzhak, Nimrod, 1939.jpg|thumb|''Nimrod'' by [[Yitzhak Danziger]]]]\nJosephus wrote:\n{{quote|Now it was Nimrod who excited them to such an affront and contempt of God. He was the grandson of Ham, the son of Noah, a bold man, and of great strength of hand. He persuaded them not to ascribe it to God, as if it were through his means they were happy, but to believe that it was their own courage which procured that happiness. He also gradually changed the government into tyranny, seeing no other way of turning men from the fear of God, but to bring them into a constant dependence on his power. He also said he would be revenged on God, if he should have a mind to drown the world again; for that he would build a tower too high for the waters to reach. And that he would avenge himself on God for destroying their forefathers.\n\nNow the multitude were very ready to follow the determination of Nimrod, and to esteem it a piece of cowardice to submit to God; and they built a tower, neither sparing any pains, nor being in any degree negligent about the work: and, by reason of the multitude of hands employed in it, it grew very high, sooner than any one could expect; but the thickness of it was so great, and it was so strongly built, that thereby its great height seemed, upon the view, to be less than it really was. It was built of burnt brick, cemented together with mortar, made of bitumen, that it might not be liable to admit water. When God saw that they acted so madly, he did not resolve to destroy them utterly, since they were not grown wiser by the destruction of the former sinners; but he caused a tumult among them, by producing in them diverse languages, and causing that, through the multitude of those languages, they should not be able to understand one another. The place wherein they built the tower is now called Babylon, because of the confusion of that language which they readily understood before; for the Hebrews mean by the word Babel, confusion ...}}\n\nAn early [[Arabic]] work known as ''Kitab al-Magall'' or the ''Book of Rolls'' (part of [[Clementine literature]]) states that Nimrod built the towns of Had\u0101ni\u016bn, [[Ellasar]], [[Seleucia]], [[Ctesiphon]], R\u016bh\u012bn, [[Atrapatene]], Telal\u0101n, and others, that he began his reign as king over earth when [[Reu]] was 163, and that he reigned for 69 years, building [[Nisibis]], Raha ([[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]) and [[Harran]] when [[Peleg]] was 50. It further adds that Nimrod \"saw in the sky a piece of black cloth and a crown\". He called upon Sasan the weaver and commanded him to make him a crown like it, which he set jewels on and wore. He was allegedly the first king to wear a crown. \"For this reason people who knew nothing about it, said that a crown came down to him from [[heaven]].\" Later, the book describes how Nimrod established fire worship and idolatry, then received instruction in divination for three years from Bouniter, the [[fourth son of Noah]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/aa/aa2.htm |title = the ''Kitab al-Magall'' |publisher = Sacred-texts.com |accessdate = 5 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn the ''Recognitions'' (R 4.29), one version of the Clementines, Nimrod is equated with the legendary Assyrian king [[Ninus]], who first appears in the [[Greek people|Greek]] historian [[Ctesias]] as the founder of Nineveh. However, in another version, the ''Homilies'' (H 9:4\u20136), Nimrod is made to be the same as [[Zoroaster]].\n\nThe [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''[[Cave of Treasures]]'' (c. 350) contains an account of Nimrod very similar to that in the ''Kitab al-Magall'', except that Nisibis, Edessa and Harran are said to be built by Nimrod when Reu was 50, and that he began his reign as the first king when Reu was 130. In this version, the weaver is called ''Sisan'', and the fourth son of Noah is called ''Yonton''.\n\n[[Jerome]], writing c. 390, explains in ''Hebrew Questions on Genesis'' that after Nimrod reigned in Babel, \"he also reigned in Arach [Erech], that is, in Edissa; and in Achad [Accad], which is now called Nisibis; and in Chalanne [Calneh], which was later called Seleucia after King Seleucus when its name had been changed, and which is now in actual fact called Ctesiphon.\" However, this traditional identification of the cities built by Nimrod in Genesis is no longer accepted by modern scholars, who consider them to be located in [[Sumer]], not [[Syria]].\n\nThe [[Ge'ez]] ''[[Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan]]'' (c. 5th century) also contains a version similar to that in the ''Cave of Treasures'', but the crown maker is called ''Santal'', and the name of Noah's fourth son who instructs Nimrod is ''Barvin''.\n\nHowever, [[Ephrem the Syrian]] (306\u2013373) relates a contradictory view, that Nimrod was righteous and opposed the builders of the Tower. Similarly, ''[[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan]]'' (date uncertain) mentions a Jewish tradition that Nimrod left Shinar in southern Mesopotamia and fled to Assyria in northern Mesopotamia, because he refused to take part in building the Tower\u2014for which God rewarded him with the four cities in Assyria, to substitute for the ones in Babel.\n\n''[[Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer]]'' (c. 833) relates the Jewish traditions that Nimrod inherited the garments of Adam and Eve from his father Cush, and that these made him invincible. Nimrod's party then defeated the Japhethites to assume universal rulership. Later, [[Esau]] (grandson of [[Abraham]]), ambushed, beheaded, and robbed Nimrod. These stories later reappear in other sources including the 16th century ''[[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer haYashar]]'', which adds that Nimrod had a son named ''Mardon'' who was even more wicked.<ref>See Louis Ginsberg ''Legends of the Jews'' Vol I, and the footnotes volume.</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings (book)|History of the Prophets and Kings]]'' by the 9th century [[Muslim]] historian [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], Nimrod has the tower built in Babil, [[Allah]] destroys it, and the language of mankind, formerly [[Syriac language|Syriac]], is then confused into 72 languages. Another Muslim historian of the 13th century, [[Abu al-Fida]], relates the same story, adding that the patriarch [[Eber]] (an ancestor of Abraham) was allowed to keep the original tongue, Hebrew in this case, because he would not partake in the building. The 10th-century Muslim historian [[Masudi]] recounts a legend making the Nimrod who built the tower to be the son of Mash, the son of [[Aram, son of Shem]], adding that he reigned 500 years over the [[Nabateans]]. Later, Masudi lists Nimrod as the first king of Babylon, and states that he dug great canals and reigned 60 years. Still elsewhere, he mentions another king Nimrod, son of [[Canaan (biblical figure)|Canaan]], as the one who introduced astrology and attempted to kill Abraham.\n\nIn [[Armenia]]n legend, the ancestor of the Armenian people, [[Hayk]], defeated Nimrod (sometimes equated with [[Bel (god)|Bel]]) in a battle near Lake Van.\n\nIn the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] legend of the Enchanted Stag (more commonly known as the [[Csodaszarvas|White Stag]] [''Feh\u00e9r Szarvas''] or Silver Stag), King Nimr\u00f3d (''M\u00e9nr\u00f3t'', often described as \"Nimr\u00f3d the Giant\" or \"the giant Nimr\u00f3d\", descendant of one of Noah's \"most wicked\" sons, Kam (references abound in traditions, legends, several religions and historical sources to persons and nations bearing the name of Kam or K\u00e1m, and overwhelmingly, the connotations are negative), is the first person referred to as forefather of the Hungarians. He, along with his entire nation, is also the giant responsible for the building of the Tower of Babel\u2014construction of which was supposedly started by him 201 years after the event of the Great Flood (see biblical story of [[Noah's Ark]]). After the catastrophic failure (through God's will) of that most ambitious endeavour and in the midst of the ensuing linguistic cacophony, Nimr\u00f3d the giant moved to the land of ''Evil\u00e1t'', where his wife, ''En\u00e9h'' gave birth to twin brothers ''Hunor'' and ''Magyar'' (aka ''Magor''). Father and sons were, all three of them, prodigious hunters, but Nimr\u00f3d especially is the archetypal, consummate, legendary hunter and archer.\n\nBoth the Huns' and Magyars' historically attested skill with the recurve bow and arrow are attributed to Nimr\u00f3d. ([[Simon of K\u00e9za|Simon K\u00e9zai]], personal \"court priest\" of King [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary|Ladislaus the Cuman]], in his ''Gesta Hungarorum'', 1282\u20131285. This tradition can also be found in over twenty other medieval Hungarian chronicles, as well as a German one, according to Dr Antal Endrey in an article published in 1979<!--http://arpad.org/pages.php?&menuid=21-->). Hungarian legends held that twin sons of King Nimr\u00f3d, [[Hunor and Magor]] were the ancestors of the [[Huns]] and the [[Magyars]] (Hungarians) respectively, siring their children through the two daughters of King Dul of the [[Alans]], whom they kidnapped after losing track of the silver stag whilst hunting.<ref>''Simon of K\u00e9za: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 1.4\u20135), pp. 13\u201317.</ref> The 16th-century Hungarian prelate [[Nicolaus Olahus]] claimed that [[Attila]] took for himself the title of ''Descendant of the Great Nimrod''.<ref>{{cite web |last1 = Herbert |first1 = William |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XJ44AAAAMAAJ&dq=nicolas+olaus+attila+engaddi&pg=PA49&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=nicolas%20olaus%20attila%20engaddi&f=false | title = Attila, King of the Huns |website = Google Books | accessdate = 12 September 2019 |page = 49 }}</ref>\n\nNimrod figures in some very early versions of the history of [[Freemasonry]], where he was said to have been one of the fraternity's founders. According to the Encyclopedia of Freemasonry: The legend of the Craft in the Old Constitutions refers to Nimrod as one of the founders of Masonry. Thus in the York MS., No. 1, we read: \"At ye making of ye toure of Babell there was a Masonrie first much esteemed of, and the King of Babilon yt called Nimrod was a Mason himself and loved well Masons.\" However, he does not figure in the current rituals.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe demon [[Nyyrikki]], figuring in the Finnish ''[[Kalevala]]'' as a helper of [[Lemmink\u00e4inen]], is associated with Nimrod by some researchers and linguists.<ref>''Kalevala''.

[[Abraham]] cast into fire by Nimrod. From ''Zubdat-al Tawarikh'', a 1583 [[Ottoman Turkish]] manuscript.]]\nA confrontation between Nimrod and [[Abraham]] is said to have taken place, according to several Jewish and Islamic traditions. Some stories bring them both together in a cataclysmic collision, seen as a symbol of the confrontation between Good and Evil, and/or as a symbol of [[monotheism]] against [[polytheism]]. On the other hand, some Jewish traditions say only that the two men met and had a discussion.{{ref}}\n\nAccording to K. van der Toorn and P. W. van der Horst, this tradition is first attested in the writings of [[Pseudo-Philo]].<ref>{{harvp|Van der Toorn|Van der Horst|1990|p= 19|ps=.}}</ref> The story is also found in the [[Talmud]], and in rabbinical writings in the [[Middle Ages]].<ref>{{Daat enc|he-title=\u05e0\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05d3|id1=1058}}</ref>\n\nIn some versions (as in [[Flavius Josephus]]), Nimrod is a man who sets his will against that of God. In others, he proclaims himself a god and is worshipped as such by his subjects, sometimes with his consort [[Semiramis]] worshipped as a goddess at his side. (See also [[Ninus]].)\n\nA portent in the stars tells Nimrod and his astrologers of the impending birth of Abraham, who would put an end to [[idolatry]]. Nimrod therefore orders the killing of all newborn babies. However, Abraham's mother escapes into the fields and gives birth secretly. At a young age, Abraham recognizes God and starts worshipping Him. He confronts Nimrod and tells him face-to-face to [[Abraham and the Idol Shop|cease his idolatry]], whereupon Nimrod orders him burned at the stake. In some versions, Nimrod has his subjects gather wood for four whole years, so as to burn Abraham in the biggest bonfire the world had ever seen. Yet when the fire is lit, Abraham walks out unscathed.\n\nIn some versions, Nimrod then challenges Abraham to battle. When Nimrod appears at the head of enormous armies, Abraham produces an army of [[gnat]]s which destroys Nimrod's army. Some accounts have a gnat or mosquito enter Nimrod's brain and drive him out of his mind (a divine retribution which Jewish tradition also assigned to the Roman Emperor [[Titus]], destroyer of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]).\n\nIn some versions, Nimrod repents and accepts God, offering numerous sacrifices that God rejects (as with [[Cain]]). Other versions have Nimrod give to Abraham, as a conciliatory gift, the giant slave [[Eliezer]], whom some accounts describe as Nimrod's own son. (The Bible also mentions Eliezer as Abraham's majordomo, though not making any connection between him and Nimrod.)\n\nStill other versions have Nimrod persisting in his rebellion against God, or resuming it. Indeed, Abraham's crucial act of leaving [[Mesopotamia]] and settling in [[Canaan]] is sometimes interpreted as an escape from Nimrod's revenge. Accounts considered canonical place the building of the Tower many generations before Abraham's birth (as in the Bible, also ''[[Jubilees]]''); however in others, it is a later rebellion after Nimrod failed in his confrontation with Abraham. In still other versions, Nimrod does not give up after the Tower fails, but goes on to try storming Heaven in person, in a chariot driven by birds.\n\nThe story attributes to Abraham elements from the story of [[Moses]]' birth (the cruel king killing innocent babies, with the midwives ordered to kill them) and from the careers of [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]] who emerged unscathed from the fire. Nimrod is thus given attributes of two archetypal cruel and persecuting kings \u2013 [[Nebuchadnezzar]] and [[Pharaoh of the Exodus|Pharaoh]]. Some Jewish traditions also identified him with [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], whose birth according to [[Herodotus]] was accompanied by portents, which made his grandfather try to kill him.\n\nA confrontation is also found in the [[Quran]], between a king, not mentioned by name, and the Prophet [[Abraham|Ibrahim]] (Arabic for \"Abraham\"). Some Muslim commentators assign Nimrod as the king. In the quranic narrative Ibrahim has a discussion with the king, the former argues that Allah (God) is the one who gives life and causes death, whereas the unnamed King replies that he gives life and causes death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=2&verse=258|title=Quran 2:258}}</ref> Ibrahim refutes him by stating that Allah brings the Sun up from the East, and so he asks the king to bring it from the West. The king is then perplexed and angered. The commentaries on this [[Surah]] offer a wide variety of embellishments of this narrative, one of which by [[Ibn Kathir]], a 14th-century scholar, adding that Nimrod showed his rule over life and death by killing a prisoner and freeing another.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://quranx.com/tafsirs/2.258|title=Tafsir Surah 2:258, ibn Kathir}}</ref>\n\nWhether or not conceived as having ultimately repented, Nimrod remained in Jewish and Islamic tradition an emblematic evil person, an archetype of an idolater and a tyrannical king. In rabbinical writings up to the present, he is almost invariably referred to as \"Nimrod the Evil\" ({{lang-he|\u05e0\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\u05e2}}).\n\nNimrod is mentioned by name in several places in the Baha'i scriptures, including the [[Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n]], the primary theological work of the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed religion]]. There it is said that Nimrod \"dreamed a dream\" which his soothsayers interpreted as signifying the birth of a new star in heaven. A herald is then said to have appeared in the land announcing \"the coming of Abraham\".<ref>[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KI/ki-2.html \"The Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n\"] ''Baha'i Reference Library''. pp 41\u201380. Retrieved 10 September 2014.</ref> Nimrod is also mentioned in one of the earliest writings of the [[B\u00e1b]] (the herald of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith).

A notable example is \"''[[Quando el Rey Nimrod]]''\" (\"When King Nimrod\"), one of the most well-known folksongs in [[Ladino language|Ladino]] (the Judeo-Spanish language), apparently written during the reign of King [[Alfonso X]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]. Beginning with the words: \"When King Nimrod went out to the fields/ Looked at the heavens and at the stars/He saw a holy light in the Jewish quarter/A sign that Abraham, our father, was about to be born\", the song gives a poetic account of the persecutions perpetrated by the cruel Nimrod and the miraculous birth and deeds of the savior Abraham.

This is repeated in the [[Books of Chronicles|First Book of Chronicles]] 1:10, and the \"Land of Nimrod\" used as a synonym for Assyria or Mesopotamia, is mentioned in the [[Book of Micah]] 5:6:\n\n{{quote|And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the'' land of Nimrod ''in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.}}\n\nGenesis says that the \"beginning of his kingdom\" (''reshit mamlakhto'') were the towns of \"[[Babylon|Babel]], [[Erech]], [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]] and [[Calneh]] in the land of [[Shinar]]\" ([[Mesopotamia]]) (Gen 10:10)\u2014understood variously to imply that he either founded these cities, ruled over them, or both.

Several of these early Judaic sources also assert that the king [[Amraphel]], who wars with Abraham later in Genesis, is none other than Nimrod himself.\n\nSince Accad (Babylonian [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]) was destroyed and lost with the destruction of its Empire in the period 2200\u20132154 BCE ([[long chronology]]), the stories mentioning Nimrod seem to recall the late [[Early Bronze Age]]. The association with Erech (Babylonian [[Uruk]]), a city that lost its prime importance around 2,000 BCE as a result of struggles between [[Isin]], [[Larsa]] and [[Elam]], also attests the early provenance of the stories of Nimrod. According to some modern-day theorists, their placement in the Bible suggests a Babylonian origin\u2014possibly inserted during the [[Babylonian captivity]].<ref name=vans />\n\nJudaic interpreters as early as [[Philo]] and [[Yochanan ben Zakai]] (1st century AD) interpreted \"a mighty hunter ''before'' the Lord\" (Heb.: \u05d2\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e6\u05d9\u05d3 \u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4, ''\u1e21ibb\u014dr-\u1e63ayi\u1e0f lip\u0304n\u00ea Yahweh'', lit. \"in the face of [[Yahweh]]\") as signifying \"''in opposition to'' the Lord\"; a similar interpretation is found in [[Pseudo-Philo]], as well as later in [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]]. Some rabbinic commentators have also connected the name ''Nimrod'' with a Hebrew word meaning 'rebel'. In Pseudo-Philo (dated c. AD 70), Nimrod is made leader of the Hamites, while [[Joktan]] as leader of the Semites, and Fenech as leader of the Japhethites, are also associated with the building of the Tower.<ref>{{cite book |first = James |last = Kugel |title = Traditions of the Bible |year = 1998 |page = 230 }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}</ref> Versions of this story are again picked up in later works such as ''[[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius]]'' (7th century AD).\n\nThe [[Book of Jubilees]] mentions the name of \"Nebrod\" (the Greek form of Nimrod) only as being the father of [[Azurad]], the wife of [[Eber]] and mother of [[Peleg]] (8:7). This account would thus make Nimrod an ancestor of Abraham, and hence of all Hebrews.\n\n[[File:Danziger, Itzhak, Nimrod, 1939.jpg|thumb|''Nimrod'' by [[Yitzhak Danziger]]]]\nJosephus wrote:\n{{quote|Now it was Nimrod who excited them to such an affront and contempt of God. He was the grandson of Ham, the son of Noah, a bold man, and of great strength of hand. He persuaded them not to ascribe it to God, as if it were through his means they were happy, but to believe that it was their own courage which procured that happiness. He also gradually changed the government into tyranny, seeing no other way of turning men from the fear of God, but to bring them into a constant dependence on his power. He also said he would be revenged on God, if he should have a mind to drown the world again; for that he would build a tower too high for the waters to reach. And that he would avenge himself on God for destroying their forefathers.\n\nNow the multitude were very ready to follow the determination of Nimrod, and to esteem it a piece of cowardice to submit to God; and they built a tower, neither sparing any pains, nor being in any degree negligent about the work: and, by reason of the multitude of hands employed in it, it grew very high, sooner than any one could expect; but the thickness of it was so great, and it was so strongly built, that thereby its great height seemed, upon the view, to be less than it really was. It was built of burnt brick, cemented together with mortar, made of bitumen, that it might not be liable to admit water. When God saw that they acted so madly, he did not resolve to destroy them utterly, since they were not grown wiser by the destruction of the former sinners; but he caused a tumult among them, by producing in them diverse languages, and causing that, through the multitude of those languages, they should not be able to understand one another. The place wherein they built the tower is now called Babylon, because of the confusion of that language which they readily understood before; for the Hebrews mean by the word Babel, confusion ...}}\n\nAn early [[Arabic]] work known as ''Kitab al-Magall'' or the ''Book of Rolls'' (part of [[Clementine literature]]) states that Nimrod built the towns of Had\u0101ni\u016bn, [[Ellasar]], [[Seleucia]], [[Ctesiphon]], R\u016bh\u012bn, [[Atrapatene]], Telal\u0101n, and others, that he began his reign as king over earth when [[Reu]] was 163, and that he reigned for 69 years, building [[Nisibis]], Raha ([[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]) and [[Harran]] when [[Peleg]] was 50. It further adds that Nimrod \"saw in the sky a piece of black cloth and a crown\". He called upon Sasan the weaver and commanded him to make him a crown like it, which he set jewels on and wore. He was allegedly the first king to wear a crown. \"For this reason people who knew nothing about it, said that a crown came down to him from [[heaven]].\" Later, the book describes how Nimrod established fire worship and idolatry, then received instruction in divination for three years from Bouniter, the [[fourth son of Noah]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/aa/aa2.htm |title = the ''Kitab al-Magall'' |publisher = Sacred-texts.com |accessdate = 5 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn the ''Recognitions'' (R 4.29), one version of the Clementines, Nimrod is equated with the legendary Assyrian king [[Ninus]], who first appears in the [[Greek people|Greek]] historian [[Ctesias]] as the founder of Nineveh. However, in another version, the ''Homilies'' (H 9:4\u20136), Nimrod is made to be the same as [[Zoroaster]].\n\nThe [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''[[Cave of Treasures]]'' (c. 350) contains an account of Nimrod very similar to that in the ''Kitab al-Magall'', except that Nisibis, Edessa and Harran are said to be built by Nimrod when Reu was 50, and that he began his reign as the first king when Reu was 130. In this version, the weaver is called ''Sisan'', and the fourth son of Noah is called ''Yonton''.\n\n[[Jerome]], writing c. 390, explains in ''Hebrew Questions on Genesis'' that after Nimrod reigned in Babel, \"he also reigned in Arach [Erech], that is, in Edissa; and in Achad [Accad], which is now called Nisibis; and in Chalanne [Calneh], which was later called Seleucia after King Seleucus when its name had been changed, and which is now in actual fact called Ctesiphon.\" However, this traditional identification of the cities built by Nimrod in Genesis is no longer accepted by modern scholars, who consider them to be located in [[Sumer]], not [[Syria]].\n\nThe [[Ge'ez]] ''[[Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan]]'' (c. 5th century) also contains a version similar to that in the ''Cave of Treasures'', but the crown maker is called ''Santal'', and the name of Noah's fourth son who instructs Nimrod is ''Barvin''.\n\nHowever, [[Ephrem the Syrian]] (306\u2013373) relates a contradictory view, that Nimrod was righteous and opposed the builders of the Tower. Similarly, ''[[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan]]'' (date uncertain) mentions a Jewish tradition that Nimrod left Shinar in southern Mesopotamia and fled to Assyria in northern Mesopotamia, because he refused to take part in building the Tower\u2014for which God rewarded him with the four cities in Assyria, to substitute for the ones in Babel.\n\n''[[Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer]]'' (c. 833) relates the Jewish traditions that Nimrod inherited the garments of Adam and Eve from his father Cush, and that these made him invincible. Nimrod's party then defeated the Japhethites to assume universal rulership. Later, [[Esau]] (grandson of [[Abraham]]), ambushed, beheaded, and robbed Nimrod. These stories later reappear in other sources including the 16th century ''[[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer haYashar]]'', which adds that Nimrod had a son named ''Mardon'' who was even more wicked.<ref>See Louis Ginsberg ''Legends of the Jews'' Vol I, and the footnotes volume.</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings (book)|History of the Prophets and Kings]]'' by the 9th century [[Muslim]] historian [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], Nimrod has the tower built in Babil, [[Allah]] destroys it, and the language of mankind, formerly [[Syriac language|Syriac]], is then confused into 72 languages. Another Muslim historian of the 13th century, [[Abu al-Fida]], relates the same story, adding that the patriarch [[Eber]] (an ancestor of Abraham) was allowed to keep the original tongue, Hebrew in this case, because he would not partake in the building. The 10th-century Muslim historian [[Masudi]] recounts a legend making the Nimrod who built the tower to be the son of Mash, the son of [[Aram, son of Shem]], adding that he reigned 500 years over the [[Nabateans]]. Later, Masudi lists Nimrod as the first king of Babylon, and states that he dug great canals and reigned 60 years. Still elsewhere, he mentions another king Nimrod, son of [[Canaan (biblical figure)|Canaan]], as the one who introduced astrology and attempted to kill Abraham.\n\nIn [[Armenia]]n legend, the ancestor of the Armenian people, [[Hayk]], defeated Nimrod (sometimes equated with [[Bel (god)|Bel]]) in a battle near Lake Van.\n\nIn the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] legend of the Enchanted Stag (more commonly known as the [[Csodaszarvas|White Stag]] [''Feh\u00e9r Szarvas''] or Silver Stag), King Nimr\u00f3d (''M\u00e9nr\u00f3t'', often described as \"Nimr\u00f3d the Giant\" or \"the giant Nimr\u00f3d\", descendant of one of Noah's \"most wicked\" sons, Kam (references abound in traditions, legends, several religions and historical sources to persons and nations bearing the name of Kam or K\u00e1m, and overwhelmingly, the connotations are negative), is the first person referred to as forefather of the Hungarians. He, along with his entire nation, is also the giant responsible for the building of the Tower of Babel\u2014construction of which was supposedly started by him 201 years after the event of the Great Flood (see biblical story of [[Noah's Ark]]). After the catastrophic failure (through God's will) of that most ambitious endeavour and in the midst of the ensuing linguistic cacophony, Nimr\u00f3d the giant moved to the land of ''Evil\u00e1t'', where his wife, ''En\u00e9h'' gave birth to twin brothers ''Hunor'' and ''Magyar'' (aka ''Magor''). Father and sons were, all three of them, prodigious hunters, but Nimr\u00f3d especially is the archetypal, consummate, legendary hunter and archer.\n\nBoth the Huns' and Magyars' historically attested skill with the recurve bow and arrow are attributed to Nimr\u00f3d. ([[Simon of K\u00e9za|Simon K\u00e9zai]], personal \"court priest\" of King [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary|Ladislaus the Cuman]], in his ''Gesta Hungarorum'', 1282\u20131285. This tradition can also be found in over twenty other medieval Hungarian chronicles, as well as a German one, according to Dr Antal Endrey in an article published in 1979<!--http://arpad.org/pages.php?&menuid=21-->). Hungarian legends held that twin sons of King Nimr\u00f3d, [[Hunor and Magor]] were the ancestors of the [[Huns]] and the [[Magyars]] (Hungarians) respectively, siring their children through the two daughters of King Dul of the [[Alans]], whom they kidnapped after losing track of the silver stag whilst hunting.<ref>''Simon of K\u00e9za: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 1.4\u20135), pp. 13\u201317.</ref> The 16th-century Hungarian prelate [[Nicolaus Olahus]] claimed that [[Attila]] took for himself the title of ''Descendant of the Great Nimrod''.<ref>{{cite web |last1 = Herbert |first1 = William |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XJ44AAAAMAAJ&dq=nicolas+olaus+attila+engaddi&pg=PA49&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=nicolas%20olaus%20attila%20engaddi&f=false | title = Attila, King of the Huns |website = Google Books | accessdate = 12 September 2019 |page = 49 }}</ref>\n\nNimrod figures in some very early versions of the history of [[Freemasonry]], where he was said to have been one of the fraternity's founders.

Nimrod therefore orders the killing of all newborn babies. However, Abraham's mother escapes into the fields and gives birth secretly. At a young age, Abraham recognizes God and starts worshipping Him. He confronts Nimrod and tells him face-to-face to [[Abraham and the Idol Shop|cease his idolatry]], whereupon Nimrod orders him burned at the stake. In some versions, Nimrod has his subjects gather wood for four whole years, so as to burn Abraham in the biggest bonfire the world had ever seen. Yet when the fire is lit, Abraham walks out unscathed.\n\nIn some versions, Nimrod then challenges Abraham to battle. When Nimrod appears at the head of enormous armies, Abraham produces an army of [[gnat]]s which destroys Nimrod's army. Some accounts have a gnat or mosquito enter Nimrod's brain and drive him out of his mind (a divine retribution which Jewish tradition also assigned to the Roman Emperor [[Titus]], destroyer of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]).\n\nIn some versions, Nimrod repents and accepts God, offering numerous sacrifices that God rejects (as with [[Cain]]). Other versions have Nimrod give to Abraham, as a conciliatory gift, the giant slave [[Eliezer]], whom some accounts describe as Nimrod's own son. (The Bible also mentions Eliezer as Abraham's majordomo, though not making any connection between him and Nimrod.)\n\nStill other versions have Nimrod persisting in his rebellion against God, or resuming it. Indeed, Abraham's crucial act of leaving [[Mesopotamia]] and settling in [[Canaan]] is sometimes interpreted as an escape from Nimrod's revenge. Accounts considered canonical place the building of the Tower many generations before Abraham's birth (as in the Bible, also ''[[Jubilees]]''); however in others, it is a later rebellion after Nimrod failed in his confrontation with Abraham. In still other versions, Nimrod does not give up after the Tower fails, but goes on to try storming Heaven in person, in a chariot driven by birds.\n\nThe story attributes to Abraham elements from the story of [[Moses]]' birth (the cruel king killing innocent babies, with the midwives ordered to kill them) and from the careers of [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]] who emerged unscathed from the fire. Nimrod is thus given attributes of two archetypal cruel and persecuting kings \u2013 [[Nebuchadnezzar]] and [[Pharaoh of the Exodus|Pharaoh]]. Some Jewish traditions also identified him with [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], whose birth according to [[Herodotus]] was accompanied by portents, which made his grandfather try to kill him.\n\nA confrontation is also found in the [[Quran]], between a king, not mentioned by name, and the Prophet [[Abraham|Ibrahim]] (Arabic for \"Abraham\"). Some Muslim commentators assign Nimrod as the king. In the quranic narrative Ibrahim has a discussion with the king, the former argues that Allah (God) is the one who gives life and causes death, whereas the unnamed King replies that he gives life and causes death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=2&verse=258|title=Quran 2:258}}</ref> Ibrahim refutes him by stating that Allah brings the Sun up from the East, and so he asks the king to bring it from the West. The king is then perplexed and angered. The commentaries on this [[Surah]] offer a wide variety of embellishments of this narrative, one of which by [[Ibn Kathir]], a 14th-century scholar, adding that Nimrod showed his rule over life and death by killing a prisoner and freeing another.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://quranx.com/tafsirs/2.258|title=Tafsir Surah 2:258, ibn Kathir}}</ref>\n\nWhether or not conceived as having ultimately repented, Nimrod remained in Jewish and Islamic tradition an emblematic evil person, an archetype of an idolater and a tyrannical king. In rabbinical writings up to the present, he is almost invariably referred to as \"Nimrod the Evil\" ({{lang-he|\u05e0\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\u05e2}}).\n\nNimrod is mentioned by name in several places in the Baha'i scriptures, including the [[Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n]], the primary theological work of the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed religion]]. There it is said that Nimrod \"dreamed a dream\" which his soothsayers interpreted as signifying the birth of a new star in heaven. A herald is then said to have appeared in the land announcing \"the coming of Abraham\".<ref>[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KI/ki-2.html \"The Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n\"] ''Baha'i Reference Library''. pp 41\u201380. Retrieved 10 September 2014.</ref> Nimrod is also mentioned in one of the earliest writings of the [[B\u00e1b]] (the herald of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith). Citing examples of God's power, he asks:  \"Has He not, in past days, caused Abraham, in spite of His seeming helplessness, to triumph over the forces of Nimrod?\"<ref>{{cite web |last1 = Effendi |first1 = Shoghi |title = The Dawn-Breakers |url = http://bahai-library.com/books/dawnbreakers/chapters/3.html#94 |website = bahai-library.com |publisher = Baha'i Publishing Trust |accessdate = 23 February 2016 |page = 94 }}</ref>\n\nThe story of Abraham's confrontation with Nimrod did not remain within the confines of learned writings and religious treatises, but also conspicuously influenced popular culture. A notable example is \"''[[Quando el Rey Nimrod]]''\" (\"When King Nimrod\"), one of the most well-known folksongs in [[Ladino language|Ladino]] (the Judeo-Spanish language), apparently written during the reign of King [[Alfonso X]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]. Beginning with the words: \"When King Nimrod went out to the fields/ Looked at the heavens and at the stars/He saw a holy light in the Jewish quarter/A sign that Abraham, our father, was about to be born\", the song gives a poetic account of the persecutions perpetrated by the cruel Nimrod and the miraculous birth and deeds of the savior Abraham.

{"title_page": "Constitution of Argentina", "text_new": "{{Politics of Argentina}}\nThe '''Constitution of Argentina''' is the basic governing document of [[Argentina]], and the primary source of existing [[Law of Argentina|law in Argentina]]. [[Argentine Constitution of 1853|Its first version]] was written in 1853 by a Constitutional Assembly gathered in [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], and the doctrinal basis was taken in part from the [[United States Constitution]]. It was then reformed in 1860, 1866, 1898, 1949, 1957 (which mainly repealed the 1949 reform), and the current version is the [[1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution|reformed text of 1994]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:JuanBaustistaAlberdi.JPG|thumb|230px|[[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], the legal scholar who drafted the 1853 Constitution.]] \nThe first attempt to divide political power in [[Argentina]] was during the government created after the [[May Revolution]] (Spanish: Revoluci\u00f3n de Mayo): the [[Primera Junta]] could not create new taxes without the ''Cabildo'''s authorization.\n\nMany revolutionary leaders, led by [[Mariano Moreno]], wanted to declare independence immediately and to make a constitution in order to build an independent state. In October 1811, the [[Junta Grande]], which succeeded the Primera Junta, enacted the Regulation for the Division of Power, but it was not accepted by the [[First Triumvirate (Argentina)|executive power]]. Nevertheless, the [[freedom of press]] and the Decree on Individual Security were accepted by November.\nIn 1813, the [[Asamblea del A\u00f1o XIII|General Constitutional Assembly]] was intended to declare a constitution but it could only declare the freedom for slaves' sons.\n\nIn [[Argentine Constitution of 1819|1819]] and [[Argentine Constitution of 1826|1826]] were declared two constitutions that eventually failed because of the disagreement between [[Federalist Party (Argentina)|Federalists]] and [[Unitarian Party|Unitarians]].\nMany other ''constitutional'' pacts existed between 1820 and 1853 (when the current Argentine Constitution was enacted). The most important of them are: the [[Treaty of Pilar]] (1820), the [[Quadrilateral Treaty|Treaty of the ''Cuadril\u00e1tero'']] (1822), the [[Pacto Federal|Federal Pact]] (1831), the Palermo Protocol (1852), and the [[San Nicol\u00e1s Agreement|Treaty of San Nicol\u00e1s]] (1852).\n\nThe [[Pacto Federal|Federal Pact]] urged all the provinces to call a General Federal Congress, however this would have limited [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]'s power who was the most powerful province governor, so the Congress was never called.\nWhen Rosas was defeated, in 1852, the [[San Nicol\u00e1s Agreement|Treaty of San Nicol\u00e1s]] finally called the Constitutional Congress that, in Santa Fe, on May 1, 1853, sworn to make effective the federal Constitution. Consequently, the [[Buenos Aires Province|Province of Buenos Aires]] left the [[Argentine Confederation]] until 1859.\n\n===Reforms to the 1853 Constitution===\nThe first constitutional amendment to the original 1853 text was performed in 1860 after Buenos Aires rejoined the Argentine Confederation. It consisted of several changes to many of the original articles. One of the major changes was the renaming of the state: according to the reform, the country would be officially named ''Rep\u00fablica Argentina'' (\"Argentine Republic\") and, for legal purposes, ''Naci\u00f3n Argentina'' (\"Argentine Nation\"), replacing the older Argentine Confederation denomination in all articles of the constitution. Another important inclusion was the constitutional recognizing of Buenos Aires' exclusive rights guaranteed by the Treaty of San Nicol\u00e1s.\n\nThe following reform was done in 1866 and established that exportation and importation taxes would be destined to the National Treasury indefinitely, no longer until 1866 as the 1860 reform did.\n\nIn 1898, another minor constitutional amendment was approved. It allowed a more flexible ratio for proportional apportionment in the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] and set the number of ministries to eight.\n\nDuring [[Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n]]'s government the [[Argentine Constitution of 1949]] was successfully passed, a major revision of the constitution. Its goal was to modernize and adapt the text to the twentieth century's concepts of democracy, as for example, including a list of ''social rights'' including better working conditions for the working class, right to good education, etc. This also was included into the principles stated on the Preamble. Also, it permitted the indefinite reelection of the president.\n\nDuring the military regime known as the ''[[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora]]'' that had deposed Per\u00f3n's government in 1955, in 1957 and before the elections that had to be held in 1958, a Constitutional Convention was elected to reform the constitution. This reform does not include 1949's, implicitly annulling it so the text was based on the 1898 one. The only changes done were to include a summary of Per\u00f3n's social articles known as ''article 14 bis'' (existing currently) and to establish the necessity to have a Labour and Social Security Code.\n\nIn 1972, a \"Constitutional Amendment\" done by the military government led by general [[Alejandro A. Lanusse]] reformed the 1957 text. This had to last until 1977 but its application could be extended until 1981 if no Constitutional Convention in 1976 decided either to accept it or reject it definitively. This amendment was not fully applied by the democratic government of Per\u00f3n in his third term nor by his wife [[Isabel Per\u00f3n]] acting as President after his death. Some changes were related to the size of Senate and one-term reelection of president and vice-president. Also reduced presidential, senatorial and deputies' terms all to four years.\n\nThe last (and current) version of the Argentine Constitution was done by [[Carlos Sa\u00fal Menem]] in 1994. It included many of the modifications from the 1972 \"amendment\" as the growth of the Senate size (three per Province), one-term presidential reelection and reduction of its term to four years. It also made [[Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires City]] an [[Autonomous city|autonomous entity]] with its own authorities. Other changes were done to ensure a softer presidentialist regime, the inclusion of a new chapter into the Bill of Rights related to politics, health and environment, and also the adoption of a much faster legislative procedure for creating laws. In addition with the 1994 constitutional reform, the requirement of belonging to the Roman Catholic faith in order to be President or Vice President of the Republic, was also abolished.<ref>{{cite web|title=Argentina 1853 (reinst. 1983, rev. 1994)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Argentina_1994?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Divisions==\nThe Argentine Constitution has four major division types; Parts, Titles, Divisions and Chapters, though these need not be present all the time. For example, the First Part is divided into Chapters but not into Titles nor Sections. The scheme of the Constitution is the following:\n*Preamble\n*First Part (43 sections)\n**First Chapter ''Declarations, rights and guarantees'' (35 sections)\n**Second Chapter ''New rights and guarantees'' (8 sections)\n*Second Part ''Authorities of the Nation'' (86 sections)\n**First Title ''Federal Government'' (77 sections)\n***First Division ''Of the Legislative Power'' (43 sections, 42 + 1 separated)\n****First Chapter ''Of the Chamber of Deputies'' (9 sections)\n****Second Chapter ''Of the Senate'' (9 sections)\n****Third Chapter ''Common dispositions to both Chambers'' (12 sections)\n****Fourth Chapter ''Attributions of the Congress'' (2 sections, of which one is sub-divided 32 times)\n****Fifth Chapter ''Of the formation of Laws'' (8 sections)\n****Sixth Chapter ''Of the [[Auditor\u00eda General de la Nacion|General Audit of the Nation]]'' (1 section)\n****Seventh Chapter ''Of the Ombudsman'' (1 section)\n***Second Division ''Of the Executive Power'' (21 sections)\n****First Chapter ''Of its nature and duration'' (7 sections)\n****Second Chapter ''Of the way and time of the election of the President and \n****Third Chapter ''Attributions of the of the Executive Power'' (1 section sub-divided 20 times)\n****Fourth Chapter ''Of the ministers'' (8 sections, of which one is sub-divided 13 times)\n***Third Division ''Of the Judicial Power'' (12 sections)\n****First Chapter ''Of its nature and duration'' (8 sections)\n****Second Chapter ''Attributions of the Judicial Power'' (4 sections)\n***Fourth Section ''Of the Public Ministry'' (1 section)\n**Second Title ''Provincial Governments'' (9 sections)\n*Transitorial Provisions\n\n==Preamble==\n[[Image:Constituci\u00f3n Nacional Argentina 1853 - p\u00e1gina 1.jpeg|thumb|240px|left|''\"Nos los Representantes del Pueblo de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina &hellip;\"'']]\nThe Preamble of the Argentine Constitution states or implies, in short terms, a number of starting points for the conception of the nation, such as a representative government. It acknowledges previous agreements to create a constitution (in order to legitimize the gathering of the Assembly). Finally, it lays the foundations for the policy of support of [[immigration in Argentina|immigration]], by asking \"for the protection of [[God]], source of all reason and justice\" for all people who desire to inhabit Argentina.\n\n==Declarations, rights and guarantees ==\nThe Constitution establishes a Bill of Rights and Guarantees for all individuals, Argentine or foreign; the inviolability of the right of life, liberty, equality, security and property. The second chapter, added in 1994, deals with public ethics, political rights, environmental protection and consumer rights.\n\nCivil rights are recognized to all inhabitants with no distinction of nationality. This is a consequence of the traditional interest of Argentina in the affluence of foreigners and foreign investment. Labor rights are also acknowledged (this is part of the legacy of [[Peronism]], resulting in the 1949 and 1957 reforms). These include limited labor day, just salary, right of organization, social security benefits, etc.\n\nThe constitution declares that no one can be deprived of property, except in case of judicial sentence based on previously enacted legislation, or through expropriation for reasons of public utility, dully qualified by law and previously indemnified. The person, its judicial defense, its domicile and correspondence are inviolable.\n\nWhat the law does not forbid is permitted. Individuals have complete freedom to do or refuse to do anything in private, except if that interferes with public order or morality, or causes damage to third parties.\n\nThe 1994 reform introduces several new legal figures: ''amparo judicial'' (an [[injunction]]), ''habeas corpus'' and ''habeas data''. Injunctions are destined to protect citizens from actual or imminent damage; ''[[habeas corpus (Argentine law)|habeas corpus]]'' (known for a long time to Argentine jurisprudence, and related to the [[habeas corpus]] of [[Common Law]]) is to protect the citizen's physical freedom; and ''[[habeas data (Argentine law)|habeas data]]'' is a person's right to access information about himself or herself, and request its confidentiality, a change or a suppression.\n\nThe Argentine Constitution's rights are divided in four groups: Civil, patrimonial, politic and social.\n\n===Declarations===\nDeclarations state the basis that hold the nation's politics and define it as an independent entity, for example, Article 1 states that the government is representative, republican and federal and Article 35 lists the Country's official names.\n\n===Guarantees===\nThey are institutional methods to protect the exercise of fundamental rights. They are so important that it is possible to say that a right can be held as long as it has a guarantee to protect it.\nMost of Guarantees are in the sections 18 and 43, between these are: habeas corpus, the abolition of death penalty and torture.\n\n===Rights===\nThe Argentine Constitution's rights are divided in four groups: Civil, patrimonial, politic and social.\n\n* '''Civil''' rights are related to the people as individuals. Some examples are: right to live, have honor, have a name, make associations and to express opinions.\n* '''Patrimonial''' rights protect men in relation to their goods. Some examples are: to own, to sell, to hire, and to build legal industries.\n* '''Politic''' rights allow people to take part in the government, by themselves or by electing representatives: this category includes the right to choose and be chosen for the government and to make or join a political party.\n* '''Social''' rights are related to people as part of society: these are (among many others) the rights to work, to have fair wages, to know, to learn, to teach.\n\nIn [[Argentina]], Freedom is one of the most important rights. Section 19 says that private actions of men that don't harm the public order or another man can not be judged by authorities. Moreover, it holds the \"principle of legality\": ''No inhabitant of the Nation will be forced to do what the law doesn't order nor forbidden to do what the law doesn't forbid''.\nEquality is as important as freedom. Section 16 states that in the country there are no noble titles and \"all its inhabitants are equal before the law\"\n\n==Form of government==\nAccording to the Constitution, Argentina is a representative [[federalism|federal]] [[republic]], divided in [[provinces of Argentina|provinces]], [[municipality|municipalities]], and the Autonomous City of [[Buenos Aires]]. Each province has the right and duty to dictate its own constitution, respecting the same principles as the national constitution.\n\n==Divisions of government powers==\n[[Image:Edificio del Congreso en Buenos Aires 2004.JPG|thumb|250px|Congress building in Buenos Aires, Argentina]]\nThe Constitution mandates a strict separation of government powers, into three branches (Executive, Legislative, and Judicial) and the Public Ministry.\n\n===Executive===\nThe Executive Branch is formed by the [[President of Argentina|President]], who is both head of state, as well as chief executive and head of government. (Art. 87). The Vice-President replaces the President in case of illness, absence from the capital, death, resignation, or removal.\n\nThe Vice-President doesn't belong to the executive branch. Curiously, it belongs to the legislative branch since he is also the President of the Senate. (Art. 57)\n\nThe President promulgates the laws sanctioned by Congress, and has veto power over them. The President directs international relations and is the Commander in Chief of the Army. In some cases, the President can issue [[Necessity and Urgency Decree|emergency decrees]].\n\nIn the 1994 amendments to the 1853 Constitution, the post of the Chief of the Cabinet Ministers was created who would serve as chief operating officer and would run the day-to-day operations of the government and will be at the same time, be politically responsible to the both Houses of the National Congress, the Senate and Chamber of Deputies and they can remove him or her via censure. The creation of the post was intended to reduce the presidentialist character of the country's presidential form of government.\n\n===Legislative===\nThe Legislative Branch is composed of the Vice-President, a bicameral Congress, the General Auditing Office of the Nation and the Ombudsman. Congress is divided in two Houses: ''C\u00e1mara de Diputados'' ([[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]], the Lower House) and ''C\u00e1mara de Senadores'' ([[Argentine Senate|Senate]], the Upper House).\n\nThe Vice-President belongs in the Legislative Branch since he (or she) is also the President of the Senate Chamber.\n\nThe General Auditing Office of the Nation is a technical advisory body of Congress with functional autonomy.\n\nThe Ombudsman is an independent body which works without receiving instructions from any authority. The mission of the Ombudsman is the defense and protection of human rights, civil rights and guarantees, and the control of the Administration.\n\n===Judicial===\nThe Judicial Branch is formed by the Supreme Court, and lower courts that Congress establishes in the territory of the Nation. The Supreme Justices and all judges hold their offices as long as they are not deposed for misbehavior and enjoy intangibility of remuneration.\n\n===Public Ministry===\nThe Public Ministry is an independent body with functional autonomy and financial autarchy, with the function of promoting justice for the defense of legality, of the general interests of society, in coordination with the other authorities of the Republic.\n\nIt is composed of an Procurator General of the Nation and an Deffender General of the Nation, and such other members as the law may establish.\n\nIts members enjoy functional immunities and intangibility of remuneration. (Art. 120).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Argentine Constitution of 1853]]\n* [[Argentine Constitution of 1949]]\n* [[Politics of Argentina]]\n* [[Law of Argentina]]\n* [[Constitution]]\n* [[Constitutional law]]\n* [[Constitutional economics]]\n* [[Constitutionalism]]\n* [[Rule according to higher law]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{wikisourcepar|Constitution of Argentina}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book | title = Formaci\u00f3n \u00c9tica y ciudadana, los derechos humanos, la vida en democracia y la sociedad justa | author= Casullo, Funes, Hirschmann, Rasnosky, and Schuster | isbn = 950-46-0582-6 | publisher =  Santillana | location = Bs.

It was then reformed in 1860, 1866, 1898, 1949, 1957 (which mainly repealed the 1949 reform), and the current version is the [[1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution|reformed text of 1994]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:JuanBaustistaAlberdi.JPG|thumb|230px|[[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], the legal scholar who drafted the 1853 Constitution.]] \nThe first attempt to divide political power in [[Argentina]] was during the government created after the [[May Revolution]] (Spanish: Revoluci\u00f3n de Mayo): the [[Primera Junta]] could not create new taxes without the ''Cabildo'''s authorization.\n\nMany revolutionary leaders, led by [[Mariano Moreno]], wanted to declare independence immediately and to make a constitution in order to build an independent state. In October 1811, the [[Junta Grande]], which succeeded the Primera Junta, enacted the Regulation for the Division of Power, but it was not accepted by the [[First Triumvirate (Argentina)|executive power]]. Nevertheless, the [[freedom of press]] and the Decree on Individual Security were accepted by November.\nIn 1813, the [[Asamblea del A\u00f1o XIII|General Constitutional Assembly]] was intended to declare a constitution but it could only declare the freedom for slaves' sons.\n\nIn [[Argentine Constitution of 1819|1819]] and [[Argentine Constitution of 1826|1826]] were declared two constitutions that eventually failed because of the disagreement between [[Federalist Party (Argentina)|Federalists]] and [[Unitarian Party|Unitarians]].\nMany other ''constitutional'' pacts existed between 1820 and 1853 (when the current Argentine Constitution was enacted). The most important of them are: the [[Treaty of Pilar]] (1820), the [[Quadrilateral Treaty|Treaty of the ''Cuadril\u00e1tero'']] (1822), the [[Pacto Federal|Federal Pact]] (1831), the Palermo Protocol (1852), and the [[San Nicol\u00e1s Agreement|Treaty of San Nicol\u00e1s]] (1852).\n\nThe [[Pacto Federal|Federal Pact]] urged all the provinces to call a General Federal Congress, however this would have limited [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]'s power who was the most powerful province governor, so the Congress was never called.\nWhen Rosas was defeated, in 1852, the [[San Nicol\u00e1s Agreement|Treaty of San Nicol\u00e1s]] finally called the Constitutional Congress that, in Santa Fe, on May 1, 1853, sworn to make effective the federal Constitution. Consequently, the [[Buenos Aires Province|Province of Buenos Aires]] left the [[Argentine Confederation]] until 1859.\n\n===Reforms to the 1853 Constitution===\nThe first constitutional amendment to the original 1853 text was performed in 1860 after Buenos Aires rejoined the Argentine Confederation. It consisted of several changes to many of the original articles. One of the major changes was the renaming of the state: according to the reform, the country would be officially named ''Rep\u00fablica Argentina'' (\"Argentine Republic\") and, for legal purposes, ''Naci\u00f3n Argentina'' (\"Argentine Nation\"), replacing the older Argentine Confederation denomination in all articles of the constitution. Another important inclusion was the constitutional recognizing of Buenos Aires' exclusive rights guaranteed by the Treaty of San Nicol\u00e1s.\n\nThe following reform was done in 1866 and established that exportation and importation taxes would be destined to the National Treasury indefinitely, no longer until 1866 as the 1860 reform did.\n\nIn 1898, another minor constitutional amendment was approved. It allowed a more flexible ratio for proportional apportionment in the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] and set the number of ministries to eight.\n\nDuring [[Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n]]'s government the [[Argentine Constitution of 1949]] was successfully passed, a major revision of the constitution. Its goal was to modernize and adapt the text to the twentieth century's concepts of democracy, as for example, including a list of ''social rights'' including better working conditions for the working class, right to good education, etc. This also was included into the principles stated on the Preamble. Also, it permitted the indefinite reelection of the president.\n\nDuring the military regime known as the ''[[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora]]'' that had deposed Per\u00f3n's government in 1955, in 1957 and before the elections that had to be held in 1958, a Constitutional Convention was elected to reform the constitution. This reform does not include 1949's, implicitly annulling it so the text was based on the 1898 one. The only changes done were to include a summary of Per\u00f3n's social articles known as ''article 14 bis'' (existing currently) and to establish the necessity to have a Labour and Social Security Code.\n\nIn 1972, a \"Constitutional Amendment\" done by the military government led by general [[Alejandro A. Lanusse]] reformed the 1957 text. This had to last until 1977 but its application could be extended until 1981 if no Constitutional Convention in 1976 decided either to accept it or reject it definitively. This amendment was not fully applied by the democratic government of Per\u00f3n in his third term nor by his wife [[Isabel Per\u00f3n]] acting as President after his death. Some changes were related to the size of Senate and one-term reelection of president and vice-president. Also reduced presidential, senatorial and deputies' terms all to four years.\n\nThe last (and current) version of the Argentine Constitution was done by [[Carlos Sa\u00fal Menem]] in 1994. It included many of the modifications from the 1972 \"amendment\" as the growth of the Senate size (three per Province), one-term presidential reelection and reduction of its term to four years. It also made [[Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires City]] an [[Autonomous city|autonomous entity]] with its own authorities. Other changes were done to ensure a softer presidentialist regime, the inclusion of a new chapter into the Bill of Rights related to politics, health and environment, and also the adoption of a much faster legislative procedure for creating laws. In addition with the 1994 constitutional reform, the requirement of belonging to the Roman Catholic faith in order to be President or Vice President of the Republic, was also abolished.<ref>{{cite web|title=Argentina 1853 (reinst. 1983, rev. 1994)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Argentina_1994?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Divisions==\nThe Argentine Constitution has four major division types; Parts, Titles, Divisions and Chapters, though these need not be present all the time. For example, the First Part is divided into Chapters but not into Titles nor Sections. The scheme of the Constitution is the following:\n*Preamble\n*First Part (43 sections)\n**First Chapter ''Declarations, rights and guarantees'' (35 sections)\n**Second Chapter ''New rights and guarantees'' (8 sections)\n*Second Part ''Authorities of the Nation'' (86 sections)\n**First Title ''Federal Government'' (77 sections)\n***First Division ''Of the Legislative Power'' (43 sections, 42 + 1 separated)\n****First Chapter ''Of the Chamber of Deputies'''(9 sections)\n****Second Chapter ''Of the Senate'' (9 sections)\n****Third Chapter ''Common dispositions to both Chambers'' (12 sections)\n****Fourth Chapter ''Powers of the Congress'' (2 sections, of which one is sub-divided 32 times)\n****Fifth Chapter ''Of the formation of Laws'' (8 sections)\n****Sixth Chapter ''Of the [[Auditor\u00eda General de la Nacion]]'' (1 section)\n****Seventh Chapter ''Of the Ombudsman'' (1 section)\n***Second Division ''Of the Executive Power'' (21 sections)\n****First Chapter ''Of its nature and duration'' (7 sections)\n****Second Chapter ''Of the way and time of the election of the President and \n****Third Chapter ''Powers of the Executive Branch'' (1 section sub-divided 20 times)\n****Fourth Chapter ''Of the ministers'' (8 sections, of which one is sub-divided 13 times)\n***Third Division ''Of the Judicial Power'' (12 sections)\n****First Chapter ''Of its nature and duration'' (8 sections)\n****Second Chapter ''Powers of the Judicial Branch'' (4 sections)\n***Fourth Section ''Of the Office of the Public Prosecution'' (1 section)\n**Second Title ''Provincial Governments'' (9 sections)\n*Transitorial Provisions\n\n==Preamble==\n[[Image:Constituci\u00f3n Nacional Argentina 1853 - p\u00e1gina 1.jpeg|thumb|240px|left|''\"Nos los Representantes del Pueblo de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina &hellip;\"'']]\nThe Preamble of the Argentine Constitution states or implies, in short terms, a number of starting points for the conception of the nation, such as a representative government. It acknowledges previous agreements to create a constitution (in order to legitimize the gathering of the Assembly). Finally, it lays the foundations for the policy of support of [[immigration in Argentina|immigration]], by asking \"for the protection of [[God]], source of all reason and justice\" for all people who desire to inhabit Argentina.\n\n==Declarations, rights and guarantees ==\nThe Constitution establishes a Bill of Rights and Guarantees for all individuals, Argentine or foreign; the inviolability of the right of life, liberty, equality, security and property. The second chapter, added in 1994, deals with public ethics, political rights, environmental protection and consumer rights.\n\nCivil rights are recognized to all inhabitants with no distinction of nationality. This is a consequence of the traditional interest of Argentina in the affluence of foreigners and foreign investment. Labor rights are also acknowledged (this is part of the legacy of [[Peronism]], resulting in the 1949 and 1957 reforms). These include limited labor day, just salary, right of organization, social security benefits, etc.\n\nThe constitution declares that no one can be deprived of property, except in case of judicial sentence based on previously enacted legislation, or through expropriation for reasons of public utility, dully qualified by law and previously indemnified. The person, its judicial defense, its domicile and correspondence are inviolable.\n\nWhat the law does not forbid is permitted. Individuals have complete freedom to do or refuse to do anything in private, except if that interferes with public order or morality, or causes damage to third parties.\n\nThe 1994 reform introduces several new legal figures: ''amparo judicial'' (an [[injunction]]), ''habeas corpus'' and ''habeas data''. Injunctions are destined to protect citizens from actual or imminent damage; ''[[habeas corpus (Argentine law)|habeas corpus]]'' (known for a long time to Argentine jurisprudence, and related to the [[habeas corpus]] of [[Common Law]]) is to protect the citizen's physical freedom; and ''[[habeas data (Argentine law)|habeas data]]'' is a person's right to access information about himself or herself, and request its confidentiality, a change or a suppression.\n\nThe Argentine Constitution's rights are divided in four groups: Civil, patrimonial, politic and social.\n\n===Declarations===\nDeclarations state the basis that hold the nation's politics and define it as an independent entity, for example, Article 1 states that the government is representative, republican and federal and Article 35 lists the Country's official names.\n\n===Guarantees===\nThey are institutional methods to protect the exercise of fundamental rights. They are so important that it is possible to say that a right can be held as long as it has a guarantee to protect it.\nMost of Guarantees are in the sections 18 and 43, between these are: habeas corpus, the abolition of death penalty and torture.\n\n===Rights===\nThe Argentine Constitution's rights are divided in four groups: Civil, patrimonial, politic and social.\n\n* '''Civil''' rights are related to the people as individuals. Some examples are: right to live, have honor, have a name, make associations and to express opinions.\n* '''Patrimonial''' rights protect men in relation to their goods. Some examples are: to own, to sell, to hire, and to build legal industries.\n* '''Politic''' rights allow people to take part in the government, by themselves or by electing representatives: this category includes the right to choose and be chosen for the government and to make or join a political party.\n* '''Social''' rights are related to people as part of society: these are (among many others) the rights to work, to have fair wages, to know, to learn, to teach.\n\nIn [[Argentina]], Freedom is one of the most important rights. Section 19 says that private actions of men that don't harm the public order or another man can not be judged by authorities. Moreover, it holds the \"principle of legality\": ''No inhabitant of the Nation will be forced to do what the law doesn't order nor forbidden to do what the law doesn't forbid''.\nEquality is as important as freedom. Section 16 states that in the country there are no noble titles and \"all its inhabitants are equal before the law\"\n\n==Form of government==\nAccording to the Constitution, Argentina is a representative [[federalism|federal]] [[republic]], divided in [[provinces of Argentina|provinces]], [[municipality|municipalities]], and the Autonomous City of [[Buenos Aires]]. Each province has the right and duty to dictate its own constitution, respecting the same principles as the national constitution.\n\n==Divisions of government powers==\n[[Image:Edificio del Congreso en Buenos Aires 2004.JPG|thumb|250px|Congress building in Buenos Aires, Argentina]]\nThe Constitution mandates a strict separation of government powers, into three branches (Executive, Legislative, and Judicial) and the Public Ministry.\n\n===Executive===\nThe Executive Branch is formed by the [[President of Argentina|President]], who is both head of state, as well as chief executive and head of government. (Art. 87). The Vice-President replaces the President in case of illness, absence from the capital, death, resignation, or removal.\n\nThe Vice-President doesn't belong to the executive branch. Curiously, it belongs to the legislative branch since he is also the President of the Senate. (Art. 57)\n\nThe President promulgates the laws sanctioned by Congress, and has veto power over them. The President directs international relations and is the Commander in Chief of the Army. In some cases, the President can issue [[Necessity and Urgency Decree|emergency decrees]].\n\nIn the 1994 amendments to the 1853 Constitution, the post of the Chief of the Cabinet Ministers was created who would serve as chief operating officer and would run the day-to-day operations of the government and will be at the same time, be politically responsible to the both Houses of the National Congress, the Senate and Chamber of Deputies and they can remove him or her via censure. The creation of the post was intended to reduce the presidentialist character of the country's presidential form of government.\n\n===Legislative===\nThe Legislative Branch is composed of the Vice-President, a bicameral Congress, the General Auditing Office of the Nation and the Ombudsman. Congress is divided in two Houses: ''C\u00e1mara de Diputados'' ([[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]], the Lower House) and ''C\u00e1mara de Senadores'' ([[Argentine Senate|Senate]], the Upper House).\n\nThe Vice-President belongs in the Legislative Branch since he (or she) is also the President of the Senate Chamber.\n\nThe General Auditing Office of the Nation is a technical advisory body of Congress with functional autonomy.\n\nThe Ombudsman is an independent body which works without receiving instructions from any authority. The mission of the Ombudsman is the defense and protection of human rights, civil rights and guarantees, and the control of the Administration.\n\n===Judicial===\nThe Judicial Branch is formed by the Supreme Court, and lower courts throughout the country. The Supreme Justices and all judges hold their offices as long as they are not deposed for misbehavior.\n\n===Public Ministry===\nThe Public Ministry is an independent body with functional autonomy and financial autarchy, with the function of promoting justice for the defense of legality, of the general interests of society, in coordination with the other authorities of the Republic.\n\nIt is composed of an Attorney General of the Nation and an Ombudsman General of the Nation, and such other members as the law may establish.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Argentine Constitution of 1853]]\n* [[Argentine Constitution of 1949]]\n* [[Politics of Argentina]]\n* [[Law of Argentina]]\n* [[Constitution]]\n* [[Constitutional law]]\n* [[Constitutional economics]]\n* [[Constitutionalism]]\n* [[Rule according to higher law]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{wikisourcepar|Constitution of Argentina}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book | title = Formaci\u00f3n \u00c9tica y ciudadana, los derechos humanos, la vida en democracia y la sociedad justa | author= Casullo, Funes, Hirschmann, Rasnosky, and Schuster | isbn = 950-46-0582-6 | publisher =  Santillana | location = Bs.

In the TV series, he is portrayed by [[England|English]] actor [[Ed Westwick]]. Although he is a secondary antagonist in the original book series, the TV series elevates him to an [[antihero]]ic main character, and the male lead of the show, where he is noted for his financial ambition, hedonism, personal style and (straight) sexuality. <ref>http://definitivetouch.com/features/20-distinguished-male-characters-tv-history</ref>\n\nSince they were children, Chuck has been best friends with [[Nate Archibald (Gossip Girl)|Nate Archibald]], [[Serena van der Woodsen]] and [[Blair Waldorf]], who is his main romantic interest throughout the series. In the TV series, he is also step-brother to Serena and [[Eric van der Woodsen]].\n\n==Novel series==\nChuck Bass is introduced by author Cecily von Ziegesar in her ''Gossip Girl'' series of teen novels, the first of which was published in 2002. In the novels, Chuck is a relatively minor character, and has a series of flings with male and female characters across the course of the series. He got his name, Chuck Bass, from his signature chuckle in a bass tone, which often sounds like a raspy whisper. Chuck's role is initially that of an antagonist to the main characters. Chuck resides with his family at the Plaza Hotel on the [[Upper East Side]] and attends school at the Riverside Preparatory School for Boys on the Upper East Side, along with scholarship student [[Dan Humphrey]]. Chuck is largely friendless, but is tolerated by the others because of his family's enormous wealth. He is described as having flamboyant fashion sense, with a penchant for scarves, and has a pet dog named Monkey. Lazy, and vain, Chuck's only interests are sex and money, and he is frequently chided by his father for lacking ambition and performing poorly in school. Following flings with numerous [[bisexuality|females and males]], his only serious relationship comes near the end of the series, when he begins dating Blair Waldorf, a self-obsessed, luxury loving teenager. In the twelfth book in the series, ''Gossip Girl: It Had To Be You'' (2007), Chuck is rejected from colleges because of poor grades and is sent to military school by his father. When next mentioned in ''Gossip Girl'' spin-off, ''The Carlyles'' (2008), it is stated that Chuck never showed up to military school, and his whereabouts thereafter are unknown. In the thirteenth ''Gossip Girl'' novel, ''I Will Always Love You'' (2009), it is revealed that Chuck went off to school in California and returned a changed man, and to have dated main character Blair Waldorf in [[Oxford]], [[England]] for a year.\n\n==TV series==\n{{long plot|date=August 2013}}\nConstance Billiard School is an exaggerated version of ''Gossip Girl'' author [[Cecily von Ziegesar]]'s alma mater, the [[Nightingale-Bamford School]]. It was revealed in preparation for the 2007 TV series debut, [[Josh Schwartz]] hired recent graduates of Ziegesar's alma mater to retool several characters.<ref>Walper, Simone (September 2, 2010) \"Sp\u00e9cial trading, entrez sur le Forex avec l'euro/dollar.\" MoneyWeek. Numerous 096.</ref>\n\nChuck Bass was then reconfigured as a more central character, an antiheroic playboy whose on-off relationship with [[Blair Waldorf]] serves as one of the show's major ongoing storylines. Chuck is the resident \"bad boy\" of the [[Upper East Side]], and like Blair, is both vengeful and manipulative; the two often scheme elaborate plans together. As the show progresses, Chuck develops a softer side, specifically towards Blair, his chief love interest, and Lily, Eric, and Serena, his adoptive mother, brother, and sister.\n\n===Season 1===\nChuck grew up on the [[Upper East Side]] with his three best friends and fellow elites [[Nate Archibald (Gossip Girl)|Nate Archibald]], [[Blair Waldorf]], and future-stepsister [[Serena van der Woodsen]]. His father is Bart Bass, a self-made billionaire, which is irregular, compared to the Bass' old money friends. Chuck is often described as the \"bad boy of his circle.\" Chuck is a playboy and [[Promiscuity#Male promiscuity|womanizer]] who sees women as recreational tools. Chuck frequently skips class and smokes [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].\n\nIn the pilot episode, Chuck attempts to [[rape]] both Serena and [[Jenny Humphrey]]. When speaking about Serena in the pilot episode, Chuck says, \"Serena looked effin' hot last night. There's something wrong with that level of perfection. It needs to be violated.\" With time, he attenuates his behaviors as a sexual predator and becomes more of a manipulating womanizer.   However, his lecherous attitude continues as he makes multiple advances on his step-sister at the time, Serena.\n\nIn episode seven, \"Victor/Victrola\", Chuck purchases a [[burlesque]] club, Victrola. After Nate and Blair break up, Blair visits Chuck at Victrola where she ends up performing on stage. She later loses her virginity to him in the back of his [[limousine]]. Though she tries to deny the encounter, Chuck buys a necklace for her and admits that he feels \"butterflies\" in her presence, leading to a clandestine sexual relationship. Despite this, Nate and Blair rekindle their relationship, leading to a jealous Chuck revealing to the anonymous \"Gossip Girl\" that Blair and Chuck had a sexual relationship. This leads Chuck to have a temporary rift with both Blair and Nate.\n\nAs Bart Bass and Lily van der Woodsen's relationship progresses, they decide to move their families in together. Chuck and [[Eric van der Woodsen]], Lily's son and Serena's younger brother, become especially close. When Serena begins receiving mysterious packages ([[pornography]] in the mail, [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] delivered to her at school), she automatically blames Chuck. Given the creepy remarks Chuck has made about \"bathing together\" and \"turning that onepiece into a no-piece.\" Serena is not to blame. Bart subsequently forces Chuck to move out of the family home. Serena discovers that the culprit was actually [[Georgina Sparks]], a past classmate of both Serena and Chuck. It is later revealed that Chuck lost his virginity to Georgina in the sixth grade. Chuck and Blair join together to prevent Georgina from further harming and embarrassing Serena. This process rekindles their bond, and they succeed in getting rid of Georgina.\n\nAt Bart and Lily's [[wedding]] at the end of Season 1, Chuck apologizes and confesses to Nate that he was in love with Blair. During the wedding reception, Chuck gives a speech about forgiveness that is implied to be directed towards Blair. She accepts his apology and the two kiss. However, as they are about to embark on a trip to [[Tuscany]] together, Chuck gets [[cold feet]]. Blair leaves for Tuscany without him, as Chuck has decided to seduce Amelia, tossing the roses for Blair in the trash can.\n\n===Season 2===\nIn the season premiere, \"Summer Kind of Wonderful\", we learn Blair has stayed in Europe. Chuck regretted his actions but told this to Blair too late as she was already dating Lord Marcus Beaton. Blair asks Chuck to tell her he loves her, but his fear of commitment stops him.\n\nIn order to gather material for a story, Dan tags along with Chuck for a night, ending with the two of them in jail after a fistfight. While in jail, Chuck tells Dan in confidence that Chuck's mother died while giving birth to him, and that his father blames him for her death, which explains their icy relationship. When Chuck later discovers that Dan was using him for a story, he feels betrayed and tells Dan that he was lying about all of it.\n\nChuck's storyline throughout season 2 mainly deals with his inability to tell Blair that he loves her. Eventually, his father is killed in a car accident. Lily adopts him so that he's able to own Bass Industries, making Serena and Eric his sister and brother. When Blair begins dating Nate again, Chuck realizes his true feelings for her. The two team up to take down Poppy Lifton, and Blair realizes that she still has feelings for Chuck as well. She breaks up with Nate. In the final episode of season 2, Chuck admits to Blair his true feelings and the two finally begin a relationship.\n\n===Season 3===\nWhen Season 3 returns, Chuck and Blair are very happy and very much in love. Chuck struggles to run Bass Industries to his deceased father's impeccably high standards. He buys [[The Empire Hotel (New York City)|The Empire Hotel]]. Halfway through the season, Chuck meets a woman claiming to be his mother called Elizabeth Fisher. After initially rejecting her, Chuck finally accepts Elizabeth and is then met with a sexual harassment claim from his former employees. Despite his innocence, he settles to keep the scandal out of the media. Jack Bass, Chuck's sinister uncle, informs the media anyway and necessitates Chuck signing the hotel over to Elizabeth to appease the public. She betrays him and signs the hotel over to Jack, whom she loves. However, she calls Chuck to say goodbye and reveals that Jack chose the hotel over her. She then reveals to Chuck that she is not his mother and she does not know whether his real mother is alive or dead.\n\nChuck and Blair agree to team up to take down Jack to get the hotel back. Jack tells them both (separately) that he will only give up the hotel if he has sex with Blair. Unbeknown to Blair, Chuck sets the situation up and Blair goes to Jack's. After a kiss, Jack tells Blair the truth about Chuck's involvement. Blair breaks up with Chuck and he gets the hotel back, vowing to get Blair back too. Chuck tries desperately to win Blair back, doing everything from banning all of the other Upper East Side men from dating her to asking her to meet him on top of the [[Empire State Building]]. Blair decides that Chuck is her true love and she's going to meet him, but Dorota suddenly goes into labor and she ends up being two hours late. Chuck, thinking she is finally over him, leaves the building heartbroken and nearly suicidal. When he gets home, he sees that [[Jenny Humphrey]] has arrived looking for Nate. The two drunkenly sleep together, heartbroken that their true loves don't return their feelings.\n\nBlair appears later in Chuck's suite, apologizing for being late, and the two reunite (sleep together). Chuck is about to propose to Blair at the hospital, as they visit Dorota and her new baby, when Dan appears and rashly delivers a punch to Chuck's face. He then forces Chuck to tell Blair what happened between him and Jenny. Blair breaks things off with Chuck and informs him that it's over for good. She also threatens to ruin Jenny's life if she doesn't leave Manhattan immediately. Chuck then travels to Prague to escape New York for a while, feeling as though he has nothing left. He gets robbed by two muggers who insist on taking the ring that Chuck intended on proposing to Blair with and when Chuck puts up a fight, he gets shot. The last shot of season 3 is him lying in an alley, presumably dying.\n\n===Season 4===\nIn the first episode of season four, we find that Chuck is alive and well, having been rescued by Czech girl, Eva ([[Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy]]) who has no idea of his wealth or who he is. He creates a fake name and persona as he no longer wants to be the manipulative Chuck Bass. He eventually reveals who he really is and returns to [[New York City]] with her, at the request of Blair and Serena. Blair insists she no longer loves him, but still schemes to undermine his new relationship. He eventually falls for one of her schemes and breaks up with Eva. He realizes his mistake and begs her to take him back, but she refuses, saying that he showed his true feelings by continuing to believe Blair over anyone else.\n\nChuck asks Blair whether she still has feelings for him, and she denies it, prompting him to declare \"war\" on her. He tries to \"take\" Columbia from her, and arranges for Jenny Humphrey to return to the city in order to stir up trouble for Blair, who still hasn't told her minions why she banished Jenny from the Upper East Side in the first place. After Jenny declares that it's only a matter of time before they both destroy each other, Chuck and Blair agree to a truce. They even draw up a contract, with the stipulation \"no touching,\" but their mutual attraction proves too powerful and they soon fall into an enemies-with-benefits relationship.\n\nIn \"The Witches of Bushwick\", Chuck accidentally tells Blair during foreplay that he loves her and, not knowing whether his words are true, Blair chooses to gloss over the moment. Although Chuck and Blair spend the episode striving for different ends which will eventually alienate each other (Blair to become the face of Anne Archibald's charity, Girls Inc, and Chuck to increase the revenue of The Empire by returning to his bad boy persona), Blair makes the decision to attend Chuck's Saints and Sinners party in order to confront him. Chuck confesses that he loves her, and the pair kiss in front of everyone after the curtain concealing them is pulled down. Anne tells Blair that she can no longer be a part of Girls Inc just as Chuck's publicist KC tells Chuck that she thinks Blair will be good for business. Blair re-thinks her decision to sacrifice it all for their relationship, and she and Chuck break up once again. Chuck promises he'll wait for her, and both affirm their belief that their love will reunite them in the end.\n\nOn Thanksgiving Chuck and Blair run into each other at Serena's house, Chuck offers to leave but she tells him that she was heading to JFK anyway and came to drop off the traditional pie and that they should get used to this. They hear about Serena being hospitalized and while they're sharing that maybe nothing can change between them, Jenny walks in and interrupts their conversation. While driving Blair home, Chuck tells her that he showed up only for Serena. When she told him that what happened with Serena made her question what she told him after the Saints & Sinners party; Chuck tells her that he cannot be her friend now as much as he wishes he could. After that Blair still sends him her traditional pie, saying that even if they can't be friends it doesn't mean that they aren't.\n\nIn \"The Townie\" episode, It was revealed that Lily was going to sell Bass Industries instead of giving Chuck the company back. So he sets off to New Zealand, where his uncle Jack Bass is currently living. In the following episodes Chuck returns to the Upper East Side with revenge for Lily. Chuck's new love interest is Raina and her father is Russell Thorpe, a former rival of Chuck's late father Bart Bass. Russell is the main contender to buy Bass industries. Chuck, however, manages to save the company after it is revealed that Russell accidentally killed his wife in a building fire that Bart was originally accused of.\n\nIn \"The Princess and the Frog\" he learns that Blair's relationship with Louis is serious, and that there is talk about them getting engaged. He gets drunk and embarrasses Blair in front of Louis' mother, and later tries to force himself on her, while pushing her down and smashing a glass window right next to her face, after she tells him about her engagement. Blair ends up with her cheek being cut.\n\nLater, Blair is kidnapped by Russell, but Chuck saves her, and the two go to a Bar Mitzah. There, the two are seen dancing and smiling happily. Blair pulls him off the dance floor into a private room and the two have sex. Blair decides she is going to leave Louis, but Chuck stops her, telling her that she needs to be with Louis because he makes her happy. At the end of the episode, Chuck decides to spend the summer traveling with Nate.\n\n====Controversy====\n{{further|Blair Waldorf#Controversy}}\nFollowing the 20th episode of Season 4, Safran spoke on behalf of the series regarding the scene in which Chuck became violent with Blair.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jennifer |last=Arrow |coauthors= |title=''Gossip Girl'' Boss: \"Chuck Has Never, and Will Never, Hurt Blair\" |work=[[E!]] Online |page= |date=May 3, 2011 |accessdate= May 10, 2011 |quote= |url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b239902_gossip_girl_boss_chuck_has_never_will.html}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The way we viewed it, I think it's very clear that Blair is not afraid in those moments, for herself. They have a volatile relationship, they always have, but I do not believe\u2014or I should say we do not believe\u2014that it is abuse when it's the two of them. Chuck does not try to hurt Blair. He punches the glass because he has rage, but he has never, and will never, hurt Blair. He knows it and she knows it, and I feel it's very important to know that she is not scared\u2014if anything, she is scared for Chuck\u2014and what he might do to himself, but she is never afraid of what he might do to her. Leighton and I were very clear about that.}}\n\n===Season 5===\nIn the first episode of season 5, we find out that Chuck has spent his summer traveling the world with Nate. The two arrive in Los Angeles to meet up with Serena, who is working as an assistant on a film set. Seemingly over his break up with Blair, Chuck exhibits a positive outlook on life, telling Serena and Nate that he's seeking to experience everything he can in life. However, his heartbreak soon becomes apparent when he receives an invitation to Blair's upcoming wedding, which causes him to drive recklessly and get into a motorbike accident. In the following episode, it is revealed that Chuck has an emotional disorder as a result of his losing Blair, and which now causes him to be numb to physical and emotional stimuli. Dan decides to help Chuck break through this emotional barrier, and gets him a dog, hoping to spark some emotion. However, it is only when Blair reveals to him that she is pregnant with Louis's baby does Chuck begin feel again \u2013 he is shown crying over the revelation at the end of the episode. He names the dog \"Monkey\" (a homage to the pet monkey Chuck's character had in the books). He forms a reluctant friendship with Dan from here on.\n\nHe meets a psychiatrist, Eliza Barnes, who tells him that he acts out because he never had a childhood, and needs help. When he finds himself falling back into his old patterns, he calls Dr. Barnes, ready to seek that help. However, it is revealed that Blair's fianc\u00e9, Louis, gives Dr. Barnes money to upset Chuck, in hopes that he will do something reckless and drive Blair away forever. When Chuck finds this out, he publicly exposes both Dr. Barnes and Louis, leaving Blair devastated. Later that same night, he goes to Blair's apartment to finally apologize to her for all the times he's hurt her and let her down. His apology recounts all the obstacles Chuck and Blair have faced in their relationship thus far, and prompts an emotional Blair to thank him. Chuck assures her that she is going to be \"an amazing mother\", having come to terms with her relationship with Louis.\n\nHe resolves to keep his distance from her after that, but in \"The Big Sleep No More\", a conflicted Blair seduces him in the hope to prove that his efforts to be a better man is just a ploy to win her back. When he kisses her, she slaps him, and tells him that he will never change. It is later revealed that he conspired with Dorota and kissed Blair in order to confirm her suspicions of him, and push her back to Louis. In the episode \"Riding in Town Cars with Boys\" he admits to Blair that he still loves her. They profess their love for one another in Chuck's limo. This occurs whilst the limo is being chased by paparazzi on motorbikes and results in a car crash. Lily reveals at the conclusion of the episode that Blair is awake and doing fine, but whether or not Chuck has survived was not revealed.\n\nWe later discover that Chuck did indeed survive the accident after a blood transfusion was donated to him. He wakes up to a very distant Blair, very opposite to the one he got into an accident with. For the next few episodes he chases her to discover what has changed her mind \u2013 unbeknownst to him, Blair has made a pact with God over his life, where if she breaks her promise to Louis, Chuck will surely die. This leads to Blair going to Chuck's penthouse in the episode \"The End of the Affair\" where she tells him what a good man he has become and to not let the ending of their relationship destroy him.\n\nIn [[G.G. (Gossip Girl)|G.G.]], Chuck is willing to accept the fact that Blair is marrying another man, when Blair's mother tries to convince him to stop the wedding. He makes one final play for Blair, but Blair \u2013 despite saying that she \"loves him more and more every day, if it's even possible to love somebody that much\" \u2013 once more rebuffs him, saying that she's actually doing this for him. Their conversation is unknowingly recorded, and released in a blast by Gossip Girl during the wedding. Despite this, Blair still marries Louis, but flees the reception with Dan when Louis reveals that their relationship is now strictly business.\n\nWith the help of Dan, Blair tries to leave for the Dominican Republic to get a divorce from Louis without his consent due to a loophole in the Dominican Republic's law, but forgets her passport. Chuck, Nate and Serena eventually find Blair hiding out in a hotel room with Dan. However, Sophia finds Blair and threatens to forcefully sell Eleanor's company as dowry if Blair chooses not to return. Blair reluctantly goes back to Louis, despite an offer from Chuck to pay her dowry.\n\nIn \"Cross Rhodes\", Blair realizes she now has feelings for Dan, and Chuck and Serena struggle with watching their loves with their friends.\n\nIn \"The Princess Dowry\", Chuck pays Blair's dowry so she can be free, but wishes for it to remain a secret. She finds out and accuses him of wanting to own her. He admits that he paid the dowry, but for her freedom and her freedom only. At the end of the episode, Blair begins a relationship with Dan.\n\nIn \"Con Heir\", Chuck invites his uncle, Jack, back to New York to thank him for saving his life in the car accident by donating blood, but starts to doubt Jack's story when Chuck investigates and learns that Jack was recently diagnosed positive with Hepatitis C, and a test on Chuck turns to be negative. This kicks off a lot of \"mother/father\" issues for Chuck \u2013 he believes that it was Elizabeth Fisher who donated the blood, then Diana says that she is his mother when Bart cheated on Elizabeth with her (she claims that an arrangement was made with Diana leaving town alone, leaving Chuck to be raised by Bart and Elizabeth because Elizabeth couldn't get pregnant), but in \"Despicable B\", Nate receives a picture from Elizabeth that indeed shows her pregnant with Chuck. Chuck is more interested in the man in the picture with Elizabeth \u2013 his face is cut out, but his tattooed arm is still visible. Jack Bass has exactly the same tattoo.\n\nIt all comes to a head in \"Raiders of the Lost Art\", when he, Blair, Serena, Nate and Lola team together to crack the code in Diana's day planner \u2013 the code they believe will lead them to Jack Bass. They end up at a brothel that Diana is in charge of. Diana realizes that they are there and has the event shut down. During the chaos, Blair searches one of the rooms, still looking for Jack, and is shocked by what she sees. Blair later tells Chuck to re-enter the building once everyone is gone, which he does, and it is revealed that Bart Bass is still alive.\n\nBart reveals that he faked his death to save Chuck and Lily, and has been hiding from everyone for the past three years. The car crash actually happened, and that it was ordered by one of Bart's enemies. When he was in the hospital, he paid the doctor to say he died and then recruited Diana Payne to help him hide. Diana kept Bart informed of when Chuck was in trouble, so when Chuck was in the hospital, Bart was the one who donated his blood to save Chuck.\n\nIn \"The Return of the Ring\", Bart drops the bombshell that he will be returning to Bass Industries as \"the only Bass in Bass Industries\", pushing Chuck out of the company. Bart tells Chuck that the most he did was 'redecorate' and give everything up for Blair. After this, Blair declares her love for Chuck, admitting she finally really wants them to be together. Chuck rejects her in anger, shadowing the words she once said to him: \"I don't want to be Mr. Blair Waldorf.\"\n\nChuck pairs up with an unlikely partner \u2013 Jack \u2013 to take down his father. They meet in a casino in Monte Carlo. Blair turns up, informed by Jack of Chuck's whereabouts. Blair reveals she is 'all in' and one hundred per cent ready to be with him. His decision on the matter is thus far unknown.\n\n===Season 6===\nAt the beginning of the season Chuck and Blair make a pact not to be together until Blair succeeds at Waldorf Designs and Chuck takes down Bart. After many failed attempts of taking down Bart, Bart and Chuck end up in a fight. This leads to Bart falling off a building and dying. Blair is the only witness to this event and so Chuck and Blair get married so Blair does not have to testify against Chuck.\n\nIn the 5-year flash forward, Chuck and Blair are happily married with a son (Henry). They are all gathered at the Bass house for Dan and Serena's wedding.\n\n==Characterization==\n[[Ed Westwick]] who portrays the character on the television series said: \"As the [first] season's progressed, I think everyone's had sympathy for him. I think he's an alluring character; he's very interesting. He has these slices of his personality. He can be the devil, but at times he can be very charming. It can be a very dangerous concoction.

Although he is a secondary antagonist in the original book series, the TV series elevates him to an [[antihero]]ic main character, and the male lead of the show, where he is noted for his financial ambition, hedonism and personal style.<ref>http://definitivetouch.com/features/20-distinguished-male-characters-tv-history</ref>\n\nSince they were children, Chuck has been best friends with [[Nate Archibald (Gossip Girl)|Nate Archibald]], [[Serena van der Woodsen]] and [[Blair Waldorf]], who is his main romantic interest throughout the series. In the TV series, he is also step-brother to Serena and [[Eric van der Woodsen]].\n\n==Novel series==\nChuck Bass is introduced by author Cecily von Ziegesar in her ''Gossip Girl'' series of teen novels, the first of which was published in 2002. In the novels, Chuck is a relatively minor character, and has a series of flings with male and female characters across the course of the series. He got his name, Chuck Bass, from his signature chuckle in a bass tone, which often sounds like a raspy whisper. Chuck's role is initially that of an antagonist to the main characters. Chuck resides with his family at the Plaza Hotel on the [[Upper East Side]] and attends school at the Riverside Preparatory School for Boys on the Upper East Side, along with scholarship student [[Dan Humphrey]]. Chuck is largely friendless, but is tolerated by the others because of his family's enormous wealth. He is described as having flamboyant fashion sense, with a penchant for scarves, and has a pet dog named Monkey. Lazy, and vain, Chuck's only interests are sex and money, and he is frequently chided by his father for lacking ambition and performing poorly in school. Following flings with numerous [[bisexuality|females and males]], his only serious relationship comes near the end of the series, when he begins dating Blair Waldorf, a self-obsessed, luxury loving teenager. In the twelfth book in the series, ''Gossip Girl: It Had To Be You'' (2007), Chuck is rejected from colleges because of poor grades and is sent to military school by his father. When next mentioned in ''Gossip Girl'' spin-off, ''The Carlyles'' (2008), it is stated that Chuck never showed up to military school, and his whereabouts thereafter are unknown. In the thirteenth ''Gossip Girl'' novel, ''I Will Always Love You'' (2009), it is revealed that Chuck went off to school in California and returned a changed man, and to have dated main character Blair Waldorf in [[Oxford]], [[England]] for a year.\n\n==TV series==\n{{long plot|date=August 2013}}\nConstance Billiard School is an exaggerated version of ''Gossip Girl'' author [[Cecily von Ziegesar]]'s alma mater, the [[Nightingale-Bamford School]]. It was revealed in preparation for the 2007 TV series debut, [[Josh Schwartz]] hired recent graduates of Ziegesar's alma mater to retool several characters.<ref>Walper, Simone (September 2, 2010) \"Sp\u00e9cial trading, entrez sur le Forex avec l'euro/dollar.\" MoneyWeek. Numerous 096.</ref>\n\nChuck Bass was then reconfigured as a more central character, an antiheroic playboy whose on-off relationship with [[Blair Waldorf]] serves as one of the show's major ongoing storylines. Chuck is the resident \"bad boy\" of the [[Upper East Side]], and like Blair, is both vengeful and manipulative; the two often scheme elaborate plans together. As the show progresses, Chuck develops a softer side, specifically towards Blair, his chief love interest, and Lily, Eric, and Serena, his adoptive mother, brother, and sister.\n\n===Season 1===\nChuck grew up on the [[Upper East Side]] with his three best friends and fellow elites [[Nate Archibald (Gossip Girl)|Nate Archibald]], [[Blair Waldorf]], and future-stepsister [[Serena van der Woodsen]]. His father is Bart Bass, a self-made billionaire, which is irregular, compared to the Bass' old money friends. Chuck is often described as the \"bad boy of his circle.\" Chuck is a playboy and [[Promiscuity#Male promiscuity|womanizer]] who sees women as recreational tools. Chuck frequently skips class and smokes [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].\n\nIn the pilot episode, Chuck attempts to [[rape]] both Serena and [[Jenny Humphrey]]. When speaking about Serena in the pilot episode, Chuck says, \"Serena looked effin' hot last night. There's something wrong with that level of perfection. It needs to be violated.\" With time, he attenuates his behaviors as a sexual predator and becomes more of a manipulating womanizer.   However, his lecherous attitude continues as he makes multiple advances on his step-sister at the time, Serena.\n\nIn episode seven, \"Victor/Victrola\", Chuck purchases a [[burlesque]] club, Victrola. After Nate and Blair break up, Blair visits Chuck at Victrola where she ends up performing on stage. She later loses her virginity to him in the back of his [[limousine]]. Though she tries to deny the encounter, Chuck buys a necklace for her and admits that he feels \"butterflies\" in her presence, leading to a clandestine sexual relationship. Despite this, Nate and Blair rekindle their relationship, leading to a jealous Chuck revealing to the anonymous \"Gossip Girl\" that Blair and Chuck had a sexual relationship. This leads Chuck to have a temporary rift with both Blair and Nate.\n\nAs Bart Bass and Lily van der Woodsen's relationship progresses, they decide to move their families in together. Chuck and [[Eric van der Woodsen]], Lily's son and Serena's younger brother, become especially close. When Serena begins receiving mysterious packages ([[pornography]] in the mail, [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] delivered to her at school), she automatically blames Chuck. Given the creepy remarks Chuck has made about \"bathing together\" and \"turning that onepiece into a no-piece.\" Serena is not to blame. Bart subsequently forces Chuck to move out of the family home. Serena discovers that the culprit was actually [[Georgina Sparks]], a past classmate of both Serena and Chuck. It is later revealed that Chuck lost his virginity to Georgina in the sixth grade. Chuck and Blair join together to prevent Georgina from further harming and embarrassing Serena. This process rekindles their bond, and they succeed in getting rid of Georgina.\n\nAt Bart and Lily's [[wedding]] at the end of Season 1, Chuck apologizes and confesses to Nate that he was in love with Blair. During the wedding reception, Chuck gives a speech about forgiveness that is implied to be directed towards Blair. She accepts his apology and the two kiss. However, as they are about to embark on a trip to [[Tuscany]] together, Chuck gets [[cold feet]]. Blair leaves for Tuscany without him, as Chuck has decided to seduce Amelia, tossing the roses for Blair in the trash can.\n\n===Season 2===\nIn the season premiere, \"Summer Kind of Wonderful\", we learn Blair has stayed in Europe. Chuck regretted his actions but told this to Blair too late as she was already dating Lord Marcus Beaton. Blair asks Chuck to tell her he loves her, but his fear of commitment stops him.\n\nIn order to gather material for a story, Dan tags along with Chuck for a night, ending with the two of them in jail after a fistfight. While in jail, Chuck tells Dan in confidence that Chuck's mother died while giving birth to him, and that his father blames him for her death, which explains their icy relationship. When Chuck later discovers that Dan was using him for a story, he feels betrayed and tells Dan that he was lying about all of it.\n\nChuck's storyline throughout season 2 mainly deals with his inability to tell Blair that he loves her. Eventually, his father is killed in a car accident. Lily adopts him so that he's able to own Bass Industries, making Serena and Eric his sister and brother. When Blair begins dating Nate again, Chuck realizes his true feelings for her. The two team up to take down Poppy Lifton, and Blair realizes that she still has feelings for Chuck as well. She breaks up with Nate. In the final episode of season 2, Chuck admits to Blair his true feelings and the two finally begin a relationship.\n\n===Season 3===\nWhen Season 3 returns, Chuck and Blair are very happy and very much in love. Chuck struggles to run Bass Industries to his deceased father's impeccably high standards. He buys [[The Empire Hotel (New York City)|The Empire Hotel]]. Halfway through the season, Chuck meets a woman claiming to be his mother called Elizabeth Fisher. After initially rejecting her, Chuck finally accepts Elizabeth and is then met with a sexual harassment claim from his former employees. Despite his innocence, he settles to keep the scandal out of the media. Jack Bass, Chuck's sinister uncle, informs the media anyway and necessitates Chuck signing the hotel over to Elizabeth to appease the public. She betrays him and signs the hotel over to Jack, whom she loves. However, she calls Chuck to say goodbye and reveals that Jack chose the hotel over her. She then reveals to Chuck that she is not his mother and she does not know whether his real mother is alive or dead.\n\nChuck and Blair agree to team up to take down Jack to get the hotel back. Jack tells them both (separately) that he will only give up the hotel if he has sex with Blair. Unbeknown to Blair, Chuck sets the situation up and Blair goes to Jack's. After a kiss, Jack tells Blair the truth about Chuck's involvement. Blair breaks up with Chuck and he gets the hotel back, vowing to get Blair back too. Chuck tries desperately to win Blair back, doing everything from banning all of the other Upper East Side men from dating her to asking her to meet him on top of the [[Empire State Building]]. Blair decides that Chuck is her true love and she's going to meet him, but Dorota suddenly goes into labor and she ends up being two hours late. Chuck, thinking she is finally over him, leaves the building heartbroken and nearly suicidal. When he gets home, he sees that [[Jenny Humphrey]] has arrived looking for Nate. The two drunkenly sleep together, heartbroken that their true loves don't return their feelings.\n\nBlair appears later in Chuck's suite, apologizing for being late, and the two reunite (sleep together). Chuck is about to propose to Blair at the hospital, as they visit Dorota and her new baby, when Dan appears and rashly delivers a punch to Chuck's face. He then forces Chuck to tell Blair what happened between him and Jenny. Blair breaks things off with Chuck and informs him that it's over for good. She also threatens to ruin Jenny's life if she doesn't leave Manhattan immediately. Chuck then travels to Prague to escape New York for a while, feeling as though he has nothing left. He gets robbed by two muggers who insist on taking the ring that Chuck intended on proposing to Blair with and when Chuck puts up a fight, he gets shot. The last shot of season 3 is him lying in an alley, presumably dying.\n\n===Season 4===\nIn the first episode of season four, we find that Chuck is alive and well, having been rescued by Czech girl, Eva ([[Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy]]) who has no idea of his wealth or who he is. He creates a fake name and persona as he no longer wants to be the manipulative Chuck Bass. He eventually reveals who he really is and returns to [[New York City]] with her, at the request of Blair and Serena. Blair insists she no longer loves him, but still schemes to undermine his new relationship. He eventually falls for one of her schemes and breaks up with Eva. He realizes his mistake and begs her to take him back, but she refuses, saying that he showed his true feelings by continuing to believe Blair over anyone else.\n\nChuck asks Blair whether she still has feelings for him, and she denies it, prompting him to declare \"war\" on her. He tries to \"take\" Columbia from her, and arranges for Jenny Humphrey to return to the city in order to stir up trouble for Blair, who still hasn't told her minions why she banished Jenny from the Upper East Side in the first place. After Jenny declares that it's only a matter of time before they both destroy each other, Chuck and Blair agree to a truce. They even draw up a contract, with the stipulation \"no touching,\" but their mutual attraction proves too powerful and they soon fall into an enemies-with-benefits relationship.\n\nIn \"The Witches of Bushwick\", Chuck accidentally tells Blair during foreplay that he loves her and, not knowing whether his words are true, Blair chooses to gloss over the moment. Although Chuck and Blair spend the episode striving for different ends which will eventually alienate each other (Blair to become the face of Anne Archibald's charity, Girls Inc, and Chuck to increase the revenue of The Empire by returning to his bad boy persona), Blair makes the decision to attend Chuck's Saints and Sinners party in order to confront him. Chuck confesses that he loves her, and the pair kiss in front of everyone after the curtain concealing them is pulled down. Anne tells Blair that she can no longer be a part of Girls Inc just as Chuck's publicist KC tells Chuck that she thinks Blair will be good for business. Blair re-thinks her decision to sacrifice it all for their relationship, and she and Chuck break up once again. Chuck promises he'll wait for her, and both affirm their belief that their love will reunite them in the end.\n\nOn Thanksgiving Chuck and Blair run into each other at Serena's house, Chuck offers to leave but she tells him that she was heading to JFK anyway and came to drop off the traditional pie and that they should get used to this. They hear about Serena being hospitalized and while they're sharing that maybe nothing can change between them, Jenny walks in and interrupts their conversation. While driving Blair home, Chuck tells her that he showed up only for Serena. When she told him that what happened with Serena made her question what she told him after the Saints & Sinners party; Chuck tells her that he cannot be her friend now as much as he wishes he could. After that Blair still sends him her traditional pie, saying that even if they can't be friends it doesn't mean that they aren't.\n\nIn \"The Townie\" episode, It was revealed that Lily was going to sell Bass Industries instead of giving Chuck the company back. So he sets off to New Zealand, where his uncle Jack Bass is currently living. In the following episodes Chuck returns to the Upper East Side with revenge for Lily. Chuck's new love interest is Raina and her father is Russell Thorpe, a former rival of Chuck's late father Bart Bass. Russell is the main contender to buy Bass industries. Chuck, however, manages to save the company after it is revealed that Russell accidentally killed his wife in a building fire that Bart was originally accused of.\n\nIn \"The Princess and the Frog\" he learns that Blair's relationship with Louis is serious, and that there is talk about them getting engaged. He gets drunk and embarrasses Blair in front of Louis' mother, and later tries to force himself on her, while pushing her down and smashing a glass window right next to her face, after she tells him about her engagement. Blair ends up with her cheek being cut.\n\nLater, Blair is kidnapped by Russell, but Chuck saves her, and the two go to a Bar Mitzah. There, the two are seen dancing and smiling happily. Blair pulls him off the dance floor into a private room and the two have sex. Blair decides she is going to leave Louis, but Chuck stops her, telling her that she needs to be with Louis because he makes her happy. At the end of the episode, Chuck decides to spend the summer traveling with Nate.\n\n====Controversy====\n{{further|Blair Waldorf#Controversy}}\nFollowing the 20th episode of Season 4, Safran spoke on behalf of the series regarding the scene in which Chuck became violent with Blair.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jennifer |last=Arrow |coauthors= |title=''Gossip Girl'' Boss: \"Chuck Has Never, and Will Never, Hurt Blair\" |work=[[E!]] Online |page= |date=May 3, 2011 |accessdate= May 10, 2011 |quote= |url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b239902_gossip_girl_boss_chuck_has_never_will.html}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The way we viewed it, I think it's very clear that Blair is not afraid in those moments, for herself. They have a volatile relationship, they always have, but I do not believe\u2014or I should say we do not believe\u2014that it is abuse when it's the two of them. Chuck does not try to hurt Blair. He punches the glass because he has rage, but he has never, and will never, hurt Blair. He knows it and she knows it, and I feel it's very important to know that she is not scared\u2014if anything, she is scared for Chuck\u2014and what he might do to himself, but she is never afraid of what he might do to her. Leighton and I were very clear about that.}}\n\n===Season 5===\nIn the first episode of season 5, we find out that Chuck has spent his summer traveling the world with Nate. The two arrive in Los Angeles to meet up with Serena, who is working as an assistant on a film set. Seemingly over his break up with Blair, Chuck exhibits a positive outlook on life, telling Serena and Nate that he's seeking to experience everything he can in life. However, his heartbreak soon becomes apparent when he receives an invitation to Blair's upcoming wedding, which causes him to drive recklessly and get into a motorbike accident. In the following episode, it is revealed that Chuck has an emotional disorder as a result of his losing Blair, and which now causes him to be numb to physical and emotional stimuli. Dan decides to help Chuck break through this emotional barrier, and gets him a dog, hoping to spark some emotion. However, it is only when Blair reveals to him that she is pregnant with Louis's baby does Chuck begin feel again \u2013 he is shown crying over the revelation at the end of the episode. He names the dog \"Monkey\" (a homage to the pet monkey Chuck's character had in the books). He forms a reluctant friendship with Dan from here on.\n\nHe meets a psychiatrist, Eliza Barnes, who tells him that he acts out because he never had a childhood, and needs help. When he finds himself falling back into his old patterns, he calls Dr. Barnes, ready to seek that help. However, it is revealed that Blair's fianc\u00e9, Louis, gives Dr. Barnes money to upset Chuck, in hopes that he will do something reckless and drive Blair away forever. When Chuck finds this out, he publicly exposes both Dr. Barnes and Louis, leaving Blair devastated. Later that same night, he goes to Blair's apartment to finally apologize to her for all the times he's hurt her and let her down. His apology recounts all the obstacles Chuck and Blair have faced in their relationship thus far, and prompts an emotional Blair to thank him. Chuck assures her that she is going to be \"an amazing mother\", having come to terms with her relationship with Louis.\n\nHe resolves to keep his distance from her after that, but in \"The Big Sleep No More\", a conflicted Blair seduces him in the hope to prove that his efforts to be a better man is just a ploy to win her back. When he kisses her, she slaps him, and tells him that he will never change. It is later revealed that he conspired with Dorota and kissed Blair in order to confirm her suspicions of him, and push her back to Louis. In the episode \"Riding in Town Cars with Boys\" he admits to Blair that he still loves her. They profess their love for one another in Chuck's limo. This occurs whilst the limo is being chased by paparazzi on motorbikes and results in a car crash. Lily reveals at the conclusion of the episode that Blair is awake and doing fine, but whether or not Chuck has survived was not revealed.\n\nWe later discover that Chuck did indeed survive the accident after a blood transfusion was donated to him. He wakes up to a very distant Blair, very opposite to the one he got into an accident with. For the next few episodes he chases her to discover what has changed her mind \u2013 unbeknownst to him, Blair has made a pact with God over his life, where if she breaks her promise to Louis, Chuck will surely die. This leads to Blair going to Chuck's penthouse in the episode \"The End of the Affair\" where she tells him what a good man he has become and to not let the ending of their relationship destroy him.\n\nIn [[G.G. (Gossip Girl)|G.G.]], Chuck is willing to accept the fact that Blair is marrying another man, when Blair's mother tries to convince him to stop the wedding. He makes one final play for Blair, but Blair \u2013 despite saying that she \"loves him more and more every day, if it's even possible to love somebody that much\" \u2013 once more rebuffs him, saying that she's actually doing this for him. Their conversation is unknowingly recorded, and released in a blast by Gossip Girl during the wedding. Despite this, Blair still marries Louis, but flees the reception with Dan when Louis reveals that their relationship is now strictly business.\n\nWith the help of Dan, Blair tries to leave for the Dominican Republic to get a divorce from Louis without his consent due to a loophole in the Dominican Republic's law, but forgets her passport. Chuck, Nate and Serena eventually find Blair hiding out in a hotel room with Dan. However, Sophia finds Blair and threatens to forcefully sell Eleanor's company as dowry if Blair chooses not to return. Blair reluctantly goes back to Louis, despite an offer from Chuck to pay her dowry.\n\nIn \"Cross Rhodes\", Blair realizes she now has feelings for Dan, and Chuck and Serena struggle with watching their loves with their friends.\n\nIn \"The Princess Dowry\", Chuck pays Blair's dowry so she can be free, but wishes for it to remain a secret. She finds out and accuses him of wanting to own her. He admits that he paid the dowry, but for her freedom and her freedom only. At the end of the episode, Blair begins a relationship with Dan.\n\nIn \"Con Heir\", Chuck invites his uncle, Jack, back to New York to thank him for saving his life in the car accident by donating blood, but starts to doubt Jack's story when Chuck investigates and learns that Jack was recently diagnosed positive with Hepatitis C, and a test on Chuck turns to be negative. This kicks off a lot of \"mother/father\" issues for Chuck \u2013 he believes that it was Elizabeth Fisher who donated the blood, then Diana says that she is his mother when Bart cheated on Elizabeth with her (she claims that an arrangement was made with Diana leaving town alone, leaving Chuck to be raised by Bart and Elizabeth because Elizabeth couldn't get pregnant), but in \"Despicable B\", Nate receives a picture from Elizabeth that indeed shows her pregnant with Chuck. Chuck is more interested in the man in the picture with Elizabeth \u2013 his face is cut out, but his tattooed arm is still visible. Jack Bass has exactly the same tattoo.\n\nIt all comes to a head in \"Raiders of the Lost Art\", when he, Blair, Serena, Nate and Lola team together to crack the code in Diana's day planner \u2013 the code they believe will lead them to Jack Bass. They end up at a brothel that Diana is in charge of. Diana realizes that they are there and has the event shut down. During the chaos, Blair searches one of the rooms, still looking for Jack, and is shocked by what she sees. Blair later tells Chuck to re-enter the building once everyone is gone, which he does, and it is revealed that Bart Bass is still alive.\n\nBart reveals that he faked his death to save Chuck and Lily, and has been hiding from everyone for the past three years. The car crash actually happened, and that it was ordered by one of Bart's enemies. When he was in the hospital, he paid the doctor to say he died and then recruited Diana Payne to help him hide. Diana kept Bart informed of when Chuck was in trouble, so when Chuck was in the hospital, Bart was the one who donated his blood to save Chuck.\n\nIn \"The Return of the Ring\", Bart drops the bombshell that he will be returning to Bass Industries as \"the only Bass in Bass Industries\", pushing Chuck out of the company. Bart tells Chuck that the most he did was 'redecorate' and give everything up for Blair. After this, Blair declares her love for Chuck, admitting she finally really wants them to be together. Chuck rejects her in anger, shadowing the words she once said to him: \"I don't want to be Mr. Blair Waldorf.\"\n\nChuck pairs up with an unlikely partner \u2013 Jack \u2013 to take down his father. They meet in a casino in Monte Carlo. Blair turns up, informed by Jack of Chuck's whereabouts. Blair reveals she is 'all in' and one hundred per cent ready to be with him. His decision on the matter is thus far unknown.\n\n===Season 6===\nAt the beginning of the season Chuck and Blair make a pact not to be together until Blair succeeds at Waldorf Designs and Chuck takes down Bart. After many failed attempts of taking down Bart, Bart and Chuck end up in a fight. This leads to Bart falling off a building and dying. Blair is the only witness to this event and so Chuck and Blair get married so Blair does not have to testify against Chuck.\n\nIn the 5-year flash forward, Chuck and Blair are happily married with a son (Henry). They are all gathered at the Bass house for Dan and Serena's wedding.\n\n==Characterization==\n[[Ed Westwick]] who portrays the character on the television series said: \"As the [first] season's progressed, I think everyone's had sympathy for him. I think he's an alluring character; he's very interesting. He has these slices of his personality. He can be the devil, but at times he can be very charming. It can be a very dangerous concoction.
