It took place on the weekend of 25\u201327 July 2003 at the [[Sachsenring]].\n\n==MotoGP race report==\n\nThis race was most notable for the titanic battle between Valentino Rossi and Sete Gibernau, with the Spaniard narrowly winning after a dramatic finale.\n\nValentino Rossi leads the standings with 187 points, followed by Sete Gibernau with 158 and Max Biaggi with 130 points.\n\n[[Max Biaggi]] took pole position on Saturday - his second of the season - with [[Jeremy McWilliams]] only +0.002 seconds behind him in second. [[Loris Capirossi]] lined up third and [[Valentino Rossi]] in fourth, who suffered from a cold as well as tyre problems. [[Sete Gibernau]] took fifth place, with [[Troy Bayliss]] lining up in sixth, [[Carlos Checa]] in seventh and [[Tohru Ukawa]] in eighth place. [[Chris Burns (motorcyclist|Chris Burns]] will not be taking part in the race, after being declared unfit due to his collarbone fracture after a crash in the previous [[2003 British motorcycle Grand Prix|British]] race two weeks ago.\n\nThe pack make their way back to their respective starting positions and as the lights go out, Rossi makes a great start and moves up into the lead at Turn 1, followed by the two Ducati's of Capirossi and Bayliss. Gibernau moved up one spot to take fourth, Melandri moved from twelfth to fifth and McWilliams and pole sitter Biaggi made terrible starts, dropping from second to sixth and from first to ninth. At Turn 13, Gibernau dives down the inside of Bayliss to take third from him. [[Olivier Jacque]] did likewise and overtook both Biaggi and [[Nobuatsu Aoki]] by going side-by-side with them at the short straight before Turn 13, finalising the move at the entrance after Biaggi went wide.\n\nAs lap two begins, Bayliss tries to use the superior Ducati top speed to pass Gibernau at the start/finish straight, almost bumping into him as a result. He isn't able to finalise the move and stays behind for the time being. The top six is as follows: Rossi, Capirossi, Gibernau, Bayliss, Melandri and McWilliams. Going down into Turn 1, Melandri takes fourth by going up his inside at the end of the start/finish straight. Jacque has also made up ten places on the opening lap, going from eighteenth to eighth place. Rossi opens up a gap to Capirossi during the lap. Rossi's teammate and rookie [[Nicky Hayden]] tries to pass Aoki at Turn 14 but runs the bike too deep, allowing the Japanese rider to make the cutback and retake twelfth position.\n\nLap three and Bayliss has a big moment as he brakes for Turn 1, almost going sideways as a result. Gibernau and Melandri put some serious pressure on Capirossi, who is struggling a bit. Just as Gibernau makes his move going down at the short straight before Turn 13, Melandri does the same, overtaking both Gibernau and Capirossi and moving from fourth to second, with Gibernau also taking third from Capirossi. Gibernau then takes second at the braking zone at Turn 14, moving up into second place as a result.\n\nAs lap four begins, Melandri goes side-by-side with Gibernau, taking second back from the Spaniard after he outbraked him. Right behind the duo, Bayliss closes up and tries to take fourth place from his teammate Capirossi around the outside of Turn 1, but goes wide and has to slow back behind him. This fighting has allowed Rossi to ride away, creating a huge gap to the second rider. Gibernau is still all over the back of Melandri, with the Telef\u00f3nica Movistar Honda rider overtaking Melandri at the left-hand kink at Turn 9 for second. Biaggi meanwhile has passed Jacque for eighth place further back, then taking McWilliams for seventh before the entrance of Turn 13. At Turn 14, Bayliss overtakes Capirossi and moves up into fourth position as he goes down his inside.\n\nOn lap five, Melandri slowly starts to ride away from Melandri. Biaggi - who has been slowly making up the lost ground - is now right behind his Camel Pramac Pons teammate Ukawa and overtakes him at the fast right-handed Turn 12 effortlessly, moving him up to sixth. Bayliss also takes third spot from Melandri by going up his inside at Turn 14.\n\nLap six and Melandri tries to get back at the Australian by trying a very late lunge down his inside, only narrowly avoiding the Ducati rider as they go down into Turn 1. Exiting Turn 4, it looks like Melandri managed to grab the position back, but Bayliss still managed to stay in front after he went a bit wide. Biaggi also takes fifth position from Capirossi at Turn 13. Hayden passes McWilliams for eleventh at Turn 14 by going up the inside of the Northern Irishman before the climb back up to the start/finish straight.\n\nOn lap seven, Biaggi quickly catches up to Melandri. He takes third from him as he outbreaks the Italian going into Turn 13.\n\nGoing into lap eight, Rossi leads Gibernau by +1.827 seconds. Going into the fast Turn 12, Gibernau had a bit of a wobble but no harm is done. No overtakes happen at the front.\n\nLap nine and the top six is as follows: Rossi, Gibernau, Bayliss, Biaggi, Melandri and Capirossi. [[Noriyuki Haga]] has crashed out at the last corner on the last lap, his bike losing grip going into Turn 14 and sliding out of contention at high speed. The Japanese rider is then seen running onto the track in a dangerous manner, with one of the marshalls trying to stop him but failing to do so. Biaggi meanwhile is closing up on Bayliss at the front.\n\nOn lap ten, Biaggi has caught Bayliss for third but is unable to make a move so far.\n\nLap eleven and the gap Gibernau has to Rossi has been brought down - from +1.827 seconds on lap eight to +1.495 at the beginning of this lap. Biaggi tries to pass Bayliss by going side-by-side at the straight before Turn 13, then it looked like he had passed him but the Italian ran a bit too wide, allowing Bayliss to dive down the inside at the uphill Turn 14, blocking his way and retaking third place.\n\nAs lap twelve starts, Biaggi is still trying to get past Bayliss. At Turn 1, he takes a much shorter inside line and goes side-by-side with Bayliss exiting the turn, but still doesn't finalise the move going into Turn 2. Biaggi is still hounding the Australian all throughout the lap.\n\nOn lap thirteen, Biaggi tries the same move down at Turn 1 but still isn't able to get through. At Turn 4 however, Bayliss goes a bit wide, with the Italian now finally able to pass him by going down his inside, taking third spot from Bayliss.\n\nLap fourteen and Gibernau is slowly starting to catch Rossi, with the gap on the last lap being +1.165 seconds. At the fast Turn 9, Biaggi loses his bike and crashes out by sliding into the gravel, ending his good comeback. Distraught, he walks off as the marshalls remove the bike from the gravel. This now means that Bayliss has pretty much secured third position. The gap to Rossi has meanwhile been shrinking and is now only +0.873 seconds.\n\nOn lap fifteen, Melandri is now forming a train behind him consisting of Capirossi, Checa, Ukawa and - further back - Hayden. Gauloises Yamaha rider [[Alex Barros]] is out of the race, crashing out at the end of Turn 1 after fighting with McWilliams for tenth place. The rider is unhurt and walks away in a dissapointing manner. At Turn 13, Ukawa tries to make a move but isn't able to but with Checa going wide, he can get side-by-side with the Spaniard, positioning his Camel Pramac Pons Honda at his inside at Turn 14 and making the move, moving up to sixth place.\n\nAs lap sixteen begins, Hayden is now eyeing Checa as well. He looks to be making a move at Turn 1 but instead stays behind for now. At the front, the gap Gibernau has to Rossi has decreased even further and is now only +0.478, which then increases to +0.480 seconds.\n\nLap seventeen and the gap to Rossi has increased to +0.706, then decreased again to +0.621 seconds.\n\nOn lap eighteen, the gap is once again cut and now is only +0.591 seconds, then decreasing again slightly to +0.511 seconds. \n\nLap nineteen and Gibernau just puts the fastest lap of the race with a 1:24.8. The gap is +0.364 seconds but halfway into the lap, he has caught Rossi and is all over the back of him.\n\nAs lap twenty begins, the Spaniard goes side-by-side with the Repsol Honda rider, even looking at him as they blast down the start/finish straight, with Gibernau taking over the lead at the end of the straight. Rossi tries to fight back but eventually decides to stay behind in second position. Rossi then shadows Gibernau for half the lap, then tries to dive down the inside at Turn 13 with the Spaniard closing the door on him.\n\nOn lap twenty-one, Rossi is still all over the back of Gibernau but does not try to make a move. Both riders now start to slide around a bit as the tyres start to wear off.\n\nLap twenty-two and Rossi looks to be making a move at the downhill Turn 1 hairpin, but thinks better of it and stays behind Gibernau. The Italian is still shadowing Gibernau, mayble trying to pressure him into a mistake.\n\nOn lap twenty-three, Rossi is still right behind Gibernau, eyeing him but not making a move yet.\n\nLap twenty-four and the top six is now as follows: Gibernau, Rossi, Bayliss, Capirossi, Hayden and Ukawa. The top two encounter some backmarkers - who get out of the way causing no problems and Melandri has also crashed out from fourth place. Suzuki Grand Prix Team rider [[John Hopkins (motorcyclist)|John Hopkins]] is also standing still in the gravel due to engine problems, coming to a standstill in the gravel in a cloud of expensive smoke.\n\nOn lap twenty-five, Hayden is catching the Marlboro Ducati of Capirossi in fourth position, with Ukawa being a distant sixth. The duo up front is still very close to each other, Rossi eyeing Gibernau as both begin to slide around the circuit. Rossi looks to be making a move at Turn 13 but still does not finalise it and sticks behind Gibernau.\n\nLap twenty-six and no overtakes happened at the front. Rossi is still right on the tail of Gibernau, shadowing his every move.\n\nOn lap twenty-seven, the top six is as follows: Gibernau, Rossi, Bayliss, Capirossi, Hayden and Ukawa. Rossi is still eyeing Gibernau, looking up his inside at Turn 9 but still staying behind.\n\nLap twenty-eight - the penultimate lap - and Rossi is still waiting for the right moment to pass. He's all over the back of Gibernau, but still does not make a move.\n\nOn the final lap - lap twenty-nine - Gibernau opens a slight gap to Rossi at the start/finish straight after the Italian made a small error exiting Turn 14. Rossi however almost immediatly catches back up to him and, after a lot of waiting lap after lap, he finally overtakes Gibernau exiting Turn 12, going side-by-side with him at the straight and finalising the pass going into Turn 13. Many thought that Rossi had secured the race win, but as he closed off the inside to prevent Gibernau from making a final move, the Spaniard instead took a very wide line going into Turn 14. Using the superior traction and exit speed, he blasted past Rossi - just enough to win the race by a mere +0.060 seconds. Just as Rossi wanted to start the celebrations, he sees that Gibernau pipped him on the line, with the Spaniard erupting into joy as he just realised he won the race, with his pit wall doing likewise. Bayliss came home in a lonely third, doing a wheelie in the process, Capirossi in fourth, Hayden in fifth and Ukawa in sixth. This win was Gibernau's fourth and last of the season, and Rossi's second place now meant that he has a winless streak of four races.\n\nOn the parade lap back to parc-ferm\u00e9, he stops at the edge of the track next to the pits, with two of his pit crew members coming up to him to celebrate his victory. The Repsol Honda pitwall meanwhile, looked on in disbelief as to what just happened. As Gibernau celebrates in absolute glee, Rossi is unhappy and does not wave at the celebrating marshalls or the crowd, choosing to immediatly ride back to parc-ferm\u00e9. \n\nAt parc-ferm\u00e9, Bayliss gets a hug from one of the Ducati crewmembers, with a dissapointed Rossi looking down and probably thinking to himself what just happened. As Gibernau arrives, he gets a lot of hugs from his team as he celebrates on, still hardly believing he just beat Rossi. Bayliss is already being interviewed by the press meanwhile.\n\nThe trio is announced, with Troy Bayliss the first to step onto the podium, followed by a bitterly dissapointed Rossi and a jubilant Gibernau, with the audience applauding both Rossi and Gibernau. On the podium, Rossi shakes hands with Bayliss, with Gibernau doing likewise to Rossi and Bayliss as he comes onto it.\n\nThe important figures hand out the trophies - with the fans of Gibernau wildly celebrating as he receives his trophy - and dedicates his victory to the Japanese rider [[Daijiro Kato]], who tragically passed away after a freak accident in the opening round in [[2003 Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix|Japan]]. The Spanish national anthem plays and the riders spray the champagne on the podium once the grid girls hand them the bottles, Rossi cheekily spraying one of the girls before spraying the rest of the podium finishers. The trio then bunches up for the group photo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpEzOjjEjgc |title=2003 #GermanGP &#124; Vintage MotoGP |publisher=YouTube |date=2020-04-03 |accessdate=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\nGibernau's win now meant that he's still alive in the championship hunt. Rossi still led with 187 points, followed by Gibernau with 158 and Max Biaggi with a now distant 130 points.\n\n==MotoGP classification==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

It took place on the weekend of 25\u201327 July 2003 at the [[Sachsenring]].\n\n==MotoGP race report==\n\nThis race was most notable for the titanic battle between Valentino Rossi and Sete Gibernau, with the Spaniard narrowly winning after a dramatic finale.\n\nValentino Rossi leads the standings with 187 points, followed by Sete Gibernau with 158 and Max Biaggi with 130 points.\n\n[[Max Biaggi]] took pole position on Saturday - his second of the season - with [[Jeremy McWilliams]] only +0.002 seconds behind him in second. [[Loris Capirossi]] lined up third and [[Valentino Rossi]] in fourth, who suffered from a cold as well as tyre problems. [[Sete Gibernau]] took fifth place, with [[Troy Bayliss]] lining up in sixth, [[Carlos Checa]] in seventh and [[Tohru Ukawa]] in eighth place. [[Chris Burns (motorcyclist|Chris Burns]] will not be taking part in the race, after being declared unfit due to his collarbone fracture after a crash in the previous [[2003 British motorcycle Grand Prix|British]] race two weeks ago.\n\nThe pack make their way back to their respective starting positions and as the lights go out, Rossi makes a great start and moves up into the lead at Turn 1, followed by the two Ducati's of Capirossi and Bayliss. Gibernau moved up one spot to take fourth, Melandri moved from twelfth to fifth and McWilliams and pole sitter Biaggi made terrible starts, dropping from second to sixth and from first to ninth. At Turn 13, Gibernau dives down the inside of Bayliss to take third from him. [[Olivier Jacque]] did likewise and overtook both Biaggi and [[Nobuatsu Aoki]] by going side-by-side with them at the short straight before Turn 13, finalising the move at the entrance after Biaggi went wide.\n\nAs lap two begins, Bayliss tries to use the superior Ducati top speed to pass Gibernau at the start/finish straight, almost bumping into him as a result. He isn't able to finalise the move and stays behind for the time being. The top six is as follows: Rossi, Capirossi, Gibernau, Bayliss, Melandri and McWilliams. Going down into Turn 1, Melandri takes fourth by going up his inside at the end of the start/finish straight. Jacque has also made up ten places on the opening lap, going from eighteenth to eighth place. Rossi opens up a gap to Capirossi during the lap. Rossi's teammate and rookie [[Nicky Hayden]] tries to pass Aoki at Turn 14 but runs the bike too deep, allowing the Japanese rider to make the cutback and retake twelfth position.\n\nLap three and Bayliss has a big moment as he brakes for Turn 1, almost going sideways as a result. Gibernau and Melandri put some serious pressure on Capirossi, who is struggling a bit. Just as Gibernau makes his move going down at the short straight before Turn 13, Melandri does the same, overtaking both Gibernau and Capirossi and moving from fourth to second, with Gibernau also taking third from Capirossi. Gibernau then takes second at the braking zone at Turn 14, moving up into second place as a result.\n\nAs lap four begins, Melandri goes side-by-side with Gibernau, taking second back from the Spaniard after he outbraked him. Right behind the duo, Bayliss closes up and tries to take fourth place from his teammate Capirossi around the outside of Turn 1, but goes wide and has to slow back behind him. This fighting has allowed Rossi to ride away, creating a huge gap to the second rider. Gibernau is still all over the back of Melandri, with the Telef\u00f3nica Movistar Honda rider overtaking Melandri at the left-hand kink at Turn 9 for second. Biaggi meanwhile has passed Jacque for eighth place further back, then taking McWilliams for seventh before the entrance of Turn 13. At Turn 14, Bayliss overtakes Capirossi and moves up into fourth position as he goes down his inside.\n\nOn lap five, Melandri slowly starts to ride away from Melandri. Biaggi - who has been slowly making up the lost ground - is now right behind his Camel Pramac Pons teammate Ukawa and overtakes him at the fast right-handed Turn 12 effortlessly, moving him up to sixth. Bayliss also takes third spot from Melandri by going up his inside at Turn 14.\n\nLap six and Melandri tries to get back at the Australian by trying a very late lunge down his inside, only narrowly avoiding the Ducati rider as they go down into Turn 1. Exiting Turn 4, it looks like Melandri managed to grab the position back, but Bayliss still managed to stay in front after he went a bit wide. Biaggi also takes fifth position from Capirossi at Turn 13. Hayden passes McWilliams for eleventh at Turn 14 by going up the inside of the Northern Irishman before the climb back up to the start/finish straight.\n\nOn lap seven, Biaggi quickly catches up to Melandri. He takes third from him as he outbreaks the Italian going into Turn 13.\n\nGoing into lap eight, Rossi leads Gibernau by +1.827 seconds. Going into the fast Turn 12, Gibernau had a bit of a wobble but no harm is done. No overtakes happen at the front.\n\nLap nine and the top six is as follows: Rossi, Gibernau, Bayliss, Biaggi, Melandri and Capirossi. [[Noriyuki Haga]] has crashed out at the last corner on the last lap, his bike losing grip going into Turn 14 and sliding out of contention at high speed. The Japanese rider is then seen running onto the track in a dangerous manner, with one of the marshalls trying to stop him but failing to do so. Biaggi meanwhile is closing up on Bayliss at the front.\n\nOn lap ten, Biaggi has caught Bayliss for third but is unable to make a move so far.\n\nLap eleven and the gap Gibernau has to Rossi has been brought down - from +1.827 seconds on lap eight to +1.495 at the beginning of this lap. Biaggi tries to pass Bayliss by going side-by-side at the straight before Turn 13, then it looked like he had passed him but the Italian ran a bit too wide, allowing Bayliss to dive down the inside at the uphill Turn 14, blocking his way and retaking third place.\n\nAs lap twelve starts, Biaggi is still trying to get past Bayliss. At Turn 1, he takes a much shorter inside line and goes side-by-side with Bayliss exiting the turn, but still doesn't finalise the move going into Turn 2. Biaggi is still hounding the Australian all throughout the lap.\n\nOn lap thirteen, Biaggi tries the same move down at Turn 1 but still isn't able to get through. At Turn 4 however, Bayliss goes a bit wide, with the Italian now finally able to pass him by going down his inside, taking third spot from Bayliss.\n\nLap fourteen and Gibernau is slowly starting to catch Rossi, with the gap on the last lap being +1.165 seconds. At the fast Turn 9, Biaggi loses his bike and crashes out by sliding into the gravel, ending his good comeback. Distraught, he walks off as the marshalls remove the bike from the gravel. This now means that Bayliss has pretty much secured third position. The gap to Rossi has meanwhile been shrinking and is now only +0.873 seconds.\n\nOn lap fifteen, Melandri is now forming a train behind him consisting of Capirossi, Checa, Ukawa and - further back - Hayden. Gauloises Yamaha rider [[Alex Barros]] is out of the race, crashing out at the end of Turn 1 after fighting with McWilliams for tenth place. The rider is unhurt and walks away in a dissapointing manner. At Turn 13, Ukawa tries to make a move but isn't able to but with Checa going wide, he can get side-by-side with the Spaniard, positioning his Camel Pramac Pons Honda at his inside at Turn 14 and making the move, moving up to sixth place.\n\nAs lap sixteen begins, Hayden is now eyeing Checa as well. He looks to be making a move at Turn 1 but instead stays behind for now. At the front, the gap Gibernau has to Rossi has decreased even further and is now only +0.478, which then increases to +0.480 seconds.\n\nLap seventeen and the gap to Rossi has increased to +0.706, then decreased again to +0.621 seconds.\n\nOn lap eighteen, the gap is once again cut and now is only +0.591 seconds, then decreasing again slightly to +0.511 seconds. \n\nLap nineteen and Gibernau just puts the fastest lap of the race with a 1:24.8. The gap is +0.364 seconds but halfway into the lap, he has caught Rossi and is all over the back of him.\n\nAs lap twenty begins, the Spaniard goes side-by-side with the Repsol Honda rider, even looking at him as they blast down the start/finish straight, with Gibernau taking over the lead at the end of the straight. Rossi tries to fight back but eventually decides to stay behind in second position. Rossi then shadows Gibernau for half the lap, then tries to dive down the inside at Turn 13 with the Spaniard closing the door on him.\n\nOn lap twenty-one, Rossi is still all over the back of Gibernau but does not try to make a move. Both riders now start to slide around a bit as the tyres start to wear off.\n\nLap twenty-two and Rossi looks to be making a move at the downhill Turn 1 hairpin, but thinks better of it and stays behind Gibernau. The Italian is still shadowing Gibernau, mayble trying to pressure him into a mistake.\n\nOn lap twenty-three, Rossi is still right behind Gibernau, eyeing him but not making a move yet.\n\nLap twenty-four and the top six is now as follows: Gibernau, Rossi, Bayliss, Capirossi, Hayden and Ukawa. The top two encounter some backmarkers - who get out of the way causing no problems and Melandri has also crashed out from fourth place. Suzuki Grand Prix Team rider [[John Hopkins (motorcyclist)|John Hopkins]] is also standing still in the gravel due to engine problems, coming to a standstill in the gravel in a cloud of expensive smoke.\n\nOn lap twenty-five, Hayden is catching the Marlboro Ducati of Capirossi in fourth position, with Ukawa being a distant sixth. The duo up front is still very close to each other, Rossi eyeing Gibernau as both begin to slide around the circuit. Rossi looks to be making a move at Turn 13 but still does not finalise it and sticks behind Gibernau.\n\nLap twenty-six and no overtakes happened at the front. Rossi is still right on the tail of Gibernau, shadowing his every move.\n\nOn lap twenty-seven, the top six is as follows: Gibernau, Rossi, Bayliss, Capirossi, Hayden and Ukawa. Rossi is still eyeing Gibernau, looking up his inside at Turn 9 but still staying behind.\n\nLap twenty-eight - the penultimate lap - and Rossi is still waiting for the right moment to pass. He's all over the back of Gibernau, but still does not make a move.\n\nOn the final lap - lap twenty-nine - Gibernau opens a slight gap to Rossi at the start/finish straight after the Italian made a small error exiting Turn 14. Rossi however almost immediatly catches back up to him and, after a lot of waiting lap after lap, he finally overtakes Gibernau exiting Turn 12, going side-by-side with him at the straight and finalising the pass going into Turn 13. Many thought that Rossi had secured the race win, but as he closed off the inside to prevent Gibernau from making a final move, the Spaniard instead took a very wide line going into Turn 14. Using the superior traction and exit speed, he blasted past Rossi - just enough to win the race by a mere +0.060 seconds. Just as Rossi wanted to start the celebrations, he sees that Gibernau pipped him on the line, with the Spaniard erupting into joy as he just realised he won the race, with his pit wall doing likewise. Bayliss came home in a lonely third, doing a wheelie in the process, Capirossi in fourth, Hayden in fifth and Ukawa in sixth. This win was Gibernau's fourth and last of the season, and Rossi's second place now meant that he has a winless streak of four races.\n\nOn the parade lap back to parc-ferm\u00e9, he stops at the edge of the track next to the pits, with two of his pit crew members coming up to him to celebrate his victory. The Repsol Honda pitwall meanwhile, looked on in disbelief as to what just happened. As Gibernau celebrates in absolute glee, Rossi is unhappy and does not wave at the celebrating marshalls or the crowd, choosing to immediatly ride back to parc-ferm\u00e9. \n\nAt parc-ferm\u00e9, Bayliss gets a hug from one of the Ducati crewmembers, with a dissapointed Rossi looking down and probably thinking to himself what just happened. As Gibernau arrives, he gets a lot of hugs from his team as he celebrates on, still hardly believing he just beat Rossi. Bayliss is already being interviewed by the press meanwhile.\n\nThe trio is announced, with Troy Bayliss the first to step onto the podium, followed by a bitterly dissapointed Rossi and a jubilant Gibernau, with the audience applauding both Rossi and Gibernau. On the podium, Rossi shakes hands with Bayliss, with Gibernau doing likewise to Rossi and Bayliss as he comes onto it.\n\nThe important figures hand out the trophies - with the fans of Gibernau wildly celebrating as he receives his trophy - and dedicates his victory to the Japanese rider [[Daijiro Kato]], who tragically passed away after a freak accident in the opening round in [[2003 Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix|Japan]]. The Spanish national anthem plays and the riders spray the champagne on the podium once the grid girls hand them the bottles, Rossi cheekily spraying one of the girls before spraying the rest of the podium finishers. The trio then bunches up for the group photo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpEzOjjEjgc |title=2003 #GermanGP &#124; Vintage MotoGP |publisher=YouTube |date=2020-04-03 |accessdate=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\nGibernau's win now meant that he's still alive in the championship hunt. Rossi still leads with 187 points, followed by Gibernau with 158 and and Max Biaggi with a now distant 130 points.\n\n==MotoGP classification==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

They were investigating the burning of Mt. Zion Methodist Church, which had been a site for a CORE Freedom School. In the wake of Schwerner and Chaney's voter registration rallies, parishioners had been beaten by whites. They accused the Sheriff's Deputy, [[Cecil Price]], of stopping their caravan and forcing the deacons to kneel in the headlights of their own cars, while white men beat them with rifle butts. The same whites who beat them were also identified as having burned the church.\n\nPrice arrested Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner for an alleged traffic violation and took them to the Neshoba County jail. They were released that evening, without being allowed to telephone anyone. On the way back to Meridian, they were stopped by patrol lights and two carloads of KKK members on Highway 19, then taken in Price's car to another remote rural road. The men approached then shot and killed Schwerner, then Goodman, both with one shot in the heart and finally Chaney with three shots, after chain-whipping and castrating him. They buried the young men in an earthen dam nearby.\n\nThe men's bodies remained undiscovered for 44 days. The [[FBI]] was brought into the case by John Doar, the [[U.S. Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] representative in Mississippi monitoring the situation during Freedom Summer. The missing civil rights workers became a major national story, especially coming on top of other events as civil rights workers were active across Mississippi in a voter registration drive.\n\nSchwerner's widow Rita, who also worked for CORE in Meridian, expressed indignation that the press had ignored previous murders and disappearances of blacks in the area, but had highlighted this case because two white men from New York had gone missing. She said she believed that if only Chaney were missing, the case would not have received nearly as much attention.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgSitIXiP5Y&t=25m36s |publisher=YouTube| title=Eyes on the Prize: Mississippi: Is This America? |title-link=Eyes on the Prize }}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath for family==\nAfter the funeral of their older son, the Chaneys left Mississippi because of death threats.

They were investigating the burning of Mt. Zion Methodist Church, which had been a site for a CORE Freedom School. In the wake of Schwerner and Chaney's voter registration rallies, parishioners had been beaten by whites. They accused the Sheriff's Deputy, [[Cecil Price]], of stopping their caravan and forcing the deacons to kneel in the headlights of their own cars, while white men beat them with rifle butts. The same whites who beat them were also identified as having burned the church.\n\nPrice arrested Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner for an alleged traffic violation and took them to the Neshoba County jail. They were released that evening, without being allowed to telephone anyone. On the way back to Meridian, they were stopped by patrol lights and two carloads of KKK members on Highway 19, then taken in Price's car to another remote rural road. The men approached then shot and killed Schwerner, then Goodman, both with one shot in the heart and finally Chaney with three shots, after chain-whipping and castrating him. They buried the young men in an earthen dam nearby.\n\nThe men's bodies remained undiscovered for 44 days. The [[FBI]] was brought into the case by John Doar, the [[U.S. Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] representative in Mississippi monitoring the situation during Freedom Summer. The missing civil rights workers became a major national story, especially coming on top of other events as civil rights workers were active across Mississippi in a voter registration drive.\n\nSchwerner's widow Rita, who also worked for CORE in Meridian, expressed indignation that the press had ignored previous murders and disappearances of blacks in the area, but had highlighted this case because two white men from New York had gone missing. She said she believed that if only Chaney were missing, the case would not have received nearly as much attention.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgSitIXiP5Y&t=25m36s |publisher=YouTube| title=Eyes on the Prize: Mississippi: Is This America? |title-link=Eyes on the Prize }}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath for family==\nAfter the funeral of their older son, the Chaneys left Mississippi because of death threats. Helped by the Goodman and Schwerner families, and other supporters, they moved to New York City, where Chaney's younger brother Ben attended a private, majority-white high school.\n\nIn 1969, Ben joined the [[Black Panther Party]] and [[Black Liberation Army]].

Born in [[Ormond, Ontario|Ormond, Canada West]], he studied and practised law in [[Ottawa]] before he moved with his family to the [[North-West Territories]] in 1895. There, he began his political career, winning in his third attempt a seat in the [[North-West Legislative Assembly]]. In keeping with the territorial custom, Rutherford ran as an [[independent (politician)|independent]] but generally supported the territorial administration of Premier [[Frederick W.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;G. Haultain]]. At the federal level, however, Rutherford was a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]].\n\nIn 1905, Alberta Lieutenant Governor [[George Bulyea]] asked Rutherford to form the new province's first government. As premier, Rutherford's first task was to win a workable majority in the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], which he did in the [[1905 Alberta general election|1905 provincial election]]. His second was to provide the apparatus of provincial government, and his government established everything from [[speed limit]]s to a provincial court system. The legislature also controversially, and with Rutherford's support, selected [[Edmonton]] over rival [[Calgary]] as the provincial capital. Calgarians' bruised feelings were not salved when the government located the [[University of Alberta]], a project dear to the Premier's heart, in his hometown of [[Strathcona, Alberta|Strathcona]], just across the [[North Saskatchewan River]] from Edmonton.\n\nThe government was faced with labour unrest in the [[coal mining]] industry, which it resolved by establishing a commission to examine the problem. It also set up a provincial government telephone network ([[Alberta Government Telephones]]) at great expense, and tried to encourage the development of new railways.\n\nIt was in pursuit of the last objective that the Rutherford government found itself embroiled in scandal. Early in 1910, [[William Henry Cushing]]'s resignation as Minister of Public Works precipitated the [[Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal]], which turned many of Rutherford's Liberals against his government. Eventually, pressure from many party figures forced Rutherford to resign. He kept his seat in the legislature after resigning as premier, but he was defeated in the [[1913 Alberta general election|1913 election]] by [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]] [[Herbert Crawford]].\n\nAfter leaving politics, Rutherford continued his law practice and his involvement with a wide range of community groups. Most importantly, he became [[List of Chancellors of the University of Alberta|chancellor of the University of Alberta]], whose earlier founding had been a personal project, and stayed in that position until he died of a heart attack.\n\nA University of Alberta library, an Edmonton elementary school, and [[Jasper National Park]]'s [[Mount Rutherford]] are named in his honour. Additionally, his home, [[Rutherford House]], was opened as a museum in 1973.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Rutherford articling.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rutherford as an articled clerk, {{circa|1883}}]]Alexander Rutherford was born February 2, 1857, near [[Ormond, Ontario|Ormond, Canada West]], on his family's dairy farm.<ref name=\"Babcock 1\">Babcock 1</ref> His parents, James (1817&ndash;1891) and Elspet<ref name=\"pc205\" /> \"Elizabeth\" (1818&ndash;1901) Cameron Rutherford,<ref name=\"pc205\">Perry, Craig 2006, p. 205.</ref> had immigrated from [[Scotland]] two years previous.<ref name=\"Babcock 1\"/> They joined the [[Baptist Church]], and his father joined the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] and served for a time on the [[Osgoode, Ontario|Osgoode]] village council.<ref name=\"Babcock 1\"/> Rutherford attended public school locally and, after rejecting dairy farming as a vocation, enrolled in a [[Metcalfe, Ontario|Metcalfe]] high school.<ref name=\"Babcock 1\"/> After graduating in 1874, he attended the [[Canadian Literary Institute]], a Baptist college in [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]].<ref name=\"Babcock 1\"/> He graduated from there in 1876 and taught for a year in Osgoode.\n\nHe moved to [[Montreal]] to study arts and law at [[McGill University]].<ref name=\"Roome 4\">Roome 4</ref> He was awarded degrees in both in 1881, and joined the [[Ottawa]] law firm of Scott, McTavish and McCracken, where he was [[articled clerk|articled]] for four years under the tutelage of [[Richard William Scott]].<ref>Babcock 1\u20134</ref> Called to the Ontario bar in 1885, he became a junior partner in the firm of Hodkins, Kidd and Rutherford, with responsibility for its [[Kemptville, Ontario|Kemptville]] office for ten years.<ref name=\"Babcock 4\">Babcock 4</ref> He also established a moneylending business there.<ref name=\"Babcock 5\">Babcock 5</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, his social circle grew to include [[William Cameron Edwards]].<ref name=\"Babcock 4\"/> Through Edwards, Rutherford was introduced to the Birkett family, which included former [[Member of Parliament]] [[Thomas Birkett]].<ref name=\"Babcock 4\"/> Rutherford married Birkett's niece, Mattie Birkett, in December 1888.<ref name=\"Babcock 4\"/> The couple had three children: Cecil (born in 1890), Hazel (born in 1893),<ref name=\"Babcock 4\"/> and Marjorie (born in 1903 but died sixteen months later).<ref>Babcock 21\u201322</ref> Rutherford had a traditional view of gender roles and was happy to leave most childrearing responsibilities to his wife.<ref name=\"Roome 6\">Roome 6</ref>\n\n===Move west===\nIn November 1886 Rutherford visited the Canadian West for the first time, when he travelled to [[British Columbia]] to investigate the disappearance of his cousin.<ref name=\"Roome 5\">Roome 5</ref> The [[Rocky Mountains]] left a great impression on him, as did the coastal climate, which he found \"very agreeable\".<ref name=\"Roome 5\"/> He visited again in the summer of 1894, when he took the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] across the prairies.<ref name=\"Babcock 4\"/> Upon arriving in [[Strathcona, Alberta|South Edmonton]], he was excited by its growth potential and pleased to find that the dry air relieved his [[bronchitis]].<ref name=\"Babcock 4\"/> He resolved to settle there and did so one year later, bringing his reluctant wife and his children,<ref name=\"Roome 5\"/> who arrived by train June 10, 1895.<ref name=\"Babcock 5\"/> Within ten days of their arrival, Rutherford had opened a law office, purchased four lots of land, and contracted local builder Hugh McCurdy to build him a house.<ref name=\"Babcock 8\">Babcock 8</ref> In July, the family moved into their new four-room house, built on a single storey.<ref name=\"Babcock 8\"/> In 1896 Rutherford became the town's only lawyer, as his competition, Mervyn Mackenzie, had moved to [[Toronto]].<ref name=\"Babcock 5\"/>\n\n[[File:Alexander Rutherford 1895.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Rutherford around the time of his move West]]Rutherford quickly became deeply involved in the community. Among the roles he acquired during his first three years in the [[District of Alberta]] were president of the newly formed South Edmonton Football Club, secretary-treasurer of the South Edmonton School Board, president of the South Edmonton Athletic Association, vice president of the South Edmonton Literary Institute, auditor of the South Edmonton Agricultural Society, and worthy master of the Acacia Lodge, Ancient Free and Accepted [[freemasonry|Masons]].<ref name=\"Babcock 10\">Babcock 10</ref> He also became secretary of the Edmonton District Butter and Cheese Manufacturing Association.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> He was an early advocate for the incorporation of South Edmonton, hitherto an [[unincorporated community]]. When incorporation came in 1899, as the Town of [[Strathcona, Alberta|Strathcona]], Rutherford became the new town's secretary-treasurer after he had acted as returning officer in its first election.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/>\n\nThroughout that period, he practised law, from 1899 with [[Frederick C. Jamieson]], who later was elected as a [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]] member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]].<ref name=\"Babcock 15\">Babcock 15</ref> He employed single women as secretaries in an era that.erical workers were predominantly male, and he defended a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|First Nations person]] accused of murder when most lawyers refused such cases.<ref name=\"Babcock 15\"/> As their practice grew, he and Jamieson also engaged in [[credit (finance)|moneylending]].<ref name=\"Babcock 21\">Babcock 21</ref> Besides his law practice, Rutherford was a successful [[real estate]] investor, and he also owned an interest in [[gold mining]] equipment situated on the [[North Saskatchewan River]].<ref name=\"Babcock 16\">Babcock 16</ref>\n\n===Early political career===\nIn 1896, [[Frank Oliver (politician)|Frank Oliver]], who had represented [[Edmonton (N.W.T. electoral district)|Edmonton]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories]] since 1888, resigned to pursue a career in federal politics.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> Several Strathcona residents urged Rutherford to run for Oliver's old seat in the ensuing [[by-election]].<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> Though he was originally reluctant, he agreed to stand after a 300-signature [[petition]] urging his candidacy was presented to him.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> His only opponent was a former [[mayor of Edmonton]], [[Matthew McCauley (politician)|Matthew McCauley]], who, like Rutherford, ran as an [[independent (politician)|independent]].<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> Rutherford campaigned on a platform of improved roads, resource development, simplification of territorial ordinances, and (in what would become a theme of his political career) increased educational funding.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> McCauley won the election, but Rutherford received more than forty percent of the vote.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/>\n\n[[File:Rutherford family.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Rutherford family in 1898]]During the [[1898 Northwest Territories general election|1898 territorial election]], Rutherford again challenged the now-incumbent McCauley.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> His defeat of two years previous still fresh in his mind, his platform this time included a call for a [[redistribution (election)|redrawing]] of the territory's electoral boundaries. He believed that the current Edmonton [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] was [[gerrymander]]ed in McCauley's favour.<ref name=\"Babcock 11\">Babcock 11</ref> He also repeated his past calls for improved roads and advocated increased taxation on the railroads.<ref name=\"Babcock 11\"/> He pledged \"independent support\" for the nonpartisan administration of Premier [[Frederick Haultain]],<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> and he supported that administration's call for the creation of a [[Province of Buffalo|single province]] from the territories following the 1901 [[census]].<ref name=\"Babcock 11\"/> Rutherford criticized McCauley's past record, accusing him of silence on issues that were of concern to his constituents.<ref name=\"Babcock 11\"/> Despite this, McCauley won again but by a reduced margin.<ref name=\"Babcock 11\"/>\n\nRutherford was at last successful in the [[1902 Northwest Territories general election|1902 election]], when he ran in the newly-created riding of [[Strathcona (N.W.T. electoral district)|Strathcona]].<ref name=\"Babcock 19\">Babcock 19</ref> His 1902 platform was similar to his 1898 platform and supported Haultain, but he now supported a two-province integration of the [[Northwest Territories]] into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], rather than Haultain's preferred one-province approach, on the grounds that a single province would be so large as to be ungovernable.<ref name=\"Babcock 19\"/> It at first looked as though he would run unopposed; however, at the last minute, local lawyer Nelson D. Mills publicly accused Rutherford of being not a true independent, but a dyed-in-the-wool Haultain supporter, and announced that he would run against him.<ref name=\"Babcock 19\"/> Rutherford was supported by most of Strathcona's most prominent residents, including his law partner Jamieson and his future rival [[John R. Boyle]], and won an easy victory.<ref name=\"Babcock 19\"/>\n\nRutherford served in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories until Alberta became a province in 1905. During his tenure, he was elected deputy [[speaker (politics)|speaker]] and sat on standing committees for libraries, municipal law, and education.<ref name=\"Babcock 19\"/> His legislative efforts included successful attempts to extend the boundaries of the Town of Strathcona and to empower it to borrow for construction of public works.<ref name=\"Babcock 19\"/> He was considered a possible member of Haultain's [[Executive Council (Canada)|executive council]], likely in the post of Commissioner of Public Works, but the post instead went to [[George Bulyea]].<ref>Babcock 19\u201320</ref> He joined many of his fellow [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLA]]s in continuing to advocate for provincial status, finding that the limitations on a territory's means to raise revenue prevented the Northwest Territories from meeting its obligations.<ref name=\"Roome 7\">Roome 7</ref>\n\nThough Rutherford supported Haultain's vision of nonpartisan territorial administration, federally he was an avowed [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]]. In 1900, he was elected president of the Strathcona Liberal association, and was a delegate to the convention that nominated Oliver as the party's candidate in [[Alberta (Provisional District)|Alberta]] for the [[1900 Canadian federal election|1900 federal election]].<ref name=\"Babcock 16\"/> He subsequently campaigned for Oliver in his successful re-election attempt.<ref name=\"Babcock 16\"/> When the new federal constituency of [[Strathcona (electoral district)|Strathcona]] was formed in advance of the [[1904 Canadian federal election|1904 election]],<ref>Not to be confused with the territorial constituency of the same name, which Rutherford was then representing, or the provincial district, which he would later represent</ref> Rutherford was urged to accept the Liberal nomination but demurred.<ref name=\"Babcock 20\">Babcock 20</ref> [[Peter Talbot (politician)|Peter Talbot]] was selected instead and, supported by Rutherford, was elected.<ref name=\"Babcock 20\"/>\n\n===Selection as premier===\n[[File:1905albertacabinet.jpg|thumb|right|Rutherford and his cabinet]]\nIn February 1905, the federal government of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]] introduced legislation to create two new provinces ([[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]]) from the Northwest Territories.<ref name=\"Babcock 22\">Babcock 22</ref> Though Haultain wanted the new provinces to be governed on the same nonpartisan basis as the Territories had been, the Liberal Laurier was expected to recommend a Liberal to serve as [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant-Governor]], and the Lieutenant-Governor was expected to call on a Liberal to form the new province's first government.<ref name=\"Thomas 15\">Thomas 15</ref> Oliver was the province's most prominent Liberal, but he had just been named federal Minister of the Interior and was not interested in leaving Ottawa.<ref name=\"Thomas 16\">Thomas 16</ref> Talbot was Laurier's preferred candidate, but he expected to be appointed to the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] and found the latter prospect more congenial than serving as Premier of Alberta.<ref name=\"Thomas 16\"/> Both men supported Rutherford, but neither was enthusiastic about doing so.<ref name=\"Babcock 23\">Babcock 23</ref> In August, Bulyea was appointed Alberta's first Lieutenant-Governor and later that month the [[Liberal Party of Alberta|Alberta Liberals]] selected Rutherford as their first leader.<ref>Thomas 17\u201318</ref>\n\nA final barrier was removed a few days later, when Haultain, who was a [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] federally but who was thought to be a potential leader of a [[coalition government]], announced that he would stay in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] to lead the Saskatchewan Conservatives.<ref name=\"Thomas 18\">Thomas 18</ref> On September 2, Bulyea asked Rutherford to form the first government of Alberta.<ref name=\"Thomas 19\">Thomas 19</ref>\n\nAfter accepting the position of premier, Rutherford selected a geographically-diverse cabinet on September 6: [[Edmonton]]'s [[Charles Wilson Cross]] as Attorney-General, [[Calgary]]'s [[William Henry Cushing]] as Minister of Public Works, [[Medicine Hat]]'s [[William Finlay]] as Minister of Agriculture and Provincial Secretary, and [[Lethbridge]]'s [[Leverett DeVeber|George DeVeber]] as Minister without Portfolio.<ref>Thomas 21\u201322</ref> Rutherford kept for himself the positions of Provincial Treasurer and Minister of Education.<ref name=\"Thomas 21\">Thomas 21</ref>\n\n==Premier==\n\n===1905 election===\n{{main|1905 Alberta general election}}\nRutherford was now premier but had not yet faced the people in an election and did not yet have a legislature to which he could propose legislation.<ref name=\"Babcock 27\">Babcock 27</ref> Elections for the first Legislative Assembly of Alberta were accordingly fixed for November 9.<ref name=\"Babcock 27\"/> The [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservatives]], the young province's only other political party, had already selected [[R.

The federal legislation creating the province had fixed [[Edmonton]] as the provisional capital, much to the chagrin of [[Calgary]].<ref name=\"Thomas 13\">Thomas 13</ref> Neither party had taken a position on the divisive question during the campaign,<ref name=\"Thomas 24\"/> but selecting a permanent capital was high on the list of the new legislature's orders of business.<ref name=\"Thomas 38\"/> Calgary's case was made most enthusiastically by Minister of Public Works Cushing, Edmonton's by Attorney-General Cross.<ref name=\"Thomas 38\"/> [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]] and [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] were also possibilities, but motions to select each failed to find seconders.<ref name=\"Thomas 38\"/> In the end, Edmonton was designated by a vote of sixteen members, including Rutherford, to eight.<ref name=\"Thomas 38\">Thomas 38</ref>\n\nA personal priority of Rutherford had been the establishment of a university.<ref name=\"Thomas 39\"/> Though the ''[[Edmonton Bulletin]]'' opined that it would be unfair \"that the people of the Province should be taxed for the special benefit of four per cent that they may be able to attach the cognomen of B.A. or M.A. to their names and flaunt the vanity of such over the taxpayer, who has to pay for it,\" Rutherford proceeded quickly.<ref name=\"Thomas 39\"/>  He was concerned that delay might result in the creation of denominational colleges, striking a blow to his dream of a high-quality nonsectarian system of postsecondary education.<ref name=\"Thomas 40\">Thomas 40</ref> A bill establishing the university was passed by the legislature but left the government to decide the location.<ref name=\"Thomas 50\"/> Calgary felt that having lost the fight to be provincial capital, it could expect the university to be established there,<ref name=\"Thomas 39\">Thomas 39</ref> and it was not pleased when, a year late the government announced the founding of the [[University of Alberta]] in Rutherford's hometown, Strathcona.<ref name=\"Thomas 50\">Thomas 50</ref>\n\n[[File:Premier Rutherford.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Rutherford as Premier]]While the regionally-charged issues attracted much attention, they were far from the government's only initiatives during the legislature's first session. In 1906, it passed a series of acts dealing with the organization and administration of the new provincial government and incorporated the cities of [[Lethbridge]], [[Medicine Hat]], and [[Wetaskiwin]].<ref name=\"Thomas 41\">Thomas 41</ref> It also established a [[speed limit]] of {{convert|20|mph|km/h}} for motorized vehicles and set up a regime for mine inspection.<ref>Thomas 40\u201341</ref> Perhaps most significantly, it set up a court system,<ref name=\"Thomas 36\">Thomas 36</ref> with [[Arthur Lewis Sifton]] as the province's first Chief Justice.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\">Thomas 48</ref>\n\nThough the founding of the University of Alberta was the centrepiece of Rutherford's educational policy, his activity as Minister of Education extended well beyond it. In the first year of Alberta's existence, 140 new schools were established, and a [[normal school]] was set up in Calgary to train teachers.<ref name=\"Thomas 41\"/> Rutherford put great emphasis on the creation of English-language schools in the large portions of the province that were occupied primarily by Central and Eastern European immigrants.<ref name=\"Thomas 41\"/> The immigrants themselves were often unable to speak English, and the provision of these schools for their children was a major factor in their rapid assimilation into Albertan society.<ref name=\"Thomas 42\">Thomas 42</ref> They were also in lieu of separate religious schools for groups such as [[Mennonites]]. While the continued existence of [[Roman Catholic]] separate schools was mandated by the terms of Alberta's admission into Confederation, the government's policy was otherwise to encourage a unified and secular public school system.<ref name=\"Thomas 42\"/> Rutherford also introduced free school texts in the province but was criticized for commissioning the texts from a [[Toronto]] publisher, which printed them in [[New York (state)|New York]], rather than locally.<ref name=\"Babcock 35\">Babcock 35</ref>\n\n===Labour unrest===\nThe winter of 1906\u201307 was the coldest in Alberta history and was exacerbated by a shortage of coal.<ref name=\"Thomas 46\">Thomas 46</ref> One cause of this shortage was the strained relationship between coal miners and mine operators in the province.<ref name=\"Thomas 46\"/> At the beginning of April 1907, the Canada West Coal and Coke Company [[lockout (industry)|locked out]] the miners from its mine near [[Taber, Alberta|Taber]].<ref name=\"Thomas 47\">Thomas 47</ref> The same company was also facing a work stoppage at its mine in the [[Crow's Nest Pass]], where miners were refusing to sign a new contract.<ref name=\"Thomas 47\"/> The problem spread until by April 22, all 3,400 miners working for member-companies of the Western Coal Operators' Association were off work.<ref name=\"Thomas 47\"/> Miners' demands included increased wages,<ref name=\"Thomas 47\"/> a reduction in working hours to eight per day (from ten), the posting of mine inspection reports, the isolated storage of explosives, the use of non-freezing explosives, and semi-monthly rather than monthly pay. The mine operators objected to this last point on the basis that since many miners did not report to work the day after payday, it desirable to keep paydays to a minimum.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/>\n\n[[File:Arthur Sifton2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Arthur Sifton]] chaired the commission inquiring into conditions in Alberta's coal mines and later succeeded Rutherford as Premier.]]Rutherford's government appointed a commission in February, but it was not until May that it met.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/> It consisted of Chief Justice [[Arthur Sifton]], mining executive Lewis Stockett, and miners' union executive William Haysom.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/> It began taking evidence in July.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/> In the meantime, a May agreement saw most miners return to work at increased rates of pay. Coal supply promptly increased, as did its price.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/> In August, the commission released its recommendations, which included a prohibition on children under 16 working in mines, the posting of inspectors' reports, mandatory bath houses at mine sites, and improved ventilation inspection. It also recommended for Albertans to keep a supply of coal on hand during the summer for winter use.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/> The commission was silent on wages (other than to say that these should not be fixed by legislation), the operation of [[company store]]s (a sore point among the miners), and the [[incorporation (business)|incorporation]] of miners' unions, which was recommended by mine management but opposed by the unions.<ref>Thomas 48\u201349</ref>\n\nThe committee also made no recommendation about working hours, but Rutherford's government legislated an [[eight-hour day]] anyway.<ref name=\"Thomas 49\">Thomas 49</ref> As well, Rutherford's government also passed [[workers' compensation]] legislation designed to make such compensation automatic, rather than requiring the injured worker to sue his employer.<ref>Thomas 56\u201357</ref> Labour representatives criticized the bill for failing to impose fines on negligent employers, for limiting construction workers' eligibility under the program to injuries sustained while they were working on buildings more than {{convert|40|ft|m}} high, amd for exempting casual labourers. It also viewed the maximum payout of $1,500 as inadequate.<ref name=\"Thomas 57\">Thomas 57</ref> In response to these concerns, the maximum was increased to $1,800 and the minimum building height reduced to {{convert|30|ft|m}}.<ref name=\"Thomas 57\"/> In response to farmers' concerns, farm labourers were made exempt from the bill entirely.<ref name=\"Thomas 57\"/>\n\nRutherford's relationship with organized labour was never easy. Historian L.G.

By focusing on areas neglected by existing companies, the government was entering into the most expensive and least profitable fields of telecommunication.<ref name=\"Thomas 52\"/> Such.problems would not come to fruition until Rutherford had left office, however. In the short term, the government's involvement in the telephone business helped it to a sweeping victory in the [[1909 Alberta general election|1909 election]].<ref name=\"Thomas 64\">Thomas 64</ref> The Liberals won 37 of 41 seats in the newly-expanded legislature.<ref name=\"Thomas 69\">Thomas 69</ref>\n\nOf equal profile was Rutherford's government's management of the province's railways.

Boyle]] began to ask questions about the agreement between the government and the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Company, and Cushing resigned from cabinet over his views of this same agreement.<ref>Thomas 70\u201371</ref>\n\nThe Alberta and Great Waterways Railway was one of several companies that had been granted charters and assistance by the legislature to build new railways in the province.<ref name=\"Thomas 62\"/> The government support that it received was more generous than that received by the more established railways, such as the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway]] and the [[Canadian Northern Railway]].<ref name=\"Thomas 62\"/> Boyle, Cushing, and Bennett alleged favouritism or ineptitude by Rutherford and his government, and they pointed to the sale of government-guaranteed bonds in support of the company as further evidence.<ref>Thomas 72\u201379</ref> Because of the high interest rate they paid, the bonds were sold at above [[par value]], but the government received only par for them and left the company to pocket the difference.<ref>Thomas 77\u201378</ref>\n\nBoyle sponsored a [[motion of non-confidence]] against the government.<ref name=\"Thomas 72\">Thomas 72</ref> Despite enjoying the support of twelve Liberals, including Cushing, the motion was defeated and the government upheld.<ref name=\"Thomas 80\">Thomas 80</ref> Rutherford attempted to quell the controversy by calling a [[royal commission]],<ref name=\"Thomas 84\">Thomas 84</ref> but pressure from many Liberals, including Bulyea, led him to resign May 26, 1910.

Born in [[Ormond, Ontario|Ormond, Canada West]], he studied and practised law in [[Ottawa]] before he moved with his family to the [[North-West Territories]] in 1895. There, he began his political career, winning in his third attempt a seat in the [[North-West Legislative Assembly]]. In keeping with the territorial custom, Rutherford ran as an [[independent (politician)|independent]] but generally supported the territorial administration of Premier [[Frederick W.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;G. Haultain]]. At the federal level, however, Rutherford was a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]].\n\nIn 1905, Alberta Lieutenant Governor [[George Bulyea]] asked Rutherford to form the new province's first government. As premier, Rutherford's first task was to win a workable majority in the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], which he did in the [[1905 Alberta general election|1905 provincial election]]. His second was to provide the apparatus of provincial government, and his government established everything from [[speed limit]]s to a provincial court system. The legislature also controversially, and with Rutherford's support, selected [[Edmonton]] over rival [[Calgary]] as the provincial capital. Calgarians' bruised feelings were not salved when the government located the [[University of Alberta]], a project dear to the Premier's heart, in his hometown of [[Strathcona, Alberta|Strathcona]], just across the [[North Saskatchewan River]] from Edmonton.\n\nThe government was faced with labour unrest in the [[coal mining]] industry, which it resolved by establishing a commission to examine the problem. It also set up a provincial government telephone network ([[Alberta Government Telephones]]) at great expense, and tried to encourage the development of new railways.\n\nIt was in pursuit of the last objective that the Rutherford government found itself embroiled in scandal. Early in 1910, [[William Henry Cushing]]'s resignation as Minister of Public Works precipitated the [[Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal]], which turned many of Rutherford's Liberals against his government. Eventually, pressure from many party figures forced Rutherford to resign. He kept his seat in the legislature after resigning as premier, but he was defeated in the [[1913 Alberta general election|1913 election]] by [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]] [[Herbert Crawford]].\n\nAfter leaving politics, Rutherford continued his law practice and his involvement with a wide range of community groups. Most importantly, he became [[List of Chancellors of the University of Alberta|chancellor of the University of Alberta]], whose earlier founding had been a personal project, and stayed in that position until he died of a heart attack.\n\nA University of Alberta library, an Edmonton elementary school, and [[Jasper National Park]]'s [[Mount Rutherford]] are named in his honour. Additionally, his home, [[Rutherford House]], was opened as a museum in 1973.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Rutherford articling.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rutherford as an articled clerk, {{circa|1883}}]]Alexander Rutherford was born February 2, 1857, near [[Ormond, Ontario|Ormond, Canada West]], on his family's dairy farm.<ref name=\"Babcock 1\">Babcock 1</ref> His parents, James (1817&ndash;1891) and Elspet<ref name=\"pc205\" /> \"Elizabeth\" (1818&ndash;1901) Cameron Rutherford,<ref name=\"pc205\">Perry, Craig 2006, p. 205.</ref> had immigrated from [[Scotland]] two years previous.<ref name=\"Babcock 1\"/> They joined the [[Baptist Church]], and his father joined the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] and served for a time on the [[Osgoode, Ontario|Osgoode]] village council.<ref name=\"Babcock 1\"/> Rutherford attended public school locally and, after rejecting dairy farming as a vocation, enrolled in a [[Metcalfe, Ontario|Metcalfe]] high school.<ref name=\"Babcock 1\"/> After graduating in 1874, he attended the [[Canadian Literary Institute]], a Baptist college in [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]].<ref name=\"Babcock 1\"/> He graduated from there in 1876 and taught for a year in Osgoode.\n\nHe moved to [[Montreal]] to study arts and law at [[McGill University]].<ref name=\"Roome 4\">Roome 4</ref> He was awarded degrees in both in 1881, and joined the [[Ottawa]] law firm of Scott, McTavish and McCracken, where he was [[articled clerk|articled]] for four years under the tutelage of [[Richard William Scott]].<ref>Babcock 1\u20134</ref> Called to the Ontario bar in 1885, he became a junior partner in the firm of Hodkins, Kidd and Rutherford, with responsibility for its [[Kemptville, Ontario|Kemptville]] office for ten years.<ref name=\"Babcock 4\">Babcock 4</ref> He also established a moneylending business there.<ref name=\"Babcock 5\">Babcock 5</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, his social circle grew to include [[William Cameron Edwards]].<ref name=\"Babcock 4\"/> Through Edwards, Rutherford was introduced to the Birkett family, which included former [[Member of Parliament]] [[Thomas Birkett]].<ref name=\"Babcock 4\"/> Rutherford married Birkett's niece, Mattie Birkett, in December 1888.<ref name=\"Babcock 4\"/> The couple had three children: Cecil (born in 1890), Hazel (born in 1893),<ref name=\"Babcock 4\"/> and Marjorie (born in 1903 but died sixteen months later).<ref>Babcock 21\u201322</ref> Rutherford had a traditional view of gender roles and was happy to leave most childrearing responsibilities to his wife.<ref name=\"Roome 6\">Roome 6</ref>\n\n===Move west===\nIn November 1886 Rutherford visited the Canadian West for the first time, when he travelled to [[British Columbia]] to investigate the disappearance of his cousin.<ref name=\"Roome 5\">Roome 5</ref> The [[Rocky Mountains]] left a great impression on him, as did the coastal climate, which he found \"very agreeable\".<ref name=\"Roome 5\"/> He visited again in the summer of 1894, when he took the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] across the prairies.<ref name=\"Babcock 4\"/> Upon arriving in [[Strathcona, Alberta|South Edmonton]], he was excited by its growth potential and pleased to find that the dry air relieved his [[bronchitis]].<ref name=\"Babcock 4\"/> He resolved to settle there and did so one year later, bringing his reluctant wife and his children,<ref name=\"Roome 5\"/> who arrived by train June 10, 1895.<ref name=\"Babcock 5\"/> Within ten days of their arrival, Rutherford had opened a law office, purchased four lots of land, and contracted local builder Hugh McCurdy to build him a house.<ref name=\"Babcock 8\">Babcock 8</ref> In July, the family moved into their new four-room house, built on a single storey.<ref name=\"Babcock 8\"/> In 1896 Rutherford became the town's only lawyer, as his competition, Mervyn Mackenzie, had moved to [[Toronto]].<ref name=\"Babcock 5\"/>\n\n[[File:Alexander Rutherford 1895.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Rutherford around the time of his move West]]Rutherford quickly became deeply involved in the community. Among the roles he acquired during his first three years in the [[District of Alberta]] were president of the newly formed South Edmonton Football Club, secretary-treasurer of the South Edmonton School Board, president of the South Edmonton Athletic Association, vice president of the South Edmonton Literary Institute, auditor of the South Edmonton Agricultural Society, and worthy master of the Acacia Lodge, Ancient Free and Accepted [[freemasonry|Masons]].<ref name=\"Babcock 10\">Babcock 10</ref> He also became secretary of the Edmonton District Butter and Cheese Manufacturing Association.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> He was an early advocate for the incorporation of South Edmonton, hitherto an [[unincorporated community]]. When incorporation came in 1899, as the Town of [[Strathcona, Alberta|Strathcona]], Rutherford became the new town's secretary-treasurer after he had acted as returning officer in its first election.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/>\n\nThroughout that period, he practised law, from 1899 with [[Frederick C. Jamieson]], who later was elected as a [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]] member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]].<ref name=\"Babcock 15\">Babcock 15</ref> He employed single women as secretaries in an era that.erical workers were predominantly male, and he defended a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|First Nations person]] accused of murder when most lawyers refused such cases.<ref name=\"Babcock 15\"/> As their practice grew, he and Jamieson also engaged in [[credit (finance)|moneylending]].<ref name=\"Babcock 21\">Babcock 21</ref> Besides his law practice, Rutherford was a successful [[real estate]] investor, and he also owned an interest in [[gold mining]] equipment situated on the [[North Saskatchewan River]].<ref name=\"Babcock 16\">Babcock 16</ref>\n\n===Early political career===\nIn 1896, [[Frank Oliver (politician)|Frank Oliver]], who had represented [[Edmonton (N.W.T. electoral district)|Edmonton]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories]] since 1888, resigned to pursue a career in federal politics.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> Several Strathcona residents urged Rutherford to run for Oliver's old seat in the ensuing [[by-election]].<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> Though he was originally reluctant, he agreed to stand after a 300-signature [[petition]] urging his candidacy was presented to him.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> His only opponent was a former [[mayor of Edmonton]], [[Matthew McCauley (politician)|Matthew McCauley]], who, like Rutherford, ran as an [[independent (politician)|independent]].<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> Rutherford campaigned on a platform of improved roads, resource development, simplification of territorial ordinances, and (in what would become a theme of his political career) increased educational funding.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> McCauley won the election, but Rutherford received more than forty percent of the vote.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/>\n\n[[File:Rutherford family.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Rutherford family in 1898]]During the [[1898 Northwest Territories general election|1898 territorial election]], Rutherford again challenged the now-incumbent McCauley.<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> His defeat of two years previous still fresh in his mind, his platform this time included a call for a [[redistribution (election)|redrawing]] of the territory's electoral boundaries. He believed that the current Edmonton [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] was [[gerrymander]]ed in McCauley's favour.<ref name=\"Babcock 11\">Babcock 11</ref> He also repeated his past calls for improved roads and advocated increased taxation on the railroads.<ref name=\"Babcock 11\"/> He pledged \"independent support\" for the nonpartisan administration of Premier [[Frederick Haultain]],<ref name=\"Babcock 10\"/> and he supported that administration's call for the creation of a [[Province of Buffalo|single province]] from the territories following the 1901 [[census]].<ref name=\"Babcock 11\"/> Rutherford criticized McCauley's past record, accusing him of silence on issues that were of concern to his constituents.<ref name=\"Babcock 11\"/> Despite this, McCauley won again but by a reduced margin.<ref name=\"Babcock 11\"/>\n\nRutherford was at last successful in the [[1902 Northwest Territories general election|1902 election]], when he ran in the newly-created riding of [[Strathcona (N.W.T. electoral district)|Strathcona]].<ref name=\"Babcock 19\">Babcock 19</ref> His 1902 platform was similar to his 1898 platform and supported Haultain, but he now supported a two-province integration of the [[Northwest Territories]] into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], rather than Haultain's preferred one-province approach, on the grounds that a single province would be so large as to be ungovernable.<ref name=\"Babcock 19\"/> It at first looked as though he would run unopposed; however, at the last minute, local lawyer Nelson D. Mills publicly accused Rutherford of being not a true independent, but a dyed-in-the-wool Haultain supporter, and announced that he would run against him.<ref name=\"Babcock 19\"/> Rutherford was supported by most of Strathcona's most prominent residents, including his law partner Jamieson and his future rival [[John R.

The federal legislation creating the province had fixed [[Edmonton]] as the provisional capital, much to the chagrin of [[Calgary]].<ref name=\"Thomas 13\">Thomas 13</ref> Neither party had taken a position on the divisive question during the campaign,<ref name=\"Thomas 24\"/> but selecting a permanent capital was high on the list of the new legislature's orders of business.<ref name=\"Thomas 38\"/> Calgary's case was made most enthusiastically by Minister of Public Works Cushing, Edmonton's by Attorney-General Cross.<ref name=\"Thomas 38\"/> [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]] and [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] were also possibilities, but motions to select each failed to find seconders.<ref name=\"Thomas 38\"/> In the end, Edmonton was designated by a vote of sixteen members, including Rutherford, to eight.<ref name=\"Thomas 38\">Thomas 38</ref>\n\nA personal priority of Rutherford had been the establishment of a university.<ref name=\"Thomas 39\"/> Though the ''[[Edmonton Bulletin]]'' opined that it would be unfair \"that the people of the Province should be taxed for the special benefit of four per cent that they may be able to attach the cognomen of B.A. or M.A. to their names and flaunt the vanity of such over the taxpayer, who has to pay for it,\" Rutherford proceeded quickly.<ref name=\"Thomas 39\"/>  He was concerned that delay might result in the creation of denominational colleges, striking a blow to his dream of a high-quality nonsectarian system of postsecondary education.<ref name=\"Thomas 40\">Thomas 40</ref> A bill establishing the university was passed by the legislature but left the government to decide the location.<ref name=\"Thomas 50\"/> Calgary felt that having lost the fight to be provincial capital, it could expect the university to be established there,<ref name=\"Thomas 39\">Thomas 39</ref> and it was not pleased when, a year late the government announced the founding of the [[University of Alberta]] in Rutherford's hometown, Strathcona.<ref name=\"Thomas 50\">Thomas 50</ref>\n\n[[File:Premier Rutherford.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Rutherford as Premier]]While the regionally-charged issues attracted much attention, they were far from the government's only initiatives during the legislature's first session. In 1906, it passed a series of acts dealing with the organization and administration of the new provincial government and incorporated the cities of [[Lethbridge]], [[Medicine Hat]], and [[Wetaskiwin]].<ref name=\"Thomas 41\">Thomas 41</ref> It also established a [[speed limit]] of {{convert|20|mph|km/h}} for motorized vehicles and set up a regime for mine inspection.<ref>Thomas 40\u201341</ref> Perhaps most significantly, it set up a court system,<ref name=\"Thomas 36\">Thomas 36</ref> with [[Arthur Lewis Sifton]] as the province's first Chief Justice.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\">Thomas 48</ref>\n\nThough the founding of the University of Alberta was the centrepiece of Rutherford's educational policy, his activity as Minister of Education extended well beyond it. In the first year of Alberta's existence, 140 new schools were established, and a [[normal school]] was set up in Calgary to train teachers.<ref name=\"Thomas 41\"/> Rutherford put great emphasis on the creation of English-language schools in the large portions of the province that were occupied primarily by Central and Eastern European immigrants.<ref name=\"Thomas 41\"/> The immigrants themselves were often unable to speak English, and the provision of these schools for their children was a major factor in their rapid assimilation into Albertan society.<ref name=\"Thomas 42\">Thomas 42</ref> They were also in lieu of separate religious schools for groups such as [[Mennonites]]. While the continued existence of [[Roman Catholic]] separate schools was mandated by the terms of Alberta's admission into Confederation, the government's policy was otherwise to encourage a unified and secular public school system.<ref name=\"Thomas 42\"/> Rutherford also introduced free school texts in the province but was criticized for commissioning the texts from a [[Toronto]] publisher, which printed them in [[New York (state)|New York]], rather than locally.<ref name=\"Babcock 35\">Babcock 35</ref>\n\n===Labour unrest===\nThe winter of 1906\u201307 was the coldest in Alberta history and was exacerbated by a shortage of coal.<ref name=\"Thomas 46\">Thomas 46</ref> One cause of this shortage was the strained relationship between coal miners and mine operators in the province.<ref name=\"Thomas 46\"/> At the beginning of April 1907, the Canada West Coal and Coke Company [[lockout (industry)|locked out]] the miners from its mine near [[Taber, Alberta|Taber]].<ref name=\"Thomas 47\">Thomas 47</ref> The same company was also facing a work stoppage at its mine in the [[Crow's Nest Pass]], where miners were refusing to sign a new contract.<ref name=\"Thomas 47\"/> The problem spread until by April 22, all 3,400 miners working for member-companies of the Western Coal Operators' Association were off work.<ref name=\"Thomas 47\"/> Miners' demands included increased wages,<ref name=\"Thomas 47\"/> a reduction in working hours to eight per day (from ten), the posting of mine inspection reports, the isolated storage of explosives, the use of non-freezing explosives, and semi-monthly rather than monthly pay. The mine operators objected to this last point on the basis that since many miners did not report to work the day after payday, it desirable to keep paydays to a minimum.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/>\n\n[[File:Arthur Sifton2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Arthur Sifton]] chaired the commission inquiring into conditions in Alberta's coal mines and later succeeded Rutherford as Premier.]]Rutherford's government appointed a commission in February, but it was not until May that it met.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/> It consisted of Chief Justice [[Arthur Sifton]], mining executive Lewis Stockett, and miners' union executive William Haysom.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/> It began taking evidence in July.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/> In the meantime, a May agreement saw most miners return to work at increased rates of pay. Coal supply promptly increased, as did its price.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/> In August, the commission released its recommendations, which included a prohibition on children under 16 working in mines, the posting of inspectors' reports, mandatory bath houses at mine sites, and improved ventilation inspection. It also recommended for Albertans to keep a supply of coal on hand during the summer for winter use.<ref name=\"Thomas 48\"/> The commission was silent on wages (other than to say that these should not be fixed by legislation), the operation of [[company store]]s (a sore point among the miners), and the [[incorporation (business)|incorporation]] of miners' unions, which was recommended by mine management but opposed by the unions.<ref>Thomas 48\u201349</ref>\n\nThe committee also made no recommendation about working hours, but Rutherford's government legislated an [[eight-hour day]] anyway.<ref name=\"Thomas 49\">Thomas 49</ref> As well, Rutherford's government also passed [[workers' compensation]] legislation designed to make such compensation automatic, rather than requiring the injured worker to sue his employer.<ref>Thomas 56\u201357</ref> Labour representatives criticized the bill for failing to impose fines on negligent employers, for limiting construction workers' eligibility under the program to injuries sustained while they were working on buildings more than {{convert|40|ft|m}} high, amd for exempting casual labourers. It also viewed the maximum payout of $1,500 as inadequate.<ref name=\"Thomas 57\">Thomas 57</ref> In response to these concerns, the maximum was increased to $1,800 and the minimum building height reduced to {{convert|30|ft|m}}.<ref name=\"Thomas 57\"/> In response to farmers' concerns, farm labourers were made exempt from the bill entirely.<ref name=\"Thomas 57\"/>\n\nRutherford's relationship with organized labour was never easy. Historian L.G. Thomas argued that there was little indication that Rutherford had any interest in courting the labour vote.<ref name=\"Thomas 49\"/> In 1908, [[Labour parties and candidates in Canada|Labour]] candidate [[Donald McNabb]] was elected in a [[Lethbridge (provincial electoral district)|Lethbridge]] by-election; the riding had previously been held by a Liberal.<ref name=\"Thomas 49\"/> McNabb was the first Labour MLA elected in Alberta (he was defeated in his 1909 re-election bid).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Finkel |first=Alvin |date=Fall 1985 |title=The Rise and Fall of the Labour Party in Alberta, 1917\u201342 |journal=Labour/Le Travail |volume=16 |page=63 |url=http://www.lltjournal.ca/index.php/llt/article/viewPDFInterstitial/2472/2875 |accessdate=2008-12-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706184337/http://www.lltjournal.ca/index.php/llt/article/viewPDFInterstitial/2472/2875 |archivedate=2011-07-06 }}</ref>\n\n===Public works===\nRutherford's Liberals self-identified as the party of free enterprise, in contrast to the Conservatives, who supported public ownership<ref name=\"Thomas 2.3\">Thomas 23</ref> Still the Liberals made a limited number of large-scale forays into government operation of utilities, the most notable of which being the creation of [[Alberta Government Telephones]].<ref name=\"Thomas 50\"/> In 1906, Alberta's municipalities legislation was passed and included a provision authorizing municipalities to operate telephone companies.<ref name=\"Thomas 52\">Thomas 52</ref> Several, including Edmonton, did so, alongside private companies.<ref name=\"Thomas 52\"/> The largest private company was the [[Bell Canada|Bell Telephone Company]], which held a [[monopoly]] over service in Calgary.<ref name=\"Thomas 52\"/> Such monopolies and the private firms' refusal to extend their services into sparsely-populated and unprofitable rural areas aroused demand for provincial entry into the market, which was effected in 1907.<ref name=\"Thomas 51\">Thomas 51</ref> The government constructed a number of lines, beginning with one between Calgary and Banff, and it also purchased Bell's lines for $675,000.<ref name=\"Thomas 53\">Thomas 53</ref>\n\nAlberta's public telephone system was financed by debt, which was unusual for a government like Rutherford's, which.was generally committed to the principle of \"[[PAYGO|pay as you go]]\".<ref>Thomas 52\u201353</ref> Rutherford's stated rationale was that the cost of such a large capital project should not.be borne by a single generation and that incurring debt to finance a corresponding asset was, in contrast to operating [[government budget deficit|deficit]]s, acceptable.<ref name=\"Thomas 53\"/> Though the move was popular at the time, it would prove not to be financially astute. By focusing on areas neglected by existing companies, the government was entering into the most expensive and least profitable fields of telecommunication.<ref name=\"Thomas 52\"/> Such.problems would not come to fruition until Rutherford had left office, however. In the short term, the government's involvement in the telephone business helped it to a sweeping victory in the [[1909 Alberta general election|1909 election]].<ref name=\"Thomas 64\">Thomas 64</ref> The Liberals won 37 of 41 seats in the newly-expanded legislature.<ref name=\"Thomas 69\">Thomas 69</ref>\n\nOf equal profile was Rutherford's government's management of the province's railways. Alberta's early years were optimistic and manifested itself in a pronounced enthusiasm for the construction of new railway lines.<ref name=\"Thomas 59\">Thomas 59</ref> Every town wanted to be a railway centre, and the government had great confidence in the ability of the free market to provide low freight rates to the province's farmers if sufficient charters were issued to competing companies.<ref>Thomas 43\u201344</ref> The legislature passed government-sponsored legislation setting out a framework for new railways in 1907, but interest from private firms in actually building the lines was limited.<ref>Thomas 58\u201359</ref>\n\nIn the face of public demand and support by legislators of all parties for as rapid as possible an expansion of the province's lines, the government offered [[loan guarantees]] to several companies in exchange for commitments to build lines.<ref name=\"Thomas 62\">Thomas 62</ref> Rutherford justified this in part by his conviction that railways needed to expand along with population, rather than have railway expansion follow population growth, which would be the case without government intervention.<ref name=\"Thomas 62\"/> The Conservatives argued that the strategy did not go far enough, and they called for direct government ownership.<ref name=\"Thomas 59\"/>\n[[File:Alexander Rutherford.jpg|thumb|left|Rutherford's official portrait.]]\nWhile most public works issues were handled by Public Works Minister Cushing, but after the 1909 election, Rutherford named himself as the province's first Minister of Railways.<ref>Babcock 57</ref>\n\n===Railway scandal===\n{{main|Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal}}\n[[File:John R.

He was replaced by [[Arthur Sifton]], hitherto the province's chief judge.<ref>Thomas 87\u201390</ref>\n\nIn November, the royal commission issued its report<ref name=\"Thomas 97\">Thomas 97</ref> that found that the evidence did not show a [[conflict of interest]] on Rutherford's part, but the majority report was nevertheless highly critical of the former premier.<ref>Thomas 97\u2013104</ref> A minority report was much kinder by avowing perfect satisfaction with Rutherford's version of events.<ref>Thomas 104\u2013105</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n\n===Later political career===\nBefore the [[1911 Canadian federal election|1911 federal election]], several local Liberals opposed to Frank Oliver asked Rutherford to run against him in [[Strathcona (electoral district)|Strathcona]].<ref name=\"Babcock 69\"/> Relations between Oliver and Rutherford had always been chilly. Oliver was implacably opposed to Cross and viewed him as a rival for dominance of the Liberal Party in Alberta,<ref name=\"Thomas 132\">Thomas 132</ref> and his ''Edmonton Bulletin'' had taken the side of the dissidents during the railway scandal.<ref name=\"Babcock 69\"/> A nominating meeting unanimously nominated Rutherford as Liberal candidate, but Oliver refused to accept its legitimacy and awaited a later meeting.<ref name=\"Babcock 69\"/> Before the meeting came to pass, however, Rutherford abruptly withdrew.<ref name=\"Babcock 69-70\">Babcock 69\u201370</ref> Historian Douglas Babcock suggested that to be caused by the Conservatives' nomination of [[William Antrobus Griesbach]], dashing Rutherford's hopes that his popularity among Conservatives would preclude them from opposing him.<ref name=\"Babcock 70\"/> Rumours at the time alleged that Rutherford had been asked to make a personal contribution of $15,000 to his campaign fund and had balked.<ref name=\"Babcock 69-70\"/> Rutherford himself cited a desire to avoid [[vote splitting|splitting the vote]] on [[reciprocity (Canadian politics)|reciprocity]], which he and Oliver both favoured but Griesbach opposed.<ref name=\"Babcock 70\"/> Whatever the reason for Rutherford's standing aloof from the election, Oliver was nominated as Liberal candidate and was re-elected.<ref name=\"Babcock 70\"/>\n\nAfter resigning as premier, Rutherford continued to sit as a Liberal MLA.<ref name=\"Babcock 69\">Babcock 69</ref> He commanded the loyalty of many Liberals who had supported his government through the Alberta and Great Waterways issue,<ref name=\"Babcock 67\">Babcock 67</ref> but the faction began increasingly to see Cross as its real leader.<ref name=\"Thomas 108\">Thomas 108</ref> Rutherford opposed the Sifton government's decision to confiscate the Alberta and Great Waterways bond money and revoke its charter,<ref name=\"Babcock 67\"/> and in 1913, he was one of only two Liberals to support a non-confidence motion against the government<ref name=\"Babcock 70\">Babcock 70\"</ref> (Cross had by now joined the Sifton cabinet, which placated most members of the Cross-Rutherford faction.<ref name=\"Babcock 69\"/>\n\nIn the [[1913 Alberta general election|1913 election]], Rutherford was again nominated as the Liberal candidate in [[Edmonton South (provincial electoral district)|Edmonton South]] (Strathcona had been amalgamated into Edmonton in 1912),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/edmonton/ |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |title=Edmonton |accessdate=2008-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007230006/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0002525 |archivedate=2008-10-07 }}</ref> despite pledging opposition to the Sifton government and offering to campaign around the province for the Conservatives if they agreed not to run a candidate against him.<ref name=\"Babcock 71\">Babcock 71</ref> At the nomination meeting, he stated that he was \"not running as a Sifton candidate\" and was \"a good independent candidate&nbsp;... and a good Liberal too\".<ref name=\"Babcock 72\">Babcock 72</ref> Despite his opposition to the government, Conservatives declined his offer of support and nominated [[Herbert Crawford]] to run against him.<ref name=\"Babcock 71\"/> After a vigorous campaign, Crawford defeated Rutherford by fewer than 250 votes.<ref name=\"Babcock 72\"/> Cross lobbied Prime Minister Laurier for Rutherford to be appointed to the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]].

{"title_page": "Address Resolution Protocol", "text_new": "{{short description|Telecommunications protocol used for resolution of network layer addresses}}\nThe '''Address Resolution Protocol''' ('''ARP''') is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as a MAC address, associated with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address. This mapping is a critical function in the Internet protocol suite. ARPThe Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as a MAC address, associated with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address. This mapping is a critical function in the Internet protocol suite. ARP was defined in 1982 by\u00a0 <nowiki>RFC 826</nowiki>, which is Internet Standard STD 37.\n\nARP has been implemented with many combinations of network and data link layer technologies, such as IPv4, Chaosnet, DECnet and Xerox PARC Universal Packet (PUP) using IEEE 802 standards, FDDI, X.25, Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). IPv4 over IEEE 802.3 and IEEE 802.11 is the most common usage.\n\nIn Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) networks, the functionality of ARP is provided by the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP). was defined in 1982 by , which is Internet Standard STD 37.\n\nARP has been implemented with many combinations of network and data link layer technologies, such as IPv4, Chaosnet, DECnet and Xerox PARC Universal Packet (PUP) using  standards, FDDI, X.25, Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). IPv4 over IEEE 802.3 and IEEE 802.11 is the most common usage.\n\nIn  (IPv6) networks, the functionality of ARP is provided by the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP).\n\n==Operating scope==\nThe Address Resolution Protocol is a [[request-response]] protocol whose messages are encapsulated by a link layer protocol. It is communicated within the boundaries of a single network, never routed across internetworking nodes. This property places ARP into the [[link layer]] of the [[Internet protocol suite]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122 | author = Braden, R. | title = RFC 1122 - Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Communication Layers | publisher = Internet Engineering Task Force | date = October 1989}}</ref>\n\n==Packet structure==\nThe Address Resolution Protocol uses a simple message format containing one address resolution request or response. The size of the ARP message depends on the link layer and network layer address sizes. The message [[Header_(computing)|header]] specifies the types of network in use at each layer as well as the size of addresses of each. The message header is completed with the operation code for request (1) and reply (2). The payload of the packet consists of four addresses, the hardware and protocol address of the sender and receiver hosts.\n\nThe principal packet structure of ARP packets is shown in the following table which illustrates the case of IPv4 networks running on Ethernet. In this scenario, the packet has 48-bit fields for the sender hardware address (SHA) and target hardware address (THA), and 32-bit fields for the corresponding sender and target protocol addresses (SPA and TPA). The ARP packet size in this case is 28 bytes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align: center; width: 30em;\" border=1\n|+ Internet Protocol (IPv4) over Ethernet ARP packet\n|-\n! colspan=\"1\"|Octet offset\n! colspan=\"8\" width=\"50%\"|0\n! colspan=\"8\" width=\"50%\"|1\n|-\n! 0\n| colspan=\"16\"| Hardware type (HTYPE)\n|-\n! 2\n| colspan=\"16\"| Protocol type (PTYPE)\n|-\n! 4\n| colspan=\"8\"| Hardware address length (HLEN)\n| colspan=\"8\"| Protocol address length (PLEN)\n|-\n! 6\n| colspan=\"16\"| Operation (OPER)\n|-\n! 8\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#f0fff0\"| Sender hardware address (SHA) (first 2 bytes)\n|-\n! 10\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#f0fff0\"| (next 2 bytes)\n|-\n! 12\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#f0fff0\"| (last 2 bytes)\n|-\n! 14\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#d0ffd0\"| Sender protocol address (SPA) (first 2 bytes)\n|-\n! 16\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#d0ffd0\"| (last 2 bytes)\n|-\n! 18\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#f0f0ff\"| Target hardware address (THA) (first 2 bytes)\n|-\n! 20\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#f0f0ff\"| (next 2 bytes)\n|-\n! 22\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#f0f0ff\"| (last 2 bytes)\n|-\n! 24\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#d0d0ff\"| Target protocol address (TPA) (first 2 bytes)\n|-\n! 26\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#d0d0ff\"| (last 2 bytes)\n|}\n\n; Hardware type (HTYPE): This field specifies the network link protocol type.

This appears in the Ethernet frame header when the payload is an ARP packet and is not to be confused with PTYPE, which appears within this encapsulated ARP packet.\n\n==Example==\nTwo computers in an office (Computer 1 and Computer 2) are connected to each other in a [[local area network]] by [[Ethernet]] cables and [[network switches]], with no intervening [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]] or [[Router (computing)|routers]]. Computer 1 has a packet to send to Computer 2. Through [[DNS]], it determines that Computer 2 has the IP address 192.168.0.55.\n\nTo send the message, it also requires Computer 2's [[MAC address]]. First, Computer 1 uses a cached ARP table to look up 192.168.0.55 for any existing records of Computer 2's MAC address (00:eb:24:b2:05:ac). If the MAC address is found, it sends an Ethernet [[frame (networking)|frame]] with destination address 00:eb:24:b2:05:ac, containing the IP packet onto the link. If the cache did not produce a result for 192.168.0.55, Computer 1 has to send a broadcast ARP request message (destination FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF MAC address), which is accepted by all computers on the local network, requesting an answer for 192.168.0.55. \n\nComputer 2 responds with an ARP response message containing its MAC and IP addresses. As part of fielding the request, Computer 2 may insert an entry for Computer 1 into its ARP table for future use.\n\nComputer 1 receives and caches the response information in its ARP table and can now send the packet.<ref>Chappell, Laura A. and Tittel, Ed. ''Guide to TCP/IP, Third Edition''. Thomson Course Technology, 2007, pp. 115-116.</ref>\n\n==ARP probe==\nAn '''ARP probe''' is an ARP request constructed with an all-zero SPA. Before beginning to use an IPv4 address (whether received from manual configuration, DHCP, or some other means), a host implementing this specification must test to see if the address is already in use, by broadcasting ARP probe packets.<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=5227 | author = Cheshire, S. | title = IPv4 Address Conflict Detection | publisher = Internet Engineering Task Force | date = July 2008}}</ref>\n\n==ARP announcements==\nARP may also be used as a simple announcement protocol. This is useful for updating other hosts' mappings of a hardware address when the sender's IP address or MAC address changes. Such an announcement, also called a '''gratuitous ARP''' message, is usually broadcast as an ''ARP request'' containing the SPA in the target field (TPA=SPA), with THA set to zero. An alternative way is to broadcast an ''ARP reply'' with the sender's SHA and SPA duplicated in the target fields (TPA=SPA, THA=SHA).\n\nThe ''ARP request'' and ''ARP reply'' announcements are both standards-based methods,<ref>{{cite web\n        | url = https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5944#section-4.6\n        | author = Perkins, C. \n        | title = RFC 5944 - IP Mobility Support for IPv4, Revised\n        | publisher = Internet Engineering Task Force\n        | date = November 2010\n        | quote=A gratuitous ARP MAY use either an ARP Request or an ARP Reply packet.

The operation code in the announcement may be either request or reply; the ARP standard specifies that the opcode is only processed after the ARP table has been updated from the address fields.<ref>[http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/dhcwg/current/msg03797.html Gratuitous ARP in DHCP vs. IPv4 ACD Draft] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012093401/http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/dhcwg/current/msg03797.html |date=October 12, 2007 }}</ref><ref>[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2002#section-4.6 RFC 2002 Section 4.6]</ref><ref>[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131#section-4.4.1 RFC 2131 DHCP \u2013 Last lines of Section 4.4.1]</ref>\n\nMany operating systems issue an ARP announcement during startup. This helps to resolve problems which would otherwise occur if, for example, a [[Network interface controller|network card]] was recently changed (changing the IP-address-to-MAC-address mapping) and other hosts still have the old mapping in their ARP caches.\n\nARP announcements are also used by some network interfaces to provide load balancing for incoming traffic. In a [[NIC teaming|team]] of network cards, it is used to announce a different MAC address within the team that should receive incoming packets.\n\nARP announcements can be used in the [[Zeroconf]] protocol to allow automatic assignment of a [[link-local address|link-local IP addresses]] to an interface where no other IP address configuration is available. The announcements are used to ensure an address chosen by a host is not in use by other hosts on the network link.<ref>{{IETF RFC|3927}}</ref><!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n==ARP mediation==\n'''ARP mediation''' refers to the process of resolving Layer 2 addresses through a Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) when different resolution protocols are used on the connected circuits, e.g., [[Ethernet]] on one end and [[Frame Relay]] on the other.  In [[IPv4]], each [[Provider Edge]] (PE) device discovers the IP address of the locally attached [[Customer edge|Customer Edge]] (CE) device and distributes that IP address to the corresponding remote PE device.  Then each PE device responds to local ARP requests using the IP address of the remote CE device and the hardware address of the local PE device.  In [[IPv6]], each PE device discovers the IP address of both local and remote CE devices and then intercepts local [[Neighbor Discovery Protocol|Neighbor Discovery]] (ND) and Inverse Neighbor Discovery (IND) packets and forwards them to the remote PE device.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6575 | author = Shah, H. | title = RFC 6575 Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Mediation for IP Interworking of Layer 2 VPNs | publisher = Internet Engineering Task Force | date = June 2012|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|INARP}}\n\n==Inverse ARP and Reverse ARP==\n'''Inverse Address Resolution Protocol''' ('''Inverse ARP''' or '''InARP''') is used to obtain [[network layer]] addresses (for example, [[IP address]]es) of other nodes from [[data link layer]] (Layer 2) addresses. It is primarily used in [[Frame Relay]] ([[DLCI]]) and ATM networks, in which Layer 2 addresses of [[virtual circuit]]s are sometimes obtained from Layer 2 signaling, and the corresponding Layer 3 addresses must be available before those virtual circuits can be used.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2390 | author = T. Bradley | title = RFC 2390 - Inverse Address Resolution Protocol | publisher = Internet Engineering Task Force | date = September 1998|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nSince ARP translates Layer 3 addresses to Layer 2 addresses, InARP may be described as its inverse. In addition, InARP is implemented as a protocol extension to ARP: it uses the same packet format as ARP, but different operation codes.\n\nThe [[Reverse Address Resolution Protocol]] (Reverse ARP or RARP), like InARP, translates Layer 2 addresses to Layer 3 addresses. However, in InARP the requesting station queries the Layer 3 address of another node, whereas RARP is used to obtain the Layer 3 address of the requesting station itself for address configuration purposes. RARP is obsolete; it was replaced by [[BOOTP]], which was later superseded by the [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] (DHCP).<ref>{{cite IETF |last1=Finlayson |last2=Mann |last3=Mogul |last4=Theimer |title=A Reverse Address Resolution Protocol |rfc=903 |publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force |date=June 1984}}</ref>\n\n==ARP spoofing and Proxy ARP==\n[[Image:ARP Spoofing.svg|right|thumb|200px|A successful [[ARP spoofing]] attack allows an attacker to perform a [[man-in-the-middle attack]].]]\n{{main|ARP spoofing}}{{main|Proxy ARP}}\nBecause ARP does not provide methods for authenticating ARP replies on a network, ARP replies can come from systems other than the one with the required Layer 2 address.  An ARP ''proxy'' is a system which answers the ARP request on behalf of another system for which it will forward traffic, normally as a part of the network's design, such as for a dialup internet service. By contrast, in ARP ''spoofing'' the answering system, or ''spoofer'', replies to a request for another system's address with the aim of intercepting data bound for that system.

This mapping is a critical function in the [[Internet protocol suite]]. ARP was defined in 1982 by {{IETF RFC|826}},<ref>{{cite web\n|url       = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc826\n|author    = David C. Plummer\n|title     = RFC 826, An Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol -- or -- Converting Network Protocol Addresses to 48.bit Ethernet Address for Transmission on Ethernet Hardware\n|publisher = Internet Engineering Task Force, Network Working Group\n|date      = November 1982\n}}</ref> which is [[Internet Standard]] STD 37.\n\nARP has been implemented with many combinations of network and data link layer technologies, such as [[IPv4]], [[Chaosnet]], [[DECnet]] and Xerox [[PARC Universal Packet]] (PUP) using [[IEEE 802]] standards, [[FDDI]], [[X.25]], [[Frame Relay]] and [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM). IPv4 over [[IEEE 802.3]] and [[IEEE 802.11]] is the most common usage.\n\nIn [[IPv6|Internet Protocol Version 6]] (IPv6) networks, the functionality of ARP is provided by the [[Neighbor Discovery Protocol]] (NDP).\n\n==Operating scope==\nThe Address Resolution Protocol is a [[request-response]] protocol whose messages are encapsulated by a link layer protocol. It is communicated within the boundaries of a single network, never routed across internetworking nodes. This property places ARP into the [[link layer]] of the [[Internet protocol suite]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122 | author = Braden, R. | title = RFC 1122 - Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Communication Layers | publisher = Internet Engineering Task Force | date = October 1989}}</ref>\n\n==Packet structure==\nThe Address Resolution Protocol uses a simple message format containing one address resolution request or response. The size of the ARP message depends on the link layer and network layer address sizes. The message [[Header_(computing)|header]] specifies the types of network in use at each layer as well as the size of addresses of each. The message header is completed with the operation code for request (1) and reply (2). The payload of the packet consists of four addresses, the hardware and protocol address of the sender and receiver hosts.\n\nThe principal packet structure of ARP packets is shown in the following table which illustrates the case of IPv4 networks running on Ethernet. In this scenario, the packet has 48-bit fields for the sender hardware address (SHA) and target hardware address (THA), and 32-bit fields for the corresponding sender and target protocol addresses (SPA and TPA). The ARP packet size in this case is 28 bytes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align: center; width: 30em;\" border=1\n|+ Internet Protocol (IPv4) over Ethernet ARP packet\n|-\n! colspan=\"1\"|Octet offset\n! colspan=\"8\" width=\"50%\"|0\n! colspan=\"8\" width=\"50%\"|1\n|-\n! 0\n| colspan=\"16\"| Hardware type (HTYPE)\n|-\n! 2\n| colspan=\"16\"| Protocol type (PTYPE)\n|-\n! 4\n| colspan=\"8\"| Hardware address length (HLEN)\n| colspan=\"8\"| Protocol address length (PLEN)\n|-\n! 6\n| colspan=\"16\"| Operation (OPER)\n|-\n! 8\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#f0fff0\"| Sender hardware address (SHA) (first 2 bytes)\n|-\n! 10\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#f0fff0\"| (next 2 bytes)\n|-\n! 12\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#f0fff0\"| (last 2 bytes)\n|-\n! 14\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#d0ffd0\"| Sender protocol address (SPA) (first 2 bytes)\n|-\n! 16\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#d0ffd0\"| (last 2 bytes)\n|-\n! 18\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#f0f0ff\"| Target hardware address (THA) (first 2 bytes)\n|-\n! 20\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#f0f0ff\"| (next 2 bytes)\n|-\n! 22\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#f0f0ff\"| (last 2 bytes)\n|-\n! 24\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#d0d0ff\"| Target protocol address (TPA) (first 2 bytes)\n|-\n! 26\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#d0d0ff\"| (last 2 bytes)\n|}\n\n; Hardware type (HTYPE): This field specifies the network link protocol type.

This appears in the Ethernet frame header when the payload is an ARP packet and is not to be confused with PTYPE, which appears within this encapsulated ARP packet.\n\n==Example==\nTwo computers in an office (Computer 1 and Computer 2) are connected to each other in a [[local area network]] by [[Ethernet]] cables and [[network switches]], with no intervening [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]] or [[Router (computing)|routers]]. Computer 1 has a packet to send to Computer 2. Through [[DNS]], it determines that Computer 2 has the IP address 192.168.0.55.\n\nTo send the message, it also requires Computer 2's [[MAC address]]. First, Computer 1 uses a cached ARP table to look up 192.168.0.55 for any existing records of Computer 2's MAC address (00:eb:24:b2:05:ac). If the MAC address is found, it sends an Ethernet [[frame (networking)|frame]] with destination address 00:eb:24:b2:05:ac, containing the IP packet onto the link. If the cache did not produce a result for 192.168.0.55, Computer 1 has to send a broadcast ARP request message (destination FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF MAC address), which is accepted by all computers on the local network, requesting an answer for 192.168.0.55. \n\nComputer 2 responds with an ARP response message containing its MAC and IP addresses. As part of fielding the request, Computer 2 may insert an entry for Computer 1 into its ARP table for future use.\n\nComputer 1 receives and caches the response information in its ARP table and can now send the packet.<ref>Chappell, Laura A. and Tittel, Ed. ''Guide to TCP/IP, Third Edition''. Thomson Course Technology, 2007, pp. 115-116.</ref>\n\n==ARP probe==\nAn '''ARP probe''' is an ARP request constructed with an all-zero SPA. Before beginning to use an IPv4 address (whether received from manual configuration, DHCP, or some other means), a host implementing this specification must test to see if the address is already in use, by broadcasting ARP probe packets.<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=5227 | author = Cheshire, S. | title = IPv4 Address Conflict Detection | publisher = Internet Engineering Task Force | date = July 2008}}</ref>\n\n==ARP announcements==\nARP may also be used as a simple announcement protocol. This is useful for updating other hosts' mappings of a hardware address when the sender's IP address or MAC address changes. Such an announcement, also called a '''gratuitous ARP''' message, is usually broadcast as an ''ARP request'' containing the SPA in the target field (TPA=SPA), with THA set to zero. An alternative way is to broadcast an ''ARP reply'' with the sender's SHA and SPA duplicated in the target fields (TPA=SPA, THA=SHA).\n\nThe ''ARP request'' and ''ARP reply'' announcements are both standards-based methods,<ref>{{cite web\n        | url = https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5944#section-4.6\n        | author = Perkins, C. \n        | title = RFC 5944 - IP Mobility Support for IPv4, Revised\n        | publisher = Internet Engineering Task Force\n        | date = November 2010\n        | quote=A gratuitous ARP MAY use either an ARP Request or an ARP Reply packet.

The operation code in the announcement may be either request or reply; the ARP standard specifies that the opcode is only processed after the ARP table has been updated from the address fields.<ref>[http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/dhcwg/current/msg03797.html Gratuitous ARP in DHCP vs. IPv4 ACD Draft] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012093401/http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/dhcwg/current/msg03797.html |date=October 12, 2007 }}</ref><ref>[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2002#section-4.6 RFC 2002 Section 4.6]</ref><ref>[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131#section-4.4.1 RFC 2131 DHCP \u2013 Last lines of Section 4.4.1]</ref>\n\nMany operating systems issue an ARP announcement during startup. This helps to resolve problems which would otherwise occur if, for example, a [[Network interface controller|network card]] was recently changed (changing the IP-address-to-MAC-address mapping) and other hosts still have the old mapping in their ARP caches.\n\nARP announcements are also used by some network interfaces to provide load balancing for incoming traffic. In a [[NIC teaming|team]] of network cards, it is used to announce a different MAC address within the team that should receive incoming packets.\n\nARP announcements can be used in the [[Zeroconf]] protocol to allow automatic assignment of a [[link-local address|link-local IP addresses]] to an interface where no other IP address configuration is available. The announcements are used to ensure an address chosen by a host is not in use by other hosts on the network link.<ref>{{IETF RFC|3927}}</ref><!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n==ARP mediation==\n'''ARP mediation''' refers to the process of resolving Layer 2 addresses through a Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) when different resolution protocols are used on the connected circuits, e.g., [[Ethernet]] on one end and [[Frame Relay]] on the other.  In [[IPv4]], each [[Provider Edge]] (PE) device discovers the IP address of the locally attached [[Customer edge|Customer Edge]] (CE) device and distributes that IP address to the corresponding remote PE device.  Then each PE device responds to local ARP requests using the IP address of the remote CE device and the hardware address of the local PE device.  In [[IPv6]], each PE device discovers the IP address of both local and remote CE devices and then intercepts local [[Neighbor Discovery Protocol|Neighbor Discovery]] (ND) and Inverse Neighbor Discovery (IND) packets and forwards them to the remote PE device.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6575 | author = Shah, H. | title = RFC 6575 Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Mediation for IP Interworking of Layer 2 VPNs | publisher = Internet Engineering Task Force | date = June 2012|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|INARP}}\n\n==Inverse ARP and Reverse ARP==\n'''Inverse Address Resolution Protocol''' ('''Inverse ARP''' or '''InARP''') is used to obtain [[network layer]] addresses (for example, [[IP address]]es) of other nodes from [[data link layer]] (Layer 2) addresses. It is primarily used in [[Frame Relay]] ([[DLCI]]) and ATM networks, in which Layer 2 addresses of [[virtual circuit]]s are sometimes obtained from Layer 2 signaling, and the corresponding Layer 3 addresses must be available before those virtual circuits can be used.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2390 | author = T. Bradley | title = RFC 2390 - Inverse Address Resolution Protocol | publisher = Internet Engineering Task Force | date = September 1998|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nSince ARP translates Layer 3 addresses to Layer 2 addresses, InARP may be described as its inverse. In addition, InARP is implemented as a protocol extension to ARP: it uses the same packet format as ARP, but different operation codes.\n\nThe [[Reverse Address Resolution Protocol]] (Reverse ARP or RARP), like InARP, translates Layer 2 addresses to Layer 3 addresses. However, in InARP the requesting station queries the Layer 3 address of another node, whereas RARP is used to obtain the Layer 3 address of the requesting station itself for address configuration purposes. RARP is obsolete; it was replaced by [[BOOTP]], which was later superseded by the [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] (DHCP).<ref>{{cite IETF |last1=Finlayson |last2=Mann |last3=Mogul |last4=Theimer |title=A Reverse Address Resolution Protocol |rfc=903 |publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force |date=June 1984}}</ref>\n\n==ARP spoofing and Proxy ARP==\n[[Image:ARP Spoofing.svg|right|thumb|200px|A successful [[ARP spoofing]] attack allows an attacker to perform a [[man-in-the-middle attack]].]]\n{{main|ARP spoofing}}{{main|Proxy ARP}}\nBecause ARP does not provide methods for authenticating ARP replies on a network, ARP replies can come from systems other than the one with the required Layer 2 address.  An ARP ''proxy'' is a system which answers the ARP request on behalf of another system for which it will forward traffic, normally as a part of the network's design, such as for a dialup internet service. By contrast, in ARP ''spoofing'' the answering system, or ''spoofer'', replies to a request for another system's address with the aim of intercepting data bound for that system. A malicious user may use ARP spoofing to perform a [[man-in-the-middle]] or [[denial-of-service]] attack on other users on the network.

In development since 1881, it became effective on January 1, 1900, and was considered a massive and groundbreaking project.\n\nThe BGB served as a template in several other [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, including [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], the Republic of China, the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Thailand]], [[Brazil]], [[Greece]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Ukraine]]. It also had a major influence on the 1907 [[Swiss Civil Code|Swiss civil code]], the 1942 [[Italian civil code]], the 1966 [[Portuguese Civil Code|Portuguese civil code]], and the 1992 reformed [[Burgerlijk Wetboek|Dutch civil code]].\n\n==History==\n===German Empire===\n[[Image:Reichsgesetzblatt 1896 Seite 195.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Publication in the ''Reich Law Gazette'' on August 24, 1896]]\n\nThe introduction in [[France]] of the [[Napoleonic code]] in 1804 created in Germany a similar desire for obtaining a civil code (despite the opposition of the [[German Historical School|Historical School of Law]] of [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]]), which would systematize and unify the various heterogeneous laws that were in effect in the country. However, the realization of such an attempt during the life of the [[German Confederation]] was difficult because the appropriate legislative body did not exist. \n\nIn 1871, most of the various German states were united into the [[German Empire]]. In the beginning, [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legislative power was held by the individual states, not the Empire (''Reich'') that was composed of those states. An amendment to the constitution passed in 1873 (called \"Lex Miquel-Lasker\" referring to the amendment's sponsors, representatives Johannes von Miquel and Eduard Lasker) transferred this legislative authority to the Reich. Various committees were then formed to draft a bill that was to become a civil law codification for the entire country, replacing the civil law systems of the states. \n\nA first draft code, in 1888, did not meet with favour. A second committee of 22 members, comprising not only jurists but also representatives of financial interests and of the various ideological currents of the time, compiled a second draft. After significant revisions, the BGB was passed by the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] in 1896. It was put into effect on January 1, 1900, and has been the central [[Codification (law)|codification]] of [[Germany]]'s civil law ever since.\n\n===Nazi Germany===\nIn [[Nazi Germany]], there were plans to replace the BGB with a new codification that was planned to be entitled \"[[Volksgesetzbuch]]\" (\"people's code\"), which was meant to reflect Nazi ideology better than the liberal spirit of the BGB, but these plans did not become reality. However, some general principles of the BGB such as the doctrine of [[good faith]] (\u00a7 242 BGB, ''Grundsatz von Treu und Glauben'') were used to interpret the BGB in a Nazi-friendly way. Therefore, the political need to draft a completely new code to match the Nazis' expectations subsided, and instead the many flexible doctrines and principles of the BGB were re-interpreted to meet the (legal) spirit of that time. Especially through the good faith doctrine in \u00a7 242 BGB (see above) or the ''contra bonos mores'' doctrine in \u00a7 138 BGB (''sittenwidriges Rechtsgesch\u00e4ft''), voiding transactions perceived as being ''contra bonos mores'', i.e. against public policy or morals, the Nazis and their willing judges and lawyers were able to direct the law in a way to serve their nationalist ideology.\n\n===Germany from 1945===\nWhen Germany was divided into a democratic [[Capitalism|capitalist]] state in the West and a [[Socialism|socialist]] state in the East after [[World War II]], the BGB continued to regulate the civil law in both parts of Germany. Over time the BGB regulations were replaced in [[East Germany]] by new laws, beginning with a family code in 1966 and ending with a new civil code (''Zivilgesetzbuch'') in 1976 and a contract act in 1982. Since [[German reunification|Germany's reunification]] in 1990, the BGB has again been the codification encompassing the civil law of Germany.\n\nIn West and reunited Germany, the BGB has been amended many times. The most significant changes were made in 2002, when the Law of Obligations, one of the BGB's five main parts, was extensively reformed. Despite its status as a civil code, legal precedent does play a limited role; the way the courts construe and interpret the regulations of the code has changed in many ways, and continues to evolve and develop, due particularly to the high degree of abstraction throughout. In recent years lawmakers have tried to bring some outside legislation \"back into the BGB\". For example, aspects of tenancy legislation, which had been transferred to separate laws such as the ''Mieth\u00f6hengesetz'' (\"Rental Rate Act\") are once again covered by the BGB.\n\nThe BGB continues to be the centerpiece of the German legal system. Other legislation builds on principles defined in the BGB. The German Commercial Code, for example, contains only those rules relevant to merchant partnerships and limited partnerships, as the general rules for partnerships in the BGB also apply.\n\nThe BGB is typical of 19th century legislation and has been criticized from its very beginnings for its lack of social responsibility. Lawmakers and legal practice have improved the system over the years to adapt the BGB in this respect with more or less success. Recently, the influence of EU legislation has been quite strong and the BGB has seen many changes as a result.\n\n==Structure==\nThe BGB follows a modified [[Pandects|pandectist]] structure, derived from [[Roman law]]: like other Roman-influenced codes, it regulates the law of persons, property, family and inheritance, but unlike e.g. the French [[Code civil]] or the [[Austrian Civil Code]], a chapter containing generally applicable regulations is placed first. Consequently, the BGB contains five main parts (or \"books\"):\n*the general part (''allgemeiner Teil''), Sections 1 through 240, comprising regulations that have effect on all the other four parts, such as personhood and civil status, [[Emancipation_of_minors|emancipation]], [[Capacity_(law)|legal capacity]], declarations of will, [[Rescission_(contract_law)|rescission]], formation of contracts, [[Statute of limitations|limitation periods]], and [[Law of agency|agency]]\n*[[law of obligations]] (''Schuldrecht''), Sections 241 through 853, describing contractual obligations and other civil obligations, including [[tort]]s and [[unjust enrichment]]\n*[[property law]] (''Sachenrecht''), Sections 854 through 1296, describing [[Possession (law)|possession]], [[ownership]], other property rights (e.g. [[Servitude in civil law|servitudes]], [[security interest]]s, [[rentcharge]], land charge), and how those rights can be transferred\n*[[family law]] (''Familienrecht''), Sections 1297 through 1921, describing marriage, [[Matrimonial regime|marital property schemes]], [[Legal guardian|legal guardianship]], and other legal relationships among family members\n*[[inheritance]] law (''Erbrecht''), Sections 1922 through 2385, which regulates what happens to a deceased's estate, as well as the [[Will and testament|law of wills]] and contracts concerning succession (''pacta successoria'').\n\n==Abstract system of alienation==\nOne of the BGB's fundamental components is the doctrine of [[Abstraction principle (law)|abstract alienation]] of property (German: ''Abstraktionsprinzip''), and its corollary, the separation doctrine (''Trennungsprinzip''). Derived from the works of the [[Pandectists|pandectist scholar]] [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]], the Code draws a sharp distinction between obligationary agreements (BGB, Book 2), which create enforceable obligations, and \"real\" or [[Alienation_(property_law)|alienation]] agreements (BGB, Book 3), which transfer property rights. In short, the two doctrines state: the owner having an obligation to transfer ownership does not make you the owner, but merely gives you the right to ''demand'' the transfer of ownership. The opposite system, the causal system, is in effect in France and other legal jurisdictions influenced by French law, under which an obligationary agreement is sufficient to transfer ownership; no subsequent conveyance is needed. The German system thus mirrors the English [[common law]] differentiation between ''in rem'' rights and ''in personam'' rights.\n\nThe separation doctrine states that obligationary agreements for alienation and [[Conveyancing|conveyance]]s that effect that alienation must be treated separately and follow their own rules. Also, under the abstract system, alienation does not depend on the validity of the underlying causa of the obligationary contract; in other words, a conveyance is ''sine causa'' (without legal consideration). From this differentiation it follows that a mere obligationary agreement, such as for the sale of property, does not transfer ownership if and until a separate legal instrument, the conveyance, has been drawn up and goes into effect; conversely, the alienation of property based on an invalid obligationary agreement may give rise to a restitutionary obligation for the transferee to restore the property (e.g. [[unjust enrichment]]), but until the property is re-conveyed, again by way of a conveyance, the transferred property is not affected.\n\nUnder the BGB, a sales contract alone, for example, would not lead to the buyer acquiring ownership, but merely impose an obligation on the seller to transfer ownership of the sold property. The seller is then contractually obligated to form another, and separate, agreement to transfer the property. Only once this second agreement is formed, the buyer acquires ownership of the purchased property. Consequently, these two procedures are regulated differently: the contracting parties' obligations are regulated by art. 433, whereas real contracts alienating movable property are provided for under art. 929. The payment of the purchase price (or valuable consideration) is treated likewise.\n\nIn day-to-day business, this differentiation is not needed, because both types of contract would be formed simultaneously by exchanging the property for payment of money. Although the abstract system can be seen as overly technical and contradicting the usual common-sense interpretation of commercial transactions, it is undisputed among the German legal community. The main advantage of the abstract system is its ability to provide a secure legal construction to nearly any financial transaction, however complicated this transaction may be.\n\nA good example is retention of [[Title (property)|title]]. If someone buys something and pays the purchase price in installments, there are two conflicting interests at play: the buyer wants to have the purchased property immediately, whereas the seller wants to secure full payment of the purchase price. Under the abstract system, the BGB has a simple answer: the sales contract obligates the buyer to pay the full price and requires the seller to transfer property upon receipt of the last installment. As the sale obligations and the actual conveyance of ownership are embodied in two separate agreements, it is quite simple to secure both parties' interests. The seller maintains ownership of the property until the last payment, while the buyer merely possesses the property. If the buyer defaults, the seller may repossess the property just like any other owner. \n\nAnother advantage is that should the sales contract be found defective due to some vitiating factor (e.g. fraud, mistake, or undue influence), this would not affect the seller's ownership, thereby making it unnecessary to resell the property for the sake of transferring ownership back to the original seller. Instead, under the rules of [[unjust enrichment]], the buyer is obligated to transfer the property back if possible or otherwise pay compensation.\n\n== Template for other jurisdictions ==\n* In 1896 and 1898, the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] enacted a [[civil code]] (\u6c11\u6cd5, Minp\u014d) based on the first draft of the ''B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch''; with post\u2013World War II modifications, the code remains in effect.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kanamori|first=Shigenari|title=German influences on Japanese Pre-War Constitution and Civil Code|journal=European Journal of Law and Economics|date=1 January 1999|volume=7|issue=1|pages=93\u201395|doi=10.1023/A:1008688209052}}</ref>\n\n==Trivia==\n*No other German law has a larger number of sections: The BGB ends with sec. 2385.\n*Sec. 923 (1) BGB is a perfect [[hexameter]]:\n''Steht auf der Grenze ein Baum, so geb\u00fchren die Fr\u00fcchte und, wenn der Baum gef\u00e4llt wird, auch der Baum den Nachbarn zu gleichen Teilen'' (\"Where there is a tree standing on the boundary, the fruits and, if the tree is felled, the tree itself belong to the neighbours in equal shares.\").\n*Sec. 923 (3) BGB rhymes:\n::''Diese Vorschriften gelten auch | f\u00fcr einen auf der Grenze stehenden Strauch'' (\"These provisions also apply to a bush standing on the boundary.\")\n*Although several other laws are meant to deal with specific legal questions deemed to be outside the scope of a general civil code, the highly specialised ''Bienenrecht'' (law of bees) is found within the property law chapter of the BGB (sections 961\u2013964). This results from the fact that, in legal terms, bees become wild animals as soon as they leave their hive. As wild animals can't be owned by anyone, the said sections provide for the former owner to keep his claim over that swarm. But sections 961\u2013964 are usually described as the least cited regulations in German law, with not a single decision of any higher court pertaining thereto since the BGB entered into force.\n\n==See also==\n*[[French civil code]]\n*[[European civil code]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/ English translation of the BGB (German Civil Code)]\n* [http://bundesrecht.juris.de/bundesrecht/bgb/index.html German BGB] {{in lang|de}} by the [[Federal Ministry of Justice (Germany)|German Ministry of Justice]], [http://bundesrecht.juris.de/englisch_bgb/index.html Books 1, 2, & 3] {{in lang|en}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060208020806/http://www.lumrix.de/bgb.php Search the BGB] {{in lang|de}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050217044633/http://bundesrecht.juris.de/bundesrecht/bgb-infov/index.html BGB-Informationspflichten-Verordnung] {{in lang|de}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101223112315/http://www.bmj.bund.de/Themen/Zivilrecht_108.html Civil law overview] by the [[Federal Ministry of Justice (Germany)|German Ministry of Justice]]{{Dead link|date=July 2013}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051123182303/http://www.jusline.de/BGB.html Commentary on the BGB] {{in lang|de}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Civil codes by country|Europe}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burgerliches Gesetzbuch}}\n[[Category:Civil codes]]\n[[Category:German law]]\n[[Category:1900 in law]]\n[[Category:1900 in Germany]]\n[[Category:Legal codes of Germany|Civil]]\n", "text_old": "{{ITALICTITLE}}\n{{more footnotes|date=November 2013}}\nThe '''''B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch''''' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8b\u028f\u0281\u0261\u0250l\u026a\u00e7\u0259s \u0261\u0259\u02c8z\u025btsbu\u02d0x|lang}}, lit.: 'Civil Law Book'), abbreviated '''BGB''', is the [[civil code]] of [[Germany]].

The main advantage of the abstract system is its ability to provide a secure legal construction to nearly any financial transaction, however complicated this transaction may be.\n\nA good example is retention of [[Title (property)|title]]. If someone buys something and pays the purchase price in installments, there are two conflicting interests at play: the buyer wants to have the purchased property immediately, whereas the seller wants to secure full payment of the purchase price. Under the abstract system, the BGB has a simple answer: the sales contract obligates the buyer to pay the full price and requires the seller to transfer property upon receipt of the last installment. As the sale obligations and the actual conveyance of ownership are embodied in two separate agreements, it is quite simple to secure both parties' interests. The seller maintains ownership of the property until the last payment, while the buyer merely possesses the property. If the buyer defaults, the seller may repossess the property just like any other owner. \n\nAnother advantage is that should the sales contract be found defective due to some vitiating factor (e.g. fraud, mistake, or undue influence), this would not affect the seller's ownership, thereby making it unnecessary to resell the property for the sake of transferring ownership back to the original seller. Instead, under the rules of [[unjust enrichment]], the buyer is obligated to transfer the property back if possible or otherwise pay compensation.\n\n== Template for other jurisdictions ==\n* In 1896 and 1898, the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] enacted a [[civil code]] (\u6c11\u6cd5, Minp\u014d) based on the first draft of the ''B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch''; with post\u2013World War II modifications, the code remains in effect.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kanamori|first=Shigenari|title=German influences on Japanese Pre-War Constitution and Civil Code|journal=European Journal of Law and Economics|date=1 January 1999|volume=7|issue=1|pages=93\u201395|doi=10.1023/A:1008688209052}}</ref>\n\n==Trivia==\n*No other German law has a larger number of sections: The BGB ends with sec. 2385.\n*Sec. 923 (1) BGB is a perfect [[hexameter]]:\n''Steht auf der Grenze ein Baum, so geb\u00fchren die Fr\u00fcchte und, wenn der Baum gef\u00e4llt wird, auch der Baum den Nachbarn zu gleichen Teilen'' (\"Where there is a tree standing on the boundary, the fruits and, if the tree is felled, the tree itself belong to the neighbours in equal shares.\").\n*Sec. 923 (3) BGB rhymes:\n::''Diese Vorschriften gelten auch | f\u00fcr einen auf der Grenze stehenden Strauch'' (\"These provisions also apply to a bush standing on the boundary.\")\n*Although several other laws are meant to deal with specific legal questions deemed to be outside the scope of a general civil code, the highly specialised ''Bienenrecht'' (law of bees) is found within the property law chapter of the BGB (sections 961\u2013964). This results from the fact that, in legal terms, bees become wild animals as soon as they leave their hive. As wild animals can't be owned by anyone, the said sections provide for the former owner to keep his claim over that swarm. But sections 961\u2013964 are usually described as the least cited regulations in German law, with not a single decision of any higher court pertaining thereto since the BGB entered into force.\n\n==See also==\n*[[French civil code]]\n*[[European civil code]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/ English translation of the BGB (German Civil Code)]\n* [http://bundesrecht.juris.de/bundesrecht/bgb/index.html German BGB] {{in lang|de}} by the [[Federal Ministry of Justice (Germany)|German Ministry of Justice]], [http://bundesrecht.juris.de/englisch_bgb/index.html Books 1, 2, & 3] {{in lang|en}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060208020806/http://www.lumrix.de/bgb.php Search the BGB] {{in lang|de}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050217044633/http://bundesrecht.juris.de/bundesrecht/bgb-infov/index.html BGB-Informationspflichten-Verordnung] {{in lang|de}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101223112315/http://www.bmj.bund.de/Themen/Zivilrecht_108.html Civil law overview] by the [[Federal Ministry of Justice (Germany)|German Ministry of Justice]]{{Dead link|date=July 2013}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051123182303/http://www.jusline.de/BGB.html Commentary on the BGB] {{in lang|de}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Civil codes by country|Europe}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burgerliches Gesetzbuch}}\n[[Category:Civil codes]]\n[[Category:German law]]\n[[Category:1900 in law]]\n[[Category:1900 in Germany]]\n", "name_user": "Onwa", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192Category:Legal codes of Germany", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BCrgerliches_Gesetzbuch"}
