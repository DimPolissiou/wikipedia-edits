[[World Snooker]] described his semi-final win as a \"demolition\".<ref name=\"f2N4n\" /> With the victory, Higgins qualified for his first World Championship final in six years and his sixth overall, the first being 19&nbsp;years previously when he won his first world title in [[1998 World Snooker Championship|1998]].<ref name=\"MddJX\" />\n\n===Final===\n[[File:Mark Selby at Snooker German Masters (DerHexer) 2013-01-30 15.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Mark Selby stands looking at a table while he chalks the cue in his left hand. | Defending champion [[Mark Selby]] claimed his third world title in four years by winning the final 18\u201315.]]\nThe final was played on 30 April and 1 May 2017 between first seed Mark Selby and sixth seed John Higgins. It was a best-of-35-frames match, spread over four sessions. This final was a repeat of the [[2007 World Snooker Championship|2007 World Championship]] final, where Higgins had defeated Selby 18\u201313.<ref name=\"dH3vS\" /> In reaching the 2017 final, Higgins became the second-oldest Crucible world finalist at 41 years and 11 months, behind [[Ray Reardon]] who had played in the [[1982 World Snooker Championship|1982]] final aged 49.

In frame 31, he played a shot to roll up to the {{cuegloss|black ball}}; despite his conviction that he had made contact, Selby was told by referee [[Jan Verhaas]] that he had {{cuegloss|miss|missed}} the ball, for which he received a seven-point penalty. Higgins then won the frame to take the score to 16\u201315.<ref name=\"BBCF\" /> After compiling a 131 break in frame 32, Selby won the championship with a break of 75 in frame 33, bringing the final match score to 18\u201315.<ref name=\"BBCS\" /><ref name=\"TnPzv\" />\n\nSelby had achieved his victory after falling behind by six frames at the end of the first day's play.<ref name=\"BBCS\" /> He was the first player to recover from a deficit of six or more frames to win in a World Championship final since [[1985 World Snooker Championship final|1985]], when Dennis Taylor trailed Steve Davis by 0\u20138, and later 1\u20139, before winning the championship.<ref name=\"BBCF\" /> Selby became the fourth player (after Steve Davis, Stephen Hendry, and Ronnie O'Sullivan) to defend the world title in the Crucible era. He also became the third player (after Hendry and Ding Junhui) to win five full ranking titles in a single season, the first player to win the [[China Open (snooker)|China Open]] and the world title back-to-back, and the first player to win over \u00a31,000,000 across the two-year rolling prize money list.<ref name=\"BBCF\" /> In reaching the final, Higgins moved to second in the world rankings, behind Selby.<ref name=\"BBCF\" />\n\n==Main draw==\nThe numbers in parentheses beside some of the players are their seeding ranks.

The [[Commission on Presidential Debates]] (CPD), a [[Bipartisanship|bipartisan]] organization formed in 1987, organized three debates among the major presidential candidates. The first presidential debate for the 2016 election took place on September 26, 2016, and set the record as the most-watched debate in American history, with 84 million viewers. The only vice-presidential debate was held on October 4. The second presidential debate took place on October 9, and the final debate took place on October 19. All CPD debates occurred from approximately 9 p.m. to 10:30&nbsp;p.m. EDT (6 p.m. to 7:30&nbsp;p.m. PDT).\n\nOnly the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Hillary Clinton]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Donald Trump]] met the criteria for inclusion in the debates, and thus were the only two to appear in the debates. Hillary Clinton was considered to have won all three presidential debates{{fact|date=February 2020}} and Mike Pence was considered to have won the Vice-Presidential debate in opinion polls of likely voters.

The [[Commission on Presidential Debates]] (CPD), a [[Bipartisanship|bipartisan]] organization formed in 1987, organized three debates among the major presidential candidates. The first presidential debate for the 2016 election took place on September 26, 2016, and set the record as the most-watched debate in American history, with 84 million viewers. The only vice-presidential debate was held on October 4. The second presidential debate took place on October 9, and the final debate took place on October 19. All CPD debates occurred from approximately 9 p.m. to 10:30&nbsp;p.m. EDT (6 p.m. to 7:30&nbsp;p.m. PDT).\n\nOnly the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Hillary Clinton]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Donald Trump]] met the criteria for inclusion in the debates, and thus were the only two to appear in the debates. Hillary Clinton was considered to have won all three presidential debates{{fact|date=February 2020}} and Mike Pence was considered to have won the Vice-Presidential debate in opinion polls of likely voters. Despite this, Donald Trump won the presidential election held on November 8.\n\n==Debate organizers==\n{{main|Commission on Presidential Debates}}\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates stipulates three criteria for eligibility for the presidential debates: constitutional eligibility to serve as president, appearance on enough ballots to potentially reach 270 [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]], and an average at least 15% on five selected national polls.<ref name=\"CPD_announcement\">{{cite news release |url= http://www.debates.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=58&cntnt01origid=15&cntnt01detailtemplate=newspage&cntnt01returnid=80 |title=Commission on Presidential Debates Announces 2016 Nonpartisan Candidate Selection Criteria; Forms Working Group on Format |publisher=Commission on Presidential Debates |accessdate=August 1, 2016}}</ref>  For the vice-presidential debate, the running mates of the presidential candidates qualifying for the first presidential debate will be invited.<ref name=\"CPD_announcement\" /> By mid-September [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Donald Trump]], [[Gary Johnson]], and [[Jill Stein]] were on enough ballots to reach 270 electoral votes; however, only Clinton and Trump had reached the 15% polling threshold.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/07/27/could-third-parties-determine-this-election/third-party-candidates-need-to-get-on-the-debate-stage-to-make-a-difference |title=Third Party Candidates Need to Get on the Debate Stage to Make a Difference |date=July 27, 2016 |first=Micah L. |last=Sifry | edition = online |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=July 28, 2016}}</ref>  {{As of|2016|8|post=,}} Johnson and Stein had polled as high as 13% and 7%, respectively, and had an average of 8.3% and 3%, respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html | title = General Election: Trump vs. Clinton vs. Johnson vs. Stein |publisher=RealClearPolitics |accessdate=July 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn August 15, the CPD announced that it would use the most recent [[CBS]]/''[[New York Times]]'', [[Fox News]], [[CNN]]/[[Opinion Research Corporation]], [[NBC]]/''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', and [[American Broadcast Company|ABC]]/''[[Washington Post]]'' polls for the debate criteria and that candidates must be at an average of 15% in these polls.<ref>{{cite web|first=Matt |last=Welch |date= August 15, 2016 |url= http://reason.com/blog/2016/08/15/presidential-debate-commission-criteria |title=Presidential Debate Commission Criteria Is Both Good News and Bad News for Gary Johnson \u2013 Hit & Run |work= Reason|accessdate= August 17, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Stelter |first=Brian |url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/15/media/commission-on-presidential-debates-polls/ |title=Commission on Presidential Debates reveals how it'll determine invitees \u2013 Aug. 15, 2016 |publisher=CNN|date=June 23, 2016 |accessdate=August 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn September 16, the commission announced the official invitation of both Clinton and Trump to participate in the first debate to be held on September 26 at [[Hofstra University]], but Johnson and Stein did not meet the established criteria, and would not be participants in the debate.<ref name=\"CPDInvitesClintonTrump\">{{cite news|title=CPD Invites Hillary Clinton and Donald J.

Their father, Song Tingfen, was a Confucian scholar and the progeny of the famous poet Song Zhiwen (c. 656-c. 712) of the early Tang Dynasty. The father taught the five daughters literature, poetry and Confucian classics since they were young, and taught them well. Later, all of the five sisters aspired to devote their life to learning and to bring honor to the family with their knowledge and accomplishment, and all expressed their will not to marry.

The Emperor, having read the letter from Li Baozhen, immediately asked the five sisters to be presented to the imperial palace to be tested by the Emperor himself. The Emperor asked about poetry, literature, Confucian classics and history, and was also much impressed by the learning of the five girls. As such, the Emperor brought the five girls to the imperial palace. However, he never made them his concubines. Instead, he titled them ''Interior Scholars'' and respected their learning, elegance and aspiration.

In 1981 he received his DPhil from Merton College, his thesis topic being \"The Messiah and the People of God: A Study in Pauline Theology with Particular Reference to the Argument of the Epistle to the Romans\".

Though critical of the North American church's overemphasis on \"going to heaven when you die\" and underemphasis on the resurrection from the dead, he does not deny the teaching that a person's soul lives on after death.  He advocates a reunion of [[soteriology]] and [[ecclesiology]], commenting that such a connection is often neglected in [[Protestantism]]. In addition, he is critical of various popular theological ideas, such as the [[dispensationalism|dispensationalist]] doctrine of the [[rapture]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_BR_Farewell_Rapture.htm |magazine=Bible Review|publisher= NT Wright Page|date=August 2001|title=Farewell to the rapture|accessdate = 20 November 2011}} ''Cf.'' {{cite book|first=NT|last=Wright |title = Surprised by hope: Rethinking heaven, the resurrection, and the mission of the church|isbn=978-0-06-155182-6 |year=2008|quote=When Paul speaks of 'meeting' the Lord 'in the air,' the point is precisely not\u2014as in the popular rapture theology\u2014that the saved believers would then stay up in the air somewhere. The point is that, having gone out to meet their returning Lord, they will escort him royally into his domain, that is, back to the place they have come from.  Even when we realise that this is highly charged metaphor, not literal description, the meaning is the same as in the parallel in Philippians 3:20. Being citizens of heaven, as the Philippians would know, doesn't mean that one is expecting go back to the mother city but rather means that one is expecting the emperor to come from the mother city to give the colony its full dignity, to rescue it if need he, to subdue local enemies and put everything to rights}}</ref>\n\n===New perspective on Paul===\nWright follows the [[New Perspective on Paul]] interpretation of the Pauline letters.<ref>{{cite journal|last =Allman | first = James| title = Gaining Perspective on the New Perspective on Paul | journal=Bibliotheca Sacra|date=January 2013|volume=170|issue = 677 |page=51}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/912c0ad67c4597cb23cdcdb16b2fcbd60b01572e|title = Paul and the Introspective Conscience of the West| last = Stendahl | first = Krister | year = 1963|journal = Harvard Theological Review|doi = 10.1017/S0017816000024779}}</ref> Wright offers that Paul cannot be ignored by any serious Christian and that, through this central place within the New Testament canon, Paul has come to be abused, misunderstood, imposed upon, and approached with incorrect or inappropriate questions about the Christian faith.{{Sfn | Wright | 1997 |p = 51}} Wright offers, \"Paul in the twentieth century, then, has been used and abused much as in the first. Can we, as the century draws towards its close, listen a bit more closely to him? Can we somehow repent of the ways we have mishandled him and respect his own way of doing things a bit more?\"{{Sfn | Wright | 1997 | p = 23}}\n\nThis question reflects the key consideration for the New Perspective on Paul and a fundamental aim of Wright's scholarship: to allow the apostle Paul to speak for himself without imposing modern considerations and questions upon him and in so doing, seeking to ascertain what St.&nbsp;Paul was really trying to say to the people he was writing to.{{Sfn | Wright | 1997 | p =8}} From this, Wright contends that by examining the Pauline corpus through this unique perspective, difficult passages within the text become illuminated in new ways, his letters gain coherence both in their particularities as well as with one another, and it provides an overall picture of what Paul was about, without doing violence to the little details within the letters.{{Sfn | Wright | 1997 | p = 12}}\n\nThe content of the new perspective can be traced to the work of [[E. P. Sanders]] and his book ''Paul and Palestinian Judaism''.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Paul and Palestinian Judaism|last = Sanders|first = EP | author-link = E. P. Sanders | publisher = Fortress|year = 1977}}</ref> In this 1977 work, Sanders argued that the prevailing view of first-century Judaism in the New Testament was inaccurate. He described it instead as \"covenantal nomism\", which emphasised God's election of a people and adherence to the Torah as a way of \"staying in\" the religion (rather than a way of \"getting in\").  Pauline scholars such as Wright who adhere to Sanders' reading of Judaism see Paul's \"problem\" with law adherence not as a rejection of the attitude that God's favour depended upon the fulfilment of the requirements of the law, but rather was a rejection of the law's function of dividing Jew from Gentile.\n\n===Paul and justification===\nIn speaking on justification, Wright contends, \u201cthe discussions of justification in much of the history of the church, certainly since Augustine, got off on the wrong foot \u2013 at least in terms of understanding Paul \u2013 and they have stayed there ever since.\u201d{{Sfn | Wright | 1997 | p = 115}}  In this way, the Church, according to Wright, has subsumed discussions surrounding the reconciliation of man to God under the label of justification, which has subsequently given the concept an emphasis quite absent from what he believes is found within the New Testament.{{Sfn | Wright | 1997 | p = 115}}  This leads Wright to argue that this incorrect perception of justification has done violence to the text for hundreds of years{{Sfn | Wright | 1997 | p = 117}} and that the text itself should be the starting point in determining what Paul seeks to say about justification.{{Sfn | Wright | 1997 | p = 113}}\n\nThrough his attempt of returning to the text to allow Paul to speak for himself as he suggests, Wright offers a definition of what he believes the apostle means by \u2018justification,\u2019 which is contrary to popular belief.  In crafting said definition, the interpreter identifies three pieces, which he believes to be vital to this consideration: that justification is dependent upon covenant language, that it utilises law-court language, functioning within the covenantal setting as a strong explanatory metaphor of justification, and that it cannot be understood within a Pauline context as separate from eschatology.{{Sfn | Wright | 1997 | p=117\u201318}}  Through the inclusion of covenant language, justification alludes to the presence of sin and wickedness in the world and the way in which the covenant was instituted to bring about salvation.  Within this context, the law-court metaphorical language acknowledges God's role as judge who is to put the world to rights, to deal with evil and to restore justice and order to the cosmos.  Finally, Wright's definition of \u2018justification\u2019 within Paul's letters acknowledges that the term is not associated, as has commonly been perceived, with one's personal needs necessary to attain salvation, but instead with what marked someone as a member of God's people.\n\n===Secular utopianism===\nIn 2008, Wright criticised \"secular utopianism\", accusing it of advocating \"the right to kill unborn children and surplus old people\".<ref>{{cite news|title=In quotes: The ethics of embryos|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7310496.stm |work=BBC News|date=24 March 2008|accessdate=11 November 2008}}</ref> ''Times'' columnist [[David Aaronovitch]] challenged Wright specifically to substantiate his claim that any secular group does indeed advocate the killing of elderly people, leading to an ongoing exchange in which Wright held to his main point.<ref>{{Cite news|first=David|last=Aaronovitch |authorlink=David Aaronovitch|title=Wicked untruths from the Church |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article3613649.ece|work=[[The Times]]|date=25 March 2008|accessdate=11 November 2008|location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509164034/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article3613649.ece|archivedate=9 May 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Bishops speak out on embryos |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article3627715.ece|work=The Times|date=26 March 2008|accessdate=11 November 2008|location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512092752/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article3627715.ece|archivedate=12 May 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|first=David|last=Aaronovitch|authorlink=David Aaronovitch|title=Who wants to kill the elderly?|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article3648835.ece |work=The Times|date=31 March 2008|accessdate=11 November 2008|location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516192450/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article3648835.ece|archivedate=16 May 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|first=Tom|last=Wright |title=Euthanasia \u2013 a murky moral world|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article3669714.ece|work=The Times|date=3 April 2008|accessdate=11 November 2008|location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706194944/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article3669714.ece|archivedate=6 July 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Historical Jesus===\nRegarding the [[historical Jesus]], Wright follows the \"thoroughgoing [[eschatology]]\" tradition of [[Albert Schweitzer]] against the \"thoroughgoing [[scepticism]]\" of [[William Wrede]] and the [[Jesus Seminar]],<ref name=\"Stewart 2008 p. 20\">{{cite book | last=Stewart | first=R.B. | title=The Quest of the Hermeneutical Jesus: The Impact of Hermeneutics on the Jesus Research of John Dominic Crossan and N.

Similarly, Wright speaks of Jesus as 'doubly', 'multiply', 'thoroughly', and 'deeply' subversive, while at the same time distancing Jesus from other known seditious and revolutionary movements within first-century Palestine.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Robert |last=Myles |title=The Fetish for a Subversive Jesus |journal=Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus|year=2016 |pages=52\u201370 |url=https://www.academia.edu/24587788}}</ref> In some ways his views are similar to those of such scholars as [[E.

The [[Jesus Seminar]]'s [[Marcus Borg]], with whom Wright shared mutual admiration and respect, co-authored with Wright ''The Meaning of Jesus: Two Visions'' to elaborate their contrasting opinions.{{Sfn | Wright |Borg | 1999}}  In 2005, at the Greer-Heard Point-Counterpoint Forum, Wright discussed the historicity of Jesus' resurrection with Jesus Seminar co-founder [[John Dominic Crossan]].  Wright and Crossan, who also have mutual admiration, hold very different opinions on this foundational Christian doctrine. For Crossan, the resurrection of Jesus is a theological interpretation of events by the writers of the New Testament. For Wright, however, the resurrection is a historical event\u2014coherent with the worldview of [[Second Temple]] Judaism\u2014fundamental to the New Testament.<ref>{{Cite book| first= Robert B | last= Stewart | title = Intelligent design: William A.

Smith, S.J., Smith argues that the Pauline texts cited by Wright do not support his view that the resurrected body was \"robustly physical\". Nor do the Gospel stories of the Resurrection appearances. \"The 'robustly physical' character of the body of risen Jesus in the gospel resurrection narratives belongs to the first Christians' representation of the appearances, not to the original experience of the appearance itself in its original nature.\" Smith also suggests that Wright has not recognised that a resurrection body cannot be physically present in space and time.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=J |title=N.T.

Though critical of the North American church's overemphasis on \"going to heaven when you die\" and underemphasis on the resurrection from the dead, he does not deny the teaching that a person's soul lives on after death.  He advocates a reunion of [[soteriology]] and [[ecclesiology]], commenting that such a connection is often neglected in [[Protestantism]]. In addition, he is critical of various popular theological ideas, such as the [[dispensationalism|dispensationalist]] doctrine of the [[rapture]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_BR_Farewell_Rapture.htm |magazine=Bible Review|publisher= NT Wright Page|date=August 2001|title=Farewell to the rapture|accessdate = 20 November 2011}} ''Cf.'' {{cite book|first=NT|last=Wright |title = Surprised by hope: Rethinking heaven, the resurrection, and the mission of the church|isbn=978-0-06-155182-6 |year=2008|quote=When Paul speaks of 'meeting' the Lord 'in the air,' the point is precisely not\u2014as in the popular rapture theology\u2014that the saved believers would then stay up in the air somewhere. The point is that, having gone out to meet their returning Lord, they will escort him royally into his domain, that is, back to the place they have come from.  Even when we realise that this is highly charged metaphor, not literal description, the meaning is the same as in the parallel in Philippians 3:20. Being citizens of heaven, as the Philippians would know, doesn't mean that one is expecting go back to the mother city but rather means that one is expecting the emperor to come from the mother city to give the colony its full dignity, to rescue it if need he, to subdue local enemies and put everything to rights}}</ref>\n\n===New perspective on Paul===\nWright follows the [[New Perspective on Paul]] interpretation of the Pauline letters.<ref>{{cite journal|last =Allman | first = James| title = Gaining Perspective on the New Perspective on Paul | journal=Bibliotheca Sacra|date=January 2013|volume=170|issue = 677 |page=51}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/912c0ad67c4597cb23cdcdb16b2fcbd60b01572e|title = Paul and the Introspective Conscience of the West| last = Stendahl | first = Krister | year = 1963|journal = Harvard Theological Review|doi = 10.1017/S0017816000024779}}</ref> Wright offers that Paul cannot be ignored by any serious Christian and that, through this central place within the New Testament canon, Paul has come to be abused, misunderstood, imposed upon, and approached with incorrect or inappropriate questions about the Christian faith.{{Sfn | Wright | 1997 |p = 51}} Wright offers, \"Paul in the twentieth century, then, has been used and abused much as in the first. Can we, as the century draws towards its close, listen a bit more closely to him? Can we somehow repent of the ways we have mishandled him and respect his own way of doing things a bit more?\"{{Sfn | Wright | 1997 | p = 23}}\n\nThis question reflects the key consideration for the New Perspective on Paul and a fundamental aim of Wright's scholarship: to allow the apostle Paul to speak for himself without imposing modern considerations and questions upon him and in so doing, seeking to ascertain what St.&nbsp;Paul was really trying to say to the people he was writing to.{{Sfn | Wright | 1997 | p =8}} From this, Wright contends that by examining the Pauline corpus through this unique perspective, difficult passages within the text become illuminated in new ways, his letters gain coherence both in their particularities as well as with one another, and it provides an overall picture of what Paul was about, without doing violence to the little details within the letters.{{Sfn | Wright | 1997 | p = 12}}\n\nThe content of the new perspective can be traced to the work of [[E. P. Sanders]] and his book ''Paul and Palestinian Judaism''.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Paul and Palestinian Judaism|last = Sanders|first = EP | author-link = E. P. Sanders | publisher = Fortress|year = 1977}}</ref> In this 1977 work, Sanders argued that the prevailing view of first-century Judaism in the New Testament was inaccurate. He described it instead as \"covenantal nomism\", which emphasised God's election of a people and adherence to the Torah as a way of \"staying in\" the religion (rather than a way of \"getting in\").  Pauline scholars such as Wright who adhere to Sanders' reading of Judaism see Paul's \"problem\" with law adherence not as a rejection of the attitude that God's favour depended upon the fulfilment of the requirements of the law, but rather was a rejection of the law's function of dividing Jew from Gentile.\n\n===Paul and justification===\nIn speaking on justification, Wright contends, \u201cthe discussions of justification in much of the history of the church, certainly since Augustine, got off on the wrong foot \u2013 at least in terms of understanding Paul \u2013 and they have stayed there ever since.\u201d{{Sfn | Wright | 1997 | p = 115}}  In this way, the Church, according to Wright, has subsumed discussions surrounding the reconciliation of man to God under the label of justification, which has subsequently given the concept an emphasis quite absent from what he believes is found within the New Testament.{{Sfn | Wright | 1997 | p = 115}}  This leads Wright to argue that this incorrect perception of justification has done violence to the text for hundreds of years{{Sfn | Wright | 1997 | p = 117}} and that the text itself should be the starting point in determining what Paul seeks to say about justification.{{Sfn | Wright | 1997 | p = 113}}\n\nThrough his attempt of returning to the text to allow Paul to speak for himself as he suggests, Wright offers a definition of what he believes the apostle means by \u2018justification,\u2019 which is contrary to popular belief.  In crafting said definition, the interpreter identifies three pieces, which he believes to be vital to this consideration: that justification is dependent upon covenant language, that it utilises law-court language, functioning within the covenantal setting as a strong explanatory metaphor of justification, and that it cannot be understood within a Pauline context as separate from eschatology.{{Sfn | Wright | 1997 | p=117\u201318}}  Through the inclusion of covenant language, justification alludes to the presence of sin and wickedness in the world and the way in which the covenant was instituted to bring about salvation.  Within this context, the law-court metaphorical language acknowledges God's role as judge who is to put the world to rights, to deal with evil and to restore justice and order to the cosmos.  Finally, Wright's definition of \u2018justification\u2019 within Paul's letters acknowledges that the term is not associated, as has commonly been perceived, with one's personal needs necessary to attain salvation, but instead with what marked someone as a member of God's people.\n\n===Secular utopianism===\nIn 2008, Wright criticised \"secular utopianism\", accusing it of advocating \"the right to kill unborn children and surplus old people\".<ref>{{cite news|title=In quotes: The ethics of embryos|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7310496.stm |work=BBC News|date=24 March 2008|accessdate=11 November 2008}}</ref> ''Times'' columnist [[David Aaronovitch]] challenged Wright specifically to substantiate his claim that any secular group does indeed advocate the killing of elderly people, leading to an ongoing exchange in which Wright held to his main point.<ref>{{Cite news|first=David|last=Aaronovitch |authorlink=David Aaronovitch|title=Wicked untruths from the Church |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article3613649.ece|work=[[The Times]]|date=25 March 2008|accessdate=11 November 2008|location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509164034/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article3613649.ece|archivedate=9 May 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Bishops speak out on embryos |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article3627715.ece|work=The Times|date=26 March 2008|accessdate=11 November 2008|location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512092752/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article3627715.ece|archivedate=12 May 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|first=David|last=Aaronovitch|authorlink=David Aaronovitch|title=Who wants to kill the elderly?|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article3648835.ece |work=The Times|date=31 March 2008|accessdate=11 November 2008|location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516192450/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article3648835.ece|archivedate=16 May 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|first=Tom|last=Wright |title=Euthanasia \u2013 a murky moral world|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article3669714.ece|work=The Times|date=3 April 2008|accessdate=11 November 2008|location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706194944/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article3669714.ece|archivedate=6 July 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Historical Jesus===\nRegarding the [[historical Jesus]], Wright follows the \"thoroughgoing [[eschatology]]\" tradition of [[Albert Schweitzer]] against the \"thoroughgoing [[scepticism]]\" of [[William Wrede]] and the [[Jesus Seminar]],<ref name=\"Stewart 2008 p. 20\">{{cite book | last=Stewart | first=R.B. | title=The Quest of the Hermeneutical Jesus: The Impact of Hermeneutics on the Jesus Research of John Dominic Crossan and N.

The [[Jesus Seminar]]'s [[Marcus Borg]], with whom Wright shared mutual admiration and respect, co-authored with Wright ''The Meaning of Jesus: Two Visions'' to elaborate their contrasting opinions.{{Sfn | Wright |Borg | 1999}}  In 2005, at the Greer-Heard Point-Counterpoint Forum, Wright discussed the historicity of Jesus' resurrection with Jesus Seminar co-founder [[John Dominic Crossan]].  Wright and Crossan, who also have mutual admiration, hold very different opinions on this foundational Christian doctrine. For Crossan, the resurrection of Jesus is a theological interpretation of events by the writers of the New Testament. For Wright, however, the resurrection is a historical event\u2014coherent with the worldview of [[Second Temple]] Judaism\u2014fundamental to the New Testament.<ref>{{Cite book| first= Robert B | last= Stewart | title = Intelligent design: William A.

It's inerrant and so on. But, then, they pay no attention to what the Bible actually says.

{"title_page": "Constitutional crisis", "text_new": "{{short description|Problem or conflict in the function of a government that a political constitution or other fundamental governing law is perceived to be unable to resolve}}\n\nIn [[political science]], a  '''constitutional crisis''' is a problem or conflict in the function of a government that the [[constitution|political constitution]] or other fundamental governing law is perceived to be unable to resolve. There are several variations to this definition. For instance, one describes it as the crisis that arises out of the failure, or at least a strong risk of failure, of a constitution to perform its central functions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Constitutions in the Global Financial Crisis: A Comparative Analysis|last=Contiades|first=Xenophon|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781409466314|location=Oxon|pages=53}}</ref> The crisis may arise from a variety of possible causes. For example, a government may want to pass a law contrary to its constitution; the constitution may fail to provide a clear answer for a specific situation; the constitution may be clear but it may be politically infeasible to follow it; the government institutions themselves may falter or fail to live up to what the law prescribes them to be; or officials in the government may justify avoiding dealing with a serious problem based on narrow interpretations of the law.<ref>{{cite web | title=The 4 Types of Constitutional Crises | author1=Azari, Julia |author-link1=Julia Azari | author2=Masket, Seth | date=February 9, 2017 | url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/constitutional-crisis/ | website=FiveThirtyEight}}</ref><ref name=\"Graber (2015), p. 244\">{{cite book | title=A New Introduction to American Constitutionalism | author=Graber, Mark A. | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2015 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHYRDAAAQBAJ | page=244}}</ref> Specific examples include the South African [[Coloured vote constitutional crisis]] in the 1950s, the [[Secession in the United States|secession of the southern U.S. states]] in 1860 and 1861, the controversial [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|dismissal of the Australian Federal government]] in 1975 and the [[2007 Ukrainian political crisis|2007 Ukrainian crisis]].\n\nConstitutional crises may arise from conflicts between different branches of government, conflicts between central and local governments, or simply conflicts among various factions within society. In the course of government, the crisis results when one or more of the parties to a [[Controversy|political dispute]] willfully chooses to violate a law of the [[constitution]]; or to flout an unwritten [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]]; or to dispute the correct, legal interpretation of the violated constitutional law or of the flouted political custom. This was demonstrated by the so-called [[XYZ Affair]], which involved the bribery of French officials by a contingent of American commissioners who were sent to preserve peace between [[France]] and the United States.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=From Many, One: Readings in American Political and Social Thought|last=Sinopoli|first=Richard|publisher=Georgetown University Press|year=1996|isbn=0878406263|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=185}}</ref> The incident was published in the American press and created a foreign policy crisis, which precipitated the passage of the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]]. Opposition to these acts in the form of the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions|Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions]] cited that they violated freedom of speech and exhorted states to refuse their enforcement since they violated the Constitution.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMoreover, if the crisis arises because the constitution is legally ambiguous, the ultimate resolution usually establishes the legal precedent to resolve future crises of constitutional administration. Such was the case in the United States presidential succession of [[John Tyler]], which established that a successor to the presidency assumes the office without any limitation.\n\nPolitically, a constitutional crisis can lead to administrative paralysis and eventual collapse of the government, the loss of [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]], or to [[civil war]]. A constitutional crisis is distinct from a [[rebellion]], which occurs when political factions ''outside'' a government challenge the government's sovereignty, as in a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' or a [[revolution]] led by the military or by civilians.\n\n==Africa==\n\n===Democratic Republic of the Congo===\n[[File:PatricelumumbaIISG.jpg|thumb|220px|Patrice Lumumba]]\n*President [[Joseph Kasavubu]] and Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]] attempted to dismiss each other in September 1960.

Its attempt to reverse the decision in an ''ad hoc'' court was also overturned, after which the party used reforms to the Senate to pass the measure legally.\n\n==Asia==\n\n===Iran===\n*[[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi]]'s 1953 dismissal of Prime Minister [[Mohammed Mossadegh]] and Mossadegh's subsequent refusal to quit the office\n\n===Malaysia===\n* [[1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis]] started by a group of politicians who were dissatisfied towards [[Stephen Kalong Ningkan]]'s leadership as chief minister. Ningkan was later removed from the chief minister post by the Governor of Sarawak in June 1966.\n* The [[1983 Malaysian constitutional crisis]] saw [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] [[Mahathir bin Mohamad|Mahathir]] pushing forward an amendment of Article 66 of the Federal Constitution, which set the time limit of the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong|Malaysian monarch]] to veto a law within 30 days. The proposals generated a great deal of controversy between the government and the monarchy, of which the former had to launch a public campaign to pressure the monarchy to assent to the amendments.{{clarify|date=November 2010}}\n* The [[1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis]] was a series of events that began with the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) party elections in 1987 and ended with the suspension and the eventual removal of [[Lord President of the Supreme Court]] [[Malay titles#Tun|Tun]] [[Salleh Abas]] from his seat.\n* The [[1993 amendments to the Constitution of Malaysia]] (by some interpretations a constitutional crisis) involved the limitation of monarchs' [[sovereign immunity|legal immunity]] in Malaysia. Prime Minister [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] successfully amended the constitution to make the monarchies more accountable to their actions.\n*The [[2009 Perak constitutional crisis]] occurred in the Malaysian state of [[Perak]] when [[party switching|party defections]] caused the state ruling coalition, [[Pakatan Rakyat]], to lose its majority in the [[Dewan Undangan Negeri|state assembly]]. The [[Sultan of Perak]] refused to dissolve the state assembly when requested and dismissed the [[Menteri Besar]] (Chief Minister) in the absence of a [[motion of no confidence|no confidence]] vote.{{clarify|date=November 2010}}\n* The [[2020 Malaysian constitutional crisis]] was a series of events that began when Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] and associates attempted to replace his coalition partners and form a unity government supported by opposition parties.\n\n===Pakistan===\n*Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Sajjad Ali Shah]] clashed repeatedly with Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] in late 1997, accusing him of undermining the court's independence. After Ali Shah suspended a constitutional amendment that prevented dismissal of the prime minister, Sharif ordered President [[Farooq Leghari]] to appoint a new chief justice. When Leghari refused, Sharif considered [[impeach]]ing him, but backed down after a warning from the armed forces. Faced with a choice of accepting Sharif's demands or dismissing him, Leghari resigned. Ali Shah resigned shortly afterward, establishing Sharif's dominance.\n\n===Thailand===\n*In March 2006, 60 seats of the [[National Assembly of Thailand]] could not be elected, and Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] refused to resign. The judicial system did not lead up to Supreme Court as the top arbitrator so there were inconsistent rulings from the civil, criminal, administrative, and constitutional Courts.{{clarify|date=July 2012}}\n\n===Sri Lanka===\n{{main|2018 Sri Lankan constitutional crisis}}\n*On the 26th of October 2018, President [[Maithripala Sirisena]] appointed former President [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]] as Prime Minister and dismissed incumbent Prime Minister [[Ranil Wickremesinghe]]. Ranil Wickremesing refused to accept the dismissal while stating that it was unconstitutional and undemocratic.\n\n==Europe==\n\n===Belgium===\n*The [[Royal Question]] over the status of king [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III]] began when he acted against [[advice (constitutional)|ministerial advice]] during the [[Battle of Belgium|1940 Nazi invasion]] and refused to join [[Belgian government in exile|the government in exile]]. Deported to Germany before [[Liberation of Belgium|Belgium's 1944 liberation]], Leopold's return was narrowly approved in [[1950 Belgian monarchy referendum|a 1950 referendum]] but a subsequent general strike prompted him to abdicate the following year.\n*In 1990, [[Baudouin I of Belgium|King Baudouin]] refused routine [[Royal Assent]] to the law on [[abortion in Belgium]].  The issue was resolved by (constitutionally but controversially) having Baudouin temporarily declared incapable of reigning, the Council of Ministers giving assent as provided for in the [[Belgian Constitution]], and Baudouin declared capable again.\n\n===Denmark===\n*The [[Easter Crisis of 1920]], when [[Christian X of Denmark|King Christian X]] of [[Denmark]] dismissed the country's cabinet.\n\n===England===\n{{hatnote|For events after the formation of the United Kingdom in 1707, see {{section link|#United Kingdom}} below.}}\n\n[[Image:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|thumb|220px|right|''John of England signs Magna Carta''.

Immediately, John repudiated Magna Carta, leading to the [[First Barons' War]].\n*The [[History of the Church of England#Separation from Papal authority|Break with Rome]]: [[Pope Clement VII]]'s refusal to annul King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s first marriage impeded the king's efforts to produce a male heir. Henry repudiated the Pope's ecclesiastical authority within England and required all officials to recognize him as [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]].\n*[[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]'s insistence on the [[Divine Right of Kings]], manifest in his [[Personal Rule]] from 1629 to 1640, and leading directly to the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]].\n*The [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688\u201389: The flight of [[James II of England|King James II/VII]] from the country left no king in his place to rule England or Scotland or to summon a [[Parliament]].  When [[William III of England|King William]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary]] jointly replaced him there was therefore no legally recognised Parliament to legitimise their irregular succession to the throne. This led to the [[Crown and Parliament Recognition Act 1689]].\n\n===Estonia===\n*The early 1930s political crisis in [[Estonia]] as two constitutional reforms had been rejected by the electorate and only the [[October 1933 Estonian constitutional referendum|third referendum]] in 1933 succeeded in replacing the [[parliamentary republic]] with the [[presidential republic]]. The succeeding constitutional reform was proposed by the [[Vaps Movement]], who were however kept from power by the [[self-coup]] of [[Prime Minister of Estonia|Prime Minister]] [[Konstantin P\u00e4ts]], who was supported by the [[Riigikogu]].\n\n===France===\n*The Brittany Affair of 1765: The king's court in Brittany forbade collection of taxes to which the provincial [[The Estates|Estates]] did not consent. After King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] annulled the court's decree, most of its members resigned. The chief prosecutor, [[Louis-Ren\u00e9 de Caradeuc de La Chalotais]], was accused of writing letters denouncing the king's action and charged with treason. A court convened to try La Chalotais reached no conclusion due to questions of jurisdiction and the weakness of the evidence. The king then transferred the case to his own council, further inflaming fears of absolutism to the point that he was obligated to release La Chalotais and yield to the provincial authorities.\n*The [[16 May 1877 crisis]]: President [[Patrice de Mac-Mahon]] dismissed Prime Minister [[Jules Simon]] and named [[Albert de Broglie]] to replace him. The [[National Assembly]] refused to recognize the new government and a crisis, which ended with the dissolution of the Assembly and new elections, ensued.\n\n===Germany===\n* In the [[Weimar Republic]], for several years the country was governed with the help of [[enabling act]]s and emergency decrees. The crisis became dramatic in 1932, when the [[Nazi Party]] and [[Communist Party of Germany]] had together a majority in the parliament. Any government, installed by the [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|Reich President]], was likely to be dismissed by the parliament. The crisis ended in a Nazi and conservative coalition government and then Nazi dictatorship. The [[Weimar Constitution]] was not abolished, but weakened to the point of irrelevance.\n* In 1962 [[Spiegel affair]], [[Franz Josef Strauss]], federal minister of defense, tried to repress media freedom with governmental resources and accused Spiegel employees of treason after an article of [[Der Spiegel|Spiegel]] had exposed the incompetence of German ministry of defense confronting the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1966, [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] issued a groundbreaking ruling concerning freedom of the press. The incident caused the first mass demonstrations and public protests and helped Germany remove many authoritarian features still retained following the end of World War II, marking a turning point in Germany values as ordinary people rejected authoritarian outlook in favor of democratic values.{{citation needed|date=September 2019|reason=Please provide sources that discuss this event as a constitutional crisis.}}\n\n===Malta===\n* The [[1981 Maltese general election|1981 election]], when, due to a quirk in that country's [[Single Transferable Vote]] system, the party winning more than half the votes won fewer than half the seats in parliament.\n\n===Order of Malta===\n* In December 2016 [[Matthew Festing]], Grand Master of the [[Order of Malta]], dismissed its Grand Chancellor [[Albrecht von Boeselager]] for allowing the distribution of contraceptives in violation of the Catholic Church's policy. Boeslanger protested that the dismissal was irregular under the Order's constitution and appealed to [[Pope Francis]]. Francis ordered an investigation of the dispute, then demanded and received Festing's resignation. The Order elected [[Giacomo dalla Torre del Tempio di Sanguinetto]] as Festing's successor on a program of constitutional reform and promoting religious obedience.\n\n===Norway===\n*[[Impeachment (Norway)|Impeachment]] of prime minister Selmer's cabinet in 1883/1884 regarding the king's right to veto changes to the constitution, and establishment of an ad-hoc parliamentary practice until amended to the constitution in 2007.<ref>[[Monarchy of Norway#Council of State]]{{Better source|reason=self-ref|date=August 2016}}</ref><ref>[[Storting]]{{Better source|reason=self-ref|date=August 2016}}</ref><ref>http://www.liberaleren.no/2007/02/20/parlamentarismen-inn-i-grunnloven/</ref>\n*[[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905]]{{Elucidate|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Rome===\n* [[Caesar's Civil War]]: In 50 BC the [[Roman Senate]] ordered [[Julius Caesar]], a popular military general and territorial governor, to disband his army and return to Rome.

The Senate retreated before his advance, allowing him to establish a dictatorship that set the template for the [[Roman Empire]].\n\n===Russia===\n*The [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993|constitutional crisis of 1993]]: a conflict between [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] and the Russian parliament led by [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]]. It emerged due to disagreements regarding the demarcation of political authority. Russian leaders agreed to hold a referendum in April 1993 that would determine whether the presidency or the parliament would be the dominant institution in the Russian political system.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Presidential Power in Russia|last=Huskey|first=Eugene|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781315482194|location=London|pages=}}</ref> The parliament temporarily reneged on its commitment to a referendum and it prompted Yeltsin to issue a decree giving the president more authority.

For constitutional crises since then, see [[Constitutional crisis#Constitutional Crises in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] below.\n* The death of three-year-old [[Margaret of Scotland (Maid of Norway)|Queen Margaret]] in 1290 prompted a succession dispute involving [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|thirteen claimants]]. The interim [[Guardians of Scotland]] asked King [[Edward I of England]] to arbitrate the dispute. Edward pursued his own interest in establishing lordship over Scotland by selecting claimant [[John Balliol]] in return for an [[oath of fealty]]. Scottish nobles rejected Edward's control, leading to the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] and a 10-year vacancy of the throne.\n\n===Spain===\n[[File:President_Puigdemont,_\"Ciutadans_de_Catalunya,_v\u00e9nen_hores_en_qu\u00e8_a_tots_ens_pertocar\u00e0_de_mantenir_el_pols_del_nostre_pa\u00eds\"_02.jpg|thumb|[[President of the Generalitat of Catalonia|Catalan president]], [[Carles Puigdemont]], addresses the crowd following the unilateral declaration of independence on 27 October]]\n*The [[2017\u201318 Spanish constitutional crisis]] saw the [[Government of Spain]] and the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]] clashing over the latter's planning of an [[2017 Catalan independence referendum|independence referendum]] on 1 October 2017, leading to the Catalan government openly defying instructions from the [[Spanish Constitutional Court]] and in state prosecutors filling criminal charges on Catalan leading officials for rebellion, disobedience, misusing public funds and making deliberately unlawful decisions. General strikes and tense demonstrations took place during these weeks. On 27 October, the [[Parliament of Catalonia]] tried to found a Catalan republic with a [[Catalan declaration of independence|unilateral declaration of independence]]. At the same time, the [[Senate of Spain|Senate]] approved the application of [[Constitution of Spain#Article 155|Article 155]] of the [[Constitution of Spain|Constitution]], which led to the cessation of the Catalan Government, the dissolution of parliament, the call for [[2017 Catalan regional election|elections]] for 21 December and the direct rule over Catalonia. The [[Supreme Court of Spain|Supreme Court]] imprisoned a large part of the Puigdemont executive, the [[Carme Forcadell|Speaker of the Parliament]] and the two leaders of the two major independentists civil associations, as well as the flight to Belgium, Switzerland, Germany and Scotland of President [[Puigdemont]], four regional ex-regional ministers and two political leaders. For July 2018, the direct rule ended and the prisoners are still in preventive jail in Catalan prisons.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n*The regency crisis of 1788: A new Parliament convened while [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] was unable, due to illness, to charge it with its responsibilities or assent to any bills. Parliament nonetheless submitted an irregular bill that provided for the Prince of Wales to act as regent, and the [[Lord Chancellor]] affixed the royal seal to it without the king's signature.

The upshot was the passage of the [[Constitution Act 1986 (NZ)|Constitution Act]], which patriated the constitution from the United Kingdom.\n\n===Papua New Guinea===\n*The [[2011\u20132012 Papua New Guinean constitutional crisis|Papua New Guinean constitutional crisis of 2011\u20132012]] was caused by a disagreement, involving every branch of government including the [[Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea|Supreme Court]], as to who the legitimate [[Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea|Prime Minister]] was. Specifically, whether Prime Minister [[Michael Somare]]'s dismissal by the Speaker of the [[National Parliament of Papua New Guinea|National Parliament]] while he was in hospital had been lawful. After ten months, the crisis was resolved peacefully by [[2012 Papua New Guinean general election|a general election]].\n\n===Tuvalu===\n*The [[Tuvaluan constitutional crisis|Tuvaluan constitutional crisis of 2013]] occurred when Prime Minister [[Willy Telavi]] sought to continue governing after having lost his parliamentary majority. He deferred allowing Parliament to sit, and his ally Speaker [[Kamuta Latasi]] did not allow a [[motion of no confidence]] to be tabled when it finally did sit. The Opposition accused the government of acting unconstitutionally, and [[Governor General of Tuvalu|Governor General]] Sir [[Iakoba Italeli]] intervened, removing the Prime Minister from office so that Parliament could decide who should form the government. Telavi sought in vain to ask the [[monarchy of Tuvalu|Queen of Tuvalu]], [[Elizabeth II]], to remove the Governor General. Parliament elected Opposition Leader [[Enele Sopoaga]] to the premiership.\n\n==South America==\n\n===Chile===\n*[[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat]]: Accusing [[Salvador Allende]]'s government of increasing authoritarianism, the [[Supreme Court of Chile|Supreme Court]], [[Comptroller General of Chile|Comptroller General]] and Chamber of Deputies<ref>[https://docs.google.com/document/preview?hgd=1&id=1-1mU7_DqEkeovBlYfi2yz-xLNJESPGEtdfJJ37lsNgk&pli=1 Acuerdo de la C\u00e1mara de Diputados sobre el grave quebrantamiento del orden constitucional y legal de la Rep\u00fablica]</ref> declared him out of order, and the Chamber urged the military to put an end to constitutional breaches. The military deposed Allende a few weeks later and abolished the constitution.\n\n===Peru===\n*[[Peruvian Constitutional Crisis of 1992]]: President [[Alberto Fujimori]], with the support of the armed forces, dissolved the Congress after it rejected his proposal for stronger action against [[Shining Path]] and [[T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]]. Then, he called for elections for a [[Democratic Constitutional Congress]] to write the 1993 [[Peruvian Constitution]]. Until the new constitution was written, he ruled by decree.\n\n===Venezuela===\n*[[2017 Venezuelan constitutional crisis]]: The constitutional chamber of the [[Supreme Tribunal of Justice (Venezuela)|Supreme Tribunal of Justice]] ruled that the country's legislature, the [[National Assembly (Venezuela)|National Assembly]], was operating in contempt of the constitution due to prior rulings that some members had been improperly elected, and assumed legislative power for itself. Politicians opposed to the government of President [[Nicol\u00e1s Maduro]], as well as Maduro's Prosecutor General, denounced the ruling for undermining the constitutional order, and the Tribunal rescinded it the following day. Maduro summoned a Constituent Assembly, nominally to draft a new constitution, but in practice to assert his authority against that of the National Assembly. As of 2019 the crisis remains unresolved, with National Assembly President [[Juan Guaid\u00f3]] attempting to assume the presidency from Maduro.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cabinet crisis]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Constitutional crises| ]]\n[[Category:Constitutional law]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Problem or conflict in the function of a government that a political constitution or other fundamental governing law is perceived to be unable to resolve}}\n\nIn [[political science]], a  '''constitutional crisis''' is a problem or conflict in the function of a government that the [[constitution|political constitution]] or other fundamental governing law is perceived to be unable to resolve. There are several variations to this definition. For instance, one describes it as the crisis that arises out of the failure, or at least a strong risk of failure, of a constitution to perform its central functions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Constitutions in the Global Financial Crisis: A Comparative Analysis|last=Contiades|first=Xenophon|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781409466314|location=Oxon|pages=53}}</ref> The crisis may arise from a variety of possible causes. For example, a government may want to pass a law contrary to its constitution; the constitution may fail to provide a clear answer for a specific situation; the constitution may be clear but it may be politically infeasible to follow it; the government institutions themselves may falter or fail to live up to what the law prescribes them to be; or officials in the government may justify avoiding dealing with a serious problem based on narrow interpretations of the law.<ref>{{cite web | title=The 4 Types of Constitutional Crises | author1=Azari, Julia | author2=Masket, Seth | date=February 9, 2017 | url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/constitutional-crisis/ | website=FiveThirtyEight}}</ref><ref name=\"Graber (2015), p. 244\">{{cite book | title=A New Introduction to American Constitutionalism | author=Graber, Mark A. | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2015 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHYRDAAAQBAJ | page=244}}</ref> Specific examples include the South African [[Coloured vote constitutional crisis]] in the 1950s, the [[Secession in the United States|secession of the southern U.S. states]] in 1860 and 1861, the controversial [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|dismissal of the Australian Federal government]] in 1975 and the [[2007 Ukrainian political crisis|2007 Ukrainian crisis]].\n\nConstitutional crises may arise from conflicts between different branches of government, conflicts between central and local governments, or simply conflicts among various factions within society. In the course of government, the crisis results when one or more of the parties to a [[Controversy|political dispute]] willfully chooses to violate a law of the [[constitution]]; or to flout an unwritten [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]]; or to dispute the correct, legal interpretation of the violated constitutional law or of the flouted political custom. This was demonstrated by the so-called [[XYZ Affair]], which involved the bribery of French officials by a contingent of American commissioners who were sent to preserve peace between [[France]] and the United States.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=From Many, One: Readings in American Political and Social Thought|last=Sinopoli|first=Richard|publisher=Georgetown University Press|year=1996|isbn=0878406263|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=185}}</ref> The incident was published in the American press and created a foreign policy crisis, which precipitated the passage of the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]]. Opposition to these acts in the form of the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions|Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions]] cited that they violated freedom of speech and exhorted states to refuse their enforcement since they violated the Constitution.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMoreover, if the crisis arises because the constitution is legally ambiguous, the ultimate resolution usually establishes the legal precedent to resolve future crises of constitutional administration. Such was the case in the United States presidential succession of [[John Tyler]], which established that a successor to the presidency assumes the office without any limitation.\n\nPolitically, a constitutional crisis can lead to administrative paralysis and eventual collapse of the government, the loss of [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]], or to [[civil war]]. A constitutional crisis is distinct from a [[rebellion]], which occurs when political factions ''outside'' a government challenge the government's sovereignty, as in a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' or a [[revolution]] led by the military or by civilians.\n\n==Africa==\n\n===Democratic Republic of the Congo===\n[[File:PatricelumumbaIISG.jpg|thumb|220px|Patrice Lumumba]]\n*President [[Joseph Kasavubu]] and Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]] attempted to dismiss each other in September 1960.

Its attempt to reverse the decision in an ''ad hoc'' court was also overturned, after which the party used reforms to the Senate to pass the measure legally.\n\n==Asia==\n\n===Iran===\n*[[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi]]'s 1953 dismissal of Prime Minister [[Mohammed Mossadegh]] and Mossadegh's subsequent refusal to quit the office\n\n===Malaysia===\n* [[1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis]] started by a group of politicians who were dissatisfied towards [[Stephen Kalong Ningkan]]'s leadership as chief minister. Ningkan was later removed from the chief minister post by the Governor of Sarawak in June 1966.\n* The [[1983 Malaysian constitutional crisis]] saw [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] [[Mahathir bin Mohamad|Mahathir]] pushing forward an amendment of Article 66 of the Federal Constitution, which set the time limit of the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong|Malaysian monarch]] to veto a law within 30 days. The proposals generated a great deal of controversy between the government and the monarchy, of which the former had to launch a public campaign to pressure the monarchy to assent to the amendments.{{clarify|date=November 2010}}\n* The [[1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis]] was a series of events that began with the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) party elections in 1987 and ended with the suspension and the eventual removal of [[Lord President of the Supreme Court]] [[Malay titles#Tun|Tun]] [[Salleh Abas]] from his seat.\n* The [[1993 amendments to the Constitution of Malaysia]] (by some interpretations a constitutional crisis) involved the limitation of monarchs' [[sovereign immunity|legal immunity]] in Malaysia. Prime Minister [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] successfully amended the constitution to make the monarchies more accountable to their actions.\n*The [[2009 Perak constitutional crisis]] occurred in the Malaysian state of [[Perak]] when [[party switching|party defections]] caused the state ruling coalition, [[Pakatan Rakyat]], to lose its majority in the [[Dewan Undangan Negeri|state assembly]]. The [[Sultan of Perak]] refused to dissolve the state assembly when requested and dismissed the [[Menteri Besar]] (Chief Minister) in the absence of a [[motion of no confidence|no confidence]] vote.{{clarify|date=November 2010}}\n* The [[2020 Malaysian constitutional crisis]] was a series of events that began when Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] and associates attempted to replace his coalition partners and form a unity government supported by opposition parties.\n\n===Pakistan===\n*Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Sajjad Ali Shah]] clashed repeatedly with Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] in late 1997, accusing him of undermining the court's independence. After Ali Shah suspended a constitutional amendment that prevented dismissal of the prime minister, Sharif ordered President [[Farooq Leghari]] to appoint a new chief justice. When Leghari refused, Sharif considered [[impeach]]ing him, but backed down after a warning from the armed forces. Faced with a choice of accepting Sharif's demands or dismissing him, Leghari resigned. Ali Shah resigned shortly afterward, establishing Sharif's dominance.\n\n===Thailand===\n*In March 2006, 60 seats of the [[National Assembly of Thailand]] could not be elected, and Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] refused to resign. The judicial system did not lead up to Supreme Court as the top arbitrator so there were inconsistent rulings from the civil, criminal, administrative, and constitutional Courts.{{clarify|date=July 2012}}\n\n===Sri Lanka===\n{{main|2018 Sri Lankan constitutional crisis}}\n*On the 26th of October 2018, President [[Maithripala Sirisena]] appointed former President [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]] as Prime Minister and dismissed incumbent Prime Minister [[Ranil Wickremesinghe]]. Ranil Wickremesing refused to accept the dismissal while stating that it was unconstitutional and undemocratic.\n\n==Europe==\n\n===Belgium===\n*The [[Royal Question]] over the status of king [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III]] began when he acted against [[advice (constitutional)|ministerial advice]] during the [[Battle of Belgium|1940 Nazi invasion]] and refused to join [[Belgian government in exile|the government in exile]]. Deported to Germany before [[Liberation of Belgium|Belgium's 1944 liberation]], Leopold's return was narrowly approved in [[1950 Belgian monarchy referendum|a 1950 referendum]] but a subsequent general strike prompted him to abdicate the following year.\n*In 1990, [[Baudouin I of Belgium|King Baudouin]] refused routine [[Royal Assent]] to the law on [[abortion in Belgium]].  The issue was resolved by (constitutionally but controversially) having Baudouin temporarily declared incapable of reigning, the Council of Ministers giving assent as provided for in the [[Belgian Constitution]], and Baudouin declared capable again.\n\n===Denmark===\n*The [[Easter Crisis of 1920]], when [[Christian X of Denmark|King Christian X]] of [[Denmark]] dismissed the country's cabinet.\n\n===England===\n{{hatnote|For events after the formation of the United Kingdom in 1707, see {{section link|#United Kingdom}} below.}}\n\n[[Image:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|thumb|220px|right|''John of England signs Magna Carta''.

Immediately, John repudiated Magna Carta, leading to the [[First Barons' War]].\n*The [[History of the Church of England#Separation from Papal authority|Break with Rome]]: [[Pope Clement VII]]'s refusal to annul King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s first marriage impeded the king's efforts to produce a male heir. Henry repudiated the Pope's ecclesiastical authority within England and required all officials to recognize him as [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]].\n*[[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]'s insistence on the [[Divine Right of Kings]], manifest in his [[Personal Rule]] from 1629 to 1640, and leading directly to the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]].\n*The [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688\u201389: The flight of [[James II of England|King James II/VII]] from the country left no king in his place to rule England or Scotland or to summon a [[Parliament]].  When [[William III of England|King William]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary]] jointly replaced him there was therefore no legally recognised Parliament to legitimise their irregular succession to the throne. This led to the [[Crown and Parliament Recognition Act 1689]].\n\n===Estonia===\n*The early 1930s political crisis in [[Estonia]] as two constitutional reforms had been rejected by the electorate and only the [[October 1933 Estonian constitutional referendum|third referendum]] in 1933 succeeded in replacing the [[parliamentary republic]] with the [[presidential republic]]. The succeeding constitutional reform was proposed by the [[Vaps Movement]], who were however kept from power by the [[self-coup]] of [[Prime Minister of Estonia|Prime Minister]] [[Konstantin P\u00e4ts]], who was supported by the [[Riigikogu]].\n\n===France===\n*The Brittany Affair of 1765: The king's court in Brittany forbade collection of taxes to which the provincial [[The Estates|Estates]] did not consent. After King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] annulled the court's decree, most of its members resigned. The chief prosecutor, [[Louis-Ren\u00e9 de Caradeuc de La Chalotais]], was accused of writing letters denouncing the king's action and charged with treason. A court convened to try La Chalotais reached no conclusion due to questions of jurisdiction and the weakness of the evidence. The king then transferred the case to his own council, further inflaming fears of absolutism to the point that he was obligated to release La Chalotais and yield to the provincial authorities.\n*The [[16 May 1877 crisis]]: President [[Patrice de Mac-Mahon]] dismissed Prime Minister [[Jules Simon]] and named [[Albert de Broglie]] to replace him. The [[National Assembly]] refused to recognize the new government and a crisis, which ended with the dissolution of the Assembly and new elections, ensued.\n\n===Germany===\n* In the [[Weimar Republic]], for several years the country was governed with the help of [[enabling act]]s and emergency decrees. The crisis became dramatic in 1932, when the [[Nazi Party]] and [[Communist Party of Germany]] had together a majority in the parliament. Any government, installed by the [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|Reich President]], was likely to be dismissed by the parliament. The crisis ended in a Nazi and conservative coalition government and then Nazi dictatorship. The [[Weimar Constitution]] was not abolished, but weakened to the point of irrelevance.\n* In 1962 [[Spiegel affair]], [[Franz Josef Strauss]], federal minister of defense, tried to repress media freedom with governmental resources and accused Spiegel employees of treason after an article of [[Der Spiegel|Spiegel]] had exposed the incompetence of German ministry of defense confronting the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1966, [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] issued a groundbreaking ruling concerning freedom of the press. The incident caused the first mass demonstrations and public protests and helped Germany remove many authoritarian features still retained following the end of World War II, marking a turning point in Germany values as ordinary people rejected authoritarian outlook in favor of democratic values.{{citation needed|date=September 2019|reason=Please provide sources that discuss this event as a constitutional crisis.}}\n\n===Malta===\n* The [[1981 Maltese general election|1981 election]], when, due to a quirk in that country's [[Single Transferable Vote]] system, the party winning more than half the votes won fewer than half the seats in parliament.\n\n===Order of Malta===\n* In December 2016 [[Matthew Festing]], Grand Master of the [[Order of Malta]], dismissed its Grand Chancellor [[Albrecht von Boeselager]] for allowing the distribution of contraceptives in violation of the Catholic Church's policy. Boeslanger protested that the dismissal was irregular under the Order's constitution and appealed to [[Pope Francis]]. Francis ordered an investigation of the dispute, then demanded and received Festing's resignation. The Order elected [[Giacomo dalla Torre del Tempio di Sanguinetto]] as Festing's successor on a program of constitutional reform and promoting religious obedience.\n\n===Norway===\n*[[Impeachment (Norway)|Impeachment]] of prime minister Selmer's cabinet in 1883/1884 regarding the king's right to veto changes to the constitution, and establishment of an ad-hoc parliamentary practice until amended to the constitution in 2007.<ref>[[Monarchy of Norway#Council of State]]{{Better source|reason=self-ref|date=August 2016}}</ref><ref>[[Storting]]{{Better source|reason=self-ref|date=August 2016}}</ref><ref>http://www.liberaleren.no/2007/02/20/parlamentarismen-inn-i-grunnloven/</ref>\n*[[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905]]{{Elucidate|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Rome===\n* [[Caesar's Civil War]]: In 50 BC the [[Roman Senate]] ordered [[Julius Caesar]], a popular military general and territorial governor, to disband his army and return to Rome.

For constitutional crises since then, see [[Constitutional crisis#Constitutional Crises in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] below.\n* The death of three-year-old [[Margaret of Scotland (Maid of Norway)|Queen Margaret]] in 1290 prompted a succession dispute involving [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|thirteen claimants]]. The interim [[Guardians of Scotland]] asked King [[Edward I of England]] to arbitrate the dispute. Edward pursued his own interest in establishing lordship over Scotland by selecting claimant [[John Balliol]] in return for an [[oath of fealty]].

General strikes and tense demonstrations took place during these weeks. On 27 October, the [[Parliament of Catalonia]] tried to found a Catalan republic with a [[Catalan declaration of independence|unilateral declaration of independence]]. At the same time, the [[Senate of Spain|Senate]] approved the application of [[Constitution of Spain#Article 155|Article 155]] of the [[Constitution of Spain|Constitution]], which led to the cessation of the Catalan Government, the dissolution of parliament, the call for [[2017 Catalan regional election|elections]] for 21 December and the direct rule over Catalonia. The [[Supreme Court of Spain|Supreme Court]] imprisoned a large part of the Puigdemont executive, the [[Carme Forcadell|Speaker of the Parliament]] and the two leaders of the two major independentists civil associations, as well as the flight to Belgium, Switzerland, Germany and Scotland of President [[Puigdemont]], four regional ex-regional ministers and two political leaders. For July 2018, the direct rule ended and the prisoners are still in preventive jail in Catalan prisons.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n*The regency crisis of 1788: A new Parliament convened while [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] was unable, due to illness, to charge it with its responsibilities or assent to any bills. Parliament nonetheless submitted an irregular bill that provided for the Prince of Wales to act as regent, and the [[Lord Chancellor]] affixed the royal seal to it without the king's signature.

Instead, Byng dismissed King and appointed [[Arthur Meighen]] as Prime Minister, after which Meighen found himself unable to retain [[confidence (politics)|confidence]], triggering his own resignation and an election.  Reaction to the affair was reflected in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], the resulting separation of [[British Dominions|Dominion]] [[Governors General]] from the British government, and the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] that made each realm of the Crown independent.\n*The 1936 [[Edward VIII abdication crisis]], when [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] proposed to marry divorcee [[Wallis Simpson]] against the advice of his ministers.\n*The 1982 [[patriation]] of the [[British North America Act]] was contentious, as there were conflicting opinions from the federal government, provincial governments, and [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] over what exactly the procedure was whereby Canada could request a [[constitutional amendment]] from [[the United Kingdom]]. The Supreme Court's decision in the [[Quebec Veto Reference]] found that [[Quebec]] did not have a veto on patriation, and the process was legitimate and binding. The [[National Assembly of Quebec]] symbolically refuses to ratify the Constitution Act in its current form.<!-- Is this a crisis?

[[Stephen Harper|Prime Minister Stephen Harper]] controversially advised the Governor General to [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogue]] Parliament. The coalition effort subsequently fell apart, leaving the key questions around the dispute unanswered.\n\n===Honduras===\n*The [[2009 Honduran constitutional crisis]] saw President [[Manuel Zelaya]] attempting to hold a non-binding referendum which [[National Congress of Honduras|Congress]] and the [[Supreme Court of Honduras|Supreme Court]] deemed unconstitutional. The military, following orders from the Supreme Court, arrested President Zelaya.\n\n===United States===\n[[File:Electoral Commission (United States).jpg|right|thumb|220px|The Electoral Commission was a panel that resolved the disputed presidential election of 1876.]]\n\n*The [[Stamp Act 1765]], by which the British Parliament sought to tax the [[Thirteen Colonies]], set off protests from colonial politicians against [[taxation without representation]].

The Constitution was unclear as to whether Tyler should assume the office of President or merely execute the duties of the vacant office. Tyler insisted that politicians recognize him as President and returned, unopened, all mail addressed to the \"Vice President\" or \"Acting President.\" Despite opposition from some Whig members of Congress, including [[John Quincy Adams]] and [[Henry Clay]], both houses passed a resolution confirming Tyler's position. This precedent governed succession until it was codified in the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]].<ref name=\"Abbott2008\">{{cite book|author=Philip Abbott|title=Accidental Presidents: Death, Assassination, Resignation, and Democratic Succession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NdzGAAAAQBAJ|date=23 June 2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-230-61303-4}}</ref>\n*The [[Secession in the United States|secession]] of seven [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[U.S. state|states]] in 1861, which the federal government did not recognize, leading to the [[American Civil War]].\n*[[1876 United States presidential election|1876 presidential election]]: [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] disputed voting results in three states.

Truman]] nationalized the country's steel industry on the basis of his [[Inherent powers (United States)|inherent powers]] in order to prevent a strike that would impede the [[Korean War]]. This action reopened the \"Great Debate\" of 1950\u201351 regarding the extent of Truman's authority to counter the spread of [[communism]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] enjoined Truman's order in ''[[Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer]]'', holding that presidential actions must proceed from constitutional or legislative authority. Truman used the threat of a second nationalization to push steel workers and management to an agreement.<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=McCullough|year=2003|title=Truman|page=1069}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Maeva|last=Marcus|year=1994|title=Truman and the Steel Seizure Case}}</ref>\n*In the [[Watergate scandal]] (1972\u20131974), President [[Richard Nixon]] and his staff [[Obstruction of justice|obstructed]] investigations into their political activities.

The Whitlam government had the confidence of the lower house, the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. In the [[Australian Constitution]], the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] has equal powers with the House of Representatives, except it may not initiate or amend a [[supply bill]]. It can, however, reject or defer consideration of such a bill, and that is what it did on this occasion. The Constitution permits the Governor-General to dismiss the government if they cannot command the [[Confidence (politics)|confidence]] of Parliament and will not call an election. Though the government lacked the confidence of the Senate, they commanded the confidence of the lower house, where government is formed and confidence motions introduced. Whitlam also stated his intention to call an election, but Kerr nonetheless dismissed him without prior warning and installed [[Malcolm Fraser]] as Prime Minister, despite Fraser's inability to command the confidence of either house of Parliament.\n*In 2017, the [[2017 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis|eligibility of a number of Australian parliamentarians]] to sit in the [[Parliament of Australia]] was called into question because of their actual or possible [[dual citizenship]]. The issue arises from [[section 44 of the Constitution of Australia]], which prohibits members of either house of the Parliament from having allegiance to a foreign power. Several MPs resigned in anticipation of being ruled ineligible, and five more were forced to resign after being ruled ineligible by the [[High Court of Australia]], including [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] leader and [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Barnaby Joyce]].

The [[Governor-General of Fiji|Governor-General]] intervened, appointing a prime minister from the opposition party.\n\n===New Zealand===\n*The 1936 [[Edward VIII abdication crisis]], when [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] proposed to marry divorcee [[Wallis Simpson]] against the advice of his ministers.\n*The [[New Zealand constitutional crisis, 1984|New Zealand constitutional crisis of 1984]] was caused by [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Rob Muldoon|Sir Rob Muldoon]]'s refusal to devalue the [[New Zealand dollar|dollar]] as per the instructions of the Prime Minister-elect, [[David Lange]].  The outgoing cabinet rebelled against Muldoon, who relented.  The upshot was the passage of the [[Constitution Act 1986 (NZ)|Constitution Act]], which patriated the constitution from the United Kingdom.\n\n===Papua New Guinea===\n*The [[2011\u20132012 Papua New Guinean constitutional crisis|Papua New Guinean constitutional crisis of 2011\u20132012]] was caused by a disagreement, involving every branch of government including the [[Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea|Supreme Court]], as to who the legitimate [[Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea|Prime Minister]] was. Specifically, whether Prime Minister [[Michael Somare]]'s dismissal by the Speaker of the [[National Parliament of Papua New Guinea|National Parliament]] while he was in hospital had been lawful. After ten months, the crisis was resolved peacefully by [[2012 Papua New Guinean general election|a general election]].\n\n===Tuvalu===\n*The [[Tuvaluan constitutional crisis|Tuvaluan constitutional crisis of 2013]] occurred when Prime Minister [[Willy Telavi]] sought to continue governing after having lost his parliamentary majority. He deferred allowing Parliament to sit, and his ally Speaker [[Kamuta Latasi]] did not allow a [[motion of no confidence]] to be tabled when it finally did sit. The Opposition accused the government of acting unconstitutionally, and [[Governor General of Tuvalu|Governor General]] Sir [[Iakoba Italeli]] intervened, removing the Prime Minister from office so that Parliament could decide who should form the government. Telavi sought in vain to ask the [[monarchy of Tuvalu|Queen of Tuvalu]], [[Elizabeth II]], to remove the Governor General. Parliament elected Opposition Leader [[Enele Sopoaga]] to the premiership.\n\n==South America==\n\n===Chile===\n*[[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat]]: Accusing [[Salvador Allende]]'s government of increasing authoritarianism, the [[Supreme Court of Chile|Supreme Court]], [[Comptroller General of Chile|Comptroller General]] and Chamber of Deputies<ref>[https://docs.google.com/document/preview?hgd=1&id=1-1mU7_DqEkeovBlYfi2yz-xLNJESPGEtdfJJ37lsNgk&pli=1 Acuerdo de la C\u00e1mara de Diputados sobre el grave quebrantamiento del orden constitucional y legal de la Rep\u00fablica]</ref> declared him out of order, and the Chamber urged the military to put an end to constitutional breaches. The military deposed Allende a few weeks later and abolished the constitution.\n\n===Peru===\n*[[Peruvian Constitutional Crisis of 1992]]: President [[Alberto Fujimori]], with the support of the armed forces, dissolved the Congress after it rejected his proposal for stronger action against [[Shining Path]] and [[T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]]. Then, he called for elections for a [[Democratic Constitutional Congress]] to write the 1993 [[Peruvian Constitution]]. Until the new constitution was written, he ruled by decree.\n\n===Venezuela===\n*[[2017 Venezuelan constitutional crisis]]: The constitutional chamber of the [[Supreme Tribunal of Justice (Venezuela)|Supreme Tribunal of Justice]] ruled that the country's legislature, the [[National Assembly (Venezuela)|National Assembly]], was operating in contempt of the constitution due to prior rulings that some members had been improperly elected, and assumed legislative power for itself. Politicians opposed to the government of President [[Nicol\u00e1s Maduro]], as well as Maduro's Prosecutor General, denounced the ruling for undermining the constitutional order, and the Tribunal rescinded it the following day. Maduro summoned a Constituent Assembly, nominally to draft a new constitution, but in practice to assert his authority against that of the National Assembly. As of 2019 the crisis remains unresolved, with National Assembly President [[Juan Guaid\u00f3]] attempting to assume the presidency from Maduro.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cabinet crisis]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Constitutional crises| ]]\n[[Category:Constitutional law]]\n", "name_user": "Astrophobe", "label": "safe", "comment": "+link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_crisis"}
