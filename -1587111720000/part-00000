The Mavericks proved they were ready for competitive action after completing the obligatory friendlies against teams such as the [[Kent Exiles]].\n\nIn 2006 they were officially accepted as full members of the league and duly given a spot in the Southern Conference of Division Two. They found this new level of football more difficult and, despite several close games, they finished the season in last place with a 0-10 record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Tables/2006TABLES.xls |format=XLS |title=2006 League Standings |publisher=Britball Now |date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2008-05-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807225601/http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Tables/2006tables.xls |archivedate=August 7, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn the restructuring of the league prior to the 2007 season, they were moved into the South East conference where they enjoyed more success, recording five [[shutout]]s, finishing with an even 5-5 record and only missing the playoffs by one place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Tables/2007tables.xls |format=XLS |title=2007 League Standings |publisher=Britball Now |date=2007-11-17 |accessdate=2008-05-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807225446/http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Tables/2007tables.xls |archivedate=2011-08-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Results/2007results.xls | format=XLS | title=2007 League Results | publisher=Britball Now | date=2007-11-17 | accessdate=2008-05-28}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2008 season the team improved yet again, this time reaching a 6-4 record. However, in a crucial game, the Mavericks surrendered a 28-7 lead in losing to the [[Colchester Gladiators]] which eliminated them from playoff contention.\n\nThe 2009 season proved to be East Kent's best yet. This year, the Mavericks held their nerve in a late season game on July the 12 2009 against the [[London Olympians]], earning a tight 16-8 victory which was described as \"The biggest win in their history\".<ref>Kentishgazette | Thursday July 16th 2009</ref> The team finally clinched a playoff berth on the last game of the season with a win over the [[Maidstone Pumas]]. The game however was marred by a great tragedy when Pumas linebacker Alan Newcombe, who was standing on the Pumas' sideline, suddenly collapsed and died.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kentish_gazette/news/2009/august/17/american_footballer_dies.aspx | format=XLS | title=Tributes flood in for American Footballer who died after match in Canterbury | publisher=kent online| date=2009-08-17 | accessdate=2013-08-10}}</ref> In the playoffs, the Mavericks lost out in the quarter-finals 6\u201324 to  [[Solent Thrashers|Hampshire Thrashers]]. They finished the season with an impressive 8-1-1 record.\n\nThe 2010 season saw the Mavericks promoted to Division One South East during an offseason restructure. Their first victory Division 1 came in the form of a 6-0 result against the Peterborough Saxons with Gary Welch converting two field goals to seal the win. The Mavericks finished with a respectable 3-7 record to complete their first season in a higher division. The 2011 season was much of the same, recording 2 wins and completing a 2-8 record.\n\n2012 saw a change in coaching staff, with Glenn Lindley appointed as Head Coach and various other new coaches taking up positions. A new influx of youth and university players saw a new impetus in the mentality and focus within the team. A Josh Adamson-led spread offence produced 314 points and recorded wins against the Sussex Thunder, South Wales Warriors and Ipswich Cardinals, all firsts for the franchise. The Mavericks finished 8-2 and were awarded a playoff bye-week as division winners. The team faced the Sussex Thunder in the playoff semifinals and lost 37-30 in a disappointing match after beating Sussex twice in regular season. Despite the playoff loss, this was the most successful season in the Mavericks short history.\n\nPrior to the 2013 season, the [[British American Football Association]] decided to restructure the [[BAFA National Leagues|National Leagues]], switching from a three-tier to a two-tier system, doubling the size of the Premiership team in the process. Having finished top in the Division One South East the previous season (though knocked out in the [[playoffs]] semifinals), the Mavs were promoted to the Premiership South. Despite it being their first ever season in the top flight of football in the UK, the Mavericks began the season strongly, winning six of their first seven games, including the first win over the Cambridgeshire Cats in team history. The Mavs ended up with a 6-4 record, losing their final three games to the London Blitz, Bristol Aztecs and eventual national champions London Warriors - all three of whom made the playoffs. The Mavericks were the only team from among those who were promoted to the Premiership following the 2013 realignment to finish the year with a winning record.\n\nThe Mavericks began their 2014 campaign in Week 3 of the BAFANL season, in a road trip against the Cambridgeshire Cats. After having notched up their first win over the Cats in franchise history in a home contest the previous season, the Mavs clocked up their first win against the Cats in Cambridgeshire, securing a hard-fought 28-20 victory.<ref>http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent/sport/live-kent-sportsday-16423/</ref> The Mavs' second game saw them losing a tough road battle against the London Olympians 20-8, before losing their home opener to the Colchester Gladiators in a close 40-37 defeat.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Senior team season records===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n|- \n!

The Mavericks proved they were ready for competitive action after completing the obligatory friendlies against teams such as the [[Kent Exiles]].\n\nIn 2006 they were officially accepted as full members of the league and duly given a spot in the Southern Conference of Division Two. They found this new level of football more difficult and, despite several close games, they finished the season in last place with a 0-10 record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Tables/2006TABLES.xls |format=XLS |title=2006 League Standings |publisher=Britball Now |date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2008-05-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807225601/http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Tables/2006tables.xls |archivedate=August 7, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn the restructuring of the league prior to the 2007 season, they were moved into the South East conference where they enjoyed more success, recording five [[shutout]]s, finishing with an even 5-5 record and only missing the playoffs by one place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Tables/2007tables.xls |format=XLS |title=2007 League Standings |publisher=Britball Now |date=2007-11-17 |accessdate=2008-05-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807225446/http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Tables/2007tables.xls |archivedate=2011-08-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Results/2007results.xls | format=XLS | title=2007 League Results | publisher=Britball Now | date=2007-11-17 | accessdate=2008-05-28}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2008 season the team improved yet again, this time reaching a 6-4 record. However, in a crucial game, the Mavericks surrendered a 28-7 lead in losing to the [[Colchester Gladiators]] which eliminated them from playoff contention.\n\nThe 2009 season proved to be East Kent's best yet. This year, the Mavericks held their nerve in a late season game on July the 12 2009 against the [[London Olympians]], earning a tight 16-8 victory which was described as \"The biggest win in their history\".<ref>Kentishgazette | Thursday July 16th 2009</ref> The team finally clinched a playoff berth on the last game of the season with a win over the [[Maidstone Pumas]]. The game however was marred by a great tragedy when Pumas linebacker Alan Newcombe, who was standing on the Pumas' sideline, suddenly collapsed and died.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kentish_gazette/news/2009/august/17/american_footballer_dies.aspx | format=XLS | title=Tributes flood in for American Footballer who died after match in Canterbury | publisher=kent online| date=2009-08-17 | accessdate=2013-08-10}}</ref> In the playoffs, the Mavericks lost out in the quarter-finals 6\u201324 to  [[Solent Thrashers|Hampshire Thrashers]]. They finished the season with an impressive 8-1-1 record.\n\nThe 2010 season saw the Mavericks promoted to Division One South East during an offseason restructure. Their first victory Division 1 came in the form of a 6-0 result against the Peterborough Saxons with Gary Welch converting two field goals to seal the win. The Mavericks finished with a respectable 3-7 record to complete their first season in a higher division. The 2011 season was much of the same, recording 2 wins and completing a 2-8 record.\n\n2012 saw a change in coaching staff, with Glenn Lindley appointed as Head Coach and various other new coaches taking up positions. A new influx of youth and university players saw a new impetus in the mentality and focus within the team. A Josh Adamson-led spread offence produced 314 points and recorded wins against the Sussex Thunder, South Wales Warriors and Ipswich Cardinals, all firsts for the franchise. The Mavericks finished 8-2 and were awarded a playoff bye-week as division winners. The team faced the Sussex Thunder in the playoff semifinals and lost 37-30 in a disappointing match after beating Sussex twice in regular season. Despite the playoff loss, this was the most successful season in the Mavericks short history.\n\nPrior to the 2013 season, the [[British American Football Association]] decided to restructure the [[BAFA National Leagues|National Leagues]], switching from a three-tier to a two-tier system, doubling the size of the Premiership team in the process. Having finished top in the Division One South East the previous season (though knocked out in the [[playoffs]] semifinals), the Mavs were promoted to the Premiership South. Despite it being their first ever season in the top flight of football in the UK, the Mavericks began the season strongly, winning six of their first seven games, including the first win over the Cambridgeshire Cats in team history. The Mavs ended up with a 6-4 record, losing their final three games to the London Blitz, Bristol Aztecs and eventual national champions London Warriors - all three of whom made the playoffs. The Mavericks were the only team from among those who were promoted to the Premiership following the 2013 realignment to finish the year with a winning record.\n\nThe Mavericks began their 2014 campaign in Week 3 of the BAFANL season, in a road trip against the Cambridgeshire Cats. After having notched up their first win over the Cats in franchise history in a home contest the previous season, the Mavs clocked up their first win against the Cats in Cambridgeshire, securing a hard-fought 28-20 victory.<ref>http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent/sport/live-kent-sportsday-16423/</ref> The Mavs' second game saw them losing a tough road battle against the London Olympians 20-8, before losing their home opener to the Colchester Gladiators in a close 40-37 defeat.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Senior team season records===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n|- \n!

model known for her work in [[Cinema of South India|South Indian cinema]], [[Bollywood]] and [[Cinema of the United States|American cinema]]. Saran was born in [[Dehradun]] and spent most of her childhood in [[Haridwar]]. In 2001, her dance master gave her the opportunity to appear in Renoo Nathan's debut music video \"Thirakti Kyun Hawa\", which brought Saran to the attention of many Indian filmmakers. Although Saran aspired to become a well-known dancer, she was offered a leading role. Thus, Saran made her film debut in 2001 with the Telugu film ''[[Ishtam (2001 Telugu film)|Ishtam]]'', and had her first commercial success with ''[[Santosham (2002 film)|Santhosham]]'' (2002).\n\nShe subsequently appeared in several more Telugu films while making in-roads in the Hindi and Tamil industries.

The F/A-18E single-seat and F/A-18F tandem-seat variants are larger and more advanced derivatives of the F/A-18C and D Hornet. \n\nThe Super Hornet has an internal 20&nbsp;mm [[M61 Vulcan|M61 rotary cannon]] and can carry [[air-to-air missile]]s and [[Air-to-surface missile|air-to-surface]] weapons. Additional fuel can be carried in up to five external fuel tanks and the aircraft can be configured as an airborne tanker by adding an external [[Aerial refueling|air refueling system]].\n\nDesigned and initially produced by [[McDonnell Douglas]], the Super Hornet first flew in 1995. Low-rate production began in early 1997 with full-rate production starting in September 1997, after the merger of McDonnell Douglas and [[Boeing]] the previous month. The Super Hornet entered service with the [[United States Navy]] in 2001, replacing the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]], which was retired in 2006; the Super Hornet serves alongside the original Hornet. The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF), which has operated the F/A-18A as its main fighter since 1984, ordered the F/A-18F in 2007 to replace its aging [[General Dynamics F-111C]] fleet. RAAF Super Hornets entered service in December 2010.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\nThe Super Hornet is an evolutionary redesign of the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]]. The Super Hornet's unique wing and tail configuration can be traced back to an internal Northrop project [[Northrop P-530|P-530]], {{circa|1965}}; this had started as a substantial rework of the lightweight [[Northrop F-5|F-5E]] with a larger wing, twin tail fins and a distinctive leading edge root extension (LERX).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/f17.html |title= Northrop YF-17 Cobra |website= joebaugher.com |first= Joe |last= Baugher |date= 20 July 2009 |accessdate= 27 September 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141107010303/http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/f17.html |archive-date= 7 November 2014 |url-status= live }}</ref> Later flying as the [[Northrop YF-17]] \"Cobra\", it competed in the [[United States Air Force]]'s [[Lightweight Fighter]] (LWF) program to produce a smaller and simpler fighter to complement the larger [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]]; the YF-17 lost the competition to the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|YF-16]].<ref name=Jenkins/>\n\nThe Navy directed that the YF-17 be redesigned into the larger F/A-18 Hornet to meet a requirement for a multi-role fighter to complement the larger and more expensive [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]] serving in fleet defense interceptor and air superiority roles. The Hornet proved to be effective but limited in combat radius.  The concept of an enlarged Hornet was first proposed in the 1980s, which was marketed by McDonnell Douglas as ''Hornet 2000''.

At the same time, U.S. Naval Aviation faced a number of problems.  The [[McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II]] was canceled in 1991 after the program ran into serious problems; it was intended to replace the obsolete [[Grumman A-6 Intruder]] and [[LTV A-7 Corsair II]].<ref name=Donald_p45>Donald 2004, p. 45.</ref> The Navy considered updating an existing design as a more attractive approach to a clean-sheet program. As an alternative to the A-12, McDonnell Douglas proposed the \"Super Hornet\" (initially \"''Hornet II''\" in the 1980s), an improvement of the successful previous F/A-18 models,<ref name=milestones/> which could serve as an alternate replacement for the A-6 Intruder.

Additional fuel can be carried in up to five external fuel tanks and the aircraft can be configured as an airborne tanker by adding an external [[Aerial refueling|air refueling system]].\n\nDesigned and initially produced by [[McDonnell Douglas]], the Super Hornet first flew in 1995. Low-rate production began in early 1997 with full-rate production starting in September 1997, after the merger of McDonnell Douglas and [[Boeing]] the previous month. The Super Hornet entered service with the [[United States Navy]] in 2001, replacing the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]], which was retired in 2006; the Super Hornet serves alongside the original Hornet. The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF), which has operated the F/A-18A as its main fighter since 1984, ordered the F/A-18F in 2007 to replace its aging [[General Dynamics F-111C]] fleet. RAAF Super Hornets entered service in December 2010.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\nThe Super Hornet is an evolutionary redesign of the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]]. The Super Hornet's unique wing and tail configuration can be traced back to an internal Northrop project [[Northrop P-530|P-530]], {{circa|1965}}; this had started as a substantial rework of the lightweight [[Northrop F-5|F-5E]] with a larger wing, twin tail fins and a distinctive leading edge root extension (LERX).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/f17.html |title= Northrop YF-17 Cobra |website= joebaugher.com |first= Joe |last= Baugher |date= 20 July 2009 |accessdate= 27 September 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141107010303/http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/f17.html |archive-date= 7 November 2014 |url-status= live }}</ref> Later flying as the [[Northrop YF-17]] \"Cobra\", it competed in the [[United States Air Force]]'s [[Lightweight Fighter]] (LWF) program to produce a smaller and simpler fighter to complement the larger [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]]; the YF-17 lost the competition to the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|YF-16]].<ref name=Jenkins/>\n\nThe Navy directed that the YF-17 be redesigned into the larger F/A-18 Hornet to meet a requirement for a multi-role fighter to complement the larger and more expensive [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]] serving in fleet defense interceptor and air superiority roles. The Hornet proved to be effective but limited in combat radius.  The concept of an enlarged Hornet was first proposed in the 1980s, which was marketed by McDonnell Douglas as ''Hornet 2000''. The Hornet 2000 concept was an advanced F/A-18 with a larger wing and a longer fuselage to carry more fuel and more powerful engines.<ref name=Jenkins>Jenkins, Dennis R.

At the same time, U.S. Naval Aviation faced a number of problems.  The [[McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II]] was canceled in 1991 after the program ran into serious problems; it was intended to replace the obsolete [[Grumman A-6 Intruder]] and [[LTV A-7 Corsair II]].<ref name=Donald_p45>Donald 2004, p. 45.</ref> The Navy considered updating an existing design as a more attractive approach to a clean-sheet program. As an alternative to the A-12, McDonnell Douglas proposed the \"Super Hornet\" (initially \"''Hornet II''\" in the 1980s), an improvement of the successful previous F/A-18 models,<ref name=milestones/> which could serve as an alternate replacement for the A-6 Intruder. The next-generation Hornet design proved more attractive than [[Grumman]]'s Quick Strike upgrade to the F-14 Tomcat, which was regarded as an insufficient technological leap over existing F-14s.<ref name=\"foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com\">{{cite web|url=http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/top-gun-day-special-the-super-tomcat-that-was-never-bu-1575814142|title=TOP GUN Day Special: The Super Tomcat That Was Never Built|first=Tyler|last=Rogoway|work=jalopnik.com|accessdate=12 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118012735/http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/top-gun-day-special-the-super-tomcat-that-was-never-bu-1575814142|archive-date=18 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:VF-143 F-14 F-18 2005.jpg|thumb|VFA-143 \"Pukin Dogs\" F-14B and F/A-18E in 2005]]\nAt the time, the Grumman F-14 Tomcat was the Navy's primary air superiority fighter and fleet defense interceptor.

His father Bunty and one of his older sisters Agnes Cyrus enrolled him in the local Harvard Coaching Clinic at the age of six for weekly coaching sessions on Sundays. As a result, Lara had a very early education in correct batting technique. Lara's first school was St. Joseph's Roman Catholic primary. He then went to San Juan Secondary School, which is located on Moreau Road, Lower Santa Cruz. A year later, at fourteen years old, he moved on to [[Fatima College]] where he started his development as a promising young player under cricket coach Mr. Harry Ramdass. Aged 14, he amassed 745 runs in the schoolboys' league, with an average of 126.16 per innings, which earned him selection for the Trinidad national under-16 team. When he was 15 years old, he played in his first West Indian under-19 youth tournament and that same year, Lara represented West Indies in Under-19 cricket and in coming years he was going to be one of the greatest test batsman world has ever seen.\n\n== Cricket career ==\n\n===Early first-class career===\n[[File:Brian Lara (4610977063).jpg|thumb|right|Lara batting for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] in 1994]]\n1987 was a breakthrough year for Lara, when in the West Indies Youth Championships he scored 498 runs breaking the record of 480 by [[Carl Hooper]] set the previous year.<ref>[http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Biography%5Cbio_BrianLara_captaincy.html ''The Coming Foretold''] [[The Independent]].

Later that year, his innings of 182 as captain of the West Indies Under-23s against the [[Indian cricket team in the West Indies in 1988\u201389|touring Indian team]] further elevated his reputation.\n\nHis first selection for the full West Indies team followed in due course, but unfortunately coincided with the death of his father and Lara withdrew from the team. In 1989, he captained a West Indies B Team in [[Zimbabwe]] and scored 145.\n\nIn 1990, at the age of 20, Lara became Trinidad and Tobago's youngest-ever captain, leading them that season to victory in the one-day [[Geddes Grant Shield]]. It was also in 1990 that he made his belated Test debut for West Indies against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]], scoring 44 and 5. He had made his ODI debut a month earlier against Pakistan, scoring 11.\n\n===International career===\n{{see also|List of batsmen who have scored over 10000 One Day International cricket runs}}\n\nIn January 1993, Lara scored 277 versus [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] in Sydney. This, his maiden Test century in his fifth Test, was the turning point of the series as West Indies won the final two Tests to win the series 2\u20131.

He has the highest individual score in both [[first-class cricket]] (501 [[not out]] for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] against [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]] in 1994) and Test cricket (400 not out for the West Indies against [[English cricket team|England]] in 2004). Lara amassed his world record 501 in 474 minutes off only 427 balls. He hit 308 in boundaries (10 sixes and 62 fours). His partners were [[Roger Twose]] (115 partnership \u2013 2nd wicket), [[Trevor Penney]] (314 \u2013 3rd), [[Paul Smith (cricketer, born 1964)|Paul Smith]] (51 \u2013 4th) and [[Keith John Piper|Keith Piper]] (322 unbroken \u2013 5th). Earlier in that season Lara scored six centuries in seven innings while playing for Warwickshire.\n\n[[File:BrianLaraUkexpatCropped.jpg|thumb|right|Brian Lara batting for the West Indies against [[India national cricket team|India]] at [[Kensington Oval]], [[Bridgetown]], Barbados, in 2002.]]\n\nHe is the only man to have reclaimed the Test record score, having scored 375 against England in 1994, a record that stood until [[Matthew Hayden]]'s 380 against [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]] in 2003. His 400 not out also made him the second player (after [[Donald Bradman]]) to score two Test triple-centuries, and the second (after [[Bill Ponsford]]) to score two first-class quadruple-centuries. He has scored nine double centuries in Test cricket, third after Bradman's twelve and [[Kumar Sangakkara]]'s eleven. As a captain, he scored five double centuries, which is the highest by any one who is in charge. In 1995 Lara in the Test match away series against England, scored 3 hundreds in Three consecutive Matches which earned him the Man of the Series award. The Test Series was eventually drawn 2\u20132. He also held the record for the highest total number of runs in a Test career, after overtaking [[Allan Border]] in an innings of 226 played at [[Adelaide Oval]], Australia in November 2005. This was later broken by [[Sachin Tendulkar]] of [[India]] on 17 October 2008 whilst playing against Australia at Mohali in the 2nd Test of the [[Border-Gavaskar Trophy]] 2008.\n\nLara captained the West Indies from 1998 to 1999, when West Indies suffered their first whitewash at the hands of [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. Following this they played [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] in a four-Test series which was drawn 2\u20132, with Lara scoring 546 runs including three centuries and one double hundred. In the second Test at Kingston he scored 213 while in the third Test he scored 153* in the second innings as West Indies chased down 311 with one wicket left. He won the Man of the Match award for both matches and was also named Man of the Series.\n\nThe [[Wisden 100]] rates Lara's 153 not out against Australia in Bridgetown in 1998\u201399 as the second best innings ever after Sir Donald Bradman's 270 against England in Melbourne in 1936\u201337.\n\nIn 2001 Lara was named the Man of the Carlton Series in Australia with an average of 46.50, the highest average by a West Indian in that series, scoring two half centuries and one century, 116 against Australia. That same year Lara amassed 688 runs in the three match away Test series against Sri Lanka making three centuries, and one fifty \u2013 including the double century and a century in the first and second innings of the 3rd Test match at the Sinhalese Sports Ground, equating to 42% of the team's runs in that series. These extraordinary performances led Muttiah Muralitharan to state that Lara was the most dangerous batsman he had ever bowled to.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/srilanka/content/story/133274.html |title=Murali: 'Lara's still No. 1' |publisher=Content-uk.cricinfo.com |accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nLara was reappointed as captain against the touring [[Australian cricket team|Australians]] in 2003, and struck 110 in his first Test match back in charge, showing a return to stellar performance. Later that season, under his captaincy, West Indies won the two match Test series against Sri Lanka 1\u20130 with Lara making a double century in the First Test. In September 2004, West Indies won the ICC Champions Trophy in England under his captaincy. For his performances in 2004, he was named both in the World Test XI and ODI XI by ICC.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/143090.html|title=Rahul Dravid is the ICC's player of the year|publisher=ESPNcricinfo}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2005, Lara declined selection for the West Indies team because of a dispute over his personal [[Cable & Wireless (Caribbean)|Cable & Wireless]] sponsorship deal, which clashed with the Cricket Board's main sponsor, [[Digicel]]. Six other players were involved in this dispute, including stars [[Chris Gayle]], [[Ramnaresh Sarwan]] and [[Dwayne Bravo]]. Lara said he declined selection in a stand of solidarity, when these players were dropped because of their sponsorship deals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/146390.html |title='I'm ready to play if best team is selected' \u2013 Lara |publisher=Content-uk.cricinfo.com |accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref> The issue was resolved after the first Test of the series against the touring [[South African cricket team|South African team]].\n\nLara returned to the team for the second Test (and scored a huge first innings score of 196), but in the process lost his captaincy indefinitely to the newly appointed [[Shivnarine Chanderpaul]]. In the next Test, against the same opponents, he scored a 176 in the first innings. After a one-day series against South Africa, he scored his first Test century against the visiting Pakistanis in the first Test at [[Kensington Oval]], [[Bridgetown]], Barbados which the West Indies eventually won.\n\n[[File:Brian Lara lap of honour.jpg|thumb|right|Lara during his lap of honour in his final international match, [[2007 Cricket World Cup]].]]\nFor his performances in 2005, he was named in the World Test XI by ICC<ref>[[ICC Test Team of the Year]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=August 2019}}.\n\nOn 26 April 2006 Lara was reappointed the captain of the West Indies cricket team for the third time. This followed the resignation of Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who had been captain for thirteen months \u2013 in which the West Indies won just one of the 14 Test matches they had competed. In May 2006, Lara led the West Indies to successful One-Day series victories against Zimbabwe and India. Lara's team played Australia in the finals of the DLF Cup and the ICC Champions Trophy where they finished runners up in both finals.\n\nOn 16 December 2006 he became the first player for the West Indies to pass 10,000 One Day International runs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Batting/BattingCareerRuns_ODI.asp?Stat=5000|title=HowSTAT!

His father Bunty and one of his older sisters Agnes Cyrus enrolled him in the local Harvard Coaching Clinic at the age of six for weekly coaching sessions on Sundays. As a result, Lara had a very early education in correct batting technique. Lara's first school was St. Joseph's Roman Catholic primary. He then went to San Juan Secondary School, which is located on Moreau Road, Lower Santa Cruz. A year later, at fourteen years old, he moved on to [[Fatima College]] where he started his development as a promising young player under cricket coach Mr. Harry Ramdass. Aged 14, he amassed 745 runs in the schoolboys' league, with an average of 126.16 per innings, which earned him selection for the Trinidad national under-16 team. When he was 15 years old, he played in his first West Indian under-19 youth tournament and that same year, Lara represented West Indies in Under-19 cricket.\n\n== Cricket career ==\n\n===Early first-class career===\n[[File:Brian Lara (4610977063).jpg|thumb|right|Lara batting for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] in 1994]]\n1987 was a breakthrough year for Lara, when in the West Indies Youth Championships he scored 498 runs breaking the record of 480 by [[Carl Hooper]] set the previous year.<ref>[http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Biography%5Cbio_BrianLara_captaincy.html ''The Coming Foretold''] [[The Independent]].

Later that year, his innings of 182 as captain of the West Indies Under-23s against the [[Indian cricket team in the West Indies in 1988\u201389|touring Indian team]] further elevated his reputation.\n\nHis first selection for the full West Indies team followed in due course, but unfortunately coincided with the death of his father and Lara withdrew from the team. In 1989, he captained a West Indies B Team in [[Zimbabwe]] and scored 145.\n\nIn 1990, at the age of 20, Lara became Trinidad and Tobago's youngest-ever captain, leading them that season to victory in the one-day [[Geddes Grant Shield]]. It was also in 1990 that he made his belated Test debut for West Indies against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]], scoring 44 and 5. He had made his ODI debut a month earlier against Pakistan, scoring 11.\n\n===International career===\n{{see also|List of batsmen who have scored over 10000 One Day International cricket runs}}\n\nIn January 1993, Lara scored 277 versus [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] in Sydney. This, his maiden Test century in his fifth Test, was the turning point of the series as West Indies won the final two Tests to win the series 2\u20131.

He has the highest individual score in both [[first-class cricket]] (501 [[not out]] for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] against [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]] in 1994) and Test cricket (400 not out for the West Indies against [[English cricket team|England]] in 2004). Lara amassed his world record 501 in 474 minutes off only 427 balls. He hit 308 in boundaries (10 sixes and 62 fours). His partners were [[Roger Twose]] (115 partnership \u2013 2nd wicket), [[Trevor Penney]] (314 \u2013 3rd), [[Paul Smith (cricketer, born 1964)|Paul Smith]] (51 \u2013 4th) and [[Keith John Piper|Keith Piper]] (322 unbroken \u2013 5th). Earlier in that season Lara scored six centuries in seven innings while playing for Warwickshire.\n\n[[File:BrianLaraUkexpatCropped.jpg|thumb|right|Brian Lara batting for the West Indies against [[India national cricket team|India]] at [[Kensington Oval]], [[Bridgetown]], Barbados, in 2002.]]\n\nHe is the only man to have reclaimed the Test record score, having scored 375 against England in 1994, a record that stood until [[Matthew Hayden]]'s 380 against [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]] in 2003. His 400 not out also made him the second player (after [[Donald Bradman]]) to score two Test triple-centuries, and the second (after [[Bill Ponsford]]) to score two first-class quadruple-centuries. He has scored nine double centuries in Test cricket, third after Bradman's twelve and [[Kumar Sangakkara]]'s eleven. As a captain, he scored five double centuries, which is the highest by any one who is in charge. In 1995 Lara in the Test match away series against England, scored 3 hundreds in Three consecutive Matches which earned him the Man of the Series award. The Test Series was eventually drawn 2\u20132. He also held the record for the highest total number of runs in a Test career, after overtaking [[Allan Border]] in an innings of 226 played at [[Adelaide Oval]], Australia in November 2005. This was later broken by [[Sachin Tendulkar]] of [[India]] on 17 October 2008 whilst playing against Australia at Mohali in the 2nd Test of the [[Border-Gavaskar Trophy]] 2008.\n\nLara captained the West Indies from 1998 to 1999, when West Indies suffered their first whitewash at the hands of [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. Following this they played [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] in a four-Test series which was drawn 2\u20132, with Lara scoring 546 runs including three centuries and one double hundred. In the second Test at Kingston he scored 213 while in the third Test he scored 153* in the second innings as West Indies chased down 311 with one wicket left. He won the Man of the Match award for both matches and was also named Man of the Series.\n\nThe [[Wisden 100]] rates Lara's 153 not out against Australia in Bridgetown in 1998\u201399 as the second best innings ever after Sir Donald Bradman's 270 against England in Melbourne in 1936\u201337.\n\nIn 2001 Lara was named the Man of the Carlton Series in Australia with an average of 46.50, the highest average by a West Indian in that series, scoring two half centuries and one century, 116 against Australia. That same year Lara amassed 688 runs in the three match away Test series against Sri Lanka making three centuries, and one fifty \u2013 including the double century and a century in the first and second innings of the 3rd Test match at the Sinhalese Sports Ground, equating to 42% of the team's runs in that series. These extraordinary performances led Muttiah Muralitharan to state that Lara was the most dangerous batsman he had ever bowled to.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/srilanka/content/story/133274.html |title=Murali: 'Lara's still No. 1' |publisher=Content-uk.cricinfo.com |accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nLara was reappointed as captain against the touring [[Australian cricket team|Australians]] in 2003, and struck 110 in his first Test match back in charge, showing a return to stellar performance. Later that season, under his captaincy, West Indies won the two match Test series against Sri Lanka 1\u20130 with Lara making a double century in the First Test. In September 2004, West Indies won the ICC Champions Trophy in England under his captaincy.
