Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. The recommended distance from other people is 6 feet, a practice more commonly called social distancing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge.

Antibiotic-resistant organisms have become an important cause of healthcare-associated (nosocomial) infections (HAI). In addition, infections caused by community-acquired strains of methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]) in otherwise healthy individuals have become more frequent in recent years. <!-- Antibiotics are not described as \"strongest\"; each has a specific range of activity. Antibiotics that are effective against many types of bacteria are termed \"broad spectrum\".

Furthermore, the short time between a vector becoming infectious and the onset of symptoms allows medical professionals to quickly [[quarantine]] vectors, and prevent them from carrying the pathogen elsewhere. Genetic mutations could occur, which could elevate their potential for causing widespread harm; thus close observation by contagious disease specialists is merited.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== Coronaviruses ===\n\n[[Coronavirus]]es (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East Respiratory Syndrome]] (MERS-CoV) and [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]] (SARS-CoV).

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. The recommended distance from other people is 6 feet, a practice more commonly called social distancing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr56/en/|title=WHO &#124; SARS outbreak contained worldwide|website=WHO}}\nbe safe be active</ref>\n\n=== Influenza ===\n\n{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}\n[[File:Barack Obama being briefed on swine flu oubreak 4-29.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] is briefed in the Situation Room about the [[2009 flu pandemic]], which killed as many as 17,000 Americans.<ref>{{cite news |title=Swine flu has killed up to 17,000 in U.S.: report |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-usa/swine-flu-has-killed-up-to-17000-in-u-s-report-idUSN1223579720100212 |agency=Reuters |date=12 February 2010}}</ref>]]\nWild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses.

This miner is a grey bird, with a black head, orange-yellow beak and feet, a distinctive yellow patch behind the eye, and white tips on the tail feathers. The [[Tasmania]]n race has a more intense yellow panel in the wing, and a broader white tip to the tail. Males, females and juveniles are similar in appearance, though young birds are a brownish-grey. As the common name suggests, the noisy miner is a vocal species with a large range of songs, calls, scoldings and alarms, and almost constant vocalisations, particularly from young birds. One of four species in the genus ''[[Manorina]]'', the noisy miner itself is divided into four [[subspecies]]. The separation of the Tasmanian ''M.&nbsp;m.&nbsp;leachi'' is of long standing, and the mainland birds were further split in 1999.\n\nFound in a broad arc from [[Far North Queensland]] through [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] to Tasmania and southeastern [[South Australia]], the noisy miner primarily inhabits dry, open [[eucalyptus|eucalypt]] forests that lack [[understory]] shrubs. These include forests dominated by [[Corymbia maculata|spotted gum]], [[Eucalyptus|box and ironbark]], as well as in degraded woodland where the understory has been cleared, such as recently burned areas, farming and grazing areas, roadside reserves, and suburban parks and gardens with trees and grass, but without dense shrubbery. The density of noisy miner populations has significantly increased in many locations across its range, particularly in human-dominated habitats. The popularity of nectar-producing garden plants, such as the large-flowered [[grevillea]]s, was thought to play a role in its proliferation, but studies now show that the noisy miner has benefited primarily from landscaping practices that create open areas dominated by eucalypts.\n\nNoisy miners are gregarious and [[Territory (animal)|territorial]]; they forage, bathe, roost, breed and defend territory communally, forming [[bird colony|colonies]] that can contain several hundred birds. Each bird has an 'activity space', and birds with overlapping activity spaces form associations called 'coteries', which are the most stable units within the colony. The birds also form temporary flocks called 'coalitions' for specific activities, such as [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|mobbing]] a predator. Group cohesion is facilitated not only by vocalisations, but also through ritualised [[Display (zoology)|displays]], which have been categorised as flight displays, postural displays, and facial displays. The noisy miner is a notably aggressive bird, so that chasing, pecking, fighting, scolding, and mobbing occur throughout the day, targeted at both intruders and colony members.\n\nForaging in the canopy of trees, on trunks and branches, and on the ground, the noisy miner mainly eats [[nectar]], fruit, and insects. Most time is spent gleaning the foliage of eucalypts, and it can meet most of its nutritional needs from [[Plant sap|manna]], [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]], and [[Lerp (biology)|lerp]] gathered from the foliage. The noisy miner does not use a stereotyped [[courtship display]], but copulation is a frenzied communal event. It breeds all year long, building a deep cup-shaped nest and laying two to four eggs. [[Egg incubation|Incubation]] is by the female only, although up to twenty male helpers take care of the nestlings and fledglings. Noisy miners have a range of strategies to increase their breeding success, including multiple broods and group mobbing of predators. The noisy miner's population increase has been correlated with the reduction of avian diversity in human-affected landscapes. Its territoriality means that [[Translocation (wildlife conservation)|translocation]] is unlikely to be a solution to its overabundance, and [[culling]] has been proposed, although the noisy miner is currently a protected species across Australia.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nEnglish ornithologist, [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]], described the noisy miner four times in his 1801 work ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae'', seemingly not knowing it was the same bird in each case: the chattering bee-eater (''Merops garrulus''), black-headed grackle (''Gracula melanocephala''), hooded bee-eater (''Merops cucullatus''), and white-fronted bee-eater (''Merops albifrons'').<ref>{{cite book| author=Latham, John|year=1801|title=Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae|location=London|publisher=G.

Males with overlapping activity spaces form associations called 'coteries', usually consisting of 10 to 25 birds. Coteries are the most stable unit within the colony. The birds also form temporary flocks when engaged in the same activity. These flocks, called 'coalitions', usually comprise five to eight birds, although coalitions of up to 40 birds can occur when [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|mobbing]] a potential predator. Membership of the coalition changes frequently as individuals leave the group as it passes beyond the boundary of their activity space, or the activity ends or changes, as when the breeding season begins.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001| p=631}} Females use activity spaces that overlap with those of male birds, but not other females, so that females will join coalitions with males in their area, but only rarely will there be more than one female in the coalition. The exclusivity of female activity spaces leads to young females being driven out of the colony in which they were born, and also makes it difficult for them to gain a place in a new colony. A study of banded nestlings that survived in one colony until the next breeding season, found that they were all male birds, suggesting that all female nestlings had died or left the colony.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001| p=631}} Emigration of males does not seem to occur until the population density of the colony reaches a critical level.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001| p=632}}\n\nLooking after the young is communal, with males of the coterie bringing food to the nestlings and removing [[Fecal sac|faecal sacs]]. Communal feeding increases after [[Fledge|fledging]], when males from nearby coteries may even bring food to the young birds if not driven off.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001| p=692}} Roosting is usually communal, with two to six adults and juveniles roosting in contact with each other, usually near the end of a hanging branch up to {{convert|20|m|ft}} above ground, within their activity space. They select a new site each evening, often selecting and rejecting several sites, and engaging in aggressive calling and chasing as other birds attempt to join the group. They are often the last birds to roost at night, but appear to sleep soundly, undisturbed by torchlight.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001| p=634}} Noisy miners drink together at the edge of lakes and dams, and from cattle troughs, often perching on a submerged branch. They bathe by diving head first into water and, when almost totally submerged, flapping their wings vigorously and ducking their heads under the water. They shake excess water off and then fly to a nearby branch to preen. They have been observed using rain- or dew-soaked foliage to bathe, and in dry weather will [[Dust bath|dust-bathe]] in dry soil or fine litter such as grass clippings. Bathing is communal, with birds stimulated to participate by observing others. They are occasionally observed [[Anting (bird activity)|anting]].<ref name=Dow/>\n\n====Flock behaviour====\n[[File:Noisy-Miner4.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The tall posture is a mild threat signal.]]\nThe noisy miner engages in most activities in a group. Roosting, foraging, preening, bathing and dust-bathing or anting are communal activities. Dawn song is a communal chorus, particularly during the breeding season. The communal interaction is facilitated by ritualised displays that have been categorised as flight displays, postural displays, and facial displays. In 'long flight' displays, initiated by either male or female birds, groups of up to twenty birds from more than one coterie fly about {{convert|40|m|ft}} above the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] for distances of up to {{convert|1.5|km|mi}} from the colony, constantly calling and not returning to the colony for about twenty minutes. As they return the remaining birds show signs of agitation, and sometimes fly up to join them. The 'short flight' display is performed by the male, and may be analogous to the territorial advertising displays of other birds. In a ritualised movement, the noisy miner flies out from a perch across an open area, in a rhythmic undulating pattern, usually calling in flight. At the end of the clearing it turns on an upward swoop and flies silently back to a perch near the starting point. The 'head-up flight' is performed by the female during the nesting period, and may function to attract male helpers. In its most intense form the body and tail are held almost vertically, with legs dangling and the head held up and back. It is performed by the female when she is selecting the nest site, and when carrying nest-building material, and probably has the function of indicating the location of the nest to other group members.<ref name=Dow/>\n[[File:Noisy Miner pointing.JPG|thumb|left|Pointing the bill is usually a warning signal.]]\n\nPostural displays include tall and low poses, pointing, open-bill and wing-waving. The 'tall posture' is used when in close contact with another bird and is a mild threat. The bird holds itself upright with neck and legs stretched, and it faces the other bird. The 'low posture' is a submissive gesture; the bird sits low on the perch with legs obscured by fluffed feathers and often faces away from the other bird. Fledglings threatened by adult birds will adopt a low posture and open their bill widely. 'Pointing' is a threat display where the bird stretches out horizontally, with feathers sleeked and the bill pointed at the target of the aggression. A bill snap will sometimes accompany pointing. An 'open-bill display' is used by subordinates in encounters between two birds, and by a female on the nest when other birds approach. The 'trident bill display' involves a fully open bill with the tongue raised and protruding and is a higher-intensity submissive display. 'Wing-waving' is often performed at the same time as an open-bill display. The wings are flexed and held slightly away from the body, and flapped out and up around three to six times. Wing-waving may be accompanied by a yammer call. 'Eagle' displays involve holding the wings and tail spread out, in either a vertical or horizontal position.<ref name=Dow/>\n\nEye displays are made by exposing or covering the bare yellow patch behind the eye\u2014when the feathers are completely sleeked the entire patch is visible, and when they are fluffed the patch is hidden. Eye displays are used in conjunction with postural displays, with the yellow patch fully displayed by dominant birds using threat postures, and immature birds tending to reduce the size of the eye patch when under attack from other members of the coterie.<ref name = Dow>{{cite journal| last = Dow | first = Douglas D.| title = Displays of the Honeyeater ''Manorina melanocephala''|pmid=1237204| journal = Ethology | volume = 38 |year=1975| issue = 1| pages = 70\u201396|doi =10.1111/j.1439-0310.1975.tb01993.x}}</ref>\n\nOn occasion early in the breeding season, mass displays erupt, where twenty or thirty birds perform the various wing-spreading displays, short flights, and constant calling. Displaying birds are attacked by others, and groups of silent but agitated birds watch the interactions. Mass displays are more common in the early morning, can last for up to 40 minutes, and seem to be a combination of sexual and [[agonistic behaviour|agonistic]] behaviour.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001| p=634}}\n\nA 'corroboree' (from the word for a ceremonial meeting of [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal Australians]]) is a group display where birds converge on adjacent branches and simultaneously pose hunchbacked, giving wing-waving and open-bill displays and the yammer call. A corroboree occurs when birds meet after a change in the social environment, such as a bird returning after an absence, or the repulsion of an intruder, or the coming together of different coteries. The corroboree appears to have a [[Pair bond|bonding]] function, and may involve all members of a colony.<ref name = Dow/>\n\n====Agonistic behaviour====\nDescribed as \"always at war with others of the feathered kind\" in early notes,<ref name=\"BM04\"/> the noisy miner is one of the most aggressive of the honeyeaters. Much of the activity within a noisy miner colony is agonistic with chasing, pecking, fighting, scolding, and mobbing occurring frequently throughout the day. The birds unite to attack predators and to defend the colony area against all other species of birds; the species is also highly aggressive intraspecifically.<ref name = Dow2>{{cite journal|last = Dow| first = Douglas D.| title = Agonistic and Spacing Behaviour of the Noisy Miner ''Manorina melanocephala'', a Communally Breeding Honeyeater| journal = Ibis | volume = 121 |year=1979| issue = 4| pages = 423\u201336|doi =10.1111/j.1474-919X.1979.tb06683.x}}</ref>\n\nFemale noisy miners are aggressive towards each other, and one cause of a male-biased sex-ratio in colonies may be the females' greater intolerance for each other, driving immatures out of the colony and preventing the immigration of new females. Aggression at the nest is common between males. Adult males begin attacking juveniles when they are around 11 weeks old, and attackers can include males that previously cared for the fledgling. Adult females are less aggressive towards young birds, although mothers do occasionally attack their own offspring, and [[Infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]] has been recorded. There is little male to female aggression other than the 'driving flights' that form part of the mating ritual. In direct attacks of young birds pecks are directed at the eye patch. Agonistic behaviour has been observed among nestlings, with aggression intensifying after fledging and at times resulting in the death of a sibling.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001| p=635}}\n\nThe noisy miner colony unites to mob inter-specific intruders and predators. The noisy miner will approach the threat closely and point, expose eye patches, and often bill-snap. Five to fifteen birds will fly around the intruder, some birds diving at it and either pulling away or striking the intruder. The mobbing continues until the intruder remains still, as with a [[tawny frogmouth]] (''Podargus strigoides''), or it leaves the area. Mobbing of snakes and [[goanna]]s is particularly intense, and most species of bird, even non-predators, entering the territory are immediately chased. The noisy miner has been recorded attacking an [[Australian owlet-nightjar]] (''Aegotheles cristatus'') during the day, [[grebe]]s, [[heron]]s, ducks and [[cormorant]]s on lakes at the edge of territories, [[crested pigeon]]s (''Ocyphaps lophotes''), [[pardalote]]s, and [[rosella]]s. Non-predatory mammals such as bats, cattle, sheep, and wallabies are also attacked, though less vigorously than birds.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001| p=635}}\n\nNoisy miner attacks are not limited to chasing the intruder, and aggressive incidents often result in the death of the trespasser. Reports include those of two noisy miners repeatedly pecking a [[house sparrow]] (''Passer domesticus'') at the base of its skull and killing it in six minutes; one noisy miner grasping a [[striated pardalote]] (''Pardalotus striatus'') by the wing while another pecked it on the head until it died; and a [[sacred kingfisher]] (''Todiramphus sanctus'') being chased and harassed for over five hours and then found dead with a fractured skull.<ref name=Dow2/>\n\n====Response to threats====\nNoisy miners make louder alarm calls in noisier sections of urban environments, such as main roads.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Lowry | first1 = H.

The female may perform a 'bowed-wing display' where the wings and tail are spread and quivered, with the wings arched and the head pointing down. The male may adopt a vertical or horizontal 'eagle display' with wings and tail spread wide and held still for several seconds. Copulation is frequent and conspicuous, with both males and females copulating with several birds, while other members of the colony display or otherwise interfere with the mating pair.<ref name=Dow/> Copulation usually occurs on larger, exposed branches close to the nest site and can occur at any time of the day, although slightly more often between 11:00 and 13:00 when communal activities are less frequent. {{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001| p=637\u201338}} The frenzied courtship activity had led to speculation that the female mates promiscuously to recruit males to help care for the young, but recent genetic testing shows that 96.5% of noisy miner broods result from monogamous mating and that multiple paternity is rare. An observation of banded birds noted that while females copulated repeatedly, it was always with the same male.

This miner is a grey bird, with a black head, orange-yellow beak and feet, a distinctive yellow patch behind the eye, and white tips on the tail feathers. The [[Tasmania]]n race has a more intense yellow panel in the wing, and a broader white tip to the tail. Males, females and juveniles are similar in appearance, though young birds are a brownish-grey. As the common name suggests, the noisy miner is a vocal species with a large range of songs, calls, scoldings and alarms, and almost constant vocalisations, particularly from young birds. One of four species in the genus ''[[Manorina]]'', the noisy miner itself is divided into four [[subspecies]]. The separation of the Tasmanian ''M.&nbsp;m.&nbsp;leachi'' is of long standing, and the mainland birds were further split in 1999.\n\nFound in a broad arc from [[Far North Queensland]] through [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] to Tasmania and southeastern [[South Australia]], the noisy miner primarily inhabits dry, open [[eucalyptus|eucalypt]] forests that lack [[understory]] shrubs. These include forests dominated by [[Corymbia maculata|spotted gum]], [[Eucalyptus|box and ironbark]], as well as in degraded woodland where the understory has been cleared, such as recently burned areas, farming and grazing areas, roadside reserves, and suburban parks and gardens with trees and grass, but without dense shrubbery. The density of noisy miner populations has significantly increased in many locations across its range, particularly in human-dominated habitats. The popularity of nectar-producing garden plants, such as the large-flowered [[grevillea]]s, was thought to play a role in its proliferation, but studies now show that the noisy miner has benefited primarily from landscaping practices that create open areas dominated by eucalypts.\n\nNoisy miners are gregarious and [[Territory (animal)|territorial]]; they forage, bathe, roost, breed and defend territory communally, forming [[bird colony|colonies]] that can contain several hundred birds. Each bird has an 'activity space', and birds with overlapping activity spaces form associations called 'coteries', which are the most stable units within the colony. The birds also form temporary flocks called 'coalitions' for specific activities, such as [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|mobbing]] a predator. Group cohesion is facilitated not only by vocalisations, but also through ritualised [[Display (zoology)|displays]], which have been categorised as flight displays, postural displays, and facial displays. The noisy miner is a notably aggressive bird, so that chasing, pecking, fighting, scolding, and mobbing occur throughout the day, targeted at both intruders and colony members.\n\nForaging in the canopy of trees, on trunks and branches, and on the ground, the noisy miner mainly eats [[nectar]], fruit, and insects. Most time is spent gleaning the foliage of eucalypts, and it can meet most of its nutritional needs from [[Plant sap|manna]], [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]], and [[Lerp (biology)|lerp]] gathered from the foliage. The noisy miner does not use a stereotyped [[courtship display]], but copulation is a frenzied communal event. It breeds all year long, building a deep cup-shaped nest and laying two to four eggs. [[Egg incubation|Incubation]] is by the female only, although up to twenty male helpers take care of the nestlings and fledglings. Noisy miners have a range of strategies to increase their breeding success, including multiple broods and group mobbing of predators. The noisy miner's population increase has been correlated with the reduction of avian diversity in human-affected landscapes. Its territoriality means that [[Translocation (wildlife conservation)|translocation]] is unlikely to be a solution to its overabundance, and [[culling]] has been proposed, although the noisy miner is currently a protected species across Australia.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nEnglish ornithologist, [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]], described the noisy miner four times in his 1801 work ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae'', seemingly not knowing it was the same bird in each case: the chattering bee-eater (''Merops garrulus''), black-headed grackle (''Gracula melanocephala''), hooded bee-eater (''Merops cucullatus''), and white-fronted bee-eater (''Merops albifrons'').<ref>{{cite book| author=Latham, John|year=1801|title=Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae|location=London|publisher=G.

Males with overlapping activity spaces form associations called 'coteries', usually consisting of 10 to 25 birds. Coteries are the most stable unit within the colony. The birds also form temporary flocks when engaged in the same activity. These flocks, called 'coalitions', usually comprise five to eight birds, although coalitions of up to 40 birds can occur when [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|mobbing]] a potential predator. Membership of the coalition changes frequently as individuals leave the group as it passes beyond the boundary of their activity space, or the activity ends or changes, as when the breeding season begins.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001| p=631}} Females use activity spaces that overlap with those of male birds, but not other females, so that females will join coalitions with males in their area, but only rarely will there be more than one female in the coalition. The exclusivity of female activity spaces leads to young females being driven out of the colony in which they were born, and also makes it difficult for them to gain a place in a new colony. A study of banded nestlings that survived in one colony until the next breeding season, found that they were all male birds, suggesting that all female nestlings had died or left the colony.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001| p=631}} Emigration of males does not seem to occur until the population density of the colony reaches a critical level.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001| p=632}}\n\nLooking after the young is communal, with males of the coterie bringing food to the nestlings and removing [[Fecal sac|faecal sacs]]. Communal feeding increases after [[Fledge|fledging]], when males from nearby coteries may even bring food to the young birds if not driven off.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001| p=692}} Roosting is usually communal, with two to six adults and juveniles roosting in contact with each other, usually near the end of a hanging branch up to {{convert|20|m|ft}} above ground, within their activity space. They select a new site each evening, often selecting and rejecting several sites, and engaging in aggressive calling and chasing as other birds attempt to join the group. They are often the last birds to roost at night, but appear to sleep soundly, undisturbed by torchlight.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001| p=634}} Noisy miners drink together at the edge of lakes and dams, and from cattle troughs, often perching on a submerged branch. They bathe by diving head first into water and, when almost totally submerged, flapping their wings vigorously and ducking their heads under the water. They shake excess water off and then fly to a nearby branch to preen. They have been observed using rain- or dew-soaked foliage to bathe, and in dry weather will [[Dust bath|dust-bathe]] in dry soil or fine litter such as grass clippings. Bathing is communal, with birds stimulated to participate by observing others. They are occasionally observed [[Anting (bird activity)|anting]].<ref name=Dow/>\n\n====Flock behaviour====\n[[File:Noisy-Miner4.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The tall posture is a mild threat signal.]]\nThe noisy miner engages in most activities in a group. Roosting, foraging, preening, bathing and dust-bathing or anting are communal activities. Dawn song is a communal chorus, particularly during the breeding season. The communal interaction is facilitated by ritualised displays that have been categorised as flight displays, postural displays, and facial displays. In 'long flight' displays, initiated by either male or female birds, groups of up to twenty birds from more than one coterie fly about {{convert|40|m|ft}} above the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] for distances of up to {{convert|1.5|km|mi}} from the colony, constantly calling and not returning to the colony for about twenty minutes. As they return the remaining birds show signs of agitation, and sometimes fly up to join them. The 'short flight' display is performed by the male, and may be analogous to the territorial advertising displays of other birds. In a ritualised movement, the noisy miner flies out from a perch across an open area, in a rhythmic undulating pattern, usually calling in flight. At the end of the clearing it turns on an upward swoop and flies silently back to a perch near the starting point. The 'head-up flight' is performed by the female during the nesting period, and may function to attract male helpers. In its most intense form the body and tail are held almost vertically, with legs dangling and the head held up and back. It is performed by the female when she is selecting the nest site, and when carrying nest-building material, and probably has the function of indicating the location of the nest to other group members.<ref name=Dow/>\n[[File:Noisy Miner pointing.JPG|thumb|left|Pointing the bill is usually a warning signal.]]\n\nPostural displays include tall and low poses, pointing, open-bill and wing-waving. The 'tall posture' is used when in close contact with another bird and is a mild threat. The bird holds itself upright with neck and legs stretched, and it faces the other bird. The 'low posture' is a submissive gesture; the bird sits low on the perch with legs obscured by fluffed feathers and often faces away from the other bird. Fledglings threatened by adult birds will adopt a low posture and open their bill widely. 'Pointing' is a threat display where the bird stretches out horizontally, with feathers sleeked and the bill pointed at the target of the aggression. A bill snap will sometimes accompany pointing. An 'open-bill display' is used by subordinates in encounters between two birds, and by a female on the nest when other birds approach. The 'trident bill display' involves a fully open bill with the tongue raised and protruding and is a higher-intensity submissive display. 'Wing-waving' is often performed at the same time as an open-bill display. The wings are flexed and held slightly away from the body, and flapped out and up around three to six times. Wing-waving may be accompanied by a yammer call. 'Eagle' displays involve holding the wings and tail spread out, in either a vertical or horizontal position.<ref name=Dow/>\n\nEye displays are made by exposing or covering the bare yellow patch behind the eye\u2014when the feathers are completely sleeked the entire patch is visible, and when they are fluffed the patch is hidden. Eye displays are used in conjunction with postural displays, with the yellow patch fully displayed by dominant birds using threat postures, and immature birds tending to reduce the size of the eye patch when under attack from other members of the coterie.<ref name = Dow>{{cite journal| last = Dow | first = Douglas D.| title = Displays of the Honeyeater ''Manorina melanocephala''|pmid=1237204| journal = Ethology | volume = 38 |year=1975| issue = 1| pages = 70\u201396|doi =10.1111/j.1439-0310.1975.tb01993.x}}</ref>\n\nOn occasion early in the breeding season, mass displays erupt, where twenty or thirty birds perform the various wing-spreading displays, short flights, and constant calling. Displaying birds are attacked by others, and groups of silent but agitated birds watch the interactions. Mass displays are more common in the early morning, can last for up to 40 minutes, and seem to be a combination of sexual and [[agonistic behaviour|agonistic]] behaviour.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001| p=634}}\n\nA 'corroboree' (from the word for a ceremonial meeting of [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal Australians]]) is a group display where birds converge on adjacent branches and simultaneously pose hunchbacked, giving wing-waving and open-bill displays and the yammer call. A corroboree occurs when birds meet after a change in the social environment, such as a bird returning after an absence, or the repulsion of an intruder, or the coming together of different coteries. The corroboree appears to have a [[Pair bond|bonding]] function, and may involve all members of a colony.<ref name = Dow/>\n\n====Agonistic behaviour====\nDescribed as \"always at war with others of the feathered kind\" in early notes,<ref name=\"BM04\"/> the noisy miner is one of the most aggressive of the honeyeaters. Much of the activity within a noisy miner colony is agonistic with chasing, pecking, fighting, scolding, and mobbing occurring frequently throughout the day. The birds unite to attack predators and to defend the colony area against all other species of birds; the species is also highly aggressive intraspecifically.<ref name = Dow2>{{cite journal|last = Dow| first = Douglas D.| title = Agonistic and Spacing Behaviour of the Noisy Miner ''Manorina melanocephala'', a Communally Breeding Honeyeater| journal = Ibis | volume = 121 |year=1979| issue = 4| pages = 423\u201336|doi =10.1111/j.1474-919X.1979.tb06683.x}}</ref>\n\nFemale noisy miners are aggressive towards each other, and one cause of a male-biased sex-ratio in colonies may be the females' greater intolerance for each other, driving immatures out of the colony and preventing the immigration of new females. Aggression at the nest is common between males. Adult males begin attacking juveniles when they are around 11 weeks old, and attackers can include males that previously cared for the fledgling. Adult females are less aggressive towards young birds, although mothers do occasionally attack their own offspring, and [[Infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]] has been recorded. There is little male to female aggression other than the 'driving flights' that form part of the mating ritual. In direct attacks of young birds pecks are directed at the eye patch. Agonistic behaviour has been observed among nestlings, with aggression intensifying after fledging and at times resulting in the death of a sibling.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001| p=635}}\n\nThe noisy miner colony unites to mob inter-specific intruders and predators. The noisy miner will approach the threat closely and point, expose eye patches, and often bill-snap. Five to fifteen birds will fly around the intruder, some birds diving at it and either pulling away or striking the intruder. The mobbing continues until the intruder remains still, as with a [[tawny frogmouth]] (''Podargus strigoides''), or it leaves the area. Mobbing of snakes and [[goanna]]s is particularly intense, and most species of bird, even non-predators, entering the territory are immediately chased. The noisy miner has been recorded attacking an [[Australian owlet-nightjar]] (''Aegotheles cristatus'') during the day, [[grebe]]s, [[heron]]s, ducks and [[cormorant]]s on lakes at the edge of territories, [[crested pigeon]]s (''Ocyphaps lophotes''), [[pardalote]]s, and [[rosella]]s. Non-predatory mammals such as bats, cattle, sheep, and wallabies are also attacked, though less vigorously than birds.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001| p=635}}\n\nNoisy miner attacks are not limited to chasing the intruder, and aggressive incidents often result in the death of the trespasser. Reports include those of two noisy miners repeatedly pecking a [[house sparrow]] (''Passer domesticus'') at the base of its skull and killing it in six minutes; one noisy miner grasping a [[striated pardalote]] (''Pardalotus striatus'') by the wing while another pecked it on the head until it died; and a [[sacred kingfisher]] (''Todiramphus sanctus'') being chased and harassed for over five hours and then found dead with a fractured skull.<ref name=Dow2/>\n\n====Response to threats====\nNoisy miners make louder alarm calls in noisier sections of urban environments, such as main roads.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Lowry | first1 = H.

The female may perform a 'bowed-wing display' where the wings and tail are spread and quivered, with the wings arched and the head pointing down. The male may adopt a vertical or horizontal 'eagle display' with wings and tail spread wide and held still for several seconds. Copulation is frequent and conspicuous, with both males and females copulating with several birds, while other members of the colony display or otherwise interfere with the mating pair.<ref name=Dow/> Copulation usually occurs on larger, exposed branches close to the nest site and can occur at any time of the day, although slightly more often between 11:00 and 13:00 when communal activities are less frequent. {{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001| p=637\u201338}} The frenzied courtship activity had led to speculation that the female mates promiscuously to recruit males to help care for the young, but recent genetic testing shows that 96.5% of noisy miner broods result from monogamous mating and that multiple paternity is rare.

They do not go far from the nest, return to it at night, and take some weeks to completely leave the nest. Many fledglings are found on the ground and in low shrubs during this period, where they continue to be cared for until they can make their way up into the trees.

It is both arboreal and terrestrial, feeding in the canopy of trees and on trunks and branches and on the ground. It forages within the colony's territory throughout the year, usually in groups of five to eight birds although hundreds may gather at a stand of flowering trees such as [[banksia]]. The noisy miner collects nectar directly from flowers, hanging upside down or straddling thin branches acrobatically to access the nectar; it takes fruit from trees or fallen on the ground; [[Gleaning (birds)|gleans]] or [[Hawking (birds)|hawks]] for invertebrates; and picks through leaf litter for insects. It has been recorded turning over the dried droppings of [[emu]] (''Dromaius novaehollandiae'') and [[eastern grey kangaroo]] (''Macropus giganteus'') searching for insects.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001| p=630}}\n[[File:Manorina melanocephala with mealworm.jpg|thumb|left|An immature bird (with brownish feathers) eats a [[mealworm]].]]\n\nIn a study of birds foraging in suburban gardens, the noisy miner was seen to spend more time in banksia, grevillea and eucalypt species, and when in flower, [[callistemon]], than in other plants including [[introduced species|exotics]].

When searching for nectar, which does not move but is readily depleted, the noisy miner uses a [[Spatial memory|spatial memory-based]] strategy, identifying characteristics of the environment\u2014a strategy that is efficient in new environments and is not affected by changes in the bird's activities. When searching for invertebrates, it appears to employ a different strategy based on learned rules of insect movement (they improve at finding invertebrates with practice).
