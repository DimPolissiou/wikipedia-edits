The waste hierarchy is the cornerstone of most waste minimisation strategies. The aim of the waste hierarchy is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to generate the minimum amount of end waste; see: [[resource recovery]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.disposalmag.com/#The_Proper_Care_and_Use_of_a_Garbage_Disposal|title=The Proper Care and Use of a Garbage Disposal|last=Albert|first=Raleigh|date=4 August 2011|website=Disposal Mag|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-03}}</ref> The waste hierarchy is represented as a pyramid because the basic premise is that policies should promote measures to prevent the generation of waste. The next step or preferred action is to seek alternative uses for the waste that has been generated i.e. by re-use. The next is recycling which includes composting.

The hierarchy represents the latter parts of the life-cycle for each product.\n\n===Life-cycle of a product===\nThe life-cycle begins with design, then proceeds through manufacture, distribution, and primary use and then follows through the waste hierarchy's stages of reduce, reuse and recycle.  Each stage in the life-cycle offers opportunities for policy intervention, to rethink the need for the product, to redesign to minimize waste potential, to extend its use.<ref name=UN/>{{page needed|date=November 2016}} Product life-cycle analysis is a way to optimize the use of the world's limited resources by avoiding the unnecessary generation of waste.\n\n===Resource efficiency===\n[[Resource efficiency]] reflects the understanding that global economic growth and development can not be sustained at current production and consumption patterns. Globally, humanity extracts more resources to produce goods than the planet can replenish.<ref name=UN/>{{page needed|date=November 2016}} Resource efficiency is the reduction of the environmental impact from the production and consumption of these goods, from final raw material extraction to the last use and disposal.\n\n===Polluter-pays principle===\nThe [[polluter-pays principle]] mandates that the polluting party pays for the impact on the environment. With respect to waste management, this generally refers to the requirement for a waste generator to pay for appropriate disposal of the unrecoverable material.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/faqs/what-is-the-polluter-pays-principle/|title=What is the polluter pays principle?|last=|first=|website=LSE|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 February 2020|date=11 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of waste management}}\nThroughout most of history, the amount of [[waste]] generated by humans was insignificant due to low [[population density]] and low societal levels of the [[exploitation of natural resources]] as well as industrial since a few decades ago. Common waste produced during pre-modern times was mainly ashes and human [[biodegradable waste]], and these were released back into the ground locally, with minimum [[environmental degradation|environmental impact]]. Tools made out of [[wood]] or [[metal]] were generally reused or passed down through the generations.\n\nHowever, some civilizations do seem to have been more profligate in their waste output than others. In particular, the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] of [[Central America]] had a fixed monthly ritual, in which the people of the village would gather together and burn their rubbish in large dumps.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Barbalace |first=Roberta Crowell |url=http://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/environmental/wastehistory.html |title=The History of Waste |publisher=EnvironmentalChemistry.com |date=2003-08-01 |accessdate=2013-12-09}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:SirEdwinChadwick.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir [[Edwin Chadwick]]'s 1842 report ''The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population'' was influential in securing the passage of the first legislation aimed at waste clearance and disposal.]]\nFollowing the onset of [[industrial revolution|industrialisation]] and the sustained urban growth of large population centres in [[England]], the buildup of waste in the cities caused a rapid deterioration in levels of [[sanitation]] and the general quality of urban life. The streets became choked with filth due to the lack of waste clearance regulations.<ref>Florence Nightingale, ''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/nightingale-rural.asp Selected Writings of Florence Nightingale]'', ed.

Highly influential in this new focus was the report ''The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population'' in 1842<ref>{{cite book |title=Report...from the Poor Law Commissioners on an Inquiry into the Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Population of Great Britain  |location=London |year=1842 |pages=369\u2013372 |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/chadwick2.html |last=Chadwick |first=Edwin}} via {{cite web |author=Laura Del Col |publisher=The Victorian Web |title=Chadwick's Report on Sanitary Conditions |date=11 October 2002 }}</ref> of the [[social reform]]er, [[Edwin Chadwick]], in which he argued for the importance of adequate waste removal and management facilities to improve the health and wellbeing of the city's population.\n\nIn the UK, the Nuisance Removal and Disease Prevention Act of 1846 began what was to be a steadily evolving process of the provision of regulated waste management in London. The [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] was the first citywide authority that centralized sanitation regulation for the rapidly expanding city and the [[Public Health Act 1875]] made it compulsory for every household to deposit their weekly waste in \"moveable receptacles\" for disposal\u2014the first concept for a dust-bin.<ref name=\"NWRA\">{{cite web|last=National Waste & Recycling Association |url=http://www.environmentalistseveryday.org/publications-solid-waste-industry-research/information/history-of-solid-waste-management/early-america-industrial-revolution.php |title=History of Solid Waste Management |location= Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2013-12-09}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Manlove, Alliott furnace.jpg|thumb|left|[[Manlove, Alliott & Co.

The use of [[incinerator]]s for waste disposal became popular in the late 19th century.]]\nThe dramatic increase in waste for disposal led to the creation of the first [[incineration]] plants, or, as they were then called, \"destructors\". In 1874, the first incinerator was built in [[Nottingham]] by [[Manlove, Alliott & Co.

In 1895, [[New York City]] became the first U.S. city with public-sector garbage management.<ref name=\"NWRA\"/>\n\nEarly [[garbage truck|garbage removal trucks]] were simply open bodied [[dump truck]]s pulled by a team of horses. They became motorized in the early part of the 20th century and the first closed body trucks to eliminate odours with a dumping lever mechanism were introduced in the 1920s in Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardrawgathering.co.uk/covered-bodies/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150106135610/http://www.hardrawgathering.co.uk/covered-bodies/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-01-06|title=Covered Bodies}}</ref> These were soon equipped with 'hopper mechanisms' where the scooper was loaded at floor level and then hoisted mechanically to deposit the waste in the truck. The [[Garwood Load Packer]] was the first truck in 1938, to incorporate a hydraulic compactor.\n\n==Waste handling and transport==\n{{main article|Waste collection vehicle|Waste collector|Waste sorting}}\n[[File:Bin.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Moulded plastic, wheeled waste bin in [[Berkshire]], England]]\n\nWaste collection methods vary widely among different countries and regions. Domestic waste collection services are often provided by local government authorities, or by private companies for industrial and commercial waste. Some areas, especially those in less developed countries, do not have formal waste-collection systems.\n\n===Waste handling practices===\n[[Curbside collection]] is the most common method of disposal in most European countries, [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[United States]], and many other parts of the developed world in which waste is collected at regular intervals by specialised trucks. This is often associated with curb-side waste segregation. In rural areas waste may need to be taken to a transfer station. Waste collected is then transported to an appropriate disposal facility.\nIn some areas, vacuum collection is used in which waste is transported from the home or commercial premises by vacuum along small bore tubes. Systems are in use in Europe and North America.\n{{main article|Automated vacuum collection}}\nIn some jurisdictions unsegregated waste is collected at the curb-side or from waste transfer stations and then sorted into recyclables and unusable waste. Such systems are capable of sorting large volumes of solid waste, salvaging recyclables, and turning the rest into bio-gas and soil conditioner.\nIn [[San Francisco]], the local government established its ''Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance'' in support of its goal of \"Zero waste by 2020\", requiring everyone in the city to keep recyclables and compostables out of the landfill. The three streams are collected with the curbside \"Fantastic 3\" bin system \u2013 blue for recyclables, green for compostables, and black for landfill-bound materials \u2013 provided to residents and businesses and serviced by San Francisco's sole refuse hauler, Recology. The City's \"Pay-As-You-Throw\" system charges customers by the volume of landfill-bound materials, which provides a financial incentive to separate recyclables and compostables from other discards. The City's Department of the Environment's Zero Waste Program has led the City to achieve 80% diversion, the highest diversion rate in North America.<ref>http://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/features/greencityindex_international/all/en/pdf/report_northamerica_en.pdf</ref> Other businesses such as [[Waste Industries]] use a variety of colors to distinguish between trash and recycling cans.\n\n==Financial models==\nIn most developed countries, domestic waste disposal is funded from a national or local tax which may be related to income, or property values. Commercial and industrial waste disposal is typically charged for as a commercial service, often as an integrated charge which includes disposal costs. This practice may encourage disposal contractors to opt for the cheapest disposal option such as landfill rather than the environmentally best solution such as re-use and recycling.\n\nIn some areas such as [[Taipei]], the city government charges its households and industries for the volume of rubbish they produce. Waste is collected by the city council only if it is put in government issued rubbish bags. This policy has successfully reduced the amount of waste the city produces and increased the recycling rate.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n[[Morocco]] has also seen benefits from implementing a $300 million sanitary [[landfill]] system. While it might appear to be a costly investment, the country's government predicts that it has saved them another $440 million in damages, or consequences of failing to dispose of waste properly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/27/how-the-world-should-cope-with-its-growing-piles-of-rubbish|title=How the world should cope with its growing piles of rubbish|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Disposal methods==\n\n===Landfill===\n{{main article|Landfill}}\n[[File:Landfill compactor.jpg|thumb|A [[Waste compaction|landfill compaction vehicle]] in action.]]\n[[File:District heating plant spittelau ssw crop1.png|thumb|upright|Spittelau incineration plant in [[Vienna]]]]\n\nA landfill is a site for the disposal of [[waste]] materials by burial. Landfill is the oldest form of [[list of solid waste treatment technologies|waste treatment]], although the burial of the waste is modern; historically, refuse was simply left in piles or thrown into pits. Historically, landfills have been the most common method of organized [[waste disposal]] and remain so in many places around the world.\n\n===Incineration===\n{{main article|Incineration}}\nIncineration is a disposal method in which solid organic wastes are subjected to combustion so as to convert them into residue and gaseous products. This method is useful for disposal of both municipal solid waste and solid residue from waste water treatment. This process reduces the volumes of solid waste by 80 to 95 percent.<ref>http://web.mit.edu/urbanupgrading/urbanenvironment/resources/references/pdfs/DecisionMakers.pdf</ref> Incineration and other high temperature waste treatment systems are sometimes described as \"[[thermal treatment]]\". Incinerators convert waste materials into [[heat]], [[gas]], [[steam]], and [[Incineration#Solid outputs|ash]].\n\nIncineration is carried out both on a small scale by individuals and on a large scale by industry. It is used to dispose of solid, liquid and gaseous waste. It is recognized as a practical method of disposing of certain [[hazardous waste]] materials (such as biological [[medical waste]]). Incineration is a controversial method of waste disposal, due to issues such as emission of gaseous [[pollutants]].\n\nIncineration is common in countries such as [[Japan]] where land is more scarce, as the facilities generally do not require as much area as landfills. [[Waste-to-energy]] (WtE) or energy-from-waste (EfW) are broad terms for facilities that burn waste in a furnace or boiler to generate heat, steam or electricity. Combustion in an incinerator is not always perfect and there have been concerns about pollutants in gaseous emissions from incinerator stacks. Particular concern has focused on some very persistent [[organic compound]]s such as [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], [[furan]]s, and [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|PAH]]s, which may be created and which may have serious environmental consequences.\n\n==Recycling==\n{{main article|Recycling}}\n[[File:Sign. Mahabalipuram.jpg|thumb|Waste not the Waste. Sign in [[Tamil Nadu]], India]]\n[[File:Steel recycling bales.jpg|thumb|Steel crushed and baled for recycling]]\nRecycling is a [[resource recovery]] practice that refers to the collection and reuse of waste materials such as empty beverage containers. The materials from which the items are made can be reprocessed into new products. Material for recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins and collection vehicles, a procedure called [[kerbside collection]]. In some communities, the owner of the waste is required to separate the materials into different bins (e.g. for paper, plastics, metals) prior to its collection. In other communities, all recyclable materials are placed in a single bin for collection, and the sorting is handled later at a central facility. The latter method is known as \"[[single-stream recycling]].\"<ref>City of Chicago, Illinois. Department of Streets and Sanitation.

These items are usually composed of a single type of material, making them relatively easy to recycle into new products. The recycling of complex products (such as computers and electronic equipment) is more difficult, due to the additional dismantling and separation required.\n\nThe type of  material accepted for recycling varies by city and country. Each city and country has different recycling programs in place that can handle the various types of recyclable materials.  However, certain variation in acceptance is reflected in the resale value of the material once it is reprocessed. In July 2017, the Chinese government announced an import ban of 24 categories of recyclables and solid waste, including plastic, textiles and mixed paper, placing tremendous impact on developed countries globally, which exported directly or indirectly to China.<ref>Walker, T. R. (2018). China's ban on imported plastic waste could be a game changer. Nature, 553(7689), 405-405.</ref>\n\n==Re-use==\n\n===Biological reprocessing===\n{{main article|Composting|Home composting|Anaerobic digestion|Microbial fuel cell}}\n[[File:Compost Heap.jpg|thumb|An active [[compost]] heap.]]\nRecoverable materials that are organic in nature, such as [[Green waste|plant material]], food scraps, and paper products, can be recovered through [[composting]] and digestion processes to [[decompose]] the organic matter. The resulting organic material is then recycled as [[mulch]] or [[compost]] for agricultural or landscaping purposes. In addition, waste gas from the process (such as methane) can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat (CHP/cogeneration) maximising efficiencies. The intention of biological processing in waste management is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter. (See [[resource recovery]]).\n\n===Energy recovery===\n{{main article|Waste-to-energy}}\nEnergy recovery from waste is the conversion of non-recyclable waste materials into usable heat, electricity, or fuel through a variety of processes, including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, anaerobic digestion, and [[landfill gas]] recovery.<ref name=USEPA>{{cite web|publisher=USEPA |year=2014 |title=Energy Recovery from Waste |url=http://www.epa.gov/waste/nonhaz/municipal/wte/}}</ref> This process is often called waste-to-energy. Energy recovery from waste is part of the non-hazardous waste management hierarchy. Using energy recovery to convert non-recyclable waste materials into electricity and heat, generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce methane generation from landfills.<ref name=USEPA/> Globally, waste-to-energy accounts for 16% of waste management.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=New Energy Corporation |year=2014 |title=Waste Hierarchy|url=http://www.newenergycorp.com.au/what-we-do/waste-hierarchy/}}</ref>\n\nThe energy content of waste products can be harnessed directly by using them as a direct combustion fuel, or indirectly by processing them into another type of fuel. Thermal treatment ranges from using waste as a fuel source for cooking or heating and the use of the gas fuel (see above), to fuel for [[boilers]] to generate steam and electricity in a [[turbine]]. [[Pyrolysis]] and [[gasification]] are two related forms of thermal treatment where waste materials are heated to high temperatures with limited [[oxygen]] availability. The process usually occurs in a sealed vessel under high [[pressure]]. Pyrolysis of solid waste converts the material into solid, liquid and gas products. The liquid and gas can be burnt to produce energy or refined into other chemical products (chemical refinery). The solid residue (char) can be further refined into products such as [[activated carbon]]. Gasification and advanced [[Plasma arc gasification]] are used to convert organic materials directly into a synthetic gas ([[syngas]]) composed of [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen]]. The gas is then burnt to produce electricity and [[steam]].\nAn alternative to pyrolysis is high temperature and pressure supercritical water decomposition (hydrothermal monophasic oxidation).\n\n===Pyrolysis===\n{{main article|Pyrolysis}}\nPyrolysis is often used to convert many types of domestic and industrial residues into a recovered fuel. Different types of waste input (such as plant waste, food waste, tyres) placed in the pyrolysis process potentially yield an alternative to fossil fuels.<ref name=TSEP>{{cite journal |date=September 2017 |title= Potential of pyrolysis processes in the waste management sector | journal=Thermal Science and Engineering Progress |volume=3 | pages=171\u2013197 |doi=10.1016/j.tsep.2017.06.003 | last1 = Czajczy\u0144ska | first1 = D. | last2 = Anguilano | first2 = L. | last3 = Ghazal | first3 = H. | last4 = Krzy\u017cy\u0144ska | first4 = R. | last5 = Reynolds | first5 = A.J. | last6 = Spencer | first6 = N. | last7 = Jouhara | first7 = H.| doi-access = free }}</ref> Pyrolysis is a process of thermo-chemical decomposition of organic materials by heat in the absence of stoichiometric quantities of [[oxygen]]; the decomposition produces various hydrocarbon gases.<ref>Oxford Reference \u2013 Pyrolysis</ref> During pyrolysis, the molecules of object vibrate at high frequencies to an extent that molecules start breaking down.

Pyrolysis of waste wood and plastics can potentially produce fuel. The solids left from pyrolysis contain metals, glass, sand and pyrolysis coke which does not convert to gas.  Compared to the process of incineration, certain types of pyrolysis processes release less harmful by-products that contain alkali metals, sulphur, and chlorine. However, pyrolysis of some waste yields gasses which impact the environment such as HCl and SO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=WMJ>{{cite journal |date=December 2014 |title= Pyrolysis technologies for municipal solid waste: A review| journal=Waste Management |volume=34 |issue=12 | pages=2466\u20132486 |doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2014.08.004 |pmid= 25256662| last1 = Chen | first1 = Dezhen | last2 = Yin | first2 = Lijie | last3 = Wang | first3 = Huan | last4 = He | first4 = Pinjing}}</ref>\n\n===Resource recovery===\n{{main article|Resource recovery}}\nResource recovery is the systematic diversion of waste, which was intended for disposal, for a specific next use.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=USEPA |year=2012 |title=Frequent Questions |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/wastemin/minimize/faqs.htm}}</ref> It is the processing of recyclables to extract or recover materials and resources, or convert to energy.<ref name=Montana>{{cite web |publisher=Government of Montana |year=2012 |title=Resource Recovery |url=http://deq.mt.gov/solidwaste/resourcerecovery.mcpx}}</ref> These activities are performed at a resource recovery facility.<ref name=Montana/> Resource recovery is not only environmentally important, but it is also cost-effective.<ref name=traverse>{{cite web |publisher=Grand Traverse County |year=2006 |title=What is Resource Recovery? |url=http://www.co.grand-traverse.mi.us/departments/resource_recovery/What_is_Resource_Recovery_.htm}}</ref> It decreases the amount of waste for disposal, saves space in landfills, and conserves natural resources.<ref name=traverse/>\n\nResource recovery (as opposed to waste management) uses LCA (life cycle analysis) attempts to offer alternatives to waste management. For mixed MSW (Municipal Solid Waste) a number of broad studies have indicated that administration, source separation and collection followed by reuse and recycling of the non-organic fraction and energy and compost/fertilizer production of the organic material via anaerobic digestion to be the favoured path.\n\nAs an example of how resource recycling can be beneficial, many items thrown away contain metals that can be recycled to create a profit, such as the components in circuit boards.  Wood chippings in pallets and other packaging materials can be recycled to useful products for horticulture. The recycled chips can cover paths, walkways, or arena surfaces.\n\nApplication of rational and consistent waste management practices can yield a range of benefits including:\n# Economic \u2013 Improving economic efficiency through the means of resource use, treatment and disposal and creating markets for recycles can lead to efficient practices in the production and consumption of products and materials resulting in valuable materials being recovered for reuse and the potential for new jobs and new business opportunities.\n# Social \u2013 By reducing adverse impacts on health by proper waste management practises, the resulting consequences are more appealing civic communities.

The standard encourages companies to improve their environmental efficiencies each year by eliminating waste through [[resource recovery]] practices. One way to do this is by adopting resource recovery practices like [[recycling]] materials such as glass, food scraps, paper and cardboard, [[plastic bottle]]s and metal.  Recycled materials can often be sold to the [[construction industry]]. Many inorganic waste streams can be used to produce materials for construction. Concrete and bricks can be recycled as artificial gravel.

The hierarchy represents the latter parts of the life-cycle for each product.\n\n===Life-cycle of a product===\nThe life-cycle begins with design, then proceeds through manufacture, distribution, and primary use and then follows through the waste hierarchy's stages of reduce, reuse and recycle.  Each stage in the life-cycle offers opportunities for policy intervention, to rethink the need for the product, to redesign to minimize waste potential, to extend its use.<ref name=UN/>{{page needed|date=November 2016}} Product life-cycle analysis is a way to optimize the use of the world's limited resources by avoiding the unnecessary generation of waste.\n\n===Resource efficiency===\n[[Resource efficiency]] reflects the understanding that global economic growth and development can not be sustained at current production and consumption patterns.

With respect to waste management, this generally refers to the requirement for a waste generator to pay for appropriate disposal of the unrecoverable material.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/faqs/what-is-the-polluter-pays-principle/|title=What is the polluter pays principle?|last=|first=|website=LSE|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 February 2020|date=11 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of waste management}}\nThroughout most of history, the amount of [[waste]] generated by humans was insignificant due to low [[population density]] and low societal levels of the [[exploitation of natural resources]] as well as industrial since a few decades ago. Common waste produced during pre-modern times was mainly ashes and human [[biodegradable waste]], and these were released back into the ground locally, with minimum [[environmental degradation|environmental impact]]. Tools made out of [[wood]] or [[metal]] were generally reused or passed down through the generations.\n\nHowever, some civilizations do seem to have been more profligate in their waste output than others. In particular, the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] of [[Central America]] had a fixed monthly ritual, in which the people of the village would gather together and burn their rubbish in large dumps.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Barbalace |first=Roberta Crowell |url=http://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/environmental/wastehistory.html |title=The History of Waste |publisher=EnvironmentalChemistry.com |date=2003-08-01 |accessdate=2013-12-09}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:SirEdwinChadwick.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir [[Edwin Chadwick]]'s 1842 report ''The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population'' was influential in securing the passage of the first legislation aimed at waste clearance and disposal.]]\nFollowing the onset of [[industrial revolution|industrialisation]] and the sustained urban growth of large population centres in [[England]], the buildup of waste in the cities caused a rapid deterioration in levels of [[sanitation]] and the general quality of urban life.

The [[Garwood Load Packer]] was the first truck in 1938, to incorporate a hydraulic compactor.\n\n==Waste handling and transport==\n{{main article|Waste collection vehicle|Waste collector|Waste sorting}}\n[[File:Bin.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Moulded plastic, wheeled waste bin in [[Berkshire]], England]]\n\nWaste collection methods vary widely among different countries and regions. Domestic waste collection services are often provided by local government authorities, or by private companies for industrial and commercial waste. Some areas, especially those in less developed countries, do not have formal waste-collection systems.\n\n===Waste handling practices===\n[[Curbside collection]] is the most common method of disposal in most European countries, [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[United States]], and many other parts of the developed world in which waste is collected at regular intervals by specialised trucks. This is often associated with curb-side waste segregation. In rural areas waste may need to be taken to a transfer station. Waste collected is then transported to an appropriate disposal facility.\nIn some areas, vacuum collection is used in which waste is transported from the home or commercial premises by vacuum along small bore tubes. Systems are in use in Europe and North America.\n{{main article|Automated vacuum collection}}\nIn some jurisdictions unsegregated waste is collected at the curb-side or from waste transfer stations and then sorted into recyclables and unusable waste. Such systems are capable of sorting large volumes of solid waste, salvaging recyclables, and turning the rest into bio-gas and soil conditioner.\nIn [[San Francisco]], the local government established its ''Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance'' in support of its goal of \"Zero waste by 2020\", requiring everyone in the city to keep recyclables and compostables out of the landfill. The three streams are collected with the curbside \"Fantastic 3\" bin system \u2013 blue for recyclables, green for compostables, and black for landfill-bound materials \u2013 provided to residents and businesses and serviced by San Francisco's sole refuse hauler, Recology. The City's \"Pay-As-You-Throw\" system charges customers by the volume of landfill-bound materials, which provides a financial incentive to separate recyclables and compostables from other discards. The City's Department of the Environment's Zero Waste Program has led the City to achieve 80% diversion, the highest diversion rate in North America.<ref>http://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/features/greencityindex_international/all/en/pdf/report_northamerica_en.pdf</ref> Other businesses such as [[Waste Industries]] use a variety of colors to distinguish between trash and recycling cans.\n\n==Financial models==\nIn most developed countries, domestic waste disposal is funded from a national or local tax which may be related to income, or property values. Commercial and industrial waste disposal is typically charged for as a commercial service, often as an integrated charge which includes disposal costs. This practice may encourage disposal contractors to opt for the cheapest disposal option such as landfill rather than the environmentally best solution such as re-use and recycling.\n\nIn some areas such as [[Taipei]], the city government charges its households and industries for the volume of rubbish they produce. Waste is collected by the city council only if it is put in government issued rubbish bags. This policy has successfully reduced the amount of waste the city produces and increased the recycling rate.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n[[Morocco]] has also seen benefits from implementing a $300 million sanitary [[landfill]] system. While it might appear to be a costly investment, the country's government predicts that it has saved them another $440 million in damages, or consequences of failing to dispose of waste properly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/27/how-the-world-should-cope-with-its-growing-piles-of-rubbish|title=How the world should cope with its growing piles of rubbish|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Disposal methods==\n\n===Landfill===\n{{main article|Landfill}}\n[[File:Landfill compactor.jpg|thumb|A [[Waste compaction|landfill compaction vehicle]] in action.]]\n[[File:District heating plant spittelau ssw crop1.png|thumb|upright|Spittelau incineration plant in [[Vienna]]]]\n\nA landfill is a site for the disposal of [[waste]] materials by burial. Landfill is the oldest form of [[list of solid waste treatment technologies|waste treatment]], although the burial of the waste is modern; historically, refuse was simply left in piles or thrown into pits. Historically, landfills have been the most common method of organized [[waste disposal]] and remain so in many places around the world.\n\n===Incineration===\n{{main article|Incineration}}\nIncineration is a disposal method in which solid organic wastes are subjected to combustion so as to convert them into residue and gaseous products. This method is useful for disposal of both municipal solid waste and solid residue from waste water treatment. This process reduces the volumes of solid waste by 80 to 95 percent.<ref>http://web.mit.edu/urbanupgrading/urbanenvironment/resources/references/pdfs/DecisionMakers.pdf</ref> Incineration and other high temperature waste treatment systems are sometimes described as \"[[thermal treatment]]\". Incinerators convert waste materials into [[heat]], [[gas]], [[steam]], and [[Incineration#Solid outputs|ash]].\n\nIncineration is carried out both on a small scale by individuals and on a large scale by industry. It is used to dispose of solid, liquid and gaseous waste. It is recognized as a practical method of disposing of certain [[hazardous waste]] materials (such as biological [[medical waste]]). Incineration is a controversial method of waste disposal, due to issues such as emission of gaseous [[pollutants]].\n\nIncineration is common in countries such as [[Japan]] where land is more scarce, as the facilities generally do not require as much area as landfills. [[Waste-to-energy]] (WtE) or energy-from-waste (EfW) are broad terms for facilities that burn waste in a furnace or boiler to generate heat, steam or electricity. Combustion in an incinerator is not always perfect and there have been concerns about pollutants in gaseous emissions from incinerator stacks. Particular concern has focused on some very persistent [[organic compound]]s such as [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], [[furan]]s, and [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|PAH]]s, which may be created and which may have serious environmental consequences.\n\n==Recycling==\n{{main article|Recycling}}\n[[File:Sign. Mahabalipuram.jpg|thumb|Waste not the Waste. Sign in [[Tamil Nadu]], India]]\n[[File:Steel recycling bales.jpg|thumb|Steel crushed and baled for recycling]]\nRecycling is a [[resource recovery]] practice that refers to the collection and reuse of waste materials such as empty beverage containers. The materials from which the items are made can be reprocessed into new products. Material for recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins and collection vehicles, a procedure called [[kerbside collection]]. In some communities, the owner of the waste is required to separate the materials into different bins (e.g. for paper, plastics, metals) prior to its collection. In other communities, all recyclable materials are placed in a single bin for collection, and the sorting is handled later at a central facility. The latter method is known as \"[[single-stream recycling]].\"<ref>City of Chicago, Illinois. Department of Streets and Sanitation.

These items are usually composed of a single type of material, making them relatively easy to recycle into new products. The recycling of complex products (such as computers and electronic equipment) is more difficult, due to the additional dismantling and separation required.\n\nThe type of  material accepted for recycling varies by city and country. Each city and country has different recycling programs in place that can handle the various types of recyclable materials.  However, certain variation in acceptance is reflected in the resale value of the material once it is reprocessed. In July 2017, the Chinese government announced an import ban of 24 categories of recyclables and solid waste, including plastic, textiles and mixed paper, placing tremendous impact on developed countries globally, which exported directly or indirectly to China.<ref>Walker, T. R. (2018). China's ban on imported plastic waste could be a game changer. Nature, 553(7689), 405-405.</ref>\n\n==Re-use==\n\n===Biological reprocessing===\n{{main article|Composting|Home composting|Anaerobic digestion|Microbial fuel cell}}\n[[File:Compost Heap.jpg|thumb|An active [[compost]] heap.]]\nRecoverable materials that are organic in nature, such as [[Green waste|plant material]], food scraps, and paper products, can be recovered through [[composting]] and digestion processes to [[decompose]] the organic matter. The resulting organic material is then recycled as [[mulch]] or [[compost]] for agricultural or landscaping purposes. In addition, waste gas from the process (such as methane) can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat (CHP/cogeneration) maximising efficiencies. The intention of biological processing in waste management is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter. (See [[resource recovery]]).\n\n===Energy recovery===\n{{main article|Waste-to-energy}}\nEnergy recovery from waste is the conversion of non-recyclable waste materials into usable heat, electricity, or fuel through a variety of processes, including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, anaerobic digestion, and [[landfill gas]] recovery.<ref name=USEPA>{{cite web|publisher=USEPA |year=2014 |title=Energy Recovery from Waste |url=http://www.epa.gov/waste/nonhaz/municipal/wte/}}</ref> This process is often called waste-to-energy. Energy recovery from waste is part of the non-hazardous waste management hierarchy. Using energy recovery to convert non-recyclable waste materials into electricity and heat, generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce methane generation from landfills.<ref name=USEPA/> Globally, waste-to-energy accounts for 16% of waste management.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=New Energy Corporation |year=2014 |title=Waste Hierarchy|url=http://www.newenergycorp.com.au/what-we-do/waste-hierarchy/}}</ref>\n\nThe energy content of waste products can be harnessed directly by using them as a direct combustion fuel, or indirectly by processing them into another type of fuel. Thermal treatment ranges from using waste as a fuel source for cooking or heating and the use of the gas fuel (see above), to fuel for [[boilers]] to generate steam and electricity in a [[turbine]]. [[Pyrolysis]] and [[gasification]] are two related forms of thermal treatment where waste materials are heated to high temperatures with limited [[oxygen]] availability. The process usually occurs in a sealed vessel under high [[pressure]]. Pyrolysis of solid waste converts the material into solid, liquid and gas products. The liquid and gas can be burnt to produce energy or refined into other chemical products (chemical refinery). The solid residue (char) can be further refined into products such as [[activated carbon]]. Gasification and advanced [[Plasma arc gasification]] are used to convert organic materials directly into a synthetic gas ([[syngas]]) composed of [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen]]. The gas is then burnt to produce electricity and [[steam]].\nAn alternative to pyrolysis is high temperature and pressure supercritical water decomposition (hydrothermal monophasic oxidation).\n\n===Pyrolysis===\n{{main article|Pyrolysis}}\nPyrolysis is often used to convert many types of domestic and industrial residues into a recovered fuel.

Compared to the process of incineration, certain types of pyrolysis processes release less harmful by-products that contain alkali metals, sulphur, and chlorine. However, pyrolysis of some waste yields gasses which impact the environment such as HCl and SO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=WMJ>{{cite journal |date=December 2014 |title= Pyrolysis technologies for municipal solid waste: A review| journal=Waste Management |volume=34 |issue=12 | pages=2466\u20132486 |doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2014.08.004 |pmid= 25256662| last1 = Chen | first1 = Dezhen | last2 = Yin | first2 = Lijie | last3 = Wang | first3 = Huan | last4 = He | first4 = Pinjing}}</ref>\n\n===Resource recovery===\n{{main article|Resource recovery}}\nResource recovery is the systematic diversion of waste, which was intended for disposal, for a specific next use.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=USEPA |year=2012 |title=Frequent Questions |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/wastemin/minimize/faqs.htm}}</ref> It is the processing of recyclables to extract or recover materials and resources, or convert to energy.<ref name=Montana>{{cite web |publisher=Government of Montana |year=2012 |title=Resource Recovery |url=http://deq.mt.gov/solidwaste/resourcerecovery.mcpx}}</ref> These activities are performed at a resource recovery facility.<ref name=Montana/> Resource recovery is not only environmentally important, but it is also cost-effective.<ref name=traverse>{{cite web |publisher=Grand Traverse County |year=2006 |title=What is Resource Recovery? |url=http://www.co.grand-traverse.mi.us/departments/resource_recovery/What_is_Resource_Recovery_.htm}}</ref> It decreases the amount of waste for disposal, saves space in landfills, and conserves natural resources.<ref name=traverse/>\n\nResource recovery (as opposed to waste management) uses LCA (life cycle analysis) attempts to offer alternatives to waste management. For mixed MSW (Municipal Solid Waste) a number of broad studies have indicated that administration, source separation and collection followed by reuse and recycling of the non-organic fraction and energy and compost/fertilizer production of the organic material via anaerobic digestion to be the favoured path.\n\nAs an example of how resource recycling can be beneficial, many items thrown away contain metals that can be recycled to create a profit, such as the components in circuit boards.  Wood chippings in pallets and other packaging materials can be recycled to useful products for horticulture. The recycled chips can cover paths, walkways, or arena surfaces.\n\nApplication of rational and consistent waste management practices can yield a range of benefits including:\n# Economic \u2013 Improving economic efficiency through the means of resource use, treatment and disposal and creating markets for recycles can lead to efficient practices in the production and consumption of products and materials resulting in valuable materials being recovered for reuse and the potential for new jobs and new business opportunities.\n# Social \u2013 By reducing adverse impacts on health by proper waste management practises, the resulting consequences are more appealing civic communities.  Better social advantages can lead to new sources of employment and potentially lifting communities out of poverty especially in some of the developing poorer countries and cities.\n# Environmental \u2013 Reducing or eliminating adverse impacts on the environment through reducing, reusing and recycling, and minimizing resource extraction can result in improved air and water quality and help in the reduction of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.\n# Inter-generational Equity \u2013 Following effective waste management practises can provide subsequent generations a more robust economy, a fairer and more [[social inclusion|inclusive society]] and a cleaner environment.<ref name=UN/>{{page needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Sustainability===\nThe management of waste is a key component in a business' ability to maintain [[ISO14001]] accreditation. The standard encourages companies to improve their environmental efficiencies each year by eliminating waste through [[resource recovery]] practices. One way to do this is by adopting resource recovery practices like [[recycling]] materials such as glass, food scraps, paper and cardboard, [[plastic bottle]]s and metal.  Recycled materials can often be sold to the [[construction industry]]. Many inorganic waste streams can be used to produce materials for construction. Concrete and bricks can be recycled as artificial gravel.

Gros, M.D. (1869\u20131942)|Edmund L.

It had actively recruited its drivers from the campuses of American colleges and universities, promoting morale by creating units with volunteers from the same schools. All financed their own uniforms and transportation to France where they worked under the same conditions as French ambulance drivers\u2014with the same pay\u2014and often found themselves serving under extremely dangerous missions on the Front. By the end of the war, some 127 men who had served with the AFS were killed and a notable number of individuals and units earned the Croix de Guerre and the M\u00e9daille de Guerre for their heroic actions as drivers.<ref>[http://www.ourstory.info/library/2-ww1/AFShist/AFS3i.htm#appc]\u201cDecorations\u201d in History of the American Field Service in France. \u201cFriends of France\u201d. 1914\u20131917.

Later, both would merge \u2014under the American Red Cross\u2014as the \u201cNorton-Harjes\u201d. In the summer and fall of 1917, when all the volunteer ambulance services were invited to join the new U.S. Army Ambulance Service,  Norton\u2019s units simply disbanded, while Harjes\u2019, under the American Red Cross, moved into Italy where they would subsequently serve under the USAAS.\n\nOnce the Americans entered the war, many drivers joined combat units, both French and American, serving as officers in a variety of assignments, notably in air force and artillery units.  At the same time, a large percentage of volunteers signed up for the military, thenceforth members of USAAS units, but remaining identified with their AFS past\u2014a past kept alive through the work of HQ, still at 21 rue Raynouard, where a Bulletin<ref>[http://www.ourstory.info/library/2-ww1/AFSBs/index.html] The American Field Service Bulletins, published at 21, rue Raynouard, Paris, 1917\u20131919.</ref> was published and where visiting ambulance drivers could find temporary lodgings and meals.\n\n=== WWI Publications ===\nThe young AFS drivers came from \"prominent families in the States,\" and had attended, or were still attending, one of almost a hundred prominent colleges or universities around the country.  Also represented were a smaller group from America's professional class: doctors, lawyers, architects, painters, brokers, businessmen, poets and writers.<ref>Friends of France: the Field Service of the American Ambulance described by its members.

The AFS collected many of these writings into ''Friends of France'', published in 1916.  The Service used this volume to recruit more volunteers to the \"gloriously exciting and grandly humanitarian\" work of an ambulancier on the Western Front.<ref>Hansen, Arlen (1996, 2011). Gentlemen Volunteers. Arcade Publishing. p. 39-40.</ref>\n\nAlso published in 1916, ''Ambulance Number 10'', by Leslie Buswell, was composed of the author's letters back to the States.  Buswell went on to assist [[Henry Davis Sleeper|Henry Sleeper]] in the AFS's recruiting and fundraising offices in Boston.\n\nOther literary \"ambulanciers\" brought their letters and journals and memoirs to American publishers in the coming years.  William Yorke Stevenson produced ''To The Front in a Flivver'' in 1917, stayed on in France after militarization, and composed ''From \"Poilu\" to \"Yank\"'' in 1918.<ref>Stevenson, William Yorke.

AFS volunteers are both young and old, busy professionals and retirees, and students and teachers. AFS provides development and training opportunities for volunteers.\n\nAFS volunteers help in many areas including facilitating the AFS mission in the local community and schools by finding and interviewing students and families. Further involvement includes serving as a contact person for an AFS student, organizing fund raising events, and arranging activities for AFS students. As a volunteer-driven organization, AFS depends on donations of time to implement and monitor the delivery of programs.\n\nNotable exception in the AFS network is its presence in China. Here AFS offers an outbound long-term student exchange program since 1997 and an inbound program since 2001. These programs however, are run and administrated by the China Education Association for International Exchange (CEAIE), an organization focusing on teacher exchanges that was founded by the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Education.<ref>AFS Sch\u00fcleraustausch mit China URL: {{cite web|url=http://bildungsserver.hamburg.de/contentblob/2656982/data/china-austausch.pdf |title=China Austasch  |accessdate=2011-08-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216085907/http://bildungsserver.hamburg.de/contentblob/2656982/data/china-austausch.pdf |archivedate=2011-12-16 }} (Stand 9.M\u00e4rz 2005)</ref>\n\n== Statement of purpose ==\nAFS is an international, voluntary, non-governmental, non-profit organization that provides intercultural learning opportunities to help people develop the knowledge, skills and understanding needed to create a more just and peaceful world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afs.org/afs_or/view/about_us |title=AFS Intercultural Programs &#124; Intercultural education worldwide |accessdate=2010-09-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922060553/http://www.afs.org/afs_or/view/about_us |archivedate=2010-09-22 }} About AFS Intercultural Programs</ref>\n\n== Notable AFS Ambulance Corps volunteers ==\n*[[Kirk Browning]]\n*[[Julien Bryan]]\n*[[Preston M.

(a.k.a., AFS-USA) is the AFS partner organisation in the United States and is a registered 501(c)(3). Approximately 1,100 participants go abroad with AFS-USA annually. Over 2,300 international AFS students from AFS-USA partner countries are hosted in the U.S. annually. AFS-USA is supported by a volunteer base of over 5,000. Students aged 15 \u2013 18 may partake in AFS-USA programs, while Gap Programs are available for individuals over 18 years of age on a ''gap year''.\n\n=== AFS-USA Public Diplomacy Initiatives ===\nPublic Diplomacy Initiatives at AFS-USA offer support for international students to study in the United States and for U.S. students to study abroad via full funded scholarships by grant-making foundations or by the Educational and Cultural Affairs Bureau of the U.S. Department of State.\n\n==== Congress Bundestag ====\nThe Congress Bundestag Youth Exchange Program (CBYX) was launched in 1983 by the U.S. Congress and the German Parliament. AFS currently provides 50 merit-based, full scholarships for U.S. students and 60 scholarships for German participants.\nIn Germany it is called the \"Parlamentarisches Patenschafts Programm\" (PPP) and over the years the German authorities have made many efforts to present this as their \"own program\". Not only AFS Germany but all competitors are more or less behind-the-scene service providers so people may not recognized who is doing this program in Germany.\n\n==== National Security Language Initiative for Youth (NSLI-Y) ====\nThe National Security Language Initiative for Youth (NSLI-Y) program is part of a broader government-wide presidential initiative that prepares American citizens to be leaders in a global world. Now more than ever, it is important that Americans have the necessary linguistic skills and cultural knowledge to promote international dialogues, support American engagement abroad, and attain better understanding of global cultures and issues. NSLI-Y encourages a lifetime of language study and cultural understanding by providing more than 600 fully funded scholarships to American high school students.\n\nIn 2018, NSLI-Y offers academic scholarships to learn Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Persian (Tajiki), Russian, and Turkish through summer and year-long programs in China, Morocco, Oman, Jordan, India, Korea, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkey, Taiwan, Indonesia, and other countries around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsliforyouth.org/languages-and-programs/|title=Languages and Programs|website=www.nsliforyouth.org|access-date=2012-05-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424231003/http://www.nsliforyouth.org/languages-and-programs/|archive-date=2012-04-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Future Leaders Exchange (FLEX) ====\nThe Future Leaders Exchange (FLEX) program originated in the FREEDOM Support Act, which was sponsored by U.S. Senator Bill Bradley and was passed by Congress in 1992. FLEX provides full merit-based scholarships to students from the countries of the former Soviet Union.\n\n==== Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study (YES) ====\nKennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study (YES) was initiated by The Department of State in the aftermath of Sept. 11. It aims to build bridges of understanding between Americans and people in countries with significant Muslim populations.\n\n=== AFS-USA Scholarships ===\nAFS-USA awards more than $3 million in financial aid and scholarships to students each year. More than 40% of AFS-USA participants receive some form of financial assistance each year either need-based, merit-based or both. A partial list of scholarships and financial aid:\n* ''Global Leaders'' is the primary AFS scholarship program, offering partial need and merit-based scholarships to qualified applicants.\n* ''Faces of America'' is AFS-USA\u2019s signature diversity program and makes it possible for high school students from underserved communities to receive scholarship awards to study abroad in more than 23 countries around the world.\n* ''AFS Family Scholarships'' are awards are given to applicants who are former host family members, returnees, children of returnees, and of descendants of AFS Ambulance Drivers.\n* The ''Yoshi Hattori Memorial Scholarship'' is a merit-based scholarship is designed to promote intercultural understanding and peace, and was created in memory of Yoshi Hattori, an AFS Exchange Student to the U.S. from Japan.\n* The ''Toshiyuki Tanaka American Embassy Scholarship'' is a need-based and merit-based scholarship awarded through the Pacific Affairs Section (PAS) of the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo and the generosity of Mr. Toshiyuki Tanaka.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*\"Friends of France: the Field Service of the American Ambulance,\" described by its members.

Gros, M.D. (1869\u20131942)|Edmund L.

It had actively recruited its drivers from the campuses of American colleges and universities, promoting morale by creating units with volunteers from the same schools. All financed their own uniforms and transportation to France where they worked under the same conditions as French ambulance drivers\u2014with the same pay\u2014and often found themselves serving under extremely dangerous missions on the Front. By the end of the war, some 127 men who had served with the AFS were killed and a notable number of individuals and units earned the Croix de Guerre and the M\u00e9daille de Guerre for their heroic actions as drivers.<ref>[http://www.ourstory.info/library/2-ww1/AFShist/AFS3i.htm#appc]\u201cDecorations\u201d in History of the American Field Service in France. \u201cFriends of France\u201d. 1914\u20131917.

The first was Henry Harjes\u2019 \u201cFormation\u201d units under the American Red Cross,<ref>[http://www.ourstory.info/library/catalog.html#ww1-7] The Harjes Formation</ref> followed by Richard Norton\u2019s American Volunteer Motor-Ambulance Corps,<ref>[http://www.ourstory.info/library/2-ww1/Harvard/HGMdec18.html] William Fenwick Harris. \u201cRichard Norton, 1872-1918\u201d in Harvard Graduates' Magazine, December 1918.</ref> organized in London under the St. John\u2019s Ambulance (the British Red Cross). Later, both would merge \u2014under the American Red Cross\u2014as the \u201cNorton-Harjes\u201d. In the summer and fall of 1917, when all the volunteer ambulance services were invited to join the new U.S. Army Ambulance Service,  Norton\u2019s units simply disbanded, while Harjes\u2019, under the American Red Cross, moved into Italy where they would subsequently serve under the USAAS.\n\nOnce the Americans entered the war, many drivers joined combat units, both French and American, serving as officers in a variety of assignments, notably in air force and artillery units.  At the same time, a large percentage of volunteers signed up for the military, thenceforth members of USAAS units, but remaining identified with their AFS past\u2014a past kept alive through the work of HQ, still at 21 rue Raynouard, where a Bulletin<ref>[http://www.ourstory.info/library/2-ww1/AFSBs/index.html] The American Field Service Bulletins, published at 21, rue Raynouard, Paris, 1917\u20131919.</ref> was published and where visiting ambulance drivers could find temporary lodgings and meals.\n\n=== WWI Publications ===\nThe young AFS drivers came from \"prominent families in the States,\" and had attended, or were still attending, one of almost a hundred prominent colleges or universities around the country.  Also represented were a smaller group from America's professional class: doctors, lawyers, architects, painters, brokers, businessmen, poets and writers.<ref>Friends of France: the Field Service of the American Ambulance described by its members.

Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1920, p. 7.</ref>  This literate group produced many letters, diaries, journals, and even poetry.  The AFS collected many of these writings into ''Friends of France'', published in 1916.  The Service used this volume to recruit more volunteers to the \"gloriously exciting and grandly humanitarian\" work of an ambulancier on the Western Front.<ref>Hansen, Arlen (1996, 2011). Gentlemen Volunteers. Arcade Publishing. p. 39-40.</ref>\n\nAlso published in 1916, ''Ambulance Number 10'', by Leslie Buswell, was composed of the author's letters back to the States.  Buswell went on to assist [[Henry Davis Sleeper|Henry Sleeper]] in the AFS's recruiting and fundraising offices in Boston.\n\nOther literary \"ambulanciers\" brought their letters and journals and memoirs to American publishers in the coming years.  William Yorke Stevenson produced ''To The Front in a Flivver'' in 1917, stayed on in France after militarization, and composed ''From \"Poilu\" to \"Yank\"'' in 1918.<ref>Stevenson, William Yorke.

During the 1947\u201348 school year, the first students came from ten countries including [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Estonia]], [[France]], [[Great Britain]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]] and [[Syria]]. Students participating had to be nominated by their teachers, and Paula Reid, a high school student from the Westminster Schools, was indeed nominated. \n\n{{Wikisource|Ambulance 464|''Ambulance 464'' by Julien Bryan}}\n\n=== Modern day ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:afs australia.jpg|thumb|[[AFS Australia|AFS Safari]], group of exchange students hosted in Australia]] -->\n[[File:AFS New mexico Western Life Camp.jpg|thumb|New Mexico Western Life Camp, AFS New Mexico Area Team (NMAT)]]\n{{As of|2014}}, there are over 55 AFS organizations worldwide serving over 80 different countries, providing exchange opportunities for over 13,000 students and teachers annually.\n\nAFS is one of the largest volunteer-based organizations of its kind in the world with more than 440,000 volunteers worldwide and more than 5,000 in the U.S. Tens of thousands of volunteers and a small staff make the AFS program happen worldwide. AFS volunteers are both young and old, busy professionals and retirees, and students and teachers. AFS provides development and training opportunities for volunteers.\n\nAFS volunteers help in many areas including facilitating the AFS mission in the local community and schools by finding and interviewing students and families. Further involvement includes serving as a contact person for an AFS student, organizing fund raising events, and arranging activities for AFS students. As a volunteer-driven organization, AFS depends on donations of time to implement and monitor the delivery of programs.\n\nNotable exception in the AFS network is its presence in China. Here AFS offers an outbound long-term student exchange program since 1997 and an inbound program since 2001. These programs however, are run and administrated by the China Education Association for International Exchange (CEAIE), an organization focusing on teacher exchanges that was founded by the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Education.<ref>AFS Sch\u00fcleraustausch mit China URL: {{cite web|url=http://bildungsserver.hamburg.de/contentblob/2656982/data/china-austausch.pdf |title=China Austasch  |accessdate=2011-08-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216085907/http://bildungsserver.hamburg.de/contentblob/2656982/data/china-austausch.pdf |archivedate=2011-12-16 }} (Stand 9.M\u00e4rz 2005)</ref>\n\n== Statement of purpose ==\nAFS is an international, voluntary, non-governmental, non-profit organization that provides intercultural learning opportunities to help people develop the knowledge, skills and understanding needed to create a more just and peaceful world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afs.org/afs_or/view/about_us |title=AFS Intercultural Programs &#124; Intercultural education worldwide |accessdate=2010-09-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922060553/http://www.afs.org/afs_or/view/about_us |archivedate=2010-09-22 }} About AFS Intercultural Programs</ref>\n\n== Notable AFS Ambulance Corps volunteers ==\n*[[Kirk Browning]]\n*[[Julien Bryan]]\n*[[Preston M.

(a.k.a., AFS-USA) is the AFS partner organisation in the United States and is a registered 501(c)(3). Approximately 1,100 participants go abroad with AFS-USA annually. Over 2,300 international AFS students from AFS-USA partner countries are hosted in the U.S. annually. AFS-USA is supported by a volunteer base of over 5,000. Students aged 15 \u2013 18 may partake in AFS-USA programs, while Gap Programs are available for individuals over 18 years of age on a ''gap year''.\n\n=== AFS-USA Public Diplomacy Initiatives ===\nPublic Diplomacy Initiatives at AFS-USA offer support for international students to study in the United States and for U.S. students to study abroad via full funded scholarships by grant-making foundations or by the Educational and Cultural Affairs Bureau of the U.S. Department of State.\n\n==== Congress Bundestag ====\nThe Congress Bundestag Youth Exchange Program (CBYX) was launched in 1983 by the U.S. Congress and the German Parliament. AFS currently provides 50 merit-based, full scholarships for U.S. students and 60 scholarships for German participants.\nIn Germany it is called the \"Parlamentarisches Patenschafts Programm\" (PPP) and over the years the German authorities have made many efforts to present this as their \"own program\". Not only AFS Germany but all competitors are more or less behind-the-scene service providers so people may not recognized who is doing this program in Germany.\n\n==== National Security Language Initiative for Youth (NSLI-Y) ====\nThe National Security Language Initiative for Youth (NSLI-Y) program is part of a broader government-wide presidential initiative that prepares American citizens to be leaders in a global world. Now more than ever, it is important that Americans have the necessary linguistic skills and cultural knowledge to promote international dialogues, support American engagement abroad, and attain better understanding of global cultures and issues. NSLI-Y encourages a lifetime of language study and cultural understanding by providing more than 600 fully funded scholarships to American high school students.\n\nIn 2018, NSLI-Y offers academic scholarships to learn Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Persian (Tajiki), Russian, and Turkish through summer and year-long programs in China, Morocco, Oman, Jordan, India, Korea, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkey, Taiwan, Indonesia, and other countries around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsliforyouth.org/languages-and-programs/|title=Languages and Programs|website=www.nsliforyouth.org|access-date=2012-05-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424231003/http://www.nsliforyouth.org/languages-and-programs/|archive-date=2012-04-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Future Leaders Exchange (FLEX) ====\nThe Future Leaders Exchange (FLEX) program originated in the FREEDOM Support Act, which was sponsored by U.S. Senator Bill Bradley and was passed by Congress in 1992. FLEX provides full merit-based scholarships to students from the countries of the former Soviet Union.\n\n==== Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study (YES) ====\nKennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study (YES) was initiated by The Department of State in the aftermath of Sept. 11. It aims to build bridges of understanding between Americans and people in countries with significant Muslim populations.\n\n=== AFS-USA Scholarships ===\nAFS-USA awards more than $3 million in financial aid and scholarships to students each year. More than 40% of AFS-USA participants receive some form of financial assistance each year either need-based, merit-based or both. A partial list of scholarships and financial aid:\n* ''Global Leaders'' is the primary AFS scholarship program, offering partial need and merit-based scholarships to qualified applicants.\n* ''Faces of America'' is AFS-USA\u2019s signature diversity program and makes it possible for high school students from underserved communities to receive scholarship awards to study abroad in more than 23 countries around the world.\n* ''AFS Family Scholarships'' are awards are given to applicants who are former host family members, returnees, children of returnees, and of descendants of AFS Ambulance Drivers.\n* The ''Yoshi Hattori Memorial Scholarship'' is a merit-based scholarship is designed to promote intercultural understanding and peace, and was created in memory of Yoshi Hattori, an AFS Exchange Student to the U.S. from Japan.\n* The ''Toshiyuki Tanaka American Embassy Scholarship'' is a need-based and merit-based scholarship awarded through the Pacific Affairs Section (PAS) of the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo and the generosity of Mr. Toshiyuki Tanaka.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*\"Friends of France: the Field Service of the American Ambulance,\" described by its members.

The Secretary of State develops proposals on main dimensions of domestic and foreign policies for the President. At the request of the President, the Secretary of State represents his interests in international affairs, in relations with the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan, state bodies, political parties and other public organizations.\n\nHe served as Kazakhstan's [[ambassador]] to the [[United States]] from December 2000 until the [[Kazakhstan political shakeup of 2007|political shakeup of 2007]], when [[President of Kazakhstan|President]] [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] promoted him to the position of the Secretary of State.\n\nIn Washington, Saudabayev brought an important contribution strengthening the strategic partnership between Kazakhstan and the USA in the spheres of security, nuclear disarmament, economy and democratic development.\n\nBefore his appointment to the U.S., Ambassador Saudabayev had a long career in the fields of government, diplomacy and the arts.\n\nIn 1999 and 2000, he served as the head of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office with the rank of Cabinet member.\n \nIn the 1990s, he served as Kazakhstan\u2019s Ambassador to the [[United Kingdom]] of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and to [[Turkey]].

He was Kazakhstan\u2019s signatory to NATO\u2019s Partnership for Peace agreement.\n\nIn the fall of 1991, President [[Mikhail S. Gorbachev]] appointed Kanat Saudabayev as the Soviet Ambassador to Turkey. As he was planning to take up his post, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. Within weeks Kanat Saudabayev was on his way to Turkey again, but as the first Ambassador ever from an independent Kazakhstan.\n\nWorking in Moscow from September 1991 through May 1992 as the Plenipotentiary Representative of the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]] to the USSR, and then, after the Soviet Union collapsed, to the [[Russian Federation]], Kanat Saudabayev was a direct participant in and a witness to many crucial events of that time.\n\nBefore entering the diplomatic service, Kanat Saudabayev had a distinguished cultural career, serving as Kazakhstan\u2019s Chairman of the State Committee of Culture with the rank of Minister, Chairman of the State Film Committee, and Deputy Culture Minister. He began his career as a theatrical producer.\n \nKanat Saudabayev holds degrees from the [[Leningrad Institute of Culture]] and the [[Academy of Public Sciences of the Central Committee of Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].
