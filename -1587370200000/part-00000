In the film, Forrest is a philanthropist and a war veteran, businessman, and college football player who bears witness to various significant occurrences in the 20th century. He exudes a [[compassion|compassionate]], optimistic, and tenacious attitude in the face of countless setbacks and strives to help every person he meets despite his strong [[naivety]]. Throughout his life, he maintains a sincere [[love]] for his childhood friend Jennifer Curran, who eventually becomes his wife. [[Tom Hanks]] portrayed the character in the film and earned an [[Academy Award]] for his performance, while [[Michael Conner Humphreys]] portrayed Forrest as a child. \n\nIn 2008, Forrest Gump was named the 20th greatest movie character of all time by ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine.<ref>[http://www.empireonline.com/100-greatest-movie-characters/default.asp?c=20 \"100 greatest movie characters\"] on ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Early years===\nForrest was born near the small town of Greenbow, [[Alabama]], on June 6, 1944. His father was absent during his life, and his mother said he was \"on vacation\". His mother named Forrest after their ancestor [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]], a [[Scotch-Irish American]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ah-nathanforrest.html|title=Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forest|publisher=}}</ref> and a noted [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general in the [[American Civil War]] and the first [[Grand Wizard]] of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. She intended his name to be a reminder that \"sometimes we all do things that, well, just don't make no sense\".\n\nForrest was born with strong legs but a crooked [[Vertebral column|spine]]. He was forced to wear [[brace (orthopaedic)|leg braces]] which made walking difficult and running nearly impossible. He also had a relatively low [[intelligence quotient|I.Q.]] of 75, which nearly prevented him from being accepted into public school. (His mother managed to get the principal to reconsider by letting him [[Sexual intercourse|sleep with]] her.) Despite his physical and mental challenges, Forrest's mother told him not to let anyone tell him he was different, telling him \"stupid is as stupid does\".\n\nForrest and his mother lived in a large house just outside the town of Greenbow. They made money by renting out rooms to travelers. One of their guests was a young [[Elvis Presley]]. Forrest liked dancing to Elvis' music and his leg braces gave him a unique dancing style that would inspire Elvis's \"hip dancing\", for his song \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\".\n\nOn the bus ride on Forrest's first day of school, Forrest met Jenny Curran and was instantly taken by her. \"I had never seen anything so beautiful in my life,\" he would later say of her, \"she was like an angel.\" The two became close friends, often playing around a large nearby tree. Forrest described their relationship saying, \"Jenny and me was like peas and carrots.\" Jenny was one of the few people besides his mother to accept Forrest as he was, helping him learn to read and stand up to bullies who harassed him. However, Jenny's home life was not nearly as happy as Forrest's: her mother had died when she was five and her father was an abusive alcoholic who molested and beat his children (until Jenny was taken away to live with her grandmother), and Forrest's friendship offered her an escape.\n\nOne day, a group of bullies was throwing rocks at Forrest, and one of them cut his forehead. Jenny told Forrest, \"Run Forrest run!\", which he did, only to prompt the bullies to chase him on their bikes. As Forrest struggled to run, his leg braces broke apart. Once he was free of them, Forrest was able to run incredibly fast. Forrest would never wear leg braces again, and was able to run anywhere he wanted to after that.\n\n===College===\nForrest and Jenny remained close friends all the way through high school, though he remained a target for bullies. One day, while running from some bullies, he interrupted the local high school's football practice by running across the field faster than all the players. This feat caught the attention of [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama Crimson Tide]] head football coach [[Bear Bryant|Paul \"Bear\" Bryant]], who was at the practice scouting [[American football|football players]]. After his incredible running ability impressed the coach, Forrest received a football scholarship to the [[University of Alabama]], where his speed helped them win several games. He played for five years and wore jersey number 44, which is believed to be a reference to his birth year. He was later named to the [[All-America]]n team and got to meet President [[John F. Kennedy]] at the [[White House]]. When asked by the President how he felt, Forrest (having drunk about fifteen [[Dr. Pepper]]s) gave an honest answer: \"I gotta pee.\"\n\nForrest was also present at the University when it was [[desegregation|desegregated]] and observed Governor [[George Wallace]]'s [[Stand in the Schoolhouse Door]], denouncing the desegregation. While several citizens jeered the black students entering the campus, Forrest, not entirely understanding the situation, simply walked up to [[Vivian Malone Jones|Vivian Malone]] and handed her a book she dropped, saying simply \"Ma'am? You dropped your book...ma'am?\" before following her and [[James Hood]] into school, causing his coaches to watch the incident in disbelief. Forrest later spends time with Jenny in her college dormitory during a rainy day after she had gotten abused by another college boy.\n\n===In the Army===\nAt his college graduation in 1967, Forrest was approached by an army recruiter who asked if he'd \"...given any thought to his future\". Soon after, Forrest would join the [[United States Department of the Army|United States Army]]. On the bus going to boot camp, Forrest met Benjamin Buford Blue, a young black man from [[Bayou La Batre, Alabama]], who went by the nickname \"Bubba\". Bubba told Forrest about his family history of cooking [[shrimp]] and how he had planned to buy his own [[Shrimp fishery|shrimping boat]] after getting out of the army. Bubba explains to Forrest that he loves all kinds of shrimp, and makes a long list of different types, with Forrest being the only one to really listen to him.\n\nForrest did well in the army as he followed orders well without distraction; for example, he set a new [[Company (military unit)|company]] record for assembling his [[M14 rifle]] with his drill sergeant, who regularly singled him out as an example for the other recruits, replying he would be an Army General. Meanwhile, while Jenny was having multiple relationships with different men, having been kicked out of school for wearing her school sweater to pose in ''[[Playboy]]'', she had gotten work singing in the nude at a strip club in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] under the stage name 'Bobbie Dylan'. Forrest goes to visit her at the club, and gets into a fight with some patrons who are harassing her during her performance. During an argument that takes place shortly after, Forrest tells Jenny that he loves her, but Jenny replies that he \"doesn't know what love is\". Jenny is angry, but later becomes concerned when he tells her he was being deployed to [[Vietnam]] to serve in the [[Vietnam War]]. Jenny tells him not to try being brave if he was ever in trouble and to just run away instead.\n\nWhile in Vietnam, and assigned to [[47th Infantry Regiment (United States)|company A, 2/47th Infantry, 3rd Brigade]], [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]],<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/trivia</ref> Forrest and Bubba meet their platoon leader Lieutenant Dan Taylor, whom Forrest would refer to as \"Lieutenant Dan\". While on patrol, Bubba proposed that he and Forrest go into the shrimping business together after their time in the army was finished, and Forrest agreed.\n\nAfter several uneventful months, their platoon was ambushed by the [[Viet Cong]] and several soldiers were wounded and killed. In the confusion, Forrest initially was ordered to retreat, and was separated from the rest of his platoon, but after becoming concerned for Bubba, he ran back to look for him. Forrest then found Lieutenant Dan and several other wounded soldiers and carried them to safety before continuing to look for Bubba. Forrest finally found Bubba badly wounded and managed to carry him away from the combat area before it was hit with [[napalm]] from an air strike. Sadly, Bubba died of complications from his wounds soon after; his last words were \"I wanna go home.\"\n\nForrest himself was shot in the [[buttocks]] durilng the firefight and recovered in an army medical center in [[Saigon]]. Lieutenant Dan was in the bed next to his, having lost his legs because of his injuries. Lieutenant Dan later became angry at Forrest for cheating him out of his destiny to die in battle with honor (as several of his ancestors had) and rendering him crippled.\n\n===Washington, D.C.===\nForrest later receives the [[Medal of hooooooonor]] for his bravery in Vietnam. When being awarded, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] asked where he was hit and when Forrest told him, the President whispered in his ear, saying he'd like to see it someday. Forrest promptly lowered his trousers and turned to show him his wound (while on national ). President Johnson simply smiles and walks away.\n\nShortly thereafter, Forrest went out sightseeing in Washington, D.C. and accidentally found himself among a group of veterans attending an anti-war rally led by [[Abbie Hoffman]]. While making a speech at the rally that was rudely cut off by a policeman, he was reunited with Jenny, who had since become a [[hippie]]. Forrest was less enamored with her new boyfriend Wesley, the president of the [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|SDS]] at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], and beat him up after he saw him hit Jenny during an argument at a [[Black Panther Party]] gathering. Forrest and Jenny stayed up all night while Jenny told Forrest of her travels. Before they went their separate ways again in the morning, Forrest gave Jenny his Medal of Honor, saying \"I got it just by doing what you told me to do,\" since Jenny told him to just run away instead of being brave in combat.\n\n===Ping Pong and New York City===\nIn 1969, Forrest joined the Army Special Services, where he entertained wounded military veterans with his Ping-Pong skills. His exceptional skills earned him a place in the All-American Ping Pong team, with whom he traveled to China during the [[Ping Pong Diplomacy]] period of the early 1970s. Upon his return, Forrest was a national celebrity, \"famous-er even than [[Captain Kangaroo]]\", and was invited to New York City by [[Dick Cavett]] to appear on [[The Dick Cavett Show]], where [[John Lennon]] was also a guest at the time. Hearing Forrest talking about the Chinese having \"no possessions\" and \"no religion\" during his interview with Dick would eventually inspire John Lennon to write the song \"[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]\".\n\nSoon after, Forrest reunites and stays with Lieutenant Dan, his platoon leader from Vietnam and now using a wheelchair, over the winter holidays. Dan has since became an alcoholic who has lost all faith in God, and was dismayed that such an \"imbecile\" like Forrest could earn the Medal of Honor and humiliate himself on national television. During a New Year's Eve celebration in 1971, Forrest persuades Lieutenant Dan to join him in the shrimping business as his first mate, in an effort to fulfill his promise made to Bubba earlier in Vietnam. Dan later invites two prostitutes, Carla and Lenore, to his New Year's Day party, both of whom he eventually kicked out of his apartment for insulting Forrest when Forrest rejected their advances. Forrest apologizes to Dan for ruining his party, to which Dan replied by simply wishing Forrest Happy New Year.\n\nIn June 1972, Forrest was invited with the US Ping Pong team to the White House, where he meets President [[Richard Nixon]], who offers him a room to stay in at Watergate Hotel. That night, Forrest was awakened by a group of people with flashlights breaking into an unlit office. Mistaking it for a power outage, Forrest calls security guard [[Frank Wills (security guard)|Frank Wills]] to inform him about the break-in, inadvertently initiating the [[Watergate Scandal]] and leading to Richard Nixon's resignation in August 1974. In that same year, Forrest was honorably discharged from the Army with the rank of Sergeant.\n\n===Shrimping Boat Captain of erect third leg===\nUpon his return in August 1974, Forrest finds his Greenbow house filled with memorabilia capitalizing on his fame as a ping-pong player in China. At his mother's insistence, Forrest made $25,000 endorsing a brand of ping-pong paddles, and used most of the money to travel to Bubba's hometown of Bayou La Batre and purchase a boat. When someone pointed out it was bad luck to have a boat without a name, Forrest names his boat after Jenny, which he calls, \"The most beautiful name in the whole wide world.\" Unbeknownst to Forrest, Jenny had descended into a life of drugs, burglary and sexual promiscuity at this point, but an event in which she nearly slips and falls off a balcony as she \"contemplates\" suicide while high on drugs in a Los Angeles apartment shakes her to her core.\n\nLater Forrest was visited by Lieutenant Dan who, just as he said he would do on New Year's Eve of 1971, had come to be Forrest's first mate. For several weeks, the two had no luck catching shrimp. However, things changed when the area was hit by [[Hurricane Carmen]]. Forrest's boat was the only one left standing and they found themselves with a monopoly of shrimp. Under the name [[Bubba Gump Shrimp Company]], they soon became very wealthy. Apparently having faced his demons during the storm, Lieutenant Dan thanked Forrest for saving his life in Vietnam, and Forrest assumes that Dan (without actually saying so) made peace with God.\n\n===Home in Alabama===\nForrest returned home to Greenbow in September 1975 when he learned his mother was dying of cancer. After her death, Forrest stays and leaves his shrimping industry in the hands of Lie utenant Dan and retired to mowing and cutting grass and lawns, as he apparently enjoys doing it. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Dan participated in a substantial  inve stment into  what Forrest sa ys to be \"some kind of fruit company\". In reality, the company was the fledgling [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]. With the mone y he g ot from t he Apple C omputer investment, For rest spent them on renovating the church he frequents, establishing a medical center at Bubba's ho metown and gave B ubba's family Bubba ' s share of the investment money that is enough for them to never work again.\n \nJenny returned to Greenbow and moves in with Forrest. The two spent time together catching up, and Forrest later describes it as \"the happiest time of [his] life again\".  One day, they happen to  walk pas t the now abandoned house that had belonged to Jenny's father. She stares transfixed for a moment, and then starts throwing every rock sh e can find at it, befo re collapsing i despair, and now Forres t truly understa nds the ordeal she had been through as a child. Another night,  July 4, 1976, Forrest ask ed Jenny to marry him, but she turns h im down, saying \"You don't want to marry me.\" Forrest replies with, \"Why don't you love me Jenny? I'm no t a smart man, but I know what love is.\" Aft er this exchange, Jenny comes to Forrest's bedroom, tells him she loves him, and the two make love. Wanting to restart on her own, Jenny hails a cab very early the next morning and leaves before he wakes up.\n\n===Running===\nForrest's new-found loneliness leads him to take a run \"for no particular reason\". At first, he decides to run to the end of the road, then across town, then across the county, then all the way to the Mississippi border. Eventually, he criss-crosses the country several times over a span of three years. Forrest attracts media coverage, and eventually, dozens of followers initiating and inspiring what would become the [[Running boom of the 1970s|jogging craze]] of 1978\u201381. Meanwhile, Jenny has taken a job as a waitress in [[Savannah, Georgia]] and sees news coverage of Forrest's run on television. During the run, he inspires the phrase \"[[Shit happens]]\" to a bumper-sticker salesman after stepping in a pile of dog droppings. He also uses a yellow T-shirt provided to him by a shirt designer to wipe off his face after being splattered by mud from a big rig. In the process, he forms the iconic \"[[Smiley|Smiley face]]\" logo and tells the man \"Have a nice day.\" One day, while running in the [[Western United States]], Forrest suddenly stops; his followers all stop and listen on in anticipation, expecting him to offer words of wisdom, but instead he simply announces that he's tired, then turns around and walks back to Alabama, leaving his followers dumbfounded at his sudden decision.\n\n===Back to the present===\nBack to the present (the \"present\" in the film being 1981, as seen from a car and on a bus, and televised footage of [[Reagan assassination attempt|Ronald Reagan's escape from assassination]]), Forrest tells his latest companion on the bench, an elderly woman, that he had recently received a letter from Jenny asking him to come see her. When told Forrest's destination, the old lady informs him that it is only 5 to 6 blocks away. Thanking her, Forrest sets off on foot towards Jenny's home.\n\nForrest and Jenny are happy to see each other. However, before they can do much catching up, Forrest is introduced to Jenny's young son, a bright young boy whom she named Forrest after him. Forrest at first thinks she met another man named Forrest, until she explains \"You're his daddy, Forrest.\" Forrest's fearful inquiry as to Little Forrest's intelligence leads Jenny to quickly assert that he is completely normal. Forrest learns that Jenny is sick from an unknown virus (implied to be either HIV or Hepatitis C, as both were unknown diseases at that time) which has no known cure. He invites her and Little Forrest to come home and stay with him. She asks him to marry her and he accepts.\n\nForrest and Jenny's wedding is a quiet, intimate ceremony attended only by a handful of family and friends. Among the attendees is Lieutenant Dan, who has titanium prosthetic legs, (claiming to be made of the same material as the Space Shuttle), with his Vietnamese fianc\u00e9e Susan. It is the only time Jenny and Dan meet. Forrest, Jenny and Little Forrest only have a year together as a family before Jenny would die on a Saturday. Before she dies, she asked Forrest what it was like in Vietnam. He responded by saying that it was nice, and when it stopped raining, it would be quiet and peaceful. He also states that while running in Oregon, it looked as if there were two skies and two mountains (since there was a lake in front of the mountain). Forrest also states that while running in the desert, when the sun was rising, it was the most beautiful sight ever.\n\nJenny responds by saying that she wished she was there with him. Forrest smiles and says, \"You were there with me\". Forrest has her buried under the tree where they played as children, then buys her childhood home (where her father had abused her) and has it bulldozed. Though he misses Jenny terribly, Forrest becomes a good father to Little Forrest.\n\nVisiting Jenny's grave one day in 1982, he reflects on the idea of fate and destiny, wondering if his mother was right about people having their own destiny, or if  Lieutenant Dan was right about description of life as floating around accidentally like on a breeze. Forrest eventually decides \"maybe it's both, maybe both are happening at the same time.\" He leaves Jenny a letter from Little Forrest and tells her \"If there's anything you need, I won't be far away.\"\n\nForrest is last seen outside his home, sitting where he and his mother sat waiting for the bus, seeing Little Forrest off on his bus ride to school, telling him that he loves him and that he will be waiting for him.\n\n==Differences from the novel==\n{{original research section|date=July 2015}}\n[[File:Forrest Gump brick.jpg|thumb|Forrest Gump brick in front of the Lucas Theater in Savannah, Georgia, USA]]\nThe portrayal of Forrest in the original novel differs from how he was portrayed in the film. In the novel, Forrest is shown to be somewhat cynical and abrasive, while in the film, he is more placid and na\u00efve. The novel also describes him as being a savant with extraordinary talent in numerical calculation (as shown when he states the exact amount of time in years, months, days and hours that he spent running across the country). Other changes from the novel to the film include the deaths of Forrest's mother and his wife, Jenny, neither of whom died in the book. Whilst the film has him running around the country for over three long years, the novel sends him rocketing into space and later crash-landing in New Guinea and being captured by a tribe of cannibals.\n\nThe novel also provides additional backstory on his father. It is revealed that his father was a [[stevedore|longshoreman]] who worked for [[United Fruit Company]]. He was killed when a crate of bananas being loaded off of a boat fell on top of him, crushing him to death. Forrest goes on a number of different adventures including being an [[astronaut]], playing the harmonica in a band called the Cracked Eggs, becoming a professional wrestler (\"The Dunce\") and running for the [[United States Senate]] (with the campaign slogan \"We Got to Pee\").\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Forrest Gump}}\n{{Forbes Fictional 15}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gump, Forrest}}\n[[Category:Characters in American novels of the 20th century]]\n[[Category:Drama film characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Alabama]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with disability]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with disfigurements]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1986]]\n[[Category:Fictional players of American football]]\n[[Category:Fictional janitors]]\n[[Category:Fictional sea captains]]\n[[Category:Fictional military captains]]\n[[Category:Fictional musicians]]\n[[Category:Fictional fishers]]\n[[Category:Fictional privates]]\n[[Category:Fictional military sergeants]]\n[[Category:Fictional Vietnam War veterans]]\n[[Category:Fictional victims of bullies]]\n[[Category:Fictional Medal of Honor recipients]]\n[[Category:Fictional runners]]\n[[Category:Fictional professional wrestlers]]\n[[Category:Fictional table tennis players]]\n[[Category:Fictional United States Army personnel]]\n[[Category:Male characters in film]]\n[[Category:Male characters in literature]]\n[[Category:Military humor]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=July 2015}}\n{{In-universe|date=May 2011}}\n}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2011}}\n\n{{Infobox character\n| colour = blue\n| name = Forrest Gump\n| series = [[Forrest Gump]]\n| image = Forest Gump Character.jpg\n| caption = Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump in the eponymous film\n| gender = Male\n| occupation =  Philanthropist<br/> [[Ping-pong]] player (formerly)<br/> [[Shrimping]] boat captain (formerly)<br/> [[Vietnam War]] sergeant (formerly)<br /> College football player (formerly)<br/>\n| family = Mrs. Gump (mother)<br/>''(deceased)''<br>Unnamed father ''(deceased)\n| spouse = Jennifer \"Jenny\" Gump (nee Curran)<br/>''(deceased)'' \n| children = Forrest Gump, Jr.\n| portrayer = [[Tom Hanks]]<br> (adult)<br/> [[Michael Conner Humphreys]]<br> (child)\n| first   = [[Forrest Gump (novel)|Forrest Gump (1986 Novel)]]\n| creator = '''Novel character'''<br/>[[Winston Groom]]<br/>'''Film character'''<br/>[[Eric Roth]]\n}}\n\n'''Forrest Alexander Gump''' is a fictional character and the protagonist of the 1986 [[Forrest Gump (novel)|novel]] by [[Winston Groom]], [[Robert Zemeckis]]'s 1994 [[Forrest Gump|film of the same name]], and ''[[Gump and Co.]]'', the written sequel to Groom's novel.

Forrest finally found Bubba badly wounded and managed to carry him away from the combat area before it was hit with [[napalm]] from an air strike. Sadly, Bubba died of complications from his wounds soon after; his last words were \"I wanna go home.\"\n\nForrest himself was shot in the [[buttocks]] during the firefight and recovered in an army medical center in [[Saigon]]. Lieutenant Dan was in the bed next to his, having lost his legs because of his injuries. Lieutenant Dan later became angry at Forrest for cheating him out of his destiny to die in battle with honor (as several of his ancestors had) and rendering him crippled.\n\n===Washington, D.C.===\nForrest later receives the [[Medal of Honor]] for his bravery in Vietnam. When being awarded, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] asked where he was hit and when Forrest told him, the President whispered in his ear, saying he'd like to see it someday. Forrest promptly lowered his trousers and turned to show him his wound (while on national TV). President Johnson simply smiles and walks away.\n\nShortly thereafter, Forrest went out sightseeing in Washington, D.C. and accidentally found himself among a group of veterans attending an anti-war rally led by [[Abbie Hoffman]]. While making a speech at the rally that was rudely cut off by a policeman, he was reunited with Jenny, who had since become a [[hippie]]. Forrest was less enamored with her new boyfriend Wesley, the president of the [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|SDS]] at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], and beat him up after he saw him hit Jenny during an argument at a [[Black Panther Party]] gathering. Forrest and Jenny stayed up all night while Jenny told Forrest of her travels. Before they went their separate ways again in the morning, Forrest gave Jenny his Medal of Honor, saying \"I got it just by doing what you told me to do,\" since Jenny told him to just run away instead of being brave in combat.\n\n===Ping Pong and New York City===\nIn 1969, Forrest joined the Army Special Services, where he entertained wounded military veterans with his Ping-Pong skills. His exceptional skills earned him a place in the All-American Ping Pong team, with whom he traveled to China during the [[Ping Pong Diplomacy]] period of the early 1970s. Upon his return, Forrest was a national celebrity, \"famous-er even than [[Captain Kangaroo]]\", and was invited to New York City by [[Dick Cavett]] to appear on [[The Dick Cavett Show]], where [[John Lennon]] was also a guest at the time. Hearing Forrest talking about the Chinese having \"no possessions\" and \"no religion\" during his interview with Dick would eventually inspire John Lennon to write the song \"[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]\".\n\nSoon after, Forrest reunites and stays with Lieutenant Dan, his platoon leader from Vietnam and now using a wheelchair, over the winter holidays. Dan has since became an alcoholic who has lost all faith in God, and was dismayed that such an \"imbecile\" like Forrest could earn the Medal of Honor and humiliate himself on national television. During a New Year's Eve celebration in 1971, Forrest persuades Lieutenant Dan to join him in the shrimping business as his first mate, in an effort to fulfill his promise made to Bubba earlier in Vietnam. Dan later invites two prostitutes, Carla and Lenore, to his New Year's Day party, both of whom he eventually kicked out of his apartment for insulting Forrest when Forrest rejected their advances. Forrest apologizes to Dan for ruining his party, to which Dan replied by simply wishing Forrest Happy New Year.\n\nIn June 1972, Forrest was invited with the US Ping Pong team to the White House, where he meets President [[Richard Nixon]], who offers him a room to stay in at Watergate Hotel. That night, Forrest was awakened by a group of people with flashlights breaking into an unlit office. Mistaking it for a power outage, Forrest calls security guard [[Frank Wills (security guard)|Frank Wills]] to inform him about the break-in, inadvertently initiating the [[Watergate Scandal]] and leading to Richard Nixon's resignation in August 1974. In that same year, Forrest was honorably discharged from the Army with the rank of Sergeant.\n\n===Shrimping Boat Captain===\nUpon his return in August 1974, Forrest finds his Greenbow house filled with memorabilia capitalizing on his fame as a ping-pong player in China. At his mother's insistence, Forrest made $25,000 endorsing a brand of ping-pong paddles, and used most of the money to travel to Bubba's hometown of Bayou La Batre and purchase a boat. When someone pointed out it was bad luck to have a boat without a name, Forrest names his boat after Jenny, which he calls, \"The most beautiful name in the whole wide world.\" Unbeknownst to Forrest, Jenny had descended into a life of drugs, burglary and sexual promiscuity at this point, but an event in which she nearly slips and falls off a balcony as she \"contemplates\" suicide while high on drugs in a Los Angeles apartment shakes her to her core.\n\nLater Forrest was visited by Lieutenant Dan who, just as he said he would do on New Year's Eve of 1971, had come to be Forrest's first mate. For several weeks, the two had no luck catching shrimp. However, things changed when the area was hit by [[Hurricane Carmen]]. Forrest's boat was the only one left standing and they found themselves with a monopoly of shrimp. Under the name [[Bubba Gump Shrimp Company]], they soon became very wealthy. Apparently having faced his demons during the storm, Lieutenant Dan thanked Forrest for saving his life in Vietnam, and Forrest assumes that Dan (without actually saying so) made peace with God.\n\n===Home in Alabama===\nForrest returned home to Greenbow in September 1975 when he learned his mother was dying of cancer. After her death, Forrest stays and leaves his shrimping industry in the hands of Lieutenant Dan and retired to mowing and cutting grass and lawns, as he apparently enjoys doing it. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Dan participated in a substantial investment into what Forrest says to be \"some kind of fruit company\". In reality, the company was the fledgling [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]. With the money he got from the Apple Computer investment, Forrest spent them on renovating the church he frequents, establishing a medical center at Bubba's hometown and gave Bubba's family Bubba's share of the investment money that is enough for them to never work again.\n\nJenny returned to Greenbow and moves in with Forrest. The two spent time together catching up, and Forrest later describes it as \"the happiest time of [his] life again\".  One day, they happen to walk past the now abandoned house that had belonged to Jenny's father. She stares transfixed for a moment, and then starts throwing every rock she can find at it, before collapsing in despair, and now Forrest truly understands the ordeal she had been through as a child. Another night, July 4, 1976, Forrest asked Jenny to marry him, but she turns him down, saying \"You don't want to marry me.\" Forrest replies with, \"Why don't you love me Jenny? I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is.\" After this exchange, Jenny comes to Forrest's bedroom, tells him she loves him, and the two make love. Wanting to restart on her own, Jenny hails a cab very early the next morning and leaves before he wakes up.\n\n===Running===\nForrest's new-found loneliness leads him to take a run \"for no particular reason\". At first, he decides to run to the end of the road, then across town, then across the county, then all the way to the Mississippi border. Eventually, he criss-crosses the country several times over a span of three years. Forrest attracts media coverage, and eventually, dozens of followers initiating and inspiring what would become the [[Running boom of the 1970s|jogging craze]] of 1978\u201381. Meanwhile, Jenny has taken a job as a waitress in [[Savannah, Georgia]] and sees news coverage of Forrest's run on television. During the run, he inspires the phrase \"[[Shit happens]]\" to a bumper-sticker salesman after stepping in a pile of dog droppings. He also uses a yellow T-shirt provided to him by a shirt designer to wipe off his face after being splattered by mud from a big rig. In the process, he forms the iconic \"[[Smiley|Smiley face]]\" logo and tells the man \"Have a nice day.\" One day, while running in the [[Western United States]], Forrest suddenly stops; his followers all stop and listen on in anticipation, expecting him to offer words of wisdom, but instead he simply announces that he's tired, then turns around and walks back to Alabama, leaving his followers dumbfounded at his sudden decision.\n\n===Back to the present===\nBack to the present (the \"present\" in the film being 1981, as seen from a car and on a bus, and televised footage of [[Reagan assassination attempt|Ronald Reagan's escape from assassination]]), Forrest tells his latest companion on the bench, an elderly woman, that he had recently received a letter from Jenny asking him to come see her. When told Forrest's destination, the old lady informs him that it is only 5 to 6 blocks away. Thanking her, Forrest sets off on foot towards Jenny's home.\n\nForrest and Jenny are happy to see each other. However, before they can do much catching up, Forrest is introduced to Jenny's young son, a bright young boy whom she named Forrest after him. Forrest at first thinks she met another man named Forrest, until she explains \"You're his daddy, Forrest.\" Forrest's fearful inquiry as to Little Forrest's intelligence leads Jenny to quickly assert that he is completely normal. Forrest learns that Jenny is sick from an unknown virus (implied to be either HIV or Hepatitis C, as both were unknown diseases at that time) which has no known cure. He invites her and Little Forrest to come home and stay with him. She asks him to marry her and he accepts.\n\nForrest and Jenny's wedding is a quiet, intimate ceremony attended only by a handful of family and friends. Among the attendees is Lieutenant Dan, who has titanium prosthetic legs, (claiming to be made of the same material as the Space Shuttle), with his Vietnamese fianc\u00e9e Susan. It is the only time Jenny and Dan meet. Forrest, Jenny and Little Forrest only have a year together as a family before Jenny would die on a Saturday. Before she dies, she asked Forrest what it was like in Vietnam. He responded by saying that it was nice, and when it stopped raining, it would be quiet and peaceful. He also states that while running in Oregon, it looked as if there were two skies and two mountains (since there was a lake in front of the mountain). Forrest also states that while running in the desert, when the sun was rising, it was the most beautiful sight ever.\n\nJenny responds by saying that she wished she was there with him. Forrest smiles and says, \"You were there with me\". Forrest has her buried under the tree where they played as children, then buys her childhood home (where her father had abused her) and has it bulldozed. Though he misses Jenny terribly, Forrest becomes a good father to Little Forrest.\n\nVisiting Jenny's grave one day in 1982, he reflects on the idea of fate and destiny, wondering if his mother was right about people having their own destiny, or if  Lieutenant Dan was right about description of life as floating around accidentally like on a breeze. Forrest eventually decides \"maybe it's both, maybe both are happening at the same time.\" He leaves Jenny a letter from Little Forrest and tells her \"If there's anything you need, I won't be far away.\"\n\nForrest is last seen outside his home, sitting where he and his mother sat waiting for the bus, seeing Little Forrest off on his bus ride to school, telling him that he loves him and that he will be waiting for him.\n\n==Differences from the novel==\n{{original research section|date=July 2015}}\n[[File:Forrest Gump brick.jpg|thumb|Forrest Gump brick in front of the Lucas Theater in Savannah, Georgia, USA]]\nThe portrayal of Forrest in the original novel differs from how he was portrayed in the film. In the novel, Forrest is shown to be somewhat cynical and abrasive, while in the film, he is more placid and na\u00efve. The novel also describes him as being a savant with extraordinary talent in numerical calculation (as shown when he states the exact amount of time in years, months, days and hours that he spent running across the country). Other changes from the novel to the film include the deaths of Forrest's mother and his wife, Jenny, neither of whom died in the book. Whilst the film has him running around the country for over three long years, the novel sends him rocketing into space and later crash-landing in New Guinea and being captured by a tribe of cannibals.\n\nThe novel also provides additional backstory on his father. It is revealed that his father was a [[stevedore|longshoreman]] who worked for [[United Fruit Company]]. He was killed when a crate of bananas being loaded off of a boat fell on top of him, crushing him to death. Forrest goes on a number of different adventures including being an [[astronaut]], playing the harmonica in a band called the Cracked Eggs, becoming a professional wrestler (\"The Dunce\") and running for the [[United States Senate]] (with the campaign slogan \"We Got to Pee\").\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Forrest Gump}}\n{{Forbes Fictional 15}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gump, Forrest}}\n[[Category:Characters in American novels of the 20th century]]\n[[Category:Drama film characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Alabama]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with disability]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with disfigurements]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1986]]\n[[Category:Fictional players of American football]]\n[[Category:Fictional janitors]]\n[[Category:Fictional sea captains]]\n[[Category:Fictional military captains]]\n[[Category:Fictional musicians]]\n[[Category:Fictional fishers]]\n[[Category:Fictional privates]]\n[[Category:Fictional military sergeants]]\n[[Category:Fictional Vietnam War veterans]]\n[[Category:Fictional victims of bullies]]\n[[Category:Fictional Medal of Honor recipients]]\n[[Category:Fictional runners]]\n[[Category:Fictional professional wrestlers]]\n[[Category:Fictional table tennis players]]\n[[Category:Fictional United States Army personnel]]\n[[Category:Male characters in film]]\n[[Category:Male characters in literature]]\n[[Category:Military humor]]\n", "name_user": "109.205.217.16", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHome in Alabama)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrest_Gump_(character)"}

Cultural archetypes are the unknowable basic forms personified or made concrete by recurring [[image]]s, [[symbol]]s, or [[pattern]]s (which may include motifs such as the \"[[quest]]\" or the \"[[Ascent to Heaven|heavenly ascent]]\"; recognizable character types such as the \"[[trickster]]\", \"[[saint]]\", \"[[martyr]]\" or the \"[[hero]]\"; symbols such as the apple or the snake; and imagery) and that have all been laden with meaning prior to their inclusion in any particular work.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe archetypes reveal shared roles among universal societies, such as the role of the mother in her natural relations with all members of the family. This archetype may create a shared imagery which is defined by many stereotypes that have not separated themselves from the traditional, biological, religious and mythical framework.<ref>\nSbaihat, Ahlam (2012).

He was considered the [[heir presumptive]] to his cousin [[King Richard II]].\n\nRoger Mortimer's father, the [[Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March|3rd Earl of March]], died in 1381, leaving the six-year-old Roger to succeed to his father's title. Roger was placed under the wardship of [[Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent]] and eventually married Holland's daughter [[Alianore Holland, Countess of March|Alianore]]. During his lifetime, Mortimer spent much time in [[Ireland]]; he served several tenures as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] and died during a battle at Kellistown, [[County Carlow|Co. Carlow.]] He was succeeded by his young son, [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March]].\n\n==Early life==\nRoger Mortimer was born 11 April 1374 at [[Usk]] in [[Monmouthshire]].<ref name=\"Richardson III 2011 195\">{{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=195}}.</ref> He was the eldest son of [[Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March]], by his wife [[Philippa, 5th Countess of Ulster|Philippa of Clarence]], who was the daughter of [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence]], and granddaughter of [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]]. Philippa passed on a strong claim to the English crown to her children. Roger had a younger brother, [[Edmund Mortimer, son of the 3rd Earl|Edmund Mortimer]], and two sisters, [[Elizabeth Mortimer|Elizabeth]], who married [[Henry Percy (Hotspur)|Henry 'Hotspur' Percy]], and Philippa, who first married [[John Hastings, 3rd Earl of Pembroke]], secondly [[Richard Fitzalan, 11th Earl of Arundel|Richard de Arundel, 11th Earl of Arundel]], and thirdly Sir Thomas Poynings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1932|p=448}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson II|2011|pp=190\u20131}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|pp=193\u20135, 307, 335, 341}}; {{Harvnb|Holmes|2004}}; {{Harvnb|Tout|Davies|2004}}.</ref>\n\n===Wardship===\nAccording to R. R. Davies, the wardship of such an important heir was an \"issue of political moment in the years 1382\u20134\". Eventually, on 16 December 1383, Mortimer's estates in England and Wales were granted for \u00a34000 per annum to a consortium consisting of Mortimer himself, the Earls of [[Richard Fitzalan, 11th Earl of Arundel|Arundel]], [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland|Northumberland]], and [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick|Warwick]], and [[John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby|John, Lord Neville]]. The guardianship of Mortimer's person was initially granted to Arundel, but at the behest of King Richard's mother [[Joan of Kent]], Mortimer's wardship and marriage were granted, for 6000 marks,<ref>{{Harvnb|Pugh|1988|p=171}}.</ref> to Joan's son (and Richard's half-brother) [[Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent]], in August 1384. On or about 7 October 1388,<ref name=\"Richardson III 2011 195\"/> Mortimer married the Earl of Kent's daughter [[Alianore Holland, Countess of March|Eleanor Holland]], who was Richard's half-niece.<ref name=\"Davies\">{{Harvnb|Davies|2004}}.</ref> Mortimer did [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and was granted livery of his lands in Ireland on 18 June 1393, and of those in England and Wales on 25 February 1394.<ref name=\"Cokayne 1932 449\">{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1932|p=449}}.</ref>\n\nKing Richard had no issue, thus Mortimer, a lineal descendant of Edward III, was next in line to the throne and married to his half-niece. G. E. Cokayne states that in October 1385 Mortimer was proclaimed by the king as heir presumptive to the crown.<ref name=\"Cokayne 1932 448\">{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1932|p=448}}</ref> However, according to R. R. Davies, the story that Richard publicly proclaimed Mortimer as heir presumptive in Parliament in October 1385 is baseless, although contemporary records indicate that his claim was openly discussed at the time.<ref name=\"Davies\" /> He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]] on 23 April 1390.<ref name=\"Cokayne 1932 448\"/>\n\n==Career==\nAfter he came of age, Mortimer spent much of his time in Ireland. King Richard had first made Mortimer his [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] on 24 January 1382 when he was a child of seven, with his uncle, Sir Thomas Mortimer,<ref>{{Harvnb|Richardson I|2011|pp=103\u20134}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|pp=192\u20133}}.</ref> acting as his deputy.<ref>According to Davies, Sir Thomas Mortimer was illegitimate; however Richardson includes him among the three legitimate sons of Roger Mortimer's grandfather, Roger de Mortimer (1328\u20131360).</ref>{{sfn|McNeill|1911|p=687}} The king reappointed Roger Mortimer as his lieutenant in Ireland on 23 July 1392, and in September 1394,<ref>Davies dates the expedition to the summer of 1394.</ref> Although he was nominally the king's lieutenant, he made little headway against the native Irish chieftains.{{sfn|McNeill|1911|p=687}} On 25 April 1396,<ref>Davies dates the appointment to 28 April 1396.</ref> the king appointed him lieutenant in [[Ulster]], [[Connacht]], and [[County Meath|Meath]], and Mortimer was in Ireland for most of the following three years. In April 1397, the king reappointed him lieutenant for a further three years.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1932|p=449}}; {{Harvnb|Davies|2004}}.</ref>\n\nMortimer's residence in Ireland ensured that his political role in England was a minor one. His closest relationships in England appear to have been with family members, including his brother, [[Edmund Mortimer, son of the 3rd Earl|Edmund]], to whom he granted lands and annuities; the Percy family, into which his elder sister, [[Lady Elizabeth Percy|Elizabeth]] had married; and the [[Richard Fitzalan, 11th Earl of Arundel|Earl of Arundel]], who had married his younger sister, Philippa.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nAs Davies points out, Mortimer's \"wealth and lineage meant that, sooner or later, he would be caught up in the political turmoil of Richard II's last years.\" On 4 September 1397, he was ordered to arrest his uncle, Sir [[Thomas Mortimer]] for treason regarding his actions at the [[Battle of Radcot Bridge]], but made no real attempt to do so. Even more inauspiciously, when summoned to a Parliament at [[Shrewsbury]] in January 1398, he was 'rapturously received', according to [[Adam Usk]] and the Wigmore chronicler, by a vast crowd of supporters wearing his colours. These events excited the king's suspicions, and on Mortimer's return to Ireland after the Parliament in January 1398, 'his enemy, [[Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey|the Duke of Surrey]], his brother-in-law, was ordered to follow and capture him'.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Remains_of_Wigmore_Abbey_-_geograph.org.uk_-_700446.jpg|thumb|200px|Remains of [[Wigmore Abbey]], burial place of the Earls of March]]\n\nOn 20 July 1398, at the age of 24, Mortimer was slain in a skirmish at either Kells, [[County Meath]], or Kellistown, [[County Carlow]].<!-- disputed --> The Wigmore chronicler says that he was riding in front of his army, unattended and wearing Irish garb, possibly illegally,{{sfn|McNeill|1911|p=687}} and that those who slew him did not know who he was.

The Wigmore chronicler, while criticising Mortimer for lust and remissness in his duty to God, extols him as 'of approved honesty, active in knightly exercises, glorious in pleasantry, affable and merry in conversation, excelling his contemporaries in beauty of appearance, sumptuous in his feasting, and liberal in his gifts'.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1932|pp=449\u201350}}.</ref>\n\n==Marriage and children==\nBy his wife [[Alianore Holland]] he had two sons and two daughters:<ref>{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1932|p=450}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=195}}</ref>\n\n*[[Anne de Mortimer|Anne]], who married [[Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge|Richard, Earl of Cambridge]] (born 1390{{snd}}executed 1415)\n*[[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March]] (1391\u20131425)\n*Roger (23 April 1393{{snd}}c. 1413)<ref>{{Harvnb|Pugh|1988|p=61}}; Although some sources state that Roger died c. 1409, Pugh states that he was made a Knight of the Bath by Henry V on the eve of his coronation on 9 April 1413.</ref>\n*Eleanor (born 1395-1422), who married [[Sir Edward de Courtenay]] (died 1418), and had no issue.

He was considered the [[heir presumptive]] to his cousin [[King Richard II]].\n\nRoger Mortimer's father, the [[Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March|3rd Earl of March]], died in 1381, leaving the six-year-old Roger to succeed to his father's title. Roger was placed under the wardship of [[Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent]] and eventually married Holland's daughter [[Alianore Holland, Countess of March|Alianore]]. During his lifetime, Mortimer spent much time in [[Ireland]]; he served several tenures as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] and died during a battle at Kellistown, [[County Carlow|Co. Carlow.]] He was succeeded by his young son, [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March]].\n\n==Early life==\nRoger Mortimer was born 11 April 1374 at [[Usk]] in [[Monmouthshire]].<ref name=\"Richardson III 2011 195\">{{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=195}}.</ref> He was the eldest son of [[Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March]], by his wife [[Philippa, 5th Countess of Ulster|Philippa of Clarence]], who was the daughter of [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence]], and granddaughter of [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]]. Philippa passed on a strong claim to the English crown to her children. Roger had a younger brother, [[Edmund Mortimer, son of the 3rd Earl|Edmund Mortimer]], and two sisters, [[Elizabeth Mortimer|Elizabeth]], who married [[Henry Percy (Hotspur)|Henry 'Hotspur' Percy]], and Philippa, who first married [[John Hastings, 3rd Earl of Pembroke]], secondly [[Richard Fitzalan, 11th Earl of Arundel|Richard de Arundel, 11th Earl of Arundel]], and thirdly Sir Thomas Poynings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1932|p=448}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson II|2011|pp=190\u20131}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|pp=193\u20135, 307, 335, 341}}; {{Harvnb|Holmes|2004}}; {{Harvnb|Tout|Davies|2004}}.</ref>\n\n===Wardship===\nAccording to R. R. Davies, the wardship of such an important heir was an \"issue of political moment in the years 1382\u20134\". Eventually, on 16 December 1383, Mortimer's estates in England and Wales were granted for \u00a34000 per annum to a consortium consisting of Mortimer himself, the Earls of [[Richard Fitzalan, 11th Earl of Arundel|Arundel]], [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland|Northumberland]], and [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick|Warwick]], and [[John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby|John, Lord Neville]]. The guardianship of Mortimer's person was initially granted to Arundel, but at the behest of King Richard's mother [[Joan of Kent]], Mortimer's wardship and marriage were granted, for 6000 marks,<ref>{{Harvnb|Pugh|1988|p=171}}.</ref> to Joan's son (and Richard's half-brother) [[Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent]], in August 1384. On or about 7 October 1388,<ref name=\"Richardson III 2011 195\"/> Mortimer married the Earl of Kent's daughter [[Alianore Holland, Countess of March|Eleanor Holland]], who was Richard's half-niece.<ref name=\"Davies\">{{Harvnb|Davies|2004}}.</ref> Mortimer did [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and was granted livery of his lands in Ireland on 18 June 1393, and of those in England and Wales on 25 February 1394.<ref name=\"Cokayne 1932 449\">{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1932|p=449}}.</ref>\n\nKing Richard had no issue, thus Mortimer, a lineal descendant of Edward III, was next in line to the throne and married to his half-niece. G. E. Cokayne states that in October 1385 Mortimer was proclaimed by the king as heir presumptive to the crown.<ref name=\"Cokayne 1932 448\">{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1932|p=448}}</ref> However, according to R. R. Davies, the story that Richard publicly proclaimed Mortimer as heir presumptive in Parliament in October 1385 is baseless, although contemporary records indicate that his claim was openly discussed at the time.<ref name=\"Davies\" /> He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]] on 23 April 1390.<ref name=\"Cokayne 1932 448\"/>\n\n==Career==\nAfter he came of age, Mortimer spent much of his time in Ireland. King Richard had first made Mortimer his [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] on 24 January 1382 when he was a child of seven, with his uncle, Sir Thomas Mortimer,<ref>{{Harvnb|Richardson I|2011|pp=103\u20134}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|pp=192\u20133}}.</ref> acting as his deputy.<ref>According to Davies, Sir Thomas Mortimer was illegitimate; however Richardson includes him among the three legitimate sons of Roger Mortimer's grandfather, Roger de Mortimer (1328\u20131360).</ref>{{sfn|McNeill|1911|p=687}} The king reappointed Roger Mortimer as his lieutenant in Ireland on 23 July 1392, and in September 1394,<ref>Davies dates the expedition to the summer of 1394.</ref> Although he was nominally the king's lieutenant, he made little headway against the native Irish chieftains.{{sfn|McNeill|1911|p=687}} On 25 April 1396,<ref>Davies dates the appointment to 28 April 1396.</ref> the king appointed him lieutenant in [[Ulster]], [[Connacht]], and [[County Meath|Meath]], and Mortimer was in Ireland for most of the following three years. In April 1397, the king reappointed him lieutenant for a further three years.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1932|p=449}}; {{Harvnb|Davies|2004}}.</ref>\n\nMortimer's residence in Ireland ensured that his political role in England was a minor one. His closest relationships in England appear to have been with family members, including his brother, [[Edmund Mortimer, son of the 3rd Earl|Edmund]], to whom he granted lands and annuities; the Percy family, into which his elder sister, [[Lady Elizabeth Percy|Elizabeth]] had married; and the [[Richard Fitzalan, 11th Earl of Arundel|Earl of Arundel]], who had married his younger sister, Philippa.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nAs Davies points out, Mortimer's \"wealth and lineage meant that, sooner or later, he would be caught up in the political turmoil of Richard II's last years.\" On 4 September 1397, he was ordered to arrest his uncle, Sir [[Thomas Mortimer]] for treason regarding his actions at the [[Battle of Radcot Bridge]], but made no real attempt to do so. Even more inauspiciously, when summoned to a Parliament at [[Shrewsbury]] in January 1398, he was 'rapturously received', according to [[Adam Usk]] and the Wigmore chronicler, by a vast crowd of supporters wearing his colours. These events excited the king's suspicions, and on Mortimer's return to Ireland after the Parliament in January 1398, 'his enemy, [[Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey|the Duke of Surrey]], his brother-in-law, was ordered to follow and capture him'.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Remains_of_Wigmore_Abbey_-_geograph.org.uk_-_700446.jpg|thumb|200px|Remains of [[Wigmore Abbey]], burial place of the Earls of March]]\n\nOn 20 July 1398, at the age of 24, Mortimer was slain in a skirmish at either Kells, [[County Meath]] or Kellistown, [[County Carlow]].<!-- disputed --> The Wigmore chronicler says that he was riding in front of his army, unattended and wearing Irish garb, possibly illegally,{{sfn|McNeill|1911|p=687}} and that those who slew him did not know who he was.

The Wigmore chronicler, while criticising Mortimer for lust and remissness in his duty to God, extols him as 'of approved honesty, active in knightly exercises, glorious in pleasantry, affable and merry in conversation, excelling his contemporaries in beauty of appearance, sumptuous in his feasting, and liberal in his gifts'.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1932|pp=449\u201350}}.</ref>\n\n==Marriage and children==\nBy his wife [[Alianore Holland]] he had two sons and two daughters:<ref>{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1932|p=450}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=195}}</ref>\n\n*[[Anne de Mortimer|Anne]], who married [[Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge|Richard, Earl of Cambridge]] (born 1390{{snd}}executed 1415)\n*[[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March]] (1391\u20131425)\n*Roger (23 April 1393{{snd}}c. 1413)<ref>{{Harvnb|Pugh|1988|p=61}}; Although some sources state that Roger died c. 1409, Pugh states that he was made a Knight of the Bath by Henry V on the eve of his coronation on 9 April 1413.</ref>\n*Eleanor (born 1395-1422), who married [[Sir Edward de Courtenay]] (died 1418), and had no issue.
