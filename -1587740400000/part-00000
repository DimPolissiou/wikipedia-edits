It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on April 18, 1999. The episode follows [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] after he tries to make amends for his son, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]'s, first birthday party when he loses their reservation at a popular kids' restaurant known as Cheesie Charlie's. Meanwhile, [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] becomes friends with an excitable girl named Jennifer, who leads her to join a [[Destructive cult|death cult]], in an attempt to fit in.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]] and directed by [[Dominic Polcino]], both firsts in the ''Family Guy'' series. It was rated TV-14. The episode featured guest performances by [[Butch Hartman]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Rachael MacFarlane]] and [[John O'Hurley]], along with several recurring voice actors for the series. Much of the episode features a [[cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway]] style of humor that is typically used in ''Family Guy'', many of which feature cultural references including the [[The Incredible Hulk|Incredible Hulk]], [[The Dukes of Hazzard]], ''[[Three Little Pigs]]'', and ''Couplehood''.\n\nThe title \"Chitty Chitty Death Bang\" is a variation on that of the 1968 musical film, [[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]].\n\n==Plot==\nLois has booked Cheesie Charlie's for Stewie's upcoming first birthday party and sends Peter, along with Chris, to drop off the deposit check at the restaurant. However, once they arrive, they seek the opportunity to play with all the machines, causing Peter to lose his watch in a [[Claw crane|claw machine]]. A little boy wins his watch, which causes Peter to become angry and tries to force the watch off the child. Five minutes later, the manager sees this and asks Peter to leave. But once Peter shows the deposit check, he immediately apologizes and exclaims how they are very excited to host Stewie's birthday party. Peter, angered by how he was treated, states that they will not be celebrating Stewie's party there, which causes a crowd of people to circle around the manager shouting for the reservation. Peter, realizing what he has just done, immediately returns home with a poorly crafted lie in an attempt to evade Lois' aggravation which involves him saying that they are [[Nazism|Nazis]] who torture, kill and kidnap people. He pretends that he is already planned an extravagant party at home so that Lois does not have do any work.\n\nMeanwhile, Stewie misinterprets the meaning of his birthday and assumes that the same mysterious \"Man in White\" who delivered him as an infant will be returning to force Stewie back into Lois' [[Uterus|womb]] from which he escaped just one year ago. Meg cries all the way home to Peter from [[cheerleading]] practice, and has been having trouble fitting in at school. Later, she discovers a new friend named Jennifer. Meanwhile, Stewie makes it all the way to the [[airport]] looking for tickets but then is stopped by a member of staff. The man then gives Stewie some advice saying that running from your problems never solves anything. Stewie then reflects on this, deciding to finally face \"The Man in White\". But before he leaves, he wishes the man luck before freezing him in carbonite.\nPeter tries desperately, but ultimately unsuccessfully, to put together a party in time for Stewie's birthday. He finally reroutes a [[circus]] into the Griffins' backyard, saving the day - that is, until he reveals to Lois that he gave Meg permission to go to a party at her friend's house. Lois, who wanted the whole family together for Stewie's party, is upset with Peter for letting Meg go. What Peter and Lois do not realize is that Meg's \"party\" is actually a [[Cult|cult meeting]] where all the members are about to commit [[Mass suicide|group suicide.]]\n\nPeter goes to retrieve Meg from her \"party\" and asks Meg to come as Lois wants her there. Meg just says it is just a birthday party and asks who would remember if she was not there. Peter says that Lois would as she remembers everything and that her best memories are of when Meg and her brothers were born. He then has an epiphany: having the entire family at the party is more for Lois than Stewie. Realizing how terrible she has been, Meg agrees to come home and the cult members agree as well. Peter makes a toast, then looks at his watch before he can drink the poisoned punch and pulls Meg out before she can drink hers, oblivious to the fact that he is saving her life in the process while the cult members all die. The cult leader chases after them while wearing his ceremonial white robe and is mistaken by Stewie as \"The Man in White.\" Stewie does away with him and, feeling victorious, joins the others to enjoy his party.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Rachael MacFarlane crop.jpg|thumb|140px|left|This was the first episode to include show creator [[Seth MacFarlane]]'s sister [[Rachael MacFarlane]] as a guest voice actress.]]\n\n\"Chitty Chitty Death Bang\" was written by [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]] and directed by [[Dominic Polcino]], both their first episodes in the ''Family Guy'' series.

It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on April 18, 1999. The episode follows [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] after he tries to make amends for his son, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]'s, first birthday party when he loses their reservation at a popular kids' restaurant known as Cheesie Charlie's. Meanwhile, [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] becomes friends with an excitable girl named Jennifer, who leads her to join a [[Destructive cult|death cult]], in an attempt to fit in.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]] and directed by [[Dominic Polcino]], both firsts in the ''Family Guy'' series. It was rated TV-14. The episode featured guest performances by [[Butch Hartman]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Rachael MacFarlane]] and [[John O'Hurley]], along with several recurring voice actors for the series. Much of the episode features a [[cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway]] style of humor that is typically used in ''Family Guy'', many of which feature cultural references including the [[The Incredible Hulk|Incredible Hulk]], [[The Dukes of Hazzard]], ''[[Three Little Pigs]]'', and ''Couplehood''.\n\nThe title \"Chitty Chitty Death Bang\" is a variation on that of the 1968 musical film, [[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]].\n\n==Plot==\nLois has booked Cheesie Charlie's for Stewie's upcoming first birthday party and sends Peter, along with Chris, to drop off the deposit check at the restaurant. However, once they arrive, they seek the opportunity to play with all the machines, causing Peter to lose his watch in a [[Claw crane|claw machine]]. A little boy wins his watch, which causes Peter to become angry and tries to force the watch off the child. Five minutes later, the manager sees this and asks Peter to leave. But once Peter shows the deposit check, he immediately apologizes and exclaims how they are very excited to host Stewie's birthday party. Peter, angered by how he was treated, states that they will not be celebrating Stewie's party there, which causes a crowd of people to circle around the manager shouting for the reservation. Peter, realizing what he has just done, immediately returns home with a poorly crafted lie in an attempt to evade Lois' aggravation which involves him saying that they are [[Nazism|Nazis]] who torture, kill and kidnap people. He pretends that he is already planned an extravagant party at home so that Lois does not have do any work.\n\nMeanwhile, Stewie misinterprets the meaning of his birthday and assumes that the same mysterious \"Man in White\" who delivered him as an infant will be returning to force Stewie back into Lois' [[Uterus|womb]] from which he escaped just one year ago. Meg cries all the way home to Peter from [[cheerleading]] practice, and has been having trouble fitting in at school. Later, she discovers a new friend named Jennifer. Meanwhile, Stewie makes it all the way to the [[airport]] looking for tickets but then is stopped by a member of staff. The man then gives Stewie some advice saying that running from your problems never solves anything. Stewie then reflects on this, deciding to finally face \"The Man in White\". But before he leaves, he wishes the man luck before freezing him in carbonite.\nPeter tries desperately, but ultimately unsuccessfully, to put together a party in time for Stewie's birthday. He finally reroutes a [[circus]] into the Griffins' backyard, saving the day - that is, until he reveals to Lois that he gave Meg permission to go to a party at her friend's house. Lois, who wanted the whole family together for Stewie's party, is upset with Peter for letting Meg go. What Peter and Lois do not realize is that Meg's \"party\" is actually a [[Cult|cult meeting]] where all the members are about to commit [[Mass suicide|group suicide.]]\n\nPeter goes to retrieve Meg from her \"party\" and asks Meg to come as Lois wants her there. Meg just says it is just a birthday party and asks who would remember if she was not there. Peter says that Lois would as she remembers everything and that her best memories are of when Meg and her brothers were born. He then has an epiphany: having the entire family at the party is more for Lois than Stewie. Realizing how terrible she has been, Meg agrees to come home and the cult members agree as well. Peter makes a toast, then looks at his watch before he can drink the poisoned punch and pulls Meg out before she can drink hers, oblivious to the fact that he is saving her life in the process while the cult members all die. The cult leader chases after them while wearing his ceremonial white robe and is mistaken by Stewie as \"The Man in White.\" Stewie does away with him and, feeling victorious, joins the others to enjoy his party.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Rachael MacFarlane crop.jpg|thumb|140px|left|This was the first episode to include show creator [[Seth MacFarlane]]'s sister [[Rachael MacFarlane]] as a guest voice actress.]]\n\n\"Chitty Chitty Death Bang\" was written by [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]] and directed by [[Dominic Polcino]], both their first episodes in the ''Family Guy'' series.

The Raiders will play their home games at [[Allegiant Stadium]] in [[Paradise, Nevada]], in 2020.\n\nFounded on January 30, 1960, and originally based in [[Oakland, California]], they played their first regular season game on September 11, 1960, as a charter member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL). They moved to the NFL with the [[AFL-NFL merger]] in 1970. The team departed Oakland to play in [[Los Angeles]] from the [[1982 Los Angeles Raiders season|1982 season]] through the [[1994 Los Angeles Raiders season|1994 season]] before returning to Oakland at the start of the [[1995 Oakland Raiders season|1995 season]]. On March 27, 2017, NFL team owners voted nearly unanimously to approve the Raiders' application to [[Oakland Raiders relocation to Las Vegas|relocate]] to Las Vegas.

The team's first three years of operation ([[1960 Oakland Raiders season|1960]]\u2013[[1962 Oakland Raiders season|1962]]) were marred by poor on-field performance, financial difficulties, and spotty attendance. In [[1963 Oakland Raiders season|1963]], however, the Raiders' fortunes improved dramatically with the introduction of head coach (and eventual owner) [[Al Davis]]. In [[1967 Oakland Raiders season|1967]], after several years of improvement, the Raiders reached the postseason for the first time. The team would go on to win its first (and only) [[1967 American Football League Championship Game|AFL Championship]] that year; in doing so, the Raiders advanced to [[Super Bowl II]], where they were soundly defeated by the [[Green Bay Packers]]. Since 1963, the team has won 15 division titles (3 AFL and 12 NFL), 4 AFC Championships ([[1976\u201377 NFL playoffs|1976]], [[1980\u201381 NFL playoffs|1980]], [[1983\u201384 NFL playoffs|1983]], and [[2002\u201303 NFL playoffs|2002]]), 1 AFL Championship ([[1967 American Football League Championship Game|1967]]), and 3 Super Bowl Championships ([[Super Bowl XI|XI]], [[Super Bowl XV|XV]], and [[Super Bowl XVIII|XVIII]]). At the end of the NFL's [[2019 NFL season|2019 season]], the Raiders have an all-time regular season record of 473 wins, 432 losses, and 11 ties; their all-time playoff record currently stands at 25 wins and 19 losses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rai/|title=Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders Team Encyclopedia {{!}} Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=July 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAl Davis owned the team from 1972 until his death in 2011. Control of the franchise was then given to Al's son [[Mark Davis (American football)|Mark Davis]]. The Raiders are known for their [[Raider Nation|extensive fan base]] and distinctive team culture. The Raiders have 14 former members who have been enshrined in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]. They have previously played at [[Kezar Stadium]] and [[Candlestick Park]] in San Francisco, [[Frank Youell Field]] and [[Oakland Coliseum]] in Oakland, and the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] in Los Angeles.\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{See also|History of the Oakland Raiders|History of the Los Angeles Raiders}}\n===First Oakland era (1960\u20131981)===\n{{NFL Raiders history}}\nThe Oakland Raiders were originally going to be called the \"Oakland Se\u00f1ors\"<ref>\"Grid Team Named-- They're Senors\", ''Oakland Tribune'', April 5, 1960, p37. Soda said, \"My own personal choice would have been Mavericks, but I believe we came up with a real fine name.\" The selection committee narrowed the choices down to Admirals, Lakers, Diablos, Seawolves, Gauchos, Nuggets, Se\u00f1ors, Dons, Costers, Grandees, Sequoias, Missiles, Knights, Redwoods, Clippers, Jets and Dolphins.</ref> after a name-the-team contest had that name finish first, but after being the target of local jokes, the name was changed to the Raiders before the 1960 season began. Having enjoyed a successful collegiate coaching career at [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]] during the 1950s, San Francisco native [[Eddie Erdelatz]] was hired as the Raiders' first head coach. On February 9, 1960, after rejecting offers from the NFL's [[Washington Redskins]] and the AFL's [[Los Angeles Chargers]], Erdelatz accepted the Raiders' head coaching position. In January 1960, the Raiders were established in Oakland, and because of NFL interference with the original eighth franchise owner, were the last team of eight in the new [[American Football League]] to select players, thus relegated to the remaining talent available (see below).\n\nThe [[1960 Oakland Raiders season|1960 Raiders]] 42-man roster included 28 rookies and only 14 veterans. Among the Raiders rookies were future Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee center [[Jim Otto]], and a future Raiders head coach, quarterback [[Tom Flores]]. In their debut year under Erdelatz the [[1960 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] finished with a 6\u20138 record.\n\nOn September 18, 1961, Erdelatz was dismissed after the Raiders were outscored 77\u201346 in the first two games of the season. On September 24, 1961, after the dismissal of Erdelatz, management named Los Angeles native and offensive line coach [[Marty Feldman (American football coach)|Marty Feldman]] as the Raiders head coach. The team finished the 1961 season with a 2\u201312 record.\n\nFeldman began the [[1962 Oakland Raiders season|1962 season]] as Raiders head coach but was fired on October 16, 1962 after an 0\u20135 start. From October 16 through December, the Raiders were coached by Oklahoma native and former assistant coach [[Red Conkright]]. Under Conkright, the Raiders went 1\u20138, finishing the season with 1\u201313 record. Following the 1962 season the Raiders appointed Conkright to an interim mentor position as they looked for a new head coach.\n\n====Al Davis====\nAfter the 1962 season, Raiders managing general partner [[F. Wayne Valley]] hired Al Davis as Raiders head coach and general manager. At 33, he was the youngest person in professional football history to hold the positions.<ref name=\"youngest\">{{cite web |url=http://www.raiders.com/history/gm11.jsp |title=Raiders Stun Chargers with 33-Point 4th Quarter Outburst |accessdate=February 4, 2007 |work=Raiders.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230172729/http://www.raiders.com/history/gm11.jsp |archivedate=December 30, 2006}}</ref> Davis immediately began to implement what he termed the \"vertical game\", an aggressive offensive strategy inspired by the offense developed by Chargers head coach [[Sid Gillman]].<ref name=\"gillman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chargers.com/news/headlines/news-104158080019831.htm |title=Memories of Sid Gillman |accessdate=February 1, 2007 |work=Chargers.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090813/http://www.chargers.com/news/headlines/news-104158080019831.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2007}}</ref> Under Davis the [[1963 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] improved to 10\u20134 and he was named the AFL's Coach of the Year in 1963. Though the team slipped to 5\u20137\u20132 in [[1964 Oakland Raiders season|1964]], they rebounded to an 8\u20135\u20131 record in [[1965 Oakland Raiders season|1965]]. The famous silver and black Raider uniform debuted at the regular season opening game on September 8, 1963. Prior to this, the team wore a combination of black and white with gold trim on the pants and oversized numerals.\n\n====Davis's departure and return====\nIn April 1966 Davis left the Raiders after being named AFL Commissioner, promoting assistant coach [[John Rauch]] to head coach. Two months later, the league announced its [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger with the NFL]]. The leagues would retain separate regular seasons until [[1970 NFL season|1970]]. With the merger, the position of commissioner was no longer needed, and Davis entered into discussions with Valley about returning to the Raiders. On July 25, 1966, Davis returned as part-owner of the team. He purchased a 10% interest in the team for $18,000, and became the team's third general partner \u2013 the partner in charge of football operations.<ref name=\"burke\">{{cite magazine |last=Burke |first=Monte |title=A New Test For an Old Raider |magazine=Forbes Magazine |date =September 18, 2006 |url=https://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2006/0918/112.html |accessdate=January 25, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"Dickey, Just Win, Baby, p. 41\">Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', p. 41.</ref>\n\nUnder Rauch, the Raiders matched their 1965 season's 8\u20135\u20131 record in [[1966 Oakland Raiders season|1966]] but missed the playoffs, finishing second in the AFL West Division.\n\n====First Super Bowl appearance: 1967 ====\nOn the field, the team Davis had assembled steadily improved. Led by quarterback [[Daryle Lamonica]], acquired in a trade with the [[Buffalo Bills]], the Raiders finished the [[1967 Oakland Raiders season|1967 season]] with a 13\u20131 record and won the [[1967 American Football League Championship Game|1967 AFL Championship]], defeating the [[1967 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] 40\u20137. The win earned the team a trip to the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] in Miami, Florida to participate in [[Super Bowl II]]. On January 14, 1968, the Raiders were defeated in the second-ever Super Bowl, losing 33\u201314 to [[Vince Lombardi]]'s [[1967 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]].\n\nThe following year, the [[1968 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] ended the [[1968 AFL season|1968 season]] with a 12\u20132 record and again winning the AFL West Division title. However, this time, they lost 27\u201323 by the [[1968 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] in the [[1968 American Football League Championship Game|AFL Championship Game]].\n\nCiting management conflicts with day-to-day coaching decisions, Rauch resigned as Raiders head coach on January 16, 1969, accepting the head coaching job of the Buffalo Bills.\n\n====John Madden====\nDuring the early 1960s, [[John Madden]] was a defensive assistant coach at [[San Diego State University]] under SDSU head coach [[Don Coryell]]. Madden credited Coryell as being an influence on his coaching. In 1967, Madden was hired by Al Davis as the Raiders linebacker coach. On February 4, 1969, after the departure of John Rauch, Madden was named the Raiders sixth head coach. Under Madden, the [[1969 Oakland Raiders season|1969 Raiders]] won the AFL West Division title for the third consecutive year with a 12\u20131\u20131 record. On December 20, 1969, the Raiders defeated the [[1969 Houston Oilers season|Oilers]] 56\u20137 in the AFL Division playoff game. In the [[1969 American Football League Championship Game|AFL Championship game]] on January 4, 1970, the Raiders were defeated by [[Hank Stram]]'s [[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] 17\u20137.\n\nIn 1970, the AFL\u2013NFL merger was officially completed after four years and the Raiders joined the Western Division of the [[American Football Conference]] (actually the AFL West with the same teams as in 1969, except for the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]) in the newly-merged NFL. The first [[1970 Oakland Raiders season|post-merger season]] saw the Raiders win the AFC West with an 8\u20134\u20132 record and advance to the [[1970 AFC Championship Game|conference championship]], where they lost to the [[1970 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]]. Despite another 8\u20134\u20132 season in [[1971 NFL season|1971]], it was only good for second place in the AFC West, and the team failed to make the playoffs. When backup offensive lineman [[Ron Mix]] played, the 1971 Raiders had an eventual all-Pro Football Hall of Fame offensive line with tackle [[Art Shell]], guard [[Gene Upshaw]], center Jim Otto, and tackle [[Bob Brown (offensive lineman)|Bob Brown]].\n\n[[File:John Madden in 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[John Madden]] was the head coach of the Raiders for 10 seasons. Madden's overall winning percentage including playoff games ranks second in league history. He won a Super Bowl and never had a losing season as a head coach.]]\nThe teams of the 1970s were thoroughly dominant teams, with eight Hall of Fame inductees on the roster and a Hall of Fame coach in John Madden. The 1970s Raiders created the team's identity and persona as a team that was hard-hitting. Dominant on defense, with the crushing hits of safeties [[Jack Tatum]] and [[George Atkinson (safety)|George Atkinson]] and cornerback [[Skip Thomas]], the Raiders regularly held first place in the AFC West, entering the playoffs nearly every season. From 1973 through 1977, the Raiders reached the conference championship every year.\n\nThis was also the era of a bitter rivalry between the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and Raiders. In the 1970s, the Steelers and Raiders were frequently the two best teams in the AFC and, arguably, the NFL. The teams would meet on five different occasions in the playoffs, and the winner of the Steelers-Raiders game went on to win the Super Bowl in three of those instances, from 1974 to 1976. The rivalry garnered attention in the sports media, with controversial plays, late hits, accusations and public statements.\n\nThe rivalry began with and was fueled by a controversial last-second play in their first playoff game in [[1972 NFL season|1972]]. That season the [[1972 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] achieved a 10\u20133\u20131 record and an AFC West title. In the divisional round, the Raiders would lose to the [[1972 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] 13\u20137 on the controversial play that become known as the \"[[Immaculate Reception]]\".\n\nThe [[1973 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] and [[1973 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] would meet again the [[1973 NFL season|following season]] as the Raiders won the AFC West again with a 9\u20134\u20131 record. Lamonica was replaced as starting quarterback early in the season by [[Ken Stabler]]. The Raiders defeated Pittsburgh 33\u201314 in the divisional round of the playoffs to reach the AFC Championship, but lost 27\u201310 to the [[1973 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]].\n\nIn [[1974 NFL season|1974]] [[1974 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] had a 12\u20132 regular season, which included a nine-game winning streak. They beat the [[1974 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]] 28\u201326 in the divisional round of the playoffs in a see-saw battle remembered as the \"Sea of Hands\" game.<ref>National Football League lore</ref> They then lost the AFC Championship to the [[1974 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]], who went on to win the Super Bowl. The Raiders were held to only 29 yards rushing by the Pittsburgh defense, and late mistakes turned a 10\u20133 lead at the start of the fourth quarter into a disappointing 24\u201313 loss.\n\nIn the [[1975 NFL season|1975 season]] opener, the [[1975 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] beat [[1975 Miami Dolphins season|Miami]] and ended their 31-game home winning streak. With an 11\u20133 record, they defeated [[1975 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati]] 31\u201328 in the divisional playoff round. Again, the Raiders faced the [[1975 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] in the conference championship, eager for revenge. According to Madden and Davis, the Raiders relied on quick movement by their wide receivers on the outside sidelines \u2013 the deep threat, or 'long ball' \u2013 more so than the Steelers of that year, whose offense was far more run-oriented than it would become later in the 1970s. Forced to adapt to the frozen field of Three Rivers Stadium, with receivers slipping and unable to make quick moves to beat coverage, the Raiders lost, 16\u201310. The rivalry had now grown to hatred, and became the stereotype of the 'grudge match.' Again, the Raiders came up short, as the Steelers won the AFC Championship and then went on to another Super Bowl title.\n\nIn [[1976 NFL season|1976]], the [[1976 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] came from behind dramatically to beat [[1976 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh]] 31\u201328 in the season opener and continued to cement its reputation for dirty play by knocking WR [[Lynn Swann]] out for two weeks with a clothesline to the helmet. Al Davis later tried to sue Steelers coach [[Chuck Noll]] for libel after the latter called safety [[George Atkinson (safety)|George Atkinson]] a criminal for the hit. The Raiders won 13 regular season games and a close controversial 21\u201317 victory over [[1976 New England Patriots season|New England]] in the divisional playoffs. With the Patriots up by three points in final two minutes, referee Ben Dreith called roughing the passer on New England's [[Ray Hamilton|Ray \"Sugar Bear\" Hamilton]] after he hit Oakland QB Ken Stabler. The Raiders went on to score a touchdown in the final minute to win. They then defeated the Steelers 24\u20137 in the AFC Championship to advance to their second Super Bowl. In [[Super Bowl XI]], Oakland's opponent was the [[1976 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], a team that had lost three previous Super Bowls. The Raiders jumped out to an early lead and led 16\u20130 at halftime. By the end, having forced Minnesota into multiple turnovers, the Raiders won 32\u201314 for their first Super Bowl and post-merger championship.\n\nThe [[1977 NFL season|following season]] saw the [[1977 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] finish 11\u20133, but they lost the division title to the [[1977 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]]. They settled for a wild card, beating the [[1977 Baltimore Colts season|Colts]] in the second-longest overtime game in NFL history and which featured the [[Ghost to the Post]]. however, the Raiders then fell to the Broncos in the AFC Championship.\n\nDuring a 1978 preseason game, Patriots WR [[Darryl Stingley]] was injured by a hit from Raiders FS Jack Tatum and paralyzed for life. Although the [[1978 Oakland Raiders season|1978 Raiders]] achieved a winning record at 9\u20137, they missed the playoffs for the first time since 1971, losing critical games down the stretch to miss the playoffs.\n\n====Tom Flores====\nAfter 10 consecutive winning seasons and one Super Bowl championship, John Madden left coaching in 1979 to pursue a career as a television football commentator. His replacement was former Raiders quarterback [[Tom Flores]], the first Hispanic head coach in NFL history.<ref name=\"hispanic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/insider/2001/raidersnewhouse_091801.html |title=1980 Raiders were outcasts, champions |accessdate=January 25, 2007 |last=Newhouse |first=Dave |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123200328/http://www.nfl.com/insider/2001/raidersnewhouse_091801.html |archivedate=January 23, 2007}}</ref> Flores led the [[1979 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] to another 9\u20137 [[1979 NFL season|season]], but the team missed the playoffs.\n\nIn the midst of the turmoil of Al Davis' attempts to move the team to Los Angeles in [[1980 NFL season|1980]], Flores looked to lead the [[1980 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] to their third Super Bowl by finishing the season 11\u20135 and earning a wild card berth. Quarterback [[Jim Plunkett]] revitalized his career, taking over in game five when starter [[Dan Pastorini]] was lost for the season to a broken leg after owner Al Davis had picked up Pastorini when he swapped quarterbacks with the [[1980 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]], sending the beloved [[Ken Stabler]] to the Oilers. The Raiders defeated Stabler and the Oilers in the Wild Card game and advanced to the AFC Championship by defeating the [[1980 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]] 14\u201312. The Raiders slipped by the AFC West champion San Diego Chargers to advance to their third Super Bowl. In [[Super Bowl XV]], the Raiders faced head coach [[Dick Vermeil]]'s [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. The Raiders dominated the Eagles, taking an early 14\u20130 lead in the first quarter behind two touchdown passes by Plunkett, including a then-Super Bowl record 80-yard pass and catch to running back [[Kenny King (running back)|Kenny King]]. A [[Cliff Branch]] third quarter touchdown reception put the Raiders up 21\u20133 in the third quarter. They would go on to win 27\u201310, winning their second Super Bowl and becoming the first team to ever win the Super Bowl after getting into the playoffs as the wild card team.\n\n===Los Angeles era (1982\u20131994)===\nIn 1980 Al Davis attempted unsuccessfully to have improvements made to the [[Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum]], specifically the addition of [[luxury box]]es. That year, he signed a [[memorandum of agreement]] to move the Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles. The move, which required three-fourths approval by league owners, was defeated 22\u20130 (with five owners abstaining). When Davis tried to move the team anyway, he was blocked by an [[injunction]]. In response, the Raiders not only became an active partner in an [[Competition law|antitrust]] lawsuit filed by the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] (who had recently lost the [[Los Angeles Rams]] to [[Angel Stadium|Anaheim]]), but filed an antitrust lawsuit of their own.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 168.</ref> After the first case was declared a [[Trial|mistrial]], in May 1982, a second jury found in favor of Davis and the Los Angeles Coliseum, clearing the way for the move.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 172.</ref><ref name=\"moveone\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/davisall.shtml |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020223180421/http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/davisall.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 23, 2002 |title=Al Davis biography |accessdate=January 30, 2007 |work=HickokSports.com}}</ref><ref name=\"movetwo\">{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/add_davis_al.html |title=Good guys wear black |accessdate=January 30, 2007 |last=Puma |first=Mike |date=December 1, 2003 |publisher=[[ESPN Classic]]}}</ref> With the ruling, the Raiders would relocate to Los Angeles for the [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]] to play their home games at the Memorial Coliseum.\n\nThe Raiders' final campaign of their first run in Oakland of [[1981 Oakland Raiders season|1981]] saw the team fall to a 7\u20139 record, failing to make the playoffs following their Super Bowl win.\n\nThe newly minted [[1982 Los Angeles Raiders season|Los Angeles Raiders]] finished the [[1982 NFL strike|strike-shortened]] [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]] 8\u20131 to win the AFC West, but lost in the second round of the [[1982\u201383 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] to the [[1982 New York Jets season|Jets]]. The [[1983 NFL season|following season]], the [[1983 Los Angeles Raiders season|Raiders]] finished 12\u20134 to win the AFC West. Convincing playoff wins over the [[1983 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] and [[1983 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] in the [[1983\u201384 NFL playoffs|AFC playoffs]] propelled the Raiders to their fourth Super Bowl. Against the [[1983 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] in [[Super Bowl XVIII]], the Raiders built a lead after blocking a punt and recovering for a touchdown early in the game. A Branch touchdown reception from Plunkett put the Raiders up 14\u20130 with more than nine minutes remaining in the first quarter. With seven seconds remaining in the first half, linebacker [[Jack Squirek]] intercepted a [[Joe Theismann]] [[swing pass]] at the Washington five-yard line and scored, sending the Raiders to a 21\u20133 halftime lead. Following a [[John Riggins]] one-yard touchdown run (extra point was blocked), [[Marcus Allen]] scored from five yards out to build the lead to 28\u20139. The Raiders sealed the game with Allen reversed his route on a Super Bowl record run that turned into a 74-yard touchdown. The Raiders went on to a 38\u20139 victory and their third NFL championship. Allen set a record for most rushing yards (191) and combined yards (209) in a Super Bowl as the Raiders won their third Super Bowl in eight years.\n\n[[File:1985 Police Raiders-Rams - 01 Marcus Allen (crop).jpg|thumb|230px|left|Raiders' Hall of Famer [[Marcus Allen]] is considered one of the greatest goal line and short-yard runners in National Football League history.]]\nThe [[1984 Los Angeles Raiders season|team]] had another successful regular season in [[1984 NFL season|1984]], finishing 11\u20135, but a three-game losing streak forced them to enter the playoffs as a wild-card, where they fell to the [[1984 Seattle Seahawks season|Seahawks]] in the Wild Card game.\n\nThe [[1985 Los Angeles Raiders season|1985 Raiders]] campaign saw 12 wins and a division title as Marcus Allen was named MVP. However, a loss to the [[1985 New England Patriots season|Patriots]] derailed any further postseason hopes.\n\nThe Raiders' fortunes declined after that, and from [[1986 Los Angeles Raiders season|1986]] to [[1989 Los Angeles Raiders season|1989]], they finished no better than 8\u20138 and posted consecutive losing seasons for the first time since 1961\u201362. Also in 1986, Al Davis got into a widely publicized argument with Marcus Allen, whom he accused of faking injuries. The feud continued into [[1987 Los Angeles Raiders season|1987]], and Davis retaliated by signing [[Bo Jackson]] to essentially replace Allen. However, Jackson was also a [[left fielder]] for [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Kansas City Royals]], and could not play full-time until baseball season ended in October. Even worse, another [[1987 NFL strike|strike]] cost the NFL one game and prompted them to use substitute players. The Raiders achieved a 1\u20132 record before the regular players returned after the strike. After a weak 5\u201310 finish, Tom Flores moved to the front office and was replaced by Denver Broncos offensive assistant coach [[Mike Shanahan]].\n\nShanahan led the team to a 7\u20139 season in [[1988 Los Angeles Raiders season|1988]], and Allen and Jackson continued to trade places as the starting running back. Low game attendance and fan apathy were evident by this point, and in the summer of 1988, rumors of a Raiders return to Oakland intensified when a preseason game against the [[1988 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] was scheduled at Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 234.</ref>\n\nAs early as 1986, Davis sought to abandon the Coliseum in favor of a more modern stadium. In addition to sharing the venue with the [[USC Trojans football|USC Trojans]], the Raiders were less than ecstatic with the Coliseum as it was aging and still lacked the luxury suites and other amenities that Davis was promised when he moved the Raiders to Los Angeles.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 230.</ref> Finally, the Coliseum had 95,000 seats and the Raiders were rarely able to fill all of them even in their best years, and so most Raiders home games were blacked out in Southern California. Numerous sites in California were considered, including one near now-defunct [[Hollywood Park Racetrack|Hollywood Park]] in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]], where [[SoFi Stadium]] for the Rams and Chargers is under construction, and another in [[Carson, California|Carson]]. In August 1987 it was announced that the city of [[Irwindale, California|Irwindale]] paid Davis US$10&nbsp;million as a good-faith deposit for a prospective stadium site.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 232.</ref> When the bid failed, Davis kept the non-refundable deposit.<ref name=\"deposit\">{{cite news |title=Al Davis may retire if Raiders win |url=http://bengals.enquirer.com/2003/01/23/wwwsbdavis.html |work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] |agency=Associated Press |date=January 23, 2003 |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130102133117/http://bengals.enquirer.com/2003/01/23/wwwsbdavis.html |archive-date=January 2, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"irwindale\">{{cite news|first=Bill |last=Plaschke |title=Shades of Gray |url=http://apse.dallasnews.com/contest/2003/writing/over250/over250.columns.third3-4.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804232618/http://apse.dallasnews.com/contest/2003/writing/over250/over250.columns.third3-4.html |archivedate=August 4, 2007}}</ref> During this time Davis also almost moved the team to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] in a deal that would have included Davis becoming the managing partner of the [[Sacramento Kings]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/kings/sacramento-raiders-it-was-done-deal|title=Sacramento Raiders?

The Raider games were called on radio from 1960 to 1962 by Bud (Wilson Keene) Foster and Mel Venter, and from 1963 to 1965 by Bob Blum and Dan Galvin.

Sunday night games are on Las Vegas affiliate [[KSNV]] (NBC 3) and [[NBC]] Bay Area affiliate [[KNTV]] (NBC Channel 11). In 2018, Thursday games moved to Fox 2 and Fox 5 in Oakland and Las Vegas, respectively, formerly airing on either NBC or CBS prior to 2018. All Thursday games air on NFL Network otherwise. Traditionally, Monday night games airing on ESPN would air ABC affiliates KTNV 13 in Las Vegas and 7 in Oakland.\n\nDuring the team's two tenures in Oakland the Raiders were a [[NFL on Television#49ers and Raiders|beneficiary of league scheduling policies]]. Both the Raiders and the [[San Francisco 49ers]] shared the San Francisco Bay Area market, on the West Coast of the United States. This meant that the Raiders could not play any home games, road division games against the [[Denver Broncos]] or [[Los Angeles Chargers]], or interconference road games against the [[NFC West]] (in seasons that the [[AFC West]] and NFC West meet in interconference play) in the early 10:00&nbsp;a.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific time]] slot. In addition, they could not play interconference home games at the same time or network as the 49ers. As a result, both teams generally had more limited scheduling options, and also benefited by receiving more prime time games than usual.\n\nStarting shortly after the announcement of the Raider franchise relocation to Las Vegas, KVVU-TV, the local Fox affiliate in Las Vegas began carrying all Raiders preseason games and special content alongside Bay Area preseason game and special content broadcaster KTVU.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.raiders.com/news/article-1/Raiders-Announce-Official-Las-Vegas-Media-Partnerships-With-KVVU-FOX5-TV-And-Beasley-Media-Group/fa3a2aed-05cb-4d6f-aedb-d0545470d9f7|title=Raiders Announce Official Las Vegas Media Partnerships With KVVU FOX5 TV And Beasley Media Group|publisher=|access-date=December 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170604025525/http://www.raiders.com/news/article-1/Raiders-Announce-Official-Las-Vegas-Media-Partnerships-With-KVVU-FOX5-TV-And-Beasley-Media-Group/fa3a2aed-05cb-4d6f-aedb-d0545470d9f7|archive-date=June 4, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Likewise in the Los Angeles market, [[KTLA]] (CW 5) is the local affiliate.\n\n==Rivals==\nThe Raiders have rivalries with the other three teams in the [[AFC West]] ([[Denver Broncos]], [[Kansas City Chiefs]], and [[Los Angeles Chargers]]) and a geographic rivalry with the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. They also have rivalries with other teams that arose from playoff battles in the past, most notably with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and the [[New England Patriots]]. The [[Seattle Seahawks]] have an old rivalry with Oakland/Los Angeles/Las Vegas as well, but the rivalry largely died down when the Seahawks moved to the [[NFC West]] as part of the NFL's 2002 realignment.\n\n===Divisional rivals===\n;Kansas City Chiefs\n{{Further|Chiefs\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 49 - Robert Holmes.jpg|thumb|190px|right|The Raiders playing the Chiefs in the 1969 [[1969 American Football League Championship Game|AFL championship game]]]]\nThe [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]] are one of the Raiders' most iconic and longstanding divisional foes, with the rivalry dating back to earliest days of the AFL. Oakland lost the 1969 AFL Championship against Kansas City, who went on to beat the [[1969 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] and win the Super Bowl. From 1990 to 1999, the Raiders have lost 17 out of 20 regular season meetings between the Chiefs, including a 10\u2013game losing streak at Kansas City; the Raiders also lost to the Chiefs 10\u20136 in the Wild Card round on December 28, 1991. On September 8, 1996, the Chiefs also began to lead the overall series against the Raiders for the first time since November 23, 1969. On January 1, 2000, the last game of the 1999 NFL regular season, the Raiders defeated the Chiefs for the first time in Kansas City since 1988 in overtime on a 33-yard field goal kick made by Joe Nedney. The Chiefs lead the overall series '''64\u201353\u20132''', and are the only team in the AFC West that the Raiders have a losing record against. Oakland currently has defeated Kansas City just twice since the 2012 NFL season. Until October 19, 2017 - when they defeated the Chiefs, 31\u201330 on a game-tying touchdown on the last play of the game, leading to a game winning PAT - the Raiders had lost five straight to the Chiefs, their previous win against them being in the 2014 season.\n\n;Denver Broncos\n{{Further|Broncos\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 47 - Randy Gradishar.jpg|right|thumb|The Raiders playing against the Broncos in the [[1977-78 NFL playoffs|1977-78 AFC Championship Game]].]]\nThe Raiders' rivalry with the [[Denver Broncos|Broncos]], is considered to be one of the most heated and well known rivalries in NFL history. The Raiders managed a 14-game winning streak against the Broncos from 1965 to 1971, which lasted until October 22, 1972, when the Broncos defeated the Raiders 30\u201323. While the Raiders still hold the advantage in the all-time series '''63\u201353\u20132''', the Broncos amassed 21 wins in 28 games, from the 1995 season and the arrival of Broncos head coach [[Mike Shanahan]], through the 2008 season. Shanahan coached the Raiders before being fired just four games into the 1989 season, which has only served to intensify this rivalry. On October 24, 2010, the Raiders beat the Broncos (59\u201314), giving the Raiders the most points scored in a game in the team's history. On December 13, 2015, the Raiders pulled a huge upset on the Broncos (15\u201312) by a spectacular performance from their defense allowing 4 field goals. Linebacker Khalil Mack who recorded 5 sacks in that game against Denver which is tied the most sacks in franchise along with Howie Long. The Broncos reached their first ever Super Bowl when they defeated the Raiders 20\u201317 in the AFC Championship Game. The two teams have faced off on Monday Night Football a total of 19 times, making it the most frequent Monday Night matchup in NFL history. \n\n;Los Angeles Chargers\n{{Further|Chargers\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\nThe [[Los Angeles Chargers]]' rivalry with Oakland dates to the 1963 season, when the Raiders defeated the heavily favored Chargers twice, both come-from-behind fourth quarter victories. The Raiders held a streak without losing to the Chargers with a 16\u20130\u20132 record from 1968 to 1977. One of the most memorable games between these teams was the \"Holy Roller\" game in 1978, in which the Raiders fumbled for a touchdown in a very controversial play. In January 1981 the Chargers hosted their first AFC title against the Raiders. The Raiders were victorious over the Chargers of a score 34\u201327. The Raiders ended up moving on to play in Super Bowl 15 defeating the Eagles 27\u201310. On November 22, 1982, the Raiders hosted their first Monday Night football game in Los Angeles against the San Diego Chargers. The Chargers led the game in the 1st half 24\u20130 until the Raiders came into the 2nd half and made a huge comeback and defeated the San Diego Chargers 28\u201324. On October 10, 2010, the Raiders ended their 13-game losing streak to the San Diego Chargers with a score of 35\u201327. The Raiders hold the overall series advantage at '''63\u201354\u20132'''.\n\n===Historical rivals===\n\n====Pittsburgh Steelers====\n{{main|Raiders\u2013Steelers rivalry}}\nThe [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]' rivalry with the Raiders has historically been very tight; as of the 2018 season the Raiders lead the regular season series 13 wins to 10, and their playoff rivalry is tied 3\u20133. The rivalry was extremely intense during the 1970s, and considered by many to be one of most vicious and brutal in the history of Professional football. From 1972 to 1976 the teams would meet in the playoffs five consecutive times, including three consecutive AFC Championship games. The rivalry really kicked off during the teams\u2019 first playoff meeting at the 1972 AFC divisional round in Pittsburgh. Considered to be one of the most famous plays in NFL history, the \"[[Immaculate Reception]]\", as it was dubbed, saw the Steelers beat the Raiders on a controversial last second play. During the 1975 AFC Championship game, Raiders strong safety [[George Atkinson (safety)|George Atkinson]] delivered a hit on Pittsburgh wide receiver [[Lynn Swann]], which left him concussed. When the two teams met in the 1976 season opener, Atkinson again hit Swann, this time with a forearm to the head, causing yet another concussion. After the second incident, Steelers head coach [[Chuck Noll]] referred to Atkinson as part of the \"criminal element\" in the NFL. Atkinson filed a $2&nbsp;million [[defamation]] lawsuit against Noll and the Steelers, which he lost.<ref name=\"atkinson\">{{cite news|first=Bob |last=Smizik |title=Raiders of the lost rivalry |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06302/733903-194.stm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108175110/http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06302/733903-194.stm |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 8, 2006 |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=October 29, 2006 |accessdate=January 31, 2007}}</ref> The rivalry reached its apex in the late 1980s, cooled when the teams faced each other only sporadically, then headed up again in the late 1990s before cooling again.\n\nThe four most recent contests between the Raiders and Steelers harkened back to the rivalry's history of bitterness and close competition. On December 6, 2009, the 3\u20138 Raiders helped spoil the [[Super Bowl XLIII|defending champions]]' quest for the playoffs as the game lead changed five times in the fourth quarter and a [[Louis Murphy]] touchdown with 11 seconds to go won it 27\u201324 for the Raiders. Oakland was then beaten 35\u20133 by Pittsburgh on November 21, 2010; this game brought out the roughness of the rivalry's 1970s history when Steelers quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] was punched by Raiders defensive end [[Richard Seymour]] following a touchdown. On November 8, 2015, the Steelers outplayed the Raiders for a 38\u201335 victory. During the game, the Raiders defense allowed wide receiver [[Antonio Brown]] to catch 17 passes for 284 yards. Both are Steelers team records and the 284 yards is the 7th most yards receiving in a game in NFL history. However, in 2018, the Raiders upset the Steelers again, scoring a late touchdown to take a 24\u201321 fourth-quarter lead and getting the last laugh when Steelers kicker [[Chris Boswell]] slipped and missed a game-tying field goal. This game, which will likely be the teams' final matchup in Oakland, contributed to the Steelers' late-season collapse and missing the playoffs that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/12/09/raiders-block-fg-to-finish-dramatic-upset-of-steelers-24-21/ |title=Raiders Block FG To Finish Dramatic Upset of Steelers, 24-21 |publisher=CBS San Francisco |work=The Associated Press |date=9 December 2018 |accessdate=19 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190531012748/https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/12/09/raiders-block-fg-to-finish-dramatic-upset-of-steelers-24-21/ |archive-date=May 31, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====New England Patriots====\nThe rivalry between the Raiders and [[New England Patriots]] dates to their time in the AFL, but was intensified during a 1978 preseason game, when Patriots wide receiver [[Darryl Stingley]] was permanently paralyzed after a vicious hit delivered by Raiders free safety [[Jack Tatum]]. Before that, New England also lost a playoff game in 1976 to the Raiders; the game is unofficially known as \"The [[Ben Dreith]] Game\" due to a controversial penalty by head referee Dreith. While based in Los Angeles, the team hosted New England in the divisional round of the playoffs in 1986. The game was won by New England and marred by a chaotic rumble between the teams in the end zone as players were leaving the field after the game. The brawl was especially notable for [[Matt Millen]] attacking Patriots GM [[Patrick Sullivan (American football executive)|Patrick Sullivan]] with his helmet. The two teams met in a [[2001\u201302 NFL playoffs|divisional-round]] playoff game in 2002, which became known as the \"[[Tuck Rule Game]]\". Late in the game, an incomplete pass, ruled a fumble, by Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was overturned, and New England went on to win in overtime and eventually won the Super Bowl against the heavily favored [[2001 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]], the Raiders' former crosstown rivals in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"pats\">{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Halley |title=Patriots-Raiders: No love lost over time |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2005-09-08-pats-raiders-history_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |date=September 8, 2005 |accessdate=January 31, 2007}}</ref> Since that game, the Patriots have won five of the last six regular season contests between the two teams.

The Raiders faced the Dolphins twice in the early 1970s; the Dolphins defeated the Raiders in the 1973 AFC Championship Game 27\u201310 on their way to [[Super Bowl VIII]]. The next year in the divisional playoffs the Raiders trailed Miami 26\u201321; in the final minute the Raiders drove to the Miami eight-yard line; a desperation pass by [[Ken Stabler]] was caught in traffic by [[Clarence Davis]] in the play known as the \"Sea of Hands.\"\n\nThe Raiders faced the Houston Oilers throughout the AFL era and twice in AFL playoffs in the late 1960s, winning 40\u20137 in 1967 on their way to [[Super Bowl II]] and 56\u20137 in the 1969 divisional playoffs. Oakland defeated the Oilers in the 1980 Wild Card playoffs 27\u20137 and defeated the Titans in the 2002 AFC Championship Game 41\u201324.\n\n====Historic battle of the Bay rivalry====\n{{Main|49ers\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\nThe [[San Francisco 49ers]], located on the other side of [[San Francisco Bay]], were the Raiders' geographic rivals during the Raiders' time in Oakland. The first exhibition game, played in 1967, ended with the 49ers defeating the AFL Raiders 13\u201310. After the 1970 merger, the 49ers won in Oakland 38\u20137. As a result, games between the two are referred to as the \"Battle of the Bay.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Since the two teams play in different conferences, regular season matchups happen only once every four years. Fans and players of the winning team could claim \"bragging rights\" as the better team in the area.\n\nOn August 20, 2011, in the third week of the preseason, the preseason game between the rivals was marked by fights in restrooms and stands at [[Candlestick Park]], including a shooting outside the stadium in which several were injured. The NFL has decided to cancel all future preseason games between the Raiders and 49ers.\n\nThe series ended on November 1, 2018, during a Thursday Night Football broadcast at Levi's Stadium, marking the last time both teams would meet before the Raiders moved to their new home in Las Vegas. The 49ers won the game 34-3 to tie their regular season series at 7.\n\n====Historic battle for Los Angeles rivalry====\nAs mentioned earlier, the Raiders and [[Los Angeles Rams]] had a rivalry during the 13 years both teams shared the Los Angeles market. The teams met six times in the regular season in this period; the Raiders won the first meeting of this era, 37\u201331, on December 18, 1982. The Raiders won four of their six games against the Rams while the teams shares the Los Angeles market.\n\n==Ownership, administration and financial operations==\n\n===Founding of the franchise===\nMax Winter, a Minneapolis businessman was among the eight proposed franchise owners in the American Football League. In a move typical of the NFL owners who were frightened by the prospect of competition and continually obstructed the new league, they offered Winter an expansion franchise in the NFL. This was after the NFL had rejected Lamar Hunt's feelers, saying they were not interested in expansion. One of many obfuscations put forward by the NFL in its attempt to derail the AFL.\n\nAfter the AFL's first draft, in which players were selected for the then nameless Minneapolis franchise, Winter reneged from his agreement with the AFL owners and defected to the NFL with a franchise that started play in 1961 and was named the [[Minnesota Vikings]]. The Vikings were never an AFL team, nor did they have any association with the AFL. Many of the players (including Abner Haynes) that had been assigned to the UNNAMED and defunct Minneapolis AFL franchise were signed by some of the seven loyal remaining members of the AFL's '[[Foolish Club]]'.\n\nThe city of Oakland was awarded the eighth AFL franchise on January 30, 1960. Once the consortium of owners was found for the eighth franchise, the team was named the Raiders.<ref name=\"hof\">{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.jsp?franchise_id=23 |title=Pro Football Hall of Fame \u2013 Oakland Raiders |accessdate=January 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230070530/http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.jsp?franchise_id=23 |archive-date=December 30, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', p. 7.</ref> Because many of the defunct Minneapolis franchise's originally drafted players were signed by other AFL teams, the AFL held an 'allocation' draft, in which each team earmarked players that could be chosen by the Raiders.\n\nThe Minneapolis group did not take with them any of the rights to players they drafted when they defected to the NFL, because their first draft in that league was in 1961. The Raiders were not originally in Minnesota as some claim. They were a new, charter franchise in the [[American Football League]]. One reason they were so weak in the first few years of the AFL was that the other AFL teams did not make quality players available in the allocation draft.\n\nAt the time, Oakland seemed an unlikely venue for a professional football team. The city had not asked for a team, there was no ownership group and there was no stadium in Oakland suitable for pro football (the closest stadiums were in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and San Francisco) and there was already a successful NFL franchise in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] in the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. However, the AFL owners selected Oakland after [[Los Angeles Chargers]] owner [[Barron Hilton]] threatened to forfeit his franchise unless a second team was placed on the West Coast.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nUpon receiving the franchise, Oakland civic leaders found a number of businesspeople willing to invest in the new team. A [[limited partnership]] was formed to own the team headed by managing general partner [[Chet Soda|Y. Charles (Chet) Soda]] (1908\u201389), a local real estate developer, and included general partners Ed McGah (1899\u20131983), Robert Osborne (1898\u20131968), [[F. Wayne Valley]] (1914\u201386), restaurateur Harvey Binns (1914\u201382), Don Blessing (1904\u20132000), and contractor Charles Harney (1902\u201362)<ref>Harney was the builder of San Francisco's Candlestick Park, built on a bleak parcel of land he owned; to date, the road leading to the stadium is known as Harney Way. With a push from Harney, the Raiders were allowed to play their final three 1960 home games at Candlestick.</ref> as well as numerous limited partners.\n\nThe [[1960 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] finished their first campaign with a 6\u20138 record, and lost $500,000. Desperately in need of money to continue running the team, Valley received a $400,000 loan from [[Buffalo Bills]] founder [[Ralph C. Wilson Jr.]]<ref name=\"dvd\">{{cite video |people=[[Steve Sabol]] (Executive Producer) |date=2004 |title=Raiders \u2013 The Complete History |medium=DVD |publisher=NFL Productions LLC}}</ref>\n\nAfter the conclusion of the first season Soda dropped out of the partnership, and on January 17, 1961, Valley, McGah and Osborne bought out the remaining four general partners. Soon after, Valley and McGah purchased Osborne's interest, with Valley named as the managing general partner.\n\nIn 1962 Valley hired Al Davis, a former assistant coach for the San Diego Chargers, as head coach and general manager. In April 1966 Davis left the Raiders after being named AFL Commissioner. Two months later, the league announced its [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger with the NFL]]. With the merger, the position of commissioner was no longer needed, and Davis entered into discussions with Valley about returning to the Raiders. On July 25, 1966, Davis returned as part owner of the team. He purchased a 10% interest in the team for US$18,000, and became the team's third general partner \u2013 the partner in charge of football operations.<ref name=\"burke\"/><ref name=\"Dickey, Just Win, Baby, p. 41\"/>\n\nIn 1972, with Wayne Valley out of the country for several weeks attending the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in Munich, Davis's attorneys drafted a revised partnership agreement that gave him total control over all of the Raiders' operations. McGah, a supporter of Davis, signed the agreement. Under partnership law, by a 2\u20131 vote of the general partners, the new agreement was thus ratified.

The Raiders compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the league's [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC West|West]] division. The Raiders will play their home games at [[Allegiant Stadium]] in [[Paradise, Nevada]] in 2020.\n\nFounded on January 30, 1960, and originally based in [[Oakland, California]], they played their first regular season game on September 11, 1960, as a charter member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL). They moved to the NFL with the [[AFL-NFL merger]] in 1970. The team departed Oakland to play in [[Los Angeles]] from the [[1982 Los Angeles Raiders season|1982 season]] through the [[1994 Los Angeles Raiders season|1994 season]] before returning to Oakland at the start of the [[1995 Oakland Raiders season|1995 season]]. On March 27, 2017, NFL team owners voted nearly unanimously to approve the Raiders' application to [[Oakland Raiders relocation to Las Vegas|relocate]] to Las Vegas. Nearly three years later, on January 22, 2020, the Raiders officially moved to Las Vegas.<ref name=\"JScottNFL\">{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Jelani|title=Raiders officially announce 'Las Vegas Raiders' title|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001098555/article/raiders-officially-announce-las-vegas-raiders-title|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=January 22, 2020|access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"LVRaiders\">{{cite news|author=Raiders Media Relations|title=Las Vegas Raiders - Silver and Black officially welcomed to the Silver State|url=https://www.raiders.com/news/las-vegas-raiders-silver-and-black-officially-welcomed-to-the-silver-state|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Raiders.com|date=January 22, 2020|access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Raiders' off-field fortunes have varied considerably over the years. The team's first three years of operation ([[1960 Oakland Raiders season|1960]]\u2013[[1962 Oakland Raiders season|1962]]) were marred by poor on-field performance, financial difficulties, and spotty attendance. In [[1963 Oakland Raiders season|1963]], however, the Raiders' fortunes improved dramatically with the introduction of head coach (and eventual owner) [[Al Davis]]. In [[1967 Oakland Raiders season|1967]], after several years of improvement, the Raiders reached the postseason for the first time. The team would go on to win its first (and only) [[1967 American Football League Championship Game|AFL Championship]] that year; in doing so, the Raiders advanced to [[Super Bowl II]], where they were soundly defeated by the [[Green Bay Packers]]. Since 1963, the team has won 15 division titles (3 AFL and 12 NFL), 4 AFC Championships ([[1976\u201377 NFL playoffs|1976]], [[1980\u201381 NFL playoffs|1980]], [[1983\u201384 NFL playoffs|1983]], and [[2002\u201303 NFL playoffs|2002]]), 1 AFL Championship ([[1967 American Football League Championship Game|1967]]), and 3 Super Bowl Championships ([[Super Bowl XI|XI]], [[Super Bowl XV|XV]], and [[Super Bowl XVIII|XVIII]]). At the end of the NFL's [[2019 NFL season|2019 season]], the Raiders have an all-time regular season record of 473 wins, 432 losses, and 11 ties; their all-time playoff record currently stands at 25 wins and 19 losses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rai/|title=Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders Team Encyclopedia {{!}} Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=July 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAl Davis owned the team from 1972 until his death in 2011.

They have previously played at [[Kezar Stadium]] and [[Candlestick Park]] in San Francisco, [[Frank Youell Field]] and [[Oakland Coliseum]] in Oakland, and the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] in Los Angeles.\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{See also|History of the Oakland Raiders|History of the Los Angeles Raiders}}\n===First Oakland era (1960\u20131981)===\n{{NFL Raiders history}}\nThe Oakland Raiders were originally going to be called the \"Oakland Se\u00f1ors\"<ref>\"Grid Team Named-- They're Senors\", ''Oakland Tribune'', April 5, 1960, p37. Soda said, \"My own personal choice would have been Mavericks, but I believe we came up with a real fine name.\" The selection committee narrowed the choices down to Admirals, Lakers, Diablos, Seawolves, Gauchos, Nuggets, Se\u00f1ors, Dons, Costers, Grandees, Sequoias, Missiles, Knights, Redwoods, Clippers, Jets and Dolphins.</ref> after a name-the-team contest had that name finish first, but after being the target of local jokes, the name was changed to the Raiders before the 1960 season began. Having enjoyed a successful collegiate coaching career at [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]] during the 1950s, San Francisco native [[Eddie Erdelatz]] was hired as the Raiders' first head coach. On February 9, 1960, after rejecting offers from the NFL's [[Washington Redskins]] and the AFL's [[Los Angeles Chargers]], Erdelatz accepted the Raiders' head coaching position. In January 1960, the Raiders were established in Oakland, and because of NFL interference with the original eighth franchise owner, were the last team of eight in the new [[American Football League]] to select players, thus relegated to the remaining talent available (see below).\n\nThe [[1960 Oakland Raiders season|1960 Raiders]] 42-man roster included 28 rookies and only 14 veterans. Among the Raiders rookies were future Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee center [[Jim Otto]], and a future Raiders head coach, quarterback [[Tom Flores]]. In their debut year under Erdelatz the [[1960 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] finished with a 6\u20138 record.\n\nOn September 18, 1961, Erdelatz was dismissed after the Raiders were outscored 77\u201346 in the first two games of the season. On September 24, 1961, after the dismissal of Erdelatz, management named Los Angeles native and offensive line coach [[Marty Feldman (American football coach)|Marty Feldman]] as the Raiders head coach. The team finished the 1961 season with a 2\u201312 record.\n\nFeldman began the [[1962 Oakland Raiders season|1962 season]] as Raiders head coach but was fired on October 16, 1962 after an 0\u20135 start. From October 16 through December, the Raiders were coached by Oklahoma native and former assistant coach [[Red Conkright]]. Under Conkright, the Raiders went 1\u20138, finishing the season with 1\u201313 record. Following the 1962 season the Raiders appointed Conkright to an interim mentor position as they looked for a new head coach.\n\n====Al Davis====\nAfter the 1962 season, Raiders managing general partner [[F. Wayne Valley]] hired Al Davis as Raiders head coach and general manager. At 33, he was the youngest person in professional football history to hold the positions.<ref name=\"youngest\">{{cite web |url=http://www.raiders.com/history/gm11.jsp |title=Raiders Stun Chargers with 33-Point 4th Quarter Outburst |accessdate=February 4, 2007 |work=Raiders.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230172729/http://www.raiders.com/history/gm11.jsp |archivedate=December 30, 2006}}</ref> Davis immediately began to implement what he termed the \"vertical game\", an aggressive offensive strategy inspired by the offense developed by Chargers head coach [[Sid Gillman]].<ref name=\"gillman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chargers.com/news/headlines/news-104158080019831.htm |title=Memories of Sid Gillman |accessdate=February 1, 2007 |work=Chargers.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090813/http://www.chargers.com/news/headlines/news-104158080019831.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2007}}</ref> Under Davis the [[1963 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] improved to 10\u20134 and he was named the AFL's Coach of the Year in 1963. Though the team slipped to 5\u20137\u20132 in [[1964 Oakland Raiders season|1964]], they rebounded to an 8\u20135\u20131 record in [[1965 Oakland Raiders season|1965]]. The famous silver and black Raider uniform debuted at the regular season opening game on September 8, 1963. Prior to this, the team wore a combination of black and white with gold trim on the pants and oversized numerals.\n\n====Davis's departure and return====\nIn April 1966 Davis left the Raiders after being named AFL Commissioner, promoting assistant coach [[John Rauch]] to head coach. Two months later, the league announced its [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger with the NFL]]. The leagues would retain separate regular seasons until [[1970 NFL season|1970]]. With the merger, the position of commissioner was no longer needed, and Davis entered into discussions with Valley about returning to the Raiders. On July 25, 1966, Davis returned as part-owner of the team. He purchased a 10% interest in the team for $18,000, and became the team's third general partner \u2013 the partner in charge of football operations.<ref name=\"burke\">{{cite magazine |last=Burke |first=Monte |title=A New Test For an Old Raider |magazine=Forbes Magazine |date =September 18, 2006 |url=https://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2006/0918/112.html |accessdate=January 25, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"Dickey, Just Win, Baby, p. 41\">Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', p. 41.</ref>\n\nUnder Rauch, the Raiders matched their 1965 season's 8\u20135\u20131 record in [[1966 Oakland Raiders season|1966]] but missed the playoffs, finishing second in the AFL West Division.\n\n====First Super Bowl appearance: 1967 ====\nOn the field, the team Davis had assembled steadily improved. Led by quarterback [[Daryle Lamonica]], acquired in a trade with the [[Buffalo Bills]], the Raiders finished the [[1967 Oakland Raiders season|1967 season]] with a 13\u20131 record and won the [[1967 American Football League Championship Game|1967 AFL Championship]], defeating the [[1967 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] 40\u20137. The win earned the team a trip to the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] in Miami, Florida to participate in [[Super Bowl II]]. On January 14, 1968, the Raiders were defeated in the second-ever Super Bowl, losing 33\u201314 to [[Vince Lombardi]]'s [[1967 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]].\n\nThe following year, the [[1968 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] ended the [[1968 AFL season|1968 season]] with a 12\u20132 record and again winning the AFL West Division title. However, this time, they lost 27\u201323 by the [[1968 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] in the [[1968 American Football League Championship Game|AFL Championship Game]].\n\nCiting management conflicts with day-to-day coaching decisions, Rauch resigned as Raiders head coach on January 16, 1969, accepting the head coaching job of the Buffalo Bills.\n\n====John Madden====\nDuring the early 1960s, [[John Madden]] was a defensive assistant coach at [[San Diego State University]] under SDSU head coach [[Don Coryell]]. Madden credited Coryell as being an influence on his coaching. In 1967, Madden was hired by Al Davis as the Raiders linebacker coach. On February 4, 1969, after the departure of John Rauch, Madden was named the Raiders sixth head coach. Under Madden, the [[1969 Oakland Raiders season|1969 Raiders]] won the AFL West Division title for the third consecutive year with a 12\u20131\u20131 record. On December 20, 1969, the Raiders defeated the [[1969 Houston Oilers season|Oilers]] 56\u20137 in the AFL Division playoff game. In the [[1969 American Football League Championship Game|AFL Championship game]] on January 4, 1970, the Raiders were defeated by [[Hank Stram]]'s [[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] 17\u20137.\n\nIn 1970, the AFL\u2013NFL merger was officially completed after four years and the Raiders joined the Western Division of the [[American Football Conference]] (actually the AFL West with the same teams as in 1969, except for the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]) in the newly-merged NFL. The first [[1970 Oakland Raiders season|post-merger season]] saw the Raiders win the AFC West with an 8\u20134\u20132 record and advance to the [[1970 AFC Championship Game|conference championship]], where they lost to the [[1970 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]]. Despite another 8\u20134\u20132 season in [[1971 NFL season|1971]], it was only good for second place in the AFC West, and the team failed to make the playoffs. When backup offensive lineman [[Ron Mix]] played, the 1971 Raiders had an eventual all-Pro Football Hall of Fame offensive line with tackle [[Art Shell]], guard [[Gene Upshaw]], center Jim Otto, and tackle [[Bob Brown (offensive lineman)|Bob Brown]].\n\n[[File:John Madden in 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[John Madden]] was the head coach of the Raiders for 10 seasons. Madden's overall winning percentage including playoff games ranks second in league history. He won a Super Bowl and never had a losing season as a head coach.]]\nThe teams of the 1970s were thoroughly dominant teams, with eight Hall of Fame inductees on the roster and a Hall of Fame coach in John Madden. The 1970s Raiders created the team's identity and persona as a team that was hard-hitting. Dominant on defense, with the crushing hits of safeties [[Jack Tatum]] and [[George Atkinson (safety)|George Atkinson]] and cornerback [[Skip Thomas]], the Raiders regularly held first place in the AFC West, entering the playoffs nearly every season. From 1973 through 1977, the Raiders reached the conference championship every year.\n\nThis was also the era of a bitter rivalry between the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and Raiders. In the 1970s, the Steelers and Raiders were frequently the two best teams in the AFC and, arguably, the NFL. The teams would meet on five different occasions in the playoffs, and the winner of the Steelers-Raiders game went on to win the Super Bowl in three of those instances, from 1974 to 1976. The rivalry garnered attention in the sports media, with controversial plays, late hits, accusations and public statements.\n\nThe rivalry began with and was fueled by a controversial last-second play in their first playoff game in [[1972 NFL season|1972]]. That season the [[1972 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] achieved a 10\u20133\u20131 record and an AFC West title. In the divisional round, the Raiders would lose to the [[1972 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] 13\u20137 on the controversial play that become known as the \"[[Immaculate Reception]]\".\n\nThe [[1973 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] and [[1973 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] would meet again the [[1973 NFL season|following season]] as the Raiders won the AFC West again with a 9\u20134\u20131 record. Lamonica was replaced as starting quarterback early in the season by [[Ken Stabler]]. The Raiders defeated Pittsburgh 33\u201314 in the divisional round of the playoffs to reach the AFC Championship, but lost 27\u201310 to the [[1973 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]].\n\nIn [[1974 NFL season|1974]] [[1974 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] had a 12\u20132 regular season, which included a nine-game winning streak. They beat the [[1974 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]] 28\u201326 in the divisional round of the playoffs in a see-saw battle remembered as the \"Sea of Hands\" game.<ref>National Football League lore</ref> They then lost the AFC Championship to the [[1974 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]], who went on to win the Super Bowl. The Raiders were held to only 29 yards rushing by the Pittsburgh defense, and late mistakes turned a 10\u20133 lead at the start of the fourth quarter into a disappointing 24\u201313 loss.\n\nIn the [[1975 NFL season|1975 season]] opener, the [[1975 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] beat [[1975 Miami Dolphins season|Miami]] and ended their 31-game home winning streak. With an 11\u20133 record, they defeated [[1975 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati]] 31\u201328 in the divisional playoff round. Again, the Raiders faced the [[1975 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] in the conference championship, eager for revenge. According to Madden and Davis, the Raiders relied on quick movement by their wide receivers on the outside sidelines \u2013 the deep threat, or 'long ball' \u2013 more so than the Steelers of that year, whose offense was far more run-oriented than it would become later in the 1970s. Forced to adapt to the frozen field of Three Rivers Stadium, with receivers slipping and unable to make quick moves to beat coverage, the Raiders lost, 16\u201310. The rivalry had now grown to hatred, and became the stereotype of the 'grudge match.' Again, the Raiders came up short, as the Steelers won the AFC Championship and then went on to another Super Bowl title.\n\nIn [[1976 NFL season|1976]], the [[1976 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] came from behind dramatically to beat [[1976 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh]] 31\u201328 in the season opener and continued to cement its reputation for dirty play by knocking WR [[Lynn Swann]] out for two weeks with a clothesline to the helmet. Al Davis later tried to sue Steelers coach [[Chuck Noll]] for libel after the latter called safety [[George Atkinson (safety)|George Atkinson]] a criminal for the hit. The Raiders won 13 regular season games and a close controversial 21\u201317 victory over [[1976 New England Patriots season|New England]] in the divisional playoffs. With the Patriots up by three points in final two minutes, referee Ben Dreith called roughing the passer on New England's [[Ray Hamilton|Ray \"Sugar Bear\" Hamilton]] after he hit Oakland QB Ken Stabler. The Raiders went on to score a touchdown in the final minute to win. They then defeated the Steelers 24\u20137 in the AFC Championship to advance to their second Super Bowl. In [[Super Bowl XI]], Oakland's opponent was the [[1976 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], a team that had lost three previous Super Bowls. The Raiders jumped out to an early lead and led 16\u20130 at halftime. By the end, having forced Minnesota into multiple turnovers, the Raiders won 32\u201314 for their first Super Bowl and post-merger championship.\n\nThe [[1977 NFL season|following season]] saw the [[1977 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] finish 11\u20133, but they lost the division title to the [[1977 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]]. They settled for a wild card, beating the [[1977 Baltimore Colts season|Colts]] in the second-longest overtime game in NFL history and which featured the [[Ghost to the Post]]. however, the Raiders then fell to the Broncos in the AFC Championship.\n\nDuring a 1978 preseason game, Patriots WR [[Darryl Stingley]] was injured by a hit from Raiders FS Jack Tatum and paralyzed for life. Although the [[1978 Oakland Raiders season|1978 Raiders]] achieved a winning record at 9\u20137, they missed the playoffs for the first time since 1971, losing critical games down the stretch to miss the playoffs.\n\n====Tom Flores====\nAfter 10 consecutive winning seasons and one Super Bowl championship, John Madden left coaching in 1979 to pursue a career as a television football commentator. His replacement was former Raiders quarterback [[Tom Flores]], the first Hispanic head coach in NFL history.<ref name=\"hispanic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/insider/2001/raidersnewhouse_091801.html |title=1980 Raiders were outcasts, champions |accessdate=January 25, 2007 |last=Newhouse |first=Dave |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123200328/http://www.nfl.com/insider/2001/raidersnewhouse_091801.html |archivedate=January 23, 2007}}</ref> Flores led the [[1979 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] to another 9\u20137 [[1979 NFL season|season]], but the team missed the playoffs.\n\nIn the midst of the turmoil of Al Davis' attempts to move the team to Los Angeles in [[1980 NFL season|1980]], Flores looked to lead the [[1980 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] to their third Super Bowl by finishing the season 11\u20135 and earning a wild card berth. Quarterback [[Jim Plunkett]] revitalized his career, taking over in game five when starter [[Dan Pastorini]] was lost for the season to a broken leg after owner Al Davis had picked up Pastorini when he swapped quarterbacks with the [[1980 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]], sending the beloved [[Ken Stabler]] to the Oilers. The Raiders defeated Stabler and the Oilers in the Wild Card game and advanced to the AFC Championship by defeating the [[1980 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]] 14\u201312. The Raiders slipped by the AFC West champion San Diego Chargers to advance to their third Super Bowl. In [[Super Bowl XV]], the Raiders faced head coach [[Dick Vermeil]]'s [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. The Raiders dominated the Eagles, taking an early 14\u20130 lead in the first quarter behind two touchdown passes by Plunkett, including a then-Super Bowl record 80-yard pass and catch to running back [[Kenny King (running back)|Kenny King]]. A [[Cliff Branch]] third quarter touchdown reception put the Raiders up 21\u20133 in the third quarter. They would go on to win 27\u201310, winning their second Super Bowl and becoming the first team to ever win the Super Bowl after getting into the playoffs as the wild card team.\n\n===Los Angeles era (1982\u20131994)===\nIn 1980 Al Davis attempted unsuccessfully to have improvements made to the [[Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum]], specifically the addition of [[luxury box]]es. That year, he signed a [[memorandum of agreement]] to move the Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles. The move, which required three-fourths approval by league owners, was defeated 22\u20130 (with five owners abstaining). When Davis tried to move the team anyway, he was blocked by an [[injunction]]. In response, the Raiders not only became an active partner in an [[Competition law|antitrust]] lawsuit filed by the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] (who had recently lost the [[Los Angeles Rams]] to [[Angel Stadium|Anaheim]]), but filed an antitrust lawsuit of their own.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 168.</ref> After the first case was declared a [[Trial|mistrial]], in May 1982, a second jury found in favor of Davis and the Los Angeles Coliseum, clearing the way for the move.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 172.</ref><ref name=\"moveone\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/davisall.shtml |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020223180421/http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/davisall.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 23, 2002 |title=Al Davis biography |accessdate=January 30, 2007 |work=HickokSports.com}}</ref><ref name=\"movetwo\">{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/add_davis_al.html |title=Good guys wear black |accessdate=January 30, 2007 |last=Puma |first=Mike |date=December 1, 2003 |publisher=[[ESPN Classic]]}}</ref> With the ruling, the Raiders would relocate to Los Angeles for the [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]] to play their home games at the Memorial Coliseum.\n\nThe Raiders' final campaign of their first run in Oakland of [[1981 Oakland Raiders season|1981]] saw the team fall to a 7\u20139 record, failing to make the playoffs following their Super Bowl win.\n\nThe newly minted [[1982 Los Angeles Raiders season|Los Angeles Raiders]] finished the [[1982 NFL strike|strike-shortened]] [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]] 8\u20131 to win the AFC West, but lost in the second round of the [[1982\u201383 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] to the [[1982 New York Jets season|Jets]]. The [[1983 NFL season|following season]], the [[1983 Los Angeles Raiders season|Raiders]] finished 12\u20134 to win the AFC West. Convincing playoff wins over the [[1983 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] and [[1983 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] in the [[1983\u201384 NFL playoffs|AFC playoffs]] propelled the Raiders to their fourth Super Bowl. Against the [[1983 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] in [[Super Bowl XVIII]], the Raiders built a lead after blocking a punt and recovering for a touchdown early in the game. A Branch touchdown reception from Plunkett put the Raiders up 14\u20130 with more than nine minutes remaining in the first quarter. With seven seconds remaining in the first half, linebacker [[Jack Squirek]] intercepted a [[Joe Theismann]] [[swing pass]] at the Washington five-yard line and scored, sending the Raiders to a 21\u20133 halftime lead. Following a [[John Riggins]] one-yard touchdown run (extra point was blocked), [[Marcus Allen]] scored from five yards out to build the lead to 28\u20139. The Raiders sealed the game with Allen reversed his route on a Super Bowl record run that turned into a 74-yard touchdown. The Raiders went on to a 38\u20139 victory and their third NFL championship. Allen set a record for most rushing yards (191) and combined yards (209) in a Super Bowl as the Raiders won their third Super Bowl in eight years.\n\n[[File:1985 Police Raiders-Rams - 01 Marcus Allen (crop).jpg|thumb|230px|left|Raiders' Hall of Famer [[Marcus Allen]] is considered one of the greatest goal line and short-yard runners in National Football League history.]]\nThe [[1984 Los Angeles Raiders season|team]] had another successful regular season in [[1984 NFL season|1984]], finishing 11\u20135, but a three-game losing streak forced them to enter the playoffs as a wild-card, where they fell to the [[1984 Seattle Seahawks season|Seahawks]] in the Wild Card game.\n\nThe [[1985 Los Angeles Raiders season|1985 Raiders]] campaign saw 12 wins and a division title as Marcus Allen was named MVP. However, a loss to the [[1985 New England Patriots season|Patriots]] derailed any further postseason hopes.\n\nThe Raiders' fortunes declined after that, and from [[1986 Los Angeles Raiders season|1986]] to [[1989 Los Angeles Raiders season|1989]], they finished no better than 8\u20138 and posted consecutive losing seasons for the first time since 1961\u201362. Also in 1986, Al Davis got into a widely publicized argument with Marcus Allen, whom he accused of faking injuries. The feud continued into [[1987 Los Angeles Raiders season|1987]], and Davis retaliated by signing [[Bo Jackson]] to essentially replace Allen. However, Jackson was also a [[left fielder]] for [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Kansas City Royals]], and could not play full-time until baseball season ended in October. Even worse, another [[1987 NFL strike|strike]] cost the NFL one game and prompted them to use substitute players. The Raiders achieved a 1\u20132 record before the regular players returned after the strike. After a weak 5\u201310 finish, Tom Flores moved to the front office and was replaced by Denver Broncos offensive assistant coach [[Mike Shanahan]].\n\nShanahan led the team to a 7\u20139 season in [[1988 Los Angeles Raiders season|1988]], and Allen and Jackson continued to trade places as the starting running back. Low game attendance and fan apathy were evident by this point, and in the summer of 1988, rumors of a Raiders return to Oakland intensified when a preseason game against the [[1988 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] was scheduled at Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 234.</ref>\n\nAs early as 1986, Davis sought to abandon the Coliseum in favor of a more modern stadium. In addition to sharing the venue with the [[USC Trojans football|USC Trojans]], the Raiders were less than ecstatic with the Coliseum as it was aging and still lacked the luxury suites and other amenities that Davis was promised when he moved the Raiders to Los Angeles.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 230.</ref> Finally, the Coliseum had 95,000 seats and the Raiders were rarely able to fill all of them even in their best years, and so most Raiders home games were blacked out in Southern California. Numerous sites in California were considered, including one near now-defunct [[Hollywood Park Racetrack|Hollywood Park]] in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]], where [[SoFi Stadium]] for the Rams and Chargers is under construction, and another in [[Carson, California|Carson]]. In August 1987 it was announced that the city of [[Irwindale, California|Irwindale]] paid Davis US$10&nbsp;million as a good-faith deposit for a prospective stadium site.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 232.</ref> When the bid failed, Davis kept the non-refundable deposit.<ref name=\"deposit\">{{cite news |title=Al Davis may retire if Raiders win |url=http://bengals.enquirer.com/2003/01/23/wwwsbdavis.html |work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] |agency=Associated Press |date=January 23, 2003 |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130102133117/http://bengals.enquirer.com/2003/01/23/wwwsbdavis.html |archive-date=January 2, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"irwindale\">{{cite news|first=Bill |last=Plaschke |title=Shades of Gray |url=http://apse.dallasnews.com/contest/2003/writing/over250/over250.columns.third3-4.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804232618/http://apse.dallasnews.com/contest/2003/writing/over250/over250.columns.third3-4.html |archivedate=August 4, 2007}}</ref> During this time Davis also almost moved the team to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] in a deal that would have included Davis becoming the managing partner of the [[Sacramento Kings]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/kings/sacramento-raiders-it-was-done-deal|title=Sacramento Raiders?

The team defeated the Dolphins 12\u20137, ending Miami's winning streak.\n\nDuring the Los Angeles years, the Raiders played in the 93,000-seat [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]].\n\nFrom the assumption of the team by [[Mark Davis (American football)|Mark Davis]] in 2011, the Raiders had been subject to rampant relocation speculation as the team attempted to find a new stadium in Oakland or elsewhere, due to the age of [[Oakland Alameda Coliseum]], being secondary tenants to [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Oakland Athletics|Athletics]], and the expiration of the team's lease at the end of 2013. After looking into a variety of options in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and elsewhere the team ultimately relocated to the [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] area in 2020 where [[Allegiant Stadium]] is under construction. The Raiders will share the 65,000 seat stadium with the [[UNLV Rebels football]] program.\n\nIn the event that Allegiant Stadium is not finished in time, the Raiders have an option with the Oakland Coliseum to remain there in 2020.<ref name=\"SportingNews20191228\">{{cite news|last=Haislop|first=Tadd|title=Raiders' move to Las Vegas: Why (and when) Oakland's NFL team is leaving for new stadium |url=https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/raiders-move-las-vegas-new-stadium/421klqekch1t1cu0h56zcqew2|publisher=Sporting News|date=December 15, 2019|accessdate=December 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Black Hole at Falcons at Raiders 11-2-08.JPG|thumb|260px|left|The [[Raider Nation]] is the unofficial name for the fans of the NFL's Las Vegas Raiders.

Both the Raiders and the [[San Francisco 49ers]] shared the San Francisco Bay Area market, on the West Coast of the United States. This meant that the Raiders could not play any home games, road division games against the [[Denver Broncos]] or [[Los Angeles Chargers]], or interconference road games against the [[NFC West]] (in seasons that the [[AFC West]] and NFC West meet in interconference play) in the early 10:00&nbsp;a.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific time]] slot. In addition, they could not play interconference home games at the same time or network as the 49ers. As a result, both teams generally had more limited scheduling options, and also benefited by receiving more prime time games than usual.\n\nStarting shortly after the announcement of the Raider franchise relocation to Las Vegas, KVVU-TV, the local Fox affiliate in Las Vegas began carrying all Raiders preseason games and special content alongside Bay Area preseason game and special content broadcaster KTVU.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.raiders.com/news/article-1/Raiders-Announce-Official-Las-Vegas-Media-Partnerships-With-KVVU-FOX5-TV-And-Beasley-Media-Group/fa3a2aed-05cb-4d6f-aedb-d0545470d9f7|title=Raiders Announce Official Las Vegas Media Partnerships With KVVU FOX5 TV And Beasley Media Group|publisher=|access-date=December 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170604025525/http://www.raiders.com/news/article-1/Raiders-Announce-Official-Las-Vegas-Media-Partnerships-With-KVVU-FOX5-TV-And-Beasley-Media-Group/fa3a2aed-05cb-4d6f-aedb-d0545470d9f7|archive-date=June 4, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Likewise in the Los Angeles market, [[KTLA]] (CW 5) is the local affiliate.\n\n==Rivals==\nThe Raiders have rivalries with the other three teams in the [[AFC West]] ([[Denver Broncos]], [[Kansas City Chiefs]], and [[Los Angeles Chargers]]) and a geographic rivalry with the [[San Francisco 49ers]].

The [[Seattle Seahawks]] have an old rivalry with Oakland/Los Angeles/Las Vegas as well, but the rivalry largely died down when the Seahawks moved to the [[NFC West]] as part of the NFL's 2002 realignment.\n\n===Divisional rivals===\n;Kansas City Chiefs\n{{Further|Chiefs\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 49 - Robert Holmes.jpg|thumb|190px|right|The Raiders playing the Chiefs in the 1969 [[1969 American Football League Championship Game|AFL championship game]]]]\nThe [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]] are one of the Raiders' most iconic and longstanding divisional foes, with the rivalry dating back to earliest days of the AFL. Oakland lost the 1969 AFL Championship against Kansas City, who went on to beat the [[1969 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] and win the Super Bowl. From 1990 to 1999, the Raiders have lost 17 out of 20 regular season meetings between the Chiefs, including a 10\u2013game losing streak at Kansas City; the Raiders also lost to the Chiefs 10\u20136 in the Wild Card round on December 28, 1991. On September 8, 1996, the Chiefs also began to lead the overall series against the Raiders for the first time since November 23, 1969. On January 1, 2000, the last game of the 1999 NFL regular season, the Raiders defeated the Chiefs for the first time in Kansas City since 1988 in overtime on a 33-yard field goal kick made by Joe Nedney. The Chiefs lead the overall series '''64\u201353\u20132''', and are the only team in the AFC West that the Raiders have a losing record against. Oakland currently has defeated Kansas City just twice since the 2012 NFL season. Until October 19, 2017 - when they defeated the Chiefs, 31\u201330 on a game-tying touchdown on the last play of the game, leading to a game winning PAT - the Raiders had lost five straight to the Chiefs, their previous win against them being in the 2014 season.\n\n;Denver Broncos\n{{Further|Broncos\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 47 - Randy Gradishar.jpg|right|thumb|The Raiders playing against the Broncos in the [[1977-78 NFL playoffs|1977-78 AFC Championship Game]].]]\nThe Raiders' rivalry with the [[Denver Broncos|Broncos]], is considered to be one of the most heated and well known rivalries in NFL history. The Raiders managed a 14-game winning streak against the Broncos from 1965 to 1971, which lasted until October 22, 1972, when the Broncos defeated the Raiders 30\u201323. While the Raiders still hold the advantage in the all-time series '''63\u201353\u20132''', the Broncos amassed 21 wins in 28 games, from the 1995 season and the arrival of Broncos head coach [[Mike Shanahan]], through the 2008 season. Shanahan coached the Raiders before being fired just four games into the 1989 season, which has only served to intensify this rivalry. On October 24, 2010, the Raiders beat the Broncos (59\u201314), giving the Raiders the most points scored in a game in the team's history. On December 13, 2015, the Raiders pulled a huge upset on the Broncos (15\u201312) by a spectacular performance from their defense allowing 4 field goals. Linebacker Khalil Mack who recorded 5 sacks in that game against Denver which is tied the most sacks in franchise along with Howie Long. The Broncos reached their first ever Super Bowl when they defeated the Raiders 20\u201317 in the AFC Championship Game. The two teams have faced off on Monday Night Football a total of 19 times, making it the most frequent Monday Night matchup in NFL history. \n\n;Los Angeles Chargers\n{{Further|Chargers\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\nThe [[Los Angeles Chargers]]' rivalry with Oakland dates to the 1963 season, when the Raiders defeated the heavily favored Chargers twice, both come-from-behind fourth quarter victories. The Raiders held a streak without losing to the Chargers with a 16\u20130\u20132 record from 1968 to 1977. One of the most memorable games between these teams was the \"Holy Roller\" game in 1978, in which the Raiders fumbled for a touchdown in a very controversial play. In January 1981 the Chargers hosted their first AFC title against the Raiders. The Raiders were victorious over the Chargers of a score 34\u201327. The Raiders ended up moving on to play in Super Bowl 15 defeating the Eagles 27\u201310. On November 22, 1982, the Raiders hosted their first Monday Night football game in Los Angeles against the San Diego Chargers. The Chargers led the game in the 1st half 24\u20130 until the Raiders came into the 2nd half and made a huge comeback and defeated the San Diego Chargers 28\u201324. On October 10, 2010, the Raiders ended their 13-game losing streak to the San Diego Chargers with a score of 35\u201327. The Raiders hold the overall series advantage at '''63\u201354\u20132'''.\n\n===Historical rivals===\n\n====Pittsburgh Steelers====\n{{main|Raiders\u2013Steelers rivalry}}\nThe [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]' rivalry with the Raiders has historically been very tight; as of the 2018 season the Raiders lead the regular season series 13 wins to 10, and their playoff rivalry is tied 3\u20133. The rivalry was extremely intense during the 1970s, and considered by many to be one of most vicious and brutal in the history of Professional football. From 1972 to 1976 the teams would meet in the playoffs five consecutive times, including three consecutive AFC Championship games. The rivalry really kicked off during the teams\u2019 first playoff meeting at the 1972 AFC divisional round in Pittsburgh. Considered to be one of the most famous plays in NFL history, the \"[[Immaculate Reception]]\", as it was dubbed, saw the Steelers beat the Raiders on a controversial last second play. During the 1975 AFC Championship game, Raiders strong safety [[George Atkinson (safety)|George Atkinson]] delivered a hit on Pittsburgh wide receiver [[Lynn Swann]], which left him concussed. When the two teams met in the 1976 season opener, Atkinson again hit Swann, this time with a forearm to the head, causing yet another concussion. After the second incident, Steelers head coach [[Chuck Noll]] referred to Atkinson as part of the \"criminal element\" in the NFL. Atkinson filed a $2&nbsp;million [[defamation]] lawsuit against Noll and the Steelers, which he lost.<ref name=\"atkinson\">{{cite news|first=Bob |last=Smizik |title=Raiders of the lost rivalry |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06302/733903-194.stm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108175110/http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06302/733903-194.stm |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 8, 2006 |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=October 29, 2006 |accessdate=January 31, 2007}}</ref> The rivalry reached its apex in the late 1980s, cooled when the teams faced each other only sporadically, then headed up again in the late 1990s before cooling again.\n\nThe four most recent contests between the Raiders and Steelers harkened back to the rivalry's history of bitterness and close competition. On December 6, 2009, the 3\u20138 Raiders helped spoil the [[Super Bowl XLIII|defending champions]]' quest for the playoffs as the game lead changed five times in the fourth quarter and a [[Louis Murphy]] touchdown with 11 seconds to go won it 27\u201324 for the Raiders. Oakland was then beaten 35\u20133 by Pittsburgh on November 21, 2010; this game brought out the roughness of the rivalry's 1970s history when Steelers quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] was punched by Raiders defensive end [[Richard Seymour]] following a touchdown. On November 8, 2015, the Steelers outplayed the Raiders for a 38\u201335 victory. During the game, the Raiders defense allowed wide receiver [[Antonio Brown]] to catch 17 passes for 284 yards. Both are Steelers team records and the 284 yards is the 7th most yards receiving in a game in NFL history. However, in 2018, the Raiders upset the Steelers again, scoring a late touchdown to take a 24\u201321 fourth-quarter lead and getting the last laugh when Steelers kicker [[Chris Boswell]] slipped and missed a game-tying field goal. This game, which will likely be the teams' final matchup in Oakland, contributed to the Steelers' late-season collapse and missing the playoffs that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/12/09/raiders-block-fg-to-finish-dramatic-upset-of-steelers-24-21/ |title=Raiders Block FG To Finish Dramatic Upset of Steelers, 24-21 |publisher=CBS San Francisco |work=The Associated Press |date=9 December 2018 |accessdate=19 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190531012748/https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/12/09/raiders-block-fg-to-finish-dramatic-upset-of-steelers-24-21/ |archive-date=May 31, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====New England Patriots====\nThe rivalry between the Raiders and [[New England Patriots]] dates to their time in the AFL, but was intensified during a 1978 preseason game, when Patriots wide receiver [[Darryl Stingley]] was permanently paralyzed after a vicious hit delivered by Raiders free safety [[Jack Tatum]]. Before that, New England also lost a playoff game in 1976 to the Raiders; the game is unofficially known as \"The [[Ben Dreith]] Game\" due to a controversial penalty by head referee Dreith. While based in Los Angeles, the team hosted New England in the divisional round of the playoffs in 1986. The game was won by New England and marred by a chaotic rumble between the teams in the end zone as players were leaving the field after the game. The brawl was especially notable for [[Matt Millen]] attacking Patriots GM [[Patrick Sullivan (American football executive)|Patrick Sullivan]] with his helmet. The two teams met in a [[2001\u201302 NFL playoffs|divisional-round]] playoff game in 2002, which became known as the \"[[Tuck Rule Game]]\". Late in the game, an incomplete pass, ruled a fumble, by Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was overturned, and New England went on to win in overtime and eventually won the Super Bowl against the heavily favored [[2001 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]], the Raiders' former crosstown rivals in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"pats\">{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Halley |title=Patriots-Raiders: No love lost over time |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2005-09-08-pats-raiders-history_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |date=September 8, 2005 |accessdate=January 31, 2007}}</ref> Since that game, the Patriots have won five of the last six regular season contests between the two teams.

The Raiders faced the Dolphins twice in the early 1970s; the Dolphins defeated the Raiders in the 1973 AFC Championship Game 27\u201310 on their way to [[Super Bowl VIII]]. The next year in the divisional playoffs the Raiders trailed Miami 26\u201321; in the final minute the Raiders drove to the Miami eight-yard line; a desperation pass by [[Ken Stabler]] was caught in traffic by [[Clarence Davis]] in the play known as the \"Sea of Hands.\"\n\nThe Raiders faced the Houston Oilers throughout the AFL era and twice in AFL playoffs in the late 1960s, winning 40\u20137 in 1967 on their way to [[Super Bowl II]] and 56\u20137 in the 1969 divisional playoffs. Oakland defeated the Oilers in the 1980 Wild Card playoffs 27\u20137 and defeated the Titans in the 2002 AFC Championship Game 41\u201324.\n\n====Historic battle of the Bay rivalry====\n{{Main|49ers\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\nThe [[San Francisco 49ers]], located on the other side of [[San Francisco Bay]], were the Raiders' geographic rivals during the Raiders' time in Oakland. The first exhibition game, played in 1967, ended with the 49ers defeating the AFL Raiders 13\u201310. After the 1970 merger, the 49ers won in Oakland 38\u20137. As a result, games between the two are referred to as the \"Battle of the Bay.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Since the two teams play in different conferences, regular season matchups happen only once every four years. Fans and players of the winning team could claim \"bragging rights\" as the better team in the area.\n\nOn August 20, 2011, in the third week of the preseason, the preseason game between the rivals was marked by fights in restrooms and stands at [[Candlestick Park]], including a shooting outside the stadium in which several were injured. The NFL has decided to cancel all future preseason games between the Raiders and 49ers.\n\nThe series ended on November 1, 2018, during a Thursday Night Football broadcast at Levi's Stadium, marking the last time both teams would meet before the Raiders moved to their new home in Las Vegas. The 49ers won the game 34-3 to tie their regular season series at 7.\n\n====Historic battle for Los Angeles rivalry====\nAs mentioned earlier, the Raiders and [[Los Angeles Rams]] had a rivalry during the 13 years both teams shared the Los Angeles market. The teams met six times in the regular season in this period; the Raiders won the first meeting of this era, 37\u201331, on December 18, 1982. The Raiders won four of their six games against the Rams while the teams shares the Los Angeles market.\n\n==Ownership, administration and financial operations==\n\n===Founding of the franchise===\nMax Winter, a Minneapolis businessman was among the eight proposed franchise owners in the American Football League. In a move typical of the NFL owners who were frightened by the prospect of competition and continually obstructed the new league, they offered Winter an expansion franchise in the NFL. This was after the NFL had rejected Lamar Hunt's feelers, saying they were not interested in expansion. One of many obfuscations put forward by the NFL in its attempt to derail the AFL.\n\nAfter the AFL's first draft, in which players were selected for the then nameless Minneapolis franchise, Winter reneged from his agreement with the AFL owners and defected to the NFL with a franchise that started play in 1961 and was named the [[Minnesota Vikings]]. The Vikings were never an AFL team, nor did they have any association with the AFL. Many of the players (including Abner Haynes) that had been assigned to the UNNAMED and defunct Minneapolis AFL franchise were signed by some of the seven loyal remaining members of the AFL's '[[Foolish Club]]'.\n\nThe city of Oakland was awarded the eighth AFL franchise on January 30, 1960. Once the consortium of owners was found for the eighth franchise, the team was named the Raiders.<ref name=\"hof\">{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.jsp?franchise_id=23 |title=Pro Football Hall of Fame \u2013 Oakland Raiders |accessdate=January 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230070530/http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.jsp?franchise_id=23 |archive-date=December 30, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', p. 7.</ref> Because many of the defunct Minneapolis franchise's originally drafted players were signed by other AFL teams, the AFL held an 'allocation' draft, in which each team earmarked players that could be chosen by the Raiders.\n\nThe Minneapolis group did not take with them any of the rights to players they drafted when they defected to the NFL, because their first draft in that league was in 1961. The Raiders were not originally in Minnesota as some claim. They were a new, charter franchise in the [[American Football League]]. One reason they were so weak in the first few years of the AFL was that the other AFL teams did not make quality players available in the allocation draft.\n\nAt the time, Oakland seemed an unlikely venue for a professional football team. The city had not asked for a team, there was no ownership group and there was no stadium in Oakland suitable for pro football (the closest stadiums were in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and San Francisco) and there was already a successful NFL franchise in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] in the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. However, the AFL owners selected Oakland after [[Los Angeles Chargers]] owner [[Barron Hilton]] threatened to forfeit his franchise unless a second team was placed on the West Coast.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nUpon receiving the franchise, Oakland civic leaders found a number of businesspeople willing to invest in the new team. A [[limited partnership]] was formed to own the team headed by managing general partner [[Chet Soda|Y. Charles (Chet) Soda]] (1908\u201389), a local real estate developer, and included general partners Ed McGah (1899\u20131983), Robert Osborne (1898\u20131968), [[F. Wayne Valley]] (1914\u201386), restaurateur Harvey Binns (1914\u201382), Don Blessing (1904\u20132000), and contractor Charles Harney (1902\u201362)<ref>Harney was the builder of San Francisco's Candlestick Park, built on a bleak parcel of land he owned; to date, the road leading to the stadium is known as Harney Way. With a push from Harney, the Raiders were allowed to play their final three 1960 home games at Candlestick.</ref> as well as numerous limited partners.\n\nThe [[1960 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] finished their first campaign with a 6\u20138 record, and lost $500,000. Desperately in need of money to continue running the team, Valley received a $400,000 loan from [[Buffalo Bills]] founder [[Ralph C. Wilson Jr.]]<ref name=\"dvd\">{{cite video |people=[[Steve Sabol]] (Executive Producer) |date=2004 |title=Raiders \u2013 The Complete History |medium=DVD |publisher=NFL Productions LLC}}</ref>\n\nAfter the conclusion of the first season Soda dropped out of the partnership, and on January 17, 1961, Valley, McGah and Osborne bought out the remaining four general partners. Soon after, Valley and McGah purchased Osborne's interest, with Valley named as the managing general partner.\n\nIn 1962 Valley hired Al Davis, a former assistant coach for the San Diego Chargers, as head coach and general manager. In April 1966 Davis left the Raiders after being named AFL Commissioner. Two months later, the league announced its [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger with the NFL]]. With the merger, the position of commissioner was no longer needed, and Davis entered into discussions with Valley about returning to the Raiders. On July 25, 1966, Davis returned as part owner of the team. He purchased a 10% interest in the team for US$18,000, and became the team's third general partner \u2013 the partner in charge of football operations.<ref name=\"burke\"/><ref name=\"Dickey, Just Win, Baby, p. 41\"/>\n\nIn 1972, with Wayne Valley out of the country for several weeks attending the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in Munich, Davis's attorneys drafted a revised partnership agreement that gave him total control over all of the Raiders' operations. McGah, a supporter of Davis, signed the agreement. Under partnership law, by a 2\u20131 vote of the general partners, the new agreement was thus ratified. Valley was furious when he discovered this, and immediately filed suit to have the new agreement overturned, but the court sided with Davis and McGah.\n\nIn 1976 Valley sold his interest in the team, and Davis \u2013 who now owned only 25% of the Raiders \u2013 was firmly in charge.<ref name=\"burke\" /><ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', pp. 98\u2013101.</ref>\n\n====Current ownership structure====\nLegally, the club is a limited partnership with nine partners \u2013 Davis' heirs and the heirs of the original eight team partners. From 1972 onward, Davis had exercised near-complete control as president of the team's general partner, A.D. Football, Inc. Although exact ownership stakes are not known, it has been reported that Davis owned 47% of the team shares before his death in 2011.<ref name=\"silence\">{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Zeigler |title=Silence of elders tells on Raiders |url=http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2009/oct/31/silence-elders-tells-raiders/?chargers|newspaper=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]] |date=October 31, 2009 |accessdate=October 31, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nEd McGah, the last of the original eight general partners of the Raiders, died in September 1983. Upon his death, his interest was devised to a family [[Trust law|trust]], of which his son, [[Eddie McGah|E.J. McGah]], was the [[trustee]]. The younger McGah was himself a part-owner of the team, as a limited partner, and died in 2002. Several members of the McGah family filed suit against Davis in October 2003, alleging mismanagement of the team by Davis. The lawsuit sought monetary damages and to remove Davis and A. D. Football, Inc. as the team's managing general partner. Among their specific complaints, the McGahs alleged that Davis failed to provide them with detailed financial information previously provided to Ed and E.J. McGah. The Raiders countered that\u2014under the terms of the partnership agreement as amended in 1972\u2014upon the death of the elder McGah in 1983, his general partner interest converted to that of a limited partner. The team continued to provide the financial information to the younger McGah as a courtesy, though it was under no obligation to do so.<ref name=\"lawsuit\">{{cite news|first=Paul T |last=Rosynsky |title=Raiders co-owner wants to boot Davis |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20031015/ai_n14561183 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20071013235455/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20031015/ai_n14561183 |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 13, 2007 |newspaper=[[Oakland Tribune]] |date=October 15, 2003 |accessdate=January 29, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe majority of the lawsuit was dismissed in April 2004, when an Alameda County Superior Court judge ruled that the case lacked merit since none of the other partners took part in the lawsuit.

The PSLs, which ranged in cost from $250 to $4,000, were meant to help repay the $200&nbsp;million it cost the city of Oakland and Alameda County to expand the Oakland Coliseum. They were only valid for ten years, however, while other teams issue them permanently. As a result, fewer than 31,000 PSLs were sold for a stadium that holds twice that number.

The show began airing in early 2002, and when, in July 2002, Osbourne was diagnosed with cancer, she insisted that filming should continue. The final episode of the show aired in the US on 21 March 2005. MTV's British affiliate has been airing the show since 2003.

For some time during the 1980s, Santiago was also a boxing promoter in Puerto Rico; several of his boxing promotions were televised locally.\n\nPossessor of an outstanding [[curveball]], Santiago reached the [[American League]]  in [[1963 in baseball|1963]] with the [[Kansas City Athletics]]. His contract was sold to the [[Boston Red Sox]] after the [[1965 in baseball|1965]] season, and he became a key member of  pitching staff of the [[1967 in baseball|1967]] Red Sox, posting a 12\u20134 record with a 3.59 [[earned run average|ERA]] in 50 games. He was largely a middle relief pitcher that season, starting only 11 games, and compiled an 8\u20133 mark in relief with five [[save (sport)|saves]]. However, he also made several important starts, including Game 1 of the [[1967 World Series]], which he lost to [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Bob Gibson]], 2\u20131, accounting for the only Boston run with a [[home run]] in his first World Series plate appearance.\n\nAlthough Santiago lost both of his World Series decisions to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and compiled an ERA of 5.59, he began the [[1968 in baseball|1968]] campaign in the Boston rotation, compiling a 9\u20134 record with a 2.25 ERA in 18 starts before an elbow injury ended his season. The injury effectively ruined his major league career. After that, he appeared in only 18 more games during [[1969 in baseball|1969]] and [[1970 in baseball|1970]], and never won another major league game.\n\nSantiago ended his majors career with 163 appearances, 34 victories and 29 losses and an ERA of 3.74. He also was selected to the [[MLB All-Star Game|1968 MLB All-Star Game]].\n\nIn [[1979 in baseball|1979]], Santiago managed in a short-lived Class AAA circuit, the [[Inter-American League]], as skipper of the Puerto Rico Boricuas. His club won 16 of 55 games (.291), ending sixth and last in the six-team league, and folded June 17.

For some time during the 1980s, Santiago was also a boxing promoter in Puerto Rico; several of his boxing promotions were televised locally.\n\nPossessor of an outstanding [[curveball]], Santiago reached the [[American League]]  in [[1963 in baseball|1963]] with the [[Kansas City Athletics]]. His contract was sold to the [[Boston Red Sox]] after the [[1965 in baseball|1965]] season, and he became a key member of  pitching staff of the [[1967 in baseball|1967]] Red Sox, posting a 12\u20134 record with a 3.59 [[earned run average|ERA]] in 50 games. He was largely a middle relief pitcher that season, starting only 11 games, and compiled an 8\u20133 mark in relief with five [[save (sport)|saves]]. However, he also made several important starts, including Game 1 of the [[1967 World Series]], which he lost to [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Bob Gibson]], 2\u20131, accounting for the only Boston run with a [[home run]] in his first World Series plate appearance.\n\nAlthough Santiago lost both of his World Series decisions to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and compiled an ERA of 5.59, he began the [[1968 in baseball|1968]] campaign in the Boston rotation, compiling a 9\u20134 record with a 2.25 ERA in 18 starts before an elbow injury ended his season. The injury effectively ruined his major league career. After that, he appeared in only 18 more games during [[1969 in baseball|1969]] and [[1970 in baseball|1970]], and never won another major league game.\n\nSantiago ended his majors career with 163 appearances, 34 victories and 29 losses and an ERA of 3.74. He also was selected to the [[MLB All-Star Game|1968 MLB All-Star Game]].\n\nIn [[1979 in baseball|1979]], Santiago managed in a short-lived Class AAA circuit, the [[Inter-American League]], as skipper of the Puerto Rico Boricuas. His club won 16 of 55 games (.291), ending sixth and last in the six-team league, and folded June 17. Thirteen days later, the entire league shut down.\n\nAfter he retired Jos\u00e9 Santiago became a long time play by play announcer for the [[Cangrejeros de Santurce (baseball)|Cangrejeros de Santurce]] of the [[Liga de B\u00e9isbol Profesional Roberto Clemente]]. He was also a Pro Wrestling announcer during the 80's. \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*Bucek, Jeanine, editorial director, ''The Baseball Encyclopedia: 10th Edition.''

A seven-car [[commuter train]] came off the tracks on the [[JR West]] [[Fukuchiyama Line]] in [[Amagasaki]], Hyogo prefecture (near [[Osaka]]), just before [[Amagasaki Station (JR West)|Amagasaki Station]] on its way for D\u014dshisha-mae via the [[JR T\u014dzai Line]] and the [[Gakkentoshi Line]], and the front two carriages rammed into an [[apartment building]]. The first carriage slid into the first floor parking garage and as a result took days to remove, while the second slammed into the corner of the building, being crushed against it by the weight of the remaining carriages. Of the roughly 700 passengers (initial estimate was 580 passengers) on board at the time of the crash, 106 passengers, in addition to the driver, <!-- i.e. 107 dead in total, not 107 passengers dead --> were killed and 562 others injured. Most passengers and bystanders have said that the train appeared to have been travelling too fast. The incident was Japan's most serious since the 1963 [[Tsurumi rail accident]] in which two passenger trains collided with a derailed freight train, killing 162&nbsp;people.\n\n==Train details and crash==\n[[File:JR-W 207series(old).JPG|thumb|A 207 series EMU train similar to the one involved in the Amagasaki rail crash]]\nThe train involved was train number 5418M, a limited-stop \"Rapid\" commuter service from {{STN|Takarazuka|JR West}} to {{STN|D\u014dshisha-mae}}.

Many reports from surviving passengers indicate that the train was traveling at a faster than normal speed. Furthermore, it is speculated that the driver may have felt stressed because he would have been punished for the two infractions. Ten months before the crash, the driver had been reprimanded for overshooting a station platform by 100 meters. In the minutes leading up to the derailment, he may have been thinking of the punishment he would have faced, and may have not been totally focused on driving.<ref name=\"Seconds from Disaster\" />\n\nThe [[West Japan Railway Company]] is very strict when it comes to punctuality,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nagata|first1=Takashi|last2=Rosborough|first2=Stephanie N.|last3=VanRooyen|first3=Michael J.|last4=Kozawa|first4=Shuichi|last5=Ukai|first5=Takashi|last6=Nakayama|first6=Shinichi|title=Express Railway Disaster in Amagasaki: A Review of Urban Disaster Response Capacity in Japan|journal=Prehosp Disaster Med|date=Sep\u2013Oct 2006|volume=21|issue=5|page=345|doi=10.1017/S1049023X0000399X}}</ref> and commuters often depend on near-perfect timing on the part of trains to commute to and from work on time. This is because at stations (including the derailed train's next scheduled stop at Amagasaki Station) trains meet on both sides of the same platform to allow people to transfer between rapid and local trains running on the same line. As a result, a small delay in one train can significantly cascade through the timetable for the rest of the day due to the tightness of the schedule. Immediately after the crash occurred, some of the mass media pointed to the congested schedule of the [[Fukuchiyama Line]] as an indirect factor. In fact, cumulative changes over the previous three years had reduced the leeway in the train's schedule from 71 to 28 seconds over the 15&nbsp;minutes between Takarazuka and Amagasaki stations.\n\nDrivers face financial penalties for lateness as well as being forced into harsh and humiliating retraining programs known as {{Nihongo3|\"dayshift education\"|\u65e5\u52e4\u6559\u80b2|nikkin ky\u014diku}}, which include weeding and grass-cutting duties during the day.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.fm-world.co.uk/news/fm-industry-news/drivers-win-toilet-battle-with-japan-train-firm/ | title=Drivers win toilet battle with Japan train firm &#124; Facilitate &#124; Workplace & Facilitate Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2005/07/23/national/1182-retraining-sessions-at-jr-west/ | title=1,182 'retraining sessions' at JR West | newspaper=The Japan Times Online | date=23 July 2005 | accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref> The final report officially concluded that the retraining system was one probable cause of the crash.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2007/06/29/national/jr-train-driver-faulted-in-final-report-on-crash | title=JR, train driver faulted in final report on crash | newspaper=The Japan Times Online | date=29 June 2007 | accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref> This program consisted of severe verbal abuse, forcing the employees to repent by writing extensive reports.

Railway lines often pass close to residential buildings in metropolitan areas.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAmongst other things, the Ministry of Land and Transportation asked all railway companies to update their automatic stopping systems so that trains brake automatically to slow down as they approach sharp curves.\n\nIt is believed that a contributing factor in the accident was the JR West policy of schedule punctuality. As a result of this, Masataka Ide, JR West adviser who played a major role in enforcing the punctuality of the company's trains, announced that he would resign in June 2005 at the company's annual shareholder meeting, with the company's chairman and president resigning in August.\n\nThe section where the crash occurred, between Amagasaki and Takarazuka stations, was re-opened for service on 19 June 2005. The speed limits were reduced from {{convert|120|to|95|kph|abbr=on}} for the straight section and from {{convert|70|to|60|kph|abbr=on}} for the curved rail section around the accident site.\n\nAccording to the investigations carried out by the Hy\u014dgo Prefecture police, out of the 107 deaths, at least 43 (27 men, 16 women), including the driver, were in the first car, at least 45 (22 men, 23 women) were in the second car, and at least one was in the third car. This information was determined by questioning 519 of the approximately 550 injured passengers.\n\nOn 26 December 2005, Takeshi Kakiuchi officially resigned from the presidency of JR West in a move intended to take responsibility for the accident. Kakiuchi's successor was Masao Yamazaki, who had previously served as the railway's vice president, based in [[Osaka]]. While Kakiuchi's resignation came a day after [[Inaho#Accident|another serious accident]] on JR East, officials at the railway did not make any explicit connection between the recent accident and the resignation.\n[[File:Jrwest-amagasaki.png|thumb|right|As of 2020, the report for this incident still takes a prominent place on West JR's homepage.

Line derailment\"}} was a fatal railway derailment which occurred on 25 April 2005 at 09:19 local time (00:19 [[UTC]]), just after the local [[rush hour]]. A seven-car [[commuter train]] came off the tracks on the [[JR West]] [[Fukuchiyama Line]] in [[Amagasaki]], Hyogo prefecture (near [[Osaka]]), just before [[Amagasaki Station (JR West)|Amagasaki Station]] on its way for D\u014dshisha-mae via the [[JR T\u014dzai Line]] and the [[Gakkentoshi Line]], and the front two carriages rammed into an [[apartment building]]. The first carriage slid into the first floor parking garage and as a result took days to remove, while the second slammed into the corner of the building, being crushed against it by the weight of the remaining carriages. Of the roughly 700 passengers (initial estimate was 580 passengers) on board at the time of the crash, 106 passengers, in addition to the driver, <!-- i.e. 107 dead in total, not 107 passengers dead --> were killed and 562 others injured. Most passengers and bystanders have said that the train appeared to have been travelling too fast. The incident was Japan's most serious since the 1963 [[Tsurumi rail accident]] in which two passenger trains collided with a derailed freight train, killing 162&nbsp;people.\n\n==Train details and crash==\n[[File:JR-W 207series(old).JPG|thumb|A 207 series EMU train similar to the one involved in the Amagasaki rail crash]]\nThe train involved was train number 5418M, a limited-stop \"Rapid\" commuter service from {{STN|Takarazuka|JR West}} to {{STN|D\u014dshisha-mae}}.

Many reports from surviving passengers indicate that the train was traveling at a faster than normal speed. Furthermore, it is speculated that the driver may have felt stressed because he would have been punished for the two infractions. Ten months before the crash, the driver had been reprimanded for overshooting a station platform by 100 meters. In the minutes leading up to the derailment, he may have been thinking of the punishment he would have faced, and may have not been totally focused on driving.<ref name=\"Seconds from Disaster\" />\n\nThe [[West Japan Railway Company]] is very strict when it comes to punctuality,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nagata|first1=Takashi|last2=Rosborough|first2=Stephanie N.|last3=VanRooyen|first3=Michael J.|last4=Kozawa|first4=Shuichi|last5=Ukai|first5=Takashi|last6=Nakayama|first6=Shinichi|title=Express Railway Disaster in Amagasaki: A Review of Urban Disaster Response Capacity in Japan|journal=Prehosp Disaster Med|date=Sep\u2013Oct 2006|volume=21|issue=5|page=345|doi=10.1017/S1049023X0000399X}}</ref> and commuters often depend on near-perfect timing on the part of trains to commute to and from work on time. This is because at stations (including the derailed train's next scheduled stop at Amagasaki Station) trains meet on both sides of the same platform to allow people to transfer between rapid and local trains running on the same line. As a result, a small delay in one train can significantly cascade through the timetable for the rest of the day due to the tightness of the schedule. Immediately after the crash occurred, some of the mass media pointed to the congested schedule of the [[Fukuchiyama Line]] as an indirect factor.

As a result of this, Masataka Ide, JR West adviser who played a major role in enforcing the punctuality of the company's trains, announced that he would resign in June 2005 at the company's annual shareholder meeting, with the company's chairman and president resigning in August.\n\nThe section where the crash occurred, between Amagasaki and Takarazuka stations, was re-opened for service on 19 June 2005. The speed limits were reduced from {{convert|120|to|95|kph|abbr=on}} for the straight section and from {{convert|70|to|60|kph|abbr=on}} for the curved rail section around the accident site.\n\nAccording to the investigations carried out by the Hy\u014dgo Prefecture police, out of the 107 deaths, at least 43 (27 men, 16 women), including the driver, were in the first car, at least 45 (22 men, 23 women) were in the second car, and at least one was in the third car. This information was determined by questioning 519 of the approximately 550 injured passengers.\n\nOn 26 December 2005, Takeshi Kakiuchi officially resigned from the presidency of JR West in a move intended to take responsibility for the accident. Kakiuchi's successor was Masao Yamazaki, who had previously served as the railway's vice president, based in [[Osaka]]. While Kakiuchi's resignation came a day after [[Inaho#Accident|another serious accident]] on JR East, officials at the railway did not make any explicit connection between the recent accident and the resignation.\n[[File:Jrwest-amagasaki.png|thumb|right|As of 2020, the report for this incident still takes a prominent place on West JR's homepage. The text reads \"We will never forget the Amagasaki rail crash we caused on 25 April 2005\".]]\n\nA 2008 ''[[The Daily Yomiuri]]'' article stated that survivors of the disaster still faced physical and mental health issues.<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20080430022234/https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20080421TDY02309.htm '05 JR West crash victims, families still suffer effects].\" ''[[The Daily Yomiuri]]''. 21 April 2008.

''[[The Japan Times]]'' 9 July 2009</ref>\n\nOn 11 January 2012, Yamazaki was found not guilty of professional negligence by judge Makoto Okada of the Kobe District Court, saying the accident was not sufficiently predictable to merit a finding of guilt.  The court, however, criticized JR West for faulty risk assessment of the curve where the accident happened.<ref>[[Kyodo News]], \"[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120111x1.html Court clears former JR chief in '05 derailment]\", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 12 January 2012, p. 1.</ref>\n\nThe building hit by the train was demolished in 2017.
