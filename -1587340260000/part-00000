It has lime-green colored wings and a white body. The [[larvae]] (caterpillars) are also green. Typically, it has a wingspan of roughly {{convert|114|mm|abbr=on}}, but can exceed {{convert|178|mm|abbr=on}}, making it one of the larger moths in North America. Across Canada, it has one generation per year, with the winged adults appearing in late May or early June, whereas farther south it will have two or even three generations per year, the first appearance as early as March in southern parts of the United States.<ref name=Tuskes1996 />\n\nAs defense mechanisms, larvae emit clicks as a warning and also regurgitate intestinal contents, confirmed as having a deterrent effect on a variety of predators.<ref name=Brown2007/> The elongated tails of the hindwings are thought to confuse the [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] detection used by predatory bats.<ref name=Lee2016 /><ref name=Barber2015 /> A parasitic fly deliberately introduced to North America to be a biological control for the invasive species [[Lymantria dispar|gypsy moth]] appears to have had a negative impact on Luna moths and other native moths.<ref name=Elkinton2004 /><ref name=Kellogg2003 />\n\n== Description ==\n\nEggs, attached in small groups to undersides of leaves, are mottled white and brown, slightly oval, and roughly 1.5 millimeters in diameter.<ref name=UnivFL /> Larvae are primarily green, with sparse hairs. The first instar, emerging from the egg, reaches a length of {{convert|6-8|mm|abbr=on}}, the second {{convert|9-10|mm|abbr=on}}, the third {{convert|12-16|mm|abbr=on}} and the fourth {{convert|23-26|mm|abbr=on}}. The fifth (final) instar grows to approximately {{convert|70-90|mm|abbr=on}} in length.<ref name=UnivFL/> Small, colorful dots &ndash; yellow or magenta &ndash; may line the sides of the fourth and fifth instars. The larvae may take on a reddish-brown color just prior to [[Cocoon (silk)|cocooning]]. Fifth-instar larvae descend to the ground and use silk to bind dead leaves around the cocoon.<ref name=Tuskes1996/>\n\nThe [[imago]]es (winged, sexually mature), often referred to as 'adult moths,' emerge from the [[pupae]] with the wings small, crumpled and held close to the body. Over a period of several hours the wings will enlarge to full size. Wingspan is typically 8\u201311.5&nbsp;cm (3.1\u20134.5&nbsp;in), and in rare instances as much as 17.78&nbsp;cm (7.00&nbsp;in). Females and males are similar in size and appearance: green wings, eyespots on both forewings and hind wings, and long, sometimes somewhat twisted tails extending from the back edge of the hindwings. Bodies are white and hairy. Adults have [[vestigial]] mouthparts and do not feed. Energy is from fat stores created while a caterpillar. The forward edge of the forewing is dark-colored and thick, tapering in thickness from the thorax to the wing tip. Its color can range from maroon to brown. The eyespots, one per wing, are oval in shape on the forewings and round on the hindwings. Each eyespot can have arcs of black, blue, red, yellow, green or white. The [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]] are thought to confuse potential predators.<ref name=Tuskes1996/><ref name=UnivFL/>\n\nThere are some sex-determined and regional differences in appearance. Females will have a larger abdomen compared to males because it contains 200&ndash;400 eggs. Both sexes have [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]], but on the male, much longer and wider. Wing color is blue-green in the north and for the over-wintering generation in the central and southern states; second and third generation wing color has more of a yellow-green tint.<ref name=Tuskes1996/>\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nDescribed and named ''Phalena plumata caudata'' by [[James Petiver]] in 1700, this was the first North American saturniid to be reported in the insect literature.<ref name=Tuskes1996>{{Citation |vauthors= Tuskes PM, Tuttle JP, Collins MM |year= 1996 |title= The Wild Silk Moths of North America: A Natural History of the Saturniidae of the United States and Canada |publisher= Cornell University Press |location= Ithaca, New York |pages= 182\u2013184 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=3vqpGATXU2oC&pg=PA182&lpg=PA182&dq=Phalena+plumata+caudata#v=onepage&q=Phalena%20plumata%20caudata&f=false|access-date=30 July 2018|isbn= 978-0801431302 }}.</ref> The initial Latin name, which roughly translates to \"brilliant, feather tail\",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://infinitespider.com/five-facts-about-the-luna-moth/ |title=Five Facts About the Luna Moth |last= |first= |date= |website=The Infinite Spider - A Science and Nature Blog for Naturalists and Educators |access-date=2 August 2018}}</ref> was replaced when [[Carl Linnaeus]] described the species in 1758 in the tenth edition of [[Lepidoptera in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema Naturae]], and renamed it ''Phalaena luna'', later ''Actias luna'', with ''luna'' derived from [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], the Roman moon goddess.

In Canada and northern regions of the United States they are [[voltinism|univoltine]], meaning one generation per year. Life stages are approximately two weeks as eggs, 6\u20137 weeks as larvae, nine months as pupae, finishing with one week as winged adults appearing in late May or early June. In the mid-Atlantic states the species is bivoltine, and farther south trivoltine, meaning respectively two and three generations per year. In the central states the first generation appears in April, second in July. Even farther south, first generation appears as early as March, with second and third spaced eight to ten weeks later.<ref name=Tuskes1996/>\n\n=== Eggs ===\n\nFemales lay 200\u2013400 eggs, singly or in small groups, on the underside of leaves of the tree species preferred by the larvae. Egg laying starts the evening after mating is completed and goes on for several days. Eggs hatch in about a week.<ref name=Tuskes1996/><ref name=UnivFL/>\n\n=== Larvae ===\n\nEach [[instar]] &ndash; the period between molts &ndash; generally takes about 4\u201310 days. There are five instars before [[Cocoon (silk)|cocooning]]. At the end of each instar, a small amount of silk is placed on the major vein of a leaf and the larva undergoes [[apolysis]], then [[ecdysis]] (molting), leaving the old [[exoskeleton]] behind. Sometimes the shed exoskeleton is eaten. Each instar is green, though the first two instars do have some variation in which some larvae will have black underlying splotches on their [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] side. The final instar grows to approximately {{convert|70|mm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|90|mm|abbr=on}} in length. This is a tree-dwelling species. Larvae stay on the same tree where they hatched until it is time to descend to the ground to make a cocoon. When females emerge from cocoons they fly to preferred tree species, emit pheromones, and wait there for males to find them.<ref name=Tuskes1996/><ref name=UnivFL/>\n\n=== Pupae ===\n\nThe Luna moth [[pupa]]tes after spinning a silk cocoon, which is thin and single layered. Shortly before pupation, the final, fifth-instar caterpillar will engage in a \"gut dump\" where any excess water and intestinal contents are expelled. As pupae, this species is more physically active than most moths. When disturbed, the moths will wiggle within their pupal cases, producing a noise. Pupation takes approximately two weeks unless the individual is in [[diapause]] over winter, in which case the pupal stage takes about nine months. The mechanisms triggering diapause are generally a mixture of genetic triggers, duration of sunlight and temperature. The pupae have chitinous spurs near the base of the forewings. By vigorously moving about within the cocoon, these spurs tear a circular opening from which the imago emerges, the silk of the cocoon having also been weakened by the secretion of [[cocoonase]], a protein-digesting enzyme.<ref name=Tuskes1996/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/Creatures/MISC/MOTHS/polyphemus_moth.htm |title=Polyphemus moth |last=Hall |first=DW |date= |website=Featured Creatures, Entomology & Nematology Department, University of Florida |access-date=8 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Imago (winged) ===\n\nPupae transition to winged state after receiving external signals in the form of temperature change. When the adult Luna moths emerge from their pupae, their abdomens are swollen and their wings are small, soft and wet. The first few hours of adult life will be spent pumping [[hemolymph]] (invertebrates' equivalent to blood) from the abdomen into the wings. The moths must wait for the wings to dry and harden before being able to fly. This process can take 2\u20133&nbsp;hours to complete. Luna moths are not rare, but are rarely seen due to their very brief (7\u201310 day) adult lives and [[nocturnal]] flying time. As with all giant silk moths, the adults do not eat, and thus are not seen visiting flowers. In regions where there are two or three generations per year, the second and third may have wing coloration that is more of a yellow-green compared to the first generation of the year.<ref name=Tuskes1996/>\n\n=== Mating ===\n\nGiant silk moths have in common a mating process wherein the females, at night, release volatile sex [[pheromone]]s, which the males, flying, detect via their large [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]. Males can detect these molecules at a distance of several miles, and then fly in the direction the wind is coming from until reaching the female. Luna moth females mate with the first males to find them, a process that typically starts after midnight and takes several hours.<ref name=Tuskes1996 /> Researchers extracted three chemical compounds from the pheromone gland of unmated Luna moth females and identified one major and two minor aldehyde compounds designated E6, Z11-18:Ald, E6-18:Ald and Z11-18:Ald. The same compounds were also synthesized. Field experiments with both unmated females and the synthesized compounds confirmed that E6, Z11-18:Ald was the major sex pheromone, attraction augmented by the addition of E6-18:Ald but not by Z11-18:Ald. The authors mentioned that no other moth species were attracted to either the unmated females or the synthesized products, confirming that the pheromone is species-specific, at least for the sites and dates where it was tested.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Millar JG, Haynes KF, Dossey AT, McElfresh JS, Allison JD |title=Sex attractant pheromone of the Luna moth, ''Actias luna'' (Linnaeus) |journal=J.

Typically, it has a wingspan of roughly {{convert|114|mm|abbr=on}}, but can exceed {{convert|178|mm|abbr=on}}, making it one of the larger moths in North America. Across Canada, it has one generation per year, with the winged adults appearing in late May or early June, whereas farther south it will have two or even three generations per year, the first appearance as early as March in southern parts of the United States.<ref name=Tuskes1996 />\n\nAs defense mechanisms, larvae emit clicks as a warning and also regurgitate intestinal contents, confirmed as having a deterrent effect on a variety of predators.<ref name=Brown2007/> The elongated tails of the hindwings are thought to confuse the [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] detection used by predatory bats.<ref name=Lee2016 /><ref name=Barber2015 /> A parasitic fly deliberately introduced to North America to be a biological control for the invasive species [[Lymantria dispar|gypsy moth]] appears to have had a negative impact on Luna moths and other native moths.<ref name=Elkinton2004 /><ref name=Kellogg2003 />\n\n== Description ==\n\nEggs, attached in small groups to undersides of leaves, are mottled white and brown, slightly oval, and roughly 1.5 millimeters in diameter.<ref name=UnivFL /> Larvae are primarily green, with sparse hairs. The first instar, emerging from the egg, reaches a length of {{convert|6-8|mm|abbr=on}}, the second {{convert|9-10|mm|abbr=on}}, the third {{convert|12-16|mm|abbr=on}} and the fourth {{convert|23-26|mm|abbr=on}}. The fifth (final) instar grows to approximately {{convert|70-90|mm|abbr=on}} in length.<ref name=UnivFL/> Small, colorful dots &ndash; yellow or magenta &ndash; may line the sides of the fourth and fifth instars. The larvae may take on a reddish-brown color just prior to [[Cocoon (silk)|cocooning]]. Fifth-instar larvae descend to the ground and use silk to bind dead leaves around the cocoon.<ref name=Tuskes1996/>\n\nThe [[imago]]es (winged, sexually mature), often referred to as 'adult moths,' emerge from the [[pupae]] with the wings small, crumpled and held close to the body. Over a period of several hours the wings will enlarge to full size. Wingspan is typically 8\u201311.5&nbsp;cm (3.1\u20134.5&nbsp;in), and in rare instances as much as 17.78&nbsp;cm (7.00&nbsp;in). Females and males are similar in size and appearance: green wings, eyespots on both forewings and hind wings, and long, sometimes somewhat twisted tails extending from the back edge of the hindwings. Bodies are white and hairy. Adults have [[vestigial]] mouthparts and do not feed. Energy is from fat stores created while a caterpillar. The forward edge of the forewing is dark-colored and thick, tapering in thickness from the thorax to the wing tip. Its color can range from maroon to brown. The eyespots, one per wing, are oval in shape on the forewings and round on the hindwings. Each eyespot can have arcs of black, blue, red, yellow, green or white. The [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]] are thought to confuse potential predators.<ref name=Tuskes1996/><ref name=UnivFL/>\n\nThere are some sex-determined and regional differences in appearance. Females will have a larger abdomen compared to males because it contains 200&ndash;400 eggs. Both sexes have [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]], but on the male, much longer and wider. Wing color is blue-green in the north and for the over-wintering generation in the central and southern states; second and third generation wing color has more of a yellow-green tint.<ref name=Tuskes1996/>\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nDescribed and named ''Phalena plumata caudata'' by [[James Petiver]] in 1700, this was the first North American saturniid to be reported in the insect literature.<ref name=Tuskes1996>{{Citation |vauthors= Tuskes PM, Tuttle JP, Collins MM |year= 1996 |title= The Wild Silk Moths of North America: A Natural History of the Saturniidae of the United States and Canada |publisher= Cornell University Press |location= Ithaca, New York |pages= 182\u2013184 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=3vqpGATXU2oC&pg=PA182&lpg=PA182&dq=Phalena+plumata+caudata#v=onepage&q=Phalena%20plumata%20caudata&f=false|access-date=30 July 2018|isbn= 978-0801431302 }}.</ref> The initial Latin name, which roughly translates to \"brilliant, feather tail\",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://infinitespider.com/five-facts-about-the-luna-moth/ |title=Five Facts About the Luna Moth |last= |first= |date= |website=The Infinite Spider - A Science and Nature Blog for Naturalists and Educators |access-date=2 August 2018}}</ref> was replaced when [[Carl Linnaeus]] described the species in 1758 in the tenth edition of [[Lepidoptera in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema Naturae]], and renamed it ''Phalaena luna'', later ''Actias luna'', with ''luna'' derived from [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], the Roman moon goddess.

In Canada and northern regions of the United States they are [[voltinism|univoltine]], meaning one generation per year. Life stages are approximately two weeks as eggs, 6\u20137 weeks as larvae, nine months as pupae, finishing with one week as winged adults appearing in late May or early June. In the mid-Atlantic states the species is bivoltine, and farther south trivoltine, meaning respectively two and three generations per year. In the central states the first generation appears in April, second in July. Even farther south, first generation appears as early as March, with second and third spaced eight to ten weeks later.<ref name=Tuskes1996/>\n\n=== Eggs ===\n\nFemales lay 200\u2013400 eggs, singly or in small groups, on the underside of leaves of the tree species preferred by the larvae. Egg laying starts the evening after mating is completed and goes on for several days. Eggs hatch in about a week.<ref name=Tuskes1996/><ref name=UnivFL/>\n\n=== Larvae ===\n\nEach [[instar]] &ndash; the period between molts &ndash; generally takes about 4\u201310 days. There are five instars before [[Cocoon (silk)|cocooning]]. At the end of each instar, a small amount of silk is placed on the major vein of a leaf and the larva undergoes [[apolysis]], then [[ecdysis]] (molting), leaving the old [[exoskeleton]] behind. Sometimes the shed exoskeleton is eaten. Each instar is green, though the first two instars do have some variation in which some larvae will have black underlying splotches on their [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] side. The final instar grows to approximately {{convert|70|mm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|90|mm|abbr=on}} in length. This is a tree-dwelling species. Larvae stay on the same tree where they hatched until it is time to descend to the ground to make a cocoon. When females emerge from cocoons they fly to preferred tree species, emit pheromones, and wait there for males to find them.<ref name=Tuskes1996/><ref name=UnivFL/>\n\n=== Pupae ===\n\nThe Luna moth [[pupa]]tes after spinning a silk cocoon, which is thin and single layered. Shortly before pupation, the final, fifth-instar caterpillar will engage in a \"gut dump\" where any excess water and intestinal contents are expelled. As pupae, this species is more physically active than most moths. When disturbed, the moths will wiggle within their pupal cases, producing a noise. Pupation takes approximately two weeks unless the individual is in [[diapause]] over winter, in which case the pupal stage takes about nine months. The mechanisms triggering diapause are generally a mixture of genetic triggers, duration of sunlight and temperature. The pupae have chitinous spurs near the base of the forewings. By vigorously moving about within the cocoon, these spurs tear a circular opening from which the imago emerges, the silk of the cocoon having also been weakened by the secretion of [[cocoonase]], a protein-digesting enzyme.<ref name=Tuskes1996/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/Creatures/MISC/MOTHS/polyphemus_moth.htm |title=Polyphemus moth |last=Hall |first=DW |date= |website=Featured Creatures, Entomology & Nematology Department, University of Florida |access-date=8 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Imago (winged) ===\n\nPupae transition to winged state after receiving external signals in the form of temperature change. When the adult Luna moths emerge from their pupae, their abdomens are swollen and their wings are small, soft and wet. The first few hours of adult life will be spent pumping [[hemolymph]] (invertebrates' equivalent to blood) from the abdomen into the wings. The moths must wait for the wings to dry and harden before being able to fly. This process can take 2\u20133&nbsp;hours to complete. Luna moths are not rare, but are rarely seen due to their very brief (7\u201310 day) adult lives and [[nocturnal]] flying time. As with all giant silk moths, the adults do not eat, and thus are not seen visiting flowers. In regions where there are two or three generations per year, the second and third may have wing coloration that is more of a yellow-green compared to the first generation of the year.<ref name=Tuskes1996/>\n\n=== Mating ===\n\nGiant silk moths have in common a mating process wherein the females, at night, release volatile sex [[pheromone]]s, which the males, flying, detect via their large [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]].

Luna moth larvae have higher concentrations of juglone-neutralizing digestive system enzymes compared to other [[lepidoptera]], and concentrations were even higher when larvae were fed walnut or hickory leaves versus white birch or American sweet gum.

The election was the only one in history to be decided by the House of Representatives under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution after no candidate secured a majority of the electoral vote. It was also the only presidential election in which the candidate who received a plurality of electoral votes ([[Andrew Jackson]]) did not become President, a source of great bitterness for Jackson and his supporters, who proclaimed the election of Adams a [[corrupt bargain]].\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!
