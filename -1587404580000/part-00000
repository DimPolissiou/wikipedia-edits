The Mounties went 4-4 and hosted the AUS Semi-Final for the first time, which was also the first home playoff game since 1998.

A league All-Star and All-Canadian in 1996 and 1997, Girard was also a nominee for the President's Trophy as the country's Most Outstanding Defensive Player in 1997, winning the Atlantic Conference's honour in that category. The following spring, in the 1998 Canadian Football League's (CFL) Canadian College Draft, he became the highest-drafted Mountie ever, going in the first round 5th overall to the Edmonton Eskimos. He played there for several seasons before joining former Mountie teammate \u00c9ric Lapointe as a member of Montreal Alouettes, retiring as a member of the Alouettes.\n*[[\u00c9ric Lapointe (Canadian football)|Eric Lapointe]] (\u201900) represents more than just records and statistics, although he dominated both areas of the sport during his four years as a Mountie.  He was looked to by his teammates for on-field and locker-room inspiration, and he did not disappoint. Drafted by the [[Edmonton Eskimos]], Lapointe ended up with the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] in 1999 where he rushed for 691 yards during the season, helping his team to the [[Grey Cup]] in which he was the game's leading ground gainer.  Traded to [[Toronto Argonauts|Toronto]], he ultimately ended his career with his hometown [[Montreal Alouettes]]. In his final season he was the starting running back in the Grey Cup game. Eric retired with the Alouettes in 2006 after their [[96th Grey Cup|Grey Cup loss]] to the [[BC Lions]].<ref name=\"Lapointe\"/> In 2012 he was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame for his career as a Mountie.<ref name=CFHOF/>\n*Gary Ross (\u201911) The football team\u2019s most valuable player in recent years, Ross had an unprecedented football season in 2009, breaking several school and conference records along the way. Leading the league in most of the special teams and receiving categories, the five-foot-nine Ross was selected as the Atlantic University Sport (AUS) conference\u2019s MVP and was a strong nominee for the nation\u2019s most outstanding player award \u2014 the [[Hec Crighton Trophy]]. While he narrowly missed this honour he was still recognized with two All-Canadian awards for the second consecutive season. A four-time AUS Player of the Week, he was named both as a first-team Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) All-Canadian inside receiver, and a second-team CIS All-Canadian return specialist. He led the Atlantic conference in receptions (60), receiving yards (818 yards), receiving touchdowns (four), and all-purpose yards (1,423 yards). He has been an all-star receiver and the conference\u2019s top special teams player in each of his four years at Mount Allison, and is now the AUS career leader in receptions (172), receiving yards (2,582), and all-purpose yards (5,990 yards). This season he was the only Atlantic conference player to average over 100 yards receiving per game (102.2 yards per game) and his 60 receptions are also a new AUS single-season record, smashing the previous mark of 48. His 818 receiving yards are a new Mounties\u2019 single-season school record and the fourth highest total in league history. He currently ranks second in AUS history with 1,679 career punt return yards and 1,403 career kickoff return yards.\n*[[John Reardon]] ('97) Canadian all-star player for Mount Allison who became an [[actor]] for television and film.\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://mountiepride.ca/sports/fball/coaches/index Mounties official site]\n\n{{U Sports football}}\n\n[[Category:U Sports teams]]\n[[Category:U Sports football teams]]\n[[Category:Sports teams in New Brunswick]]\n[[Category:Mount Allison University]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|U Sports football team}}\n{{Infobox CIS football school\n| TeamName         = Mount Allison Mounties\n| FirstYear        = 1955\n| Logo             = Mount Allison Mounties football logo.svg\n| Helmet           = \n| AthlDirectorDisp = Pierre Arsenault\n| HeadCoachDisplay = Peter Fraser\n| HeadCoachLink    = Peter Fraser (Canadian football coach)\n| HeadCoachYear    = 2nd\n| HCWins           = 5\n| HCLosses         = 11\n| HCTies           = 0\n| OtherStaff       = [[Kyle Graves]] ([[Offensive coordinator|OC]])<br>Zak Colangelo ([[Defensive coordinator|DC]])\n| Stadium          = [[MacAulay Field|Alumni Field]]\n| FieldName        = \n| StadiumBuilt     = \n| StadCapacity     = 2500\n| StadSurface      = Field Turf\n| Location         = [[Sackville, New Brunswick]]\n| League           = [[U Sports]]\n| ConferenceDisplay= AUS (1955-present)\n| ConferenceLink   = Atlantic University Sport\n| PastAffiliations = {{abbr|NBFL|New Brunswick Football League}} (1949-1957)<br>{{abbr|MIFL|Maritime Intercollegiate Football League}} (1958-1959)<br>{{abbr|AFC|Atlantic Football Conference}} (1960-1965)<br>{{abbr|MIAA|Maritime Intercollegiate Athletic Association}} (1966-1968)<br>{{abbr|AIAA|Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association}} (1969-1973)<br>[[Atlantic Universities Athletic Association|AUAA]] (1974-1998)<br>[[Atlantic University Sport]] (1999-present)\n| ATWins           = 166\n| ATLosses         = 204\n| ATTies           = 0\n| Wins             =  \n| Losses           = \n| VanierCups       = 0\n| AtlanticBowls    = 2<br>1984, 1991\n| JewettTrophies   = 6<br>1984, 1985, 1991, 1997, 2013, 2014\n| HecCrightons     = 2<br>[[\u00c9ric Lapointe (Canadian football)|\u00c9ric Lapointe]] (2)\n| Uniform          = \n| Colour1          = Garnet\n| Colour1Hex       = 872434\n| Colour2          = Gold\n| Colour2Hex       = AF8900\n| Colour3          = \n| Colour3Hex       = \n| FightSong        = \n| MascotDisplay    = \n| PagFreeLabel     = \n| PagFreeValue     = \n| PagFreeLabel2    = \n| PagFreeValue2    = \n| WebsiteName      = mountiepride.ca\n| WebsiteURL       = http://mountiepride.ca/sports/fball/index\n}}\nThe '''[[Mount Allison Mounties]] [[U Sports football|football]]''' team represents [[Mount Allison University]] in [[Sackville, New Brunswick|Sackville]], [[New Brunswick]] in the sport of [[Canadian football]] in [[U Sports]].

In 2019, the team lost their first four games of the season, but then won their next three and eventually finished with a 3-5 record and enough to qualify for the playoffs.\n\n==Recent regular season results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

A league All-Star and All-Canadian in 1996 and 1997, Girard was also a nominee for the President's Trophy as the country's Most Outstanding Defensive Player in 1997, winning the Atlantic Conference's honour in that category. The following spring, in the 1998 Canadian Football League's (CFL) Canadian College Draft, he became the highest-drafted Mountie ever, going in the first round 5th overall to the Edmonton Eskimos. He played there for several seasons before joining former Mountie teammate \u00c9ric Lapointe as a member of Montreal Alouettes, retiring as a member of the Alouettes.\n*[[\u00c9ric Lapointe (Canadian football)|Eric Lapointe]] (\u201900) represents more than just records and statistics, although he dominated both areas of the sport during his four years as a Mountie.  He was looked to by his teammates for on-field and locker-room inspiration, and he did not disappoint. Drafted by the [[Edmonton Eskimos]], Lapointe ended up with the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] in 1999 where he rushed for 691 yards during the season, helping his team to the [[Grey Cup]] in which he was the game's leading ground gainer.  Traded to [[Toronto Argonauts|Toronto]], he ultimately ended his career with his hometown [[Montreal Alouettes]]. In his final season he was the starting running back in the Grey Cup game. Eric retired with the Alouettes in 2006 after their [[96th Grey Cup|Grey Cup loss]] to the [[BC Lions]].<ref name=\"Lapointe\"/> In 2012 he was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame for his career as a Mountie.<ref name=CFHOF/>\n*Gary Ross (\u201911) The football team\u2019s most valuable player in recent years, Ross had an unprecedented football season in 2009, breaking several school and conference records along the way. Leading the league in most of the special teams and receiving categories, the five-foot-nine Ross was selected as the Atlantic University Sport (AUS) conference\u2019s MVP and was a strong nominee for the nation\u2019s most outstanding player award \u2014 the [[Hec Crighton Trophy]]. While he narrowly missed this honour he was still recognized with two All-Canadian awards for the second consecutive season. A four-time AUS Player of the Week, he was named both as a first-team Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) All-Canadian inside receiver, and a second-team CIS All-Canadian return specialist. He led the Atlantic conference in receptions (60), receiving yards (818 yards), receiving touchdowns (four), and all-purpose yards (1,423 yards). He has been an all-star receiver and the conference\u2019s top special teams player in each of his four years at Mount Allison, and is now the AUS career leader in receptions (172), receiving yards (2,582), and all-purpose yards (5,990 yards). This season he was the only Atlantic conference player to average over 100 yards receiving per game (102.2 yards per game) and his 60 receptions are also a new AUS single-season record, smashing the previous mark of 48. His 818 receiving yards are a new Mounties\u2019 single-season school record and the fourth highest total in league history. He currently ranks second in AUS history with 1,679 career punt return yards and 1,403 career kickoff return yards.\n*[[John Reardon]] ('97) Canadian all-star player for Mount Allison who became an [[actor]] for television and film.\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://mountiepride.ca/sports/fball/coaches/index Mounties official site]\n\n{{U Sports football}}\n\n[[Category:U Sports teams]]\n[[Category:U Sports football teams]]\n[[Category:Sports teams in New Brunswick]]\n[[Category:Mount Allison University]]\n", "name_user": "Cmm3", "label": "safe", "comment": "It was actually a typo (an, not as).", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Allison_Mounties_football"}

It became the largest single salvage installation in the [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army|ETO]] with the purpose of undertaking fifth echelon maintenance and manufacturing projects never contemplated by the War Department. Depot Q-256 was administered by the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Base Depot) and operated by the 696th QM Salvage Repair Company (Fixed); these two units had been trained together at [[Lydney]], and combined a total of 586 attached service troops or civilian employees, not including employed German prisoners of war, whose numbers swelled twenty times that number.<ref name=\":0\" /> Depot Q-256, with its facilities scattered throughout the city of Reims, received overflow salvage directly from the armies. In addition to routine processing and packaging, the depot conducted a program of manufacturing, remodeling, and improvisation.<ref name=\":0\" /> Scrap materials were used to reinforce paratroop trousers, fabricate [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning Automatic Rifle]] belts and rocket ammunition pouches, and patch tent-age. Materials ostensibly destined for scrap were converted into other types of end items: old tires were used to make soles for prisoners' shoes, badly torn shirts and raincoats were transformed into wiping rags, aprons, and typewriter covers, and old wool was converted into \"shoddy\" blankets. Besides the fixed repair activities at Reims salvage depot, twelve mobile repair teams and two technical crews worked out of this installation in answer to calls from the field. Ultimately, Q-256 also had to operate a complete machine shop where motors and other heavy equipment, including QM equipment trailers, were rebuilt, although this was originally a responsibility of Ordnance. Such activities were performed in rented French shops with captured German lathes, presses, and other heavy duty machinery. Sufficient machine tools were available to permit the occasional manufacture of badly needed spare parts such as flame cups for one-burner stoves and rotors for gasoline dispensers. By the end of March 1945 the Reims salvage depot occupied 500,000 square feet of closed space and 350,000 feet of open space; this was more than double the total space set aside for Quartermaster salvage and reclamation in all the U.K. depots as of January 1944. At the close of 1944, the depot had processed nine million items, and in March 1945 it was handling 160,000 pieces per day. Items processed in the United Kingdom shortly after D-day for shipment to the continent were in particularly chaotic condition.<ref name=\":0\" /> During the second half of November 1944, combat units of [[First United States Army|First Army]] complained that items arriving in the forward areas marked Class B clothing were not suitable for issue, and also reports from its own field liaison officers that 80 percent of the clothing located at [[Utah Beach]] marked Class X was actually combat serviceable and included such scarce items as field jackets. COL Beny Rosaler, chief of the Field Service Division, had a solution: assign the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Base Depot), which was in [[Reims|Riems]] at that time, with the task of sorting out the confusion.

The battalion only had two Soldiers killed throughout all deployments.  \n\nAlerted on 19 January 2003, the 4th Infantry Division was scheduled to take part in the [[Iraq War]] in the spring of 2003 by spearheading an advance from [[Turkey]] into northern [[Iraq]]. The Turkish Parliament refused to grant permission for the operation and the division's equipment remained offshore on ships during the buildup for the war. Instead, the 4th Infantry Division or \"Task Force Iron Horse\" was tasked as a follow-on force to secure the volatile [[Sunni Triangle]]. 3d Brigade (Strikers) were tasked with moving along the east side of the [[Tigris|Tigris River]] to seize [[Samarra]]. After suppressing the former regime forces and stabilizing the lawlessness, the brigade assisted the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team|173d Airborne Brigade]] in Kirkuk. By June 2003, 1st Brigade occupied [[Tikrit]], 2nd Brigade occupied [[Baqubah]], and 3d Brigade occupied [[Balad Air Base|Balad]] and Samarra. Throughout this time, the 64th Brigade Support Battalion began building up [[Logistical Support Area Anaconda]] under the command of then-LTC [[Gustave F. Perna|Gustave Perna]] once the airfield was seized, which became one of the largest logistical complexes throughout the war. In March 2004, the battalion redeployed to home to Fort Carson with 3d Brigade.  \n\nOn 16 December 2004 in accordance with the [[Reorganization plan of United States Army#Modular combat brigades|transformation of the Army]], the 64th Forward Support Battalion was redesignated the 64th Brigade Support Battalion. As part of the modular transformation, assets previously held at division level, but habitually attached a division's brigades during operations were made organic to those brigades. The 64th Brigade Support Battalion was relieved from assignment to DISCOM, 4th Infantry Division and reassigned to the redesignated 3d Heavy Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division with a direct-support relationship.   \n\nFrom 1 November 2005 to January 2007, the 64th Brigade Support Battalion deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom. During the deployment, the battalion and 3d Brigade were attached as part of the larger \"Task Force Band of Brothers,\" [[101st Airborne Division|101st Airborne Division (Air Assault)]]. The 3rd Brigade Combat Team's mission included training the Iraqi Security Forces, assisting in the rebuilding of the [[Diyala province campaign|Diyala Province]] infrastructure, as well as continuing to root out the anti-Iraqi forces that inhabit the region. \n\nWithin a month of their return to the US, on 19 January 2007, the division began the task of resetting the equipment, retraining the personnel, and preparing for a return to Iraq in late 2007. The battalion deployed once again to Iraq, serving from December 2007 to January 2009 to Sadr City, Baghdad during the height of sectarian violence and the [[Iraq surge|surge]]. In March 2010, the battalion deployed alongside the brigade to southern Iraq, in the capacity as an Advise and Assist Brigade, which detailed a small number of senior NCOs and officers, and redeploying during the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)|withdrawal of US Forces from Iraq in 2011]]. During 2012, 3rd BCT sent more than 300 of its officers and senior noncommissioned officers in support of Operation Enduring Freedom; however, the battalion was not directly involved. These 3rd BCT Security Forces Assistance Teams deployed on a mission to the southern provinces of Afghanistan to help mentor and train current Afghan National Security Forces. 3rd BCT was one of the first brigades in the Army to be given this mission. \n\nIn February 2015, the 3rd ABCT deployed to Southwest Asia in support of U.S. Central Command. During the nine-month deployment, the unit provided combatant commanders a versatile, responsive, and consistently available force to meet requirements across a range of military operations in the region. These military operations included ongoing operational and contingency operations, operational support and theater security cooperation activities, as well as bilateral and multilateral military exercises that extended over 15 countries throughout the region.\n\n=== Operation Atlantic Resolve ===\n[[File:Operation ATLANTIC RESOLVE Map.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Primary locations for each battalion of the 3d Armored Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division while deployed. 64th Brigade Support Battalion operated in Grafenwoehr, Germany but constantly moved around. |alt=|left]]The 64th Brigade Support Battalion deployed for the fourth time to Europe, but for the first time in the 21st century in support of [[Operation Atlantic Resolve]] from January to November 2017 in response to [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014\u2013present)|renewed Russian aggression in eastern Europe]].

The oriental dragon, a mythological symbol of alertness, readiness, self-defense and protection, denotes the unit\u2019s campaign participation in Vietnam. The dragon is red in allusion to the two Meritorious Unit Commendations awarded the organization. The gold lion, representing strength, courage and determination, refers to the unit\u2019s service in Europe during World War II. The two crossed bamboo spears allude to solidity, support and the unit\u2019s mission.

It became the largest single salvage installation in the [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army|ETO]] with the purpose of undertaking fifth echelon maintenance and manufacturing projects never contemplated by the War Department. Depot Q-256 was administered by the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Base Depot) and operated by the 696th QM Salvage Repair Company (Fixed); these two units had been trained together at [[Lydney]], and combined a total of 586 attached service troops or civilian employees, not including employed German prisoners of war, whose numbers swelled twenty times that number.<ref name=\":0\" /> Depot Q-256, with its facilities scattered throughout the city of Reims, received overflow salvage directly from the armies. In addition to routine processing and packaging, the depot conducted a program of manufacturing, remodeling, and improvisation.<ref name=\":0\" /> Scrap materials were used to reinforce paratroop trousers, fabricate [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning Automatic Rifle]] belts and rocket ammunition pouches, and patch tent-age. Materials ostensibly destined for scrap were converted into other types of end items: old tires were used to make soles for prisoners' shoes, badly torn shirts and raincoats were transformed into wiping rags, aprons, and typewriter covers, and old wool was converted into \"shoddy\" blankets. Besides the fixed repair activities at Reims salvage depot, twelve mobile repair teams and two technical crews worked out of this installation in answer to calls from the field. Ultimately, Q-256 also had to operate a complete machine shop where motors and other heavy equipment, including QM equipment trailers, were rebuilt, although this was originally a responsibility of Ordnance. Such activities were performed in rented French shops with captured German lathes, presses, and other heavy duty machinery. Sufficient machine tools were available to permit the occasional manufacture of badly needed spare parts such as flame cups for one-burner stoves and rotors for gasoline dispensers. By the end of March 1945 the Reims salvage depot occupied 500,000 square feet of closed space and 350,000 feet of open space; this was more than double the total space set aside for Quartermaster salvage and reclamation in all the U.K. depots as of January 1944. At the close of 1944, the depot had processed nine million items, and in March 1945 it was handling 160,000 pieces per day. Items processed in the United Kingdom shortly after D-day for shipment to the continent were in particularly chaotic condition.<ref name=\":0\" /> During the second half of November 1944, combat units of [[First United States Army|First Army]] complained that items arriving in the forward areas marked Class B clothing were not suitable for issue, and also reports from its own field liaison officers that 80 percent of the clothing located at [[Utah Beach]] marked Class X was actually combat serviceable and included such scarce items as field jackets. COL Beny Rosaler, chief of the Field Service Division, had a solution: assign the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Base Depot), which was in [[Reims|Riems]] at that time, with the task of sorting out the confusion.

When expected cost savings from the use of rotation force failed to materialize, the brigade was permanently reassigned to Europe and served in Germany until its deactivation on 15 September 1984 in Germany.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n[[File:Quartermaster_Professional_Bulletin,_Summer_1993_-_featuring_the_64th_Support_Battalion.pdf|thumb|''Quartermaster Professional Bulletin'', Summer 1993 - featuring the 64th Brigade Support Battalion's linage and picture of refueling operations of a tank from the [[70th Tank Battalion]] during World War II.|alt=]][[File:64th FSB Feature in Article Army Logistician May-June 2001.pdf|thumb|64th Forward Support Battalion featured in ''Army Logistician'', May-June 2001 publication. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=MAY-JUNE 2001|title=Supporting an NTC Rotation|url=https://alu.army.mil/alog/2001/mayjun01/pdf/mayjun2001.pdf|journal=Army Logistician|volume=33|pages=1|via=}}</ref> |alt=]]\nOn 15 May 1987, the battalion was reactivated as the 64th Forward Support Battalion under the DISCOM, 4th Infantry Division (M) with a support relationship with 3d Brigade, 4th Infantry Division (M).<ref name=\":2\" /> Following the [[Gulf War]], the battalion rotated on a deployment to Kuwait with 3d Brigade in support of Operation INTRINSIC ACTION 96-01 to deter [[Saddam Hussein]] from another invasion of Kuwait.<ref name=\":3\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Announcement_of_Campaign_Streamer_for_Southwest_Asia_GO_2005-09.pdf</ref> The 64th Forward Support Battalion remained in Fort Carson with 3d Brigade, 4th Infantry Division (M) when the rest of the division (e.g. Headquarters, 4th Infantry Division; 1st Brigade, 2d Brigade, DISCOM, and Aviation Brigade) relocated to Fort Hood, TX in 1995. \n\n<br />\n<br />\n=== Global War on Terrorism ===\nSince the beginning of the [[Global War on Terrorism]], the battalion has deployed in support of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] from 2003 to 2004, 2005 to 2006, 2007 to 2009, and 2010 to 2011; [[Operation Inherent Resolve]] in 2015; and [[Operation Spartan Shield]] in 2019. The battalion only had two Soldiers killed throughout all deployments.  \n\nAlerted on 19 January 2003, the 4th Infantry Division was scheduled to take part in the [[Iraq War]] in the spring of 2003 by spearheading an advance from [[Turkey]] into northern [[Iraq]]. The Turkish Parliament refused to grant permission for the operation and the division's equipment remained offshore on ships during the buildup for the war. Instead, the 4th Infantry Division or \"Task Force Iron Horse\" was tasked as a follow-on force to secure the volatile [[Sunni Triangle]]. 3d Brigade (Strikers) were tasked with moving along the east side of the [[Tigris|Tigris River]] to seize [[Samarra]]. After suppressing the former regime forces and stabilizing the lawlessness, the brigade assisted the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team|173d Airborne Brigade]] in Kirkuk. By June 2003, 1st Brigade occupied [[Tikrit]], 2nd Brigade occupied [[Baqubah]], and 3d Brigade occupied [[Balad Air Base|Balad]] and Samarra. Throughout this time, the 64th Brigade Support Battalion began building up [[Logistical Support Area Anaconda]] under the command of then-LTC [[Gustave F. Perna|Gustave Perna]] once the airfield was seized, which became one of the largest logistical complexes throughout the war. In March 2004, the battalion redeployed to home to Fort Carson with 3d Brigade.  \n\nOn 16 December 2004 in accordance with the [[Reorganization plan of United States Army#Modular combat brigades|transformation of the Army]], the 64th Forward Support Battalion was redesignated the 64th Brigade Support Battalion. As part of the modular transformation, assets previously held at division level, but habitually attached a division's brigades during operations were made organic to those brigades. The 64th Brigade Support Battalion was relieved from assignment to DISCOM, 4th Infantry Division and reassigned to the redesignated 3d Heavy Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division with a direct-support relationship.   \n\nFrom 1 November 2005 to January 2007, the 64th Brigade Support Battalion deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom. During the deployment, the battalion and 3d Brigade were attached as part of the larger \"Task Force Band of Brothers,\" [[101st Airborne Division|101st Airborne Division (Air Assault)]]. The 3rd Brigade Combat Team's mission included training the Iraqi Security Forces, assisting in the rebuilding of the [[Diyala province campaign|Diyala Province]] infrastructure, as well as continuing to root out the anti-Iraqi forces that inhabit the region. \n\nWithin a month of their return to the US, on 19 January 2007, the division began the task of resetting the equipment, retraining the personnel, and preparing for a return to Iraq in late 2007. The battalion deployed once again to Iraq, serving from December 2007 to January 2009 to Sadr City, Baghdad during the height of sectarian violence and the [[Iraq surge|surge]]. In March 2010, the battalion deployed alongside the brigade to southern Iraq, in the capacity as an Advise and Assist Brigade, which detailed a small number of senior NCOs and officers, and redeploying during the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)|withdrawal of US Forces from Iraq in 2011]]. During 2012, 3rd BCT sent more than 300 of its officers and senior noncommissioned officers in support of Operation Enduring Freedom; however, the battalion was not directly involved. These 3rd BCT Security Forces Assistance Teams deployed on a mission to the southern provinces of Afghanistan to help mentor and train current Afghan National Security Forces. 3rd BCT was one of the first brigades in the Army to be given this mission. \n\nIn February 2015, the 3rd ABCT deployed to Southwest Asia in support of U.S. Central Command. During the nine-month deployment, the unit provided combatant commanders a versatile, responsive, and consistently available force to meet requirements across a range of military operations in the region. These military operations included ongoing operational and contingency operations, operational support and theater security cooperation activities, as well as bilateral and multilateral military exercises that extended over 15 countries throughout the region.\n\n=== Operation Atlantic Resolve ===\n[[File:Operation ATLANTIC RESOLVE Map.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Primary locations for each battalion of the 3d Armored Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division while deployed. 64th Brigade Support Battalion operated in Grafenwoehr, Germany but constantly moved around. |alt=|left]]The 64th Brigade Support Battalion deployed for the fourth time to Europe, but for the first time in the [[21st century]] in support of [[Operation Atlantic Resolve]] from January to November 2017 in response to [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014\u2013present)|renewed Russian aggression in eastern Europe]]. The battalion provided continuous sustainment support for its parent brigade throughout European continent in support of [[United States Army Europe]] and the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)]].\n[[File:64th Brigade Support Battalion in Poland.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the 64th Brigade Support Battalion and Polish Soldiers of the 35th Polish Air Defense Squadron prepare to raise the Polish and U.S. flags during a celebration ceremony welcoming American Forces.|alt=|center]]\n\n== Coat of Arms, Distinctive Unit Insignia, and Unit Campaign Streamers ==\n\n=== Coat of Arms ===\n[[File:64BSB Coat of Arms.png|thumb|The 64th Brigade Support Battalion's coat of arms. |alt=|260x260px]]\nThe coat of arms was approved on 1 December 1975.

In February 1909, balloting in New Haven and Connellsville resulted in these two boroughs joining and becoming the first city in Fayette County on May 12, 1911.\n\nDue to the city's location in the center of the [[Connellsville Coalfield]], coal mining, [[coke (fuel)|coke]] production, and other accompanying industries became the major sources of employment and revenue during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Connellsville became known at the \"Coke Capital of the World\" due to the amount and quality of coke produced in the city's many beehive ovens.\n\n==Geography==\nConnellsville is located in northeastern Fayette County along the [[Youghiogheny River]], a north-flowing tributary of the [[Monongahela River]]. The city is on both sides of the river, with the downtown on the eastern side. It is bordered to the south by the borough of [[South Connellsville, Pennsylvania|South Connellsville]]. [[U.S. Route 119]] passes through the northern and western sides of the city, leading north {{convert|22|mi}} to [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania|Greensburg]] and southwest {{convert|11|mi}} to [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania|Uniontown]], the Fayette County seat. [[Pittsburgh]] is {{convert|50|mi}} to the northwest via US 119 and [[Interstate 76 (Ohio\u2013New Jersey)|Interstate 76]].\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], Connellsville has a total area of {{convert|5.92|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|5.65|sqkm|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.27|sqkm|order=flip}}, or 4.63%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 996\n|1870= 1292\n|1880= 3609\n|1890= 5629\n|1900= 7160\n|1910= 12845\n|1920= 13804\n|1930= 13290\n|1940= 13608\n|1950= 13293\n|1960= 12814\n|1970= 11643\n|1980= 10319\n|1990= 9229\n|2000= 9146\n|2010= 7637\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=7316\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 29, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=January 31, 2008|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=December 11, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=June 11, 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 9,146 people, 3,963 households, and 2,377 families residing in the city.

This main line originated in Baltimore, passed through [[Cumberland, Maryland]] heading west followed the river to Pittsburgh, then continuing on to Chicago. In 1934, the B&O switched its passenger trains to the tracks of the P&LE and used the P&LE station.<ref>Wikipedia site: Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad</ref>\n\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad's Southwest branch from [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania|Greensburg]] entered Connellsville from [[Connellsville Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania|Connellsville Township]], crossing [[U.S. Route 119|Route 119]] and the North End, then crossing the Youghiogheny on a trestle in the middle of the town; this line terminated in [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]]. The line has been abandoned, and the trestle was demolished in the late 1980s. It remains as a coal loading facility behind the location of the former Back Creek Lumber Co where the line was severed. This line is now operated by the [[Southwest Pennsylvania Railroad]].\n\nThe Western Maryland Railroad's line crossed the [[Alleghenies]] from Cumberland and entered Connellsville on the right side of the Youghiogheny River, connecting with two separate railroad companies. The first connection was with the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad's line from Pittsburgh which continued down the right side of the river to Pittsburgh. This was in direct competition with the B & O directly across the river. The second connection of the Western Maryland was to the Norfolk and Western Railroad which crossed the river to the left side on the former Pittsburgh & West Virginia railroad bridge.\n\nThe Norfolk & Western branch was acquired by the [[Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway (1990)|Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad]], which built a new connection on the left side of the river to CSX, which severed the old line across the bridge. This historic bridge is now threatened with demolition. Several of these former railway lines have been abandoned and the [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right of way]] acquired for other uses. The former Western Maryland Railroad and Pittsburgh & Lake Erie lines are now the part of the [[Youghiogheny River Trail]].\n\n[[Amtrak]]'s {{line link|Amtrak|Capitol Limited}} provides passenger rail service to Connellsville, with service to [[Union Station (Chicago)|Chicago]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Union Station (Washington)|Washington, DC]], and other points in between.\n\n===West Penn Railway===\nHistorically, the mining and steel working Connellsville-Greensburg-Scottdale-Jeannette-Mt Pleasant-Irwin-Latrobe area was served by a 339-mile interurban trolley system, the wide track gauge West Penn Railways. It operated until 1952. Before the better economy of the area plus improved roads allowed more ownership and use of automobiles, the run every hour 5 cents a ride bright orange West Penn trolleys provided reliable local transportation.<ref>Wikipedia site: West Penn Railway</ref>\n\n===Transit center===\nThe [[Fayette Area Coordinated Transportation]] transit center hub is located at the Connellsville Airport in Lemont Furnace, about halfway between Fayette's two largest urban centers, Connellsville and Uniontown. \n\n===Roads===\nThe main route through Connellsville is [[U.S. Route 119]], which links Connellsville with nearby cities Uniontown and Greensburg, and provides access to many of the business on the outskirts of the city.

In February 1909, balloting in New Haven and Connellsville resulted in these two boroughs joining and becoming the first city in Fayette County on May 12, 1911.\n\nDue to the city's location in the center of the [[Connellsville Coalfield]], coal mining, [[coke (fuel)|coke]] production, and other accompanying industries became the major sources of employment and revenue during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Connellsville became known at the \"Coke Capital of the World\" due to the amount and quality of coke produced in the city's many beehive ovens.\n\n==Geography==\nConnellsville is located in northeastern Fayette County along the [[Youghiogheny River]], a north-flowing tributary of the [[Monongahela River]]. The city is on both sides of the river, with the downtown on the eastern side. It is bordered to the south by the borough of [[South Connellsville, Pennsylvania|South Connellsville]].

This main line originated in Baltimore, passed through [[Cumberland, Maryland]] heading west followed the river to Pittsburgh, then continuing on to Chicago. In 1934, the B&O switched its passenger trains to the tracks of the P&LE and used the P&LE station.<ref>Wikipedia site: Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad</ref>\n\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad's Southwest branch from [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania|Greensburg]] entered Connellsville from [[Connellsville Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania|Connellsville Township]], crossing [[U.S. Route 119|Route 119]] and the North End, then crossing the Youghiogheny on a trestle in the middle of the town; this line terminated in [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]]. The line has been abandoned, and the trestle was demolished in the late 1980s. It remains as a coal loading facility behind the location of the former Back Creek Lumber Co where the line was severed. This line is now operated by the [[Southwest Pennsylvania Railroad]].\n\nThe Western Maryland Railroad's line crossed the [[Alleghenies]] from Cumberland and entered Connellsville on the right side of the Youghiogheny River, connecting with two separate railroad companies. The first connection was with the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad's line from Pittsburgh which continued down the right side of the river to Pittsburgh. This was in direct competition with the B & O directly across the river. The second connection of the Western Maryland was to the Norfolk and Western Railroad which crossed the river to the left side on the former Pittsburgh & West Virginia railroad bridge.\n\nThe Norfolk & Western branch was acquired by the [[Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway (1990)|Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad]], which built a new connection on the left side of the river to CSX, which severed the old line across the bridge. This historic bridge is now threatened with demolition. Several of these former railway lines have been abandoned and the [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right of way]] acquired for other uses. The former Western Maryland Railroad and Pittsburgh & Lake Erie lines are now the part of the [[Youghiogheny River Trail]].\n\n[[Amtrak]]'s {{line link|Amtrak|Capitol Limited}} provides passenger rail service to Connellsville, with service to [[Union Station (Chicago)|Chicago]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Union Station (Washington)|Washington, DC]], and other points in between.\n\n===West Penn Railway===\nHistorically, the mining and steel working Connellsville-Greensburg-Scottdale-Jeannette-Mt Pleasant-Irwin-Latrobe area was served by a 339-mile interurban trolley system, the wide track gauge West Penn Railways. It operated until 1952. Before the better economy of the area plus improved roads allowed more ownership and use of automobiles, the run every hour 5 cents a ride bright orange West Penn trolleys provided reliable local transportation.<ref>Wikipedia site: West Penn Railway</ref>\n\n===Transit center===\nThe [[Fayette Area Coordinated Transportation]] transit center hub is located at the Connellsville Airport in Lemont Furnace, about halfway between Fayette's two largest urban centers, Connellsville and Uniontown. \n\n===Roads===\nThe main route through Connellsville is [[U.S. Route 119]], which links Connellsville with nearby cities Uniontown and Greensburg, and provides access to many of the business on the outskirts of the city.

(Note: [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Mary of Clopas]], and [[Mary Salome]] are different individuals from Mary, mother of Jesus.)\n\nMany of the titles given to Mary are [[dogma]]tic in nature.  Other titles are poetic or allegorical and have lesser or no canonical status, but form part of [[popular piety]], with varying degrees of acceptance by the clergy.  Yet more titles refer to depictions of Mary in the [[history of art]].\n\n==Historical and cultural context==\n{{see also|History of Roman Catholic Mariology}}\n\nThere are several explanations of the significance of the relatively large number of titles given to Mary.<ref>[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/t/titles-reasons-for.php \u201cWhy does Mary have So Many Different Titles?\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref> Some titles grew due to geographic and cultural reasons, e.g., through the veneration of specific icons. Others were related to [[Marian apparitions]].\n\nMary's help is sought for a large spectrum of human needs in varied situations. This led to the formulation of many of her titles ([[Our Lady of Good Counsel|good counsel]], Help of the Sick, etc.). Moreover, meditations and devotions on the different aspects of the Virgin Mary's role within the life of Jesus led to additional titles, such as [[Our Lady of Sorrows]].<ref>Tavard, George Henry, ''The thousand faces of the Virgin Mary'' 1996 {{ISBN|0-8146-5914-4}} p. 95</ref> Still further titles have been derived from dogmas and doctrines, such as, the [[Immaculate Conception]].\n\nMary's [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] or \"''devotional cult''\" consolidated in the year 431 when, at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], the ''[[Theotokos]]'', or Mary as bearer (or mother) of God, was declared to be a [[dogma]].  Henceforth Marian devotion\u2014which centered on the subtle and complex relationship between Mary, Jesus, and the Church\u2014would flourish, first in the East and later in the West.\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] diminished Mary's role in many parts of Northern Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. The [[Council of Trent]] and [[Counter Reformation]] would intensify Marian devotion in the West.  Around the same period, Mary would become an instrument of evangelization in the Americas and parts of Asia and Africa, e.g., via the apparitions at [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], which resulted in a large number of conversions to Christianity in [[Mexico]].\n\nFollowing the Reformation, as of the 17th century, the [[baroque]] literature on Mary experienced unforeseen growth, with over 500 pages of [[Mariology|Mariological]] writings during the 17th  century alone.<ref>Roskovany, A., conceptu immacolata ex monumentis omnium seculrorum demonstrate III, Budapest 1873</ref> During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the emphasis on [[scientific progress]] and [[rationalism]] put Catholic [[theology]] and Mariology often on the defensive in the later parts of the 18th century, to the extent that books such as ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'' (by [[Alphonsus Liguori]]) were written in defense of Mariology.\n\n==Dogmatic titles==\n* [[Mother of God]]: The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] decreed in 431 that Mary is ''Theotokos'' because her son Jesus is both God and man: one Divine Person with two natures (divine and human).<ref>by Braaten, Carl E. and Jenson, Robert W., ''Mary, Mother of God'', 2004 {{ISBN|0802822665}} p. 84</ref> This name was translated in the West as \"Mater Dei\" or Mother of God. From this derives the title \"Blessed Mother\".\n* [[Virgin Mary]]: The doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary developed early in Christianity and was taught by the early Fathers, such as, [[Irenaeus]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]] (and others).<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15448a.htm Maas, Anthony. \"Virgin Birth of Christ.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 April 2016</ref> In the fourth century \"ever-virgin\" became a popular title for Mary.<ref>[[Donald Wuerl|Wuerl, Donald W.]] and Stubna, Kris D., [https://books.google.com/books?id=IzqDiPALzKEC&pg=PA100&dq=mary's+perpetual+virginity+dogma&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXn_2o2oXMAhVJOD4KHXeIAaQ4ChDoAQhHMAg#v=onepage&q=mary's%20perpetual%20virginity%20dogma&f=false ''The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults''], Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|9781592760947}}</ref> Variations on this include the \"Virgin Mary\", the \"Blessed Virgin\", the \"Blessed Virgin Mary\", and \"Spouse of the Holy Spirit\". The perpetual virginity of Mary was declared a dogma by the Lateran Council of 649.\n* [[Immaculate Conception]]: The dogma that Mary was conceived without original sin was defined in 1854, by [[Pope Pius IX]]'s apostolic constitution ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]''. This gave rise to the titles of \"Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception\" and \"Queen Conceived Without Original Sin\". The Immaculate Conception is also honored under the titles of [[Our Lady of Caysasay]] (Philippines),<ref>[http://withonespast.wordpress.com/2009/11/22/ermita-nuestra-sra-de-guia/ \"In Honor of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guia\", De Anda (2009-11-22)],</ref> [[Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn]] in [[Vilnius]], [[Our Lady of Guidance]], and [[Our Lady of Salambao]], also in the Philippines.\n*[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]: The belief that the Virgin Mary was assumed body and soul into heaven upon completing the course of her earthly life was declared a dogma in 1950 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in the apostolic constitution ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]''. The titles \"Our Lady of Assumption\" and \"Queen Assumed Into Heaven\" derive from this. This dogma is also reflected in devotion to [[Ta' Pinu|Our Lady of Ta' Pinu]] on Malta.\n\n==Early titles of Mary==\n\u201cOur Lady\u201d is a common title to give to Mary as a sign of respect and honor. In French she is called \"Notre Dame\" and in Spanish she is \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora\".<ref>[http://www.dolr.org/article/marian-titles-chosen-one-out-four-churches-diocese Hargett, Malea. \"Marian titles chosen for one out of four churches in diocese\", ''Arkansas Catholic'', Diocese of Arkansas, May 20, 2006]</ref>\n\n* Mary was identified as the \"[[Nova Eva|New Eve]]\" as early as the later half of the Second Century. [[Justin Martyr]] (100\u2013165) draws the connection in his ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. This idea is later expanded by [[Irenaeus]].<ref>Mauriello, Matthew R., [http://www.freifrancisco.com.br/2014/08/mary-new-eve-mariology.html \u201cMary the New Eve,\u201d] ''Frei Francisco''.</ref>\n* [[John Chrysostom]], in 345, was the first person to use the Marian title [[Mary Help of Christians]] as a devotion to the Virgin Mary. [[John Bosco|Don Bosco]] promoted devotion to Mary under this title.\n* ''Stella Maris'' or [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea]] is an ancient title for the Virgin Mary, used to emphasize her role as a sign of hope and a guiding star for Christians. It is attributed to [[Jerome]] and cited by [[Paschasius Radbertus]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=150| English !! width=100| Latin !! width=100| Greek !!

Furthermore, she is related to four different dogmas and a lot of Marian titles. Christians prayers, titles and arts witness her prominent role at the sight of the throne of God for the history of salvation.  \n\nIn the [[Hail Mary]] prayer, she is called \"full of [[divine grace|grace]]\" by the angel of the [[Annunciation#Eastern Christianity|Annunciation]] talking in the name and on behalf of God. In the [[Nicene Creed]], it is narrated that Jesus was \"incarnate by the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, and was made man,\" meaning that the divine grace firstly concerns the Real Presence of the Holy Spirit into her body, the degree of her participation to the life of the Holy Trinity as well as the amount of [[Gifts of the holy spirit|charisms of the Holy Spirit God]] she continuously receives and that only she is allowed by God to redistribute. \n\nThe Virgin Mother of God was anointed by the Holy Spirit God, summing up the anointings of the Kings, Prophets, Judges and High Priests of Israel, like Jesus Christ God did. For [[Marian apparition|Marian apparitions]] testify to her gift of prophecy, the Virgin Mary is assimilated to the [[anointing#Religion|anointed]] of Israel by her titles of: \n* Advocate of the Church (like the judges of Israel) \n* [[Mediatrix of all graces]]<ref>{{cite web | author = Mark Alessio | url = http://catholicism.org/mary-advocate-church.html | title = Mary, advocate of the Church and Mediatrix of all graces | date = 31 January 2006 | website = catholicism.org | archive-url = http://archive.is/J5Yew/ | archive-date = 9 March 2016 | url-status = live}}</ref> (like a High Priest of Israel),\n* Queen of Angels (like the kings of Israel): the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] paintings represent the [[hierarchy of angels]] of God while starting to serve Mary forever, after she has accepted to become the Mother of God.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic and in the Orthodox Church, the Virgin Mother of God is venerated in a special mode called with the Greek word [[hyperdulia]], that is secondary only to the adoration reserved to the Triune God. She is venerated and honoured in such a way since no other creature -both angelic and human- has a greater power than Mary to [[Intercession of saints#Catholic and Orthodox views|intercede]] the grace of God to His sons.\n\n==Titles associated with devotional images==\n[[File:Pe\u00f1afrancia Original Image.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Our Lady of Pe\u00f1afrancia]] in [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]], [[Philippines]]]]\n{{See also|Black Madonna}}\n* A \"Black Madonna\" (or ''Vierges Noires'') is a type of statue or painting, generally of the 12th to 15th centuries, in which Mary, and oftentimes the infant [[Jesus]], are depicted with dark features.<ref>Duricy, Michael P., [https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/black-madonnas-origin-history-controversy.php \u201cBlack Madonnas: Origin, History, Controversy,\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref>  There are over 450 Black Madonnas in Europe.

(Note: [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Mary of Clopas]], and [[Mary Salome]] are different individuals from Mary, mother of Jesus.)\n\nMany of the titles given to Mary are [[dogma]]tic in nature.  Other titles are poetic or allegorical and have lesser or no canonical status, but form part of [[popular piety]], with varying degrees of acceptance by the clergy.  Yet more titles refer to depictions of Mary in the [[history of art]].\n\n==Historical and cultural context==\n{{see also|History of Roman Catholic Mariology}}\n\nThere are several explanations of the significance of the relatively large number of titles given to Mary.<ref>[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/t/titles-reasons-for.php \u201cWhy does Mary have So Many Different Titles?\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref> Some titles grew due to geographic and cultural reasons, e.g., through the veneration of specific icons. Others were related to [[Marian apparitions]].\n\nMary's help is sought for a large spectrum of human needs in varied situations. This led to the formulation of many of her titles ([[Our Lady of Good Counsel|good counsel]], Help of the Sick, etc.). Moreover, meditations and devotions on the different aspects of the Virgin Mary's role within the life of Jesus led to additional titles, such as [[Our Lady of Sorrows]].<ref>Tavard, George Henry, ''The thousand faces of the Virgin Mary'' 1996 {{ISBN|0-8146-5914-4}} p. 95</ref> Still further titles have been derived from dogmas and doctrines, such as, the [[Immaculate Conception]].\n\nMary's [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] or \"''devotional cult''\" consolidated in the year 431 when, at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], the ''[[Theotokos]]'', or Mary as bearer (or mother) of God, was declared to be a [[dogma]].  Henceforth Marian devotion\u2014which centered on the subtle and complex relationship between Mary, Jesus, and the Church\u2014would flourish, first in the East and later in the West.\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] diminished Mary's role in many parts of Northern Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. The [[Council of Trent]] and [[Counter Reformation]] would intensify Marian devotion in the West.  Around the same period, Mary would become an instrument of evangelization in the Americas and parts of Asia and Africa, e.g., via the apparitions at [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], which resulted in a large number of conversions to Christianity in [[Mexico]].\n\nFollowing the Reformation, as of the 17th century, the [[baroque]] literature on Mary experienced unforeseen growth, with over 500 pages of [[Mariology|Mariological]] writings during the 17th  century alone.<ref>Roskovany, A., conceptu immacolata ex monumentis omnium seculrorum demonstrate III, Budapest 1873</ref> During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the emphasis on [[scientific progress]] and [[rationalism]] put Catholic [[theology]] and Mariology often on the defensive in the later parts of the 18th century, to the extent that books such as ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'' (by [[Alphonsus Liguori]]) were written in defense of Mariology.\n\n==Dogmatic titles==\n* [[Mother of God]]: The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] decreed in 431 that Mary is ''Theotokos'' because her son Jesus is both God and man: one Divine Person with two natures (divine and human).<ref>by Braaten, Carl E. and Jenson, Robert W., ''Mary, Mother of God'', 2004 {{ISBN|0802822665}} p. 84</ref> This name was translated in the West as \"Mater Dei\" or Mother of God. From this derives the title \"Blessed Mother\".\n* [[Virgin Mary]]: The doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary developed early in Christianity and was taught by the early Fathers, such as, [[Irenaeus]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]] (and others).<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15448a.htm Maas, Anthony. \"Virgin Birth of Christ.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 April 2016</ref> In the fourth century \"ever-virgin\" became a popular title for Mary.<ref>[[Donald Wuerl|Wuerl, Donald W.]] and Stubna, Kris D., [https://books.google.com/books?id=IzqDiPALzKEC&pg=PA100&dq=mary's+perpetual+virginity+dogma&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXn_2o2oXMAhVJOD4KHXeIAaQ4ChDoAQhHMAg#v=onepage&q=mary's%20perpetual%20virginity%20dogma&f=false ''The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults''], Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|9781592760947}}</ref> Variations on this include the \"Virgin Mary\", the \"Blessed Virgin\", the \"Blessed Virgin Mary\", and \"Spouse of the Holy Spirit\". The perpetual virginity of Mary was declared a dogma by the Lateran Council of 649.\n* [[Immaculate Conception]]: The dogma that Mary was conceived without original sin was defined in 1854, by [[Pope Pius IX]]'s apostolic constitution ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]''. This gave rise to the titles of \"Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception\" and \"Queen Conceived Without Original Sin\". The Immaculate Conception is also honored under the titles of [[Our Lady of Caysasay]] (Philippines),<ref>[http://withonespast.wordpress.com/2009/11/22/ermita-nuestra-sra-de-guia/ \"In Honor of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guia\", De Anda (2009-11-22)],</ref> [[Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn]] in [[Vilnius]], [[Our Lady of Guidance]], and [[Our Lady of Salambao]], also in the Philippines.\n*[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]: The belief that the Virgin Mary was assumed body and soul into heaven upon completing the course of her earthly life was declared a dogma in 1950 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in the apostolic constitution ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]''. The titles \"Our Lady of Assumption\" and \"Queen Assumed Into Heaven\" derive from this. This dogma is also reflected in devotion to [[Ta' Pinu|Our Lady of Ta' Pinu]] on Malta.\n\n==Early titles of Mary==\n\u201cOur Lady\u201d is a common title to give to Mary as a sign of respect and honor. In French she is called \"Notre Dame\" and in Spanish she is \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora\".<ref>[http://www.dolr.org/article/marian-titles-chosen-one-out-four-churches-diocese Hargett, Malea. \"Marian titles chosen for one out of four churches in diocese\", ''Arkansas Catholic'', Diocese of Arkansas, May 20, 2006]</ref>\n\n* Mary was identified as the \"[[Nova Eva|New Eve]]\" as early as the later half of the Second Century. [[Justin Martyr]] (100\u2013165) draws the connection in his ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. This idea is later expanded by [[Irenaeus]].<ref>Mauriello, Matthew R., [http://www.freifrancisco.com.br/2014/08/mary-new-eve-mariology.html \u201cMary the New Eve,\u201d] ''Frei Francisco''.</ref>\n* [[John Chrysostom]], in 345, was the first person to use the Marian title [[Mary Help of Christians]] as a devotion to the Virgin Mary. [[John Bosco|Don Bosco]] promoted devotion to Mary under this title.\n* ''Stella Maris'' or [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea]] is an ancient title for the Virgin Mary, used to emphasize her role as a sign of hope and a guiding star for Christians. It is attributed to [[Jerome]] and cited by [[Paschasius Radbertus]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=150| English !! width=100| Latin !! width=100| Greek !!

Furthermore, she is interested by four different dogmas and a lot of Marian titles. Christians prayers, titles and arts witness her prominent role at the sight of the throne of God for the history of salvation.  \n\nIn the [[Hail Mary]] prayer, she is called \"full of [[divine grace|grace]]\" by the angel of the [[Annunciation#Eastern Christianity|Annunciation]] talking in the name and on behalf of God. In the [[Nicene Creed]], it is told that Jesus was \"incarnate by the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, and was made man\", meaning that the divine grace firstly concerns the Real Presence of the Holy Spirit God into her body, the degree of her participation to the life of the Holy Trinity as well as the amount of [[Gifts of the holy spirit|charisms of the Holy Spirit God]] she continuously receives and that only she is allowed by God to redistribute. \n\nThe Virgin Mother of God was anointed by the Holy Spirit God, summing up the anointings of the Kings, Prophets, Judges and High Priests of Israel, like Jesus Christ God did. For [[Marian apparition|Marian apparitions]] testify to her gift of prophecy, the Virgin Mary is assimilated to the [[anointing#Religion|anointed]] of Israel by her titles of: \n* Advocate of the Church (like the judges of Israel) \n* [[Mediatrix of all graces]]<ref>{{cite web | author = Mark Alessio | url = http://catholicism.org/mary-advocate-church.html | title = Mary, advocate of the Church and Mediatrix of all graces | date = 31 January 2006 | website = catholicism.org | archive-url = http://archive.is/J5Yew/ | archive-date = 9 March 2016 | url-status = live}}</ref> (like a High Priest of Israel),\n* Queen of Angels (like the kings of Israel): the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] paintings represent the [[hierarchy of angels]] of God while starting to serve Mary forever, after she has accepted to become the Mother of God.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic and in the Orthodox Church, the Virgin Mother of God is venerated in a special mode called with the Greek word [[hyperdulia]], that is secondary only to the adoration reserved to the Triune God. She is venerated and honoured in such a way since no other creature -both angelic and human- has a greater power than Mary to [[Intercession of saints#Catholic and Orthodox views|intercede]] the grace of God to His sons.\n\n==Titles associated with devotional images==\n[[File:Pe\u00f1afrancia Original Image.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Our Lady of Pe\u00f1afrancia]] in [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]], [[Philippines]]]]\n{{See also|Black Madonna}}\n* A \"Black Madonna\" (or ''Vierges Noires'') is a type of statue or painting, generally of the 12th to 15th centuries, in which Mary, and oftentimes the infant [[Jesus]], are depicted with dark features.<ref>Duricy, Michael P., [https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/black-madonnas-origin-history-controversy.php \u201cBlack Madonnas: Origin, History, Controversy,\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref>  There are over 450 Black Madonnas in Europe.

Down the backstretch he was joined by [[John Woodruff (athlete)|John Woodruff]].  For the second day in a row, the Nazi home crowd was seeing two black North Americans leading a final after [[Jesse Owens]] and [[Ralph Metcalfe]] winning the [[Athletics at the 1936 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metres|100 metres]].  Along the home stretch, [[Kazimierz Kucharski]] came along the outside, with [[Brian MacCabe]] in tow, effectively boxing Woodruff on the rail.  Sensing the danger, Woodruff slowed, dropping to sixth place but giving himself free running room.  With a long relaxed stride, the tall Woodruff ran around the outside and past Edwards into the lead.  Heading into the final turn, Edwards again accelerated into the lead, but Woodruff stayed with him as both separated from Kucharski and [[Chuck Hornbostel]].  With the trailers struggling, a path down the rail opened up for [[Mario Lanzi]] to run past them on the inside.  Through the turn, Edwards was unable to break Woodruff.  Coming off the turn, it was Woodruff's long stride that took the advantage over the smaller Edwards.  Now it was Edwards who was struggling as Woodruff pulled away with only half the straightaway to the finish.  Lanzi seized the opportunity to run past Edwards on the outside, but there was no time to run after Woodruff.\n\n==Results==\n\n===Heats===\n\nThe fastest four runners in each of the six heats advanced to the semifinal round.\n\n'''Heat one'''\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Down the backstretch he was joined by [[John Woodruff]].  For the second day in a row, the Nazi home crowd was seeing two black North Americans leading a final after [[Jesse Owens]] and [[Ralph Metcalfe]] winning the [[Athletics at the 1936 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metres|100 metres]].  Along the home stretch, [[Kazimierz Kucharski]] came along the outside, with [[Brian MacCabe]] in tow, effectively boxing Woodruff on the rail.  Sensing the danger, Woodruff slowed, dropping to sixth place but giving himself free running room.  With a long relaxed stride, the tall Woodruff ran around the outside and past Edwards into the lead.  Heading into the final turn, Edwards again accelerated into the lead, but Woodruff stayed with him as both separated from Kucharski and [[Chuck Hornbostel]].  With the trailers struggling, a path down the rail opened up for [[Mario Lanzi]] to run past them on the inside.  Through the turn, Edwards was unable to break Woodruff.  Coming off the turn, it was Woodruff's long stride that took the advantage over the smaller Edwards.  Now it was Edwards who was struggling as Woodruff pulled away with only half the straightaway to the finish.  Lanzi seized the opportunity to run past Edwards on the outside, but there was no time to run after Woodruff.\n\n==Results==\n\n===Heats===\n\nThe fastest four runners in each of the six heats advanced to the semifinal round.\n\n'''Heat one'''\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

So in 139 BC he sent an envoy by the name of [[Zhang Qian]] to survey the west and forge a military alliance with the [[Yuezhi]] against the Xiongnu.<ref name=\":1\" />{{sfn|Benjamin|2018|pp=70\u201371}}\nOn the way to Central Asia through the [[Gobi Desert|Gobi desert]], Zhang was captured twice.\nOn his return, he impressed the emperor with his description of the \"heavenly horses\" of Dayuan.{{sfn|Benjamin|2018|p=77}}\n\nAccording to the ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' (penned by a Chinese historian during the fifth century and considered an authoritative record of the Han history between 25 and 220), at least five or six, and perhaps as many as ten diplomatic groups were dispatched annually by the Han court to Central Asia during this period to buy horses.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe horses have since captured the popular imagination of China, leading to horse carvings, breeding grounds in [[Gansu]], and up to 430,000 such horses in the cavalry during even the [[Tang dynasty]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Xiongnu ===\nFor decades prior the Han followed a policy of ''[[heqin]]'' (\u548c\u4eb2) sending tribute and princesses to marry the Xiongnu ''shanyu'' to maintain peace. This changed when Emperor Wudi came into power, when the Han adopted and revived a policy to defeat the Xiongnu.{{sfn|Benjamin|2018|pp=70\u201371}}\n\n=== Dayuan ===\n\n''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' and the ''[[Book of Han]]'' describe the [[Dayuan]] as numbering several hundred thousand people living in 70 walled cities of varying size. They grew rice and wheat, and made wine from grapes.{{sfn|Watson|1993|pp=244\u201345}}\n\nDayuan was one of the furthest western states to send envoys to the Han court. However unlike the other envoys, the ones from Dayuan did not conform to the proper Han rituals and behaved with great arrogance and self-assurance, believing they were too far away to be in any danger of invasion. Dayuan was also situated near the Xiongnu at this point, who were held in great respect for they had caused the [[Yuezhi]] much suffering. An envoy from the Xiongnu bearing the credentials of the [[Chanyu]] was provided with food and escort. In comparison, a Han envoy received no mounts he did not buy himself and no food unless he handed out silks and other goods. Han envoys also had a reputation for wealth in the west, thus they were charged exorbitant fees wherever they went, causing the Han no small amount of grief.{{sfn|Watson|1993|p=244}} However the historian [[Sima Qian]] provides a different account:\n\n{{quotation|The envoys were all sons of poor families who handled the government gifts and goods that were entrusted to them as though they were private property and looked for opportunities to buy goods at a cheap price in the foreign countries and make a profit on their return to China. The men of the foreign lands soon became disgusted when they found that each of the Han envoys told some different story and, considering that the Han armies were too far away to worry about, refused to supply the envoys with food and provisions, making things very difficult for them. The Han envoys were soon reduced to a state of destitution and distress and, their tempers mounting, fell to quarrelling and even attacking each other.{{sfn|Watson|1993|p=242}}|''[[Shiji]]''}}\n\nAmong the goods western envoys brought with them were the \"heavenly horses\", which the emperor took a liking to. He sent a trade mission with 1,000 pieces of gold and a golden horse to purchase these horses from Dayuan. Dayuan had at this point already been trading with the Han for quite some time and benefited greatly from it. Not only were they overflowing with eastern goods, they also learned from Han soldiers how to cast metal into coins and weapons. Thus they had no great reason to accept the Han trade offer, reasoning:\n\n{{quotation|The Han is far away from us and on several occasions has lost men in the salt-water wastes between our country and China. Yet if the Han parties go farther north, they will be harassed by the Xiongnu, while if they try to go south they will suffer from lack of water and fodder. Moreover, there are many places along the route where there are no cities whatsoever and they are apt to run out of provisions. The Han embassies that have come to us are made up of only a few hundred men, and yet they are always short of food and over half the men die on the journey. Under such circumstances how could the Han possibly send a large army against us? What have we to worry about? Furthermore, the horses of Ershi are one of the most valuable treasures of the state!{{sfn|Watson|1993|p=246}}|[[Dayuan]], ''[[Shiji]]''}}\n\nThe Han envoys cursed the men of Dayuan and smashed the golden horse they had brought. Enraged by this act of contempt, the nobles of Dayuan ordered Yucheng (modern [[Uzgen]]), which lay on their eastern borders, to attack and kill the envoys and seize their goods. Upon receiving word of the trade mission's demise, Emperor Wu decided to dispatch a punitive expedition against Dayuan. [[Li Guangli]], brother of Emperor Wu's favorite concubine, [[Lady Li]], was appointed Ershi General and sent against Dayuan with 6,000 cavalry and 20,000 young men drawn from the undesirables among the border kingdoms.{{sfn|Watson|1993|p=246}}\n\n==First expedition (104 BC)==\nIn the autumn of 104 BC, Li Guangli set out with an army of 6,000 cavalry and 20,000 infantry. While crossing the [[Tarim Basin]] and the [[Taklamakan Desert]] (of modern [[Xinjiang]]), Li's army was forced to attack the nearby oasis states because they refused to provide them with supplies. Sometimes they were unable to overcome the oasis states. If the siege lasted for more than a few days, the army moved on without any supplies. Due to these numerous petty conflicts, the army became exhausted and was reduced to starvation after their supplies ran out. By the time they neared Dayuan, Li had already lost too much manpower to continue the campaign. After suffering a defeat at Yucheng, Li concluded that their current strength would not be sufficient to take the Dayuan capital, Ershi ([[Khujand]]), and therefore returned to [[Dunhuang]].{{sfn|Peers|1995|p=8}}\n\n==Second expedition (102 BC)==\nThe court officials wanted to disband Li's expeditionary army and concentrate their resources toward fighting the Xiongnu. Emperor Wu refused out of fear that failure to subdue Dayuan would result in a loss of prestige with the western states. He responded by giving Li a much larger army as well as supply animals. In the autumn of 102 BC, Li set out with an army of 60,000 recruits from the prison population and 30,000 horses along with a large number of supply animals including 100,000 oxen and 20,000 donkeys and camels. This time the expedition had no problem dealing with the oasis states.{{sfn|Peers|1995|p=8}}{{sfn|Whiting|2002|p=164}}\n\nMost of them simply surrendered without a fight upon seeing the overwhelming display of power. The only state that put up any resistance was [[Luntai]], for which Li had its populace massacred. Despite meeting no major setbacks and bypassing Yucheng entirely, Li still lost half his army by the time they reached Dayuan.{{sfn|Peers|1995|p=8}} Upon arriving at Ershi, Li immediately laid siege to it. A force of [[Wusun]] cavalry 2,000 strong was also present at the request of Emperor Wu, but they refused to take part in the siege out of fear of offending either parties. Dayuan's forces sallied out in an attempt to break the siege, but they were easily defeated by Han crossbowmen. Han engineers set to work on the river passing through Ershi and diverted it, leaving the city with no source of water as they had no wells. After a 40-day siege, the Han broke through the outer wall and captured the enemy general, Jianmi. The nobles of Ershi withdrew to the inner walls and decided to offer terms of surrender. First they killed their king, Wugua, and sent his head to Li. Then they offered Li all the horses he wanted as well as supplies in return for the army's withdrawal, but if he did not accept, they would kill all their horses. Li agreed to the terms, taking some 3,000 horses as well as provisions. Before departing, Li enthroned as king one of the nobles called Meicai (\u6627\u8521), since he had previously shown kindness to the Han envoys.{{sfn|Whiting|2002|p=165}}\n\nAs Li set out for Dunhuang, he realized that the local areas along the way would not be able to adequately supply the army. The army separated into several groups, some taking the northern route while others the southern route. One of these groups, comprising only 1,000 or so men under the command of [[Wang Shensheng]] and [[Hu Chongguo]], tried to take Yucheng. After several days under siege, the inhabitants of Yucheng sallied out with 3,000 men and defeated the besieging army. A few of the Han soldiers managed to escape and alert Li of the defeat. Thereupon, Li dispatched [[Shangguan Jie]] to attack Yucheng. Seeing the great host sent against him, the king of Yucheng decided to flee to [[Kangju]], causing Yucheng to surrender shortly thereafter. When Kangju received news of Dayuan's defeat, they handed the king of Yucheng over to Shangguan, who had him executed.{{sfn|Whiting|2002|p=165}}\n\nThe army met no further opposition on the way back to [[Yumen Pass]]. Having heard of Dayuan's defeat, the rulers of the oasis states sent their kin along with the army back to the Han capital, where they presented tribute to Emperor Wu. They remained at the Han court as hostages. Despite the overall success of the second expedition, having adequate supplies and losing only a small portion of the army in battle, the entire campaign was marred by corruption and self interest. Li's soldiers, being taken from the prison population and undesirable class, were given very little care by their generals and officers, who instead abused them by withholding rations, causing desertion. As a result, Li returned with just 10,000 men and 1,000 horses fit for military service. Even so, Emperor Wu still considered these to be acceptable losses in the victory over Dayuan, and made no attempts to punish those who were responsible. Those who had survived were given handsome rewards. Li Guangli was enfeoffed as Marquis of [[Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Haixi]]. [[Zhao Di]], who secured the capture of the king of Yucheng, became Marquis of [[Xinzhi]]. Shangguan Jie became privy treasurer.{{sfn|Whiting|2002|p=165}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nMore than a year later, the nobles of Dayuan banded together and killed King Meicai, who they considered responsible for the entire affair with the Han in the first place. Wugua's brother, Chanfeng, became the new king. Not wishing to upset the Han, Chanfeng sent his son as hostage to the Han court. In response, the Han dispatched envoys with gifts for the new ruler and made peace with Dayuan.{{sfn|Watson|1993|p=252}}\n\nTen years later, Li Guangli was defeated by the Xiongnu and defected to their side. He married the [[Chanyu]]'s daughter but was eventually executed over a conflict with another Han defector more favored by the Chanyu.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lin Jianming (\u6797\u5251\u9e23) |title=\u79e6\u6f22\u53f2 |trans-title=History of Qin and Han |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqfrEY8UW1UC&pg=PA557 |year=1992 |publisher=Wunan Publishing |isbn=978-957-11-0574-1 |pages=557\u2013578}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n*{{citation |title=Empires of Ancient Eurasia: The First Silk Roads Era, 100 BCE \u2013 250 CE |last=Benjamin |first=Craig |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2018 |isbn=978-1-107-11496-8 |doi=10.1017/9781316335567.004 }}\n*{{citation|last=Peers|first=C.

Options for sound optimizations exist, as well as ways to wirelessly share the iTunes library.\n\nOriginally announced by then-CEO [[Steve Jobs]] on January 9, 2001, iTunes' original and main focus was music, with a library offering organization, collection, and storage of users' music collections. In 2005, however, Apple expanded on the core features with support for digital video, [[podcasts]], [[e-books]], and [[mobile apps]] purchased from [[App Store (iOS)|the iOS App Store]] (the last of which it discontinued in 2017). The [[iPhone (1st generation)|original]] [[iPhone]] required iTunes for activation. Until the release of [[iOS 5]] in 2011, iTunes was required for updating mobile apps. Newer iOS devices have less reliance on iTunes in order to function, though it can still be used to back up the contents of mobile devices, as well as to share files with personal computers.\n\nThough well-received in its early years, iTunes soon received increasingly significant criticism for a [[software bloat|bloated]] user experience, with Apple adopting an all-encompassing feature-set in iTunes rather than sticking to its original music-based purpose. On June 3, 2019, Apple announced that iTunes in [[macOS Catalina]] would be replaced by separate apps, namely [[Apple Music (software)|Music]], [[Podcasts (software)|Podcasts]], and [[Apple TV (software)|TV]]. [[Finder (software)|Finder]] would take over the device management capabilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18647182/apple-itunes-podcasts-music-tv-mac-os-wwdc-2019|title=Apple breaks up iTunes, creates separate Podcasts, TV, and Music apps for macOS|last=Carman|first=Ashley|date=2019-06-03|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/itunes-shutting-down-1203231598/|title=Apple Is Officially Killing iTunes, Replacing It With Three Dedicated Media Apps|last=Roettgers|first=Janko|date=2019-06-03|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> This change would not affect Windows or older macOS versions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/apple-itunes-store-ios-windows-not-going-away-1203231814/|title=Apple\u2019s iTunes Store, iTunes App for Windows Aren\u2019t Going Away|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2019-06-03|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of iTunes}}\n[[SoundJam MP]], released by [[Casady & Greene]] in 1998, was renamed \"iTunes\" when [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] purchased it in 2000<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/01/01/08/apple_acquires_soundjam_programmer_for_imusic|title=Apple Acquires SoundJam, Programmer for iMusic|last=|first=|date=|work=Apple Insider|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>.
