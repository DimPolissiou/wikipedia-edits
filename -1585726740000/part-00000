Usually considered the last king of the [[House of Wessex]], he ruled from 1042 to 1066.\n\nEdward was the son of [[\u00c6thelred the Unready]] and [[Emma of Normandy]].  He succeeded [[Cnut the Great]]'s son&nbsp;\u2013 and his own half brother&nbsp;\u2013 [[Harthacnut]].  He restored the rule of the House of Wessex after the period of Danish rule since Cnut (better known as Canute) conquered England in 1016. When Edward died in 1066, he was succeeded by [[Harold Godwinson]], who was defeated and killed in the same year by the [[Normans]] under [[William the Conqueror]] at the [[Battle of Hastings]]. [[Edgar \u00c6theling|Edgar the \u00c6theling]], who was of the House of Wessex, was proclaimed king after the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066, but never ruled and was deposed after about eight weeks.\n\nHistorians disagree about Edward's fairly long (24-year) reign. His nickname reflects the traditional image of him as unworldly and pious. [[Confessor of the Faith|Confessor]] reflects his reputation as a [[saint]] who did not suffer [[Martyr|martyrdom]], as opposed to King [[Edward the Martyr]]. Some portray Edward the Confessor's reign as leading to the disintegration of royal power in England and the advance in power of the [[House of Godwin]], due to the infighting that began after his heirless  death. Biographers [[Frank Barlow (historian)|Frank Barlow]] and Peter Rex, on the other hand, portray Edward as a successful king, one who was energetic, resourceful and sometimes ruthless; they argue that the Norman conquest shortly after his death tarnished his image.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}{{sfn|Rex|2008|p=224}} However, Richard Mortimer argues that the return of the Godwins from exile in 1052 \"meant the effective end of his exercise of power\", citing Edward's reduced activity as implying \"a withdrawal from affairs\".{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=}}\n\nAbout a century later, in 1161, [[Pope Alexander III]] [[Canonization|canonised]] the king. Saint Edward was one of England's national saints until [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]] adopted [[Saint George]] as the national patron saint in about 1350. Saint Edward's [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] is 13 October, celebrated by both the [[Church of England]] and the [[Catholic Church]] in [[England and Wales]].\n\n==Early years and exile==\nEdward was the seventh son of [[\u00c6thelred the Unready]], and the first by his second wife, [[Emma of Normandy]]. Edward was born between 1003 and 1005 in [[Islip, Oxfordshire]],{{sfn|Barlow|2006}} and is first recorded as a 'witness' to two charters in 1005. He had one full brother, [[Alfred Aetheling|Alfred]], and a sister, [[Godgifu, daughter of \u00c6thelred the Unready|Godgifu]]. In charters he was always listed behind his older half-brothers, showing that he ranked behind them.{{sfn|Keynes|2009|p=49}}\n\nDuring his childhood, England was the target of [[Vikings|Viking]] raids and invasions under [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] and his son, Cnut. Following Sweyn's seizure of the throne in 1013, Emma fled to [[Normandy]], followed by Edward and Alfred, and then by \u00c6thelred. Sweyn died in February 1014, and leading Englishmen invited \u00c6thelred back on condition that he promised to rule 'more justly' than before. \u00c6thelred agreed, sending Edward back with his ambassadors.{{sfn|Rex|2008|pp=13, 19}} \u00c6thelred died in April 1016, and he was succeeded by Edward's older half-brother [[Edmund Ironside]], who carried on the fight against Sweyn's son, Cnut. According to Scandinavian tradition, Edward fought alongside Edmund; as Edward was at most thirteen years old at the time, the story is disputed.{{sfn|Barlow|1970 | p = [https://archive.org/details/edwardconfessor00barl/page/29 29\u201336] }}{{sfn|Keynes|2009|p=56}} Edmund died in November 1016, and Cnut became undisputed king. Edward then again went into exile with his brother and sister; in 1017 his mother married Cnut.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}} In the same year Cnut had Edward's last surviving elder half-brother, [[Eadwig \u00c6theling|Eadwig]], executed,{{sfn|Panton|2011|p=21}} leaving Edward as the leading Anglo-Saxon claimant to the throne.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n[[File:Edward the Confessor Penny.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Penny]] of Edward the Confessor]]\nEdward spent a quarter of a century in exile, probably mainly in Normandy, although there is no evidence of his location until the early 1030s. He probably received support from his sister Godgifu, who married [[Drogo of Mantes]], count of [[Vexin]] in about 1024. In the early 1030s, Edward witnessed four charters in Normandy, signing two of them as king of England. According to the Norman chronicler, [[William of Jumi\u00e8ges]], [[Robert I, Duke of Normandy]] attempted an invasion of England to place Edward on the throne in about 1034, but it was blown off course to [[Jersey]]. He also received support for his claim to the throne from a number of continental abbots, particularly [[Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges|Robert]], abbot of the [[Jumi\u00e8ges Abbey|Norman abbey of Jumi\u00e8ges]], who was later to become Edward's Archbishop of Canterbury.{{sfn|van Houts|2009|pp= 63\u201375}} Edward was said to have developed an intense personal piety during this period, but modern historians regard this as a product of the later medieval campaign for his canonisation. In Frank Barlow's view \"in his lifestyle would seem to have been that of a typical member of the rustic nobility\".{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}{{sfn|Howarth|1981|p=}} He appeared to have a slim prospect of acceding to the English throne during this period, and his ambitious mother was more interested in supporting Harthacnut, her son by Cnut.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}{{sfn|Rex|2008|p=28}}\n\nCnut died in 1035, and Harthacnut succeeded him as king of [[Denmark]]. It is unclear whether he intended to keep England as well, but he was too busy defending his position in Denmark to come to England to assert his claim to the throne. It was therefore decided that his elder half-brother [[Harold Harefoot]] should act as regent, while Emma held Wessex on Harthacnut's behalf.{{sfn|Lawson|2004}} In 1036 Edward and his brother Alfred separately came to England. Emma later claimed that they came in response to a letter forged by Harold inviting them to visit her, but historians believe that she probably did invite them in an effort to counter Harold's growing popularity.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}{{sfn|Rex|2008|pp=34\u201335}} Alfred was captured by [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex]] who turned him over to [[Harold Harefoot]]. He had Alfred blinded by forcing red-hot pokers into his eyes to make him unsuitable for kingship, and Alfred died soon after as a result of his wounds. The murder is thought to be the source of much of Edward's later hatred for the Earl and one of the primary reasons for Godwin's banishment in autumn 1051.{{sfn|Howarth|1981|p=}} Edward is said to have fought a successful skirmish near [[Southampton]], and then retreated back to Normandy.{{sfn|Barlow|1970 | pp = [https://archive.org/details/edwardconfessor00barl/page/44 44-45] }}{{efn|[[Pauline Stafford]] believes that Edward joined his mother at Winchester and returned to the continent after his brother's death.{{sfn|Stafford|2001|pp=239\u2013240}} }} He thus showed his prudence, but he had some reputation as a soldier in Normandy and Scandinavia.{{sfn|Rex|2008|p=33}}\n\nIn 1037, Harold was accepted as king, and the following year he expelled Emma, who retreated to [[Bruges]].

Edward met \"the thegns of all England\" at Hursteshever, probably modern [[Hurst Spit]] opposite the [[Isle of Wight]]. There he was received as king in return for his oath that he would continue the laws of Cnut.{{sfn|Maddicott|2004| pp= 650\u2013666}} According to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' Edward was sworn in as king alongside Harthacnut, but a diploma issued by Harthacnut in 1042 describes him as the king's brother.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=7}}{{sfn|Baxter|2009|p=101}}\n\n==Early reign==\n[[Image:Edward the Confessor sealed writ.jpg|thumb|A sealed writ of Edward the Confessor]]\nFollowing Harthacnut's death on 8 June 1042, Godwin, the most powerful of the English earls, supported Edward, who succeeded to the throne.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}} The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' describes the popularity he enjoyed at his accession&nbsp;\u2013 \"before he [Harthacnut] was buried, all the people chose Edward as king in London.\"{{sfn|Giles|1914|p=114}} Edward was crowned at [[Winchester Cathedral|the cathedral of Winchester]], the royal seat of the [[Wessex|West Saxons]], on 3 April 1043.{{sfn|Barlow|1970|p=[https://archive.org/details/edwardconfessor00barl/page/61 61]}}\n\nEdward complained that his mother had \"done less for him than he wanted before he became king, and also afterwards\". In November 1043 he rode to Winchester with his three leading earls, [[Leofric, Earl of Mercia|Leofric of Mercia]], Godwin and [[Siward, Earl of Northumbria|Siward of Northumbria]], to deprive her of her property, possibly because she was holding on to treasure which belonged to the king. Her adviser, [[Stigand]], was deprived of his bishopric of [[Bishop of Norwich|Elmham]] in [[East Anglia]]. However, both were soon restored to favour. Emma died in 1052.{{sfn|Rex|2008|pp=48-49}}\nEdward's position when he came to the throne was weak. Effective rule required keeping on terms with the three leading earls, but loyalty to the ancient house of Wessex had been eroded by the period of Danish rule, and only Leofric was descended from a family which had served \u00c6thelred. Siward was probably Danish, and although Godwin was English, he was one of Cnut's new men, married to Cnut's former sister-in-law. However, in his early years Edward restored the traditional strong monarchy, showing himself, in Frank Barlow's view, \"a vigorous and ambitious man, a true son of the impetuous \u00c6thelred and the formidable Emma.\"{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}\n\nIn 1043 Godwin's eldest son [[Sweyn Godwinson|Sweyn]] was appointed to an earldom in the south-west midlands, and on 23 January 1045 Edward married Godwin's daughter [[Edith of Wessex|Edith]]. Soon afterwards, her brother [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]] and her Danish cousin [[Beorn Estrithson]], were also given earldoms in southern England. Godwin and [[House of Godwin|his family]] now ruled subordinately all of [[Southern England]]. However, in 1047 Sweyn was banished for abducting the Abbess of [[Leominster]]. In 1049 he returned to try to regain his earldom, but this was said to have been opposed by Harold and Beorn, probably because they had been given Sweyn's land in his absence. Sweyn murdered his cousin Beorn and went again into exile, and Edward's nephew, [[Ralph the Timid|Ralph]] was given Beorn's earldom, but the following year Sweyn's father was able to secure his reinstatement.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=|loc=maps between pages 116 and 117}}\n\nThe wealth of Edward's lands exceeded that of the greatest earls, but they were scattered among the southern earldoms. He had no personal powerbase, and he does not seem to have attempted to build one. In 1050\u201351 he even paid off the fourteen foreign ships which constituted his standing navy and abolished the tax raised to pay for it.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=26\u201328}} However, in ecclesiastical and foreign affairs he was able to follow his own policy. King [[Magnus the Good|Magnus I of Norway]] aspired to the English throne, and in 1045 and 1046, fearing an invasion, Edward took command of the fleet at Sandwich. Beorn's elder brother, [[Sweyn II of Denmark]] \"submitted himself to Edward as a son\", hoping for his help in his battle with Magnus for control of Denmark, but in 1047 Edward rejected Godwin's demand that he send aid to Sweyn, and it was only Magnus's death in October that saved England from attack and allowed Sweyn to take the Danish throne.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}\n\nModern historians reject the traditional view that Edward mainly employed Norman favourites, but he did have foreigners in his household, including a few Normans, who became unpopular. Chief among them was [[Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges|Robert]], abbot of the Norman abbey of Jumi\u00e8ges, who had known Edward from the 1030s and came to England with him in 1041, becoming bishop of London in 1043. According to the ''Vita Edwardi'', he became \"always the most powerful confidential adviser to the king\".{{sfn|van Houts|2009|p=69}}{{sfn|Gem|2009|p=171}}{{efn|Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges is usually described as Norman, but his origin is unknown, possibly Frankish.{{sfn|van Houts|2009|p=70}} }}\n\n==Crisis of 1051\u201352==\n[[File:EdwardConfesor.jpg|thumb|Edward's seal: SIGILLVM EADWARDI ANGLORVM BASILEI (Seal of Edward crowned/King of the English).]]\nIn ecclesiastical appointments, Edward and his advisers showed a bias against candidates with local connections, and when the clergy and monks of [[Canterbury]] elected a relative of Godwin as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1051, Edward rejected him and appointed Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges, who claimed that Godwin was in illegal possession of some archiepiscopal estates. In September Edward was visited by his brother-in-law, Godgifu's second husband, [[Eustace II, Count of Boulogne|Eustace II of Boulogne]]. His men caused an affray in [[Dover]], and Edward ordered Godwin as earl of Kent to punish the town's burgesses, but he took their side and refused. Edward seized the chance to bring his over-mighty earl to heel. Archbishop Robert accused Godwin of plotting to kill the king, just as he had killed his brother Alfred in 1036, while Leofric and Siward supported the king and called up their vassals. Sweyn and Harold called up their own vassals, but neither side wanted a fight, and Godwin and Sweyn appear to have each given a son as hostage, who were sent to Normandy. The Godwins' position disintegrated as their men were not willing to fight the king. When Stigand, who was acting as intermediary, conveyed the king's jest that Godwin could have his peace if he could restore Alfred and his companions alive and well, Godwin and his sons fled, going to Flanders and Ireland.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}} Edward repudiated Edith and sent her to a nunnery, perhaps because she was childless,{{sfn|Williams|2004a}} and Archbishop Robert urged her divorce.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}\n[[File:Silver penny of Edward the Confessor (YORYM 2000 702) obverse.jpg|thumb|Silver penny of Edward the Confessor]]\nSweyn went on pilgrimage to Jerusalem (dying on his way back), but Godwin and his other sons returned with an army following a year later, and received considerable support, while Leofric and Siward failed to support the king. Both sides were concerned that a civil war would leave the country open to foreign invasion. The king was furious, but he was forced to give way and restore Godwin and Harold to their earldoms, while Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges and other Frenchmen fled, fearing Godwin's vengeance. Edith was restored as queen, and [[Stigand]], who had again acted as an intermediary between the two sides in the crisis, was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in Robert's place. Stigand retained his existing bishopric of Winchester, and his pluralism was to be a continuing source of dispute with the pope.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}{{sfn|Rex|2008|p=107}}\n{{efn|Edward's nephew, [[Ralph the Timid|Earl Ralph]], who had been one of his chief supporters in the crisis of 1051\u201352, may have received Sweyn's marcher earldom of Hereford at this time.{{sfn|Williams|2004b}} However, {{harvnb|Barlow|2006}}, states that Ralph received Hereford on Sweyn's first expulsion in 1047.}}\n\n==Later reign==\nUntil the mid-1050s Edward was able to structure his earldoms so as to prevent the Godwins becoming dominant. Godwin himself died in 1053 and although Harold succeeded to his earldom of Wessex, none of his other brothers were earls at this date. His house was then weaker than it had been since Edward's succession, but a succession of deaths in 1055\u201357 completely changed the picture. In 1055 Siward died but his son was considered too young to command [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]], and Harold's brother, [[Tostig Godwinson|Tostig]] was appointed. In 1057 Leofric and Ralph died, and Leofric's son [[\u00c6lfgar, Earl of Mercia|\u00c6lfgar]] succeeded as Earl of Mercia, while Harold's brother [[Gyrth Godwinson|Gyrth]] succeeded \u00c6lfgar as Earl of East Anglia. The fourth surviving Godwin brother, [[Leofwine Godwinson|Leofwine]], was given an earldom in the south-east carved out of Harold's territory, and Harold received Ralph's territory in compensation. Thus by 1057 the Godwin brothers controlled all of England subordinately apart from [[Mercia]]. It is not known whether Edward approved of this transformation or whether he had to accept it, but from this time he seems to have begun to withdraw from active politics, devoting himself to hunting, which he pursued each day after attending church.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}{{sfn|Baxter|2009|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nIn the 1050s, Edward pursued an aggressive, and generally successful, policy in dealing with [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]. [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm Canmore]] was an exile at Edward's court after his father, [[Duncan I of Scotland|Duncan I]], was in 1040 killed in battle against men led by [[Macbeth, King of Scotland|Macbeth]] who seized the Scottish throne. In 1054 Edward sent Siward to invade Scotland. He defeated Macbeth, and Malcolm, who had accompanied the expedition, gained control of southern Scotland. By 1058 Malcolm had killed Macbeth in battle and taken the Scottish throne. In 1059 he visited Edward, but in 1061 he started raiding Northumbria with the aim of adding it to his territory.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}{{sfn|Barrow|2008}}\n\nIn 1053 Edward ordered the assassination of the south Welsh prince [[Rhys ap Rhydderch]] in reprisal for a raid on England, and Rhys's head was delivered to him.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}} In 1055 [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]] established himself as the ruler of all Wales, and allied himself with \u00c6lfgar of Mercia, who had been outlawed for treason. They defeated Earl Ralph at Hereford, and Harold had to collect forces from nearly all of England to drive the invaders back into Wales. Peace was concluded with the reinstatement of \u00c6lfgar, who was able to succeed as Earl of Mercia on his father's death in 1057. Gruffydd swore an oath to be a faithful under-king of Edward. \u00c6lfgar appears to have died in 1062 and his young son [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Edwin]] was allowed to succeed as Earl of Mercia, but Harold then launched a surprise attack on Gruffydd. He escaped, but when Harold and Tostig attacked again the following year, he retreated and was killed by Welsh enemies. Edward and Harold were then able to impose [[Vassal|vassalage]] on some Welsh princes.{{sfn|Walker|2004}}{{sfn|Williams|2004c}}\n\n[[File:BayeuxTapestryScene25.jpg|thumb|Harold meeting Edward shortly before his death, depicted in [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#25|scene 25 of the Bayeux Tapestry]]]]\nIn October 1065 Harold's brother, Tostig, the earl of Northumbria, was hunting with the king when his [[thegn]]s in Northumbria rebelled against his rule, which they claimed was oppressive, and killed some 200 of his followers. They nominated [[Morcar]], the brother of Edwin of Mercia, as earl, and invited the brothers to join them in marching south. They met Harold at Northampton, and Tostig accused Harold before the king of conspiring with the rebels. Tostig seems to have been a favourite with the king and queen, who demanded that the revolt be suppressed, but neither Harold nor anyone else would fight to support Tostig.\nEdward was forced to submit to his banishment, and the humiliation may have caused a series of strokes which led to his death.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}{{sfn|Aird|2004}} He was too weak to attend the dedication of his new church at Westminster, which was then still incomplete, on 28 December.<ref name=\"HA\" />{{sfn|Fernie|2009|pp=139\u2013143}}\n\nEdward probably entrusted the kingdom to Harold and Edith shortly before he died on 5 January 1066. On 6 January he was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], and Harold was crowned on the same day.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}\n\n==Succession==\nStarting as early as [[William of Malmesbury]] in the early 12th century, historians have puzzled over Edward's intentions for the succession. One school of thought supports the Norman case that Edward always intended William the Conqueror to be his heir, accepting the medieval claim that Edward had already decided to be celibate before he married, but most historians believe that he hoped to have an heir by Edith at least until his quarrel with Godwin in 1051. William may have visited Edward during Godwin's exile, and he is thought to have promised William the succession at this time, but historians disagree how seriously he meant the promise, and whether he later changed his mind.{{efn|Historians' views are discussed in {{harvnb|Baxter|2009|pp=77\u2013118}}, which this section is based on.}}\n\nEdmund Ironside's son, [[Edward the Exile|Edward \u00c6theling]], had the best claim to be considered Edward's heir. He had been taken as a young child to [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], and in 1054 [[Ealdred (archbishop of York)|Bishop Ealdred of Worcester]] visited the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] to secure his return, probably with a view to becoming Edward's heir. The exile returned to England in 1057 with his family, but died almost immediately.{{sfn|Baxter|2009|pp=96\u201398}} His son [[Edgar \u00c6theling|Edgar]], who was then about 6 years old, was brought up at the English court. He was given the designation [[\u00c6theling]], meaning throneworthy, which may mean that Edward considered making him his heir, and he was briefly declared king after Harold's death in 1066.{{sfn|Hooper|2004}} However, Edgar was absent from witness lists of Edward's diplomas, and there is no evidence in the [[Domesday Book]] that he was a substantial landowner, which suggests that he was marginalised at the end of Edward's reign.{{sfn|Baxter|2009|pp=98\u2013103}}\n\nAfter the mid-1050s, Edward seems to have withdrawn from affairs as he became increasingly dependent on the Godwins, and may have become reconciled to the idea that one of them would succeed him. The Normans claimed that Edward sent Harold to Normandy in about 1064 to confirm the promise of the succession to William. The strongest evidence comes from a Norman apologist, [[William of Poitiers]]. According to his account, shortly before the Battle of Hastings, Harold sent William an envoy who admitted that Edward had promised the throne to William but argued that this was over-ridden by his deathbed promise to Harold. In reply, William did not dispute the deathbed promise, but argued that Edward's prior promise to him took precedence.{{sfn|Baxter|2009|pp=103\u2013114}}\n\nIn Stephen Baxter's view, Edward's \"handling of the succession issue was dangerously indecisive, and contributed to one of the greatest catastrophes to which the English have ever succumbed.\"{{sfn|Baxter|2009|p=118}}\n\n==Westminster Abbey==\n\n[[File:BayeuxTapestryScene26.jpg|thumb|Edward's funeral depicted in [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#26|scene 26 of the Bayeux Tapestry]]]]\nEdward's Norman sympathies are most clearly seen in the major building project of his reign, [[Westminster Abbey]], the first Norman [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church in England. This was commenced between 1042 and 1052 as a royal burial church, consecrated on 28 December 1065, completed after his death in about 1090, and demolished in 1245 to make way for Henry III's new building, which still stands. It was very similar to [[Jumi\u00e8ges Abbey]], which was built at the same time. Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges must have been closely involved in both buildings, although it is not clear which is the original and which the copy.{{sfn|Fernie|2009|pp=139\u2013143}}\n\nEdward does not appear to have been interested in books and associated arts, but his abbey played a vital role in the development of English Romanesque architecture, showing that he was an innovating and generous patron of the church.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=23}}\n\n==Canonisation==\n{{Infobox saint\n| name            = Saint Edward the Confessor\n| image           = Edward_the_Confessor.jpg\n| titles          = King of England, Confessor\n| venerated_in    = [[Roman Catholic Church]]<br />[[Anglican Communion]]<br />[[Orthodox Church]]\n| canonized_date  = 7 February 1161\n| canonized_place = Rome\n| canonized_by    = [[Pope Alexander III]]\n| attributes      = King crowned with [[Nimbus (art)|nimbus]], [[sceptre]], [[martlet]]\n| patronage       = Difficult marriages; England <small>(before 1347)</small>; English Royal Family; Kings\n| major_shrine    = [[Westminster Abbey]]\n| feast_day       = 13 October\n}}\n[[File:Wilton diptych; left-hand panel.jpg|thumb|The left panel of the [[Wilton Diptych]], where Edward (centre), with [[Edmund the Martyr]] (left) and [[John the Baptist]], are depicted presenting [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] to the Virgin Mary and Christ Child.]]\nEdward the [[Confessor of the Faith|Confessor]] was the first Anglo-Saxon and the only king of England to be canonised, but he was part of a tradition of (uncanonised) English royal saints, such as [[Eadburh of Winchester]], a daughter of [[Edward the Elder]], [[Edith of Wilton]], a daughter of [[Edgar the Peaceful]], and the boy-king [[Edward the Martyr]].{{sfn|Bozoky|2009|pp=178\u2013179}} With his proneness to fits of rage and his love of hunting, Edward the Confessor is regarded by most historians as an unlikely saint, and his canonisation as political, although some argue that his cult started so early that it must have had something credible to build on.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=29\u201332}}\n\nEdward displayed a worldly attitude in his church appointments. When he appointed Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1051, he chose the leading craftsman [[Spearhafoc]] to replace Robert as [[Bishop of London]]. Robert refused to consecrate him, saying that the pope had forbidden it, but Spearhafoc occupied the bishopric for several months with Edward's support. After the Godwins fled the country, Edward expelled Spearhafoc, who fled with a large store of gold and gems which he had been given to make Edward a crown.{{sfn|Blair|2004}} Stigand was the first archbishop of Canterbury not to be a monk in almost a hundred years, and he was said to have been excommunicated by several popes because he held Canterbury and Winchester in plurality. Several bishops sought consecration abroad because of the irregularity of Stigand's position.{{sfn|Cowdrey|2004}} Edward usually preferred clerks to monks for the most important and richest bishoprics, and he probably accepted gifts from candidates for bishoprics and abbacies. However, his appointments were generally respectable.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}} When [[Odda of Deerhurst]] died without heirs in 1056, Edward seized lands which Odda had granted to [[Pershore Abbey]] and gave them to his Westminster foundation; the historian [[Ann Williams (historian)|Ann Williams]] observes that \"the Confessor did not in the 11th century have the saintly reputation which he later enjoyed, largely through the efforts of the Westminster monks themselves\".{{sfn|Williams|1997|p=11}}\n\nAfter 1066 there was a subdued cult of Edward as a saint, possibly discouraged by the early Norman abbots of Westminster,{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} which gradually increased in the early 12th century.{{sfn|Rex|2008|pp=214\u2013217}} [[Osbert of Clare]], the prior of Westminster Abbey, then started to campaign for Edward's canonisation, aiming to increase the wealth and power of the Abbey. By 1138, he had converted the [[Vita \u00c6dwardi Regis|Vita \u00c6dwardi]], the life of Edward commissioned by his widow, into a conventional saint's life.{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} He seized on an ambiguous passage which might have meant that their marriage was chaste, perhaps to give the idea that Edith's childlessness was not her fault, to claim that Edward had been celibate.{{sfn|Baxter|2009|pp=84\u201385}} In 1139 Osbert went to Rome to petition for Edward's canonisation with the support of [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]], but he lacked the full support of the English hierarchy and Stephen had quarrelled with the church, so [[Pope Innocent II]] postponed a decision, declaring that Osbert lacked sufficient testimonials of Edward's holiness.{{sfn|Bozoky|2009|pp=180\u2013181}}\n\nIn 1159 there was a [[1159 papal election|disputed election to the papacy]], and [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]'s support helped to secure recognition of [[Pope Alexander III]].

This time, it had the full support of the king and the English hierarchy, and a grateful pope issued the bull of canonisation on 7 February 1161,{{sfn|Barlow|2006}} the result of a conjunction of the interests of Westminster Abbey, [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] and [[Pope Alexander III]]{{sfn|Bozoky|2009|p=173}} He was called 'Confessor' as the name for someone who was believed to have lived a saintly life but was not a martyr.{{sfn|Rex|2008|p=226}}\n\nIn the 1230s King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] became attached to the cult of Saint Edward, and he commissioned a new life by [[Matthew Paris]].{{sfn|Carpenter|2007|pp=865\u2013891}} Henry also constructed a grand new tomb for Edward in a rebuilt Westminster Abbey in 1269.<ref name=\"HA\" /> He named his [[Edward I of England|eldest son]] after him.\n\nUntil about 1350, [[Edmund the Martyr]], [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] and Edward the Confessor were regarded as English national saints, but Edward III preferred the more war-like figure of St George, and in 1348 he established the [[Order of the Garter]] with St George as its patron.

According to the Ramsey ''Liber Benefactorum'', the [[Ramsey Abbey|monastery's]] abbot decided that it would be dangerous to publicly contest a claim brought by \"a certain powerful man\", but he claimed he was able to procure a favourable judgment by giving Edward twenty marks in gold and his wife five marks.{{sfn|Molyneaux|2015|p=218}}\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Encomium Emmae Reginae]]'', encomium to Edward's mother\n*''[[Vita \u00c6dwardi Regis]]'', life commissioned by Edward's wife\n*''[[J\u00e1tvar\u00f0ar Saga]]'', Icelandic saga about the king\n* [[List of monarchs of Wessex]]\n* [[List of Catholic saints]]\n* [[Portal:Catholicism/Patron Archive/October 13|Saint Edward the Confessor, patron saint archive]]\n* [[St Edward's Crown]]\n* [[Burial places of British royalty]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"HA\">{{cite web|title=History of Westminster Abbey|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/abbey-history|website=Westminster Abbey|accessdate=5 November 2016}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"TA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/visit-us/highlights/edward-the-confessor|title=Visiting the Abbey : Edward The Confessor|website=Westminster Abbey|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616025642/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/visit-us/highlights/edward-the-confessor|archive-date=2011-06-16}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"ET\">{{cite web|url=https://www.westminster-abbey.org/worship-music/services-times/edwardtide|title=Edwardtide|website=Westminster Abbey|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"LO\">{{Cite web |title=Liturgical Calendar : October 2020 |author= |work=The Catholic Church in England and Wales |date= |access-date=13 March 2020 |url= http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Calendar/2020/Oct.shtml |quote=}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"CE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/the-calendar/holydays.aspx|title=Holy Days|website=Church of England|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301005720/https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/the-calendar/holydays.aspx|archive-date=2016-03-01}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"CS\">{{Cite web |title=Saint Edward the Confessor |author= |work=CatholicSaints.Info |date= |access-date=13 March 2020 |url= http://catholicsaints.info/saint-edward-the-confessor/ |quote=}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n*{{cite ODNB|last=Aird|first= William M.|id=27571 |title=Tostig|date=23 September 2004|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Barlow|first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Barlow (historian)|title=Edward the Confessor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6yN5HR4Njc8C&pg=PA98|year=1970|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-01671-2}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Barlow|first=Frank |title=The Life of King Edward who Rests at Westminster|year=1992|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-820203-5|title-link=Vita \u00c6dwardi Regis|id={{google books|id=BLDoMHk4AZ8C|plain-url=yes}} }}\n*{{cite ODNB|last=Barlow|first= Frank|id=5442 |title=Osbert of Clare|date=23 September 2004|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite ODNB| last = Barlow | first = Frank | title= Edward (St Edward; known as Edward the Confessor) | | id=8516 | date = 25 May 2006|author-link=Frank Barlow (historian)|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite ODNB|last=Barrow|first= G.

Usually considered the last king of the [[House of Wessex]], he ruled from 1042 to 1066.\n\nEdward was the son of [[\u00c6thelred the Unready]] and [[Emma of Normandy]].  He succeeded [[Cnut the Great]]'s son&nbsp;\u2013 and his own half brother&nbsp;\u2013 [[Harthacnut]].  He restored the rule of the House of Wessex after the period of Danish rule since Cnut (better known as Canute) conquered England in 1016. When Edward died in 1066, he was succeeded by [[Harold Godwinson]], who was defeated and killed in the same year by the [[Normans]] under [[William the Conqueror]] at the [[Battle of Hastings]]. [[Edgar \u00c6theling|Edgar the \u00c6theling]], who was of the House of Wessex, was proclaimed king after the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066, but never ruled and was deposed after about eight weeks.\n\nHistorians disagree about Edward's fairly long (24-year) reign. His nickname reflects the traditional image of him as unworldly and pious. [[Confessor of the Faith|Confessor]] reflects his reputation as a [[saint]] who did not suffer [[Martyr|martyrdom]], as opposed to King [[Edward the Martyr]]. Some portray Edward the Confessor's reign as leading to the disintegration of royal power in England and the advance in power of the [[House of Godwin]], due to the infighting that began after his heirless  death. Biographers [[Frank Barlow (historian)|Frank Barlow]] and Peter Rex, on the other hand, portray Edward as a successful king, one who was energetic, resourceful and sometimes ruthless; they argue that the Norman conquest shortly after his death tarnished his image.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}{{sfn|Rex|2008|p=224}} However, Richard Mortimer argues that the return of the Godwins from exile in 1052 \"meant the effective end of his exercise of power\", citing Edward's reduced activity as implying \"a withdrawal from affairs\".{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=}}\n\nAbout a century later, in 1161, [[Pope Alexander III]] [[Canonization|canonised]] the king. Saint Edward was one of England's national saints until [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]] adopted [[Saint George]] as the national patron saint in about 1350. Saint Edward's [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] is 13 October, celebrated by both the [[Church of England]] and the [[Catholic Church]] in [[England and Wales]].\n\n==Early years and exile==\nEdward was the seventh son of [[\u00c6thelred the Unready]], and the first by his second wife, [[Emma of Normandy]]. Edward was born between 1003 and 1005 in [[Islip, Oxfordshire]],{{sfn|Barlow|2006}} and is first recorded as a 'witness' to two charters in 1005. He had one full brother, [[Alfred Aetheling|Alfred]], and a sister, [[Godgifu, daughter of \u00c6thelred the Unready|Godgifu]]. In charters he was always listed behind his older half-brothers, showing that he ranked behind them.{{sfn|Keynes|2009|p=49}}\n\nDuring his childhood, England was the target of [[Vikings|Viking]] raids and invasions under [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] and his son, Cnut. Following Sweyn's seizure of the throne in 1013, Emma fled to [[Normandy]], followed by Edward and Alfred, and then by \u00c6thelred. Sweyn died in February 1014, and leading Englishmen invited \u00c6thelred back on condition that he promised to rule 'more justly' than before. \u00c6thelred agreed, sending Edward back with his ambassadors.{{sfn|Rex|2008|pp=13, 19}} \u00c6thelred died in April 1016, and he was succeeded by Edward's older half-brother [[Edmund Ironside]], who carried on the fight against Sweyn's son, Cnut. According to Scandinavian tradition, Edward fought alongside Edmund; as Edward was at most thirteen years old at the time, the story is disputed.{{sfn|Barlow|1970 | p = [https://archive.org/details/edwardconfessor00barl/page/29 29\u201336] }}{{sfn|Keynes|2009|p=56}} Edmund died in November 1016, and Cnut became undisputed king. Edward then again went into exile with his brother and sister; in 1017 his mother married Cnut.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}} In the same year Cnut had Edward's last surviving elder half-brother, [[Eadwig \u00c6theling|Eadwig]], executed,{{sfn|Panton|2011|p=21}} leaving Edward as the leading Anglo-Saxon claimant to the throne.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n[[File:Edward the Confessor Penny.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Penny]] of Edward the Confessor]]\nEdward spent a quarter of a century in exile, probably mainly in Normandy, although there is no evidence of his location until the early 1030s. He probably received support from his sister Godgifu, who married [[Drogo of Mantes]], count of [[Vexin]] in about 1024. In the early 1030s, Edward witnessed four charters in Normandy, signing two of them as king of England. According to the Norman chronicler, [[William of Jumi\u00e8ges]], [[Robert I, Duke of Normandy]] attempted an invasion of England to place Edward on the throne in about 1034, but it was blown off course to [[Jersey]]. He also received support for his claim to the throne from a number of continental abbots, particularly [[Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges|Robert]], abbot of the [[Jumi\u00e8ges Abbey|Norman abbey of Jumi\u00e8ges]], who was later to become Edward's Archbishop of Canterbury.{{sfn|van Houts|2009|pp= 63\u201375}} Edward was said to have developed an intense personal piety during this period, but modern historians regard this as a product of the later medieval campaign for his canonisation. In Frank Barlow's view \"in his lifestyle would seem to have been that of a typical member of the rustic nobility\".{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}{{sfn|Howarth|1981|p=}} He appeared to have a slim prospect of acceding to the English throne during this period, and his ambitious mother was more interested in supporting Harthacnut, her son by Cnut.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}{{sfn|Rex|2008|p=28}}\n\nCnut died in 1035, and Harthacnut succeeded him as king of [[Denmark]]. It is unclear whether he intended to keep England as well, but he was too busy defending his position in Denmark to come to England to assert his claim to the throne. It was therefore decided that his elder half-brother [[Harold Harefoot]] should act as regent, while Emma held Wessex on Harthacnut's behalf.{{sfn|Lawson|2004}} In 1036 Edward and his brother Alfred separately came to England. Emma later claimed that they came in response to a letter forged by Harold inviting them to visit her, but historians believe that she probably did invite them in an effort to counter Harold's growing popularity.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}{{sfn|Rex|2008|pp=34\u201335}} Alfred was captured by [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex]] who turned him over to [[Harold Harefoot]]. He had Alfred blinded by forcing red-hot pokers into his eyes to make him unsuitable for kingship, and Alfred died soon after as a result of his wounds. The murder is thought to be the source of much of Edward's later hatred for the Earl and one of the primary reasons for Godwin's banishment in autumn 1051.{{sfn|Howarth|1981|p=}} Edward is said to have fought a successful skirmish near [[Southampton]], and then retreated back to Normandy.{{sfn|Barlow|1970 | pp = [https://archive.org/details/edwardconfessor00barl/page/44 44-45] }}{{efn|[[Pauline Stafford]] believes that Edward joined his mother at Winchester and returned to the continent after his brother's death.{{sfn|Stafford|2001|pp=239\u2013240}} }} He thus showed his prudence, but he had some reputation as a soldier in Normandy and Scandinavia.{{sfn|Rex|2008|p=33}}\n\nIn 1037, Harold was accepted as king, and the following year he expelled Emma, who retreated to [[Bruges]].

Edward met \"the thegns of all England\" at Hursteshever, probably modern [[Hurst Spit]] opposite the [[Isle of Wight]]. There he was received as king in return for his oath that he would continue the laws of Cnut.{{sfn|Maddicott|2004| pp= 650\u2013666}} According to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' Edward was sworn in as king alongside Harthacnut, but a diploma issued by Harthacnut in 1042 describes him as the king's brother.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=7}}{{sfn|Baxter|2009|p=101}}\n\n==Early reign==\n[[Image:Edward the Confessor sealed writ.jpg|thumb|A sealed writ of Edward the Confessor]]\nFollowing Harthacnut's death on 8 June 1042, Godwin, the most powerful of the English earls, supported Edward, who succeeded to the throne.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}} The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' describes the popularity he enjoyed at his accession&nbsp;\u2013 \"before he [Harthacnut] was buried, all the people chose Edward as king in London.\"{{sfn|Giles|1914|p=114}} Edward was crowned at [[Winchester Cathedral|the cathedral of Winchester]], the royal seat of the [[Wessex|West Saxons]], on 3 April 1043.{{sfn|Barlow|1970|p=[https://archive.org/details/edwardconfessor00barl/page/61 61]}}\n\nEdward complained that his mother had \"done less for him than he wanted before he became king, and also afterwards\". In November 1043 he rode to Winchester with his three leading earls, [[Leofric, Earl of Mercia|Leofric of Mercia]], Godwin and [[Siward, Earl of Northumbria|Siward of Northumbria]], to deprive her of her property, possibly because she was holding on to treasure which belonged to the king. Her adviser, [[Stigand]], was deprived of his bishopric of [[Bishop of Norwich|Elmham]] in [[East Anglia]]. However, both were soon restored to favour. Emma died in 1052.{{sfn|Rex|2008|pp=48-49}}\nEdward's position when he came to the throne was weak. Effective rule required keeping on terms with the three leading earls, but loyalty to the ancient house of Wessex had been eroded by the period of Danish rule, and only Leofric was descended from a family which had served \u00c6thelred. Siward was probably Danish, and although Godwin was English, he was one of Cnut's new men, married to Cnut's former sister-in-law. However, in his early years Edward restored the traditional strong monarchy, showing himself, in Frank Barlow's view, \"a vigorous and ambitious man, a true son of the impetuous \u00c6thelred and the formidable Emma.\"{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}\n\nIn 1043 Godwin's eldest son [[Sweyn Godwinson|Sweyn]] was appointed to an earldom in the south-west midlands, and on 23 January 1045 Edward married Godwin's daughter [[Edith of Wessex|Edith]]. Soon afterwards, her brother [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]] and her Danish cousin [[Beorn Estrithson]], were also given earldoms in southern England. Godwin and [[House of Godwin|his family]] now ruled subordinately all of [[Southern England]]. However, in 1047 Sweyn was banished for abducting the Abbess of [[Leominster]]. In 1049 he returned to try to regain his earldom, but this was said to have been opposed by Harold and Beorn, probably because they had been given Sweyn's land in his absence. Sweyn murdered his cousin Beorn and went again into exile, and Edward's nephew, [[Ralph the Timid|Ralph]] was given Beorn's earldom, but the following year Sweyn's father was able to secure his reinstatement.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=|loc=maps between pages 116 and 117}}\n\nThe wealth of Edward's lands exceeded that of the greatest earls, but they were scattered among the southern earldoms. He had no personal powerbase, and he does not seem to have attempted to build one. In 1050\u201351 he even paid off the fourteen foreign ships which constituted his standing navy and abolished the tax raised to pay for it.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=26\u201328}} However, in ecclesiastical and foreign affairs he was able to follow his own policy. King [[Magnus the Good|Magnus I of Norway]] aspired to the English throne, and in 1045 and 1046, fearing an invasion, Edward took command of the fleet at Sandwich. Beorn's elder brother, [[Sweyn II of Denmark]] \"submitted himself to Edward as a son\", hoping for his help in his battle with Magnus for control of Denmark, but in 1047 Edward rejected Godwin's demand that he send aid to Sweyn, and it was only Magnus's death in October that saved England from attack and allowed Sweyn to take the Danish throne.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}\n\nModern historians reject the traditional view that Edward mainly employed Norman favourites, but he did have foreigners in his household, including a few Normans, who became unpopular. Chief among them was [[Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges|Robert]], abbot of the Norman abbey of Jumi\u00e8ges, who had known Edward from the 1030s and came to England with him in 1041, becoming bishop of London in 1043. According to the ''Vita Edwardi'', he became \"always the most powerful confidential adviser to the king\".{{sfn|van Houts|2009|p=69}}{{sfn|Gem|2009|p=171}}{{efn|Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges is usually described as Norman, but his origin is unknown, possibly Frankish.{{sfn|van Houts|2009|p=70}} }}\n\n==Crisis of 1051\u201352==\n[[File:EdwardConfesor.jpg|thumb|Edward's seal: SIGILLVM EADWARDI ANGLORVM BASILEI (Seal of Edward crowned/King of the English).]]\nIn ecclesiastical appointments, Edward and his advisers showed a bias against candidates with local connections, and when the clergy and monks of [[Canterbury]] elected a relative of Godwin as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1051, Edward rejected him and appointed Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges, who claimed that Godwin was in illegal possession of some archiepiscopal estates. In September Edward was visited by his brother-in-law, Godgifu's second husband, [[Eustace II, Count of Boulogne|Eustace II of Boulogne]]. His men caused an affray in [[Dover]], and Edward ordered Godwin as earl of Kent to punish the town's burgesses, but he took their side and refused. Edward seized the chance to bring his over-mighty earl to heel. Archbishop Robert accused Godwin of plotting to kill the king, just as he had killed his brother Alfred in 1036, while Leofric and Siward supported the king and called up their vassals. Sweyn and Harold called up their own vassals, but neither side wanted a fight, and Godwin and Sweyn appear to have each given a son as hostage, who were sent to Normandy. The Godwins' position disintegrated as their men were not willing to fight the king. When Stigand, who was acting as intermediary, conveyed the king's jest that Godwin could have his peace if he could restore Alfred and his companions alive and well, Godwin and his sons fled, going to Flanders and Ireland.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}} Edward repudiated Edith and sent her to a nunnery, perhaps because she was childless,{{sfn|Williams|2004a}} and Archbishop Robert urged her divorce.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}\n[[File:Silver penny of Edward the Confessor (YORYM 2000 702) obverse.jpg|thumb|Silver penny of Edward the Confessor]]\nSweyn went on pilgrimage to Jerusalem (dying on his way back), but Godwin and his other sons returned with an army following a year later, and received considerable support, while Leofric and Siward failed to support the king. Both sides were concerned that a civil war would leave the country open to foreign invasion. The king was furious, but he was forced to give way and restore Godwin and Harold to their earldoms, while Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges and other Frenchmen fled, fearing Godwin's vengeance. Edith was restored as queen, and [[Stigand]], who had again acted as an intermediary between the two sides in the crisis, was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in Robert's place. Stigand retained his existing bishopric of Winchester, and his pluralism was to be a continuing source of dispute with the pope.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}{{sfn|Rex|2008|p=107}}\n{{efn|Edward's nephew, [[Ralph the Timid|Earl Ralph]], who had been one of his chief supporters in the crisis of 1051\u201352, may have received Sweyn's marcher earldom of Hereford at this time.{{sfn|Williams|2004b}} However, {{harvnb|Barlow|2006}}, states that Ralph received Hereford on Sweyn's first expulsion in 1047.}}\n\n==Later reign==\nUntil the mid-1050s Edward was able to structure his earldoms so as to prevent the Godwins becoming dominant. Godwin himself died in 1053 and although Harold succeeded to his earldom of Wessex, none of his other brothers were earls at this date. His house was then weaker than it had been since Edward's succession, but a succession of deaths in 1055\u201357 completely changed the picture. In 1055 Siward died but his son was considered too young to command [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]], and Harold's brother, [[Tostig Godwinson|Tostig]] was appointed. In 1057 Leofric and Ralph died, and Leofric's son [[\u00c6lfgar, Earl of Mercia|\u00c6lfgar]] succeeded as Earl of Mercia, while Harold's brother [[Gyrth Godwinson|Gyrth]] succeeded \u00c6lfgar as Earl of East Anglia. The fourth surviving Godwin brother, [[Leofwine Godwinson|Leofwine]], was given an earldom in the south-east carved out of Harold's territory, and Harold received Ralph's territory in compensation. Thus by 1057 the Godwin brothers controlled all of England subordinately apart from [[Mercia]]. It is not known whether Edward approved of this transformation or whether he had to accept it, but from this time he seems to have begun to withdraw from active politics, devoting himself to hunting, which he pursued each day after attending church.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}{{sfn|Baxter|2009|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nIn the 1050s, Edward pursued an aggressive, and generally successful, policy in dealing with [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]. [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm Canmore]] was an exile at Edward's court after his father, [[Duncan I of Scotland|Duncan I]], was in 1040 killed in battle against men led by [[Macbeth, King of Scotland|Macbeth]] who seized the Scottish throne. In 1054 Edward sent Siward to invade Scotland. He defeated Macbeth, and Malcolm, who had accompanied the expedition, gained control of southern Scotland. By 1058 Malcolm had killed Macbeth in battle and taken the Scottish throne. In 1059 he visited Edward, but in 1061 he started raiding Northumbria with the aim of adding it to his territory.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}{{sfn|Barrow|2008}}\n\nIn 1053 Edward ordered the assassination of the south Welsh prince [[Rhys ap Rhydderch]] in reprisal for a raid on England, and Rhys's head was delivered to him.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}} In 1055 [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]] established himself as the ruler of all Wales, and allied himself with \u00c6lfgar of Mercia, who had been outlawed for treason. They defeated Earl Ralph at Hereford, and Harold had to collect forces from nearly all of England to drive the invaders back into Wales. Peace was concluded with the reinstatement of \u00c6lfgar, who was able to succeed as Earl of Mercia on his father's death in 1057. Gruffydd swore an oath to be a faithful under-king of Edward. \u00c6lfgar appears to have died in 1062 and his young son [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Edwin]] was allowed to succeed as Earl of Mercia, but Harold then launched a surprise attack on Gruffydd. He escaped, but when Harold and Tostig attacked again the following year, he retreated and was killed by Welsh enemies. Edward and Harold were then able to impose [[Vassal|vassalage]] on some Welsh princes.{{sfn|Walker|2004}}{{sfn|Williams|2004c}}\n\n[[File:BayeuxTapestryScene25.jpg|thumb|Harold meeting Edward shortly before his death, depicted in [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#25|scene 25 of the Bayeux Tapestry]]]]\nIn October 1065 Harold's brother, Tostig, the earl of Northumbria, was hunting with the king when his [[thegn]]s in Northumbria rebelled against his rule, which they claimed was oppressive, and killed some 200 of his followers. They nominated [[Morcar]], the brother of Edwin of Mercia, as earl, and invited the brothers to join them in marching south. They met Harold at Northampton, and Tostig accused Harold before the king of conspiring with the rebels. Tostig seems to have been a favourite with the king and queen, who demanded that the revolt be suppressed, but neither Harold nor anyone else would fight to support Tostig.\nEdward was forced to submit to his banishment, and the humiliation may have caused a series of strokes which led to his death.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}{{sfn|Aird|2004}} He was too weak to attend the dedication of his new church at Westminster, which was then still incomplete, on 28 December.<ref name=\"HA\" />{{sfn|Fernie|2009|pp=139\u2013143}}\n\nEdward probably entrusted the kingdom to Harold and Edith shortly before he died on 5 January 1066. On 6 January he was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], and Harold was crowned on the same day.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}}\n\n==Succession==\nStarting as early as [[William of Malmesbury]] in the early 12th century, historians have puzzled over Edward's intentions for the succession. One school of thought supports the Norman case that Edward always intended William the Conqueror to be his heir, accepting the medieval claim that Edward had already decided to be celibate before he married, but most historians believe that he hoped to have an heir by Edith at least until his quarrel with Godwin in 1051. William may have visited Edward during Godwin's exile, and he is thought to have promised William the succession at this time, but historians disagree how seriously he meant the promise, and whether he later changed his mind.{{efn|Historians' views are discussed in {{harvnb|Baxter|2009|pp=77\u2013118}}, which this section is based on.}}\n\nEdmund Ironside's son, [[Edward the Exile|Edward \u00c6theling]], had the best claim to be considered Edward's heir. He had been taken as a young child to [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], and in 1054 [[Ealdred (archbishop of York)|Bishop Ealdred of Worcester]] visited the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] to secure his return, probably with a view to becoming Edward's heir. The exile returned to England in 1057 with his family, but died almost immediately.{{sfn|Baxter|2009|pp=96\u201398}} His son [[Edgar \u00c6theling|Edgar]], who was then about 6 years old, was brought up at the English court. He was given the designation [[\u00c6theling]], meaning throneworthy, which may mean that Edward considered making him his heir, and he was briefly declared king after Harold's death in 1066.{{sfn|Hooper|2004}} However, Edgar was absent from witness lists of Edward's diplomas, and there is no evidence in the [[Domesday Book]] that he was a substantial landowner, which suggests that he was marginalised at the end of Edward's reign.{{sfn|Baxter|2009|pp=98\u2013103}}\n\nAfter the mid-1050s, Edward seems to have withdrawn from affairs as he became increasingly dependent on the Godwins, and may have become reconciled to the idea that one of them would succeed him. The Normans claimed that Edward sent Harold to Normandy in about 1064 to confirm the promise of the succession to William. The strongest evidence comes from a Norman apologist, [[William of Poitiers]]. According to his account, shortly before the Battle of Hastings, Harold sent William an envoy who admitted that Edward had promised the throne to William but argued that this was over-ridden by his deathbed promise to Harold. In reply, William did not dispute the deathbed promise, but argued that Edward's prior promise to him took precedence.{{sfn|Baxter|2009|pp=103\u2013114}}\n\nIn Stephen Baxter's view, Edward's \"handling of the succession issue was dangerously indecisive, and contributed to one of the greatest catastrophes to which the English have ever succumbed.\"{{sfn|Baxter|2009|p=118}}\n\n==Westminster Abbey==\n\n[[File:BayeuxTapestryScene26.jpg|thumb|Edward's funeral depicted in [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#26|scene 26 of the Bayeux Tapestry]]]]\nEdward's Norman sympathies are most clearly seen in the major building project of his reign, [[Westminster Abbey]], the first Norman [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church in England. This was commenced between 1042 and 1052 as a royal burial church, consecrated on 28 December 1065, completed after his death in about 1090, and demolished in 1245 to make way for Henry III's new building, which still stands. It was very similar to [[Jumi\u00e8ges Abbey]], which was built at the same time. Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges must have been closely involved in both buildings, although it is not clear which is the original and which the copy.{{sfn|Fernie|2009|pp=139\u2013143}}\n\nEdward does not appear to have been interested in books and associated arts, but his abbey played a vital role in the development of English Romanesque architecture, showing that he was an innovating and generous patron of the church.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=23}}\n\n==Canonisation==\n{{Infobox saint\n| name            = Saint Edward the Confessor\n| image           = Edward_the_Confessor.jpg\n| titles          = King of England, Confessor\n| venerated_in    = [[Roman Catholic Church]]<br />[[Anglican Communion]]<br />[[Orthodox Church]]\n| canonized_date  = 7 February 1161\n| canonized_place = Rome\n| canonized_by    = [[Pope Alexander III]]\n| attributes      = King crowned with [[Nimbus (art)|nimbus]], [[sceptre]], [[martlet]]\n| patronage       = Difficult marriages; England <small>(before 1347)</small>; English Royal Family; Kings\n| major_shrine    = [[Westminster Abbey]]\n| feast_day       = 13 October\n}}\n[[File:Wilton diptych; left-hand panel.jpg|thumb|The left panel of the [[Wilton Diptych]], where Edward (centre), with [[Edmund the Martyr]] (left) and [[John the Baptist]], are depicted presenting [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] to the Virgin Mary and Christ Child.]]\nEdward the [[Confessor of the Faith|Confessor]] was the first Anglo-Saxon and the only king of England to be canonised, but he was part of a tradition of (uncanonised) English royal saints, such as [[Eadburh of Winchester]], a daughter of [[Edward the Elder]], [[Edith of Wilton]], a daughter of [[Edgar the Peaceful]], and the boy-king [[Edward the Martyr]].{{sfn|Bozoky|2009|pp=178\u2013179}} With his proneness to fits of rage and his love of hunting, Edward the Confessor is regarded by most historians as an unlikely saint, and his canonisation as political, although some argue that his cult started so early that it must have had something credible to build on.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=29\u201332}}\n\nEdward displayed a worldly attitude in his church appointments. When he appointed Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1051, he chose the leading craftsman [[Spearhafoc]] to replace Robert as [[Bishop of London]]. Robert refused to consecrate him, saying that the pope had forbidden it, but Spearhafoc occupied the bishopric for several months with Edward's support. After the Godwins fled the country, Edward expelled Spearhafoc, who fled with a large store of gold and gems which he had been given to make Edward a crown.{{sfn|Blair|2004}} Stigand was the first archbishop of Canterbury not to be a monk in almost a hundred years, and he was said to have been excommunicated by several popes because he held Canterbury and Winchester in plurality. Several bishops sought consecration abroad because of the irregularity of Stigand's position.{{sfn|Cowdrey|2004}} Edward usually preferred clerks to monks for the most important and richest bishoprics, and he probably accepted gifts from candidates for bishoprics and abbacies. However, his appointments were generally respectable.{{sfn|Barlow|2006}} When [[Odda of Deerhurst]] died without heirs in 1056, Edward seized lands which Odda had granted to [[Pershore Abbey]] and gave them to his Westminster foundation; the historian [[Ann Williams (historian)|Ann Williams]] observes that \"the Confessor did not in the 11th century have the saintly reputation which he later enjoyed, largely through the efforts of the Westminster monks themselves\".{{sfn|Williams|1997|p=11}}\n\nAfter 1066 there was a subdued cult of Edward as a saint, possibly discouraged by the early Norman abbots of Westminster,{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} which gradually increased in the early 12th century.{{sfn|Rex|2008|pp=214\u2013217}} [[Osbert of Clare]], the prior of Westminster Abbey, then started to campaign for Edward's canonisation, aiming to increase the wealth and power of the Abbey. By 1138, he had converted the [[Vita \u00c6dwardi Regis|Vita \u00c6dwardi]], the life of Edward commissioned by his widow, into a conventional saint's life.{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} He seized on an ambiguous passage which might have meant that their marriage was chaste, perhaps to give the idea that Edith's childlessness was not her fault, to claim that Edward had been celibate.{{sfn|Baxter|2009|pp=84\u201385}} In 1139 Osbert went to Rome to petition for Edward's canonisation with the support of [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]], but he lacked the full support of the English hierarchy and Stephen had quarrelled with the church, so [[Pope Innocent II]] postponed a decision, declaring that Osbert lacked sufficient testimonials of Edward's holiness.{{sfn|Bozoky|2009|pp=180\u2013181}}\n\nIn 1159 there was a [[1159 papal election|disputed election to the papacy]], and [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]'s support helped to secure recognition of [[Pope Alexander III]].

This time, it had the full support of the king and the English hierarchy, and a grateful pope issued the bull of canonisation on 7 February 1161,{{sfn|Barlow|2006}} the result of a conjunction of the interests of Westminster Abbey, [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] and [[Pope Alexander III]]{{sfn|Bozoky|2009|p=173}} He was called 'Confessor' as the name for someone who was believed to have lived a saintly life but was not a martyr.{{sfn|Rex|2008|p=226}}\n\nIn the 1230s King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] became attached to the cult of Saint Edward, and he commissioned a new life by [[Matthew Paris]].{{sfn|Carpenter|2007|pp=865\u2013891}} Henry also constructed a grand new tomb for Edward in a rebuilt Westminster Abbey in 1269.<ref name=\"HA\" /> He named his [[Edward I of England|eldest son]] after him.\n\nUntil about 1350, [[Edmund the Martyr]], [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] and Edward the Confessor were regarded as English national saints, but Edward III preferred the more war-like figure of St George, and in 1348 he established the [[Order of the Garter]] with St George as its patron.

At that time, Manassas Junction was little more than a railroad crossing, but a strategic one, with rails leading to [[Richmond, Virginia]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[Shenandoah Valley]].

The Manassas Regional Airport is the busiest general aviation airport in the Commonwealth of Virginia with more than 415 based aircraft and 26 businesses based onsite ranging from charter companies, avionics, maintenance, flight schools and aircraft services.\n\n[[File:Cardinal arriving in Manassas.jpg|thumb|right|{{w|Amtrak}} 50, the ''{{w|Cardinal (train)|Cardinal}}'', is arriving in {{w|Manassas station}} on a Friday evening. The train left {{w|Chicago}} last evening and is on its way to {{w|New York City}}. The station is shared with {{w|Virginia Railway Express}} and hosts the city's visitors center.]]\n\n===Rail transportation===\nManassas began life as ''Manassas Junction'', so named for the railroad junction between the [[Orange and Alexandria Railroad]] and the [[Manassas Gap Railroad]].  The O&A owned the railway from Alexandria through Manassas to points south, ending in [[Orange, Virginia]], while the MGRR was an independent line constructed from Manassas Junction through the [[Manassas Gap]] westward. In addition Manassas was the site of the first large scale military use of railroad transportation.\n\nThese original routes are now owned by the [[Norfolk Southern]] railroad. [[Amtrak]] and the [[Virginia Railway Express]] (VRE) provide regular inter-city and commuter service to the city and surrounding area on the tracks owned by NS. [[Manassas station]] is served by VRE and three Amtrak routes - the [[New York City]] to [[Chicago]] [[Cardinal (Amtrak)|''Cardinal'']], [[Boston]] to [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]] ''[[Northeast Regional]]'', and New York to [[New Orleans]] [[Crescent (Amtrak)|''Crescent'']].\n\nThe train station was also used for the cover photo for the [[Manassas (album)]].\n\n==Education==\n\n=== Public Education ===\nThe City of Manassas is served by the [[Manassas City Public Schools]]. There are five elementary schools in Manassas, two intermediate school, one middle school, and one high school.  In 2006, Mayfield Intermediate School opened, serving students in fifth and sixth grade. Due to growth, Baldwin Intermediate School opened in September 2017, also serving 5th and 6th graders.\n\nSome schools in the [[Prince William County Public Schools]] district have Manassas addresses, though they are located, and serve areas, outside the Manassas city limits.\n\nSeton School, a private Roman Catholic junior and senior high school affiliated with the [[Diocese of Arlington]], provides Catholic education from its Manassas location.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://setonschool.net/|title=Welcome to Seton School - Private Catholic High School|website=Seton School Manassas|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>  The All Saints Catholic School at the All Saints Parish provides Catholic Education from pre-K through 8th grade.

He was educated at [[Ross-on-Wye]].\n\nHe was taught drawing by his father, and from 1750 to 1756 was apprenticed to a woodcarver, William Barlow, in London. In his spare time he worked at sculpture, spending his evenings in the studio of the Flemish \u00e9migr\u00e9 sculptor [[Peter Scheemakers]]. During this period he is known to have worked for the architect [[William Kent]]. Before 1772, when he obtained a travelling [[studentship]] given by the [[Royal Academy]] and proceeded to Rome, he had already exhibited several fine works.{{sfn|Anonymous|1911}}\n\nReturning to England in 1779 he found that the taste for classical poetry, long the source of his inspiration, no longer existed, and he spent two years in [[Saint Petersburg]], being employed by [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]], who purchased his ''Cupid Tormenting a Butterfly''. On his return he modelled his colossal ''[[Achilles]] Mourning the Loss of [[Briseis]]'', a work full of force and passion; and then he was elected, in 1784, an associate of the [[Royal Academy]] and in the following year a full member.{{sfn|Anonymous|1911}}\n\nBanks died in London on 2 February 1805.{{sfn|Anonymous|1911}} He is buried in Paddington Churchyard.\n\nA monument to his memory was also erected in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>Dictionary of British Sculptors, 1660\u20131851, Rupert Gunnis</ref>\n\n==Works==\nAmong other works in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] are the monuments to Captain [[George Blagden Westcott]] and Captain Richard Burgess, and in [[Westminster Abbey]] to Sir [[Eyre Coote (East India Company officer)|Eyre Coote]], General Loten, [[Sir Clifton Wintringham]] and [[William Woollett]].

He was educated at [[Ross-on-Wye]].\n\nHe was taught drawing by his father, and from 1750 to 1756 was apprenticed to a woodcarver, William Barlow, in London. In his spare time he worked at sculpture, spending his evenings in the studio of the Flemish \u00e9migr\u00e9 sculptor [[Peter Scheemakers]]. During this period he is known to have worked for the architect [[William Kent]]. Before 1772, when he obtained a travelling [[studentship]] given by the [[Royal Academy]] and proceeded to Rome, he had already exhibited several fine works.{{sfn|Anonymous|1911}}\n\nReturning to England in 1779 he found that the taste for classical poetry, long the source of his inspiration, no longer existed, and he spent two years in [[Saint Petersburg]], being employed by [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]], who purchased his ''Cupid Tormenting a Butterfly''. On his return he modelled his colossal ''[[Achilles]] Mourning the Loss of [[Briseis]]'', a work full of force and passion; and then he was elected, in 1784, an associate of the [[Royal Academy]] and in the following year a full member.{{sfn|Anonymous|1911}}\n\nBanks died in London on 2 February 1805.{{sfn|Anonymous|1911}} He is buried in Paddington Churchyard.\n\nA monument to his memory was also erected in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>Dictionary of British Sculptors, 1660\u20131851, Rupert Gunnis</ref>\n\n==Works==\nAmong other works in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] are the monuments to Captain [[George Blagden Westcott]] and Captain Richard Burgess, and in [[Westminster Abbey]] to Sir [[Eyre Coote (East India Company officer)|Eyre Coote]], General Loten, [[Sir Clifton Wintringham]] and [[William Woollett]].

In 1991, student Jill Stewart started IU Dance Marathon in honor of her friend, Ryan White, who died from AIDS the year before. Since then, IUDM has raised over $40 million for [[Riley Hospital for Children]] in [[Indianapolis, IN]], including $4,203,326.23 during the 2017 marathon year.

Thirteen-year-old Ryan White contracted AIDS from contaminated blood transfusions he received for hemophilia. When news of the contraction of AIDS became public, his school district in Kokomo, Indiana banned him from attending classes. Ryan then went on to fight in court which led to many headlines across the country and national celebrities like Michael Jackson and Elton John advocated on his behalf. Michael Jackson and Elton John befriended Ryan and helped to spread his story and awareness of AIDS.\n\nAfter arduous court battles, Ryan won the right to return to school; but his battle with the community and AIDS had just begun. The White family dealt with adversity on a daily basis. People were not willing to deal with the concept of AIDS and shunned the Whites. They were victims of fear and anger but had an optimistic outlook that eventually things would return to normal. It was not until a bullet was shot into the White home that the family moved to Cicero, Indiana, where they found peace.\n\nRyan White was one of the biggest advocates of AIDS awareness, appearing at schools and fundraisers across the nation and testified in front of the President's Commission on HIV Epidemic in hopes of changing the public's perception of the disease.\n\nOn April 8, 1990, Ryan White died at the age of 18, right before he was to attend Indiana University.<ref>Johnson, Dirk (April 9, 1990).

Ashley was the Vice President of Communications for IUDM and a member of [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]] sorority. On her way home from an executive meeting, Ashley was struck and killed by a drunk driver outside the sorority house in which she lived, leaving behind a legacy of hope and passion that continues to live within each person involved in the organization.<ref>Stefanski, Matt (October 28, 2012).

Everyone at the marathon gathers to meet and listen to dozens of Riley children tell their stories. Each Riley kid walks down a red carpet, through the crowd, and up onto the stage, as each participant cheers them onward. During theirs presentations, the room falls silent and everyone uses this moment as a reminder of why they are standing.\n\nAs the marathon comes to a conclusion, the presidential address is given and all participants gather to remember those to which they stand for. Finally, the total is raised officially marking the end of the marathon and showing the hard work put in by thousands over the course of the year.\n\nIn 2018, IUDM raised $4,187,051.23.

In 1991, student Jill Stewart started IU Dance Marathon in honor of her friend, Ryan White, who died from AIDS the year before. Since then, IUDM has raised over $36 million for [[Riley Hospital for Children]] in [[Indianapolis, IN]], including $4,203,326.23 during the 2017 marathon year. The 2018 marathon took place November 2nd through November 4th and raised $4,187,051.23.

Thirteen-year-old Ryan White contracted AIDS from contaminated blood transfusions he received for hemophilia. When news of the contraction of AIDS became public, his school district in Kokomo, Indiana banned him from attending classes. Ryan then went on to fight in court which led to many headlines across the country and national celebrities like Michael Jackson and Elton John advocated on his behalf. Michael Jackson and Elton John befriended Ryan and helped to spread his story and awareness of AIDS.\n\nAfter arduous court battles, Ryan won the right to return to school; but his battle with the community and AIDS had just begun. The White family dealt with adversity on a daily basis. People were not willing to deal with the concept of AIDS and shunned the Whites. They were victims of fear and anger but had an optimistic outlook that eventually things would return to normal. It was not until a bullet was shot into the White home that the family moved to Cicero, Indiana, where they found peace.\n\nRyan White was one of the biggest advocates of AIDS awareness, appearing at schools and fundraisers across the nation and testified in front of the President's Commission on HIV Epidemic in hopes of changing the public's perception of the disease.\n\nOn April 8, 1990, Ryan White died at the age of 18, right before he was to attend Indiana University.<ref>Johnson, Dirk (April 9, 1990).

Ryan's life is commemorated by the annual Dance Marathon funds and the Ryan White Infectious Disease Center at Riley Hospital.\n\n===Ashley Louise Crouse===\n\nOn Tuesday, April 12, 2005, the Indiana University campus suffered a loss with the death of one of its students, Ashley Louise Crouse. Ashley was the Vice President of Communications for IUDM and a member of [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]] sorority. On her way home from an executive meeting, Ashley was struck and killed by a drunk driver outside the sorority house in which she lived, leaving behind a legacy of hope and passion that continues to live within each person involved in the organization.<ref>Stefanski, Matt (October 28, 2012).

Those volunteering, or dancing, stand for 12, 24, or 36 hours in honor of those who cannot.\n\nBefore the event, all dancers participate in Color Wars fall semester long competition between 8 color teams that compete during the months leading up to the marathon and throughout the duration of the 36 hour dance marathon event. Dancer organizations are randomly divided into color teams and work together to earn points for their color by participating in weekly competitions, fundraising, 3 large-scale events, marathon stage games, and marathon participation. The winner of color wars for the year is announced at the marathon just before the raising of the total.\n\nCommittee members come together to set up, run the event and inspire others for the duration of the weekend. The marathon starts at 8 PM Friday night with dancers running into the gym to the song, \"[[Eye of the Tiger]].\" The executive council is then introduced and the dancers get to witness the famous IUDM Linedance for the first time. After the opening ceremonies, the teams are split up in a variety of stations around the center, including stations geared toward learning the linedance, hospitality and sports activities.\n\nAt certain times all teams and committee members come together to hear artist and speakers perform, participate in activities on stage and listen to Riley stories. Every year, IUDM has many visitors during the duration of the marathon, including IU alumni, faculty and administration, donors, and most importantly, the Riley families. Everyone at the marathon gathers to meet and listen to dozens of Riley children tell their stories. Each Riley kid walks down a red carpet, through the crowd, and up onto the stage, as each participant cheers them onward. During theirs presentations, the room falls silent and everyone uses this moment as a reminder of why they are standing.\n\nAs the marathon comes to a conclusion, the presidential address is given and all participants gather to remember those to which they stand for. Finally, the total is raised officially marking the end of the marathon and showing the hard work put in by thousands over the course of the year.\n\nIn 2018, IUDM raised $4,187,051.23.
