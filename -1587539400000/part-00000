The regime was led by General [[Ion Antonescu]] in partnership with the [[Iron Guard]], an [[Romanian nationalism|Romanian]] [[ultranationalist]], [[antisemitism|antisemitic]], [[anti-communist]], [[anti-capitalist]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} and pro-[[Eastern Orthodox]] party. Though the Iron Guard had been in the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Government]] since 28 June 1940, on 14 September it achieved dominance, leading to the proclamation of the National Legionary State.\n\nOn 27 September 1940, Romania withdrew from the [[Balkan Pact]]. On 8 October, German troops began crossing into Romania, and soon numbered over 500,000. On 23 November Romania formally joined the [[Axis powers]]. On 27 November, 64 former dignitaries or officials were executed by the Iron Guard in the [[Jilava Massacre]]. The already harsh anti-Semitic legislation was expanded, included the expropriation of Jewish-owned rural property on 4 October, followed by forests on 17 November, and finally by river transport on 4 December.<ref name=Hitchins/>\n\nOn 20 January 1941, the Iron Guard attempted a [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|coup, combined with a pogrom against the Jews]] of Bucharest. Within four days, Antonescu had successfully suppressed the coup, and the Iron Guard was forced out of the government. Sima and many other Legionnaires took refuge in Germany, while others were imprisoned. Antonescu formally abolished the National Legionary State on 14 February 1941.\n\n==Precursors==\n{{See|Kingdom of Romania under Fascism}}\nThe Iron Guard first formed an alliance with the Romanian Government in early 1938, when the then-[[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Octavian Goga]] concluded an agreement with the leader of the Iron Guard, [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]] on 8 February 1938 for limited cooperation. However, this political arrangement displeased the [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]], who dismissed Goga on 11 February and replaced him with Patriarch [[Miron Cristea]].<ref>Dennis Deletant, Springer, 2016, ''British Clandestine Activities in Romania during the Second World War'', p. 33</ref><ref>Hans Rogger, Eugen Weber, University of California Press, 1966, ''The European Right: A Historical Profile'', p. 551</ref><ref>Jean W. Sedlar, BookLocker.com, 2007, ''The Axis Empire in Southeast Europe, 1939-1945'', p. 20</ref>\n\nBetween 28 June and 4 July 1940 [[Horia Sima]], the nominal leader of the Iron Guard after the death of Codreanu, served as Undersecretary of State at the Ministry of Education. The Iron Guard was brought into the [[Ion Gigurtu]]'s [[Gigurtu cabinet|cabinet]], which took power on 4 July 1940, after the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]]. Three Guardists were appointed to the new government: [[Vasile Noveanu]] as Minister of Public Wealth, Sima as Minister of Religion and Arts, and [[Augustin Bideanu]] as Undersecretary of State at the Ministry of Finance. However, Sima resigned on 7 July, because he was denied a purely Guardist cabinet, while his two colleagues retained their posts. An Iron Guard supporter and ideologue, [[Nichifor Crainic]], became Minister of Propaganda.<ref>D.

It had the same territory as modern day Romania, with the exception of [[Northern Transylvania]], which had been ceded to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]] in the aftermath of the [[Second Vienna Award]].<ref>Marina Cattaruzza, Stefan Dyroff, Dieter Langewiesche, Berghahn Books, 2012, ''Territorial Revisionism and the Allies of Germany in the Second World War: Goals, Expectations, Practices'', p. 98</ref> It also possessed several islands in the [[Danube Delta]], as well as [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|Snake Island]] in the [[Black Sea]].

The first act of the new king was to grant General Ion Antonescu unlimited power as ''[[Conduc\u0103tor]]'' (leader) of Romania, relegating himself to a ceremonial role. A decree of 8 September further defined Antonescu's powers.<ref>D. Deletant, Springer, 2006, ''Hitler's Forgotten Ally: Ion Antonescu and his Regime, Romania 1940-1944'', p. 53</ref> To maintain his grip at the helm of the country, while at the same time conceding the leading role to the Iron Guard, Antonescu had King Michael proclaim Romania a National Legionary State on 14 September. The Legionary Movement/Iron Guard became the \"only movement recognized in the new state\", making Romania a totalitarian country.\n\nAntonescu became the legion's honorary leader, with Sima becoming Deputy Prime Minister. Five other Guardists became ministers, among them Prince [[Michel Sturdza|Mihai Sturza]] (Minister of Foreign Affairs) and General [[Constantin Petrovicescu]] (Minister of Interior). Legionary Prefects were appointed in all of the fifty Romanian counties.<ref>D.

In addition, most of the permanent secretaries and directors in the ministries were also Guardists. As the dominant political force, the Guard also controlled the press and propaganda services.<ref>Keith Hitchins, Cambridge University Press, 2014, ''A Concise History of Romania'', p. 204</ref>\n\nOn 6 October 1940, Antonescu attended an Iron Guard rally dressed in Legionary uniform. On 8 October, German troops began crossing into Romania, and soon numbered over 500,000. On 23 November Romania joined the [[Axis powers|Axis]] powers. On 27 November, 64 former dignitaries or officials were executed by the Iron Guard in [[Jilava]] prison while awaiting trial (see ''[[Jilava Massacre]]''). Later that day, historian and former prime minister [[Nicolae Iorga]] and economist [[Virgil Madgearu]], a former government minister, were assassinated. On 1 December, another Iron Guard rally took place at [[Alba Iulia]] to celebrate 22 years since the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania]]. Antonescu again attended, and gave a speech.<ref>Gh. Buzatu, Editura Mica Valahie, ''A History of Romanian Oil Vol II'', pp. 366-367</ref>\n\nAfter the National Legionary State was proclaimed in 14 September, the Legion became the ruling party but had to share executive power with the [[Romanian Army|Army]]. The new Legionary regime had a ritual basis based on the cult of the Guard's dead leader (Codreanu) and other Legionary martyrs. Exhumation, public burial and rehabilitation of Legionary \"martyrs\" was retrospectively regarded by Sima as the most important task justifying the Legion's accession to power. The exhumation of Codreanu's remains and subsequent reburial (21-23 November) reaffirmed Condreanu's charisma as the foundation of Legionary ideology. On the day of Codreanu's reburial, the main Legionary newspaper, ''[[Cuv\u00e2ntul]]'' (''The Word''), wrote: \"It is the day of the Captain's resurrection. He is resurrected, as he promised, according to the Gospel. He is resurrected, rising from the grave to present to us Romania itself, buried by this sinful age.\". A young [[Emil Cioran]] in his twenties strongly endorsed Codreanu's cult: \"With the exception of [[Jesus]], no other dead being has been so present among the living. Has anybody even thought about forgetting him? This dead man spread a perfume of eternity over our human dung and brought back the sky over Romania.\" Soon after Codreanu's reburial, however, the Legion committed the [[Jilava Massacre]], killing over 60 former dignitaries. The Legion thus achieved its goals: the old order collapsed under its blows and all of the Legion's enemies were punished.<ref>John Lampe, Mark Mazower, Central European University Press, 2004, ''Ideologies and National Identities: The Case of Twentieth-Century Southeastern Europe'', p. 40</ref> The reburial of Codreanu's body took place on 30 November, in attendance was Antonescu, Sima, [[Baldur von Schirach|von Schirach]], [[Ernst Wilhelm Bohle|Bohle]] and 100,000 Iron Guardists.<ref name=\"Buzatu, Editura Mica Valahie p. 367\">Gh. Buzatu, Editura Mica Valahie, ''A History of Romanian Oil Vol II'', p. 367</ref>\n\nThe decree which established the National Legionary regime on 14 September placed Antonescu and Sima on an equal footing. On 28 October, Sima accused Antonescu of violating the decree by allowing democratic parties to function. He asserted that such political diversity was contrary to the principles of a totalitarian state. Sima also wanted to apply Nazi principles to Romania's economy in order to bring all of it under centralized control. He addressed a letter to Antonescu in this sense on 16 October, but the latter rejected the idea. Relations between Antonescu and the Guard reached breaking point after the Jilava Massacre. Despite the mounting tension, the two parties achieved a truce for the moment, which allowed a Legionary to keep the post of Bucharest Police Chief but provided for the public condemnation of the Jilava murders.<ref>Keith Hitchins, Clarendon Press, 1994, ''Rumania 1866-1947'', pp. 464-465</ref>\n\nSeveral antisemitic decrees were enacted by the National Legionary State.

This unilateral German action, carried out without consulting [[Benito Mussolini]] ([[Hitler]]'s [[Axis Powers|Axis]] ally and leader of [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]]), prompted the latter to launch an invasion of [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]].

While few Germans from [[Banat]] and [[Transylvania]] were repatriated to the Reich, the number of ethnic Germans from Southern [[Bukovina]] and [[Dobruja]] who were repatriated amounted to 76,500. The German-Romanian convention which sanctioned these repatriations was signed on 22 October 1940. According to the convention, the Romanian state received the real estate previously possessed by the repatriated Germans in exchange for paying compensation to the Reich. The newly-acquired property (lands and houses) would be used by the Romanian state to accommodate ethnic Romanian refugees from [[Bulgaria]], displaced in the aftermath of the [[Treaty of Craiova]].<ref>S.

That same day, a trade agreement was signed with one of the Pact members, [[Turkey]]. On 19 December, another trade agreement was signed between Romania and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], another member of the Balkan Pact.

In the autumn of 1940, the Soviets occupied several Romanian islands in the Danube Delta. Frontier incidents occurred on a daily basis. Soviet troops were concentrated on the Romanian border, Soviet aircraft made incessant incursions in Romania's air space, and - in January 1941 - Soviet vessels attempted to enter Romanian waters by force.<ref>D.

The Guard had been the only radical movement of the Right in Europe to come to power without the assistance of Germany or Italy, and the only one to be toppled during Nazi Germany's domination of continental Europe.\".<ref>Dennis Deletant, \n''Hitler's Forgotten Ally: Ion Antonescu and his Regime, Romania 1940-1944'', Springer, Apr 12, 2006, p. 66</ref>\n\nThe National Legionary State ushered in Romania's Axis membership, first ''de facto'' by welcoming the German Army into the country, and soon afterwards, ''de jure'' through the signing of the Tripartite and Anti-Comintern Pacts. It also did away with most of Romania's traditional political class during the Jilava massacre before being suppressed itself in January 1941, then formally abolished in February.

The regime was led by General [[Ion Antonescu]] in partnership with the [[Iron Guard]], an [[Romanian nationalism|Romanian]] [[ultranationalist]], [[antisemitism|antisemitic]], [[anti-communist]], [[anti-capitalist]] and pro-[[Eastern Orthodox]] party. Though the Iron Guard had been in the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Government]] since 28 June 1940, on 14 September it achieved dominance, leading to the proclamation of the National Legionary State.\n\nOn 27 September 1940, Romania withdrew from the [[Balkan Pact]]. On 8 October, German troops began crossing into Romania, and soon numbered over 500,000. On 23 November Romania formally joined the [[Axis powers]]. On 27 November, 64 former dignitaries or officials were executed by the Iron Guard in the [[Jilava Massacre]]. The already harsh anti-Semitic legislation was expanded, included the expropriation of Jewish-owned rural property on 4 October, followed by forests on 17 November, and finally by river transport on 4 December.<ref name=Hitchins/>\n\nOn 20 January 1941, the Iron Guard attempted a [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|coup, combined with a pogrom against the Jews]] of Bucharest. Within four days, Antonescu had successfully suppressed the coup, and the Iron Guard was forced out of the government. Sima and many other Legionnaires took refuge in Germany, while others were imprisoned. Antonescu formally abolished the National Legionary State on 14 February 1941.\n\n==Precursors==\n{{See|Kingdom of Romania under Fascism}}\nThe Iron Guard first formed an alliance with the Romanian Government in early 1938, when the then-[[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Octavian Goga]] concluded an agreement with the leader of the Iron Guard, [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]] on 8 February 1938 for limited cooperation. However, this political arrangement displeased the [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]], who dismissed Goga on 11 February and replaced him with Patriarch [[Miron Cristea]].<ref>Dennis Deletant, Springer, 2016, ''British Clandestine Activities in Romania during the Second World War'', p. 33</ref><ref>Hans Rogger, Eugen Weber, University of California Press, 1966, ''The European Right: A Historical Profile'', p. 551</ref><ref>Jean W.

The Iron Guard was brought into the [[Ion Gigurtu]]'s [[Gigurtu cabinet|cabinet]], which took power on 4 July 1940, after the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]]. Three Guardists were appointed to the new government: [[Vasile Noveanu]] as Minister of Public Wealth, Sima as Minister of Religion and Arts, and [[Augustin Bideanu]] as Undersecretary of State at the Ministry of Finance. However, Sima resigned on 7 July, because he was denied a purely Guardist cabinet, while his two colleagues retained their posts. An Iron Guard supporter and ideologue, [[Nichifor Crainic]], became Minister of Propaganda.<ref>D.

It had the same territory as modern day Romania, with the exception of [[Northern Transylvania]], which had been ceded to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]] in the aftermath of the [[Second Vienna Award]].<ref>Marina Cattaruzza, Stefan Dyroff, Dieter Langewiesche, Berghahn Books, 2012, ''Territorial Revisionism and the Allies of Germany in the Second World War: Goals, Expectations, Practices'', p. 98</ref> It also possessed several islands in the [[Danube Delta]], as well as [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|Snake Island]] in the [[Black Sea]].

The first act of the new king was to grant General Ion Antonescu unlimited power as ''[[Conduc\u0103tor]]'' (leader) of Romania, relegating himself to a ceremonial role. A decree of 8 September further defined Antonescu's powers.<ref>D. Deletant, Springer, 2006, ''Hitler's Forgotten Ally: Ion Antonescu and his Regime, Romania 1940-1944'', p. 53</ref> To maintain his grip at the helm of the country, while at the same time conceding the leading role to the Iron Guard, Antonescu had King Michael proclaim Romania a National Legionary State on 14 September. The Legionary Movement/Iron Guard became the \"only movement recognized in the new state\", making Romania a totalitarian country.\n\nAntonescu became the legion's honorary leader, with Sima becoming Deputy Prime Minister. Five other Guardists became ministers, among them Prince [[Michel Sturdza|Mihai Sturza]] (Minister of Foreign Affairs) and General [[Constantin Petrovicescu]] (Minister of Interior). Legionary Prefects were appointed in all of the fifty Romanian counties.<ref>D.

In addition, most of the permanent secretaries and directors in the ministries were also Guardists. As the dominant political force, the Guard also controlled the press and propaganda services.<ref>Keith Hitchins, Cambridge University Press, 2014, ''A Concise History of Romania'', p. 204</ref>\n\nOn 6 October 1940, Antonescu attended an Iron Guard rally dressed in Legionary uniform. On 8 October, German troops began crossing into Romania, and soon numbered over 500,000. On 23 November Romania joined the [[Axis powers|Axis]] powers. On 27 November, 64 former dignitaries or officials were executed by the Iron Guard in [[Jilava]] prison while awaiting trial (see ''[[Jilava Massacre]]''). Later that day, historian and former prime minister [[Nicolae Iorga]] and economist [[Virgil Madgearu]], a former government minister, were assassinated. On 1 December, another Iron Guard rally took place at [[Alba Iulia]] to celebrate 22 years since the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania]]. Antonescu again attended, and gave a speech.<ref>Gh. Buzatu, Editura Mica Valahie, ''A History of Romanian Oil Vol II'', pp. 366-367</ref>\n\nAfter the National Legionary State was proclaimed in 14 September, the Legion became the ruling party but had to share executive power with the [[Romanian Army|Army]]. The new Legionary regime had a ritual basis based on the cult of the Guard's dead leader (Codreanu) and other Legionary martyrs. Exhumation, public burial and rehabilitation of Legionary \"martyrs\" was retrospectively regarded by Sima as the most important task justifying the Legion's accession to power. The exhumation of Codreanu's remains and subsequent reburial (21-23 November) reaffirmed Condreanu's charisma as the foundation of Legionary ideology. On the day of Codreanu's reburial, the main Legionary newspaper, ''[[Cuv\u00e2ntul]]'' (''The Word''), wrote: \"It is the day of the Captain's resurrection. He is resurrected, as he promised, according to the Gospel. He is resurrected, rising from the grave to present to us Romania itself, buried by this sinful age.\". A young [[Emil Cioran]] in his twenties strongly endorsed Codreanu's cult: \"With the exception of [[Jesus]], no other dead being has been so present among the living. Has anybody even thought about forgetting him? This dead man spread a perfume of eternity over our human dung and brought back the sky over Romania.\" Soon after Codreanu's reburial, however, the Legion committed the [[Jilava Massacre]], killing over 60 former dignitaries. The Legion thus achieved its goals: the old order collapsed under its blows and all of the Legion's enemies were punished.<ref>John Lampe, Mark Mazower, Central European University Press, 2004, ''Ideologies and National Identities: The Case of Twentieth-Century Southeastern Europe'', p. 40</ref> The reburial of Codreanu's body took place on 30 November, in attendance was Antonescu, Sima, [[Baldur von Schirach|von Schirach]], [[Ernst Wilhelm Bohle|Bohle]] and 100,000 Iron Guardists.<ref name=\"Buzatu, Editura Mica Valahie p. 367\">Gh. Buzatu, Editura Mica Valahie, ''A History of Romanian Oil Vol II'', p. 367</ref>\n\nThe decree which established the National Legionary regime on 14 September placed Antonescu and Sima on an equal footing. On 28 October, Sima accused Antonescu of violating the decree by allowing democratic parties to function. He asserted that such political diversity was contrary to the principles of a totalitarian state. Sima also wanted to apply Nazi principles to Romania's economy in order to bring all of it under centralized control. He addressed a letter to Antonescu in this sense on 16 October, but the latter rejected the idea. Relations between Antonescu and the Guard reached breaking point after the Jilava Massacre. Despite the mounting tension, the two parties achieved a truce for the moment, which allowed a Legionary to keep the post of Bucharest Police Chief but provided for the public condemnation of the Jilava murders.<ref>Keith Hitchins, Clarendon Press, 1994, ''Rumania 1866-1947'', pp. 464-465</ref>\n\nSeveral antisemitic decrees were enacted by the National Legionary State.

This unilateral German action, carried out without consulting [[Benito Mussolini]] ([[Hitler]]'s [[Axis Powers|Axis]] ally and leader of [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]]), prompted the latter to launch an invasion of [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]].

While few Germans from [[Banat]] and [[Transylvania]] were repatriated to the Reich, the number of ethnic Germans from Southern [[Bukovina]] and [[Dobruja]] who were repatriated amounted to 76,500. The German-Romanian convention which sanctioned these repatriations was signed on 22 October 1940. According to the convention, the Romanian state received the real estate previously possessed by the repatriated Germans in exchange for paying compensation to the Reich. The newly-acquired property (lands and houses) would be used by the Romanian state to accommodate ethnic Romanian refugees from [[Bulgaria]], displaced in the aftermath of the [[Treaty of Craiova]].<ref>S.

That same day, a trade agreement was signed with one of the Pact members, [[Turkey]]. On 19 December, another trade agreement was signed between Romania and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], another member of the Balkan Pact.

In the autumn of 1940, the Soviets occupied several Romanian islands in the Danube Delta. Frontier incidents occurred on a daily basis.

The Iron Guard was forced out of the government. Sima and many other legionnaires took refuge in Germany, while others were imprisoned. Antonescu abolished the National Legionary State, in its stead declaring Romania a \"National and Social State.\"\n\nThe suppression of the Rebellion also provided some data on the military equipment used by the Iron Guard, amounting to 5,000 firearms (revolvers, rifles and machine guns) and numerous grenades in Bucharest alone.<ref>Henry Robinson Luce, Time Inc., 1941, ''Time, Volume 37'', p. 29</ref> The Legion also possessed a small armored force of two armored police cars and two [[Renault UE Chenillette|Malaxa]] UE armored tracked carriers.<ref>Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt, H.M.

The Guard had been the only radical movement of the Right in Europe to come to power without the assistance of Germany or Italy, and the only one to be toppled during Nazi Germany's domination of continental Europe.\".<ref>Dennis Deletant, \n''Hitler's Forgotten Ally: Ion Antonescu and his Regime, Romania 1940-1944'', Springer, Apr 12, 2006, p. 66</ref>\n\nThe National Legionary State ushered in Romania's Axis membership, first ''de facto'' by welcoming the German Army into the country, and soon afterwards, ''de jure'' through the signing of the Tripartite and Anti-Comintern Pacts. It also did away with most of Romania's traditional political class during the Jilava massacre before being suppressed itself in January 1941, then formally abolished in February.

The series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] are being held from February to August 2020. This nominating process is an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]], who then in turn elect their party's nominees for president and vice president.\n\n[[Donald Trump]], the 45th and incumbent president, has launched a reelection campaign for the Republican primaries; several state Republican Party organizations have cancelled their primaries in a show of support for his candidacy.<ref name=\"6KjVJ\" /> Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee on March 17, 2020 after securing a majority of pledged delegates.<ref name=\"EHTx4\" /> 29 major candidates launched [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|campaigns for the Democratic nomination]], which became the largest field of candidates for any political party in the post-[[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission|reform]] period of American politics.

W. Bush]] was an incumbent vice president at the time of the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] and [[Al Gore]] was an incumbent vice president at the time of the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] elections).\n\n==Background==\n===Procedure===\n{{further|United States presidential election#Procedure}}\n\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] of the [[United States Constitution]] states that for a person to serve as president the individual must be a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizen of the United States]], at least 35 years old and a United States resident for at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question.

[[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing, with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s), and often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] which also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name=\"9qYs9\" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in the drawing of new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name=\"X02Fz\" />\n\n===Impeachment===\nThe House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|voted to impeach President Trump]] on two counts on December 18, 2019.<ref name=\"OB3KB\" /> The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,<ref name=\"IIWDj\" /> and ended on February 5, resulting in [[Acquittal#United States|acquittal]] by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=\"yUc9u\" />\n\nThis is the first time a president has been impeached during his first term and while running for a second term.<ref name=\"J17gD\" /> Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.<ref name=\"FVJtv\" /><ref name=\"GGhFA\" /> This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.<ref name=\"Politiconov1\" /> The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.<ref name=\"2cIKK\" /><ref name=\"JDGyw\" />\n\n===Effects of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic===\n[[File:Electionsaltered.svg|thumb|right|States with at least one local, state, or federal primary election date or method of voting altered as of March 29, 2020. \n{{legend|#eeff00|Municipal election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#0cff00|State level primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#1500ff|State level and municipal primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#b200ff|Federal level primary or election date altered |border=0}}]]\n{{see|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{see|Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on politics}}\n\nSeveral events related to the 2020 presidential election have been altered or postponed due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]].

Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing, with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s), and often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] which also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name=\"9qYs9\" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in the drawing of new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name=\"X02Fz\" />\n\n===Impeachment===\nThe House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|voted to impeach President Trump]] on two counts on December 18, 2019.<ref name=\"OB3KB\" /> The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,<ref name=\"IIWDj\" /> and ended on February 5, resulting in [[Acquittal#United States|acquittal]] by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=\"yUc9u\" />\n\nThis is the first time a president has been impeached during his first term and while running for a second term.<ref name=\"J17gD\" /> Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.<ref name=\"FVJtv\" /><ref name=\"GGhFA\" /> This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.<ref name=\"Politiconov1\" /> The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.<ref name=\"2cIKK\" /><ref name=\"JDGyw\" />\n\n===Effects of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic===\n[[File:Electionsaltered.svg|thumb|right|States with at least one local, state, or federal primary election date or method of voting altered as of March 29, 2020. \n{{legend|#eeff00|Municipal election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#0cff00|State level primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#1500ff|State level and municipal primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#b200ff|Federal level primary or election date altered |border=0}}]]\n{{see|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{see|Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on politics}}\n\nSeveral events related to the 2020 presidential election have been altered or postponed due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]].

The opening kilometers raced through Richmond's historic Northside neighborhoods leading into downtown. The course continued east of Richmond down rural Route 5, which parallels the 50-mile Virginia Capital Trail. The first few kilometers were scenic, flat, open roads that eventually narrowed and went through Richmond National Battlefield Park, a historic Civil War site. The race re-entered the city through Shockoe Bottom, eventually making a hard right turn on Governor Street to ascend {{convert|300|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}. At the top, the teams had to take a sharp left turn onto the false-flat finishing straight, {{convert|680|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} to the finish.<ref>http://richmond2015.com/about/courses/team-time-trial/</ref>\n\n==Qualification==\n{{main|2015 UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Qualification}}\nIt was an obligation for all [[List of 2015 UCI ProTeams and riders|2015 UCI ProTeams]] to participate.

The village was returned to German hands in 1963.]]\nAt the end of [[World War II]], plans were made in the [[Netherlands]] to '''annex German territory''' as compensation for the damages caused by the war. In October 1945, the Dutch state asked [[Germany]] for 25 billion [[guilder]]s in [[War reparations|reparations]]. In February 1945 it had already been established at the [[Yalta Conference]] that reparations would not be given in monetary form. The plan which was worked out in most detail was the one made by {{ill|Frits Bakker Schut|nl}}, and hence became known as the '''Bakker-Schut Plan'''.\n\nIn its most ambitious form, this plan included the cities of [[Cologne]], [[Aachen]], [[M\u00fcnster]] and [[Osnabr\u00fcck]], and would have enlarged the country's European area by 30 to 50 percent. The local population had to be either deported, or, when still speaking the original [[Low German]] dialects, [[Batavianization|Dutchified]]. The plan was largely dropped after U.S. dismissal of it. Eventually, an area of a total size of {{cvt|69|km2}} was allocated to the Netherlands. Almost all of this was returned to [[West Germany]] in 1963 after Germany paid the Netherlands 280 million [[Deutschmark|German marks]].\n\nMany Germans living in the Netherlands were declared \"enemy subjects\" after World War II ended and put into an internment camp in an operation called [[Operation Black Tulip|Black Tulip]]. A total of 3,691 Germans were ultimately deported.\n\n==Liberation==\nIn the first year following the liberation of the Netherlands in May 1945, dozens of pamphlets and brochures were published that propagated annexation of territory of the former [[German Reich]], preferably without the accompanying German population. Several highly placed persons, including then [[Foreign Minister]] [[Eelco van Kleffens|Eelco Nicolaas van Kleffens]], put forth their own ideas regarding annexation in these publications. Opinions varied widely as to how much territory should be annexed. Some people only wanted a few border corrections, others drew the new border past [[Hamburg]].\n\nThe proponents of annexation joined in several local committees. On 19 June 1945, the [[The Hague|Hague]] committee to examine the question of Dutch territorial expansion was founded. During a meeting of this committee on 12 July 1945, it was decided to split the committee in the ''Study Group Territorial Expansion'' (Studiegroep Gebiedsuitbreiding), chaired by Ph.J. Idenburg, and the ''Action Committee'' (Comit\u00e9 van Actie), which had as its primary function the education of the Dutch population about the expansion plans. \n\nSix days later, the latter committee was renamed the ''Dutch Committee for Territorial Expansion''. It was chaired by former [[Finance minister]] [[Johannes van den Broek]]. On 25 August 1945, Minister Van Kleffens founded the ''State Commission for the Study of the Annexation Question'', which was charged with writing a final report regarding the annexation question by May 1946.\n\nThe Study Group Territorial Expansion set up many groups that reported about their findings. The final judgment of the State Commission would be largely based on the results of this study group. The Dutch Committee for Territorial Expansion published on the progress of the study group by giving out brochures and giving lectures. The annexation question however led to intense discussions, which lead certain groups to go their own way and among other things found the Annexation Committee of the Foundation for Agriculture.\n\n==Bakker Schut Plan==\nBakker Schut was the president of the National service for the National Plan, secretary of the Dutch Committee for Territorial Expansion, and a member of the State Commission for the Study of the Annexation Question and of the Study Group Territorial Expansion. In his expansion plan, he suggested to annex a large part of northwestern Germany. All the land west of the line [[Wilhelmshaven]]-[[Osnabr\u00fcck]]-[[Hamm]]-[[Wesel]] would be added to the Netherlands, as well as the land east of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], where the border followed the [[Rhine]] until close to [[Cologne]], then diverging towards [[Aachen]] in the west. \n\nIn the A Variation of the plan, among others the large cities of Aachen, Cologne, [[M\u00fcnster]], [[Oldenburg]] and Osnabr\u00fcck were annexed. Bakker Schut called this the [[Weser River|Weser border]] and ended his writings with the slogan ''Nederland's grens kome aan de Wezer'' (The border of the Netherlands be at the Weser). In a smaller plan B, the west-[[Rhineland]] cities Cologne, [[M\u00f6nchengladbach]] and [[Neuss]] were not annexed. In a third option, plan C, the proposed annexation was much smaller. It included an area west of [[Varel]], the entire [[Emsland]], and the area around [[Wesel]] until near the [[Duchy of Cleves]].\n\n===Areas to be annexed===\n[[Image:Bakker Schut-plan.PNG|right|thumb|500px|The '''Bakker-Schut Plan'''.

Hence, he justified the annexation using arguments like increased power and greater security for the Dutch state. He furthermore considered the annexation as compensation for war damages and as a part of the population policy to be followed. Contrary to what might be expected, after an inventory he considered the natural resources of the territory to be annexed as insufficiently important to motivate annexation. In his view, even a transfer of the entire [[Ruhr Area]] would not be sufficient to pay for the damages.\n\n===Forced migration===\nA big point of discussion in Bakker Schut's expansion plan was the proposed forced migration of the original German population. Millions of Germans would have to be expelled to the remaining German territories, ostensibly because it was feared that increasing the Dutch population from 9 to 11 million people could cause trouble in providing everybody with food. \n\nA pamphlet titled ''Oostland - Ons Land'' (East land - Our land) contained a complete schedule for the expulsion of the population, starting with all inhabitants of municipalities with a population of at least 2,500, all former members of the [[NSDAP]] and related organizations, and all inhabitants who had settled in the area after 1933. In special cases, the inhabitants could request to be [[naturalization|naturalized]], for instance if they had made efforts for the Dutch state during the war, if they usually spoke [[Low Saxon languages|Low Saxon]] instead of [[High German]], if they had no family members up to the second degree that lived in Germany, or if they wished to become Dutch.\n\n<!-- Almost all these names are and were existing Low German and/or Dutch place names (Monniken-Glaabbeek may be an exception); they were not invented for the annexation plan as suggested by including it here in this article\n===Dutch names===\nIt was also already determined which Dutch names the cities and areas in the territory to be annexed would get. The table below gives a small sample of the suggested name changes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n!'''Suggested names'''\n!'''Original German names'''\n |-\n |Aken\n |[[Aachen]]\n |-\n |Emmelkamp\n |[[Emlichheim]]\n |-\n |Emmerik\n |[[Emmerich am Rhein|Emmerich]]\n |-\n |Geelkerken\n |[[Geilenkirchen]]\n |-\n |Gelderen\n |[[Geldern]]\n |-\n |Gogh\n |[[Goch]]\n |-\n |Gulik\n |[[J\u00fclich]]\n |-\n |Hoog Elten\n |[[Elten|Hoch-Elten]]\n |-\n |Jemmingen\n |[[Jemgum]]\n |-\n |Kleef\n |[[Kleve]]\n |-\n |Keulen\n |[[Keulen|K\u00f6ln]]\n |-\n |Meurs\n |[[Moers]]\n |-\n |Monniken-Glaabbeek\n |[[M\u00f6nchengladbach]]\n |-\n |Munster\n |[[M\u00fcnster]]\n |-\n |Neder-Benthem\n |[[Bad Bentheim]]\n |-\n |Nieuwenhuis\n |[[Neuenhaus]]\n |-\n |Noordhoorn\n |[[Nordhorn]]\n |-\n |Osnabrugge\n |[[Osnabr\u00fcck]]\n |-\n |Veldhuizen\n |[[Veldhausen]]\n |-\n |Wezel\n |[[Wesel]]\n |-\n |Zelfkant\n |[[Selfkant]]\n |-\n |Zwilbroek\n |[[Zwillbrock]]\n|\n-->\n==Dispute==\nIn the Dutch cabinet, a dispute about the annexation question arose. Van Kleffens promoted territorial expansion, while Minister of Social Affairs [[Willem Drees]] (later [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]]) was dead set against it. Generally, [[socialists]] were against annexation and [[Protestants]] and [[Liberalism|liberals]] were reluctant. The [[Catholics]] saw advantages in the territorial expansion, mainly as a method to give the farmers near the border more room, and because the German territories to be annexed were predominantly Catholic, so that remaining inhabitants would have increased the percentage of Catholics in the Netherlands. \n\nDutch churches objected to the proposed mass expulsion, because in their eyes the German population could not be found guilty of the crimes of the [[Nazis]] during World War II. Prime Minister [[Wim Schermerhorn]] was also not in favor of annexing German territory, but [[Queen regnant|Queen]] [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Wilhelmina]], an energetic supporter of the annexation plan, strongly urged him to start negotiating on this with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. In 1946, in the name of the Dutch government, he officially claimed {{cvt|4,980|km2}} of German territory, which was not even half of the area envisioned by Van Kleffens. The Dutch-German border would be drawn from [[Vaals]] via [[Winterswijk]] to the [[Ems River]], so that 550,000 Germans would live inside the Dutch national borders.\n\n==Implementation==\nIn 1947, the planned large-scale annexation was rejected by the [[Allied High Commission]], on the grounds that Germany already contained [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)|14,000,000 refugees from the annexations in the east]] and that the remaining territory could not handle more refugees. Furthermore, the allies (in particular the Americans) considered it vital to have a stable West Germany in view of the coming [[Cold War]].\n\nAt a conference of foreign ministers of the western allied occupation forces in London (14 January until 25 February 1947), the Dutch government (Cabinet Beel I) claimed an area of {{Convert|1,840|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. This claim included, apart from the island of [[Borkum]], large parts of the Emsland, Bentheim, the cities of [[Ahaus]], [[Rees, Germany|Rees]], [[Kleve]], [[Erkelenz]], [[Geilenkirchen]], and [[Heinsberg]]; and the areas around these cities.\n\nIn 1946, about 160,000 people lived in this area, of whom more than 90% spoke German. This plan was a very simplified version of the C-variation of the Bakker-Schut Plan. The [[Catholic People's Party|KVP]] considered this proposal much too small, while the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands|CPN]] rejected any kind of reparations in the form of territorial expansion.\n\nThe London conference of 23 April 1949 only permitted some less far-reaching border modifications. At 12 noon that day, Dutch troops moved to occupy an area of {{Convert|69|km2|acre|abbr=on}}, the largest parts of which were [[Elten]] (near [[Emmerich am Rhein]]) and [[Selfkant]]. Many other small border corrections were executed, mostly in the vicinity of [[Arnhem]] and [[Dinxperlo]]. At that time, these areas were inhabited by a total of almost 10,000 people.\n\n===Overview of areas annexed in 1949 (from north to south)===\n*Uninhabited areas ({{cvt|0.3|km2}}) between [[Nieuweschans]] and [[Ter Apel]]\n*Uninhabited areas on both sides of the [[Channel Almelo-Nordhorn]] ({{cvt|0.3|km2}})\n*Area near [[Losser]], 18 inhabitants ({{cvt|1|km2}})\n*Small border road near [[Rekken]] south of [[Haaksbergen]]\n*Uninhabited area near Kotten ({{cvt|0.09|km2}})\n*[[Suderwick]], small village bordering on [[Dinxperlo]], 342 inhabitants ({{cvt|0.64|km2}})\n*[[Elten]], small town on the Rhine, 3,235 inhabitants ({{cvt|19.54|km2}})\n*Small border road near [[Millingen aan de Rijn]]\n*[[Duivelsberg/Wylerberg]] between [[Beek, Ubbergen|Beek]] and [[Wijlerberg]]\n* [[Neutraleweg|Border road]] near [[Mook en Middelaar|Mook]];\n* Uninhabited area near [[Ottersum]] ({{cvt|0.05|km2}});\n* Border road near [[Siebengewald]], four inhabitants;\n* Two areas north and south of [[Arcen]], sixty inhabitants ({{cvt|0.4|and|0.41|km2}})\n* Area near [[Sittard]] of {{cvt|41.34|km2}} inhabited by 5,665 people ([[Selfkant]], governed under the name of its main village Tudderen);\n* Border road near [[Ubach over Worms]];\n* Area near [[Rimburg]] and [[Kerkrade]], 130 inhabitants ({{cvt|0.88|km2}});\n* Fixed some border-technical mistakes in Kerkrade\n* Area near [[Eijgelshoven]], 110 inhabitants ({{cvt|0.11|km2}})\n\n==Return==\nStarting in March 1957, West Germany negotiated the return of these areas with the Netherlands. These negotiations led to an agreement ({{lang-de|Vertrag vom 8.

The village was returned to German hands in 1963.]]\nAt the end of [[World War II]], plans were made in the [[Netherlands]] to '''annex German territory''' as compensation for the damages caused by the war. In October 1945, the Dutch state asked [[Germany]] for 25 billion [[guilder]]s in [[War reparations|reparations]]. In February 1945 it had already been established at the [[Yalta Conference]] that reparations would not be given in monetary form. The plan which was worked out in most detail was the one made by {{ill|Frits Bakker Schut|nl}}, and hence became known as the '''Bakker-Schut Plan'''.\n\nIn its most ambitious form, this plan included the cities of [[Cologne]], [[Aachen]], [[M\u00fcnster]] and [[Osnabr\u00fcck]], and would have enlarged the country's European area by 30 to 50 percent. The local population had to be either deported, or, when still speaking the original [[Low German]] dialects, [[Batavianization|Dutchified]]. The plan was largely dropped after U.S. dismissal of it. Eventually, an area of a total size of {{cvt|69|km2}} was allocated to the Netherlands. Almost all of this was returned to [[West Germany]] in 1963 after Germany paid the Netherlands 280 million [[Deutschmark|German marks]].\n\nMany Germans living in the Netherlands were declared \"enemy subjects\" after World War II ended and put into an internment camp in an operation called [[Operation Black Tulip|Black Tulip]]. A total of 3,691 Germans were ultimately deported.\n\n==Liberation==\nIn the first year following the liberation of the Netherlands in May 1945, dozens of pamphlets and brochures were published that propagated annexation of territory of the former [[German Reich]], preferably without the accompanying German population. Several highly placed persons, including then [[Foreign Minister]] [[Eelco van Kleffens|Eelco Nicolaas van Kleffens]], put forth their own ideas regarding annexation in these publications. Opinions varied widely as to how much territory should be annexed. Some people only wanted a few border corrections, others drew the new border past [[Hamburg]].\n\nThe proponents of annexation joined in several local committees. On 19 June 1945, the [[The Hague|Hague]] committee to examine the question of Dutch territorial expansion was founded. During a meeting of this committee on 12 July 1945, it was decided to split the committee in the ''Study Group Territorial Expansion'' (Studiegroep Gebiedsuitbreiding), chaired by Ph.J. Idenburg, and the ''Action Committee'' (Comit\u00e9 van Actie), which had as its primary function the education of the Dutch population about the expansion plans. \n\nSix days later, the latter committee was renamed the ''Dutch Committee for Territorial Expansion''. It was chaired by former [[Finance minister]] [[Johannes van den Broek]]. On 25 August 1945, Minister Van Kleffens founded the ''State Commission for the Study of the Annexation Question'', which was charged with writing a final report regarding the annexation question by May 1946.\n\nThe Study Group Territorial Expansion set up many groups that reported about their findings. The final judgment of the State Commission would be largely based on the results of this study group. The Dutch Committee for Territorial Expansion published on the progress of the study group by giving out brochures and giving lectures. The annexation question however led to intense discussions, which lead certain groups to go their own way and among other things found the Annexation Committee of the Foundation for Agriculture.\n\n==Bakker Schut Plan==\nBakker Schut was the president of the National service for the National Plan, secretary of the Dutch Committee for Territorial Expansion, and a member of the State Commission for the Study of the Annexation Question and of the Study Group Territorial Expansion. In his expansion plan, he suggested to annex a large part of northwestern Germany. All the land west of the line [[Wilhelmshaven]]-[[Osnabr\u00fcck]]-[[Hamm]]-[[Wesel]] would be added to the Netherlands, as well as the land east of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], where the border followed the [[Rhine]] until close to [[Cologne]], then diverging towards [[Aachen]] in the west. \n\nIn the A Variation of the plan, among others the large cities of Aachen, Cologne, [[M\u00fcnster]], [[Oldenburg]] and Osnabr\u00fcck were annexed. Bakker Schut called this the [[Weser River|Weser border]] and ended his writings with the slogan ''Nederland's grens kome aan de Wezer'' (The border of the Netherlands be at the Weser). In a smaller plan B, the west-[[Rhineland]] cities Cologne, [[M\u00f6nchengladbach]] and [[Neuss]] were not annexed. In a third option, plan C, the proposed annexation was much smaller.

Hence, he justified the annexation using arguments like increased power and greater security for the Dutch state. He furthermore considered the annexation as compensation for war damages and as a part of the population policy to be followed. Contrary to what might be expected, after an inventory he considered the natural resources of the territory to be annexed as insufficiently important to motivate annexation. In his view, even a transfer of the entire [[Ruhr Area]] would not be sufficient to pay for the damages.\n\n===Forced migration===\nA big point of discussion in Bakker Schut's expansion plan was the proposed forced migration of the original German population. Millions of Germans would have to be expelled to the remaining German territories, ostensibly because it was feared that increasing the Dutch population from 9 to 11 million people could cause trouble in providing everybody with food. \n\nA pamphlet titled ''Oostland - Ons Land'' (East land - Our land) contained a complete schedule for the expulsion of the population, starting with all inhabitants of municipalities with a population of at least 2,500, all former members of the [[NSDAP]] and related organizations, and all inhabitants who had settled in the area after 1933. In special cases, the inhabitants could request to be [[naturalization|naturalized]], for instance if they had made efforts for the Dutch state during the war, if they usually spoke [[Low Saxon languages|Low Saxon]] instead of [[High German]], if they had no family members up to the second degree that lived in Germany, or if they wished to become Dutch.\n\n<!-- Almost all these names are and were existing Low German and/or Dutch place names (Monniken-Glaabbeek may be an exception); they were not invented for the annexation plan as suggested by including it here in this article\n===Dutch names===\nIt was also already determined which Dutch names the cities and areas in the territory to be annexed would get. The table below gives a small sample of the suggested name changes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n!'''Suggested names'''\n!'''Original German names'''\n |-\n |Aken\n |[[Aachen]]\n |-\n |Emmelkamp\n |[[Emlichheim]]\n |-\n |Emmerik\n |[[Emmerich am Rhein|Emmerich]]\n |-\n |Geelkerken\n |[[Geilenkirchen]]\n |-\n |Gelderen\n |[[Geldern]]\n |-\n |Gogh\n |[[Goch]]\n |-\n |Gulik\n |[[J\u00fclich]]\n |-\n |Hoog Elten\n |[[Elten|Hoch-Elten]]\n |-\n |Jemmingen\n |[[Jemgum]]\n |-\n |Kleef\n |[[Kleve]]\n |-\n |Keulen\n |[[Keulen|K\u00f6ln]]\n |-\n |Meurs\n |[[Moers]]\n |-\n |Monniken-Glaabbeek\n |[[M\u00f6nchengladbach]]\n |-\n |Munster\n |[[M\u00fcnster]]\n |-\n |Neder-Benthem\n |[[Bad Bentheim]]\n |-\n |Nieuwenhuis\n |[[Neuenhaus]]\n |-\n |Noordhoorn\n |[[Nordhorn]]\n |-\n |Osnabrugge\n |[[Osnabr\u00fcck]]\n |-\n |Veldhuizen\n |[[Veldhausen]]\n |-\n |Wezel\n |[[Wesel]]\n |-\n |Zelfkant\n |[[Selfkant]]\n |-\n |Zwilbroek\n |[[Zwillbrock]]\n|\n-->\n==Dispute==\nIn the Dutch cabinet, a dispute about the annexation question arose. Van Kleffens promoted territorial expansion, while Minister of Social Affairs [[Willem Drees]] (later [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]]) was dead set against it. Generally, [[socialists]] were against annexation and [[Protestants]] and [[Liberalism|liberals]] were reluctant. The [[Catholics]] saw advantages in the territorial expansion, mainly as a method to give the farmers near the border more room, and because the German territories to be annexed were predominantly Catholic, so that remaining inhabitants would have increased the percentage of Catholics in the Netherlands. \n\nDutch churches objected to the proposed mass expulsion, because in their eyes the German population could not be found guilty of the crimes of the [[Nazis]] during World War II. Prime Minister [[Wim Schermerhorn]] was also not in favor of annexing German territory, but [[Queen regnant|Queen]] [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Wilhelmina]], an energetic supporter of the annexation plan, strongly urged him to start negotiating on this with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. In 1946, in the name of the Dutch government, he officially claimed {{cvt|4,980|km2}} of German territory, which was not even half of the area envisioned by Van Kleffens. The Dutch-German border would be drawn from [[Vaals]] via [[Winterswijk]] to the [[Ems River]], so that 550,000 Germans would live inside the Dutch national borders.\n\n==Implementation==\nIn 1947, the planned large-scale annexation was rejected by the [[Allied High Commission]], on the grounds that Germany already contained [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)|14,000,000 refugees from the annexations in the east]] and that the remaining territory could not handle more refugees. Furthermore, the allies (in particular the Americans) considered it vital to have a stable West Germany in view of the coming [[Cold War]].\n\nAt a conference of foreign ministers of the western allied occupation forces in London (14 January until 25 February 1947), the Dutch government (Cabinet Beel I) claimed an area of {{Convert|1,840|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. This claim included, apart from the island of [[Borkum]], large parts of the Emsland, Bentheim, the cities of [[Ahaus]], [[Rees, Germany|Rees]], [[Kleve]], [[Erkelenz]], [[Geilenkirchen]], and [[Heinsberg]]; and the areas around these cities.\n\nIn 1946, about 160,000 people lived in this area, of whom more than 90% spoke German. This plan was a very simplified version of the C-variation of the Bakker-Schut Plan. The [[Catholic People's Party|KVP]] considered this proposal much too small, while the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands|CPN]] rejected any kind of reparations in the form of territorial expansion.\n\nThe London conference of 23 April 1949 only permitted some less far-reaching border modifications. At 12 noon that day, Dutch troops moved to occupy an area of {{Convert|69|km2|acre|abbr=on}}, the largest parts of which were [[Elten]] (near [[Emmerich am Rhein]]) and [[Selfkant]]. Many other small border corrections were executed, mostly in the vicinity of [[Arnhem]] and [[Dinxperlo]]. At that time, these areas were inhabited by a total of almost 10,000 people.\n\n===Overview of areas annexed in 1949 (from north to south)===\n*Uninhabited areas ({{cvt|0.3|km2}}) between [[Nieuweschans]] and [[Ter Apel]]\n*Uninhabited areas on both sides of the [[Channel Almelo-Nordhorn]] ({{cvt|0.3|km2}})\n*Area near [[Losser]], 18 inhabitants ({{cvt|1|km2}})\n*Small border road near [[Rekken]] south of [[Haaksbergen]]\n*Uninhabited area near Kotten ({{cvt|0.09|km2}})\n*[[Suderwick]], small village bordering on [[Dinxperlo]], 342 inhabitants ({{cvt|0.64|km2}})\n*[[Elten]], small town on the Rhine, 3,235 inhabitants ({{cvt|19.54|km2}})\n*Small border road near [[Millingen aan de Rijn]]\n*[[Duivelsberg/Wylerberg]] between [[Beek, Ubbergen|Beek]] and [[Wijlerberg]]\n* [[Neutraleweg|Border road]] near [[Mook en Middelaar|Mook]];\n* Uninhabited area near [[Ottersum]] ({{cvt|0.05|km2}});\n* Border road near [[Siebengewald]], four inhabitants;\n* Two areas north and south of [[Arcen]], sixty inhabitants ({{cvt|0.4|and|0.41|km2}})\n* Area near [[Sittard]] of {{cvt|41.34|km2}} inhabited by 5,665 people ([[Selfkant]], governed under the name of its main village Tudderen);\n* Border road near [[Ubach over Worms]];\n* Area near [[Rimburg]] and [[Kerkrade]], 130 inhabitants ({{cvt|0.88|km2}});\n* Fixed some border-technical mistakes in Kerkrade\n* Area near [[Eijgelshoven]], 110 inhabitants ({{cvt|0.11|km2}})\n\n==Return==\nStarting in March 1957, West Germany negotiated the return of these areas with the Netherlands. These negotiations led to an agreement ({{lang-de|Vertrag vom 8.

As the appendix becomes more swollen and inflamed, it begins to irritate the adjoining abdominal wall. This leads to the localization of the pain to [[Right lower quadrant (abdomen)|the right lower quadrant]]. This classic migration of pain may not be seen in children under three years. This pain can be elicited through signs and can be severe. Symptoms include localized findings in the right [[iliac fossa]]. The abdominal wall becomes very sensitive to gentle pressure ([[palpation]]). There is severe pain in the sudden release of deep tension in the lower abdomen ([[rebound tenderness]]). If the appendix is retrocecal (localized behind the [[cecum]]), even deep pressure in the right lower quadrant may fail to elicit tenderness (silent appendix). This is because the [[cecum]], distended with gas, protects the inflamed appendix from pressure.\nSimilarly, if the appendix lies entirely within the pelvis, there is typically a complete absence of abdominal rigidity. In such cases, a digital [[rectal examination]] elicits tenderness in the rectovesical pouch. Coughing causes point tenderness in this area ([[McBurney's point]]), historically called [[Dunphy sign|Dunphy's sign]].\n\n==Causes==\nAcute appendicitis seems to be the result of a primary obstruction of the appendix.<ref name=Wang1937>{{Cite journal|vauthors=[[Owen Harding Wangensteen|Wangensteen OH]], Bowers WF |title=Significance of the obstructive factor in the genesis of acute appendicitis |journal=Archives of Surgery |volume=34 |issue= 3|pages=496\u2013526 |year=1937|doi=10.1001/archsurg.1937.01190090121006}}</ref><ref name=Piep1982/> Once this obstruction occurs, the appendix becomes filled with [[mucus]] and swells. This continued production of mucus leads to increased pressures within the lumen and the walls of the appendix. The increased pressure results in [[thrombosis]] and [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]] of the small vessels, and stasis of [[Lymphatic system|lymphatic flow]]. At this point, spontaneous recovery rarely occurs. As the occlusion of blood vessels progresses, the appendix becomes [[Ischemia|ischemic]] and then [[Necrosis|necrotic]]. As [[bacteria]] begin to leak out through the dying walls, [[pus]] forms within and around the appendix (suppuration). The end result is appendiceal rupture (a 'burst appendix') causing [[peritonitis]], which may lead to [[sepsis]] and eventually [[death]]. These events are responsible for the slowly evolving abdominal pain and other commonly associated symptoms.<ref name=Schw2010/>\n\nThe causative agents include [[bezoar]]s, foreign bodies, [[physical trauma|trauma]], [[Intestinal parasite|intestinal worms]], [[Lymphadenopathy|lymphadenitis]] and, most commonly, calcified fecal deposits that are known as [[appendicolith]]s or [[fecalith]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | last1= Hollerman |first1=J. |last2=Bernstein |first2=MA |last3=Kottamasu |first3=SR |last4=Sirr |first4=SA | year = 1988 | title = Acute recurrent appendicitis with appendicolith | journal =The American Journal of Emergency Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = 6| pages = 614\u2013617 | doi=10.1016/0735-6757(88)90105-2}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> The occurrence of [[Fecaloma|obstructing fecalith]]s has attracted attention since their presence in people with appendicitis is higher in developed than in developing countries.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones BA, Demetriades D, Segal I, Burkitt DP | title = The prevalence of appendiceal fecaliths in patients with and without appendicitis.

Some of these conditions include [[inflammation]] of [[lymph nodes]] near the appendix or pain originating from other pelvic organs such as the ovaries or Fallopian tubes.

Once the incision opens the abdomen cavity, and the appendix is identified, the [[surgeon]] removes the infected tissue and cuts the appendix from the surrounding tissue. After careful and close inspection of the infected area, and ensuring there are no signs that surrounding tissues are damaged or infected.  In case of complicated appendicitis managed by an emergency open appendectomy, abdominal drainage (a temporary tube from the abdomen to the outside to avoid abscess formation) may be inserted, but this may increase the hospital stay.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li Z, Zhao L, Cheng Y, Cheng N, Deng Y | title = Abdominal drainage to prevent intra-peritoneal abscess after open appendectomy for complicated appendicitis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = CD010168 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29741752 | pmc = 6494575 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010168.pub3 }}</ref> The surgeon will start closing the incision.

The laparoscope is connected to a monitor outside the person's body, and it is designed to help the surgeon to inspect the infected area in the abdomen. The other two incisions are made for the specific removal of the appendix by using [[surgical instrument]]s. Laparoscopic surgery requires [[general anesthesia]], and it can last up to two hours. Laparoscopic appendectomy has several advantages over open appendectomy, including a shorter post-operative recovery, less post-operative pain, and lower superficial surgical site infection rate.

An [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous drip]] is used to hydrate the person who will be having surgery. [[Antibiotic]]s given intravenously such as [[cefuroxime]] and [[metronidazole]] may be administered early to help kill bacteria and thus reduce the spread of infection in the abdomen and postoperative complications in the abdomen or wound. Equivocal cases may become more difficult to assess with antibiotic treatment and benefit from serial examinations. If the stomach is empty (no food in the past six hours), general anaesthesia is usually used. Otherwise, [[spinal anaesthesia]] may be used.\n\nOnce the decision to perform an [[appendectomy]] has been made, the preparation procedure takes approximately one to two hours. Meanwhile, the surgeon will explain the surgery procedure and will present the risks that must be considered when performing an appendectomy. (With all surgeries there are risks that must be evaluated before performing the procedures.) The risks are different depending on the state of the appendix. If the appendix has not ruptured, the complication rate is only about 3% but if the appendix has ruptured, the complication rate rises to almost 59%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/A-Ce/Appendectomy.html |title=Appendicitis |work=Encyclopedia of Surgery |access-date=2010-02-01 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209031325/http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/A-Ce/Appendectomy.html |archive-date=2010-02-09 }}</ref> The most usual complications that can occur are pneumonia, [[hernia]] of the incision, [[thrombophlebitis]], bleeding and [[adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]].

Abdomen hair is usually removed to avoid complications that may appear regarding the incision.\n\nIn most cases, patients going in for surgery experience nausea and vomiting that require medication before surgery. Antibiotics, along with pain medication, may be administrated before appendectomies.\n\n====After surgery====\n[[File:Stitches post appendicitis surgery.jpg|thumb|The [[surgical suture|stitches]] the day after having the appendix removed by laparoscopic surgery]]\nHospital lengths of stay typically range from a few hours to a few days but can be a few weeks if complications occur. The recovery process may vary depending on the severity of the condition: if the appendix had ruptured or not before surgery. Appendix surgery recovery is generally a lot faster if the appendix did not rupture.<ref>[http://appendixsurgery.net Appendicitis surgery, removal and recovery] Retrieved on 2010-02-01  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111221304/http://appendixsurgery.net/ |date=January 11, 2010 }}</ref> It is important that people undergoing surgery respect their doctor's advice and limit their physical activity so the [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] can heal faster. Recovery after an appendectomy may not require diet changes or a lifestyle change.\n\nThe length of hospital stays for appendicitis varies on the severity of the condition. A study from the United States found that in 2010, the average appendicitis hospital stay was 1.8 days. For stays where the person's appendix had ruptured, the average length of stay was 5.2 days.<ref name=Barrett2013/>\n\nAfter surgery, the patient will be transferred to a [[postanesthesia care unit]], so his or her vital signs can be closely monitored to detect anesthesia- or surgery-related complications. Pain medication may be administered if necessary. After patients are completely awake, they are moved to a hospital room to recover. Most individuals will be offered clear liquids the day after the surgery, then progress to a regular diet when the intestines start to function correctly. Patients are recommended to sit upon the edge of the bed and walk short distances several times a day. Moving is mandatory, and pain medication may be given if necessary. Full recovery from appendectomies takes about four to six weeks but can be prolonged to up to eight weeks if the appendix had ruptured.\n\n==Prognosis==\nMost people with appendicitis recover quickly after surgical treatment, but complications can occur if treatment is delayed and if [[peritonitis]] occurs. Recovery time depends on age, condition, complications, and other circumstances, including the amount of alcohol consumption, but usually is between 10 and 28 days. For young children (around ten years old), the recovery takes three weeks.\n\nThe possibility of peritonitis is the reason why acute appendicitis warrants rapid evaluation and treatment. People with suspected appendicitis may have to undergo a [[medical evacuation]]. Appendectomies have occasionally been performed in emergency conditions (i.e., not in a proper hospital) when a timely medical evacuation was impossible.\n\nTypical acute appendicitis responds quickly to appendectomy and occasionally will resolve spontaneously. If appendicitis resolves spontaneously, it remains controversial whether an elective interval appendectomy should be performed to prevent a recurrent episode of appendicitis. Atypical appendicitis (associated with suppurative appendicitis) is more challenging to diagnose and is more apt to be complicated even when operated early. In either condition, prompt diagnosis and appendectomy yield the best results with full recovery in two to four weeks usually. Mortality and severe complications are unusual but do occur, especially if peritonitis persists and is untreated.\n\nAnother entity known as the appendicular lump is talked about. It happens when the appendix is not removed early during infection, and omentum and intestine adhere to it, forming a palpable lump. During this period, surgery is risky unless there is pus formation evident by fever and toxicity or by USG. Medical management treats the condition.\n\nAn unusual complication of an appendectomy is \"stump appendicitis\": inflammation occurs in the remnant appendiceal stump left after a prior incomplete appendectomy.<ref name=\"pmid16536249\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Liang MK, Lo HG, Marks JL | title = Stump appendicitis: a comprehensive review of literature | journal = The American Surgeon | volume = 72 | issue = 2 | pages = 162\u20136 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16536249 | doi =  }}</ref> Stump appendicitis can occur months to years after initial appendectomy and can be identified with imaging modalities like ultrasound.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddan T, Corness J, Powell J, Harden F, Mengersen K |author5-link= Kerrie Mengersen |title=Stumped?

As the appendix becomes more swollen and inflamed, it begins to irritate the adjoining abdominal wall. This leads to the localization of the pain to [[Right lower quadrant (abdomen)|the right lower quadrant]]. This classic migration of pain may not be seen in children under three years. This pain can be elicited through signs and can be severe. Symptoms include localized findings in the right [[iliac fossa]]. The abdominal wall becomes very sensitive to gentle pressure ([[palpation]]). There is severe pain in the sudden release of deep tension in the lower abdomen ([[rebound tenderness]]). If the appendix is retrocecal (localized behind the [[cecum]]), even deep pressure in the right lower quadrant may fail to elicit tenderness (silent appendix). This is because the [[cecum]], distended with gas, protects the inflamed appendix from pressure.\nSimilarly, if the appendix lies entirely within the pelvis, there is typically a complete absence of abdominal rigidity. In such cases, a digital [[rectal examination]] elicits tenderness in the rectovesical pouch. Coughing causes point tenderness in this area ([[McBurney's point]]), historically called [[Dunphy sign|Dunphy's sign]].\n\n==Causes==\nAcute appendicitis seems to be the result of a primary obstruction of the appendix.<ref name=Wang1937>{{Cite journal|vauthors=[[Owen Harding Wangensteen|Wangensteen OH]], Bowers WF |title=Significance of the obstructive factor in the genesis of acute appendicitis |journal=Archives of Surgery |volume=34 |issue= 3|pages=496\u2013526 |year=1937|doi=10.1001/archsurg.1937.01190090121006}}</ref><ref name=Piep1982/> Once this obstruction occurs, the appendix becomes filled with [[mucus]] and swells. This continued production of mucus leads to increased pressures within the lumen and the walls of the appendix. The increased pressure results in [[thrombosis]] and [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]] of the small vessels, and stasis of [[Lymphatic system|lymphatic flow]]. At this point, spontaneous recovery rarely occurs. As the occlusion of blood vessels progresses, the appendix becomes [[Ischemia|ischemic]] and then [[Necrosis|necrotic]].

In pregnancy, it is more useful during the second and third trimester, particularly as the enlargening uterus displaces the appendix, making it difficult to find by ultrasound. The periappendiceal stranding that is reflected on CT by fat stranding on MRI appears as an increased fluid signal on T2 weighted sequences. First trimester pregnancies are usually not candidates for MRI, as the fetus is still undergoing organogenesis, and there are no long-term studies to date regarding its potential risks or side effects.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Burke LM, Bashir MR, Miller FH, Siegelman ES, Brown M, Alobaidy M, Jaffe TA, Hussain SM, Palmer SL, Garon BL, Oto A, Reinhold C, Ascher SM, Demulder DK, Thomas S, Best S, Borer J, Zhao K, Pinel-Giroux F, De Oliveira I, Resende D, Semelka RC | title = Magnetic resonance imaging of acute appendicitis in pregnancy: a 5-year multi-institutional study | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 213 | issue = 5 | pages = 693.e1\u20136 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26215327 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2015.07.026 }}</ref>\n\n====X-ray====\n[[File:AppendicolithPlainXray.png|thumb|Appendicolith as seen on plain X-ray]]\nIn general, plain abdominal radiography (PAR) is not useful in making the diagnosis of appendicitis and should not be routinely obtained from a person being evaluated for appendicitis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rao PM, Rhea JT, Rao JA, Conn AK | title = Plain abdominal radiography in clinically suspected appendicitis: diagnostic yield, resource use, and comparison with CT | journal = The American Journal of Emergency Medicine | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 325\u20138 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10452424 | doi = 10.1016/S0735-6757(99)90077-3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Boleslawski E, Panis Y, Benoist S, Denet C, Mariani P, Valleur P | title = Plain abdominal radiography as a routine procedure for acute abdominal pain of the right lower quadrant: prospective evaluation | journal = World Journal of Surgery | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 262\u20134 | date = March 1999 | pmid = 9933697 | doi = 10.1007/pl00013181 }}</ref> Plain abdominal films may be useful for the detection of [[ureter]]al [[calculus (medicine)|calculi]], [[small bowel obstruction]], or [[perforated ulcer]], but these conditions are rarely confused with appendicitis.<ref name=Sabiston>[http://www.uptomed.ir/Digimed.ir/sabiston-2009/Sabiston_2009/HTML/473.htm APPENDICITIS from Townsend: Sabiston Textbook of Surgery on MD Consult<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203014844/http://www.uptomed.ir/Digimed.ir/sabiston-2009/Sabiston_2009/HTML/473.htm |date=December 3, 2013 }}</ref> An opaque [[fecalith]] can be identified in the right lower quadrant in fewer than 5% of people being evaluated for appendicitis.<ref name=CDEM/> A [[barium enema]] has proven to be a poor diagnostic tool for appendicitis.

The incision is two to three inches (76&nbsp;mm) long, and it is made in the right lower abdomen, several inches above the [[hip bone]]. Once the incision opens the abdomen cavity, and the appendix is identified, the [[surgeon]] removes the infected tissue and cuts the appendix from the surrounding tissue. After careful and close inspection of the infected area, and ensuring there are no signs that surrounding tissues are damaged or infected.  In case of complicated appendicitis managed by an emergency open appendectomy, abdominal drainage (a temporary tube from the abdomen to the outside to avoid abscess formation) may be inserted, but this may increase the hospital stay.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li Z, Zhao L, Cheng Y, Cheng N, Deng Y | title = Abdominal drainage to prevent intra-peritoneal abscess after open appendectomy for complicated appendicitis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = CD010168 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29741752 | pmc = 6494575 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010168.pub3 }}</ref> The surgeon will start closing the incision. This means sewing the muscles and using [[surgical staple]]s or [[surgical suture|stitches]] to close the skin up.

This type of appendectomy is made by inserting a special surgical tool called a laparoscope into one of the incisions. The laparoscope is connected to a monitor outside the person's body, and it is designed to help the surgeon to inspect the infected area in the abdomen. The other two incisions are made for the specific removal of the appendix by using [[surgical instrument]]s. Laparoscopic surgery requires [[general anesthesia]], and it can last up to two hours. Laparoscopic appendectomy has several advantages over open appendectomy, including a shorter post-operative recovery, less post-operative pain, and lower superficial surgical site infection rate. However, the occurrence of an intra-abdominal abscess is almost three times more prevalent in laparoscopic appendectomy than open appendectomy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Siewert B, Raptopoulos V, Liu SI, Hodin RA, Davis RB, Rosen MP | title = CT predictors of failed laparoscopic appendectomy | journal = Radiology | volume = 229 | issue = 2 | pages = 415\u201320 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14595145 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2292020825 }}</ref>\n\n====Pre-surgery====\nThe treatment begins by [[Nil per os|keeping the person who will be having surgery from eating or drinking]] for a given period, usually overnight. An [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous drip]] is used to hydrate the person who will be having surgery. [[Antibiotic]]s given intravenously such as [[cefuroxime]] and [[metronidazole]] may be administered early to help kill bacteria and thus reduce the spread of infection in the abdomen and postoperative complications in the abdomen or wound. Equivocal cases may become more difficult to assess with antibiotic treatment and benefit from serial examinations. If the stomach is empty (no food in the past six hours), general anaesthesia is usually used. Otherwise, [[spinal anaesthesia]] may be used.\n\nOnce the decision to perform an [[appendectomy]] has been made, the preparation procedure takes approximately one to two hours. Meanwhile, the surgeon will explain the surgery procedure and will present the risks that must be considered when performing an appendectomy. (With all surgeries there are risks that must be evaluated before performing the procedures.) The risks are different depending on the state of the appendix. If the appendix has not ruptured, the complication rate is only about 3% but if the appendix has ruptured, the complication rate rises to almost 59%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/A-Ce/Appendectomy.html |title=Appendicitis |work=Encyclopedia of Surgery |access-date=2010-02-01 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209031325/http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/A-Ce/Appendectomy.html |archive-date=2010-02-09 }}</ref> The most usual complications that can occur are pneumonia, [[hernia]] of the incision, [[thrombophlebitis]], bleeding and [[adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]].

Abdomen hair is usually removed to avoid complications that may appear regarding the incision.\n\nIn most cases, patients going in for surgery experience nausea and vomiting that require medication before surgery. Antibiotics, along with pain medication, may be administrated before appendectomies.\n\n====After surgery====\n[[File:Stitches post appendicitis surgery.jpg|thumb|The [[surgical suture|stitches]] the day after having the appendix removed by laparoscopic surgery]]\nHospital lengths of stay typically range from a few hours to a few days but can be a few weeks if complications occur. The recovery process may vary depending on the severity of the condition: if the appendix had ruptured or not before surgery. Appendix surgery recovery is generally a lot faster if the appendix did not rupture.<ref>[http://appendixsurgery.net Appendicitis surgery, removal and recovery] Retrieved on 2010-02-01  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111221304/http://appendixsurgery.net/ |date=January 11, 2010 }}</ref> It is important that people undergoing surgery respect their doctor's advice and limit their physical activity so the [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] can heal faster. Recovery after an appendectomy may not require diet changes or a lifestyle change.\n\nThe length of hospital stays for appendicitis varies on the severity of the condition. A study from the United States found that in 2010, the average appendicitis hospital stay was 1.8 days. For stays where the person's appendix had ruptured, the average length of stay was 5.2 days.<ref name=Barrett2013/>\n\nAfter surgery, the patient will be transferred to a [[postanesthesia care unit]], so his or her vital signs can be closely monitored to detect anesthesia- or surgery-related complications. Pain medication may be administered if necessary. After patients are completely awake, they are moved to a hospital room to recover. Most individuals will be offered clear liquids the day after the surgery, then progress to a regular diet when the intestines start to function correctly. Patients are recommended to sit upon the edge of the bed and walk short distances several times a day. Moving is mandatory, and pain medication may be given if necessary. Full recovery from appendectomies takes about four to six weeks but can be prolonged to up to eight weeks if the appendix had ruptured.\n\n==Prognosis==\nMost people with appendicitis recover quickly after surgical treatment, but complications can occur if treatment is delayed and if [[peritonitis]] occurs. Recovery time depends on age, condition, complications, and other circumstances, including the amount of alcohol consumption, but usually is between 10 and 28 days. For young children (around ten years old), the recovery takes three weeks.\n\nThe possibility of peritonitis is the reason why acute appendicitis warrants rapid evaluation and treatment. People with suspected appendicitis may have to undergo a [[medical evacuation]]. Appendectomies have occasionally been performed in emergency conditions (i.e., not in a proper hospital) when a timely medical evacuation was impossible.\n\nTypical acute appendicitis responds quickly to appendectomy and occasionally will resolve spontaneously. If appendicitis resolves spontaneously, it remains controversial whether an elective interval appendectomy should be performed to prevent a recurrent episode of appendicitis. Atypical appendicitis (associated with suppurative appendicitis) is more challenging to diagnose and is more apt to be complicated even when operated early. In either condition, prompt diagnosis and appendectomy yield the best results with full recovery in two to four weeks usually. Mortality and severe complications are unusual but do occur, especially if peritonitis persists and is untreated.\n\nAnother entity known as the appendicular lump is talked about. It happens when the appendix is not removed early during infection, and omentum and intestine adhere to it, forming a palpable lump.

He became a priest in 1776 and served in that capacity in Ireland for more than four decades. After the Pope declined to appoint him [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archbishop of Armagh]], the diocese in which he served as Vicar General, he was instead installed as the second [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Bishop of Philadelphia]] in 1819. Conwell took up the post at an advanced age, and spent much of his time there feuding with the lay trustees of his parishes, especially those of [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia. When Conwell removed and excommunicated [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism. The two sides partially reconciled by 1826, but the Vatican hierarchy believed Conwell had ceded too much power to the laymen in the process, and recalled him to Rome. Although he retained his position, Conwell was compelled to relinquish actual control to his [[coadjutor bishop]], [[Francis Kenrick]]. He remained in Philadelphia and performed some priestly duties, but for all practical purposes no longer ran the diocese. He died there in 1842 at the age of about 94.\n\n==Early life and priesthood==\nConwell was born about 1748 in [[Moneymore]], [[County Londonderry]], Ireland (present-day [[Northern Ireland]]), the son of Owen Conwell and his wife, Mary (Keegan) Conwell.{{efn|Earlier sources give Conwell's date of birth as about 1745, but an Irish researcher, Brother Luke of De La Salle Monastery in [[Muine Bheag]], later discovered evidence that it was likely 1748.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}}}{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}} He studied at the [[Irish College in Paris]] and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the priesthood there in November 1776.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} Conwell was well-educated, being fluent in Latin, French, Spanish, and Italian, but had a reputation as a preacher of only modest ability.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=166}} Around 1785, he contemplated moving to the United States but was concerned about the still uncertain financial state of the new country's parishes, and ultimately decided not to apply for a position there.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} He was appointed [[parish priest]] of [[Dungannon]] in 1792 or 1793 and [[Vicar General]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archdiocese of Armagh]] in 1794.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} After the death of Archbishop [[Richard O'Reilly]] in 1818, Conwell served as acting Archbishop.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}}\n\n==Bishop of Philadelphia==\n===Ordination===\nMany of the clergy who served under him in Armagh recommended that the Pope appoint Conwell to head the diocese permanently.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Some opposed him, accusing him of being frequently absent from his parish to visit France and Scotland.{{sfn|MacAuley|1982|pp=342\u2013343}} The British government also objected, favoring [[Patrick Curtis]] instead, as they saw him as more friendly to their interests.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} The Vatican agreed,{{Failed verification|date=April 2020}} and [[Pope Pius VII]] appointed Curtis to Armagh, offering Conwell instead a choice of the [[Episcopal see|sees]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] or [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madras and Mylapore|Madras]]; Conwell chose Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Now more than 70 years old, he was ordained bishop in London on September 24, 1819, by Bishop [[William Poynter]], the [[Vicar Apostolic of the London District]], assisted by Fathers [[James Bramston (bishop)|James Bramston]] and [[Joseph Francis Carpue]].{{efn|Although three bishops are typically required for ordination, the Pope may issue a dispensation when co-consecrators are unavailable.{{sfn|Code of Canon Law}} }}{{sfn|Bransom|1990|p=13}}\n\nThe see of Philadelphia had been vacant since the death of Bishop [[Michael Francis Egan]] in 1814, despite several efforts to fill it.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}} Archbishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] of Baltimore, whose [[Ecclesiastical province|province]] included Philadelphia, had considered no fewer than fifteen priests for the position; some had been ruled out for one reason or another, and others (including the apostolic administrator, [[Louis de Barth]]) had turned the job down.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} Part of the delay was logistical\u2014Carroll was unsure of the exact procedure for selecting a candidate in the recently erected province\u2014but part was due to the perceived undesirability of the post, which oversaw only a few small churches in a part of the nation with few Catholics.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} There was also a significant dispute (known as [[trusteeism]]) over the rights of churches' [[Laity|lay]] trustees that was likely to complicate the job of running the diocese. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property, and erected the church buildings. Those laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who held the traditional view of parish organization.{{sfn|Carey|1978|pp=357\u2013358}} In a larger sense, the dispute represented a difference in understandings of authority between Americans and Europeans.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|p=368}}\n\n===Hogan schism===\n[[File:Old St. Mary's Church.jpg|thumb|[[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia was the epicenter of the disputes that overshadowed Conwell's episcopate.]]\nConwell arrived in [[Philadelphia]] on December 2, 1820.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy preceding his arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], approached de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1913|pp=23\u201324}} After only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan was assigned to [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} Hogan's other behavior created tension between him and Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already moved out of the priests' residence at [[Old St. Joseph's Church]] to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell nor anyone else had the right to say where he should live.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}}\n\nLater that week, Conwell called a meeting of the city's priests and announced that Hogan was suspended.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} The St. Mary's trustees took Hogan's side, while Conwell condemned the trustees as \"despicable ex-Catholics\" and \"the worst sort of [[Jacobin]]s\".{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=92}} In the meantime, Conwell recalled a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]]\u2014William Vincent Harold, whom his predecessor had dismissed\u2014to assist him.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The St. Mary's trustees had quarreled with Harold in the past, and his recall increased their mistrust of Conwell.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The schism continued as St. Mary's refused to recognize Conwell's authority over them or Hogan, explicitly excluding Conwell from their board and electing Hogan in his place. Since they had rebelled against the Church hierarchy, Conwell declared Hogan [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunicated]] in a public statement on May 27, 1821.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=94}}\n\nIn 1822, Conwell showed his support for Harold by appointing him as Vicar General of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The Hogan schism took on new dimensions, however, when Hogan was charged with rape and battery.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} Philadelphia mayor [[Robert Wharton (Philadelphia)|Robert Wharton]] presided over the trial, which captured the city's attention.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|pp=357\u2013359}} Although the jury found him not guilty, Hogan's image was harmed.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} A letter from the Pope sided with Conwell but, after initially agreeing to leave the diocese, Hogan reversed himself and stayed on.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} The pro-Hogan faction prevailed at St. Mary's trustee elections that year amid bloody rioting between parish members.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} The next year, 1823, some Hogan supporters convinced a local woman to bring a paternity suit against Conwell, but the charges were dismissed quickly and the complainant was convicted of [[perjury]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} In an 1824 letter to the ''[[National Gazette]],'' Hogan proposed the creation of an \"American Catholic Church\" with more independence from Rome.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}}\n\nBy this time, Hogan had begun to lose the trustees' support.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}} At some point soon thereafter, he left the city.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} In the hope of healing the schism, in October 1826 Conwell partially capitulated to the trustees, yielding to them the right of determining salaries and of vetoing his appointments.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} In return, they recognized him as bishop and senior pastor of the church.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=100}} The bishop would henceforth appoint St. Mary's pastor, but the trustees would be permitted to arbitrate any disagreements on appointments before a neutral board.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=100}}\n\n===Recall to Rome===\nThe trustees soon renounced the agreement. When word of the compromise reached the [[Holy See]], the Vatican also objected, condemning Conwell's surrender of episcopal rights. Harold, writing to Rome, claimed that Conwell had had little to do with the compromise, which he blamed on Father [[Michael Hurley (19th-century priest)|Michael Hurley]] and Conwell's Protestant lawyer, Josiah Randall.{{efn|Josiah Randall would soon become the father of [[Samuel J. Randall]], a future [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]].{{sfn|House|1934|pp=1\u20135}} }}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} Conwell saw Harold's conduct as a betrayal, and removed him as Vicar General, appointing Hurley in his place.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} The trustees put aside their former enmity for Harold and took his side against Conwell, going so far as to petition Rome for Conwell's removal as bishop.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} By this time, as Arthur Ennis wrote in 1976, the \"old and confused\" Conwell considered leaving the diocese if he could secure another see in Ireland.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=102}} In 1827, the Vatican's ''[[Propaganda Fide]]'' formally rejected Conwell's pact with the trustees, condemning Hurley's role in the process, as well.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=102}} They summoned Conwell to Rome.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}}\n\n[[Ambrose Mar\u00e9chal]], who was now Archbishop of Baltimore, was ordered to oversee the diocese in Conwell's absence, and he appointed a priest from his diocese, [[William Matthews (priest)|William Matthews]], as apostolic administrator.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=103}} Conwell sailed for Rome on July 12, 1828.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Once there, Conwell was ordered to give a report of all that had transpired. While forbidden to return to his diocese, he was promised that after a full explanation, he would be permitted to reside anywhere in Europe.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} He left Rome secretly in 1829, and when his absence was discovered, the Pope decreed he would be suspended from office if he returned to Philadelphia.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Conwell did return to Philadelphia, however, in October of that year, and traveled from there to Baltimore, where the [[Provincial Councils of Baltimore|First Provincial Council of Baltimore]] was in session.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\n===Retirement===\n[[File:2013 Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul from across the Benjamin Franklin Parkway 2.jpg|thumb|Conwell is buried in the crypt of the [[Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul (Philadelphia)|Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul]] along with most other bishops of Philadelphia.]]\nIn Baltimore, Conwell professed his obedience to Rome and swore he would gladly retire from active governance of his diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} The following year, the Vatican appointed [[Francis Kenrick]] as Conwell's [[coadjutor bishop]] with the right of succession and named him administrator of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Conwell never gave up his titles or his claim to exercise authority in the diocese, and his relationship with Kenrick remained rocky.{{sfn|Barr|2008|p=615}} He received permission to resume performing [[liturgy|liturgical]] functions without any say in administration, and spent his remaining years in seclusion and prayer.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} He lived on for several years, although he lost his sight, preventing him from performing most of his few remaining duties.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\nConwell died on April 22, 1842, at about the age of 94.{{sfn|Nolan|1976|p=163}} Kenrick succeeded to the title of bishop of Philadelphia. Conwell's death led to one final controversy, as the old bishop's nephews and nieces sued for possession of the Bishop's Burial Ground, claiming it had been Conwell's private possession.{{sfn|Nolan|1976|p=163}} After the threat of excommunication, they withdrew their claim.{{sfn|Nolan|1976|p=163}} Conwell's remains were buried in St. Mary's churchyard.

He became a priest in 1776 and served in that capacity in Ireland for more than four decades. After the Pope declined to appoint him [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archbishop of Armagh]], the diocese in which he served as Vicar General, he was instead installed as the second [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Bishop of Philadelphia]] in 1819. Conwell took up the post at an advanced age, and spent much of his time there feuding with the lay trustees of his parishes, especially those of [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia. When Conwell removed and excommunicated [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism. The two sides partially reconciled by 1826, but the Vatican hierarchy believed Conwell had ceded too much power to the laymen in the process, and recalled him to Rome. Although he retained his position, Conwell was compelled to relinquish actual control to his [[coadjutor bishop]], [[Francis Kenrick]]. He remained in Philadelphia and performed some priestly duties, but for all practical purposes no longer ran the diocese. He died there in 1842 at the age of about 94.\n\n==Early life and priesthood==\nConwell was born about 1748 in [[Moneymore]], [[County Londonderry]], Ireland (present-day [[Northern Ireland]]), the son of Owen Conwell and his wife, Mary (Keegan) Conwell.{{efn|Earlier sources give Conwell's date of birth as about 1745, but an Irish researcher, Brother Luke of De La Salle Monastery in [[Muine Bheag]], later discovered evidence that it was likely 1748.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}}}{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}} He studied at the [[Irish College in Paris]] and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the priesthood there in November 1776.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} Conwell was well-educated, being fluent in Latin, French, Spanish, and Italian, but had a reputation as a preacher of only modest ability.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=166}} Around 1785, he contemplated moving to the United States but was concerned about the still uncertain financial state of the new country's parishes, and ultimately decided not to apply for a position there.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} He was appointed [[parish priest]] of [[Dungannon]] in 1792 or 1793 and [[Vicar General]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archdiocese of Armagh]] in 1794.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} After the death of Archbishop [[Richard O'Reilly]] in 1818, Conwell served as acting Archbishop.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}}\n\n==Bishop of Philadelphia==\n===Ordination===\nMany of the clergy who served under him in Armagh recommended that the Pope appoint Conwell to head the diocese permanently.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Some opposed him, accusing him of being frequently absent from his parish to visit France and Scotland.{{sfn|MacAuley|1982|pp=342\u2013343}} The British government also objected, favoring [[Patrick Curtis]] instead, as they saw him as more friendly to their interests.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} The Vatican agreed,{{Failed verification|date=April 2020}} and [[Pope Pius VII]] appointed Curtis to Armagh, offering Conwell instead a choice of the [[Episcopal see|sees]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] or [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madras and Mylapore|Madras]]; Conwell chose Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Now more than 70 years old, he was ordained bishop in London on September 24, 1819, by Bishop [[William Poynter]], the [[Vicar Apostolic of the London District]], assisted by Fathers [[James Bramston (bishop)|James Bramston]] and [[Joseph Francis Carpue]].{{efn|Although three bishops are typically required for ordination, the Pope may issue a dispensation when co-consecrators are unavailable.{{sfn|Code of Canon Law}} }}{{sfn|Bransom|1990|p=13}}\n\nThe see of Philadelphia had been vacant since the death of Bishop [[Michael Francis Egan]] in 1814, despite several efforts to fill it.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}} Archbishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] of Baltimore, whose [[Ecclesiastical province|province]] included Philadelphia, had considered no fewer than fifteen priests for the position; some had been ruled out for one reason or another, and others (including the apostolic administrator, [[Louis de Barth]]) had turned the job down.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} Part of the delay was logistical\u2014Carroll was unsure of the exact procedure for selecting a candidate in the recently erected province\u2014but part was due to the perceived undesirability of the post, which oversaw only a few small churches in a part of the nation with few Catholics.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} There was also a significant dispute (known as [[trusteeism]]) over the rights of churches' [[Laity|lay]] trustees that was likely to complicate the job of running the diocese. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property, and erected the church buildings. Those laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who held the traditional view of parish organization.{{sfn|Carey|1978|pp=357\u2013358}} In a larger sense, the dispute represented a difference in understandings of authority between Americans and Europeans.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|p=368}}\n\n===Hogan schism===\n[[File:Old St. Mary's Church.jpg|thumb|[[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia was the epicenter of the disputes that overshadowed Conwell's episcopate.]]\nConwell arrived in [[Philadelphia]] on December 2, 1820.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy preceding his arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], approached de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1913|pp=23\u201324}} After only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan was assigned to [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} Hogan's other behavior created tension between him and Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already moved out of the priests' residence at [[Old St. Joseph's Church]] to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell nor anyone else had the right to say where he should live.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}}\n\nLater that week, Conwell called a meeting of the city's priests and announced that Hogan was suspended.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} The St. Mary's trustees took Hogan's side, while Conwell condemned the trustees as \"despicable ex-Catholics\" and \"the worst sort of [[Jacobin]]s\".{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=92}} In the meantime, Conwell recalled a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]]\u2014William Vincent Harold, whom his predecessor had dismissed\u2014to assist him.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The St. Mary's trustees had quarreled with Harold in the past, and his recall increased their mistrust of Conwell.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The schism continued as St. Mary's refused to recognize Conwell's authority over them or Hogan, explicitly excluding Conwell from their board and electing Hogan in his place. Since they had rebelled against the Church hierarchy, Conwell declared Hogan [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunicated]] in a public statement on May 27, 1821.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=94}}\n\nIn 1822, Conwell showed his support for Harold by appointing him as Vicar General of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The Hogan schism took on new dimensions, however, when Hogan was charged with rape and battery.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} Philadelphia mayor [[Robert Wharton (Philadelphia)|Robert Wharton]] presided over the trial, which captured the city's attention.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|pp=357\u2013359}} Although the jury found him not guilty, Hogan's image was harmed.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} A letter from the Pope sided with Conwell but, after initially agreeing to leave the diocese, Hogan reversed himself and stayed on.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} The pro-Hogan faction prevailed at St. Mary's trustee elections that year amid bloody rioting between parish members.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} The next year, 1823, some Hogan supporters convinced a local woman to bring a paternity suit against Conwell, but the charges were dismissed quickly and the complainant was convicted of [[perjury]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} In an 1824 letter to the ''[[National Gazette]],'' Hogan proposed the creation of an \"American Catholic Church\" with more independence from Rome.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}}\n\nBy this time, Hogan had begun to lose the trustees' support.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}} At some point soon thereafter, he left the city.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} In the hope of healing the schism, in October 1826 Conwell partially capitulated to the trustees, yielding to them the right of determining salaries and of vetoing his appointments.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} In return, they recognized him as bishop and senior pastor of the church.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=100}} The bishop would henceforth appoint St. Mary's pastor, but the trustees would be permitted to arbitrate any disagreements on appointments before a neutral board.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=100}}\n\n===Recall to Rome===\nThe trustees soon renounced the agreement. When word of the compromise reached the [[Holy See]], the Vatican also objected, condemning Conwell's surrender of episcopal rights. Harold, writing to Rome, claimed that Conwell had had little to do with the compromise, which he blamed on Father [[Michael Hurley (19th-century priest)|Michael Hurley]] and Conwell's Protestant lawyer, Josiah Randall.{{efn|Josiah Randall would soon become the father of [[Samuel J. Randall]], a future [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]].{{sfn|House|1934|pp=1\u20135}} }}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} Conwell saw Harold's conduct as a betrayal, and removed him as Vicar General, appointing Hurley in his place.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} The trustees put aside their former enmity for Harold and took his side against Conwell, going so far as to petition Rome for Conwell's removal as bishop.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} By this time, as Arthur Ennis wrote in 1976, the \"old and confused\" Conwell considered leaving the diocese if he could secure another see in Ireland.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=102}} In 1827, the Vatican's ''[[Propaganda Fide]]'' formally rejected Conwell's pact with the trustees, condemning Hurley's role in the process, as well.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=102}} They summoned Conwell to Rome.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}}\n\n[[Ambrose Mar\u00e9chal]], who was now Archbishop of Baltimore, was ordered to oversee the diocese in Conwell's absence, and he appointed a priest from his diocese, [[William Matthews (priest)|William Matthews]], as apostolic administrator.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=103}} Conwell sailed for Rome on July 12, 1828.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Once there, Conwell was ordered to give a report of all that had transpired. While forbidden to return to his diocese, he was promised that after a full explanation, he would be permitted to reside anywhere in Europe.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} He left Rome secretly in 1829, and when his absence was discovered, the Pope decreed he would be suspended from office if he returned to Philadelphia.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Conwell did return to Philadelphia, however, in October of that year, and traveled from there to Baltimore, where the [[Provincial Councils of Baltimore|First Provincial Council of Baltimore]] was in session.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\n===Retirement===\n[[File:2013 Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul from across the Benjamin Franklin Parkway 2.jpg|thumb|Conwell is buried in the crypt of the [[Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul (Philadelphia)|Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul]] along with most other bishops of Philadelphia.]]\nIn Baltimore, Conwell professed his obedience to Rome and swore he would gladly retire from active governance of his diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} The following year, the Vatican appointed [[Francis Kenrick]] as Conwell's [[coadjutor bishop]] with the right of succession and named him administrator of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Conwell never gave up his titles or his claim to exercise authority in the diocese, and his relationship with Kenrick remained rocky.{{sfn|Barr|2008|p=615}} He received permission to resume performing [[liturgy|liturgical]] functions without any say in administration, and spent his remaining years in seclusion and prayer.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} He lived on for several years, although he lost his sight, preventing him from performing most of his few remaining duties.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\nConwell died on April 22, 1842, at about the age of 94.{{sfn|Nolan|1976|p=163}} Kenrick succeeded to the title of bishop of Philadelphia. Conwell's death led to one final controversy, as the old bishop's nephews and nieces sued for possession of the Bishop's Burial Ground, claiming it had been Conwell's private possession.{{sfn|Nolan|1976|p=163}} After the threat of excommunication, they withdrew their claim.{{sfn|Nolan|1976|p=163}} Conwell's remains were buried in St. Mary's churchyard.
