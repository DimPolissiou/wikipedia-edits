It was discovered in 1799, and eventually led to the ability to decipher ancient hieroglyphs. Although the Rosetta Stone was discovered by the French, it actually never made it to the Louvre Museum.

During [[German occupation of France during World War II|Nazi occupation]], thousands of artworks were stolen. But after the war, 61,233 articles of more than 150,000 seized artworks returned to France and were assigned to the Louvre's Office des Biens Priv\u00e9s. In 1949, it entrusted 2,130 unclaimed pieces (including 1,001 paintings) to the Direction des Mus\u00e9es de France in order to keep them under appropriate conditions of conservation until their restitution and meanwhile classified them as MNRs (Mus\u00e9es Nationaux Recuperation or, in English, the National Museums of Recovered Artwork). Some 10% to 35% of the pieces are believed to come from Jewish spoliations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/documentation/mnr/Matteoli/RM-musees-nationaux.pdf |title=Rapport Matteoli, Le pillage de l'art en France pendant l'occupation et la situation des 2000 oeuvres confi\u00e9es aux Mus\u00e9es nationaux, pp. 50, 60, 69 |accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref> and until the identification of their rightful owners, which declined at the end of the 1960s, they are registered indefinitely on separate inventories from the museum's collections.\n\nThey were exhibited in 1946 and shown all together to the public during four years (1950\u20131954) in order to allow rightful claimants to identify their properties, then stored or displayed, according to their interest, in several French museums including the Louvre. From 1951 to 1965, about 37 pieces were restituted. Since November 1996, the partly illustrated catalogue of 1947\u20131949 has been accessible online and completed. In 1997, Prime Minister [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] initiated the Matt\u00e9oli Commission, headed by [[Jean Matt\u00e9oli]], to investigate the matter and according to the government, the Louvre is in charge of 678&nbsp;pieces of artwork still unclaimed by their rightful owners.<ref>Rickman, p.&nbsp;294</ref> During the late 1990s, the comparison of the American war archives, which had not been done before, with the French and German ones as well as two court cases which finally settled some of the heirs' rights (Gentili di Giuseppe and Rosenberg families) allowed more accurate investigations. Since 1996, the restitutions, according sometimes to less formal criteria, concerned 47 more pieces (26 paintings, with 6 from the Louvre including a then displayed Tiepolo), until the last claims of French owners and their heirs ended again in 2006.\n\nAccording to [[Serge Klarsfeld]], since the now complete and constant publicity which the artworks got in 1996, the majority of the French Jewish community is nevertheless in favour of the return to the normal French civil rule of ''prescription acquisitive'' of any unclaimed good after another long period of time and consequently to their ultimate integration into the common French heritage instead of their transfer to foreign institutions like during World War II.\n\nNapoleon's campaigns acquired Italian pieces by treaties, as war reparations, and Northern European pieces as spoils as well as some antiquities excavated in Egypt, though the vast majority of the latter were seized as war reparations by the British army and are now part of collections of the [[British Museum]]. On the other hand, the [[Dendera zodiac]] is, like the [[Rosetta Stone]], claimed by Egypt even though it was acquired in 1821, before the Egyptian Anti-export legislation of 1835. The Louvre administration has thus argued in favor of retaining this item despite requests by Egypt for its return.

It was home to the former [[Tuileries Palace]], which closed off the western end of the Louvre entrance courtyard, but was heavily damaged by fire during the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871 and later demolished. The adjacent [[Tuileries Gardens]], created in 1564 by Catherine de' Medici, was designed in 1664 by [[Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre]]. The gardens house the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]], a [[contemporary art]] exhibition space which was used to store confiscated Jewish cultural property during the 1940 to 1944 German occupation of France.<ref name=\"Frommer\">Mroue, p.&nbsp;176</ref> Parallel to the Jeu de Paume is the Orangerie, home to the famous ''[[Water Lilies]]'' paintings by [[Claude Monet]].\n\nThe Louvre is slightly askew of the Historic Axis (''[[Axe historique]]''), a roughly eight-kilometre (five-mile) architectural line bisecting the city. It begins on the east in the Louvre courtyard and runs west along the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]]. In 1871, the burning of the Tuileries Palace by the [[Paris Commune]] revealed that the Louvre was slightly askew of the ''Axe'' despite past appearances to the contrary.<ref>Rogers, p. 159</ref> The Louvre can be reached by the [[Palais Royal - Mus\u00e9e du Louvre (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Palais Royal&nbsp;\u2013 Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]] [[Paris Metro|M\u00e9tro]] or the [[Louvre - Rivoli (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Louvre-Rivoli]] stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.louvre.fr/llv/pratique/venir.jsp |title=How to get here |work=Louvre Museum |accessdate=28 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921232331/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/pratique/venir.jsp |archivedate=21 September 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe Louvre has three entrances: the main entrance at the pyramid, an entrance from the [[Carrousel du Louvre]] underground shopping mall, and an entrance at the Porte des Lions (near the western end of the Denon wing).\n\nUnder the main entrance to the museum is the [[Carrousel du Louvre]], a shopping mall operated by [[Unibail-Rodamco]].

During [[German occupation of France during World War II|Nazi occupation]], thousands of artworks were stolen. But after the war, 61,233 articles of more than 150,000 seized artworks returned to France and were assigned to the Louvre's Office des Biens Priv\u00e9s. In 1949, it entrusted 2,130 unclaimed pieces (including 1,001 paintings) to the Direction des Mus\u00e9es de France in order to keep them under appropriate conditions of conservation until their restitution and meanwhile classified them as MNRs (Mus\u00e9es Nationaux Recuperation or, in English, the National Museums of Recovered Artwork). Some 10% to 35% of the pieces are believed to come from Jewish spoliations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/documentation/mnr/Matteoli/RM-musees-nationaux.pdf |title=Rapport Matteoli, Le pillage de l'art en France pendant l'occupation et la situation des 2000 oeuvres confi\u00e9es aux Mus\u00e9es nationaux, pp. 50, 60, 69 |accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref> and until the identification of their rightful owners, which declined at the end of the 1960s, they are registered indefinitely on separate inventories from the museum's collections.\n\nThey were exhibited in 1946 and shown all together to the public during four years (1950\u20131954) in order to allow rightful claimants to identify their properties, then stored or displayed, according to their interest, in several French museums including the Louvre. From 1951 to 1965, about 37 pieces were restituted. Since November 1996, the partly illustrated catalogue of 1947\u20131949 has been accessible online and completed. In 1997, Prime Minister [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] initiated the Matt\u00e9oli Commission, headed by [[Jean Matt\u00e9oli]], to investigate the matter and according to the government, the Louvre is in charge of 678&nbsp;pieces of artwork still unclaimed by their rightful owners.<ref>Rickman, p.&nbsp;294</ref> During the late 1990s, the comparison of the American war archives, which had not been done before, with the French and German ones as well as two court cases which finally settled some of the heirs' rights (Gentili di Giuseppe and Rosenberg families) allowed more accurate investigations. Since 1996, the restitutions, according sometimes to less formal criteria, concerned 47 more pieces (26 paintings, with 6 from the Louvre including a then displayed Tiepolo), until the last claims of French owners and their heirs ended again in 2006.\n\nAccording to [[Serge Klarsfeld]], since the now complete and constant publicity which the artworks got in 1996, the majority of the French Jewish community is nevertheless in favour of the return to the normal French civil rule of ''prescription acquisitive'' of any unclaimed good after another long period of time and consequently to their ultimate integration into the common French heritage instead of their transfer to foreign institutions like during World War II.\n\nNapoleon's campaigns acquired Italian pieces by treaties, as war reparations, and Northern European pieces as spoils as well as some antiquities excavated in Egypt, though the vast majority of the latter were seized as war reparations by the British army and are now part of collections of the [[British Museum]]. On the other hand, the [[Dendera zodiac]] is, like the [[Rosetta Stone]], claimed by Egypt even though it was acquired in 1821, before the Egyptian Anti-export legislation of 1835. The Louvre administration has thus argued in favor of retaining this item despite requests by Egypt for its return.

The gardens house the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]], a [[contemporary art]] exhibition space which was used to store confiscated Jewish cultural property during the 1940 to 1944 German occupation of France.<ref name=\"Frommer\">Mroue, p.&nbsp;176</ref> Parallel to the Jeu de Paume is the Orangerie, home to the famous ''[[Water Lilies]]'' paintings by [[Claude Monet]].\n\nThe Louvre is slightly askew of the Historic Axis (''[[Axe historique]]''), a roughly eight-kilometre (five-mile) architectural line bisecting the city. It begins on the east in the Louvre courtyard and runs west along the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]]. In 1871, the burning of the Tuileries Palace by the [[Paris Commune]] revealed that the Louvre was slightly askew of the ''Axe'' despite past appearances to the contrary.<ref>Rogers, p. 159</ref> The Louvre can be reached by the [[Palais Royal - Mus\u00e9e du Louvre (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Palais Royal&nbsp;\u2013 Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]] [[Paris Metro|M\u00e9tro]] or the [[Louvre - Rivoli (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Louvre-Rivoli]] stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.louvre.fr/llv/pratique/venir.jsp |title=How to get here |work=Louvre Museum |accessdate=28 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921232331/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/pratique/venir.jsp |archivedate=21 September 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe Louvre has three entrances: the main entrance at the pyramid, an entrance from the [[Carrousel du Louvre]] underground shopping mall, and an entrance at the Porte des Lions (near the western end of the Denon wing).\n\nUnder the main entrance to the museum is the [[Carrousel du Louvre]], a shopping mall operated by [[Unibail-Rodamco]].

He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a [[Universal suffrage|fully representative]] democratic election. [[Presidency of Nelson Mandela|His government]] focused on dismantling the legacy of [[apartheid]] by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial [[Conflict resolution|reconciliation]]. Ideologically an [[African nationalism|African nationalist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]], he served as the president of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.\n\n<!--Early life and revolutionary activity-->\nA [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]], Mandela was born to the [[Thembu]] royal family in [[Mvezo]], [[Union of South Africa]]. He studied law at the [[University of Fort Hare]] and the [[University of Witwatersrand]] before working as a lawyer in [[Johannesburg]]. There he became involved in [[anti-colonial]] and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its [[African National Congress Youth League|Youth League]] in 1944. After the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]]'s [[Dominant minority|white-only government]] established apartheid, a system of [[racial segregation]] that privileged [[White South African|whites]], he and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow. Mandela was appointed President of the ANC's [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 [[Defiance Campaign]] and the 1955 [[Congress of the People (1955)|Congress of the People]]. He was repeatedly arrested for [[seditious]] activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the [[1956 Treason Trial]]. Influenced by [[Marxism]], he secretly joined the banned [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] in 1961 and led a [[sabotage]] campaign against the government. He was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state following the [[Rivonia Trial]].\n\n<!--Imprisonment and Mandela's government-->\nMandela served 27 years in prison, split between [[Robben Island]], [[Pollsmoor Prison]], and [[Victor Verster Prison]]. Amid growing domestic and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war, President [[F. W. de Klerk]] released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the [[1994 South African general election|1994 multiracial general election]] in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became president. Leading a [[Government of National Unity (South Africa)|broad coalition government]] which promulgated a [[Constitution of South Africa|new constitution]], Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] to investigate past [[Human rights in South Africa|human rights]] abuses. Economically, Mandela's administration retained its predecessor's [[economic liberalism|liberal framework]] despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage [[land reform]], [[poverty reduction|combat poverty]], and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as mediator in the [[Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial]] and served as Secretary-General of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term, and in 1999 was succeeded by his deputy, [[Thabo Mbeki]]. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and [[HIV/AIDS]] through the charitable [[Nelson Mandela Foundation]].\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nMandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. Although critics on the [[Right-wing politics|right]] denounced him as a [[Communist terrorism|communist terrorist]] and those on the [[Far-left politics|far-left]] deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid's supporters, he gained international acclaim for his activism. Widely regarded as an icon of democracy and [[social justice]], he received [[List of Nelson Mandela awards and honours|more than 250 honours]]\u2014including the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\u2014and became the subject of a [[cult of personality]].

At the same time he rejected other aspects of their thought, such as the anti-white sentiment of many African nationalists.{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|p=109}} In doing so he synthesised both counter-cultural and hegemonic views, for instance by drawing upon ideas from the then-dominant [[Afrikaner nationalism]] in promoting his anti-apartheid vision.{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|p=102}}\n\nHis political development was strongly influenced by his legal training and practice, in particular his hope to achieve change not through violence but through \"legal revolution\".{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=viii}} Over the course of his life, he began by advocating a path of non-violence, later embracing violence, and then adopting a non-violent approach to negotiation and reconciliation.{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|p=107}} When endorsing violence, he did so because he saw no alternative, and was always pragmatic about it, perceiving it as a means to get his opponent to the negotiating table.{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|pp=105, 108}} He sought to target symbols of white supremacy and racist oppression rather than white people as individuals, and was anxious not to inaugurate a race war in South Africa.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=914}} This willingness to use violence distinguishes Mandela from the ideology of [[Gandhism]], with which some commentators have sought to associate him.{{sfn|Suttner|2007|pp=119\u2013120}}\n\n===Democracy===\n\nAlthough he presented himself in an autocratic manner in several speeches, Mandela was a devout believer in democracy and abided by majority decisions even when deeply disagreeing with them.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=433}} He had exhibited a commitment to the values of democracy and human rights since at least the 1960s.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|pp=906\u2013907}} He held a conviction that \"inclusivity, accountability and freedom of speech\" were the fundamentals of democracy,{{sfn|Battersby|2011|p=605}} and was driven by a belief in [[natural and legal rights|natural]] and human rights.{{sfn|Kalumba|1995|p=162}} Suttner argued that there were \"two modes of leadership\" that Mandela adopted. On one side he adhered to ideas about collective leadership, although on the other believed that there were scenarios in which a leader had to be decisive and act without consultation to achieve a particular objective.{{sfn|Suttner|2007|pp=113\u2013114}}\n\nAccording to Lodge, Mandela's political thought reflected tensions between his support for [[liberal democracy]] and pre-colonial African forms of consensus decision making.{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=xi}} He was an admirer of British-style [[parliamentary democracy]],{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=907}} stating that \"I regard the British Parliament as the most democratic institution in the world, and the independence and impartiality of its judiciary never fail to arouse my admiration.\"{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=907}} In this he has been described as being committed to \"the Euro-North American modernist project of emancipation\", something which distinguishes him from other African nationalist and socialist leaders like Nyerere who were concerned about embracing styles of democratic governance that were Western, rather than African, in origin.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=907}} Mandela nevertheless also expressed admiration for what he deemed to be indigenous forms of democracy, describing Xhosa traditional society's mode of governance as \"democracy in its purest form\".{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=907}} He also spoke of an influential African ethical tenet, [[Ubuntu (philosophy)|Ubuntu]], which is a [[Nguni languages|Ngnuni term]] meaning \"A person is a person through other persons\" or \"I am because we are.\"{{sfn|Oppenheim|2012|pp=369\u2013370}}\n\n===Socialism and Marxism===\n\n[[File:1988 CPA 5971.jpg|thumb|upright|1988 Soviet commemorative stamp, captioned \"The fighter for freedom of South Africa Nelson Mandela\" in Russian]]\n\nMandela advocated the ultimate establishment of a classless society,{{sfnm|1a1=Benson|1y=1986|1pp=231, 232|2a1=Ellis|2y=2016|2p=7}} with Sampson describing him as being \"openly opposed to capitalism, private land-ownership and the power of big money\".{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=298}} Mandela was influenced by [[Marxism]], and during the revolution he advocated [[scientific socialism]].{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=282}} He denied being a communist at the Treason Trial,{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1p=365|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2pp=135\u2013138}} and maintained this stance both when later talking to journalists,{{sfn|Benson|1986|p=232}} and in his autobiography.{{sfn|Ellis|2016|p=18}} According to the sociologist Craig Soudien, \"sympathetic as Mandela was to socialism, a communist he was not.\"{{sfn|Soudien|2015|p=361}} Conversely, the biographer David Jones Smith stated that Mandela \"embraced communism and communists\" in the late 1950s and early 1960s,{{sfn|Smith|2010|pp=217\u2013218}} while the historian Stephen Ellis commented that Mandela had assimilated much of the [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] ideology by 1960.{{sfn|Ellis|2016|p=7}}\n\nEllis also found evidence that Mandela had been an active member of the South African Communist Party during the late 1950s and early 1960s,{{sfn|Ellis|2011|pp=667\u2013668}} something that was confirmed after his death by both the ANC and the SACP, the latter of which claimed that he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee.<ref name=\"Mandela'sCommunism\"/> His membership had been hidden by the ANC, aware that knowledge of Mandela's former SACP involvement might have been detrimental to his attempts to attract support from Western countries.{{sfn|Ellis|2016|p=17}} Mandela's view of these Western governments differed from those of Marxist\u2013Leninists, for he did not believe that they were anti-democratic or reactionary and remained committed to democratic systems of governance.{{sfn|Smith|2010|p=231}}\n\nThe 1955 Freedom Charter, which Mandela had helped create, called for the nationalisation of banks, gold mines and land, to ensure equal distribution of wealth.{{sfn|Kalumba|1995|pp=164\u2013165}} Despite these beliefs, Mandela initiated a programme of privatisation during his presidency in line with trends in other countries of the time.{{sfn|Freund|2014|p=294}} It has been repeatedly suggested that Mandela would have preferred to develop a [[social democracy|social democratic]] economy in South Africa but that this was not feasible as a result of the international political and economic situation during the early 1990s.{{sfn|Freund|2014|p=294}} This decision was in part influenced by the fall of the [[socialist states]] in the Soviet Union and [[Eastern Bloc]] during the early 1990s.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|pp=433\u2013435}}\n\n==Personality and personal life==\n[[File:Nelson Mandela (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Mandela on a visit to Australia in 2009;

He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a [[Universal suffrage|fully representative]] democratic election. [[Presidency of Nelson Mandela|His government]] focused on dismantling the legacy of [[apartheid]] by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial [[Conflict resolution|reconciliation]]. Ideologically an [[African nationalism|African nationalist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]], he served as the president of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.\n\n<!--Early life and revolutionary activity-->\nA [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]], Mandela was born to the [[Thembu]] royal family in [[Mvezo]], [[Union of South Africa]]. He studied law at the [[University of Fort Hare]] and the [[University of Witwatersrand]] before working as a lawyer in [[Johannesburg]]. There he became involved in [[anti-colonial]] and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its [[African National Congress Youth League|Youth League]] in 1944. After the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]]'s [[Dominant minority|white-only government]] established apartheid, a system of [[racial segregation]] that privileged [[White South African|whites]], he and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow. Mandela was appointed President of the ANC's [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 [[Defiance Campaign]] and the 1955 [[Congress of the People (1955)|Congress of the People]]. He was repeatedly arrested for [[seditious]] activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the [[1956 Treason Trial]]. Influenced by [[Marxism]], he secretly joined the banned [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] in 1961 and led a [[sabotage]] campaign against the government. He was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state following the [[Rivonia Trial]].\n\n<!--Imprisonment and Mandela's government-->\nMandela served 27 years in prison, split between [[Robben Island]], [[Pollsmoor Prison]], and [[Victor Verster Prison]]. Amid growing domestic and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war, President [[F. W. de Klerk]] released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the [[1994 South African general election|1994 multiracial general election]] in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became president. Leading a [[Government of National Unity (South Africa)|broad coalition government]] which promulgated a [[Constitution of South Africa|new constitution]], Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] to investigate past [[Human rights in South Africa|human rights]] abuses. Economically, Mandela's administration retained its predecessor's [[economic liberalism|liberal framework]] despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage [[land reform]], [[poverty reduction|combat poverty]], and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as mediator in the [[Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial]] and served as Secretary-General of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term, and in 1999 was succeeded by his deputy, [[Thabo Mbeki]]. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and [[HIV/AIDS]] through the charitable [[Nelson Mandela Foundation]].\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nMandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. Although critics on the [[Right-wing politics|right]] denounced him as a [[Communist terrorism|communist terrorist]] and those on the [[Far-left politics|far-left]] deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid's supporters, he gained international acclaim for his activism. Widely regarded as an icon of democracy and [[social justice]], he received [[List of Nelson Mandela awards and honours|more than 250 honours]]\u2014including the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\u2014and became the subject of a [[cult of personality]]. He is held in deep respect within South Africa, where he is often referred to by his [[Xhosa clan names|Xhosa clan name]], '''Madiba''', and described as the \"[[Father of the Nation]]\".\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood: 1918\u20131934===\nMandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in [[Umtata]], then part of South Africa's [[Cape Province]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1p=3|2a1=Boehmer|2y=2008|2p=21|3a1=Smith|3y=2010|3p=17|4a1=Sampson|4y=2011|4p=3}} Given the forename Rolihlahla,<ref>Mandela used the spelling Rolihlahla, see for example [http://www.mandela.gov.za/ official website].

At the same time he rejected other aspects of their thought, such as the anti-white sentiment of many African nationalists.{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|p=109}} In doing so he synthesised both counter-cultural and hegemonic views, for instance by drawing upon ideas from the then-dominant [[Afrikaner nationalism]] in promoting his anti-apartheid vision.{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|p=102}}\n\nHis political development was strongly influenced by his legal training and practice, in particular his hope to achieve change not through violence but through \"legal revolution\".{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=viii}} Over the course of his life, he began by advocating a path of non-violence, later embracing violence, and then adopting a non-violent approach to negotiation and reconciliation.{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|p=107}} When endorsing violence, he did so because he saw no alternative, and was always pragmatic about it, perceiving it as a means to get his opponent to the negotiating table.{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|pp=105, 108}} He sought to target symbols of white supremacy and racist oppression rather than white people as individuals, and was anxious not to inaugurate a race war in South Africa.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=914}} This willingness to use violence distinguishes Mandela from the ideology of [[Gandhism]], with which some commentators have sought to associate him.{{sfn|Suttner|2007|pp=119\u2013120}}\n\n===Democracy===\n\nAlthough he presented himself in an autocratic manner in several speeches, Mandela was a devout believer in democracy and abided by majority decisions even when deeply disagreeing with them.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=433}} He had exhibited a commitment to the values of democracy and human rights since at least the 1960s.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|pp=906\u2013907}} He held a conviction that \"inclusivity, accountability and freedom of speech\" were the fundamentals of democracy,{{sfn|Battersby|2011|p=605}} and was driven by a belief in [[natural and legal rights|natural]] and human rights.{{sfn|Kalumba|1995|p=162}} Suttner argued that there were \"two modes of leadership\" that Mandela adopted. On one side he adhered to ideas about collective leadership, although on the other believed that there were scenarios in which a leader had to be decisive and act without consultation to achieve a particular objective.{{sfn|Suttner|2007|pp=113\u2013114}}\n\nAccording to Lodge, Mandela's political thought reflected tensions between his support for [[liberal democracy]] and pre-colonial African forms of consensus decision making.{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=xi}} He was an admirer of British-style [[parliamentary democracy]],{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=907}} stating that \"I regard the British Parliament as the most democratic institution in the world, and the independence and impartiality of its judiciary never fail to arouse my admiration.\"{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=907}} In this he has been described as being committed to \"the Euro-North American modernist project of emancipation\", something which distinguishes him from other African nationalist and socialist leaders like Nyerere who were concerned about embracing styles of democratic governance that were Western, rather than African, in origin.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=907}} Mandela nevertheless also expressed admiration for what he deemed to be indigenous forms of democracy, describing Xhosa traditional society's mode of governance as \"democracy in its purest form\".{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=907}} He also spoke of an influential African ethical tenet, [[Ubuntu (philosophy)|Ubuntu]], which is a [[Nguni languages|Ngnuni term]] meaning \"A person is a person through other persons\" or \"I am because we are.\"{{sfn|Oppenheim|2012|pp=369\u2013370}}\n\n===Socialism and Marxism===\n\n[[File:1988 CPA 5971.jpg|thumb|upright|1988 Soviet commemorative stamp, captioned \"The fighter for freedom of South Africa Nelson Mandela\" in Russian]]\n\nMandela advocated the ultimate establishment of a classless society,{{sfnm|1a1=Benson|1y=1986|1pp=231, 232|2a1=Ellis|2y=2016|2p=7}} with Sampson describing him as being \"openly opposed to capitalism, private land-ownership and the power of big money\".{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=298}} Mandela was influenced by [[Marxism]], and during the revolution he advocated [[scientific socialism]].{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=282}} He denied being a communist at the Treason Trial,{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1p=365|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2pp=135\u2013138}} and maintained this stance both when later talking to journalists,{{sfn|Benson|1986|p=232}} and in his autobiography.{{sfn|Ellis|2016|p=18}} According to the sociologist Craig Soudien, \"sympathetic as Mandela was to socialism, a communist he was not.\"{{sfn|Soudien|2015|p=361}} Conversely, the biographer David Jones Smith stated that Mandela \"embraced communism and communists\" in the late 1950s and early 1960s,{{sfn|Smith|2010|pp=217\u2013218}} while the historian Stephen Ellis commented that Mandela had assimilated much of the [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] ideology by 1960.{{sfn|Ellis|2016|p=7}}\n\nEllis also found evidence that Mandela had been an active member of the South African Communist Party during the late 1950s and early 1960s,{{sfn|Ellis|2011|pp=667\u2013668}} something that was confirmed after his death by both the ANC and the SACP, the latter of which claimed that he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee.<ref name=\"Mandela'sCommunism\"/> His membership had been hidden by the ANC, aware that knowledge of Mandela's former SACP involvement might have been detrimental to his attempts to attract support from Western countries.{{sfn|Ellis|2016|p=17}} Mandela's view of these Western governments differed from those of Marxist\u2013Leninists, for he did not believe that they were anti-democratic or reactionary and remained committed to democratic systems of governance.{{sfn|Smith|2010|p=231}}\n\nThe 1955 Freedom Charter, which Mandela had helped create, called for the nationalisation of banks, gold mines and land, to ensure equal distribution of wealth.{{sfn|Kalumba|1995|pp=164\u2013165}} Despite these beliefs, Mandela initiated a programme of privatisation during his presidency in line with trends in other countries of the time.{{sfn|Freund|2014|p=294}} It has been repeatedly suggested that Mandela would have preferred to develop a [[social democracy|social democratic]] economy in South Africa but that this was not feasible as a result of the international political and economic situation during the early 1990s.{{sfn|Freund|2014|p=294}} This decision was in part influenced by the fall of the [[socialist states]] in the Soviet Union and [[Eastern Bloc]] during the early 1990s.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|pp=433\u2013435}}\n\n==Personality and personal life==\n[[File:Nelson Mandela (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Mandela on a visit to Australia in 2009;

During this period of his life he was going to the theatre and to concerts in Liverpool and was also taking London University external examinations at University College Liverpool (now the University of Liverpool). In 1898 he passed Intermediate Science and applied to become a Naval Instructor.<ref>Christie Papers RG07/138, Tuck to Christie, 13 June 1894; Tuck Papers 1/1, 1898 diary; ''University of London General Register'' Part III (1901), p.623.</ref> In June 1899 he received an appointment as a Naval Instructor, and was sent to East Asia.

In August Vice-Admiral Sir [[Gerard Noel (Royal Navy officer)|Gerard Noel]], Commander-in-Chief of the China Station, wrote to Sir [[Claude Maxwell MacDonald]], the first British ambassador to Japan, seeking the services of a \u2018suitable and reliable Instructor in the Japanese language for service with the British China Squadron\u2019, possibly a \u2018suitable retired Japanese Naval Officer, who has perhaps been wounded in the war and would be glad of a little financial assistance\u2019. In February 1905, Macdonald replied to Noel to say that Baron [[Komura Jutar\u014d]], the Minister of Foreign Affairs, had been unable to find a suitable person.<ref>The National Archives, ADM 1/7728: Admiralty Circular Letter (printed) of 10 June 1904 (7200/1904); Noel to MacDonald, 5 August 1904; MacDonald to Noel, 11 February 1905.</ref> By this time Tuck was living in Japan and studying the language full-time, although he was finding the expenses involved much greater than he had expected.<ref>The National Archives, ADM 1/7728: Tuck to Captain Stoppard, 18 January 1905; Gubbins to MacDonald, 10 January 1904 [sic: 1905].</ref> Later in 1905 Sir Claude  MacDonald instructed [[John Harington Gubbins]], who had been Japanese Secretary in the British Legation for many years and had a good command of Japanese, to examine Tuck on his knowledge of Japanese. Gubbins reported in September that Tuck had gained full marks in colloquial and more than 75% for each of the two written papers, and that he had a good knowledge of Chinese characters. \u2018A little further study of newspapers, and a course of instruction in what is known as official dispatch style, would, I think, enable Mr. Tuck to attain the standard required for interpreters in the Japan Consular Service', he concluded. In December Tuck received a certificate stating that he had passed the examination for Interpreter in Japanese and a few days later received appointment as Interpreter in Japanese on HMS King Alfred.<ref>Tuck Papers 2/5.</ref> In February 1906 Vice-Admiral Noel wrote to Tuck and forwarded to him extracts from an Admiralty letter dated 25 October 1905, which stated that \u2018it would be a convenience if the services of Mr. Oswald Tuck could be utilized in connection with the instruction in the Japanese language of Naval Officers on the China Station, having regard to his special qualifications for such work\u2019. And in 1907 the Admiralty wrote to express their appreciation for Tuck's translation of a diary by a Russian officer serving  on the Russian battleship [[Oryol]].<ref>Tuck Papers 2/5.</ref> It was clear that Tuck's command of Japanese was now appreciated by the Admiralty.\n\nIn 1908 he was appointed as assistant to the British Naval Attach\u00e9, Captain Dundas, in Tokyo. On 13 January he received a letter from Captain (Later Admiral Sir) [[Herbert King-Hall]], Assistant Director of the Naval Intelligence Division in the Admiralty, suggesting that he return to England for permanent employment in the Naval Intelligence Division.<ref>Tuck Papers 1/7, 1908 diary.</ref> This indicates that Tuck was already well thought of in the Navy, and at the end of the year he decided to accept the appointment offered to him, and left Japan for the last time in his life.\n\n==Return to England==\nHe returned to England in 1909 and was attached to the Naval Ordnance Department of the Admiralty while nominally assigned to [[HMS President (shore establishment)|HMS President]].<ref>''Navy List, March 1910, p. 359.</ref> He was eventually promoted to Instructor Commander, with seniority dating from 1913. During the Great War his appointment was described as, 'for duty with the Naval Staff, lent to the Historical Section of the War Cabinet'.<ref>''Navy List'', December 1918, p. 873.</ref> By 1921 he was Head of the Historical Section in the Training and Staff Duties Division of the Admiralty.<ref>Navy List, October 1921, p. 1816; April 1923, pp. 1815-6.</ref> He remained an Instructor Commander until he retired in 1924, when he was given the rank of Instructor Captain: he was the only one without a university degree.<ref>''Navy List'', July 1936, p. 646.</ref> He continued to work on the volumes of the official naval history of the Great War until 1937, in the capacity of Technical Assistant in the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence.<ref>''Navy List'', July 1935, p. 560.</ref> On the strength of his work as a historian, in 1934 he applied to the [[University of Cambridge]] when the position of [[Vere Harmsworth Professor of Imperial and Naval History]] fell vacant, but it was in the end offered to one of his referees, Admiral Sir [[Herbert Richmond]] (1871-1946).<ref>Tuck Papers 2/5, Tuck\u2019s correspondence with Admiral Richmond.</ref>\n\n==Japanese studies and life in Japan==\nTuck first visited Japan in November 1900 and was immediately enthusiastic. He  wrote to his future wife:\n'I take back every word I have said against the Japanese; they are the most delightful people on the face of the earth. It is a perfect joy to go into a shop for the mere object of talking to the owner. Everyone has the most engaging way with them \u2013 ad all merely for politeness, not for the sake of what they can get out of you.'<ref>Tuck Papers 2/1, Tuck to Florrie, Nagasaki, 27 November 1900.</ref> He started 'struggling with Japanese' right away and by February of the following year he was already confident enough to write, 'I can now talk well enough to go about the country alone and I shall certainly do so when we get there; being able to eat the food of the country renders me quite independent.'.<ref>Tuck Papers 2/1, letters to Florrie of 29 December 1900 and 8 February 1901.</ref>\n\nIn 1902, when HMS Goliath was stationed in Hong Kong, he continued to extend his knowledge of Japan by reading [[Lafcadio Hearn]]'s ''Glimpses of unfamiliar Japan'' (1894) and ''The Mikado's Empire'' by [[William Elliot Griffis]] (1876). He was also practicing his Japanese with a young man named Tajima, and asked the Japanese consul to help find him a teacher. In May HMS Goliath put in to [[Yokohama]] and Tuck received the Admiral's permission to rejoin the ship at Nagasaki after travelling by train and boat to [[Beppu]] in [[Kyushu]] and then walking from there to Nagasaki. In the event he had to retrace his steps and rejoin the ship at Miyajima.<ref>Tuck Papers 1/2, diary for 1902.</ref> By October, after a spell at [[Weihaiwei]], the Goliath returned to Yokoyama and Tuck applied for leave to remain in Japan for four months to learn Japanese. He was permitted to bring on board a young Japanese man as a servant, Kond\u014d Takez\u014d: with Kond\u014d he began learning Chinese characters. The Admiral rejected his application, saying that his job was to instruct midshipmen.<ref>Tuck Papers 1/2, diary for 1902.</ref> He reapplied, and forwarded to the Admiral with a letter from H. Kirino, the acting Japanese consul in Hong Kong, saying, \u2018I do hereby certify that Mr. Oswald T. Tuck RN of HMS Goliath can now speak Japanese tolerably well and after one year\u2019s exclusive study there is no doubt of the possibility of his expert talking of the same.\u2019 <ref>Tuck Papers 1/2, 1903 diary.</ref>\n\nIn 1908, when he was living in Japan as assistant to the British Naval Attach\u00e9, Captain Dundas, he began translating the confidential Japanese history of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] into English. He also spent a lot of time with Kikutake Jitsuz\u014d (1889-1946), a young student. Kikutake later graduated with a degree in Mongolian from Tokyo University of Foreign Studies and then worked on the South Manchurian Railway in Manchukuo, the Japanese puppet state in north China.<ref>https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/innerasianstudies/25/0/25_KJ00009391607/_pdf</ref>\n\n==Japanese translation and historical work==\nAfter his return to England in 1909, he continued with his translation of the confidential Japanese history of the Russo-Japanese War and became assistant to the naval historian Sir [[Julian Corbett]], who used his translation to write ''Maritime Operations in the Russo-Japanese War 1904\u20135''. In the preface Corbett wrote: 'In everything that concerns the fleet a fresh examination of all the available authorities has been made. Foremost among them is the minute and exhaustive history prepared by the Japanese Naval Staff, which, though strictly confidential, has been courteously placed at the disposal of the Admiralty by the Japanese Government for the use of naval officers only. A translation, made by Naval Instructor Oswald T. Tuck, R. N., by direction of the Naval Intelligence Division, exists at the Admiralty and it is this work which is cited as the ''Japanese Confidential History'''.<ref>Corbett 1914, Preface p. 2</ref>\n\nUp to 1937 he continued to translate and write historical monographs for the Navy, though none of these were published. According to Major E. Y. Daniel of the [[Royal Marine Light Infantry]], who was assistant to Sir Julian Corbett and wrote a reference for Tuck in 1923, Tuck also wrote extensively of the Japanese role in the Great War.<ref>Jarvis 2005, p. 201. The source cited by Tuck is the original letter which at the time of writing was evidently still in the possession of Tuck's daughter, Sylvia Crotty; this letter is, however, not among the extant Tuck Papers. The historical monographs are presumably still in the possession of the Naval Historical Branch at HM Naval Base Portsmouth.</ref> He also played an active part in the [[The Japan Society of the UK|Japan Society]], which he joined as a life member in 1909: he served on the Council and gave lectures on a variety of subjects in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>Jarvis 2005</ref>\n\n==Censorship==\nIn September 1939 Tuck came out of retirement and was appointed Assistant Press Censor in Japanese at the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]], serving under [[Arthur Waley]], the scholar and translator of Chinese and Japanese. Tuck's knowledge of Japanese was put to use checking the dispatches that Japanese journalists based in London were sending back to Japan. In December 1941, after the outbreak of the Pacific War, Japanese journalists and other Japanese citizens in Britain were interned on the [[Isle of Man]], so there was no further need for his services as a censor. The head of Press Censorship therefore offered Tuck's services to the Admiralty on 16 December and on 22 December Tuck had an interview with Colonel [[John Tiltman]], who had decided to experiment with 6-month courses in Japanese to meet wartime needs for cryptanalysts at [[Bletchley Park]]. On 2 January 1942 Tuck met Commander [[Alastair Denniston]], the head of [[Government Code and Cypher School]] at Bletchley Park, and he visited Bletchley on 13 January.<ref>Tuck papers 2/5, typed notes by Tuck\u2019s daughter, Sylvia Crotty; Tiltman, p. 5.</ref>\n\n==Bedford Japanese School==\nColonel Tiltman states that he had been advised to recruit students with scholarships to study the Classics at Oxford and Cambridge, and for this purpose he approached Dr [[Alexander Dunlop Lindsay, 1st Baron Lindsay of Birker|Alexander Lindsay]], the Master of Balliol College, Oxford, and Mr [[Martin Charlesworth]], the President of St John's College, Cambridge.<ref>Tiltman, p. 9.</ref> In fact, whereas most students studying scientific subjects or modern languages had already been called up for special war service, nobody had yet thought of a use for classicists, so Tiltman could take his pick of the best.<ref>Tuck, ''Bedford Japanese School'', p. 20.</ref> The candidates were interviewed in January 1942 and the first class assembled in the Inter-Services Special Intelligence School at [[Bedford]] on 2 February. The few available dictionaries and textbooks all belonged to Tuck himself, and the course was devised by him in order to convey the essentials of the formal military Japanese that the students would later be handling. The course ended on 27 June after a little less than five months, but the results had been beyond all expectations and it was decided to recruit for a second course.<ref>Tuck, ''Bedford Japanese School'', from which all details in this section are taken.</ref> After finishing the course the 22 men and one woman were sent to the Naval Section at Bletchley Park, to the Military Wing at Bletchley Park, to the Air Section at Bletchley Park or to the Foreign Office intelligence unit in Berkeley Street, London. Some of them were later sent out to [[Colombo]], [[New Delhi]] or [[Mauritius]], where they worked as translators and/or cryptanalysts at wireless intercept stations.\n\nThe second course began in August 1942 and from this point on Tuck was assisted by some of his most able students from the first course, particularly [[Eric Bertrand Ceadel|Eric Ceadel]], who in 1947 became the first lecturer in Japanese at [[Cambridge University]]. The succession of courses ended with the eleventh course, which began on 5 May 1945 and ended on 10 November. By that time the war was over, so the projected courses 12 and 13 were cancelled. Tuck was asked to write a history of the Bedford Japanese School, and on 7 December 1945 [[Frank Birch]], the Deputy Director of the Government Code & Cypher School, \nwrote to acknowledge receipt of Tuck's account: \u2018What you haven\u2019t said in your history (but, thank goodness, it sticks out a mile) is your tremendous triumph over wrongheaded experts, red tape, neglect and almost impossible conditions. The tremendous value of your contribution and its great significance in the total British effort in the Japanese war \u2013 that, I hope, will be recognised in the G.C.C.S. histories (it certainly will in the Naval history) now being written.\u2019<ref>Tuck Papers 2/9, letter from Birch to Tuck.</ref>\n\nIn all more than 220 students were trained at the Bedford Japanese School, including nine women. After the war some returned to their former pursuits, such as [[Hugh Lloyd-Jones]], who became Regius Professor of Greek at Oxford and was knighted, and [[Maurice Wiles]], who became Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford. Others abandoned their former interests and became sinologists or japanologists, such as [[David Hawkes (sinologist)|David Hawkes]], later Professor of Chinese at Oxford, Geoffrey Bownas, later Professor of Japanese at Sheffield University, and Albert Richard Davis, who became Professor of Chinese at Sydney University. Some became famous for other reasons, such as [[Denise Newman]], who served as the only female skipper in the Royal Navy Auxiliary Service for eight years, and sailed single-handed across the Atlantic in 1988 at the age of 64, and [[Wilfrid Noyce]], who was a member of the 1953 British Everest Expedition and later died in a mountaineering accident in the Pamirs.<ref>For biographies of all the students see Kornicki 2019.</ref>\n\n==Final years==\nIn 1946 Tuck was asked to take charge of a group of men who were required to translate captured Japanese materials at the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich|Royal Naval College]], Greenwich, and this lasted from 6 March to 22 November. Some had been students at Bedford Japanese School, while others had learnt Japanese in the Naval Section at Bletchley Park. During the year several of his former students from Bedford came to visit him, and in May he visited both Oxford and Cambridge where his former students, now back at university, were his hosts at commemorative dinners.<ref>'[Diary of the] Japanese Translation party', Tuck Papers 1/11; Kornicki 2019, pp. xix-xx.</ref> Like others who worked at Bletchley Park during the war, Tuck received no honours or recognition after the war. He was, however, warmly appreciated by his former pupils: Eric Ceadel continued to write to him from Cambridge, and David Goldberg, one of the many Jews at Bedford and Bletchley Park wrote, \u2018I should like you to accept the little book enclosed herewith as a token of my thanks to you for the past six months so pleasantly spent in Bedford, and especially for helping me to keep our Jewish religious observances throughout the period.\u2019 <ref>Tuck Papers 1/10, 1/11, 2/9. See also Martin Sugarman, \u2018Breaking the codes: Jewish personnel at Bletchley Park\u2019, ''Jewish historical studies'' 40 (2005): 197-246.</ref> A year after Tuck's death Ceadel, in a lecture at the Japan Society, wrote movingly of his memories of Tuck:\n\n'The late Captain Oswald T. Tuck RN, who died early last year, meant much to me, for it was he who instructed me in Japanese. Over 200 of his wartime students will always treasure a clear memory of his erect and dignified figure, with white hair and beard, and of his fine qualities of mind and character. In a quiet but effective manner he drew the interest of his students, and succeeded in imparting to them not only the basis of the Japanese language, but also an understanding and appreciation of many faces of Japanese literature, art and life.'<ref>Ceadel 1951.</ref>\n\n==Family==\nOn 25 July 1912 Tuck married Florence Jane Peglar (1873-1956): in his letters he referred to her as Florrie and then, after they were married, as Peggy. They had two children, Eleanor Margery (1913-1984, married surname Vincent-Townsend) and\nSylvia Catherine (1920-2006, married surname Crotty).<ref>Tuck's letters in the Tuck Papers; family tree on ancestry.co.uk</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n 'Some Comic Medieval Plays of Japan', ''Transactions and Proceedings of the Japan Society'', vol.XXI (28 Nov.1923).\n 'A Post-war Japanese Play',''Transactions and Proceedings of the Japan Society'', vol.XXIII (29 April 1926.\n 'Jitsuzo - a study of a student', ''Transactions and Proceedings of the Japan Society'', vol.XXVIII (1931).\n 'Kyogen: the Comic Drama of Japan', ''Transactions and Proceedings of the Japan Society'', vol.

And in 1907 the Admiralty wrote to express their appreciation for Tuck's translation of a diary by a Russian officer serving  on the Russian battleship [[Oryol]].<ref>Tuck Papers 2/5.</ref> It was clear that Tuck's command of Japanese was now appreciated by the Admiralty.\n\nIn 1908 he was appointed as assistant to the British Naval Attach\u00e9, Captain Dundas, in Tokyo. On 13 January he received a letter from Captain (Later Admiral Sir) [[Herbert King-Hall]], Assistant Director of the Naval Intelligence Division in the Admiralty, suggesting that he return to England for permanent employment in the Naval Intelligence Division.<ref>Tuck Papers 1/7, 1908 diary.</ref> This indicates that Tuck was already well thought of in the Navy, and at the end of the year he decided to accept the appointment offered to him, and left Japan for the last time in his life.\n\n==Return to England==\nHe returned to England in 1909 and was attached to the Naval Ordnance Department of the Admiralty while nominally assigned to [[HMS President (shore establishment)|HMS President]].<ref>''Navy List, March 1910, p. 359.</ref> He was eventually promoted to Instructor Commander, with seniority dating from 1913. During the Great War his appointment was described as, 'for duty with the Naval Staff, lent to the Historical Section of the War Cabinet'.<ref>''Navy List'', December 1918, p. 873.</ref> By 1921 he was Head of the Historical Section in the Training and Staff Duties Division of the Admiralty.<ref>Navy List, October 1921, p. 1816; April 1923, pp. 1815-6.</ref> He remained an Instructor Commander until he retired in 1924, when he was given the rank of Instructor Captain: he was the only one without a university degree.<ref>''Navy List'', July 1936, p. 646.</ref> He continued to work on the volumes of the official naval history of the Great War until 1937, in the capacity of Technical Assistant in the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence.<ref>''Navy List'', July 1935, p. 560.</ref> On the strength of his work as a historian, in 1934 he applied to the [[University of Cambridge]] when the position of [[Vere Harmsworth Professor of Imperial and Naval History]] fell vacant, but it was in the end offered to one of his referees, Admiral Sir [[Herbert Richmond]] (1871-1946).<ref>Tuck Papers 2/5, Tuck\u2019s correspondence with Admiral Richmond.</ref>\n\n==Japanese studies and life in Japan==\nTuck first visited Japan in November 1900 and was immediately enthusiastic. He  wrote to his future wife:\n'I take back every word I have said against the Japanese; they are the most delightful people on the face of the earth. It is a perfect joy to go into a shop for the mere object of talking to the owner. Everyone has the most engaging way with them \u2013 ad all merely for politeness, not for the sake of what they can get out of you.'<ref>Tuck Papers 2/1, Tuck to Florrie, Nagasaki, 27 November 1900.</ref> He started 'struggling with Japanese' right away and by February of the following year he was already confident enough to write, 'I can now talk well enough to go about the country alone and I shall certainly do so when we get there; being able to eat the food of the country renders me quite independent.'.<ref>Tuck Papers 2/1, letters to Florrie of 29 December 1900 and 8 February 1901.</ref>\n\nIn 1902, when HMS Goliath was stationed in Hong Kong, he continued to extend his knowledge of Japan by reading [[Lafcadio Hearn]]'s ''Glimpses of unfamiliar Japan'' (1894) and ''The Mikado's Empire'' by [[William Elliot Griffis]] (1876). He was also practicing his Japanese with a young man named Tajima, and asked the Japanese consul to help find him a teacher. In May HMS Goliath put in to [[Yokohama]] and Tuck received the Admiral's permission to rejoin the ship at Nagasaki after travelling by train and boat to [[Beppu]] in [[Kyushu]] and then walking from there to Nagasaki. In the event he had to retrace his steps and rejoin the ship at Miyajima.<ref>Tuck Papers 1/2, diary for 1902.</ref> By October, after a spell at [[Weihaiwei]], the Goliath returned to Yokoyama and Tuck applied for leave to remain in Japan for four months to learn Japanese. He was permitted to bring on board a young Japanese man as a servant, Kond\u014d Takez\u014d: with Kond\u014d he began learning Chinese characters. The Admiral rejected his application, saying that his job was to instruct midshipmen.<ref>Tuck Papers 1/2, diary for 1902.</ref> He reapplied, and forwarded to the Admiral with a letter from H. Kirino, the acting Japanese consul in Hong Kong, saying, \u2018I do hereby certify that Mr. Oswald T. Tuck RN of HMS Goliath can now speak Japanese tolerably well and after one year\u2019s exclusive study there is no doubt of the possibility of his expert talking of the same.\u2019 <ref>Tuck Papers 1/2, 1903 diary.</ref>\n\nIn 1908, when he was living in Japan as assistant to the British Naval Attach\u00e9, Captain Dundas, he began translating the confidential Japanese history of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] into English. He also spent a lot of time with Kikutake Jitsuz\u014d (1889-1946), a young student. Kikutake later graduated with a degree in Mongolian from Tokyo University of Foreign Studies and then worked on the South Manchurian Railway in Manchukuo, the Japanese puppet state in north China.<ref>https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/innerasianstudies/25/0/25_KJ00009391607/_pdf</ref>\n\n==Japanese translation and historical work==\nAfter his return to England in 1909, he continued with his translation of the confidential Japanese history of the Russo-Japanese War and became assistant to the naval historian Sir [[Julian Corbett]], who used his translation to write ''Maritime Operations in the Russo-Japanese War 1904\u20135''. In the preface Corbett wrote: 'In everything that concerns the fleet a fresh examination of all the available authorities has been made. Foremost among them is the minute and exhaustive history prepared by the Japanese Naval Staff, which, though strictly confidential, has been courteously placed at the disposal of the Admiralty by the Japanese Government for the use of naval officers only. A translation, made by Naval Instructor Oswald T. Tuck, R. N., by direction of the Naval Intelligence Division, exists at the Admiralty and it is this work which is cited as the ''Japanese Confidential History'''.<ref>Corbett 1914, Preface p. 2</ref>\n\nUp to 1937 he continued to translate and write historical monographs for the Navy, though none of these were published. According to Major E. Y. Daniel of the [[Royal Marine Light Infantry]], who was assistant to Sir Julian Corbett and wrote a reference for Tuck in 1923, Tuck also wrote extensively of the Japanese role in the Great War.<ref>Jarvis 2005, p. 201. The source cited by Tuck is the original letter which at the time of writing was evidently still in the possession of Tuck's daughter, Sylvia Crotty; this letter is, however, not among the extant Tuck Papers. The historical monographs are presumably still in the possession of the Naval Historical Branch at HM Naval Base Portsmouth.</ref> He also played an active part in the [[The Japan Society of the UK|Japan Society]], which he joined as a life member in 1909: he served on the Council and gave lectures on a variety of subjects in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>Jarvis 2005</ref>\n\n==Censorship==\nIn September 1939 Tuck came out of retirement and was appointed Assistant Press Censor in Japanese at the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]], serving under [[Arthur Waley]], the scholar and translator of Chinese and Japanese. Tuck's knowledge of Japanese was put to use checking the dispatches that Japanese journalists based in London were sending back to Japan. In December 1941, after the outbreak of the Pacific War, Japanese journalists and other Japanese citizens in Britain were interned on the [[Isle of Man]], so there was no further need for his services as a censor. The head of Press Censorship therefore offered Tuck's services to the Admiralty on 16 December and on 22 December Tuck had an interview with Colonel [[John Tiltman]], who had decided to experiment with 6-month courses in Japanese to meet wartime needs for cryptanalysts at [[Bletchley Park]]. On 2 January 1942 Tuck met Commander [[Alastair Denniston]], the head of [[Government Code and Cypher School]] at Bletchley Park, and he visited Bletchley on 13 January.<ref>Tuck papers 2/5, typed notes by Tuck\u2019s daughter, Sylvia Crotty; Tiltman, p. 5.</ref>\n\n==Bedford Japanese School==\nColonel Tiltman states that he had been advised to recruit students with scholarships to study the Classics at Oxford and Cambridge, and for this purpose he approached Dr [[Alexander Dunlop Lindsay, 1st Baron Lindsay of Birker|Alexander Lindsay]], the Master of Balliol College, Oxford, and Mr [[Martin Charlesworth]], the President of St John's College, Cambridge.<ref>Tiltman, p. 9.</ref> In fact, whereas most students studying scientific subjects or modern languages had already been called up for special war service, nobody had yet thought of a use for classicists, so Tiltman could take his pick of the best.<ref>Tuck, ''Bedford Japanese School'', p. 20.</ref> The candidates were interviewed in January 1942 and the first class assembled in the Inter-Services Special Intelligence School at [[Bedford]] on 2 February. The few available dictionaries and textbooks all belonged to Tuck himself, and the course was devised by him in order to convey the essentials of the formal military Japanese that the students would later be handling. The course ended on 27 June after a little less than five months, but the results had been beyond all expectations and it was decided to recruit for a second course.<ref>Tuck, ''Bedford Japanese School'', from which all details in this section are taken.</ref> After finishing the course the 22 men and one woman were sent to the Naval Section at Bletchley Park, to the Military Wing at Bletchley Park, to the Air Section at Bletchley Park or to the Foreign Office intelligence unit in Berkeley Street, London. Some of them were later sent out to [[Colombo]], [[New Delhi]] or [[Mauritius]], where they worked as translators and/or cryptanalysts at wireless intercept stations.\n\nThe second course began in August 1942 and from this point on Tuck was assisted by some of his most able students from the first course, particularly [[Eric Bertrand Ceadel|Eric Ceadel]], who in 1947 became the first lecturer in Japanese at [[Cambridge University]]. The succession of courses ended with the eleventh course, which began on 5 May 1945 and ended on 10 November. By that time the war was over, so the projected courses 12 and 13 were cancelled. Tuck was asked to write a history of the Bedford Japanese School, and on 7 December 1945 [[Frank Birch]], the Deputy Director of the Government Code & Cypher School, \nwrote to acknowledge receipt of Tuck's account: \u2018What you haven\u2019t said in your history (but, thank goodness, it sticks out a mile) is your tremendous triumph over wrongheaded experts, red tape, neglect and almost impossible conditions. The tremendous value of your contribution and its great significance in the total British effort in the Japanese war \u2013 that, I hope, will be recognised in the G.C.C.S. histories (it certainly will in the Naval history) now being written.\u2019<ref>Tuck Papers 2/9, letter from Birch to Tuck.</ref>\n\nIn all more than 220 students were trained at the Bedford Japanese School, including nine women. After the war some returned to their former pursuits, such as [[Hugh Lloyd-Jones]], who became Regius Professor of Greek at Oxford and was knighted, and [[Maurice Wiles]], who became Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford. Others abandoned their former interests and became sinologists or japanologists, such as [[David Hawkes (sinologist)|David Hawkes]], later Professor of Chinese at Oxford, Geoffrey Bownas, later Professor of Japanese at Sheffield University, and Albert Richard Davis, who became Professor of Chinese at Sydney University. Some became famous for other reasons, such as [[Denise Newman]], who served as the only female skipper in the Royal Navy Auxiliary Service for eight years, and sailed single-handed across the Atlantic in 1988 at the age of 64, and [[Wilfrid Noyce]], who was a member of the 1953 British Everest Expedition and later died in a mountaineering accident in the Pamirs.<ref>For biographies of all the students see Kornicki 2019.</ref>\n\n==Final years==\nIn 1946 Tuck was asked to take charge of a group of men who were required to translate captured Japanese materials at the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich|Royal Naval College]], Greenwich, and this lasted from 6 March to 22 November. Some had been students at Bedford Japanese School, while others had learnt Japanese in the Naval Section at Bletchley Park. During the year several of his former students from Bedford came to visit him, and in May he visited both Oxford and Cambridge where his former students, now back at university, were his hosts at commemorative dinners.<ref>'[Diary of the] Japanese Translation party', Tuck Papers 1/11; Kornicki 2019, pp. xix-xx.</ref> Like others who worked at Bletchley Park during the war, Tuck received no honours or recognition after the war. He was, however, warmly appreciated by his former pupils: Eric Ceadel continued to write to him from Cambridge, and David Goldberg, one of the many Jews at Bedford and Bletchley Park wrote, \u2018I should like you to accept the little book enclosed herewith as a token of my thanks to you for the past six months so pleasantly spent in Bedford, and especially for helping me to keep our Jewish religious observances throughout the period.\u2019 <ref>Tuck Papers 1/10, 1/11, 2/9. See also Martin Sugarman, \u2018Breaking the codes: Jewish personnel at Bletchley Park\u2019, ''Jewish historical studies'' 40 (2005): 197-246.</ref> A year after Tuck's death Ceadel, in a lecture at the Japan Society, wrote movingly of his memories of Tuck:\n\n'The late Captain Oswald T. Tuck RN, who died early last year, meant much to me, for it was he who instructed me in Japanese. Over 200 of his wartime students will always treasure a clear memory of his erect and dignified figure, with white hair and beard, and of his fine qualities of mind and character. In a quiet but effective manner he drew the interest of his students, and succeeded in imparting to them not only the basis of the Japanese language, but also an understanding and appreciation of many faces of Japanese literature, art and life.'<ref>Ceadel 1951.</ref>\n\n==Family==\nOn 25 July 1912 Tuck married Florence Jane Peglar (1873-1956): in his letters he referred to her as Florrie and then, after they were married, as Peggy. They had two children, Eleanor Margery (1913-1984, married surname Vincent-Townsend) and\nSylvia Catherine (1920-2006, married surname Crotty).<ref>Tuck's letters in the Tuck Papers; family tree on ancestry.co.uk</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n 'Some Comic Medieval Plays of Japan', ''Transactions and Proceedings of the Japan Society'', vol.XXI (28 Nov.1923).\n 'A Post-war Japanese Play',''Transactions and Proceedings of the Japan Society'', vol.XXIII (29 April 1926.\n 'Jitsuzo - a study of a student', ''Transactions and Proceedings of the Japan Society'', vol.XXVIII (1931).\n 'Kyogen: the Comic Drama of Japan', ''Transactions and Proceedings of the Japan Society'', vol.

Company assets include everything from office supplies and inventory to intellectual property.\n\n=== Fraudulent financial reporting ===\n\nFraudulent financial reporting is also known as earnings management fraud. In this context, management intentionally manipulates accounting policies or accounting estimates to improve financial statements. Public and private corporations commit fraudulent financial reporting to secure investor interest or obtain bank approvals for financing, as justifications for bonuses or increased salaries or to meet expectations of shareholders.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/financial-statement-fraud-57182.html|title=What Is Financial Statement Fraud?|access-date=2017-03-20|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320233602/http://smallbusiness.chron.com/financial-statement-fraud-57182.html|archivedate=March 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Securities and Exchange Commission has brought enforcement actions against corporations for many types of fraudulent financial reporting, including improper revenue recognition, period-end stuffing, fraudulent post-closing entries, improper asset valuations, and misleading non-GAAP financial measures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=4294994026|title=When do non-GAAP metrics become fraudulent publicity?|website=www.fraud-magazine.com|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref>\n\n== The fraud triangle ==\nThe fraud triangle is a model for explaining the factors that cause someone to commit fraudulent behaviors in accounting. It consists of three components, which together, lead to fraudulent behavior:\n* Incentives/ Pressure: Management or other employees have incentives or pressures to commit fraud.\n* Opportunities: Circumstances provide opportunities for management or employees to commit fraud.\n* Attitudes/rationalization: An attitude, character, or set of ethical values exists that allows management or employees to commit a dishonest act, or they are in an environment that imposes sufficient pressure that causes them to rationalize committing a dishonest act.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Auditing and Assurance Services|last=Alvin|first=Aren|publisher=Pearson|year=2016|isbn=978-0134065823|location=|pages=299}}</ref>\n'''Incentives/pressures:''' A common incentive for companies to manipulate [[financial statement]] is a decline in the company's financial prospects. Companies may also manipulate earnings to meet analysts' forecasts or benchmarks such as prior-year earnings to: meet [[debt covenant]] restrictions, achieve a bonus target based on earnings, or artificially inflate stock prices. As for [[misappropriation of assets]], financial pressures are a common incentive for employees. Employees with excessive financial obligations, or those with substance abuse or gambling problems may steal to meet their personal needs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Auditing and Assurance Services|last=Aren|first=Alvin|publisher=Pearson|year=2016|isbn=978-0134065823|location=New York|pages=300}}</ref>\n\n'''Opportunities:''' Although the financial statements of all companies are potentially subject to manipulation, the risk is greater for companies in industries where significant judgments and accounting estimates are involved. Turnover in accounting personnel or other deficiencies in accounting and information processes can create an opportunity for misstatement. As for misappropriation of assets, opportunities are greater in companies with accessible cash or with inventory or other valuable assets, especially if the assets are small or easily removed. A lack of controls over payments to vendors or payroll systems, can allow employees to create fictitious vendors or employees and bill the company for services or time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Auditing and Assurance Services|last=Aren|first=Alvin|publisher=Pearson|year=2016|isbn=978-0134065823|location=New York|pages=301}}</ref>\n\n'''Attitudes/rationalization:''' The attitude of top management toward financial reporting is a critical risk factor in assessing the likelihood of fraudulent financial statements. If the CEO or other top managers display a significant disregard for the financial reporting process, such as consistently issuing overly optimistic forecasts, or they are overly concerned about the meeting analysts' earnings forecast, fraudulent [[financial reporting]] is more likely. Similarly, for misappropriation of assets, if management cheats customers through overcharging for goods or engaging in high-pressure sales tactics, employees may feel that it is acceptable for them to behave in the same fashion.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Auditing and Assurance Services|last=Aren|first=Alvin|publisher=Pearson|year=2016|isbn=978-0134065823|location=New York|pages=302}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\n{{POV section|date=January 2014}}\nA weak internal control is an opportunity for a fraudster. Fraud is not an accounting problem; it is a social phenomenon. If you strip economic crime of its multitudinous variations, there are but three ways a victim can be unlawfully separated from money: by force, stealth or trickery.<ref>Wells, Joseph T. \"New Approaches to Fraud Deterrence.\" Business Credit 107.2 (2005): 33-6. ProQuest. Web. 31 Jan. 2018.</ref> Lack of transparency in financial transactions is an ideal method to hide a fraud. Poor management information where a company's management system does not produce results that are timely, accurate, sufficiently detailed and relevant. In such case, the warning signal of fraud such as ongoing theft from bank account can be obscured. Lack of an independent audit department within the company is also a sign of weak internal control. Poor accounting practice is also part of a weak internal control. An example of poor accounting practice is failure to make monthly reconciliation of bank account.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/09/14/top-10-reasons-frauds-occur-3817555/|title=Top 10 reasons why frauds occur|last=Frost|first=Ken|date=2012-09-14|website=Metro|access-date=2017-03-20|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506185211/http://metro.co.uk/2012/09/14/top-10-reasons-frauds-occur-3817555/|archivedate=May 6, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nA top executive can reduce the price of his/her company's stock easily due to [[information asymmetry]]. The executive can accelerate accounting of expected expenses, delay accounting of expected revenue, engage in [[off balance sheet]] transactions to make the company's profitability appear temporarily poorer, or simply promote and report severely conservative (e.g. pessimistic) estimates of future earnings. Such seemingly adverse earnings news will be likely to (at least temporarily) reduce share price. (This is again due to [[information asymmetries]] since it is more common for top executives to do everything they can to [[window dress]] their company's earnings forecasts.\n\nTop managers tend to share price to make a company an easier [[takeover]] target. When the company gets bought out (or taken private) \u2013 at a dramatically lower price \u2013 the takeover artist gains a windfall from the former top executive's actions to surreptitiously reduce share price. This can represent tens of billions of dollars (questionably) transferred from previous shareholders to the takeover artist. The former top executive is then rewarded with a [[golden handshake]] for presiding over the [[firesale]] that can sometimes be in the hundreds of millions of dollars for one or two years of work.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/challenging-times-crisis-hit-cosalt/story-14389742-detail/story.html|title=Challenging times for crisis-hit Cosalt|date=2012-01-11|work=Grimsby Telegraph|access-date=2017-04-09|language=en}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSimilar issues occur when a publicly held asset or non-profit organization undergoes [[privatization]]. Top executives often reap tremendous monetary benefits when a government-owned or non-profit entity is sold to private hands. Just as in the example above, they can facilitate this process by making the entity appear to be in financial crisis \u2013 this reduces the sale price (to the profit of the purchaser), and makes non-profits and governments more likely to sell. It can also contribute to a public perception that private entities are more efficiently run, thereby reinforcing the political will to sell off public assets. Again, due to [[asymmetric information]], policy makers and the general public see a government-owned firm that was a financial 'disaster' \u2013 miraculously turned around by the private sector (and typically resold) within a few years. Under the Special Plea in Fraud statute, \u201cthe government must \u2018establish by clear and convincing evidence that the contractor knew that its submitted claims were false, and that it intended to defraud the government by submitting those claims.\u2019\u201d Mere negligence, inconsistency, or discrepancies are not actionable under the Special Plea in Fraud statute.<ref>Horan, Jack. \"Fraud is here, Fraud is there, but is Fraud Everywhere?\" Contract Management 01 2016: 64,65,67-69.

Although the conviction was overturned on May 31, 2005, by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], the firm ceased performing audits and split into multiple entities.<ref>{{Citation|title=Arthur Andersen|date=2019-01-09|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Andersen&oldid=877519218|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref> The Enron scandal was defined as being one of the biggest audit failures of all time. The scandal included utilizing loopholes that were found within the [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States)|GAAP (General Accepted Accounting Principles)]]. For auditing a large-sized company such as Enron, the auditors were criticized for having brief meetings a few times a year that covered large amounts of material. By January 17, 2002, Enron decided to discontinue its business with Arthur Andersen, claiming they had failed in accounting advice and related documents.  Arthur Andersen was judged guilty of [[obstruction of justice]] for disposing of many emails and documents that were related to auditing Enron. Since the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons, the firm was forced to give up its CPA licenses later in 2002, costing over 113,000 employees their jobs. Although the ruling was later overturned by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], the once-proud firm's image was tarnished beyond repair, and it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.\n\nOn July 9, 2002 [[George W. Bush]] gave a speech about recent accounting scandals that had been uncovered. In spite of its stern tone, the speech did not focus on establishing new policy, but instead focused on actually enforcing current laws, which include holding CEOs and directors personally responsible for accountancy fraud.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/07/20020709-4.html|title=Archived White House Website via George W.

More radical means of [[accounting reform]] have been proposed, but so far have very little support. The debate itself, however, overlooks the difficulties of classifying any system of knowledge, including accounting, as rules-based or principles-based. This also led to the establishment of the [[Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act|Sarbanes-Oxley Act]].\n\nOn a lighter note, the [[List of Ig Nobel Prize winners|2002]] [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in Economics went to the CEOs of those companies involved in the corporate accounting scandals of that year for \"...adapting the mathematical concept of [[imaginary number]]s for use in the business world.\"\n\nIn 2003, [[Nortel]] made a big contribution to this list of scandals by incorrectly reporting a one cent per share earnings directly after their massive [[layoff]] period. They used this money to pay the top 43 managers of the company. The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] and the [[Ontario]] securities commission eventually settled civil action with Nortel. However, a separate civil action will be taken up against top Nortel executives including former CEO [[Frank A. Dunn]], Douglas C. Beatty, Michael J. Gollogly, and MaryAnne E. Pahapill and Hamilton.

Employees with excessive financial obligations, or those with substance abuse or gambling problems may steal to meet their personal needs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Auditing and Assurance Services|last=Aren|first=Alvin|publisher=Pearson|year=2016|isbn=978-0134065823|location=New York|pages=300}}</ref>\n\n'''Opportunities:''' Although the financial statements of all companies are potentially subject to manipulation, the risk is greater for companies in industries where significant judgments and accounting estimates are involved. Turnover in accounting personnel or other deficiencies in accounting and information processes can create an opportunity for misstatement. As for misappropriation of assets, opportunities are greater in companies with accessible cash or with inventory or other valuable assets, especially if the assets are small or easily removed. A lack of controls over payments to vendors or payroll systems, can allow employees to create fictitious vendors or employees and bill the company for services or time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Auditing and Assurance Services|last=Aren|first=Alvin|publisher=Pearson|year=2016|isbn=978-0134065823|location=New York|pages=301}}</ref>\n\n'''Attitudes/rationalization:''' The attitude of top management toward financial reporting is a critical risk factor in assessing the likelihood of fraudulent financial statements. If the CEO or other top managers display a significant disregard for the financial reporting process, such as consistently issuing overly optimistic forecasts, or they are overly concerned about the meeting analysts' earnings forecast, fraudulent [[financial reporting]] is more likely. Similarly, for misappropriation of assets, if management cheats customers through overcharging for goods or engaging in high-pressure sales tactics, employees may feel that it is acceptable for them to behave in the same fashion.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Auditing and Assurance Services|last=Aren|first=Alvin|publisher=Pearson|year=2016|isbn=978-0134065823|location=New York|pages=302}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\n{{POV section|date=January 2014}}\nA weak internal control is an opportunity for a fraudster. Fraud is not an accounting problem; it is a social phenomenon. If you strip economic crime of its multitudinous variations, there are but three ways a victim can be unlawfully separated from money: by force, stealth or trickery.<ref>Wells, Joseph T. \"New Approaches to Fraud Deterrence.\" Business Credit 107.2 (2005): 33-6. ProQuest. Web. 31 Jan. 2018.</ref> Lack of transparency in financial transactions is an ideal method to hide a fraud. Poor management information where a company's management system does not produce results that are timely, accurate, sufficiently detailed and relevant. In such case, the warning signal of fraud such as ongoing theft from bank account can be obscured. Lack of an independent audit department within the company is also a sign of weak internal control. Poor accounting practice is also part of a weak internal control. An example of poor accounting practice is failure to make monthly reconciliation of bank account.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/09/14/top-10-reasons-frauds-occur-3817555/|title=Top 10 reasons why frauds occur|last=Frost|first=Ken|date=2012-09-14|website=Metro|access-date=2017-03-20|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506185211/http://metro.co.uk/2012/09/14/top-10-reasons-frauds-occur-3817555/|archivedate=May 6, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nA top executive can reduce the price of his/her company's stock easily due to [[information asymmetry]]. The executive can accelerate accounting of expected expenses, delay accounting of expected revenue, engage in [[off balance sheet]] transactions to make the company's profitability appear temporarily poorer, or simply promote and report severely conservative (e.g. pessimistic) estimates of future earnings. Such seemingly adverse earnings news will be likely to (at least temporarily) reduce share price. (This is again due to [[information asymmetries]] since it is more common for top executives to do everything they can to [[window dress]] their company's earnings forecasts.\n\nTop managers tend to share price to make a company an easier [[takeover]] target. When the company gets bought out (or taken private) \u2013 at a dramatically lower price \u2013 the takeover artist gains a windfall from the former top executive's actions to surreptitiously reduce share price. This can represent tens of billions of dollars (questionably) transferred from previous shareholders to the takeover artist. The former top executive is then rewarded with a [[golden handshake]] for presiding over the [[firesale]] that can sometimes be in the hundreds of millions of dollars for one or two years of work.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/challenging-times-crisis-hit-cosalt/story-14389742-detail/story.html|title=Challenging times for crisis-hit Cosalt|date=2012-01-11|work=Grimsby Telegraph|access-date=2017-04-09|language=en}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSimilar issues occur when a publicly held asset or non-profit organization undergoes [[privatization]]. Top executives often reap tremendous monetary benefits when a government-owned or non-profit entity is sold to private hands. Just as in the example above, they can facilitate this process by making the entity appear to be in financial crisis \u2013 this reduces the sale price (to the profit of the purchaser), and makes non-profits and governments more likely to sell. It can also contribute to a public perception that private entities are more efficiently run, thereby reinforcing the political will to sell off public assets. Again, due to [[asymmetric information]], policy makers and the general public see a government-owned firm that was a financial 'disaster' \u2013 miraculously turned around by the private sector (and typically resold) within a few years. Under the Special Plea in Fraud statute, \u201cthe government must \u2018establish by clear and convincing evidence that the contractor knew that its submitted claims were false, and that it intended to defraud the government by submitting those claims.\u2019\u201d Mere negligence, inconsistency, or discrepancies are not actionable under the Special Plea in Fraud statute.<ref>Horan, Jack. \"Fraud is here, Fraud is there, but is Fraud Everywhere?\" Contract Management 01 2016: 64,65,67-69. ProQuest. Web. 31 Jan. 2018 .</ref>\n\nNot all accounting scandals are caused by top executives. The proceedings can take so long to come to trial that one executive saw the charges against him dismissed.<ref>Gray, John. \"CURTAIN RAISER.\" Canadian Business May 12, 2008: 61-4. ProQuest. Web. 31 Jan. 2018 .</ref> Often managers and employees are pressured or willingly alter financial statements for the personal benefit of the individuals over the company. [[Opportunism|Managerial opportunism]] plays a large role in these scandals. For example, managers who would be compensated more for short-term results would report inaccurate information, since short-term benefits outweigh the long-term ones such as pension obligations.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cunningham|first=Lawrence|title=The Appeal and Limits of Internal Controls to Fight Fraud, Terrorism, Other Ills|date=September 12, 2003|page=18}}</ref>\n\n==List of biggest accounting scandals==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Although the conviction was overturned on May 31, 2005, by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], the firm ceased performing audits and split into multiple entities.<ref>{{Citation|title=Arthur Andersen|date=2019-01-09|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Andersen&oldid=877519218|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref> The Enron scandal was defined as being one of the biggest audit failures of all time. The scandal included utilizing loopholes that were found within the [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States)|GAAP (General Accepted Accounting Principles)]]. For auditing a large-sized company such as Enron, the auditors were criticized for having brief meetings a few times a year that covered large amounts of material. By January 17, 2002, Enron decided to discontinue its business with Arthur Andersen, claiming they had failed in accounting advice and related documents.  Arthur Andersen was judged guilty of [[obstruction of justice]] for disposing of many emails and documents that were related to auditing Enron. Since the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons, the firm was forced to give up its CPA licenses later in 2002, costing over 113,000 employees their jobs. Although the ruling was later overturned by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], the once-proud firm's image was tarnished beyond repair, and it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.\n\nOn July 9, 2002 [[George W. Bush]] gave a speech about recent accounting scandals that had been uncovered. In spite of its stern tone, the speech did not focus on establishing new policy, but instead focused on actually enforcing current laws, which include holding CEOs and directors personally responsible for accountancy fraud.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/07/20020709-4.html|title=Archived White House Website via George W.

More radical means of [[accounting reform]] have been proposed, but so far have very little support. The debate itself, however, overlooks the difficulties of classifying any system of knowledge, including accounting, as rules-based or principles-based. This also led to the establishment of the [[Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act|Sarbanes-Oxley Act]].\n\nOn a lighter note, the [[List of Ig Nobel Prize winners|2002]] [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in Economics went to the CEOs of those companies involved in the corporate accounting scandals of that year for \"...adapting the mathematical concept of [[imaginary number]]s for use in the business world.\"\n\nIn 2003, [[Nortel]] made a big contribution to this list of scandals by incorrectly reporting a one cent per share earnings directly after their massive [[layoff]] period. They used this money to pay the top 43 managers of the company. The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] and the [[Ontario]] securities commission eventually settled civil action with Nortel. However, a separate civil action will be taken up against top Nortel executives including former CEO [[Frank A. Dunn]], Douglas C. Beatty, Michael J. Gollogly, and MaryAnne E. Pahapill and Hamilton.

[[Associated Press]] via [[Seattle Times]], December 18, 2008.</ref> Indeed, Friehling's practice was so small that for years, he operated out of his house; he only moved into an office when Madoff customers wanted to know more about who was auditing his accounts.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Madoff Chronicles|last=Ross|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Ross (journalist)|publisher=[[Disney Publishing Worldwide|Kingswell]]|year=2015|isbn=9781401310295|url=https://archive.org/details/madoffchronicles00bria}}</ref> Ultimately, Friehling admitted to simply rubber-stamping at least 18 years' worth of Madoff's filings with the SEC. He also revealed that he continued to audit Madoff even though he had invested a substantial amount of money with him (Accountants are not allowed to audit broker-dealers with whom they're investing). He agreed to forfeit $3.18 million in accounting fees and withdrawals from his account with Madoff. His involvement makes the Madoff scheme the largest accounting fraud in world history.<ref name=\"Lawcom\">Hamblett, Mark.
