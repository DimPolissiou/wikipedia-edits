She assumed that children's songs were a peculiar form of coded historical narrative, propaganda or covert protest, and rarely considered that they could have been written simply for entertainment.<ref name=Wilton2004 />{{sfn|Opie|2004|p=179}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

Prichard, 1984 p. 383\" /> From this period we sometimes know the origins and authors of rhymes\u2014for instance, in \"[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]]\" which combines the melody of an 18th-century French tune \"[[Twinkle twinkle little star#French \"nursery rhyme\" version|Ah vous dirai-je, Maman]]\" with a 19th-century English poem by [[Jane Taylor (poet)|Jane Taylor]] entitled \"The Star\" used as lyrics.<ref>Paula R. Feldman, ed: ''British women poets of the Romantic era: an anthology'' (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997), p. 712. {{ISBN|080185430X}}</ref>\n\nEarly folk song collectors also often collected (what are now known as) nursery rhymes, including in Scotland [[Sir Walter Scott]] and in Germany [[Clemens Brentano]] and [[Achim von Arnim]] in ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'' (1806\u20131808).{{sfn|Carpenter|Prichard|1984|p=384}} The first, and possibly the most important academic collection to focus in this area was [[James Halliwell-Phillipps|James Orchard Halliwell]]'s ''The Nursery Rhymes of England'' (1842) and ''Popular Rhymes and Tales'' in 1849, in which he divided rhymes into antiquities (historical), fireside stories, game-rhymes, alphabet-rhymes, riddles, nature-rhymes, places and families, proverbs, superstitions, customs, and nursery songs (lullabies).<ref>R. M. Dorson, ''The British Folklorists: a History'' (Taylor & Francis, 1999), p. 67.</ref> By the time of [[Sabine Baring-Gould]]'s ''A Book of Nursery Songs'' (1895), folklore was an academic study, full of comments and footnotes. A professional anthropologist, [[Andrew Lang]] (1844\u20131912) produced ''The Nursery Rhyme Book'' in 1897. \n\n===20th century===\nThe early years of the 20th century are notable for the illustrations to children's books including [[Randolph Caldecott]]'s ''Hey Diddle Diddle Picture Book'' (1909) and [[Arthur Rackham]]'s ''Mother Goose'' (1913). The definitive study of English rhymes remains the work of [[Iona and Peter Opie]].<ref name=Opie1951 />\n\n==Meanings of nursery rhymes==\nMany nursery rhymes have been argued to have hidden meanings and origins. [[John Bellenden Ker]] (1765?\u20131842), for example, wrote four volumes arguing that English nursery rhymes were actually written in 'Low Saxon', a hypothetical early form of Dutch. He then 'translated' them back into English, revealing in particular a strong tendency to [[anti-clericalism]].<ref name=Wilton2004 />{{sfn|Carpenter|Prichard|1984|p=290}} Many of the ideas about the links between rhymes and historical persons, or events, can be traced back to Katherine Elwes's book ''The Real Personages of Mother Goose'' (1930), in which she linked famous nursery-rhyme characters with real people, on little or no evidence. She assumed that children's songs were a peculiar form of coded historical narrative, propaganda or covert protest, and rarely considered that they could have been written simply for entertainment.<ref name=Wilton2004 />{{sfn|Opie|2004|p=179}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

Even in the late 18th century we can sometimes see how rhymes like \"[[Little Robin Redbreast]]\" were cleaned up for a young audience.{{sfn|Opie|Opie|1997|pp=371\u2013372}} In the late 19th century the major concern seems to have been violence and crime, which led leading children's publishers in the United States like Jacob Abbot and Samuel Goodrich to 'improve' Mother Goose rhymes.<ref>S. Wadsworth, ''In the Company of Books: Literature and Its \"classes\" in Nineteenth-century America'' (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2006), p. 22.</ref>\n\nIn the early and mid-20th centuries this was a form of [[bowdlerisation]], concerned with some of the more violent elements of nursery rhymes and led to the formation of organisations like the British 'Society for Nursery Rhyme Reform'.<ref>N.

''Handbook of children, culture, and violence'' (Sage, 2005), p. 136.</ref> [[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalysts]] such as [[Bruno Bettelheim]] strongly criticized this revisionism, on the grounds that it weakened their usefulness to both children and adults as ways of symbolically resolving issues and it has been argued that revised versions may not perform the functions of [[catharsis]] for children, or allow them to imaginatively deal with violence and danger.<ref>Jack Zipes, ''The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World'', p. 48, {{ISBN|0-312-29380-1}}.</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century revisionism of nursery rhymes became associated with the idea of [[political correctness]]. Most attempts to reform nursery rhymes on this basis appear to be either very small scale, light-hearted updating, like Felix Dennis's ''When Jack Sued Jill \u2013 Nursery Rhymes for Modern Times'' (2006), or satires written as if from the point of view of political correctness in order to condemn reform.<ref>F. Dennis, ''When Jack Sued Jill \u2013 Nursery Rhymes for Modern Times'' (Ebury, 2006).</ref> The controversy in Britain in 1986 over changing the language of \"[[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep]]\" because, it was alleged in the popular press, it was seen as racially dubious, was apparently based only on a rewriting of the rhyme in one private nursery, as an exercise for the children.<ref>J.

Hemsworth, along with nearby villages such as [[Ackworth, West Yorkshire|Ackworth]], [[Fitzwilliam, West Yorkshire|Fitzwilliam]], [[Havercroft]], [[Ryhill]], [[South Elmsall]] and [[South Kirkby]] was made into a special regeneration area, and fortunes have improved as a result.\n\nThe [[Hemsworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Hemsworth constituency]] is famous for being the place where Labour votes were said to be \"weighed rather than counted\" during the 1960s and 1970s,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/results_constituencies/constituencies/311.stm |work=BBC News |title=Vote 2001:Hemsworth|accessdate=14 February 2007}}</ref> but the town is not even so heavily Labour-voting as it once was. The town's [[Member of Parliament]] is [[Jon Trickett]], a former leader of Leeds council.\n\nIn May 2005, the [[Office for National Statistics]] estimated that unemployment in Hemsworth was just 2.8%. This marks progress from periods in the previous two decades when it could reach as high as 50%.\n\n[[File:The Boating Lake, Hemsworth Water Park - geograph.org.uk - 244646.jpg|thumb|left|The boating lake at Hemsworth Water Park]]\n\nAlso in Hemsworth is the Hemsworth Water Park, situated on the outskirts of Hemsworth. Hemsworth Water Park has two lakes; the largest lake is available for pedalo rides and has a man-made sandy beach; the smallest lake is in a more secluded area to attract wildlife.
