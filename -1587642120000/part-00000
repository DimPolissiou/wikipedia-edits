While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The remainder of the show dealt with the family trying to grapple with Paul's death. New male characters, played by [[James Garner]] and [[David Spade]], were later added to the main cast as Ritter's replacements. Shortly before his death, Ritter had done a week-long taping with ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', which was aired as a tribute to him, introduced by [[Henry Winkler]], the executive producer of the show and very close friend of Ritter's. Four days after Ritter's death, [[Nick at Nite]] ran an all-night ''Three's Company'' marathon dedicated to his memory.<ref name=\"NickatNite\">{{cite news| url=http://gothamist.com/2003/09/15/threes_company_marathon.php| title=Three's Company Marathon| accessdate=September 16, 2012| first=Jen| last=Chung| date=September 15, 2003| journal=Gothamist| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017205926/http://gothamist.com/2003/09/15/threes_company_marathon.php| archivedate=October 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Ritter was [[56th Primetime Emmy Awards#Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series|posthumously given an Emmy nomination]] for playing Paul Hennessy in ''8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter'', but lost to [[Kelsey Grammer]] for playing the [[Dr. Frasier Crane|title character]] of ''[[Frasier]]''.

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970.<ref name=lipton>{{cite magazine| last=Lipton| first=Michael A.| title=Acting His Age| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| magazine=People| date=December 16, 2002| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107160642/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| archivedate=November 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:John Ritter 1977.jpg|thumb|Ritter as [[Jack Tripper]], 1977]]\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

In the episode, the character [[Sheldon Cooper]] watches the Nobel award ceremony on his laptop, and jealously berates Perlmutter: \"Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there, clutching that Nobel prize. What's the matter Saul, you afraid somebody's going to steal it? Like you stole Einstein's cosmological constant?\" Then later: \"Oh, now Perlmutter's shaking the King's hand. Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf, he might have lifted it.\"\n\nPerlmutter was also referenced in the 2011 episode of The Big Bang Theory, \"The Rhinitis Revelation\". In a conversation with his mother, Sheldon says, \"I\u2019ve got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I\u2019m taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, I\u2019ve worked up a couple of Q\u2019s that will stump his sorry A.\" Later in the episode, Sheldon criticises the lecture and questions the decision to award Perlmutter a Nobel Prize.\n\n==Technical reports and conference/event proceedings==\n* Perlmutter, S., ''et al.''
