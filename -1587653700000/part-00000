For example, the following data satisfy the parallel condition. In parallel data, even if a correlation matrix is used instead of a covariance matrix, there is no loss of information.

Conventional names give no information about the nature of each coefficient, or give misleading information (e.g., composite reliability). Conventional names are inconsistent. Some are formulas, and others are coefficients. Some are named after the original developer, some are named after someone who is not the original developer, and others do not include the name of any person. While one formula is referred to by multiple names, multiple formulas are referred to by one notation (e.g., alphas and omegas). The proposed systematic names and their notation for these reliability coefficients are as follows: <ref name = Cho/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Systematic names of reliability coefficients\n|-\n!  !!

However, this interpretation overlooks the fact that <math>\\rho_{ST}</math> underestimes reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent. At the population level, the maximum of all possible <math>\\rho_{ST}</math> values is closer to reliability than the average of all possible <math>\\rho_{ST}</math> values.<ref name=ChoKim/> This mathematical fact was already known even before the publication of Cronbach (1951).<ref name=Guttman>Guttman, L.

They did not give the reliability coefficients particular names. Equation 20 in their article is <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. This formula is often referred to as Kuder-Richardson Formula 20, or KR-20. They dealt with cases where the observed scores were dichotomous (e.g., correct or incorrect), so the expression of KR-20 is slightly different from the conventional formula of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. A review of this paper reveals that they did not present a general formula because they did not need to, not because they were not able to. Let <math>p_i</math> denote the correct answer ratio of item <math>i </math>, and <math>q_i</math> denote the incorrect answer ratio of item <math>i</math> (<math>p_i + q_i = 1 </math>).

He criticized that the underestimation was likely to be excessively severe, such that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could sometimes lead to negative values.\nBecause of these problems, he argued that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could not be recommended as an alternative to the split-half technique.\n=== Cronbach (1951) ===\nAs with previous studies<ref name = Hoyt /><ref name = Guttman /><ref name = JF /><ref name = Gulliksen />, Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> invented another method to derive <math>\\rho_{T} </math>. His interpretation was more intuitively attractive than those of previous studies. That is, he proved that <math> \\rho_ {T} </math> equals the average of <math> \\rho_{ST} </math> values obtained for all possible split-halves. He criticized that the name KR-20 was weird and suggested a new name, coefficient alpha. His approach has been a huge success. However, he not only omitted some key facts, but also gave an incorrect explanation.\n\nFirst, he positioned coefficient alpha as a general formula of KR-20, but omitted the explanation that existing studies had published the precisely identical formula. Those who read only Cronbach (1951) without background knowledge could misunderstand that he was the first to develop the general formula of KR-20. \n\nSecond, he did not explain under what condition <math>\\rho_{T}</math> equals reliability. Non-experts could misunderstand that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> was a general reliability coefficient that could be used for all data regardless of prerequisites. \n\nThird, he did not explain why he changed his attitude toward <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. In particular, he did not provide a clear answer to the underestimation problem of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, which he himself<ref name = c1943 /> had criticized. \n\nFourth, he argued that a high value of <math>\\rho_{T}</math> indicated homogeneity of the data.\n\n===After 1951===\nNovick and Lewis (1967)<ref name = NL>Novick, M.

Psychometrika, 32(1), 1\u201313. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02289400</ref> proved the necessary and sufficient condition for <math>\\rho_{T}</math> to be equal to reliability, and named it the condition of being essentially tau-equivalent.\n\nCronbach (1978)<ref name = c1978/> mentioned that the reason Cronbach (1951) received a lot of citations was \"mostly because [he] put a brand name on a common-place coefficient\"(p.263)<ref name = Cho />. He explained that he had originally planned to name other types of reliability coefficients (e.g., inter-rater reliability or test-retest reliability) in consecutive Greek letter (e.g., <math>\\beta</math>, <math>\\gamma</math>, <math>\\ldots</math>), but later changed his mind.\n\nCronbach and Schavelson (2004)<ref name = c2004>Cronbach, L.

He opposed the use of the name Cronbach's alpha. He explicitly denied the existence of existing studies that had published the general formula of KR-20 prior to Cronbach (1951).\n\n== Common misconceptions about tau-equivalent reliability<ref name=ChoKim/>==\n===The value of tau-equivalent reliability ranges between zero and one===\nBy definition, reliability cannot be less than zero and cannot be greater than one. Many textbooks mistakenly equate <math> \\rho_{T}</math> with reliability and give an inaccurate explanation of its range. <math>\\rho_{T}</math> is less than reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by -1. The covariance matrix between items is as follows, <math> \\rho_{T}=-3 </math>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>X_3</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>1</math>||<math>1</math>||<math>-1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>1</math> || <math>1</math>|| <math>-1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_3</math>\n| <math>-1</math> || <math>-1</math> || <math>1</math>\n|}\nNegative <math>\\rho_{T}</math> can occur for reasons such as negative discrimination or mistakes in processing reversely scored items.\n\nUnlike <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., <math>\\rho_{C}</math>) are always greater than or equal to zero.\n\nThis anomaly was first pointed out by Cronbach (1943)<ref name=c1943/> to criticize <math> \\rho_{T}</math>, but Cronbach (1951)<ref name=Cronbach/> did not comment on this problem in his article, which he himself<ref name=c2004/> described as being encyclopedic.\n\n=== If there is no measurement error, the value of tau-equivalent reliability is one===\nThis anomaly also originates from the fact that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> underestimates reliability. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by two. The covariance matrix between items is as follows, <math>\\rho_{T}=.9375</math>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>X_3</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>1</math>||<math>1</math>||<math>1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>1</math> || <math>1</math>|| <math>2</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_3</math>\n| <math>2</math> || <math>2</math> || <math>4</math>\n|}\nFor the above data, both <math>\\rho_{P}</math> and <math>\\rho_{C}</math> have a value of one.\n===A high value of tau-equivalent reliability indicates homogeneity between the items===\nMany textbooks refer to <math>\\rho_{T}</math> as an indicator of homogeneity between items. This misconception stems from the inaccurate explanation of Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> that high <math>\\rho_{T}</math> values show homogeneity between the items. Homogeneity is a term that is rarely used in the modern literature, and related studies interpret the term as referring to unidimensionality. Several studies have provided proofs or counterexamples that high <math> \\rho_{T}</math> values do not indicate unidimensionality.<ref name=Cortina>Cortina, J. M. (1993). What is coefficient alpha?

The term is sometimes used to refer to a certain kind of reliability (e.g., internal consistency reliability), but it is unclear exactly which reliability coefficients are included here, in addition to <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach/> used the term in several senses without an explicit definition. Cho and Kim (2015)<ref name = ChoKim/> showed that <math> \\rho_{T}</math> is not an indicator of any of these.\n===Removing items using \"alpha if item deleted\" always increases reliability===\nRemoving an item using \"alpha if item deleted\" may result in 'alpha inflation,' where sample-level reliability is reported to be higher than population-level reliability.<ref name=KL>Kopalle, P. K., & Lehmann, D. R. (1997). Alpha inflation? The impact of eliminating scale items on Cronbach\u2019s alpha.

It is also recommended that the whole sample be divided into two and cross-validated.<ref name=KL/>\n\n== Ideal reliability level and how to increase reliability ==\n=== Nunnally's recommendations for the level of reliability===\nThe most frequently cited source of how much reliability coefficients should be is Nunnally's book.<ref name=n1>Nunnally, J. C. (1967). Psychometric theory. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref><ref name=n2>Nunnally, J. C. (1978). Psychometric theory (2nd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref><ref name=n3>Nunnally, J. C., & Bernstein, I. H. (1994). Psychometric theory (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> However, his recommendations are cited contrary to his intentions. What he meant was to apply different criteria depending on the purpose or stage of the study. However, regardless of the nature of the research, such as exploratory research, applied research, and scale development research, a criterion of .7 is universally used<ref name=LBM>Lance, C. E., Butts, M. M., & Michels, L. C. (2006). What did they really say? Organizational Research Methods, 9(2), 202\u2013220. https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428105284919</ref>. .7 is the criterion he recommended for the early stages of a study, which most studies published in the journal are not. Rather than .7, the criterion of .8 referred to applied research by Nunnally is more appropriate for most empirical studies.<ref name=LBM/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\n|+ Nunnally's recommendations on the level of reliability\n|-\n!   !! 1st edition<ref name=n1/> !! 2nd<ref name=n2/> & 3rd<ref name=n3/> edition\n|-\n| Early stage of research|| .5 or .6 || .7\n|-\n| Applied research|| .8 || .8\n|-\n| When making important decisions || .95 (minimum .9) || .95 (minimum .9)\n|}\n\nHis recommendation level did not imply a cutoff point. If a criterion means a cutoff point, it is important whether or not it is met, but it is unimportant how much it is over or under. He did not mean that it should be strictly .8 when referring to the criteria of .8. If the reliability has a value near .8 (e.g., 78), it can be considered that his recommendation has been met.<ref name = c2020>Cho, E. (2020). A comprehensive review of so-called Cronbach's alpha. Journal of Product Research, 38(1), 9\u201320.</ref>\n\nHis idea was that there is a cost to increasing reliability, so there is no need to try to obtain maximum reliability in every situation.\n\n===Cost to obtain a high level of reliability===\nMany textbooks explain that the higher the value of reliability, the better. The potential side effects of high reliability are rarely discussed. However, the principle of sacrificing something to get one also applies to reliability.\n====Trade-off between reliability and validity<ref name = ChoKim/>====\nMeasurements with perfect reliability lack validity. For example, a person who take the test with the reliability of one will get a perfect score or a zero score, because the examinee who give the correct answer or incorrect answer on one item will give the correct answer or incorrect answer on all other items. The phenomenon in which validity is sacrificed to increase reliability is called attenuation paradox.<ref>Loevinger, J. (1954). The attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 51(5), 493\u2013504. https://doi.org/10.1002/j.2333-8504.1954.tb00485.x</ref><ref>Humphreys, L. (1956). The normal curve and the attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 53(6), 472\u2013476. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0041091</ref>\n\nA high value of reliability can be in conflict with content validity. For high content validity, each item should be constructed to be able to comprehensively represent the content to be measured. However, a strategy of repeatedly measuring essentially the same question in different ways is often used only for the purpose of increasing reliability.<ref>Boyle, G. J. (1991). Does item homogeneity indicate internal consistency or item redundancy in psychometric scales?

However, the increase in the number of items hinders the efficiency of measurements.\n===Methods to increase reliability ===\nDespite the costs associated with increasing reliability discussed above, a high level of reliability may be required. The following methods can be considered to increase reliability.\n====Before data collection====\nEliminate the ambiguity of the measurement item.\n\nDo not measure what the respondents do not know.\n\nIncrease the number of items. However, care should be taken not to excessively inhibit the efficiency of the measurement.\n\nUse a scale that is known to be highly reliable.<ref>Lee, H. (2017). Research Methodology (2nd ed.), Hakhyunsa.</ref>\n\nConduct a pretest. Discover in advance the problem of reliability.\n\nExclude or modify items that are different in content or form from other items (e.g., reversely scored items).\n====After data collection====\nRemove the problematic items using \"alpha if item deleted\". However, this deletion should be accompanied by a theoretical rationale.\n\nUse a more accurate reliability coefficient than <math>\\rho_{T}</math>.

To avoid this inconvenience and possible error, even studies reporting the use of SEM rely on <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math> instead of SEM-based reliability coefficients.<ref name = Cho/> There are a few alternatives to automatically calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients.\n\n1) R (free): The psych package <ref>http://personality-project.org/r/overview.pdf</ref> calculates various reliability coefficients.\n\n2) EQS (paid)<ref>http://www.mvsoft.com/eqs60.htm</ref>: This SEM software has a function to calculate reliability coefficients.\n\n3) RelCalc (free)<ref name = Cho/>: Available with Microsoft Excel. <Math>\\rho_C</math> can be obtained without the need for SEM software. Various multidimensional SEM reliability coefficients and various types of <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> can be calculated based on the results of SEM software.\n\n==Derivation of formula<ref name=Cho/>==\nAssumption 1. The observed score of an item consists of the true score of the item and the error of the item, which is independent of the true score. <math>X_i=T_i+e_i</math>\n\nLemma. <math>Cov(T_i,e_i)=Cov(T_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 2. Errors are independent of each other. <math>Cov(e_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 3. (The assumption of being essentially tau-equivalent) The true score of an item consists of the true score common to all items and the constant of the item. <math>T_i=\\mu_i + t</math>\n\nLet <math>T</math> denote the sum of the item true scores. <math>T=\\sum_{i=1}^k T_i</math>\n\nThe variance of <math>T</math> is called the true score variance.\n\nDefinition. Reliability is the ratio of true score variance to observed score variance. <math>\\rho={\\sigma^2_T \\over \\sigma^2_X}</math>\n\nThe following relationship is established from the above assumptions.\n\n<math>\\sigma^2_i=Var(\\mu_i + t+e_i)=\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_i} (\\because Var(\\mu_i)=Cov(t,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,t)=0)</math>\n\n<math>\\sigma_{ij}=Cov(T_i+e_i, T_j+e_j)=\\sigma^2_t (\\because Cov(T_i,e_j)=Cov(T_j,e_i)=Cov(e_i,e_j)=0)</math>\n\nTherefore, the covariance matrix between items is as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>\\ldots</math>\n! <math>X_k</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_1}</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>||<math>\\ldots</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_2}</math>|| <math>\\ldots</math>|| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>\\vdots</math>\n| <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\ddots</math>|| <math>\\vdots</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_k</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\ldots</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_k}</math>\n|-\n\n|}\nYou can see that <math> \\sigma^2_t</math> equals the mean of the covariances between items.

The assumption he used is essential tau-equivalence in modern terms.\n\n====Recognition of  KR-20's original formula and general formula at the time====\nThe two formulas were recognized to be exactly identical, and the expression of general formula of KR-20 was not used. Hoyt<ref name = Hoyt/> explained that his method \"gives precisely the same result\" as KR-20 (p.156). Jackson and Ferguson<ref name = JF/> stated that the two formulas are \"identical\"(p.74). Guttman<ref name = Guttman/> said <math> \\lambda_3 </math> is \"algebraically identical\" to KR-20 (p.275). Gulliksen<ref name = Gulliksen/> also admitted that the two formulas are \u201cidentical\u201d(p.224). \n\nEven studies critical of KR-20 did not point out that the original formula of KR-20 could only be applied to dichotomous data.<ref name=c1943>Cronbach, L.

Hoyt<ref name=Hoyt2>Hoyt, C. J. (1941). Note on a simplified method of computing test reliability: Educational and Psychological Measurement, 1(1). https://doi.org/10.1177/001316444100100109</ref> argued that this characteristic alone made <math> \\rho_{T}</math> more recommendable than the traditional split-half technique, which was unknown whether to underestimate or overestimate reliability.\n\nCronbach (1943)<ref name =c1943/> was critical of the underestimation of <math> \\rho_{T} </math>. He was concerned that it was not known how much <math> \\rho_{T} </math> underestimated reliability. He criticized that the underestimation was likely to be excessively severe, such that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could sometimes lead to negative values.\nBecause of these problems, he argued that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could not be recommended as an alternative to the split-half technique.\n=== Cronbach (1951) ===\nAs with previous studies<ref name = Hoyt /><ref name = Guttman /><ref name = JF /><ref name = Gulliksen />, Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> invented another method to derive <math>\\rho_{T} </math>. His interpretation was more intuitively attractive than those of previous studies. That is, he proved that <math> \\rho_ {T} </math> equals the average of <math> \\rho_{ST} </math> values obtained for all possible split-halves. He criticized that the name KR-20 was weird and suggested a new name, coefficient alpha. His approach has been a huge success. However, he not only omitted some key facts, but also gave an incorrect explanation.\n\nFirst, he positioned coefficient alpha as a general formula of KR-20, but omitted the explanation that existing studies had published the precisely identical formula. Those who read only Cronbach (1951) without background knowledge could misunderstand that he was the first to develop the general formula of KR-20. \n\nSecond, he did not explain under what condition <math>\\rho_{T}</math> equals reliability. Non-experts could misunderstand that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> was a general reliability coefficient that could be used for all data regardless of prerequisites. \n\nThird, he did not explain why he changed his attitude toward <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. In particular, he did not provide a clear answer to the underestimation problem of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, which he himself<ref name = c1943 /> had criticized. \n\nFourth, he argued that a high value of <math>\\rho_{T}</math> indicated homogeneity of the data.\n\n===After 1951===\nNovick and Lewis (1967)<ref name = NL>Novick, M.

Psychometrika, 32(1), 1\u201313. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02289400</ref> proved the necessary and sufficient condition for <math>\\rho_{T}</math> to be equal to reliability, and named it the condition of being essentially tau-equivalent.\n\nCronbach (1978)<ref name = c1978/> mentioned that the reason Cronbach (1951) received a lot of citations was \"mostly because [he] put a brand name on a common-place coefficient\"(p.263)<ref name = Cho />. He explained that he had originally planned to name other types of reliability coefficients (e.g., inter-rater reliability or test-retest reliability) in consecutive Greek letter (e.g., <math>\\beta</math>, <math>\\gamma</math>, <math>\\ldots</math>), but later changed his mind.\n\nCronbach and Schavelson (2004)<ref name = c2004>Cronbach, L.

He opposed the use of the name Cronbach's alpha. He explicitly denied the existence of existing studies that had published the general formula of KR-20 prior to Cronbach (1951).\n\n== Common misconceptions about tau-equivalent reliability<ref name=ChoKim/>==\n===The value of tau-equivalent reliability ranges between zero and one===\nBy definition, reliability cannot be less than zero and cannot be greater than one. Many textbooks mistakenly equate <math> \\rho_{T}</math> with reliability and give an inaccurate explanation of its range. <math>\\rho_{T}</math> is less than reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by -1.

Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by two.

This misconception stems from the inaccurate explanation of Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> that high <math>\\rho_{T}</math> values show homogeneity between the items. Homogeneity is a term that is rarely used in the modern literature, and related studies interpret the term as referring to unidimensionality.

C., & Bernstein, I. H. (1994). Psychometric theory (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> However, his recommendations are cited contrary to his intentions. What he meant was to apply different criteria depending on the purpose or stage of the study. However, regardless of the nature of the research, such as exploratory research, applied research, and scale development research, a criterion of .7 is universally used<ref name=LBM>Lance, C. E., Butts, M. M., & Michels, L. C. (2006). What did they really say? Organizational Research Methods, 9(2), 202\u2013220. https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428105284919</ref>. .7 is the criterion he recommended for the early stages of a study, which most studies published in the journal are not. Rather than .7, the criterion of .8 referred to applied research by Nunnally is more appropriate for most empirical studies.<ref name=LBM/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\n|+ Nunnally's recommendations on the level of reliability\n|-\n!   !! 1st edition<ref name=n1/> !! 2nd<ref name=n2/> & 3rd<ref name=n3/> edition\n|-\n| Early stage of research|| .5 or .6 || .7\n|-\n| Applied research|| .8 || .8\n|-\n| When making important decisions || .95 (minimum .9) || .95 (minimum .9)\n|}\n\nHis recommendation level did not imply a cutoff point. If a criterion means a cutoff point, it is important whether or not it is met, but it is unimportant how much it is over or under. He did not mean that it should be strictly .8 when referring to the criteria of .8. If the reliability has a value near .8 (e.g., 78), it can be considered that his recommendation has been met.<ref name = c2020>Cho, E. (2020). A comprehensive review of so-called Cronbach's alpha. Journal of Product Research, 38(1), 9\u201320.</ref>\n\nHis idea was that there is a cost to increasing reliability, so there is no need to try to obtain maximum reliability in every situation.\n\n===Cost to obtain a high level of reliability===\nMany textbooks explain that the higher the value of reliability, the better. The potential side effects of high reliability are rarely discussed. However, the principle of sacrificing something to get one also applies to reliability.\n====Trade-off between reliability and validity<ref name = ChoKim/>====\nMeasurements with perfect reliability lack validity. For example, a person who take the test with the reliability of one will get a perfect score or a zero score, because the examinee who give the correct answer or incorrect answer on one item will give the correct answer or incorrect answer on all other items. The phenomenon in which validity is sacrificed to increase reliability is called attenuation paradox.<ref>Loevinger, J. (1954). The attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 51(5), 493\u2013504. https://doi.org/10.1002/j.2333-8504.1954.tb00485.x</ref><ref>Humphreys, L. (1956). The normal curve and the attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 53(6), 472\u2013476. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0041091</ref>\n\nA high value of reliability can be in conflict with content validity. For high content validity, each item should be constructed to be able to comprehensively represent the content to be measured. However, a strategy of repeatedly measuring essentially the same question in different ways is often used only for the purpose of increasing reliability.<ref>Boyle, G. J. (1991). Does item homogeneity indicate internal consistency or item redundancy in psychometric scales?

However, the increase in the number of items hinders the efficiency of measurements.\n===Methods to increase reliability ===\nDespite the costs associated with increasing reliability discussed above, a high level of reliability may be required. The following methods can be considered to increase reliability.\n====Before data collection====\nEliminate the ambiguity of the measurement item.\n\nDo not measure what the respondents do not know.\n\nIncrease the number of items. However, care should be taken not to excessively inhibit the efficiency of the measurement.\n\nUse a scale that is known to be highly reliable.<ref>Lee, H. (2017). Research Methodology (2nd ed.), Hakhyunsa.</ref>\n\nConduct a pretest.

However, different opinions are given on which reliability coefficient should be used instead of <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>.\n\nDifferent reliability coefficients ranked first in each simulation study<ref name=KTD/><ref name=Osburn/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=TC/><ref name=VVS/> comparing the accuracy of several reliability coefficients.<ref name=ChoKim/>\n\nThe majority opinion is to use SEM-based reliability coefficients as an alternative to <math> {\\rho} _ {T} </math>.<ref name=Cho/><ref name=ChoKim/><ref name=DBB/><ref name=GY/><ref name=Peters/><ref name=RM/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=YG/>\n\nHowever, there is no consensus on which of the several SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., unidimensional or multidimensional models) is the best to use.\n\nSome people say <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math><ref name=RZ/> as an alternative, but <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> shows information that is completely different from reliability. <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> is a type of coefficient comparable to Revelle's <math>\\beta</math>.<ref name=Revelle/><ref name=RZ/> They do not substitute, but complement reliability.<ref name=Cho/>\n\nAmong SEM-based reliability coefficients, multidimensional reliability coefficients are rarely used, and the most commonly used is <math>{\\rho}_{C}</math> .<ref name = Cho/>\n===Software for SEM-based reliability coefficients===\nGeneral-purpose statistical software such as SPSS and SAS include a function to calculate <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>. Users who don't know the formula of <math> {\\rho}_{T}</math> have no problem in obtaining the estimates with just a few mouse clicks. \n\nSEM software such as AMOS, LISREL, and MPLUS does not have a function to calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients. Users need to calculate the result by inputting it to the formula. To avoid this inconvenience and possible error, even studies reporting the use of SEM rely on <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math> instead of SEM-based reliability coefficients.<ref name = Cho/> There are a few alternatives to automatically calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients.\n\n1) R (free): The psych package <ref>http://personality-project.org/r/overview.pdf</ref> calculates various reliability coefficients.\n\n2) EQS (paid)<ref>http://www.mvsoft.com/eqs60.htm</ref>: This SEM software has a function to calculate reliability coefficients.\n\n3) RelCalc (free)<ref name = Cho/>: Available with Microsoft Excel. <Math>\\rho_C</math> can be obtained without the need for SEM software. Various multidimensional SEM reliability coefficients and various types of <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> can be calculated based on the results of SEM software.\n\n==Derivation of formula<ref name=Cho/>==\nAssumption 1. The observed score of an item consists of the true score of the item and the error of the item, which is independent of the true score. <math>X_i=T_i+e_i</math>\n\nLemma. <math>Cov(T_i,e_i)=Cov(T_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 2. Errors are independent of each other. <math>Cov(e_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 3. (The assumption of being essentially tau-equivalent) The true score of an item consists of the true score common to all items and the constant of the item. <math>T_i=\\mu_i + t</math>\n\nLet <math>T</math> denote the sum of the item true scores. <math>T=\\sum_{i=1}^k T_i</math>\n\nThe variance of <math>T</math> is called the true score variance.\n\nDefinition. Reliability is the ratio of true score variance to observed score variance. <math>\\rho={\\sigma^2_T \\over \\sigma^2_X}</math>\n\nThe following relationship is established from the above assumptions.\n\n<math>\\sigma^2_i=Var(\\mu_i + t+e_i)=\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_i} (\\because Var(\\mu_i)=Cov(t,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,t)=0)</math>\n\n<math>\\sigma_{ij}=Cov(T_i+e_i, T_j+e_j)=\\sigma^2_t (\\because Cov(T_i,e_j)=Cov(T_j,e_i)=Cov(e_i,e_j)=0)</math>\n\nTherefore, the covariance matrix between items is as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>\\ldots</math>\n! <math>X_k</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_1}</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>||<math>\\ldots</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_2}</math>|| <math>\\ldots</math>|| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>\\vdots</math>\n| <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\ddots</math>|| <math>\\vdots</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_k</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\ldots</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_k}</math>\n|-\n\n|}\nYou can see that <math> \\sigma^2_t</math> equals the mean of the covariances between items. That is, <math>\\sigma^2_t=\\overline{\\sigma_{ij}}</math>\n\n<math>\\sigma^2_T=Var(\\sum_{i=1}^k t)=k^2 \\sigma^2_t = k^2 \\overline{\\sigma_{ij}} </math>\n\nLet <math> \\rho_T </math> denote the reliability when satisfying the above assumptions. <math> \\rho_T</math> is:\n\n</br><math>\\rho_T = {k^2 \\overline{\\sigma_{ij}} \\over \\sigma^2_X} </math>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.open.ac.uk/socialsciences/spsstutorial/files/tutorials/cronbachs-alpha.pdf Cronbach's alpha SPSS tutorial]\n* The free web interface and R package cocron [http://comparingcronbachalphas.org] allows to statistically compare two or more dependent or independent cronbach alpha coefficients.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cronbach's Alpha}}\n[[Category:Comparison of assessments]]\n[[Category:Psychometrics]]\n[[Category:Educational psychology research methods]]\n", "name_user": "Eunscho", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe value of tau-equivalent reliability ranges between zero and one", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronbach%27s_alpha"}

She is chiefly noted as one of the early leaders of the Women's Police Volunteers. Allen repeatedly sought to challenge or modernise existing systems around her: ensuring the Women's Police Service could become an auxiliary force after women were admitted into certain British police forces, standing once for the [[House of Commons]] as an Independent Liberal, turning over her Women's Auxiliary Service to breaking the [[General Strike of 1926]] then until wartime restrictions meeting and talking with European fascists and anti-communist brigades, entailing frequent trips abroad, publicly joining the [[British Union of Fascists]] in 1939. In retirement Allen was an activist for [[animal rights]].\n\n==Early years==\nAllen was born to a well-to-do family in [[Cardiff]] in 1878, one of the ten children of Thomas Isaac Allen, Chief Superintendent of the [[Great Western Railway]].  Mary was close to her sisters, all of whom had a tendency to [[religious mysticism]].  She was educated at home and later at [[Princess Helena College]].\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Mary Sophia Allen, 1878\u20131964|url=http://www.hastingspress.co.uk/history/maryallen.htm|publisher=Hastings Press|accessdate=2 January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410030459/http://www.hastingspress.co.uk/history/maryallen.htm|archivedate=10 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> She left home at the age of thirty in 1908 after a disagreement with her father about women's suffrage (not going back home until he died in December 1911).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAllen  joined [[Emmeline Pankhurst]]'s [[Women's Social and Political Union]], becoming an organiser in the South West, and later in [[Edinburgh]].

Allen turned down an offer of work with a needlework guild (see for example [[Queen Mother's Clothing Guild]]) and looked around for a more active occupation.  She heard that a number of women were trying to set up a women's police force and, in 1914, she joined [[Nina Boyle]]'s [[Women Police Volunteers]]. This was taken over by [[Margaret Damer Dawson]] in 1915 and renamed the Women Police Service (WPS), with Allen as second-in-command.  They designed their own uniform and opened training schools in London and [[Bristol]].  They saw their role as mainly dealing with women and children and rescuing women from \"vice\" (prostitution) and '[[sexual slavery|white slavery]]'.  Allen served at [[Grantham]] and [[Kingston upon Hull]], overseeing the morals of women in the vicinity of army barracks.  She went on to police munitions factories which employed large numbers of women.  She also worked in London, where 'khaki fever' was perceived as a problem.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Woolacoot|first=Angela|title='Khaki Fever' and its Control|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=29|issue=2|pages=325\u2013347|publisher=SAGE|date=Apr 1994|jstor=260893|doi=10.1177/002200949402900206}}</ref> [[Child welfare]] work led the WPS to set up a benevolent department and a [[home for mothers and babies]].  Allen was awarded the [[OBE]] for services during the War.<ref name=ox/>\n\n[[File:Women at work during the First World War Q108495.jpg|thumb|upright|300px|<center>Mary Sophia Allen (right) and Margaret Damer Dawson, World War I</center>]]\n\nAllen and Margaret Damer Dawson [[Crop (hairstyle)|cropped their hair]] and assumed a severe military appearance, and Allen wore her police uniform in public for the rest of her life.  In 1915 Dawson made a [[Will (law)|will]] which left everything to Allen; when Dawson died unexpectedly in 1920, Allen assumed the role of WPS Commandant.<ref>Hastings Press biography states that Allen became Commandant when Dawson retired in 1919; it also states that Dawson died in 1921</ref> After the War, the WPS was expected to disband: the authorities saw no further need of that organisation.  The [[Metropolitan Police]] (the Met) set up its own women's division and accused the WPS of masquerading as Metropolitan policewomen. Allen was even arrested in 1921 for wearing a Metropolitan Police uniform before it was decided that her activities, which included producing dossiers on left-wing activists, were harmless and she should be allowed to continue wearing it.<ref name=\"Pugh102\">Martin Pugh, \"Hurrah For the Blackshirts!\" Fascists and Fascism in Britain Between the War, Pimlico, 2006, p. 102</ref>\n\nThe WPS changed their name to the Women's Auxiliary Service (WAS) and, with minor modifications to their uniform, carried on as before, setting up a further training school in Edinburgh.  The Government appointed the Baird Committee to investigate the activities of the WAS.  Despite no longer being recognised by the authorities, Allen was invited by the Government to travel to Germany and advise on the policing of the [[British Army of the Rhine]].  This semi-acceptance encouraged her to represent herself overseas as chief of the British women police.  She travelled in uniform and was welcomed by police authorities in Europe and in South and North America.\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:1922 Mary Allen.jpg|thumb|right|Mary Allen]]\nIn November 1922 Allen stood unsuccessfully for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] as a candidate for [[Westminster St George's (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster St George's]]. During the [[General Strike of 1926]] Allen was involved with the [[Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies]] and turned her Women's Auxiliary Service over to the strike-breaking movement.<ref name=\"Pugh102\"/>\n\nAllen [[Aviator|learned to fly]].  She attended international police congresses in Austria and Germany.  She also visited the Netherlands, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Turkey and Brazil, advising on the training of police women.  She travelled to Egypt in 1936 on holiday (wearing her uniform), but was received as if sent by the police authorities in Britain.  Her interest in combatting prostitution continued to be a preoccupation, and she attended the [[League of Nations]] conference in [[Geneva]] on the [[Human trafficking|traffic in women]].  Wherever she went, she was perceived by many as the leading British policewoman. She did nothing to discourage the impression, and made contact with police chiefs and political leaders all over Europe.\n\nThe [[Home Office]] began to take an interest in Allen's activities in 1927. She was becoming an embarrassment and a nuisance to the Government, partly because of her acceptance abroad as representing the British authorities, and partly because she was mistaken for a Metropolitan police officer at home.  Home Office records covering the period 1927\u20131934 reveal that she kept dossiers on people she suspected of activities connected with vice and white slavery.  She was also suspected of [[Fascism|fascist activities]], and articles by or about her in national newspapers increased the Home Office surveillance.\n\nAllen met a number of fascist leaders abroad, including [[Eoin O'Duffy]] in Ireland, [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] in Spain, [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] in Italy, and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring|G\u00f6ring]] in Germany.  Although her links to [[Oswald Mosley]]'s [[British Union of Fascists]] were unofficial until 1939, she engaged in various militant activities, including the formation of the Women's Reserve in 1933, which was intended to serve the country in the event of subversive forces taking over. The publicity for the Women's Reserve reveals her fascist sympathies, and her [[anti-communism|fear of communism]].\n\nShe met Hitler in 1934 and discussed women police with him.  She was captivated by Hitler and expressed her admiration for him in public.  Once she had joined the British Union of Fascists, she wrote numerous articles for its newspapers and openly declared herself to be a fascist.  A Suspension Order under the [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914]] was made against her when suspicions arose about her contacts with Germany.  Her home was searched, and internment was considered, but not implemented.  She was suspected of making flights to Germany, and acting as a spy for the [[Nazism|Nazis]], but this was never proved.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] Allen joined the [[Women's Voluntary Service]] but also became a regular speaker at BUF peace rallies. Outrage followed with ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'', ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and ''[[News Chronicle]]'' stories calling for Allen's removal from the WVS, particularly after comments in which she refused to condemn Hitler were published.<ref>Pugh, ''\"Hurrah For the Blackshirts!\"'', p. 297</ref> Due to her close connections to Mosley and [[Barry Domvile]], [[Special Branch]] regarded Allen with some suspicion. There were also questions in the House of Commons from the Labour MP [[Glenvil Hall]] in June 1940 as to whether Allen's continued nominal presence on the Advisory Council of the [[Women's Voluntary Service]] represented a security risk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1940/jun/27/womens-auxiliary-service-miss-mary-allen|title=WOMEN'S AUXILIARY SERVICE (MISS MARY ALLEN) - House of Commons debate, 27 June 1940 (Hansard, volume 362, cc583-4)}}</ref>  After a review of her activities and a study of her personality and associates, the government declined to detain her under [[Defence Regulation 18B]]. The final report was dismissive, describing her as a \"crank...trailing round in a ridiculous uniform\".<ref>Pugh, ''\"Hurrah For the Blackshirts!\"'', p. 305</ref> Eventually however she was placed under a lesser form of detention as a precaution, being restricted to within a five-mile radius of her [[Cornwall]] home and banned from using cars, bicycles, telephones and the wireless.<ref>Pugh, ''\"Hurrah For the Blackshirts!\"'', p. 306</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nAllen was known as 'Robert' by her close circle of female friends, and she was called 'Sir' by her officers.  Her friends included Margaret Damer Dawson, [[Isobel Goldingham]] and [[Helen Bourn Tagart]], all of whom she met in her policing days.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} She wrote three volumes of autobiography: ''The Pioneer Policewoman'' (1925), ''A Woman at the Cross Roads'' (1934), and ''Lady in Blue'' (1936).  ''A Woman at the Cross Roads'' reveals aspects of her life and philosophy but is reticent about her private life.  It was written at the time when Allen met Hitler, and her political views are made plain: she was at a crossroads in her life because she was looking at fascism as a solution to the world problems that she perceived.  She also wrote numerous articles for newspapers and magazines, and founded ''The Policewomen\u2019s Review'', which ran from 1927 to 1937, to which she was a major contributor.\n\nFew details of Allen's personal life are available after the [[Second World War]].  She continued to be associated with Mosley and other fascists, including [[Norah Elam]] with whom she had shared a lifelong friendship.  Both had been members of the WSPU, and as militant suffragettes had undergone force feeding.  They both turned to [[animal rights|animal activism]] after the demise of the Mosley movement, being staunch anti-vivisectionists and members of the London and Provincial [[Anti-Vivisection Society]].<ref name='McPherson & McPherson'>{{cite book|last=McPherson |first=Angela |author2=McPherson, Susan |title=Mosley's Old Suffragette \u2013 A Biography of Norah Elam |year=2011 |url=http://www.oldsuffragette.co.uk |isbn=978-1-4466-9967-6 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113154415/http://www.oldsuffragette.co.uk/ |archivedate=13 January 2012 }}</ref> She always had a strong interest in religion, without any particular affiliation.

She was educated at home and later at [[Princess Helena College]].\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Mary Sophia Allen, 1878\u20131964|url=http://www.hastingspress.co.uk/history/maryallen.htm|publisher=Hastings Press|accessdate=2 January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410030459/http://www.hastingspress.co.uk/history/maryallen.htm|archivedate=10 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> She left home at the age of thirty in 1908 after a disagreement with her father about women's suffrage (not going back home until he died in December 1911).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAllen  joined [[Emmeline Pankhurst]]'s [[Women's Social and Political Union]], becoming an organiser in the South West, and later in [[Edinburgh]].

Allen turned down an offer of work with a needlework guild (see for example [[Queen Mother's Clothing Guild]]) and looked around for a more active occupation.  She heard that a number of women were trying to set up a women's police force and, in 1914, she joined [[Nina Boyle]]'s [[Women Police Volunteers]]. This was taken over by [[Margaret Damer Dawson]] in 1915 and renamed the Women Police Service (WPS), with Allen as second-in-command.  They designed their own uniform and opened training schools in London and [[Bristol]].  They saw their role as mainly dealing with women and children and rescuing women from \"vice\" (prostitution) and '[[sexual slavery|white slavery]]'.  Allen served at [[Grantham]] and [[Kingston upon Hull]], overseeing the morals of women in the vicinity of army barracks.  She went on to police munitions factories which employed large numbers of women.  She also worked in London, where 'khaki fever' was perceived as a problem.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Woolacoot|first=Angela|title='Khaki Fever' and its Control|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=29|issue=2|pages=325\u2013347|publisher=SAGE|date=Apr 1994|jstor=260893|doi=10.1177/002200949402900206}}</ref> [[Child welfare]] work led the WPS to set up a benevolent department and a [[home for mothers and babies]].  Allen was awarded the [[OBE]] for services during the War.<ref name=ox/>\n\n[[File:Women at work during the First World War Q108495.jpg|thumb|upright|300px|<center>Mary Sophia Allen (right) and Margaret Damer Dawson, World War I</center>]]\n\nAllen and Margaret Damer Dawson [[Crop (hairstyle)|cropped their hair]] and assumed a severe military appearance, and Allen wore her police uniform in public for the rest of her life.  In 1915 Dawson made a [[Will (law)|will]] which left everything to Allen; when Dawson died unexpectedly in 1920, Allen assumed the role of WPS Commandant.<ref>Hastings Press biography states that Allen became Commandant when Dawson retired in 1919; it also states that Dawson died in 1921</ref> After the War, the WPS was expected to disband: the authorities saw no further need of that organisation.  The [[Metropolitan Police]] (the Met) set up its own women's division and accused the WPS of masquerading as Metropolitan policewomen. Allen was even arrested in 1921 for wearing a Metropolitan Police uniform before it was decided that her activities, which included producing dossiers on left-wing activists, were harmless and she should be allowed to continue wearing it.<ref name=\"Pugh102\">Martin Pugh, \"Hurrah For the Blackshirts!\" Fascists and Fascism in Britain Between the War, Pimlico, 2006, p. 102</ref>\n\nThe WPS changed their name to the Women's Auxiliary Service (WAS) and, with minor modifications to their uniform, carried on as before, setting up a further training school in Edinburgh.  The Government appointed the Baird Committee to investigate the activities of the WAS.  Despite no longer being recognised by the authorities, Allen was invited by the Government to travel to Germany and advise on the policing of the [[British Army of the Rhine]].  This semi-acceptance encouraged her to represent herself overseas as chief of the British women police.  She travelled in uniform and was welcomed by police authorities in Europe and in South and North America.\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:1922 Mary Allen.jpg|thumb|right|Mary Allen]]\nIn November 1922 Allen stood unsuccessfully for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] as a candidate for [[Westminster St George's (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster St George's]]. During the [[General Strike of 1926]] Allen was involved with the [[Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies]] and turned her Women's Auxiliary Service over to the strike-breaking movement.<ref name=\"Pugh102\"/>\n\nAllen [[Aviator|learned to fly]].  She attended international police congresses in Austria and Germany.  She also visited the Netherlands, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Turkey and Brazil, advising on the training of police women.  She travelled to Egypt in 1936 on holiday (wearing her uniform), but was received as if sent by the police authorities in Britain.  Her interest in combatting prostitution continued to be a preoccupation, and she attended the [[League of Nations]] conference in [[Geneva]] on the [[Human trafficking|traffic in women]].  Wherever she went, she was perceived by many as the leading British policewoman. She did nothing to discourage the impression, and made contact with police chiefs and political leaders all over Europe.\n\nThe [[Home Office]] began to take an interest in Allen's activities in 1927. She was becoming an embarrassment and a nuisance to the Government, partly because of her acceptance abroad as representing the British authorities, and partly because she was mistaken for a Metropolitan police officer at home.  Home Office records covering the period 1927\u20131934 reveal that she kept dossiers on people she suspected of activities connected with vice and white slavery.  She was also suspected of [[Fascism|fascist activities]], and articles by or about her in national newspapers increased the Home Office surveillance.\n\nAllen met a number of fascist leaders abroad, including [[Eoin O'Duffy]] in Ireland, [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] in Spain, [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] in Italy, and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring|G\u00f6ring]] in Germany.  Although her links to [[Oswald Mosley]]'s [[British Union of Fascists]] were unofficial until 1939, she engaged in various militant activities, including the formation of the Women's Reserve in 1933, which was intended to serve the country in the event of subversive forces taking over. The publicity for the Women's Reserve reveals her fascist sympathies, and her [[anti-communism|fear of communism]].\n\nShe met Hitler in 1934 and discussed women police with him.  She was captivated by Hitler and expressed her admiration for him in public.  Once she had joined the British Union of Fascists, she wrote numerous articles for its newspapers and openly declared herself to be a fascist.  A Suspension Order under the [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914]] was made against her when suspicions arose about her contacts with Germany.  Her home was searched, and internment was considered, but not implemented.  She was suspected of making flights to Germany, and acting as a spy for the [[Nazism|Nazis]], but this was never proved.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] Allen joined the [[Women's Voluntary Service]] but also became a regular speaker at BUF peace rallies. Outrage followed with ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'', ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and ''[[News Chronicle]]'' stories calling for Allen's removal from the WVS, particularly after comments in which she refused to condemn Hitler were published.<ref>Pugh, ''\"Hurrah For the Blackshirts!\"'', p. 297</ref> Due to her close connections to Mosley and [[Barry Domvile]], [[Special Branch]] regarded Allen with some suspicion. There were also questions in the House of Commons from the Labour MP [[Glenvil Hall]] in June 1940 as to whether Allen's continued nominal presence on the Advisory Council of the [[Women's Voluntary Service]] represented a security risk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1940/jun/27/womens-auxiliary-service-miss-mary-allen|title=WOMEN'S AUXILIARY SERVICE (MISS MARY ALLEN) - House of Commons debate, 27 June 1940 (Hansard, volume 362, cc583-4)}}</ref>  After a review of her activities and a study of her personality and associates, the government declined to detain her under [[Defence Regulation 18B]]. The final report was dismissive, describing her as a \"crank...trailing round in a ridiculous uniform\".<ref>Pugh, ''\"Hurrah For the Blackshirts!\"'', p. 305</ref> Eventually however she was placed under a lesser form of detention as a precaution, being restricted to within a five-mile radius of her [[Cornwall]] home and banned from using cars, bicycles, telephones and the wireless.<ref>Pugh, ''\"Hurrah For the Blackshirts!\"'', p. 306</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nAllen was known as 'Robert' by her close circle of female friends, and she was called 'Sir' by her officers.  Her friends included Margaret Damer Dawson, [[Isobel Goldingham]] and [[Helen Bourn Tagart]], all of whom she met in her policing days.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} She wrote three volumes of autobiography: ''The Pioneer Policewoman'' (1925), ''A Woman at the Cross Roads'' (1934), and ''Lady in Blue'' (1936).  ''A Woman at the Cross Roads'' reveals aspects of her life and philosophy but is reticent about her private life.  It was written at the time when Allen met Hitler, and her political views are made plain: she was at a crossroads in her life because she was looking at fascism as a solution to the world problems that she perceived.  She also wrote numerous articles for newspapers and magazines, and founded ''The Policewomen\u2019s Review'', which ran from 1927 to 1937, to which she was a major contributor.\n\nFew details of Allen's personal life are available after the [[Second World War]].  She continued to be associated with Mosley and other fascists, including [[Norah Elam]] with whom she had shared a lifelong friendship.  Both had been members of the WSPU, and as militant suffragettes had undergone force feeding.  They both turned to [[animal rights|animal activism]] after the demise of the Mosley movement, being staunch anti-vivisectionists and members of the London and Provincial [[Anti-Vivisection Society]].<ref name='McPherson & McPherson'>{{cite book|last=McPherson |first=Angela |author2=McPherson, Susan |title=Mosley's Old Suffragette \u2013 A Biography of Norah Elam |year=2011 |url=http://www.oldsuffragette.co.uk |isbn=978-1-4466-9967-6 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113154415/http://www.oldsuffragette.co.uk/ |archivedate=13 January 2012 }}</ref> She always had a strong interest in religion, without any particular affiliation.

It is a white [[chalk]] cliff face which opens up into spectacular [[grotto]]s.\n\nThe Rosh HaNikra grottoes are cavernous tunnels formed by sea action on the soft chalk rock. The total length is some 200 meters. They branch off in various directions with some interconnecting segments.

For many years though, the only access to the grottoes was from the sea and the native swimmers and divers were the only ones capable of visiting. The 400 meters long tunnel dug in 1968 between the grottoes and slightly above sea level improved the situation, and soon after a [[Aerial tramway|cable car]] was built to take visitors down from the top of the cliff to the tunnels.<ref>[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/rosh-hanikra  Jewish Virtual Library, ''Rosh Hanikra'']</ref><ref>[http://picclick.ca/Israel-Rosh-Hanikra-Grotto-and-Cable-Car-Brochure-282246349669.html  Israel Rosh Hanikra Grotto and Cable Car Brochure 1970s]</ref> With a 60-degree gradient, this cable car is advertised as the steepest in the world.\n\nA [[kibbutz]], also named [[Rosh HaNikra (kibbutz)|Rosh HaNikra]], is located nearby.

Most such bees are [[honey bee]]s in the genus ''[[Apis (insect)|Apis]]'', but other honey-producing bees such as ''[[Melipona]]'' stingless bees are also kept. A [[beekeeper]] (or apiarist) keeps bees in order to collect their [[honey]] and other products that the hive produce (including [[beeswax]], [[propolis]], [[Pollen|flower pollen]], [[bee pollen]], and [[royal jelly]]), to [[pollination|pollinate]] crops, or to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers.

Beekeeping was also documented by the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] writers [[Virgil]], [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], and [[Columella]].\n\nBeekeeping has also been practiced in [[ancient China]] since antiquity. In the book \"Golden Rules of Business Success\" written by [[Fan Li]] (or Tao Zhu Gong) during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] there are sections describing the art of beekeeping, stressing the importance of the quality of the wooden box used and how this can affect the quality of the honey. The Chinese word for honey ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u871c}}}} ''m\u00ec'', reconstructed [[Old Chinese]] pronunciation {{IPA|*mjit}}) was borrowed from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[proto-Tocharian language]], the source of \"honey\", from proto-Tocharian *''\u1e3f\u0259t(\u0259)'' (where *''\u1e3f'' is [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]]; cf.

Preeminent among these scientific pioneers were [[Swammerdam]], [[Ren\u00e9 Antoine Ferchault de R\u00e9aumur]], [[Charles Bonnet]], and [[Fran\u00e7ois Huber]]. Swammerdam and R\u00e9aumur were among the first to use a microscope and dissection to understand the internal biology of honey bees. R\u00e9aumur was among the first to construct a glass walled observation hive to better observe activities within hives. He observed queens laying eggs in open cells, but still had no idea of how a queen was fertilized; nobody had ever witnessed the mating of a queen and drone and many theories held that queens were \"[[parthenogenesis|self-fertile]],\" while others believed that a vapor or \"miasma\" emanating from the drones fertilized queens without direct physical contact. Huber was the first to prove by observation and experiment that queens are physically inseminated by drones outside the confines of hives, usually a great distance away.\n\nFollowing R\u00e9aumur's design, Huber built improved glass-walled observation hives and sectional hives that could be opened like the leaves of a book. This allowed inspecting individual wax combs and greatly improved direct observation of hive activity. Although he went blind before he was twenty, Huber employed a secretary, Fran\u00e7ois Burnens, to make daily observations, conduct careful experiments, and keep accurate notes over more than twenty years. Huber confirmed that a hive consists of one queen who is the mother of all the female workers and male drones in the colony. He was also the first to confirm that mating with drones takes place outside of hives and that queens are inseminated by a number of successive matings with male drones, high in the air at a great distance from their hive. Together, he and Burnens dissected bees under the [[microscope]] and were among the first to describe the [[ovary|ovaries]] and [[spermatheca]], or sperm store, of queens as well as the [[penis]] of male drones. Huber is universally regarded as \"the father of modern bee-science\" and his \"Nouvelles Observations sur Les Abeilles (or \"New Observations on Bees\") <ref name=\"Huber1814\">{{cite book|author=Fran\u00e7ois Huber|title=Nouvelles observations sur les abeilles|url=https://archive.org/details/nouvellesobserv00hubegoog|accessdate=27 March 2014|year=1814|publisher=Chez J.

The wild hive was crudely broken into, using smoke to suppress the bees, the [[honeycomb]]s were torn out and smashed up&nbsp;\u2014 along with the eggs, larvae and honey they contained. The liquid honey from the destroyed brood nest was strained through a sieve or basket. This was destructive and unhygienic, but for [[hunter-gatherer]] societies this did not matter, since the honey was generally consumed immediately and there were always more wild colonies to exploit. But in settled societies the destruction of the bee colony meant the loss of a valuable resource; this drawback made beekeeping both inefficient and something of a \"stop and start\" activity. There could be no continuity of production and no possibility of selective breeding, since each bee colony was destroyed at harvest time, along with its precious queen.\n\nDuring the medieval period [[abbey]]s and [[monastery|monasteries]] were centers of beekeeping, since beeswax was highly prized for candles and fermented honey was used to make alcoholic [[mead]] in areas of Europe where vines would not grow. The 18th and 19th centuries saw successive stages of a revolution in beekeeping, which allowed the bees themselves to be preserved when taking the harvest.\n\nIntermediate stages in the transition from the old beekeeping to the new were recorded for example by Thomas Wildman in 1768/1770, who described advances over the destructive old skep-based beekeeping so that the bees no longer had to be killed to harvest the honey.<ref>Thomas Wildman, ''A Treatise on the Management of Bees'' (London, 1768, 2nd edn 1770).</ref> Wildman for example fixed a parallel array of wooden bars across the top of a straw hive or skep (with a separate straw top to be fixed on later) \"so that there are in all seven bars of deal\" [in a {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} hive] \"to which the bees fix their combs\".<ref>Wildman, op.cit., 2nd (1770) ed., at pp.94\u201395.</ref> He also described using such hives in a multi-storey configuration, foreshadowing the modern use of supers:  he described adding (at a proper time) successive straw hives below, and eventually removing the ones above when free of brood and filled with honey, so that the bees could be separately preserved at the harvest for a following season.  Wildman also described<ref>Wildman, op.cit., 2nd (1770) ed., at pp.112\u2013115.</ref> a further development, using hives with \"sliding frames\" for the bees to build their comb, foreshadowing more modern uses of movable-comb hives.  Wildman's book acknowledged the advances in knowledge of bees previously made by Swammerdam, Maraldi, and de R\u00e9aumur\u2014he included a lengthy translation of R\u00e9aumur's account of the natural history of bees\u2014and he also described the initiatives of others in designing hives for the preservation of bee-life when taking the harvest, citing in particular reports from Brittany dating from the 1750s, due to Comte de la Bourdonnaye.\nHowever, the forerunners of the modern hives with movable frames that are mainly used today are considered the traditional basket top bar (movable comb) hives of Greece, known as \u201cGreek beehives\u201d. The oldest testimony on their use dates back to 1669 although it is probable that their use is more than 3000 years old.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/1929792 |title=A 17th Century Testimony On The Use Of Ceramic Top-bar Hives. 2012 &#124; Haralampos (\u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2) Harissis (\u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2) and Georgios Mavrofridis |journal=Bee World |year=2012 |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=56\u201358 |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2016-03-12|last1=Harissis (\u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2) |first1=Haralampos (\u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2) |last2=Mavrofridis |first2=Georgios |doi=10.1080/0005772X.2012.11417481 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lorenzo Langstroth.jpg|left|thumb|[[Lorenzo Langstroth]]<br/>(1810\u20131895)]]\nThe 19th century saw this revolution in beekeeping practice completed through the perfection of the movable comb hive by the American [[Lorenzo Langstroth|Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth]]. Langstroth was the first person to make practical use of Huber's earlier discovery that there was a specific spatial measurement between the wax combs, later called ''the bee space'', which bees do not block with wax, but keep as a free passage. Having determined this bee space (between 5 and 8&nbsp;mm, or 1/4 to 3/8\"), Langstroth then designed a series of wooden frames within a rectangular hive box, carefully maintaining the correct space between successive frames, and found that the bees would build parallel honeycombs in the box without bonding them to each other or to the hive walls. This enables the beekeeper to slide any frame out of the hive for inspection, without harming the bees or the comb, protecting the eggs, larvae and pupae contained within the cells. It also meant that combs containing honey could be gently removed and the honey extracted without destroying the comb. The emptied honey combs could then be returned to the bees intact for refilling.  Langstroth's book, ''The Hive and Honey-bee'', published in 1853, described his rediscovery of the bee space and the development of his patent movable comb hive.\n\nThe invention and development of the movable-comb-hive fostered the growth of commercial honey production on a large scale in both Europe and the US (see also [[Beekeeping in the United States]]).\n\n=== Evolution of hive designs ===\n[[File:Bees at the hive entrance.JPG|thumb|Bees at the hive entrance]]\n\nLangstroth's design for movable comb hives was seized upon by apiarists and inventors on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and a wide range of moveable comb hives were designed and perfected in [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United States]]. Classic designs evolved in each country: [[Charles Dadant|Dadant]] hives and [[Langstroth hive]]s are still dominant in the US; in France the [[Georges de Layens|De-Layens]] trough-hive became popular and in the UK a British National hive became standard as late as the 1930s although in Scotland the smaller Smith hive is still popular. In some Scandinavian countries and in Russia the traditional trough hive persisted until late in the 20th century and is still kept in some areas. However, the Langstroth and Dadant designs remain ubiquitous in the US and also in many parts of Europe, though [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], Germany, France and [[Italy]] all have their own national hive designs. Regional variations of hive evolved to reflect the climate, floral productivity and the reproductive characteristics of the various subspecies of native honey bee in each bio-region.\n\n[[File:\u0421\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0451\u0434.jpg|thumb|Honey-laden honeycomb in a wooden frame]]\n\nThe differences in hive dimensions are insignificant in comparison to the common factors in all these hives: they are all square or rectangular; they all use movable wooden frames; they all consist of a floor, brood-box, [[honey super]], crown-board and roof. Hives have traditionally been constructed of [[Cedrus|cedar]], pine, or [[cypress]] wood, but in recent years hives made from injection molded dense [[polystyrene]] have become increasingly important.\n\nHives also use queen excluders between the brood-box and honey supers to keep the queen from laying eggs in cells next to those containing honey intended for consumption. Also, with the advent in the 20th century of mite pests, hive floors are often replaced for part of (or the whole) year with a wire mesh and removable tray.\n\n[[File:Flow hive 2 with honey jars.jpg|thumb|Flow Hive 2 with honey pouring into jars]]\n\nIn 2015 the [[Flow Hive]] system was invented in Australia by Cedar Anderson and his father Stuart Anderson<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-12/australian-story-flow-hive-family-talks-about-life-now/7828436 |title=Flow Hive: Cedar and Stuart Anderson talk about life one year after crowdfunding success |last=Hassall |first=Craig |location=[[ABC Online]] |date=12 September 2017}}</ref>, allowing honey to be extracted without expensive centrifuge equipment.\n\n=== Pioneers of practical and commercial beekeeping ===\nThe 19th century produced an explosion of innovators and inventors who perfected the design and production of beehives, systems of management and husbandry, stock improvement by [[selective breeding]], [[honey extraction]] and marketing. Preeminent among these innovators were:\n\n[[Petro Prokopovych]] used frames with channels in the side of the woodwork; these were packed side by side in boxes that were stacked one on top of the other. The bees traveled from frame to frame and box to box via the channels. The channels were similar to the cut outs in the sides of modern wooden sections<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dave-cushman.net/bee/hist.html|title=History of British Standards in Beekeeping|author=Dave Cushman|work=dave-cushman.net}}</ref> (1814).\n\n[[Jan Dzier\u017con]] was the father of modern apiology and apiculture. All modern beehives are descendants of his design.\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois Huber]] made significant discoveries regarding the bee life-cycle and communication between bees. Despite being blind, Huber brought to light a large amount of information regarding the queen bee's mating habits and her communication with the rest of the hive. His work was published as ''New Observations on the Natural History of Bees''.\n\n[[L. L. Langstroth]] revered as the \"father of American apiculture\"; no other individual has influenced modern beekeeping practice more than Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth. His classic book ''The Hive and Honey-bee'' was published in 1853.\n\n[[Moses Quinby]] often termed \"the father of commercial beekeeping in the United States\", author of ''Mysteries of Bee-Keeping Explained''. He invented the [[Bee smoker]] in 1873.<ref>Bee Culture - Moses Quinby - http://www.beeculture.com/moses-quinby/</ref><ref>Thermal Beekeeping: Look Inside a Burning Bee Smoker - https://americanbeejournal.com/thermal-beekeeping-look-inside-a-burning-bee-smoker/</ref>\n\n[[Amos Root]] author of the ''A B C of Bee Culture'', which has been continuously revised and remains in print. Root pioneered the manufacture of hives and the distribution of bee-packages in the United States.\n\n[[A. J. Cook (beekeeper)|A. J. Cook]] author of ''The Bee-Keepers' Guide; or Manual of the Apiary'', 1876.\n\n[[Dr. C.C. Miller]] was one of the first entrepreneurs to actually make a living from apiculture. By 1878 he made beekeeping his sole business activity. His book, ''Fifty Years Among the Bees'', remains a classic and his influence on bee management persists to this day.\n\n[[File:Honigschleuder.jpg|thumb|Honey Extractor]]\n\n[[Franz Hruschka]] was an Italian military officer who made one crucial invention that catalyzed the commercial honey industry. In 1865 he invented a simple machine for extracting honey from the comb by means of centrifugal force. His original idea was simply to support combs in a metal framework and then spin them around within a container to collect honey as it was thrown out by centrifugal force. This meant that honeycombs could be returned to a hive undamaged but empty, saving the bees a vast amount of work, time, and materials. This single invention greatly improved the efficiency of honey harvesting and catalysed the modern honey industry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Birth of American Bee Culture : A Look at Advertisements in A.J.

Kelley]] was an American pioneer of modern beekeeping in the early and mid-20th century.  He greatly improved upon beekeeping equipment and clothing and went on to manufacture these items as well as other equipment.  His company sold via catalog worldwide and his book, ''How to Keep Bees & Sell Honey'', an introductory book of apiculture and marketing, allowed for a boom in beekeeping following [[World War II]].\n\nIn the U.K. practical beekeeping was led in the early 20th century by a few men, pre-eminently [[Brother Adam]] and his [[Buckfast bee]] and [[R.O.B. Manley]], author of many titles, including ''Honey Production in the British Isles'' and inventor of the Manley frame, still universally popular in the U.K. Other notable British pioneers include William Herrod-Hempsall and Gale.\n\nDr. [[Ahmed Zaky Abushady]] (1892\u20131955), was an Egyptian poet, medical doctor, bacteriologist and bee scientist who was active in England and in Egypt in the early part of the twentieth century. In 1919, Abushady patented a removable, standardized aluminum honeycomb. In 1919 he also founded The Apis Club in [[Benson, Oxfordshire|Benson]], Oxfordshire, and its periodical Bee World, which was to be edited by [[Annie D. Betts]] and later by Dr. [[Eva Crane]]. The Apis Club was transitioned to the [[International Bee Research Association]] (IBRA). Its archives are held in the [[National Library of Wales]]. In Egypt in the 1930s, Abushady established The Bee Kingdom League and its organ, The Bee Kingdom.\n\nIn India, R. N. Mattoo was the pioneer worker  in starting beekeeping with Indian honeybee, (''Apis cerana indica'') in the early 1930s. Beekeeping with European honeybee, (''Apis mellifera'') was started by Dr. A. S. Atwal and his team members,  O. P. Sharma and  N. P. Goyal in Punjab in the early 1960s. It remained confined to Punjab and Himachal Pradesh up to the late 1970s. Later on in 1982,  Dr. R. C. Sihag, working at Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar (Haryana), introduced and established this honeybee in Haryana and standardized its management practices for semi-arid-subtropical climates. On the basis of these practices, beekeeping with this honeybee could be extended to the rest of the country. Now beekeeping with ''Apis mellifera'' predominates in India.\n\n== Traditional beekeeping ==\n[[File:Lithuanian Museum of Ancient Beekeeping.jpg|thumb|right|Wooden hives in [[Stripeikiai]] honeymaking museum, Lithuania]]\n[[File:Beekeeping at Kawah Ijen, Indonesia.jpg|thumb|Beekeeping at Kawah [[Ijen]] Mountain, [[Indonesia]]]]\n\n=== Fixed comb hives ===\nA fixed comb hive is a hive in which the combs cannot be removed or manipulated for management or harvesting without permanently damaging the comb.  Almost any hollow structure can be used for this purpose, such as a [[log gum]], [[skep]], wooden box, or a clay pot or tube.  Fixed comb hives are no longer in common use in industrialized countries, and are illegal in places that require movable combs to inspect for problems such as [[varroa]] and [[American foulbrood]].\nIn many developing countries fixed comb hives are widely used and, because they can be made from any locally available material .\n\nBeekeeping using fixed comb hives is an essential part of the livelihoods of many communities in poor countries. The charity [[Bees for Development]] recognizes that local skills to manage bees in fixed comb hives<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beesfordevelopment.org/portal/topic.php?id=15&p=101  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518171416/http://beesfordevelopment.org/portal/topic.php?id=15&p=101 |archivedate=2011-05-18 |title=Fixed combs}}</ref> are widespread in Africa, Asia, and South America.  Internal size of fixed comb hives range from 32.7 liters (2000 cubic inches) typical of the clay tube hives used in Egypt to 282 liters (17209 cubic inches) for the Perone hive.  Straw [[skep]]s, bee gums, and unframed box hives are unlawful in most US states, as the comb and brood cannot be inspected for diseases. However, skeps are still used for collecting swarms by hobbyists in the UK, before moving them into standard hives.  [[Moses Quinby|Quinby]] used box hives to produce so much honey that he saturated the New York market in the 1860s.  His writings contain excellent advice for management of bees in fixed comb hives.\n\n== Modern beekeeping ==\n\n=== Topbar hives ===\n{{Main|Top-bar hive}}\nTop bar hives have been widely adopted in Africa where they are used to keep tropical honeybee ecotypes.  Their advantages include being light weight, adaptable, easy to harvest honey, and less stressful for the bees. Disadvantages include combs that are fragile and cannot usually be extracted and returned to the bees to be refilled and that they cannot easily be expanded for additional honey storage.\n\nA growing number of amateur beekeepers are adopting various [[top-bar hive]]s similar to the type commonly found in Africa. Top bar hives were originally used as a traditional beekeeping method in Greece and Vietnam with a history dating back over 2000 years.<ref name=\"Honey Hunting' 1999\" /> These hives have no frames and the honey-filled comb is not returned after extraction. Because of this, the production of honey is likely to be somewhat less than that of a frame and super based hive such as Langstroth or Dadant. Top bar hives are mostly kept by people who are more interested in having bees in their garden than in honey production per se.  Some of the most well known top-bar hive designs are the Kenyan Top Bar Hive with sloping sides, the Tanzanian Top Bar Hive with straight sides, and Vertical Top Bar Hives, such as the Warre or \"People's Hive\" designed by Abbe Warre in the mid-1900s.\n\nThe initial costs and equipment requirements are typically much less than other hive designs. Scrap wood or #2 or #3 pine can often be used to build a nice hive. Top-bar hives also offer some advantages to interacting with the bees and the amount of weight that must be lifted is greatly reduced. Top-bar hives are being widely used in developing countries in Africa and Asia as a result of the [[Bees for Development]] program. Since 2011, a growing number of beekeepers in the U.S. are using various top-bar hives.<ref>{{cite web| last =Gregory | first=Pam | title=Better beekeeping in top-bar hives | publisher =Bees For Development | url=http://www.beesfordevelopment.org/info/info/topbar/better-beekeeping-in-topb-2.shtml | accessdate=2008-03-12 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321135910/http://www.beesfordevelopment.org/info/info/topbar/better-beekeeping-in-topb-2.shtml | archivedate=21 March 2008 | url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Vertical stackable hives ===\nThere are three types of vertical stackable hives:  hanging or top-access frame, sliding or side-access frame, and top bar.\n\nHanging frame hives include [[Langstroth hive|Langstroth]], the British National, Dadant, Layens, and Rose, differing primarily by size or number of frames.  The Langstroth was the first successful top-opened hive with movable frames.  Many other hive designs are based on the principle of bee space first described by [[Lorenzo Langstroth|Langstroth]], and is a descendant of Jan [[Dzierzon]]'s Polish hive designs. Langstroth hives are the most common size in the [[United States]] and much of the world; the British National is the most common size in the [[United Kingdom]]; Dadant and Modified Dadant hives are widely used in France and Italy, and Layens by some beekeepers, where their large size is an advantage.  Square Dadant hives\u2013often called 12 frame Dadant or Brother Adam hives\u2013are used in large parts of Germany and other parts of Europe by commercial beekeepers.\n\nAny hanging frame hive design can be built as a sliding frame design.  The AZ Hive, the original sliding frame design, integrates hives using Langstroth-sized frames into a honey house so as to streamline the workflow of honey harvest by localization of labor, similar to [[cellular manufacturing]].  The honey house can be a portable trailer, allowing the beekeeper to haul the hives to a site and provide pollination services.\n\nTop bar stackable hives simply use top bars instead of full frames.  The most common type is the Warre hive, although any hive with hanging frames can be made into a top bar stackable hive by using only the top bar and not the whole frame.  This may work less-well with larger frames, where crosscomb and attachment can occur more-readily.\n\n=== Protective clothing \nBy ram===\n[[File:Beekeeper keeping bees.jpg|upright|right|Beekeepers often wear protective clothing to protect themselves from stings|thumb]]\n\nMost beekeepers also wear some protective clothing. Novice beekeepers usually wear gloves and a hooded suit or hat and veil. Experienced beekeepers sometimes elect not to use gloves because they inhibit delicate manipulations. The face and neck are the most important areas to protect, so most beekeepers wear at least a veil.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Hive and the honey bee : a new book on beekeeping which continues the tradition of \"Langstroth on the hive and the honeybee\"|date=1992|publisher=Dadant|others=Graham, Joe M., Ambrose, J.

This is because of the natural color of cotton and cost of coloring was an expense not warranted for workwear, though some consider this is to provide better differentiation from the colony's natural predators (such as bears and skunks) which tend to be dark-colored. It is now known that bees see in ultraviolet and are also attracted to scent. So the type of fabric conditioner used has more impact than the color of the fabric.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.ncsu.edu/2011/07/wms-what-bees-see/|title=What Do Bees See?

Washing suits regularly, and rinsing gloved hands in vinegar minimizes attraction.\n\n=== Smoker ===\n{{Main|Bee smoker}}\n\n[[File:Bee smoker.jpg|thumb|Bee smoker with heat shield and hook]]\n\nSmoke is the beekeeper's third line of defense. Most beekeepers use a \"smoker\"\u2014a device designed to generate smoke from the incomplete combustion of various fuels. Smoke calms bees; it initiates a feeding response in anticipation of possible hive abandonment due to fire.<ref>{{cite thesis|last1=Newton|first1=David Comstock|title=Behavioral Response of Honey Bees (Apis Mellifera L., Hymenoptera: Apidae) to Colony Disturbance by Smoke, Acetic Acid, Isopentyl Acetate, Light, Temperature and Vibration|date=March 1967|location=Champaign, IL|publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign|University of Illinois]]|id=Document No. 302256408{{ProQuest|302256408}}|page=3|degree=Ph.D.}}</ref> Smoke also masks alarm pheromones released by guard bees or when bees are squashed in an inspection. The ensuing confusion creates an opportunity for the beekeeper to open the hive and work without triggering a defensive reaction. In addition, when a bee consumes honey the bee's abdomen distends, supposedly making it difficult to make the necessary flexes to sting, though this has not been tested scientifically.\n\nMany types of fuel can be used in a smoker as long as it is natural and not contaminated with harmful substances. These fuels include [[hessian (cloth)|hessian]], [[twine]], [[burlap]], pine needles, corrugated cardboard, and mostly rotten or punky wood. Indian beekeepers, especially in Kerala, often use coconut fibers as they are readily available, safe, and of negligible expense. Some beekeeping supply sources also sell commercial fuels like pulped paper and compressed cotton, or even aerosol cans of smoke. Other beekeepers use [[sumac]] as fuel because it ejects lots of smoke and doesn't have an odor.\n\nSome beekeepers are using \"liquid smoke\" as a safer, more convenient alternative. It is a water-based solution that is sprayed onto the bees from a plastic spray bottle.\n\nTorpor may also be induced by the introduction of chilled air into the hive \u2013 while chilled carbon dioxide may have harmful long-term effects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Gene E.|last2=Visscher|first2=P.

Beekeepers have high levels of antibodies (mainly [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]]) reacting to the major antigen of [[bee venom]], [[phospholipase]] A2 (PLA).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=HELD|first1=W.|last2=STUCKI|first2=M.|last3=HEUSSER|first3=C.|last4=BLASER|first4=K.|title=Production of Human Antibodies to Bee Venom Phospholipase A2 in Vitro|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Immunology|date=February 1989|volume=29|issue=2|pages=203\u2013209|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3083.1989.tb01117.x|pmid=2922572}}</ref> Antibodies correlate with the frequency of bee stings.\n\nThe entry of venom into the body from bee-stings may also be hindered and reduced by protective clothing that allows the wearer to remove stings and venom sacs with a simple tug on the clothing. Although the stinger is barbed, a worker bee is less likely to become lodged into clothing than human skin.\n\nIf a beekeeper is stung by a bee, there are many protective measures that should be taken in order to make sure the affected area does not become too irritated. The first cautionary step that should be taken following a bee sting is removing the stinger without squeezing the attached venom glands. A quick scrape with a fingernail is effective and intuitive. This step is effective in making sure that the venom injected does not spread, so the side effects of the sting will go away sooner. Washing the affected area with soap and water is also a good way to stop the spread of venom. The last step that needs to be taken is to apply ice or a cold compress to the stung area.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Mayo Clinic Staff|title=Bee Stings-Treatments and Drugs|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bee-stings/basics/treatment/con-20034120|website=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Natural beekeeping ===\nThe natural beekeeping movement believes that bee hives are weakened by modern beekeeping and agricultural practices, such as crop spraying, hive movement, frequent hive inspections, [[artificial insemination]] of queens, routine medication, and sugar water feeding.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nPractitioners of \"natural beekeeping\" tend to use variations of the top-bar hive, which is a simple design that retains the concept of having a movable comb without the use of frames or a foundation. The horizontal top-bar hive, as championed by Marty Hardison, Michael Bush, Philip Chandler, Dennis Murrell and others, can be seen as a modernization of hollow log hives, with the addition of wooden bars of specific width from which bees hang their combs. Its widespread adoption in recent years can be attributed to the publication in 2007 of ''The Barefoot Beekeeper<ref>{{cite book|last=Chandler|first=Philip|title=The Barefoot Beekeeper|year=2007|publisher=Lulu|isbn=978-1-4092-7114-7|page=111|url=http://www.biobees.com}}</ref>'' by Philip Chandler, which challenged many aspects of modern beekeeping and offered the horizontal top-bar hive as a viable alternative to the ubiquitous Langstroth-style movable-frame hive.\n\nThe most popular vertical top-bar hive is the Warr\u00e9 hive, based on a design by the French priest Abb\u00e9 \u00c9mile Warr\u00e9 (1867\u20131951) and popularized by Dr. David Heaf in his English translation of Warr\u00e9's book ''L'Apiculture pour Tous'' as ''Beekeeping For All''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://warre.biobees.com/ |title=Beekeeping with the Warr\u00e9 hive \u2013 Home |website=Warre.biobees.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-12}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Honey bee in Toronto.jpg|thumb|Honey bee in Toronto]]\n\n=== Urban or backyard beekeeping ===\n{{Main|Urban beekeeping}}Related to natural beekeeping, [[urban beekeeping]] is an attempt to revert to a less industrialized way of obtaining honey by utilizing small-scale colonies that pollinate [[Urban horticulture|urban gardens]].

This may be done for reasons of space and monitoring, or in the off-season.  In the off-season, large commercial beekeepers may move colonies to \"wintering\" warehouses, with fixed temperature, light and humidity.  This helps the bees remain healthy, but relatively dormant. These relatively dormant or \"wintered\" bees survive on stored honey, and new bees are not born.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bees.techno-science.ca/english/bees/the-beekeeper/winter-techniques.php|title=Wintering Techniques}}</ref>\n\nExperiments in raising bees for longer durations indoors have looked into more detailed and varying environment controls.  In 2015, [[MIT]]'s ''Synthetic Apiary'' project simulated springtime inside a closed environment, for a number of hives over the course of a winter.  They provided food sources and simulated long days, and saw activity and reproduction levels comparable to the levels seen outdoors in warm weather. They concluded that such an indoor apiary could be sustained year-round if needed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.creativeapplications.net/news/synthetic-apiary-biologically-augmented-digital-fabrication/|title=Synthetic Apiary \u2013 Biologically augmented digital fabrication|newspaper=CreativeApplications.Net|access-date=2016-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/mits-mediated-matter-group-builds-a-synthetic-apiary-to-help-save-bees_o |title=MIT's Mediated Matter Group Builds a Synthetic Apiary to Help Save Bees|publisher=Architect Magazine|date=2016-10-17}}</ref>\n\n== Bee colonies ==\n\n=== Species ===\nThere are more than 20,000 species of wild bees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/articles/bee-species-outnumber-mammals-birds.html |title=Bee Species Outnumber Mammals And Birds Combined |publisher=Biology Online |date=2008-06-17 |accessdate=2016-03-12}}</ref> Many species are solitary<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insectpix.net/solitary_bees_gallery.htm |title=Insectpix.net |website=Insectpix.net |date= |accessdate=2016-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225035450/http://www.insectpix.net/solitary_bees_gallery.htm |archive-date=2007-02-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (e.g., [[mason bee]]s, leafcutter bees ([[Megachilidae]]), [[carpenter bees]] and  other ground-nesting bees). Many others rear their young in burrows and small colonies (e.g., [[bumblebee]]s and [[stingless bees]]). Some honey bees are wild e.g. the little honeybee (''[[Apis florea]]''), giant honeybee (''[[Apis dorsata]]'') and rock bee (''[[Apis laboriosa]]''). Beekeeping, or apiculture, is concerned with the practical management of the social species of honey bees, which live in large colonies of up to 100,000 individuals. In [[Europe]] and [[United States|America]] the species universally managed by beekeepers is the [[Western honey bee]] (''Apis mellifera''). This species has several sub-species or regional varieties, such as the [[Italian bee]] (''Apis mellifera ligustica''), [[European dark bee]] (''Apis mellifera mellifera''), and the [[Carniolan honey bee]] (''Apis mellifera carnica''). In the tropics, other species of social bees are managed for honey production, including the Asiatic honey bee (''[[Apis cerana]]'').\n\n=== Castes ===\nA colony of bees consists of three castes of bee:\n*a [[queen bee]], which is normally the only breeding female in the colony;\n*a large number of female [[worker bee]]s, typically 30,000\u201350,000 in number;\n*a number of male [[Drone (bee)|drones]], ranging from thousands in a strong hive in spring to very few during dearth or cold season.\n\n[[File:Bienenkoenigin 43a.jpg|thumb|Queen bee (center)]]\n\nThe queen is the only sexually mature female in the hive and all of the female worker bees and male drones are her offspring. The queen may live for up to three years or more and may be capable of laying half a million eggs or more in her lifetime. At the peak of the breeding season, late spring to summer, a good queen may be capable of laying 3,000 eggs in one day, more than her own body weight. This would be exceptional however; a prolific queen might peak at 2,000 eggs a day, but a more average queen might lay just 1,500 eggs per day. The queen is raised from a normal worker egg, but is fed a larger amount of [[royal jelly]] than a normal worker bee, resulting in a radically different growth and metamorphosis. The queen influences the colony by the production and dissemination of a variety of [[pheromone]]s or \"queen substances\". One of these chemicals suppresses the development of ovaries in all the female worker bees in the hive and prevents them from laying eggs.\n\n==== Mating of queens ====\nThe queen emerges from her cell after 15 days of development and she remains in the hive for 3\u20137 days before venturing out on a mating flight. Mating flight is otherwise known as \"nuptial flight\". Her first orientation flight may only last a few seconds, just enough to mark the position of the hive. Subsequent mating flights may last from 5 minutes to 30 minutes, and she may mate with a number of male drones on each flight. Over several matings, possibly a dozen or more, the queen receives and stores enough [[sperm]] from a succession of drones to fertilize hundreds of thousands of eggs. If she does not manage to leave the hive to mate\u2014possibly due to bad weather or being trapped in part of the hive\u2014she remains infertile and becomes a ''drone layer'', incapable of producing female worker bees. Worker bees sometimes kill a non-performing queen and produce another. Without a properly performing queen, the hive is doomed.\n\nMating takes place at some distance from the hive and often several hundred feet in the air; it is thought that this separates the strongest drones from the weaker ones, ensuring that only the fastest and strongest drones get to pass on their genes.\n\n==== Worker bees ====\n[[File:Apis mellifera carnica worker hive entrance 3.jpg|thumb|Worker bee]]\nMost of the bees in a hive are female worker bees. At the height of summer when activity in the hive is frantic and work goes on non-stop, the life of a worker bee may be as short as 6 weeks; in late autumn, when no brood is being raised and no [[nectar]] is being harvested, a young bee may live for 16 weeks, right through the winter.\n\nOver the course of their lives, worker bees' duties are dictated by age. For the first few weeks of their lifespan, they perform basic chores within the hive: cleaning empty brood cells, removing debris and other housekeeping tasks, making wax for building or repairing comb, and feeding larvae. Later, they may ventilate the hive or guard the entrance. Older workers leave the hive daily, weather permitting, to forage for nectar, pollen, water, and propolis.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Note in the picture that they have much larger eyes than the workers have, presumably to better locate the queen during the mating flight. They do not work, do not forage for pollen or nectar, are unable to sting, and have no other known function than to mate with new queens and fertilize them on their mating flights. A bee colony generally starts to raise drones a few weeks before building queen cells so they can supersede a failing queen or prepare for swarming. When queen-raising for the season is over, bees in colder climates drive drones out of the hive to die, biting and tearing their legs and wings.\n\n=== Differing stages of development ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

If one were to cut a vertical cross-section through the hive from side to side, the brood nest would appear as a roughly ovoid ball spanning 5\u20138 frames of comb. The two outside combs at each side of the hive tend to be exclusively used for long-term storage of honey and pollen.\n\nWithin the central brood nest, a single frame of comb typically has a central disk of eggs, larvae and sealed brood cells that may extend almost to the edges of the frame. Immediately above the brood patch an arch of [[pollen]]-filled cells extends from side to side, and above that again a broader arch of honey-filled cells extends to the frame tops. The pollen is protein-rich food for developing larvae, while honey is also food but largely energy rich rather than protein rich. The nurse bees that care for the developing brood secrete a special food called \"[[royal jelly]]\" after feeding themselves on honey and pollen. The amount of royal jelly fed to a larva determines whether it develops into a worker bee or a queen.\n\nApart from the honey stored within the central brood frames, the bees store surplus honey in combs above the brood nest. In modern hives the beekeeper places separate boxes, called \"supers\", above the brood box, in which a series of shallower combs is provided for storage of honey. This enables the beekeeper to remove some of the supers in the late summer, and to extract the surplus honey harvest, without damaging the colony of bees and its brood nest below. If all the honey is taken, including the amount of honey needed to survive winter, the beekeeper must replace these stores by feeding the bees sugar or [[corn syrup]] in autumn.\n\n=== Annual cycle of a bee colony ===\nThe development of a bee colony follows an annual cycle of growth that begins in spring with a rapid expansion of the brood nest, as soon as pollen is available for feeding larvae. Some production of brood may begin as early as January, even in a cold winter, but breeding accelerates towards a peak in May (in the northern hemisphere), producing an abundance of harvesting bees synchronized to the main [[nectar flow]] in that region. Each race of bees times this build-up slightly differently, depending on how the flora of its original region blooms. Some regions of Europe have two nectar flows: one in late spring and another in late August. Other regions have only a single nectar flow. The skill of the beekeeper lies in predicting when the nectar flow will occur in his area and in trying to ensure that his colonies achieve a maximum population of harvesters at exactly the right time.\n<!-- NOTE: GRAPHIC REQUIRED HERE -->\n\nThe key factor in this is the prevention or skillful management of the swarming impulse. If a colony swarms unexpectedly and the beekeeper does not manage to capture the resulting swarm, he is likely to harvest significantly less honey from that hive, since he has lost half his worker bees at a single stroke. If, however, he can use the swarming impulse to breed a new queen but keep all the bees in the colony together, he maximizes his chances of a good harvest. It takes many years of learning and experience to be able to manage all these aspects successfully, though owing to variable circumstances many beginners often achieve a good honey harvest.\n\n== Formation of new colonies ==\n\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2017}}\n\n=== Colony reproduction: swarming and supersedure ===\n{{Main|Swarming (honey bee)}}\n\n[[File:Essaim d'abeilles en vol (modifi\u00e9e).jpg|thumb|right|A swarm about to land]]\n\nAll colonies are totally dependent on their queen, who is the only egg-layer. However, even the best queens live only a few years and one or two years longevity is the norm. She can choose whether or not to fertilize an egg as she lays it; if she does so, it develops into a female worker bee; if she lays an unfertilized egg it becomes a male drone. She decides which type of egg to lay depending on the size of the open brood cell she encounters on the comb. In a small worker cell, she lays a fertilized egg; if she finds a larger drone cell, she lays an unfertilized drone egg.\n\nAll the time that the queen is fertile and laying eggs she produces a variety of pheromones, which control the behavior of the bees in the hive. These are commonly called ''queen substance'', but there are various pheromones with different functions. As the queen ages, she begins to run out of stored sperm, and her pheromones begin to fail.\n\nInevitably, the queen begins to falter, and the bees decide to replace her by creating a new queen from one of her worker eggs. They may do this because she has been damaged (lost a leg or an antenna), because she has run out of sperm and cannot lay fertilized eggs (has become a \"drone laying queen\"), or because her pheromones have dwindled to where they cannot control all the bees in the hive. At this juncture, the bees produce one or more queen cells by modifying existing worker cells that contain a normal female egg.  They then pursue one of two ways to replace the queen: '''supersedure''', replacing or superseding the queen without swarming, or '''swarm cell production''', dividing the hive into two colonies through swarming.\n\nSupersedure is highly valued as a behavioral trait by beekeepers.  A hive that supersedes its old queen does not lose any stock.  Instead it creates a new queen and the old one fades away or is killed when the new queen emerges.  In these hives, the bees produce just one or two queen cells, characteristically in the center of the face of a broodcomb.\n\nSwarm cell production involves creating many queen cells, typically a dozen or more.  These are located around the edges of a broodcomb, often at the sides and the bottom.\n\n[[File:Honeycomb 20090206 jhansonxi.jpg|thumb|right|New wax combs between basement joists]]\nOnce either process has begun, the old queen leaves the hive with the hatching of the first queen cells. She leaves accompanied by a large number of bees, predominantly young bees (wax-secretors), who form the basis of the new hive. Scouts are sent out from the swarm to find suitable hollow trees or rock crevices. As soon as one is found, the entire swarm moves in. Within a matter of hours, they build new wax brood combs, using honey stores that the young bees have filled themselves with before leaving the old hive. Only young bees can secrete wax from special abdominal segments, and this is why swarms tend to contain more young bees.  Often a number of virgin queens accompany the first swarm (the \"prime swarm\"), and the old queen is replaced as soon as a daughter queen mates and begins laying. Otherwise, she is quickly superseded in the new home.\n\nDifferent sub-species of ''Apis mellifera'' exhibit differing swarming characteristics.  In general the more northerly black races are said to swarm less and supersede more, whereas the more southerly yellow and grey varieties are said to swarm more frequently. The truth is complicated because of the prevalence of cross-breeding and hybridization of the sub species.\n\n=== Factors that trigger swarming ===\nSome beekeepers may monitor their colonies carefully in spring and watch for the appearance of queen cells, which are a dramatic signal that the colony is determined to swarm.\n\n[[File:Essaim d'abeilles pos\u00e9.JPG|thumb|left|A swarm attached to a branch]]\n\nThis swarm looks for shelter. A beekeeper may capture it and introduce it into a new hive, helping meet this need. Otherwise, it returns to a [[feral]] state, in which case it finds shelter in a hollow tree, excavation, abandoned chimney, or even behind shutters.\n\nA small after-swarm has less chance of survival and may threaten the original hive's survival if the number of individuals left is unsustainable. When a hive swarms despite the beekeeper's preventative efforts, a good management practice is to give the reduced hive a couple frames of open brood with eggs. This helps replenish the hive more quickly and gives a second opportunity to raise a queen if there is a mating failure.\n\nEach race or sub-species of honey bee has its own swarming characteristics. Italian bees are very prolific and inclined to swarm; Northern European black bees have a strong tendency to supersede their old queen without swarming. These differences are the result of differing evolutionary pressures in the regions where each sub-species evolved.\n\n=== Artificial swarming ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2019}}\nWhen a colony accidentally loses its queen, it is said to be \"queenless\". The workers realize that the queen is absent after as little as an hour, as her pheromones fade in the hive. Instinctively, the workers select cells containing eggs aged less than three days and enlarge these cells dramatically to form \"emergency queen cells\". These appear similar to large peanut-like structures about an inch long that hang from the center or side of the brood combs. The developing larva in a queen cell is fed differently from an ordinary worker-bee; in addition to the normal honey and pollen, she receives a great deal of royal jelly, a special food secreted by young \"nurse bees\" from the hypopharyngeal gland. This special food dramatically alters the growth and development of the larva so that, after metamorphosis and pupation, it emerges from the cell as a queen bee. The queen is the only bee in a colony which has fully developed ovaries, and she secretes a pheromone which suppresses the normal development of ovaries in all her workers.\n\nBeekeepers use the ability of the bees to produce new queens to increase their colonies in a procedure called ''splitting a colony''. To do this, they remove several brood combs from a healthy hive, taking care to leave the old queen behind. These combs must contain eggs or larvae less than three days old and be covered by young ''nurse bees'', which care for the brood and keep it warm. These brood combs and attendant nurse bees are then placed into a small \"nucleus hive\" with other combs containing honey and pollen. As soon as the nurse bees find themselves in this new hive and realize they have no queen, they set about constructing emergency queen cells using the eggs or larvae they have in the combs with them.\n\n== Losses ==\n\n=== Diseases ===\n{{Main|List of diseases of the honey bee}}\nThe common agents of disease that affect adult honey bees include [[Fungus|fungi]], [[bacteria]], [[protozoa]], [[virus]]es, [[parasitism|parasites]], and [[poison]]s. The gross symptoms displayed by affected adult bees are very similar, whatever the cause, making it difficult for the apiarist to ascertain the causes of problems without microscopic identification of microorganisms or chemical analysis of poisons.<ref name=\"Grout\">{{cite book|title=The hive and the honey bee: a new book on beekeeping which continues the tradition of \"Langstroth on the hive and the honeybee\"|editor=Grout, Roy A.|publisher=Dadant and Sons.|year=1949|page=607|chapter=Diseases of Adult bees|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=K84OAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA607&q=diseases%20of%20bees|accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref> Since 2006 colony losses from [[colony collapse disorder]] have been increasing across the world although the causes of the [[syndrome]] are, as yet, unknown.<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Renee|title= Honey Bee Colony Collapse Disorder|year=2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://science.time.com/2013/05/07/beepocalypse-redux-honey-bees-are-still-dying-and-we-still-dont-know-why/|title=Beepocalypse Redux: Honeybees Are Still Dying \u2014 and We Still Don't Know Why|last=Walsh|first=Bryan|date=7 May 2013|work=Time Science and Space|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref> In the US, commercial beekeepers have been increasing the number of hives to deal with [[Pollination#Economics of pollination|higher rates of attrition]].<ref>{{Cite news|title = Call off the bee-pocalypse: U.S. honeybee colonies hit a 20-year high|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/07/23/call-off-the-bee-pocalypse-u-s-honeybee-colonies-hit-a-20-year-high/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2015-07-23|access-date = 2015-12-01|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Christopher|last = Ingraham}}</ref>\n\n=== Parasites ===\n''[[Galleria mellonella]]'' and ''[[lesser wax moth|Achroia grisella]]'' \u201cwax moth\u201d larvae that hatch, tunnel through, and destroy comb that contains bee larvae and their honey stores.

Beekeeping was also documented by the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] writers [[Virgil]], [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], and [[Columella]].\n\nBeekeeping has also been practiced in [[ancient China]] since antiquity. In the book \"Golden Rules of Business Success\" written by [[Fan Li]] (or Tao Zhu Gong) during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] there are sections describing the art of beekeeping, stressing the importance of the quality of the wooden box used and how this can affect the quality of the honey. The Chinese word for honey ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u871c}}}} ''m\u00ec'', reconstructed [[Old Chinese]] pronunciation {{IPA|*mjit}}) was borrowed from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[proto-Tocharian language]], the source of \"honey\", from proto-Tocharian *''\u1e3f\u0259t(\u0259)'' (where *''\u1e3f'' is [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]]; cf.

Preeminent among these scientific pioneers were [[Swammerdam]], [[Ren\u00e9 Antoine Ferchault de R\u00e9aumur]], [[Charles Bonnet]], and [[Fran\u00e7ois Huber]]. Swammerdam and R\u00e9aumur were among the first to use a microscope and dissection to understand the internal biology of honey bees. R\u00e9aumur was among the first to construct a glass walled observation hive to better observe activities within hives. He observed queens laying eggs in open cells, but still had no idea of how a queen was fertilized; nobody had ever witnessed the mating of a queen and drone and many theories held that queens were \"[[parthenogenesis|self-fertile]],\" while others believed that a vapor or \"miasma\" emanating from the drones fertilized queens without direct physical contact. Huber was the first to prove by observation and experiment that queens are physically inseminated by drones outside the confines of hives, usually a great distance away.\n\nFollowing R\u00e9aumur's design, Huber built improved glass-walled observation hives and sectional hives that could be opened like the leaves of a book. This allowed inspecting individual wax combs and greatly improved direct observation of hive activity. Although he went blind before he was twenty, Huber employed a secretary, Fran\u00e7ois Burnens, to make daily observations, conduct careful experiments, and keep accurate notes over more than twenty years. Huber confirmed that a hive consists of one queen who is the mother of all the female workers and male drones in the colony. He was also the first to confirm that mating with drones takes place outside of hives and that queens are inseminated by a number of successive matings with male drones, high in the air at a great distance from their hive. Together, he and Burnens dissected bees under the [[microscope]] and were among the first to describe the [[ovary|ovaries]] and [[spermatheca]], or sperm store, of queens as well as the [[penis]] of male drones. Huber is universally regarded as \"the father of modern bee-science\" and his \"Nouvelles Observations sur Les Abeilles (or \"New Observations on Bees\") <ref name=\"Huber1814\">{{cite book|author=Fran\u00e7ois Huber|title=Nouvelles observations sur les abeilles|url=https://archive.org/details/nouvellesobserv00hubegoog|accessdate=27 March 2014|year=1814|publisher=Chez J. J. Paschoud, \u2026 et a Geneve}}</ref> revealed all the basic scientific truths for the biology and ecology of honeybees.\n\n=== Invention of the movable comb hive ===\n[[File:Jan-van-der-Straet Bauerlicher-Bienenstand.png|thumb|Rural beekeeping in the 16th century]]\n\nEarly forms of honey collecting entailed the destruction of the entire colony when the honey was harvested. The wild hive was crudely broken into, using smoke to suppress the bees, the [[honeycomb]]s were torn out and smashed up&nbsp;\u2014 along with the eggs, larvae and honey they contained. The liquid honey from the destroyed brood nest was strained through a sieve or basket. This was destructive and unhygienic, but for [[hunter-gatherer]] societies this did not matter, since the honey was generally consumed immediately and there were always more wild colonies to exploit. But in settled societies the destruction of the bee colony meant the loss of a valuable resource; this drawback made beekeeping both inefficient and something of a \"stop and start\" activity. There could be no continuity of production and no possibility of selective breeding, since each bee colony was destroyed at harvest time, along with its precious queen.\n\nDuring the medieval period [[abbey]]s and [[monastery|monasteries]] were centers of beekeeping, since beeswax was highly prized for candles and fermented honey was used to make alcoholic [[mead]] in areas of Europe where vines would not grow. The 18th and 19th centuries saw successive stages of a revolution in beekeeping, which allowed the bees themselves to be preserved when taking the harvest.\n\nIntermediate stages in the transition from the old beekeeping to the new were recorded for example by Thomas Wildman in 1768/1770, who described advances over the destructive old skep-based beekeeping so that the bees no longer had to be killed to harvest the honey.<ref>Thomas Wildman, ''A Treatise on the Management of Bees'' (London, 1768, 2nd edn 1770).</ref> Wildman for example fixed a parallel array of wooden bars across the top of a straw hive or skep (with a separate straw top to be fixed on later) \"so that there are in all seven bars of deal\" [in a {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} hive] \"to which the bees fix their combs\".<ref>Wildman, op.cit., 2nd (1770) ed., at pp.94\u201395.</ref> He also described using such hives in a multi-storey configuration, foreshadowing the modern use of supers:  he described adding (at a proper time) successive straw hives below, and eventually removing the ones above when free of brood and filled with honey, so that the bees could be separately preserved at the harvest for a following season.  Wildman also described<ref>Wildman, op.cit., 2nd (1770) ed., at pp.112\u2013115.</ref> a further development, using hives with \"sliding frames\" for the bees to build their comb, foreshadowing more modern uses of movable-comb hives.  Wildman's book acknowledged the advances in knowledge of bees previously made by Swammerdam, Maraldi, and de R\u00e9aumur\u2014he included a lengthy translation of R\u00e9aumur's account of the natural history of bees\u2014and he also described the initiatives of others in designing hives for the preservation of bee-life when taking the harvest, citing in particular reports from Brittany dating from the 1750s, due to Comte de la Bourdonnaye.\nHowever, the forerunners of the modern hives with movable frames that are mainly used today are considered the traditional basket top bar (movable comb) hives of Greece, known as \u201cGreek beehives\u201d. The oldest testimony on their use dates back to 1669 although it is probable that their use is more than 3000 years old.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/1929792 |title=A 17th Century Testimony On The Use Of Ceramic Top-bar Hives. 2012 &#124; Haralampos (\u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2) Harissis (\u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2) and Georgios Mavrofridis |journal=Bee World |year=2012 |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=56\u201358 |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2016-03-12|last1=Harissis (\u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2) |first1=Haralampos (\u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2) |last2=Mavrofridis |first2=Georgios |doi=10.1080/0005772X.2012.11417481 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lorenzo Langstroth.jpg|left|thumb|[[Lorenzo Langstroth]]<br/>(1810\u20131895)]]\nThe 19th century saw this revolution in beekeeping practice completed through the perfection of the movable comb hive by the American [[Lorenzo Langstroth|Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth]]. Langstroth was the first person to make practical use of Huber's earlier discovery that there was a specific spatial measurement between the wax combs, later called ''the bee space'', which bees do not block with wax, but keep as a free passage. Having determined this bee space (between 5 and 8&nbsp;mm, or 1/4 to 3/8\"), Langstroth then designed a series of wooden frames within a rectangular hive box, carefully maintaining the correct space between successive frames, and found that the bees would build parallel honeycombs in the box without bonding them to each other or to the hive walls. This enables the beekeeper to slide any frame out of the hive for inspection, without harming the bees or the comb, protecting the eggs, larvae and pupae contained within the cells. It also meant that combs containing honey could be gently removed and the honey extracted without destroying the comb. The emptied honey combs could then be returned to the bees intact for refilling.  Langstroth's book, ''The Hive and Honey-bee'', published in 1853, described his rediscovery of the bee space and the development of his patent movable comb hive.\n\nThe invention and development of the movable-comb-hive fostered the growth of commercial honey production on a large scale in both Europe and the US (see also [[Beekeeping in the United States]]).\n\n=== Evolution of hive designs ===\n[[File:Bees at the hive entrance.JPG|thumb|Bees at the hive entrance]]\n\nLangstroth's design for movable comb hives was seized upon by apiarists and inventors on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and a wide range of moveable comb hives were designed and perfected in [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United States]]. Classic designs evolved in each country: [[Charles Dadant|Dadant]] hives and [[Langstroth hive]]s are still dominant in the US; in France the [[Georges de Layens|De-Layens]] trough-hive became popular and in the UK a British National hive became standard as late as the 1930s although in Scotland the smaller Smith hive is still popular. In some Scandinavian countries and in Russia the traditional trough hive persisted until late in the 20th century and is still kept in some areas. However, the Langstroth and Dadant designs remain ubiquitous in the US and also in many parts of Europe, though [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], Germany, France and [[Italy]] all have their own national hive designs. Regional variations of hive evolved to reflect the climate, floral productivity and the reproductive characteristics of the various subspecies of native honey bee in each bio-region.\n\n[[File:\u0421\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0451\u0434.jpg|thumb|Honey-laden honeycomb in a wooden frame]]\n\nThe differences in hive dimensions are insignificant in comparison to the common factors in all these hives: they are all square or rectangular; they all use movable wooden frames; they all consist of a floor, brood-box, [[honey super]], crown-board and roof. Hives have traditionally been constructed of [[Cedrus|cedar]], pine, or [[cypress]] wood, but in recent years hives made from injection molded dense [[polystyrene]] have become increasingly important.\n\nHives also use queen excluders between the brood-box and honey supers to keep the queen from laying eggs in cells next to those containing honey intended for consumption. Also, with the advent in the 20th century of mite pests, hive floors are often replaced for part of (or the whole) year with a wire mesh and removable tray.\n\n[[File:Flow hive 2 with honey jars.jpg|thumb|Flow Hive 2 with honey pouring into jars]]\n\nIn 2015 the [[Flow Hive]] system was invented in Australia by Cedar Anderson and his father Stuart Anderson<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-12/australian-story-flow-hive-family-talks-about-life-now/7828436 |title=Flow Hive: Cedar and Stuart Anderson talk about life one year after crowdfunding success |last=Hassall |first=Craig |location=[[ABC Online]] |date=12 September 2017}}</ref>, allowing honey to be extracted without expensive centrifuge equipment.\n\n=== Pioneers of practical and commercial beekeeping ===\nThe 19th century produced an explosion of innovators and inventors who perfected the design and production of beehives, systems of management and husbandry, stock improvement by [[selective breeding]], [[honey extraction]] and marketing. Preeminent among these innovators were:\n\n[[Petro Prokopovych]] used frames with channels in the side of the woodwork; these were packed side by side in boxes that were stacked one on top of the other. The bees traveled from frame to frame and box to box via the channels. The channels were similar to the cut outs in the sides of modern wooden sections<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dave-cushman.net/bee/hist.html|title=History of British Standards in Beekeeping|author=Dave Cushman|work=dave-cushman.net}}</ref> (1814).\n\n[[Jan Dzier\u017con]] was the father of modern apiology and apiculture. All modern beehives are descendants of his design.\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois Huber]] made significant discoveries regarding the bee life-cycle and communication between bees. Despite being blind, Huber brought to light a large amount of information regarding the queen bee's mating habits and her communication with the rest of the hive. His work was published as ''New Observations on the Natural History of Bees''.\n\n[[L. L. Langstroth]] revered as the \"father of American apiculture\"; no other individual has influenced modern beekeeping practice more than Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth. His classic book ''The Hive and Honey-bee'' was published in 1853.\n\n[[Moses Quinby]] often termed \"the father of commercial beekeeping in the United States\", author of ''Mysteries of Bee-Keeping Explained''. He invented the [[Bee smoker]] in 1873.<ref>Bee Culture - Moses Quinby - http://www.beeculture.com/moses-quinby/</ref><ref>Thermal Beekeeping: Look Inside a Burning Bee Smoker - https://americanbeejournal.com/thermal-beekeeping-look-inside-a-burning-bee-smoker/</ref>\n\n[[Amos Root]] author of the ''A B C of Bee Culture'', which has been continuously revised and remains in print.

Cook]] author of ''The Bee-Keepers' Guide; or Manual of the Apiary'', 1876.\n\n[[Dr. C.C. Miller]] was one of the first entrepreneurs to actually make a living from apiculture. By 1878 he made beekeeping his sole business activity. His book, ''Fifty Years Among the Bees'', remains a classic and his influence on bee management persists to this day.\n\n[[File:Honigschleuder.jpg|thumb|Honey Extractor]]\n\n[[Franz Hruschka]] was an Italian military officer who made one crucial invention that catalyzed the commercial honey industry. In 1865 he invented a simple machine for extracting honey from the comb by means of centrifugal force. His original idea was simply to support combs in a metal framework and then spin them around within a container to collect honey as it was thrown out by centrifugal force. This meant that honeycombs could be returned to a hive undamaged but empty, saving the bees a vast amount of work, time, and materials. This single invention greatly improved the efficiency of honey harvesting and catalysed the modern honey industry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Birth of American Bee Culture : A Look at Advertisements in A.J.

Kelley]] was an American pioneer of modern beekeeping in the early and mid-20th century.  He greatly improved upon beekeeping equipment and clothing and went on to manufacture these items as well as other equipment.  His company sold via catalog worldwide and his book, ''How to Keep Bees & Sell Honey'', an introductory book of apiculture and marketing, allowed for a boom in beekeeping following [[World War II]].\n\nIn the U.K. practical beekeeping was led in the early 20th century by a few men, pre-eminently [[Brother Adam]] and his [[Buckfast bee]] and [[R.O.B. Manley]], author of many titles, including ''Honey Production in the British Isles'' and inventor of the Manley frame, still universally popular in the U.K. Other notable British pioneers include William Herrod-Hempsall and Gale.\n\nDr. [[Ahmed Zaky Abushady]] (1892\u20131955), was an Egyptian poet, medical doctor, bacteriologist and bee scientist who was active in England and in Egypt in the early part of the twentieth century. In 1919, Abushady patented a removable, standardized aluminum honeycomb. In 1919 he also founded The Apis Club in [[Benson, Oxfordshire|Benson]], Oxfordshire, and its periodical Bee World, which was to be edited by [[Annie D. Betts]] and later by Dr. [[Eva Crane]]. The Apis Club was transitioned to the [[International Bee Research Association]] (IBRA). Its archives are held in the [[National Library of Wales]]. In Egypt in the 1930s, Abushady established The Bee Kingdom League and its organ, The Bee Kingdom.\n\nIn India, R. N. Mattoo was the pioneer worker  in starting beekeeping with Indian honeybee, (''Apis cerana indica'') in the early 1930s. Beekeeping with European honeybee, (''Apis mellifera'') was started by Dr. A. S. Atwal and his team members,  O. P. Sharma and  N. P. Goyal in Punjab in the early 1960s. It remained confined to Punjab and Himachal Pradesh up to the late 1970s. Later on in 1982,  Dr. R. C. Sihag, working at Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar (Haryana), introduced and established this honeybee in Haryana and standardized its management practices for semi-arid-subtropical climates. On the basis of these practices, beekeeping with this honeybee could be extended to the rest of the country. Now beekeeping with ''Apis mellifera'' predominates in India.\n\n== Traditional beekeeping ==\n[[File:Lithuanian Museum of Ancient Beekeeping.jpg|thumb|right|Wooden hives in [[Stripeikiai]] honeymaking museum, Lithuania]]\n[[File:Beekeeping at Kawah Ijen, Indonesia.jpg|thumb|Beekeeping at Kawah [[Ijen]] Mountain, [[Indonesia]]]]\n\n=== Fixed comb hives ===\nA fixed comb hive is a hive in which the combs cannot be removed or manipulated for management or harvesting without permanently damaging the comb.  Almost any hollow structure can be used for this purpose, such as a [[log gum]], [[skep]], wooden box, or a clay pot or tube.  Fixed comb hives are no longer in common use in industrialized countries, and are illegal in places that require movable combs to inspect for problems such as [[varroa]] and [[American foulbrood]].\nIn many developing countries fixed comb hives are widely used and, because they can be made from any locally available material .\n\nBeekeeping using fixed comb hives is an essential part of the livelihoods of many communities in poor countries. The charity [[Bees for Development]] recognizes that local skills to manage bees in fixed comb hives<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beesfordevelopment.org/portal/topic.php?id=15&p=101  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518171416/http://beesfordevelopment.org/portal/topic.php?id=15&p=101 |archivedate=2011-05-18 |title=Fixed combs}}</ref> are widespread in Africa, Asia, and South America.  Internal size of fixed comb hives range from 32.7 liters (2000 cubic inches) typical of the clay tube hives used in Egypt to 282 liters (17209 cubic inches) for the Perone hive.  Straw [[skep]]s, bee gums, and unframed box hives are unlawful in most US states, as the comb and brood cannot be inspected for diseases. However, skeps are still used for collecting swarms by hobbyists in the UK, before moving them into standard hives.  [[Moses Quinby|Quinby]] used box hives to produce so much honey that he saturated the New York market in the 1860s.  His writings contain excellent advice for management of bees in fixed comb hives.\n\n== Modern beekeeping ==\n\n=== Topbar hives ===\n{{Main|Top-bar hive}}\nTop bar hives have been widely adopted in Africa where they are used to keep tropical honeybee ecotypes.  Their advantages include being light weight, adaptable, easy to harvest honey, and less stressful for the bees. Disadvantages include combs that are fragile and cannot usually be extracted and returned to the bees to be refilled and that they cannot easily be expanded for additional honey storage.\n\nA growing number of amateur beekeepers are adopting various [[top-bar hive]]s similar to the type commonly found in Africa. Top bar hives were originally used as a traditional beekeeping method in Greece and Vietnam with a history dating back over 2000 years.<ref name=\"Honey Hunting' 1999\" /> These hives have no frames and the honey-filled comb is not returned after extraction. Because of this, the production of honey is likely to be somewhat less than that of a frame and super based hive such as Langstroth or Dadant. Top bar hives are mostly kept by people who are more interested in having bees in their garden than in honey production per se.  Some of the most well known top-bar hive designs are the Kenyan Top Bar Hive with sloping sides, the Tanzanian Top Bar Hive with straight sides, and Vertical Top Bar Hives, such as the Warre or \"People's Hive\" designed by Abbe Warre in the mid-1900s.\n\nThe initial costs and equipment requirements are typically much less than other hive designs. Scrap wood or #2 or #3 pine can often be used to build a nice hive. Top-bar hives also offer some advantages to interacting with the bees and the amount of weight that must be lifted is greatly reduced. Top-bar hives are being widely used in developing countries in Africa and Asia as a result of the [[Bees for Development]] program. Since 2011, a growing number of beekeepers in the U.S. are using various top-bar hives.<ref>{{cite web| last =Gregory | first=Pam | title=Better beekeeping in top-bar hives | publisher =Bees For Development | url=http://www.beesfordevelopment.org/info/info/topbar/better-beekeeping-in-topb-2.shtml | accessdate=2008-03-12 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321135910/http://www.beesfordevelopment.org/info/info/topbar/better-beekeeping-in-topb-2.shtml | archivedate=21 March 2008 | url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Vertical stackable hives ===\nThere are three types of vertical stackable hives:  hanging or top-access frame, sliding or side-access frame, and top bar.\n\nHanging frame hives include [[Langstroth hive|Langstroth]], the British National, Dadant, Layens, and Rose, differing primarily by size or number of frames.  The Langstroth was the first successful top-opened hive with movable frames.  Many other hive designs are based on the principle of bee space first described by [[Lorenzo Langstroth|Langstroth]], and is a descendant of Jan [[Dzierzon]]'s Polish hive designs. Langstroth hives are the most common size in the [[United States]] and much of the world; the British National is the most common size in the [[United Kingdom]]; Dadant and Modified Dadant hives are widely used in France and Italy, and Layens by some beekeepers, where their large size is an advantage.  Square Dadant hives\u2013often called 12 frame Dadant or Brother Adam hives\u2013are used in large parts of Germany and other parts of Europe by commercial beekeepers.\n\nAny hanging frame hive design can be built as a sliding frame design.  The AZ Hive, the original sliding frame design, integrates hives using Langstroth-sized frames into a honey house so as to streamline the workflow of honey harvest by localization of labor, similar to [[cellular manufacturing]].  The honey house can be a portable trailer, allowing the beekeeper to haul the hives to a site and provide pollination services.\n\nTop bar stackable hives simply use top bars instead of full frames.  The most common type is the Warre hive, although any hive with hanging frames can be made into a top bar stackable hive by using only the top bar and not the whole frame.  This may work less-well with larger frames, where crosscomb and attachment can occur more-readily.\n\n=== Protective clothing ===\n[[File:Beekeeper keeping bees.jpg|upright|right|Beekeepers often wear protective clothing to protect themselves from stings|thumb]]\n\nMost beekeepers also wear some protective clothing. Novice beekeepers usually wear gloves and a hooded suit or hat and veil. Experienced beekeepers sometimes elect not to use gloves because they inhibit delicate manipulations. The face and neck are the most important areas to protect, so most beekeepers wear at least a veil.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Hive and the honey bee : a new book on beekeeping which continues the tradition of \"Langstroth on the hive and the honeybee\"|date=1992|publisher=Dadant|others=Graham, Joe M., Ambrose, J.

This is because of the natural color of cotton and cost of coloring was an expense not warranted for workwear, though some consider this is to provide better differentiation from the colony's natural predators (such as bears and skunks) which tend to be dark-colored. It is now known that bees see in ultraviolet and are also attracted to scent. So the type of fabric conditioner used has more impact than the color of the fabric.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.ncsu.edu/2011/07/wms-what-bees-see/|title=What Do Bees See?

Washing suits regularly, and rinsing gloved hands in vinegar minimizes attraction.\n\n=== Smoker ===\n{{Main|Bee smoker}}\n\n[[File:Bee smoker.jpg|thumb|Bee smoker with heat shield and hook]]\n\nSmoke is the beekeeper's third line of defense. Most beekeepers use a \"smoker\"\u2014a device designed to generate smoke from the incomplete combustion of various fuels. Smoke calms bees; it initiates a feeding response in anticipation of possible hive abandonment due to fire.<ref>{{cite thesis|last1=Newton|first1=David Comstock|title=Behavioral Response of Honey Bees (Apis Mellifera L., Hymenoptera: Apidae) to Colony Disturbance by Smoke, Acetic Acid, Isopentyl Acetate, Light, Temperature and Vibration|date=March 1967|location=Champaign, IL|publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign|University of Illinois]]|id=Document No. 302256408{{ProQuest|302256408}}|page=3|degree=Ph.D.}}</ref> Smoke also masks alarm pheromones released by guard bees or when bees are squashed in an inspection. The ensuing confusion creates an opportunity for the beekeeper to open the hive and work without triggering a defensive reaction. In addition, when a bee consumes honey the bee's abdomen distends, supposedly making it difficult to make the necessary flexes to sting, though this has not been tested scientifically.\n\nMany types of fuel can be used in a smoker as long as it is natural and not contaminated with harmful substances. These fuels include [[hessian (cloth)|hessian]], [[twine]], [[burlap]], pine needles, corrugated cardboard, and mostly rotten or punky wood. Indian beekeepers, especially in Kerala, often use coconut fibers as they are readily available, safe, and of negligible expense. Some beekeeping supply sources also sell commercial fuels like pulped paper and compressed cotton, or even aerosol cans of smoke. Other beekeepers use [[sumac]] as fuel because it ejects lots of smoke and doesn't have an odor.\n\nSome beekeepers are using \"liquid smoke\" as a safer, more convenient alternative. It is a water-based solution that is sprayed onto the bees from a plastic spray bottle.\n\nTorpor may also be induced by the introduction of chilled air into the hive \u2013 while chilled carbon dioxide may have harmful long-term effects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Gene E.|last2=Visscher|first2=P.

Beekeepers have high levels of antibodies (mainly [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]]) reacting to the major antigen of [[bee venom]], [[phospholipase]] A2 (PLA).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=HELD|first1=W.|last2=STUCKI|first2=M.|last3=HEUSSER|first3=C.|last4=BLASER|first4=K.|title=Production of Human Antibodies to Bee Venom Phospholipase A2 in Vitro|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Immunology|date=February 1989|volume=29|issue=2|pages=203\u2013209|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3083.1989.tb01117.x|pmid=2922572}}</ref> Antibodies correlate with the frequency of bee stings.\n\nThe entry of venom into the body from bee-stings may also be hindered and reduced by protective clothing that allows the wearer to remove stings and venom sacs with a simple tug on the clothing. Although the stinger is barbed, a worker bee is less likely to become lodged into clothing than human skin.\n\nIf a beekeeper is stung by a bee, there are many protective measures that should be taken in order to make sure the affected area does not become too irritated. The first cautionary step that should be taken following a bee sting is removing the stinger without squeezing the attached venom glands. A quick scrape with a fingernail is effective and intuitive. This step is effective in making sure that the venom injected does not spread, so the side effects of the sting will go away sooner. Washing the affected area with soap and water is also a good way to stop the spread of venom. The last step that needs to be taken is to apply ice or a cold compress to the stung area.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Mayo Clinic Staff|title=Bee Stings-Treatments and Drugs|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bee-stings/basics/treatment/con-20034120|website=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Natural beekeeping ===\nThe natural beekeeping movement believes that bee hives are weakened by modern beekeeping and agricultural practices, such as crop spraying, hive movement, frequent hive inspections, [[artificial insemination]] of queens, routine medication, and sugar water feeding.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nPractitioners of \"natural beekeeping\" tend to use variations of the top-bar hive, which is a simple design that retains the concept of having a movable comb without the use of frames or a foundation. The horizontal top-bar hive, as championed by Marty Hardison, Michael Bush, Philip Chandler, Dennis Murrell and others, can be seen as a modernization of hollow log hives, with the addition of wooden bars of specific width from which bees hang their combs. Its widespread adoption in recent years can be attributed to the publication in 2007 of ''The Barefoot Beekeeper<ref>{{cite book|last=Chandler|first=Philip|title=The Barefoot Beekeeper|year=2007|publisher=Lulu|isbn=978-1-4092-7114-7|page=111|url=http://www.biobees.com}}</ref>'' by Philip Chandler, which challenged many aspects of modern beekeeping and offered the horizontal top-bar hive as a viable alternative to the ubiquitous Langstroth-style movable-frame hive.\n\nThe most popular vertical top-bar hive is the Warr\u00e9 hive, based on a design by the French priest Abb\u00e9 \u00c9mile Warr\u00e9 (1867\u20131951) and popularized by Dr. David Heaf in his English translation of Warr\u00e9's book ''L'Apiculture pour Tous'' as ''Beekeeping For All''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://warre.biobees.com/ |title=Beekeeping with the Warr\u00e9 hive \u2013 Home |website=Warre.biobees.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-12}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Honey bee in Toronto.jpg|thumb|Honey bee in Toronto]]\n\n=== Urban or backyard beekeeping ===\n{{Main|Urban beekeeping}}Related to natural beekeeping, [[urban beekeeping]] is an attempt to revert to a less industrialized way of obtaining honey by utilizing small-scale colonies that pollinate [[Urban horticulture|urban gardens]].

This may be done for reasons of space and monitoring, or in the off-season.  In the off-season, large commercial beekeepers may move colonies to \"wintering\" warehouses, with fixed temperature, light and humidity.  This helps the bees remain healthy, but relatively dormant. These relatively dormant or \"wintered\" bees survive on stored honey, and new bees are not born.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bees.techno-science.ca/english/bees/the-beekeeper/winter-techniques.php|title=Wintering Techniques}}</ref>\n\nExperiments in raising bees for longer durations indoors have looked into more detailed and varying environment controls.  In 2015, [[MIT]]'s ''Synthetic Apiary'' project simulated springtime inside a closed environment, for a number of hives over the course of a winter.  They provided food sources and simulated long days, and saw activity and reproduction levels comparable to the levels seen outdoors in warm weather. They concluded that such an indoor apiary could be sustained year-round if needed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.creativeapplications.net/news/synthetic-apiary-biologically-augmented-digital-fabrication/|title=Synthetic Apiary \u2013 Biologically augmented digital fabrication|newspaper=CreativeApplications.Net|access-date=2016-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/mits-mediated-matter-group-builds-a-synthetic-apiary-to-help-save-bees_o |title=MIT's Mediated Matter Group Builds a Synthetic Apiary to Help Save Bees|publisher=Architect Magazine|date=2016-10-17}}</ref>\n\n== Bee colonies ==\n\n=== Species ===\nThere are more than 20,000 species of wild bees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/articles/bee-species-outnumber-mammals-birds.html |title=Bee Species Outnumber Mammals And Birds Combined |publisher=Biology Online |date=2008-06-17 |accessdate=2016-03-12}}</ref> Many species are solitary<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insectpix.net/solitary_bees_gallery.htm |title=Insectpix.net |website=Insectpix.net |date= |accessdate=2016-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225035450/http://www.insectpix.net/solitary_bees_gallery.htm |archive-date=2007-02-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (e.g., [[mason bee]]s, leafcutter bees ([[Megachilidae]]), [[carpenter bees]] and  other ground-nesting bees). Many others rear their young in burrows and small colonies (e.g., [[bumblebee]]s and [[stingless bees]]). Some honey bees are wild e.g. the little honeybee (''[[Apis florea]]''), giant honeybee (''[[Apis dorsata]]'') and rock bee (''[[Apis laboriosa]]''). Beekeeping, or apiculture, is concerned with the practical management of the social species of honey bees, which live in large colonies of up to 100,000 individuals. In [[Europe]] and [[United States|America]] the species universally managed by beekeepers is the [[Western honey bee]] (''Apis mellifera''). This species has several sub-species or regional varieties, such as the [[Italian bee]] (''Apis mellifera ligustica''), [[European dark bee]] (''Apis mellifera mellifera''), and the [[Carniolan honey bee]] (''Apis mellifera carnica''). In the tropics, other species of social bees are managed for honey production, including the Asiatic honey bee (''[[Apis cerana]]'').\n\n=== Castes ===\nA colony of bees consists of three castes of bee:\n*a [[queen bee]], which is normally the only breeding female in the colony;\n*a large number of female [[worker bee]]s, typically 30,000\u201350,000 in number;\n*a number of male [[Drone (bee)|drones]], ranging from thousands in a strong hive in spring to very few during dearth or cold season.\n\n[[File:Bienenkoenigin 43a.jpg|thumb|Queen bee (center)]]\n\nThe queen is the only sexually mature female in the hive and all of the female worker bees and male drones are her offspring. The queen may live for up to three years or more and may be capable of laying half a million eggs or more in her lifetime. At the peak of the breeding season, late spring to summer, a good queen may be capable of laying 3,000 eggs in one day, more than her own body weight. This would be exceptional however; a prolific queen might peak at 2,000 eggs a day, but a more average queen might lay just 1,500 eggs per day. The queen is raised from a normal worker egg, but is fed a larger amount of [[royal jelly]] than a normal worker bee, resulting in a radically different growth and metamorphosis. The queen influences the colony by the production and dissemination of a variety of [[pheromone]]s or \"queen substances\". One of these chemicals suppresses the development of ovaries in all the female worker bees in the hive and prevents them from laying eggs.\n\n==== Mating of queens ====\nThe queen emerges from her cell after 15 days of development and she remains in the hive for 3\u20137 days before venturing out on a mating flight. Mating flight is otherwise known as \"nuptial flight\". Her first orientation flight may only last a few seconds, just enough to mark the position of the hive. Subsequent mating flights may last from 5 minutes to 30 minutes, and she may mate with a number of male drones on each flight. Over several matings, possibly a dozen or more, the queen receives and stores enough [[sperm]] from a succession of drones to fertilize hundreds of thousands of eggs. If she does not manage to leave the hive to mate\u2014possibly due to bad weather or being trapped in part of the hive\u2014she remains infertile and becomes a ''drone layer'', incapable of producing female worker bees. Worker bees sometimes kill a non-performing queen and produce another. Without a properly performing queen, the hive is doomed.\n\nMating takes place at some distance from the hive and often several hundred feet in the air; it is thought that this separates the strongest drones from the weaker ones, ensuring that only the fastest and strongest drones get to pass on their genes.\n\n==== Worker bees ====\n[[File:Apis mellifera carnica worker hive entrance 3.jpg|thumb|Worker bee]]\nMost of the bees in a hive are female worker bees. At the height of summer when activity in the hive is frantic and work goes on non-stop, the life of a worker bee may be as short as 6 weeks; in late autumn, when no brood is being raised and no [[nectar]] is being harvested, a young bee may live for 16 weeks, right through the winter.\n\nOver the course of their lives, worker bees' duties are dictated by age. For the first few weeks of their lifespan, they perform basic chores within the hive: cleaning empty brood cells, removing debris and other housekeeping tasks, making wax for building or repairing comb, and feeding larvae. Later, they may ventilate the hive or guard the entrance. Older workers leave the hive daily, weather permitting, to forage for nectar, pollen, water, and propolis.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Note in the picture that they have much larger eyes than the workers have, presumably to better locate the queen during the mating flight. They do not work, do not forage for pollen or nectar, are unable to sting, and have no other known function than to mate with new queens and fertilize them on their mating flights. A bee colony generally starts to raise drones a few weeks before building queen cells so they can supersede a failing queen or prepare for swarming. When queen-raising for the season is over, bees in colder climates drive drones out of the hive to die, biting and tearing their legs and wings.\n\n=== Differing stages of development ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

If one were to cut a vertical cross-section through the hive from side to side, the brood nest would appear as a roughly ovoid ball spanning 5\u20138 frames of comb. The two outside combs at each side of the hive tend to be exclusively used for long-term storage of honey and pollen.\n\nWithin the central brood nest, a single frame of comb typically has a central disk of eggs, larvae and sealed brood cells that may extend almost to the edges of the frame. Immediately above the brood patch an arch of [[pollen]]-filled cells extends from side to side, and above that again a broader arch of honey-filled cells extends to the frame tops. The pollen is protein-rich food for developing larvae, while honey is also food but largely energy rich rather than protein rich. The nurse bees that care for the developing brood secrete a special food called \"[[royal jelly]]\" after feeding themselves on honey and pollen. The amount of royal jelly fed to a larva determines whether it develops into a worker bee or a queen.\n\nApart from the honey stored within the central brood frames, the bees store surplus honey in combs above the brood nest. In modern hives the beekeeper places separate boxes, called \"supers\", above the brood box, in which a series of shallower combs is provided for storage of honey. This enables the beekeeper to remove some of the supers in the late summer, and to extract the surplus honey harvest, without damaging the colony of bees and its brood nest below. If all the honey is taken, including the amount of honey needed to survive winter, the beekeeper must replace these stores by feeding the bees sugar or [[corn syrup]] in autumn.\n\n=== Annual cycle of a bee colony ===\nThe development of a bee colony follows an annual cycle of growth that begins in spring with a rapid expansion of the brood nest, as soon as pollen is available for feeding larvae. Some production of brood may begin as early as January, even in a cold winter, but breeding accelerates towards a peak in May (in the northern hemisphere), producing an abundance of harvesting bees synchronized to the main [[nectar flow]] in that region. Each race of bees times this build-up slightly differently, depending on how the flora of its original region blooms. Some regions of Europe have two nectar flows: one in late spring and another in late August. Other regions have only a single nectar flow. The skill of the beekeeper lies in predicting when the nectar flow will occur in his area and in trying to ensure that his colonies achieve a maximum population of harvesters at exactly the right time.\n<!-- NOTE: GRAPHIC REQUIRED HERE -->\n\nThe key factor in this is the prevention or skillful management of the swarming impulse. If a colony swarms unexpectedly and the beekeeper does not manage to capture the resulting swarm, he is likely to harvest significantly less honey from that hive, since he has lost half his worker bees at a single stroke. If, however, he can use the swarming impulse to breed a new queen but keep all the bees in the colony together, he maximizes his chances of a good harvest. It takes many years of learning and experience to be able to manage all these aspects successfully, though owing to variable circumstances many beginners often achieve a good honey harvest.\n\n== Formation of new colonies ==\n\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2017}}\n\n=== Colony reproduction: swarming and supersedure ===\n{{Main|Swarming (honey bee)}}\n\n[[File:Essaim d'abeilles en vol (modifi\u00e9e).jpg|thumb|right|A swarm about to land]]\n\nAll colonies are totally dependent on their queen, who is the only egg-layer. However, even the best queens live only a few years and one or two years longevity is the norm. She can choose whether or not to fertilize an egg as she lays it; if she does so, it develops into a female worker bee; if she lays an unfertilized egg it becomes a male drone. She decides which type of egg to lay depending on the size of the open brood cell she encounters on the comb. In a small worker cell, she lays a fertilized egg; if she finds a larger drone cell, she lays an unfertilized drone egg.\n\nAll the time that the queen is fertile and laying eggs she produces a variety of pheromones, which control the behavior of the bees in the hive. These are commonly called ''queen substance'', but there are various pheromones with different functions. As the queen ages, she begins to run out of stored sperm, and her pheromones begin to fail.\n\nInevitably, the queen begins to falter, and the bees decide to replace her by creating a new queen from one of her worker eggs. They may do this because she has been damaged (lost a leg or an antenna), because she has run out of sperm and cannot lay fertilized eggs (has become a \"drone laying queen\"), or because her pheromones have dwindled to where they cannot control all the bees in the hive. At this juncture, the bees produce one or more queen cells by modifying existing worker cells that contain a normal female egg.  They then pursue one of two ways to replace the queen: '''supersedure''', replacing or superseding the queen without swarming, or '''swarm cell production''', dividing the hive into two colonies through swarming.\n\nSupersedure is highly valued as a behavioral trait by beekeepers.  A hive that supersedes its old queen does not lose any stock.  Instead it creates a new queen and the old one fades away or is killed when the new queen emerges.  In these hives, the bees produce just one or two queen cells, characteristically in the center of the face of a broodcomb.\n\nSwarm cell production involves creating many queen cells, typically a dozen or more.  These are located around the edges of a broodcomb, often at the sides and the bottom.\n\n[[File:Honeycomb 20090206 jhansonxi.jpg|thumb|right|New wax combs between basement joists]]\nOnce either process has begun, the old queen leaves the hive with the hatching of the first queen cells. She leaves accompanied by a large number of bees, predominantly young bees (wax-secretors), who form the basis of the new hive. Scouts are sent out from the swarm to find suitable hollow trees or rock crevices. As soon as one is found, the entire swarm moves in. Within a matter of hours, they build new wax brood combs, using honey stores that the young bees have filled themselves with before leaving the old hive. Only young bees can secrete wax from special abdominal segments, and this is why swarms tend to contain more young bees.  Often a number of virgin queens accompany the first swarm (the \"prime swarm\"), and the old queen is replaced as soon as a daughter queen mates and begins laying. Otherwise, she is quickly superseded in the new home.\n\nDifferent sub-species of ''Apis mellifera'' exhibit differing swarming characteristics.  In general the more northerly black races are said to swarm less and supersede more, whereas the more southerly yellow and grey varieties are said to swarm more frequently. The truth is complicated because of the prevalence of cross-breeding and hybridization of the sub species.\n\n=== Factors that trigger swarming ===\nSome beekeepers may monitor their colonies carefully in spring and watch for the appearance of queen cells, which are a dramatic signal that the colony is determined to swarm.\n\n[[File:Essaim d'abeilles pos\u00e9.JPG|thumb|left|A swarm attached to a branch]]\n\nThis swarm looks for shelter. A beekeeper may capture it and introduce it into a new hive, helping meet this need. Otherwise, it returns to a [[feral]] state, in which case it finds shelter in a hollow tree, excavation, abandoned chimney, or even behind shutters.\n\nA small after-swarm has less chance of survival and may threaten the original hive's survival if the number of individuals left is unsustainable. When a hive swarms despite the beekeeper's preventative efforts, a good management practice is to give the reduced hive a couple frames of open brood with eggs. This helps replenish the hive more quickly and gives a second opportunity to raise a queen if there is a mating failure.\n\nEach race or sub-species of honey bee has its own swarming characteristics. Italian bees are very prolific and inclined to swarm; Northern European black bees have a strong tendency to supersede their old queen without swarming. These differences are the result of differing evolutionary pressures in the regions where each sub-species evolved.\n\n=== Artificial swarming ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2019}}\nWhen a colony accidentally loses its queen, it is said to be \"queenless\". The workers realize that the queen is absent after as little as an hour, as her pheromones fade in the hive. Instinctively, the workers select cells containing eggs aged less than three days and enlarge these cells dramatically to form \"emergency queen cells\". These appear similar to large peanut-like structures about an inch long that hang from the center or side of the brood combs. The developing larva in a queen cell is fed differently from an ordinary worker-bee; in addition to the normal honey and pollen, she receives a great deal of royal jelly, a special food secreted by young \"nurse bees\" from the hypopharyngeal gland. This special food dramatically alters the growth and development of the larva so that, after metamorphosis and pupation, it emerges from the cell as a queen bee. The queen is the only bee in a colony which has fully developed ovaries, and she secretes a pheromone which suppresses the normal development of ovaries in all her workers.\n\nBeekeepers use the ability of the bees to produce new queens to increase their colonies in a procedure called ''splitting a colony''. To do this, they remove several brood combs from a healthy hive, taking care to leave the old queen behind. These combs must contain eggs or larvae less than three days old and be covered by young ''nurse bees'', which care for the brood and keep it warm. These brood combs and attendant nurse bees are then placed into a small \"nucleus hive\" with other combs containing honey and pollen. As soon as the nurse bees find themselves in this new hive and realize they have no queen, they set about constructing emergency queen cells using the eggs or larvae they have in the combs with them.\n\n== Losses ==\n\n=== Diseases ===\n{{Main|List of diseases of the honey bee}}\nThe common agents of disease that affect adult honey bees include [[Fungus|fungi]], [[bacteria]], [[protozoa]], [[virus]]es, [[parasitism|parasites]], and [[poison]]s. The gross symptoms displayed by affected adult bees are very similar, whatever the cause, making it difficult for the apiarist to ascertain the causes of problems without microscopic identification of microorganisms or chemical analysis of poisons.<ref name=\"Grout\">{{cite book|title=The hive and the honey bee: a new book on beekeeping which continues the tradition of \"Langstroth on the hive and the honeybee\"|editor=Grout, Roy A.|publisher=Dadant and Sons.|year=1949|page=607|chapter=Diseases of Adult bees|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=K84OAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA607&q=diseases%20of%20bees|accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref> Since 2006 colony losses from [[colony collapse disorder]] have been increasing across the world although the causes of the [[syndrome]] are, as yet, unknown.<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Renee|title= Honey Bee Colony Collapse Disorder|year=2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://science.time.com/2013/05/07/beepocalypse-redux-honey-bees-are-still-dying-and-we-still-dont-know-why/|title=Beepocalypse Redux: Honeybees Are Still Dying \u2014 and We Still Don't Know Why|last=Walsh|first=Bryan|date=7 May 2013|work=Time Science and Space|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref> In the US, commercial beekeepers have been increasing the number of hives to deal with [[Pollination#Economics of pollination|higher rates of attrition]].<ref>{{Cite news|title = Call off the bee-pocalypse: U.S. honeybee colonies hit a 20-year high|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/07/23/call-off-the-bee-pocalypse-u-s-honeybee-colonies-hit-a-20-year-high/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2015-07-23|access-date = 2015-12-01|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Christopher|last = Ingraham}}</ref>\n\n=== Parasites ===\n''[[Galleria mellonella]]'' and ''[[lesser wax moth|Achroia grisella]]'' \u201cwax moth\u201d larvae that hatch, tunnel through, and destroy comb that contains bee larvae and their honey stores.
