Before he was drafted, he starred as an [[All-American]] on the [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team]]. At Michigan he was part of the [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|Fab Five]] recruiting class of 1991 that reached the finals of the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship]] in [[1992 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1992]] and [[1993 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1993]]. Howard won his first NBA championship with Miami in the [[2012 NBA Finals]] and his second NBA championship in the [[2013 NBA Finals]].\n\nHoward was an All-American [[center (basketball)|center]] and an [[honors student]] at [[Chicago Vocational Career Academy]]. Michigan was able to sign him early over numerous competing offers and then convince others in his recruiting class to join him. The Fab Five, which included [[Chris Webber]], [[Jalen Rose]], [[Jimmy King]] and [[Ray Jackson (basketball)|Ray Jackson]], served as regular [[starting lineup|starters]] during their freshman and sophomore years for the [[1991\u201392 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|1991\u201392]] and [[1992\u201393 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|1992\u201393 Wolverines]]. Howard was the last member of the Fab Five to remain active as a professional basketball player. Although many of the Wolverines' accomplishments from 1992 to 1998 were forfeited due to the [[University of Michigan basketball scandal]], which involved booster payments to players to [[Money laundering|launder money]] from illegal gambling, Howard's [[1994 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|1993\u201394 All-American]] season continues to be recognized.\n\nHoward played six-and-a-half seasons (1994\u20132001) for the Bullets franchise (renamed the Wizards in 1997), three full seasons (2004\u201307) for the [[Houston Rockets]], two plus seasons for the Heat and shorter stints for several other teams. During his rookie year with the Bullets, he became the first player to [[#Graduation|graduate on time]] with his class after leaving college early to play in the NBA. After one season as an [[NBA All-Rookie Team|All-Rookie]] player and a second as an All-Star and an All-NBA performer, he became the first NBA player to sign a $100&nbsp;million contract. While he continued to be a productive starter, he was never again selected to play in an All-Star Game. Towards the end of his contract, he was traded at the NBA trade deadline twice to make [[salary cap]] room. He was most recently a regular starter during the [[2005\u201306 NBA season]]. In 2010, he signed with the Heat and entered his 17th NBA season, during which he reached the playoffs for the sixth time and made his first career [[2011 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] appearance. He remained with the Heat the following season and won his first NBA championship during the 2012 NBA Finals. He returned to the Heat for part of the following season, and won a second championship. Howard has developed a reputation as a humanitarian for his civic commitment.\n\n==Early life==\nHoward's grandmother, Jannie Mae Howard, was the daughter of [[sharecropper]]s from [[Belzoni, Mississippi]]. She had four daughters by her 19th birthday, including Howard's mother Helena. Helena was an employee at a Chicago restaurant when she became pregnant with Juwan. Howard's father, Leroy Watson, had just returned from the Army to a phone company job in Chicago. The two married quickly once they realized Helena was pregnant.

head coach|author1=Nick Baumgardner|author2=David Jesse|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=May 22, 2019|accessdate=May 22, 2019}}</ref> He was an assistant coach for the [[Miami Heat]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) from 2013 to 2019. Howard played in the [[NBA]] from 1994 until 2013. \n\nA one-time [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star]] and one-time [[All-NBA]] [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]], he began his NBA career as the fifth overall pick in the [[1994 NBA draft]], selected by the [[Washington Bullets]]. Before he was drafted, he starred as an [[All-American]] on the [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team]]. At Michigan he was part of the [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|Fab Five]] recruiting class of 1991 that reached the finals of the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship]] in [[1992 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1992]] and [[1993 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1993]]. Howard won his first NBA championship with Miami in the [[2012 NBA Finals]] and his second NBA championship in the [[2013 NBA Finals]].\n\nHoward was an All-American [[center (basketball)|center]] and an [[honors student]] at [[Chicago Vocational Career Academy]]. Michigan was able to sign him early over numerous competing offers and then convince others in his recruiting class to join him. The Fab Five, which included [[Chris Webber]], [[Jalen Rose]], [[Jimmy King]] and [[Ray Jackson (basketball)|Ray Jackson]], served as regular [[starting lineup|starters]] during their freshman and sophomore years for the [[1991\u201392 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|1991\u201392]] and [[1992\u201393 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|1992\u201393 Wolverines]]. Howard was the last member of the Fab Five to remain active as a professional basketball player. Although many of the Wolverines' accomplishments from 1992 to 1998 were forfeited due to the [[University of Michigan basketball scandal]], which involved booster payments to players to [[Money laundering|launder money]] from illegal gambling, Howard's [[1994 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|1993\u201394 All-American]] season continues to be recognized.\n\nHoward played six-and-a-half seasons (1994\u20132001) for the Bullets franchise (renamed the Wizards in 1997), three full seasons (2004\u201307) for the [[Houston Rockets]], two plus seasons for the Heat and shorter stints for several other teams. During his rookie year with the Bullets, he became the first player to [[#Graduation|graduate on time]] with his class after leaving college early to play in the NBA. After one season as an [[NBA All-Rookie Team|All-Rookie]] player and a second as an All-Star and an All-NBA performer, he became the first NBA player to sign a $100&nbsp;million contract. While he continued to be a productive starter, he was never again selected to play in an All-Star Game. Towards the end of his contract, he was traded at the NBA trade deadline twice to make [[salary cap]] room. He was most recently a regular starter during the [[2005\u201306 NBA season]]. In 2010, he signed with the Heat and entered his 17th NBA season, during which he reached the playoffs for the sixth time and made his first career [[2011 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] appearance. He remained with the Heat the following season and won his first NBA championship during the 2012 NBA Finals. He returned to the Heat for part of the following season, and won a second championship. Howard has developed a reputation as a humanitarian for his civic commitment.\n\n==Early life==\nHoward's grandmother, Jannie Mae Howard, was the daughter of [[sharecropper]]s from [[Belzoni, Mississippi]]. She had four daughters by her 19th birthday, including Howard's mother Helena. Helena was an employee at a Chicago restaurant when she became pregnant with Juwan. Howard's father, Leroy Watson, had just returned from the Army to a phone company job in Chicago. The two married quickly once they realized Helena was pregnant.
