As the decade began, Tory [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] led parliament.  Wellington's government fell in late 1830, failing to react to calls for reform.<ref>Holmes (2002). p. 283.</ref> The Whigs selected [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey]] to succeed him, who led passage of many reforms, including the [[Reform Act 1832]], the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]] (abolishing slavery throughout the [[British Empire]]), and the [[Factory Acts]] (limiting [[Child labor|child labour]]).\n\nIn 1834 Grey retired from public life, leaving [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]] as his successor. Reforms continued under Lord Melbourne, with the  [[Poor Law Amendment Act]] in 1834, which stated that no able-bodied British man could receive assistance unless he entered a [[workhouse]].  [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]]'s opposition to the Whigs' reforming ways led him to dismiss Melbourne in November and then appoint Sir [[Robert Peel]] to form a Tory government. Peel's failure to win a House of Commons majority in the resulting [[1835 United Kingdom general election|general election]] (January 1835) made it impossible for him to govern, and the Whigs returned to power under Melbourne in April 1835.  The [[Marriage Act 1836]] established [[civil marriage]] and registration systems that permit marriages in [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] chapels, and a [[Registrar General]] of Births, Marriages, and Deaths.<ref>[[wikisource:1836 (33) Registration of Births &c.

In May and June 1831 in Wales, coal miners and others rioted for improved working conditions in what was known as the [[Merthyr Rising 1831|Merthyr Rising]]. [[William Howley]] [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] has his coach attacked by an angry mob on his first official visit to [[Canterbury]] in 1832.  In 1834, [[Robert Owen]] organized the [[Grand National Consolidated Trades Union]], an early attempt to form a national [[union confederation]].  In May [[1838]], the [[Chartism|People's Charter]] was drawn up in the [[United Kingdom]], demanding [[universal suffrage]].  Chartism continued to gain popularity, leading to the [[Newport Rising]] in 1839, the last large-scale armed rebellion against authority in mainland Britain.\n\nIn 1835, [[James Pratt and John Smith]] were [[hanging|hanged]] outside [[Newgate Prison]] in London after a conviction of [[sodomy]], the last deadly victims of the judicial [[persecution]] of [[homosexual men]] in England.<ref>See [http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/newgate.html] 2012</ref>\n\n=== Western Europe ===\n\n==== Germany ====\n* [[May 30]], [[1832]] \u2013 Germany: [[Hambacher Fest]], a demonstration for [[civil liberties]] and national unity, ends with no result.\n* [[December 14]], [[1833]] \u2013 [[Kaspar Hauser]], a mysterious German youth, is stabbed, dying three days later on [[December 17]].\n* [[January 1]], [[1834]] \u2013 [[Zollverein]]: [[Customs (tax)|Customs]] charges are abolished at borders within [[Germany]].\n* [[October 13]], [[1836]] \u2013 [[Theodor Fliedner]], a [[Lutheran]] minister, and Friederike, his wife, open the [[Deaconess#Modern history|Deaconess]] Home and Hospital at [[D\u00fcsseldorf-Kaiserswerth|Kaiserswerth]], [[Germany]], as an institute to train women in [[nursing]].\n* The 5th century BC [[Berlin Foundry Cup]] is acquired for the [[Antikensammlung Berlin]] in Germany.\n\n==== Austria ====\n* [[March 2]], [[1835]] \u2013 [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand]] becomes Emperor of [[Austria]].\n\n==== Switzerland ====\n* October \u2013 Start of the [[Restoration and Regeneration (Switzerland)#End of the Restoration|Regeneration in Switzerland]]: more liberal constitutions adopted in most [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]].\n* [[August 3]], [[1833]] \u2013 In [[Switzerland]], troops of the [[Basel-Stadt|city of Basel]] march on rebels in [[Liestal]], but are beaten back at the Battle of H\u00fclftenschanz.\n* [[August 26]], [[1833]] \u2013 The [[Canton of Basel]] is partitioned by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] ''[[Tagsatzung]]'', to create the two [[Cantons of Switzerland|half-cantons]] of [[Basel-City]] and [[Basel-Country]].\n\n==== Belgium ====\n{{main|Belgian Revolution|Siege of Antwerp (1832)}}\n* [[August 25]], [[1830]] \u2013 The [[Belgian Revolution]] begins.\n* [[September 27]], [[1830]] \u2013 The [[Belgian Revolution]] ends by liberating Brussels from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.\n* [[October 4]], [[1830]] \u2013 The Provisional Government in [[Brussels]] [[Belgian Revolution|declares]] the creation of the independent state of [[Belgium]], in revolt against the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]].\n* [[December 20]], [[1830]] \u2013 The independence of [[Belgium]] is recognized by the [[Great Power]]s.\n* [[July 21]], [[1831]] \u2013 [[Leopold I of Belgium]] is inaugurated as first king of the [[Belgium|Belgians]].\n* [[August 2]], [[1831]] \u2013 The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Ten days campaign|ten-day campaign]] in [[Belgium]] is halted by a [[France|French]] army.\n* [[December 4]], [[1832]] \u2013 Battle of Antwerp: The last remaining [[Netherlands|Dutch]] enforcement, the [[citadel]], is under [[France|French]] attack.\n* [[December 23]], [[1832]] \u2013 The Battle of Antwerp ends with the [[Netherlands]] losing the city.\n* [[1839]] \u2013 Half of the [[Province of Limburg (1815\u20131839)|Limburg]] province of [[Belgium]] is added to the [[Netherlands]] (since 1839 there is a [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian Limburg]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch Limburg]]).\n* [[April 19]], [[1839]] \u2013 The [[Treaty of London, 1839|Treaty of London]] establishes [[Belgium]] as a [[monarchy|kingdom]].\n\n==== France ====\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix - La libert\u00e9 guidant le peuple.jpg|right|thumb|[[July Revolution|French Revolution of 1830]]]]\n\n===== French Revolution of 1830 =====\nThe French Revolution of 1830 was also known as the [[July Revolution]], Second French Revolution or {{lang|fr|Trois Glorieuses}} in French.

The revolution ended the [[Bourbon Restoration]], shifting power to the [[July Monarchy]] (rule by the [[House of Orl\u00e9ans]]). [[Achille L\u00e9once Victor Charles, duc de Broglie|Duc de Broglie]] briefly served as [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]], with many successors over the course of the decade.\n\n===== Canut revolts =====\nThe first two [[Canut revolts]] occurred in the 1830s. They were among the first well-defined worker uprisings of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The word [[Canut]] was a common term to describe to all Lyonnais silk workers.\n\nThe First Canut revolt in 1831 was provoked by a drop in workers' wages caused by a drop in silk prices. After a bloody battle with the military causing 600 casualties, rebellious silk workers seize [[Lyon]], France. The government sent Marshal [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult]], a veteran of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], at the head of an army of 20,000 to restore order. Soult was able to retake the town without any bloodshed, and without making any compromises with the workers.  The Second Canut revolt in 1834 occurred when owners attempted to impose a wage decrease. The government crushed the rebellion in a bloody battle, and deported or imprisoned 10,000 insurgents.\n\n===== Other events =====\n* [[June 5]] \u2013 [[June 6|6]], [[1832]] \u2013 [[History of France|France]]: [[June Rebellion]], anti-[[monarchist]] riots, chiefly by students, in [[Paris]].\n* [[1835]] \u2013 The [[French language|French]] word for their language changes to ''fran\u00e7ais'', from ''fran\u00e7ois''.\n\n=== Southern Europe ===\n\n==== Ottoman Empire (Balkans) ====\n{{main|Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire}}\n\n* [[March 29]], [[1831]] \u2013 The [[Great Bosnian uprising]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] breaks out.\n* April \u2013 Sultan [[Mahmud II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] dies.\n* [[July 1]], [[1839]] \u2013 [[Abd-ul-Mejid I]] (1839\u2013[[1861]]) succeeds [[Mahmud II]] ([[1808]]\u20131839) as [[Ottoman Emperor]].\n* [[1839]] \u2013 The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], backed by the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Austrian Empire]], compels [[July Monarchy]] France to abandon [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], and it forces him to return [[Syria]] and [[Arabia]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n* [[1839]] \u2013 [[Tanzimat]] starts in the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\n==== Greece ====\n* [[February 3]], [[1830]] \u2013 [[Greece]] is liberated from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces as the final result of the [[Greek War of Independence]].\n* [[July 20]], [[1830]] \u2013 [[Greece]] grants citizenship to [[Jew]]s.\n* [[May 7]], [[1832]] \u2013 The [[Treaty of London, 1832|Treaty of London]] creates an independent [[Monarchy|Kingdom]] of [[Greece]].
