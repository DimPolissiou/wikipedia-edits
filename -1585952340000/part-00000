Long accustomed to eating a minimal diet, the Rebbe stopped eating altogether and died on September 12, 1883 (11 [[Elul]] 5643).

Originally, the pizzas were served in a single long package (a piece of corrugated cardboard in 2-by-1 proportions, with two square pizzas, placed side by side, then slid into a form-fitting paper sleeve that was folded and stapled closed).

Originally, the pizzas were served in a single long package (a piece of corrugated cardboard in 2-by-1 proportions, with two square pizzas, placed side by side, then slid into a form-fitting paper sleeve that was folded and stapled closed).

He was the first of nine children born to Dragomir and Katarina Velimirovi\u0107 (n\u00e9e Filipovi\u0107), pious farmers. Being very weak, he was baptised soon after his birth in the [[\u0106elije monastery]], where his relics are now resting. He was given the name Nikola because [[Saint Nicholas]] was the family's patron saint. The first lessons about God, Jesus Christ, the lives of the saints and the holy days of the Church year were provided to him by his mother, who also regularly took him to the \u0106elije monastery for prayer and [[Holy Communion]].<ref name=\"cohp\">{{Cite web|url=http://orthodoxcanada.ca/Saint_Nikolaj_(Velimirovic)|title=Saint Nikolaj (Velimirovic) - Canadian Orthodox History Project|website=orthodoxcanada.ca|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\n[[File:St. Nikolaj Velimirovi\u0107 as a student.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Velimirovi\u0107 as a student]]\nHis formal education also began in the \u0106elije monastery and continued in Valjevo. He applied for admission into the Military Academy, but was refused because he didn't pass the physical exam. He was admitted to the Seminary of Saint Sava in [[Belgrade]], where, apart from the standard subjects, he explored a significant number of writings of both Eastern and Western authors, such as Shakespeare, Voltaire, Nietzsche, Marx, Pushkin, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and others.<ref>Milorad Tomani\u0107, Srpska crkva u ratu i ratovi u njoj, p45</ref> He graduated in 1905.<ref name=cohp/>\n\nNikola had been chosen to become a professor in the Seminary of Saint Sava, but it was decided that he needed to pursue further Orthodox studies before becoming a teacher. As an outstanding student, he was chosen to continue his studies in Russia and Western Europe. He had a gift for languages and soon possessed a good knowledge of Russian, French and German. He attended the Theological Academy in St. Petersburg and then he went to [[Switzerland]] and obtained his doctorate of divinity from the Old Catholic Theological Faculty at the [[University of Berne]].<ref name=cohp/> He received his doctorate in Theology in 1908, with the dissertation entitled ''Faith in the Resurrection of Christ as the Foundation of the Dogmas of the Apostolic Church''. This original work was written in German and published in Switzerland in 1910, and later translated into Serbian. The dissertation for his [[Doctorate|doctor's degree]] in philosophy was prepared at Oxford and defended in Geneva, in French. The title was ''Berkeley's Philosophy''.\n\n===Monastic life===\nIn the autumn of 1909, Nikola returned home and became seriously ill with [[dysentery]]. He decided that if he recovered he would become a monk and devote his life to God. At the end of 1909 his health got better and he was tonsured a monk, receiving the name '''Nikolaj'''.<ref name=\"OCA\">''[http://oca.org/saints/lives/2013/03/18/100825-repose-of-st-nicholas-of-zhicha Repose of St Nicholas of Zhicha].'' OCA - Lives of the Saints.</ref>  He was soon ordained a [[hieromonk]] and then elevated to the rank of [[Archimandrite]]. In 1910 he was entrusted with a mission to Great Britain in order to gain the co-operation of the Church of England in educating the young students who had been evacuated when the Austrian, German and Bulgarian forces threatened to overwhelm the country.\n\n===Studies in Russia===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nIt was decided that he needed to accomplish Orthodox studies before becoming a teacher. As was the custom in those days, he was sent to [[Imperial Russia]] to continue his studies. After his return to Belgrade in 1911, when he was thirty-one years old, he was appointed to the [[University of Belgrade]]'s Academy of Theology, teaching philosophy, logic, history and foreign languages. His talks and sermons were read avidly throughout Serbia. This was partly because his exposition of the Christian faith was inspired by the life of St. Sava, the national patron saint of Serbia. In the Church itself he had only the authority of his words and personality: he was just a monk, but even so he seemed destined to exert great influence. One of his students in Belgrade was [[Justin Popovi\u0107]]. \n\n===Missions during World War I===\n{{Refimprove section|date=August 2018}}\nIn his lifetime, Father Nikolaj visited the [[United States|USA]] four times. He visited Britain in 1910. He studied English and was capable of addressing an audience and making a strong impression on the listeners. Shortly after the outbreak of World War I this contributed to his appointment by the Serbian government to a mission in the United States. In 1915, as an unknown Serbian monk, he toured most of the major U.S. cities, where he held numerous lectures, fighting for the union of the Serbs and South Slavic peoples. This mission gained ground: America sent over 20,000 volunteers to Europe, most of whom later fought on the [[Salonika Front]]. During Velimirovi\u0107's US-campaign occurred the great retreat of the Serbian Army through the mountains of [[Albania]]. He embarked home in 1916; as his country was now in enemy hands, he went to Britain instead. His eloquence and character made him an unofficial spokesman of his people. His success was such that not only did he fulfill his mission, but he was also awarded a [[Doctor of Divinity|Doctorate of Divinity]] ''[[honoris causa]]'' from the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref name=\"bank\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=SHl7CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA267&dq=Nikolaj+Velimirovi%C4%87&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjAs_2XzdbcAhVsp1kKHXuMC1o4FBDoAQhjMAk#v=onepage&q=Nikolaj%20Velimirovi%C4%87&f=false Bank, Jan and Gevers, Lieve.

He also preached in the Episcopal chapel, where his practical discourse attracted many hearers. Velimirovi\u0107 became celebrated. At the same time he was active in the promotion of the Serbian Relief Fund and was successful in obtaining a university education for Serb students, several of whom, including Bishop Irinej of [[Dalmatia]], took their degrees before they returned to their own country after the war. In 1918, Velimirovi\u0107 returned to the United States for a second visit, but as a celebrity who was to address the American people as a whole on behalf of Serbian relief. \n\nIn 1919 he received another Honorary Doctorate of Divinity from the [[University of Glasgow]]. From Glasgow his repute as a theological scholar and preacher spread throughout the United Kingdom. After the war, he returned to Belgrade in April 1919.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Bishop===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nIn 1919, [[Archimandrite]] Nikolaj was consecrated [[Bishop of \u017di\u010da]]<ref name=bank/> but did not remain long in that diocese, being asked to take over the office of Bishop in the Eparchy of Ohrid (1920-1931) and [[Eparchy of Ohrid and Bitola]] (1931-1936) in southern parts of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. Whether that was his own wish is not clear. It was in a way a mission post for the people of the lately recovered Serbian territory were backward and there were still vestiges of the Ottoman days still prevailing in habit, pagan superstition and even black magic.\n\nThe percentage of illiteracy was very high and the population was for the most part very poor. He had many difficulties there but a great number of humble folk became attached to him and felt that even to touch his hand was to receive a blessing. For many years his seat was the ancient monastery of Sveti Naum at the south end of the Lake Ohrid. It was there that he wrote ''Ohridski Prologue''. In 1920, for the third time, he journeyed again to the United States, this time on a mission to organize the Serbian Orthodox Diocese of North America.\n''The Outlook'' Magazine carried a story about Bishop Nikolaj after visiting the United States in their 23 February 1921 issue (pp.&nbsp;285\u201386):\n\n<blockquote>He is Bishop of Ohrid, near the Albanian border, and is a popular and beloved leader of the Serbian Orthodox Church.  Last summer an American accompanied him on a journey into the mountains, where he was to preach in a remote village church. They found the roads lined for twenty-five miles with men, women and children, who had journeyed far on foot to greet him, and in the mountain church the densely packed people had been standing all through the night...{{cn|date=August 2018}}</blockquote> \n\nFinally, in 1927, he came to the U.S. once more, to speak before the Institute of Politics in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]]. A reporter covering the event, wrote:\n\n<blockquote>His black monk's robe, his long black beard, and his dark, living eyes, set in an oval Slavic face, gave him an appearance which contrasted as strongly with that of conventionally dressed professors and diplomats as did his views of the common problems of world peace contrast with theirs. His charm and urbanity of manner, the completeness of his grasp upon international problems only emphasized the difference in his thought....Bishop Nikolaj, speaking from the point of view of a civilization in which men still are more important than institutions, points out that peace or war is a matter of the way men think and feel toward each other, and that all other things are only outgrowths of this. The greatest force for affecting men's attitudes toward each other he believes would be a reunited Christian Church (Living Age, Vol. 335-36, 1928-29).</blockquote>\n\nIn 1935, he reconstructed the cemetery of the fallen German soldiers from World War I in [[Bitola]]. During the [[Milan Stojadinovi\u0107]] administration when the Patriarchate became vacant (after the poisoning of Patriarch Varnava and the failed attempt at ratifying a [[Concordat]] with the [[Holy See|Vatican]]) he was reportedly an obvious choice but allegedly too greatly identified with the democratic idealism of England and the United States of America (places he frequently visited) while Stojadinovi\u0107 leaned towards Germany and Italy.\n\nStill, except for his unwavering opposition to Communism, there was very little that could be labelled \"political\" in Velimirovi\u0107's ministrations and writings. The most that could be said was that he strove to keep Serbia alive after it had been merged into the larger state of Yugoslavia. He started a movement for the renewal and care of the old churches, shrines and cemeteries in Macedonia. It had been at his suggestion that the large illustrated volume ''South Slav Monuments'' was compiled and then published in London, and when he was made Bishop of Ohrid he began that work of restoration which still continues to this day.\n\n===The 1930s===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nIn 1936, he finally resumed his original office of Bishop in the [[Eparchy of \u017di\u010da]], returning to the [[Monastery of \u017di\u010da]] not far distant from [[Valjevo]] and Leli\u0107, where he was born. At \u017di\u010da he started a movement for the revival of the Serb Church, evoking the inspiration of its patron saint [[Saint Sava]]. He seldom gave a sermon without mentioning the saint's name. Eventually in exile he wrote the only substantial biography of [[St. Sava]] which we have. In the years preceding the outbreak of World War II, Velimirovi\u0107, continuing his campaign for a Serb revival, instituted what may be called a ''Society of Prayer'' and renewed the ancient custom of Christians gathering together to visit a friend's house for prayer, in that way making Christianity social rather than individualistic and solitary. This social prayer extended over a large area and drew national attention. It was described in the newspapers, and pictures of the benign and now almost apostolic countenance of Bishop Nikolaj appeared in Sunday editions.\n\n===Detention and imprisonment in World War II===\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2016}}\nDuring [[World War II]], in 1941, as soon as the German forces occupied Yugoslavia, Bishop Nikolaj was arrested by the [[Nazis]] in the [[Monastery]] of [[\u017di\u010da]], after which he was confined in the Monastery of [[Ljubostinja]]. Later he was transferred to the Monastery of [[Vojlovica Monastery|Vojlovica]] (near [[Pan\u010devo]]) in which he was confined together with the [[Serbian Patriarch Gavrilo V]] until the end of 1944. On 15 September 1944, both [[Serbian Patriarch Gavrilo V]] (Do\u017ei\u0107) and Bishop Nikolaj were sent to [[Dachau concentration camp]], which was at that time the main [[Dachau concentration camp#priests|concentration camp for clerics]] arrested by the Nazis. Both Velimirovi\u0107 and Do\u017ei\u0107 were held as ''special prisoners'' (''Ehrenh\u00e4ftlinge'') imprisoned in the so-called ''Ehrenbunker'' (or ''Prominentenbunker'') separated from the work camp area, together with high-ranking [[Nazi]] enemy officers and other prominent prisoners whose arrests had been dictated by Hitler directly.<ref>Leisner, Karl.

From 11 September 1943, he was also made responsible for Albania. In December 1944, Velimirovi\u0107 and Do\u017ei\u0107 were transferred from Dachau to [[Slovenia]], together with [[Milan Nedi\u0107]], the Serbian collaborationist PM, as the [[Nazis]] attempted to make use of Patriarch Gavrilo's and Nikolaj's authority among the Serbs in order to gain allies in the anti-Communist movements. Contrary to claims of torture and abuse at the camp, Patriarch Do\u017ei\u0107 testified himself that both he and Velimirovi\u0107 were treated normally.<ref>Glasnik Pravoslavne Crkve, July 1946, pp 66-67.

He was brought to England. Velimirovi\u0107 and Do\u017ei\u0107 were at [[Westminster Abbey]] at the baptism of King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia]]'s son and heir, [[Crown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia]]. Velimirovi\u0107 preached a very moving sermon at the Serb chapel in the house in [[Egerton Gardens]]. But there was no place for him in England such as there had been during the First World War. Patriarch Gavrilo, being old and ill, returned to what then came to be known as the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], where he died soon after his arrival. Velimirovi\u0107 opted to emigrate to the [[United States]].\n\nHe was allowed to spend the last years of his life in the United States, only returning once to England when he came to consecrate the Church of St Sava in 1952, an occasion when Serbs in the thousands rallied from the mines and factories of England to the walls of the great church in [[Ladbroke Grove]]. The sacred edifice was packed and the overflow crowd streamed all the way to the [[London Underground]], with Velimirovi\u0107's voice sounding through the air on loudspeakers.\n\n===Immigration and Last Years===\nAfter the war he never returned to the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], but after spending some time in Europe, he finally immigrated as a [[refugee]] to the United States in 1946. There, in spite of his health problems, he continued his missionary work, for which he is considered ''An Apostle and Missionary of the New Continent'' (quote by Fr. [[Alexander Schmemann]]), and has also been enlisted as ''an American Saint''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://orthodoxwiki.org/List_of_American_saints|title=List of American Orthodox saints |website=OrthodoxWiki.org |date=2015-06-05 |accessdate=30 March 2016}}</ref> and included on the icons and frescoes ''All American Saints''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conciliarpress.com/all-american-saints-large-icon.html|title=Archived copy|accessdate=30 June 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716110848/http://www.conciliarpress.com/all-american-saints-large-icon.html|archivedate=16 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/a_whistling_train/3480689583/in/set-72057594132248985|title=All Saints of North America &#124; Flickr - Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr|date=27 April 2009|accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nHe taught at several [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] [[seminary|seminaries]] such as St. Sava's Seminary ([[Libertyville, Illinois]]), [[Saint Tikhon's Orthodox Theological Seminary]] and Monastery ([[South Canaan, Pennsylvania]]), and [[St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary]] (now in [[Crestwood, New York]]).\n\n==Posthumous==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}\nVelimirovi\u0107 died on 18 March 1956, while in prayer at the foot of his bed before the Liturgy, at the Russian Orthodox Monastery of St. Tikhon in [[South Canaan Township, Wayne County, Pennsylvania]] in the United States.

An interview that Jovan Byford conducted with Mladen Obradovi\u0107 (leader of Serbian far-right political organization [[Obraz (organization)|Obraz]]) may suggest that this explanation still persists among some members of [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] society.

He was the first of nine children born to Dragomir and Katarina Velimirovi\u0107 (n\u00e9e Filipovi\u0107), pious farmers. Being very weak, he was baptised soon after his birth in the [[\u0106elije monastery]], where his relics are now resting. He was given the name Nikola because [[Saint Nicholas]] was the family's patron saint. The first lessons about God, Jesus Christ, the lives of the saints and the holy days of the Church year were provided to him by his mother, who also regularly took him to the \u0106elije monastery for prayer and [[Holy Communion]].<ref name=\"cohp\">{{Cite web|url=http://orthodoxcanada.ca/Saint_Nikolaj_(Velimirovic)|title=Saint Nikolaj (Velimirovic) - Canadian Orthodox History Project|website=orthodoxcanada.ca|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\n[[File:St. Nikolaj Velimirovi\u0107 as a student.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Velimirovi\u0107 as a student]]\nHis formal education also began in the \u0106elije monastery and continued in Valjevo. He applied for admission into the Military Academy, but was refused because he didn't pass the physical exam. He was admitted to the Seminary of Saint Sava in [[Belgrade]], where, apart from the standard subjects, he explored a significant number of writings of both Eastern and Western authors, such as Shakespeare, Voltaire, Nietzsche, Marx, Pushkin, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and others.<ref>Milorad Tomani\u0107, Srpska crkva u ratu i ratovi u njoj, p45</ref> He graduated in 1905.<ref name=cohp/>\n\nNikola had been chosen to become a professor in the Seminary of Saint Sava, but it was decided that he needed to pursue further Orthodox studies before becoming a teacher. As an outstanding student, he was chosen to continue his studies in Russia and Western Europe. He had a gift for languages and soon possessed a good knowledge of Russian, French and German. He attended the Theological Academy in St. Petersburg and then he went to [[Switzerland]] and obtained his doctorate of divinity from the Old Catholic Theological Faculty at the [[University of Berne]].<ref name=cohp/> He received his doctorate in Theology in 1908, with the dissertation entitled ''Faith in the Resurrection of Christ as the Foundation of the Dogmas of the Apostolic Church''. This original work was written in German and published in Switzerland in 1910, and later translated into Serbian. The dissertation for his [[Doctorate|doctor's degree]] in philosophy was prepared at Oxford and defended in Geneva, in French. The title was ''Berkeley's Philosophy''.\n\n===Monastic life===\nIn the autumn of 1909, Nikola returned home and became seriously ill with [[dysentery]]. He decided that if he recovered he would become a monk and devote his life to God. At the end of 1909 his health got better and he was tonsured a monk, receiving the name '''Nikolaj'''.<ref name=\"OCA\">''[http://oca.org/saints/lives/2013/03/18/100825-repose-of-st-nicholas-of-zhicha Repose of St Nicholas of Zhicha].'' OCA - Lives of the Saints.</ref>  He was soon ordained a [[hieromonk]] and then elevated to the rank of [[Archimandrite]]. In 1910 he was entrusted with a mission to Great Britain in order to gain the co-operation of the Church of England in educating the young students who had been evacuated when the Austrian, German and Bulgarian forces threatened to overwhelm the country.\n\n===Studies in Russia===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nIt was decided that he needed to accomplish Orthodox studies before becoming a teacher. As was the custom in those days, he was sent to [[Imperial Russia]] to continue his studies. After his return to Belgrade in 1911, when he was thirty-one years old, he was appointed to the [[University of Belgrade]]'s Academy of Theology, teaching philosophy, logic, history and foreign languages. His talks and sermons were read avidly throughout Serbia. This was partly because his exposition of the Christian faith was inspired by the life of St. Sava, the national patron saint of Serbia. In the Church itself he had only the authority of his words and personality: he was just a monk, but even so he seemed destined to exert great influence. One of his students in Belgrade was [[Justin Popovi\u0107]]. \n\n===Missions during World War I===\n{{Refimprove section|date=August 2018}}\nIn his lifetime, Father Nikolaj visited the [[United States|USA]] four times. He visited Britain in 1910. He studied English and was capable of addressing an audience and making a strong impression on the listeners. Shortly after the outbreak of World War I this contributed to his appointment by the Serbian government to a mission in the United States. In 1915, as an unknown Serbian monk, he toured most of the major U.S. cities, where he held numerous lectures, fighting for the union of the Serbs and South Slavic peoples. This mission gained ground: America sent over 20,000 volunteers to Europe, most of whom later fought on the [[Salonika Front]]. During Velimirovi\u0107's US-campaign occurred the great retreat of the Serbian Army through the mountains of [[Albania]]. He embarked home in 1916; as his country was now in enemy hands, he went to Britain instead. His eloquence and character made him an unofficial spokesman of his people. His success was such that not only did he fulfill his mission, but he was also awarded a [[Doctor of Divinity|Doctorate of Divinity]] ''[[honoris causa]]'' from the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref name=\"bank\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=SHl7CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA267&dq=Nikolaj+Velimirovi%C4%87&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjAs_2XzdbcAhVsp1kKHXuMC1o4FBDoAQhjMAk#v=onepage&q=Nikolaj%20Velimirovi%C4%87&f=false Bank, Jan and Gevers, Lieve.

He also preached in the Episcopal chapel, where his practical discourse attracted many hearers. Velimirovi\u0107 became celebrated. At the same time he was active in the promotion of the Serbian Relief Fund and was successful in obtaining a university education for Serb students, several of whom, including Bishop Irinej of [[Dalmatia]], took their degrees before they returned to their own country after the war. In 1918, Velimirovi\u0107 returned to the United States for a second visit, but as a celebrity who was to address the American people as a whole on behalf of Serbian relief. \n\nIn 1919 he received another Honorary Doctorate of Divinity from the [[University of Glasgow]]. From Glasgow his repute as a theological scholar and preacher spread throughout the United Kingdom. After the war, he returned to Belgrade in April 1919.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Bishop===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nIn 1919, [[Archimandrite]] Nikolaj was consecrated [[Bishop of \u017di\u010da]]<ref name=bank/> but did not remain long in that diocese, being asked to take over the office of Bishop in the Eparchy of Ohrid (1920-1931) and [[Eparchy of Ohrid and Bitola]] (1931-1936) in southern parts of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. Whether that was his own wish is not clear. It was in a way a mission post for the people of the lately recovered Serbian territory were backward and there were still vestiges of the Ottoman days still prevailing in habit, pagan superstition and even black magic.\n\nThe percentage of illiteracy was very high and the population was for the most part very poor. He had many difficulties there but a great number of humble folk became attached to him and felt that even to touch his hand was to receive a blessing. For many years his seat was the ancient monastery of Sveti Naum at the south end of the Lake Ohrid. It was there that he wrote ''Ohridski Prologue''. In 1920, for the third time, he journeyed again to the United States, this time on a mission to organize the Serbian Orthodox Diocese of North America.\n''The Outlook'' Magazine carried a story about Bishop Nikolaj after visiting the United States in their 23 February 1921 issue (pp.&nbsp;285\u201386):\n\n<blockquote>He is Bishop of Ohrid, near the Albanian border, and is a popular and beloved leader of the Serbian Orthodox Church.  Last summer an American accompanied him on a journey into the mountains, where he was to preach in a remote village church. They found the roads lined for twenty-five miles with men, women and children, who had journeyed far on foot to greet him, and in the mountain church the densely packed people had been standing all through the night...{{cn|date=August 2018}}</blockquote> \n\nFinally, in 1927, he came to the U.S. once more, to speak before the Institute of Politics in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]]. A reporter covering the event, wrote:\n\n<blockquote>His black monk's robe, his long black beard, and his dark, living eyes, set in an oval Slavic face, gave him an appearance which contrasted as strongly with that of conventionally dressed professors and diplomats as did his views of the common problems of world peace contrast with theirs. His charm and urbanity of manner, the completeness of his grasp upon international problems only emphasized the difference in his thought....Bishop Nikolaj, speaking from the point of view of a civilization in which men still are more important than institutions, points out that peace or war is a matter of the way men think and feel toward each other, and that all other things are only outgrowths of this. The greatest force for affecting men's attitudes toward each other he believes would be a reunited Christian Church (Living Age, Vol. 335-36, 1928-29).</blockquote>\n\nIn 1935, he reconstructed the cemetery of the fallen German soldiers from World War I in [[Bitola]]. During the [[Milan Stojadinovi\u0107]] administration when the Patriarchate became vacant (after the poisoning of Patriarch Varnava and the failed attempt at ratifying a [[Concordat]] with the [[Holy See|Vatican]]) he was reportedly an obvious choice but allegedly too greatly identified with the democratic idealism of England and the United States of America (places he frequently visited) while Stojadinovi\u0107 leaned towards Germany and Italy.\n\nStill, except for his unwavering opposition to Communism, there was very little that could be labelled \"political\" in Velimirovi\u0107's ministrations and writings. The most that could be said was that he strove to keep Serbia alive after it had been merged into the larger state of Yugoslavia. He started a movement for the renewal and care of the old churches, shrines and cemeteries in Macedonia. It had been at his suggestion that the large illustrated volume ''South Slav Monuments'' was compiled and then published in London, and when he was made Bishop of Ohrid he began that work of restoration which still continues to this day.\n\n===The 1930s===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nIn 1936, he finally resumed his original office of Bishop in the [[Eparchy of \u017di\u010da]], returning to the [[Monastery of \u017di\u010da]] not far distant from [[Valjevo]] and Leli\u0107, where he was born. At \u017di\u010da he started a movement for the revival of the Serb Church, evoking the inspiration of its patron saint [[Saint Sava]]. He seldom gave a sermon without mentioning the saint's name. Eventually in exile he wrote the only substantial biography of [[St. Sava]] which we have. In the years preceding the outbreak of World War II, Velimirovi\u0107, continuing his campaign for a Serb revival, instituted what may be called a ''Society of Prayer'' and renewed the ancient custom of Christians gathering together to visit a friend's house for prayer, in that way making Christianity social rather than individualistic and solitary. This social prayer extended over a large area and drew national attention. It was described in the newspapers, and pictures of the benign and now almost apostolic countenance of Bishop Nikolaj appeared in Sunday editions.\n\n===Detention and imprisonment in World War II===\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2016}}\nDuring [[World War II]], in 1941, as soon as the German forces occupied Yugoslavia, Bishop Nikolaj was arrested by the [[Nazis]] in the [[Monastery]] of [[\u017di\u010da]], after which he was confined in the Monastery of [[Ljubostinja]]. Later he was transferred to the Monastery of [[Vojlovica Monastery|Vojlovica]] (near [[Pan\u010devo]]) in which he was confined together with the [[Serbian Patriarch Gavrilo V]] until the end of 1944. On 15 September 1944, both [[Serbian Patriarch Gavrilo V]] (Do\u017ei\u0107) and Bishop Nikolaj were sent to [[Dachau concentration camp]], which was at that time the main [[Dachau concentration camp#priests|concentration camp for clerics]] arrested by the Nazis. Both Velimirovi\u0107 and Do\u017ei\u0107 were held as ''special prisoners'' (''Ehrenh\u00e4ftlinge'') imprisoned in the so-called ''Ehrenbunker'' (or ''Prominentenbunker'') separated from the work camp area, together with high-ranking [[Nazi]] enemy officers and other prominent prisoners whose arrests had been dictated by Hitler directly.<ref>Leisner, Karl.

From 11 September 1943, he was also made responsible for Albania. In December 1944, Velimirovi\u0107 and Do\u017ei\u0107 were transferred from Dachau to [[Slovenia]], together with [[Milan Nedi\u0107]], the Serbian collaborationist PM, as the [[Nazis]] attempted to make use of Patriarch Gavrilo's and Nikolaj's authority among the Serbs in order to gain allies in the anti-Communist movements. Contrary to claims of torture and abuse at the camp, Patriarch Do\u017ei\u0107 testified himself that both he and Velimirovi\u0107 were treated normally.<ref>Glasnik Pravoslavne Crkve, July 1946, pp 66-67. Also in Do\u017ei\u0107 G., Memoari patrijarha srpskog Gavrila (Beograd: Sfairos 1990), entries for December 1944.</ref>\n\nLater, Velimirovi\u0107 and Patriarch Gavrilo (Do\u017ei\u0107) were moved to [[Austria]], and were finally liberated by the US [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Infantry Division]] in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] in 1945.<ref name=cohp/> He was physically weakened by these vicissitudes. He was brought to England. Velimirovi\u0107 and Do\u017ei\u0107 were at [[Westminster Abbey]] at the baptism of King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia]]'s son and heir, [[Crown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia]]. Velimirovi\u0107 preached a very moving sermon at the Serb chapel in the house in [[Egerton Gardens]]. But there was no place for him in England such as there had been during the First World War. Patriarch Gavrilo, being old and ill, returned to what then came to be known as the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], where he died soon after his arrival. Velimirovi\u0107 opted to emigrate to the [[United States]].\n\nHe was allowed to spend the last years of his life in the United States, only returning once to England when he came to consecrate the Church of St Sava in 1952, an occasion when Serbs in the thousands rallied from the mines and factories of England to the walls of the great church in [[Ladbroke Grove]]. The sacred edifice was packed and the overflow crowd streamed all the way to the [[London Underground]], with Velimirovi\u0107's voice sounding through the air on loudspeakers.\n\n===Immigration and Last Years===\nAfter the war he never returned to the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], but after spending some time in Europe, he finally immigrated as a [[refugee]] to the United States in 1946. There, in spite of his health problems, he continued his missionary work, for which he is considered ''An Apostle and Missionary of the New Continent'' (quote by Fr. [[Alexander Schmemann]]), and has also been enlisted as ''an American Saint''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://orthodoxwiki.org/List_of_American_saints|title=List of American Orthodox saints |website=OrthodoxWiki.org |date=2015-06-05 |accessdate=30 March 2016}}</ref> and included on the icons and frescoes ''All American Saints''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conciliarpress.com/all-american-saints-large-icon.html|title=Archived copy|accessdate=30 June 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716110848/http://www.conciliarpress.com/all-american-saints-large-icon.html|archivedate=16 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/a_whistling_train/3480689583/in/set-72057594132248985|title=All Saints of North America &#124; Flickr - Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr|date=27 April 2009|accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nHe taught at several [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] [[seminary|seminaries]] such as St. Sava's Seminary ([[Libertyville, Illinois]]), [[Saint Tikhon's Orthodox Theological Seminary]] and Monastery ([[South Canaan, Pennsylvania]]), and [[St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary]] (now in [[Crestwood, New York]]).\n\n==Posthumous==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}\nVelimirovi\u0107 died on 18 March 1956, while in prayer at the foot of his bed before the Liturgy, at the Russian Orthodox Monastery of St. Tikhon in [[South Canaan Township, Wayne County, Pennsylvania]] in the United States.

An interview that Jovan Byford conducted with Mladen Obradovi\u0107 (leader of Serbian far-right political organization [[Obraz (organization)|Obraz]]) may suggest that this explanation still persists among some members of [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] society. A contemporary defender of Velimirovi\u0107's reputation and [[saint]] status, Obradovi\u0107 defends the antisemitic writings of Velimimirovi\u0107 by stating that Velimirovi\u0107's words only echo what had been written in early Christian texts:<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Denial and Repression of Antisemitism: Post-Communist Remembrance of the Serbian Bishop Nikolaj Velimirovi\u0107|last=Byford|first=Jovan|publisher=Central European University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=175|quote=|via=}}</ref> \n\n<blockquote>You have the very words of the Lord Jesus Christ when he says to the Pharisees that they are a \"brood of vipers\" or that their father is the Devil; Bishop Nikolaj merely quotes the Gospels.<ref name=\":1\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn a speech delivered in 1936 at the \u017dica Monastery in Serbia, Velimirovi\u0107 spoke out against what he perceived to be a Jewish threat to Christianity in front of a distinguished audience that included Yugoslavian Prime Minister [[Milan Stojadinovi\u0107]].

The shows document the personal and professional lives of several [[hip hop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] musicians, performers, managers, and record producers residing in various [[metropolitan area]]s of the United States. The original franchise version, ''[[Love & Hip Hop: New York]]'', premiered on March 6, 2011. Its success resulted in [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] based in [[Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta|Atlanta]], [[Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood|Hollywood]], and [[Love & Hip Hop: Miami|Miami]].\n\nThe series is known for its sprawling ensemble cast, with over 200 cast members. Many are notable figures in hip hop, including [[Jim Jones (rapper)|Jim Jones]], [[Remy Ma]], [[Soulja Boy]], [[Waka Flocka Flame]], [[Lil Scrappy]], [[Trina]] and [[Trick Daddy]], as well as R&B artists like [[Ray J]], [[Keyshia Cole]] and [[Stevie J]].
