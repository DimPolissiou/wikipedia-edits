The French set up Catholic villages in the Mississippi River region, notably, [[St. Louis]] and [[New Orleans]]. Some English Catholics settled in Maryland.  In 1789 the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore|Archdiocese of Baltimore]] was the first diocese in the newly independent nation.  [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] became the first American bishop. His brother [[Daniel Carroll]] was the leading Catholic among the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. George Washington in the army and as president set a standard for religious toleration. No religious test was allowed for holding national office, and colonial legal restrictions on Catholics holding office were gradually abolished by the States. However, in the mid-19th century there was political [[anti-Catholicism in the United States]], sponsored by pietistic Protestants fearful of the pope. In the 20th century anti-Catholicism seldom appeared except when a Catholic was running for president as in 1928 and 1960. The number of Catholics grew rapidly in the 19th century through high fertility and immigration, especially from [[Irish Americans|Ireland]], [[German Americans|Germany]], and after 1880, [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Italian Americans|Italy]]. Large scale Catholic immigration from [[Mexico]] began after 1910 and in 2019 Latinos comprise 37 percent of American Catholics.  By 1900 it was the largest denomination. [[Parish]]es set up [[parochial school]]s, and over a hundred [[Jesuit]] and other colleges were established. [[Nun]]s were very active in teaching and hospital work. Since 1960 the percentage of Americans who are Catholic has fallen slowly from about 25% to 22%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.adw.org/2010/12/is-the-bottom-really-falling-out-of-catholic-mass-attendance-a-recent-cara-survey-ponders-the-question/|title=Is the Bottom Really Falling Out of Catholic Mass Attendance?

Each is considered fully equal to the Latin tradition within the Church. In the United States, there are 15 Eastern Church dioceses (called [[Eparchy|eparchies]]) and two Eastern Church archdioceses (or [[Archeparchy|archeparchies]]), the [[Byzantine Catholic Archeparchy of Pittsburgh]] and the [[Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia]].\n\nThe apostolic exarchate for the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church in the United States is headed by a bishop who is a member of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. An apostolic exarchate is the Eastern Catholic Church equivalent of an apostolic vicariate. It is not a full-fledged diocese/eparchy, but is established by the Holy See for the pastoral care of Eastern Catholics in an area outside the territory of the Eastern Catholic Church to which they belong. It is headed by a bishop or a priest with the title of [[Exarch#Modern Eastern Catholic churches|exarch]].\n\nThe [[Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter]] was established January 1, 2012, to serve former Anglican groups and clergy in the United States who sought to become Catholic. Similar to a diocese though national in scope, the ordinariate is based in [[Houston]], Texas, and includes parishes and communities across the United States that are fully Catholic, while retaining elements of their Anglican heritage and traditions.\n\n{{As of|2017}}, 8 dioceses out of 195 are vacant (''[[sede vacante]]''). None of the current bishops or archbishops are past the retirement age of 75.\n\nThe central leadership body of the Catholic Church in the United States is the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]], made up of the hierarchy of [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]] (including [[archbishop]]s) of the United States and the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]], although each bishop is independent in his own [[diocese]], answerable only to the [[Holy See]]. The USCCB elects a president to serve as their administrative head, but he is in no way the \"head\" of the Church or of Catholics in the United States. In addition to the 195 dioceses and one [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Exarchate in the United States|exarchate]]<ref name=exarchate>On July 14, 2010, Pope Benedict XVI erected the [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Exarchate in the United States]].</ref> represented in the USCCB, there are several dioceses in the nation's other four overseas dependencies. In the Commonwealth of [[Puerto Rico]], the bishops in the six dioceses (one [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] [[archdiocese]] and five suffragan dioceses) form their own [[episcopal conference]], the [[Puerto Rican Episcopal Conference]] (''Conferencia Episcopal Puertorrique\u00f1a'').<ref>{{cite web|title=Catholic Church in Puerto Rico|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/country/pr.html |last=Cheney|first=David M. |accessdate=July 27, 2009}}</ref> The bishops in US [[insular area]]s in the [[Pacific Ocean]]\u2014the Commonwealth of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], the Territory of [[American Samoa]], and the Territory of [[Guam]]\u2014are members of the [[Episcopal conference#Episcopal Conferences|Episcopal Conference of the Pacific]].\n\nNo [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] exists for Catholics in the United States. In the 1850s, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore#Prelature|Archdiocese of Baltimore]] was acknowledged a ''Prerogative of Place'', which confers to its archbishop some of the leadership responsibilities granted to primates in other countries. The Archdiocese of Baltimore was the first diocese established in the United States, in 1789, with [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] (1735\u20131815) as its first bishop. It was, for many years, the most influential diocese in the fledgling nation. Now, however, the United States has several large archdioceses and a number of [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]]-archbishops.\n\nBy far, most Catholics in the United States belong to the [[Latin Church|Latin or Western Church]] and the [[Roman Rite]] of the Catholic Church. Rite generally refers to the form of worship (\"liturgical rite\") in a church community owing to cultural and historical differences as well as differences in practice. However, the Vatican II document, ''Orientalium Ecclesiarum'' (\"Of the Eastern Churches\"), acknowledges that these Eastern Catholic communities are \"true Churches\" and not just rites within the Catholic Church.<ref>Richard McBrien, THE CHURCH/THE EVOLUTION OF CATHOLICISM (New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 2009), 450. Also see: BASIC VATICAN COUNCIL II: THE BASIC SIXTEEN DOCUMENTS (Costello Publishing, 1996).</ref> There are 14 other Churches in the United States (23 within the global Catholic Church) which are in communion with Rome, fully recognized and valid in the eyes of the Catholic Church. They have their own bishops and [[eparchy|eparchies]]. The largest of these communities in the U.S. is the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]].<ref name=\"cnewastat\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.cnewa.org/source-images/Roberson-eastcath-statistics/eastcatholic-stat09.pdf\n|author=Ronald Roberson\n|title=The Eastern Catholic Churches 2009\n|publisher=Catholic Near East Welfare Association\n|id=Information sourced from ''Annuario Pontificio'' 2009 edition}} Retrieved November 2009</ref> Most of these Churches are of Eastern European and Middle Eastern origin. Eastern Catholic Churches are distinguished from Eastern Orthodox, identifiable by their usage of the term Catholic.<ref>McBrien, 241,281, 365,450</ref>\n\n==Personnel==\n\nThe Church employs people in a variety of leadership and service roles. Its ministers include ordained clergy ([[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]], [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests. and]] [[deacon]]<nowiki/>s) and non-ordained [[lay ecclesial ministers]], [[theologians]], and [[catechists]].\n\nSome Catholics, both lay and clergy, live in a form of [[consecrated life]], rather than in marriage. This includes a wide range of relationships, from monastic ([[monk]]<nowiki/>s and [[nun]]<nowiki/>s), to mendicant ([[friar]]s and sisters), apostolic (priests, [[Brother (Christian)|brother]][[Brothers|s]], and [[Religious sister (Catholic)|sisters)]], and secular and lay institutes. While many of these also serve in some form of ministry, above, others are in secular careers, within or without the Church. Consecrated life \u2013 in and of itself \u2013 does not make a person a part of the clergy or a minister of the Church.\n\nAdditionally, many lay people are employed in \"secular\" careers in support of Church institutions, including educators, health care professionals, finance and human resources experts, lawyers, and others.\n\n===Bishops===\n\nLeadership of the Catholic Church in the United States is provided by the bishops, individually for their own dioceses and collectively through the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]]. There are some mid-level groupings of bishops, such as ecclesiastical provinces (often covering a state) and the fourteen geographic regions of the USCCB, but these have little significance for most purposes.\n\nThe ordinary office for a bishop is to be the bishop of a particular diocese, its chief pastor and minister, usually geographically defined and incorporating, on average, about 350,000 Catholic Christians. In [[canon law]], the bishop leading a particular diocese, or similar office, is called an \"ordinary\" (i.e., he has complete jurisdiction in this territory or grouping of Christians).\n\nThere are two non-geographic dioceses, called \"ordinariates\", one for [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA|military personnel]] and one for [[List of Catholic dioceses in the United States|former Anglicans]] who are in full communion with the Catholic Church.\n\nDioceses are grouped together geographically into provinces, usually within a state, part of a state, or multiple states together (see map below). A province comprises several dioceses which look to one ordinary bishop (usually of the most populous or historically influential diocese/city) for guidance and leadership. This lead bishop is their [[archbishop]] and his diocese is the [[archdiocese]]. The archbishop is called the \"metropolitan\" bishop who strives to achieve some unanimity of practice with his brother \"suffragan\" bishops.\n\nSome larger dioceses have additional bishops assisting the diocesan bishop, and these are called \"auxiliary\" bishops or, if a \"[[Coadjutor bishop|coadjutor\" bishop]], with right of succession.\n\nAdditionally, some bishops are called to advise and assist the bishop of Rome, the [[pope]], in a particular way, either as an additional responsibility on top of their diocesan office or sometimes as a full-time position in the [[Roman Curia]] or related institution serving the universal church. These are called [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinals]], because they are \"incardinated\" onto a second diocese (Rome). All cardinals under the age of 80 participate in the election of a new pope when the office of the papacy becomes vacant.\n\nThere are 428 active and retired Catholic bishops in the United States:\n[[File:Cardinals .jpg|thumb|1000px|In this image, the cardinals and bishops are processing through St. Peter's Basilica.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecompassnews.org/2014/11/pope-bishops-must-servants-vain-careerists-power-honor/|title=Pope: Bishops must be servants, not vain careerists after power, honor {{!}} The Compass|date=November 5, 2014|work=The Compass|access-date=September 27, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>|alt=]]\n255 active bishops:\n* 36 archbishops\n* 144 diocesan bishops\n* 67 auxiliary bishops\n* 8 apostolic or diocesan administrators\n\n173 retired bishops:\n* 33 retired archbishops\n* 95 retired diocesan bishops\n* 45 retired auxiliary bishops\n\n====Cardinals====\n\nThere are 14 U.S. cardinals.\n\nFive archdioceses are currently led by archbishops who have been created cardinals:\n* [[Blase J.

The main impetus was fear that exposure to Protestant teachers in the public schools, and Protestant fellow students, would lead to a loss of faith. Protestants reacted by [[Blaine Amendments|strong opposition to any public funding]] of parochial schools.<ref>Thomas E. Buckley, \"A Mandate for Anti-Catholicism: The Blaine Amendment,\" ''America'' September 27, 2004, 18\u201321.</ref> The Catholics nevertheless built their elementary schools, parish by parish, using very low paid sisters as teachers.<ref>Jay P. Dolan, ''The American Catholic Experience'' (1985) pp 262\u201374</ref>\n\nIn the classrooms, the highest priorities were piety, orthodoxy, and strict discipline. Knowledge of the subject matter was a minor concern, and in the late 19th century few of the teachers in parochial (or secular) schools had gone beyond the 8th grade themselves. The sisters came from numerous denominations, and there was no effort to provide joint teachers training programs. The bishops were indifferent. Finally around 1911, led by the [[Catholic University of America]] in Washington, Catholic colleges began summer institutes to train the sisters in pedagogical techniques. Long past World War II, the Catholic schools were noted for inferior plants compared to the public schools, and less well-trained teachers. The teachers were selected for religiosity, not teaching skills; the outcome was pious children and a reduced risk of marriage to Protestants.<ref>Jay P. Dolan, ''The American Catholic Experience'' (1985) pp 286\u201391</ref> However, by the later half the 20th century Catholic schools began to perform significantly better than their public counterparts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edpolicy.education.jhu.edu/is-the-catholic-school-effect-real-new-research-challenges-the-catholic-primary-school-advantage/|title=Is the \"Catholic School Effect\" Real?

Overall, Catholicism has by far the worst net conversion balance of any major religious group, with a high conversion rate out of the faith and a low rate into it; by contrast, most other religions have in- and out-conversion rates that roughly balance, whether high or low. This is credited to the more liberal stance of the Church since [[Vatican II]], where conversion to Catholicism is no longer encouraged, and the de-emphasizing of basic Catholic religious beliefs in Catholic education.

In Catholic Europe, convents were heavily endowed over the centuries, and were sponsored by the aristocracy. But there were very few rich American Catholics, and no aristocrats. Religious orders were founded by entrepreneurial women who saw a need and an opportunity, and were staffed by devout women from poor families. The numbers grew rapidly, from 900 sisters in 15 communities in 1840, 50,000 in 170 congregations in 1900, and 135,000 in 300 different congregations by 1930. Starting in 1820, the sisters always outnumbered the priests and brothers.<ref>James M. O'Toole, ''The Faithful: A History of Catholics in America'' (2008) p 104</ref> Their numbers peaked in 1965 at 180,000 then plunged to 56,000 in 2010. Many women left their orders, and few new members were added.<ref>Margaret M.

According to Laurie Goodstein, the investigation, which was viewed by many U.S. Catholics as a \"vexing and unjust inquisition of the sisters who ran the church's schools, hospitals and charities\", was ultimately closed in 2015 by Pope Francis.<ref name=\"Goodstein2015\">{{cite web|location=New York|publisher=The New York Times|website=nytimes.com|last=Goodstein|first=Laurie|title=Vatican ends battle with U.S. Catholic nuns' group|date=April 16, 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/us/catholic-church-ends-takeover-of-leadership-conference-of-women-religious.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===20th\u201321st centuries===\nIn the era of intense emigration from the 1840s to 1914, bishops often set up separate parishes for major ethnic groups, from Ireland, Germany, Poland, French Canada and Italy. In Iowa, the development of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dubuque|Archdiocese of Dubuque]], the work of [[Mathias Loras|Bishop Loras]] and the building of [[St. Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque)|St. Raphael's Cathedral]], to meet the needs of Germans and Irish, is illustrative.\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, approximately one-sixth of the population of the United States was Catholic. Modern Catholic immigrants come to the United States from the [[Philippines]], [[Poland]] and [[Latin America]], especially [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]]. This multiculturalism and diversity has influenced the conduct of Catholicism in the United States. For example, most dioceses offer [[Masses (liturgy)|Mass]] in a number of languages, and an increasing number of parishes offer Masses in the official language of the Church, Latin, due to its universal nature.\n\nSociologist [[Andrew Greeley]], an ordained Catholic priest at the University of Chicago, undertook a series of national surveys of Catholics in the late 20th century.  He published hundreds of books and articles, both technical and popular.  His biographer summarizes his interpretation:\n:He argued for the continued salience of ethnicity in American life and the distinctiveness of the Catholic religious imagination. Catholics differed from other Americans, he explained in a variety of publications, by their tendency to think in \"sacramental\" terms, imagining God as present in a world that was revelatory rather than bleak. The poetic elements in the Catholic tradition\u2014its stories, imagery, and rituals\u2014kept most Catholics in the fold, according to Greeley, whatever their disagreements with particular aspects of church discipline or doctrine. Despite the unchanging nature of Church doctrine, Greeley insisted that Humanae Vitae, the 1968 papal encyclical upholding the Catholic ban on contraception is solely responsible for the sharp decline in weekly Mass attendance between 1968 and 1975.<ref>Leslie Woodcock Tentler, \"Greeley, Andrew Moran\" [http://www.anb.org/articles/08/08-02390.html in ''American National Biography Online'' April 2016; Access Apr 30 2017]</ref>\n\nIn 1965, 71% of Catholics attended Mass regularly.<ref name=\"cch\">{{Cite book |first = Tom |last = Peterson |authorlink =  |title = Catholics come home |publisher = Image |date = 2013 |location = New York City |pages = 23|url = |doi = |id = |isbn = 978-0-385-34717-4 }}</ref><!-- regularly means at least weekly. -->\n\nIn the later 20th century \"[...] the Catholic Church in the United States became the subject of controversy due to allegations of [[Catholic sexual abuse scandal in the United States|clerical child abuse of children and adolescents]], of episcopal negligence in arresting these crimes, and of numerous civil suits that cost Catholic dioceses hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.\"<ref>Patrick W. Carey, ''Catholics in America. A History'', Westport, Connecticut and London: Praeger, 2004, p. 141</ref> Because of this, higher scrutiny and governance as well as protective policies and diocesan investigation into seminaries have been enacted to correct these former abuses of power, and safeguard parishioners and the Church from further abuses and scandals.\n\nOne initiative is the \"[[National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management]]\" (NLRCM), a lay-led group born in the wake of the sexual abuse scandal and dedicated to bringing better administrative practices to 194 dioceses that include 19,000 parishes nationwide with some 35,000 [[Lay Ecclesial Ministry|lay ecclesial ministers]] who log 20 hours or more a week in these parishes.<ref>David Gibson, \"Declaration of interdependence,\" ''The Tablet'' 4 July 2009, 8\u20139.</ref>\n\n<!-- In 2008, 17% of Catholics attended Mass regularly. -->{{when|date=May 2017}}<!-- regularly means at least weekly.-->According to a 2015 study by Pew Researchers, 39% of Catholics attend church at least once a week and 40%, once or twice a month.<ref>\"Attendance at Religious Service\" in Religious Landscape Study, Pew Research, May 12, 2015.</ref>\n\nAlthough the issue of trusteeism was mostly settled in the 19th century, there have been some related issues. In 2005, an interdict was issued to board members of [[St. Stanislaus Kostka Church (St. Louis, Missouri)]] in an attempt to get them to turn over the church property to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis]]. In 2006, a priest was accused of stealing $1.4 million from his parish, prompting a debate over [[Connecticut Raised Bill 1098]] as a means of forcing the Catholic church to manage money differently. Related to issues of asset ownership, some parishes have been liquidated and the [[Parish in the Catholic Church#Opposition to suppressions|assets taken by the diocese]] instead of being distributed to nearby parishes, which in violation of church financial rules.\n\nIn 2009 [[John Micklethwait]], editor of ''[[The Economist]]'' and co-author of ''[[God is Back|God Is Back: How the Global Revival of Faith Is Changing the World]]'', said that American Catholicism, which he describes in his book as \"arguably the most striking Evangelical success story of the second half of the nineteenth century,\" has competed quite happily \"without losing any of its basic characteristics.\" It has thrived in America's \"pluralism.\"<ref>Austin Ivereigh, \"God Makes a Comeback: An Interview with John Micklethwait, ''America'', 5 October 2009, 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nIn 2011, an estimated 26 million American Catholics were \"[[Lapsed Catholic|fallen-away]]\", that is, not practicing their faith.

Today only 39% of all Catholics go to Mass at least weekly.  Nearly two-thirds of Catholics say that their trust in the church leadership has been undermined by the clergy sex abuse crisis.

The French set up Catholic villages in the Mississippi River region, notably, [[St. Louis]] and [[New Orleans]]. Some English Catholics settled in Maryland.  In 1789 the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore|Archdiocese of Baltimore]] was the first diocese in the newly independent nation.  [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] became the first American bishop. His brother [[Daniel Carroll]] was the leading Catholic among the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. George Washington in the army and as president set a standard for religious toleration. No religious test was allowed for holding national office, and colonial legal restrictions on Catholics holding office were gradually abolished by the States. However, in the mid-19th century there was political [[anti-Catholicism in the United States]], sponsored by pietistic Protestants fearful of the pope. In the 20th century anti-Catholicism seldom appeared except when a Catholic was running for president as in 1928 and 1960. The number of Catholics grew rapidly in the 19th century through high fertility and immigration, especially from [[Irish Americans|Ireland]], [[German Americans|Germany]], and after 1880, [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Italian Americans|Italy]]. Large scale Catholic immigration from [[Mexico]] began after 1910 and in 2019 Latinos comprise 37 percent of American Catholics.  By 1900 it was the largest denomination. [[Parish]]es set up [[parochial school]]s, and over a hundred [[Jesuit]] and other colleges were established. [[Nun]]s were very active in teaching and hospital work. Since 1960 the percentage of Americans who are Catholic has fallen slowly from about 25% to 22%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.adw.org/2010/12/is-the-bottom-really-falling-out-of-catholic-mass-attendance-a-recent-cara-survey-ponders-the-question/|title=Is the Bottom Really Falling Out of Catholic Mass Attendance?

However, the average Catholic parish is significantly larger than the average Baptist or Methodist congregation; there are more than four times as many Catholics as Southern Baptists and more than eight times as many Catholics as United Methodists<!-- (7,853,987) [Commenting this out: Why show UMC numbers without showing SBC numbers?] -->.<ref>''Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches 2010''(Nashville: Abington Press, 2010), 12.</ref>\n\nIn the United States, there are 197 ecclesiastical jurisdictions:\n* 177 [[Latin Church|Western Catholic]] [[dioceses]]\n** including 32 Latin Catholic [[archdioceses]]\n* 18 [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] [[dioceses]] [[Eparchy|(eparchies)]]\n** including 2 Eastern Catholic [[archdioceses]] [[Archeparchy|(archeparchies)]]\n** including 1 [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Eparchy of the United States of America and Canada|Eparchy]] (for the [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]])\n* 2 [[personal ordinariate]]s\n** one for former [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] who came into full [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] communion\n** one for members of the military (though equivalent to an archdiocese, it is technically a [[military ordinariate]])\n\n[[Eastern Catholic Churches]] are churches with origins in Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa that have their own distinctive liturgical, legal and organizational systems and are identified by the national or ethnic character of their region of origin. Each is considered fully equal to the Latin tradition within the Church. In the United States, there are 15 Eastern Church dioceses (called [[Eparchy|eparchies]]) and two Eastern Church archdioceses (or [[Archeparchy|archeparchies]]), the [[Byzantine Catholic Archeparchy of Pittsburgh]] and the [[Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia]].\n\nThe apostolic exarchate for the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church in the United States is headed by a bishop who is a member of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. An apostolic exarchate is the Eastern Catholic Church equivalent of an apostolic vicariate. It is not a full-fledged diocese/eparchy, but is established by the Holy See for the pastoral care of Eastern Catholics in an area outside the territory of the Eastern Catholic Church to which they belong. It is headed by a bishop or a priest with the title of [[Exarch#Modern Eastern Catholic churches|exarch]].\n\nThe [[Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter]] was established January 1, 2012, to serve former Anglican groups and clergy in the United States who sought to become Catholic. Similar to a diocese though national in scope, the ordinariate is based in [[Houston]], Texas, and includes parishes and communities across the United States that are fully Catholic, while retaining elements of their Anglican heritage and traditions.\n\n{{As of|2017}}, 8 dioceses out of 195 are vacant (''[[sede vacante]]''). None of the current bishops or archbishops are past the retirement age of 75.\n\nThe central leadership body of the Catholic Church in the United States is the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]], made up of the hierarchy of [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]] (including [[archbishop]]s) of the United States and the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]], although each bishop is independent in his own [[diocese]], answerable only to the [[Holy See]]. The USCCB elects a president to serve as their administrative head, but he is in no way the \"head\" of the Church or of Catholics in the United States. In addition to the 195 dioceses and one [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Exarchate in the United States|exarchate]]<ref name=exarchate>On July 14, 2010, Pope Benedict XVI erected the [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Exarchate in the United States]].</ref> represented in the USCCB, there are several dioceses in the nation's other four overseas dependencies. In the Commonwealth of [[Puerto Rico]], the bishops in the six dioceses (one [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] [[archdiocese]] and five suffragan dioceses) form their own [[episcopal conference]], the [[Puerto Rican Episcopal Conference]] (''Conferencia Episcopal Puertorrique\u00f1a'').<ref>{{cite web|title=Catholic Church in Puerto Rico|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/country/pr.html |last=Cheney|first=David M. |accessdate=July 27, 2009}}</ref> The bishops in US [[insular area]]s in the [[Pacific Ocean]]\u2014the Commonwealth of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], the Territory of [[American Samoa]], and the Territory of [[Guam]]\u2014are members of the [[Episcopal conference#Episcopal Conferences|Episcopal Conference of the Pacific]].\n\nNo [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] exists for Catholics in the United States. In the 1850s, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore#Prelature|Archdiocese of Baltimore]] was acknowledged a ''Prerogative of Place'', which confers to its archbishop some of the leadership responsibilities granted to primates in other countries. The Archdiocese of Baltimore was the first diocese established in the United States, in 1789, with [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] (1735\u20131815) as its first bishop. It was, for many years, the most influential diocese in the fledgling nation. Now, however, the United States has several large archdioceses and a number of [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]]-archbishops.\n\nBy far, most Catholics in the United States belong to the [[Latin Church|Latin or Western Church]] and the [[Roman Rite]] of the Catholic Church. Rite generally refers to the form of worship (\"liturgical rite\") in a church community owing to cultural and historical differences as well as differences in practice. However, the Vatican II document, ''Orientalium Ecclesiarum'' (\"Of the Eastern Churches\"), acknowledges that these Eastern Catholic communities are \"true Churches\" and not just rites within the Catholic Church.<ref>Richard McBrien, THE CHURCH/THE EVOLUTION OF CATHOLICISM (New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 2009), 450. Also see: BASIC VATICAN COUNCIL II: THE BASIC SIXTEEN DOCUMENTS (Costello Publishing, 1996).</ref> There are 14 other Churches in the United States (23 within the global Catholic Church) which are in communion with Rome, fully recognized and valid in the eyes of the Catholic Church. They have their own bishops and [[eparchy|eparchies]]. The largest of these communities in the U.S. is the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]].<ref name=\"cnewastat\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.cnewa.org/source-images/Roberson-eastcath-statistics/eastcatholic-stat09.pdf\n|author=Ronald Roberson\n|title=The Eastern Catholic Churches 2009\n|publisher=Catholic Near East Welfare Association\n|id=Information sourced from ''Annuario Pontificio'' 2009 edition}} Retrieved November 2009</ref> Most of these Churches are of Eastern European and Middle Eastern origin. Eastern Catholic Churches are distinguished from Eastern Orthodox, identifiable by their usage of the term Catholic.<ref>McBrien, 241,281, 365,450</ref>\n\n==Personnel==\n\nThe Church employs people in a variety of leadership and service roles. Its ministers include ordained clergy ([[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]], [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests. and]] [[deacon]]<nowiki/>s) and non-ordained [[lay ecclesial ministers]], [[theologians]], and [[catechists]].\n\nSome Catholics, both lay and clergy, live in a form of [[consecrated life]], rather than in marriage. This includes a wide range of relationships, from monastic ([[monk]]<nowiki/>s and [[nun]]<nowiki/>s), to mendicant ([[friar]]s and sisters), apostolic (priests, [[Brother (Christian)|brother]][[Brothers|s]], and [[Religious sister (Catholic)|sisters)]], and secular and lay institutes. While many of these also serve in some form of ministry, above, others are in secular careers, within or without the Church. Consecrated life \u2013 in and of itself \u2013 does not make a person a part of the clergy or a minister of the Church.\n\nAdditionally, many lay people are employed in \"secular\" careers in support of Church institutions, including educators, health care professionals, finance and human resources experts, lawyers, and others.\n\n===Bishops===\n\nLeadership of the Catholic Church in the United States is provided by the bishops, individually for their own dioceses and collectively through the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]]. There are some mid-level groupings of bishops, such as ecclesiastical provinces (often covering a state) and the fourteen geographic regions of the USCCB, but these have little significance for most purposes.\n\nThe ordinary office for a bishop is to be the bishop of a particular diocese, its chief pastor and minister, usually geographically defined and incorporating, on average, about 350,000 Catholic Christians. In [[canon law]], the bishop leading a particular diocese, or similar office, is called an \"ordinary\" (i.e., he has complete jurisdiction in this territory or grouping of Christians).\n\nThere are two non-geographic dioceses, called \"ordinariates\", one for [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA|military personnel]] and one for [[List of Catholic dioceses in the United States|former Anglicans]] who are in full communion with the Catholic Church.\n\nDioceses are grouped together geographically into provinces, usually within a state, part of a state, or multiple states together (see map below). A province comprises several dioceses which look to one ordinary bishop (usually of the most populous or historically influential diocese/city) for guidance and leadership. This lead bishop is their [[archbishop]] and his diocese is the [[archdiocese]]. The archbishop is called the \"metropolitan\" bishop who strives to achieve some unanimity of practice with his brother \"suffragan\" bishops.\n\nSome larger dioceses have additional bishops assisting the diocesan bishop, and these are called \"auxiliary\" bishops or, if a \"[[Coadjutor bishop|coadjutor\" bishop]], with right of succession.\n\nAdditionally, some bishops are called to advise and assist the bishop of Rome, the [[pope]], in a particular way, either as an additional responsibility on top of their diocesan office or sometimes as a full-time position in the [[Roman Curia]] or related institution serving the universal church. These are called [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinals]], because they are \"incardinated\" onto a second diocese (Rome). All cardinals under the age of 80 participate in the election of a new pope when the office of the papacy becomes vacant.\n\nThere are 428 active and retired Catholic bishops in the United States:\n[[File:Cardinals .jpg|thumb|1000px|In this image, the cardinals and bishops are processing through St. Peter's Basilica.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecompassnews.org/2014/11/pope-bishops-must-servants-vain-careerists-power-honor/|title=Pope: Bishops must be servants, not vain careerists after power, honor {{!}} The Compass|date=November 5, 2014|work=The Compass|access-date=September 27, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>|alt=]]\n255 active bishops:\n* 36 archbishops\n* 144 diocesan bishops\n* 67 auxiliary bishops\n* 8 apostolic or diocesan administrators\n\n173 retired bishops:\n* 33 retired archbishops\n* 95 retired diocesan bishops\n* 45 retired auxiliary bishops\n\n====Cardinals====\n\nThere are 14 U.S. cardinals.\n\nFive archdioceses are currently led by archbishops who have been created cardinals:\n* [[Blase J.

The main impetus was fear that exposure to Protestant teachers in the public schools, and Protestant fellow students, would lead to a loss of faith. Protestants reacted by [[Blaine Amendments|strong opposition to any public funding]] of parochial schools.<ref>Thomas E. Buckley, \"A Mandate for Anti-Catholicism: The Blaine Amendment,\" ''America'' September 27, 2004, 18\u201321.</ref> The Catholics nevertheless built their elementary schools, parish by parish, using very low paid sisters as teachers.<ref>Jay P. Dolan, ''The American Catholic Experience'' (1985) pp 262\u201374</ref>\n\nIn the classrooms, the highest priorities were piety, orthodoxy, and strict discipline. Knowledge of the subject matter was a minor concern, and in the late 19th century few of the teachers in parochial (or secular) schools had gone beyond the 8th grade themselves. The sisters came from numerous denominations, and there was no effort to provide joint teachers training programs. The bishops were indifferent. Finally around 1911, led by the [[Catholic University of America]] in Washington, Catholic colleges began summer institutes to train the sisters in pedagogical techniques. Long past World War II, the Catholic schools were noted for inferior plants compared to the public schools, and less well-trained teachers. The teachers were selected for religiosity, not teaching skills; the outcome was pious children and a reduced risk of marriage to Protestants.<ref>Jay P. Dolan, ''The American Catholic Experience'' (1985) pp 286\u201391</ref> However, by the later half the 20th century Catholic schools began to perform significantly better than their public counterparts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edpolicy.education.jhu.edu/is-the-catholic-school-effect-real-new-research-challenges-the-catholic-primary-school-advantage/|title=Is the \"Catholic School Effect\" Real?

About 41% of those \"young\" raised Catholic have left the faith (as opposed to 32% overall), about half of these to the unaffiliated population and the rest to evangelical, other Protestant faith communities, and non-Christian faith.

Overall, Catholicism has by far the worst net conversion balance of any major religious group, with a high conversion rate out of the faith and a low rate into it; by contrast, most other religions have in- and out-conversion rates that roughly balance, whether high or low. This is credited to the more liberal stance of the Church since [[Vatican II]], where conversion to Catholicism is no longer encouraged, and the de-emphasizing of basic Catholic religious beliefs in Catholic education.

The Church also condemns embryo-destroying research and in vitro fertilization as immoral. The Church is allied with conservative evangelicals and other Protestants on these issues. However, the Catholic Church throughout its history has taken special concern for all vulnerable groups.

The numbers grew rapidly, from 900 sisters in 15 communities in 1840, 50,000 in 170 congregations in 1900, and 135,000 in 300 different congregations by 1930. Starting in 1820, the sisters always outnumbered the priests and brothers.<ref>James M. O'Toole, ''The Faithful: A History of Catholics in America'' (2008) p 104</ref> Their numbers peaked in 1965 at 180,000 then plunged to 56,000 in 2010. Many women left their orders, and few new members were added.<ref>Margaret M. McGuinness, ''Called to Serve'' (2013), ch 8</ref>\n[[File:GibbonsPhotoStanding.jpg|thumb|right|[[James Gibbons]] (1834\u20131921), cardinal archbishop of Baltimore, was the widely respected leader of American Catholics]]\n\nOn April 8, 2008, [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[William Levada]], [[prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] under [[Pope Benedict XVI]], met with the [[Leadership Conference of Women Religious]] leaders in Rome and communicated that the CDF would conduct a doctrinal assessment of the LCWR, expressing concern that the nuns were expressing radical feminist views. According to Laurie Goodstein, the investigation, which was viewed by many U.S. Catholics as a \"vexing and unjust inquisition of the sisters who ran the church's schools, hospitals and charities\", was ultimately closed in 2015 by Pope Francis.<ref name=\"Goodstein2015\">{{cite web|location=New York|publisher=The New York Times|website=nytimes.com|last=Goodstein|first=Laurie|title=Vatican ends battle with U.S. Catholic nuns' group|date=April 16, 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/us/catholic-church-ends-takeover-of-leadership-conference-of-women-religious.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===20th\u201321st centuries===\nIn the era of intense emigration from the 1840s to 1914, bishops often set up separate parishes for major ethnic groups, from Ireland, Germany, Poland, French Canada and Italy. In Iowa, the development of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dubuque|Archdiocese of Dubuque]], the work of [[Mathias Loras|Bishop Loras]] and the building of [[St. Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque)|St. Raphael's Cathedral]], to meet the needs of Germans and Irish, is illustrative.\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, approximately one-sixth of the population of the United States was Catholic. Modern Catholic immigrants come to the United States from the [[Philippines]], [[Poland]] and [[Latin America]], especially [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]]. This multiculturalism and diversity has influenced the conduct of Catholicism in the United States. For example, most dioceses offer [[Masses (liturgy)|Mass]] in a number of languages, and an increasing number of parishes offer Masses in the official language of the Church, Latin, due to its universal nature.\n\nSociologist [[Andrew Greeley]], an ordained Catholic priest at the University of Chicago, undertook a series of national surveys of Catholics in the late 20th century.  He published hundreds of books and articles, both technical and popular.  His biographer summarizes his interpretation:\n:He argued for the continued salience of ethnicity in American life and the distinctiveness of the Catholic religious imagination. Catholics differed from other Americans, he explained in a variety of publications, by their tendency to think in \"sacramental\" terms, imagining God as present in a world that was revelatory rather than bleak. The poetic elements in the Catholic tradition\u2014its stories, imagery, and rituals\u2014kept most Catholics in the fold, according to Greeley, whatever their disagreements with particular aspects of church discipline or doctrine. Despite the unchanging nature of Church doctrine, Greeley insisted that Humanae Vitae, the 1968 papal encyclical upholding the Catholic ban on contraception is solely responsible for the sharp decline in weekly Mass attendance between 1968 and 1975.<ref>Leslie Woodcock Tentler, \"Greeley, Andrew Moran\" [http://www.anb.org/articles/08/08-02390.html in ''American National Biography Online'' April 2016; Access Apr 30 2017]</ref>\n\nIn 1965, 71% of Catholics attended Mass regularly.<ref name=\"cch\">{{Cite book |first = Tom |last = Peterson |authorlink =  |title = Catholics come home |publisher = Image |date = 2013 |location = New York City |pages = 23|url = |doi = |id = |isbn = 978-0-385-34717-4 }}</ref><!-- regularly means at least weekly. -->\n\nIn the later 20th century \"[...] the Catholic Church in the United States became the subject of controversy due to allegations of [[Catholic sexual abuse scandal in the United States|clerical child abuse of children and adolescents]], of episcopal negligence in arresting these crimes, and of numerous civil suits that cost Catholic dioceses hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.\"<ref>Patrick W. Carey, ''Catholics in America. A History'', Westport, Connecticut and London: Praeger, 2004, p. 141</ref> Because of this, higher scrutiny and governance as well as protective policies and diocesan investigation into seminaries have been enacted to correct these former abuses of power, and safeguard parishioners and the Church from further abuses and scandals.\n\nOne initiative is the \"[[National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management]]\" (NLRCM), a lay-led group born in the wake of the sexual abuse scandal and dedicated to bringing better administrative practices to 194 dioceses that include 19,000 parishes nationwide with some 35,000 [[Lay Ecclesial Ministry|lay ecclesial ministers]] who log 20 hours or more a week in these parishes.<ref>David Gibson, \"Declaration of interdependence,\" ''The Tablet'' 4 July 2009, 8\u20139.</ref>\n\n<!-- In 2008, 17% of Catholics attended Mass regularly. -->{{when|date=May 2017}}<!-- regularly means at least weekly.-->According to a 2015 study by Pew Researchers, 39% of Catholics attend church at least once a week and 40%, once or twice a month.<ref>\"Attendance at Religious Service\" in Religious Landscape Study, Pew Research, May 12, 2015.</ref>\n\nAlthough the issue of trusteeism was mostly settled in the 19th century, there have been some related issues. In 2005, an interdict was issued to board members of [[St. Stanislaus Kostka Church (St. Louis, Missouri)]] in an attempt to get them to turn over the church property to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis]]. In 2006, a priest was accused of stealing $1.4 million from his parish, prompting a debate over [[Connecticut Raised Bill 1098]] as a means of forcing the Catholic church to manage money differently. Related to issues of asset ownership, some parishes have been liquidated and the [[Parish in the Catholic Church#Opposition to suppressions|assets taken by the diocese]] instead of being distributed to nearby parishes, which in violation of church financial rules.\n\nIn 2009 [[John Micklethwait]], editor of ''[[The Economist]]'' and co-author of ''[[God is Back|God Is Back: How the Global Revival of Faith Is Changing the World]]'', said that American Catholicism, which he describes in his book as \"arguably the most striking Evangelical success story of the second half of the nineteenth century,\" has competed quite happily \"without losing any of its basic characteristics.\" It has thrived in America's \"pluralism.\"<ref>Austin Ivereigh, \"God Makes a Comeback: An Interview with John Micklethwait, ''America'', 5 October 2009, 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nIn 2011, an estimated 26 million American Catholics were \"[[Lapsed Catholic|fallen-away]]\", that is, not practicing their faith.

About 25% of US Catholics say they attend Masses once a week or more, and about 38% went at least once a month. The study found that the number of US Catholics has increased by 3 to 6% each decade since 1965, and that the Catholic Church is \"the most diverse in terms of race and ethnicity in the US,\" with Hispanics accounting for 38% of Catholics and blacks and Asians 3% each.<ref name=manilatimes_afp/> The Catholic Church in the US represents perhaps \"the most multi-ethnic organization of any kind, and so is a major laboratory for cross-cultural cooperation and cross-cultural communication completely within the nation's borders.\"<ref>Mark A.

Today only 39% of all Catholics go to Mass at least weekly.  Nearly two-thirds of Catholics say that their trust in the church leadership has been undermined by the clergy sex abuse crisis.  Nevertheless, 86% of all Catholics still consider religion important in their own lives.<ref> Bunsen, 2019</ref>\n\n==Notable American Catholics==\n{{for|living US bishops|List of Catholic bishops in the United States}}\n{{see|Category:American Roman Catholics}}\n*[[John F.
