As a celebrator of beauty and especially [[femininity|feminine]] [[sensuality]], it has been said that \"Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] to [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]].\"<ref>Read, Herbert: ''The Meaning of Art'', page 127. Faber, 1931.</ref>\n\nHe was the father of actor [[Pierre Renoir]] (1885\u20131952), filmmaker [[Jean Renoir]] (1894\u20131979) and ceramic artist Claude Renoir (1901\u20131969). He was the grandfather of the filmmaker [[Claude Renoir]] (1913\u20131993), son of Pierre.\n\n==Life==\n===Youth===\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir 023.jpg|thumb|right|''[[La Loge|The Theater Box]]'', 1874, [[Courtauld Institute Galleries]], London]]\nPierre-Auguste Renoir was born in [[Limoges]], [[Haute-Vienne]], France, in 1841. His father, L\u00e9onard Renoir, was a tailor of modest means, so in 1844, Renoir's family moved to Paris in search of more favorable prospects. The location of their home, in rue d\u2019Argenteuil in central [[Paris]], placed Renoir in proximity to the Louvre. Although the young Renoir had a natural proclivity for drawing, he exhibited a greater talent for singing. His talent was encouraged by his teacher, [[Charles Gounod]], who was the choir-master at the Church of St Roch at the time. However, due to the family's financial circumstances, Renoir had to discontinue his music lessons and leave school at the age of thirteen to pursue an apprenticeship at a [[porcelain]] factory.<ref>Renoir, Jean: ''Renoir, My Father'', pages 57\u201367. Collins, 1962.</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=History & Techniques of the Great Masters: Renoir|last=Jennings|first=Guy|publisher=Quantum Publishing Ltd.|year=2003|isbn=1861604696|location=London|pages=6}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Renoir displayed a talent for his work, he frequently tired of the subject matter and sought refuge in the galleries of the [[Louvre]]. The owner of the factory recognized his apprentice's talent and communicated this to Renoir's family. Following this, Renoir started taking lessons to prepare for entry into [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts de Paris|Ecole des Beaux Arts]]. When the [[porcelain]] factory adopted mechanical reproduction processes in 1858, Renoir was forced to find other means to support his learning.<ref name=\":0\" /> Before he enrolled in art school, he also painted hangings for overseas missionaries and decorations on fans.<ref>Vollard, Ambroise: ''Renoir, An Intimate Record'', pages 24\u201329. Knopf, 1925.</ref>\n\nIn 1862, he began studying art under [[Charles Gleyre]] in Paris. There he met [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille]], and [[Claude Monet]].<ref>Vollard, page 30.</ref> At times, during the 1860s, he did not have enough money to buy paint. Renoir had his first success at the Salon of 1868 with his painting ''Lise with a Parasol'' (1867), which depicted [[Lise Tr\u00e9hot]], his lover at the time.<ref name=\"OxfordArtOnline\">[[Distel, Anne]]. \"Renoir, Auguste.\" ''Grove Art Online.

Park Lane, 1989.</ref> recognition was slow in coming, partly as a result of the turmoil of the [[Franco-Prussian War]].\n\nDuring the [[Paris Commune]] in 1871, while Renoir painted on the banks of the [[Seine|Seine River]], some [[Communards]] thought he was a spy and were about to throw him into the river, when a leader of the ''Commune'', [[Raoul Rigault]], recognized Renoir as the man who had protected him on an earlier occasion.<ref>Renoir, Jean, pages 118\u201321.

This loss of a favorite painting location resulted in a distinct change of subjects.\n\n===Adulthood===\nRenoir was inspired by the style and subject matter of previous modern painters [[Camille Pissarro]] and [[Edouard Manet]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Haine|first1=Scott|title=The History of France|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-30328-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyoffrance00hain/page/112 112]|edition=1st|year=2000|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoffrance00hain/page/112}}</ref> After a series of rejections by the Salon juries, he joined forces with Monet, Sisley, Pissarro, and several other artists to mount the first Impressionist exhibition in April 1874, in which Renoir displayed six paintings. Although the critical response to the exhibition was largely unfavorable, Renoir's work was comparatively well received.<ref name=\"OxfordArtOnline\"/> That same year, two of his works were shown with [[Paul Durand-Ruel|Durand-Ruel]] in London.<ref name=\"Wadley, page 15\"/>\n[[File:Auguste Renoir - The Swing - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Swing (Pierre-Auguste Renoir)|The Swing (La Balan\u00e7oire)]]'', 1876, oil on canvas, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], Paris]]\n\nHoping to secure a livelihood by attracting portrait commissions, Renoir displayed mostly portraits at the second Impressionist exhibition in 1876.<ref name=\"Brodskaya_114\"/> He contributed a more diverse range of paintings the next year when the group presented its third exhibition; they included ''Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette'' and ''The Swing''.<ref name=\"Brodskaya_114\">Brodskaja, Natalja (2010).

By the end of the 1870s, particularly after the success of his painting ''[[Marguerite Charpentier|Mme Charpentier]] and her Children'' (1878) at the Salon of 1879, Renoir was a successful and fashionable painter.<ref name=\"OxfordArtOnline\"/>\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Le Moulin de la Galette.jpg|thumb|250px|''Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette'' (''[[Bal du moulin de la Galette]]''), 1876]]\n\nIn 1881, he traveled to [[Algeria]], a country he associated with [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]],<ref>Poulet, A.

Following that, he traveled to Italy to see [[Titian]]'s masterpieces in [[Florence]] and the paintings of [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]] in Rome. On 15 January 1882, Renoir met the composer [[Richard Wagner]] at his home in [[Palermo]], Sicily. Renoir painted Wagner's portrait in just thirty-five minutes. In the same year, after contracting pneumonia which permanently damaged his respiratory system, Renoir convalesced for six weeks in Algeria.<ref name=\"Wadley, page 25\">Wadley, page 25.</ref>\n\nIn 1883, Renoir spent the summer in [[Guernsey]], one of the [[Channel Islands|islands]] in the [[English Channel]] with a varied landscape of beaches, cliffs, and bays, where he created fifteen paintings in little over a month. Most of these feature ''Moulin Huet'', a bay in [[Saint Martin's, Guernsey]]. These paintings were the subject of a set of commemorative postage stamps issued by the Bailiwick of Guernsey in 1983.\n\nWhile living and working in Montmartre, Renoir employed [[Suzanne Valadon]] as a model, who posed for him (''The Large Bathers'', 1884\u201387; ''[[Dance at Bougival]]'', 1883)<ref>Wadley, pages 371, 374.</ref> and many of his fellow painters; during that time she studied their techniques and eventually became one of the leading painters of the day.\n\nIn 1887, the year when [[Queen Victoria]] celebrated her [[Golden Jubilee]], and upon the request of the queen's associate, Phillip Richbourg, Renoir donated several paintings to the \"French Impressionist Paintings\" catalog as a token of his loyalty.\n\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir - Luncheon of the Boating Party - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Luncheon of the Boating Party]]'', 1880\u20131881]]\nIn 1890, he married [[Aline Charigot|Aline Victorine Charigot]], a dressmaker twenty years his junior,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Renoir|first1=Jean|title=Renoir, My Father|date=2001|publisher=NYRB Classics|isbn=0940322773|page=200}}</ref> who, along with a number of the artist's friends, had already served as a model for ''Le D\u00e9jeuner des canotiers'' (''[[Luncheon of the Boating Party]]'' \u2013 she is the woman on the left playing with the dog) in 1881, and with whom he had already had a child, Pierre, in 1885.<ref name=\"Wadley, page 25\"/> After his marriage, Renoir painted many scenes of his wife and daily family life including their children and their nurse, Aline's cousin [[Gabrielle Renard]]. The Renoirs had three sons: [[Pierre Renoir]] (1885-1952), who became a stage and film actor; [[Jean Renoir]] (1894-1979), who became a filmmaker of note; and Claude Renoir (1901-1969), who became a ceramic artist.\n\n===Later years===\n[[File:Renoir, Pierre-Auguste, by Dornac, BNF Gallica.jpg|thumb|left|Pierre-Auguste Renoir, c. 1910]]\nAround 1892, Renoir developed [[rheumatoid arthritis]]. In 1907, he moved to the warmer climate of \"Les Collettes,\" a farm at [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]], close to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast.<ref>Wadley, page 28.</ref> Renoir painted during the last twenty years of his life even after his arthritis severely limited his mobility. He developed progressive deformities in his hands and [[ankylosis]] of his right shoulder, requiring him to change his painting technique. It has often been reported that in the advanced stages of his arthritis, he painted by having a brush strapped to his paralyzed fingers,<ref>Andr\u00e9, Albert: ''Renoir''. Cr\u00e9s, 1928.</ref> but this is erroneous; Renoir remained able to grasp a brush, although he required an assistant to place it in his hand.<ref name=\"bmj\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/315/7123/1704.full#R6 |title=Boonen, A.; van de Rest, J.; Dequeker, J.; van der Linden, S.: \"How Renoir Coped with Rheumatoid Arthritis\".

During this period, he created sculptures by cooperating with a young artist, [[Richard Guino]], who worked the clay. Due to his limited joint mobility, Renoir also used a moving canvas, or picture roll, to facilitate painting large works.<ref name=\"bmj\" />\n\nRenoir's portrait of Austrian actress [[Tilla Durieux]] (1914) contains playful flecks of vibrant color on her shawl that offset the classical pose of the actress and highlight Renoir's skill just five years before his death.\n\nRenoir died in the village of Cagnes-sur-Mer, [[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]], on 3 December 1919.\n\n=== Family legacy ===\nPierre-Auguste Renoir's great-grandson, Alexandre Renoir, has also become a professional artist. In 2018, the Monthaven Arts and Cultural Center in Hendersonville, Tennessee hosted an exhibition of Alexandre's works titled \"Beauty Remains.\" The exhibition title comes from a famous quote by Pierre-Auguste who, when asked why he continued to paint with his painful arthritis in his advanced years, once said \"The pain passes, but the beauty remains.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/alexandre-renoir-exhibit-monthaven-arts-190912574.html|title=Alexandre Renoir Exhibit at Monthaven Arts & Cultural Center in Hendersonville|website=news.yahoo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\n==Artworks==\n[[File:Renoir - The Two Sisters, On the Terrace.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Two Sisters (On the Terrace)|Two Sisters]]'', oil on canvas, 1881, [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]\nRenoir's paintings are notable for their vibrant light and saturated color, most often focusing on people in intimate and candid compositions. The female nude was one of his primary subjects. In characteristic Impressionist style, Renoir suggested the details of a scene through freely brushed touches of color, so that his figures softly fuse with one another and their surroundings.\n\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1880, Portrait of Mademoiselle Ir\u00e8ne Cahen d'Anvers, Sammlung E.G.

B\u00fchrle|website=www.buehrle.ch}}</ref>]]\n\nHis initial paintings show the influence of the colorism of [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] and the luminosity of [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Camille Corot]]. He also admired the realism of [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[\u00c9douard Manet]], and his early work resembles theirs in his use of black as a color. Renoir admired [[Edgar Degas]]' sense of movement. Other painters Renoir greatly admired were the 18th-century masters [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard]].<ref>Rey, Robert: ''La Peinture fran\u00e7aise \u00e0 la fin du XIXe si\u00e8cle, la renaissance du sentiment classique : Degas, Renoir, C\u00e9zanne, Gauguin, Seurat'', Les Beaux-Arts, Van Oest, 1931 (thesis).</ref>\n\nA fine example of Renoir's early work and evidence of the influence of Courbet's realism, is ''[[Diana (Renoir painting)|Diana]]'', 1867. Ostensibly a mythological subject, the painting is a naturalistic studio work; the figure carefully observed, solidly modeled and superimposed upon a contrived landscape. If the work is a \"student\" piece, Renoir's heightened personal response to female sensuality is present. The model was Lise Tr\u00e9hot, the artist's mistress at that time, and inspiration for a number of paintings.<ref>[http://www.nga.gov/cgi-bin/pinfo?Object=46397+0+none \"From the Tour: Mary Cassatt\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041111002529/http://www.nga.gov/cgi-bin/pinfo?Object=46397+0+none |date=11 November 2004 }}, August Renoir. Retrieved 7 March 2007.</ref>\n\nIn the late 1860s, through the practice of painting light and water ''[[en plein air]]'' (outdoors), he and his friend [[Claude Monet]] discovered that the color of shadows is not brown or black, but the reflected color of the objects surrounding them, an effect known today as [[diffuse reflection]]. Several pairs of paintings exist in which Renoir and Monet worked side-by-side, depicting the same scenes (''La Grenouill\u00e8re'', 1869).\n\nOne of the best known Impressionist works is Renoir's 1876 ''Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette ([[Bal du moulin de la Galette]])''. The painting depicts an open-air scene, crowded with people at a popular dance garden on the ''Butte Montmartre'' close to where he lived.\nThe works of his early maturity were typically Impressionist snapshots of real life, full of sparkling color and light. By the mid-1880s, however, he had broken with the movement to apply a more disciplined formal technique to portraits and figure paintings, particularly of women. It was a trip to Italy in 1881 when he saw works by [[Raphael]] and other [[Renaissance]] masters, that convinced him that he was on the wrong path, and for the next several years he painted in a more severe style in an attempt to return to classicism.<ref>Clark, Kenneth: ''The Nude'', pages 154\u201361. Penguin, 1960.</ref> Concentrating on his drawing and emphasizing the outlines of figures, he painted works such as ''[[Blonde Bather]]'' (1881 and 1882) and ''The Large Bathers'' (1884\u201387; [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]) during what is sometimes called his \"[[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] period\".<ref>Asked late in life if he felt an affinity to Ingres, he responded: \"I should very much like to\". Rey, quoted in Wadley, page 336.</ref>\n\n[[File:Auguste Renoir - Young Girls at the Piano - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Girls at the Piano]]'', 1892, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], Paris]]\nAfter 1890 he changed direction again. To dissolve outlines, as in his earlier work, he returned to thinly brushed color. From this period onward he concentrated on monumental nudes and domestic scenes, fine examples of which are ''[[Girls at the Piano]]'', 1892, and ''[[Les Grandes Baigneuses (Renoir)|Grandes Baigneuses]]'', 1887. The latter painting is the most typical and successful of Renoir's late, abundantly fleshed nudes.<ref>\"For me, Renoir becomes a really great artist in the late nudes, above all in ''Les Grandes Baigneuses''\". David Sylvester, quoted by Wadley, page 378</ref>\n\nA prolific artist, he created several thousand paintings. The warm sensuality of Renoir's style made his paintings some of the most well-known and frequently reproduced works in the history of art. The single largest collection of his works\u2014181 paintings in all\u2014is at the [[Barnes Foundation]], in [[Philadelphia]].\n\n===Catalogue raisonn\u00e9===\nA five-volume ''[[catalogue raisonn\u00e9]]'' of Renoir's works (with one supplement) was published by [[Bernheim-Jeune]] between 1983 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bernheim-jeune.com/renoir-en/|title=Bernheim-Jeune}}</ref> Bernheim-Jeune is the only surviving major art dealer that was used by Renoir.

As a celebrator of beauty and especially [[femininity|feminine]] [[sensuality]], it has been said that \"Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] to [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]].\"<ref>Read, Herbert: ''The Meaning of Art'', page 127. Faber, 1931.</ref>\n\nHe was the father of actor [[Pierre Renoir]] (1885\u20131952), filmmaker [[Jean Renoir]] (1894\u20131979) and ceramic artist Claude Renoir (1901\u20131969). He was the grandfather of the filmmaker [[Claude Renoir]] (1913\u20131993), son of Pierre.\n\n==Life==\n===Youth===\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir 023.jpg|thumb|right|''[[La Loge|The Theater Box]]'', 1874, [[Courtauld Institute Galleries]], London]]\nPierre-Auguste Renoir was born in [[Limoges]], [[Haute-Vienne]], France, in 1841. His father, L\u00e9onard Renoir, was a tailor of modest means, so in 1844, Renoir's family moved to Paris in search of more favorable prospects. The location of their home, in rue d\u2019Argenteuil in central [[Paris]], placed Renoir in proximity to the Louvre. Although the young Renoir had a natural proclivity for drawing, he exhibited a greater talent for singing. His talent was encouraged by his teacher, [[Charles Gounod]], who was the choir-master at the Church of St Roch at the time. However, due to the family's financial circumstances, Renoir had to discontinue his music lessons and leave school at the age of thirteen to pursue an apprenticeship at a [[porcelain]] factory.<ref>Renoir, Jean: ''Renoir, My Father'', pages 57\u201367. Collins, 1962.</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=History & Techniques of the Great Masters: Renoir|last=Jennings|first=Guy|publisher=Quantum Publishing Ltd.|year=2003|isbn=1861604696|location=London|pages=6}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Renoir displayed a talent for his work, he frequently tired of the subject matter and sought refuge in the galleries of the [[Louvre]]. The owner of the factory recognized his apprentice's talent and communicated this to Renoir's family. Following this, Renoir started taking lessons to prepare for entry into [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts de Paris|Ecole des Beaux Arts]]. When the [[porcelain]] factory adopted mechanical reproduction processes in 1858, Renoir was forced to find other means to support his learning.<ref name=\":0\" /> Before he enrolled in art school, he also painted hangings for overseas missionaries and decorations on fans.<ref>Vollard, Ambroise: ''Renoir, An Intimate Record'', pages 24\u201329. Knopf, 1925.</ref>\n\nIn 1862, he began studying art under [[Charles Gleyre]] in Paris. There he met [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille]], and [[Claude Monet]].<ref>Vollard, page 30.</ref> At times, during the 1860s, he did not have enough money to buy paint. Renoir had his first success at the Salon of 1868 with his painting ''Lise with a Parasol'' (1867), which depicted [[Lise Tr\u00e9hot]], his lover at the time.<ref name=\"OxfordArtOnline\">[[Distel, Anne]]. \"Renoir, Auguste.\" ''Grove Art Online.

Web. 27 December 2014.</ref> Although Renoir first started exhibiting paintings at the [[Paris Salon]] in 1864,<ref>Wadley, Nicholas: ''Renoir, A Retrospective'', page 15. Park Lane, 1989.</ref> recognition was slow in coming, partly as a result of the turmoil of the [[Franco-Prussian War]].\n\nDuring the [[Paris Commune]] in 1871, while Renoir painted on the banks of the [[Seine|Seine River]], some [[Communards]] thought he was a spy and were about to throw him into the river, when a leader of the ''Commune'', [[Raoul Rigault]], recognized Renoir as the man who had protected him on an earlier occasion.<ref>Renoir, Jean, pages 118\u201321. Different and less life-threatening versions are offered by Paul Val\u00e9ry and Vollard. In all accounts, however, their re-acquaintance led to great celebration.</ref>\nIn 1874, a ten-year friendship with Jules Le C\u0153ur and his family ended,<ref name=\"Wadley, page 15\">Wadley, page 15.</ref> and Renoir lost not only the valuable support gained by the association but also a generous welcome to stay on their property near [[Fontainebleau]] and its scenic [[Forest of Fontainebleau|forest]]. This loss of a favorite painting location resulted in a distinct change of subjects.\n\n===Adulthood===\nRenoir was inspired by the style and subject matter of previous modern painters [[Camille Pissarro]] and [[Edouard Manet]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Haine|first1=Scott|title=The History of France|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-30328-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyoffrance00hain/page/112 112]|edition=1st|year=2000|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoffrance00hain/page/112}}</ref> After a series of rejections by the Salon juries, he joined forces with Monet, Sisley, Pissarro, and several other artists to mount the first Impressionist exhibition in April 1874, in which Renoir displayed six paintings. Although the critical response to the exhibition was largely unfavorable, Renoir's work was comparatively well received.<ref name=\"OxfordArtOnline\"/> That same year, two of his works were shown with [[Paul Durand-Ruel|Durand-Ruel]] in London.<ref name=\"Wadley, page 15\"/>\n[[File:Auguste Renoir - The Swing - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Swing (Pierre-Auguste Renoir)|The Swing (La Balan\u00e7oire)]]'', 1876, oil on canvas, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], Paris]]\n\nHoping to secure a livelihood by attracting portrait commissions, Renoir displayed mostly portraits at the second Impressionist exhibition in 1876.<ref name=\"Brodskaya_114\"/> He contributed a more diverse range of paintings the next year when the group presented its third exhibition; they included ''Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette'' and ''The Swing''.<ref name=\"Brodskaya_114\">Brodskaja, Natalja (2010).

By the end of the 1870s, particularly after the success of his painting ''[[Marguerite Charpentier|Mme Charpentier]] and her Children'' (1878) at the Salon of 1879, Renoir was a successful and fashionable painter.<ref name=\"OxfordArtOnline\"/>\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Le Moulin de la Galette.jpg|thumb|250px|''Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette'' (''[[Bal du moulin de la Galette]]''), 1876]]\n\nIn 1881, he traveled to [[Algeria]], a country he associated with [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]],<ref>Poulet, A.

Following that, he traveled to Italy to see [[Titian]]'s masterpieces in [[Florence]] and the paintings of [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]] in Rome. On 15 January 1882, Renoir met the composer [[Richard Wagner]] at his home in [[Palermo]], Sicily. Renoir painted Wagner's portrait in just thirty-five minutes. In the same year, after contracting pneumonia which permanently damaged his respiratory system, Renoir convalesced for six weeks in Algeria.<ref name=\"Wadley, page 25\">Wadley, page 25.</ref>\n\nIn 1883, Renoir spent the summer in [[Guernsey]], one of the [[Channel Islands|islands]] in the [[English Channel]] with a varied landscape of beaches, cliffs, and bays, where he created fifteen paintings in little over a month. Most of these feature ''Moulin Huet'', a bay in [[Saint Martin's, Guernsey]]. These paintings were the subject of a set of commemorative postage stamps issued by the Bailiwick of Guernsey in 1983.\n\nWhile living and working in Montmartre, Renoir employed [[Suzanne Valadon]] as a model, who posed for him (''The Large Bathers'', 1884\u201387; ''[[Dance at Bougival]]'', 1883)<ref>Wadley, pages 371, 374.</ref> and many of his fellow painters; during that time she studied their techniques and eventually became one of the leading painters of the day.\n\nIn 1887, the year when [[Queen Victoria]] celebrated her [[Golden Jubilee]], and upon the request of the queen's associate, Phillip Richbourg, Renoir donated several paintings to the \"French Impressionist Paintings\" catalog as a token of his loyalty.\n\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir - Luncheon of the Boating Party - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Luncheon of the Boating Party]]'', 1880\u20131881]]\nIn 1890, he married [[Aline Charigot|Aline Victorine Charigot]], a dressmaker twenty years his junior,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Renoir|first1=Jean|title=Renoir, My Father|date=2001|publisher=NYRB Classics|isbn=0940322773|page=200}}</ref> who, along with a number of the artist's friends, had already served as a model for ''Le D\u00e9jeuner des canotiers'' (''[[Luncheon of the Boating Party]]'' \u2013 she is the woman on the left playing with the dog) in 1881, and with whom he had already had a child, Pierre, in 1885.<ref name=\"Wadley, page 25\"/> After his marriage, Renoir painted many scenes of his wife and daily family life including their children and their nurse, Aline's cousin [[Gabrielle Renard]]. The Renoirs had three sons: [[Pierre Renoir]] (1885-1952), who became a stage and film actor; [[Jean Renoir]] (1894-1979), who became a filmmaker of note; and Claude Renoir (1901-1969), who became a ceramic artist.\n\n===Later years===\n[[File:Renoir, Pierre-Auguste, by Dornac, BNF Gallica.jpg|thumb|left|Pierre-Auguste Renoir, c. 1910]]\nAround 1892, Renoir developed [[rheumatoid arthritis]]. In 1907, he moved to the warmer climate of \"Les Collettes,\" a farm at [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]], close to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast.<ref>Wadley, page 28.</ref> Renoir painted during the last twenty years of his life even after his arthritis severely limited his mobility. He developed progressive deformities in his hands and [[ankylosis]] of his right shoulder, requiring him to change his painting technique. It has often been reported that in the advanced stages of his arthritis, he painted by having a brush strapped to his paralyzed fingers,<ref>Andr\u00e9, Albert: ''Renoir''. Cr\u00e9s, 1928.</ref> but this is erroneous; Renoir remained able to grasp a brush, although he required an assistant to place it in his hand.<ref name=\"bmj\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/315/7123/1704.full#R6 |title=Boonen, A.; van de Rest, J.; Dequeker, J.; van der Linden, S.: \"How Renoir Coped with Rheumatoid Arthritis\".

During this period, he created sculptures by cooperating with a young artist, [[Richard Guino]], who worked the clay. Due to his limited joint mobility, Renoir also used a moving canvas, or picture roll, to facilitate painting large works.<ref name=\"bmj\" />\n\nRenoir's portrait of Austrian actress [[Tilla Durieux]] (1914) contains playful flecks of vibrant color on her shawl that offset the classical pose of the actress and highlight Renoir's skill just five years before his death.\n\nRenoir died in the village of Cagnes-sur-Mer, [[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]], on 3 December 1919.\n\n=== Family legacy ===\nPierre-Auguste Renoir's great-grandson, Alexandre Renoir, has also become a professional artist. In 2018, the Monthaven Arts and Cultural Center in Hendersonville, Tennessee hosted an exhibition of Alexandre's works titled \"Beauty Remains.\" The exhibition title comes from a famous quote by Pierre-Auguste who, when asked why he continued to paint with his painful arthritis in his advanced years, once said \"The pain passes, but the beauty remains.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/alexandre-renoir-exhibit-monthaven-arts-190912574.html|title=Alexandre Renoir Exhibit at Monthaven Arts & Cultural Center in Hendersonville|website=news.yahoo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\n==Artworks==\n[[File:Renoir - The Two Sisters, On the Terrace.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Two Sisters (On the Terrace)|Two Sisters]]'', oil on canvas, 1881, [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]\nRenoir's paintings are notable for their vibrant light and saturated color, most often focusing on people in intimate and candid compositions. The female nude was one of his primary subjects. In characteristic Impressionist style, Renoir suggested the details of a scene through freely brushed touches of color, so that his figures softly fuse with one another and their surroundings.\n\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1880, Portrait of Mademoiselle Ir\u00e8ne Cahen d'Anvers, Sammlung E.G.

He also admired the realism of [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[\u00c9douard Manet]], and his early work resembles theirs in his use of black as a color. Renoir admired [[Edgar Degas]]' sense of movement. Other painters Renoir greatly admired were the 18th-century masters [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard]].<ref>Rey, Robert: ''La Peinture fran\u00e7aise \u00e0 la fin du XIXe si\u00e8cle, la renaissance du sentiment classique : Degas, Renoir, C\u00e9zanne, Gauguin, Seurat'', Les Beaux-Arts, Van Oest, 1931 (thesis).</ref>\n\nA fine example of Renoir's early work and evidence of the influence of Courbet's realism, is ''[[Diana (Renoir painting)|Diana]]'', 1867. Ostensibly a mythological subject, the painting is a naturalistic studio work; the figure carefully observed, solidly modeled and superimposed upon a contrived landscape. If the work is a \"student\" piece, Renoir's heightened personal response to female sensuality is present. The model was Lise Tr\u00e9hot, the artist's mistress at that time, and inspiration for a number of paintings.<ref>[http://www.nga.gov/cgi-bin/pinfo?Object=46397+0+none \"From the Tour: Mary Cassatt\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041111002529/http://www.nga.gov/cgi-bin/pinfo?Object=46397+0+none |date=11 November 2004 }}, August Renoir. Retrieved 7 March 2007.</ref>\n\nIn the late 1860s, through the practice of painting light and water ''[[en plein air]]'' (outdoors), he and his friend [[Claude Monet]] discovered that the color of shadows is not brown or black, but the reflected color of the objects surrounding them, an effect known today as [[diffuse reflection]]. Several pairs of paintings exist in which Renoir and Monet worked side-by-side, depicting the same scenes (''La Grenouill\u00e8re'', 1869).\n\nOne of the best known Impressionist works is Renoir's 1876 ''Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette ([[Bal du moulin de la Galette]])''. The painting depicts an open-air scene, crowded with people at a popular dance garden on the ''Butte Montmartre'' close to where he lived.\nThe works of his early maturity were typically Impressionist snapshots of real life, full of sparkling color and light. By the mid-1880s, however, he had broken with the movement to apply a more disciplined formal technique to portraits and figure paintings, particularly of women. It was a trip to Italy in 1881 when he saw works by [[Raphael]] and other [[Renaissance]] masters, that convinced him that he was on the wrong path, and for the next several years he painted in a more severe style in an attempt to return to classicism.<ref>Clark, Kenneth: ''The Nude'', pages 154\u201361. Penguin, 1960.</ref> Concentrating on his drawing and emphasizing the outlines of figures, he painted works such as ''[[Blonde Bather]]'' (1881 and 1882) and ''The Large Bathers'' (1884\u201387; [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]) during what is sometimes called his \"[[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] period\".<ref>Asked late in life if he felt an affinity to Ingres, he responded: \"I should very much like to\". Rey, quoted in Wadley, page 336.</ref>\n\n[[File:Auguste Renoir - Young Girls at the Piano - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Girls at the Piano]]'', 1892, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], Paris]]\nAfter 1890 he changed direction again. To dissolve outlines, as in his earlier work, he returned to thinly brushed color. From this period onward he concentrated on monumental nudes and domestic scenes, fine examples of which are ''[[Girls at the Piano]]'', 1892, and ''[[Les Grandes Baigneuses (Renoir)|Grandes Baigneuses]]'', 1887. The latter painting is the most typical and successful of Renoir's late, abundantly fleshed nudes.<ref>\"For me, Renoir becomes a really great artist in the late nudes, above all in ''Les Grandes Baigneuses''\". David Sylvester, quoted by Wadley, page 378</ref>\n\nA prolific artist, he created several thousand paintings. The warm sensuality of Renoir's style made his paintings some of the most well-known and frequently reproduced works in the history of art. The single largest collection of his works\u2014181 paintings in all\u2014is at the [[Barnes Foundation]], in [[Philadelphia]].\n\n===Catalogue raisonn\u00e9===\nA five-volume ''[[catalogue raisonn\u00e9]]'' of Renoir's works (with one supplement) was published by [[Bernheim-Jeune]] between 1983 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bernheim-jeune.com/renoir-en/|title=Bernheim-Jeune}}</ref> Bernheim-Jeune is the only surviving major art dealer that was used by Renoir.

Logan Monument.\n\n[[File:St GaudensShaw Mem.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[Robert Gould Shaw Memorial]]'', [[Boston Common]] (1884\u20131897)]]\n\nArguably the greatest of these monuments is the bronze bas-relief that forms the ''[[Robert Gould Shaw Memorial]]'' on [[Boston Common]], 1884\u20131897, which Saint-Gaudens labored on for 14 years; even after the public version had been unveiled, he continued with further versions. Two grand equestrian monuments to Civil War [[general]]s are outstanding: to General [[John A. Logan]], atop a tumulus in Chicago, 1894\u20131897, and to ''[[William Tecumseh Sherman (Saint-Gaudens)|William Tecumseh Sherman]]'' at the corner of [[Central Park]] in New York, 1892\u20131903, the first use of [[Robert Paine (sculptor)|Robert Treat Paine]]'s pointing device for the accurate mechanical enlargement of sculpture models. The depictions of the African-American soldiers on the Shaw memorial is noted as a rare example of true-to-life, non-derogatory, depictions of Afro-ancestral physical characteristics in 19th-century American art.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Augustus Saint-Gaudens' Memorial to Robert Gould Shaw and the Massachusetts Fifty-fourth Regiment|journal=National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC|year=1997}}</ref>\n\nFor the Lincoln Centennial in 1909, Saint-Gaudens produced another statue of the president. A seated figure, ''[[Abraham Lincoln: The Head of State]],'' is in Chicago's [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]]. Saint-Gaudens completed the design work and had begun casting the statue at the time of his death\u2014his workshop completed it. The statue's head was used as the model for the [[commemorative postage stamp]] issued on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln's birth.<ref>[http://www.us1909.com/367gaudens.html US 1909.com Saint-Gaudens] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717174244/http://www.us1909.com/367gaudens.html |date=July 17, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Other works==\n[[File:Memorial to Charles Parnell.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Parnell Memorial]], Dublin]]\nSaint-Gaudens also created the statue for the [[monument]] of [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], which was installed at the north end of Dublin's [[O'Connell Street]] in 1911.\n\nIn 1887, when [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] made his second trip to the United States, Saint-Gaudens had the opportunity to make the preliminary sketches for a five-year project of a medallion depicting Stevenson, in very poor health at the time, propped in bed writing. With minor modifications, this medallion was reproduced for the Stevenson memorial in [[St. Giles' Cathedral]], [[Edinburgh]]. Stevenson's cousin and biographer, Graham Balfour, deemed the work \"the most satisfactory of all the portraits of Stevenson\". Balfour also noted that Saint-Gaudens greatly admired Stevenson and had once said he would \"gladly go a thousand miles for the sake of a sitting\" with him.<sup>[2]</sup>\n\nSaint-Gaudens was also commissioned by a variety of groups to create medals including varied commemorative themes like The Women\"s Auxiliary of the Massachusetts Civil Service Reform Association Presentation Medal and the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] Medal. Such pieces stand testament to both his broad appeal and the respect that was given to him by his contemporaries.\n\nA statue of philanthropist Robert Randall stands in the gardens of [[Sailors' Snug Harbor]] in New York. A statue of copper king [[Marcus Daly]] is at the entrance of the [[Montana School of Mines]] on the west end of Park St. in [[Butte, Montana]].

He tutored young [[artist]]s privately, taught at the [[Art Students League of New York]], and took on a large number of assistants. He was an artistic advisor to the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893, an avid supporter of the [[American Academy in Rome]], and part of the [[McMillan Commission]], which brought into being [[Pierre L'Enfant|L'Enfant]]'s long-ignored master-plan for the [[Washington, D.C.|nation's capital]].\n\nThrough his career Augustus Saint-Gaudens made a specialty of intimate private portrait panels in sensitive, very low relief, which owed something to the Florentine [[Renaissance]].

Despite waning energy, he continued to work, producing a steady stream of reliefs and public sculpture. In 1901, he was appointed a member of the Senate Park, or McMillan, Commission for the redesign of Washington, D.C.'s Mall and its larger park system, along with architects [[Daniel Burnham]] and [[Charles Follen McKim]], and landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]]; in 1902, the Commission published their report, popularly known as the [[McMillan Plan]].<ref>''Civic Art:  A Centennial History of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts,'' ed.

He also used his design skills in [[numismatics]]. Most notably, he designed the $20 [[Saint Gaudens Double Eagle]] gold piece (1905\u20131907) for the US Mint, considered one of the most beautiful American coins ever issued,<ref>[http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/american_eagles/index.cfm?flash=yes&Action=american_eagle_silver US Mint: The American Eagles Program].</ref> as well as the $10 \"Indian Head\" [[Eagle (United States coin)|gold eagle]]; both of these were minted from 1907 until 1933. In his later years he founded the \"[[Cornish Art Colony|Cornish Colony]]\", an artistic colony that included notable painters, sculptors, writers, and architects. His brother [[Louis Saint-Gaudens]], with whom he occasionally collaborated, was also a well-known sculptor.\n\n==Early life and career==\nSaint-Gaudens was born in [[Dublin]], Ireland to an Irish mother and French father, Bernard Paul Ernest Saint-Gaudens, a shoemaker by trade from a small village in the [[French Pyrenees]], [[Aspet, Haute-Garonne|Aspet]], 15 kilometers from [[Saint-Gaudens, Haute-Garonne|Saint-Gaudens]].

Logan Monument.\n\n[[File:St GaudensShaw Mem.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[Robert Gould Shaw Memorial]]'', [[Boston Common]] (1884\u20131897)]]\n\nArguably the greatest of these monuments is the bronze bas-relief that forms the ''[[Robert Gould Shaw Memorial]]'' on [[Boston Common]], 1884\u20131897, which Saint-Gaudens labored on for 14 years; even after the public version had been unveiled, he continued with further versions. Two grand equestrian monuments to Civil War [[general]]s are outstanding: to General [[John A. Logan]], atop a tumulus in Chicago, 1894\u20131897, and to ''[[William Tecumseh Sherman (Saint-Gaudens)|William Tecumseh Sherman]]'' at the corner of [[Central Park]] in New York, 1892\u20131903, the first use of [[Robert Paine (sculptor)|Robert Treat Paine]]'s pointing device for the accurate mechanical enlargement of sculpture models. The depictions of the African-American soldiers on the Shaw memorial is noted as a rare example of true-to-life, non-derogatory, depictions of Afro-ancestral physical characteristics in 19th-century American art.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Augustus Saint-Gaudens' Memorial to Robert Gould Shaw and the Massachusetts Fifty-fourth Regiment|journal=National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC|year=1997}}</ref>\n\nFor the Lincoln Centennial in 1909, Saint-Gaudens produced another statue of the president. A seated figure, ''[[Abraham Lincoln: The Head of State]],'' is in Chicago's [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]]. Saint-Gaudens completed the design work and had begun casting the statue at the time of his death\u2014his workshop completed it. The statue's head was used as the model for the [[commemorative postage stamp]] issued on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln's birth.<ref>[http://www.us1909.com/367gaudens.html US 1909.com Saint-Gaudens] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717174244/http://www.us1909.com/367gaudens.html |date=July 17, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Other works==\n[[File:Memorial to Charles Parnell.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Parnell Memorial]], Dublin]]\nSaint-Gaudens also created the statue for the [[monument]] of [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], which was installed at the north end of Dublin's [[O'Connell Street]] in 1911.\n\nIn 1887, when [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] made his second trip to the United States, Saint-Gaudens had the opportunity to make the preliminary sketches for a five-year project of a medallion depicting Stevenson, in very poor health at the time, propped in bed writing. With minor modifications, this medallion was reproduced for the Stevenson memorial in [[St. Giles' Cathedral]], [[Edinburgh]]. Stevenson's cousin and biographer, Graham Balfour, deemed the work \"the most satisfactory of all the portraits of Stevenson\". Balfour also noted that Saint-Gaudens greatly admired Stevenson and had once said he would \"gladly go a thousand miles for the sake of a sitting\" with him.<sup>[2]</sup>\n\nSaint-Gaudens was also commissioned by a variety of groups to create medals including varied commemorative themes like The Women\"s Auxiliary of the Massachusetts Civil Service Reform Association Presentation Medal and the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] Medal. Such pieces stand testament to both his broad appeal and the respect that was given to him by his contemporaries.\n\nA statue of philanthropist Robert Randall stands in the gardens of [[Sailors' Snug Harbor]] in New York. A statue of copper king [[Marcus Daly]] is at the entrance of the [[Montana School of Mines]] on the west end of Park St. in [[Butte, Montana]].

He tutored young [[artist]]s privately, taught at the [[Art Students League of New York]], and took on a large number of assistants. He was an artistic advisor to the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893, an avid supporter of the [[American Academy in Rome]], and part of the [[McMillan Commission]], which brought into being [[Pierre L'Enfant|L'Enfant]]'s long-ignored master-plan for the [[Washington, D.C.|nation's capital]].\n\nThrough his career Augustus Saint-Gaudens made a specialty of intimate private portrait panels in sensitive, very low relief, which owed something to the Florentine [[Renaissance]].

Despite waning energy, he continued to work, producing a steady stream of reliefs and public sculpture. In 1901, he was appointed a member of the Senate Park, or McMillan, Commission for the redesign of Washington, D.C.'s Mall and its larger park system, along with architects [[Daniel Burnham]] and [[Charles Follen McKim]], and landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]]; in 1902, the Commission published their report, popularly known as the [[McMillan Plan]].<ref>''Civic Art:  A Centennial History of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts,'' ed.

That same year the large studio burned, with the irreplaceable loss of the sculptor's correspondence, his sketch books, and many works in progress.\n\nThe [[Cornish Art Colony]] Saint-Gaudens and his brother Louis attracted made for a dynamic social and creative environment. The most famous included painters [[Maxfield Parrish]] and [[Kenyon Cox]], architect and garden designer [[Charles A. Platt]], and sculptor [[Paul Manship]]. Included were painters [[Thomas Dewing]], [[George de Forest Brush]], dramatist [[Percy MacKaye]], the American novelist [[Winston Churchill (novelist)|Winston Churchill]], and the sculptor [[Louis St. Gaudens]], Augustus' brother. After his death in 1907 it slowly dissipated. His house and gardens are now preserved as the [[Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site]].\n\nSaint-Gaudens was elected a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1896.

In 30 paintings (29 of which are still extant), Derain presented a portrait of London that was radically different from anything done by previous painters of the city such as [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] or [[Claude Monet|Monet]]. With bold colors and compositions, Derain painted multiple pictures of the [[Thames]] and [[Tower Bridge]]. These London paintings remain among his most popular work. Art critic T.

The original ''[[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition|Revised Standard Version, Catholic Edition]]'' (RSV-CE) was published in 1965&ndash;66, and the Apocrypha was expanded in 1977. The ''Revised Standard Version, Second Catholic Edition'' (RSV-2CE) was released in 2006.\n\nIn later years, the RSV served as the basis for two revisions&mdash;the [[New Revised Standard Version]] (NRSV) of 1989, and the [[English Standard Version]] (ESV) of 2001.\n\n== Making of the RSV ==\nThe immediate predecessor to the RSV was the [[American Standard Version]], published in 1901 by [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson & Sons]], and copyrighted to protect the ASV text from unauthorized changes. In 1928, the [[International Council of Religious Education]] (ICRE) acquired the copyright to the ASV from Nelson and renewed it the following year.\n\nFrom 1930\u201332, a study of the ASV text was undertaken to decide the question of a new revision, but due to the [[Great Depression]], it was not until 1937 that the ICRE voted in favor of revising the ASV text. A panel of 32 scholars was assembled for that task. Also, the Council hoped to set up a corresponding translation committee in Great Britain, as had been the case with the RV and ASV, but this plan was canceled because of [[World War II]].\n\nFunding for the revision was assured in 1936 by a deal made with the publisher Thomas Nelson & Sons that gave Nelson the exclusive rights to print the new version for ten years. The Committee determined that, since the work would be a revision of the \"Standard Bible\" (as the ASV was sometimes called because of its standard use in seminaries in those days), the name of the work would be the \"Revised Standard Version\".\n\nThe translation panel used the 17th edition of the [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestle-\u00c5land Greek text]] for the [[New Testament]] and the traditional [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Masoretic Text]] for the [[Old Testament]]. In the [[Book of Isaiah]], they sometimes followed readings found in the newly discovered [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].\n\nThe RSV New Testament was published on February 11, 1946. In his presentation speech to the ICRE, [[Luther Weigle]], dean of the translation committee, explained that he wanted the RSV to supplement and not supplant the KJV and ASV.\n\nIn 1950, the ICRE merged with the [[Federal Council of Churches]] to form the [[National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA]]. The former ICRE became the new Council's Division of Christian Education, and the NCC became the RSV's official sponsor.\n\n[[Image:RSV title page.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Title page to the RSV Bible, as seen in the [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Nelson]] editions printed between 1952 and 1971]]\nAfter a thorough examination and approximately 80 changes to the New Testament text, the NCC authorized the RSV Bible for publication in 1951. [[Jerome|St. Jerome's Day]], September 30, 1952, was selected as the day of publication, and on that day, the NCC sponsored a celebratory rally in [[Washington D.C.]], with representatives of the churches affiliated with it present. The very first copy of the RSV Bible to come off the press was presented by Weigle to an appreciative President [[Harry S. Truman]] on September 26, four days before it was released to the general public. [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=14262#.U2w_zpcZkuI.facebook]\n\n== Features ==\n{{unreferenced section|date= December 2014}}\nThere were three key differences between the RSV (on the one hand), and the KJV, RV, and ASV (on the other):\n\n# The translators reverted to the KJV and RV's practice of translating the [[Tetragrammaton]], or the Divine Name, [[YHWH]]. In accordance with the 1611 and 1885 versions, the RSV translated it as \"{{LORD}}\" or \"{{GOD}}\" (depending on whether the Hebrew of the particular verse was read \"[[Adonai]]\" or \"[[Elohim]]\" in Jewish practice), whereas the ASV had translated it \"[[Jehovah]]\".\n# A change was made in the usage of archaic English for [[Grammatical person|second-person]] pronouns, \"[[thou]]\", \"thee\", \"thy\", and verb forms \"art, hast, hadst, didst\", etc. The KJV, RV, and ASV used these terms for addressing both God and humans. The RSV used archaic English pronouns and verbs only for addressing God, a fairly common practice for Bible translations until the mid-1970s.\n# For the New Testament, the RSV followed the latest available version of Nestle's Greek text, whereas the RV and ASV had used the Wescott and Hort Greek text, and the KJV had used the ''[[Textus receptus]]''.\n\n== Reception and controversy ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Good News Translation]] -->\n\n===Isaiah 7:14 dispute and impact===\n{{Main|Isaiah 7:14}}\nThe RSV New Testament was well received, but reactions to the Old Testament were varied and not without controversy.<ref>[[Daniel B. Wallace|Wallace, Daniel B.]], \"The History of the English Bible\" (lecture series with transcripts). http://www.bible.org/page.php?page_id=1825</ref> Critics claimed that the RSV translators had translated the Old Testament from a non-Christian perspective. Some critics specifically referred to a Jewish viewpoint, pointing to agreements with the 1917 [[Jewish Publication Society of America Version]] [[Tanakh]] and the presence on the editorial board of a Jewish scholar, [[Harry Orlinsky]]. Such critics further claimed that other views, including those of the New Testament, were not considered. The focus of the controversy was the RSV's translation of the Hebrew word {{lang|he|\u05e2\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05de\u05b8\u05d4}} ([[almah|''\u02bfalm\u0101h'']]) in [[Isaiah 7:14]] as \"young woman\" rather than the traditional Christian translation of \"virgin\".\n\nOf the seven appearances of ''\u02bfalm\u0101h'', the [[Septuagint]] translates only two of them as ''parthenos'', \"virgin\" (including Isaiah 7:14). By contrast, the word {{lang|he|\u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05ea\u05d5\u05bc\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4}} (''b\u0259\u1e6f\u016bl\u0101h'') appears some 50 times, and the Septuagint and English translations agree in understanding the word to mean \"virgin\" in almost every case.\n\nThe controversy stemming from this rendering helped reignite the [[King-James-Only Movement]] within the Independent Baptist and Pentecostal churches. Furthermore, many Christians have adopted what has come to be known as the \"{{bibleref|Isaiah|7:14|RSV}} litmus test\", which entails checking that verse to determine whether or not a new translation can be trusted.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nIt is notable that some scholars{{which|date=November 2015}} agree that ''almah'' has nothing to do with virginity,{{sfn|Saldarini|2001|p=1007}} as knowledge of the [[Hebrew language]]<ref>[https://translate.google.com/#iw/en/%D7%A2%D6%B7%D7%9C%D7%9E%D6%B8%D7%94 \u05e2\u05dc\u05de\u05d4 on Google translate]</ref> and textual analysis<ref>''Example of Almah explicitly not referring to a virgin'':{{quote|18 There are three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:\n19 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock;\nthe way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a '''young woman'''.\n20 So is the way of an adulterous woman;\nshe eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith: 'I have done no wickedness.' |Proverbs 30 18-20, JPS translation}}\nIn this quote the word translated as \"young woman\" is almah, although some translations translate almah here as \"virgin\".\n</ref> make it possible that \"almah\" means \"young woman\", rather than \"virgin\".\n\n===Protest===\nSome opponents of the RSV took their antagonism beyond condemnation. Luther Hux, a pastor in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, announced his intention to burn a copy of the RSV during a sermon on November 30, 1952. This was reported in the press and attracted shocked reactions, as well as a warning from the local fire chief. On the day in question, he delivered a two-hour sermon entitled \"The National Council Bible, the Master Stroke of Satan\u2014One of the Devil's Greatest Hoaxes\". After the sermon was complete, he led the congregation out of the church, gave each worshipper a small American flag and proceeded to set light to the pages containing Isaiah 7:14. Hux informed the gathered press that he did not burn the Bible, but simply the \"fraud\" that the Isaiah pages represented. Hux would later go on to write a tract against the RSV entitled ''Modernism's Unholy Bible''.<ref name=\"Thuesen2002\">{{cite book|author=[[Peter Johannes Thuesen]]|title=In Discordance with the Scriptures: American Protestant Battles Over Translating the Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Parz1Sxd8BsC&pg=PA97|date=1 May 2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-515228-9|pages=96\u201398}}</ref>\n\nA pastor in the Southern United States burned a copy of the RSV with a [[Blow torch|blowlamp]] in his pulpit, saying that it was like the devil because it was hard to burn and sent the ashes as a protest to Weigle. (However, [[F.F. Bruce]] dismissed it as a publicity stunt and wrote{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} that it had the opposite effect of causing nearly every family in that congregation to acquire a copy.) {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The RSV translators linked these events to the life of [[William Tyndale]], an inspiration to them, explaining in their preface: \"He met bitter opposition. He was accused of willfully perverting the meaning of the Scriptures, and his New Testaments were ordered to be burned as 'untrue translations.'\" But where Tyndale was burned at the stake for his work, [[Bruce Metzger]], referring to the pastor who burned the RSV and sent the ashes to Weigle, commented in his book ''The Bible In Translation'': \"...today it is happily only a copy of the translation that meets such a fate.\" instead of Bible translators.<ref name=\"Metzger2001\">{{cite book|author=Bruce M.

Since there was no [[American Standard Version]] of the Apocrypha, the RSV Apocrypha was a revision of the [[Revised Version]] Apocrypha of 1894 as well as the King James Version. To make the RSV acceptable to individuals and parishes within the [[Orthodox Church]], an expanded edition of the deuterocanonical texts containing 3 and 4 Maccabees and [[Psalm 151]] was released in 1977; in these 1977 additions, as in the [[New Revised Standard Version]], archaic pronouns (such as \"thou\" and \"thee\") and verb forms (such as \"hast\" and \"didst\") are no longer used for God.\n\nMost editions of the RSV that contain the Apocrypha place those books after the New Testament, arranged in the order of the [[King James Version]] (the Eastern Orthodox deuterocanon in post-1977 editions is added at the end). The exceptions are the First and Second Catholic Editions and the Common Bible in which the Apocryphal books were placed in the order of the Roman Catholic [[Biblical canon]] and between the Testaments and rearranged in an order pleasing to Catholics, Orthodox, and Protestants alike, respectively (see below for more information about the Catholic Editions and the Common Bible).\n\n=== Alterations in 1962 printings ===\n{{unreferenced section|date= December 2014}}\nApproximately 85 alterations to the RSV text were authorized in 1959 and introduced into the 1962 printings. At the same time, as Thomas Nelson & Sons was not keeping up with the public demand for the RSV Bible, the NCC authorized other publishing companies besides Nelson to print it, including the [[American Bible Society]], [[Cokesbury]], [[Holman Bible Publishers|Holman]], [[The Melton Book Company|Melton]], [[Oxford University Press]], [[World Publishing Company|World]], [[William Collins, Sons|Collins]], and [[Zondervan]]. Some of the changes included (but were not limited to) reverting to the Greek phrase \"the husband of one wife\" in 1 Timothy 3.2, 12 and Titus 1.6 (in the 1946-52 printing it was paraphrased as \"married only once\"), quoting the Roman [[centurion]]  who witnessed Jesus' death and called him \"the Son of God\" in Matthew 27.54 and Mark 15.39 (in 1946-52 he was quoted as calling Jesus \"a son of God\"), and changing \"without\" in Job 19.26 to \"from\" (and adjusting the associated footnote accordingly).\n\n=== Catholic Edition ===\n{{Main|Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition}}\n\nIn 1965\u201366, the [[Catholic Biblical Association]] adapted, under the editorship of Bernard Orchard OSB and [[Reginald C. Fuller]], the RSV for [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] use with the release of the [[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition|'''Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition (RSV-CE)''']]. A revised New Testament was published in 1965, followed by a full RSV Catholic Edition Bible in 1966. The RSV Catholic Edition included revisions up through 1962, a small number of new revisions to the New Testament, mostly to return to familiar phrases, and changes to a few footnotes. It contains the [[deuterocanonical]] books of the Old Testament placed in the traditional order of the [[Vulgate]].\n\n=== Second Edition of the New Testament ===\nOn March 15, 1971, the RSV Bible was re-released with the Second Edition of the Translation of the New Testament. Whereas in 1962 the translation panel had merely authorized a handful of changes, in 1971 they gave the New Testament text a thorough editing. This Second Edition incorporated Greek manuscripts not previously available to the RSV translation panel, namely, the [[Bodmer Papyri]], published in 1956\u201361.\n\nThe most obvious changes were the restoration of Mark 16.9-20 (the long ending) and John 7.53-8.11 aka The [[Pericope Adulterae]] (in which Jesus forgives an adultress) to the text (in 1946, they were put in footnotes). Also restored was Luke 22.19b-20, containing the bulk of Jesus' institution of the Lord's Supper. In the 1946-52 text, this had been cut off at the phrase, \"This is my body\", and the rest had only been footnoted, since this verse did not appear in the original [[Codex Bezae]] manuscript used by the translation committee.\n\nThe description of Christ's ascension in Luke 24:51 had the footnote \"...and was carried up into heaven\" restored to the text. Luke 22.43-44, which had been part of the text in 1946\u201352, was relegated to the footnote section because of its questionable authenticity; in these verses an angel appears to Jesus in Gethsemane to strengthen and encourage Him before His arrest and crucifixion. Many other verses were rephrased or rewritten for greater clarity and accuracy. Moreover, the footnotes concerning monetary values were no longer expressed in terms of dollars and cents but in terms of how long it took to earn each coin (e. g., the denarius was no longer defined as twenty cents but as a day's wage). The [[Book of Revelation]], called \"The Revelation to John\" in the previous editions, was retitled \"The Revelation to John (The Apocalypse)\".\n\nSome of these changes to the RSV New Testament had already been introduced in the 1965-66 RSV Catholic Edition, and their introduction into the RSV itself was done to pave the way for the publication of the Common Bible in 1973.\n\nThe Standard Bible Committee intended to prepare a second edition of the Old Testament,<ref>\"English Versions of the Bible\". From ''The New Oxford Annotated Bible, Revised Standard Version'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1973.</ref> but those plans were scrapped in 1974, when the National Council of Churches voted to authorize [[New Revised Standard Version|a full revision of the RSV]].\n\n=== Common Bible ===\nThe ''Common Bible'' of 1973 ordered the books in a way that pleased both [[Catholic]]s and [[Protestant]]s. It was divided into four sections: \n# '''The Old Testament''' (39 Books)\n# '''The Catholic Deuterocanonical Books''' (12 Books)\n# '''The additional Eastern Orthodox Deuterocanonical Books''' (three Books; six Books after 1977)\n# '''The New Testament''' (27 Books)\n\nThe non-deuterocanonicals gave the ''Common Bible'' a total of 81 books: it included [[1 Esdras]] (also known as [[3 Ezra]]), [[2 Esdras]] ([[4 Ezra]]), and the [[Prayer of Manasseh]], books that have appeared in the [[Vulgate]]'s appendix since [[Jerome]]'s time \"lest they perish entirely\", but are not considered canonical by Catholics and are thus not included in most modern Catholic Bibles.\n\nIn 1977, the RSV Apocrypha was expanded to include [[3 Maccabees]], [[4 Maccabees]], and [[Psalm 151]], three additional sections accepted in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] canon (4 Maccabees again forming an appendix in that tradition), although it still does not include additional books in the Syriac and Ethiopian canons. This action increased the ''Common Bible'' to 84 Books, making it the most comprehensive English Bible translation to date with its inclusion of books not accepted by all denominations. The goal of the ''Common Bible'' was to help [[Christian ecumenism|ecumenical]] relations among the churches.\n\n=== Reader's Digest Bible ===\nIn 1982, [[Reader's Digest]] published a special edition of the RSV that was billed as a condensed edition of the text. A team of seven editors led by [[John Evangelist Walsh]] produced the manuscript. The Reader's Digest edition was intended for those who did not read the Bible or who read it infrequently; it was not intended as a replacement of the full RSV text. In this version, 55% of the Old Testament and 25% of the New Testament were cut. Familiar passages such as the [[Lord's Prayer]], [[Psalm 23]], and the [[Ten Commandments]] were retained. For those who wanted the full RSV, Reader's Digest provided a list of publishers that sold the complete RSV at that time.\n\n=== Second Catholic Edition ===\nIn early 2006, [[Ignatius Press]] released the [[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition#RSV Second Catholic Edition|''Revised Standard Version, Second Catholic Edition'']] (RSV-2CE). This second edition removed archaic pronouns (''thee'', ''thou''), and accompanying verb forms (''didst'', ''speaketh''), revised passages used in the lectionary according to the Vatican document ''Liturgiam authenticam'', and elevated some passages out of the RSV footnotes when they favored Catholic renderings, such as replacing \"young woman\" with \"virgin\" in Isaiah 7:14.\n\n== Revisions ==\n\n=== New Revised Standard Version ===\n{{Main|New Revised Standard Version}}\n\nIn 1989, the [[National Council of Churches]] released a full-scale revision to the RSV called the [[New Revised Standard Version|'''New Revised Standard Version (NRSV)''']]. It was the first major version to use [[gender-neutral language]] and thus drew more criticism and ire from conservative Christians than did its 1952 predecessor. This criticism largely stemmed from concerns that the modified language obscured phrases in the [[Old Testament]] that could be read as messianic prophecies.\n\n=== English Standard Version ===\n{{Main|English Standard Version}}\n\nAs an alternative to the NRSV, in 2001, publisher [[Crossway Bibles]] released its own [[evangelicalism|Protestant evangelical]] revision of the RSV called the [[English Standard Version|'''English Standard Version (ESV)''']]. This version was commissioned for the purpose of modifying RSV passages that conservatives had long disputed: e.g., the RSV's Isaiah 7:14 usage of the phrase \"young woman\" was changed back to \"virgin\". Unlike its counterpart, it used only a small amount of gender-neutral language.\n\n== Legacy and use today ==\nWhen the [[New Revised Standard Version]] (NRSV) was released in 1989, some traditional Christians &mdash; both Catholic and Protestant &mdash; criticized its wide use of [[gender-inclusive language]].<ref>Whitehead,\nKenneth D.

[[Oxford University Press]] commemorated it by releasing two different Anniversary editions: one with the Old and New Testaments only (with the NT text from 1971), and another including the Apocryphal books as seen in the 1977 Expanded Edition. In an effort to further ecumenical relations, the more extensive 50th Anniversary Edition also included some of the preferred Catholic readings in the text and footnotes of the New Testament section.\n\nMoreover, because of its importance to [[Anglican]] heritage and the English Bible tradition, the ''[[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition#Second Edition|Revised Standard Version, Second Catholic Edition]]'' (RSV-2CE) has been approved for liturgical use in [[Anglican Use]] Catholic parishes of the U.S. [[Pastoral Provision]] and [[Personal Ordinariates]] for former [[Anglicans]] around the world.

The original ''[[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition|Revised Standard Version, Catholic Edition]]'' (RSV-CE) was published in 1965&ndash;66, and the Apocrypha was expanded in 1977. The ''Revised Standard Version, Second Catholic Edition'' (RSV-2CE) was released in 2006.\n\nIn later years, the RSV served as the basis for two revisions&mdash;the [[New Revised Standard Version]] (NRSV) of 1989, and the [[English Standard Version]] (ESV) of 2001.\n\n== Making of the RSV ==\nThe immediate predecessor to the RSV was the [[American Standard Version]], published in 1901 by [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson & Sons]], and copyrighted to protect the ASV text from unauthorized changes. In 1928, the [[International Council of Religious Education]] (ICRE) acquired the copyright to the ASV from Nelson and renewed it the following year.\n\nFrom 1930\u201332, a study of the ASV text was undertaken to decide the question of a new revision, but due to the [[Great Depression]], it was not until 1937 that the ICRE voted in favor of revising the ASV text. A panel of 32 scholars was assembled for that task. Also, the Council hoped to set up a corresponding translation committee in Great Britain, as had been the case with the RV and ASV, but this plan was canceled because of [[World War II]].\n\nFunding for the revision was assured in 1936 by a deal made with the publisher Thomas Nelson & Sons that gave Nelson the exclusive rights to print the new version for ten years. The Committee determined that, since the work would be a revision of the \"Standard Bible\" (as the ASV was sometimes called because of its standard use in seminaries in those days), the name of the work would be the \"Revised Standard Version\".\n\nThe translation panel used the 17th edition of the [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestle-\u00c5land Greek text]] for the [[New Testament]] and the traditional [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Masoretic Text]] for the [[Old Testament]]. In the [[Book of Isaiah]], they sometimes followed readings found in the newly discovered [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].\n\nThe RSV New Testament was published on February 11, 1946. In his presentation speech to the ICRE, [[Luther Weigle]], dean of the translation committee, explained that he wanted the RSV to supplement and not supplant the KJV and ASV.\n\nIn 1950, the ICRE merged with the [[Federal Council of Churches]] to form the [[National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA]]. The former ICRE became the new Council's Division of Christian Education, and the NCC became the RSV's official sponsor.\n\n[[Image:RSV title page.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Title page to the RSV Bible, as seen in the [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Nelson]] editions printed between 1952 and 1971]]\nAfter a thorough examination and approximately 80 changes to the New Testament text, the NCC authorized the RSV Bible for publication in 1951. [[Jerome|St. Jerome's Day]], September 30, 1952, was selected as the day of publication, and on that day, the NCC sponsored a celebratory rally in [[Washington D.C.]], with representatives of the churches affiliated with it present. The very first copy of the RSV Bible to come off the press was presented by Weigle to an appreciative President [[Harry S. Truman]] on September 26, four days before it was released to the general public. [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=14262#.U2w_zpcZkuI.facebook]\n\n== Features ==\n{{unreferenced section|date= December 2014}}\nThere were three key differences between the RSV (on the one hand), and the KJV, RV, and ASV (on the other):\n\n# The translators reverted to the KJV and RV's practice of translating the [[Tetragrammaton]], or the Divine Name, [[YHWH]]. In accordance with the 1611 and 1885 versions, the RSV translated it as \"{{LORD}}\" or \"{{GOD}}\" (depending on whether the Hebrew of the particular verse was read \"[[Adonai]]\" or \"[[Elohim]]\" in Jewish practice), whereas the ASV had translated it \"[[Jehovah]]\".\n# A change was made in the usage of archaic English for [[Grammatical person|second-person]] pronouns, \"[[thou]]\", \"thee\", \"thy\", and verb forms \"art, hast, hadst, didst\", etc. The KJV, RV, and ASV used these terms for addressing both God and humans. The RSV used archaic English pronouns and verbs only for addressing God, a fairly common practice for Bible translations until the mid-1970s.\n# For the New Testament, the RSV followed the latest available version of Nestle's Greek text, whereas the RV and ASV had used the Wescott and Hort Greek text, and the KJV had used the ''[[Textus receptus]]''.\n\n== Reception and controversy ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Good News Translation]] -->\n\n===Isaiah 7:14 dispute and impact===\n{{Main|Isaiah 7:14}}\nThe RSV New Testament was well received, but reactions to the Old Testament were varied and not without controversy.<ref>[[Daniel B. Wallace|Wallace, Daniel B.]], \"The History of the English Bible\" (lecture series with transcripts). http://www.bible.org/page.php?page_id=1825</ref> Critics claimed that the RSV translators had translated the Old Testament from a non-Christian perspective. Some critics specifically referred to a Jewish viewpoint, pointing to agreements with the 1917 [[Jewish Publication Society of America Version]] [[Tanakh]] and the presence on the editorial board of a Jewish scholar, [[Harry Orlinsky]]. Such critics further claimed that other views, including those of the New Testament, were not considered. The focus of the controversy was the RSV's translation of the Hebrew word {{lang|he|\u05e2\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05de\u05b8\u05d4}} ([[almah|''\u02bfalm\u0101h'']]) in [[Isaiah 7:14]] as \"young woman\" rather than the traditional Christian translation of \"virgin\".\n\nOf the seven appearances of ''\u02bfalm\u0101h'', the [[Septuagint]] translates only two of them as ''parthenos'', \"virgin\" (including Isaiah 7:14). By contrast, the word {{lang|he|\u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05ea\u05d5\u05bc\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4}} (''b\u0259\u1e6f\u016bl\u0101h'') appears some 50 times, and the Septuagint and English translations agree in understanding the word to mean \"virgin\" in almost every case.\n\nThe controversy stemming from this rendering helped reignite the [[King-James-Only Movement]] within the Independent Baptist and Pentecostal churches. Furthermore, many Christians have adopted what has come to be known as the \"{{bibleref|Isaiah|7:14|RSV}} litmus test\", which entails checking that verse to determine whether or not a new translation can be trusted.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nIt is notable that some scholars{{which|date=November 2015}} agree that ''almah'' has nothing to do with virginity,{{sfn|Saldarini|2001|p=1007}} as knowledge of the [[Hebrew language]]<ref>[https://translate.google.com/#iw/en/%D7%A2%D6%B7%D7%9C%D7%9E%D6%B8%D7%94 \u05e2\u05dc\u05de\u05d4 on Google translate]</ref> and textual analysis<ref>''Example of Almah explicitly not referring to a virgin'':{{quote|18 There are three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:\n19 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock;\nthe way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a '''young woman'''.\n20 So is the way of an adulterous woman;\nshe eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith: 'I have done no wickedness.' |Proverbs 30 18-20, JPS translation}}\nIn this quote the word translated as \"young woman\" is almah, although some translations translate almah here as \"virgin\".\n</ref> make it possible that \"almah\" means \"young woman\", rather than \"virgin\".\n\n===Protest===\nSome opponents of the RSV took their antagonism beyond condemnation. Luther Hux, a pastor in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, announced his intention to burn a copy of the RSV during a sermon on November 30, 1952. This was reported in the press and attracted shocked reactions, as well as a warning from the local fire chief. On the day in question, he delivered a two-hour sermon entitled \"The National Council Bible, the Master Stroke of Satan\u2014One of the Devil's Greatest Hoaxes\". After the sermon was complete, he led the congregation out of the church, gave each worshipper a small American flag and proceeded to set light to the pages containing Isaiah 7:14. Hux informed the gathered press that he did not burn the Bible, but simply the \"fraud\" that the Isaiah pages represented. Hux would later go on to write a tract against the RSV entitled ''Modernism's Unholy Bible''.<ref name=\"Thuesen2002\">{{cite book|author=[[Peter Johannes Thuesen]]|title=In Discordance with the Scriptures: American Protestant Battles Over Translating the Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Parz1Sxd8BsC&pg=PA97|date=1 May 2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-515228-9|pages=96\u201398}}</ref>\n\nA pastor in the Southern United States burned a copy of the RSV with a [[Blow torch|blowlamp]] in his pulpit, saying that it was like the devil because it was hard to burn and sent the ashes as a protest to Weigle. (However, [[F.F. Bruce]] dismissed it as a publicity stunt and wrote{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} that it had the opposite effect of causing nearly every family in that congregation to acquire a copy.) {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The RSV translators linked these events to the life of [[William Tyndale]], an inspiration to them, explaining in their preface: \"He met bitter opposition. He was accused of willfully perverting the meaning of the Scriptures, and his New Testaments were ordered to be burned as 'untrue translations.'\" But where Tyndale was burned at the stake for his work, [[Bruce Metzger]], referring to the pastor who burned the RSV and sent the ashes to Weigle, commented in his book ''The Bible In Translation'': \"...today it is happily only a copy of the translation that meets such a fate.\" instead of Bible translators.<ref name=\"Metzger2001\">{{cite book|author=Bruce M.

Since there was no [[American Standard Version]] of the Apocrypha, the RSV Apocrypha was a revision of the [[Revised Version]] Apocrypha of 1894 as well as the King James Version. To make the RSV acceptable to individuals and parishes within the [[Orthodox Church]], an expanded edition of the deuterocanonical texts containing 3 and 4 Maccabees and [[Psalm 151]] was released in 1977; in these 1977 additions, as in the [[New Revised Standard Version]], archaic pronouns (such as \"thou\" and \"thee\") and verb forms (such as \"hast\" and \"didst\") are no longer used for God.\n\nMost editions of the RSV that contain the Apocrypha place those books after the New Testament, arranged in the order of the [[King James Version]] (the Eastern Orthodox deuterocanon in post-1977 editions is added at the end). The exceptions are the First and Second Catholic Editions and the Common Bible in which the Apocryphal books were placed in the order of the Roman Catholic [[Biblical canon]] and between the Testaments and rearranged in an order pleasing to Catholics, Orthodox, and Protestants alike, respectively (see below for more information about the Catholic Editions and the Common Bible).\n\n=== Alterations in 1962 printings ===\n{{unreferenced section|date= December 2014}}\nApproximately 85 alterations to the RSV text were authorized in 1959 and introduced into the 1962 printings. At the same time, as Thomas Nelson & Sons was not keeping up with the public demand for the RSV Bible, the NCC authorized other publishing companies besides Nelson to print it, including the [[American Bible Society]], [[Cokesbury]], [[Holman Bible Publishers|Holman]], [[The Melton Book Company|Melton]], [[Oxford University Press]], [[World Publishing Company|World]], [[William Collins, Sons|Collins]], and [[Zondervan]]. Some of the changes included (but were not limited to) reverting to the Greek phrase \"the husband of one wife\" in 1 Timothy 3.2, 12 and Titus 1.6 (in the 1946-52 printing it was paraphrased as \"married only once\"), quoting the Roman [[centurion]]  who witnessed Jesus' death and called him \"the Son of God\" in Matthew 27.54 and Mark 15.39 (in 1946-52 he was quoted as calling Jesus \"a son of God\"), and changing \"without\" in Job 19.26 to \"from\" (and adjusting the associated footnote accordingly).\n\n=== Catholic Edition ===\n{{Main|Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition}}\n\nIn 1965\u201366, the [[Catholic Biblical Association]] adapted, under the editorship of Bernard Orchard OSB and [[Reginald C. Fuller]], the RSV for [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] use with the release of the [[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition|'''Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition (RSV-CE)''']]. A revised New Testament was published in 1965, followed by a full RSV Catholic Edition Bible in 1966. The RSV Catholic Edition included revisions up through 1962, a small number of new revisions to the New Testament, mostly to return to familiar phrases, and changes to a few footnotes. It contains the [[deuterocanonical]] books of the Old Testament placed in the traditional order of the [[Vulgate]].\n\n=== Second Edition of the New Testament ===\nOn March 15, 1971, the RSV Bible was re-released with the Second Edition of the Translation of the New Testament. Whereas in 1962 the translation panel had merely authorized a handful of changes, in 1971 they gave the New Testament text a thorough editing. This Second Edition incorporated Greek manuscripts not previously available to the RSV translation panel, namely, the [[Bodmer Papyri]], published in 1956\u201361.\n\nThe most obvious changes were the restoration of Mark 16.9-20 (the long ending) and John 7.53-8.11 aka The [[Pericope Adulterae]] (in which Jesus forgives an adultress) to the text (in 1946, they were put in footnotes). Also restored was Luke 22.19b-20, containing the bulk of Jesus' institution of the Lord's Supper. In the 1946-52 text, this had been cut off at the phrase, \"This is my body\", and the rest had only been footnoted, since this verse did not appear in the original [[Codex Bezae]] manuscript used by the translation committee.\n\nThe description of Christ's ascension in Luke 24:51 had the footnote \"...and was carried up into heaven\" restored to the text. Luke 22.43-44, which had been part of the text in 1946\u201352, was relegated to the footnote section because of its questionable authenticity; in these verses an angel appears to Jesus in Gethsemane to strengthen and encourage Him before His arrest and crucifixion. Many other verses were rephrased or rewritten for greater clarity and accuracy. Moreover, the footnotes concerning monetary values were no longer expressed in terms of dollars and cents but in terms of how long it took to earn each coin (e. g., the denarius was no longer defined as twenty cents but as a day's wage). The [[Book of Revelation]], called \"The Revelation to John\" in the previous editions, was retitled \"The Revelation to John (The Apocalypse)\".\n\nSome of these changes to the RSV New Testament had already been introduced in the 1965-66 RSV Catholic Edition, and their introduction into the RSV itself was done to pave the way for the publication of the Common Bible in 1973.\n\nThe Standard Bible Committee intended to prepare a second edition of the Old Testament,<ref>\"English Versions of the Bible\". From ''The New Oxford Annotated Bible, Revised Standard Version'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1973.</ref> but those plans were scrapped in 1974, when the National Council of Churches voted to authorize [[New Revised Standard Version|a full revision of the RSV]].\n\n=== Common Bible ===\nThe ''Common Bible'' of 1973 ordered the books in a way that pleased both [[Catholic]]s and [[Protestant]]s. It was divided into four sections: \n# '''The Old Testament''' (39 Books)\n# '''The Catholic Deuterocanonical Books''' (12 Books)\n# '''The additional Eastern Orthodox Deuterocanonical Books''' (three Books; six Books after 1977)\n# '''The New Testament''' (27 Books)\n\nThe non-deuterocanonicals gave the ''Common Bible'' a total of 81 books: it included [[1 Esdras]] (also known as [[3 Ezra]]), [[2 Esdras]] ([[4 Ezra]]), and the [[Prayer of Manasseh]], books that have appeared in the [[Vulgate]]'s appendix since [[Jerome]]'s time \"lest they perish entirely\", but are not considered canonical by Catholics and are thus not included in most modern Catholic Bibles.\n\nIn 1977, the RSV Apocrypha was expanded to include [[3 Maccabees]], [[4 Maccabees]], and [[Psalm 151]], three additional sections accepted in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] canon (4 Maccabees again forming an appendix in that tradition), although it still does not include additional books in the Syriac and Ethiopian canons. This action increased the ''Common Bible'' to 84 Books, making it the most comprehensive English Bible translation to date with its inclusion of books not accepted by all denominations. The goal of the ''Common Bible'' was to help [[Christian ecumenism|ecumenical]] relations among the churches.\n\n=== Reader's Digest Bible ===\nIn 1982, [[Reader's Digest]] published a special edition of the RSV that was billed as a condensed edition of the text. A team of seven editors led by [[John Evangelist Walsh]] produced the manuscript. The Reader's Digest edition was intended for those who did not read the Bible or who read it infrequently; it was not intended as a replacement of the full RSV text. In this version, 55% of the Old Testament and 25% of the New Testament were cut. Familiar passages such as the [[Lord's Prayer]], [[Psalm 23]], and the [[Ten Commandments]] were retained. For those who wanted the full RSV, Reader's Digest provided a list of publishers that sold the complete RSV at that time.\n\n=== Second Catholic Edition ===\nIn early 2006, [[Ignatius Press]] released the [[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition#RSV Second Catholic Edition|''Revised Standard Version, Second Catholic Edition'']] (RSV-2CE). This second edition removed archaic pronouns (''thee'', ''thou''), and accompanying verb forms (''didst'', ''speaketh''), revised passages used in the lectionary according to the Vatican document ''Liturgiam authenticam'', and elevated some passages out of the RSV footnotes when they favored Catholic renderings, such as replacing \"young woman\" with \"virgin\" in Isaiah 7:14.\n\n== Revisions ==\n\n=== New Revised Standard Version ===\n{{Main|New Revised Standard Version}}\n\nIn 1989, the [[National Council of Churches]] released a full-scale revision to the RSV called the [[New Revised Standard Version|'''New Revised Standard Version (NRSV)''']]. It was the first major version to use [[gender-neutral language]] and thus drew more criticism and ire from conservative Christians than did its 1952 predecessor. This criticism largely stemmed from concerns that the modified language obscured phrases in the [[Old Testament]] that could be read as messianic prophecies.\n\n=== English Standard Version ===\n{{Main|English Standard Version}}\n\nAs an alternative to the NRSV, in 2001, publisher [[Crossway Bibles]] released its own [[evangelicalism|Protestant evangelical]] revision of the RSV called the [[English Standard Version|'''English Standard Version (ESV)''']]. This version was commissioned for the purpose of modifying RSV passages that conservatives had long disputed: e.g., the RSV's Isaiah 7:14 usage of the phrase \"young woman\" was changed back to \"virgin\". Unlike its counterpart, it used only a small amount of gender-neutral language.\n\n== Legacy and use today ==\nWhen the [[New Revised Standard Version]] (NRSV) was released in 1989, some traditional Christians &mdash; both Catholic and Protestant &mdash; criticized its wide use of [[gender-inclusive language]].<ref>Whitehead,\nKenneth D. (March, 1997). [http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=2623 \"Inclusive Language: Is It Necessary?\"] New Oxford Review. pp. 6-14.</ref> Because of its significance in the development of the English Bible tradition, many publishers and Biblical scholars continue to rely on the RSV tradition in their work, especially when writing for mixed [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] audiences:\n\n{{quote|[T]he Revised Standard Version of 1946&ndash;1957 was becoming established and, in 1966, was accepted by Catholics and Protestants as a 'Common Bible'. It was the first truly [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] Bible and brought together the two traditions &mdash; the Catholic [[Douay-Rheims Bible]] and the Protestant [[King James Version|Authorised Version]].<ref>[http://www.ordinariate.org.uk/news/OrdinariateNews.php?Mgr-Andrew-Burnham-The-Customary-of-Our-Lady-of-Walsingham-121 Mgr Andrew Burnham: The Customary of Our Lady of Walsingham]</ref>}}\n\nThe year 2002 marked the 50th anniversary of the RSV Bible's first publication. [[Oxford University Press]] commemorated it by releasing two different Anniversary editions: one with the Old and New Testaments only (with the NT text from 1971), and another including the Apocryphal books as seen in the 1977 Expanded Edition. In an effort to further ecumenical relations, the more extensive 50th Anniversary Edition also included some of the preferred Catholic readings in the text and footnotes of the New Testament section.\n\nMoreover, because of its importance to [[Anglican]] heritage and the English Bible tradition, the ''[[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition#Second Edition|Revised Standard Version, Second Catholic Edition]]'' (RSV-2CE) has been approved for liturgical use in [[Anglican Use]] Catholic parishes of the U.S. [[Pastoral Provision]] and [[Personal Ordinariates]] for former [[Anglicans]] around the world. The [[Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham]] in the [[United Kingdom]] has adopted the RSV-2CE as \"the sole lectionary authorized for use\" in its liturgies.[https://web.archive.org/web/20131224115341/http://www.ordinariate.org.uk/liturgy-anglican-use] The RSV is one of the versions authorized to be used in services of the [[Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]].<ref>[http://www.churchpublishing.org/general_convention/pdf_const_2003/Title_II_Worship.pdf The Canons of the General Convention of the Episcopal Church: Canon 2: Of Translations of the Bible] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724114610/https://www.churchpublishing.org/general_convention/pdf_const_2003/Title_II_Worship.pdf |date=2015-07-24 }}</ref>\n\nOn January 20, 2017, incoming [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Donald Trump]] took his inaugural oath of office using a copy of the RSV Bible given to him by his mother in 1955 when he graduated from a [[Presbyterian]] [[Sunday School]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/religion/2017/01/17/donald-trump-sworn-lincoln-family-bibles/96387086/|title=What Bible did Donald Trump use on Inauguration Day?|first=Holly|last=Meyer|publisher=The Tennesean|date=17 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Available editions===\nMeridian Publishing makes the 1962 edition of the RSV available in paperback form.\n\nThe original 1966 edition of the RSV Catholic Edition (RSV-CE) is still published by [[Ignatius Press]], [[Scepter Publishers]], [[Oxford University Press]], [[Saint Benedict Press]], and by Asian Trading Corporation in India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mangalorean.com/news.php?newstype%3Dlocal%26newsid%3D199297 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121081933/http://www.mangalorean.com/news.php?newstype=local&newsid=199297 |archivedate=2015-01-21 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] prints two [[Anglicised|Anglicized]] editions of the 1971 RSV &mdash; a compact edition<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblesociety.org.uk/products/9780564097432/|title=Revised Standard Version (RSV) Popular Compact Holy Bible|website=www.biblesociety.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-10}}</ref> and a standard-size illustrated edition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblesociety.org.uk/products/9780564091348/|title=Revised Standard Version (RSV) Popular Illustrated Holy Bible|website=www.biblesociety.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-10}}</ref> In addition, the Bible Societies  in [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], and [[Nigeria]] make the compact edition available in their own countries with covers designed specifically for those countries.{{citation needed|date= December 2014}}\n\n[[Oxford University Press|Oxford]] continues to make the 1977 RSV edition of the [[Oxford Annotated Bible|New Oxford Annotated Bible]] with the Expanded Apocrypha available in hardcover and genuine leather editions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-new-oxford-annotated-bible-with-the-apocrypha-revised-standard-version-expanded-ed-9780195283488?cc=us&lang=en&|title=The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha, Revised Standard Version, Expanded Ed.|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe RSV-2CE Bible is currently available in various print editions from [[Ignatius Press]], as a [[New Testament]] volume from [[Lighthouse Catholic Media]], and electronically as a popular study Bible app from both.

[[Seismic]] activity discontinuities at about 410&nbsp;km, 520&nbsp;km, and at 670&nbsp;km depth have been attributed to [[Phase transition|phase change]]s involving olivine and its [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]s.\n\nAt the base of the transition zone, [[ringwoodite]] decomposes into [[bridgmanite]] (formerly called magnesium silicate perovskite), and [[ferropericlase]]. Garnet also becomes unstable at or slightly below the base of the transition zone.\n\n[[Kimberlite]]s explode from the earth's interior and sometimes carry rock fragments. Some of these [[xenolith]]ic fragments are diamonds which can only come from the higher pressures below the crust. The rocks that come with this are [[ultramafic]] nodules and peridotite.<ref name=\"habit\"/>\n\n==Chemical composition==\n\nThe composition seems to be very similar to the crust. One difference is that rocks and minerals of the mantle tend to have more magnesium and less silicon and aluminum than the crust. The first four most abundant elements in the upper mantle are oxygen, magnesium, silicon, and iron. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Composition of the Earth's upper mantle (depleted [[MORB]])<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Workman|first=Rhea K.|last2=Hart|first2=Stanley R.|date=February 2005|title=Major and trace element composition of the depleted MORB mantle (DMM)|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=231|issue=1\u20132|pages=53\u201372|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2004.12.005|issn=0012-821X}}</ref><ref name=\"Anderson2007\">{{cite book | title=New Theory of the Earth | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Anderson, D.L. | year=2007 | page=301 | isbn=9780521849593}}</ref>\n!Compound\n!Mass percent\n|-\n|[[Silicon dioxide|SiO<sub>2</sub>]]\n|44.71\n|-\n|[[Magnesium oxide|MgO]]\n|38.73\n|-\n|[[Iron(II) oxide|FeO]]\n|8.18\n|-\n|[[Aluminium oxide|Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>]]\n|3.98\n|-\n|[[Calcium oxide|CaO]]\n|3.17\n|-\n|[[Chromium(III) oxide|Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>]]\n|0.57\n|-\n|[[Nickel(II) oxide|NiO]]\n|0.24\n|-\n|[[Manganese(II) oxide|MnO]]\n|0.13\n|-\n|[[Sodium oxide|Na<sub>2</sub>O]]\n|0.13\n|-\n|[[Titanium dioxide|TiO<sub>2</sub>]]\n|0.13\n|-\n|[[Phosphorus pentoxide|P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]]\n|0.019\n|-\n|[[Potassium oxide|K<sub>2</sub>O]]\n|0.006\n|}\n\n== Exploration ==\n\n[[File:Chikyu (drilling ship) Model.jpg|thumb|Chikyu drilling ship]]\nExploration of the mantle is generally conducted at the seabed rather than on land because of the relative thinness of the oceanic crust as compared to the significantly thicker continental crust.\n\nThe first attempt at mantle exploration, known as [[Project Mohole]], was abandoned in 1966 after repeated failures and cost over-runs.
