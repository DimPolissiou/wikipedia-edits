The Purumaucas had determined to die before losing their freedom and responded that the victors would be masters of the defeated and that the Incas would quickly see how the Purumaucas obeyed. Three or four days after this answer, the Purumaucas and their allies arrived and camped in front of the Incas' camp with 18,000 - 20,000 warriors. The Incas tried diplomacy, offering peace and friendship, claiming they were not going to take their land and property but to give them a way to live as men.

The term \"Nerf gun\" is often used to describe the toy;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/toys/4311795 |title=The Top 10 Nerf Guns of All Time |author=Pinkerton, Lindsey |work=[[Popular Mechanics]] |date=2009-04-03 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}</ref> however, it is often used as a [[Genericised trademark|blanket term]] for any foam dart blaster, regardless of whether or not it has the [[Nerf]] brand name. Nerf blasters are manufactured in multiple forms, including [[pistol]]s, [[rifle]]s, and [[light machine gun]]s. The first Nerf blasters emerged in the late 1980s with the release of the Nerf Blast-a-Ball<ref>[http://nerfguns.org/nerf-blast-a-ball Nerf Blast-a-Ball]</ref> and the Arrowstorm.\n\nThe Nerf blaster line currently consists of eighteen lines: N-Strike Elite, Alien Menace, Dart Tag, Vortex, Zombie Strike, Modulus, Mega, N-Strike, RIVAL, Doomlands, Super Soaker, Accustrike, Rebelle, Modulus Ghost Ops, Laser Ops Pro, Micro Shots, and Mega Accustrike. Cross-promotional models have also been released, themed around [[Marvel Comics]], ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[G.I. Joe]]'', ''[[Fortnite]]'', and ''[[Transformers]]''.\n\nAll Nerf blasters come packaged with a set of foam darts or mega darts matched to fit into their chambers. Refill darts can also be purchased separately. A majority of Nerf blasters are compatible with the different types of foam darts available; but the Magazine System blasters will only take Streamline darts, which have smaller diameter tips. In 2013, Elite darts became the new standard darts, as they are compatible with both regular and Magazine System blasters.\n\nNumerous accessories for Nerf blasters are available separately or supplied with selected blasters. These consist of ammunition holders or attachments that enhance the functional or aesthetic elements of Nerf blasters, as well as some [[Super Soaker]] blasters.\n\nThe Nerf line is also sold in [[Japan]] by [[Takara Tomy]], which sells other Hasbro products in the country. For marketing reasons, some blasters have been given different names in Japan. For example, the Stampede ECS is called \"Blazing Burst ECS\", while the Longstrike CS-6 is called \"Sniper Shot CS-6\"; nevertheless, these blasters still have their original names molded on them.\n\nIn 2011, the Nerf N-Strike Stampede ECS was awarded \"Boy Toy of the Year\" at the 11th Annual Toy of the Year Awards, which is held at the [[American International Toy Fair]] in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://inventorspot.com/articles/11_best_toys_2011_toy_industry_awards |title=The 11 Best Toys of 2011 |author=Per-Lee, Myra |publisher=InventorSpot |accessdate=2011-02-15}}</ref> In 2014, the Nerf Zombie Strike Crossfire Bow won the award for \"Best Action Toy\" at the 2014 U.K. Toy Fair.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.licensemag.com/license-global/uk-toy-fair-2014-toy-winners-announced |title=U.K. Toy Fair: 2014 Toy Winners Announced |publisher=Global License! |date=2014-01-21 |accessdate=2014-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Product lines==\n[[File:Nerf blaster.webm|thumb|300px|Engineering design of a Nerf Triad EX-3 blaster]]\n\n===N-Strike===\n[[File:Nerf (5697272271).jpg|thumb|A man aiming an N-Strike Stampede ECS]]\nN-Strike was the main line of the Blasters toy series. This line consists of toy guns that fire rubber-tipped foam darts. \n\nThe Recon CS-6 is a \"build-your-own\" Nerf Magazine-System Blaster that was released in 2008 under the N-Strike series. It has five interchangeable parts: a barrel extension, flip up sight, dual-mode light beam, stock and main blaster. It resembles the M4 Carbine Rifle. Its Elite successor is the N-Strike Elite Retaliator.\n\nIn 2010, the Stampede ECS - a bi-pod-mounted, battery-powered blaster which is loaded with dart magazines<ref name=\"mechanics\">{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/toys/nerf-stampede-hands-on-review?click=main_sr |title=Nerf Stampede Hands-On Review |author=Porges, Seth |work=[[Popular Mechanics]] |date=2010-08-11 |accessdate=2013-05-25}}</ref> - was awarded \"Boy Toy of the Year\" at the 11th Annual Toy of the Year Awards, which is held at the [[American International Toy Fair]] in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://inventorspot.com/articles/11_best_toys_2011_toy_industry_awards |title=The 11 Best Toys of 2011 |author=Per-Lee, Myra |publisher=InventorSpot |accessdate=2011-02-15}}</ref> ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' praised it as \"the best overall Nerf gun ever\", being easy to use and less prone to jamming than earlier battery-powered Nerf models.<ref name=\"mechanics\"/>\n\n===N-Strike Elite===\nOn August 1, 2012, the N-Strike line was succeeded by the N-Strike Elite, with improved internal mechanisms for better firing distances. Firing distances are up to {{convert|75|ft|m}} for the U.S. models, while international models (identifiable by their grey triggers) have a maximum firing distance of {{convert|15|m|ft}}. The average Nerf blaster fires darts at around 70 feet per second.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hasbro.com/nerf/en_US/n-strike_elite.cfm |title=Nerf N-Strike Elite |publisher=[[Hasbro]] |date=2012-02-10 |accessdate=2013-07-30}}</ref>\n\n====Elite XD====\nElite XD is a sub-series of N-Strike Elite and N-Strike Mega (Mega XD), but with advertised ranges of {{convert|85|to|90|ft|m}} for the US version and {{convert|22|m|ft}} for the international model. Although advertised as having a longer range than the Elite, the only difference in design is the different coloring, it did not affect performance significantly, confirmed by testing Elite XD reshells against their blue counterparts.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Recently, however, Hasbro updated the packaging for Elite XD blasters, no longer claiming a performance boost.\nThe current top elite blaster is the Titan CS-50 which is currently top of the range and comes with a 50 round mag and is fully automatic.\n\n===N-Strike Mega===\nN-Strike Mega, formally N-Strike Mega Series, is a line of blasters which fire red-colored ammunition larger than elite darts in both size and diameter. Nerf had advertised them to fire at \"mega\" ranges of up to 100 feet. In addition, they are also designed to \"whistle\" through the air. The series used to be a sub-series of N-Strike and N-Strike Elite, but evolved into its own series sometime in 2016.\n\n===Zombie Strike===\nThe Zombie Strike series was introduced in mid-2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://io9.com/prepare-for-a-nerf-apocalypse-with-the-new-zombie-strik-743035852 |title=Prepare for a Nerf apocalypse with the new Zombie Strike line! |author=Bricken, Rob |publisher=[[Io9]] |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2013-08-03}}</ref> This series contains blasters similar in performance to that of the N-Strike Elite line, but mostly green, and themed as weapons made from a toolshed. Some blasters in the series are re-skins of N-Strike and N-Strike Elite Blasters.\n====Z.E.D Squad====\nThis sub-series mainly includes blasters previously released, but with a color/design change to fit the \u201czombie\u201d theme of the line.\nThere are only two guns in this series.\n\n====Survival System====\nThis sub-series currently includes only 2 blasters (known as the Scravenger and the Nailbiter). They are mainly orange.\n\n===Rebelle===\nNerf Rebelle is a brand introduced in fall 2013 aimed at the female demographic. As such, the Rebelle blasters incorporate feminine designs and pastel colors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2421144,00.asp |title=Nerf Tips iPhone Scope, Rebelle Line For Girls, Lots More Guns |author=Greenwald, Will |work=[[PC Magazine]] |date=2013-06-28 |accessdate=2013-08-03}}</ref>\n\n===AccuStrike Series===\nAccuStrike Series is a sub-series of N-Strike Elite blasters that was released in spring 2017. It has darts designed for accuracy, with rifling in the dart tips. The darts get less range then N-Strike Elite blasters, but with better accuracy, but the blasters are really no different. They can also shoot up to 75 ft (22 M) with speeds about 70 FPS. The current blasters in the sub-series are the AlphaHawk, FalconFire, RaptorStrike, StratoHawk and the Quadrant.\n\n===Vortex===\nThe Vortex line was launched in 2011.

It is compatible with rail-mounted Nerf attachments via two tactical rails on top.  The blaster is painted in a white, black and orange color scheme with a distinctive raised gold \"ULTRA\" label on the right side (the raised logo is repeated on the left side, but in white, rather than gold). The second blaster was the Ultra ''Two'', which is a 6-round capacity flywheel system revolver, which loads from the back of the blaster, as there is no open place in front. Like the One, the Two comes in the same white, black and orange color scheme, and the \"ULTRA'\" label on the side. It is also the first electronic revolver-style blaster since the 2012 N-Strike Elite Stockade.\n\n==Ammunition and accessories==\nAll Nerf blasters come packaged with a set of ammunition. However, refills of ammunition are also available separately in packs of as little as one to as many as 250, or with accessories or \"clips\" (magazines). With the exception of the Clip System blasters, most Nerf dart blasters are compatible with the different types of foam darts available; the Clip System blasters will only take streamlined darts, which have smaller diameter tips. In 2013, Elite Darts became the new standard darts, as they are compatible with all types of blasters.\n\nSome types of ammunition include:\n[[File:Various Nerf ammo types.jpg|thumb|Various types of ammunition for Nerf and non-Nerf guns.]]\n\n*Suction Darts (old-style; formerly Rip Rockets and Micro Darts) - Foam darts with suction cups that stick to glass windows or flat surfaces.

Their range and groupings are better than darts, and they can also sting a bit when fired. Available in yellow, yellow and red, yellow and blue, and white and black.\n*Mega Whistler Darts (or Mega Dart; trademarked as MEGA Whistler Dart or MEGA Dart) -  Foam darts designed for the Nerf N-Strike Mega line that are larger than Elite Darts in both size and diameter.

The term \"Nerf gun\" is often used to describe the toy;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/toys/4311795 |title=The Top 10 Nerf Guns of All Time |author=Pinkerton, Lindsey |work=[[Popular Mechanics]] |date=2009-04-03 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}</ref> however, it is often used as a [[Genericised trademark|blanket term]] for any foam dart blaster, regardless of whether or not it has the [[Nerf]] brand name. Nerf blasters are manufactured in multiple forms, including [[pistol]]s, [[rifle]]s, and [[light machine gun]]s. The first Nerf blasters emerged in the late 1980s with the release of the Nerf Blast-a-Ball<ref>[http://nerfguns.org/nerf-blast-a-ball Nerf Blast-a-Ball]</ref> and the Arrowstorm.\n\nThe Nerf blaster line currently consists of eighteen lines: N-Strike Elite, Alien Menace, Dart Tag, Vortex, Zombie Strike, Modulus, Mega, N-Strike, RIVAL, Doomlands, Super Soaker, Accustrike, Rebelle, Modulus Ghost Ops, Laser Ops Pro, Micro Shots, and Mega Accustrike. Cross-promotional models have also been released, themed around [[Marvel Comics]], ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[G.I. Joe]]'', ''[[Fortnite]]'', and ''[[Transformers]]''.\n\nAll Nerf blasters come packaged with a set of foam darts or mega darts matched to fit into their chambers. Refill darts can also be purchased separately. A majority of Nerf blasters are compatible with the different types of foam darts available; but the Magazine System blasters will only take Streamline darts, which have smaller diameter tips. In 2013, Elite darts became the new standard darts, as they are compatible with both regular and Magazine System blasters.\n\nNumerous accessories for Nerf blasters are available separately or supplied with selected blasters. These consist of ammunition holders or attachments that enhance the functional or aesthetic elements of Nerf blasters, as well as some [[Super Soaker]] blasters.\n\nThe Nerf line is also sold in [[Japan]] by [[Takara Tomy]], which sells other Hasbro products in the country. For marketing reasons, some blasters have been given different names in Japan. For example, the Stampede ECS is called \"Blazing Burst ECS\", while the Longstrike CS-6 is called \"Sniper Shot CS-6\"; nevertheless, these blasters still have their original names molded on them.\n\nIn 2011, the Nerf N-Strike Stampede ECS was awarded \"Boy Toy of the Year\" at the 11th Annual Toy of the Year Awards, which is held at the [[American International Toy Fair]] in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://inventorspot.com/articles/11_best_toys_2011_toy_industry_awards |title=The 11 Best Toys of 2011 |author=Per-Lee, Myra |publisher=InventorSpot |accessdate=2011-02-15}}</ref> In 2014, the Nerf Zombie Strike Crossfire Bow won the award for \"Best Action Toy\" at the 2014 U.K. Toy Fair.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.licensemag.com/license-global/uk-toy-fair-2014-toy-winners-announced |title=U.K. Toy Fair: 2014 Toy Winners Announced |publisher=Global License! |date=2014-01-21 |accessdate=2014-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Product lines==\n[[File:Nerf blaster.webm|thumb|300px|Engineering design of a Nerf Triad EX-3 blaster]]\n\n===N-Strike===\n[[File:Nerf (5697272271).jpg|thumb|A man aiming an N-Strike Stampede ECS]]\nN-Strike was the main line of the Blasters toy series. This line consists of toy guns that fire rubber-tipped foam darts. \n\nThe Recon CS-6 is a \"build-your-own\" Nerf Magazine-System Blaster that was released in 2008 under the N-Strike series. It has five interchangeable parts: a barrel extension, flip up sight, dual-mode light beam, stock and main blaster. It resembles the M4 Carbine Rifle. Its Elite successor is the N-Strike Elite Retaliator.\n\nIn 2010, the Stampede ECS - a bi-pod-mounted, battery-powered blaster which is loaded with dart magazines<ref name=\"mechanics\">{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/toys/nerf-stampede-hands-on-review?click=main_sr |title=Nerf Stampede Hands-On Review |author=Porges, Seth |work=[[Popular Mechanics]] |date=2010-08-11 |accessdate=2013-05-25}}</ref> - was awarded \"Boy Toy of the Year\" at the 11th Annual Toy of the Year Awards, which is held at the [[American International Toy Fair]] in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://inventorspot.com/articles/11_best_toys_2011_toy_industry_awards |title=The 11 Best Toys of 2011 |author=Per-Lee, Myra |publisher=InventorSpot |accessdate=2011-02-15}}</ref> ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' praised it as \"the best overall Nerf gun ever\", being easy to use and less prone to jamming than earlier battery-powered Nerf models.<ref name=\"mechanics\"/>\n\n===N-Strike Elite===\nOn August 1, 2012, the N-Strike line was succeeded by the N-Strike Elite, with improved internal mechanisms for better firing distances. Firing distances are up to {{convert|75|ft|m}} for the U.S. models, while international models (identifiable by their grey triggers) have a maximum firing distance of {{convert|15|m|ft}}. The average Nerf blaster fires darts at around 70 feet per second.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hasbro.com/nerf/en_US/n-strike_elite.cfm |title=Nerf N-Strike Elite |publisher=[[Hasbro]] |date=2012-02-10 |accessdate=2013-07-30}}</ref>\n\n====Elite XD====\nElite XD is a sub-series of N-Strike Elite and N-Strike Mega (Mega XD), but with advertised ranges of {{convert|85|to|90|ft|m}} for the US version and {{convert|22|m|ft}} for the international model. Although advertised as having a longer range than the Elite, the only difference in design is the different coloring, it did not affect performance significantly, confirmed by testing Elite XD reshells against their blue counterparts.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Recently, however, Hasbro updated the packaging for Elite XD blasters, no longer claiming a performance boost.\nThe current top elite blaster is the Titan CS-50 which is currently top of the range and comes with a 50 round mag and is fully automatic.\n\n===N-Strike Mega===\nN-Strike Mega, formally N-Strike Mega Series, is a line of blasters which fire red-colored ammunition larger than elite darts in both size and diameter. Nerf had advertised them to fire at \"mega\" ranges of up to 100 feet. In addition, they are also designed to \"whistle\" through the air. The series used to be a sub-series of N-Strike and N-Strike Elite, but evolved into its own series sometime in 2016.\n\n===Zombie Strike===\nThe Zombie Strike series was introduced in mid-2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://io9.com/prepare-for-a-nerf-apocalypse-with-the-new-zombie-strik-743035852 |title=Prepare for a Nerf apocalypse with the new Zombie Strike line! |author=Bricken, Rob |publisher=[[Io9]] |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2013-08-03}}</ref> This series contains blasters similar in performance to that of the N-Strike Elite line, but mostly green, and themed as weapons made from a toolshed.\n====Z.E.D Squad====\nThis sub-series mainly includes blasters previously released, but with a color/design change to fit the \u201czombie\u201d theme of the line.\nThere are only two guns in this series.\n\n====Survival System====\nThis sub-series currently includes only 2 blasters (known as the Scravenger and the Nailbiter).

He engaged in conflict with [[Henry II of England|Henry II, King of England]], over the rights and privileges of the Church and was murdered by followers of the king in [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. Soon after his death, he was [[Canonization|canonised]] by [[Pope Alexander III]].\n\n==Sources==\nThe main sources for the life of Becket are a number of biographies written by contemporaries. A few of these documents are by unknown writers, although traditional historiography has given them names. The known biographers are [[John of Salisbury]], [[Edward Grim]], [[Benedict of Peterborough]], [[William of Canterbury]], [[William fitzStephen]], [[Guernes de Pont-Sainte-Maxence|Guernes of Pont-Sainte-Maxence]], [[Robert of Cricklade]], [[Alan of Tewkesbury]], [[Benet of St Albans]], and [[Herbert of Bosham]]. The other biographers, who remain anonymous, are generally given the pseudonyms of Anonymous I, Anonymous II (or Anonymous of Lambeth), and Anonymous III (or Lansdowne Anonymous). Besides these accounts, there are also two other accounts that are likely contemporary that appear in the ''Quadrilogus II'' and the ''[[Th\u00f3mas saga Erkibyskups|Th\u00f3mas saga erkibyskups]]''. Besides these biographies, there is also the mention of the events of Becket's life in the chroniclers of the time. These include [[Robert of Torigni]]'s work, [[Roger of Howden]]'s ''Gesta Regis Henrici Secundi'' and ''Chronica'', [[Ralph Diceto]]'s works, [[William of Newburgh]]'s ''Historia Rerum'', and [[Gervase of Canterbury]]'s works.<ref name=Barlow3>Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' pp. 3\u20139</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n\nBecket was born about 1119,<ref>Butler and Walsh ''Butler's Lives of the Saints'' p. 430</ref> or in 1120 according to later tradition.<ref name=ODNB/> He was born in [[Cheapside]], London, on 21 December, which was the feast day of St Thomas the Apostle. He was the son of Gilbert and Matilda Beket.{{sic}}<!-- Source spelling omits the \"c\"-->{{refn|There is a legend that claims Thomas's mother was a [[Saracen]] princess who met and fell in love with his English father while he was on Crusade or [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] in the [[Holy Land]], followed him home, was baptised and married him.

Gilbert was perhaps related to [[Theobald of Bec]], whose family also was from Thierville. Gilbert began his life as a merchant, perhaps in textiles, but by the 1120s he was living in London and was a property owner, living on the rental income from his properties. He also served as the sheriff of the city at some point.<ref name=ODNB>Barlow \"[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27201 Becket, Thomas (1120?\u20131170)]\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> They were buried in [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]].\n\n[[File:Thomas Becket Memorial Plaque on Cheapside.jpg|thumb|Plaque marking Becket's birthplace along Cheapside]]\n\nOne of Becket's father's wealthy friends, Richer de [[L'Aigle]], often invited Thomas to his estates in [[Sussex]] where Becket was exposed to hunting and hawking. According to Grim, Becket learned much from Richer, who was later a signatory of the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]] against Thomas.<ref name=ODNB/>\n\nBeginning when he was 10, Becket was sent as a student to [[Merton Priory]] in England and later attended a grammar school in London, perhaps the one at St Paul's Cathedral. He did not study any subjects beyond the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]] at these schools. Later, he spent about a year in Paris around age 20. He did not, however, study canon or civil law at this time and his [[Latin]] skill always remained somewhat rudimentary. Some time after Becket began his schooling, Gilbert Beket suffered financial reverses, and the younger Becket was forced to earn a living as a clerk. Gilbert first secured a place for his son in the business of a relative\u2014Osbert Huitdeniers\u2014and then later Becket acquired a position in the household of Theobald of Bec, by now the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref name=ODNB/>\n\nTheobald entrusted him with several important missions to Rome and also sent him to [[Bologna]] and [[Auxerre]] to study [[canon law]]. Theobald in 1154 named Becket [[List of Archdeacons of Canterbury|Archdeacon of Canterbury]], and other ecclesiastical offices included a number of [[benefice]]s, [[Prebendary|prebends]] at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] and St Paul's Cathedral, and the office of [[Provost (religion)|Provost]] of [[Beverley]]. His efficiency in those posts led to Theobald recommending him to King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] for the vacant post of [[Lord Chancellor]],<ref name=ODNB/> to which Becket was appointed in January 1155.<ref name=Handbook84>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p.  84</ref>\n\nAs Chancellor, Becket enforced the king's traditional sources of revenue that were exacted from all landowners, including churches and bishoprics.<ref name=ODNB/> King Henry sent his son [[Henry the Young King|Henry]] to live in Becket's household, it being the custom then for noble children to be fostered out to other noble houses.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Primacy==\nBecket was nominated as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1162, several months after the death of Theobald. His election was confirmed on 23 May 1162 by a royal council of bishops and noblemen.<ref name=ODNB/> Henry may have hoped that Becket would continue to put the royal government first, rather than the church. However, the famous transformation of Becket into an [[ascetic]] occurred at this time.<ref name=Huscroft192>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 192\u2013195</ref>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Becket enthroned as Archbishop of Canterbury from a [[Nottingham Alabaster]] in the [[Victoria & Albert Museum]]\" heights=\"200px\">\nImage:StThomasEnthroned.jpg\nImage:StThomasReturn.jpg\nImage:StThomasSens.jpg\n</gallery>\n\nBecket was ordained a priest on 2 June 1162 at Canterbury, and on 3 June 1162 was [[Consecration#Ordination_of_bishops|consecrated]] as archbishop by [[Henry of Blois]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]] and the other [[suffragan bishop]]s of Canterbury.<ref name=ODNB/>\n\nA rift grew between Henry and Becket as the new archbishop resigned his [[chancellor|chancellorship]] and sought to recover and extend the rights of the [[archbishopric]]. This led to a series of conflicts with the King, including that over the jurisdiction of secular courts over English clergymen, which accelerated antipathy between Becket and the king. Attempts by Henry to influence the other bishops against Becket began in [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]] in October 1163, where the King sought approval of the traditional rights of the royal government in regard to the church.<ref name=ODNB/> This led to the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]], where Becket was officially asked to agree to the King's rights or face political repercussions.\n\n==Constitutions of Clarendon==\n{{Main article|Becket controversy}}\n{{details|Constitutions of Clarendon}}\n\n[[File:Jindrich2 Beckett.jpg|170px|14th-century depiction of Becket with King Henry II|thumb|left|alt=Manuscript illustration.

Behind the mitred figure are a number of standing men wearing armour and carrying weapons.]]King Henry II presided over the assemblies of most of the higher English clergy at [[Clarendon Palace]] on 30 January 1164. In sixteen constitutions, he sought less clerical independence and a weaker connection with Rome. He employed all his skills to induce their consent and was apparently successful with all but Becket. Finally, even Becket expressed his willingness to agree to the substance of the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]], but he still refused to formally sign the documents. Henry summoned Becket to appear before a great council at [[Northampton Castle]] on 8 October 1164, to answer allegations of contempt of royal authority and [[malfeasance]] in the Chancellor's office. Convicted on the charges, Becket stormed out of the trial and fled to the [[Continental Europe|Continent]].<ref name=ODNB/>\n\nHenry pursued the fugitive archbishop with a series of [[Edict|edicts]], targeting Becket as well as all of Becket's friends and supporters, but King [[Louis VII of France]] offered Becket protection. He spent nearly two years in the [[Cistercian]] [[abbey]] of [[Pontigny Abbey|Pontigny]], until Henry's threats against the order obliged him to return to [[Sens]]. Becket fought back by threatening [[excommunication]] and [[interdict]] against the king and bishops and the kingdom, but [[Pope Alexander III]], though sympathising with him in theory, favoured a more diplomatic approach. [[Papal legates]] were sent in 1167 with authority to act as arbitrators.<ref name=ODNB/>\n[[File:Arbroath Abbey Seal 01.jpg|thumb|A [[Seal (device)|Seal]] of the [[Abbot of Arbroath|Abbot]] of [[Arbroath]], showing the murder of Becket.

According to accounts left by the monk Gervase of Canterbury and eyewitness Edward Grim, they placed their weapons under a tree outside the cathedral and hid their [[mail (armour)|mail armour]] under cloaks before entering to challenge Becket. The knights informed Becket he was to go to [[Winchester]] to give an account of his actions, but Becket refused.

The knights found Becket in a spot near a door to the monastic cloister, the stairs into the crypt, and the stairs leading up into the [[Choir (architecture)|quire]] of the cathedral, where the monks were chanting vespers.<ref name=ODNB/>  Upon seeing them, Becket said, \"I am no traitor and I am ready to die.\" One knight grabbed him and tried to pull him outside, but Becket grabbed onto a pillar and bowed his head to make peace with God.{{cn|date=March 2019}} \n\n[[File:Place_of_murder_in_Canterbury_cathedral.jpg|thumb|Sculpture and altar marking the spot of Thomas Becket's martyrdom, Canterbury Cathedral.

They were not arrested and neither did Henry confiscate their lands, but he did not help them when they sought his advice in August 1171. Pope Alexander excommunicated all four. Seeking forgiveness, the assassins travelled to Rome and were ordered by the Pope to serve as knights in the Holy Lands for a period of fourteen years.<ref name=\"Barlow pp. 257\">Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' pp. 257\u2013258</ref>\n\nThis sentence also inspired the [[Knights of Saint Thomas]], incorporated in 1191 at [[Acre, Israel#Second Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem (1191-1291)|Acre]], and which was to be modelled on the [[Teutonic Knights]]. This was the only military order native to England (with chapters in not only Acre, but London, Kilkenny, and Nicosia), just as the [[Gilbertine Order]] was the only monastic order native to England. Nevertheless, [[Henry VIII]] dissolved both of these English institutions at the time of the Reformation, rather than merging them with foreign orders or nationalising them as elements of the Protestant Church of England.\n\nThe monks were afraid that Becket's body might be stolen. To prevent this, Becket's remains were placed beneath the floor of the eastern [[crypt]] of the cathedral.<ref name=\"Barlow pp. 257\"/> A stone cover was placed over the burial place with two holes where [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] could insert their heads and kiss the tomb;<ref name=ODNB/> this arrangement is illustrated in the \"Miracle Windows\" of the Trinity Chapel. A guard chamber (now called the Wax Chamber) had a clear view of the grave.

The [[Bridge House Estates]] seal used only the image of Becket, while the reverse featured a depiction of his martyrdom.\n\nLocal legends regarding Becket arose after his canonisation. Though they tend toward typical [[hagiography|hagiographical stories]], they also display Becket's well-known gruffness. \"Becket's Well\", in [[Otford]], [[Kent]], is said to have been created after Becket had become displeased with the taste of the local water. Two springs of clear water are said to have bubbled up after he struck the ground with his [[crozier]]. The absence of nightingales in Otford is also ascribed to Becket, who is said to have been so disturbed in his devotions by the song of a nightingale that he commanded that none should sing in the town ever again. In the town of [[Strood]], also in Kent, Becket is said to have caused the inhabitants of the town and their descendants to be born with tails. The men of Strood had sided with the king in his struggles against the archbishop, and to demonstrate their support, had cut off the tail of Becket's horse as he passed through the town.\n\nThe saint's fame quickly spread throughout the [[Normans|Norman]] world. The first holy image of Becket is thought to be a mosaic icon still visible in [[Monreale]] Cathedral, in [[Sicily]], created shortly after his death. Becket's cousins obtained refuge at the Sicilian court during his exile, and King [[William II of Sicily|William II]] of Sicily wed a daughter of Henry II. [[Marsala Cathedral]] in western Sicily is dedicated to St Thomas Becket. Over forty-five medieval [[chasse (casket)|chasse]] [[reliquaries]] decorated in [[champlev\u00e9 enamel]] showing similar scenes from Becket's life survive, including the [[Becket Casket]], originally constructed to hold relics of the saint at [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough Abbey]], and now housed in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:SouthNewington StPeterAdVincula StThomasBeckettMartyrdom.JPG|thumb|Wall painting of Thomas Becket's martyrdom painted in the 1330s in the parish church of [[St Peter ad Vincula, South Newington#Wall paintings|St Peter ad Vincula, South Newington]], Oxfordshire]]\n\n* In 1170 the king of Castille [[Alfonso VIII]] married [[Eleanor of England|Eleanor Plantagenet]], the second daughter of Henry II.

He engaged in conflict with [[Henry II of England|Henry II, King of England]], over the rights and privileges of the Church and was murdered by followers of the king in [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. Soon after his death, he was [[Canonization|canonised]] by [[Pope Alexander III]].\n\n==Sources==\nThe main sources for the life of Becket are a number of biographies written by contemporaries. A few of these documents are by unknown writers, although traditional historiography has given them names. The known biographers are [[John of Salisbury]], [[Edward Grim]], [[Benedict of Peterborough]], [[William of Canterbury]], [[William fitzStephen]], [[Guernes de Pont-Sainte-Maxence|Guernes of Pont-Sainte-Maxence]], [[Robert of Cricklade]], [[Alan of Tewkesbury]], [[Benet of St Albans]], and [[Herbert of Bosham]]. The other biographers, who remain anonymous, are generally given the pseudonyms of Anonymous I, Anonymous II (or Anonymous of Lambeth), and Anonymous III (or Lansdowne Anonymous). Besides these accounts, there are also two other accounts that are likely contemporary that appear in the ''Quadrilogus II'' and the ''[[Th\u00f3mas saga Erkibyskups|Th\u00f3mas saga erkibyskups]]''. Besides these biographies, there is also the mention of the events of Becket's life in the chroniclers of the time. These include [[Robert of Torigni]]'s work, [[Roger of Howden]]'s ''Gesta Regis Henrici Secundi'' and ''Chronica'', [[Ralph Diceto]]'s works, [[William of Newburgh]]'s ''Historia Rerum'', and [[Gervase of Canterbury]]'s works.<ref name=Barlow3>Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' pp. 3\u20139</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n\nBecket was born about 1119,<ref>Butler and Walsh ''Butler's Lives of the Saints'' p. 430</ref> or in 1120 according to later tradition.<ref name=ODNB/> He was born in [[Cheapside]], London, on 21 December, which was the feast day of St Thomas the Apostle. He was the son of Gilbert and Matilda Beket.{{sic}}<!-- Source spelling omits the \"c\"-->{{refn|There is a legend that claims Thomas's mother was a [[Saracen]] princess who met and fell in love with his English father while he was on Crusade or [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] in the [[Holy Land]], followed him home, was baptised and married him.

Gilbert was perhaps related to [[Theobald of Bec]], whose family also was from Thierville. Gilbert began his life as a merchant, perhaps in textiles, but by the 1120s he was living in London and was a property owner, living on the rental income from his properties. He also served as the sheriff of the city at some point.<ref name=ODNB>Barlow \"[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27201 Becket, Thomas (1120?\u20131170)]\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> They were buried in [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]].\n\n[[File:Thomas Becket Memorial Plaque on Cheapside.jpg|thumb|Plaque marking Becket's birthplace along Cheapside]]\n\nOne of Becket's father's wealthy friends, Richer de [[L'Aigle]], often invited Thomas to his estates in [[Sussex]] where Becket was exposed to hunting and hawking. According to Grim, Becket learned much from Richer, who was later a signatory of the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]] against Thomas.<ref name=ODNB/>\n\nBeginning when he was 10, Becket was sent as a student to [[Merton Priory]] in England and later attended a grammar school in London, perhaps the one at St Paul's Cathedral. He did not study any subjects beyond the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]] at these schools. Later, he spent about a year in Paris around age 20. He did not, however, study canon or civil law at this time and his [[Latin]] skill always remained somewhat rudimentary. Some time after Becket began his schooling, Gilbert Beket suffered financial reverses, and the younger Becket was forced to earn a living as a clerk. Gilbert first secured a place for his son in the business of a relative\u2014Osbert Huitdeniers\u2014and then later Becket acquired a position in the household of Theobald of Bec, by now the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref name=ODNB/>\n\nTheobald entrusted him with several important missions to Rome and also sent him to [[Bologna]] and [[Auxerre]] to study [[canon law]]. Theobald in 1154 named Becket [[List of Archdeacons of Canterbury|Archdeacon of Canterbury]], and other ecclesiastical offices included a number of [[benefice]]s, [[Prebendary|prebends]] at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] and St Paul's Cathedral, and the office of [[Provost (religion)|Provost]] of [[Beverley]]. His efficiency in those posts led to Theobald recommending him to King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] for the vacant post of [[Lord Chancellor]],<ref name=ODNB/> to which Becket was appointed in January 1155.<ref name=Handbook84>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p.  84</ref>\n\nAs Chancellor, Becket enforced the king's traditional sources of revenue that were exacted from all landowners, including churches and bishoprics.<ref name=ODNB/> King Henry sent his son [[Henry the Young King|Henry]] to live in Becket's household, it being the custom then for noble children to be fostered out to other noble houses.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Primacy==\nBecket was nominated as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1162, several months after the death of Theobald. His election was confirmed on 23 May 1162 by a royal council of bishops and noblemen.<ref name=ODNB/> Henry may have hoped that Becket would continue to put the royal government first, rather than the church. However, the famous transformation of Becket into an [[ascetic]] occurred at this time.<ref name=Huscroft192>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 192\u2013195</ref>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Becket enthroned as Archbishop of Canterbury from a [[Nottingham Alabaster]] in the [[Victoria & Albert Museum]]\" heights=\"200px\">\nImage:StThomasEnthroned.jpg\nImage:StThomasReturn.jpg\nImage:StThomasSens.jpg\n</gallery>\n\nBecket was ordained a priest on 2 June 1162 at Canterbury, and on 3 June 1162 was [[Consecration#Ordination_of_bishops|consecrated]] as archbishop by [[Henry of Blois]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]] and the other [[suffragan bishop]]s of Canterbury.<ref name=ODNB/>\n\nA rift grew between Henry and Becket as the new archbishop resigned his [[chancellor|chancellorship]] and sought to recover and extend the rights of the [[archbishopric]]. This led to a series of conflicts with the King, including that over the jurisdiction of secular courts over English clergymen, which accelerated antipathy between Becket and the king. Attempts by Henry to influence the other bishops against Becket began in [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]] in October 1163, where the King sought approval of the traditional rights of the royal government in regard to the church.<ref name=ODNB/> This led to the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]], where Becket was officially asked to agree to the King's rights or face political repercussions.\n\n==Constitutions of Clarendon==\n{{Main article|Becket controversy}}\n{{details|Constitutions of Clarendon}}\n\n[[File:Jindrich2 Beckett.jpg|170px|14th-century depiction of Becket with King Henry II|thumb|left|alt=Manuscript illustration.

Behind the mitred figure are a number of standing men wearing armour and carrying weapons.]]King Henry II presided over the assemblies of most of the higher English clergy at [[Clarendon Palace]] on 30 January 1164. In sixteen constitutions, he sought less clerical independence and a weaker connection with Rome. He employed all his skills to induce their consent and was apparently successful with all but Becket. Finally, even Becket expressed his willingness to agree to the substance of the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]], but he still refused to formally sign the documents. Henry summoned Becket to appear before a great council at [[Northampton Castle]] on 8 October 1164, to answer allegations of contempt of royal authority and [[malfeasance]] in the Chancellor's office. Convicted on the charges, Becket stormed out of the trial and fled to the [[Continental Europe|Continent]].<ref name=ODNB/>\n\nHenry pursued the fugitive archbishop with a series of [[Edict|edicts]], targeting Becket as well as all of Becket's friends and supporters, but King [[Louis VII of France]] offered Becket protection. He spent nearly two years in the [[Cistercian]] [[abbey]] of [[Pontigny Abbey|Pontigny]], until Henry's threats against the order obliged him to return to [[Sens]]. Becket fought back by threatening [[excommunication]] and [[interdict]] against the king and bishops and the kingdom, but [[Pope Alexander III]], though sympathising with him in theory, favoured a more diplomatic approach. [[Papal legates]] were sent in 1167 with authority to act as arbitrators.<ref name=ODNB/>\n[[File:Arbroath Abbey Seal 01.jpg|thumb|A [[Seal (device)|Seal]] of the [[Abbot of Arbroath|Abbot]] of [[Arbroath]], showing the murder of Becket.

According to accounts left by the monk Gervase of Canterbury and eyewitness Edward Grim, they placed their weapons under a tree outside the cathedral and hid their [[mail (armour)|mail armour]] under cloaks before entering to challenge Becket. The knights informed Becket he was to go to [[Winchester]] to give an account of his actions, but Becket refused. It was not until Becket refused their demands to submit to the king's will that they retrieved their weapons and rushed back inside for the killing.<ref name=APS>Stanley ''Historical Memorials of Canterbury'' pp. 53\u201355</ref> Becket, meanwhile, proceeded to the main hall for [[vespers]]. The other monks tried to bolt themselves in for safety, but Becket said to them, \"It is not right to make a fortress out of the house of prayer!,\" ordering them to reopen the doors. \n\nThe four knights, wielding drawn swords, ran into the room saying \"Where is Thomas Becket, traitor to the King and country?!\".  The knights found Becket in a spot near a door to the monastic cloister, the stairs into the crypt, and the stairs leading up into the [[Choir (architecture)|quire]] of the cathedral, where the monks were chanting vespers.<ref name=ODNB/>  Upon seeing them, Becket said, \"I am no traitor and I am ready to die.\" One knight grabbed him and tried to pull him outside, but Becket grabbed onto a pillar and bowed his head to make peace with God.{{cn|date=March 2019}} \n\n[[File:Place_of_murder_in_Canterbury_cathedral.jpg|thumb|Sculpture and altar marking the spot of Thomas Becket's martyrdom, Canterbury Cathedral.

This is part of his account:\n\n{{quote|...the impious knight... suddenly set upon him and [shaved] off the summit of his crown which the sacred chrism consecrated to God...

The fifth \u2013 not a knight but a cleric who had entered with the knights... placed his foot on the neck of the holy priest and precious martyr and (it is horrible to say) scattered the brains with the blood across the floor, exclaiming to the rest, 'We can leave this place, knights, he will not get up again.'<ref name=\"Lee2012\">Lee ''This Sceptred Isle'' p. 97</ref>}}\n\nAnother account can be found in ''Expugnatio Hibernica'' (\"Conquest of Ireland\", 1189) written by [[Giraldus Cambrensis|Gerald of Wales]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Giraldus Cambrensis \u2013 The Conquest of Ireland|last=Forester|first=Thomas|publisher=In Parentheses Publications|year=2001|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Ontario|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==After Becket's death==\n[[File:158 Santa Maria de Terrassa, cicle de Tom\u00e0s Becket.jpg|thumb|200px|right| St Thomas Becket's consecration, death and burial, at wall paintings in Santa Maria de Terrassa ([[Terrassa]], Catalonia, Spain), romanesque frescoes, c. 1200]]\n\nFollowing Becket's death, the monks prepared his body for burial.<ref name=ODNB/> According to some accounts, it was discovered that Becket had worn a [[cilice|hairshirt]] under his archbishop's garments\u2014a sign of penance.<ref>Grim, Benedict of Peterborough and William fitzStephen are quoted in Douglas, et al.

De Morville also held property in [[Cumbria]] and this may also have provided a convenient bolt-hole, as the men prepared for a longer stay in the separate kingdom of Scotland. They were not arrested and neither did Henry confiscate their lands, but he did not help them when they sought his advice in August 1171. Pope Alexander excommunicated all four. Seeking forgiveness, the assassins travelled to Rome and were ordered by the Pope to serve as knights in the Holy Lands for a period of fourteen years.<ref name=\"Barlow pp. 257\">Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' pp. 257\u2013258</ref>\n\nThis sentence also inspired the [[Knights of Saint Thomas]], incorporated in 1191 at [[Acre, Israel#Second Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem (1191-1291)|Acre]], and which was to be modelled on the [[Teutonic Knights]]. This was the only military order native to England (with chapters in not only Acre, but London, Kilkenny, and Nicosia), just as the [[Gilbertine Order]] was the only monastic order native to England. Nevertheless, [[Henry VIII]] dissolved both of these English institutions at the time of the Reformation, rather than merging them with foreign orders or nationalising them as elements of the Protestant Church of England.\n\nThe monks were afraid that Becket's body might be stolen. To prevent this, Becket's remains were placed beneath the floor of the eastern [[crypt]] of the cathedral.<ref name=\"Barlow pp. 257\"/> A stone cover was placed over the burial place with two holes where [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] could insert their heads and kiss the tomb;<ref name=ODNB/> this arrangement is illustrated in the \"Miracle Windows\" of the Trinity Chapel.

The [[Bridge House Estates]] seal used only the image of Becket, while the reverse featured a depiction of his martyrdom.\n\nLocal legends regarding Becket arose after his canonisation. Though they tend toward typical [[hagiography|hagiographical stories]], they also display Becket's well-known gruffness. \"Becket's Well\", in [[Otford]], [[Kent]], is said to have been created after Becket had become displeased with the taste of the local water. Two springs of clear water are said to have bubbled up after he struck the ground with his [[crozier]]. The absence of nightingales in Otford is also ascribed to Becket, who is said to have been so disturbed in his devotions by the song of a nightingale that he commanded that none should sing in the town ever again. In the town of [[Strood]], also in Kent, Becket is said to have caused the inhabitants of the town and their descendants to be born with tails. The men of Strood had sided with the king in his struggles against the archbishop, and to demonstrate their support, had cut off the tail of Becket's horse as he passed through the town.\n\nThe saint's fame quickly spread throughout the [[Normans|Norman]] world. The first holy image of Becket is thought to be a mosaic icon still visible in [[Monreale]] Cathedral, in [[Sicily]], created shortly after his death. Becket's cousins obtained refuge at the Sicilian court during his exile, and King [[William II of Sicily|William II]] of Sicily wed a daughter of Henry II. [[Marsala Cathedral]] in western Sicily is dedicated to St Thomas Becket. Over forty-five medieval [[chasse (casket)|chasse]] [[reliquaries]] decorated in [[champlev\u00e9 enamel]] showing similar scenes from Becket's life survive, including the [[Becket Casket]], originally constructed to hold relics of the saint at [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough Abbey]], and now housed in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:SouthNewington StPeterAdVincula StThomasBeckettMartyrdom.JPG|thumb|Wall painting of Thomas Becket's martyrdom painted in the 1330s in the parish church of [[St Peter ad Vincula, South Newington#Wall paintings|St Peter ad Vincula, South Newington]], Oxfordshire]]\n\n* In 1170 the king of Castille [[Alfonso VIII]] married [[Eleanor of England|Eleanor Plantagenet]], the second daughter of Henry II.

Maybury''' (born October 10, 1946) is the publisher of ''U.S. & World Early Warning Report for Investors''.  He has written several entry level books on United States economics, law, and history from a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] perspective. He has written these things in [[Epistolary novel|epistolatory]] form, usually as an uncle writing to his nephew, answering questions. Maybury was a high school economics teacher. After failing to find a book which would give a clear explanation on his view of economics he wrote one himself. Some of his books include ''Uncle Eric Talks About Personal, Career & Financial Security''; a book that is basically the foundation for his other books about the model perspective and Higher Law, ''Whatever Happened to Penny Candy?''; a book that explains the history of the [United States] economic model and how it was based on [[free-market]] [[Austrian economics]], ''Whatever Happened to [[Justice]]?''; a book about his juris naturalist philosophical viewpoints regarding the foundations of America's legal system, British [[Common Law]], the law of the [[Franks]], and early Christian Ireland.<ref>https://mises.org/profile/richard-j-maybury</ref>\n\n==Early life and family==\nRichard J. Maybury was born on October 10, 1946 in Hamilton, Ohio, to parents Anthony J. and Ruth M. (''n\u00e9e'' Wellinghoff) Maybury. He married Marilyn N. Williams on August 7, 1967.<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/maybury-richard-j-1946</ref>\n\n==Theories==\n\n===Juris Naturalism===\nMaybury's viewpoint is \"juris naturalism\". Maybury created the term juris naturalism, and called himself a juris naturalist, because he believed no other label was able to fully describe the concept, which he believed is modeled on the viewpoints of many of America's Founders.\n\n===Thousand Year War===\nMaybury has had disagreements with those who say that [[Muslims]] are terrorists. In his book, The Thousand Year War, he says that Muslims have been persecuted as much as the [[Jews]] by Western civilization through events such as the [[Crusades]], and that they are retaliating after being wronged by the Europeans and the western culture, including the United States government. Maybury states that Muslim nations and people still treat events that occurred centuries ago as modern-day events, and that the recent attacks are retaliatory strikes against what they perceive to be their long-time enemies. He praises the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Muslim civilizations for their advances in many fields. He also states that Muslims are responsible for preserving the philosophies of ancient people, such as [[Aristotle]].\n\n===Maybury's Two Laws===\nMr. Maybury bases his work on common law, namely\n* Do all you have agreed to do\n* Do not encroach on other persons or their property.\n\nThe first law is related to contract law.  A contract is an agreement between two or more parties, in which they promise to perform certain actions for and recognize certain rights of the other parties.  The second law is related to some [[criminal law]] and [[tort]] law.  Violators of these types of laws have committed acts like theft or violence against other people. (When referencing these two laws, Maybury has at times requested they be known as \"Maybury's Laws,\" and stated exactly as above.) He has also mentioned that there may be another (or others) undiscovered law related to the subjects of law that the two he shows don't cover.\n\n===Chaostan===\nMr. Maybury has declared that nearly a third of the Earth's surface is ''Chaostan'', the land of great [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]. Chaostan is in his view prone to war, financial ill, and [[tyranny]] because they never received the Two Laws. The area extends from the Arctic Ocean to the Indian Ocean and [[Poland]] to the Pacific, plus North Africa.\n\n===The New Axis===\nMr. Maybury thinks it is possible that some or all of the areas in Chaostan are secretly co-operating, either through political alliance or along ancient ethnic lines. This term was first used in May 1996.\n\n==Military Experience==\nMr. Maybury was a sergeant in the [[USAF|United States Air Force]] from 1967 to 1971. He served with the 605th Air Commando Squadron in Central America, and with the 75th Military Airlift Squadron in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. He was also a General Military Training instructor at [[Travis Air Force Base]]; and participated in covert operations in South and Central America.\n\n==Books==\n===Themes===\nMr. Maybury's books are marked with emphasis on paradigms, or \"models\" as he calls them. One of his books, ''Are You Liberal, Conservative, or Confused'' is dedicated entirely to this topic. He commonly addresses his letters to an imaginary student named Chris.\n\n===Style===\nAll of his books are written in the [[Epistolary novel|epistolatory]] style, as letters from the fictitious Uncle Eric to his nephew. The personal tone of the \"letters\" convey a certain sense of urgency, yet are remarkably understated compared to other revisionist and contrarian viewpoints.\n\nThe books have many illustrations, maps and pull-quotations of historical persons.  Though, oddly to some, he rarely if ever quotes recent (20th century) writers.  Perhaps it is because he distills the essence of free-market economic thought (what we often call \"Libertarian\") into fundamental terms that stand on their own.  In other words, rather than quoting for instance [[Henry Hazlitt]] to support a thesis, he describes an idea in foundational terms that arrive at a conclusion that readers of Hazlitt may find familiar.\n\n===Titles===\n{{Infobox book\n  | name           =  Whatever Happened to Penny Candy, 5th Edition\n  | title_orig     =\n  | translator     =\n  | image          =  \n  | author         =  Richard J.

Maybury''' (born October 10, 1946) is the publisher of ''U.S. & World Early Warning Report for Investors''.  He has written several entry level books on United States economics, law, and history from a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] perspective. He has written these things in [[Epistolary novel|epistolatory]] form, usually as an uncle writing to his nephew, answering questions. Maybury was a high school economics teacher. After failing to find a book which would give a clear explanation on his view of economics he wrote one himself. Some of his books include ''Uncle Eric Talks About Personal, Career & Financial Security''; a book that is basically the foundation for his other books about the model perspective and Higher Law, ''Whatever Happened to Penny Candy?''; a book that explains the history of the [United States] economic model and how it was based on [[free-market]] [[Austrian economics]], ''Whatever Happened to [[Justice]]?''; a book about his juris naturalist philosophical viewpoints regarding the foundations of America's legal system, British [[Common Law]], the law of the [[Franks]], and early Christian Ireland.<ref>https://mises.org/profile/richard-j-maybury</ref>\n\n==Early life and family==\nRichard J. Maybury was born on October 10, 1946 in Hamilton, Ohio, to parents Anthony J. and Ruth M. (''n\u00e9e'' Wellinghoff) Maybury. He married Marilyn N. Williams on August 7, 1967.<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/maybury-richard-j-1946</ref>\n\n==Theories==\n\n===Juris Naturalism===\nMaybury's viewpoint is \"juris naturalism\". Maybury created the term juris naturalism, and called himself a juris naturalist, because he believed no other label was able to fully describe the concept, which he believed is modeled on the viewpoints of many of America's Founders.\n\n===Thousand Year War===\nMaybury has had disagreements with those who say that [[Muslims]] are terrorists. In his book, The Thousand Year War, he says that Muslims have been persecuted as much as the [[Jews]] by Western civilization through events such as the [[Crusades]], and that they are retaliating after being wronged by the Europeans and the western culture, including the United States government. Maybury states that Muslim nations and people still treat events that occurred centuries ago as modern-day events, and that the recent attacks are retaliatory strikes against what they perceive to be their long-time enemies. He praises the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Muslim civilizations for their advances in many fields. He also states that Muslims are responsible for preserving the philosophies of ancient people, such as [[Aristotle]].\n\n===Maybury's Two Laws===\nMr. Maybury bases his work on common law, namely\n* Do all you have agreed to do\n* Do not encroach on other persons or their property.\n\nThe first law is related to contract law.  A contract is an agreement between two or more parties, in which they promise to perform certain actions for and recognize certain rights of the other parties.  The second law is related to some [[criminal law]] and [[tort]] law.  Violators of these types of laws have committed acts like theft or violence against other people. (When referencing these two laws, Maybury has at times requested they be known as \"Maybury's Laws,\" and stated exactly as above.) He has also mentioned that there may be an other (or others) undiscovered law related to the subjects of law that the two he shows don't cover.\n\n===Chaostan===\nMr. Maybury has declared that nearly a third of the Earth's surface is ''Chaostan'', the land of great [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]. Chaostan is in his view prone to war, financial ill, and [[tyranny]] because they never received the Two Laws. The area extends from the Arctic Ocean to the Indian Ocean and [[Poland]] to the Pacific, plus North Africa.\n\n===The New Axis===\nMr. Maybury thinks it is possible that some or all of the areas in Chaostan are secretly co-operating, either through political alliance or along ancient ethnic lines. This term was first used in May 1996.\n\n==Military Experience==\nMr. Maybury was a sergeant in the [[USAF|United States Air Force]] from 1967 to 1971. He served with the 605th Air Commando Squadron in Central America, and with the 75th Military Airlift Squadron in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. He was also a General Military Training instructor at [[Travis Air Force Base]]; and participated in covert operations in South and Central America.\n\n==Books==\n===Themes===\nMr. Maybury's books are marked with emphasis on paradigms, or \"models\" as he calls them. One of his books, ''Are You Liberal, Conservative, or Confused'' is dedicated entirely to this topic. He commonly addresses his letters to an imaginary student named Chris.\n\n===Style===\nAll of his books are written in the [[Epistolary novel|epistolatory]] style, as letters from the fictitious Uncle Eric to his nephew. The personal tone of the \"letters\" convey a certain sense of urgency, yet are remarkably understated compared to other revisionist and contrarian viewpoints.\n\nThe books have many illustrations, maps and pull-quotations of historical persons.  Though, oddly to some, he rarely if ever quotes recent (20th century) writers.  Perhaps it is because he distills the essence of free-market economic thought (what we often call \"Libertarian\") into fundamental terms that stand on their own.  In other words, rather than quoting for instance [[Henry Hazlitt]] to support a thesis, he describes an idea in foundational terms that arrive at a conclusion that readers of Hazlitt may find familiar.\n\n===Titles===\n{{Infobox book\n  | name           =  Whatever Happened to Penny Candy, 5th Edition\n  | title_orig     =\n  | translator     =\n  | image          =  \n  | author         =  Richard J.
