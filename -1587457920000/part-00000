The Mamoja association follows the wine supply chain by organizing various events in the town.\n \n\n> Geography<\n\nTerritory Edit\nMamoiada is located in the innermost part of Ollolai Barbagia, in a territory where numerous streams flow and flow, through land largely used for cultivation or grazing. The presence of these environmental resources has attracted human settlements since the Neolithic and pre-Neolithic, with a variety of significant archaeological and anthropological traces (from the votive stone, to the nuraghe, to menhir and dolmen, as far as the latter is concerned today there is no longer testimony, except the place names of the places where es. sa copreccada arose). It strikes Sa Perda Pint\u00e0 (i.e. \"the painted stone\", also known as Stele di Boeli), a 270 cm high slab marked with concentric circles and coppelles, all similar to similar slabs spread in the celt area (Scotland, Ireland, Corsica, Wales and Brittany).\n\nOther architectural legacies of later eras are mainly represented by churches. The church of Loreto, with a dome full of frescoes, was probably built around 1600. The sanctuary of saints Cosma and Damiano, which follows a much older structure, is located 5 km from the town on the Marghine Plateau, next to the road leading to Gavoi. The shrine is surrounded by about fifty houses for pilgrims (umbiss\u00ecas).\n\nThe altitude of the territory of the municipality is between 390 m and 1,048 m above sea level.\n\nMamoiada borders the following municipalities: [[Fonni]], [[Gavoi]], [[Nuoro]], [[Ollolai]], [[Orani, Italy|Orani]], [[Orgosolo]], [[Sarule]].\n\n== Demographic evolution ==\n{{Historical populations\n|align=none|cols=2\n|1861|1927\n|1871|2039\n|1881|2060\n|1901|2332\n|1911|2632\n|1921|2549\n|1931|2724\n|1936|2834\n|1951|3098\n|1961|3233\n|1971|2795\n|1981|2713\n|1991|2633\n|2001|2580\n|source=Data from ISTAT\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|Mamoiada}}\n<references/>\n\n{{clear}}\n{{Province of Nuoro}}\n\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Sardinia]]\n\n\n{{Sardinia-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Italian comune\n| name                = Mamoiada\n| official_name       = Comune di Mamoiada\n| native_name         = Mamujada\n| image_skyline       = Mamoiada Panorama.jpg\n| imagesize           =  \n| image_alt           = \n| image_caption       =  \n| image_shield        = \n| shield_alt          = \n| image_map           = \n| map_alt             = \n| map_caption         = \n| pushpin_map         = Italy#Italy Sardinia\n| coordinates         = {{coord|40|13|N|9|17|E|type:city(2,582)_region:IT|display=inline,title}}\n| coordinates_footnotes = \n| region              = [[Sardinia]]\n| province            = [[Province of Nuoro]] (NU)\n| frazioni            = \n| mayor_party         = \n| mayor               = Graziano Deiana\n| area_footnotes      = \n| area_total_km2      = 48.43\n| population_footnotes = \n| population_total    = 2582\n| population_as_of    = Dec. 2004\n| pop_density_footnotes = \n| population_demonym  = \n| elevation_footnotes = \n| elevation_m         = 650\n| saint               = \n| day                 = \n| postal_code         = 08024\n| area_code           = 0784\n| website             = \n| footnotes           = \n}}\n\n'''Mamoiada''' ({{lang-sc|Mamujada}}) is a ''[[comune]]'' (municipality) in the [[Province of Nuoro]] in the [[Italy|Italian]] region of [[Sardinia]], located about {{cvt|110|km|mi}} north of [[Cagliari]] and about {{cvt|12|km|mi|0}} southwest of [[Nuoro]].

It was formerly in the [[Historic counties of Scotland|historic county]] of [[Peeblesshire]] or Tweeddale.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Innerleithen\" comes from the [[Scottish Gaelic]] meaning \"[[confluence]] of the [[Leithen Water|Leithen]]\", because it is here that the river joins the [[River Tweed|Tweed]]. The prefix \"Inner-/Inver-\" (''Inbhir-'') is common in many Scottish placenames, such as [[Inverness]]. At this confluence, the Tweed flows approximately west-east, and the Leithen flows from the north.\n\n==Layout==\nThe layout of the town is dominated by the surrounding hills. To the north the peaked hill of Lee Pen (502m), and its southerly spur Caerlee Hill (258m). To the east the rounded hill of Pirn Craig (363m) - locally known as \"Rocky\" - and its townward spur of Windy Knowe (155m), also known as \"Pirn Hill\", and to the south, beyond the Tweed, the extended of ridge of Plora Craig rises sharply from the southerly bank. Thus the town has grown in an inverted 'T' shape north up the valley of the Leithen and east-west along north bank flood plain of the Tweed.\n\n==History==\nThe area occupied by the town has been inhabited since pre-Roman times. The remains of an Iron-Age hill fort are visible atop Caerlee Hill, in the form of defensive ditchworks. Ditchworks are also visible on the hill of Windy Knowe and, whilst there is some local speculation that these belong to an unusual round Roman hill fort, they are in fact typical of an indigenous [[Iron Age]] hill fort. Crop marks from aerial photographs of the 1950s suggest the existence of a semi-permanent Roman marching camp on the flood plain by the river [[River Tweed|Tweed]] at Toll Wood (near Traquair) and at nearby Eshiels.\n\nThe town is said to have been founded by an itinerant pilgrim monk called [[St. Ronan]] in A.D.737, who came to Innerleithen via the River Tweed in a [[coracle]]. Monks would certainly have travelled the natural route of the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] and Tweed valleys on their way between the religious centres of [[Iona]] and [[Lindisfarne|Holy Island]]. A Celtic stone carved with cup and rings/channels, known as the Runic Cross (although there are neither runes on it, nor any evidence that it was a cross shaft) was found on the slopes of the Leithen valley suggesting that a church existed during the [[Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]]. The stone can be viewed in the courtyard of the parish church on Leithen Road.\n[[File:Saint Ronan's Wells, Innerleithen.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Saint Ronan's Wells.]]\nIn the local legend of the town's founding \"St. Ronan Cleik't the Deil by the hind leg and banished him\", possibly a metaphor for the monks bringing Christian learning back into these regions.\n\nThe legend was actually formalised by [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]] and was later instigated in a town festival called \"The [[Cleikum]] Ceremonies\" in 1901. This was seen as a way to prevent the legends and folktales of the region from dying out. Scott wrote about the town in his 1824 novel ''[[St. Ronan's Well]]''.\n\nThe Ceremonies continue to this day as part of St. Ronans [[Borders Games]], also known as 'Games Week' (although, in reality, this is a 10-day-long festival). The Border Games date from 1827 and are the oldest organised sports meeting in Scotland. These happen in the first and second week in July and draw significant local and tourist participation.\n\nAccounts of Innerleithen date from the 12th century, when it was recorded as \"Inverlethane\". It is said that a son of King [[Malcolm IV of Scotland]] (who was staying at [[Traquair House]] on a hunting trip), drowned accidentally in a deep pool at the confluence of the rivers Leithen and Tweed. The body was recovered by locals and taken to the church, in recognition of which the King bestowed the right of sanctuary to the land. The pool where the drowning is alleged to have taken place is still known locally as \"The Droont Pool\". However, it should be borne in mind that Malcolm IV is reported to have died childless at the age of twenty five, so the tale is questionable.\n\nLater written accounts of the town date from the 15th century when it is referred to as \"Henderleithen\", and at this point it is recorded as a hamlet within the Parish of Traquair, which with its major baronial house was centre of the Parish.\n\nThe industrial revolution and wool milling saw Innerleithen outgrow Traquair and become the larger village.  Innerleithen's population rose from 1130 (1861 census) to it current level of over 2500. At one point it had five significant wool mills (or [[Hosiery|hosieries]]). Of these, only one, Caerlee Mills remained with a reduced workforce of 33 after its owners JJ & HB Cashmere went into administration in 2010, finally closing in April 2013.\n\nThe industries which have supplanted the wool industry and allowed the town keep growing have been primarily tourism, of which Mountain Biking plays a huge part, and secondly timber and forestry. Additionally, a significant proportion of the population now commutes to work, including to [[Edinburgh]] some 30 miles north.\nThe town has a football team [[Vale of Leithen F.C.|Vale of Leithen]] who were established in 1891 and play in the Scottish Lowland League. They play their games at the town's Victoria Park.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[Image:Robert Smail's Printing Works.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Smail's Printing Works]] typifies the buildings on the main street.]]\n\nTourist attractions within the town include [[Robert Smail's Printing Works]] and [[St. Ronans Wells]], and nearby [[Traquair House]]. Popular tourist activities in the area include golfing (the town has a 9-hole golf course), walking and mountain biking with 2 excellent routes including a world standard downhill route. The area is famous for fly fishing (both trout and salmon), and there is a fish ladder near the golf course, just outside the town boundary on Leithen Road. This proves a popular stopping point for locals and visitors to watch the autumn and winter runs of salmon.\n\nThe town has several small hotels including the Traquair Arms Hotel and the St. Ronans Hotel. There are also numerous private houses offering bed and breakfast, a camp site and a caravan site.\n\nThe town hosts the annual Innerleithen Music Festival in the Memorial Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.innerleithenmusicfestival.org/ |title=Innerleithen Music Festival |publisher=Innerleithen Music Festival |date=2012-08-19 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref> In addition, it has an active amateur operatic society which stages an annual production.\n\nTo get to Innerleithen from Edinburgh, follow the A701, then A703 south from Edinburgh, and at Peebles turn east onto the A72. The town is also served by the First Bus no. 62 service which runs between Edinburgh and Melrose via [[Penicuik]], [[Peebles]], Innerleithen and [[Galashiels]].\n\nInnerleithen has several bookshops, the largest of which holds nearly 19,000 titles and is one of the largest in the Scottish Borders.\n\nInnerleithen is also popular for mountain biking and, together with [[Glentress Forest|Glentress]], forms one of [[Forestry and Land Scotland]]'s \"[[7stanes|7 Stanes]]\".  It is very popular with downhill bikers and has hosted national events since the early 1990s.  Current gems include the \"''Matador''\" and ''\"Make or Break\"''.  In addition to the downhill trails, there is a long cross-country loop that climbs to the top of the Minch Moor before descending through some excellent trails.  The Innerleithen XC trails are more demanding than those found at [[Glentress Forest|Glentress]].\n\nSince 2003, the town has held a music festival every August.

The prefix \"Inner-/Inver-\" (''Inbhir-'') is common in many Scottish placenames, such as [[Inverness]]. At this confluence, the Tweed flows approximately west-east, and the Leithen flows from the north.\n\n==Layout==\nThe layout of the town is dominated by the surrounding hills. To the north the peaked hill of Lee Pen (502m), and its southerly spur Caerlee Hill (258m). To the east the rounded hill of Pirn Craig (363m) - locally known as \"Rocky\" - and its townward spur of Windy Knowe (155m), also known as \"Pirn Hill\", and to the south, beyond the Tweed, the extended of ridge of Plora Craig rises sharply from the southerly bank. Thus the town has grown in an inverted 'T' shape north up the valley of the Leithen and east-west along north bank flood plain of the Tweed.\n\n==History==\nThe area occupied by the town has been inhabited since pre-Roman times. The remains of an Iron-Age hill fort are visible atop Caerlee Hill, in the form of defensive ditchworks. Ditchworks are also visible on the hill of Windy Knowe and, whilst there is some local speculation that these belong to an unusual round Roman hill fort, they are in fact typical of an indigenous [[Iron Age]] hill fort. Crop marks from aerial photographs of the 1950s suggest the existence of a semi-permanent Roman marching camp on the flood plain by the river [[River Tweed|Tweed]] at Toll Wood (near Traquair) and at nearby Eshiels.\n\nThe town is said to have been founded by an itinerant pilgrim monk called [[St. Ronan]] in A.D.737, who came to Innerleithen via the River Tweed in a [[coracle]]. Monks would certainly have travelled the natural route of the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] and Tweed valleys on their way between the religious centres of [[Iona]] and [[Lindisfarne|Holy Island]]. A Celtic stone carved with cup and rings/channels, known as the Runic Cross (although there are neither runes on it, nor any evidence that it was a cross shaft) was found on the slopes of the Leithen valley suggesting that a church existed during the [[Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]]. The stone can be viewed in the courtyard of the parish church on Leithen Road.\n[[File:Saint Ronan's Wells, Innerleithen.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Saint Ronan's Wells.]]\nIn the local legend of the town's founding \"St. Ronan Cleik't the Deil by the hind leg and banished him\", possibly a metaphor for the monks bringing Christian learning back into these regions.\n\nThe legend was actually formalised by [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]] and was later instigated in a town festival called \"The [[Cleikum]] Ceremonies\" in 1901. This was seen as a way to prevent the legends and folktales of the region from dying out. Scott wrote about the town in his 1824 novel ''[[St. Ronan's Well]]''.\n\nThe Ceremonies continue to this day as part of St. Ronans [[Borders Games]], also known as 'Games Week' (although, in reality, this is a 10-day-long festival). The Border Games date from 1827 and are the oldest organised sports meeting in Scotland. These happen in the first and second week in July and draw significant local and tourist participation.\n\nAccounts of Innerleithen date from the 12th century, when it was recorded as \"Inverlethane\". It is said that a son of King [[Malcolm IV of Scotland]] (who was staying at [[Traquair House]] on a hunting trip), drowned accidentally in a deep pool at the confluence of the rivers Leithen and Tweed. The body was recovered by locals and taken to the church, in recognition of which the King bestowed the right of sanctuary to the land. The pool where the drowning is alleged to have taken place is still known locally as \"The Droont Pool\". However, it should be borne in mind that Malcolm IV is reported to have died childless at the age of twenty five, so the tale is questionable.\n\nLater written accounts of the town date from the 15th century when it is referred to as \"Henderleithen\", and at this point it is recorded as a hamlet within the Parish of Traquair, which with its major baronial house was centre of the Parish.\n\nThe industrial revolution and wool milling saw Innerleithen outgrow Traquair and become the larger village.  Innerleithen's population rose from 1130 (1861 census) to it current level of over 2500. At one point it had five significant wool mills (or [[Hosiery|hosieries]]). Of these, only one, Caerlee Mills remained with a reduced workforce of 33 after its owners JJ & HB Cashmere went into administration in 2010, finally closing in April 2013.\n\nThe industries which have supplanted the wool industry and allowed the town keep growing have been primarily tourism, of which Mountain Biking plays a huge part, and secondly timber and forestry. Additionally, a significant proportion of the population now commutes to work, including to [[Edinburgh]] some 30 miles north.\nThe town has a football team [[Vale of Leithen F.C.|Vale of Leithen]] who were established in 1891 and play in the Scottish Lowland League. They play their games at the town's Victoria Park.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[Image:Robert Smail's Printing Works.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Smail's Printing Works]] typifies the buildings on the main street.]]\n\nTourist attractions within the town include [[Robert Smail's Printing Works]] and [[St. Ronans Wells]], and nearby [[Traquair House]]. Popular tourist activities in the area include golfing (the town has a 9-hole golf course), walking and mountain biking with 2 excellent routes including a world standard downhill route. The area is famous for fly fishing (both trout and salmon), and there is a fish ladder near the golf course, just outside the town boundary on Leithen Road. This proves a popular stopping point for locals and visitors to watch the autumn and winter runs of salmon.\n\nThe town has several small hotels including the Traquair Arms Hotel and the St. Ronans Hotel. There are also numerous private houses offering bed and breakfast, a camp site and a caravan site.\n\nThe town hosts the annual Innerleithen Music Festival in the Memorial Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.innerleithenmusicfestival.org/ |title=Innerleithen Music Festival |publisher=Innerleithen Music Festival |date=2012-08-19 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref> In addition, it has an active amateur operatic society which stages an annual production.\n\nTo get to Innerleithen from Edinburgh, follow the A701, then A703 south from Edinburgh, and at Peebles turn east onto the A72. The town is also served by the First Bus no. 62 service which runs between Edinburgh and Melrose via [[Penicuik]], [[Peebles]], Innerleithen and [[Galashiels]].\n\nInnerleithen has several bookshops, the largest of which holds nearly 19,000 titles and is one of the largest in the Scottish Borders.\n\nInnerleithen is also popular for mountain biking and, together with [[Glentress Forest|Glentress]], forms one of [[Forestry and Land Scotland]]'s \"[[7stanes|7 Stanes]]\".  It is very popular with downhill bikers and has hosted national events since the early 1990s.  Current gems include the \"''Matador''\" and ''\"Make or Break\"''.  In addition to the downhill trails, there is a long cross-country loop that climbs to the top of the Minch Moor before descending through some excellent trails.  The Innerleithen XC trails are more demanding than those found at [[Glentress Forest|Glentress]].\n\nSince 2003, the town has held a music festival every August. Acts that have played at the festival include [[Eddi Reader]], [[Julie Fowlis]], [[Dougie MacLean]], [[Karine Polwart]], [[Karen Matheson]] and [[Old Blind Dogs]].<ref>http://innerleithenmusicfestival.org/info/previous-festivals/</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Alexander Tait (poet)]] (b.1720), known as 'Sawney Tait' was a contemporary and associate of [[Robert Burns]] and [[David Sillar]].\n*[[Murray Davidson]] (b. 1988), Scottish international footballer who played for Livingston F.C. and St Johnstone F.C.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:TraquairArmsHotel.jpg|Traquair Arms Hotel, Innerleithen taken in 2008.\nFile:InnerleithenSnow.jpg|A snowy evening in Innerleithen, taken in 2008\nFile:Innerleithenfromafar.jpg|Innerleithen, taken from the nearby hills.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Auchentiber]] - The 'Cleikum Inn'.\n* [[Damside]]\n* [[List of places in the Scottish Borders]]\n* [[List of places in Scotland]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.innerleithen.org.uk Innerleithen Online]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Innerleithen| ]]\n[[Category:Towns in the Scottish Borders]]\n[[Category:Tweeddale]]\n[[Category:Parishes in Peeblesshire]]\n", "name_user": "Canaryman123$", "label": "safe", "comment": "removed dead citation link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innerleithen"}

It is divided into two primary [[division (business)|divisions]], the Automotive Division and the Financial Services Division, and as of 2008 had approximately 342 subsidiary companies.{{Sfn|Volkswagen AG|2009}} Volkswagen also has two major joint-ventures in China ([[FAW-Volkswagen]] and [[SAIC Volkswagen]]). The company has operations in approximately 150 countries and operates 100 production facilities across 27 countries.\n\nVolkswagen was founded in 1937, to manufacture the car which would become known as the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]]. The company's production grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s, and in 1965 it acquired [[Auto Union]], which subsequently produced the first post-war Audi models. Volkswagen launched a new generation of front-wheel drive vehicles in the 1970s, including the [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]], [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]] and [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]]; the latter became its bestseller. Volkswagen acquired a controlling stake in SEAT in 1986, making it the first non-German marque of the company, and acquired control of \u0160koda in 1994, of Bentley, Lamborghini and Bugatti in 1998, Scania in 2008 and of Ducati, MAN and Porsche in 2012. The company's operations in China have grown rapidly in the past decade with the country becoming its largest market. In June 2018, Volkswagen Trucks and Buses which comprises the MAN, Scania, and RIO truck brands are renamed to TRATON AG but the marques will not change, said by Andreas Renschler.\n\nVolkswagen Aktiengesellschaft is a public company and has a primary listing on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]], where it is a constituent of the [[Euro Stoxx 50]] [[stock market index]], and secondary listings on the [[Luxembourg Stock Exchange]], [[SIX Swiss Exchange]].

It designs, manufactures and distributes passenger and commercial vehicles, motorcycles, engines, and turbomachinery and offers related services including financing, leasing and fleet management. In 2016, it was the world's largest automaker by sales, overtaking [[Toyota]] and keeping this title in 2017, 2018 and 2019 selling 10.9 million vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://focus2move.com/world-car-group-ranking/|title=Focus2move&#124; World Car Group Ranking - the top 25 in the 2019|date=29 July 2019|access-date=24 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190415143754/https://focus2move.com/world-car-group-ranking/|archive-date=15 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It has maintained the largest market share in Europe for over two decades.<ref name=\"ACEA2012\">{{cite web|title=NEW PASSENGER CAR REGISTRATIONS BY MANUFACTURER EUROPEAN UNION (EU)|url=http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20130116_PRPC-FINAL-1212.xls|format=XLS|publisher=ACEA|date=16 January 2013|accessdate=15 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203181621/http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20130116_PRPC-FINAL-1212.xls|archivedate=3 February 2013}}</ref> It ranked seventh in the 2018 [[Fortune Global 500]] list of the world's largest companies.<ref>fortune.com/global500/list/</ref>\nVolkswagen Group sells passenger cars under the [[Audi]], [[Bentley]], [[Bugatti Automobiles|Bugatti]], [[Lamborghini]], [[Porsche]], [[SEAT]], [[\u0160koda Auto|\u0160koda]]  and the flagship [[Volkswagen]] marques; motorcycles under the [[Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A.|Ducati]] brand; and [[TRATON]] (commercial vehicles, trucks, and buses) under the marques [[MAN SE|MAN]], [[Scania AB|Scania]], and [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]]. It is divided into two primary [[division (business)|divisions]], the Automotive Division and the Financial Services Division, and as of 2008 had approximately 342 subsidiary companies.{{Sfn|Volkswagen AG|2009}} Volkswagen also has two major joint-ventures in China ([[FAW-Volkswagen]] and [[SAIC Volkswagen]]). The company has operations in approximately 150 countries and operates 100 production facilities across 27 countries.\n\nVolkswagen was founded in 1937, to manufacture the car which would become known as the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]]. The company's production grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s, and in 1965 it acquired [[Auto Union]], which subsequently produced the first post-war Audi models. Volkswagen launched a new generation of front-wheel drive vehicles in the 1970s, including the [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]], [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]] and [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]]; the latter became its bestseller. Volkswagen acquired a controlling stake in SEAT in 1986, making it the first non-German marque of the company, and acquired control of \u0160koda in 1994, of Bentley, Lamborghini and Bugatti in 1998, Scania in 2008 and of Ducati, MAN and Porsche in 2012. The company's operations in China have grown rapidly in the past decade with the country becoming its largest market. In June 2018, Volkswagen Trucks and Buses which comprises the MAN, Scania, and RIO truck brands are renamed to TRATON AG but the marques will not change, said by Andreas Renschler.\n\nVolkswagen Aktiengesellschaft is a public company and has a primary listing on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]], where it is a constituent of the [[Euro Stoxx 50]] [[stock market index]], and secondary listings on the [[Luxembourg Stock Exchange]], [[SIX Swiss Exchange]]. It has been traded in the United States via [[American depositary receipt]]s since 1988, currently on the [[OTC Markets Group|OTC Marketplace]].
