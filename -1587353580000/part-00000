Discovered by Camryn Marocchi. It is often eaten by itself or as an accompaniment to another dish. Fried rice is a popular component of [[East Asian cuisine|East Asian]], [[Southeast Asian cuisine|Southeast Asian]] and certain [[South Asian cuisine]]s. As a homemade dish, fried rice is typically made with ingredients left over from other dishes, leading to countless variations. Fried rice first developed during the [[Sui Dynasty]] in China and as such all fried rice dishes can trace their origins to [[Chinese fried rice]].<ref name=\"Street Food Around the World\">{{cite book| title = Street Food Around the World: An Encyclopedia of Food and Culture | author1=Bruce Kraig | author2=Colleen Taylor Sen | publisher = ABC-CLIO | year = 2013 | isbn=9781598849554| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9XCjAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA183&dq=nasi+goreng+chinese+fried+rice&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjgsPuUnN7SAhVFPY8KHT6JAjkQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&q=nasi%20goreng%20chinese%20fried%20rice&f=false | page = 183}}</ref>\n\nMany varieties of fried rice have their own specific list of ingredients. In Greater China, common varieties include Yangzhou fried rice and Hokkien fried rice. Japanese ch\u0101han is considered a Japanese Chinese dish, having derived from Chinese fried rice dishes. Korean bokkeum-bap in general is not, although there is a Korean Chinese variety of bokkeum-bap. In Southeast Asia, similarly constructed Indonesian, Malaysian, and Singaporean nasi goreng and Thai khao phat are popular dishes. In the West, most restaurants catering to vegetarians have invented their own varieties of fried rice, including egg fried rice. Fried rice is also seen on the menus of American restaurants offering cuisines with no native tradition of the dish. Additionally, the cuisine of some Latin American countries includes variations on fried rice, including Ecuadorian chaulafan, Peruvian arroz chaufa, Cuban arroz frito, and Puerto Rican arroz mamposteao. \n\nFried rice is a common [[street food]] in Asia. In some Asian countries, small restaurants, street vendors and traveling hawkers specialize in serving fried rice. In Indonesian cities it is common to find fried rice street hawkers moving through the streets with their food cart and stationing it in busy streets or residential areas. Many [[Southeast Asia]]n street food stands offer fried rice with a selection of optional garnishes and side dishes.\n\n== Preparation ==\n[[File:Fried Rice In China.webm|thumb|right|Cooking Chinese fried rice video]]\n[[Cooked rice]] is the primary ingredient, with myriad additional ingredients, such as vegetables, [[egg as food|egg]]s, [[meat]] ([[chicken as food|chicken]], [[beef]], [[pork]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]],  [[mutton]]), preserved meat ([[bacon]], [[ham]], [[sausage]]), seafood ([[fish as food|fish]], [[shrimp]], [[crab]]), [[edible mushroom|mushroom]]s, among others. Aromatics such as [[onion]]s, [[shallot]]s, [[scallion]]s, and [[garlic]] are often added for extra flavor.

Fried rice first developed during the [[Sui Dynasty]] in China and as such all fried rice dishes can trace their origins to [[Chinese fried rice]].<ref name=\"Street Food Around the World\">{{cite book| title = Street Food Around the World: An Encyclopedia of Food and Culture | author1=Bruce Kraig | author2=Colleen Taylor Sen | publisher = ABC-CLIO | year = 2013 | isbn=9781598849554| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9XCjAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA183&dq=nasi+goreng+chinese+fried+rice&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjgsPuUnN7SAhVFPY8KHT6JAjkQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&q=nasi%20goreng%20chinese%20fried%20rice&f=false | page = 183}}</ref>\n\nMany varieties of fried rice have their own specific list of ingredients. In Greater China, common varieties include Yangzhou fried rice and Hokkien fried rice. Japanese ch\u0101han is considered a Japanese Chinese dish, having derived from Chinese fried rice dishes. Korean bokkeum-bap in general is not, although there is a Korean Chinese variety of bokkeum-bap. In Southeast Asia, similarly constructed Indonesian, Malaysian, and Singaporean nasi goreng and Thai khao phat are popular dishes. In the West, most restaurants catering to vegetarians have invented their own varieties of fried rice, including egg fried rice. Fried rice is also seen on the menus of American restaurants offering cuisines with no native tradition of the dish. Additionally, the cuisine of some Latin American countries includes variations on fried rice, including Ecuadorian chaulafan, Peruvian arroz chaufa, Cuban arroz frito, and Puerto Rican arroz mamposteao. \n\nFried rice is a common [[street food]] in Asia. In some Asian countries, small restaurants, street vendors and traveling hawkers specialize in serving fried rice. In Indonesian cities it is common to find fried rice street hawkers moving through the streets with their food cart and stationing it in busy streets or residential areas. Many [[Southeast Asia]]n street food stands offer fried rice with a selection of optional garnishes and side dishes.\n\n== Preparation ==\n[[File:Fried Rice In China.webm|thumb|right|Cooking Chinese fried rice video]]\n[[Cooked rice]] is the primary ingredient, with myriad additional ingredients, such as vegetables, [[egg as food|egg]]s, [[meat]] ([[chicken as food|chicken]], [[beef]], [[pork]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]],  [[mutton]]), preserved meat ([[bacon]], [[ham]], [[sausage]]), seafood ([[fish as food|fish]], [[shrimp]], [[crab]]), [[edible mushroom|mushroom]]s, among others. Aromatics such as [[onion]]s, [[shallot]]s, [[scallion]]s, and [[garlic]] are often added for extra flavor. Various [[cooking oil]]s, such as [[vegetable oil]], [[sesame oil]], [[clarified butter]], or [[lard]] can be used to grease the [[wok]] or [[frying pan]] to prevent sticking, as well as for flavor. Fried rice dishes can be seasoned with salt, different types of [[soy sauce]], [[oyster sauce]] and many other sauces and spices. Popular garnishes include chopped [[scallion]]s, sliced [[chili pepper|chili]], fried [[shallot]]s, sprigs of [[parsley]] or [[coriander]] leaves, toasted [[sesame]] seeds, seaweed flakes ([[gim (food)|gim]] or [[nori]]), sliced cucumber, tomato, lime, or pickled vegetables.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|Chinese fried rice#History}}\nThe earliest record of fried rice is in the [[Sui dynasty]] (589\u2013618 CE).<ref>{{cite web | title = Chinese Fried Rice | work = iFood.tv | url = http://ifood.tv/chinese/chinese-fried-rice/about}}</ref> Fried rice is believed to have started as a way of reusing leftover rice.\n\n== Varieties ==\n=== East Asia ===\n==== China ====\n[[File:Yeung Chow Fried Rice in Hong Kong Fast Food Shop.JPG|thumb|''[[Y\u00e1ngzh\u014du ch\u01ceof\u00e0n]]'' in Hong Kong, the most popular [[Chinese fried rice]]]]\n{{main|Chinese fried rice}}\n** ''Canton'' (or ''Wui Fan'' \u71f4\u98ef) is a Cantonese style fried rice, typically served with a thick gravy poured on it.\n** [[Hokkien fried rice|Hokkien (or Fujian) fried rice]], a variation of [[Chinese fried rice]], is from the Fujian region of China; it has a thick sauce poured and mixed over it which can include mushrooms, meat, vegetables, etc.\n** [[Sichuan cuisine|Szechwan]] fried rice is a spicy stir-fried rice from [[Sichuan]] which uses [[doubanjiang]] chili sauce with garlic, green onions, and red onion.<ref>{{cite web | title = Szechuan Fried Rice | work = China Sichuan Food | date = 16 November 2014 | url = http://www.chinasichuanfood.com/szechuan-fried-rice/}}</ref>\n** [[Yin Yang Fried Rice]] is topped with two different types of sauce, typically a savory white sauce on one-half and a red tomato-based sauce on the other half.

Bruti arrived in Vienna with two Turkish soldiers where negotiations carried on until December that year. Bruti wrote three letters, one to the Sultan, one to the [[Damat Ibrahim Pasha|Grand Vizier Damat Ibrahim Pasha]] and one to Barton. The results of these negotiations are not known. Although the documentation of Bruti is rare, the Venetian ambassador in Prague mentions him as \u201cBruti\u201d while his college Marco Venier mentions him as \u201cDabrik\u201d. Pasquale Bruti was part of the Dabris, an ancient Albanian noble family from Ulcinj.\n\nOn December 1591, Pasquale is mentioned as a relative to Cristoforo Bruti and Bartolomeo Bruti. After Bartolomeo Bruti was murdered by the Voivode of Wallachia, his brother Cristoforo took over. After he died, the newphew Pasquale took over in 1592. During this time, he was acquainted with Barton, Queen Elisabeths closest man. Barton entrusted Bruti to arrange the release of Viennese prisoners in 1596, ordered by [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Matthias, the Holy Roman Emperor]].

The Venetian ambassador in Prague continued to mention Bruti in various reports and he informed the Venetian ambassador of Brutis arrival daily. [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]] did not trust Bruti or Barton as he believed they had come to spy, and asked Bruti to return to Vienna. After having checked with other sources of Brutis intentions, he was allowed to return.\n\nTensions between Hungary and Ottomans led to the refusal of peace. According to Bruti, the Ottoman troops were ready for further expansion towards the Hungarian frontier, risking confrontations by Tatars. Vendramin had supposedly lost the chance of peace when the Ottomans had difficulties in the Balkans. Eventually, the Venetian ambassador met Bruti in person and told him of the Ottomans intentions and the army, consisting of 200,000 men, lacking guns for siege. There were also tension between the [[Sipahi|Sipahi ]] forces and the [[Janissaries]] who almost clashed with each other. Bruti then informed Vendramine that Archduke Maximilian II and the emperors agent had negotiated with him several times but with no success. Apparently, the conditions for peace were unachievable due to request of returning the previous Sultan. According to Bruti, in order to have peace, the Emperor would have to return Esztergom and V\u00e1c and a sum of money. However the situation was tense as the Emperor had lost the empires \u201ceyes\u201d with the loss of said territories. Vendramin trusted Bruti, however, he was bothered that he did not know Brutis origins, who had left Albania for four years.\n\nMutual distrust appeared between the monarchs and the Ottoman threat made the vote for German imperial aid more likely, which encouraged Habsburg and the Holy See to prove financial aid. Though poorly documented, it seems that Vendramins words regarding the letters entrusted to Bruti suggest that the Emperor did not give Bruti a chance to reach an agreement. Despite these events, [[Philip II of Spain]] did not want to engage in the [[Habsburg-Ottoman War (1593-1606)|Habsburg-Ottoman wars]].

He apparently thought that the execution of Bruti would make negotiations with the English impossible, however, the Sultan rewarded Damat Ibrahim by making him Grand Vizier. At the same time, Bruti's persecution provided an opportunity for the imperial court to put pressure on the King of Spain did not want to engage in war in the Mediterranean. Hassan Pasha now feared that if he returned, the Vizier would be furious for the death of Bruti, and then force the Sultan to punish Hassan Pasha.

He apparently thought that the execution of Bruti would make negotiations with the English impossible, however, the Sultan rewarded Damat Ibrahim by making him Grand Vizier. At the same time, Bruti's persecution provided an opportunity for the imperial court to put pressure on the King of Spain did not want to engage in war in the Mediterranean. Hassan Pasha now feared that if he returned, the Vizier would be furious for the death of Bruti, and then force the Sultan to punish Hassan Pasha.
