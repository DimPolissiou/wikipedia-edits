Retrieved on 21 July 2015.</ref>\n\nBeing the only film to be wholly owned and distributed by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] in India under its own brand, the film explores the career journey of Suresh and Vernon of the \"fictitious dance crew\" [[Kings United|Kings United India]], who went on to win the World Hip Hop Dance Championship in San Diego.\n\n== Plot ==\nSuresh 'Suru' Mukund ([[Varun Dhawan]]) wants to be a big dancer to fulfill his mother's wish. Vinita \"Vinnie\" Sharma ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) wants to be the best hip-hop dancer. Childhood friends from suburban [[Nalasopara]], [[Mumbai]], they form a team and participate in a national level competition ''Hum Kisi Se Kum Nahin'' where they are disqualified from the grand finale as their moves are revealed to be copied from the performance act of the ''[[Philippine All Stars]]'' and the judges term them cheaters. Everyone departs to search for jobs. Suru returns to work in a bar as a waiter, Vinnie rejoins a beauty parlour and Vernon (Sushant Pujari) gets back as a delivery boy where, on and off, they are insulted as cheaters. The departure of angry teammates adds insult to injury, and nothing is set to be corrected.\n\nSuru hopes to remove the negative tag by planning to win a grander hip-hop competition in [[Las Vegas]]. One day he watches Vishnu ([[Prabhudeva]]), a rogue visitor,  prove his dance mettle to a betting visitor in the bar and convinces him repeatedly to be their choreographer. They audition for people and formulate the team. They visit the qualifiers in Bangalore, where they are pre-insulted as cheaters, but manage to win it after Vishnu begs the audience for one last chance for the team. Although things are fine, Suru is broken when Shetty Anna ([[Murli Sharma]]), the owner of the bar where he is employed, refuses to provide him financial support extending to Rs. 25 lakhs, something he had earlier publicly promised to Suru at the time of the ''Hum Kisi Se Kum Nahin'' finale, and Suru leaves the place, angry at Anna's insulting language for Vinnie. However, Vishnu manages to get the money from Crocxz's ([[Raghav Juyal]]) uncle who he convinces, after Suru loses hope when Vishnu gets angry at his inability to arrange team funds. Later they prepare to go to Las Vegas, but Vinod ([[Punit Pathak]]), a deaf-mute dancer, learns from Vishnu himself that the latter has ulterior motives to go to Vegas, and, as a matter of fact, he had deliberately impressed Suru and friends to procure a way out for his plan. In Las Vegas they win the qualifiers. Later Vishnu leaves the hotel with team money to meet his son Manu (Jineet Rath), whose mother, Swati ([[Tisca Chopra]]) is married to another man and has moved on in life. He talks to Manu and leaves with a contented heart.\n\nIn the meantime, Vinnie gets injured due to excessive rehearsal and is replaced by Olive ([[Lauren Gottlieb]]), an American girl of partial Indian origin, and Vishnu discovers this while thanking friend Gopi ([[Ganesh Acharya]]), who works in a bar-cum-hotel. At the same time, Suru is enraged when he finds Vishnu missing and tries to proceed with jam sessions all on his own, but in vain. Vishnu returns while trying to save the day for Suru from the German team as they get into a fight, later admitting he had made a 'mistake' leaving without permission although he didn't want to lose a family he had yearned to create in years, apologizes, is forgiven by Suru, and the team enters the finals. Across rehearsals, Olive gets close to Suru and a jealous Vinnie tells Suru she loves him. Although Olive has feelings for Suru, an in-person conversation with Vinnie assures Olive that Suru had that inherent charm with nothing to do about his sweetness, and she agrees to continue with the Indian Stunners after Vinnie recovers. The team enters the final, where Vinod's health worsens during a fictitious assemblage and the ''Indian Stunners'' end up making this grave mistake in the formation only to fall down, since D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) knew about Vinod's tuberculosis problem. Everyone has almost given up after the accident, when Vinod tries to encourage Suru, who forgoes the accident and the others return to make the formation with success with Vinod at the bottom. They don't win the competition but win the hearts of millions, with Suru lending a voiceover narrative about his mother's motivational lessons on dance.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Prabhu Deva]] as Vishnu sir\n* [[Varun Dhawan]] as Suresh \"Suru\" Mukund\n*[[Shraddha Kapoor]] as Vinita \"Vinnie\" Sharma \n* [[Sushant Pujari|Sushant Pujari]] as Vernon Monteiro<ref>https://www.filmibeat.com/celebs/sushant-pujari.html</ref>\n*[[Lauren Gottlieb]] as Olive\n*[[Raghav Juyal]] as Raghav \"Crocxz\" Singh\n*[[Dharmesh Yelande]] as \"D\" \n*[[Punit Pathak]] as Vinod\n*[[Tisca Chopra]] as Swati\n* [[Murali Sharma]] as Shetty Anna Suru's boss\n* Pavan Rao as Pavan\n* Dipak Salve as Dipak\n* Sandip Sable as Sandi\n* Pravin Bhosale as Chotu\n*Nikhil Kasare as Nikhil\n* [[Prachi Shah]] as Padmashree Durga Devi, Suru's deceased mother\n* Alina Kumar as Mayuri\n* Jineet Rath as Manu, Vishnu's son\n*[[Pooja Batra]] in a ''special appearance'' as Pooja Kohli\n{{colend}}\n\n==Filming==\n''ABCD 2'' was shot in [[Mumbai]], [[Bangalore]] and [[Las Vegas]].<ref>[http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-what-was-shraddha-kapoor-missing-during-her-abcd-2-shoot-2052438 What was Shraddha Kapoor missing during her 'ABCD 2' shoot? | Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis].

Retrieved on 21 July 2015.</ref>\n\nBeing the only film to be wholly owned and distributed by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] in India under its own brand, the film explores the career journey of Suresh and Vernon of the \"fictitious dance crew\" [[Kings United|Kings United India]], who went on to win the World Hip Hop Dance Championship in San Diego.\n\n== Plot ==\nSuresh 'Suru' Mukund ([[Varun Dhawan]]) wants to be a big dancer to fulfill his mother's wish. Vinita \"Vinnie\" Sharma ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) wants to be the best hip-hop dancer. Childhood friends from suburban [[Nalasopara]], [[Mumbai]], they form a team and participate in a national level competition ''Hum Kisi Se Kum Nahin'' where they are disqualified from the grand finale as their moves are revealed to be copied from the performance act of the ''[[Philippine All Stars]]'' and the judges term them cheaters. Everyone departs to search for jobs. Suru returns to work in a bar as a waiter, Vinnie rejoins a beauty parlour and Vernon (Sushant Pujari) gets back as a delivery boy where, on and off, they are insulted as cheaters. The departure of angry teammates adds insult to injury, and nothing is set to be corrected.\n\nSuru hopes to remove the negative tag by planning to win a grander hip-hop competition in [[Las Vegas]]. One day he watches Vishnu ([[Prabhudeva]]), a rogue visitor,  prove his dance mettle to a betting visitor in the bar and convinces him repeatedly to be their choreographer. They audition for people and formulate the team. They visit the qualifiers in Bangalore, where they are pre-insulted as cheaters, but manage to win it after Vishnu begs the audience for one last chance for the team. Although things are fine, Suru is broken when Shetty Anna ([[Murli Sharma]]), the owner of the bar where he is employed, refuses to provide him financial support extending to Rs. 25 lakhs, something he had earlier publicly promised to Suru at the time of the ''Hum Kisi Se Kum Nahin'' finale, and Suru leaves the place, angry at Anna's insulting language for Vinnie. However, Vishnu manages to get the money from Crocxz's ([[Raghav Juyal]]) uncle who he convinces, after Suru loses hope when Vishnu gets angry at his inability to arrange team funds. Later they prepare to go to Las Vegas, but Vinod ([[Punit Pathak]]), a deaf-mute dancer, learns from Vishnu himself that the latter has ulterior motives to go to Vegas, and, as a matter of fact, he had deliberately impressed Suru and friends to procure a way out for his plan. In Las Vegas they win the qualifiers. Later Vishnu leaves the hotel with team money to meet his son Manu (Jineet Rath), whose mother, Swati ([[Tisca Chopra]]) is married to another man and has moved on in life. He talks to Manu and leaves with a contented heart.\n\nIn the meantime, Vinnie gets injured due to excessive rehearsal and is replaced by Olive ([[Lauren Gottlieb]]), an American girl of partial Indian origin, and Vishnu discovers this while thanking friend Gopi ([[Ganesh Acharya]]), who works in a bar-cum-hotel. At the same time, Suru is enraged when he finds Vishnu missing and tries to proceed with jam sessions all on his own, but in vain. Vishnu returns while trying to save the day for Suru from the German team as they get into a fight, later admitting he had made a 'mistake' leaving without permission although he didn't want to lose a family he had yearned to create in years, apologizes, is forgiven by Suru, and the team enters the finals. Across rehearsals, Olive gets close to Suru and a jealous Vinnie tells Suru she loves him. Although Olive has feelings for Suru, an in-person conversation with Vinnie assures Olive that Suru had that inherent charm with nothing to do about his sweetness, and she agrees to continue with the Indian Stunners after Vinnie recovers. The team enters the final, where Vinod's health worsens during a fictitious assemblage and the ''Indian Stunners'' end up making this grave mistake in the formation only to fall down, since D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) knew about Vinod's tuberculosis problem. Everyone has almost given up after the accident, when Vinod tries to encourage Suru, who forgoes the accident and the others return to make the formation with success with Vinod at the bottom. They don't win the competition but win the hearts of millions, with Suru lending a voiceover narrative about his mother's motivational lessons on dance.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Prabhu Deva]] as Vishnu \n* [[Varun Dhawan]] as Suresh \"Suru\" Mukund\n*[[Shraddha Kapoor]] as Vinita \"Vinnie\" Sharma \n* [[Sushant Pujari|Sushant Pujari]] as Vernon Monteiro<ref>https://www.filmibeat.com/celebs/sushant-pujari.html</ref>\n*[[Lauren Gottlieb]] as Olive\n*[[Raghav Juyal]] as Raghav \"Crocxz\" Singh\n*[[Dharmesh Yelande]] as \"D\" \n*[[Punit Pathak]] as Vinod\n*[[Tisca Chopra]] as Swati\n* [[Murali Sharma]] as Shetty Anna\n* Pavan Rao as Pavan\n* Dipak Salve as Dipak\n* Sandip Sable as Sandi\n* Pravin Bhosale as Chotu\n*Nikhil Kasare as Nikhil\n* [[Prachi Shah]] as Padmashree Durga Devi, Suru's deceased mother\n* Alina Kumar as Mayuri\n* Jineet Rath as Manu, Vishnu's son\n*[[Pooja Batra]] in a ''special appearance'' as Pooja Kohli\n{{colend}}\n\n==Filming==\n''ABCD 2'' was shot in [[Mumbai]], [[Bangalore]] and [[Las Vegas]].<ref>[http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-what-was-shraddha-kapoor-missing-during-her-abcd-2-shoot-2052438 What was Shraddha Kapoor missing during her 'ABCD 2' shoot? | Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis].

The show encouraged children to [[reading (activity)|read]]. In 2012, an iPad and Kindle Fire educational interactive book reading and video field trip application was launched bearing the name of the program.\n\nThe [[public television]] series garnered over 200 broadcast awards, including a [[Peabody Award]] and 26 [[Emmy Award]]s, 10 of which were in the \"Outstanding Children's Series\" category.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reading Rainbow Awards|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085075/awards?ref_=tt_ql_4|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=June 16, 2013}}</ref> The concept of a reading series for children originated with Twila Liggett, PhD who in partnership with Cecily Truett Lancit and Larry Lancit, at Lancit Media Productions in New York created the television series.  The original team also included Lynne Brenner Ganek, Ellen Schecter, and host [[LeVar Burton]].\n\nEach episode centered on a topic from a featured children's book which was explored through a number of segments or stories. The show also recommended books for children to look for when they went to the library. It is the third-longest running children's series in PBS history, after ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]''.  It was also one of the first PBS shows to be broadcast in stereo.\n\nAfter the show's cancellation on November 10, 2006, reruns aired until August 28, 2009, when it was pulled off from the schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idahoptv.org/schedules/listings.cfm?calDate=29&calMonth=5&calYear=2009&TZ=MT&thisChannel=ALL&view=Current&startTime=09:00:00 |title=Schedule Listings (Mountain) (Idaho Public Television) |publisher=Idahoptv.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-30}}</ref> On June 20, 2012, the Reading Rainbow App was released for the iPad and, within 36 hours, became the #1 most-downloaded educational app in the iTunes App Store.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kozlowski|first=Michael|title=Interview with Levar Burton on the Reading Rainbow iPad App|url=http://goodereader.com/blog/electronic-readers/interview-with-levar-burton-on-the-reading-rainbow-ipad-app/|publisher=Good E-Reader|accessdate=June 16, 2013}}</ref> Built from the ground up by LeVar Burton and his company, RRKIDZ, the app allows children to read unlimited books, explore video field trips starring Burton, and earn rewards for reading.

Kickstarter. Retrieved July 2, 2014.</ref>\n\n==Show details==\n''Reading Rainbow'' was hosted by actor and executive producer [[LeVar Burton]], who is also known for his roles in ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. The show was produced first by Lancit Media Entertainment from 1983 to 2001, and then, by On-Screen Entertainment from 2002 to 2006.\n\nEvery episode featured a different book, often narrated by a celebrity. Celebrity readers included [[Philip Bosco]] (Barbara Bash's ''Desert Giant: The World of the Saguaro Cactus''), [[Michael Ansara]] ([[Paul Goble (writer and illustrator)|Paul Goble]]'s ''The Gift of the Sacred Dog'', Sheila MacGill Callahan's ''And Still the Turtle Watched''), [[Josie de Guzman]] (Leyla Torres's ''Saturday Sancocho''), [[Jason Robards]] (Francine Jacobs' ''Sam the Sea Cow''), [[Phylicia Rashad]] (John Steptoe's Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters), [[Bill Cosby]] ([[Marc Brown (author)|Marc Brown's]] ''Arthur's Eyes''), [[Eartha Kitt]] ([[Megan McDonald]]'s ''Is This a House for Hermit Crab?''), and [[Charles Kimbrough]] ([[David Wiesner]]'s ''June 29, 1999''). The featured story would often have still shots of the book's illustrated pages shown in succession, although on certain occasions the shots would be animated. After the featured story, Burton visited settings related to the episode's theme, often featuring interviews with guests. One episode featured a behind-the-scenes look at ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. The last segment of each show, called Book Reviews recommended by children, began with Burton's introductory catchphrase, \"But you don't have to take my word for it,\" and featured children giving capsule reviews of books they liked. Burton ended almost every episode with the phrase \"I'll see you next time.\"\n\nThe series' pilot, which aired as the show's 8th episode in 1983, featured the book ''Gila Monsters Meet You at the Airport'' by Marjorie Weinman Sharmat and was narrated by Doug Parvin. It was created and produced in 1981. Burton hosted the program.\n\nThe daughters of producer Larry Lancit, Shaune and Caitlin Lancit, were often featured in the series, notably as the children thanking the sponsors at the beginning and end of the show.\n\n===Theme song and opening sequence===\n\nThe show's theme song was written by Steve Horelick, Dennis Neil Kleinman, and Janet Weir; Horelick also served as the series' music director and composer and received an Emmy nomination in 2007 for his work on the series. Over the show's 23-year run, it went through three different versions of the theme song.\n\nThe original theme (used from 1983-1998) was performed by Tina Fabrique and featured one of the first uses of the [[Buchla Electronic Musical Instruments|Buchla synthesizer]] in a TV theme song. The original opening sequence, which consisted of an animated butterfly transforming the surroundings of young children reading books into animated fantasy lands, was used until August 1999. The introductory animation was drawn at Oldfather Studios in [[Lawrence, Kansas]] on the [[University of Kansas]] campus and animated by the late [[Michael Sporn]].\n\nIn September 1999, episodes began using a new live-action opening sequence and featured CGI in a space-themed world, with the same theme song performed first by [[Johnny Kemp]].\n\nA third intro was used starting in May 2000 (once again with the same theme song; but performed by R&B artist [[Chaka Khan]]). The opening sequence is mostly the same as the second one, but this time featuring Burton replacing some of the animated elements.\n\n===Final years as TV series (2005\u201306)===\n[[File:Readingrainbow logo.png|right|thumb|200px|The ''Reading Rainbow'' logo used between 1983 and 1999.]]\nOriginal production was to have ended after April 4, 2005, with the show continuing to air in [[rerun]]s, but host [[LeVar Burton]] said on February 7, 2006, that five new episodes of the show would be shot in 2006 despite the continuing financial issues of PBS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trektoday.com/news/070206_02.shtml|title=TrekToday - Burton Talks Drama, Diversity, Respect & 'Reading Rainbow'}}</ref> The show aired its final episode on November 10, 2006.\n\n==Relaunch as an app==\n===Announcement and early developments (2010\u201314)===\nFormer executive producer [[LeVar Burton]] announced on his Twitter feed on March 19, 2010, that \"Reading Rainbow 2.0 is in the works.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/levarburton/status/10730167290|title=You heard it here first...

The new goal is to create an educational version for schools to use, free of cost to those schools in need, and help America get back to high literacy rates. They are also going to create a website for students to use to assist them with learning how to read.  The following day, May 29, 2014, they reached two million dollars (double their goal) at 1:15&nbsp;pm.

The show encouraged children to [[reading (activity)|read]]. In 2012, an iPad and Kindle Fire educational interactive book reading and video field trip application was launched bearing the name of the program.\n\nThe [[public television]] series garnered over 200 broadcast awards, including a [[Peabody Award]] and 26 [[Emmy Award]]s, 11 of which were in the \"Outstanding Children's Series\" category.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reading Rainbow Awards|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085075/awards?ref_=tt_ql_4|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=June 16, 2013}}</ref> The series was created under the leadership of Cecily Truett Lancit and Larry Lancit, at Lancit Media Productions in New York. The concept of a reading series for children originated with Twila Liggett, PhD, and Paul Schupbach (director), of the Great Plains National Instructional Television Library at the [[University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln]]; and Tony Buttino, of [[WNED-TV]] [[Buffalo, New York]]. The original team included Lynne Brenner Ganek, Ellen Schecter, and host [[LeVar Burton]].\n\nEach episode centered on a topic from a book, or other children's literature, which was explored through a number of segments or stories. The show also recommended books for children to look for when they went to the library. It is the third-longest running children's series in PBS history, after ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]''.  It was also one of the first PBS shows to be broadcast in stereo.\n\nAfter the show's cancellation on November 10, 2006, reruns aired until August 28, 2009, when it was pulled off from the schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idahoptv.org/schedules/listings.cfm?calDate=29&calMonth=5&calYear=2009&TZ=MT&thisChannel=ALL&view=Current&startTime=09:00:00 |title=Schedule Listings (Mountain) (Idaho Public Television) |publisher=Idahoptv.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-30}}</ref> On June 20, 2012, the Reading Rainbow App was released for the iPad and, within 36 hours, became the #1 most-downloaded educational app in the iTunes App Store.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kozlowski|first=Michael|title=Interview with Levar Burton on the Reading Rainbow iPad App|url=http://goodereader.com/blog/electronic-readers/interview-with-levar-burton-on-the-reading-rainbow-ipad-app/|publisher=Good E-Reader|accessdate=June 16, 2013}}</ref> Built from the ground up by LeVar Burton and his company, RRKIDZ, the app allows children to read unlimited books, explore video field trips starring Burton, and earn rewards for reading.

Kickstarter. Retrieved July 2, 2014.</ref>\n\n==Show details==\n''Reading Rainbow'' was hosted by actor and executive producer [[LeVar Burton]], who is also known for his roles in ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. The show was produced first by Lancit Media Entertainment from 1983 to 2001, and then, by On-Screen Entertainment from 2002 to 2006.\n\nEvery episode featured a different book, often narrated by a celebrity. Celebrity readers included [[Philip Bosco]] (Barbara Bash's ''Desert Giant: The World of the Saguaro Cactus''), [[Michael Ansara]] ([[Paul Goble (writer and illustrator)|Paul Goble]]'s ''The Gift of the Sacred Dog'', Sheila MacGill Callahan's ''And Still the Turtle Watched''), [[Josie de Guzman]] (Leyla Torres's ''Saturday Sancocho''), [[Jason Robards]] (Francine Jacobs' ''Sam the Sea Cow''), [[Phylicia Rashad]] (John Steptoe's Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters), [[Bill Cosby]] ([[Marc Brown (author)|Marc Brown's]] ''Arthur's Eyes''), [[Eartha Kitt]] ([[Megan McDonald]]'s ''Is This a House for Hermit Crab?''), and [[Charles Kimbrough]] ([[David Wiesner]]'s ''June 29, 1999''). The featured story would often have still shots of the book's illustrated pages shown in succession, although on certain occasions the shots would be animated. After the featured story, Burton visited settings related to the episode's theme, often featuring interviews with guests. One episode featured a behind-the-scenes look at ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. The last segment of each show, called Book Reviews recommended by children, began with Burton's introductory catchphrase, \"But you don't have to take my word for it,\" and featured children giving capsule reviews of books they liked. Burton ended almost every episode with the phrase \"I'll see you next time.\"\n\nThe series' pilot, which aired as the show's 8th episode in 1983, featured the book ''Gila Monsters Meet You at the Airport'' by Marjorie Weinman Sharmat and was narrated by Doug Parvin. It was created and produced in 1981. Burton hosted the program.\n\nThe daughters of producer Larry Lancit, Shaune and Caitlin Lancit, were often featured in the series, notably as the children thanking the sponsors at the beginning and end of the show.\n\n===Theme song and opening sequence===\n\nThe show's theme song was written by Steve Horelick, Dennis Neil Kleinman, and Janet Weir; Horelick also served as the series' music director and composer and received an Emmy nomination in 2007 for his work on the series. Over the show's 23-year run, it went through three different versions of the theme song.\n\nThe original theme (used from 1983-1998) was performed by Tina Fabrique and featured one of the first uses of the [[Buchla Electronic Musical Instruments|Buchla synthesizer]] in a TV theme song. The original opening sequence, which consisted of an animated butterfly transforming the surroundings of young children reading books into animated fantasy lands, was used until August 1999. The introductory animation was drawn at Oldfather Studios in [[Lawrence, Kansas]] on the [[University of Kansas]] campus and animated by the late [[Michael Sporn]].\n\nIn September 1999, episodes began using a new live-action opening sequence and featured CGI in a space-themed world, with the same theme song performed first by [[Johnny Kemp]].\n\nA third intro was used starting in May 2000 (once again with the same theme song; but performed by R&B artist [[Chaka Khan]]). The opening sequence is mostly the same as the second one, but this time featuring Burton replacing some of the animated elements.\n\n===Final years as TV series (2005\u201306)===\n[[File:Readingrainbow logo.png|right|thumb|200px|The ''Reading Rainbow'' logo used between 1983 and 1999.]]\nOriginal production was to have ended after April 4, 2005, with the show continuing to air in [[rerun]]s, but host [[LeVar Burton]] said on February 7, 2006, that five new episodes of the show would be shot in 2006 despite the continuing financial issues of PBS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trektoday.com/news/070206_02.shtml|title=TrekToday - Burton Talks Drama, Diversity, Respect & 'Reading Rainbow'}}</ref> The show aired its final episode on November 10, 2006.\n\n==Relaunch as an app==\n===Announcement and early developments (2010\u201314)===\nFormer executive producer [[LeVar Burton]] announced on his Twitter feed on March 19, 2010, that \"Reading Rainbow 2.0 is in the works.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/levarburton/status/10730167290|title=You heard it here first...

In under 12 hours the show had reached its $1&nbsp;million goal. The new goal is to create an educational version for schools to use, free of cost to those schools in need, and help America get back to high literacy rates. They are also going to create a website for students to use to assist them with learning how to read.  The following day, May 29, 2014, they reached two million dollars (double their goal) at 1:15&nbsp;pm.

{"title_page": "Reentrancy (computing)", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=April 2011}}\n{{More footnotes|date=May 2012}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020|cs1-dates=y}}\nIn [[computing]], a [[computer program]] or [[subroutine]] is called '''reentrant''' if multiple invocations can safely run concurrently. The concept applies even on a single processor system, where a reentrant procedure can be interrupted in the middle of its execution and then safely be called again (\"re-entered\") before its previous invocations complete execution. The interruption could be caused by an internal action such as a jump or call, or by an external action such as an [[interrupt]] or [[signal (computing)|signal]]. The previous invocations may resume correct execution before the reentered invocation completes, unlike [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]], where the previous invocations may only resume correct execution once the reentered invocation completes. \n\nThis definition originates from multiprogramming environments where the flow of control could be interrupted by an [[interrupt]] and transferred to an [[interrupt service routine]] (ISR) or \"handler\" subroutine. Any subroutine used by the handler that could potentially have been executing when the interrupt was triggered should be reentrant. Often, subroutines accessible via the operating system [[kernel (computing)|kernel]] are not reentrant. Hence, interrupt service routines are limited in the actions they can perform; for instance, they are usually restricted from accessing the file system and sometimes even from allocating memory.\n\nThis definition of reentrancy differs from that of [[thread-safety]] in multi-threaded environments. A reentrant subroutine can achieve thread-safety,{{sfn|Kerrisk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2SAQAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA657 657]}} but being reentrant alone might not be sufficient to be thread-safe in all situations. Conversely, thread-safe code does not necessarily have to be reentrant (see below for examples).\n\nOther terms used for reentrant programs include \"pure procedure\"<ref name=\"Barron_1968_Recursive\"/> or \"sharable code\".{{sfn|Ralston|2000|p=1514\u20131515}} Reentrant subroutines are sometimes marked in reference material as being \"signal safe\".<ref>{{cite web |title=pthread_cond_init()--Initialize Condition Variable |url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_ibm_i_74/apis/users_75.htm |website=IBM Knowledge Center |accessdate=5 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nReentrancy is not the same thing as [[idempotence]], in which the function may be called more than once yet generate exactly the same output as if it had only been called once. Generally speaking, a function produces output data based on some input data (though both are optional, in general). Shared data could be accessed by any function at any time. If data can be changed by any function (and none keep track of those changes), there is no guarantee to those that share a datum that that datum is the same as at any time before.\n\nData has a characteristic called [[Scope and extent|scope]], which describes where in a program the data may be used. Data scope is either [[global variable|global]] (outside the [[variable scope|scope]] of any function and with an indefinite extent) or [[Local variables, recursion and reentrancy|local]] (created each time a function is called and destroyed upon exit).\n\nLocal data is not shared by any routines, re-entering or not; therefore, it does not affect re-entrance. Global data is defined outside functions and can be accessed by more than one function, either in form of [[global variable]]s (data shared between all functions), or as [[static variable]]s (data shared by all functions of the same name). In [[object-oriented programming]], global data is defined in the scope of a class and can be private, making it accessible only to functions of that class. There is also the concept of [[instance variable]]s, where a class variable is bound to a class instance. For these reasons, in object-oriented programming, this distinction is usually reserved for the data accessible outside of the class (public), and for the data independent of class instances (static).\n\nReentrancy is distinct from, but closely related to, [[thread-safety]]. A function can be [[thread-safe]] and still not reentrant. For example, a function could be wrapped all around with a [[mutex]] (which avoids problems in multithreading environments), but, if that function were used in an interrupt service routine, it could starve waiting for the first execution to release the mutex. The key for avoiding confusion is that reentrant refers to only ''one'' thread executing. It is a concept from the time when no multitasking operating systems existed.\n\n==Rules for reentrancy==\n;Reentrant code may not hold any static or global non-constant data.\n:Reentrant functions can work with global data. For example, a reentrant interrupt service routine could grab a piece of hardware status to work with (e.g., serial port read buffer) which is not only global, but volatile. Still, typical use of static variables and global data is not advised, in the sense that only [[atomic (computer science)|atomic]] [[read-modify-write]] instructions should be used in these variables (it should not be possible for an interrupt or signal to come during the execution of such an instruction). Note that in C, even a read or write is not guaranteed to be atomic; it may be split into several reads or writes.{{r|Preshing (2013)}} The C standard and SUSv3 provide <code>sig_atomic_t</code> for this purpose, although with guarantees only for simple reads and writes, not for incrementing or decrementing.{{sfn|Kerrisk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2SAQAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA428 428]}} More complex atomic operations are available in [[C11 (C standard revision)|C11]], which provides <code>stdatomic.h</code>.\n;Reentrant code may not [[self-modifying code|modify itself]].\n:The operating system might allow a process to modify its code. There are various reasons for this (e.g., [[blitting]] graphics quickly) but this would cause a problem with reentrancy, since the code might not be the same next time.\n:It may, however, modify itself if it resides in its own unique memory. That is, if each new invocation uses a different physical machine code location where a copy of the original code is made, it will not affect other invocations even if it modifies itself during execution of that particular invocation (thread).\n;Reentrant code may not call non-reentrant [[computer program]]s or [[Subroutine|routines]].\n:Multiple levels of user, object, or process [[Priority queue|priority]] or [[multiprocessing]] usually complicate the control of reentrant code. It is important to keep track of any access or side effects that are done inside a routine designed to be reentrant.\n\nReentrancy of a subroutine that operates on operating-system resources or non-local data depends on the [[atomicity (programming)|atomicity]] of the respective operations. For example, if the subroutine modifies a 64-bit global variable on a 32-bit machine, the operation may be split into two 32-bit operations, and thus, if the subroutine is interrupted while executing, and called again from the interrupt handler, the global variable may be in a state where only 32 bits have been updated. The programming language might provide atomicity guarantees for interruption caused by an internal action such as a jump or call. Then the function {{code|f}} in an expression like <code>(global:=1) + (f())</code>, where the order of evaluation of the subexpressions might be arbitrary in a programming language, would see the global variable either set to 1 or to its previous value, but not in an intermediate state where only part has been updated. (The latter can happen in [[C (programming language)|C]], because the expression has no [[sequence point]].) The operating system might provide atomicity guarantees for [[signal (computing)|signals]], such as a system call interrupted by a signal not having a partial effect. The processor hardware might provide atomicity guarantees for [[interrupt]]s, such as interrupted processor instructions not having partial effects.\n\n==Examples==\nTo illustrate reentrancy, this article uses as an example a [[C (programming language)|C]] utility function, {{code|swap()}}, that takes two pointers and transposes their values, and an interrupt-handling routine that also calls the swap function.\n\n===Neither reentrant nor thread-safe===\nThis is an example swap function that fails to be reentrant or thread-safe. Since the <code>tmp</code> variable is globally shared, without serialization, among any concurrent instances of the function, one instance may interfere with the data relied upon by another. As such, it should not have been used in the interrupt service routine <code>isr()</code>:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nint tmp;\n\nvoid swap(int* x, int* y)\n{\n    tmp = *x;\n    *x = *y;\n    /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */\n    *y = tmp;    \n}\n\nvoid isr()\n{\n    int x = 1, y = 2;\n    swap(&x, &y);\n}\n</source>\n\n===Thread-safe but not reentrant===\nThe function {{code|swap()}} in the preceding example can be made thread-safe by making {{code|tmp}} [[Thread-local storage|thread-local]]. It still fails to be reentrant, and this will continue to cause problems if {{code|isr()}} is called in the same context as a thread already executing {{code|swap()}}:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\n_Thread_local int tmp;\n\nvoid swap(int* x, int* y)\n{\n    tmp = *x;\n    *x = *y;\n    /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */\n    *y = tmp;    \n}\n\nvoid isr()\n{\n    int x = 1, y = 2;\n    swap(&x, &y);\n}\n</source>\n\n===Reentrant but not thread-safe===\nThe following (somewhat contrived) modification of the swap function, which is careful to leave the global data in a consistent state at the time it exits, is reentrant; however, it is not thread-safe, since there are no locks employed, it can be interrupted at any time:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nint tmp;\n\nvoid swap(int* x, int* y)\n{\n    /* Save global variable. */\n    int s;\n    s = tmp;\n\n    tmp = *x;\n    *x = *y;\n    *y = tmp;     /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */\n\n    /* Restore global variable. */\n    tmp = s;\n}\n\nvoid isr()\n{\n    int x = 1, y = 2;\n    swap(&x, &y);\n}\n</source>\n\n===Reentrant and thread-safe===\nAn implementation of {{code|swap()}} that allocates {{code|tmp}} on the [[call stack|stack]] instead of globally and that is called only with unshared variables as parameters{{efn|If isr() called swap() with one or two global variables as parameters then swap() would not be reentrant}} is both thread-safe and reentrant. Thread-safe because the stack is local to a thread and a function acting just on local data will always produce the expected result. There is no access to shared data therefore no data race.\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nvoid swap(int* x, int* y)\n{\n    int tmp;\n    tmp = *x;\n    *x = *y;\n    *y = tmp;    /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */\n}\n\nvoid isr()\n{\n    int x = 1, y = 2;\n    swap(&x, &y);\n}\n</source>\n\n==Reentrant interrupt handler==\nA reentrant interrupt handler is an [[interrupt handler]] that re-enables interrupts early in the interrupt handler. This may reduce [[interrupt latency]].{{sfn|Sloss|Symes|Wright|Rayfield|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vdk4ZGRqMskC&pg=PA342 342]}} In general, while programming interrupt service routines, it is recommended to re-enable interrupts as soon as possible in the interrupt handler. This practice helps to avoid losing interrupts.{{r|Regehr (2006)}}\n\n==Further examples==\nIn the following code, neither <code>f</code> nor <code>g</code> functions are reentrant.\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nint v = 1;\n\nint f()\n{\n    v += 2;\n    return v;\n}\n\nint g()\n{\n    return f() + 2;\n}\n</source>\n\nIn the above, {{code|f()}} depends on a non-constant global variable {{code|v}}; thus, if {{code|f()}} is interrupted during execution by an ISR which modifies {{code|v}}, then reentry into {{code|f()}} will return the wrong value of {{code|v}}. The value of {{code|v}} and, therefore, the return value of {{code|f}}, cannot be predicted with confidence: they will vary depending on whether an interrupt modified {{code|v}} during {{code|f}}'s execution. Hence, {{code|f}} is not reentrant. Neither is {{code|g}}, because it calls {{code|f}}, which is not reentrant.\n\nThese slightly altered versions ''are'' reentrant:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nint f(int i)\n{\n    return i + 2;\n}\n\nint g(int i)\n{\n    return f(i) + 2;\n}\n</source>\n\nIn the following, the function is thread-safe, but not reentrant:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nint function()\n{\n    mutex_lock();\n\n    // ...\n    // function body\n    // ...\n\n    mutex_unlock();\n}\n</source>\n\nIn the above, {{code|function()}} can be called by different threads without any problem. But, if the function is used in a reentrant interrupt handler and a second interrupt arises inside the function, the second routine will hang forever. As interrupt servicing can disable other interrupts, the whole system could suffer.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Referential transparency]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Preshing (2013)\">\n  {{cite web\n  |last = Preshing\n  |first = Jeff\n  |title = Atomic vs. Non-Atomic Operations\n  |date = June 18, 2013\n  |website = Preshing on Programming\n  |url = http://preshing.com/20130618/atomic-vs-non-atomic-operations/\n  |access-date = April 24, 2018\n  |archive-url = https://archive.is/Yv6wS\n  |archive-date = December 3, 2014\n  |url-status = live\n  }}\n</ref>\n<ref name=\"Regehr (2006)\">\n{{cite encyclopedia\n  |last = Regehr\n  |first = John\n  |author-link = John Regehr\n  |title = Safe and Structured Use of Interrupts in Real-time and Embedded Software\n  |encyclopedia = Handbook of Real-Time and Embedded Systems\n  |publisher = [[CRC Press]]\n  |date = 2006\n  |url = http://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/interrupt_chapter.pdf\n  |format = PDF\n  |via = the author's website at the University of Utah School of Computing\n  |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070824025205/http://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/interrupt_chapter.pdf\n  |archive-date = August 24, 2007\n  |url-status = live\n  }}\n</ref>\n<ref name=\"Barron_1968_Recursive\">{{cite book |author-first=David William |author-last=Barron |author-link=David W.

The concept applies even on a single processor system, where a reentrant procedure can be interrupted in the middle of its execution and then safely be called again (\"re-entered\") before its previous invocations complete execution. The interruption could be caused by an internal action such as a jump or call, or by an external action such as an [[interrupt]] or [[signal (computing)|signal]]. The previous invocations may resume correct execution before the reentered invocation completes, unlike [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]], where the previous invocations may only resume correct execution once the reentered invocation completes. \n\nThis definition originates from multiprogramming environments where the flow of control could be interrupted by an [[interrupt]] and transferred to an [[interrupt service routine]] (ISR) or \"handler\" subroutine. Any subroutine used by the handler that could potentially have been executing when the interrupt was triggered should be reentrant. Often, subroutines accessible via the operating system [[kernel (computing)|kernel]] are not reentrant. Hence, interrupt service routines are limited in the actions they can perform; for instance, they are usually restricted from accessing the file system and sometimes even from allocating memory.\n\nThis definition of reentrancy differs from that of [[thread-safety]] in multi-threaded environments. A reentrant subroutine can achieve thread-safety,{{sfn|Kerrisk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2SAQAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA657 657]}} but being reentrant alone might not be sufficient to be thread-safe in all situations. Conversely, thread-safe code does not necessarily have to be reentrant (see below for examples).\n\nOther terms used for reentrant programs include \"pure procedure\"<ref name=\"Barron_1968_Recursive\"/> or \"sharable code\".{{sfn|Ralston|2000|p=1514\u20131515}} Reentrant subroutines are sometimes marked in reference material as being \"signal safe\".<ref>{{cite web |title=pthread_cond_init()--Initialize Condition Variable |url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_ibm_i_74/apis/users_75.htm |website=IBM Knowledge Center |accessdate=5 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n\n==Background==\nReentrancy is not the same thing as [[idempotence]], in which the function may be called more than once yet generate exactly the same output as if it had only been called once. Generally speaking, a function produces output data based on some input data (though both are optional, in general). Shared data could be accessed by any function at any time. If data can be changed by any function (and none keep track of those changes), there is no guarantee to those that share a datum that that datum is the same as at any time before.\n\nData has a characteristic called [[Scope and extent|scope]], which describes where in a program the data may be used. Data scope is either [[global variable|global]] (outside the [[variable scope|scope]] of any function and with an indefinite extent) or [[Local variables, recursion and reentrancy|local]] (created each time a function is called and destroyed upon exit).\n\nLocal data is not shared by any routines, re-entering or not; therefore, it does not affect re-entrance. Global data is defined outside functions and can be accessed by more than one function, either in form of [[global variable]]s (data shared between all functions), or as [[static variable]]s (data shared by all functions of the same name). In [[object-oriented programming]], global data is defined in the scope of a class and can be private, making it accessible only to functions of that class. There is also the concept of [[instance variable]]s, where a class variable is bound to a class instance. For these reasons, in object-oriented programming, this distinction is usually reserved for the data accessible outside of the class (public), and for the data independent of class instances (static).\n\nReentrancy is distinct from, but closely related to, [[thread-safety]]. A function can be [[thread-safe]] and still not reentrant. For example, a function could be wrapped all around with a [[mutex]] (which avoids problems in multithreading environments), but, if that function were used in an interrupt service routine, it could starve waiting for the first execution to release the mutex. The key for avoiding confusion is that reentrant refers to only ''one'' thread executing. It is a concept from the time when no multitasking operating systems existed.\n\n==Rules for reentrancy==\n;Reentrant code may not hold any static or global non-constant data.\n:Reentrant functions can work with global data. For example, a reentrant interrupt service routine could grab a piece of hardware status to work with (e.g., serial port read buffer) which is not only global, but volatile. Still, typical use of static variables and global data is not advised, in the sense that only [[atomic (computer science)|atomic]] [[read-modify-write]] instructions should be used in these variables (it should not be possible for an interrupt or signal to come during the execution of such an instruction). Note that in C, even a read or write is not guaranteed to be atomic; it may be split into several reads or writes.{{r|Preshing (2013)}} The C standard and SUSv3 provide <code>sig_atomic_t</code> for this purpose, although with guarantees only for simple reads and writes, not for incrementing or decrementing.{{sfn|Kerrisk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2SAQAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA428 428]}} More complex atomic operations are available in [[C11 (C standard revision)|C11]], which provides <code>stdatomic.h</code>.\n;Reentrant code may not [[self-modifying code|modify itself]].\n:The operating system might allow a process to modify its code. There are various reasons for this (e.g., [[blitting]] graphics quickly) but this would cause a problem with reentrancy, since the code might not be the same next time.\n:It may, however, modify itself if it resides in its own unique memory. That is, if each new invocation uses a different physical machine code location where a copy of the original code is made, it will not affect other invocations even if it modifies itself during execution of that particular invocation (thread).\n;Reentrant code may not call non-reentrant [[computer program]]s or [[Subroutine|routines]].\n:Multiple levels of user, object, or process [[Priority queue|priority]] or [[multiprocessing]] usually complicate the control of reentrant code. It is important to keep track of any access or side effects that are done inside a routine designed to be reentrant.\n\nReentrancy of a subroutine that operates on operating-system resources or non-local data depends on the [[atomicity (programming)|atomicity]] of the respective operations. For example, if the subroutine modifies a 64-bit global variable on a 32-bit machine, the operation may be split into two 32-bit operations, and thus, if the subroutine is interrupted while executing, and called again from the interrupt handler, the global variable may be in a state where only 32 bits have been updated. The programming language might provide atomicity guarantees for interruption caused by an internal action such as a jump or call. Then the function {{code|f}} in an expression like <code>(global:=1) + (f())</code>, where the order of evaluation of the subexpressions might be arbitrary in a programming language, would see the global variable either set to 1 or to its previous value, but not in an intermediate state where only part has been updated. (The latter can happen in [[C (programming language)|C]], because the expression has no [[sequence point]].) The operating system might provide atomicity guarantees for [[signal (computing)|signals]], such as a system call interrupted by a signal not having a partial effect. The processor hardware might provide atomicity guarantees for [[interrupt]]s, such as interrupted processor instructions not having partial effects.\n\n==Examples==\nTo illustrate reentrancy, this article uses as an example a [[C (programming language)|C]] utility function, {{code|swap()}}, that takes two pointers and transposes their values, and an interrupt-handling routine that also calls the swap function.\n\n===Neither reentrant nor thread-safe===\nThis is an example swap function that fails to be reentrant or thread-safe. Since the <code>tmp</code> variable is globally shared, without serialization, among any concurrent instances of the function, one instance may interfere with the data relied upon by another. As such, it should not have been used in the interrupt service routine <code>isr()</code>:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nint tmp;\n\nvoid swap(int* x, int* y)\n{\n    tmp = *x;\n    *x = *y;\n    /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */\n    *y = tmp;    \n}\n\nvoid isr()\n{\n    int x = 1, y = 2;\n    swap(&x, &y);\n}\n</source>\n\n===Thread-safe but not reentrant===\nThe function {{code|swap()}} in the preceding example can be made thread-safe by making {{code|tmp}} [[Thread-local storage|thread-local]]. It still fails to be reentrant, and this will continue to cause problems if {{code|isr()}} is called in the same context as a thread already executing {{code|swap()}}:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\n_Thread_local int tmp;\n\nvoid swap(int* x, int* y)\n{\n    tmp = *x;\n    *x = *y;\n    /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */\n    *y = tmp;    \n}\n\nvoid isr()\n{\n    int x = 1, y = 2;\n    swap(&x, &y);\n}\n</source>\n\n===Reentrant but not thread-safe===\nThe following (somewhat contrived) modification of the swap function, which is careful to leave the global data in a consistent state at the time it exits, is reentrant; however, it is not thread-safe, since there are no locks employed, it can be interrupted at any time:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nint tmp;\n\nvoid swap(int* x, int* y)\n{\n    /* Save global variable. */\n    int s;\n    s = tmp;\n\n    tmp = *x;\n    *x = *y;\n    *y = tmp;     /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */\n\n    /* Restore global variable. */\n    tmp = s;\n}\n\nvoid isr()\n{\n    int x = 1, y = 2;\n    swap(&x, &y);\n}\n</source>\n\n===Reentrant and thread-safe===\nAn implementation of {{code|swap()}} that allocates {{code|tmp}} on the [[call stack|stack]] instead of globally and that is called only with unshared variables as parameters{{efn|If isr() called swap() with one or two global variables as parameters then swap() would not be reentrant}} is both thread-safe and reentrant. Thread-safe because the stack is local to a thread and a function acting just on local data will always produce the expected result. There is no access to shared data therefore no data race.\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nvoid swap(int* x, int* y)\n{\n    int tmp;\n    tmp = *x;\n    *x = *y;\n    *y = tmp;    /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */\n}\n\nvoid isr()\n{\n    int x = 1, y = 2;\n    swap(&x, &y);\n}\n</source>\n\n==Reentrant interrupt handler==\nA reentrant interrupt handler is an [[interrupt handler]] that re-enables interrupts early in the interrupt handler. This may reduce [[interrupt latency]].{{sfn|Sloss|Symes|Wright|Rayfield|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vdk4ZGRqMskC&pg=PA342 342]}} In general, while programming interrupt service routines, it is recommended to re-enable interrupts as soon as possible in the interrupt handler. This practice helps to avoid losing interrupts.{{r|Regehr (2006)}}\n\n==Further examples==\nIn the following code, neither <code>f</code> nor <code>g</code> functions are reentrant.\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nint v = 1;\n\nint f()\n{\n    v += 2;\n    return v;\n}\n\nint g()\n{\n    return f() + 2;\n}\n</source>\n\nIn the above, {{code|f()}} depends on a non-constant global variable {{code|v}}; thus, if {{code|f()}} is interrupted during execution by an ISR which modifies {{code|v}}, then reentry into {{code|f()}} will return the wrong value of {{code|v}}. The value of {{code|v}} and, therefore, the return value of {{code|f}}, cannot be predicted with confidence: they will vary depending on whether an interrupt modified {{code|v}} during {{code|f}}'s execution. Hence, {{code|f}} is not reentrant. Neither is {{code|g}}, because it calls {{code|f}}, which is not reentrant.\n\nThese slightly altered versions ''are'' reentrant:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nint f(int i)\n{\n    return i + 2;\n}\n\nint g(int i)\n{\n    return f(i) + 2;\n}\n</source>\n\nIn the following, the function is thread-safe, but not reentrant:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nint function()\n{\n    mutex_lock();\n\n    // ...\n    // function body\n    // ...\n\n    mutex_unlock();\n}\n</source>\n\nIn the above, {{code|function()}} can be called by different threads without any problem. But, if the function is used in a reentrant interrupt handler and a second interrupt arises inside the function, the second routine will hang forever. As interrupt servicing can disable other interrupts, the whole system could suffer.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Referential transparency]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Preshing (2013)\">\n  {{cite web\n  |last = Preshing\n  |first = Jeff\n  |title = Atomic vs. Non-Atomic Operations\n  |date = June 18, 2013\n  |website = Preshing on Programming\n  |url = http://preshing.com/20130618/atomic-vs-non-atomic-operations/\n  |access-date = April 24, 2018\n  |archive-url = https://archive.is/Yv6wS\n  |archive-date = December 3, 2014\n  |url-status = live\n  }}\n</ref>\n<ref name=\"Regehr (2006)\">\n{{cite encyclopedia\n  |last = Regehr\n  |first = John\n  |author-link = John Regehr\n  |title = Safe and Structured Use of Interrupts in Real-time and Embedded Software\n  |encyclopedia = Handbook of Real-Time and Embedded Systems\n  |publisher = [[CRC Press]]\n  |date = 2006\n  |url = http://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/interrupt_chapter.pdf\n  |format = PDF\n  |via = the author's website at the University of Utah School of Computing\n  |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070824025205/http://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/interrupt_chapter.pdf\n  |archive-date = August 24, 2007\n  |url-status = live\n  }}\n</ref>\n<ref name=\"Barron_1968_Recursive\">{{cite book |author-first=David William |author-last=Barron |author-link=David W.
