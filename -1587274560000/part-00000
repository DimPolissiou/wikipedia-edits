They occupied some area in an cool mountain slopes of the [[Barisan Mountains|Barisan mountain range]] in both sides of [[Bengkulu Province|Bengkulu]] and [[South Sumatra Province|South Sumatra]]. With approximately more than 1,3 million people, they form the largest ethnic group in Bengkulu Province. Rejangese people predominantly live as a majority in 5 out 10 regencies and city of Bengkulu Province, while the rest of them who lives in South Sumatera resides at 7 villages in the district called as Bermani Ulu Rawas. The Rejangs are predominantly an Islam adherent group with small numbers following a religion other than Islam. According to research, Rejangese people are the descendants of the Bukar-Sadong people who migrated from Northern Borneo ([[Sarawak]]).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe etymology of the name of Rejang or in [[Rejang language]] itself as Jang is remains unclear.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.klikwarta.com/index.php/rejang-salah-satu-suku-tertua-di-sumatera |title=Rejang Salah Satu Suku Tertua di Sumatera |publisher=Klik Warta |author=Benny Hakim Benardie |date=3 January 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-04 }}</ref> It is not clearly known when the name Rejang people was used or when did they first regard themselves as Rejang. Another question that is yet to be certain if the name Rejang itself is a term or reference name that was given by other neighboring ethnic groups. According to the locals of [[Lebong Regency]], it is believed that the word ''Rejang'' means \"to cross over\". This belief if based on a widely spread myth among the Rejang community in Tapus, which is believed to be the oldest Rejang settlement. The belief mentions that the ancestors of the Rejang people came from a distant land where its exact location is unknown. Hence, some scholars believe that the term Jang or Rejang has a correlation with the possibility of Rejangese people in ancient time did not reside in Sumatra.\n\nOn the basis of that belief, therefore according to Professor Richard McGinn's observation that presents a theory or hypothesis that the ancestors of the Rejang people originate from a region in the northern part of West Borneo that is known as [[Sarawak]] today, from which the ancestors of the Rejang people crossed over the [[Karimata Strait]] from [[Borneo]] to [[Sumatra]] with unclear reason. The term Jang or the verb Merejang means \"passed\" (specifically means \"passed the strait\") or \"traveling not on land\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repository.unib.ac.id/8995/1/I%2CII%2CIII%2CI-14-put-FH.pdf |title=Penyelesaian Konflik Ssosial Yang Timbul Dari Pemasangan Tapal Batas Kabupaten Rejang Lebong Dan Kabupaten Kepahiang Berbasis Hukum Kearifan Lokal |publisher=Universitas Bengkulu |author=Putra Setiadi |year=2014 |accessdate=2018-07-01 }}</ref> However, the meaning of Jang word which is the native term used by Rejangese people to describe themselves as a single entity remains unclear. The usage of that word also limited just for describing the entity of Jang and uncommon in the daily conversation. Upon their arrival at the estuary of the [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]], they went upwards [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]] and [[Rawas River]] towards the upstream to the place where majority of the Rejang settlements are today in the interior of [[Bengkulu Province]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard McGinn|title=Outline of Rejang Syntax|year=1939|publisher=Badan Penyelenggara Seri NUSA, Universitas Atma Jaya|oclc=896427174|page=59}}</ref> The term Rejang is also the same as the [[Rejang River]] in [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]], the place where it is thought to be the land of origin of the Rejang people before settling in [[Sumatra]].<ref name=\"OOBSHFR\"/>\n\nApart from that among the community of Taba Anyar Village, there is a story that the term Rejang and Lebong are correlated and is used as the name for [[Rejang Lebong Regency]] came from the common practice of ''merajang rebung'' (meaning \"chopping bamboo shoots\") in the Rejang community that is still seen today. Bamboo shoots have long been consumed as a food source in the interior of [[Bengkulu Province]]. From the common practice of chopping bamboo shoots, then came the term Rejang and Lebong. Nevertheless, this one story is doubted by many parties due to the impression of simply rhyme matching the terms alone.\n\n==Population==\nThe population is not well measured, with estimates from 250,000 to a million.

According to reports of Dutch officials in [[Bengkulu]], the Rejang was divided into 5 linguistic and tribal groups, each of which was subject to a separate leader.

[[Bengkulu language]] at this moment is seen as a lingua franca to carry out communication between the native Rejang people and the non-native ethnic people. [[Bengkulu language]] is a variant of the [[Malay language]] with its own native speakers in [[Bengkulu Province]]. [[Bengkulu language]] is known for its similarities with [[Minangkabau language]] and [[Palembang Malay]].\n\nAccording to the observations and research made by Professor Richard McGinn from University of Ohio, the [[Austronesian languages]] expert suggest a hypothesis or theory that the Rejang people originate from outside of [[Sumatra]] and migrated there for reason yet to be known. [[Sarawak]] is the region where it is said to be the birthplace of the Rejang people before migrating to [[Sumatra]]. The [[Rejang language]] according to Professor Richard McGinn does not have a single related language in [[Sumatra]].

However, the most well known is the Goddess of Paddy or Goddess of Fertility that is known as Nyang Serai.

One of the main locations to ''betarak'' is in [[Mount Kaba]]. [[Mount Kaba]] is actually opened to the public. This area is a conservation area and permission from the officers at the entrance is required and it is an obligation to report the number of hikers. Nevertheless, based on the tale of Muning Raib, Rejang people from [[Curup]] are forbidden to enter [[Mount Kaba]] to avoid misfortune or calamity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pedomanbengkulu.com/2018/03/legenda-muning-raib-dalam-cerita-rakyat-bengkulu/ |title=Legenda Muning Raib dalam Cerita Rakyat Bengkulu |publisher=Pedoman Bengkulu |author=Eva De |year=12 March 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-24 }}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the ''diwo'' or ''nyang'' that's worshiped by the community, the ''smat'' group on the other hand are feared; be it of its nature to consume its victim nor to dwell in certain locations in the lands of the Rejang people. In order to avoid ''smat'', prayer and seeking permission must be done before entering a place or taking something from nature. Seeking a permission is done by saying, \"''stabik nik, keme nupang melitas''\", which means \"excuse me, granny, we're passing by\". Types of ''smat'' that the Rejang people believe are such as ''sebei sebkeu'', ''si'amang bi'oa'', ''sumei'' and ''smat la'ut''. There are some ''smat''s that are positioned as guards or ''tunggau'' in certain places. The most well known ''tunggau'' among the Rejang people is the Dung Ulau Tujuak or the Seven Headed Snake that inhabits the ''srawung'' or underwater cave beneath the [[Tes Lake]], [[Lebong Regency]].\n\nThe old Rejang society regard the jungle as a gift by God and as the source of life. The jungle are the source of timber, honey and animal game. When clearing the jungle, the ''tabeus'' ritual is carried out to seek permission from the ancestral guardian of the jungle before the clearing of the jungle is carried out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://liveindonesia.id/en/ilmu-penjinak-api-di-suku-serawai-dan-rejang/ |title=Ilmu Penjinak Api Di Suku Serawai Dan Rejang |publisher=Live Knowledge |author=Harry Siswoyo |date=19 February 2017 |accessdate=2018-06-25 }}</ref> Just as in other society, the jungle or ''imbo'' are usually inhabited by mystical animals such as ''imeu'' or tiger.

They occupied some area in an cool mountain slopes of the [[Barisan Mountains|Barisan mountain range]] in both sides of [[Bengkulu Province|Bengkulu]] and [[South Sumatra Province|South Sumatra]]. With approximately more than 1,3 million people, they form the largest ethnic group in Bengkulu Province. Rejangese people predominantly live as a majority in 5 out 10 regencies and city of Bengkulu Province, while the rest of them who lives in South Sumatera resides at 7 villages in the district called as Bermani Ulu Rawas. The Rejangs are predominantly an Islam adherent group with small numbers following a religion other than Islam. According to research, Rejangese people are the descendants of the Bukar-Sadong people who migrated from Northern Borneo ([[Sarawak]]).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe etymology of the name of Rejang or in [[Rejang language]] itself as Jang is remains unclear.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.klikwarta.com/index.php/rejang-salah-satu-suku-tertua-di-sumatera |title=Rejang Salah Satu Suku Tertua di Sumatera |publisher=Klik Warta |author=Benny Hakim Benardie |date=3 January 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-04 }}</ref> It is not clearly known when the name Rejang people was used or when did they first regard themselves as Rejang. Another question that is yet to be certain if the name Rejang itself is a term or reference name that was given by other neighboring ethnic groups. According to the locals of [[Lebong Regency]], it is believed that the word ''Rejang'' means \"to cross over\". This belief if based on a widely spread myth among the Rejang community in Tapus, which is believed to be the oldest Rejang settlement. The belief mentions that the ancestors of the Rejang people came from a distant land where its exact location is unknown. Hence, some scholars believe that the term Jang or Rejang has a correlation with the possibility of Rejangese people in ancient time did not reside in Sumatra.\n\nOn the basis of that belief, therefore according to Professor Richard McGinn's observation that presents a theory or hypothesis that the ancestors of the Rejang people originate from a region in the northern part of West Borneo that is known as [[Sarawak]] today, from which the ancestors of the Rejang people crossed over the [[Karimata Strait]] from [[Borneo]] to [[Sumatra]] with unclear reason. The term Jang or the verb Merejang means \"passed\" (specifically means \"passed the strait\") or \"traveling not on land\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repository.unib.ac.id/8995/1/I%2CII%2CIII%2CI-14-put-FH.pdf |title=Penyelesaian Konflik Ssosial Yang Timbul Dari Pemasangan Tapal Batas Kabupaten Rejang Lebong Dan Kabupaten Kepahiang Berbasis Hukum Kearifan Lokal |publisher=Universitas Bengkulu |author=Putra Setiadi |year=2014 |accessdate=2018-07-01 }}</ref> However, the meaning of Jang word which is the native term used by Rejangese people to describe themselves as a single entity remains unclear.

Bamboo shoots have long been consumed as a food source in the interior of [[Bengkulu Province]]. From the common practice of chopping bamboo shoots, then came the term Rejang and Lebong.

[[Bengkulu language]] is known for its similarities with [[Minangkabau language]] and [[Palembang Malay]].\n\nAccording to the observations and research made by Professor Richard McGinn from University of Ohio, the [[Austronesian languages]] expert suggest a hypothesis or theory that the Rejang people originate from outside of [[Sumatra]] and migrated there for reason yet to be known. [[Sarawak]] is the region where it is said to be the birthplace of the Rejang people before migrating to [[Sumatra]]. The [[Rejang language]] according to Professor Richard McGinn does not have a single related language in [[Sumatra]]. Based on his observations the closest language to the [[Rejang language]] is the [[Bukar Sadong language]] in [[Sarawak]] that is classified under the [[Bidayuh]] people or previously known as \"Land Dayak\" people.<ref>{{cite book|contribution=Institut voor taal-, land- en volkenkunde van Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb, The Hague, JSTOR|title=Bijdragen tot de taal-, land- en volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb, Volume 163, Issues 1-4|year=2007|publisher=M.

The main characteristics of the script are the sharp and bold straight lines in contrary to [[Javanese script]] and [[Balinese script]] that are more wavy. The evolution of the [[Rejang script]] that led to its sharp, straight and bold lines is said to be the consequences of the adaption of writing on wood, bones, bark cloth, bamboo, buffalo horn and (now lost) copper plates.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter T.

According to folk tales, the [[Rejang script]] was first written with sharp tools including sickle which produces sharp lines. According to other tales, [[Rejang script]] is referred to as ''rikung'' due to its cornering angles. There are 19 main consonants (''buak tu'ai'') in [[Rejang script]], changes in vowel sound (''tando ketikeak'') and 9 doubling consonants (''buak ngimbang'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repository.unib.ac.id/8964/1/I%2CII%2CIII%2CI-14-ria-FK.pdf |title=Studi Deskriptif Implementasi Muatan Lokal Bahasa Rejang Dalam Menanamkan Rasa Cinta Tanah Air Siswa Kelas IV SDN 04 Kecamatan Kerkap Bengkulu Utara |author=Ria Nurdayani |publisher=Universitas Bengkulu |page=15 |year=2014 |accessdate=2018-06-17 }}</ref> These 28 alphabets are assigned single or double [[diacritic]] marks to produce sounds other than \"a\" and also produce [[diphthong]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode10.0.0/ch17.pdf |title=Unicode\u00ae 10.0.0 |publisher=Unicode |page=675 |isbn=978-1-936213-16-0 |date=20 June 2017 |accessdate=2018-06-17 }}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n===Folk religion===\nNot much is known about the religion or the beliefs that is practiced by the ancestors of the Rejang people. The most clearest and important relics that exist today that states about the spiritual or religious experiences of the old Rejang society are the ''rejung'' and ''kedurai agung'' tradition. Both of these traditions are inseparable from each other.

Its height could reach up to 2 meters.

''Diwo'' refers to \"gods\" and ''nyang'' refers to \"goddess\". The names of the gods and goddesses of the folk belief of the Rejang people are almost unknown. However, the most well known is the Goddess of Paddy or Goddess of Fertility that is known as Nyang Serai. Nyang Serai is the Rejang people's version of Javanese Goddess of Paddy, [[Dewi Sri]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Wolfgang Marschall & Victor T. King|title=The Rejang of Southern Sumatra|year=1992|publisher=Centre for South-East Asian Studies|isbn=08-595-8586-7|page=38}}</ref> In honor of the goddess, people in the past would make offerings of sacrificial animals, burn incense or deliver [[Appam|apem]] pancake. One of the most famous places to carry out the offerings ritual is Bingin Kuning District in [[Lebong Regency]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rmolbengkulu.com/read/2018/02/19/6767/Kisah--Tenggelamnya--Dusun-Tras-Mambang-Dan-Terbentuknya-Keramat-Bingin-Kuning- |title=Kisah Tenggelamnya Dusun Tras Mambang Dan Terbentuknya Keramat Bingin Kuning |publisher=RMOL Bengkulu |author=Alexander |year=19 February 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-24 }}</ref>\n\nThere is also a term used for hermitage or prayer to the deities in [[Rejang language]] that is called ''betarak''. One of the main locations to ''betarak'' is in [[Mount Kaba]]. [[Mount Kaba]] is actually opened to the public. This area is a conservation area and permission from the officers at the entrance is required and it is an obligation to report the number of hikers. Nevertheless, based on the tale of Muning Raib, Rejang people from [[Curup]] are forbidden to enter [[Mount Kaba]] to avoid misfortune or calamity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pedomanbengkulu.com/2018/03/legenda-muning-raib-dalam-cerita-rakyat-bengkulu/ |title=Legenda Muning Raib dalam Cerita Rakyat Bengkulu |publisher=Pedoman Bengkulu |author=Eva De |year=12 March 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-24 }}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the ''diwo'' or ''nyang'' that's worshiped by the community, the ''smat'' group on the other hand are feared; be it of its nature to consume its victim nor to dwell in certain locations in the lands of the Rejang people. In order to avoid ''smat'', prayer and seeking permission must be done before entering a place or taking something from nature. Seeking a permission is done by saying, \"''stabik nik, keme nupang melitas''\", which means \"excuse me, granny, we're passing by\". Types of ''smat'' that the Rejang people believe are such as ''sebei sebkeu'', ''si'amang bi'oa'', ''sumei'' and ''smat la'ut''. There are some ''smat''s that are positioned as guards or ''tunggau'' in certain places. The most well known ''tunggau'' among the Rejang people is the Dung Ulau Tujuak or the Seven Headed Snake that inhabits the ''srawung'' or underwater cave beneath the [[Tes Lake]], [[Lebong Regency]].\n\nThe old Rejang society regard the jungle as a gift by God and as the source of life. The jungle are the source of timber, honey and animal game. When clearing the jungle, the ''tabeus'' ritual is carried out to seek permission from the ancestral guardian of the jungle before the clearing of the jungle is carried out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://liveindonesia.id/en/ilmu-penjinak-api-di-suku-serawai-dan-rejang/ |title=Ilmu Penjinak Api Di Suku Serawai Dan Rejang |publisher=Live Knowledge |author=Harry Siswoyo |date=19 February 2017 |accessdate=2018-06-25 }}</ref> Just as in other society, the jungle or ''imbo'' are usually inhabited by mystical animals such as ''imeu'' or tiger. For the Rejang community, the tiger is seen as an ancestral incarnation, sacred and should not be hurt or killed. Tigers are seen as old relatives addressed as ''datuk'', ''ninik'' or ''puyang''.\n\n===Present day beliefs===\nAt present, many of the Rejang people embraces [[Islam]].

At this time 45 students were enrolled in five programs at the college. The main campus' cornerstone was dedicated on June 4, 1970. The cornerstone is a [[time capsule]] containing coins, bills, stamps, the college calendar for 1970\u201371, a copy of the school's charter, the school seal, a copy of the land deed for the college among other items.\nThe first president of Lambton College was Wolfgang Franke. He started full-time duties in January 1967 and his starting salary was $18,000. The first faculty tour of the original site was delayed because the building housing the classrooms was locked and no one had the key. Faculty member Ron Lawrence discovered (much to his dismay) that his house key fit the lock.\nIn 1975 a sculpture commissioned by the school, ''[[Homage (sculpture)|Homage]]'', was constructed by artist [[Haydn Llewellyn Davies|Haydn Davies]]. The college destroyed the sculpture in 2005. The destruction of the sculpture has been controversial and was the subject of a lawsuit settled in 2010.<ref>{{cite news |first= James |last= Adams |title= College and sculptor resolve dispute over

At this time 45 students were enrolled in five programs at the college. The main campus' cornerstone was dedicated on June 4, 1970. The cornerstone is a [[time capsule]] containing coins, bills, stamps, the college calendar for 1970\u201371, a copy of the school's charter, the school seal, a copy of the land deed for the college among other items.\nThe first president of Lambton College was Wolfgang Franke. He started full-time duties in January 1967 and his starting salary was $18,000. The first faculty tour of the original site was delayed because the building housing the classrooms was locked and no one had the key. Faculty member Ron Lawrence discovered (much to his dismay) that his house key fit the lock.\nIn 1975 a sculpture commissioned by the school, ''[[Homage (sculpture)|Homage]]'', was constructed by artist [[Haydn Llewellyn Davies|Haydn Davies]]. The college destroyed the sculpture in 2005. The destruction of the sculpture has been controversial and was the subject of a lawsuit settled in 2010.<ref>{{cite news |first= James |last= Adams |title= College and sculptor resolve dispute over destroyed art |date= 23 August 2012 |origyear= 22 May 2010 |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/college-and-sculptor-resolve-dispute-over-destroyed-art/article4319964/ |newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] |accessdate= 2014-01-26}}</ref><ref name=\"Alfoldy2012\">{{cite book |last= Alfoldy |first= Sandra |title= Allied Arts: Architecture and Craft in Postwar Canada |year= 2012 |publisher= McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP |isbn= 9780773539600 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=4dUBJv6Rn_AC&pg=PA83 82\u20134] |chapter= Chapter 3: Scale and Form}}</ref>\n\n==International==\nLambton's international programming began in 1996 with an initiative in China.<ref>{{cite news |first= JD |last= Booth |title= Lambton's international flavour no accident for academic strategists looking to the future |url= http://www.lambtonshield.com/lambtons-international-flavour-no-accident-for-academic-strategists-looking-to-the-future/ |date= 13 May 2011 |accessdate= 2014-01-26}}</ref> The international department at Lambton now includes campuses in China, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia and there are between 380 and 500 international students on-campus and 3,500 at international campuses.<ref name= \"Booth20111214\"/><ref>{{cite news |first= JD |last= Booth |date= 17 July 2011 |title= Lambton College making its global mark |url= http://www.lambtonshield.com/lambton-college-making-its-global-mark/ |newspaper= LambtonShield.com |accessdate= 2014-01-26}}</ref>\n\n==Scholarships and bursaries==\nLambton College offers a variety of scholarships and bursaries.<ref>{{cite news |first= JD |last= Booth |date= 21 November 2011 |title= Lambton College scholarships total nearly $85k this year |url= http://www.lambtonshield.com/lambton-college-scholarships-total-nearly-85k-this-year/ |newspaper= LambtonShield.com |accessdate= 2014-01-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mylambton.ca/financial_aid/home |title= Financial Aid Home |work= mylambton.ca}}</ref> Lambton College scholarships for [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]], [[First Nations]] and [[M\u00e9tis]] students include: Aboriginal Post Secondary Education & Training Bursary.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/4078514441563/4078514441563?sb=bn&q=Lambton+College&bp=&fs=000&ag=000&srcDC=10 |title= Aboriginal Post Secondary Education & Training Bursary: Lambton College |publisher= [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada]], [[Government of Canada]] |accessdate= 2014-01-26|date= 2012-11-29 }}</ref>\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Judy Foote]]\n* [[Vishal Dhankhar]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Canadian government scientific research organizations]]\n* [[Canadian industrial research and development organizations]]\n* [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]]\n* [[Canadian university scientific research organizations]]\n* [[Higher education in Ontario]]\n* [[List of colleges in Ontario]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://www.lambton.on.ca/ Lambton College}}\n{{Commons}}\n\n{{Ont post-secondary|c}}\n\n[[Category:1967 establishments in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Colleges in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1967]]\n[[Category:Education in Sarnia]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Lambton County]]\n", "name_user": "Red dwarf", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambton_College"}

[[Shinjuku Golden Gai]], famous for plethora of small bars, is part of Kabukicho.\n\nThe district's name comes from late-1940s plans to build a [[kabuki]] theater; although the theater was never built, the name stuck.\n\nThe area has many movie theaters, and is located near [[Shinjuku Station]], [[Seibu Shinjuku Station]], and several other major railway and subway stations.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kabukicho cropped GSI CKT20092-C62-15 20090427.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial photograph (2009)]]\nOriginally, the area was known as {{nihongo|'''Tsunohazu'''|\u89d2\u7b48}} and was a swamp. After the [[Meiji Period]], the area became a duck sanctuary. As the Yodobashi Purification Plant was built in 1893, the ponds were filled in. In 1920, a girls' school was built there, and the surroundings were developed into a residential area. Prior to [[World War II]], the district was one of the areas open to foreign-born property owners (primarily from Taiwan and Korea), who mainly operated ''tsurekomi yado'', predecessors to today's [[love hotel]]s.<ref name=JT-2002/>\n\nDuring the war, a [[Bombing of Tokyo in World War II|bombing raid]] on April 13, 1945, razed the area to the ground.<ref name=JT-2002/> After the war, Kihei Suzuki from the Association of Readjustment and Reconstruction of Shinjuku worked with the major landowner, Mohei Minejima to draw up plans for Kiku-za, a kabuki theatre, in the area; they believed that performers from the [[Kabuki-za]] theatre in Ginza would accept their invitation to perform at Kiku-za.<ref name=JT-2002/> As a result, Hideaki Ishikawa, a regional planner,  dubbed the town Kabukich\u014d, which was adopted on April 1, 1948.
