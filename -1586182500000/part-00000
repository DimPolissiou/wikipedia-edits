Most occur in the [[tropics]] and [[subtropics]], and many can run over water. They are commonly called ''stretch spiders'' in reference to their elongated body form and their ability to hide on blades of [[grass]] or similar elongated substrates by stretching their front [[arthropod leg|legs]] forward and the others behind them. The name ''Tetragnatha'' is derived from Greek, ''tetra-'' a [[numerical prefix]] referring to [[four (number)|four]] and ''gnatha'' meaning \"[[jaw]]\". On the Hawaiian islands, a shift of cursorial behavior occurred long ago, when their ancestors first arrived on the island chain.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gillespie |first1=R.G. |last2=Croom |first2=H.B. |last3=Palumbi |first3=S.R. |authorlink3=Stephen R.

Both of his parents were immigrants from [[Germany]], and both were alcoholics.<ref>{{cite web |title=William Kemmler |publisher=NNDB: Tracking the Entire World |accessdate=March 14, 2012 |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/249/000163757/}}</ref> After dropping out of school at age 10, having learned neither how to read nor write, Kemmler worked in his father's butcher shop. His father would die from an infection that he received after a drunken brawl and his mother from complications of alcoholism. Kemmler was reportedly slender, with dark brown hair. He spoke both English and German.\n\nAfter his parents died, he went into the [[peddling]] business, and earned enough money to buy a horse and cart. At this point, however, he was also becoming a heavy drinker. In one episode involving him and his friends, after a series of drunken binges, he said he could jump his horse and cart over an eight-foot fence, with the cart attached to the horse. Unsurprisingly, the attempt was a failure, and his cart and goods were destroyed in the incident. He was known to friends as \"Philadelphia Billy,\" and his drinking binges were very well known around the saloons in his Buffalo neighborhood. \n\n===Murder, trial, and appeals===\n{{Further|War of the currents}}\nThe New York Times provided a summary of what had occurred as follows:\n<blockquote>William Kemmler was a vegetable peddler in the slums of Buffalo, New York. An alcoholic, on March 29, 1888, he was recovering from a drinking binge the night before when he became enraged with his girlfriend [elsewhere referred to as his common-law wife] Tillie Ziegler. He accused her of stealing from him and preparing to run away with a friend of his. When the argument reached a peak, Kemmler calmly went to the barn, grabbed a hatchet, and returned to the house. He struck Tillie repeatedly, killing her. He then went to a neighbor's house and announced he had just murdered his girlfriend.</blockquote> \n\nThat same day, Kemmler was accused of the murder of Matilda \"Tillie\" Ziegler, his [[Common-law marriage|common-law wife]],<ref>Ruddick, N.

Journal of American Culture (01911813), 21(4), 79.</ref> who had been killed with a [[hatchet]]. \n\n<blockquote>Kemmler's resulting murder trial proceeded quickly. He was convicted of first-degree murder on May 10. Three days later he was sentenced to death, destined to be the first person executed in an electric chair under New York's new execution law replacing hanging with electrocution. A chair was ready at the Auburn state prison. However, the leading developers of electrical power, including George Westinghouse, did not want to see their new product used in this manner. A lawyer filed an appeal claiming the electric chair violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.<ref name=nyt /></blockquote>\n\nOn January 1, 1888, New York had instituted death by [[electrocution]], the first such law ever.

After nine years of development and legislation, the chair was considered ready for use. Kemmler's lawyers appealed, arguing that electrocution was [[cruel and unusual punishment]].\n \nThe plan to carry out Kemmler's execution via electric chair drew the situation into the AC/DC \"[[war of currents]]\" between [[George Westinghouse]], the largest supplier of [[alternating current]] equipment, and [[Thomas Edison]], whose company ran its equipment on [[direct current]]. The alternating current that powered the electric chair (a current standard adopted by a committee after a demonstration performed at Edison's laboratory by anti-AC activist [[Harold P.

The stench was unbearable.\"<ref name=nyt/> Upon autopsy, doctors had found the blood vessels under the cap of the skull had carbonized and the top of the brain had actually ''hardened.''

The competitive newspaper reporters covering the Kemmler execution jumped on the abnormalities as each newspaper source tried to outdo each other with sensational headlines and reports.

movement organization|far right movement organisation]].{{sfn|Jackson|2011|p=14}} In its organisational structure, the EDL has been characterised by academic observers as a [[direct action]] or street-based protest movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Jackson|1y=2011|1p=7|2a1=Treadwell|2a2=Garland|2y=2011|2p=261|3a1=Kassimeris|3a2=Jackson|3y=2015|3p=171}} It is a [[pressure group]] rather than a [[political party]].{{sfn|Richards|2013|p=190}} During fieldwork with the group, Joel Busher found that many EDL members stressed the idea that the group was not a political organisation, instead presenting it as a single-issue protest group or street movement.{{sfn|Busher|2018|pp=323\u2013324}} Busher noted that these individuals were aware of the tactical advantages of doing so, believing that in presenting itself in this manner it could avoid associations both with older far-right groups like the NF and BNP and with accusations of racism.{{sfn|Busher|2018|p=328}} Like several other counter-jihad groups operating in Western countries,{{sfn|Aked|2017|p=165}} the EDL describes itself as a [[human rights]] organisation,{{sfnm|1a1=Jackson|1y=2011|1p=12|2a1=Kassimeris|2a2=Jackson|2y=2015|2p=172|3a1=Braouezec|3y=2016|3p=638|4a1=Pilkington|4y=2016|4p=4|5a1=Romdenh-Romluc|5y=2016|5p=601}} although this characterisation is not widely accepted among the British public.{{sfn|Romdenh-Romluc|2016|p=602}}\n\n==Leadership and branches==\n\n[[File:Tommy Robinson PEGIDA.png|thumb|right|Robinson was the EDL's co-leader during its period of major growth and national attention]]\n\nUntil October 2013, the EDL was based in Luton.{{sfn|Busher|2018|p=326}} The EDL's structure was informal and lacking in any strict hierarchy,{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=44}} while it also lacked any clear leadership.{{sfn|Winlow|Hall|Treadwell|2017|p=183}} In its early years, the EDL was controlled by a leadership group referred to as the \"team\" and which were generally secretive about their operations;{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=19}} they often remained anonymous or used pseudonyms.{{sfn|Trilling|2012|p=183}} As of June 2010, this group consisted of six men, including Robinson.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=19}} In the summer of 2010, the EDL went through a formal restructuring to deal with Robinson's absence.{{sfn|Jackson|2011|pp=21\u201322}} The 2010 reforms included the introduction of a code of conduct which commanded members to respect and obey the leadership, to act in a unified manner, and to be aware that any comments that they made to the press would be taken as formal EDL statements.{{sfn|Jackson|2011|p=22}} Till October 2013, the EDL was led by Robinson and Carroll as co-leaders, supported by the regional organisers of the 19 regional divisions.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=42}} EDL members were expected to take an oath of allegiance to the organisation's leadership.{{sfn|Alessio|Meredith|2014|p=112}} After that duo left the group, it was reorganised around a committee leadership which was headed by a rotating chair.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=41}}\n\nThe EDL lacked a central regulatory structure through which to impose a uniform approach to strategy or maintain ideological purity throughout.{{sfnm|1a1=Winlow|1a2=Hall|1a3=Treadwell|1y=2017|1p=184|2a1=Brindle|2y=2016|2p=445}} It operated through a loose network of local divisions,{{sfn|Busher|2018|p=326}} each of which had a good deal of autonomy.{{sfn|Winlow|Hall|Treadwell|2017|p=184}} Winlow, Hall, and Treadwell found that most members liked the group's \"messy structure and imprecise goals\" and did not want to be part of a highly structured organisation under firm leadership.{{sfn|Winlow|Hall|Treadwell|2017|p=182}}\nThe EDL divided into at least ninety different divisions,{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2010|1p=20|2a1=Alessio|2a2=Meredith|2y=2014|2p=112}} some of which are based on locality and others on specialist groups.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=19}} These have included a women's division, Jewish division, Sikh division, Hindu division, and LGBT division.{{sfn|Alessio|Meredith|2014|p=112}} For a brief period it also had a disabled division,{{sfn|Allen|2011|p=287}} as well as a green division,{{sfn|Allen|2011|p=287}} and a soldiers' division.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=19}} These groups are designed to raise the profile of a particular social group within the EDL itself and helping the organisation to draw in recruits from sectors of society that would normally avoid membership in a far-right grouping, such as ethnic minorities and LGBT people.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|pp=20\u201321}} In its early years it also formed a youth division, the English Defence Youth, which was led by Joel Titus; after Titus received a [[Anti-social behaviour order|criminally-related anti-social behaviour order]] (CRASBO), preventing his further involvement in the EDL, the youth division became largely inactive.{{sfn|Jackson|2011|p=20}}\n\nThe local groups were organised into a series of nine areas: North West, North East, East Midlands, West Midlands, East Anglia, South West, South East, South East Central, and Greater London.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=19}} From the summer of 2010 onward, each of these had its own regional organiser.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2010|1p=19|2a1=Jackson|2y=2011|2p=21}} The EDL was heavily reliant on these grassroots networks and the initiative of local and regional leaders.{{sfn|Jackson|2011|p=5}} Some of the local divisions covered whole cities or counties while in other cases there could be more than one division representing a single postcode, in part due to personal disputes.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|pp=42\u201343}}\n\nBranches typically held their meeting in pubs with sympathetic owners, which are referred to as \"HQs\".{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|pp=15, 44}} Pilkington observed that these meetings always features alcohol consumption.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=44}} Such divisional meetings were infrequent and often poorly attended.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=43}} They were typically unstructured, lacking any formal agenda or the taking of minutes, and were mainly an opportunity for divisional organisers to inform members of their decisions.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=43}} Sometimes guest speakers were also invited to address the audience.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=43}} As well as these divisional meetings, the EDL divisions also held \"meet and greet\" events to attract new membership.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=43}} There was no system of official membership recognised through membership cards,{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=5}} and no membership fees.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2010|1p=20|2a1=Pilkington|2y=2016|2p=49}} The EDL accepted donations and local divisions sought to raise funds by selling merchandise and holding fundraising events such as barbeques.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=49}}\n\n===Demonstrations===\n\n{{main|List of English Defence League demonstrations}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = EDL activism has taken place across a range of more or less public and managed spaces.

In the 1930s, the [[British Union of Fascists]] marched through areas with high Jewish populations to intimidate and provoke them, while in the 1970s the National Front employed similar tactics in areas with large non-white communities, an approach also used in the 1980s and 1990s by the British National Party till being abandoned after 1999.{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=376}}\n\nIn 2011, Bartlett and Littler stated their view that the EDL's largest demonstration contained between 2000 and 3000 protesters.{{sfn|Bartlett|Littler|2011|p=4}}\nCopsey noted that the \"overwhelming majority\" of attendees at EDL demonstrations are \"young, white, working-class males\".{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=29}}\nAlthough EDL demonstrations have included people of colour, in general they remain overwhelmingly white.{{sfn|Richards|2013|p=183}} At events, many members sought to have their photograph taken with the few Sikhs who attended, thus seeking to bolster the idea that they were not personally racist.{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=384}} Copsey suggested that many Sikhs who were sympathetic to the EDL were nevertheless put off from attending rallies due to an awareness that many of the EDL's white members would not be able to differentiate between Sikhs and Muslims.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=23}}\nThe events were also numerically dominated by men, with relatively few women attending.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=30}}\nAt demonstrations, speeches typically focus on the perceived threat of Islamification, but also raise issues like the dangers of political correctness and the errors of the [[Left-wing politics|political left]].{{sfn|Busher|2018|p=329}}\nDuring demonstrations, the EDL have regularly been met with opposition from anti-fascist groups like [[Unite Against Fascism]],{{sfn|Braouezec|2016|p=644}} and sometimes also from Islamic groups.{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=379}} The clashes between the rival groups often resulted in violence and public disorder,{{sfnm|1a1=Kassimeris|1a2=Jackson|1y=2015|1p=171|2a1=Brindle|2y=2016|2p=445|3a1=Meadowcroft|3a2=Morrow|3y=2017|3p=375}} with the police seeking to keep the two apart.{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=379}}\n\n[[Image:English Defence League protest in Newcastle.jpg|thumb|left|[[Demonstration (people)|Street protest]] organised by the EDL in Newcastle, England. (The placard reads ''\"Shut down the Mosque Command and Control Centre.\"'')]]\n\nTo reach national events, local EDL groups often hired coaches to transport them to their destination;{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|pp=14, 181}} en route, they often displayed EDL flags from the coach windows.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=187}} The coach provided a space in which these members engaged in singing, banter, story-telling, and practical jokes.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=181}} As well as being protests, these demonstrations served as social events for EDL members,{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=383}} helping to forge a sense of solidarity and of the EDL as \"one big family\".{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=180}} At demonstrations, many members\u2014including those who may be too young to legally drink alcohol\u2014consume large quantities of alcohol.{{sfnm|1a1=Meadowcroft|1a2=Morrow|1y=2017|1p=383|2a1=Winlow|2a2=Hall|2a3=Treadwell|2y=2017|2p=7}} Many of these events begin and/or end at a pub, which is used as a meeting place.{{sfnm|1a1=Pilkington|1y=2016|1p=15|2a1=Meadowcroft|2a2=Morrow|2y=2017|2p=383}} Some members also take [[cocaine]] prior to attending demonstrations.{{sfnm|1a1=Pilkington|1y=2016|1p=181|2a1=Winlow|2a2=Hall|2a3=Treadwell|2y=2017|2p=149}}\n\nEDL demonstrations were typified by continuous chanting with aggressive slogans aimed at Muslims.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2010|1p=30|2a1=Meadowcroft|2a2=Morrow|2y=2017|2p=375}} Pilkington divided these chants into three types: those which were anti-Islam, those which were patriotic in referencing an English identity, and those which were identity affirming in making specific reference to the EDL itself.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=196}} Examples of the first category included \"Muslim bombers off our streets\",{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|pp=140, 185}} \"No surrender to the Taliban\",{{sfnm|1a1=Garland|1a2=Treadwell|1y=2010|1p=26|2a1=Meadowcroft|2a2=Morrow|2y=2017|2p=375}} \"Protect women, no to sharia\",{{sfn|Garland|Treadwell|2010|p=25}} \"If you wear a burqa you're a cunt\",{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=375}} \"You can stick your fucking Islam up your arse\",{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=140}} \"You can shove your fucking Allah up your arse\",{{sfnm|1a1=Garland|1a2=Treadwell|1y=2010|1p=32|2a1=Meadowcroft|2a2=Morrow|2y=2017|2p=375}} \"Allah is a paedo\",{{sfnm|1a1=Pilkington|1y=2016|1p=133|2a1=Busher|2y=2018|2p=329}} and \"Allah, Allah, who the fuck is Allah?\".{{sfnm|1a1=Pilkington|1y=2016|1p=140|2a1=Meadowcroft|2a2=Morrow|2y=2017|2p=375}} Examples of the second category include \"I'm England till I die\",{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=375}} \"We want our country back\",{{sfn|Garland|Treadwell|2010|p=25}} and \"Whose streets?

EDL\".{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=185}} When confronting counter-protesters from the UAF and other groups, EDL members often chanted \"You're not English anymore\".{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|pp=31, 197}} Alongside chants, the EDL often employed songs, including the UK national anthem \"[[God Save the Queen]]\", patriotic songs like \"Keep St George in my Heart, Keep me English\"\u2014sung to the tune of the hymn \"Give Me Joy in My Heart\"\u2014and the anti-Islam themed \"There were Ten Muslim Bombers in the Air\".{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=196}}\n\nAt the demonstrations, EDL members often displayed the English flag of St George as well as the British [[Union Jack]]; the Israeli and LGBT Pride flags were also often in attendance.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|pp=187\u2013188}} As with various older far-right street organisations like the Italian Squadristi or German [[Sturmabteilung]], the EDL had a \"street uniform\" that members wore in the form of wristbands, t-shirts, and hoodies bearing the group's logo.{{sfn|Alessio|Meredith|2014|p=108}} Many members also wore masks decorated with either the EDL logo or the St George's cross.{{sfn|Alessio|Meredith|2014|p=108}} Some also wore pig face masks or masks of figures whom they wished to ridicule, such as the Salafi jihadist leader [[Osama bin Laden]].{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=193}} The use of the hoodie has symbolic connections with anti-social behaviour and the stereotype of the [[chav]]; it was thus selected for its intimidating atmosphere and as a reassertion of working-class status.{{sfnm|1a1=Alessio|1a2=Meredith|1y=2014|1p=108|2a1=Pilkington|2y=2016|2p=191}} In wearing such a uniform, the EDL seek to construct a unified political identity.{{sfn|Alessio|Meredith|2014|p=109}} Wearing this material helps to cement individual's loyalty to the group, particularly as they are likely to experience disapproval from other members of the public while wearing it.{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=383}} Reflecting the place of football hooligans in the EDL, some of its male members wore expensive designer clothing to its rallies, most notably [[Fred Perry]] polo shirts, jeans or combat trousers, and [[Adidas]] trainers.{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=383}} A number of attendees also display EDL-themed tattoos.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=187}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Lager, cocaine, a bit of shouting and singing, the possibility of a punch-up, surrounded by friends and like-minded others - there was an air of adventure to proceedings, and some found all of this very attractive.\n| source=\u2014 Simon Winlow, Steve Hall, and James Treadwell on EDL demonstrations{{sfn|Winlow|Hall|Treadwell|2017|p=185}} \n| align = right\n| width = 25em\n}}\n\nThe police and local authorities initially allowed most EDL rallies to take place and did not often request banning orders.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=32}} In October 2010, [[West Yorkshire Police]] successfully requested a government ban on the EDL holding a rally in [[Bradford]], fearing that it would spark violent racial tensions akin to those [[2001 Bradford riots|which had taken place in 2001]].{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=32}} In October 2010, the [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] granted Leicester Police's request to ban a planned EDL march in that city.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=32}} By September 2011, over 600 arrests had been made in connection with EDL demonstrations and the policing costs were estimated to have exceeded \u00a310 million.{{sfn|Kassimeris|Jackson|2015|p=172}} In some cases, the majority of those arrested during a demonstration have been from the EDL; on other instances the majority of those arrested have been from groups protesting against the EDL.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=29}} After the group's August 2009 rally in Birmingham for example, in which it first reached national attention, a number of young Asian counter-protesters attacked several unrelated white youths they found in the city, leading the police to pursue the counter-protesters.{{sfn|Garland|Treadwell|2010|p=24}} Through her ethnographic fieldwork within the EDL, Pilkington found that more members felt that the group's tactics would be ineffective than deemed them effective; some even regarded them as counterproductive due to the presence of members who were drunk or who appeared idiotic by displaying the flag upside-down or placards with misspelled words.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=53}}  Although some EDL members expressed reservations about the violent tactics adopted by others, this was not considered sufficient to stop many of them from returning to further events.{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=380}}\n\n====Mobilising on local issues====\n\nIn various cases, the EDL mobilised around localised tensions between Islamic and non-Muslim communities. These were often organised by local divisions rather than by the group's national leadership.{{sfn|Jackson|2011|p=22}} After a group of inebriated Somali women carried out a racist assault against a white woman, Rhea Page, in [[Leicester]] in June 2010, the EDL organised a protest rally in the city, attributing the attack to the supremacist attitude cultivated by Islam among its followers.{{sfn|Kassimeris|Jackson|2015|pp=177\u2013178}} When, in the [[Hyde, Greater Manchester|Hyde]] area of [[Greater Manchester]], a man called Daniel Stringer-Prince was assaulted by Asian youths, the EDL again organised a demonstration in that area against the Stringer-Price family's wishes. The EDL blamed the attack on Muslims, although the religious background of the youths had not been ascertained by police.{{sfn|Kassimeris|Jackson|2015|p=177}} In April 2011, the group held demonstrations in [[Blackburn]] in response to a number of [[hit and run]] incidents where Muslim drivers had hit non-Muslims; again, the EDL disregarded requests by the victim's families not to politicise the events.{{sfn|Jackson|2011|p=19}}\n\n[[File:English Defence League-2 (30 oktober 2010, Amsterdam).jpg|thumb|left|Branded EDL clothing listing the group's links with other organisations abroad]]\n\nIn the spring of 2011, the EDL launched a nationwide campaign titled \"No New Mosques\", which built upon earlier campaigns against mosque construction organised by various local divisions.{{sfn|Jackson|2011|p=24}} When a mosque was due to be built in [[West Bridgford]], an EDL organiser for the Nottingham area, Christopher Payne, and three associates placed a severed pig's head on a pole at the site, while the slogan \"No mosque here EDL Notts\" was spray-painted on the adjacent pavement.{{sfn|Jackson|2011|pp=22\u201323}} In April 2010, the group amassed a demonstration of 3000 supporters in [[Dudley]] to protest the construction of a new mosque, an issue that had already attracted local opposition.{{sfn|Allen|2013|p=193}} Prior to the event, a cross-party group of local councillors\u2014including members of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], and [[UK Independence Party]]\u2014issued a joint letter to the local press calling on the EDL to abandon its plans because of the detrimental impact they would have on community relations.{{sfn|Allen|2013|p=193}} Two months later, a group of EDL members occupied the roof of the abandoned building on the site of the proposed mosque, displaying a banner saying \"No to the burka\" and expressing intentions to play the Islamic call to prayer from there five times a day to alert locals to the [[noise pollution]] they would suffer when the mosque was built. Police swiftly removed the demonstrators.{{sfn|Allen|2013|p=193}} Dudley Council subsequently announced its intention to try and prevent further EDL demonstrations in the town, noting that the group's activities had cost the local council over \u00a31 million.{{sfn|Allen|2013|p=194}}\n\nThe EDL was aware that its demonstrations, which are often met by protests from anti-fascist groups, prove costly for local authorities.{{sfn|Allen|2011|p=289}} The [[Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council]] for instance stated that the EDL protest in [[Dudley]] had forced the council to spent over \u00a31 million of tax-payers money.{{sfn|Allen|2011|p=289}} To deal with an EDL protest in Leicester, the Leicestershire Police Force had to put on its largest operation in 25 years, bringing in 2000 police officers to manage the demonstration.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=29}} The EDL used this leverage to pressurise local councils into agreeing to some of its demands; in 2010 it issued a letter stating that any local councils that held Winter-themed festivities rather than explicitly Christmas-themed ones could \"have their town/city visited by the English Defence League throughout the following year\".{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2010|1p=31|2a1=Allen|2y=2011|2p=289|3a1=Jackson|3y=2011|3p=24}}\n\n===Violence===\n\n[[File:EDL attacking Big John's restaurant in Leicester (short version).ogv|thumb|Video of damage being caused to a restaurant in [[Leicester]].\nA supporter of the English Defence League was later convicted for his involvement in the attack, and admitted causing criminal damage worth \u00a31500.<ref name=\"leic12075785\">{{cite web |url= http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/Man-broke-window-EDL-demo/story-12075785-detail/story.html | title= Man broke window in EDL demo | work = Leicester Mercury | date = 23 March 2011 |accessdate=30 July 2011}}</ref>]]\n\nCopsey noted that \"it is hard to escape the conclusion that, on the ground, the EDL is a violent organisation.\"{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=30}} In various cases, EDL demonstrators have damaged Asian-owned businesses and property;{{sfnm|1a1=Trilling|1y=2012|1p=188|2a1=Kassimeris|2a2=Jackson|2y=2015|2p=172}} in October 2011, EDL members stormed and ransacked an [[Ahmadiyya]] Islamic bookstore in [[Sandwell]],{{sfn|Alessio|Meredith|2014|p=111}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halesowennews.co.uk/news/9309878.Mindless_EDL_thugs_storm_Muslim_exhibition_in_Cradley_Heath_market/ |title=Mindless EDL thugs storm Muslim exhibition in Cradley Heath market |publisher=|website=Halesowen News |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> and in August 2011 an EDL member was convicted for vandalising a mosque.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/edl-member-admits-mosque-attack-2340410.html | title =EDL member admits mosque attack |work=The Independent | location = UK  |date=19 August 2011 | accessdate =17 September 2011 | first=Tom | last=Wilkinson}}</ref> Demonstrations have also led to physical attacks on Asians themselves.{{sfn|Trilling|2012|p=188}} Not all targets of EDL violence have been Muslim; in a July 2010 demonstration in Dudley, EDL members attacked a Hindu temple.

One described how, at a protest, he attacked an Asian counter demonstrator: \"[I] hit this Paki in the face and he just looked so shocked. So I hit him again and that put him down, then we gave him a fucking good kicking.\" This EDL member added that he felt \"proud afterwards. It made me feel like I'd made a stand.\"{{sfn|Treadwell|Garland|2011|pp=629\u2013630}}\n\nTreadwell and Garland recorded accounts from various EDL members where they had carried out acts of racist violence on occasions outside those of EDL demonstrations. They for instance described the account of an 18 year old man from a White British working-class background who was a member of a local football firm and who reported that when drunk, he and two friends came upon \"a pyjama wearing Paki kid\" aged about 20. Robbie and his friends attacked the Asian youth, pushing him to the floor and kicking him repeatedly in the face. When questioned why he did this, Robbie explained that \"I guess I was pissed, but really, he was a Paki Muslim youth, he just deserved it\". He further explaining that a group of British Asian youth had similarly physically assaulted him when he was a school pupil, with his injuries necessitating hospitalisation.{{sfn|Treadwell|Garland|2011|pp=627\u2013628}} Meadowcroft and Meadow thus suggested that among the EDL, \"violence against the perceived enemies of England is legitimised and glorified and enhances the self-worth of the group members taking a stand against those enemies.\"{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=381}} Treadwell and Garland similarly reported that those EDL members engaging in violence repeatedly presented it as a heroic act.{{sfn|Treadwell|Garland|2011|p=631}}\n\n===Online activism===\n\nThe EDL established a significant online presence through which it spread its ideology and sought to mobilise supporters to attend its events.{{sfn|Cleland|Anderson|Aldridge-Deacon|2017|p=2}}\nThe EDL had an official website, but also made heavy use of social media platforms like Facebook and [[YouTube]] through which to promote its material.{{sfn|Brindle|2016|p=445}} In doing so, Copsey referred to the EDL as \"a child of the Facebook revolution\",{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=5}} noting that the website was \"a critical forum\" for the EDL in promoting its views.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=35}} In making use of social media, the EDL sought to bypass the mainstream media, which it regarded as being biased against it.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=51}} \nThese social media platforms are moderated by members of the EDL hierarchy, but these moderators do not appear to remove posts by supporters which advocated hatred and violence towards Muslims while blocking users who criticise the EDL and its ideology.{{sfn|Brindle|2016|pp=456\u2013457}} The use of Facebook also allowed the group to build momentum and expectancy among their members ahead of public events.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=20}} The EDL gained a total of 100,000 followers on Facebook, after which the Facebook corporation shut down the group's profile on the website.{{sfn|Cleland|Anderson|Aldridge-Deacon|2017|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nDistinguishing itself from political parties, the EDL did not produce leaflets expressing any political program,{{sfn|Kassimeris|Jackson|2015|p=176}} nor did it print a magazine or newsletter.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=20}}\nOn the ''EDL News'' section of its website it produced articles, commentary, and information on forthcoming events and campaigns, which were then linked to throughout its social media.{{sfn|Kassimeris|Jackson|2015|p=176}} A study of these articles looking at those produced up to February 2012 found that, of the 117 publicly available articles, 86 discussed Islam or Muslims.

leadership.{{sfn|Alessio|Meredith|2014|p=112}} After that duo left the group, it was reorganised around a committee leadership which was headed by a rotating chair.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=41}}\n\nThe EDL lacked a central regulatory structure through which to impose a uniform approach to strategy or maintain ideological purity throughout.{{sfnm|1a1=Winlow|1a2=Hall|1a3=Treadwell|1y=2017|1p=184|2a1=Brindle|2y=2016|2p=445}} It operated through a loose network of local divisions,{{sfn|Busher|2018|p=326}} each of which had a good deal of autonomy.{{sfn|Winlow|Hall|Treadwell|2017|p=184}} Winlow, Hall, and Treadwell found that most members liked the group's \"messy structure and imprecise goals\" and did not want to be part of a highly structured organisation under firm leadership.{{sfn|Winlow|Hall|Treadwell|2017|p=182}}\nThe EDL divided into at least ninety different divisions,{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2010|1p=20|2a1=Alessio|2a2=Meredith|2y=2014|2p=112}} some of which are based on locality and others on specialist groups.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=19}} These have included a women's division, Jewish division, Sikh division, Hindu division, and LGBT division.{{sfn|Alessio|Meredith|2014|p=112}} For a brief period it also had a disabled division,{{sfn|Allen|2011|p=287}} as well as a green division,{{sfn|Allen|2011|p=287}} and a soldiers' division.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=19}} These groups are designed to raise the profile of a particular social group within the EDL itself and helping the organisation to draw in recruits from sectors of society that would normally avoid membership in a far-right grouping, such as ethnic minorities and LGBT people.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|pp=20\u201321}} In its early years it also formed a youth division, the English Defence Youth, which was led by Joel Titus; after Titus received a [[Anti-social behaviour order|criminally-related anti-social behaviour order]] (CRASBO), preventing his further involvement in the EDL, the youth division became largely inactive.{{sfn|Jackson|2011|p=20}}\n\nThe local groups were organised into a series of nine areas: North West, North East, East Midlands, West Midlands, East Anglia, South West, South East, South East Central, and Greater London.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=19}} From the summer of 2010 onward, each of these had its own regional organiser.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2010|1p=19|2a1=Jackson|2y=2011|2p=21}} The EDL was heavily reliant on these grassroots networks and the initiative of local and regional leaders.{{sfn|Jackson|2011|p=5}} Some of the local divisions covered whole cities or counties while in other cases there could be more than one division representing a single postcode, in part due to personal disputes.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|pp=42\u201343}}\n\nBranches typically held their meeting in pubs with sympathetic owners, which are referred to as \"HQs\".{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|pp=15, 44}} Pilkington observed that these meetings always features alcohol consumption.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=44}} Such divisional meetings were infrequent and often poorly attended.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=43}} They were typically unstructured, lacking any formal agenda or the taking of minutes, and were mainly an opportunity for divisional organisers to inform members of their decisions.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=43}} Sometimes guest speakers were also invited to address the audience.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=43}} As well as these divisional meetings, the EDL divisions also held \"meet and greet\" events to attract new membership.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=43}} There was no system of official membership recognised through membership cards,{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=5}} and no membership fees.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2010|1p=20|2a1=Pilkington|2y=2016|2p=49}} The EDL accepted donations and local divisions sought to raise funds by selling merchandise and holding fundraising events such as barbeques.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=49}}\n\n===Demonstrations===\n\n{{main|List of English Defence League demonstrations}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = EDL activism has taken place across a range of more or less public and managed spaces.

In the 1930s, the [[British Union of Fascists]] marched through areas with high Jewish populations to intimidate and provoke them, while in the 1970s the National Front employed similar tactics in areas with large non-white communities, an approach also used in the 1980s and 1990s by the British National Party till being abandoned after 1999.{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=376}}\n\nIn 2011, Bartlett and Littler stated their view that the EDL's largest demonstration contained between 2000 and 3000 protesters.{{sfn|Bartlett|Littler|2011|p=4}}\nCopsey noted that the \"overwhelming majority\" of attendees at EDL demonstrations are \"young, white, working-class males\".{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=29}}\nAlthough EDL demonstrations have included people of colour, in general they remain overwhelmingly white.{{sfn|Richards|2013|p=183}} At events, many members sought to have their photograph taken with the few Sikhs who attended, thus seeking to bolster the idea that they were not personally racist.{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=384}} Copsey suggested that many Sikhs who were sympathetic to the EDL were nevertheless put off from attending rallies due to an awareness that many of the EDL's white members would not be able to differentiate between Sikhs and Muslims.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=23}}\nThe events were also numerically dominated by men, with relatively few women attending.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=30}}\nAt demonstrations, speeches typically focus on the perceived threat of Islamification, but also raise issues like the dangers of political correctness and the errors of the [[Left-wing politics|political left]].{{sfn|Busher|2018|p=329}}\nDuring demonstrations, the EDL have regularly been met with opposition from anti-fascist groups like [[Unite Against Fascism]],{{sfn|Braouezec|2016|p=644}} and sometimes also from Islamic groups.{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=379}} The clashes between the rival groups often resulted in violence and public disorder,{{sfnm|1a1=Kassimeris|1a2=Jackson|1y=2015|1p=171|2a1=Brindle|2y=2016|2p=445|3a1=Meadowcroft|3a2=Morrow|3y=2017|3p=375}} with the police seeking to keep the two apart.{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=379}}\n\n[[Image:English Defence League protest in Newcastle.jpg|thumb|left|[[Demonstration (people)|Street protest]] organised by the EDL in Newcastle, England. (The placard reads ''\"Shut down the Mosque Command and Control Centre.\"'')]]\n\nTo reach national events, local EDL groups often hired coaches to transport them to their destination;{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|pp=14, 181}} en route, they often displayed EDL flags from the coach windows.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=187}} The coach provided a space in which these members engaged in singing, banter, story-telling, and practical jokes.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=181}} As well as being protests, these demonstrations served as social events for EDL members,{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=383}} helping to forge a sense of solidarity and of the EDL as \"one big family\".{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=180}} At demonstrations, many members\u2014including those who may be too young to legally drink alcohol\u2014consume large quantities of alcohol.{{sfnm|1a1=Meadowcroft|1a2=Morrow|1y=2017|1p=383|2a1=Winlow|2a2=Hall|2a3=Treadwell|2y=2017|2p=7}} Many of these events begin and/or end at a pub, which is used as a meeting place.{{sfnm|1a1=Pilkington|1y=2016|1p=15|2a1=Meadowcroft|2a2=Morrow|2y=2017|2p=383}} Some members also take [[cocaine]] prior to attending demonstrations.{{sfnm|1a1=Pilkington|1y=2016|1p=181|2a1=Winlow|2a2=Hall|2a3=Treadwell|2y=2017|2p=149}}\n\nEDL demonstrations were typified by continuous chanting with aggressive slogans aimed at Muslims.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2010|1p=30|2a1=Meadowcroft|2a2=Morrow|2y=2017|2p=375}} Pilkington divided these chants into three types: those which were anti-Islam, those which were patriotic in referencing an English identity, and those which were identity affirming in making specific reference to the EDL itself.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=196}} Examples of the first category included \"Muslim bombers off our streets\",{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|pp=140, 185}} \"No surrender to the Taliban\",{{sfnm|1a1=Garland|1a2=Treadwell|1y=2010|1p=26|2a1=Meadowcroft|2a2=Morrow|2y=2017|2p=375}} \"Protect women, no to sharia\",{{sfn|Garland|Treadwell|2010|p=25}} \"If you wear a burqa you're a cunt\",{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=375}} \"You can stick your fucking Islam up your arse\",{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=140}} \"You can shove your fucking Allah up your arse\",{{sfnm|1a1=Garland|1a2=Treadwell|1y=2010|1p=32|2a1=Meadowcroft|2a2=Morrow|2y=2017|2p=375}} \"Allah is a paedo\",{{sfnm|1a1=Pilkington|1y=2016|1p=133|2a1=Busher|2y=2018|2p=329}} and \"Allah, Allah, who the fuck is Allah?\".{{sfnm|1a1=Pilkington|1y=2016|1p=140|2a1=Meadowcroft|2a2=Morrow|2y=2017|2p=375}} Examples of the second category include \"I'm England till I die\",{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=375}} \"We want our country back\",{{sfn|Garland|Treadwell|2010|p=25}} and \"Whose streets?

EDL\".{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=185}} When confronting counter-protesters from the UAF and other groups, EDL members often chanted \"You're not English anymore\".{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|pp=31, 197}} Alongside chants, the EDL often employed songs, including the UK national anthem \"[[God Save the Queen]]\", patriotic songs like \"Keep St George in my Heart, Keep me English\"\u2014sung to the tune of the hymn \"Give Me Joy in My Heart\"\u2014and the anti-Islam themed \"There were Ten Muslim Bombers in the Air\".{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=196}}\n\nAt the demonstrations, EDL members often displayed the English flag of St George as well as the British [[Union Jack]]; the Israeli and LGBT Pride flags were also often in attendance.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|pp=187\u2013188}} As with various older far-right street organisations like the Italian Squadristi or German [[Sturmabteilung]], the EDL had a \"street uniform\" that members wore in the form of wristbands, t-shirts, and hoodies bearing the group's logo.{{sfn|Alessio|Meredith|2014|p=108}} Many members also wore masks decorated with either the EDL logo or the St George's cross.{{sfn|Alessio|Meredith|2014|p=108}} Some also wore pig face masks or masks of figures whom they wished to ridicule, such as the Salafi jihadist leader [[Osama bin Laden]].{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=193}} The use of the hoodie has symbolic connections with anti-social behaviour and the stereotype of the [[chav]]; it was thus selected for its intimidating atmosphere and as a reassertion of working-class status.{{sfnm|1a1=Alessio|1a2=Meredith|1y=2014|1p=108|2a1=Pilkington|2y=2016|2p=191}} In wearing such a uniform, the EDL seek to construct a unified political identity.{{sfn|Alessio|Meredith|2014|p=109}} Wearing this material helps to cement individual's loyalty to the group, particularly as they are likely to experience disapproval from other members of the public while wearing it.{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=383}} Reflecting the place of football hooligans in the EDL, some of its male members wore expensive designer clothing to its rallies, most notably [[Fred Perry]] polo shirts, jeans or combat trousers, and [[Adidas]] trainers.{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=383}} A number of attendees also display EDL-themed tattoos.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=187}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Lager, cocaine, a bit of shouting and singing, the possibility of a punch-up, surrounded by friends and like-minded others - there was an air of adventure to proceedings, and some found all of this very attractive.\n| source=\u2014 Simon Winlow, Steve Hall, and James Treadwell on EDL demonstrations{{sfn|Winlow|Hall|Treadwell|2017|p=185}} \n| align = right\n| width = 25em\n}}\n\nThe police and local authorities initially allowed most EDL rallies to take place and did not often request banning orders.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=32}} In October 2010, [[West Yorkshire Police]] successfully requested a government ban on the EDL holding a rally in [[Bradford]], fearing that it would spark violent racial tensions akin to those [[2001 Bradford riots|which had taken place in 2001]].{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=32}} In October 2010, the [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] granted Leicester Police's request to ban a planned EDL march in that city.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=32}} By September 2011, over 600 arrests had been made in connection with EDL demonstrations and the policing costs were estimated to have exceeded \u00a310 million.{{sfn|Kassimeris|Jackson|2015|p=172}} In some cases, the majority of those arrested during a demonstration have been from the EDL; on other instances the majority of those arrested have been from groups protesting against the EDL.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=29}} After the group's August 2009 rally in Birmingham for example, in which it first reached national attention, a number of young Asian counter-protesters attacked several unrelated white youths they found in the city, leading the police to pursue the counter-protesters.{{sfn|Garland|Treadwell|2010|p=24}} Through her ethnographic fieldwork within the EDL, Pilkington found that more members felt that the group's tactics would be ineffective than deemed them effective; some even regarded them as counterproductive due to the presence of members who were drunk or who appeared idiotic by displaying the flag upside-down or placards with misspelled words.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=53}}  Although some EDL members expressed reservations about the violent tactics adopted by others, this was not considered sufficient to stop many of them from returning to further events.{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=380}}\n\n====Mobilising on local issues====\n\nIn various cases, the EDL mobilised around localised tensions between Islamic and non-Muslim communities. These were often organised by local divisions rather than by the group's national leadership.{{sfn|Jackson|2011|p=22}} After a group of inebriated Somali women carried out a racist assault against a white woman, Rhea Page, in [[Leicester]] in June 2010, the EDL organised a protest rally in the city, attributing the attack to the supremacist attitude cultivated by Islam among its followers.{{sfn|Kassimeris|Jackson|2015|pp=177\u2013178}} When, in the [[Hyde, Greater Manchester|Hyde]] area of [[Greater Manchester]], a man called Daniel Stringer-Prince was assaulted by Asian youths, the EDL again organised a demonstration in that area against the Stringer-Price family's wishes. The EDL blamed the attack on Muslims, although the religious background of the youths had not been ascertained by police.{{sfn|Kassimeris|Jackson|2015|p=177}} In April 2011, the group held demonstrations in [[Blackburn]] in response to a number of [[hit and run]] incidents where Muslim drivers had hit non-Muslims; again, the EDL disregarded requests by the victim's families not to politicise the events.{{sfn|Jackson|2011|p=19}}\n\n[[File:English Defence League-2 (30 oktober 2010, Amsterdam).jpg|thumb|left|Branded EDL clothing listing the group's links with other organisations abroad]]\n\nIn the spring of 2011, the EDL launched a nationwide campaign titled \"No New Mosques\", which built upon earlier campaigns against mosque construction organised by various local divisions.{{sfn|Jackson|2011|p=24}} When a mosque was due to be built in [[West Bridgford]], an EDL organiser for the Nottingham area, Christopher Payne, and three associates placed a severed pig's head on a pole at the site, while the slogan \"No mosque here EDL Notts\" was spray-painted on the adjacent pavement.{{sfn|Jackson|2011|pp=22\u201323}} In April 2010, the group amassed a demonstration of 3000 supporters in [[Dudley]] to protest the construction of a new mosque, an issue that had already attracted local opposition.{{sfn|Allen|2013|p=193}} Prior to the event, a cross-party group of local councillors\u2014including members of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], and [[UK Independence Party]]\u2014issued a joint letter to the local press calling on the EDL to abandon its plans because of the detrimental impact they would have on community relations.{{sfn|Allen|2013|p=193}} Two months later, a group of EDL members occupied the roof of the abandoned building on the site of the proposed mosque, displaying a banner saying \"No to the burka\" and expressing intentions to play the Islamic call to prayer from there five times a day to alert locals to the [[noise pollution]] they would suffer when the mosque was built. Police swiftly removed the demonstrators.{{sfn|Allen|2013|p=193}} Dudley Council subsequently announced its intention to try and prevent further EDL demonstrations in the town, noting that the group's activities had cost the local council over \u00a31 million.{{sfn|Allen|2013|p=194}}\n\nThe EDL was aware that its demonstrations, which are often met by protests from anti-fascist groups, prove costly for local authorities.{{sfn|Allen|2011|p=289}} The [[Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council]] for instance stated that the EDL protest in [[Dudley]] had forced the council to spent over \u00a31 million of tax-payers money.{{sfn|Allen|2011|p=289}} To deal with an EDL protest in Leicester, the Leicestershire Police Force had to put on its largest operation in 25 years, bringing in 2000 police officers to manage the demonstration.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=29}} The EDL used this leverage to pressurise local councils into agreeing to some of its demands; in 2010 it issued a letter stating that any local councils that held Winter-themed festivities rather than explicitly Christmas-themed ones could \"have their town/city visited by the English Defence League throughout the following year\".{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2010|1p=31|2a1=Allen|2y=2011|2p=289|3a1=Jackson|3y=2011|3p=24}}\n\n===Violence===\n\n[[File:EDL attacking Big John's restaurant in Leicester (short version).ogv|thumb|Video of damage being caused to a restaurant in [[Leicester]].\nA supporter of the English Defence League was later convicted for his involvement in the attack, and admitted causing criminal damage worth \u00a31500.<ref name=\"leic12075785\">{{cite web |url= http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/Man-broke-window-EDL-demo/story-12075785-detail/story.html | title= Man broke window in EDL demo | work = Leicester Mercury | date = 23 March 2011 |accessdate=30 July 2011}}</ref>]]\n\nCopsey noted that \"it is hard to escape the conclusion that, on the ground, the EDL is a violent organisation.\"{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=30}} In various cases, EDL demonstrators have damaged Asian-owned businesses and property;{{sfnm|1a1=Trilling|1y=2012|1p=188|2a1=Kassimeris|2a2=Jackson|2y=2015|2p=172}} in October 2011, EDL members stormed and ransacked an [[Ahmadiyya]] Islamic bookstore in [[Sandwell]],{{sfn|Alessio|Meredith|2014|p=111}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halesowennews.co.uk/news/9309878.Mindless_EDL_thugs_storm_Muslim_exhibition_in_Cradley_Heath_market/ |title=Mindless EDL thugs storm Muslim exhibition in Cradley Heath market |publisher=|website=Halesowen News |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> and in August 2011 an EDL member was convicted for vandalising a mosque.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/edl-member-admits-mosque-attack-2340410.html | title =EDL member admits mosque attack |work=The Independent | location = UK  |date=19 August 2011 | accessdate =17 September 2011 | first=Tom | last=Wilkinson}}</ref> Demonstrations have also led to physical attacks on Asians themselves.{{sfn|Trilling|2012|p=188}} Not all targets of EDL violence have been Muslim; in a July 2010 demonstration in Dudley, EDL members attacked a Hindu temple.

It made me feel like I'd made a stand.\"{{sfn|Treadwell|Garland|2011|pp=629\u2013630}}\n\nTreadwell and Garland recorded accounts from various EDL members where they had carried out acts of racist violence on occasions outside those of EDL demonstrations. They for instance described the account of an 18 year old man from a White British working-class background who was a member of a local football firm and who reported that when drunk, he and two friends came upon \"a pyjama wearing Paki kid\" aged about 20. Robbie and his friends attacked the Asian youth, pushing him to the floor and kicking him repeatedly in the face. When questioned why he did this, Robbie explained that \"I guess I was pissed, but really, he was a Paki Muslim youth, he just deserved it\". He further explaining that a group of British Asian youth had similarly physically assaulted him when he was a school pupil, with his injuries necessitating hospitalisation.{{sfn|Treadwell|Garland|2011|pp=627\u2013628}} Meadowcroft and Meadow thus suggested that among the EDL, \"violence against the perceived enemies of England is legitimised and glorified and enhances the self-worth of the group members taking a stand against those enemies.\"{{sfn|Meadowcroft|Morrow|2017|p=381}} Treadwell and Garland similarly reported that those EDL members engaging in violence repeatedly presented it as a heroic act.{{sfn|Treadwell|Garland|2011|p=631}}\n\n===Online activism===\n\nThe EDL established a significant online presence through which it spread its ideology and sought to mobilise supporters to attend its events.{{sfn|Cleland|Anderson|Aldridge-Deacon|2017|p=2}}\nThe EDL had an official website, but also made heavy use of social media platforms like Facebook and [[YouTube]] through which to promote its material.{{sfn|Brindle|2016|p=445}} In doing so, Copsey referred to the EDL as \"a child of the Facebook revolution\",{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=5}} noting that the website was \"a critical forum\" for the EDL in promoting its views.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=35}} In making use of social media, the EDL sought to bypass the mainstream media, which it regarded as being biased against it.{{sfn|Pilkington|2016|p=51}} \nThese social media platforms are moderated by members of the EDL hierarchy, but these moderators do not appear to remove posts by supporters which advocated hatred and violence towards Muslims while blocking users who criticise the EDL and its ideology.{{sfn|Brindle|2016|pp=456\u2013457}} The use of Facebook also allowed the group to build momentum and expectancy among their members ahead of public events.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=20}} The EDL gained a total of 100,000 followers on Facebook, after which the Facebook corporation shut down the group's profile on the website.{{sfn|Cleland|Anderson|Aldridge-Deacon|2017|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nDistinguishing itself from political parties, the EDL did not produce leaflets expressing any political program,{{sfn|Kassimeris|Jackson|2015|p=176}} nor did it print a magazine or newsletter.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=20}}\nOn the ''EDL News'' section of its website it produced articles, commentary, and information on forthcoming events and campaigns, which were then linked to throughout its social media.{{sfn|Kassimeris|Jackson|2015|p=176}} A study of these articles looking at those produced up to February 2012 found that, of the 117 publicly available articles, 86 discussed Islam or Muslims. Of these, 55.8% discussed extremism, 33.7% discussed terrorism, 31.4% discussed other violence, 24.4% discussed segregationary tendencies, 20.9% discussed supremacism, 20.9% discussed misogyny, and 18.6% described child grooming.{{sfn|Kassimeris|Jackson|2015|p=176}}\n\nThe EDL also used its website as a venue through which to sell its branded merchandise, which included hoodies, t-shirts, caps, pin badges, and face masks.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=20}} Following internal allegations that EDL members were taking the money from this for themselves rather than using it for the organisation, the EDL pulled merchandise from its website in September 2010.{{sfn|Copsey|2010|p=20}} It has also sold its merchandise on the auction website [[eBay]].{{sfn|Jackson|2011|p=21}} The EDL has also used the internet and in particular social media to broadcast their activities, such as the placing of severed pig heads outside mosques, the burning of copies of the Qur'an, or footage from demonstrations.{{sfn|Jackson|2011|p=23}}\n\n===International and domestic links===\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Despite its many unique features, the EDL is nonetheless representative of a wider political change that has swept across Europe over the past fifteen years. The combination of a deeply anti\u2010Muslim political agenda and populist ultrapatriotism, powered by grass\u2010roots critiques of mainstream politics, has been a core component of\nthe 'new far right' in Europe.

He is portrayed by [[Hugo Weaving]] in the films and voiced by [[Christopher Corey Smith]] in ''[[The Matrix: Path of Neo]]''. \n\nIn 2008, Agent Smith was selected by ''[[Empire Magazine]]'' as the 69th Greatest Movie Character of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/100-greatest-movie-characters/default.asp?c=84 |title=The 100 Greatest Movie Characters&#124; 84.

To this end, Smith and his fellow Agents possess a number of superhuman attributes from their ability to bend the rules of the Matrix. Smith manifests his physical form by [[spirit possession|inhabiting and overwriting]] the simulated [[Human body|body]] of a human wired into the Matrix; by moving from body to body, he can reform himself if he is \"killed\" (which only kills the host body) and appear virtually anywhere. He can overcome the limitations of gravity and the human body, giving him speed and strength sufficient to [[bullet time|dodge bullets flawlessly]], [[Punch (combat)|punch]] through concrete with his bare hands, and jump impossible distances. He and other Agents wear dark green business suits with matching neckties, white dress shirts, and sunglasses with rectangular lenses. They use earpiece radios that allow them to communicate with each other instantaneously and perceive the actions of other humans wired into the Matrix via a type of shared consciousness. When Smith removes his earpiece during the first film, he is left unaware of the attack on the building in which he is holding Morpheus. Smith is armed in the first film with the [[Desert Eagle]], chambered for high-caliber [[.50 Action Express|.50 AE]] ammunition, as is standard with all Agents within the Matrix.\n\nAt the end of the first film, Smith appears to have been deleted by Neo. However, in the sequels, Smith is revealed to have been linked to Neo, which enabled him to resist being sent to the Source - the Machines' mainframe, where obsolete or malfunctioning programs are deleted. No longer an Agent, Smith is liberated from the Machines' control and exists as a renegade program that manifests himself akin to a self-replicating [[computer virus]] compared to his original Agent-based ability to inhabit a single body wired into the Matrix. Smith gains the power to copy his physical form onto any entity in the Matrix by phasing his hand into their body and spreading a black liquid that transforms them into a copy of himself, resulting in an ever-growing army of Smiths [[group mind (science fiction)|connected by a single consciousness]]. By copying himself onto a human [[redpill]] in the process of disconnecting from the Matrix, Smith overwrites their consciousness and takes control of their body in the real world. This is seen when Smith takes over [[Bane (The Matrix)|Bane]]'s body in ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''; however, he is repelled when he attempts to do the same to [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] and [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]. Smith's real power comes from his ability to absorb memories and powers from his victims, human and program alike, culminating in him taking over the [[Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]] and fighting Neo in the final battle of the Matrix series. Neo allows himself to be overwritten during the battle, thus giving the Machines an opportunity to delete Smith and return the Matrix and its inhabitants to normal.\n\n==Character history==\n===''The Matrix''===\nIn the first film, Smith is one of the three Agents sent to deal with Morpheus. After Neo is successfully removed from the Matrix, Smith arranges Morpheus' capture by bribing [[Cypher (The Matrix)|Cypher]], a disillusioned member of Morpheus' crew, with reintegration into The Matrix. When Neo manages to free Morpheus, Smith and his fellow Agents engage in a lengthy cross-town chase. He and Neo fight, with Smith dominating most of the fight. Shortly after Neo escapes the fight, Smith guns him down. Neo revives, realizes his power as the One, and enters Smith, to destroy him from within.\n\n===''The Matrix Reloaded''===\nAs a result of his contact with Neo from the first film, Smith is \"unplugged\" in the second film, no longer an Agent of the system but a \"free man\". This is signified by the lack of an earpiece, which he sends to Neo in an envelope as a message early in the film. His appearance has changed in the second film as well; his sunglasses now have an angular shape different from the Agents' oblong lenses, approximating the shape of the ones Neo wears. His suit and tie re now jet black, as opposed to the dark green tint from the first film. He still possesses the abilities of an Agent, but instead of being able to jump from one human to another, he is able to copy himself over any human or program in the Matrix through direct contact; this includes humans wired into the Matrix, non-Agent programs with human forms, [[redpill]]s, and other Agents. Smith retains the memories and abilities, if any, of the one over which he copies himself. This ability is much like how a virus replicates, creating an ironic contrast with the first film, where Smith likens humanity to a virus.\n\nHe makes the claim that Neo has set him free. However, he believes there is an unseen purpose that still binds him to Neo. He tries to copy his programming onto Neo, but when this fails, he and dozens of his clones attack him, forcing Neo to flee. Later, he and his clones try to stop Neo from reaching the machine mainframe, without success.\n\nSmith copies himself onto Bane ([[Ian Bliss]]), a crew member of the [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] hovercraft ''Caduceus''. While waiting to leave the Matrix with a message from [[Oracle (The Matrix)|The Oracle]], Bane is attacked and overwritten by Smith, who then takes control of his body in the real world. Smith tests his control over the body by making Bane cut his own arm, in preparation for an assassination attempt on Neo that he quickly abandons. He later sabotages the Zion fleet's defense of the city by triggering one ship's [[electromagnetic pulse]] weapon too early, knocking out the other ships and allowing the Sentinels to overrun them.\n\n===''The Matrix Revolutions''===\n[[File:Smithposter.jpg|thumb|upright|Movie poster for ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', featuring some of the numerous copies of Smith]]\n\nBy the start of the third film, Smith has managed to copy himself over nearly every humanoid in the Matrix, giving him complete control over the \"Core Network\" (the underlying foundation of the inner workings of the Matrix), thus rendering him immutable by even the Machines themselves. The Oracle explains to Neo that he and Smith have become equal in power and that Smith is Neo's negative, a result of the Matrix's equation trying to balance itself. She tells Neo that Smith will destroy both the Matrix and the real world unless he is stopped. Smith soon assimilates the Oracle, gaining her power of [[foresight (psychology)|foresight]], or [[omniscience]], and later manifests reality-bending powers equivalent to Neo's, such as the ability to fly. Meanwhile, in the real world, Bane (now under Smith's control) stows away on a ship being used by Neo and Trinity and tries to kill them both. Neo is blinded in the fight, but discovers that he can now sense Smith's essence acutely enough to land a blow that kills Bane.\n\nNear the climax of the film, Neo offers a deal with the Machines to get rid of Smith in exchange for Zion's safety, warning them that Smith is beyond their control and will eventually spread to the machine city, which will result in destruction of both mankind and machines. Knowing that Neo is right, the Machines agree to his terms and command all Sentinels attacking Zion to stand down and wait for orders. They later give Neo a connection to enter the Matrix to stop Smith on their behalf. Although the Matrix is now populated exclusively by Smith and his clones, the Smith that has obtained the Oracle's powers battles Neo alone; as he explains, he has foreseen his victory, and has no need for the help of his copies. The two are almost evenly matched as the fight begins, though Neo's combat abilities seem arguably superior to that of Smith, the latter attacking more out of brute force, rather than the technical skill he displayed in the first film. This lasts, until Neo is able to punch Smith strongly enough to slam him into the street at least 20&nbsp;ft away. As the fight continues, however, it becomes clear that Neo cannot win with his finite stamina against the tireless Smith, who begins to dominate Neo in the fight; by the end of the fight, he is able to brutally beat Neo into near defeat. In the midst of this battle, Smith explains to Neo his final [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] revelation: \"It was your life that taught me the purpose of all life. The purpose of life is to end.\"\n\nWhen Neo is near defeat, Smith demands to know why he continues to fight despite knowing he cannot win. Neo calmly responds, \"Because I choose to\" and is savagely pummeled by the enraged Smith as a result. Suddenly recognizing the scene from his [[prophecy]], Smith is compelled to deliver the line he said in it: \"I say.... Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo.\" His own words confuse and frighten him. Neo realizes that he cannot overpower Smith and allows himself to be assimilated. Because Agent Smith has deleted the anomaly (Neo), he no longer has a purpose and he must also be deleted. Smith is now directly connected to the Source, the machines are able to destroy all copies of his programming and reboot the Matrix without errors. The process does kill Neo, but does also destroy Smith. Neo's body is carried away by the machines, and an uncertain peace is established between Zion and the machine world.\n\n===''The Matrix Online''===\nDespite his destruction at the end of the film series, Agent Smith (or at least the remnants of his programming) managed to return and made several appearances inside the movie's official continuation, the [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[The Matrix Online]]''.\n\nThe first infection was noted in Machine mission controller Agent Gray, whose background information confirms that he was overwritten by Smith at some point during the timeline of the second and third films. This infection had somehow survived the reboot at the end of the third film and rose to the surface once again during chapter 1.2, The Hunt For Morpheus. The Agent, in both a storyline related mission and live event, showed signs of uncharacteristic speech and emotion and eventually led an assault against Zionist redpills declaring 'their stench unbearable any longer'. As a result of his actions the agent was apprehended by his fellow system representatives and scheduled for a 'thorough code cleansing'. He has shown no signs of direct infection since.   \n    \nMachine liaison officer DifferenceEngine, following a similar scenario to that of the previous Agent Gray infection, also took on the dialect and emotional characteristics of the famous exile agent. Instead of attacking redpills, this instance insisted on finding 'Mr. Anderson'. In the end, the human/machine head relations liaison, Agent Pace, was made aware of the program's infection and subsequent crusade; she proceeded to lock down his RSI and return his program to the Source for analysis. His subsequent fate is unknown.\n\nThe third victim of infection was the notorious bluepill Shane Black. This man was an unfortunate victim of the Smith Virus who, once infected, gained the ability to spread the code to others. This quickly led to a small scale outbreak, with several more bluepills becoming infected and joining forces in their hunt for power. He and the other infected were eventually cleansed and returned to their bluepill lives. Shane Black's troubles continued, as he was one of the bluepills recorded to have first witnessed Unlimited redpills practising their newfound powers at the Uriah wharf. This triggered a resurgence of the memories formed during his Smith infection and he soon became volatile and insane. He is reported to have been mercifully killed shortly afterwards.\n\nThe most recent appearance of the Smith virus was during the third anniversary events. The virus manifested itself in the form of black-suited men (although they lacked the distinct likeness of Smith). As redpills began to fight back using specialist code from the Oracle, the virus vanished suddenly, stating that he had obtained a new and more dangerous form. The nature of this form was never revealed. <!--The Matrix Online has closed, so all open storylines will indefinitely remain unresolved.-->\n\n===''The Matrix: Path of Neo''===\n''[[The Matrix: Path of Neo]]'', a video game covering the events of the entire film trilogy, features a different ending than that shown in ''The Matrix Revolutions'', with a new final boss: the ''MegaSmith''. The MegaSmith was used for gameplay reasons, because though the Wachowskis thought the [[martyr]] approach suitable for film, they also believed that in an interactive medium such as a video game (based upon the successful completion of goals), this would not work. So, this character was created to be the more appropriate \"final boss\" of ''Path of Neo'', with the final battle described by the siblings as \"A little [[Hulk]] versus [[Galactus]] action\". The MegaSmith is composed of destroyed buildings, cars, and parts of the road, with the \"spectator Smiths\" standing around the crater and in the streets acting as the MegaSmith's muscles, resulting in Smith not only becoming the city's people, but the city itself.\n\nAfter Neo knocks Smith into the crater in the level \"Aerial Battle\", Smith is sent flying through the ground and up through the street. As Neo relaxes, the surrounding Smiths walk away from the crater. Neo gets out of the crater, and dodges a car which flies through the air and lands in a pile of debris. Neo looks on as Smiths tear up chunks of the road and throw cars into this pile. A truck then speeds into a building and blows it up. Smiths can be seen holding the debris together as it takes on a thirty-story tall humanoid form which is then struck by lightning, powering it up. Neo flies up to watch as the giant humanoid lowers its head onto its shoulders. The giant Smith then pulls a pair of giant Smith Shades from a billboard and puts them on. As an interesting aside, the glasses on the billboard are the same ones Agent Smith wore in the first Matrix film, with the curved nose bar, but when the MegaSmith actually puts them on, they become the ones Agent Smith wears in ''The Matrix Reloaded'' and in ''Revolutions''.\n\nAfter the fight\u2014consisting of Neo dodging blows and building up power to launch more powerful assaults at MegaSmith, damaging one arm and creating a large hole in his chest\u2014Neo flies straight into MegaSmith's mouth, causing the Smiths throughout the Matrix to overload and explode. The player is then shown a short scene from ''The Matrix: Revolutions'' of the streets shining with light emanating from the destroyed Smiths.\n\n===''The Lego Batman Movie'' (2017)===\nAgent Smith briefly appears in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' as one of the captives of the [[Phantom Zone]]. He and his clones appear surveilling [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'s vandalized Wayne Island, and later appear as one of the multiple enemies attacking the heroes. Smith's clones also appear as enemies in the ''Lego Batman Movie'' story pack for ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'', adapting their role in the film.\n\nHis voice actor was uncredited.\n\n==Personality==\nFrom the start it is evident that Agent Smith is significantly stronger, smarter, and more individualistic than other Agents. While other agents rarely act without consulting each other via their earpieces, to the point where they often finish each other's sentences, Smith is usually the one giving orders or using his earpiece to gather information for his own ends. Smith also appears to be the leader of other Agents in the first film, as he has the authority to launch Sentinel attacks in the real world. As with other Agents, Smith generally approaches problems through a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] point of view but, if necessary, will also act with brute force and apparent rage, especially when provoked by Neo.\n\nThe earpieces represent some form of control mechanism by the machines. It is notable that when he is interrogating Morpheus, he sends the other agents from the room, then removes his earpiece, releasing himself from the link to the machines before expressing his opinion of humanity. Early in the second film, Smith's earpiece is sent to Neo in an envelope as a message from Smith, representing Smith's newfound freedom.\n\nAgent Smith complains to Morpheus that the Matrix and its inhabitants smell disgusting, \"if there is such a thing [as smell]\". Smith has an open hatred of humans and their weakness of the flesh. He compares humanity to a [[virus]]; a disease organism that uncontrollably replicates and would inevitably destroy their environment were it not for the machine intelligences keeping them in check. Ironically, Smith eventually becomes a computer virus, multiplying until he has overrun the entire Matrix.\n\nAt the same time, Smith develops an animosity towards the Matrix itself, feeling that he is as much a prisoner of it as the humans he is tasked with controlling. He later develops an immense and increasingly open desire for the destruction of both mankind and machines.\n\nHe was also shown to be a [[nihilism|nihilist]], which eventually culminates in his statement that the purpose of life is to end, and crediting Neo's life for his determining this.<ref>''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]''<br>'''Agent Smith:''' I must thank you [Neo]. After all, it was your life that taught me the purpose of all life. The purpose of life is to ''end.''</ref> During his final showdown with Neo, Smith angrily dismisses causes such as freedom, truth, peace, and love as simply human attempts to justify a meaningless and purposeless existence, and is completely unable to comprehend why Neo continues to fight him despite the knowledge that he cannot win.<ref>''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]''<br>'''Agent Smith:''' Why, Mr. Anderson? Why, why? Why do you do it? Why? Why get up? Why keep fighting? Do you believe you're fighting for something, for more than your survival? Can you tell me what it is, do you even know? Is it freedom or truth, perhaps peace - could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Anderson, vagaries of perception. Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose! And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself. Although, only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love. You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson, you must know it by now! You can't win, it's pointless to keep fighting! Why, Mr. Anderson, why?! why do you persist?! / '''Neo:''' Because I choose to.</ref>\n\nThe [[Wachowskis]] have commented that Smith's gradual humanization throughout ''The Matrix'' is a process intended to mirror and balance Neo's own increasing power and understanding of the machine world.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nA writer at ''The Guardian'' commented that Smith seems to enjoy his job too much.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/09/hugo-weaving-the-matrix-agent-smith-why-id-like-to-be</ref>\n\n==Portrayal==\nFrench actor [[Jean Reno]] was originally offered the role of Agent Smith in ''The Matrix'', but he declined as he was at one point of his career in which he didn't want to leave his native [[France]], unwilling to move to [[Australia]] for a four-and-a-half months shooting. [[Hugo Weaving]] was ultimately cast as Smith.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/reno-said-no-to-the-matrix_12_05_2006|title=Reno Said No To ''The Matrix''|author=WENN|magazine=[[Contactmusic.com]]|date=May 12, 2006|accessdate=February 3, 2020}}</ref> According to Weaving, he enjoyed playing the character because it amused him. He went to develop a neutral accent but with more specific character for the role. He wanted Smith to sound neither human nor robotic. He also said that [[The Wachowskis]]' voices influenced his voice in the film. When filming for ''The Matrix'' began, Weaving mentioned that he was excited to be a part of something that would extend him.<ref name = \"Interrogation Room\">{{cite AV media| people =Oreck, Josh (Director); Wachowski, Larry; Matthies, Eric (Producers) | title =[[The Matrix Revisited]] | section = Interrogation Room | url = | medium =DVD | publisher = [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros.

Agents wear rectangular sunglasses, dark green business suits and neckties, and earpiece radios; after Smith loses his status as an Agent, his suit and tie turn black, his sunglasses take on an angled contour that approximates the rounded shape of the ones Neo wears, and he removes his earpiece and sends it to Neo. In contrast to the other Agents who show apathy toward the human race, Smith harbors an acute disgust with humanity. In the first film, he expresses a desire to leave the Matrix to escape its repulsive taint, and reasons that with Zion destroyed, his services will no longer be required, allowing him in some sense to 'leave' the Matrix. This at least partially explains his extreme antagonism towards Neo, who fights relentlessly to save Zion.\n\nOther Agents have common [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] names like [[Brown (surname)|Brown]], [[Jones (surname)|Jones]], and [[Thompson (surname)|Thompson]]. It was mentioned in the Philosopher Commentary on the DVD collection that the names of [[Smith (surname)|Smith]], Brown, and Jones may be endemic to the system itself, demonstrating a very \"robotic\" mindset on the part of the Machines.\n\nNeo's solitary role as the One is contrasted by Smith, who, by replicating himself, becomes \"the many\". When Neo asks the [[Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]] about Smith, the Oracle explains that Smith is Neo's opposite and his negative, the result of the Matrix's governing equations trying to balance themselves.\n\nUnlike the other characters in ''The Matrix'', Smith almost always refers to Neo as \"Mr. Anderson\". He calls him \"Neo\" only once in each part of the trilogy: the first time when he is interviewing Neo about his double life, the second when he is dropping off his earpiece for Neo, and the third when he is repeating a line of his vision to Neo.\n\nWeaving said of the film series in 2003 that it was always going to be a trilogy, and that as Neo's nemesis, Smith was always going to be there, describing Smith as \"more of a free agent\" later on in the series.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Spelling|first1=Ian|title=Lord of the trilogies|work=Reading Eagle|date=7 June 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\nChristopher Borrelli praised the writing of Smith, noting that the character \"had all the good lines\", and praising Weaving's portrayal of the character as showing \"refreshingly nihilistic wit\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Borrelli|first1=Christopher|title=Movie review: The Matrix Revolutions|date=4 November 2003|work=The Toledo Blade}}</ref>\n\nThe character has been described as a 1950s \"organization man\", like Sergeant [[Joe Friday]] from ''[[Dragnet (franchise)|Dragnet]]''.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Kapell|editor1-first=Matthew|editor2-last=Doty|editor2-first=William G.|title=Jacking in to the Matrix|date=2006|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=9780826419095|page=66}}</ref>\n\nAs a nod to the fact that both characters are portrayed by Hugo Weaving, a [[Lego]] incarnation of Smith appears as an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] in a cutscene from ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings (video game)|Lego: The Lord of the Rings]]'' when [[Frodo Baggins]] is introduced to [[Elrond]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Men in black]]\n* [[Simulated reality]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote|The Matrix}}\n\n{{Matrix}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Smith, Agent}}\n[[Category:Fictional artificial intelligences]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1999]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can duplicate themselves]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with spirit possession or body swapping abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional computer viruses]]\n[[Category:Fictional government agents]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional superorganisms]]\n[[Category:Fictional super soldiers]]\n[[Category:Martial artists characters in films]]\n[[Category:Science fiction film characters]]\n[[Category:The Matrix (franchise) characters]]\n[[Category:Advertising characters]]\n[[Category:Male film villains]] \n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Action film villains]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=September 2015}}\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = black\n| name        = Agent Smith\n| series      = [[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]\n| image       = Agent Smith (The Matrix series character).jpg\n| image_size  = \n| caption     = Hugo Weaving portraying Agent Smith\n| first       = ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999)\n| last               = ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' (2017)\n| creator     = [[The Wachowskis]]\n| portrayer   = [[Hugo Weaving]]<br>[[Ian Bliss]] {{small|(human form)}}\n| voice       = [[Christopher Corey Smith]]\n| nickname    = \n| alias       = \n| species     = Computer program (formerly), Virus, Human (while possessing Bane) \n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agent]], later [[computer virus|virus]]\n| title       = \n| family      = \n| spouse      = \n| children    = \n| relatives   = \n| religion    = \n| nationality = \n}}\n\n'''Agent Smith''' is a fictional character and the main [[antagonist]] of [[The Matrix (franchise)|''The Matrix'' trilogy]].

When Smith removes his earpiece during the first film, he is left unaware of the attack on the building in which he is holding Morpheus. Smith is armed in the first film with the [[Desert Eagle]], chambered for high-caliber [[.50 Action Express|.50 AE]] ammunition, as is standard with all Agents within the Matrix.\n\nAt the end of the first film, Smith appears to have been deleted by Neo. However, in the sequels, Smith is revealed to have been linked to Neo, which enabled him to resist being sent to the Source - the Machines' mainframe, where obsolete or malfunctioning programs are deleted. No longer an Agent, Smith is liberated from the Machines' control and exists as a renegade program that manifests himself akin to a self-replicating [[computer virus]] compared to his original Agent-based ability to inhabit a single body wired into the Matrix. Smith gains the power to copy his physical form onto any entity in the Matrix by phasing his hand into their body and spreading a black liquid that transforms them into a copy of himself, resulting in an ever-growing army of Smiths [[group mind (science fiction)|connected by a single consciousness]]. By copying himself onto a human [[redpill]] in the process of disconnecting from the Matrix, Smith overwrites their consciousness and takes control of their body in the real world. This is seen when Smith takes over [[Bane (The Matrix)|Bane]]'s body in ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''; however, he is repelled when he attempts to do the same to [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] and [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]. Smith's real power comes from his ability to absorb memories and powers from his victims, human and program alike, culminating in him taking over the [[Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]] and fighting Neo in the final battle of the Matrix series. Neo allows himself to be overwritten during the battle, thus giving the Machines an opportunity to delete Smith and return the Matrix and its inhabitants to normal.\n\n==Character history==\n===''The Matrix''===\nIn the first film, Smith is one of the three Agents sent to deal with Morpheus. After Neo is successfully removed from the Matrix, Smith arranges Morpheus' capture by bribing [[Cypher (The Matrix)|Cypher]], a disillusioned member of Morpheus' crew, with reintegration into The Matrix. When Neo manages to free Morpheus, Smith and his fellow Agents engage in a lengthy cross-town chase. He and Neo fight, with Smith dominating most of the fight. Shortly after Neo escapes the fight, Smith guns him down. Neo revives, realizes his power as the One, and enters Smith, to destroy him from within.\n\n===''The Matrix Reloaded''===\nAs a result of his contact with Neo from the first film, Smith is \"unplugged\" in the second film, no longer an Agent of the system but a \"free man\". This is signified by the lack of an earpiece, which he sends to Neo in an envelope as a message early in the film. His appearance has changed in the second film as well; his sunglasses now have an angular shape different from the Agents' oblong lenses, approximating the shape of the ones Neo wears. His suit and tie re now jet black, as opposed to the dark green tint from the first film. He still possesses the abilities of an Agent, but instead of being able to jump from one human to another, he is able to copy himself over any human or program in the Matrix through direct contact; this includes humans wired into the Matrix, non-Agent programs with human forms, [[redpill]]s, and other Agents. Smith retains the memories and abilities, if any, of the one over which he copies himself. This ability is much like how a virus replicates, creating an ironic contrast with the first film, where Smith likens humanity to a virus.\n\nHe makes the claim that Neo has set him free. However, he believes there is an unseen purpose that still binds him to Neo. He tries to copy his programming onto Neo, but when this fails, he and dozens of his clones attack him, forcing Neo to flee. Later, he and his clones try to stop Neo from reaching the machine mainframe, without success.\n\nSmith copies himself onto Bane ([[Ian Bliss]]), a crew member of the [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] hovercraft ''Caduceus''. While waiting to leave the Matrix with a message from [[Oracle (The Matrix)|The Oracle]], Bane is attacked and overwritten by Smith, who then takes control of his body in the real world. Smith tests his control over the body by making Bane cut his own arm, in preparation for an assassination attempt on Neo that he quickly abandons. He later sabotages the Zion fleet's defense of the city by triggering one ship's [[electromagnetic pulse]] weapon too early, knocking out the other ships and allowing the Sentinels to overrun them.\n\n===''The Matrix Revolutions''===\n[[File:Smithposter.jpg|thumb|upright|Movie poster for ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', featuring some of the numerous copies of Smith]]\n\nBy the start of the third film, Smith has managed to copy himself over nearly every humanoid in the Matrix, giving him complete control over the \"Core Network\" (the underlying foundation of the inner workings of the Matrix), thus rendering him immutable by even the Machines themselves. The Oracle explains to Neo that he and Smith have become equal in power and that Smith is Neo's negative, a result of the Matrix's equation trying to balance itself. She tells Neo that Smith will destroy both the Matrix and the real world unless he is stopped. Smith soon assimilates the Oracle, gaining her power of [[foresight (psychology)|foresight]], or [[omniscience]], and later manifests reality-bending powers equivalent to Neo's, such as the ability to fly. Meanwhile, in the real world, Bane (now under Smith's control) stows away on a ship being used by Neo and Trinity and tries to kill them both. Neo is blinded in the fight, but discovers that he can now sense Smith's essence acutely enough to land a blow that kills Bane.\n\nNear the climax of the film, Neo offers a deal with the Machines to get rid of Smith in exchange for Zion's safety, warning them that Smith is beyond their control and will eventually spread to the machine city, which will result in destruction of both mankind and machines. Knowing that Neo is right, the Machines agree to his terms and command all Sentinels attacking Zion to stand down and wait for orders. They later give Neo a connection to enter the Matrix to stop Smith on their behalf. Although the Matrix is now populated exclusively by Smith and his clones, the Smith that has obtained the Oracle's powers battles Neo alone; as he explains, he has foreseen his victory, and has no need for the help of his copies. The two are almost evenly matched as the fight begins, though Neo's combat abilities seem arguably superior to that of Smith, the latter attacking more out of brute force, rather than the technical skill he displayed in the first film. This lasts, until Neo is able to punch Smith strongly enough to slam him into the street at least 20&nbsp;ft away. As the fight continues, however, it becomes clear that Neo cannot win with his finite stamina against the tireless Smith, who begins to dominate Neo in the fight; by the end of the fight, he is able to brutally beat Neo into near defeat. In the midst of this battle, Smith explains to Neo his final [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] revelation: \"It was your life that taught me the purpose of all life. The purpose of life is to end.\"\n\nWhen Neo is near defeat, Smith demands to know why he continues to fight despite knowing he cannot win. Neo calmly responds, \"Because I choose to\" and is savagely pummeled by the enraged Smith as a result. Suddenly recognizing the scene from his [[prophecy]], Smith is compelled to deliver the line he said in it: \"I say.... Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo.\" His own words confuse and frighten him. Neo realizes that he cannot overpower Smith and allows himself to be assimilated. Because Agent Smith has deleted the anomaly (Neo), he no longer has a purpose and he must also be deleted. Smith is now directly connected to the Source, the machines are able to destroy all copies of his programming and reboot the Matrix without errors. The process does kill Neo, but does also destroy Smith. Neo's body is carried away by the machines, and an uncertain peace is established between Zion and the machine world.\n\n===''The Matrix Online''===\nDespite his destruction at the end of the film series, Agent Smith (or at least the remnants of his programming) managed to return and made several appearances inside the movie's official continuation, the [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[The Matrix Online]]''.\n\nThe first infection was noted in Machine mission controller Agent Gray, whose background information confirms that he was overwritten by Smith at some point during the timeline of the second and third films. This infection had somehow survived the reboot at the end of the third film and rose to the surface once again during chapter 1.2, The Hunt For Morpheus. The Agent, in both a storyline related mission and live event, showed signs of uncharacteristic speech and emotion and eventually led an assault against Zionist redpills declaring 'their stench unbearable any longer'. As a result of his actions the agent was apprehended by his fellow system representatives and scheduled for a 'thorough code cleansing'. He has shown no signs of direct infection since.   \n    \nMachine liaison officer DifferenceEngine, following a similar scenario to that of the previous Agent Gray infection, also took on the dialect and emotional characteristics of the famous exile agent. Instead of attacking redpills, this instance insisted on finding 'Mr. Anderson'. In the end, the human/machine head relations liaison, Agent Pace, was made aware of the program's infection and subsequent crusade; she proceeded to lock down his RSI and return his program to the Source for analysis. His subsequent fate is unknown.\n\nThe third victim of infection was the notorious bluepill Shane Black. This man was an unfortunate victim of the Smith Virus who, once infected, gained the ability to spread the code to others. This quickly led to a small scale outbreak, with several more bluepills becoming infected and joining forces in their hunt for power. He and the other infected were eventually cleansed and returned to their bluepill lives. Shane Black's troubles continued, as he was one of the bluepills recorded to have first witnessed Unlimited redpills practising their newfound powers at the Uriah wharf. This triggered a resurgence of the memories formed during his Smith infection and he soon became volatile and insane. He is reported to have been mercifully killed shortly afterwards.\n\nThe most recent appearance of the Smith virus was during the third anniversary events. The virus manifested itself in the form of black-suited men (although they lacked the distinct likeness of Smith). As redpills began to fight back using specialist code from the Oracle, the virus vanished suddenly, stating that he had obtained a new and more dangerous form. The nature of this form was never revealed. <!--The Matrix Online has closed, so all open storylines will indefinitely remain unresolved.-->\n\n===''The Matrix: Path of Neo''===\n''[[The Matrix: Path of Neo]]'', a video game covering the events of the entire film trilogy, features a different ending than that shown in ''The Matrix Revolutions'', with a new final boss: the ''MegaSmith''. The MegaSmith was used for gameplay reasons, because though the Wachowskis thought the [[martyr]] approach suitable for film, they also believed that in an interactive medium such as a video game (based upon the successful completion of goals), this would not work. So, this character was created to be the more appropriate \"final boss\" of ''Path of Neo'', with the final battle described by the siblings as \"A little [[Hulk]] versus [[Galactus]] action\". The MegaSmith is composed of destroyed buildings, cars, and parts of the road, with the \"spectator Smiths\" standing around the crater and in the streets acting as the MegaSmith's muscles, resulting in Smith not only becoming the city's people, but the city itself.\n\nAfter Neo knocks Smith into the crater in the level \"Aerial Battle\", Smith is sent flying through the ground and up through the street. As Neo relaxes, the surrounding Smiths walk away from the crater. Neo gets out of the crater, and dodges a car which flies through the air and lands in a pile of debris. Neo looks on as Smiths tear up chunks of the road and throw cars into this pile. A truck then speeds into a building and blows it up. Smiths can be seen holding the debris together as it takes on a thirty-story tall humanoid form which is then struck by lightning, powering it up. Neo flies up to watch as the giant humanoid lowers its head onto its shoulders. The giant Smith then pulls a pair of giant Smith Shades from a billboard and puts them on. As an interesting aside, the glasses on the billboard are the same ones Agent Smith wore in the first Matrix film, with the curved nose bar, but when the MegaSmith actually puts them on, they become the ones Agent Smith wears in ''The Matrix Reloaded'' and in ''Revolutions''.\n\nAfter the fight\u2014consisting of Neo dodging blows and building up power to launch more powerful assaults at MegaSmith, damaging one arm and creating a large hole in his chest\u2014Neo flies straight into MegaSmith's mouth, causing the Smiths throughout the Matrix to overload and explode. The player is then shown a short scene from ''The Matrix: Revolutions'' of the streets shining with light emanating from the destroyed Smiths.\n\n===''The Lego Batman Movie''===\nAgent Smith briefly appears in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' as one of the captives of the [[Phantom Zone]]. He and his clones appear surveilling [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'s vandalized Wayne Island, and later appear as one of the multiple enemies attacking the heroes. Smith's clones also appear as enemies in the ''Lego Batman Movie'' story pack for ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'', adapting their role in the film.\n\nHis voice actor was uncredited.\n\n===''Space Jam 2''===\nAgent Smith will reportedly appear in the upcoming film ''[[Space Jam 2]]'', it is unknown if Hugo Weaving will reprise his role.\n\n==Personality==\nFrom the start it is evident that Agent Smith is significantly stronger, smarter, and more individualistic than other Agents. While other agents rarely act without consulting each other via their earpieces, to the point where they often finish each other's sentences, Smith is usually the one giving orders or using his earpiece to gather information for his own ends. Smith also appears to be the leader of other Agents in the first film, as he has the authority to launch Sentinel attacks in the real world. As with other Agents, Smith generally approaches problems through a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] point of view but, if necessary, will also act with brute force and apparent rage, especially when provoked by Neo.\n\nThe earpieces represent some form of control mechanism by the machines. It is notable that when he is interrogating Morpheus, he sends the other agents from the room, then removes his earpiece, releasing himself from the link to the machines before expressing his opinion of humanity. Early in the second film, Smith's earpiece is sent to Neo in an envelope as a message from Smith, representing Smith's newfound freedom.\n\nAgent Smith complains to Morpheus that the Matrix and its inhabitants smell disgusting, \"if there is such a thing [as smell]\". Smith has an open hatred of humans and their weakness of the flesh. He compares humanity to a [[virus]]; a disease organism that uncontrollably replicates and would inevitably destroy their environment were it not for the machine intelligences keeping them in check. Ironically, Smith eventually becomes a computer virus, multiplying until he has overrun the entire Matrix.\n\nAt the same time, Smith develops an animosity towards the Matrix itself, feeling that he is as much a prisoner of it as the humans he is tasked with controlling. He later develops an immense and increasingly open desire for the destruction of both mankind and machines.\n\nHe was also shown to be a [[nihilism|nihilist]], which eventually culminates in his statement that the purpose of life is to end, and crediting Neo's life for his determining this.<ref>''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]''<br>'''Agent Smith:''' I must thank you [Neo]. After all, it was your life that taught me the purpose of all life. The purpose of life is to ''end.''</ref> During his final showdown with Neo, Smith angrily dismisses causes such as freedom, truth, peace, and love as simply human attempts to justify a meaningless and purposeless existence, and is completely unable to comprehend why Neo continues to fight him despite the knowledge that he cannot win.<ref>''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]''<br>'''Agent Smith:''' Why, Mr. Anderson? Why, why? Why do you do it? Why? Why get up? Why keep fighting? Do you believe you're fighting for something, for more than your survival? Can you tell me what it is, do you even know? Is it freedom or truth, perhaps peace - could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Anderson, vagaries of perception. Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose! And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself. Although, only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love. You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson, you must know it by now! You can't win, it's pointless to keep fighting! Why, Mr. Anderson, why?! why do you persist?! / '''Neo:''' Because I choose to.</ref>\n\nThe [[Wachowskis]] have commented that Smith's gradual humanization throughout ''The Matrix'' is a process intended to mirror and balance Neo's own increasing power and understanding of the machine world.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nA writer at ''The Guardian'' commented that Smith seems to enjoy his job too much.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/09/hugo-weaving-the-matrix-agent-smith-why-id-like-to-be</ref>\n\n==Portrayal==\nFrench actor [[Jean Reno]] was originally offered the role of Agent Smith in ''The Matrix'', but he declined as he was at one point of his career in which he didn't want to leave his native [[France]], unwilling to move to [[Australia]] for a four-and-a-half months shooting.

He went to develop a neutral accent but with more specific character for the role. He wanted Smith to sound neither human nor robotic. He also said that [[The Wachowskis]]' voices influenced his voice in the film. When filming for ''The Matrix'' began, Weaving mentioned that he was excited to be a part of something that would extend him.<ref name = \"Interrogation Room\">{{cite AV media| people =Oreck, Josh (Director); Wachowski, Larry; Matthies, Eric (Producers) | title =[[The Matrix Revisited]] | section = Interrogation Room | url = | medium =DVD | publisher = [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros.

Agents wear rectangular sunglasses, dark green business suits and neckties, and earpiece radios; after Smith loses his status as an Agent, his suit and tie turn black, his sunglasses take on an angled contour that approximates the rounded shape of the ones Neo wears, and he removes his earpiece and sends it to Neo. In contrast to the other Agents who show apathy toward the human race, Smith harbors an acute disgust with humanity. In the first film, he expresses a desire to leave the Matrix to escape its repulsive taint, and reasons that with Zion destroyed, his services will no longer be required, allowing him in some sense to 'leave' the Matrix. This at least partially explains his extreme antagonism towards Neo, who fights relentlessly to save Zion.\n\nOther Agents have common [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] names like [[Brown (surname)|Brown]], [[Jones (surname)|Jones]], and [[Thompson (surname)|Thompson]]. It was mentioned in the Philosopher Commentary on the DVD collection that the names of [[Smith (surname)|Smith]], Brown, and Jones may be endemic to the system itself, demonstrating a very \"robotic\" mindset on the part of the Machines.\n\nNeo's solitary role as the One is contrasted by Smith, who, by replicating himself, becomes \"the many\". When Neo asks the [[Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]] about Smith, the Oracle explains that Smith is Neo's opposite and his negative, the result of the Matrix's governing equations trying to balance themselves.\n\nUnlike the other characters in ''The Matrix'', Smith almost always refers to Neo as \"Mr. Anderson\".

The AR-15 used .22-caliber bullets, which destabilized when they hit a human body, as opposed to the .30 round, which typically passed through in a straight line. The smaller caliber meant that it could be controlled in autofire due the reduced recoil. Being almost one-third the weight of the .30 meant that the soldier could sustain fire for longer with the same load. Due to design innovations, the AR-15 could fire 600 to 700 rounds a minute with an extremely low jamming rate. Parts were stamped out, not hand-machined, so could be mass-produced, and the stock was plastic to reduce weight.<ref name=\"Atlantic_Fallows\"/>\n\n[[File:ArmaLite AR-15 SPAR 3240 DEC. 17. 2004.png|thumb|ArmaLite AR-15]]\nIn 1958, the Army's [[Combat Developments Experimentation Command]] ran experiments with small squads in combat situations using the M14, AR-15, and another rifle designed by Winchester. The resulting study recommended adopting a lightweight rifle like the AR-15. In response, the Army declared that all rifles and machine guns should use the same ammunition, and ordered full production of the M-14.<ref name=\"Atlantic_Fallows\"/> However, advocates for the AR-15 gained the attention of Air Force Chief of Staff General [[Curtis Lemay]]. After testing the AR-15 with the ammunition manufactured by Remington that Armalite and Colt recommended, the Air Force declared that the AR-15 was its 'standard model' and ordered 8,500 rifles and 8.5 million rounds.<ref name=\"Atlantic_Fallows\"/> Advocates for the AR-15 in the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] acquired 1,000 Air Force AR-15s and shipped them to be tested by the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN). The South Vietnam soldiers issued glowing reports of the weapon's reliability, recording zero broken parts while firing 80,000 rounds in one stage of testing, and requiring only two replacement parts for the 1,000 weapons over the entire course of testing. The report of the experiment recommended that the U.S. provide the AR-15 as the standard rifle of the ARVN, but Admiral [[Harry Felt]], then Commander in Chief, Pacific Forces, rejected the recommendations on the advice of the U.S. Army.<ref name=\"Atlantic_Fallows\"/>\n\nThroughout 1962 and 1963, the U.S. military extensively tested the AR-15. Positive evaluations emphasized its lightness, \"lethality\", and reliability.<ref name=\"Atlantic_Fallows\"/> However, the [[United States Army Materiel Command|Army Materiel Command]] criticized its inaccuracy at longer ranges and lack of penetrating power at higher ranges.<ref name=\"m-14parts.com\" /><ref name=\"smallarmsreview.com\" /><ref name=\"Atlantic_Fallows\"/> In early 1963, the [[U.S. Special Forces]] asked, and was given permission, to make the AR-15 its standard weapon. Other users included Army Airborne units in Vietnam and some units affiliated with the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. As more units adopted the AR-15, Secretary of the Army [[Cyrus Vance]] ordered an investigation into why the weapon had been rejected by the Army. The resulting report found that Army Materiel Command had rigged the previous tests, selecting tests that would favor the M14 and choosing [[match grade]] M14s to compete against AR-15s out of the box.<ref name=\"Atlantic_Fallows\"/> At this point, the bureaucratic battle lines were well-defined, with the Army ordnance agencies opposed to the AR-15 and the Air Force and civilian leadership of the Defense Department in favor.<ref name=\"Atlantic_Fallows\"/>\n\nIn January 1963, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara concluded that the AR-15 was the superior weapon system and ordered a halt to M14 production.<ref name=\"m-14parts.com\" /><ref name=\"smallarmsreview.com\" /> In late 1963, the Defense Department began mass procurement of rifles for the Air Force and special Army units. Secretary McNamara designated the Army as the procurer for the weapon with the Department, which allowed the Army ordnance establishment to modify the weapon as they wished. The first modification was the additions of a \"manual bolt closure,\" allowing a soldier to ram in a round if it failed to seat properly. The Air Force, which was buying the rifle, and the Marine Corps, which had tested it both objected to this addition, with the Air Force noting, \"During three years of testing and operation of the AR-15 rifle under all types of conditions the Air Force has no record of malfunctions that could have been corrected by a manual bolt closing device.\" They also noted that the closure added weight and complexity, reducing the reliability of the weapon. Colonel Howard Yount, who managed the Army procurement, would later state the bolt closure was added after direction from senior leadership, rather than as a result of any complaint or test result, and testified about the reasons: \"the M-1, the M-14, and the carbine had always had something for the soldier to push on; that maybe this would be a comforting feeling to him, or something.\"<ref name=\"Atlantic_Fallows\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Hearings before the Special Subcommittee on the M-16 Rifle Program of the Committee on Armed Services, House of Representatives, Ninetieth Congress, first session, 15 May, 16, 31, 21 June, 25 July, 26, 27, 8 August, 9, and 22, 1967. |url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uiug.30112109164266?urlappend=%3Bseq=121 |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives |accessdate=1 April 2019 |page=4545}}</ref>\n\nAfter modifications,<ref name=\"nodakspud.com\" /> the new redesigned rifle was subsequently adopted as the M16 Rifle.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" /><ref name=\"m-14parts.com\" /><ref name=\"smallarmsreview.com\" /> \"(The M16) was much lighter compared to the M14 it replaced, ultimately allowing soldiers to carry more ammunition.

He ordered the Army Inspector General to investigate the testing methods used; the Inspector General confirmed that the testers were biased towards the M14.\n\nIn January 1963, Secretary McNamara received reports that M14 production was insufficient to meet the needs of the armed forces and ordered a halt to M14 production.<ref name=\"smallarmsreview.com\" /> At the time, the AR-15 was the only rifle that could fulfill a requirement of a \"universal\" infantry weapon for issue to all services.

However, the Army insisted on the inclusion of a [[forward assist]] to help push the bolt into battery in the event that a cartridge failed to seat into the chamber. The Air Force, Colt and Eugene Stoner believed that the addition of a forward assist was an unjustified expense.

The gas goes from the gas tube, through the bolt carrier key, and into the inside of the carrier where it expands in a donut shaped gas cylinder. Because the bolt is prevented from moving forward by the barrel, the carrier is driven to the rear by the expanding gases and thus converts the energy of the gas to movement of the rifle's parts. The back part of the bolt forms a piston head and the cavity in the bolt carrier is the piston sleeve. It is more correct to call it an \"internal piston\" system.\"<ref name=\"armalite1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.armalite.com/images/Tech%20Notes%5CTech%20Note%2054,%20Gas%20vs%20Op%20Rod%20Drive,%20020815.pdf |title=ARMALITE TECHNICAL NOTE 54: DIRECT IMPINGEMENT VERSUS PISTON DRIVE |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517092821/http://www.armalite.com/images/Tech%20Notes%5CTech%20Note%2054%2C%20Gas%20vs%20Op%20Rod%20Drive%2C%20020815.pdf |archivedate=17 May 2012|website=Armalite|date=3 July 2010}}</ref> \n\nThis design is much lighter and more compact than a gas-piston design. However, this design requires that combustion byproducts from the discharged cartridge be blown into the receiver as well. This accumulating carbon and vaporized metal build-up within the receiver and bolt-carrier negatively affects reliability and necessitates more intensive maintenance on the part of the individual soldier. The channeling of gasses into the bolt carrier during operation increases the amount of heat that is deposited in the receiver while firing the M16 and causes essential lubricant to be \"burned off\". This requires frequent and generous applications of appropriate lubricant.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Lack of proper lubrication is the most common source of weapon stoppages or jams<!--in general, or in M16's?-->.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe original M16 fared poorly in the jungles of [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and was infamous for reliability problems in the harsh environment.

Only troops who had fired their weapons at enemy targets were allowed to participate.  1,188 troops were armed with M16A2 or A4 rifles, making up 46 percent of the survey.  75 percent of M16 users (891 troops) reported they were satisfied with the weapon.  60 percent (713 troops) were satisfied with handling qualities such as handguards, size, and weight.  Of the 40 percent dissatisfied, most were with its size.  Only 19 percent of M16 users (226 troops) reported a stoppage, while 80 percent of those that experienced a stoppage said it had little impact on their ability to clear the stoppage and re-engage their target.  Half of the M16 users never experienced failures of their magazines to feed.  83 percent (986 troops) did not need their rifles repaired while in theater.  71 percent (843 troops) were confident in the M16's reliability, defined as level of soldier confidence their weapon will fire without malfunction, and 72 percent (855 troops) were confident in its durability, defined as level of soldier confidence their weapon will not break or need repair.  Both factors were attributed to high levels of soldiers performing their own maintenance.  60 percent of M16 users offered recommendations for improvements.  Requests included greater bullet lethality, new-built instead of rebuilt rifles, better quality magazines, decreased weight, and a collapsible stock.

The thicker barrel is more resistant to damage when handled roughly and is also slower to overheat during sustained fire. Unlike a traditional \"bull\" barrel that is thick its entire length, the M16A2's barrel is only thick forward of the handguards. The barrel profile under the handguards remained the same as the M16A1 for compatibility with the [[M203 grenade launcher]].\n\n===Barrel===\nEarly model M16 barrels had a [[rifling]] twist of 4 grooves, right hand twist, 1 turn in 14&nbsp;inches (1:355.6&nbsp;mm) bore \u2013 as it was the same rifling used by the .222 Remington sporting round. This was shown to make the light .223 Remington bullet yaw in flight at long ranges and it was soon replaced. Later models had an improved rifling with 6 grooves, right hand twist, 1 turn in 12&nbsp;inches (1:304.8&nbsp;mm) for increased accuracy and was optimized for use with the standard U.S. M193 cartridge. Current models are optimized for the heavier NATO SS109 bullet and have 6 grooves, right hand twist, 1 turn in 7 in (1:177.8&nbsp;mm).<ref>{{cite web |last=Simpson |first=Layne |url=http://www.shootingtimes.com/2011/01/04/ammunition_st223_120606/ |title=Handloading The .223 Remington for the AR-15 |publisher=Shootingtimes.com |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=13 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203004627/http://www.shootingtimes.com/2011/01/04/ammunition_st223_120606/ |archive-date=3 December 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/ArmyTechnicalManualforM16Rifle-Tm9-1005-249-23p/Manual-Tm9-1005-249-23p#page/n9/mode/2up |title=Army Technical Manual (for M16 rifle) \u2013 TM 9-1005-249-23P |publisher=[[United States Army]] |website=Archive.org |accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Colt_Weapon_Systems\"/><ref>Military Small Arms of the 20th Century, 7th Edition, 2000 by Ian V.

This allows recoil forces to drive straight to the rear. Instead of connecting or other mechanical parts driving the system, high pressure gas performs this function, reducing the weight of moving parts and the rifle as a whole.\"<ref name=\"armalite1\" /> The M16's straight-line recoil design, where the recoil spring is located in the stock directly behind the action,<ref name=\"SAOW2\" /> and serves the dual function of operating spring and recoil buffer.<ref name=\"SAOW2\" /> The stock being in line with the bore also reduces muzzle rise, especially during automatic fire.

The latter produces a 4 to 5-foot [[tear gas]] cloud on impact. The main advantage to using [[Ring Airfoil Projectile]]s is that their design does not allow them be thrown back by rioters with any real effect. The M234 is no longer used by U.S. forces.

The newer [[M9 bayonet]] has a clip-point blade with saw teeth along the spine, and can be used as a multi-purpose knife and wire-cutter when combined with its scabbard.

The rail comprises a series of ridges with a T-shaped cross-section interspersed with flat \"spacing slots\". Scopes are mounted either by sliding them on from one end or the other; by means of a \"rail-grabber\" which is clamped to the rail with bolts, thumbscrews or levers; or onto the slots between the raised sections. The rail was originally for scopes. However, once established, the use of the system was expanded to other accessories, such as tactical lights, laser aiming modules, night vision devices, [[reflex sight]]s, foregrips, bipods, and bayonets.\n\nCurrently, the M16 is in use by 15 NATO countries and more than 80 countries worldwide.\n\n==ArmaLite AR-15==\n{{Main|ArmaLite AR-15}}\n[[File:ArmaLite AR-15 SPAR8367 DEC. 20. 2004.png|thumb|Early ArmaLite AR-15 without magazine or flash hider]]\n[[File:Colt ArmaLite AR-15 Model 01 SPAR1372 DEC. 22. 2004.jpg|thumb|Colt ArmaLite AR-15 Model 01 made from 1959\u20131964]]\n[[File:Colt ArmaLite AR-15 Model 02 SPAR1373 DEC. 22. 2004.jpg|thumb|Colt ArmaLite AR-15 Model 02 made in 1964]]\n\n===ArmaLite AR-15===\nThe weapon that eventually became the M16 series was basically a scaled down [[ArmaLite AR-10|AR-10]] with an [[Ambidexterity|ambidextrous]] charging handle located within the carrying handle, a narrower front sight \"A\" frame, and no flash suppressor.<ref name=\"SAOW2\"/>\n\n===Colt ArmaLite AR-15 (Models 601 & 602)===\nColt's first two models produced after the acquisition of the rifle from ArmaLite were the 601 and 602, and these rifles were in many ways clones of the original ArmaLite rifle (in fact, these rifles were often found stamped ''Colt ArmaLite AR-15, Property of the U.S. Government caliber .223'', with no reference to them being M16s).<ref name=\"SAOW2\"/> The 601 and 602 are easily identified by their flat lower receivers without raised surfaces around the magazine well and occasionally green or brown furniture. The 601 was adopted first of any of the rifles by the USAF, and was quickly supplemented with the XM16 (Colt Model 602) and later the M16 (Colt Model 604) as improvements were made. There was also a limited purchase of 602s, and a number of both of these rifles found their way to a number of Special Operations units then operating in South East Asia, most notably the [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEALs]]. The only major difference between the 601 and 602 is the switch from the original 1:14-inch rifling twist to the more common 1:12-inch twist. These weapons were equipped with a triangular charging handle and a bolt hold open device that lacked a raised lower engagement surface. The bolt hold open device had a slanted and serrated surface that had to be engaged with a bare thumb, index finger, or thumb nail because of the lack of this surface. The U.S. Air Force continued to use the ArmaLite AR-15 marked rifles in various configurations into the 1990s.\n\n==Variants==\n{{details|topic=M16 variants|List of Colt AR-15 and M16 rifle variants}}\n\n===M16===\n[[File:Armamento - Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n 05.JPG|thumb|An early M16 rifle without forward-assist.

It was equipped with triangular handguards, butt stocks without a compartment for the storage of a cleaning kit,<ref name=\"SAOW2\"/> a three-pronged flash suppressor, full auto, and no [[forward assist]]. Bolt carriers were originally chrome plated and slick-sided, lacking forward assist notches. Later, the chrome plated carriers were dropped in favor of Army issued notched and [[parkerized]] carriers though the interior portion of the bolt carrier is still chrome-lined. The Air Force continued to operate these weapons until around 2001, at which time the Air Force converted all of its M16s to the M16A2 configuration.\n\nThe M16 was also adopted by the [[Special Air Service|British SAS]], who used it during the [[Falklands War]].<ref name=special_operations1>{{cite web |url=http://www.specialoperations.com/Foreign/United_Kingdom/SAS/Weapons.htm |title=SAS Weapons |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712082335/http://www.specialoperations.com/Foreign/United_Kingdom/SAS/Weapons.htm |archivedate=12 July 2008|website=Special Operations.Com|date=2000|location=United Kingdom|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===XM16E1 and M16A1 (Colt Model 603)===\n[[File:M16A1 PVS-2.JPEG|thumb|A Vietnam War-era infantryman armed with an M16A1 rifle and an AN/PVS-2 Starlight scope for use at night.]]\n\nThe U.S. Army XM16E1 was essentially the same weapon as the M16 with the addition of a [[forward assist]] and corresponding notches in the bolt carrier. The M16A1 was the finalized production model in 1967 and was produced until 1982.\n\nTo address issues raised by the XM16E1's testing cycle, a closed, bird-cage flash suppressor replaced the XM16E1's three-pronged flash suppressor which caught on twigs and leaves. Various other changes were made after numerous problems in the field. Cleaning kits were developed and issued while barrels with chrome-plated chambers and later fully lined bores were introduced.\n\nWith these and other changes, the malfunction rate slowly declined and new soldiers were generally unfamiliar with early problems. A rib was built into the side of the receiver on the XM16E1 to help prevent accidentally pressing the magazine release button while closing the ejection port cover. This rib was later extended on production M16A1s to help in preventing the magazine release from inadvertently being pressed. The hole in the bolt that accepts the cam pin was crimped inward on one side, in such a way that the cam pin may not be inserted with the bolt installed backwards, which would cause failures to eject until corrected. The M16A1 saw limited use in training capacities until the early 2000s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/Photos/newsphoto.aspx?newsphotoid=2931 |title=Defense.gov Photos : News Photo|date=1 March 2010|website=Defense.gov|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301153228/http://www.defense.gov/Photos/newsphoto.aspx?newsphotoid=2931|archivedate=1 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/photos/Jul2000/000716-F-6217S-015.html |title=Sgt.

It was officially adopted by the Department of Defense as the \"US Rifle, 5.56mm, M16A2\" in 1982. The Marines were the first branch of the U.S. Armed Forces to adopt it, in the early/mid-1980s, with the [[United States Army]] following suit in the late 1980s.\n\nModifications to the M16A2 were extensive. In addition to the new rifling, the barrel was made with a greater thickness in front of the front sight post, to resist bending in the field and to allow a longer period of sustained fire without overheating. The rest of the barrel was maintained at the original thickness to enable the [[M203 grenade launcher]] to be attached. A new adjustable rear sight was added, allowing the rear sight to be dialed in for specific range settings between 300 and 800 meters to take full advantage of the ballistic characteristics of the new SS109 rounds and to allow windage adjustments without the need of a tool or cartridge.<ref name=Venola>{{Cite journal |last1=Venola |first=Richard |title=What a Long Strange Trip It's Been |journal=Book of the AR-15 |volume=1 |issue=2 |year=2005 |pages=6\u201318 |ref=harv}}</ref> The weapon's reliability allowed it to be widely used around the Marine Corps' special operations divisions as well. The flash suppressor was again modified, this time to be closed on the bottom so it would not kick up dirt or snow when being fired from the prone position, and acting as a [[Muzzle brake|recoil compensator]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hogg|Weeks|2000|p=292}}</ref>\n\nThe front grip was modified from the original triangular shape to a round one, which better fit smaller hands and could be fitted to older models of the M16. The new handguards were also symmetrical so armories need not separate left- and right-hand spares. The handguard retention ring was tapered to make it easier to install and uninstall the handguards. A notch for the middle finger was added to the pistol grip, as well as more texture to enhance the grip. The buttstock was lengthened by {{convert|5/8|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Venola, Richard 2005\" /> The new buttstock became ten times stronger than the original due to advances in polymer technology since the early 1960s. Original M16 stocks were made from fiberglass-impregnated resin; the newer stocks were engineered from DuPont Zytel glass-filled thermoset polymers. The new stock included a fully textured polymer buttplate for better grip on the shoulder, and retained a panel for accessing a small compartment inside the stock, often used for storing a basic cleaning kit.

The XM177 had a shorter {{convert|10|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} barrel and a telescoping stock, which made it substantially more compact. It also possessed a combination flash hider/sound moderator to reduce problems with muzzle flash and loud report. The Air Force's GAU-5/A (XM177) and the Army's XM177E1 variants differed over the latter's inclusion of a forward assist, although some GAU-5s do have the forward assist. The final Air Force GAU-5/A and Army XM177E2 had an {{convert|11.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} barrel with a longer flash/sound suppressor. The lengthening of the barrel was to support the attachment of Colt's own [[XM148 grenade launcher|XM148]] 40&nbsp;mm grenade launcher. These versions were also known as the Colt Commando model commonly referenced and marketed as the CAR-15. The variants were issued in limited numbers to special forces, helicopter crews, Air Force pilots, Air Force Security Police Military Working Dog (MWD) handlers, officers, radio operators, artillerymen, and troops other than front line riflemen. Some USAF GAU-5A/As were later equipped with even longer {{convert|14.5|in|mm|adj=on}} 1/12 rifled barrels as the two shorter versions were worn out. The {{convert|14.5|in|mm|adj=on}} barrel allowed the use of MILES gear and for bayonets to be used with the sub-machine guns (as the Air Force described them). By 1989, the Air Force started to replace the earlier barrels with 1/7 rifled models for use with the M855-round. The weapons were given the redesignation of GUU-5/P.\n\nThese were effectively used by the British [[Special Air Service]] during the [[Falklands War]].<ref name=special_operations1 />\n\n===M4 carbine===\n{{Main|M4 carbine}}\n[[File:SCRange20034344940.jpg|thumb|right|An [[M4 carbine#M4A1|M4A1 carbine]] (foreground) and two M16A2s (background) being fired by U.S. Marines during a [[live fire exercise]]: though adopted in the 1990s and derived from the M16A2, the M4 carbine was part of a long line of short-barreled [[AR-15]] used in the U.S. military]]\n\nThe M4 carbine was developed from various outgrowths of these designs, including a number of {{convert|14.5|in|mm|0|adj=on}}-barreled A1 style carbines. The XM4 (Colt Model 720) started its trials in 1984, with a barrel of {{convert|14.5|in|mm}}. The weapon became the M4 in 1991. Officially adopted as a replacement for the [[M3 submachine gun|M3 \"Grease Gun\"]] (and the [[M9 pistol|Beretta M9]] and M16A2 for select troops) in 1994, it was used with great success in the Balkans and in more recent conflicts, including the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] theaters. The M4 carbine has a three-round [[Burst mode (firearm)|burst]] firing mode, while the M4A1 carbine has a [[Automatic firearm|fully automatic]] firing mode. Both have a [[Picatinny rail]] on the upper receiver, allowing the carry handle/rear sight assembly to be replaced with other sighting devices.\n\n====M4 Commando====\n{{Main|CAR-15}}\nColt also returned to the original \"[[CAR-15|Commando]]\" idea, with its Model 733, essentially a modernized XM177E2 with many of the features introduced on the M16A2.\n\n===Diemaco C7 and C8===\n{{Main|Colt Canada C7 rifle}}\n[[File:Canadian C7A2 Rifle.JPG|thumb|A Canadian soldier fires the current issue C7A2 rifle at the range with a [[C79 optical sight|C79]]A2 sight. This particular example is missing the standard TRIAD mount.]]\n\nThe [[Diemaco]] [[Colt Canada C7 rifle|C7]] and C8 are updated variants of the M16 developed and used by the [[Canadian Forces]] and are now manufactured by [[Colt Canada]]. The C7 is a further development of the experimental M16A1E1. Like earlier M16s, it can be fired in either semi-automatic or automatic mode, instead of the burst function selected for the M16A2. The C7 also features the structural strengthening, improved handguards, and longer stock developed for the M16A2. Diemaco changed the trapdoor in the buttstock to make it easier to access and a spacer of {{convert|0.5|in|mm}} is available to adjust stock length to user preference. The most easily noticeable external difference between American M16A2s and Diemaco C7s is the retention of the A1 style rear sights. Not easily apparent is Diemaco's use of hammer-forged barrels. The Canadians originally desired to use a heavy barrel profile instead.\n\nThe C7 has been developed to the C7A1, with a [[Weaver rail]] on the upper receiver for a C79 optical sight, and to the C7A2, with different furniture and internal improvements. The Diemaco produced Weaver rail on the original C7A1 variants does not meet the M1913 \"Picatinny\" standard, leading to some problems with mounting commercial sights. This is easily remedied with minor modification to the upper receiver or the sight itself. Since Diemaco's acquisition by Colt to form Colt Canada, all Canadian produced flattop upper receivers are machined to the M1913 standard.\n\nThe C8 is the carbine version of the C7.<ref>[http://www.casr.ca/101-army-smallarm-1.htm Canadian Forces Automatic Rifles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706171606/http://casr.ca/101-army-smallarm-1.htm |date=6 July 2011}}.

It is based on the M16, and was originally conceived as an improvement based on the Colt [[M4 carbine]] family issued to the U.S. military, with the notable inclusion of an HK-proprietary short-stroke gas piston system derived from the [[Heckler & Koch G36]].

It differed from the basic M16A1 primarily in being optimized for maritime operations and coming equipped with a sound suppressor. Most of the operating parts of the rifle were coated in [[Kal-Guard]], a hole of {{convert|0.25|in|mm}} was drilled through the stock and buffer tube for drainage, and an O-ring was added to the end of the buffer assembly. The weapon could reportedly be carried to the depth of 200 feet (60&nbsp;m) in water without damage. The initial Mk 2 Mod 0 Blast Suppressor was based on the U.S. Army's Human Engineering Lab's (HEL) M4 noise suppressor. The HEL M4 vented gas directly from the action, requiring a modified bolt carrier. A gas deflector was added to the charging handle to prevent gas from contacting the user. Thus, the HEL M4 suppressor was permanently mounted though it allowed normal semi-automatic and automatic operation. If the HEL M4 suppressor were removed, the weapon would have to be manually loaded after each single shot. On the other hand, the Mk 2 Mod 0 blast suppressor was considered an integral part of the Mk 4 Mod 0 rifle, but it would function normally if the suppressor were removed. The Mk 2 Mod 0 blast suppressor also drained water much more quickly and did not require any modification to the bolt carrier or to the charging handle. In the late 1970s, the Mk 2 Mod 0 blast suppressor was replaced by the Mk 2 blast suppressor made by Knight's Armament Company (KAC). The KAC suppressor can be fully submerged and water will drain out in less than eight seconds. It will operate without degradation even if the rifle is fired at the maximum rate of fire. The U.S. Army replaced the HEL M4 with the much simpler Studies in Operational Negation of Insurgency and Counter-Subversion (SIONICS) MAW-A1 noise and flash suppressor.\n\n===US Navy Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle===\n{{Main|Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle}}\n[[File:SPRCrane.jpg|thumb|US Navy Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle]]\n\nDeveloped to increase the effective range of soldiers in the designated marksman role, the U.S. Navy developed the Mark 12 Special Purpose Rifle (SPR). Configurations in service vary, but the core of the Mark 12 SPR is an 18\" heavy barrel with muzzle brake and free float tube. This tube relieves pressure on the barrel caused by standard handguards and greatly increases the potential accuracy of the system. Also common are higher magnification optics ranging from the 6\u00d7 power Trijicon ACOG to the Leupold Mark 4 Tactical rifle scopes. Firing Mark 262 Mod 0 ammunition with a 77gr Open tip Match bullet, the system has an official effective range of 600+ meters. However published reports of confirmed kills beyond 800&nbsp;m from Iraq and Afghanistan are not uncommon.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n===M231 Firing Port Weapon (FPW)===\n[[File:M231 1.svg|thumb|right|M231 FPW]]\n\nThe [[M231 Firing Port Weapon]] (FPW) is an adapted version of the M16 assault rifle for firing from [[Firing port|ports]] on the [[M2 Bradley]]. The infantry's normal M16s are too long for use in a \"buttoned up\" fighting vehicle, so the FPW was developed to provide a suitable weapon for this role.\n\n===Colt Model 655 and 656 \"Sniper\" variants===\nWith the expanding [[Vietnam War]], Colt developed two rifles of the M16 pattern for evaluation as possible light sniper or designated marksman rifles. The Colt Model 655 M16A1 Special High Profile was essentially a standard A1 rifle with a heavier barrel and a scope bracket that attached to the rifle's carry handle. The Colt Model 656 M16A1 Special Low Profile had a special upper receiver with no carrying handle. Instead, it had a low-profile iron sight adjustable for windage and a Weaver base for mounting a scope, a precursor to the Colt and Picatinny rails. It also had a hooded front iron sight in addition to the heavy barrel. Both rifles came standard with either a Leatherwood/Realist scope 3\u20139\u00d7 Adjustable Ranging Telescope. Some of them were fitted with a Sionics noise and flash suppressor.

The AR-15 used .22-caliber bullets, which destabilized when they hit a human body, as opposed to the .30 round, which typically passed through in a straight line. The smaller caliber meant that it could be controlled in autofire due the reduced recoil. Being almost one-third the weight of the .30 meant that the soldier could sustain fire for longer with the same load. Due to design innovations, the AR-15 could fire 600 to 700 rounds a minute with an extremely low jamming rate. Parts were stamped out, not hand-machined, so could be mass-produced, and the stock was plastic to reduce weight.<ref name=\"Atlantic_Fallows\"/>\n\n[[File:ArmaLite AR-15 SPAR 3240 DEC. 17. 2004.png|thumb|ArmaLite AR-15]]\nIn 1958, the Army's [[Combat Developments Experimentation Command]] ran experiments with small squads in combat situations using the M14, AR-15, and another rifle designed by Winchester. The resulting study recommended adopting a lightweight rifle like the AR-15. In response, the Army declared that all rifles and machine guns should use the same ammunition, and ordered full production of the M-14.<ref name=\"Atlantic_Fallows\"/> However, advocates for the AR-15 gained the attention of Air Force Chief of Staff General [[Curtis Lemay]]. After testing the AR-15 with the ammunition manufactured by Remington that Armalite and Colt recommended, the Air Force declared that the AR-15 was its 'standard model' and ordered 8,500 rifles and 8.5 million rounds.<ref name=\"Atlantic_Fallows\"/> Advocates for the AR-15 in the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] acquired 1,000 Air Force AR-15s and shipped them to be tested by the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN). The South Vietnam soldiers issued glowing reports of the weapon's reliability, recording zero broken parts while firing 80,000 rounds in one stage of testing, and requiring only two replacement parts for the 1,000 weapons over the entire course of testing. The report of the experiment recommended that the U.S. provide the AR-15 as the standard rifle of the ARVN, but Admiral [[Harry Felt]], then Commander in Chief, Pacific Forces, rejected the recommendations on the advice of the U.S. Army.<ref name=\"Atlantic_Fallows\"/>\n\nThroughout 1962 and 1963, the U.S. military extensively tested the AR-15. Positive evaluations emphasized its lightness, \"lethality\", and reliability.<ref name=\"Atlantic_Fallows\"/> However, the [[United States Army Materiel Command|Army Materiel Command]] criticized its inaccuracy at longer ranges and lack of penetrating power at higher ranges.<ref name=\"m-14parts.com\" /><ref name=\"smallarmsreview.com\" /><ref name=\"Atlantic_Fallows\"/> In early 1963, the [[U.S. Special Forces]] asked, and was given permission, to make the AR-15 its standard weapon. Other users included Army Airborne units in Vietnam and some units affiliated with the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. As more units adopted the AR-15, Secretary of the Army [[Cyrus Vance]] ordered an investigation into why the weapon had been rejected by the Army. The resulting report found that Army Materiel Command had rigged the previous tests, selecting tests that would favor the M14 and choosing [[match grade]] M14s to compete against AR-15s out of the box.<ref name=\"Atlantic_Fallows\"/> At this point, the bureaucratic battle lines were well-defined, with the Army ordnance agencies opposed to the AR-15 and the Air Force and civilian leadership of the Defense Department in favor.<ref name=\"Atlantic_Fallows\"/>\n\nIn January 1963, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara concluded that the AR-15 was the superior weapon system and ordered a halt to M14 production.<ref name=\"m-14parts.com\" /><ref name=\"smallarmsreview.com\" /> In late 1963, the Defense Department began mass procurement of rifles for the Air Force and special Army units. Secretary McNamara designated the Army as the procurer for the weapon with the Department, which allowed the Army ordnance establishment to modify the weapon as they wished. The first modification was the additions of a \"manual bolt closure,\" allowing a soldier to ram in a round if it failed to seat properly. The Air Force, which was buying the rifle, and the Marine Corps, which had tested it both objected to this addition, with the Air Force noting, \"During three years of testing and operation of the AR-15 rifle under all types of conditions the Air Force has no record of malfunctions that could have been corrected by a manual bolt closing device.\" They also noted that the closure added weight and complexity, reducing the reliability of the weapon. Colonel Howard Yount, who managed the Army procurement, would later state the bolt closure was added after direction from senior leadership, rather than as a result of any complaint or test result, and testified about the reasons: \"the M-1, the M-14, and the carbine had always had something for the soldier to push on; that maybe this would be a comforting feeling to him, or something.\"<ref name=\"Atlantic_Fallows\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Hearings before the Special Subcommittee on the M-16 Rifle Program of the Committee on Armed Services, House of Representatives, Ninetieth Congress, first session, 15 May, 16, 31, 21 June, 25 July, 26, 27, 8 August, 9, and 22, 1967. |url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uiug.30112109164266?urlappend=%3Bseq=121 |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives |accessdate=1 April 2019 |page=4545}}</ref>\n\nAfter modifications,<ref name=\"nodakspud.com\" /> the new redesigned rifle was subsequently adopted as the M16 Rifle.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" /><ref name=\"m-14parts.com\" /><ref name=\"smallarmsreview.com\" /> \"(The M16) was much lighter compared to the M14 it replaced, ultimately allowing soldiers to carry more ammunition.

The gas goes from the gas tube, through the bolt carrier key, and into the inside of the carrier where it expands in a donut shaped gas cylinder. Because the bolt is prevented from moving forward by the barrel, the carrier is driven to the rear by the expanding gases and thus converts the energy of the gas to movement of the rifle's parts. The back part of the bolt forms a piston head and the cavity in the bolt carrier is the piston sleeve. It is more correct to call it an \"internal piston\" system.\"<ref name=\"armalite1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.armalite.com/images/Tech%20Notes%5CTech%20Note%2054,%20Gas%20vs%20Op%20Rod%20Drive,%20020815.pdf |title=ARMALITE TECHNICAL NOTE 54: DIRECT IMPINGEMENT VERSUS PISTON DRIVE |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517092821/http://www.armalite.com/images/Tech%20Notes%5CTech%20Note%2054%2C%20Gas%20vs%20Op%20Rod%20Drive%2C%20020815.pdf |archivedate=17 May 2012|website=Armalite|date=3 July 2010}}</ref> \n\nThis design is much lighter and more compact than a gas-piston design. However, this design requires that combustion byproducts from the discharged cartridge be blown into the receiver as well. This accumulating carbon and vaporized metal build-up within the receiver and bolt-carrier negatively affects reliability and necessitates more intensive maintenance on the part of the individual soldier. The channeling of gasses into the bolt carrier during operation increases the amount of heat that is deposited in the receiver while firing the M16 and causes essential lubricant to be \"burned off\". This requires frequent and generous applications of appropriate lubricant.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Lack of proper lubrication is the most common source of weapon stoppages or jams<!--in general, or in M16's?-->.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe original M16 fared poorly in the jungles of [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and was infamous for reliability problems in the harsh environment.

While only 100 troops were asked, they engaged in daily fighting in [[Marjah, Afghanistan|Marja]], including least a dozen intense engagements in [[Helmand Province]], where the ground is covered in fine powdered sand (called \"moon dust\" by troops) that can stick to firearms.<ref name=\"atwar.blogs.nytimes.com\">{{cite news |url=http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/07/examining-the-complaints-about-american-rifle-reliability/?_r=0 |title=Examining the Complaints About American Rifle Reliability|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922150652/http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/07/examining-the-complaints-about-american-rifle-reliability/?_r=0 |archivedate=22 September 2013 |work=The New York Times|date=7 July 2010}}</ref> Weapons were often dusty, wet, and covered in mud.  Intense firefights lasted hours with several magazines being expended. Only one soldier reported a jam when his M16 was covered in mud after climbing out of a canal. The weapon was cleared and resumed firing with the next chambered round. Furthermore, the Marine Chief Warrant Officer responsible for weapons training and performance of the Third Battalion, Sixth Marines, reported that \"We've had nil in the way of problems; we've had no issues\", with his [[battalion]]'s 350 M16s and 700 M4s.<ref name=\"atwar.blogs.nytimes.com\" />\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Rifle 5.56mm, XM16E1, Operation and Cycle of Functioning TF9-3663.webm|thumb|Video...Rifle 5.56mm, XM16E1.

The thicker barrel is more resistant to damage when handled roughly and is also slower to overheat during sustained fire. Unlike a traditional \"bull\" barrel that is thick its entire length, the M16A2's barrel is only thick forward of the handguards. The barrel profile under the handguards remained the same as the M16A1 for compatibility with the [[M203 grenade launcher]].\n\n===Barrel===\nEarly model M16 barrels had a [[rifling]] twist of 4 grooves, right hand twist, 1 turn in 14&nbsp;inches (1:355.6&nbsp;mm) bore \u2013 as it was the same rifling used by the .222 Remington sporting round. This was shown to make the light .223 Remington bullet yaw in flight at long ranges and it was soon replaced. Later models had an improved rifling with 6 grooves, right hand twist, 1 turn in 12&nbsp;inches (1:304.8&nbsp;mm) for increased accuracy and was optimized for use with the standard U.S. M193 cartridge. Current models are optimized for the heavier NATO SS109 bullet and have 6 grooves, right hand twist, 1 turn in 7 in (1:177.8&nbsp;mm).<ref>{{cite web |last=Simpson |first=Layne |url=http://www.shootingtimes.com/2011/01/04/ammunition_st223_120606/ |title=Handloading The .223 Remington for the AR-15 |publisher=Shootingtimes.com |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=13 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203004627/http://www.shootingtimes.com/2011/01/04/ammunition_st223_120606/ |archive-date=3 December 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/ArmyTechnicalManualforM16Rifle-Tm9-1005-249-23p/Manual-Tm9-1005-249-23p#page/n9/mode/2up |title=Army Technical Manual (for M16 rifle) \u2013 TM 9-1005-249-23P |publisher=[[United States Army]] |website=Archive.org |accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Colt_Weapon_Systems\"/><ref>Military Small Arms of the 20th Century, 7th Edition, 2000 by Ian V.

This allows recoil forces to drive straight to the rear. Instead of connecting or other mechanical parts driving the system, high pressure gas performs this function, reducing the weight of moving parts and the rifle as a whole.\"<ref name=\"armalite1\" /> The M16's straight-line recoil design, where the recoil spring is located in the stock directly behind the action,<ref name=\"SAOW2\" /> and serves the dual function of operating spring and recoil buffer.<ref name=\"SAOW2\" /> The stock being in line with the bore also reduces muzzle rise, especially during automatic fire.

The latter produces a 4 to 5-foot [[tear gas]] cloud on impact. The main advantage to using [[Ring Airfoil Projectile]]s is that their design does not allow them be thrown back by rioters with any real effect. The M234 is no longer used by U.S. forces. It has been replaced by the [[M203 grenade launcher|M203 40&nbsp;mm grenade launcher]] and [[nonlethal]] ammunition.\n\n===Bayonet===\nThe M16 is 44.25 inches (1124&nbsp;mm) long with an [[M7 bayonet]] attached.<ref name=\"archive.org\" /> The M7 bayonet is based on earlier designs such as the [[M4 bayonet|M4]], [[M5 bayonet|M5]], & [[M6 bayonet|M6]] bayonets, all of which are direct descendants of the [[M3 Fighting Knife]] and have spear-point blade with a half sharpened secondary edge. The newer [[M9 bayonet]] has a clip-point blade with saw teeth along the spine, and can be used as a multi-purpose knife and wire-cutter when combined with its scabbard.

The magazine chosen to become the ''[[STANAG magazine]]'' was originally designed for the U.S. M16 rifle.

These 22&nbsp;mm grenade types range from anti-tank rounds to simple finned tubes with a fragmentation hand grenade attached to the end. They come in the \"standard\" type which are propelled by a blank cartridge inserted into the chamber of the rifle. They also come in the \"bullet trap\" and \"shoot through\" types, as their names imply, they use live ammunition.

The rail comprises a series of ridges with a T-shaped cross-section interspersed with flat \"spacing slots\". Scopes are mounted either by sliding them on from one end or the other; by means of a \"rail-grabber\" which is clamped to the rail with bolts, thumbscrews or levers; or onto the slots between the raised sections. The rail was originally for scopes. However, once established, the use of the system was expanded to other accessories, such as tactical lights, laser aiming modules, night vision devices, [[reflex sight]]s, foregrips, bipods, and bayonets.\n\nCurrently, the M16 is in use by 15 NATO countries and more than 80 countries worldwide.\n\n==ArmaLite AR-15==\n{{Main|ArmaLite AR-15}}\n[[File:ArmaLite AR-15 SPAR8367 DEC. 20. 2004.png|thumb|Early ArmaLite AR-15 without magazine or flash hider]]\n[[File:Colt ArmaLite AR-15 Model 01 SPAR1372 DEC. 22. 2004.jpg|thumb|Colt ArmaLite AR-15 Model 01 made from 1959\u20131964]]\n[[File:Colt ArmaLite AR-15 Model 02 SPAR1373 DEC. 22. 2004.jpg|thumb|Colt ArmaLite AR-15 Model 02 made in 1964]]\n\n===ArmaLite AR-15===\nThe weapon that eventually became the M16 series was basically a scaled down [[ArmaLite AR-10|AR-10]] with an [[Ambidexterity|ambidextrous]] charging handle located within the carrying handle, a narrower front sight \"A\" frame, and no flash suppressor.<ref name=\"SAOW2\"/>\n\n===Colt ArmaLite AR-15 (Models 601 & 602)===\nColt's first two models produced after the acquisition of the rifle from ArmaLite were the 601 and 602, and these rifles were in many ways clones of the original ArmaLite rifle (in fact, these rifles were often found stamped ''Colt ArmaLite AR-15, Property of the U.S. Government caliber .223'', with no reference to them being M16s).<ref name=\"SAOW2\"/> The 601 and 602 are easily identified by their flat lower receivers without raised surfaces around the magazine well and occasionally green or brown furniture. The 601 was adopted first of any of the rifles by the USAF, and was quickly supplemented with the XM16 (Colt Model 602) and later the M16 (Colt Model 604) as improvements were made. There was also a limited purchase of 602s, and a number of both of these rifles found their way to a number of Special Operations units then operating in South East Asia, most notably the [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEALs]]. The only major difference between the 601 and 602 is the switch from the original 1:14-inch rifling twist to the more common 1:12-inch twist. These weapons were equipped with a triangular charging handle and a bolt hold open device that lacked a raised lower engagement surface. The bolt hold open device had a slanted and serrated surface that had to be engaged with a bare thumb, index finger, or thumb nail because of the lack of this surface. The U.S. Air Force continued to use the ArmaLite AR-15 marked rifles in various configurations into the 1990s.\n\n==Variants==\n{{details|topic=M16 variants|List of Colt AR-15 and M16 rifle variants}}\n\n===M16===\n[[File:Armamento - Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n 05.JPG|thumb|An early M16 rifle without forward-assist.

The M16A1 was the finalized production model in 1967 and was produced until 1982.\n\nTo address issues raised by the XM16E1's testing cycle, a closed, bird-cage flash suppressor replaced the XM16E1's three-pronged flash suppressor which caught on twigs and leaves. Various other changes were made after numerous problems in the field. Cleaning kits were developed and issued while barrels with chrome-plated chambers and later fully lined bores were introduced.\n\nWith these and other changes, the malfunction rate slowly declined and new soldiers were generally unfamiliar with early problems. A rib was built into the side of the receiver on the XM16E1 to help prevent accidentally pressing the magazine release button while closing the ejection port cover. This rib was later extended on production M16A1s to help in preventing the magazine release from inadvertently being pressed. The hole in the bolt that accepts the cam pin was crimped inward on one side, in such a way that the cam pin may not be inserted with the bolt installed backwards, which would cause failures to eject until corrected. The M16A1 saw limited use in training capacities until the early 2000s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/Photos/newsphoto.aspx?newsphotoid=2931 |title=Defense.gov Photos : News Photo|date=1 March 2010|website=Defense.gov|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301153228/http://www.defense.gov/Photos/newsphoto.aspx?newsphotoid=2931|archivedate=1 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/photos/Jul2000/000716-F-6217S-015.html |title=Sgt.

It was officially adopted by the Department of Defense as the \"US Rifle, 5.56mm, M16A2\" in 1982. The Marines were the first branch of the U.S. Armed Forces to adopt it, in the early/mid-1980s, with the [[United States Army]] following suit in the late 1980s.\n\nModifications to the M16A2 were extensive. In addition to the new rifling, the barrel was made with a greater thickness in front of the front sight post, to resist bending in the field and to allow a longer period of sustained fire without overheating. The rest of the barrel was maintained at the original thickness to enable the [[M203 grenade launcher]] to be attached. A new adjustable rear sight was added, allowing the rear sight to be dialed in for specific range settings between 300 and 800 meters to take full advantage of the ballistic characteristics of the new SS109 rounds and to allow windage adjustments without the need of a tool or cartridge.<ref name=Venola>{{Cite journal |last1=Venola |first=Richard |title=What a Long Strange Trip It's Been |journal=Book of the AR-15 |volume=1 |issue=2 |year=2005 |pages=6\u201318 |ref=harv}}</ref> The weapon's reliability allowed it to be widely used around the Marine Corps' special operations divisions as well. The flash suppressor was again modified, this time to be closed on the bottom so it would not kick up dirt or snow when being fired from the prone position, and acting as a [[Muzzle brake|recoil compensator]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hogg|Weeks|2000|p=292}}</ref>\n\nThe front grip was modified from the original triangular shape to a round one, which better fit smaller hands and could be fitted to older models of the M16. The new handguards were also symmetrical so armories need not separate left- and right-hand spares. The handguard retention ring was tapered to make it easier to install and uninstall the handguards. A notch for the middle finger was added to the pistol grip, as well as more texture to enhance the grip. The buttstock was lengthened by {{convert|5/8|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Venola, Richard 2005\" /> The new buttstock became ten times stronger than the original due to advances in polymer technology since the early 1960s. Original M16 stocks were made from fiberglass-impregnated resin; the newer stocks were engineered from DuPont Zytel glass-filled thermoset polymers. The new stock included a fully textured polymer buttplate for better grip on the shoulder, and retained a panel for accessing a small compartment inside the stock, often used for storing a basic cleaning kit.

The XM177 had a shorter {{convert|10|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} barrel and a telescoping stock, which made it substantially more compact. It also possessed a combination flash hider/sound moderator to reduce problems with muzzle flash and loud report. The Air Force's GAU-5/A (XM177) and the Army's XM177E1 variants differed over the latter's inclusion of a forward assist, although some GAU-5s do have the forward assist. The final Air Force GAU-5/A and Army XM177E2 had an {{convert|11.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} barrel with a longer flash/sound suppressor. The lengthening of the barrel was to support the attachment of Colt's own [[XM148 grenade launcher|XM148]] 40&nbsp;mm grenade launcher. These versions were also known as the Colt Commando model commonly referenced and marketed as the CAR-15. The variants were issued in limited numbers to special forces, helicopter crews, Air Force pilots, Air Force Security Police Military Working Dog (MWD) handlers, officers, radio operators, artillerymen, and troops other than front line riflemen. Some USAF GAU-5A/As were later equipped with even longer {{convert|14.5|in|mm|adj=on}} 1/12 rifled barrels as the two shorter versions were worn out. The {{convert|14.5|in|mm|adj=on}} barrel allowed the use of MILES gear and for bayonets to be used with the sub-machine guns (as the Air Force described them). By 1989, the Air Force started to replace the earlier barrels with 1/7 rifled models for use with the M855-round. The weapons were given the redesignation of GUU-5/P.\n\nThese were effectively used by the British [[Special Air Service]] during the [[Falklands War]].<ref name=special_operations1 />\n\n===M4 carbine===\n{{Main|M4 carbine}}\n[[File:SCRange20034344940.jpg|thumb|right|An [[M4 carbine#M4A1|M4A1 carbine]] (foreground) and two M16A2s (background) being fired by U.S. Marines during a [[live fire exercise]]: though adopted in the 1990s and derived from the M16A2, the M4 carbine was part of a long line of short-barreled [[AR-15]] used in the U.S. military]]\n\nThe M4 carbine was developed from various outgrowths of these designs, including a number of {{convert|14.5|in|mm|0|adj=on}}-barreled A1 style carbines. The XM4 (Colt Model 720) started its trials in 1984, with a barrel of {{convert|14.5|in|mm}}. The weapon became the M4 in 1991. Officially adopted as a replacement for the [[M3 submachine gun|M3 \"Grease Gun\"]] (and the [[M9 pistol|Beretta M9]] and M16A2 for select troops) in 1994, it was used with great success in the Balkans and in more recent conflicts, including the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] theaters. The M4 carbine has a three-round [[Burst mode (firearm)|burst]] firing mode, while the M4A1 carbine has a [[Automatic firearm|fully automatic]] firing mode. Both have a [[Picatinny rail]] on the upper receiver, allowing the carry handle/rear sight assembly to be replaced with other sighting devices.\n\n====M4 Commando====\n{{Main|CAR-15}}\nColt also returned to the original \"[[CAR-15|Commando]]\" idea, with its Model 733, essentially a modernized XM177E2 with many of the features introduced on the M16A2.\n\n===Diemaco C7 and C8===\n{{Main|Colt Canada C7 rifle}}\n[[File:Canadian C7A2 Rifle.JPG|thumb|A Canadian soldier fires the current issue C7A2 rifle at the range with a [[C79 optical sight|C79]]A2 sight. This particular example is missing the standard TRIAD mount.]]\n\nThe [[Diemaco]] [[Colt Canada C7 rifle|C7]] and C8 are updated variants of the M16 developed and used by the [[Canadian Forces]] and are now manufactured by [[Colt Canada]]. The C7 is a further development of the experimental M16A1E1. Like earlier M16s, it can be fired in either semi-automatic or automatic mode, instead of the burst function selected for the M16A2. The C7 also features the structural strengthening, improved handguards, and longer stock developed for the M16A2. Diemaco changed the trapdoor in the buttstock to make it easier to access and a spacer of {{convert|0.5|in|mm}} is available to adjust stock length to user preference. The most easily noticeable external difference between American M16A2s and Diemaco C7s is the retention of the A1 style rear sights. Not easily apparent is Diemaco's use of hammer-forged barrels. The Canadians originally desired to use a heavy barrel profile instead.\n\nThe C7 has been developed to the C7A1, with a [[Weaver rail]] on the upper receiver for a C79 optical sight, and to the C7A2, with different furniture and internal improvements. The Diemaco produced Weaver rail on the original C7A1 variants does not meet the M1913 \"Picatinny\" standard, leading to some problems with mounting commercial sights. This is easily remedied with minor modification to the upper receiver or the sight itself. Since Diemaco's acquisition by Colt to form Colt Canada, all Canadian produced flattop upper receivers are machined to the M1913 standard.\n\nThe C8 is the carbine version of the C7.<ref>[http://www.casr.ca/101-army-smallarm-1.htm Canadian Forces Automatic Rifles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706171606/http://casr.ca/101-army-smallarm-1.htm |date=6 July 2011}}.

It is based on the M16, and was originally conceived as an improvement based on the Colt [[M4 carbine]] family issued to the U.S. military, with the notable inclusion of an HK-proprietary short-stroke gas piston system derived from the [[Heckler & Koch G36]]. The HK416 was used by U.S. Navy SEALs to kill [[Osama bin Laden]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/g536/face-time-with-the-hk416-the-gun-that-killed-bin-laden/ |title=Face Time With the HK416 \u2013 The Gun That Killed Bin Laden|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508032802/http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/g536/face-time-with-the-hk416-the-gun-that-killed-bin-laden/ |archivedate=8 May 2017 | work=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=20 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/washington-whispers/articles/2011/05/11/the-gun-that-killed-osama-bin-laden-revealed|title=The Gun That Killed Osama bin Laden Revealed |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626012337/http://www.usnews.com/news/washington-whispers/articles/2011/05/11/the-gun-that-killed-osama-bin-laden-revealed |archivedate=26 June 2011|work=U.S. News |date=11 May 2011|accessdate=2015-11-20|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Mk 4 Mod 0===\nThe Mk 4 Mod 0 was a variant of the M16A1 produced for the U.S. Navy SEALs during the Vietnam War and adopted in April 1970. It differed from the basic M16A1 primarily in being optimized for maritime operations and coming equipped with a sound suppressor. Most of the operating parts of the rifle were coated in [[Kal-Guard]], a hole of {{convert|0.25|in|mm}} was drilled through the stock and buffer tube for drainage, and an O-ring was added to the end of the buffer assembly. The weapon could reportedly be carried to the depth of 200 feet (60&nbsp;m) in water without damage. The initial Mk 2 Mod 0 Blast Suppressor was based on the U.S. Army's Human Engineering Lab's (HEL) M4 noise suppressor. The HEL M4 vented gas directly from the action, requiring a modified bolt carrier. A gas deflector was added to the charging handle to prevent gas from contacting the user. Thus, the HEL M4 suppressor was permanently mounted though it allowed normal semi-automatic and automatic operation. If the HEL M4 suppressor were removed, the weapon would have to be manually loaded after each single shot. On the other hand, the Mk 2 Mod 0 blast suppressor was considered an integral part of the Mk 4 Mod 0 rifle, but it would function normally if the suppressor were removed. The Mk 2 Mod 0 blast suppressor also drained water much more quickly and did not require any modification to the bolt carrier or to the charging handle. In the late 1970s, the Mk 2 Mod 0 blast suppressor was replaced by the Mk 2 blast suppressor made by Knight's Armament Company (KAC). The KAC suppressor can be fully submerged and water will drain out in less than eight seconds. It will operate without degradation even if the rifle is fired at the maximum rate of fire. The U.S. Army replaced the HEL M4 with the much simpler Studies in Operational Negation of Insurgency and Counter-Subversion (SIONICS) MAW-A1 noise and flash suppressor.\n\n===US Navy Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle===\n{{Main|Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle}}\n[[File:SPRCrane.jpg|thumb|US Navy Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle]]\n\nDeveloped to increase the effective range of soldiers in the designated marksman role, the U.S. Navy developed the Mark 12 Special Purpose Rifle (SPR). Configurations in service vary, but the core of the Mark 12 SPR is an 18\" heavy barrel with muzzle brake and free float tube. This tube relieves pressure on the barrel caused by standard handguards and greatly increases the potential accuracy of the system. Also common are higher magnification optics ranging from the 6\u00d7 power Trijicon ACOG to the Leupold Mark 4 Tactical rifle scopes. Firing Mark 262 Mod 0 ammunition with a 77gr Open tip Match bullet, the system has an official effective range of 600+ meters. However published reports of confirmed kills beyond 800&nbsp;m from Iraq and Afghanistan are not uncommon.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n===M231 Firing Port Weapon (FPW)===\n[[File:M231 1.svg|thumb|right|M231 FPW]]\n\nThe [[M231 Firing Port Weapon]] (FPW) is an adapted version of the M16 assault rifle for firing from [[Firing port|ports]] on the [[M2 Bradley]]. The infantry's normal M16s are too long for use in a \"buttoned up\" fighting vehicle, so the FPW was developed to provide a suitable weapon for this role.\n\n===Colt Model 655 and 656 \"Sniper\" variants===\nWith the expanding [[Vietnam War]], Colt developed two rifles of the M16 pattern for evaluation as possible light sniper or designated marksman rifles. The Colt Model 655 M16A1 Special High Profile was essentially a standard A1 rifle with a heavier barrel and a scope bracket that attached to the rifle's carry handle. The Colt Model 656 M16A1 Special Low Profile had a special upper receiver with no carrying handle. Instead, it had a low-profile iron sight adjustable for windage and a Weaver base for mounting a scope, a precursor to the Colt and Picatinny rails. It also had a hooded front iron sight in addition to the heavy barrel. Both rifles came standard with either a Leatherwood/Realist scope 3\u20139\u00d7 Adjustable Ranging Telescope. Some of them were fitted with a Sionics noise and flash suppressor. Neither of these rifles were ever standardized.\n\nThese weapons can be seen in many ways to be predecessors of the U.S. Army's [[United States Army Squad Designated Marksman Rifle|SDM-R]] and the USMC's [[U.S. Marine Corps Squad Advanced Marksman Rifle|SAM-R]] weapons.\n\n===Others===\n* The Chinese [[Norinco CQ]] is an unlicensed derivative of the M16A1 made specifically for export, with the most obvious external differences being in its handguard and [[revolver]]-style pistol grip.\n** The '''ARMADA rifle''' (a copy of the Norinco CQ) and '''TRAILBLAZER carbine''' (a copy of the Norinco CQ Type A) are manufactured by S.A.M. \u2013 Shooter's Arms Manufacturing, a.k.a.

Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent any [[space]], real or fictional, without regard to [[Context (language use)|context]] or [[Scale (map)|scale]], such as in [[brain mapping]], [[DNA]] mapping, or computer network topology mapping. The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as the surface of the earth, three dimensional, such as the interior of the earth, or even more abstract spaces of any dimension, such as arise in modeling phenomena having many independent variables.\n\nAlthough the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times. The word \"map\" comes from the medieval Latin ''Mappa mundi'', wherein ''mappa'' meant napkin or cloth and ''mundi'' the world. Thus, \"map\" became the shortened term referring to a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the world.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of cartography}}\n==Geographic maps==\n\n[[File:Planisph\u00e6ri c\u0153leste.jpg|thumb|A celestial map from the 17th century, by the  cartographer [[Frederik de Wit]]]]\n\n[[Cartography]] or ''map-making'' is the study and practice of crafting representations of the Earth upon a flat surface (see [[History of cartography]]), and one who makes maps is called a [[cartography|cartographer]].\n\n[[Road atlas|Road maps]] are perhaps the most widely used maps today, and form a subset of navigational maps, which also include aeronautical and [[nautical chart]]s, railroad network maps, and hiking and bicycling maps. In terms of quantity, the largest number of drawn map sheets is probably made up by local surveys, carried out by [[municipality|municipalities]], utilities, tax assessors, emergency services providers, and other local agencies.  Many national surveying projects have been carried out by the military, such as the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Ordnance Survey]]: a civilian government agency, internationally renowned for its comprehensively detailed work.\n\nIn addition to location information, maps may also be used to portray [[contour line]]s indicating constant values of [[elevation]], [[temperature]], [[rain]]fall, etc.\n\n==Orientation of maps==\n[[File:Hereford Mappa Mundi 1300.jpg|thumb|''The [[Hereford Mappa Mundi]]'' from about 1300, [[Hereford Cathedral]], England, is a classic \"T-O\" map with Jerusalem at centre, east toward the top, Europe the bottom left and Africa on the right.]]\nThe orientation of a map is the relationship between the directions on the map and the corresponding [[compass direction]]s in reality. The word \"[[orient]]\" is derived from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|oriens}}, meaning east. In the [[Middle Ages]] many maps, including the [[T and O map]]s, were drawn with east at the top (meaning that the direction \"up\" on the map corresponds to East on the compass). The most common cartographic convention, is that north is at the top of a map.\n\nMaps not oriented with north at the top:\n* Maps from non-Western traditions are oriented a variety of ways. Old maps of [[Edo]] show the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Japanese imperial palace]] as the \"top\", but also at the centre, of the map. Labels on the map are oriented in such a way that you cannot read them properly unless you put the imperial palace above your head.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n* [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] European [[T and O map]]s such as the [[Hereford Mappa Mundi]] were centred on [[Jerusalem]] with East at the top. Indeed, prior to the reintroduction of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia|Geography]]'' to Europe around 1400, there was no single convention in the West. [[Portolan chart]]s, for example, are oriented to the shores they describe.\n* Maps of cities bordering a sea are often conventionally oriented with the sea at the top.\n* Route and channel maps have traditionally been oriented to the road or waterway they describe.\n* [[Azimuthal equidistant projection|Polar maps]] of the [[Arctic]] or [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] regions are conventionally centred on the pole; the direction North would be towards or away from the centre of the map, respectively. Typical maps of the Arctic have 0\u00b0 meridian towards the bottom of the page; maps of the Antarctic have the 0\u00b0 meridian towards the top of the page.\n* [[Reversed map]]s, also known as ''Upside-Down maps'' or ''South-Up maps'', reverse the ''North is up'' convention and have south at the top. Ancient Africans including in [[Ancient Egypt]] utilised this orientation, as some maps in Brazil do today.<ref>[http://en.lisapoyakama.org/the-orientation-of-the-world-in-the-african-thought/ The orientation of the world in the African thought]</ref>\n* [[Buckminster Fuller]]'s [[Dymaxion map]]s are based on a projection of the Earth's [[sphere]] onto an [[icosahedron]]. The resulting triangular pieces may be arranged in any order or orientation.\n\n==Scale and accuracy==\n{{Main|Scale (map)}}\nMany maps are drawn to a [[Scale (map)|scale]] expressed as a [[ratio]], such as 1:10,000, which means that 1 unit of [[measurement]] on the map corresponds to 10,000 of that same unit on the ground. The scale statement can be accurate when the region mapped is small enough for the [[curvature]] of the Earth to be neglected, such as a [[city map]]. Mapping larger regions, where curvature cannot be ignored, requires [[map projection|projections]] to map from the curved surface of the Earth to the plane. The impossibility of flattening the [[sphere]] to the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] without distortion means that the map cannot have constant scale. Rather, on most projections the best that can be attained is accurate scale along one or two paths on the projection. Because scale differs everywhere, it can only be measured meaningfully as [[scale (map)|point scale]] per location. Most maps strive to keep point scale variation within narrow bounds. Although the scale statement is nominal it is usually accurate enough for most purposes unless the map covers a large fraction of the earth. At the scope of a world map, scale as a single number is practically meaningless throughout most of the map. Instead, it usually refers to the scale along the equator.\n\n[[File:EU Pop2008 1024.PNG|thumb|Cartogram: The [[European Union|EU]] distorted to show population distributions as of 2008.]]\nSome maps, called [[cartogram]]s, have the scale deliberately distorted to reflect information other than land area or distance. For example, this map (at the right) of [[Europe]] has been distorted to show population distribution, while the rough shape of the continent is still discernible.\n\nAnother example of distorted scale is the famous [[Tube map|London Underground map]]. The basic geographical structure is respected but the tube lines (and the [[River Thames]]) are smoothed to clarify the relationships between stations. Near the center of the map stations are spaced out more than near the edges of map.\n\nFurther inaccuracies may be deliberate. For example, cartographers may simply omit military installations or remove features solely in order to enhance the clarity of the map. For example, a road map may not show railroads, smaller waterways or other prominent non-road objects, and even if it does, it may show them less clearly (e.g. dashed or dotted lines/outlines) than the main roads. Known as decluttering, the practice makes the subject matter that the user is interested in easier to read, usually without sacrificing overall accuracy. Software-based maps often allow the user to toggle decluttering between ON, OFF and AUTO as needed. In AUTO the degree of decluttering is adjusted as the user changes the scale being displayed.\n\n==Map projection==\n{{Main|Map projection}}\nGeographic maps use a [[map projection|projection]] to translating the three-dimensional real surface of the [[geoid]] to a two-dimensional picture. Projection always distorts the surface. There are many ways to apportion the distortion, and so there are many map projections. Which projection to use depends on the purpose of the map.\n\n==Symbology==\nThe various features shown on a map are represented by conventional [[sign]]s or symbols.  For example, colors can be used to indicate a classification of roads.  Those signs are usually explained in the margin of the map, or on a separately published characteristic sheet.<ref>Ordnance Survey, [https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/legends/25k-raster-legend.pdf Explorer Map Symbols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403185303/https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/legends/25k-raster-legend.pdf |date=3 April 2016 }}; Swisstopo, [http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/products/maps/leisure/hiking.parsysrelated1.96279.downloadList.81398.DownloadFile.tmp/symbolsen.pdf Conventional Signs]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528053109/http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/products/maps/leisure/hiking.parsysrelated1.96279.downloadList.81398.DownloadFile.tmp/symbolsen.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }}; United States Geological Survey, [http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/symbols/ Topographic Map Symbols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601185821/http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/symbols/ |date=1 June 2008 }}.</ref>\n\nSome cartographers prefer to make the map cover practically the entire screen or sheet of paper, leaving no room \"outside\" the map for information about the map as a whole.\nThese cartographers typically place such information in an otherwise \"blank\" region \"inside\" the map{{mdash}}[[cartouche (cartography)|cartouche]], [[legend (map)|map legend]], title, [[compass rose]], [[bar scale]], etc.\nIn particular, some maps contain smaller \"sub-maps\"<!-- is there a better term? --> in otherwise blank regions\u2014often one at a much smaller scale showing the whole globe and where the whole map fits on that globe, and a few showing \"regions of interest\" at a larger scale in order to show details that wouldn't otherwise fit.\nOccasionally sub-maps use the same scale as the large map\u2014a few maps of the [[contiguous United States]] include a sub-map<!-- is there a better term? --> to the same scale for each of the two non-contiguous states.\n\n===Labeling===\nTo communicate spatial information effectively, features such as rivers, lakes, and cities need to be [[Labeling (map design)|labeled]]. Over centuries cartographers have developed the art of placing names on even the densest of maps. Text placement or name placement can get mathematically very complex as the number of labels and map density increases. Therefore, text placement is time-consuming and labor-intensive, so cartographers and GIS users have developed [[automatic label placement]] to ease this process.<ref>Imhof, E., \u201cDie Anordnung der Namen in der Karte,\u201d Annuaire International de Cartographie II, Orell-F\u00fcssli Verlag, Z\u00fcrich, 93\u2013129, 1962.</ref><ref>Freeman, H., Map data processing and the annotation problem, Proc. 3rd Scandinavian Conf. on Image Analysis, Chartwell-Bratt Ltd.

(1995, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]])]]\nMaps of the world or large areas are often either 'political' or 'physical'. The most important purpose of the political map is to show territorial [[border]]s; the purpose of the physical is to show features of [[geography]] such as mountains, soil type or land use including infrastructure such as roads, railroads and buildings. [[Topographic map]]s show [[elevation]]s and [[Terrain|relief]] with [[contour line]]s or shading. [[Geological map]]s show not only the physical surface, but characteristics of the underlying rock, [[fault (geology)|fault]] lines, and subsurface structures.\n\n===Electronic maps===<!-- Electronic map redirects here -->\n[[File:Topographic map example.png|thumb|A [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] [[digital raster graphic]].]]\nFrom the last quarter of the 20th century, the indispensable tool of the [[cartographer]] has been the computer. Much of cartography, especially at the data-gathering [[surveying|survey]] level, has been subsumed by [[geographic information system|Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS). The functionality of maps has been greatly advanced by technology simplifying the superimposition of spatially located variables onto existing geographical maps. Having local information such as rainfall level, distribution of wildlife, or demographic data integrated within the map allows more efficient analysis and better decision making. In the pre-electronic age such [[superimposition]] of data led [[John Snow (physician)|Dr. John Snow]] to identify the location of an outbreak of [[cholera]]. Today, it is used by agencies of the human kind, as diverse as wildlife conservationists and militaries around the world.\n\n[[File:Maps-for-free Sierra Nevada.png|thumb|Relief map Sierra Nevada]]\n\nEven when GIS is not involved, most cartographers now use a variety of computer graphics programs to generate new maps.\n\nInteractive, computerised maps are commercially available, allowing users to ''zoom in'' or ''zoom out'' (respectively meaning to increase or decrease the scale), sometimes by replacing one map with another of different scale, centered where possible on the same point.  In-car [[global navigation satellite system]]s are computerised maps with route-planning and advice facilities which monitor the user's position with the help of satellites. From the computer scientist's point of view, zooming in entails one or a combination of:\n\n# replacing the map by a more detailed one\n# enlarging the same map without enlarging the [[pixel]]s, hence showing more detail by removing less information compared to the less detailed version\n# enlarging the same map with the pixels enlarged (replaced by rectangles of pixels); no additional detail is shown, but, depending on the quality of one's vision, possibly more detail can be seen; if a computer display does not show adjacent pixels really separate, but overlapping instead (this does not apply for an [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]], but may apply for a [[cathode ray tube]]), then replacing a pixel by a rectangle of pixels does show more detail.  A variation of this method is [[interpolation]].\n\n[[File:World.pdf|thumb|A world map in PDF format.]]\n\nFor example:\n* Typically (2) applies to a [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) file or other format based on [[vector graphics]]. The increase in detail is limited to the information contained in the file: enlargement of a curve may eventually result in a series of standard geometric figures such as straight lines, arcs of circles or [[spline (mathematics)|splines]].\n* (2) may apply to text and (3) to the outline of a map feature such as a forest or building.\n* (1) may apply to the text as needed (displaying labels for more features), while (2) applies to the rest of the image.  Text is not necessarily enlarged when zooming in. Similarly, a road represented by a double line may or may not become wider when one zooms in.\n* The map may also have layers which are partly [[raster graphics]] and partly [[vector graphics]].  For a single raster graphics image (2) applies until the pixels in the image file correspond to the pixels of the display, thereafter (3) applies.\n\n''See also: [[Webpage#Graphics|Webpage (Graphics)]], [[Portable Document Format#Layers|PDF (Layers)]], [[MapQuest]], [[Google Maps]], [[Google Earth]], [[OpenStreetMap]] or [[Yahoo! Maps]].''\n\n===Climatic maps===\nThe maps that reflect the territorial distribution of climatic conditions based on the results of long-term observations are called climatic maps. These maps can be compiled both for individual climatic features (temperature, precipitation, humidity) and for combinations of them at the earth's surface and in the upper layers of the atmosphere. Climatic maps show climatic features across a large region and permit values of climatic features to be compared in different parts of the region. When generating the map, [[interpolation]] can be used to synthesize values where there are no measurements, under the assumption that conditions change smoothly.\n\nClimatic maps generally apply to individual months and to the year as a whole, sometimes to the four seasons, to the growing period, and so forth. On maps compiled from the observations of ground meteorological stations, atmospheric pressure is converted to sea level. Air temperature maps are compiled both from the actual values observed on the surface of the earth and from values converted to sea level. The pressure field in free atmosphere is represented either by maps of the distribution of pressure at different standard altitudes\u2014for example, at every kilometer above sea level\u2014or by maps of baric topography on which altitudes (more precisely geopotentials) of the main isobaric surfaces (for example, 900, 800, and 700 millibars) counted off from sea level are plotted. The temperature, humidity, and wind on aeroclimatic maps may apply either to standard altitudes or to the main isobaric surfaces.\n\nIsolines are drawn on maps of such climatic features as the long-term mean values (of atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, total precipitation, and so forth) to connect points with equal values of the feature in question\u2014for example, isobars for pressure, isotherms for temperature, and isohyets for precipitation. Isoamplitudes are drawn on maps of amplitudes (for example, annual amplitudes of air temperature\u2014that is, the differences between the mean temperatures of the warmest and coldest month). Isanomals are drawn on maps of anomalies (for example, deviations of the mean temperature of each place from the mean temperature of the entire latitudinal zone). Isolines of frequency are drawn on maps showing the frequency of a particular phenomenon (for example, annual number of days with a thunderstorm or snow cover). Isochrones are drawn on maps showing the dates of onset of a given phenomenon (for example, the first frost and appearance or disappearance of the snow cover) or the date of a particular value of a meteorological element in the course of a year (for example, passing of the mean daily air temperature through zero). Isolines of the mean numerical value of wind velocity or isotachs are drawn on wind maps (charts); the wind resultants and directions of prevailing winds are indicated by arrows of different length or arrows with different plumes; lines of flow are often drawn. Maps of the zonal and meridional components of wind are frequently compiled for the free atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure and wind are usually combined on climatic maps. Wind roses, curves showing the distribution of other meteorological elements, diagrams of the annual course of elements at individual stations, and the like are also plotted on climatic maps.\n\nMaps of climatic regionalization, that is, division of the earth's surface into climatic zones and regions according to some classification of climates, are a special kind of climatic map.\n\nClimatic maps are often incorporated into climatic atlases of varying geographic range (globe, hemispheres, continents, countries, oceans) or included in comprehensive atlases. Besides general climatic maps, applied climatic maps and atlases have great practical value. Aeroclimatic maps, aeroclimatic atlases, and agroclimatic maps are the most numerous.\n\n===Non-geographical spatial maps===\nMaps exist of the [[Solar System]], and other cosmological features such as [[star map]]s. In addition maps of other bodies such as the Moon and other planets are technically not ''[[geospatial|geo]]''graphical maps.\n\n===Topological maps===\n[[File:Inventory Locations Represented as a Map.png|thumb|upright=1.3|In a [[topological map]], like this one showing inventory locations, the distances between locations is not important. Only the layout and connectivity between them matters.]]\nDiagrams such as [[schematic diagram]]s and [[Gantt chart]]s and [[treemap]]s display logical relationships between items, rather than geographical relationships. [[Topological]] in nature, only the connectivity is significant. The [[London Underground map]] and similar subway maps around the world are a common example of these maps.\n\n===General-purpose maps===\nGeneral-purpose maps provide many types of information on one map. Most atlas maps, wall maps, and road maps fall into this category. The following are some features that might be shown on general-purpose maps: bodies of water, roads, railway lines, parks, elevations, towns and cities, political boundaries, latitude and longitude, national and provincial parks. These maps give a broad understanding of location and features of an area.  The reader may gain an understanding of the type of landscape, the location of urban places, and the location of major transportation routes all at once.\n\n===List of map types===\n* [[Atlas]]\n* [[Cadastre#Cadastral map|Cadastral map]]\n* [[#Climatic maps|Climatic map]]\n* [[Geologic map]]\n* [[Nautical map]]\n* [[#Map types and projections|Physical map]]\n* [[Political map]]\n* [[Terrain cartography|Relief map]]\n* [[Resource map]]\n* [[Star map]]\n* [[Street map]]\n* [[Thematic map]]\n\n* [[Topographic map]]\n* [[Weather map]]\n* [[World map]]\n\n==Legal regulation==\nSome countries required that all published maps represent their national claims regarding [[border dispute]]s.

Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent any [[space]], real or fictional, without regard to [[Context (language use)|context]] or [[Scale (map)|scale]], such as in [[brain mapping]], [[DNA]] mapping, or computer network topology mapping. The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as the surface of the earth, three dimensional, such as the interior of the earth, or even more abstract spaces of any dimension, such as arise in modeling phenomena having many independent variables.\n\nAlthough the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times. The word \"map\" comes from the medieval Latin ''Mappa mundi'', wherein ''mappa'' meant napkin or cloth and ''mundi'' the world. Thus, \"map\" became the shortened term referring to a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the world.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of cartography}}\n[[File:TabulaRogeriana upside-down.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad al-Idrisi]]'s ''[[Tabula Rogeriana]]'' (1154), one of the most advanced [[early world maps]].]]\n\n==Geographic maps==\n\n[[File:Planisph\u00e6ri c\u0153leste.jpg|thumb|A celestial map from the 17th century, by the  cartographer [[Frederik de Wit]]]]\n\n[[Cartography]] or ''map-making'' is the study and practice of crafting representations of the Earth upon a flat surface (see [[History of cartography]]), and one who makes maps is called a [[cartography|cartographer]].\n\n[[Road atlas|Road maps]] are perhaps the most widely used maps today, and form a subset of navigational maps, which also include aeronautical and [[nautical chart]]s, railroad network maps, and hiking and bicycling maps. In terms of quantity, the largest number of drawn map sheets is probably made up by local surveys, carried out by [[municipality|municipalities]], utilities, tax assessors, emergency services providers, and other local agencies.  Many national surveying projects have been carried out by the military, such as the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Ordnance Survey]]: a civilian government agency, internationally renowned for its comprehensively detailed work.\n\nIn addition to location information, maps may also be used to portray [[contour line]]s indicating constant values of [[elevation]], [[temperature]], [[rain]]fall, etc.\n\n==Orientation of maps==\n[[File:Hereford Mappa Mundi 1300.jpg|thumb|''The [[Hereford Mappa Mundi]]'' from about 1300, [[Hereford Cathedral]], England, is a classic \"T-O\" map with Jerusalem at centre, east toward the top, Europe the bottom left and Africa on the right.]]\nThe orientation of a map is the relationship between the directions on the map and the corresponding [[compass direction]]s in reality. The word \"[[orient]]\" is derived from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|oriens}}, meaning east. In the [[Middle Ages]] many maps, including the [[T and O map]]s, were drawn with east at the top (meaning that the direction \"up\" on the map corresponds to East on the compass). The most common cartographic convention, is that north is at the top of a map.\n\nMaps not oriented with north at the top:\n* Maps from non-Western traditions are oriented a variety of ways. Old maps of [[Edo]] show the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Japanese imperial palace]] as the \"top\", but also at the centre, of the map. Labels on the map are oriented in such a way that you cannot read them properly unless you put the imperial palace above your head.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n* [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] European [[T and O map]]s such as the [[Hereford Mappa Mundi]] were centred on [[Jerusalem]] with East at the top. Indeed, prior to the reintroduction of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia|Geography]]'' to Europe around 1400, there was no single convention in the West. [[Portolan chart]]s, for example, are oriented to the shores they describe.\n* Maps of cities bordering a sea are often conventionally oriented with the sea at the top.\n* Route and channel maps have traditionally been oriented to the road or waterway they describe.\n* [[Azimuthal equidistant projection|Polar maps]] of the [[Arctic]] or [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] regions are conventionally centred on the pole; the direction North would be towards or away from the centre of the map, respectively. Typical maps of the Arctic have 0\u00b0 meridian towards the bottom of the page; maps of the Antarctic have the 0\u00b0 meridian towards the top of the page.\n* [[Reversed map]]s, also known as ''Upside-Down maps'' or ''South-Up maps'', reverse the ''North is up'' convention and have south at the top. Ancient Africans including in [[Ancient Egypt]] utilised this orientation, as some maps in Brazil do today.<ref>[http://en.lisapoyakama.org/the-orientation-of-the-world-in-the-african-thought/ The orientation of the world in the African thought]</ref>\n* [[Buckminster Fuller]]'s [[Dymaxion map]]s are based on a projection of the Earth's [[sphere]] onto an [[icosahedron]]. The resulting triangular pieces may be arranged in any order or orientation.\n\n==Scale and accuracy==\n{{Main|Scale (map)}}\nMany maps are drawn to a [[Scale (map)|scale]] expressed as a [[ratio]], such as 1:10,000, which means that 1 unit of [[measurement]] on the map corresponds to 10,000 of that same unit on the ground. The scale statement can be accurate when the region mapped is small enough for the [[curvature]] of the Earth to be neglected, such as a [[city map]]. Mapping larger regions, where curvature cannot be ignored, requires [[map projection|projections]] to map from the curved surface of the Earth to the plane. The impossibility of flattening the [[sphere]] to the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] without distortion means that the map cannot have constant scale. Rather, on most projections the best that can be attained is accurate scale along one or two paths on the projection. Because scale differs everywhere, it can only be measured meaningfully as [[scale (map)|point scale]] per location. Most maps strive to keep point scale variation within narrow bounds. Although the scale statement is nominal it is usually accurate enough for most purposes unless the map covers a large fraction of the earth. At the scope of a world map, scale as a single number is practically meaningless throughout most of the map. Instead, it usually refers to the scale along the equator.\n\n[[File:EU Pop2008 1024.PNG|thumb|Cartogram: The [[European Union|EU]] distorted to show population distributions as of 2008.]]\nSome maps, called [[cartogram]]s, have the scale deliberately distorted to reflect information other than land area or distance. For example, this map (at the right) of [[Europe]] has been distorted to show population distribution, while the rough shape of the continent is still discernible.\n\nAnother example of distorted scale is the famous [[Tube map|London Underground map]]. The basic geographical structure is respected but the tube lines (and the [[River Thames]]) are smoothed to clarify the relationships between stations. Near the center of the map stations are spaced out more than near the edges of map.\n\nFurther inaccuracies may be deliberate. For example, cartographers may simply omit military installations or remove features solely in order to enhance the clarity of the map. For example, a road map may not show railroads, smaller waterways or other prominent non-road objects, and even if it does, it may show them less clearly (e.g. dashed or dotted lines/outlines) than the main roads. Known as decluttering, the practice makes the subject matter that the user is interested in easier to read, usually without sacrificing overall accuracy. Software-based maps often allow the user to toggle decluttering between ON, OFF and AUTO as needed. In AUTO the degree of decluttering is adjusted as the user changes the scale being displayed.\n\n==Map projection==\n{{Main|Map projection}}\nGeographic maps use a [[map projection|projection]] to translating the three-dimensional real surface of the [[geoid]] to a two-dimensional picture. Projection always distorts the surface. There are many ways to apportion the distortion, and so there are many map projections. Which projection to use depends on the purpose of the map.\n\n==Symbology==\nThe various features shown on a map are represented by conventional [[sign]]s or symbols.  For example, colors can be used to indicate a classification of roads.  Those signs are usually explained in the margin of the map, or on a separately published characteristic sheet.<ref>Ordnance Survey, [https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/legends/25k-raster-legend.pdf Explorer Map Symbols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403185303/https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/legends/25k-raster-legend.pdf |date=3 April 2016 }}; Swisstopo, [http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/products/maps/leisure/hiking.parsysrelated1.96279.downloadList.81398.DownloadFile.tmp/symbolsen.pdf Conventional Signs]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528053109/http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/products/maps/leisure/hiking.parsysrelated1.96279.downloadList.81398.DownloadFile.tmp/symbolsen.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }}; United States Geological Survey, [http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/symbols/ Topographic Map Symbols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601185821/http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/symbols/ |date=1 June 2008 }}.</ref>\n\nSome cartographers prefer to make the map cover practically the entire screen or sheet of paper, leaving no room \"outside\" the map for information about the map as a whole.\nThese cartographers typically place such information in an otherwise \"blank\" region \"inside\" the map{{mdash}}[[cartouche (cartography)|cartouche]], [[legend (map)|map legend]], title, [[compass rose]], [[bar scale]], etc.\nIn particular, some maps contain smaller \"sub-maps\"<!-- is there a better term? --> in otherwise blank regions\u2014often one at a much smaller scale showing the whole globe and where the whole map fits on that globe, and a few showing \"regions of interest\" at a larger scale in order to show details that wouldn't otherwise fit.\nOccasionally sub-maps use the same scale as the large map\u2014a few maps of the [[contiguous United States]] include a sub-map<!-- is there a better term? --> to the same scale for each of the two non-contiguous states.\n\n===Labeling===\nTo communicate spatial information effectively, features such as rivers, lakes, and cities need to be [[Labeling (map design)|labeled]]. Over centuries cartographers have developed the art of placing names on even the densest of maps. Text placement or name placement can get mathematically very complex as the number of labels and map density increases. Therefore, text placement is time-consuming and labor-intensive, so cartographers and GIS users have developed [[automatic label placement]] to ease this process.<ref>Imhof, E., \u201cDie Anordnung der Namen in der Karte,\u201d Annuaire International de Cartographie II, Orell-F\u00fcssli Verlag, Z\u00fcrich, 93\u2013129, 1962.</ref><ref>Freeman, H., Map data processing and the annotation problem, Proc. 3rd Scandinavian Conf. on Image Analysis, Chartwell-Bratt Ltd.

These maps can be compiled both for individual climatic features (temperature, precipitation, humidity) and for combinations of them at the earth's surface and in the upper layers of the atmosphere. Climatic maps show climatic features across a large region and permit values of climatic features to be compared in different parts of the region. When generating the map, [[interpolation]] can be used to synthesize values where there are no measurements, under the assumption that conditions change smoothly.\n\nClimatic maps generally apply to individual months and to the year as a whole, sometimes to the four seasons, to the growing period, and so forth. On maps compiled from the observations of ground meteorological stations, atmospheric pressure is converted to sea level. Air temperature maps are compiled both from the actual values observed on the surface of the earth and from values converted to sea level. The pressure field in free atmosphere is represented either by maps of the distribution of pressure at different standard altitudes\u2014for example, at every kilometer above sea level\u2014or by maps of baric topography on which altitudes (more precisely geopotentials) of the main isobaric surfaces (for example, 900, 800, and 700 millibars) counted off from sea level are plotted. The temperature, humidity, and wind on aeroclimatic maps may apply either to standard altitudes or to the main isobaric surfaces.\n\nIsolines are drawn on maps of such climatic features as the long-term mean values (of atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, total precipitation, and so forth) to connect points with equal values of the feature in question\u2014for example, isobars for pressure, isotherms for temperature, and isohyets for precipitation. Isoamplitudes are drawn on maps of amplitudes (for example, annual amplitudes of air temperature\u2014that is, the differences between the mean temperatures of the warmest and coldest month). Isanomals are drawn on maps of anomalies (for example, deviations of the mean temperature of each place from the mean temperature of the entire latitudinal zone). Isolines of frequency are drawn on maps showing the frequency of a particular phenomenon (for example, annual number of days with a thunderstorm or snow cover). Isochrones are drawn on maps showing the dates of onset of a given phenomenon (for example, the first frost and appearance or disappearance of the snow cover) or the date of a particular value of a meteorological element in the course of a year (for example, passing of the mean daily air temperature through zero). Isolines of the mean numerical value of wind velocity or isotachs are drawn on wind maps (charts); the wind resultants and directions of prevailing winds are indicated by arrows of different length or arrows with different plumes; lines of flow are often drawn. Maps of the zonal and meridional components of wind are frequently compiled for the free atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure and wind are usually combined on climatic maps. Wind roses, curves showing the distribution of other meteorological elements, diagrams of the annual course of elements at individual stations, and the like are also plotted on climatic maps.\n\nMaps of climatic regionalization, that is, division of the earth's surface into climatic zones and regions according to some classification of climates, are a special kind of climatic map.\n\nClimatic maps are often incorporated into climatic atlases of varying geographic range (globe, hemispheres, continents, countries, oceans) or included in comprehensive atlases. Besides general climatic maps, applied climatic maps and atlases have great practical value. Aeroclimatic maps, aeroclimatic atlases, and agroclimatic maps are the most numerous.\n\n===Non-geographical spatial maps===\nMaps exist of the [[Solar System]], and other cosmological features such as [[star map]]s. In addition maps of other bodies such as the Moon and other planets are technically not ''[[geospatial|geo]]''graphical maps.\n\n===Topological maps===\n[[File:Inventory Locations Represented as a Map.png|thumb|upright=1.3|In a [[topological map]], like this one showing inventory locations, the distances between locations is not important. Only the layout and connectivity between them matters.]]\nDiagrams such as [[schematic diagram]]s and [[Gantt chart]]s and [[treemap]]s display logical relationships between items, rather than geographical relationships. [[Topological]] in nature, only the connectivity is significant. The [[London Underground map]] and similar subway maps around the world are a common example of these maps.\n\n===General-purpose maps===\nGeneral-purpose maps provide many types of information on one map. Most atlas maps, wall maps, and road maps fall into this category. The following are some features that might be shown on general-purpose maps: bodies of water, roads, railway lines, parks, elevations, towns and cities, political boundaries, latitude and longitude, national and provincial parks. These maps give a broad understanding of location and features of an area.  The reader may gain an understanding of the type of landscape, the location of urban places, and the location of major transportation routes all at once.\n\n===List of map types===\n* [[Atlas]]\n* [[Cadastre#Cadastral map|Cadastral map]]\n* [[#Climatic maps|Climatic map]]\n* [[Geologic map]]\n* [[Nautical map]]\n* [[#Map types and projections|Physical map]]\n* [[Political map]]\n* [[Terrain cartography|Relief map]]\n* [[Resource map]]\n* [[Star map]]\n* [[Street map]]\n* [[Thematic map]]\n\n* [[Topographic map]]\n* [[Weather map]]\n* [[World map]]\n\n==Legal regulation==\nSome countries required that all published maps represent their national claims regarding [[border dispute]]s.

The community is predominantly [[Eastern Orthodox Christian]] by religion, as opposed to the [[Croats]] who are [[Roman Catholic]].\n\nIn some regions of modern-day Croatia, mainly in southern [[Dalmatia]], [[ethnic Serbs]] have been present from the [[Early Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|p=}} Serbs from modern-day Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina started actively migrating to Croatia in several migration waves after 1538 when the [[Emperor Ferdinand I]] granted them the right to settle on the territory of the [[Military Frontier]]. In exchange for land and exemption from taxation, they had to conduct military service and participate in the protection of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]'s border against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They populated the [[Dalmatian hinterland]], [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]], [[Slavonia]], and [[Syrmia|Western Syrmia]]. After the creation of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] in 1918 (later renamed to Yugoslavia), a few thousand Serbs moved to Croatian territory. During [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]], Serbs were targeted for extermination as part of [[World War II persecution of Serbs|genocide]] by [[Usta\u0161e]]. After the beginning of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and Croatia's proclamation of independence, the Serbs living in Croatia rebelled against the Croatian government and proclaimed the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK) on parts of Croatian territory, which led to the [[Croatian War of Independence]].

The Venetian government welcomed immigrants, as they protected possessions against the Ottomans. The [[Morlachs]], former Ottoman subjects, helped Venice triple its size in Dalmatia.

In 1918, it became part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], which immediately joined the Kingdom of Serbia to form the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nThe formation of the Serbian identity of Vlahs in Croatia began in the 18th century under the influence of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] (SPC), and most of the local Orthodox priests of the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci]] who were educated in monasteries outside Croatia under the guidance of SPC clergy who came to the southwestern region of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] during the [[Great Migrations of the Serbs]] (1690\u20131739).

The [[Serbianisation]] of the Vlachs in southern Croatia was the result of the hierarchical linkage of Orthodox Vlachs from southern Croatian territories, at the time ruled by the Venetians, with the SPC in northern Croatia, which strengthened the ritual and ecclesiastical connection of the Vlachs with the Serb immigrants.<ref>Introduction by Mirko Valenti\u0107 in: Mile Bogovi\u0107: Katoli\u010dka Crkva i Pravoslavlje u Dalmaciji za vrijeme mleta\u010dke vladavine, Kr\u0161\u0107anska sada\u0161njost/\u0160kolska knjiga, Zagreb, 1993., p. 5-6</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s, the Serbian thought began spreading among the Orthodox Christians in the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]].

According to the 1844 [[Ilija Gara\u0161anin]]'s Na\u010dertanije, they intended to establish a Serbian Empire on the territory of the collapsed Ottoman Empire. At first, its borders were supposed to be the borders of the Ottoman Empire and the Slavs in them, but they gradually expanded to the territory of present-day Croatia (including the Military Frointaire and Dalmatia).<ref name=\"auto\">Benedikta Zeli\u0107-Bu\u0107an, Prologue in: Mihovil Pavlinovi\u0107: Misao hrvatska i misao srbska u Dalmaciji, Laus, Split, 1994., p. 11</ref> To accomplish this, the ground had to be prepared, so that diplomacy and the military would have a stronger base for taking action. The bases for this was the Serbian state law, and where it wasn't possible to appropriate the land with it, the argument of nationality, and when that argument couldn't be applied, then it was necessary to \"create\" the Serbs among the target population, if not among all, then among the majority. The main target were Orthodox Christians in the neighboring, non-Serb countries. In 1848/50, Serbian government organized a secret network of agents who propagated the Serbian ideas. Those agents were concealed as cultural workers. The famous agents were [[Georgije Nikolajevi\u0107]] and [[Stjepan Mitrov Ljubi\u0161a]].<ref name=\"auto\"/> The 'creation' of new Serbs was carried out by identification of Orthodox Christianity in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina only with Serbs.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite journal|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/67500|title=The Serbian question in Croatian politics, 1848\u20131918|first=Markus|last=Tomislav|date=1 April 2011|journal=Review of Croatian History|volume=VI|issue=1}}</ref> Another argument used in the areas with no Orthodox Christians was identifying people who spoke [[Shtokavian]] with the Serbs. The idea \"all Shtokavians are Serbs\" was created by German Slavists in the 1850s, and was promoted by the Austrian government who wanted to equalize Croats and Serbs so that it could more easily rule the Croatian lands and in the next stage conquer Serbia and penetrate across [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to [[Thessaloniki]].<ref name=\"matica.hr\">http://www.matica.hr/vijenac/427/Srpski%20jezik%20nije%20\u0161tokavski/</ref> The idea was that it was easier to \"govern Belgrade and Zagreb if the same language was spoken in them\". Geostrategic position of Belgrade in relation to Zagreb further contributed to favoring the Serbs whom Austrians did not perceive as a danger, unlike Croats who had own language, politicians, national consciousness, laws, military tradition and prepared army, as well as international [[Election in Cetin|treaties which have affirmed their rights]], so Austrians needed someone (Serbs) to discipline the Croats. The same was done by Hungary which became a strong political factor after 1848 and that wished to expand into the [[Southeast Europe]], which was particularly strong during the reign of [[K\u00e1roly Khuen-H\u00e9derv\u00e1ry]] over Croatia.<ref name=\"matica.hr\"/>\n{{multiple image\n| footer = '''Left:''' [[Matija Ban]], poet and dramatist, member of [[Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik]]<br />'''Right:''' [[Josip Runjanin]], composer of [[Lijepa na\u0161a domovino|Croatian national anthem]]\n| width1    = 130\n| image1    = MatijaBan.jpg\n| width2    = 140\n| image2    = Josip Runjanin.png\n}}\n[[Revolutions of 1848|The revolutionary 1848]] and the process of building a modern Croatian nation resulted in closer co-operation between Croats and Serbs and recognition of their equality in the sense of [[Illyrian Movement]] (also known as the Croatian National Revival) and [[Yugoslavia]]n ideas.

Following Croat enthusiasm with the successful 1878 [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], during which many Croatian soldiers died, and them seeking unification of Dalmatia and the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, the conflict between Croats and Serbs was inevitable.<ref name=\"slobodnadalmacija.hr\">{{cite web|url=http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20000813/podlistak.htm|title=SLOBODNA DALMACIJA, NEDJELJA 13. kolovoza 2000. \u2013 podlistak: Preokret i odvajanje|website=arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr}}</ref> In 1879, Serbs from Bukovica voted for the Italian candidate instead of Croat [[Miho Klai\u0107]].<ref name=\"slobodnadalmacija.hr\"/> This event was called by People's Party's supporters ''Bukovica betrail''.

The community is predominantly [[Eastern Orthodox Christian]] by religion, as opposed to the [[Croats]] who are [[Roman Catholic]].\n\nIn some regions of modern-day Croatia, mainly in southern [[Dalmatia]], [[ethnic Serbs]] have been present from the [[Early Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|p=}} Serbs from modern-day Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina started actively migrating to Croatia in several migration waves after 1538 when the [[Emperor Ferdinand I]] granted them the right to settle on the territory of the [[Military Frontier]]. In exchange for land and exemption from taxation, they had to conduct military service and participate in the protection of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]'s border against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They populated the [[Dalmatian hinterland]], [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]], [[Slavonia]], and [[Syrmia|Western Syrmia]]. After the creation of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] in 1918 (later renamed to Yugoslavia), a few thousand Serbs moved to Croatian territory. During [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]], Serbs were targeted for extermination as part of [[World War II persecution of Serbs|genocide]] by [[Usta\u0161e]]. After the beginning of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and Croatia's proclamation of independence, the Serbs living in Croatia rebelled against the Croatian government and proclaimed the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK) on parts of Croatian territory, which led to the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. After the Croatian Army's [[Operation Storm]], the RSK ceased to exist, its territory was reincorporated into Croatia, and approximately 200,000 Serbs fled the country.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, there were 186,633 Serbs living in Croatia (4.4% of the population) which are recognized as a national minority by the Croatian Constitution and therefore have 3 permanent seats in the [[Croatian Parliament]].\n\n==Overview==\nTraditional elements of their identity are the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox faith]], [[Serbian Cyrillic|Cyrillic script]] and military history, while modern elements are [[Serbian language|language]] and [[Serbian literature|literature]], civic, social and political values, concern for ethnic status and national organisation, and celebration of the [[Liberation of Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/planeta.300.html:514233-Srbi-u-Hrvatskoj-zabrinuti-da-ce-nestati|title=Srbi u Hrvatskoj zabrinuti da \u0107e nestati}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 2011 census there were 186,633 ethnic [[Serbs]] living in Croatia, 4.4% of the total population.

In the summer of 1685, Cosmi, the Archbishop of Split, wrote that Morlach leader [[Stojan Jankovi\u0107]] had brought 300 families with him to Dalmatia, and also that around Trogir and Split there were 5,000 refugees from Ottoman lands, without food; this was seen as a serious threat to the defense of Dalmatia.

The [[Serbianisation]] of the Vlachs in southern Croatia was the result of the hierarchical linkage of Orthodox Vlachs from southern Croatian territories, at the time ruled by the Venetians, with the SPC in northern Croatia, which strengthened the ritual and ecclesiastical connection of the Vlachs with the Serb immigrants.<ref>Introduction by Mirko Valenti\u0107 in: Mile Bogovi\u0107: Katoli\u010dka Crkva i Pravoslavlje u Dalmaciji za vrijeme mleta\u010dke vladavine, Kr\u0161\u0107anska sada\u0161njost/\u0160kolska knjiga, Zagreb, 1993., p. 5-6</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s, the Serbian thought began spreading among the Orthodox Christians in the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]].

At first, its borders were supposed to be the borders of the Ottoman Empire and the Slavs in them, but they gradually expanded to the territory of present-day Croatia (including the Military Frointaire and Dalmatia).<ref name=\"auto\">Benedikta Zeli\u0107-Bu\u0107an, Prologue in: Mihovil Pavlinovi\u0107: Misao hrvatska i misao srbska u Dalmaciji, Laus, Split, 1994., p. 11</ref> To accomplish this, the ground had to be prepared, so that diplomacy and the military would have a stronger base for taking action. The bases for this was the Serbian state law, and where it wasn't possible to appropriate the land with it, the argument of nationality, and when that argument couldn't be applied, then it was necessary to \"create\" the Serbs among the target population, if not among all, then among the majority. The main target were Orthodox Christians in the neighboring, non-Serb countries. In 1848/50, Serbian government organized a secret network of agents who propagated the Serbian ideas. Those agents were concealed as cultural workers. The famous agents were [[Georgije Nikolajevi\u0107]] and [[Stjepan Mitrov Ljubi\u0161a]].<ref name=\"auto\"/> The 'creation' of new Serbs was carried out by identification of Orthodox Christianity in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina only with Serbs.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite journal|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/67500|title=The Serbian question in Croatian politics, 1848\u20131918|first=Markus|last=Tomislav|date=1 April 2011|journal=Review of Croatian History|volume=VI|issue=1}}</ref> Another argument used in the areas with no Orthodox Christians was identifying people who spoke [[Shtokavian]] with the Serbs. The idea \"all Shtokavians are Serbs\" was created by German Slavists in the 1850s, and was promoted by the Austrian government who wanted to equalize Croats and Serbs so that it could more easily rule the Croatian lands and in the next stage conquer Serbia and penetrate across [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to [[Thessaloniki]].<ref name=\"matica.hr\">http://www.matica.hr/vijenac/427/Srpski%20jezik%20nije%20\u0161tokavski/</ref> The idea was that it was easier to \"govern Belgrade and Zagreb if the same language was spoken in them\".

The eldest son of the reigning [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] inherits possession of the duchy and title of [[Duke of Cornwall]] at birth or when his parent succeeds to the throne, but may not sell assets for personal benefit and has limited rights and income as a minor. \n\nThe current duke is [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]. If, and when, the current Prince of Wales accedes to the throne, [[Prince William]] will become Duke of Cornwall. When the monarch has no male children, the rights and responsibilities of the duchy revert to [[the Crown]] and there is no duke. (The [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] does not affect the succession to the duchy, so that if the heir apparent is female she cannot succeed to the duchy.)\n\nThe Duchy Council, called the Prince's Council, meets twice a year and is chaired by the duke. The Prince's Council is a non-executive body which provides advice to the duke with regard to the management of the Duchy.<ref name=wmn5/> The duchy also exercises certain legal rights and privileges across Cornwall, including some that elsewhere in England belong to the Crown. The duke appoints a number of officials in the county and acts as the port authority for the main harbour of the Isles of Scilly.\n\nThe government considers the duchy to be a crown body and therefore [[Tax exemption|exempt]] from paying [[United Kingdom corporation tax|corporation tax]].

The eldest son of the reigning [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] inherits possession of the duchy and title of [[Duke of Cornwall]] at birth or when his parent succeeds to the throne, but may not sell assets for personal benefit and has limited rights and income as a minor. \n\nThe current duke is [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]. If, and when, the current Prince of Wales accedes to the throne, [[Prince William]] will become Duke of Cornwall. When the monarch has no male children, the rights and responsibilities of the duchy revert to [[the Crown]] and there is no duke. (The [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] does not affect the succession to the duchy, so that if the heir apparent is female she cannot succeed to the duchy.)\n\nThe Duchy Council, called the Prince's Council, meets twice a year and is chaired by the duke. The Prince's Council is a non-executive body which provides advice to the duke with regard to the management of the Duchy.<ref name=wmn5/> The duchy also exercises certain legal rights and privileges across Cornwall, including some that elsewhere in England belong to the Crown. The duke appoints a number of officials in the county and acts as the port authority for the main harbour of the Isles of Scilly.\n\nThe government considers the duchy to be a crown body and therefore [[Tax exemption|exempt]] from paying [[United Kingdom corporation tax|corporation tax]].
