It was the first tour with original members [[Peter Criss]] and [[Ace Frehley]] since their 1979 [[Dynasty Tour]]. The tour grossed $143.7 million, making it the most successful Kiss tour to date. Average attendance was 14,000.\n\nThe reunion tour prompted many 80's metal bands to also do reunion tours, however KISS' was the first and most successful.\n\nShows included the June 15 warmup gig in [[Irvine, California]], during which a stray firework ignited part of the stage; the August 8 show in [[Cincinnati]], where a fan threw his prosthetic leg on stage, which all the members signed and handed back to him; the January 22 show in [[Osaka]], Japan, where [[Gene Simmons]] lost his voice, [[Paul Stanley]] and Ace Frehley had to sing most of the songs; and the April 5 show in [[Columbus, Georgia]], where, due to health reasons, Peter Criss could not perform, and because the group decided to not cancel the show since the doors were already open, Criss's drum tech Eddie Kanon took the stage in Criss's \"cat\" make-up.\nThere was a short set played for MTV Music Awards before starting the US second leg, on September 4 at Fulton Ferry Landing under the Brooklyn Bridge in NYC. Setlist for the show: \"[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]\" / \"[[New York Groove]]\" / \"[[Deuce (song)|Deuce]]\" / \"[[Calling Dr. Love]]\" / \"[[Love Gun (song)|Love Gun]]\".\n\nThe setlists for the tour drew almost exclusively from the band's 1970s heyday and did not include any songs from their non-make-up era. Only one song from the band's 1980s catalogue (\"[[Shandi (song)|Shandi]]\" from ''[[Unmasked (Kiss album)|Unmasked]]'') was played. The band did this because they believed that since they were touring with their original lineup, they should be faithful to the era with the material performed. {{citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\n[[Alice in Chains]] were among many of the supporting acts on this tour. This would turn out to be their last tour featuring late vocalist [[Layne Staley]] with the final live appearance being on July 3, 1996, in Kansas City, Missouri. Shortly after the show, Staley was found unresponsive after he overdosed on heroin and was taken to the hospital. Although he recovered, the band was forced to go on hiatus. Layne would never perform live again and lived in isolation until his death on April 5, 2002.\n\n==Typical setlist==\n\n#\"[[Deuce (song)|Deuce]]\"\n#\"King of the Night Time World\"\n#\"Do You Love Me?\"\n#\"[[Calling Dr. Love]]\"\n#\"[[Cold Gin (song)|Cold Gin]]\"\n#\"[[Love Gun (song)|Love Gun]]\"\n#\"[[Shout It Out Loud (Kiss song)|Shout It Out Loud]]\"\n#\"Watchin' You\"\n#\"[[Firehouse (Kiss song)|Firehouse]]\"\n#\"[[Strutter]]\"\n#\"[[Shock Me]]\" (Ace Frehley guitar solo)\n#\"Rock Bottom\"\n#\"[[God of Thunder (song)|God of Thunder]]\" (Gene Simmons bass solo, spits blood and flies), (Peter Criss drum solo)\n#\"[[New York Groove]]\"\n#\"[[Let Me Go, Rock 'n' Roll]]\"\n#\"100,000 Years\"\n#\"[[Black Diamond (Kiss song)|Black Diamond]]\"\n'''Encore'''\n#<li value=18>\"[[Beth (song)|Beth]]\"\n#\"[[Detroit Rock City]]\"\n#\"[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]\"\n\nOther songs played included \"Take Me\", \"I Stole Your Love\", \"[[Shandi (song)|Shandi]]\", \"[[C'mon and Love Me]]\", \"[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]]\", \"[[Christine Sixteen]]\", and \"[[2,000 Man]]\".\n\n==Notable Shows==\n<ref>https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1997/1997-0705.php</ref><ref>https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-first-reunion-show/</ref><ref>https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1996/1996.php</ref>\n\n'''June 15, 1996 KROQ Weenie Roast, Irvine Ca'''\n\nThis show was a practice gig for the band in front of a live audience before the official beginning of the tour. This show was for the band to work out the kinks in their complex live show. During the show multiple things went wrong, for example Ace Frehley's guitar went silent in the middle of the set. \n\n'''June 28, 1996 Tiger Stadium, Detroit Mi'''\n\nThis was the first official show with the reunited band in 17 years, and this was the show that kicked off the highly successful Alive Worldwide Tour. Initially the band wanted to start the tour off at a smaller venue, but their manager, Doc McGee booked the massive baseball stadium for the first gig. This ended up being a very fitting venue for the beginning of Kiss' comeback, because the city of Detroit always had special significance to the band, which is why Kiss wrote a song titled \"[[Detroit Rock City]]\", which is one of their most well known songs, getting regular airplay on classic rock radio stations. The move to open the tour at Tiger Stadium in Detroit Rock City proved to be a good one, because the show sold out in a record time of 45 minutes, which is very impressive considering the fact that the band sold 39,867 tickets in under an hour without online ticket sales. \n\n'''June 25-28, 1996 Madison Square Garden, New York City Ny'''\n\nWhen the band went to schedule dates in their home town of New York City, they found out that just one night at the world famous Madison Square Garden arena was simply not enough, so they played four sold out consecutive nights at MSG and likely could have done another if the arena hadn't been occupied the next night. \n\n'''September 4, 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, Brooklyn Ny'''\n\nIn 1996 Kiss was riding on success as if it were 1977 again, and were scheduled to preform on the MTV Video Music Awards as a way to help further promote themselves, but in typical Kiss fashion, they weren't just going to play on any stage, they were intending on playing a show under the Statue of Liberty, but couldn't make a deal with the city of New York, so last minute the concert location was changed to a port right next to the Brooklyn Bridge in New York. Kiss played a 20 minute set to an audience of whoever showed up to watch them under the silhouette of the Brooklyn Bridge, however only the first song, Rock n Roll All Nite was broadcast on TV. Since the band was playing outdoors at an unofficial venue, without as many regulations, the band added loads of pyrotechnics, fireworks, and confetti. The complete show can be seen on Kiss' dvd boxset Kissology III.\n\n==Tour dates==\n\n\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kissconcerthistory.com/ |title=KISS Concert History Online \u2013 Decades on Tour Detailed |website=kissconcerthistory.com |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1996/1996.php |title=KISS Concert History Online \u2013 Decades on Tour Detailed: 1996 |website=www.kissconcerthistory.com |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1997/1997.php |title=KISS Concert History Online \u2013 Decades on Tour Detailed: 1997 |website=www.kissconcerthistory.com |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kissfanshop.de/Tourdates/TourdatesReunion.htm|title=KISS TOURDATES Alive Worldwide 1996\u201397|website=www.kissfanshop.de}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.setlist.fm/search?query=tour:(Alive/Worldwide) |title=Search for setlists: tour:(Alive/Worldwide) &#124; setlist.fm |website=www.setlist.fm |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! width=\"200\"| Date\n! width=\"200\"| City\n! width=\"150\"| Country\n! width=\"300\"| Venue\n! width=\"175\"| Opening Act(s)\n! width=\"200\"| Attendance \n\n\n|-\n|June 15, 1996||[[Irvine, California]]||[[United States]]||[[Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre - KROQ Weenie Roast]] || [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] || 15,416 *sold out*\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|North America \n|-\n|June 28, 1996||[[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]||rowspan=\"24\"|United States||[[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] || [[Alice in Chains]], [[Sponge (band)|Sponge]] || 39,867 *sold out*\n|-\n|June 30, 1996||[[Louisville, Kentucky]]||[[Freedom Hall]] || rowspan=\"3\"|Alice in Chains || 15,891 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 2, 1996||[[St. Louis, Missouri]]||[[Kiel Center]] || 16,310 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 3, 1996||[[Kansas City, Missouri]]||[[Kemper Arena]] || 13,226 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 5, 1996||[[Dallas, Texas]]||[[Reunion Arena]] || rowspan=\"3\"|[[Pushmonkey]] || 14,637 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 6, 1996||[[Houston, Texas]]||[[The Summit (Houston)|The Summit]] || 12,955 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 7, 1996||[[San Antonio, Texas]]||[[Alamodome]] || 18,337 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 9, 1996||[[New Orleans, Louisiana]]||[[Louisiana Superdome]] || rowspan=\"5\"|[[The Melvins]] || 16,308 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 10, 1996||[[Memphis, Tennessee]]||[[Pyramid Arena]] || 16,807 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 12, 1996||[[Moline, Illinois]]||[[MARK of the Quad Cities]] || 10,349 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 13, 1996||[[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]||[[St. Paul Civic Center]] || 15,234 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 14, 1996||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Rosemont, Illinois]]||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Rosemont Horizon]] || 29,887 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 16, 1996 || rowspan=\"3\"|[[The Nixons]] || 29,887 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 17, 1996||[[Fairborn, Ohio]]||[[Ervin J.

It was the first tour with original members [[Peter Criss]] and [[Ace Frehley]] since their 1979 [[Dynasty Tour]]. The tour grossed $143.7 million, making it the most successful Kiss tour to date. Average attendance was 14,000.\n\nThe reunion tour prompted many 80's metal bands to also do reunion tours, however KISS' was the first and most successful.\n\nShows included the June 15 warmup gig in [[Irvine, California]], during which a stray firework ignited part of the stage; the August 8 show in [[Cincinnati]], where a fan threw his prosthetic leg on stage, which all the members signed and handed back to him; the January 22 show in [[Osaka]], Japan, where [[Gene Simmons]] lost his voice, [[Paul Stanley]] and Ace Frehley had to sing most of the songs; and the April 5 show in [[Columbus, Georgia]], where, due to health reasons, Peter Criss could not perform, and because the group decided to not cancel the show since the doors were already open, Criss's drum tech Eddie Kanon took the stage in Criss's \"cat\" make-up.\nThere was a short set played for MTV Music Awards before starting the US second leg, on September 4 at Fulton Ferry Landing under the Brooklyn Bridge in NYC. Setlist for the show: \"[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]\" / \"[[New York Groove]]\" / \"[[Deuce (song)|Deuce]]\" / \"[[Calling Dr. Love]]\" / \"[[Love Gun (song)|Love Gun]]\".\n\nThe setlists for the tour drew almost exclusively from the band's 1970s heyday and did not include any songs from their non-make-up era. Only one song from the band's 1980s catalogue (\"[[Shandi (song)|Shandi]]\" from ''[[Unmasked (Kiss album)|Unmasked]]'') was played. The band did this because they believed that since they were touring with their original lineup, they should be faithful to the era with the material performed. {{citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\n[[Alice in Chains]] were among many of the supporting acts on this tour. This would turn out to be their last tour featuring late vocalist [[Layne Staley]] with the final live appearance being on July 3, 1996, in Kansas City, Missouri. Shortly after the show, Staley was found unresponsive after he overdosed on heroin and was taken to the hospital. Although he recovered, the band was forced to go on hiatus.

During the show multiple things went wrong, for example Ace Frehley's guitar went silent in the middle of the set. \n\nJune 28, 1996 Tiger Stadium, Detroit Mi\n\nThis was the first official show with the reunited band in 17 years, and this was the show that kicked off the highly successful Alive Worldwide Tour. Initially the band wanted to start the tour off at a smaller venue, but their manager, Doc McGee booked the massive baseball stadium for the first gig. This ended up being a very fitting venue for the beginning of Kiss' comeback, because the city of Detroit always had special significance to the band, which is why Kiss wrote a song titled \"[[Detroit Rock City]]\", which is one of their most well known songs, getting regular airplay on classic rock radio stations. The move to open the tour at Tiger Stadium in Detroit Rock City proved to be a good one, because the show sold out in a record time of 45 minutes, which is very impressive considering the fact that the band sold 39,867 tickets in under an hour without online ticket sales. \n\nJune 25-28, 1996 Madison Square Garden, New York City Ny\n\nWhen the band went to schedule dates in their home town of New York City, they found out that just one night at the world famous Madison Square Garden arena was simply not enough, so they played four sold out consecutive nights at MSG and likely could have done another if the arena hadn't been occupied the next night. \n\nSeptember 4, 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, Brooklyn Ny\n\nIn 1996 Kiss was riding on success as if it were 1977 again, and were scheduled to preform on the MTV Video Music Awards as a way to help further promote themselves, but in typical Kiss fashion, they weren't just going to play on any stage, they were intending on playing a show under the Statue of Liberty, but couldn't make a deal with the city of New York, so last minute the concert location was changed to a port right next to the Brooklyn Bridge in New York. Kiss played a 20 minute set to an audience of whoever showed up to watch them under the silhouette of the Brooklyn Bridge, however only the first song, Rock n Roll All Nite was broadcast on TV. Since the band was playing outdoors at an unofficial venue, without as many regulations, the band added loads of pyrotechnics, fireworks, and confetti. The complete show can be seen on Kiss' dvd boxset Kissology III.\n\n==Tour dates==\n\n\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kissconcerthistory.com/ |title=KISS Concert History Online \u2013 Decades on Tour Detailed |website=kissconcerthistory.com |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1996/1996.php |title=KISS Concert History Online \u2013 Decades on Tour Detailed: 1996 |website=www.kissconcerthistory.com |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1997/1997.php |title=KISS Concert History Online \u2013 Decades on Tour Detailed: 1997 |website=www.kissconcerthistory.com |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kissfanshop.de/Tourdates/TourdatesReunion.htm|title=KISS TOURDATES Alive Worldwide 1996\u201397|website=www.kissfanshop.de}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.setlist.fm/search?query=tour:(Alive/Worldwide) |title=Search for setlists: tour:(Alive/Worldwide) &#124; setlist.fm |website=www.setlist.fm |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! width=\"200\"| Date\n! width=\"200\"| City\n! width=\"150\"| Country\n! width=\"300\"| Venue\n! width=\"175\"| Opening Act(s)\n! width=\"200\"| Attendance \n\n\n|-\n|June 15, 1996||[[Irvine, California]]||[[United States]]||[[Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre - KROQ Weenie Roast]] || [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] || 15,416 *sold out*\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|North America \n|-\n|June 28, 1996||[[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]||rowspan=\"24\"|United States||[[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] || [[Alice in Chains]], [[Sponge (band)|Sponge]] || 39,867 *sold out*\n|-\n|June 30, 1996||[[Louisville, Kentucky]]||[[Freedom Hall]] || rowspan=\"3\"|Alice in Chains || 15,891 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 2, 1996||[[St. Louis, Missouri]]||[[Kiel Center]] || 16,310 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 3, 1996||[[Kansas City, Missouri]]||[[Kemper Arena]] || 13,226 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 5, 1996||[[Dallas, Texas]]||[[Reunion Arena]] || rowspan=\"3\"|[[Pushmonkey]] || 14,637 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 6, 1996||[[Houston, Texas]]||[[The Summit (Houston)|The Summit]] || 12,955 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 7, 1996||[[San Antonio, Texas]]||[[Alamodome]] || 18,337 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 9, 1996||[[New Orleans, Louisiana]]||[[Louisiana Superdome]] || rowspan=\"5\"|[[The Melvins]] || 16,308 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 10, 1996||[[Memphis, Tennessee]]||[[Pyramid Arena]] || 16,807 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 12, 1996||[[Moline, Illinois]]||[[MARK of the Quad Cities]] || 10,349 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 13, 1996||[[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]||[[St. Paul Civic Center]] || 15,234 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 14, 1996||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Rosemont, Illinois]]||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Rosemont Horizon]] || 29,887 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 16, 1996 || rowspan=\"3\"|[[The Nixons]] || 29,887 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 17, 1996||[[Fairborn, Ohio]]||[[Ervin J.

{"title_page": "Private university", "text_new": "{{about|private universities and colleges that are academic degree-awarding|Private and/or preparatory schools|Private school}}\n'''Private universities ''' (and '''private colleges''') are usually not operated by governments, although many receive [[tax breaks]], public [[student loans]], and [[grant (money)|grants]]. Depending on their location, private universities may be subject to government regulation. This is in contrast to [[public university|public universities]] and [[national university|national universities]]. Many private universities are [[nonprofit organization]]s.\n\n== Africa ==\n\n=== Egypt ===\nEgypt has many private universities, including [[The American University in Cairo]], the [[German University in Cairo]], the [[British University in Egypt]], the [[Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport]], [[Misr University for Science and Technology]], [[Misr International University]], [[Future University in Egypt]] and [[Modern Sciences and Arts University]].\n\n=== Ghana ===\nThere were few private universities in Ghana before the beginning of the new millennium. Ghana has seen a flood of the establishment of private universities and colleges, which is a reflection of the country's stable governance, and the pace of economic growth. Most of these universities are not known to be sponsored by foreign corporate organisations and government universities, and the aim is to avoid the Ghanaian government's excessive payment of bond which is a requirement for all foreign institutions endeavouring to operate businesses in the country. Almost all the private universities in Ghana have a similar kind of academic discipline, like business administration, human resource, accounting, information technology, etc., which are offered by universities like [[Ashesi University|Ashesi]], [[Regent University College of Science and Technology|Regent]], [[Valley View University|Valley View]], [[Ghana telecom university college|Ghana Telecom]], and many others. The recent discovery of oil and gas in commercial quantities has influenced the development of oil and gas management courses within the private universities' curriculua.\n\n=== The Gambia ===\n\n[[Islamic Online University]]\n\n=== Libya ===\nLibya has number of recognised private education institutions and universities, approved by the Ministry of Higher Education, ranked and qualified to specialise in academic programs in Business Administration, Computer Science, Law, Medicine and Humanitarian. These institutions include:\n\n* Al Rifaq University for Humanitarian and Applied Science \u2013 Tripoli City\n* Ibn Al Haytham Center for Technology Education and Scientific research \u2013 Tripoli City\n* Libyan International Medical University \u2013 Benghazi City\n* Libyan University for Humanitarian and Applied Science \u2013 Tajora City\n* Tripoli Community University \u2013 Tripoli\n* Tripoli Institute for Medical Sciences \u2013 Tripoli City\n* United Africa University \u2013 Zawia City\n\n=== Nigeria ===\nThe [[National Universities Commission]] of Nigeria has the responsibility to approve private universities and accredit their courses. This ensures a minimum standard in curriculum and teaching. There are currently 60 approved private universities in Nigeria and many applications being processed.\n\n=== South Africa ===\nIn [[South Africa]] there are many distinctions between public universities and what are officially termed private higher education institutions. Recognised private higher education institutions include [[Varsity College (South Africa)|Varsity College]], [[Vega (South Africa)|Vega]], [[Milpark]], [[Midrand Graduate Institute]] and [[Regenesys Business School]].\n\n== Asia ==\n\n=== Bangladesh ===\nA number of private universities were established in Bangladesh after the Private University Act, 1992 was instituted, and amended as the Private University Act 2010. All private universities must be approved by [[University Grants Commission (Bangladesh)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC) before they are given a permit to operate. See external links for: ''Private Universities Act 1992''.\n\nAs of April 2018, there were 97 [[List of universities in Bangladesh#Private universities|private universities in Bangladesh]].\n\n=== Brunei Darussalam ===\nPrivate institutions must confer the students with external programmes such as BDTVEC (the largest awarding body in the country), [[Business and Technology Education Council|BTEC]] and [[Cambridge International Examinations]] pathways. Accreditation by Brunei Darussalam National Accreditation Council (BDNAC) is very crucial in order to establish a private institution.\n\n*[[Laksamana College of Business]] (Brunei Campus of [[Kensington College of Business]])\n\n=== Cambodia ===\nSince 1997, private universities have been established in the Kingdom of Cambodia.\n\n* [[IIC University of Technology]] (IICUT) \u2013 Phnom Penh\n* [[Zaman University]] (ZAMANU) \u2013 Phnom Penh\n\n=== China ===\nSince 2003, joint-partnership private universities have been established in the People's Republic of China (PRC).

It also plays a leading role towards building a knowledge-based economy in Pakistan by giving out hundreds of doctoral scholarships for education abroad every year.\n\nIn spite of the criticism of the HEC, its creation has also had a positive impact on higher education in Pakistan. Its two-year report for 2004 to 2006 states that according to the Institute of Scientific Information, the total number of publications appearing in the 8,000 leading journals indexed in the web of science arising out of Pakistan in 2005 was 1,259 articles, representing a 41% increase over the past two years and a 60% increase since the establishment of HEC in 2002. The HEC digital library now provides access to over 20,000 leading research journals, covering about 75% of the world's peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n\nUntil 1991, there were only two recognized private universities in Pakistan: [[Aga Khan University]], established in 1983 and [[Lahore University of Management Sciences]], established in 1985. By 1997, however, there were 10 private universities. In 2001\u20132002, this number had doubled to 20. Among the first to gain degree awarding status was [[Hajvery University, Lahore]] (HU), established in 1990. In 2003\u20132004 Pakistan had a total of 83 private degree granting institutions.\n\n=== Saudi Arabia ===\nThere are nine private universities in Saudi Arabia:\n* [[Al Yamamah University]]\n* [[Alfaisal University]]\n* [[Arab Open University]]\n* [[Dar Al Uloom University]]<ref name=mohe>{{cite web|title=Private Universities|url=http://www.mohe.gov.sa/en/studyinside/privateedu/Pages/listphe.aspx|publisher=Ministry of Higher Education|accessdate=14 August 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423075451/http://www.mohe.gov.sa/en/studyinside/privateedu/Pages/listphe.aspx|archivedate=23 April 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Effat University]]\n* [[Fahd bin Sultan University]]<ref name=fbsuback>{{cite web|title=University background|url=http://www.fbsu.edu.sa/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1542&Itemid=459|publisher=FBSU|accessdate=14 August 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110194747/http://www.fbsu.edu.sa/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1542&Itemid=459|archivedate=10 November 2012}}</ref>\n* [[King Abdullah University of Science and Technology]]\n* [[Prince Mohammad bin Fahd University]]\n* [[Prince Sultan University]]\n\n=== Singapore ===\nStansfield College, founded in 1993, is a private higher education institution and a provider of the [[University of London International Programmes]] in [[Singapore]]. Through its collaboration with the [[University of London]], Stansfield offers undergraduate degrees and diplomas in a range of academic disciplines which include Law, the Humanities, and the EMFSS suite of programmes with specialisations in Accounting, Business & Management, Banking & Finance, Economics, Mathematics & Economics and the Social Sciences.<ref name=\"stansfield.edu.sg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stansfield.edu.sg|title=Stansfield College|work=Stansfield College|accessdate=2 April 2016}}</ref> The college has also expanded its range of programmes to include several university foundation awards including certificate and diploma programmes that allow students to progress academically at Stansfield or to gain admissions into overseas universities. The college also provides postgraduate diplomas and executive development courses and seminars.<ref name=\"stansfield.edu.sg\" />\n\nThe college enrolls over 500, with students from over 30 countries studying at its campus.<ref name=\"stansfield.edu.sg\" />\n\nAuston Institute of Management is another example of a private 'university' where students who study at the college receive university awards from degree-awarding partners overseas. Auston rose to fame in the early 2000s{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} with a collaboration with [[Coventry University]]. This partnership ended in 2012 and was replaced with new partners including [[London South Bank University]], [[University of Wolverhampton]], [[Birmingham City University]], [[Chichester University]] and [[De Montfort University]]. Auston is known for its hands-on approach and its emphasis in technical areas of study such as electronics, mechatronics, computer security, and various forms of software engineering.<ref name=\"auston.edu.sg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.auston.edu.sg|title=Auston - Engineering, Computing and Business Degrees & Diplomas|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nAuston graduates about 400 students per year from as many as eight different countries, all studying in Singapore for UK degree awards.<ref name=\"auston.edu.sg\"/>\n\n=== South Korea ===\n*[[Busan University of Foreign Studies]]\n*[[Chung-Ang University]]\n*[[Dong-A University]]\n*[[Dongseo University]]\n*[[Handong Global University]]\n*[[Hankuk University of Foreign Studies]]\n*[[Hanyang University]]\n*[[Hongik University]]\n*[[Konkuk University]]\n*[[Keimyung University]]\n*[[Kookmin University]]\n*[[Korea University]]\n*[[Kwangwoon University]]\n*[[Kyung Hee University]]\n*[[Kyungsung University]]\n*[[Sogang University]]\n*[[Sungkyunkwan University]]\n*[[Yonsei University]]\n\n=== Sri Lanka ===\n[[Sri Lanka]] does not officially recognise private universities, but does not explicitly forbid them either.But there are many private institutes(these institutes are registered under the company act), and several independent institutions that are non-government funded. These mostly provide undergraduate degrees, with a limited few proving postgraduate degrees. The Informatics Institute of Sri Lanka (IIT),<ref>[http://www.iit.ac.lk/ www.iit.ac.lk]</ref> NSBM Green University (NSBM),<ref>[http://www.nsbm.ac.lk/ www.nsbm.ac.lk]</ref> Horizon Campus<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horizoncampus.edu.lk/|title=Horizon Campus|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2016}}</ref> and Sri Lanka Institute for Information Technology (SLIIT)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sliit.lk/|title=Home - Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology|work=Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology|accessdate=2 April 2016}}</ref> are examples. Some foreign universities franchise parts of their degree courses in Sri Lanka with local institutes. Students are charged for the study (some of these institutes are state funded institutions of their home countries) and these charges are often a fraction of the cost studying in the home countries of these institutions.\n\nEfforts to establish private universities have been blocked due to protests from state universities' undergraduates and leftist political parties.\n\nHowever many private colleges have sprung up one of which is the affiliated campus of Auston Institute of Management, Singapore. The Sri Lanka campus was established in 2010 and is a Board of Investment or (BOI) company. It retains a similar focus to the home campus and occupies a prime spot along Colombo's famous Galle Road.<ref name=\"auston.edu.lk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.auston.edu.lk|title=- Engineering and Project Management College in Sri Lanka|work=Auston|accessdate=2 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nAuston has been visited by many foreign universities and continues to expand its provision of titles in engineering and computing.<ref name=\"auston.edu.lk\"/>\n\n=== Syria ===\n* Al-Andalus University\n* Al Rasheed International University\n* [[Al-Shahba University]]\n* [[Al-Wataniya Private University]]\n* Aljazeera University\n* [[Arab International University]]\n* Ebla Private University\n* Hawash Private University\n* [[International University for Science and Technology]]\n* Ittihad Private University\n* [[Mamoun University for Science and Technology]]\n* [[Syrian Private University]]\n* University of Kalamoon\n* [[Wadi International University]]\n* [[Yarmouk Private University]]\n\n=== Taiwan ===\nIn Taiwan, unlike the United States, private universities are typically not as prestigious as some public (national) universities. They are not as highly ranked as public institutions, and also cost nearly twice as much. This is due to the form of testing in schools in Taiwan, in which students take a national entrance exam to determine their university qualifications. The famous private university is [[Fu Jen Catholic University]], and the earliest is [[Tunghai University]].\n\n=== Thailand ===\n* [[Asia-Pacific International University]] \u2013 Saraburi\n* [[Asian University]] \u2013 Chonburi\n* [[Assumption University (Thailand)|Assumption University]] (AU) \u2013 Bangkok\n* [[Bangkok University]] (BU) \u2013 Bangkok\n* [[Bangkokthonburi University]] (BTU)\u2013 Bangkok\n* [[Chaopraya University]] \u2013 Nakhon Sawan\n* Christian University \u2013 Nakhon Pathom\n* [[Chulabhorn Graduate Institute]] \u2013 Bangkok\n* [[Dhurakij Pundit University]] \u2013 Bangkok\n* [[Dusit Thani College]] (DTC) \u2013 Bangkok\n* E-sarn University \u2013 Khon Kaen\n* Eastern Asia University \u2013 Pathumthani\n* [[The Far Eastern University]] \u2013 Chiang Mai\n* [[Hatyai University]] \u2013 Songkhla\n* [[Huachiew Chalermprakiet University]] (HCU) \u2013 Bangkok\n* [[Kasem Bundit University]] (KBU) \u2013 Bangkok\n* [[Krirk University]] \u2013 Bangkok\n* [[Mahanakorn University of Technology]] (MUT) \u2013 Bangkok\n* [[North Chiang Mai University]] \u2013 Chiang Mai\n* [[North Eastern University]] \u2013 Khon Kaen\n* [[Pathumthani University]] \u2013 Pathumthani\n* [[Payap University]] \u2013 Chiang Mai\n* [[Rangsit University]] (RSU) \u2013 Pathumthani\n*  Ratchathani University \u2013 Ubon Ratchathani\n*  Rattana Bundit University \u2013 Bangkok\n* [[Saint John's Group of Schools and University|Saint John's University]] \u2013 Bangkok\n* [[Shinawatra University]] \u2013 Pathumthani\n* [[Siam University]] (SU) \u2013 Bangkok\n* South-East Asia University \u2013 Bangkok\n* [[Sripatum University]] (SPU) \u2013 Khon Kaen and Bangkok\n* [[Stamford International University]] \u2013 Phetchaburi\n* [[Thai-Nichi Institute of Technology]] \u2013 Bangkok\n* [[Thonburi University]] \u2013 Bangkok\n* [[University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce]] (UTCC) \u2013 Bangkok\n* [[Vongchavalitkul University]] \u2013 Nakhon Ratchasima\n* [[Webster University Thailand]] \u2013 Phetchaburi\n*  Yala Islamic University \u2013 Yala\n\n=== Vietnam ===\nSince the 1990s a lot of private universities have opened in Vietnam.  Ho Chi Minh City Open University was one of the first. Typical characteristics of Vietnamese private universities {{as of | 2010 | lc = on}} are higher (very high in some cases) tuition fees, poor infrastructure, and limited faculty and human resources.\n\nPrivate universities are often named after scholars (Fulbright University Vietnam, Vo Truong Toan University, [[Nguyen Trai]] University, Luong The Vinh University, Chu Van A University, [[Alexandre Yersin|Yersin]] University, [[Phan Chau Trinh]] University), or heroes/legends ([[Hung Vuong]] University, [[Quang Trung]] University), although there are exceptions, such as [[FPT University]], named after the FPT Group and [[Tan Tao University]], in [[Tan Tao Group]].\n\nIn Vietnam, there exists the \"semi-private university\"; schools in this category can receive partial financial support from the government. Almost all private universities have to invite professors and lecturers from the state universities. Many lecturers from state-owned universities take up positions in private universities after their retirement.\n\n== Europe ==\n\n=== Austria ===\nIn [[Austria]], educational institutions must be authorised by the country to legally grant [[academic degree]]s. All state-run universities are governed by the 2002 Austrian Universities' and University Degree Programmes' Organisation Act (Federal Law Gazette No. 120/2002). In 1999, a federal law (''Universit\u00e4ts-Akkreditierungsgesetz'') was passed to allow the [[School accreditation|accreditation]] of private universities. The ''Akkreditierungsrat'' (Accreditation Council)<ref>[http://www.akkreditierungsrat.at/ Official website \u2013 ''Akkreditierungsrat'']</ref>  evaluates applicants and issues recommendations to the responsible Austrian accreditation authority (the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science & Research).\n\nAccreditation by the council yields a couple of privileges: degrees issued by accredited private universities have the same legal status as those issued by state-run universities. Private universities can appoint or promote [[professor]]s. Their students enjoy the same privileges pertaining to social security, foreigner law and state scholarships as students of the state universities. Educational services of private universities are not subject to [[value added tax]], and donations are tax deductible.\n\nAccreditations must be renewed regularly and can be withdrawn, e.g. in the case of repeated academic misconduct as happened in 2003 when the accreditation of [[International University Vienna]] was withdrawn. In 2006, when the accreditation of [[Imadec Executive Education|Imadec University]] expired, the Accreditation Council rejected requests for renewal.\n\nAustrian law provides that private universities in Austria must use the term ''Privatuniversit\u00e4t'' (literally, \"private university\") in their [[German language|German]] names, although their formal names in other languages are not regulated. Thus, there is the possibility of private institutions employing the term \"university\" as opposed to \"private university\" in their advertisements in all languages except German while still complying with Austrian law.\n\nWhile the legal definition of \"private university\" prohibits funding by the federal government of Austria, funding by other public bodies is not prohibited. Consequently, some of Austria's private universities are partly or wholly funded by provincial governments, while others are fully privately funded.\n\nAccreditation of private universities began in 2001. {{As of | 2020}}, Austria has 16 private universities. Most are small (fewer than 1000 students) and specialise in only one or two fields of study:\n\n* [[Anton Bruckner Private University]] \u2013 [[Linz]]\n* Bertha von Suttner Private University - Sankt P\u00f6lten\n* [[Catholic Private University Linz]]\n* [[Central European University]] - Vienna\n* [[Danube Private University]] \u2013 [[Krems an der Donau]]\n* Gustav Mahler Private University for Music - Klagenfurt am W\u00f6rthersee\n* [[Jam Music Lab|Jam Music Lab Private University for Jazz and Popular Music Vienna]]\n* Karl Landsteiner University of Health Sciences \u2013 [[Krems an der Donau]]\n* [[Music and Arts University of the City of Vienna]] \u2013 [[Vienna]]\n* [[MODUL University Vienna]] (2007)\n* [[New Design University St. P\u00f6lten]]\n* [[Paracelsus Medical University]] \u2013 [[Salzburg]]\n* [[Seeburg Castle University]] in Seekirchen \u2013 near Salzburg\n* [[Sigmund Freud University Vienna]]\n* [[UMIT - Private University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology]] \u2013 [[Hall in Tirol]]\n* [[Webster Vienna Private University]] (also accredited in the [[US]])\n\nFour former private universities are '''not accredited''' any more:\n* [[International University Vienna]]: Accreditation was withdrawn in 2003 due to academic misconduct.\n* [[Imadec Executive Education|Imadec University]]: First accreditation period ended in January 2006 and was not renewed.\n* TCM Privatuniversit\u00e4t Li Shi Zhen in [[Vienna]]: Accreditation period ended 2009; TCM did not call for renewal. All students could finish their studies.\n* [[PEF Private University of Management Vienna]]: The university closed for economic reasons in March 2012. All students could finish their studies.\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\n[[Bulgaria]] has a number of private universities, among which the most renowned are [[New Bulgarian University]], located in the capital city [[Sofia]]; Burgas Free University; [[Varna Free University]]; and [[American University in Bulgaria]].\n\n=== Finland ===\n[[Finland]] does not officially recognise private universities, but does not explicitly forbid them either. [[Helsinki School of Business]] is an example of one such educational institution operating in this market.\n\n=== France ===\n[[France]] has a dual system: universities and ''[[grandes \u00e9coles]].''\n\nIt is forbidden by law for a private institution to be called \"university\",<ref>{{Citation|title=Code de l'\u00e9ducation - Article L731-14|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=DE788FC36D1C3DEF7F1BE6989ABCDD09.tplgfr30s_2?idArticle=LEGIARTI000027748361&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071191&dateTexte=20180417|accessdate=2018-04-17}}</ref> and almost all universities are public. Some private institutions still openly call themselves \"universities\", such as the [[Lille Catholic University]], even if this has no legal basis. Universities provide courses in all academic fields (engineering, law, medical, economics, arts, business administration, sociology). One may join university after a high school degree and study there for a ''licence'' (bachelor), master's degree, or doctoral program, although again by law private institutions may not grant degrees called ''licence'' or ''doctorat''.\n\n''Grandes \u00e9coles'' can be public or private, but the most prestigious ones are public. These institutions operate mostly in engineering studies and business administration. Universities and ''grandes \u00e9coles'' compete in these two fields. Some of them report to the Ministry of Higher Education, such as [[Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech]] and [[Ecole Centrale Paris|\u00c9cole Centrale Paris]], and a few to the Ministry of Defense, such as [[Ecole Polytechnique|\u00c9cole Polytechnique]]. Several private ''grandes \u00e9coles'' are members of the [[Conf\u00e9rence des grandes \u00e9coles (CGE)|''Conf\u00e9rence des Grandes \u00c9coles'']], a lobbying group representing grandes \u00e9coles. Most ''grandes \u00e9coles'' can be joined after following two years of ''[[classe pr\u00e9paratoire aux grandes \u00e9coles]]'', an intensive program following the ''[[baccalaur\u00e9at]]''. A selective examination after the two additional years is taken to enter a ''grande \u00e9cole''. Following the [[Bologna Process]], this full 5 year cursus (two years of preparatory classes plus 3 years in engineering or business school) is equivalent to a master's degree.\n\nGrandes \u00e9coles for studying business administration are usually part of the [[Chamber of commerce|chambers of commerce]]. For example, [[HEC Paris|HEC]] is part of the Chamber of Commerce of Paris ([[Paris Chamber of Commerce|CCIP]]), and is therefore semi-private.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[Germany]] has 83 private universities (called ''Privathochschule'') and 45 church-run universities (called ''kirchliche Hochschule''). Similar to the state-run universities, they are subdivided into ''Universit\u00e4ten'' (research universities), ''[[Fachhochschule]]n'' (universities of applied science) and ''Kunst- und Musikhochschulen'' ([[art school]]s). Private universities in Germany need institutional accreditation by the state.\n\nThe first private university in Germany, the Ukrainian Free University, was established 16 September 1950 in Munich. [[Witten/Herdecke University]] opened in 1982 and [[Zeppelin University]] in 2003. Though private universities are numerous in Germany, they represent only less than 1% of all students. Some private universities, including [[Hanseatic University Rostock]] (2007\u20132009) and the International University in Germany in [[Bruchsal]], have gone out of business.\n\nMost of the church universities are run by the Protestant or Catholic churches; however, there is one Jewish university (''Hochschule f\u00fcr J\u00fcdische Studien'') in [[Heidelberg]].\n\n=== Greece ===\nIn [[Greece]] private universities are prohibited by [[Constitution of Greece|the constitution]] (Article 16).  However, laboratories of liberal studies (\u0395\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd, ergastiria eleftheron spoudon) operate freely in the country, and, based on a law from the 1930s they are registered as private for-profit businesses and regulated by the Greek Ministry of Commerce.  Their academic degrees, which are not recognised in Greece, are directly provided to students by foreign universities in the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States of America]], or other countries, usually through [[Franchising|franchise]] or validation agreements (the franchise agreement usually being considered better).  This has limited access to the laboratories, which usually teach in English, to high-income Greeks who for various reasons (usually family matters) did not want to go abroad.\n\nIn 2008 a law was introduced that forced all private institutions collaborating with foreign universities to offer programmes in the country, to register with the Greek Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs as ''[[college]]s'' (\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1, kollegia) by August 2009. Further amendments to the framework in 2010, 2012 and 2013 (4111/2013, 4093/2012) were introduced. Today there are a series of [[List of universities in Greece#Private colleges|private colleges in Greece]] mostly in [[Athens]] and [[Thessaloniki]].\n\n=== Hungary ===\n* [[Central European University]] \u2013 Budapest; a founding member of the [[European University Association]] (EUA)<ref>[[Diane Stone]], \"Market Principles, Philanthropic Ideals and Public Service Values: The Public Policy Program at the Central European University\", ''PS: Political Science and Politics'', July 2007: 545\u2014551.</ref>\n\n===Italy===\n* [[Libera Universit\u00e0 Maria SS.

All [[List of universities in the Republic of Ireland|universities]], [[Regional Technical College|institutes of technology]], [[College of Education|colleges of education]], and the [[National College of Ireland]] and some religious institutions are publicly funded and therefore covered by ''free-fees'' initiative. There are few private colleges, and they are highly specialised, such as [[Griffith College Dublin]], [[Dorset College]] and [[Dublin Business School]]. The major representative body for private colleges in Ireland is the [[Higher Education Colleges Association]]. Private colleges in Ireland can seek to have their programmes validated/accredited by the [[Higher Education and Training Awards Council]].\n\nSee external links for: ''free-fees initiative''  and  ''Higher Education Colleges Association''.\n\n=== Netherlands ===\n[[Nyenrode]] is the only private university in the [[Netherlands]] at the graduate level. The university was founded in 1946. It serves as a [[graduate school]] for business and management. Both programs are taught in English.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Recently, Nyenrode merged with the Institute for CPA Education and both institutions share their facilities. The Nyenrode Business University also contains a campus and active student body.\n\nOther Dutch private universities are universities of applied science (HBOs) where one can obtain a bachelor's or master's degree but not a PhD. These include [[Wittenborg University]], Business School Notenboom (founded in 1958)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notenboom.nl/ |title=Particuliere Business school |publisher=Notenboom |accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref> and IVA Driebergen for the automotive industry with its earliest beginnings in 1930.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iva-driebergen.nl/index.php?pageID=30&n=47&s=73 |title=Meer dan tachtig jaar; IVA Driebergen |publisher=Iva-driebergen |accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Poland ===\n* [[SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities]]\n* [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin]]\nThere are 321 accredited private colleges in Poland.<ref>\u201eSzko\u0142y wy\u017csze i ich finanse w 2012 r.\u201d, s. 32, 2013-11-13.

UCP offers some well-recognized degrees and is reputed for the economics, law and business management degrees it awards at its Lisbon branch. Other degrees awarded by UCP, like biotechnology and dental medicine, amassed increasing success and popularity since the 2000s.\n\nAfter the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974, in the 1980s and 1990s, a boom of educational private institutions was experienced in Portugal, and many private universities started to open. Most had a poor reputation and were known for making it easy for students to enter and also to get high grades. In 2007, several of those private universities, or their heirs, were investigated and faced compulsory closing (for example, the infamous [[Independente University]] and [[Internacional University]] closings, and the [[Moderna University]] scandal) or official criticism with recommendations that the state-managed investigation proposed for improving their quality and avoid termination.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, within the [[Bologna process]], a reorganization of higher education was started which included more stringent regulations for private education and expanded state policies with regard to private education quality assurance and [[educational accreditation]]. In general, the private higher education institutions were often considered the schools of last resort for underachieving applicants who didn't score enough points in the admission examinations to enter the main public institutions.\n\nNearly open-admission policies have hurt private universities' reputation and the actual quality of their alumni. Without large endowments like those received, for example, by many US private universities and colleges which are attractive to the best scholars, researchers and students, the private [[list of higher education institutions in Portugal|higher education institutions of Portugal]], with a few exceptions, do not have either the financial support or the academic profile to reach the highest teaching and research standards of the top Portuguese [[public universities]]. In addition, most private universities have faced a restrictive lack of collaboration with the major enterprises which, however, have developed fruitful relationships with many public higher education institutions. Most Portuguese private universities specialise in a limited number of fields, most often in the [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]].\n\n=== Serbia ===\n{{Main|List of universities in Serbia}}\n\nThere are a number of private universities and independent [[Faculty (division)|faculties]] in Serbia, mostly in [[Belgrade]]. They were founded in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\n=== Switzerland ===\nFurther to the public [[Universities in Switzerland]], the country is well known for its high-quality private education system.\nFor a more complete listing, please consult:\n* the [[List of universities in Switzerland]]\n* the [[:Category:Business schools in Switzerland]]\n\n=== Turkey ===\nIn Turkey there are now 66 private universities. Bilkent University, founded in 1984, was the first.

It also facilitates the development of the higher educational system in Pakistan. Its main purpose is to upgrade the schools to be world-class centres of education, research and development. It also plays a leading role towards building a knowledge-based economy in Pakistan by giving out hundreds of doctoral scholarships for education abroad every year.\n\nIn spite of the criticism of the HEC, its creation has also had a positive impact on higher education in Pakistan. Its two-year report for 2004 to 2006 states that according to the Institute of Scientific Information, the total number of publications appearing in the 8,000 leading journals indexed in the web of science arising out of Pakistan in 2005 was 1,259 articles, representing a 41% increase over the past two years and a 60% increase since the establishment of HEC in 2002. The HEC digital library now provides access to over 20,000 leading research journals, covering about 75% of the world's peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n\nUntil 1991, there were only two recognized private universities in Pakistan: [[Aga Khan University]], established in 1983 and [[Lahore University of Management Sciences]], established in 1985. By 1997, however, there were 10 private universities. In 2001\u20132002, this number had doubled to 20. Among the first to gain degree awarding status was [[Hajvery University, Lahore]] (HU), established in 1990. In 2003\u20132004 Pakistan had a total of 83 private degree granting institutions.\n\n=== Saudi Arabia ===\nThere are nine private universities in Saudi Arabia:\n* [[Al Yamamah University]]\n* [[Alfaisal University]]\n* [[Arab Open University]]\n* [[Dar Al Uloom University]]<ref name=mohe>{{cite web|title=Private Universities|url=http://www.mohe.gov.sa/en/studyinside/privateedu/Pages/listphe.aspx|publisher=Ministry of Higher Education|accessdate=14 August 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423075451/http://www.mohe.gov.sa/en/studyinside/privateedu/Pages/listphe.aspx|archivedate=23 April 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Effat University]]\n* [[Fahd bin Sultan University]]<ref name=fbsuback>{{cite web|title=University background|url=http://www.fbsu.edu.sa/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1542&Itemid=459|publisher=FBSU|accessdate=14 August 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110194747/http://www.fbsu.edu.sa/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1542&Itemid=459|archivedate=10 November 2012}}</ref>\n* [[King Abdullah University of Science and Technology]]\n* [[Prince Mohammad bin Fahd University]]\n* [[Prince Sultan University]]\n\n=== Singapore ===\nStansfield College, founded in 1993, is a private higher education institution and a provider of the [[University of London International Programmes]] in [[Singapore]].

These mostly provide undergraduate degrees, with a limited few proving postgraduate degrees. The Informatics Institute of Sri Lanka (IIT),<ref>[http://www.iit.ac.lk/ www.iit.ac.lk]</ref> NSBM Green University (NSBM),<ref>[http://www.nsbm.ac.lk/ www.nsbm.ac.lk]</ref> Horizon Campus<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horizoncampus.edu.lk/|title=Horizon Campus|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2016}}</ref> and Sri Lanka Institute for Information Technology (SLIIT)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sliit.lk/|title=Home - Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology|work=Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology|accessdate=2 April 2016}}</ref> are examples. Some foreign universities franchise parts of their degree courses in Sri Lanka with local institutes. Students are charged for the study (some of these institutes are state funded institutions of their home countries) and these charges are often a fraction of the cost studying in the home countries of these institutions.\n\nEfforts to establish private universities have been blocked due to protests from state universities' undergraduates and leftist political parties.\n\nHowever many private colleges have sprung up one of which is the affiliated campus of Auston Institute of Management, Singapore. The Sri Lanka campus was established in 2010 and is a Board of Investment or (BOI) company. It retains a similar focus to the home campus and occupies a prime spot along Colombo's famous Galle Road.<ref name=\"auston.edu.lk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.auston.edu.lk|title=- Engineering and Project Management College in Sri Lanka|work=Auston|accessdate=2 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nAuston has been visited by many foreign universities and continues to expand its provision of titles in engineering and computing.<ref name=\"auston.edu.lk\"/>\n\n=== Syria ===\n* Al-Andalus University\n* Al Rasheed International University\n* [[Al-Shahba University]]\n* [[Al-Wataniya Private University]]\n* Aljazeera University\n* [[Arab International University]]\n* Ebla Private University\n* Hawash Private University\n* [[International University for Science and Technology]]\n* Ittihad Private University\n* [[Mamoun University for Science and Technology]]\n* [[Syrian Private University]]\n* University of Kalamoon\n* [[Wadi International University]]\n* [[Yarmouk Private University]]\n\n=== Taiwan ===\nIn Taiwan, unlike the United States, private universities are typically not as prestigious as some public (national) universities. They are not as highly ranked as public institutions, and also cost nearly twice as much. This is due to the form of testing in schools in Taiwan, in which students take a national entrance exam to determine their university qualifications.

Ho Chi Minh City Open University was one of the first. Typical characteristics of Vietnamese private universities {{as of | 2010 | lc = on}} are higher (very high in some cases) tuition fees, poor infrastructure, and limited faculty and human resources.\n\nPrivate universities are often named after scholars (Fulbright University Vietnam, Vo Truong Toan University, [[Nguyen Trai]] University, Luong The Vinh University, Chu Van A University, [[Alexandre Yersin|Yersin]] University, [[Phan Chau Trinh]] University), or heroes/legends ([[Hung Vuong]] University, [[Quang Trung]] University), although there are exceptions, such as [[FPT University]], named after the FPT Group and [[Tan Tao University]], in [[Tan Tao Group]].\n\nIn Vietnam, there exists the \"semi-private university\"; schools in this category can receive partial financial support from the government. Almost all private universities have to invite professors and lecturers from the state universities. Many lecturers from state-owned universities take up positions in private universities after their retirement.\n\n== Europe ==\n\n=== Austria ===\nIn [[Austria]], educational institutions must be authorised by the country to legally grant [[academic degree]]s. All state-run universities are governed by the 2002 Austrian Universities' and University Degree Programmes' Organisation Act (Federal Law Gazette No. 120/2002). In 1999, a federal law (''Universit\u00e4ts-Akkreditierungsgesetz'') was passed to allow the [[School accreditation|accreditation]] of private universities. The ''Akkreditierungsrat'' (Accreditation Council)<ref>[http://www.akkreditierungsrat.at/ Official website \u2013 ''Akkreditierungsrat'']</ref>  evaluates applicants and issues recommendations to the responsible Austrian accreditation authority (the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science & Research).\n\nAccreditation by the council yields a couple of privileges: degrees issued by accredited private universities have the same legal status as those issued by state-run universities. Private universities can appoint or promote [[professor]]s. Their students enjoy the same privileges pertaining to social security, foreigner law and state scholarships as students of the state universities. Educational services of private universities are not subject to [[value added tax]], and donations are tax deductible.\n\nAccreditations must be renewed regularly and can be withdrawn, e.g. in the case of repeated academic misconduct as happened in 2003 when the accreditation of [[International University Vienna]] was withdrawn. In 2006, when the accreditation of [[Imadec Executive Education|Imadec University]] expired, the Accreditation Council rejected requests for renewal.\n\nAustrian law provides that private universities in Austria must use the term ''Privatuniversit\u00e4t'' (literally, \"private university\") in their [[German language|German]] names, although their formal names in other languages are not regulated. Thus, there is the possibility of private institutions employing the term \"university\" as opposed to \"private university\" in their advertisements in all languages except German while still complying with Austrian law.\n\nWhile the legal definition of \"private university\" prohibits funding by the federal government of Austria, funding by other public bodies is not prohibited. Consequently, some of Austria's private universities are partly or wholly funded by provincial governments, while others are fully privately funded.\n\nAccreditation of private universities began in 2001. {{As of | 2020}}, Austria has 16 private universities. Most are small (fewer than 1000 students) and specialise in only one or two fields of study:\n\n* [[Anton Bruckner Private University]] \u2013 [[Linz]]\n* Bertha von Suttner Private University - Sankt P\u00f6lten\n* [[Catholic Private University Linz]]\n* [[Central European University]] - Vienna\n* [[Danube Private University]] \u2013 [[Krems an der Donau]]\n* Gustav Mahler Private University for Music - Klagenfurt am W\u00f6rthersee\n* [[Jam Music Lab|Jam Music Lab Private University for Jazz and Popular Music Vienna]]\n* Karl Landsteiner University of Health Sciences \u2013 [[Krems an der Donau]]\n* [[Music and Arts University of the City of Vienna]] \u2013 [[Vienna]]\n* [[MODUL University Vienna]] (2007)\n* [[New Design University St. P\u00f6lten]]\n* [[Paracelsus Medical University]] \u2013 [[Salzburg]]\n* [[Seeburg Castle University]] in Seekirchen \u2013 near Salzburg\n* [[Sigmund Freud University Vienna]]\n* [[UMIT - Private University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology]] \u2013 [[Hall in Tirol]]\n* [[Webster Vienna Private University]] (also accredited in the [[US]])\n\nFour former private universities are '''not accredited''' any more:\n* [[International University Vienna]]: Accreditation was withdrawn in 2003 due to academic misconduct.\n* [[Imadec Executive Education|Imadec University]]: First accreditation period ended in January 2006 and was not renewed.\n* TCM Privatuniversit\u00e4t Li Shi Zhen in [[Vienna]]: Accreditation period ended 2009; TCM did not call for renewal. All students could finish their studies.\n* [[PEF Private University of Management Vienna]]: The university closed for economic reasons in March 2012. All students could finish their studies.\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\n[[Bulgaria]] has a number of private universities, among which the most renowned are [[New Bulgarian University]], located in the capital city [[Sofia]]; Burgas Free University; [[Varna Free University]]; and [[American University in Bulgaria]].\n\n=== Finland ===\n[[Finland]] does not officially recognise private universities, but does not explicitly forbid them either. [[Helsinki School of Business]] is an example of one such educational institution operating in this market.\n\n=== France ===\n[[France]] has a dual system: universities and ''[[grandes \u00e9coles]].''\n\nIt is forbidden by law for a private institution to be called \"university\",<ref>{{Citation|title=Code de l'\u00e9ducation - Article L731-14|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=DE788FC36D1C3DEF7F1BE6989ABCDD09.tplgfr30s_2?idArticle=LEGIARTI000027748361&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071191&dateTexte=20180417|accessdate=2018-04-17}}</ref> and almost all universities are public. Some private institutions still openly call themselves \"universities\", such as the [[Lille Catholic University]], even if this has no legal basis. Universities provide courses in all academic fields (engineering, law, medical, economics, arts, business administration, sociology). One may join university after a high school degree and study there for a ''licence'' (bachelor), master's degree, or doctoral program, although again by law private institutions may not grant degrees called ''licence'' or ''doctorat''.\n\n''Grandes \u00e9coles'' can be public or private, but the most prestigious ones are public. These institutions operate mostly in engineering studies and business administration. Universities and ''grandes \u00e9coles'' compete in these two fields. Some of them report to the Ministry of Higher Education, such as [[Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech]] and [[Ecole Centrale Paris|\u00c9cole Centrale Paris]], and a few to the Ministry of Defense, such as [[Ecole Polytechnique|\u00c9cole Polytechnique]]. Several private ''grandes \u00e9coles'' are members of the [[Conf\u00e9rence des grandes \u00e9coles (CGE)|''Conf\u00e9rence des Grandes \u00c9coles'']], a lobbying group representing grandes \u00e9coles. Most ''grandes \u00e9coles'' can be joined after following two years of ''[[classe pr\u00e9paratoire aux grandes \u00e9coles]]'', an intensive program following the ''[[baccalaur\u00e9at]]''. A selective examination after the two additional years is taken to enter a ''grande \u00e9cole''. Following the [[Bologna Process]], this full 5 year cursus (two years of preparatory classes plus 3 years in engineering or business school) is equivalent to a master's degree.\n\nGrandes \u00e9coles for studying business administration are usually part of the [[Chamber of commerce|chambers of commerce]]. For example, [[HEC Paris|HEC]] is part of the Chamber of Commerce of Paris ([[Paris Chamber of Commerce|CCIP]]), and is therefore semi-private.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[Germany]] has 83 private universities (called ''Privathochschule'') and 45 church-run universities (called ''kirchliche Hochschule''). Similar to the state-run universities, they are subdivided into ''Universit\u00e4ten'' (research universities), ''[[Fachhochschule]]n'' (universities of applied science) and ''Kunst- und Musikhochschulen'' ([[art school]]s). Private universities in Germany need institutional accreditation by the state.\n\nThe first private university in Germany, the Ukrainian Free University, was established 16 September 1950 in Munich. [[Witten/Herdecke University]] opened in 1982 and [[Zeppelin University]] in 2003. Though private universities are numerous in Germany, they represent only less than 1% of all students. Some private universities, including [[Hanseatic University Rostock]] (2007\u20132009) and the International University in Germany in [[Bruchsal]], have gone out of business.\n\nMost of the church universities are run by the Protestant or Catholic churches; however, there is one Jewish university (''Hochschule f\u00fcr J\u00fcdische Studien'') in [[Heidelberg]].\n\n=== Greece ===\nIn [[Greece]] private universities are prohibited by [[Constitution of Greece|the constitution]] (Article 16).  However, laboratories of liberal studies (\u0395\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd, ergastiria eleftheron spoudon) operate freely in the country, and, based on a law from the 1930s they are registered as private for-profit businesses and regulated by the Greek Ministry of Commerce.  Their academic degrees, which are not recognised in Greece, are directly provided to students by foreign universities in the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States of America]], or other countries, usually through [[Franchising|franchise]] or validation agreements (the franchise agreement usually being considered better).  This has limited access to the laboratories, which usually teach in English, to high-income Greeks who for various reasons (usually family matters) did not want to go abroad.\n\nIn 2008 a law was introduced that forced all private institutions collaborating with foreign universities to offer programmes in the country, to register with the Greek Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs as ''[[college]]s'' (\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1, kollegia) by August 2009. Further amendments to the framework in 2010, 2012 and 2013 (4111/2013, 4093/2012) were introduced.

All [[List of universities in the Republic of Ireland|universities]], [[Regional Technical College|institutes of technology]], [[College of Education|colleges of education]], and the [[National College of Ireland]] and some religious institutions are publicly funded and therefore covered by ''free-fees'' initiative. There are few private colleges, and they are highly specialised, such as [[Griffith College Dublin]], [[Dorset College]] and [[Dublin Business School]]. The major representative body for private colleges in Ireland is the [[Higher Education Colleges Association]]. Private colleges in Ireland can seek to have their programmes validated/accredited by the [[Higher Education and Training Awards Council]].\n\nSee external links for: ''free-fees initiative''  and  ''Higher Education Colleges Association''.\n\n=== Netherlands ===\n[[Nyenrode]] is the only private university in the [[Netherlands]] at the graduate level. The university was founded in 1946. It serves as a [[graduate school]] for business and management. Both programs are taught in English.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Recently, Nyenrode merged with the Institute for CPA Education and both institutions share their facilities. The Nyenrode Business University also contains a campus and active student body.\n\nOther Dutch private universities are universities of applied science (HBOs) where one can obtain a bachelor's or master's degree but not a PhD. These include [[Wittenborg University]], Business School Notenboom (founded in 1958)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notenboom.nl/ |title=Particuliere Business school |publisher=Notenboom |accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref> and IVA Driebergen for the automotive industry with its earliest beginnings in 1930.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iva-driebergen.nl/index.php?pageID=30&n=47&s=73 |title=Meer dan tachtig jaar; IVA Driebergen |publisher=Iva-driebergen |accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Poland ===\n* [[SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities]]\n* [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin]]\nThere are 321 accredited private colleges in Poland.<ref>\u201eSzko\u0142y wy\u017csze i ich finanse w 2012 r.\u201d, s. 32, 2013-11-13.

UCP offers some well-recognized degrees and is reputed for the economics, law and business management degrees it awards at its Lisbon branch. Other degrees awarded by UCP, like biotechnology and dental medicine, amassed increasing success and popularity since the 2000s.\n\nAfter the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974, in the 1980s and 1990s, a boom of educational private institutions was experienced in Portugal, and many private universities started to open. Most had a poor reputation and were known for making it easy for students to enter and also to get high grades. In 2007, several of those private universities, or their heirs, were investigated and faced compulsory closing (for example, the infamous [[Independente University]] and [[Internacional University]] closings, and the [[Moderna University]] scandal) or official criticism with recommendations that the state-managed investigation proposed for improving their quality and avoid termination.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, within the [[Bologna process]], a reorganization of higher education was started which included more stringent regulations for private education and expanded state policies with regard to private education quality assurance and [[educational accreditation]]. In general, the private higher education institutions were often considered the schools of last resort for underachieving applicants who didn't score enough points in the admission examinations to enter the main public institutions.\n\nNearly open-admission policies have hurt private universities' reputation and the actual quality of their alumni. Without large endowments like those received, for example, by many US private universities and colleges which are attractive to the best scholars, researchers and students, the private [[list of higher education institutions in Portugal|higher education institutions of Portugal]], with a few exceptions, do not have either the financial support or the academic profile to reach the highest teaching and research standards of the top Portuguese [[public universities]]. In addition, most private universities have faced a restrictive lack of collaboration with the major enterprises which, however, have developed fruitful relationships with many public higher education institutions. Most Portuguese private universities specialise in a limited number of fields, most often in the [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]].\n\n=== Serbia ===\n{{Main|List of universities in Serbia}}\n\nThere are a number of private universities and independent [[Faculty (division)|faculties]] in Serbia, mostly in [[Belgrade]].

Players must complete songs in order to advance the story and unlock more songs.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nLanota's playing field is a circle with a gear in the middle, where notes originate. On the App Store, it is described as a \"plate\".<ref name=\"app description\">{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/tw/app/lanota/id1050535507|title=\u5728 App Store \u4e0a\u7684\u300cLanota\u300d|website=App Store|language=zh-TW|access-date=2018-02-20}}</ref> In game, it is referred to as the \"Notalium Tuner\". The player must tap(click), hold(catch), slide(rail), or flick the notes when they reach the outer ring of the circle in accordance to the beat. The plate changes sizes, spins, or moves around the screen in the middle of gameplay and the player must re-adjust themselves accordingly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://haogamers.com/lanota-save-the-world-though-the-sound-of-music-3fb97e45d472|title=Lanota: save the world though the sound of music \u2013 Haogamers|date=2016-11-01|work=Haogamers|access-date=2018-02-20}}</ref> Items will be picked up and stored as the player experiences the story. The story and items can be looked at by accessing the menu, which also includes options to customize the game interface. The player has the option to turn off background effects, change timing offset, tuner transparency, and tap note volume.\n\n===Scoring===\nThe notes are categorized and scored differently depending on timing: Harmony, Tune, and Fail. For platinum (not basic paid) subscription only, fast/slow indicator can be toggled (for Tune or for (inaccurate) Harmony). Tunes will always give fast/slow (if fast/slow is turned on), and certain \"inaccurate\" Harmonies will give fast/slow (if fast/slow Harmony is turned on). Harmony gives full points, Tune gives half points, and Fail gives no points. The score is also combo-based, to the max combo attained also affects the final score. All songs have a maximum score of 1,000,000. Depending on the final score, the player is given a rank.\n{{hideH|\u66f2\u76ee\u5217\u8868}}\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Rank !!
