[[Theia (planet)|Theia]], an early [[protoplanet]] the size of Mars, hit Earth in such a way that it ejected a considerable amount of material away from Earth. Some proportion of these ejecta [[escape velocity|escaped]] into space, but the rest consolidated into a single spherical body in orbit about Earth, creating the Moon.\n\nThe hypothesis requires a collision between a proto-Earth about 90% of the size{{clarify|reason=diameter or mass?|date=June 2019}} of present Earth, and another body the diameter of [[Mars]] (half of the terrestrial diameter and a tenth of its mass). The latter has sometimes been referred to as [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], the name of the mother of [[Selene]], the Moon [[goddess]] in [[Greek mythology]]. This size ratio is needed in order for the resulting system to have sufficient [[angular momentum]] to match the current orbital configuration. Such an impact would have put enough material into orbit around Earth to have eventually accumulated to form the Moon.\n\n[[Computer simulation]]s show a need for a glancing blow, which causes a portion of the collider to form a long arm of material that then shears off. The asymmetrical shape of the Earth following the collision then causes this material to settle into an orbit around the main mass. The energy involved in this collision is impressive: possibly trillions of tonnes of material would have been vaporized and melted. In parts of the Earth, the temperature would have risen to {{cvt|10000|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}.\n\nThe Moon's relatively small [[iron]] core (compared to other [[rocky planet]]s and moons in the Solar System) is explained by Theia's core mostly merging into that of Earth. The lack of [[volatiles]] in the lunar samples is also explained in part by the energy of the collision. The energy liberated during the reaccretion of material in orbit around Earth would have been sufficient to melt a large portion of the Moon, leading to the generation of a [[Lunar magma ocean|magma ocean]].\n\nThe newly formed Moon orbited at about one-tenth the distance that it does today, and spiraled outward because of [[tidal friction]] transferring angular momentum from the rotations of both bodies to the Moon's orbital motion. Along the way, the Moon's rotation became [[Tidal locking|tidally locked]] to Earth, so that one side of the Moon continually faces toward Earth. Also, the Moon would have collided with and incorporated any small preexisting satellites of Earth, which would have shared the Earth's composition, including isotopic abundances. The geology of the Moon has since been more independent of the Earth. Although this hypothesis explains many aspects of the Earth\u2013Moon system, there are still a few unresolved problems, such as the Moon's volatile [[chemical element|element]]s not being as depleted as expected from such an energetic impact.<ref>{{cite web |author = J.

In 2001, the most precise measurement yet of the [[isotopic signature]]s of [[moon rock]]s was published.<ref name=wiechert/> Surprisingly, the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] lunar samples carried an isotopic signature identical to Earth rocks, but different from other Solar System bodies. Because most of the material that went into orbit to form the Moon was thought to come from Theia, this observation was unexpected. In 2007, researchers from Caltech showed that the likelihood of Theia having an identical isotopic signature as the Earth is very small (less than 1 percent chance).<ref name=ps2007>{{Cite journal | last1=Pahlevan | first1=Kaveh | last2=Stevenson | first2=David | title=Equilibration in the Aftermath of the Lunar-forming Giant Impact | journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters | volume=262 | issue=3\u20134 |date=October 2007 | pages=438\u2013449 | doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2007.07.055 | bibcode=2007E&PSL.262..438P |arxiv = 1012.5323 }}</ref> Published in 2012, an analysis of titanium isotopes in Apollo lunar samples showed that the Moon has the same composition as Earth,<ref name=\"test\">\n[http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/4673/titanium-paternity-test-says-earth-is-the-moons-only-parent Titanium Paternity Test Says Earth is the Moon's Only Parent (University of Chicago)]</ref> which [[Giant impact hypothesis#Difficulties|conflicts]] with the Moon forming far from Earth's orbit.\n\nTo help resolve these problems, a new theory published in 2012 posits that two bodies\u2014each five times the size of Mars\u2014collided, then recollided, forming a large disc of mixed debris that eventually formed Earth and the Moon.<ref name=nasa1/> The paper was called \u201cForming a Moon with an Earth-like composition via a Giant Impact\u201d, by R.&nbsp;M.

Following the impact, the Moon formed closer to Earth than these satellites, and then spiraled outward, colliding with them. (If the Moon was more massive than the other satellites, its tidal effect on Earth would have been greater, making it spiral outward faster.) This led to the Moon being covered with material with the same composition as the satellites, and thus also Earth.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n\n\n{{multiple image|align=center\n|title=<center>Moon \u2013 [[Oceanus Procellarum]] (\"Ocean of Storms\")</center> |total_width=600 |width1=614 |height1=228 |image1=14-236-LunarGrailMission-OceanusProcellarum-Rifts-Overall-20141001.jpg|caption1=Ancient [[rift valley]]s \u2013 rectangular structure (visible \u2013 topography \u2013 [[Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory|GRAIL gravity gradients]]) (October 1, 2014).|width2=1500  |height2=1500 |image2=PIA18822-LunarGrailMission-OceanusProcellarum-Rifts-Overall-20141001.jpg|caption2=Ancient [[rift valley]]s \u2013 context.|width3=1546 |height3=905 |image3=PIA18821-LunarGrailMission-OceanusProcellarum-Rifts-Closeup-20141001.jpg|caption3=Ancient [[rift valley]]s \u2013 closeup (artist's concept).}}\n\n==Other hypotheses==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center; font-size:88%; float:right; margin-left:1em\"\n|- bgcolor= style=\"font-size: smaller;\"\n| colspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''Density'''<ref>[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/moonhab.html#c2 The Formation of the Moon]</ref>\n|-\n!

[[Theia (planet)|Theia]], an early [[protoplanet]] the size of Mars, hit Earth in such a way that it ejected a considerable amount of material away from Earth. Some proportion of these ejecta [[escape velocity|escaped]] into space, but the rest consolidated into a single spherical body in orbit about Earth, creating the Moon.\n\nThe hypothesis requires a collision between a proto-Earth about 90% of the size{{clarify|reason=diameter or mass?|date=June 2019}} of present Earth, and another body the diameter of [[Mars]] (half of the terrestrial diameter and a tenth of its mass). The latter has sometimes been referred to as [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], the name of the mother of [[Selene]], the Moon [[goddess]] in [[Greek mythology]]. This size ratio is needed in order for the resulting system to have sufficient [[angular momentum]] to match the current orbital configuration. Such an impact would have put enough material into orbit around Earth to have eventually accumulated to form the Moon.\n\n[[Computer simulation]]s show a need for a glancing blow, which causes a portion of the collider to form a long arm of material that then shears off. The asymmetrical shape of the Earth following the collision then causes this material to settle into an orbit around the main mass. The energy involved in this collision is impressive: possibly trillions of tonnes of material would have been vaporized and melted. In parts of the Earth, the temperature would have risen to {{cvt|10000|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}.\n\nThe Moon's relatively small [[iron]] core (compared to other [[rocky planet]]s and moons in the Solar System) is explained by Theia's core mostly merging into that of Earth. The lack of [[volatiles]] in the lunar samples is also explained in part by the energy of the collision. The energy liberated during the reaccretion of material in orbit around Earth would have been sufficient to melt a large portion of the Moon, leading to the generation of a [[Lunar magma ocean|magma ocean]].\n\nThe newly formed Moon orbited at about one-tenth the distance that it does today, and spiraled outward because of [[tidal friction]] transferring angular momentum from the rotations of both bodies to the Moon's orbital motion. Along the way, the Moon's rotation became [[Tidal locking|tidally locked]] to Earth, so that one side of the Moon continually faces toward Earth. Also, the Moon would have collided with and incorporated any small preexisting satellites of Earth, which would have shared the Earth's composition, including isotopic abundances. The geology of the Moon has since been more independent of the Earth. Although this hypothesis explains many aspects of the Earth\u2013Moon system, there are still a few unresolved problems, such as the Moon's volatile [[chemical element|element]]s not being as depleted as expected from such an energetic impact.<ref>{{cite web |author = J.

In 2001, the most precise measurement yet of the [[isotopic signature]]s of [[moon rock]]s was published.<ref name=wiechert/> Surprisingly, the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] lunar samples carried an isotopic signature identical to Earth rocks, but different from other Solar System bodies. Because most of the material that went into orbit to form the Moon was thought to come from Theia, this observation was unexpected. In 2007, researchers from Caltech showed that the likelihood of Theia having an identical isotopic signature as the Earth is very small (less than 1 percent chance).<ref name=ps2007>{{Cite journal | last1=Pahlevan | first1=Kaveh | last2=Stevenson | first2=David | title=Equilibration in the Aftermath of the Lunar-forming Giant Impact | journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters | volume=262 | issue=3\u20134 |date=October 2007 | pages=438\u2013449 | doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2007.07.055 | bibcode=2007E&PSL.262..438P |arxiv = 1012.5323 }}</ref> Published in 2012, an analysis of titanium isotopes in Apollo lunar samples showed that the Moon has the same composition as Earth,<ref name=\"test\">\n[http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/4673/titanium-paternity-test-says-earth-is-the-moons-only-parent Titanium Paternity Test Says Earth is the Moon's Only Parent (University of Chicago)]</ref> which [[Giant impact hypothesis#Difficulties|conflicts]] with the Moon forming far from Earth's orbit.\n\nTo help resolve these problems, a new theory published in 2012 posits that two bodies\u2014each five times the size of Mars\u2014collided, then recollided, forming a large disc of mixed debris that eventually formed Earth and the Moon.<ref name=nasa1/> The paper was called \u201cForming a Moon with an Earth-like composition via a Giant Impact\u201d, by R.&nbsp;M.

Following the impact, the Moon formed closer to Earth than these satellites, and then spiraled outward, colliding with them. (If the Moon was more massive than the other satellites, its tidal effect on Earth would have been greater, making it spiral outward faster.) This led to the Moon being covered with material with the same composition as the satellites, and thus also Earth.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n\n\n{{multiple image|align=center\n|title=<center>Moon \u2013 [[Oceanus Procellarum]] (\"Ocean of Storms\")</center> |total_width=600 |width1=614 |height1=228 |image1=14-236-LunarGrailMission-OceanusProcellarum-Rifts-Overall-20141001.jpg|caption1=Ancient [[rift valley]]s \u2013 rectangular structure (visible \u2013 topography \u2013 [[Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory|GRAIL gravity gradients]]) (October 1, 2014).|width2=1500  |height2=1500 |image2=PIA18822-LunarGrailMission-OceanusProcellarum-Rifts-Overall-20141001.jpg|caption2=Ancient [[rift valley]]s \u2013 context.|width3=1546 |height3=905 |image3=PIA18821-LunarGrailMission-OceanusProcellarum-Rifts-Closeup-20141001.jpg|caption3=Ancient [[rift valley]]s \u2013 closeup (artist's concept).}}\n\n==Other hypotheses==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center; font-size:88%; float:right; margin-left:1em\"\n|- bgcolor= style=\"font-size: smaller;\"\n| colspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''Density'''<ref>[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/moonhab.html#c2 The Formation of the Moon]</ref>\n|-\n!

''All My Children'' was the first new network daytime drama to debut in the 1970s. Originally owned by Creative Horizons, Inc., the company created by Nixon and her husband, Bob, the show was sold to ABC in January 1975.<ref>Wakefield, D: \"All Her Children\", page 115. Doubleday & Company, 1976<!-- ISBN needed --></ref> The series started at a half-hour in per-installment length, then was expanded to a full hour on April 25, 1977. Earlier, the show had experimented with the full-hour format for one week starting on June 30, 1975, after which ''[[Ryan's Hope]]'' premiered.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1990, ''All My Children'' was recorded at ABC's TV18 at 101 West 67th St, now a 50-story apartment tower. From March 1990 to December 2009, it was taped at ABC's Studio TV23 at 320 West 66th Street in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. In December 2009, the locale for taping the series moved from Manhattan to less costly [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], California. The show was then produced in Stages 1 and 2 at the Andrita Studios in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], California, from 2010 to 2011, and then at the Connecticut Film Center in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], Connecticut.<ref name=\"Soapcentral.com Relocate\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soapcentral.com/amc/news/2009/0803-moving_02.php|title=Rumor no more: All My Children relocating to Los Angeles|publisher=[[SoapCentral]]|date=August 4, 2009|accessdate=August 4, 2009}}</ref><ref>[http://sn.soapnet.go.com/news/article/huge-all-my-children-and-one-life-to-live-news Huge \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807095524/http://sn.soapnet.go.com/news/article/huge-all-my-children-and-one-life-to-live-news |date=August 7, 2009 }}, ''SOAPnet'', August 4, 2009</ref> ''All My Children'' started taping in high definition on January 4, 2010, and began airing in high definition on February 3, 2010.

Also, in a departure from societal norms at the time, ''All My Children'', in the mid-1970s, had an audience that was estimated to be 30% male.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913850-5,00.html Sex and Suffering in the Afternoon], TIME</ref> The show ranked No. 1 in the [[List of US daytime soap opera ratings|daytime Nielsen ratings]] in the 1978\u201379 season. Throughout most of the 1980s and into the early 1990s, ''All My Children'' was the No. 2 daytime soap opera on the air. However, like the rest of the soap operas in the United States, ''All My Children'' experienced unprecedented declines in its daytime ratings during the 2000s. By the 2010s, it had become one of the least watched soap operas in daytime television.\n\nOn April 14, 2011, ABC announced the cancellation of ''All My Children'' after a run of 41 years due to low ratings.<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter.com\">[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/abc-cancels-all-my-children-178666 ABC Cancels \"All My Children\", \"One Life to Live\"], ''The Hollywood Reporter'', April 14, 2011</ref> On July 7, 2011, ABC sold the licensing rights of ''All My Children'' to third-party production company [[Prospect Park (production company)|Prospect Park]] with the show set to continue on the internet as a series of [[webisode]]s.<ref name=\"ABC and Prospect Park \">{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/shows/one-life-to-live/OLTL-licensing-announcement |title=One Life to Live announcement |publisher=ABC Network |date=July 7, 2011 |accessdate=January 11, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021045607/http://abc.go.com/shows/one-life-to-live/OLTL-licensing-announcement |archivedate=October 21, 2012 }}</ref> The show taped its final scenes for ABC on August 30, 2011, and its final episode on the network aired on September 23, 2011, with a [[cliffhanger]].

When writing the [[Bible (writing)|story bible]], she designed the show so it would be a light-hearted soap opera that focused on social issues and young love.<ref name=\"Worlds Without End\">{{cite book|first1=Ron|last1=Simon|first2=Robert J.|last2=Thompson|first3=Louise|last3=Spence|first4=Jane|last4=Feuer|editor-first=Robert|editor-last=Morton|title=Worlds Without End: The Art and History of the Soap Opera|publisher=Harry N.

In one specific case, she used the model of the [[Erica Kane]] character to create a brand new ''Another World'' character named [[Rachel Cory Hutchins|Rachel Davis]]. Nixon said Rachel was Erica's \"precursor to the public ... [What] Erica and Rachel have in common is they thought if they could get their dream, they'd be satisfied... But that dream has been elusive\", Nixon said.<ref>Simon, p. 28.</ref><ref>Hyatt, p. 29.</ref>\n\n=== Creation ===\nABC later approached her to create a show that would reflect a more contemporary tone. That program became ''[[One Life to Live]]'', and it debuted in 1968. After the show became a success, the network asked her for another program, and she obliged by reviving her ''All My Children'' bible and the Erica Kane character.\n\nThe poem, written by Nixon, that appears in the title credits' photo album reads: {{quote|The Great and the Least,\nThe Rich and the Poor,\nThe Weak and the Strong,\nIn Sickness and in Health,\nIn Joy and Sorrow,\nIn Tragedy and Triumph,\nYou are ALL MY CHILDREN}}\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:Ruth Warwick Phoebe Tyler 1973.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ruth Warrick as Phoebe Tyler]]\n''All My Children'' debuted on January 5, 1970, replacing the canceled game show ''[[Dream House (game show)|Dream House]]''. [[Rosemary Prinz]] was signed on to be the \"special guest star\" for six months, playing the role of political activist Amy Tyler. Prinz was well known for her role of Penny Hughes on ''As the World Turns'' in the 1950s and 1960s, and she was added to the show to give it an initial boost due to her name value. From 1970 and into the 1980s, the show was either written by Nixon herself or by her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Wisner Washam]]. He was groomed by Nixon to eventually take over the reins in the 1980s while she focused on other endeavors, which included creating and launching ''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]'' in 1983. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nNixon strove to create a soap opera that was topical and could illustrate social issues for the audience.<ref name=\"NIXON\">{{cite web|title=NIXON, AGNES. U.S. Writer-Producer|work=museum.tv|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/N/htmlN/nixonagnes/nixonagnes.htm|accessdate=2007-07-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713081129/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/N/htmlN/nixonagnes/nixonagnes.htm|archivedate=July 13, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> She wanted this and a combination of regular humor for the series. To keep the action more real, she allowed the audience to locate her fictional \"Pine Valley\" on a map: situated a mere hour-long train ride from New York City. Many believed Pine Valley was in New York because of a town called [[Catlin, New York|Pine Valley]] in [[western New York]]. However, it was not until the 1980s that it was finally revealed that Pine Valley is actually in Pennsylvania, near [[Philadelphia]] and also near ''[[One Life to Live]]'s'' [[Llanview]]. (Nixon reportedly modeled the town on Rosemont, an actual suburb of Philadelphia.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.phillymag.com/articles/2007/06/08/legends-the-original-desperate-housewife/|title=Legends: The Original Desperate Housewife|last=Callahan|first=Michael|date=8 Jun 2007|website=Philadelphia Magazine|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe show's first action takes place around several families and characters. [[Phoebe Tyler Wallingford|Phoebe Tyler]] ([[Ruth Warrick]]), who fashions herself as \"Queen of Pine Valley,\" was the paradigm of a rich snob when she is introduced. A divorced mother, [[Mona Kane]] ([[Frances Heflin]]), and her spoiled daughter, [[Erica Kane|Erica]] ([[Susan Lucci]]) were also introduced. Contrasting this was the stable [[Joe Martin (All My Children character)|Martin family]], headed by patriarch Joe and later (after the death of her husband, Ted Brent) by matriarch Ruth, who became a symbolic foundation of ''All My Children''. Destined to break up the young romance of classmates [[Tara Martin]] ([[Karen Lynn Gorney]]) and Phil Brent ([[Richard Hatch (actor)|Richard Hatch]]), Erica learned that Phil was not the son of Ruth and Ted but, instead, the son of Ruth's sister, Amy Tyler ([[Rosemary Prinz]]) and her mother's friend, Nick Davis. In a selfish attempt to break up Phil and Tara, she told everyone the truth.\n\n''All My Children's'' first success was its focus on young love. ABC wanted a soap opera that would bring in young viewers, and slowly the program was accomplishing that.<ref name=\"NIXON\" /> The show's ratings did not start out strong, however. In its first year on the air, it ranked No. 17 out of 19 soap operas. Despite this, its audience grew with each passing year.\n\nThe show was unique for its use of the [[Vietnam War]]. Before ''All My Children'' debuted, no show had discussed the war in any depth. There were traditional Phoebe and free-spirited Amy both butting heads over the war, with Amy often leading protests around Pine Valley. When Amy left, Ruth takes over as the anti-war voice and protests against the war in the early 1970s. The character's protest speech in 1972 won [[Mary Fickett]] the first [[Emmy Award]] given to a soap opera performer. Later in the show's run, Phoebe softened.\n\nIn May 1972, the character of Erica Kane Martin became the first television character to undergo a legal abortion.<ref>{{cite news|title=Life Can Be Beautiful/Relevant|last=Astrachan|first=Anthony|date=March 23, 1975|work=New York Times Times}}</ref>\nMaking the abortion particularly controversial is Erica's reason for doing it, not because of her jeopardized health, but rather because she did not want to gain weight and lose her modeling job. The abortion story received much media attention, especially since it preceded the Roe vs. Wade decision by nearly a year. Within the story, Erica developed a potentially fatal infection after having the abortion, and the switchboards at ABC lit up with calls from doctors and nurses, offering their medical opinions on how best to treat the character's case.\n\nPhoebe's husband Charles ([[Hugh Franklin (actor)|Hugh Franklin]]) became close to Mona (Erica's mother and his secretary at the hospital). The two fell in love and Charles divorced Phoebe, even though she tried to blackmail Mona and even faked [[paralysis]]. In the end, Phoebe was left a drunken divorc\u00e9e and Mona becomes the new Mrs. Tyler. This ordeal starts the long-time Phoebe/Mona rivalry.\n\nWhen Eileen Letchworth, who portrayed Margo Flax Martin, contemplated a facelift, she talked it over with Nixon. Not only was Letchworth going to need time off, she was going to look significantly different when she returned to the show. Nixon approved and worked the facelift into a storyline. Margo wanted to impress the somewhat younger Paul Martin ([[William Mooney]]). Margo's facelift in 1974 became one of the first major storylines on television discussing [[plastic surgery]] and its psychological effects.\n\nIn June 1976, character [[Brooke English]] showed up on her Aunt Phoebe's doorstep and soon clashed with Erica over [[Tom Cudahy]] and Mark Dalton.  In 1976, when Kitty Shea Tyler was searching for her natural mother, the show introduced [[Myrtle Fargate|Myrtle Lum Fargate]] ([[Eileen Herlie]]).\n\nBy the late 1970s, the show had risen to the top of the ratings. One reason for the rise was the arrival of teenage prostitute Donna Beck (Candice Earley). Her relationship with the handsome Dr. Chuck Tyler breathed life into the show and captivated fans. Other new additions are the arrivals of aristocratic [[Palmer Cortlandt]] (aka Peter Cooney) ([[James Mitchell (actor)|James Mitchell]]), his somewhat creepy housekeeper Myra Murdock ([[Elizabeth Lawrence (actress)|Elizabeth Lawrence]]), and his overprotected daughter Nina ([[Taylor Miller]]), who, to Palmer's chagrin, entrances [[Cliff Warner|Dr. Cliff Warner]] ([[Peter Bergman]]). Palmer does everything in his power to break up the couple, including telling Nina she is going blind due to her diabetes. Palmer teams up with Cliff's past flame, nurse Sybil Thorne ([[Linda Gibboney]]), who confronts Cliff about fathering her son, but this is temporary; Sybil is murdered and Cliff is arrested for the crime, which actually was committed by Sean Cudahy (Alan Dysert). During the murder trial, Nina is astonished to learn that her mother, Daisy Cortlandt ([[Gillian Spencer]]), whom she believes to be dead, is, in fact, alive and living in Pine Valley as Monique Jonvil. To everyone's complete shock, Myra acknowledges that Daisy is her daughter. ''All My Children'' also found memorable villains in Billy Clyde Tuggle ([[Matthew Cowles]]) and Ray Gardner ([[Gil Rogers]]).\n\n''All My Children'' had always aired in color since its 1970 debut. The episodes were initially only saved for a short time on cartridge tapes and were eventually erased in order to tape other productions. Beginning in 1976, all the episodes were saved on cartridge tape and then digitally since the late 1990s. A few early episodes were saved on [[kinescope]] in black and white, one of which aired on ABC in 1997 on a special \"A Daytime To Remember\", which showcased all TV shows that aired on ABC Daytime. But there are no known pre-1976 episodes to be still in existence on tape.\n\nNixon personally owned all the early episodes on monochromatic kinescopes. When ABC purchased the rights to ''All My Children'' in 1975, it also received the kinescopes from Nixon with a promise that the network would archive them.

This is evident with her writing an autobiography, \"Raising Kane\", and turning it into a motion picture. When her presumed half-sister Silver (Deborah Goodrich) accuses her of murdering Kent Bogard (Michael Woods, Lee Godart), her former lover and boss, she goes on the run, fleeing to the [[Hollywood Hills]]. She does all this while posing as a [[Nun#Distinction between a nun and a religious sister|sister]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThe show made its first attempt at tackling the taboo topic of homosexuality in 1983.

Lynn however rebuffs her. Before this storyline, no other American soap opera had done a story about homosexuality.<ref name=goliath.ecnext.com />\n\nThe show tackled the issue of drug use when [[Mark La Mura]]'s character, [[Mark Dalton (All My Children)|Mark Dalton]], becomes addicted to cocaine after years of casual use. His half-sister, Erica, stages an intervention with his friends to have him confront his problems. They practice a [[tough love]]-policy that has Mark admit to the addiction. The informative episode showed how to hold an intervention, and the stages to go through for a successful confrontation. On March 18, 1985, the episode of ''All My Children'' included the scene while [[Erica Kane]] ([[Susan Lucci]]) met and became friends with [[Stephen J. Cannell]], the writer, creator, and producer of drama shows ''[[The A-Team]]'', ''[[Riptide (American TV series)|Riptide]]'', ''[[Hunter (1984 U.S. TV series)|Hunter]]'', and ''[[Wiseguy (TV series)|Wiseguy]]''.\n\nControversy was prompted in 1987 with the arrival of Cindy Parker ([[Ellen Wheeler]]), who would later fall in love with Stuart. The character was revealed to have [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. Through visits by now-Dr. Angie Hubbard, the show educated the public on how the disease was spread and how to prevent it. Cindy had contracted HIV from her husband, Fred, played by Mark Morrison who contracted it from sharing needles for drug use. Cindy is attacked by a vigilante hate group led by her niece, [[Skye Chandler]]. The tragedy of the attack shows the extremes of violence that occur every day to victims of the disease. Cindy marries Stuart and he adopts her son, Scott. She dies early in 1989 in one of the show's most watched episodes. ABC wanted changes at ''All My Children''. The show was getting about 6.5 million viewers per episode, but there was sentiment that the program had lost its unique sense of humor and was simply copying other soaps with [[action/adventure]] storylines. Efforts were made to bring the show back to the glory days of the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\n[[Felicia Minei Behr]] was hired as the new executive producer in early 1989. Having been a producer on [[Ryan's Hope]], Behr was familiar with ''All My Children'', having been an associate producer from 1970 to 1975. Among the stories featured was a baby storyline involving the characters of Adam, Brooke, Tad, and Dixie ([[Cady McClain]]). By this time, the show had also found a \"hit couple\" in Cecily and Nico (portrayed by [[Rosa Nevin]] and [[Maurice Benard]]), but Behr was unable to convince either to remain with the show, and the duo left at the end of 1989.\n\nABC was pleased with Behr; Nixon was as well, and decided her creation was safe in the hands of the new producer. Behr, however, made the unpopular decision to fire Peter Bergman (Cliff Warner) during this time, as well as Ellen Wheeler (Karen) and Robert Gentry (Ross Chandler). Bergman's departure was particularly frustrating to Debbi Morgan (who thought it was a cop-out by ABC on the promising interracial Angie/Cliff pairing; Morgan later defected to the new NBC soap opera ''[[Generations (U.S. TV series)|Generations]]'' in protest), Taylor Miller (who was misled when Behr approached her to bring back her character Nina; Miller was frustrated to find out she had only been brought back for two weeks to facilitate Bergman's departure: Cliff and Nina reunited, married yet again, and left Pine Valley, leaving Miller to lament to ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'' that she felt it was going backward for both characters, and difficult emotionally to play), and Bergman himself. Behr then brought back fan favorite Opal Gardner, but instead of contacting Emmy winner Dorothy Lyman to reprise the role, Behr hired [[Jill Larson]]. Lyman later noted her disappointment in never being contacted about reprising the role.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nAt the time of Behr's hiring in early 1989, the show usually ranked around No. 4 in the ratings. By 1990, it had inched up to the No. 3 spot. Billy Clyde Tuggle returns to Pine Valley in 1990, after a ten-year absence (in prison). He proceeds to undo the lives of many in Pine Valley. He tells his daughter, Emily Ann Sago, that he is her natural father, devastating her with the truth that she was the product of rape. He dies tumbling over a bridge (with Tad Martin), ending the reign of one of Pine Valley's most evil and entertaining characters ever.\n\nABC chose [[Megan McTavish]], a former actress who had been on the writing team since 1987, to be its new head writer. She was officially promoted to that position in 1992, with Nixon serving as executive head writer. Stories such as Molly's leukemia, Ceara Connor's ([[Genie Francis]]) [[incest]], Mona's lung cancer, and Deconstruction (a story about racism), were all praised in soap opera magazines for their social conscience. Other storylines included the ''Who Killed Will Cortlandt?'' mystery, Willow Lake Acres (a both humorous and serious tale about the plight of the elderly in a fraudulent nursing home), and a tornado that rocked Pine Valley. Behr also helped craft a story re-exploring Erica's father, Eric Kane. It was revealed he had faked his own death. In a comical twist, Erica finds him working as a clown in a traveling circus.\n\nMcTavish was also instrumental in a major but still popular [[retroactive continuity]] (retcon) storyline in 1993. Shortly after being introduced, the audience soon learns [[Kendall Hart]] ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]) is actually Erica's long-lost daughter. Kendall was conceived after Erica was raped on her 14th birthday by her father's actor friend Richard Fields. After she became pregnant, Erica gave her baby up for adoption to the Harts, a couple from Florida. Kendall comes to Pine Valley after finding out her birth mother is the famous Erica Kane. Kendall longs for Erica's approval<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steinback|first1=Sheila|title=Star of the Year 1994: AMC's Sarah Michelle Gellar|journal=Soap Opera Magazine|date=January 24, 1994}}</ref> but is also angry over her perceived feelings of being 'abandoned' at birth and comes to want payback against her mother.<ref name=\"Tracy\">{{cite book|author =Kathleen Tracy|title=The Girl's Got Bite: The Original Unauthorized Guide to Buffy's World ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlE1_oTihcUC&pg=PA63&dq=Kendall+Hart+soap+opera|isbn=0-312-31258-X|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2003|page=384}}</ref> Although they try to make their family work at first, Kendall acts out <ref>{{cite journal|title=Editor's Choice|journal=Soap Opera Digest|date=February 15, 1994}}</ref> and mother and daughter experience a painful, strained, and complicated relationship during this time in the series. The popular Gellar was proclaimed by some \"as the second coming of Erica\"<ref name=\"Tracy\" /> in her two years as Kendall Hart from 1993\u20131995 but left the show to pursue other acting opportunities. Producers ended up waiting at least six years before even contemplating to recast the role (which eventually went to [[Alicia Minshew]] in 2002).\n\nThe Santos, Dillon, Frye, and Keefer families were introduced during the 90s as well. Also, the [[Tad Martin and Dixie Cooney|Tad and Dixie]] pairing had become especially popular.<ref name=\"West1\">{{cite magazine|first=Abby |last=West |title=17 Great Soap Supercouples: Tad and Dixie |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2008-01-29 |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20174499_15,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201164527/http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0%2C%2C20174499_15%2C00.html |archivedate=February 1, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> The show also had other couples with great followings during this time: [[Dimitri Marick and Erica Kane|Dimitri and Erica]] ([[Michael Nader]]),<ref name=\"West2\">{{cite magazine|first=Abby |last=West |title=17 Great Soap Supercouples: Erica and Dimitri |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2008-01-29 |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20174499_10,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201164501/http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0%2C%2C20174499_10%2C00.html |archivedate=February 1, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> Trevor ([[James Kiberd]]) and Natalie ([[Kate Collins (actress)|Kate Collins]]), and Hayley ([[Kelly Ripa]]) and Brian (Gregory Gordon, [[Matt Borlenghi]], Brian L. Greene).\n\nBy the early/mid-1990s, some of McTavish's storytelling received criticism for being gimmick-driven (i.e. multiple dual roles, bomb plots). Reports soon surfaced that Behr and McTavish were having conflicts about storylines and the direction of the series. After the [[O.J. Simpson murder case|O.J. Simpson trial]] preempted daytime television programs throughout late 1994 and into 1995, many soaps saw their ratings decline, and ''All My Children'' was no different. When Megan McTavish was fired from her head writing post in the spring, former head writer [[Lorraine Broderick]] was tapped by Behr to lead the team once again.\n\nBroderick's tenure under Behr was popular among critics and fans for returning ''All My Children'' to its socially relevant, character-driven roots. Her most significant successes were Erica's drug addiction story (with the character receiving treatment at the [[Betty Ford Center]]), and also the story of [[homophobia]] over a gay high school boy and a history teacher.<ref name=goliath.ecnext.com /> However, with the ratings still stagnant, ABC did not renew longtime executive producer Felicia Minei Behr's contract, and brought in [[Francesca James]] (who had previously won an Emmy award acting on the show as twins Kitty and Kelly). The storylines now included a [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] arc with the popular [[Julia Santos|Noah and Julia]] ([[Keith Hamilton Cobb]] and [[Sydney Penny]]), a fantasy story for Myrtle featuring the \"real\" [[Santa Claus]], and finally a baby kidnapping story involving Erica.\n\nDespite winning three consecutive Daytime Emmys for writing during her tenure on ''All My Children'', Broderick was replaced in December 1997 by her predecessor, McTavish. The first major story McTavish tackled was, \"ironically\", one created by Broderick, [[Bianca Montgomery]]'s [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]]. The character of Bianca, Erica's young daughter, is checked into a facility to treat the disease. Apart from the anorexia story, McTavish's tales were plot-driven<ref name=\"sympatico.msn.ca\">{{cite magazine|first=Nelson |last=Branco |title=The plot to save 'All My Children': New head writers Barbara Esensten and James Harmon Brown dish on recasting Babe, Dixie's death, and creating a diverse canvas |magazine=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=2007-11-06 |url=http://entertainment1.sympatico.msn.ca/The+plot+to+save+All+My+Children/TV_Guide/Soaps/Features/Articles/070823_all_my_children_NB.htm?isfa=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013233937/http://entertainment1.sympatico.msn.ca/The%2Bplot%2Bto%2Bsave%2BAll%2BMy%2BChildren/TV_Guide/Soaps/Features/Articles/070823_all_my_children_NB.htm?isfa=1 |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and made implausible alterations to the show's history such as the resurrection of Erica's lifetime-love, Mike Roy (Nicholas Surovy). In 1998, the show again got a new executive producer, [[Jean Dadario Burke]], taking over from [[Francesca James]]. She would become known to many speculating fans as a weak producer with little vision.\n\n[[Cady McClain]], who had left the show as Dixie in 1996, returned to the delight of her fans, but other storylines\u2014involving ghosts, poison tattoos, Nazi art, and a sperm switch\u2014were all ill-received. By the start of 1999, with ''All My Children'' being voted as the \"Worst of 1998\" by ''Soap Opera Digest'', McTavish was once again fired. As ratings began to fall, ABC convinced Nixon to make a brief return. Many long-running actors, such as [[Michael Nader]], [[James Kiberd]], and [[Robin Mattson]], left their roles.\n\n=== 2000s ===\nNixon decided to write a story that would rejuvenate the show and be socially relevant at the same time. This resulted in the series revealing Erica's daughter Bianca as a lesbian. Within the series, Bianca admits the truth to her mother in December 2000. Although initially controversial, the storyline was praised by fans and critics.<ref name=\"soapcentral.com\">{{cite news|url=http://www.soapcentral.com/amc/news/2001/0302-gayawards.php|title=AMC's Bianca Storyline Applauded|publisher=[[SoapCentral]]|year=2001|accessdate=2007-10-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105041711/http://www.soapcentral.com/amc/news/2001/0302-gayawards.php|archivedate=November 5, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"AfterElton.com\">{{cite news|first=Karman |last=Kregloe |title=Soaps Come Clean About Gay Teens (page 3) |publisher=[[AfterEllen.com and AfterElton.com|AfterElton.com]] |date=March 23, 2006 |accessdate=2007-08-09 |url=http://www.afterelton.com/archive/elton/TV/2006/3/soaps3.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611155124/http://www.afterelton.com/archive/elton/TV/2006/3/soaps3.html |archivedate=June 11, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|first=Patrick D.|last=Healy|title=\nAfter Coming Out, a Soap Opera Heroine Moves On|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 24, 2005|accessdate=2007-10-14|url=\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/24/arts/television/24EDEN.html}}</ref> Bianca emerged as a [[List of breakout characters|breakout character]] and lesbian icon.<ref name=AfterElton.com /><ref name=nytimes.com /><ref name=\"WWW.afterellen.com\">{{cite web|first=Lisa |last=Yimm |title=Olga Sosnovska, AMC's Unlikely Lesbian Icon |publisher=[[AfterEllen.com]] |date=April 2004 |accessdate=2008-04-07 |url=http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/TV/amc-olga.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116110907/http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/TV/amc-olga.html |archivedate=January 16, 2008 }}</ref> The show found additional success in the pairing of newcomers [[Leo du Pres and Greenlee Smythe|Leo and Greenlee]] ([[Josh Duhamel]] and [[Rebecca Budig]]).<ref name=\"SoapOperaDigest.com\">{{cite magazine|title=Best New Couple|magazine=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|year=2000}}</ref><ref name=\"eyeonsoaps.net\">{{cite web|first=Carolyn |last=Aspenson |title=Redefining the Super Couple |publisher=eyeonsoaps.net |date=February 5, 2009 |accessdate=2009-03-05 |url=http://eyeonsoaps.net/wp/?p=1765 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627112608/http://eyeonsoaps.net/wp/?p=1765 |archivedate=June 27, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n[[Richard Culliton]] wrote several of ''All My Children's'' early 2000s (decade) storylines.

The town exists in the same fictional universe as other serial settings such as [[Llanview]] (''[[One Life to Live]]''), [[Port Charles, New York (fictional city)|Port Charles]] (''[[General Hospital]]'', ''[[Port Charles]]'', ''[[The Young Marrieds]]''), [[New York City]] (''[[Ryan's Hope]]'') and [[Corinth, Pennsylvania|Corinth]] (''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]'').\n\n=== Crossovers ===\nIn 2000, ''All My Children'', was featured in a major crossover event, that encompassed all the then existing ABC Daytime soap lineup. [[Linda Dano]] brought her ''[[One Life to Live]]'' character [[Rae Cummings]], to Pine Valley, where she connected with her mother [[Myrtle Fargate]]. It was also revealed during that storyline, that longtime existing ''All My Children'' character [[Skye Chandler]], was Rae's daughter. Skye, who had spent time on ''[[One Life to Live]]'' from  1999-2001, then followed Rae to Port Charles, the setting of the soaps ''[[General Hospital]]'' and ''[[Port Charles]]'', where she became a member of the [[Quartermaine family]], and made appearances until 2012.\n\n''All My Children'' has featured several crossovers with other ABC soaps, including an extensive 2004 'baby switch' storyline with ''One Life to Live'' which featured crossovers of over 20 characters between the two shows. In 2011, AMC did a comedic crossover with the [[TV Land]] comedy ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'', in which fictitious actress Victoria Chase (portrayed by [[Wendie Malick]] but credited as Chase) does a cameo appearance on AMC alongside Susan Lucci. In the ''Hot in Cleveland'' storyline, Chase and Lucci (portrayed as herself) are daytime-TV contemporaries and rivals.\n\nIn 2017, ''All My Children'' character [[Alexandra Devane]] appeared on ''[[General Hospital]]'', where she masqueraded as her sister [[Anna Devane]].\n\n== Ratings ==\n''For historical ratings information, see [[List of U.S. daytime soap opera ratings]]''\n\n;Years as No. 1 series\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n!

When writing the [[Bible (writing)|story bible]], she designed the show so it would be a light-hearted soap opera that focused on social issues and young love.<ref name=\"Worlds Without End\">{{cite book|first1=Ron|last1=Simon|first2=Robert J.|last2=Thompson|first3=Louise|last3=Spence|first4=Jane|last4=Feuer|editor-first=Robert|editor-last=Morton|title=Worlds Without End: The Art and History of the Soap Opera|publisher=Harry N.

In one specific case, she used the model of the [[Erica Kane]] character to create a brand new ''Another World'' character named [[Rachel Cory Hutchins|Rachel Davis]]. Nixon said Rachel was Erica's \"precursor to the public ... [What] Erica and Rachel have in common is they thought if they could get their dream, they'd be satisfied... But that dream has been elusive\", Nixon said.<ref>Simon, p. 28.</ref><ref>Hyatt, p. 29.</ref>\n\n=== Creation ===\nABC later approached her to create a show that would reflect a more contemporary tone. That program became ''[[One Life to Live]]'', and it debuted in 1968. After the show became a success, the network asked her for another program, and she obliged by reviving her ''All My Children'' bible and the Erica Kane character.\n\nThe poem, written by Nixon, that appears in the title credits' photo album reads: {{quote|The Great and the Least,\nThe Rich and the Poor,\nThe Weak and the Strong,\nIn Sickness and in Health,\nIn Joy and Sorrow,\nIn Tragedy and Triumph,\nYou are ALL MY CHILDREN}}\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:Ruth Warwick Phoebe Tyler 1973.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ruth Warrick as Phoebe Tyler]]\n''All My Children'' debuted on January 5, 1970, replacing the canceled game show ''[[Dream House (game show)|Dream House]]''. [[Rosemary Prinz]] was signed on to be the \"special guest star\" for six months, playing the role of political activist Amy Tyler. Prinz was well known for her role of Penny Hughes on ''As the World Turns'' in the 1950s and 1960s, and she was added to the show to give it an initial boost due to her name value. From 1970 and into the 1980s, the show was either written by Nixon herself or by her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Wisner Washam]]. He was groomed by Nixon to eventually take over the reins in the 1980s while she focused on other endeavors, which included creating and launching ''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]'' in 1983. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nNixon strove to create a soap opera that was topical and could illustrate social issues for the audience.<ref name=\"NIXON\">{{cite web|title=NIXON, AGNES. U.S. Writer-Producer|work=museum.tv|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/N/htmlN/nixonagnes/nixonagnes.htm|accessdate=2007-07-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713081129/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/N/htmlN/nixonagnes/nixonagnes.htm|archivedate=July 13, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> She wanted this and a combination of regular humor for the series. To keep the action more real, she allowed the audience to locate her fictional \"Pine Valley\" on a map: situated a mere hour-long train ride from New York City. Many believed Pine Valley was in New York because of a town called [[Catlin, New York|Pine Valley]] in [[western New York]]. However, it was not until the 1980s that it was finally revealed that Pine Valley is actually in Pennsylvania, near [[Philadelphia]] and also near ''[[One Life to Live]]'s'' [[Llanview]]. (Nixon reportedly modeled the town on Rosemont, an actual suburb of Philadelphia.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.phillymag.com/articles/2007/06/08/legends-the-original-desperate-housewife/|title=Legends: The Original Desperate Housewife|last=Callahan|first=Michael|date=8 Jun 2007|website=Philadelphia Magazine|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe show's first action takes place around several families and characters. [[Phoebe Tyler Wallingford|Phoebe Tyler]] ([[Ruth Warrick]]), who fashions herself as \"Queen of Pine Valley,\" was the paradigm of a rich snob when she is introduced. A divorced mother, [[Mona Kane]] ([[Frances Heflin]]), and her spoiled daughter, [[Erica Kane|Erica]] ([[Susan Lucci]]) were also introduced. Contrasting this was the stable [[Joe Martin (All My Children character)|Martin family]], headed by patriarch Joe and later (after the death of her husband, Ted Brent) by matriarch Ruth, who became a symbolic foundation of ''All My Children''. Destined to break up the young romance of classmates [[Tara Martin]] ([[Karen Lynn Gorney]]) and Phil Brent ([[Richard Hatch (actor)|Richard Hatch]]), Erica learned that Phil was not the son of Ruth and Ted but, instead, the son of Ruth's sister, Amy Tyler ([[Rosemary Prinz]]) and her mother's friend, Nick Davis. In a selfish attempt to break up Phil and Tara, she told everyone the truth.\n\n''All My Children's'' first success was its focus on young love. ABC wanted a soap opera that would bring in young viewers, and slowly the program was accomplishing that.<ref name=\"NIXON\" /> The show's ratings did not start out strong, however. In its first year on the air, it ranked No. 17 out of 19 soap operas. Despite this, its audience grew with each passing year.\n\nThe show was unique for its use of the [[Vietnam War]]. Before ''All My Children'' debuted, no show had discussed the war in any depth. There were traditional Phoebe and free-spirited Amy both butting heads over the war, with Amy often leading protests around Pine Valley. When Amy left, Ruth takes over as the anti-war voice and protests against the war in the early 1970s. The character's protest speech in 1972 won [[Mary Fickett]] the first [[Emmy Award]] given to a soap opera performer. Later in the show's run, Phoebe softened.\n\nIn May 1972, the character of Erica Kane Martin became the first television character to undergo a legal abortion.<ref>{{cite news|title=Life Can Be Beautiful/Relevant|last=Astrachan|first=Anthony|date=March 23, 1975|work=New York Times Times}}</ref>\nMaking the abortion particularly controversial is Erica's reason for doing it, not because of her jeopardized health, but rather because she did not want to gain weight and lose her modeling job. The abortion story received much media attention, especially since it preceded the Roe vs. Wade decision by nearly a year. Within the story, Erica developed a potentially fatal infection after having the abortion, and the switchboards at ABC lit up with calls from doctors and nurses, offering their medical opinions on how best to treat the character's case.\n\nPhoebe's husband Charles ([[Hugh Franklin (actor)|Hugh Franklin]]) became close to Mona (Erica's mother and his secretary at the hospital). The two fell in love and Charles divorced Phoebe, even though she tried to blackmail Mona and even faked [[paralysis]]. In the end, Phoebe was left a drunken divorc\u00e9e and Mona becomes the new Mrs. Tyler. This ordeal starts the long-time Phoebe/Mona rivalry.\n\nWhen Eileen Letchworth, who portrayed Margo Flax Martin, contemplated a facelift, she talked it over with Nixon. Not only was Letchworth going to need time off, she was going to look significantly different when she returned to the show. Nixon approved and worked the facelift into a storyline. Margo wanted to impress the somewhat younger Paul Martin ([[William Mooney]]). Margo's facelift in 1974 became one of the first major storylines on television discussing [[plastic surgery]] and its psychological effects.\n\nIn June 1976, character [[Brooke English]] showed up on her Aunt Phoebe's doorstep and soon clashed with Erica over [[Tom Cudahy]] and Mark Dalton.  In 1976, when Kitty Shea Tyler was searching for her natural mother, the show introduced [[Myrtle Fargate|Myrtle Lum Fargate]] ([[Eileen Herlie]]).\n\nBy the late 1970s, the show had risen to the top of the ratings. One reason for the rise was the arrival of teenage prostitute Donna Beck (Candice Earley). Her relationship with the handsome Dr. Chuck Tyler breathed life into the show and captivated fans. Other new additions are the arrivals of aristocratic [[Palmer Cortlandt]] (aka Peter Cooney) ([[James Mitchell (actor)|James Mitchell]]), his somewhat creepy housekeeper Myra Murdock ([[Elizabeth Lawrence (actress)|Elizabeth Lawrence]]), and his overprotected daughter Nina ([[Taylor Miller]]), who, to Palmer's chagrin, entrances [[Cliff Warner|Dr. Cliff Warner]] ([[Peter Bergman]]). Palmer does everything in his power to break up the couple, including telling Nina she is going blind due to her diabetes. Palmer teams up with Cliff's past flame, nurse Sybil Thorne ([[Linda Gibboney]]), who confronts Cliff about fathering her son, but this is temporary; Sybil is murdered and Cliff is arrested for the crime, which actually was committed by Sean Cudahy (Alan Dysert). During the murder trial, Nina is astonished to learn that her mother, Daisy Cortlandt ([[Gillian Spencer]]), whom she believes to be dead, is, in fact, alive and living in Pine Valley as Monique Jonvil. To everyone's complete shock, Myra acknowledges that Daisy is her daughter. ''All My Children'' also found memorable villains in Billy Clyde Tuggle ([[Matthew Cowles]]) and Ray Gardner ([[Gil Rogers]]).\n\n''All My Children'' had always aired in color since its 1970 debut. The episodes were initially only saved for a short time on cartridge tapes and were eventually erased in order to tape other productions. Beginning in 1976, all the episodes were saved on cartridge tape and then digitally since the late 1990s. A few early episodes were saved on [[kinescope]] in black and white, one of which aired on ABC in 1997 on a special \"A Daytime To Remember\", which showcased all TV shows that aired on ABC Daytime. But there are no known pre-1976 episodes to be still in existence on tape.\n\nNixon personally owned all the early episodes on monochromatic kinescopes. When ABC purchased the rights to ''All My Children'' in 1975, it also received the kinescopes from Nixon with a promise that the network would archive them. However, that promise was nearly broken, because different sources point out that most of them were either lost in a warehouse fire or were erased. As mentioned above, a few early episodes survive.\n\n=== 1980s ===\nThe early 1980s is considered a \"golden period\" for the show and the \"Golden Age\" for [[supercouple]]s.<ref name=\"NIXON\" /><ref name=\".amazon.com\">{{cite web|first=Bill and Susan|last=Hayes|title=Like Sands Through The Hourglass|publisher=NAL Hardcover|accessdate=2007-09-06|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0451216601}}</ref><ref name=\"soapoperadigest.com\">{{cite web|first=Janet|last=Di Lauro|title=Supercouples: A Relic From the '80s or Still Alive and Kissing?|publisher=soapoperadigest.com|accessdate=2007-09-06|url=http://soapoperadigest.com/features/supercouples/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906220936/http://soapoperadigest.com/features/supercouples|archivedate=September 6, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Younger characters, such as [[Greg Nelson and Jenny Gardner]] ([[Laurence Lau]] and [[Kim Delaney]]), [[Liza Colby]] ([[Marcy Walker]]), Liza's best friend Amanda ([[Amanda Bearse]]), [[Jesse Hubbard and Angie Baxter]] ([[Darnell Williams]] and [[Debbi Morgan]]), and a now-grown-up [[Tad Martin (All My Children)|Tad Martin]] ([[Michael E.

Opal greatly showcased ''All My Children'''s attempt at humor and satire. Also introduced in the 1980s were powerful businessman [[Adam Chandler]] and his identical twin brother [[Stuart Chandler|Stuart]] (both played by [[David Canary]]), the first arrival of members of the [[Chandler family]].

This is evident with her writing an autobiography, \"Raising Kane\", and turning it into a motion picture. When her presumed half-sister Silver (Deborah Goodrich) accuses her of murdering Kent Bogard (Michael Woods, Lee Godart), her former lover and boss, she goes on the run, fleeing to the [[Hollywood Hills]]. She does all this while posing as a [[Nun#Distinction between a nun and a religious sister|sister]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThe show made its first attempt at tackling the taboo topic of homosexuality in 1983. [[Tricia Pursley]] portrayed the divorced Devon McFadden, who believes she is falling in love with her [[lesbian]] psychiatrist, Lynn Carson (portrayed by [[Donna Pescow]]).<ref name=\"goliath.ecnext.com\">{{cite book|author =C.

Lynn however rebuffs her. Before this storyline, no other American soap opera had done a story about homosexuality.<ref name=goliath.ecnext.com />\n\nThe show tackled the issue of drug use when [[Mark La Mura]]'s character, [[Mark Dalton (All My Children)|Mark Dalton]], becomes addicted to cocaine after years of casual use. His half-sister, Erica, stages an intervention with his friends to have him confront his problems. They practice a [[tough love]]-policy that has Mark admit to the addiction. The informative episode showed how to hold an intervention, and the stages to go through for a successful confrontation. On March 18, 1985, the episode of ''All My Children'' included the scene while [[Erica Kane]] ([[Susan Lucci]]) met and became friends with [[Stephen J. Cannell]], the writer, creator, and producer of drama shows ''[[The A-Team]]'', ''[[Riptide (American TV series)|Riptide]]'', ''[[Hunter (1984 U.S. TV series)|Hunter]]'', and ''[[Wiseguy (TV series)|Wiseguy]]''.\n\nControversy was prompted in 1987 with the arrival of Cindy Parker ([[Ellen Wheeler]]), who would later fall in love with Stuart. The character was revealed to have [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. Through visits by now-Dr. Angie Hubbard, the show educated the public on how the disease was spread and how to prevent it. Cindy had contracted HIV from her husband, Fred, played by Mark Morrison who contracted it from sharing needles for drug use. Cindy is attacked by a vigilante hate group led by her niece, [[Skye Chandler]]. The tragedy of the attack shows the extremes of violence that occur every day to victims of the disease. Cindy marries Stuart and he adopts her son, Scott. She dies early in 1989 in one of the show's most watched episodes. ABC wanted changes at ''All My Children''. The show was getting about 6.5 million viewers per episode, but there was sentiment that the program had lost its unique sense of humor and was simply copying other soaps with [[action/adventure]] storylines. Efforts were made to bring the show back to the glory days of the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\n[[Felicia Minei Behr]] was hired as the new executive producer in early 1989. Having been a producer on [[Ryan's Hope]], Behr was familiar with ''All My Children'', having been an associate producer from 1970 to 1975. Among the stories featured was a baby storyline involving the characters of Adam, Brooke, Tad, and Dixie ([[Cady McClain]]). By this time, the show had also found a \"hit couple\" in Cecily and Nico (portrayed by [[Rosa Nevin]] and [[Maurice Benard]]), but Behr was unable to convince either to remain with the show, and the duo left at the end of 1989.\n\nABC was pleased with Behr; Nixon was as well, and decided her creation was safe in the hands of the new producer. Behr, however, made the unpopular decision to fire Peter Bergman (Cliff Warner) during this time, as well as Ellen Wheeler (Karen) and Robert Gentry (Ross Chandler). Bergman's departure was particularly frustrating to Debbi Morgan (who thought it was a cop-out by ABC on the promising interracial Angie/Cliff pairing; Morgan later defected to the new NBC soap opera ''[[Generations (U.S. TV series)|Generations]]'' in protest), Taylor Miller (who was misled when Behr approached her to bring back her character Nina; Miller was frustrated to find out she had only been brought back for two weeks to facilitate Bergman's departure: Cliff and Nina reunited, married yet again, and left Pine Valley, leaving Miller to lament to ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'' that she felt it was going backward for both characters, and difficult emotionally to play), and Bergman himself. Behr then brought back fan favorite Opal Gardner, but instead of contacting Emmy winner Dorothy Lyman to reprise the role, Behr hired [[Jill Larson]]. Lyman later noted her disappointment in never being contacted about reprising the role.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nAt the time of Behr's hiring in early 1989, the show usually ranked around No. 4 in the ratings. By 1990, it had inched up to the No. 3 spot. Billy Clyde Tuggle returns to Pine Valley in 1990, after a ten-year absence (in prison). He proceeds to undo the lives of many in Pine Valley. He tells his daughter, Emily Ann Sago, that he is her natural father, devastating her with the truth that she was the product of rape. He dies tumbling over a bridge (with Tad Martin), ending the reign of one of Pine Valley's most evil and entertaining characters ever.\n\nABC chose [[Megan McTavish]], a former actress who had been on the writing team since 1987, to be its new head writer. She was officially promoted to that position in 1992, with Nixon serving as executive head writer. Stories such as Molly's leukemia, Ceara Connor's ([[Genie Francis]]) [[incest]], Mona's lung cancer, and Deconstruction (a story about racism), were all praised in soap opera magazines for their social conscience. Other storylines included the ''Who Killed Will Cortlandt?'' mystery, Willow Lake Acres (a both humorous and serious tale about the plight of the elderly in a fraudulent nursing home), and a tornado that rocked Pine Valley. Behr also helped craft a story re-exploring Erica's father, Eric Kane. It was revealed he had faked his own death. In a comical twist, Erica finds him working as a clown in a traveling circus.\n\nMcTavish was also instrumental in a major but still popular [[retroactive continuity]] (retcon) storyline in 1993. Shortly after being introduced, the audience soon learns [[Kendall Hart]] ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]) is actually Erica's long-lost daughter. Kendall was conceived after Erica was raped on her 14th birthday by her father's actor friend Richard Fields. After she became pregnant, Erica gave her baby up for adoption to the Harts, a couple from Florida. Kendall comes to Pine Valley after finding out her birth mother is the famous Erica Kane. Kendall longs for Erica's approval<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steinback|first1=Sheila|title=Star of the Year 1994: AMC's Sarah Michelle Gellar|journal=Soap Opera Magazine|date=January 24, 1994}}</ref> but is also angry over her perceived feelings of being 'abandoned' at birth and comes to want payback against her mother.<ref name=\"Tracy\">{{cite book|author =Kathleen Tracy|title=The Girl's Got Bite: The Original Unauthorized Guide to Buffy's World ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlE1_oTihcUC&pg=PA63&dq=Kendall+Hart+soap+opera|isbn=0-312-31258-X|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2003|page=384}}</ref> Although they try to make their family work at first, Kendall acts out <ref>{{cite journal|title=Editor's Choice|journal=Soap Opera Digest|date=February 15, 1994}}</ref> and mother and daughter experience a painful, strained, and complicated relationship during this time in the series. The popular Gellar was proclaimed by some \"as the second coming of Erica\"<ref name=\"Tracy\" /> in her two years as Kendall Hart from 1993\u20131995 but left the show to pursue other acting opportunities. Producers ended up waiting at least six years before even contemplating to recast the role (which eventually went to [[Alicia Minshew]] in 2002).\n\nThe Santos, Dillon, Frye, and Keefer families were introduced during the 90s as well. Also, the [[Tad Martin and Dixie Cooney|Tad and Dixie]] pairing had become especially popular.<ref name=\"West1\">{{cite magazine|first=Abby |last=West |title=17 Great Soap Supercouples: Tad and Dixie |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2008-01-29 |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20174499_15,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201164527/http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0%2C%2C20174499_15%2C00.html |archivedate=February 1, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> The show also had other couples with great followings during this time: [[Dimitri Marick and Erica Kane|Dimitri and Erica]] ([[Michael Nader]]),<ref name=\"West2\">{{cite magazine|first=Abby |last=West |title=17 Great Soap Supercouples: Erica and Dimitri |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2008-01-29 |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20174499_10,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201164501/http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0%2C%2C20174499_10%2C00.html |archivedate=February 1, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> Trevor ([[James Kiberd]]) and Natalie ([[Kate Collins (actress)|Kate Collins]]), and Hayley ([[Kelly Ripa]]) and Brian (Gregory Gordon, [[Matt Borlenghi]], Brian L. Greene).\n\nBy the early/mid-1990s, some of McTavish's storytelling received criticism for being gimmick-driven (i.e. multiple dual roles, bomb plots). Reports soon surfaced that Behr and McTavish were having conflicts about storylines and the direction of the series. After the [[O.J. Simpson murder case|O.J. Simpson trial]] preempted daytime television programs throughout late 1994 and into 1995, many soaps saw their ratings decline, and ''All My Children'' was no different. When Megan McTavish was fired from her head writing post in the spring, former head writer [[Lorraine Broderick]] was tapped by Behr to lead the team once again.\n\nBroderick's tenure under Behr was popular among critics and fans for returning ''All My Children'' to its socially relevant, character-driven roots. Her most significant successes were Erica's drug addiction story (with the character receiving treatment at the [[Betty Ford Center]]), and also the story of [[homophobia]] over a gay high school boy and a history teacher.<ref name=goliath.ecnext.com /> However, with the ratings still stagnant, ABC did not renew longtime executive producer Felicia Minei Behr's contract, and brought in [[Francesca James]] (who had previously won an Emmy award acting on the show as twins Kitty and Kelly). The storylines now included a [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] arc with the popular [[Julia Santos|Noah and Julia]] ([[Keith Hamilton Cobb]] and [[Sydney Penny]]), a fantasy story for Myrtle featuring the \"real\" [[Santa Claus]], and finally a baby kidnapping story involving Erica.\n\nDespite winning three consecutive Daytime Emmys for writing during her tenure on ''All My Children'', Broderick was replaced in December 1997 by her predecessor, McTavish.

The town exists in the same fictional universe as other serial settings such as [[Llanview]] (''[[One Life to Live]]''), [[Port Charles, New York (fictional city)|Port Charles]] (''[[General Hospital]]'', ''[[Port Charles]]'', ''[[The Young Marrieds]]''), [[New York City]] (''[[Ryan's Hope]]'') and [[Corinth, Pennsylvania|Corinth]] (''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]'').\n\n=== Crossovers ===\nIn 2000, ''All My Children'', was featured in a major crossover event, that encompassed all the then existing ABC Daytime soap lineup. [[Linda Dano]] brought her ''[[One Life to Live]]'' character [[Rae Cummings]], to Pine Valley, where she connected with her mother [[Myrtle Fargate]]. It was also revealed during that storyline, that longtime existing ''All My Children'' character [[Skye Chandler]], was Rae's daughter. Skye, who had spent time on ''[[One Life to Live]]'' from  1999-2001, then followed Rae to Port Charles, the setting of the soaps ''[[General Hospital]]'' and ''[[Port Charles]]'', where she became a member of the [[Quartermaine family]], and made appearances until 2012.\n\n''All My Children'' has featured several crossovers with other ABC soaps, including an extensive 2004 'baby switch' storyline with ''One Life to Live'' which featured crossovers of over 20 characters between the two shows. In 2011, AMC did a comedic crossover with the [[TV Land]] comedy ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'', in which fictitious actress Victoria Chase (portrayed by [[Wendie Malick]] but credited as Chase) does a cameo appearance on AMC alongside Susan Lucci. In the ''Hot in Cleveland'' storyline, Chase and Lucci (portrayed as herself) are daytime-TV contemporaries and rivals.\n\nIn 2017, ''All My Children'' character [[Alexandra Devane]] appeared on ''[[General Hospital]]'', where she masqueraded as her sister [[Anna Devane]].\n\n== Ratings ==\n''For historical ratings information, see [[List of U.S. daytime soap opera ratings]]''\n\n;Years as No. 1 series\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n!

{"title_page": "Bering Sea Arbitration", "text_new": "The '''Bering Sea Arbitration of 1893''' arose out of a [[fishery]] dispute between the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and the [[United States]] in the 1880s. The United States Revenue Cutter Service, today known as the [[United States Coast Guard]], captured several Canadian sealer vessels throughout the conflict. Diplomatic representations followed the capture of the first three ships and an order for release was issued by the British imperial government (then still in charge of foreign affairs for the Dominion of Canada), but it did nothing to stop the seizures and none were released. This led to the U.S. claiming exclusive jurisdiction over the sealing industry in the [[Bering Sea]], and that led to negotiations outside of the courts. The award was given in favor of the British, however, and the Americans were denied exclusive jurisdiction. The British were awarded compensation for the damage that had been inflicted on their vessels, and the American sealing zone remained as it was prior to the conflict (60 miles).\n\n==Origins==\nIn 1867 the United States government purchased from [[Russia]] all her territorial rights in [[Alaska]] and the adjacent islands. The boundary between the two countries was a line drawn from the middle of the [[Bering Strait]] south-west to a point midway between the [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutian]] and [[Komandorski Islands]] dividing the Bering Sea into two parts, the larger being on the American side. This portion included the [[Pribilof Islands]], the principal breeding-grounds of the seals in those seas.\n\nBy [[Acts of Congress]], passed between 1868 and 1873, the killing of seals was prohibited on the Pribilof Islands and in \"the waters adjacent thereto\" except upon certain specified conditions. This created a large swathe of friction between the executive and legislative branches of the US government with the [[presidential veto]] employed by [[Ulysses S. Grant]] on two notable occasions.   No definition of the meaning of the words \"waters adjacent\" was given in the act. In 1870 the exclusive rights of killing seals on these islands was leased by the United States to the [[Alaska Commercial Company]], on conditions limiting the numbers to be taken annually, and otherwise providing for their protection. As early as 1872, the operations of foreign sealers attracted the attention of the United States' government, but any precautions then taken seem to have been directed against the capture of seals on their way through the passages between the Aleutian Islands, and no claim to jurisdiction beyond the three-mile limit appears to have been made. On March 12, 1881, the acting [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], in answer to a letter asking for an interpretation of the words \"waters adjacent thereto\" in the acts of 1868 and 1873, stated that all the waters east of the boundary line were considered to be within the waters of Alaska territory. In March 1886 this letter was communicated to the [[San Francisco]] [[customs]] by [[Daniel Manning]], U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, for publication.\n\nBeginning in about 1886, it became the practice of certain Canadian vessels to intercept passing seals in the open ocean (over three miles from any shore) and shoot them in the water (pelagic sealing), often killing both male and female.<ref name=nie/> The great drawback of pelagic sealing lies in the fact that nursing seal mothers wander far in search of food, while the males do not take food during the breeding season, but remain on the islands. Consequently, practically all the seals taken by pelagic sealers are nursing females, the death of which ordinarily results in the starvation of the pups.<ref>{{Cite NIE |last=Clark |first=Hubert Lyman |authorlink=Hubert Lyman Clark |wstitle=Seal (mammal)|display=Seal. A carnivorous aquatic mammal of the suborder Pinnipedia }}</ref> As a result of this practice, the real possibility of the destruction of the seal fisheries became apparent, together with industries valuable to both the United States and Great Britain.<ref name=nie/>\n\n==British involvement and escalation==\nIn the summer of 1886, three British Columbian sealers, ''Carolena'', ''Onward'', and ''Thornton'', were captured by an American revenue cutter, [[USRC Thomas Corwin (1876)|''Corwin'']],<ref>[http://www.nosracines.ca/e/page.aspx?id=3724963 ''British Columbia: From the Earliest Times to the Present, Vol .2, Chapter XXVII \"The Sealing Industry and the Behring Sea Arbitration\"''] E.O.S. Scholefield and F.W. Howay, S.J. Clarke Publ. Co, Vancouver, 1914, p. 461.</ref> 60 miles from land. They were condemned by the district judge because they had been sealing within the limits of Alaska territory and owed  [[Prima facie|a pro tanto obligation]] to respect the sovereign laws of the [[Territory of Alaska]]. Diplomatic representations followed and an order for release was issued but, in 1887, further captures were made which were judicially supported on the same grounds. From that point the United States claimed exclusive jurisdiction over the sealing industry in the Bering Sea; it also contended that the protection of the [[fur seal]] was an international duty, and should be secured by international arrangement. The British imperial government (then still in charge of foreign affairs for the Dominion of Canada) repudiated the claim, but was willing to negotiate on the question of international regulation.\n\n==Negotiations==\nBetween 1887 and 1890, negotiations were carried out among Russia, Great Britain and the United States with a view to a joint convention but the parties were unable to agree on basis for regulating sealing in the open seas, the [[pelagic zone]]. America had seal nurseries on the Pribilof Islands and Russia on the Komandorski group. Neither Britain, nor the Dominion of [[Canada]], had land access to the Bering Sea or seal breeding grounds. Thus, to prohibit pelagic sealing would have been to exclude Britain from the industry.\n\nThe United States insisted that such prohibition was indispensable on the grounds that pelagic sealing involved the destruction of breeding stock, because it was practically impossible to distinguish between the male and female seal when in the water; and that it was unnecessarily wasteful, inasmuch as a large proportion of the seals so killed were lost. Britain contended that in all known cases the extermination of seals had been the result of operations upon land, and had never been caused exclusively by sealing in the pelagic zone.\n\nThe negotiations came to nothing, and the United States fell back upon their claim of right. In June 1890, it was reported that certain American revenue cutters had been ordered to proceed to the Bering Sea. Sir [[Julian Pauncefote]], the British ambassador at [[Washington, DC|Washington]], having failed to obtain an assurance that British vessels would not be interfered with, laid a formal protest before the United States government.\n\n==Arbitration==\nThere followed a diplomatic controversy, in the course of which the United States developed the contentions which were afterwards laid before the tribunal of arbitration. The claim that Bering Sea was ''[[mare clausum]]'' was abandoned, but it was asserted that Russia had formerly exercised therein rights of exclusive jurisdiction which had passed to the United States, and they relied ''[[inter alia]]'' upon the [[ukase]] of 1821, by which foreign vessels had been forbidden to approach within 100 Italian miles of the coasts of Russian America. It was pointed out by Great Britain that this ukase had been the subject of protest both by Great Britain and the United States, and that by treaties similar in their terms, made between Russia and each of the protesting powers, Russia had agreed that their subjects should not be troubled or molested in navigating or fishing in any part of the Pacific Ocean. The American answer was that the [[Pacific Ocean]] did not include the Bering Sea. They also claimed an interest in the fur seals, involving the right to protect them outside the three-mile limit. In August 1890 [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] proposed that the question at issue should be submitted to arbitration. This was ultimately assented to by the secretary of state, [[James Gillespie Blaine]], on the understanding that certain specific\npoints, which he indicated, should be laid before the arbitrators.\n\nOn February 29, 1892, a definitive treaty was signed at Washington, D.C. Each power was to name two arbitrators, and the president of the [[France|French]] Republic, the king of [[Italy]], the king of [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] were each to name one.\n\n===Terms of reference and arbitrators===\nThe points submitted were\n#What exclusive jurisdiction in the sea now known as Bering Sea, and what exclusive rights in the seal fisheries therein, did Russia assert and exercise prior to and up to the time of the cession of Alaska to the United States? \n#How far were her claims of jurisdiction as to the seal fisheries recognized and conceded by Great Britain? \n#Was the body of water now known as Bering Sea included in the phrase \"Pacific Ocean\", as used in the treaty of 1825 between Great Britain and Russia, and what rights, if any, in Bering Sea were held exclusively exercised by Russia after the said treaty? \n#Did not all the rights of Russia as to jurisdiction and as to the seal fisheries in Bering Sea east of the water boundary, in the treaty between the United States and Russia of the 30th of  March 1867, pass unimpaired to the United States under that treaty? \n#Had the United States any and what right of protection over, or property in, the fur seals frequenting the islands of Bering Sea when such seals are found outside the three-mile limit?\n\nIn the event of a determination in favour of Great Britain the arbitrators were to determine what concurrent regulations were necessary for the preservation of the seals, and a joint commission was to be appointed by the two powers to assist them in the investigation of the facts of seal life. The question of damages was reserved for further discussion, but either party was to be at liberty to submit any question of fact to the arbitrators, and to ask for a finding thereon. The tribunal was to sit at [[Paris]]. The treaty was approved by the [[United States Senate]] on the March 29, 1892, and ratified by the president on April 22.\n\nThe United States appointed as arbitrator Mr. [[John Marshall Harlan|John M. Harlan]], a justice of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], and Mr [[John T. Morgan]], a member of the Senate. The British arbitrators were [[Lord Hannen]] and [[Sir John Sparrow David Thompson]]. The neutral arbitrators were the Baron de Courcel, the [[Emilio, marquis Visconti-Venosta|Marquis Visconti-Venosta]], and Mr. [[Gregers Winther Wulfsberg Gram]], appointed respectively by the president of the French Republic, the king of Italy, and the king of Norway and Sweden. The sittings of the tribunal began in February 1893 and ended in August.  [[Henry Williams Blodgett]] acted as U.S. counsel before the tribunal.\n\n===Main arguments===\nWhen the evidence was before the tribunal, it was plain that the United States had a very weak case with regard to the claim of exclusive jurisdiction in the Bering Sea (the first claim), and it was not strongly pressed by the counsel of the United States.<ref name=nie>{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Sealing}}</ref> The real question, therefore, and the one upon which the chief argument was directed, was the second of the two claims put forward on behalf of the United States, the right of property in the seals and the right of protecting them beyond the three-mile limit.\n\nIt was suggested that the seals had some of the characteristics of the domestic animals, and could therefore be the subject of something in the nature of a right of property. They were so far amenable to human control that it was possible to take their increase without destroying the stock. Sealing upon land was legitimate sealing; the United States being the owners of the land, the industry was a trust vested in them for the benefit of mankind. On the other hand, pelagic sealing, being a method of promiscuous slaughter, was illegitimate; it was ''contra bonos mores'' and analogous to piracy. Consequently, the United States claimed a right to restrain such practices, both as proprietors of the seals and as proprietors and trustees of the legitimate industry.\n\nSuch a right to restrain was a novelty hitherto unrecognized by any system of law. [[James C. Carter]], therefore, as counsel for the United States, submitted a theory of international jurisprudence which was equally novel. He argued that the determination of the tribunal must be grounded upon \"the principles of right,\" that \"by the rule or principle of right was meant a moral rule dictated by the general standard of justice upon which civilized nations are agreed, that this international standard of justice is but another name for international law, that the particular recognized rules were but cases of the application of a more general rule, and that where the particular rules were silent the general rule applied.\" The practical result of giving effect to this contention would be that an international tribunal could make new law and apply it retrospectively. Carter's contention was successfully combated by [[Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen|Charles Russell]], the leading counsel for Great Britain.\n\n===Conclusion===\nThe award, which was signed and published on 15 August 1893, was in favour of Great Britain on all points. The question of damages, which had been reserved, was ultimately settled by a mixed commission appointed by the two powers in February 1896, the total amount awarded to the British sealers being $473,151.26 - in excess of US$10 million in present-day inflation-adjusted dollars.\n\nSince the decision was in favor of Great Britain, in accordance with the arbitration treaty the tribunal prescribed a series of regulations for preserving the seal herds which were to be binding upon and enforced by both powers. They limited pelagic sealing as to time, place, and manner by fixing a zone of 60 miles around the Pribilof Islands within which the seals were not to be molested at any time, and from May 1 to July 31 each year they were not to be pursued anywhere in Bering Sea. Only licensed sailing vessels were permitted to engage in fur sealing, and the use of firearms or explosives was prohibited. The regulations were to remain in force until abolished by mutual agreement, but were to be examined every five years with a view to modification.<ref name=nie/>\n\nThese regulations, however, failed of their object, because the mother seals did not feed within the protected area, but far outside of it. The mother seals were therefore taken by the pelagic sealers as before, and their young were left to starve.

The United States Revenue Cutter Service, today known as the [[United States Coast Guard]], captured several Canadian sealer vessels throughout the conflict. Diplomatic representations followed the capture of the first three ships and an order for release was issued by the British imperial government (then still in charge of foreign affairs for the Dominion of Canada), but it did nothing to stop the seizures and none were released. This led to the U.S. claiming exclusive jurisdiction over the sealing industry in the [[Bering Sea]], and that led to negotiations outside of the courts. The award was given in favor of the British, however, and the Americans were denied exclusive jurisdiction. The British were awarded compensation for the damage that had been inflicted on their vessels, and the American sealing zone remained as it was prior to the conflict (60 miles).\n\n==Origins==\nIn 1867 the United States government purchased from [[Russia]] all her territorial rights in [[Alaska]] and the adjacent islands. The boundary between the two countries was a line drawn from the middle of the [[Bering Strait]] south-west to a point midway between the [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutian]] and [[Komandorski Islands]] dividing the Bering Sea into two parts, the larger being on the American side. This portion included the [[Pribilof Islands]], the principal breeding-grounds of the seals in those seas.\n\nBy [[Acts of Congress]], passed between 1868 and 1873, the killing of seals was prohibited on the Pribilof Islands and in \"the waters adjacent thereto\" except upon certain specified conditions. This created a large swathe of friction between the executive and legislative branches of the US government with the [[presidential veto]] employed by [[Ulysses S. Grant]] on two notable occasions.   No definition of the meaning of the words \"waters adjacent\" was given in the act. In 1870 the exclusive rights of killing seals on these islands was leased by the United States to the [[Alaska Commercial Company]], on conditions limiting the numbers to be taken annually, and otherwise providing for their protection. As early as 1872, the operations of foreign sealers attracted the attention of the United States' government, but any precautions then taken seem to have been directed against the capture of seals on their way through the passages between the Aleutian Islands, and no claim to jurisdiction beyond the three-mile limit appears to have been made. On March 12, 1881, the acting [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], in answer to a letter asking for an interpretation of the words \"waters adjacent thereto\" in the acts of 1868 and 1873, stated that all the waters east of the boundary line were considered to be within the waters of Alaska territory. In March 1886 this letter was communicated to the [[San Francisco]] [[customs]] by [[Daniel Manning]], U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, for publication.\n\nBeginning in about 1886, it became the practice of certain Canadian vessels to intercept passing seals in the open ocean (over three miles from any shore) and shoot them in the water (pelagic sealing), often killing both male and female.<ref name=nie/> The great drawback of pelagic sealing lies in the fact that nursing seal mothers wander far in search of food, while the males do not take food during the breeding season, but remain on the islands. Consequently, practically all the seals taken by pelagic sealers are nursing females, the death of which ordinarily results in the starvation of the pups.<ref>{{Cite NIE |last=Clark |first=Hubert Lyman |authorlink=Hubert Lyman Clark |wstitle=Seal (mammal)|display=Seal. A carnivorous aquatic mammal of the suborder Pinnipedia }}</ref> As a result of this practice, the real possibility of the destruction of the seal fisheries became apparent, together with industries valuable to both the United States and Great Britain.<ref name=nie/>\n\n==British involvement and escalation==\nIn the summer of 1886, three British Columbian sealers, ''Carolena'', ''Onward'', and ''Thornton'', were captured by an American revenue cutter, [[USRC Thomas Corwin (1876)|''Corwin'']],<ref>[http://www.nosracines.ca/e/page.aspx?id=3724963 ''British Columbia: From the Earliest Times to the Present, Vol .2, Chapter XXVII \"The Sealing Industry and the Behring Sea Arbitration\"''] E.O.S.

They were condemned by the district judge because they had been sealing within the limits of Alaska territory and owed  [[Prima facie|a pro tanto obligation]] to respect the sovereign laws of the [[Territory of Alaska]]. Diplomatic representations followed and an order for release was issued but, in 1887, further captures were made which were judicially supported on the same grounds. From that point the United States claimed exclusive jurisdiction over the sealing industry in the [[Bering Sea]]; it also contended that the protection of the [[fur seal]] was an international duty, and should be secured by international arrangement. The British imperial government (then still in charge of foreign affairs for the Dominion of Canada) repudiated the claim, but was willing to negotiate on the question of international regulation.\n\n==Negotiations==\nBetween 1887 and 1890, negotiations were carried out among Russia, Great Britain and the United States with a view to a joint convention but the parties were unable to agree on basis for regulating sealing in the open seas, the [[pelagic zone]].

{"title_page": "Annexation movements of Canada", "text_new": "{{short description|Campaigns in favor of American annexation of Canada}}\nFrom the independence of the United States until today, various movements within Canada have campaigned in favour of U.S. [[annexation]] of parts or all of Canada. Historical studies have focused on numerous small-scale movements which are helpful in comparisons of Canadian and American politics.\n\nIn the early years of the United States, many American political figures were in favour of invading and annexing Canada, and even pre-approved Canada's admission to the U.S. in the [[Articles of Confederation]] in 1777. The defeat of American attempts to achieve this goal, both in the [[American Revolution]] and the [[War of 1812]], gradually led to the abandonment in the U.S. of any serious push toward annexation. As historian Joseph Levitt notes:\n:Since the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]] in 1871, when it first ''de facto'' recognized the new Dominion of Canada, the United States has never suggested or promoted an annexationist movement in Canada. No serious force has appeared on the American political scene that aimed to persuade or coerce Canadians into joining the United States. And, in fact, no serious initiative for any move in this direction has come from the Canadian side either.<ref>Neuhold and Von Riekhoff, p. 94</ref>\n\nSurveys have suggested that a minority of Canadians would potentially support annexation, ranging from as many as 20 percent in a survey by [[L\u00e9ger Marketing]] in 2001<ref>[http://www.legermarketing.com/documents/SPCLM/010910ENG.pdf Leger Marketing survey, 2001.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020114114/http://www.legermarketing.com/documents/SPCLM/010910ENG.pdf |date=October 20, 2006 }}</ref> to as few as seven percent in another survey by the same company in 2004.<ref>[http://www.annexation.ca/reports/2004%20Leger%20Marketing%20-%20Canada%20US%20Relations.pdf Leger Marketing survey, 2004.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219091052/http://www.annexation.ca/reports/2004%20Leger%20Marketing%20-%20Canada%20US%20Relations.pdf |date=2012-02-19 }}</ref>\n\nNo elected member of any federal or provincial assembly in Canada, nor any mainstream politician in the United States, openly advocates annexation. Two minor provincial political parties in Canada promoted the concept in the 1980s, but neither attracted widespread support or attention.\n\n==Historical annexationist groups==\n\n===1837===\nHistorical annexationist movements inside Canada were usually inspired by dissatisfaction with Britain's colonial government of Canada. Groups of Irish immigrants took the route of armed struggle, attempting to annex the peninsula between the [[Detroit River|Detroit]] and [[Niagara River]]s to the U.S. by force in the minor and short-lived [[Patriot War]] in 1837\u20131838.\n\nAlthough the [[Rebellions of 1837]] were motivated in part by this type of dissatisfaction, Canadian resentment of British rule never reached the degree that led to the [[American Revolution]] in 1775. Notably, Canada's population growth in the late 18th and early 19th centuries was spurred largely by [[United Empire Loyalist]]s, who left the American colonies during the Revolution because of their loyalty to Great Britain. In the period from 1790 to 1837, imperial officials repeatedly denounced American-style republicanism and tried to suppress it. The Rebellions themselves were not fought with the goal of annexation, however, but were launched in pursuit of political independence from Britain and [[Liberalism|liberal]] social reforms.\n\nBetween 1848 and 1854, a significant and articulate minority of conservatives in [[Upper Canada]] advocated constitutional changes modelled on the American federal-state system and the [[Constitution of the United States|US Constitution]]. They critiqued Canada's imitation of [[Westminster system|British parliamentary government]] as both too democratic and too tyrannical. It destroyed the independence of the appointed governor and Legislative Council and further concentrated power in the Cabinet. This critique led many conservatives to argue that the American model of [[checks and balances]] offered Canada a more balanced and conservative form of democracy than did British parliamentary government. These \"republican conservatives\" debated a series of constitutional changes, including annexation to the United States, an elected governor, an elected Legislative Council, a federal union of [[British North America]], and imperial [[federation]], within this framework. These conservatives had accepted \"government by discussion\" as the appropriate basis for political order.<ref>McNairn, Jeffrey L. \"Publius of the North: Tory Republicanism and the American Constitution in Upper Canada, 1848-54.\" Canadian Historical Review 1996 77(4): 504-537. ISSN 0008-3755.</ref>\n\n===1850s===\nAround 1850 there was a serious annexationist movement on the border region of Quebec's [[Eastern Townships]], where the American-descended majority felt that union with the United States would end their economic isolation and stagnation as well as remove them from the growing threat of [[French Canadian]] political domination. Leading proponents of this genuinely bipartisan movement were careful not to appear disloyal to Britain, however, and they actively discouraged popular protest at the local level. Fearful of American-style democracy, the local elite also expressed revulsion toward American [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and militaristic expansionism. Consequently, the movement died as quickly in the Eastern Townships as it did in Montreal after Britain expressed its official disapproval and trade with the United States began to increase.<ref>Little, 1992</ref>\n\nIn Montreal at midcentury, with little immigration and complaints that the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] had cut the region off from its British trade links, a small but organized group supported integrating the colonies into the United States. The leading organization advocating merger was the [[Annexation Association]], founded in 1849 by an alliance of French Canadian nationalists and Anglophone businessmen in [[Montreal]] who had a common interest in the republic. Many of its members, including [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]], were participants in the 1837-38 rebellions.\n\nThe [[Montreal Annexation Manifesto]] was published in 1849. It was hoped a merger with the United States would give Canada markets for its goods, ensure national security, and provide the finances to develop the west. A half measure was the in 1854 [[Canadian\u2013American Reciprocity Treaty]] that linked the two areas economically.\n\nHowever, the movement died out in 1854. Annexation was never a very popular choice. Many Canadians were loyal to the Crown and Great Britain, especially the descendants of the [[United Empire Loyalist]]s.  French Canadians worried about being an even smaller minority in a larger union, and were concerned about American [[Anti-Catholicism in the United States|anti-Catholicism]].  The [[American Civil War]], further, convinced many Canadians that the American experiment was a failure.\n\n===1860s===\n\n====British Columbia====\n{{see also|History of British Columbia#Annexation debate}}\n\n[[United States Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] predicted in 1860 that western British North America, from Manitoba to British Columbia, would with [[Russian Alaska]] join the United States. Many in Britain, such as [[Goldwin Smith]] and ''[[The Times]]'' of London, were pessimistic about the future of British North America and agreed with Seward; ''The Times'' said that Britain would only object if the United States attempted to take the territory by force.<ref name=\"jstor3637972\">{{cite journal | last1 = Shi | first1 = David E. | last2 =  | first2 =  | year = 1978 | title = Seward's Attempt to Annex British Columbia, 1865-1869 | journal = Pacific Historical Review | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 217\u2013238 | publisher =  | doi= 10.2307/3637972 | jstor = 3637972 }}</ref> In the late 1860s, residents of [[British Columbia]], which was not yet a Canadian province, responded to the [[Alaska Purchase|United States' purchase of Alaska]] with fear of being surrounded by American territory. Some residents wanted the colony to be the next American purchase. Local opinion was divided, as the three [[Vancouver Island]] newspapers supported annexation to the United States, while the three mainland newspapers rejected the idea. Even opponents of the annexation scheme admitted that Great Britain had neglected the region and that grievances were justified. Nonetheless, annexation sentiment disappeared within a few months and prominent leaders moved toward confederation with Canada.<ref name=\"jstor40491056\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/40491056 | last1 = Neunherz | first1 = R.

The first, in 1867, was addressed to [[Queen Victoria]], demanding that the British government assume the colony's debts and establish a steamer link, or allow the colony to join the U.S. In 1869, a second petition was addressed to President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], asking him to negotiate American annexation of the territory from Britain. It was delivered to Grant by [[Vincent Colyer]], [[Indian Commissioner]] for Alaska, on December 29, 1869. Both petitions were signed by only a small fraction of the colony's population, and British Columbia was ultimately admitted as a Canadian province in 1871.\n\n====Nova Scotia====\nMost Canadians were strongly opposed to the prospect of American annexation. Reports of the [[Annexation Bill of 1866]] \u2014 a bill that, contrary to myth, never came to a vote \u2014 might have been one of the many factors behind [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867.  Much more serious were the [[Fenian raids]] made by [[Irish Americans]] across the border in 1866, which spurred a wave of patriotic feeling that helped the cause of Confederation.<ref>Donald Creighton, ''John A. Macdonald: The Young Politician'' 1952 pp 438-43</ref>\n\nNonetheless, a substantial annexation movement existed in Nova Scotia, and to a lesser degree in New Brunswick, Quebec, and Ontario, during the 1860s. Nova Scotia [[Anti-Confederation Party#Nova Scotia|anti-confederationists]] led by [[Joseph Howe]] felt that pro-confederation premier [[Charles Tupper]] had caused the province to agree to join Canada without popular support. Howe in London unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the government to free Nova Scotia from the pending British North America Act by threatening American annexation. A significant economic downturn occurred after the end after 1866 of the [[Reciprocity Treaty of 1854]]; the colony was heavily dependent on selling fish to Americans, causing many to believe that free trade with the United States was necessary for prosperity. Anti-confederationists won all but two seats in the [[24th General Assembly of Nova Scotia|1867 provincial election]]; as in British Columbia they did not necessarily support annexation. They again sent Howe to London to free Nova Scotia but in 1868 the British government again refused, believing that New Brunswick would likely follow Nova Scotia out of the dominion and cause the new nation to collapse.{{r|warner1960}}\n\nAngry Nova Scotians began talking seriously of annexation. An alarmed Howe&mdash;who wished Nova Scotia to be free of Canada but still with Britain&mdash;warned his supporters against disloyalty, dividing anti-confederationists. The provincial government, dominated by extremists who now also opposed Howe, decided that if another appeal to London failed it would seize federal offices and unilaterally declare annexation, believing that Britain would not use force to stop Nova Scotia. Believing he had no choice, Howe left the anti-confederationists. Although he narrowly won reelection to his federal parliamentary seat in March 1869 as a confederationist, support for secession and annexation grew that year; however, by 1871 the movement had mostly disappeared. The federal government promised changes to taxes and tariffs, the economy revived, and the United States agreed to free trade for Canadian fish.<ref name=\"warner1960\">{{cite book | url=https://www.questia.com/read/99340202/the-idea-of-continental-union-agitation-for-the-annexation | title=The Idea of Continental Union: Agitation for the Annexation of Canada to the United States, 1849-1893 | publisher=University of Kentucky Press | author=Warner, Donald F. | year=1960 | pages=54\u201357, 67\u201393}}</ref>\n\n===1880s===\nCanadian author Prosper Bender wrote in the ''[[North American Review]]'' in 1883 that many Canadians believed that annexation by the United States would occur \"within the present generation, if not sooner\". He believed that [[Irish Canadians|Irish]] Catholics&mdash;about one quarter of Canada's population&mdash;would prefer annexation because of the British rule of Ireland. They would be joined by the majority of those under 40, who viewed the United States as a prosperous, fast-growing neighbour providing many opportunities. (The author attributed the absence of an active annexation movement in part to many who would favor such an effort taking the \"easiest and quietest method of securing the benefits of annexation, by themselves silently migrating to the Republic\", as more than a million already had.)<ref name=\"jstor25118257\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bender | first1 = P. | last2 =  | first2 =  | year = 1883 | title = A Canadian View of Annexation | journal = The North American Review | volume = 136 | issue = 317 | pages = 326\u2013336 | publisher =  | jstor = 25118257 }}</ref>\n\nBender believed that Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald]]'s promise of a [[Canadian Pacific Railway|transcontinental railway]] linking eastern Canada to British Columbia to be overambitious and too expensive, and unfavourably compared the Canadian government's growing debt to the United States' rapid reduction of its [[American Civil War|Civil War]] debt. He stated that Canadian businesses would benefit from duty-free access to the American market, while \"wondrous American enterprise, supported by illimitable capital\" would rapidly prosper Canada, especially its vast undeveloped interior. Bender concluded with pessimism about the likelihood of success of a nation divided in two parts by 1,200 miles of \"forbidding, silent wilderness stretching from the head-waters of the [[Ottawa River|Ottawa]] to [[Thunder Bay]], and thence to [[Manitoba]]\".{{r|jstor25118257}}\n\n===1890s===\nIn 1891, Goldwin Smith posited in his book ''[[Canada and the Canadian Question]]'' that Canada's eventual annexation by the United States was inevitable, and should be welcomed if Canadians genuinely believed in the ideal of [[democracy]]. His view did not receive widespread support.<ref>Kelly, St\u00e9phane. [https://www.thestar.com/comment/article/164488 \"The Republic of Northern America\"] ''[[Toronto Star]]''; Opinion (Canada 2020).  26 December 2006.</ref>\n\nIn January 1893, concerned about Canada's possible annexation, a goal then being pursued by the Continental Union Association, a group of [[Ontario Liberal Party|Ontario]] and [[Quebec Liberal Party|Quebec Liberals]], Prime Minister [[John Sparrow David Thompson|Sir John Thompson]] delivered a speech on tolerance, [[Canadian nationalism]] and continued loyalty to Britain. Thompson eventually learned that the desire to make Canada part of the U.S. was confined to a small minority amongst the Liberals.\n\n===1900s===\nIn 1901 [[W. T. Stead]], a newspaper editor in London, England,  discussed in ''The Americanization of the World'' possible annexations of Canada and [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]]. He believed that because of its size and strength Canada would likely be the last of Britain's possessions in the Americas to join the United States. Stead cited several reasons for why he believed annexation seemed \"inevitable\", however, including rapidly growing economic ties and migration between the two countries, the [[French Shore]], and [[Alaska boundary dispute|disputes over the Alaska boundary]] and fishing rights in the Atlantic.<ref name=\"stead1901\">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/americanizationo01stea#page/83/mode/2up | title=The Americanization of the World | publisher=Horace Markley | author=Stead, W.

The US offered to lease the territory but not to give it back. London and Washington agreed on arbitration, with one member of the panel from Canada. In 1903 the Chief Justice of Britain sided with the Americans to resolve the map dispute in favour of the United States.  Many Canadians felt a sense of betrayal on the part of the British government, whose own national interest required close ties to the United States, regardless of the interests of Canada.<ref>F. W. Gibson, \"The Alaskan Boundary Dispute,\" ''Canadian Historical Association Report'' (1945) pp 25\u201340 at note 57</ref>\n\nThe 1932 establishment of the [[International Peace Garden]] on the North Dakota\u2013Manitoba border honored the long lasting friendship between the two countries rather than attempts at annexation.\n\n===Newfoundland in the mid-twentieth century===\nWhile the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] was still separate from Canada, during World War II, a party known as the [[Economic Union Party]] sought closer ties with the United States. However, Canada objected to the possibility, and the British government, which controlled Newfoundland as a colony, would not allow it to consider annexation with the United States in any referendum. Instead, the EUP sought an independent \"[[responsible government]]\" that would then explore American annexation.<ref>Karl McNeil Earle, \"Cousins of a Kind: The Newfoundland and Labrador Relationship with the United States\" ''American Review of Canadian Studies,'' Vol. 28, 1998</ref> A referendum showed a plurality in support of independence, but not a majority; a runoff referendum resulted in Newfoundland instead confederating with Canada to become the [[Newfoundland and Labrador|tenth province]].\n\n==Modern annexationist groups==\nTwo modern provincial political parties have proposed that their province [[secessionist movements of Canada|secede from Canada]] to join the United States. Neither attracted significant support.\n\nThe [[Unionest Party]] was a provincial political party in [[Saskatchewan]] in 1980 that promoted the union of the western provinces with the United States. It was the most politically successful annexationist group, but its success was both short-lived and extremely limited in scope. The party briefly had two members in the [[Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan]], both of whom [[crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] from another party, but dissolved within a few weeks after failing to qualify for [[official party status]].<ref>Stephen LaRose, \"It's All About the Crude\".

The party won just 3,846 votes, or 0.11 per cent of the popular vote in the province, in the [[1989 Quebec general election|1989 election]] \u2014 fewer votes than the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist Party of Quebec|Marxist\u2013Leninists]] or the satirical [[Lemon Party]] \u2014 and was dissolved the following year.<ref>Jean Cr\u00eate, \"La vie des partis\".

Historical studies have focused on numerous small-scale movements which are helpful in comparisons of Canadian and American politics.\n\nIn the early years of the United States, many American political figures were in favour of invading and annexing Canada, and even pre-approved Canada's admission to the U.S. in the [[Articles of Confederation]] in 1777. The defeat of American attempts to achieve this goal, both in the [[American Revolution]] and the [[War of 1812]], gradually led to the abandonment in the U.S. of any serious push toward annexation. As historian Joseph Levitt notes:\n:Since the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]] in 1871, when it first ''de facto'' recognized the new Dominion of Canada, the United States has never suggested or promoted an annexationist movement in Canada. No serious force has appeared on the American political scene that aimed to persuade or coerce Canadians into joining the United States. And, in fact, no serious initiative for any move in this direction has come from the Canadian side either.<ref>Neuhold and Von Riekhoff, p. 94</ref>\n\nSurveys have suggested that a minority of Canadians would potentially support annexation, ranging from as many as 20 percent in a survey by [[L\u00e9ger Marketing]] in 2001<ref>[http://www.legermarketing.com/documents/SPCLM/010910ENG.pdf Leger Marketing survey, 2001.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020114114/http://www.legermarketing.com/documents/SPCLM/010910ENG.pdf |date=October 20, 2006 }}</ref> to as few as seven percent in another survey by the same company in 2004.<ref>[http://www.annexation.ca/reports/2004%20Leger%20Marketing%20-%20Canada%20US%20Relations.pdf Leger Marketing survey, 2004.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219091052/http://www.annexation.ca/reports/2004%20Leger%20Marketing%20-%20Canada%20US%20Relations.pdf |date=2012-02-19 }}</ref>\n\nNo elected member of any federal or provincial assembly in Canada, nor any mainstream politician in the United States, openly advocates annexation. Two minor provincial political parties in Canada promoted the concept in the 1980s, but neither attracted widespread support or attention.\n\n==Historical annexationist groups==\n\n===1837===\nHistorical annexationist movements inside Canada were usually inspired by dissatisfaction with Britain's colonial government of Canada. Groups of Irish immigrants took the route of armed struggle, attempting to annex the peninsula between the [[Detroit River|Detroit]] and [[Niagara River]]s to the U.S. by force in the minor and short-lived [[Patriot War]] in 1837\u20131838.\n\nAlthough the [[Rebellions of 1837]] were motivated in part by this type of dissatisfaction, Canadian resentment of British rule never reached the degree that led to the [[American Revolution]] in 1775. Notably, Canada's population growth in the late 18th and early 19th centuries was spurred largely by [[United Empire Loyalist]]s, who left the American colonies during the Revolution because of their loyalty to Great Britain. In the period from 1790 to 1837, imperial officials repeatedly denounced American-style republicanism and tried to suppress it. The Rebellions themselves were not fought with the goal of annexation, however, but were launched in pursuit of political independence from Britain and [[Liberalism|liberal]] social reforms.\n\nBetween 1848 and 1854, a significant and articulate minority of conservatives in [[Upper Canada]] advocated constitutional changes modelled on the American federal-state system and the [[Constitution of the United States|US Constitution]]. They critiqued Canada's imitation of [[Westminster system|British parliamentary government]] as both too democratic and too tyrannical. It destroyed the independence of the appointed governor and Legislative Council and further concentrated power in the Cabinet. This critique led many conservatives to argue that the American model of [[checks and balances]] offered Canada a more balanced and conservative form of democracy than did British parliamentary government. These \"republican conservatives\" debated a series of constitutional changes, including annexation to the United States, an elected governor, an elected Legislative Council, a federal union of [[British North America]], and imperial [[federation]], within this framework. These conservatives had accepted \"government by discussion\" as the appropriate basis for political order.<ref>McNairn, Jeffrey L. \"Publius of the North: Tory Republicanism and the American Constitution in Upper Canada, 1848-54.\" Canadian Historical Review 1996 77(4): 504-537. ISSN 0008-3755.</ref>\n\n===1850s===\nAround 1850 there was a serious annexationist movement on the border region of Quebec's [[Eastern Townships]], where the American-descended majority felt that union with the United States would end their economic isolation and stagnation as well as remove them from the growing threat of [[French Canadian]] political domination. Leading proponents of this genuinely bipartisan movement were careful not to appear disloyal to Britain, however, and they actively discouraged popular protest at the local level. Fearful of American-style democracy, the local elite also expressed revulsion toward American [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and militaristic expansionism. Consequently, the movement died as quickly in the Eastern Townships as it did in Montreal after Britain expressed its official disapproval and trade with the United States began to increase.<ref>Little, 1992</ref>\n\nIn Montreal at midcentury, with little immigration and complaints that the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] had cut the region off from its British trade links, a small but organized group supported integrating the colonies into the United States. The leading organization advocating merger was the [[Annexation Association]], founded in 1849 by an alliance of French Canadian nationalists and Anglophone businessmen in [[Montreal]] who had a common interest in the republic. Many of its members, including [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]], were participants in the 1837-38 rebellions.\n\nThe [[Montreal Annexation Manifesto]] was published in 1849. It was hoped a merger with the United States would give Canada markets for its goods, ensure national security, and provide the finances to develop the west. A half measure was the in 1854 [[Canadian\u2013American Reciprocity Treaty]] that linked the two areas economically.\n\nHowever, the movement died out in 1854. Annexation was never a very popular choice. Many Canadians were loyal to the Crown and Great Britain, especially the descendants of the [[United Empire Loyalist]]s.  French Canadians worried about being an even smaller minority in a larger union, and were concerned about American [[Anti-Catholicism in the United States|anti-Catholicism]].  The [[American Civil War]], further, convinced many Canadians that the American experiment was a failure.\n\n===1860s===\n\n====British Columbia====\n{{see also|History of British Columbia#Annexation debate}}\n\n[[United States Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] predicted in 1860 that western British North America, from Manitoba to British Columbia, would with [[Russian Alaska]] join the United States. Many in Britain, such as [[Goldwin Smith]] and ''[[The Times]]'' of London, were pessimistic about the future of British North America and agreed with Seward; ''The Times'' said that Britain would only object if the United States attempted to take the territory by force.<ref name=\"jstor3637972\">{{cite journal | last1 = Shi | first1 = David E. | last2 =  | first2 =  | year = 1978 | title = Seward's Attempt to Annex British Columbia, 1865-1869 | journal = Pacific Historical Review | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 217\u2013238 | publisher =  | doi= 10.2307/3637972 | jstor = 3637972 }}</ref> In the late 1860s, residents of [[British Columbia]], which was not yet a Canadian province, responded to the [[Alaska Purchase|United States' purchase of Alaska]] with fear of being surrounded by American territory. Some residents wanted the colony to be the next American purchase. Local opinion was divided, as the three [[Vancouver Island]] newspapers supported annexation to the United States, while the three mainland newspapers rejected the idea. Even opponents of the annexation scheme admitted that Great Britain had neglected the region and that grievances were justified. Nonetheless, annexation sentiment disappeared within a few months and prominent leaders moved toward confederation with Canada.<ref name=\"jstor40491056\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/40491056 | last1 = Neunherz | first1 = R.

The first, in 1867, was addressed to [[Queen Victoria]], demanding that the British government assume the colony's debts and establish a steamer link, or allow the colony to join the U.S. In 1869, a second petition was addressed to President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], asking him to negotiate American annexation of the territory from Britain. It was delivered to Grant by [[Vincent Colyer]], [[Indian Commissioner]] for Alaska, on December 29, 1869. Both petitions were signed by only a small fraction of the colony's population, and British Columbia was ultimately admitted as a Canadian province in 1871.\n\n====Nova Scotia====\nMost Canadians were strongly opposed to the prospect of American annexation. Reports of the [[Annexation Bill of 1866]] \u2014 a bill that, contrary to myth, never came to a vote \u2014 might have been one of the many factors behind [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867.  Much more serious were the [[Fenian raids]] made by [[Irish Americans]] across the border in 1866, which spurred a wave of patriotic feeling that helped the cause of Confederation.<ref>Donald Creighton, ''John A. Macdonald: The Young Politician'' 1952 pp 438-43</ref>\n\nNonetheless, a substantial annexation movement existed in Nova Scotia, and to a lesser degree in New Brunswick, Quebec, and Ontario, during the 1860s. Nova Scotia [[Anti-Confederation Party#Nova Scotia|anti-confederationists]] led by [[Joseph Howe]] felt that pro-confederation premier [[Charles Tupper]] had caused the province to agree to join Canada without popular support. Howe in London unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the government to free Nova Scotia from the pending British North America Act by threatening American annexation. A significant economic downturn occurred after the end after 1866 of the [[Reciprocity Treaty of 1854]]; the colony was heavily dependent on selling fish to Americans, causing many to believe that free trade with the United States was necessary for prosperity. Anti-confederationists won all but two seats in the [[24th General Assembly of Nova Scotia|1867 provincial election]]; as in British Columbia they did not necessarily support annexation. They again sent Howe to London to free Nova Scotia but in 1868 the British government again refused, believing that New Brunswick would likely follow Nova Scotia out of the dominion and cause the new nation to collapse.{{r|warner1960}}\n\nAngry Nova Scotians began talking seriously of annexation. An alarmed Howe&mdash;who wished Nova Scotia to be free of Canada but still with Britain&mdash;warned his supporters against disloyalty, dividing anti-confederationists. The provincial government, dominated by extremists who now also opposed Howe, decided that if another appeal to London failed it would seize federal offices and unilaterally declare annexation, believing that Britain would not use force to stop Nova Scotia. Believing he had no choice, Howe left the anti-confederationists. Although he narrowly won reelection to his federal parliamentary seat in March 1869 as a confederationist, support for secession and annexation grew that year; however, by 1871 the movement had mostly disappeared. The federal government promised changes to taxes and tariffs, the economy revived, and the United States agreed to free trade for Canadian fish.<ref name=\"warner1960\">{{cite book | url=https://www.questia.com/read/99340202/the-idea-of-continental-union-agitation-for-the-annexation | title=The Idea of Continental Union: Agitation for the Annexation of Canada to the United States, 1849-1893 | publisher=University of Kentucky Press | author=Warner, Donald F. | year=1960 | pages=54\u201357, 67\u201393}}</ref>\n\n===1880s===\nCanadian author Prosper Bender wrote in the ''[[North American Review]]'' in 1883 that many Canadians believed that annexation by the United States would occur \"within the present generation, if not sooner\". He believed that [[Irish Canadians|Irish]] Catholics&mdash;about one quarter of Canada's population&mdash;would prefer annexation because of the British rule of Ireland. They would be joined by the majority of those under 40, who viewed the United States as a prosperous, fast-growing neighbour providing many opportunities. (The author attributed the absence of an active annexation movement in part to many who would favor such an effort taking the \"easiest and quietest method of securing the benefits of annexation, by themselves silently migrating to the Republic\", as more than a million already had.)<ref name=\"jstor25118257\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bender | first1 = P. | last2 =  | first2 =  | year = 1883 | title = A Canadian View of Annexation | journal = The North American Review | volume = 136 | issue = 317 | pages = 326\u2013336 | publisher =  | jstor = 25118257 }}</ref>\n\nBender believed that Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald]]'s promise of a [[Canadian Pacific Railway|transcontinental railway]] linking eastern Canada to British Columbia to be overambitious and too expensive, and unfavourably compared the Canadian government's growing debt to the United States' rapid reduction of its [[American Civil War|Civil War]] debt. He stated that Canadian businesses would benefit from duty-free access to the American market, while \"wondrous American enterprise, supported by illimitable capital\" would rapidly prosper Canada, especially its vast undeveloped interior. Bender concluded with pessimism about the likelihood of success of a nation divided in two parts by 1,200 miles of \"forbidding, silent wilderness stretching from the head-waters of the [[Ottawa River|Ottawa]] to [[Thunder Bay]], and thence to [[Manitoba]]\".{{r|jstor25118257}}\n\n===1890s===\nIn 1891, Goldwin Smith posited in his book ''[[Canada and the Canadian Question]]'' that Canada's eventual annexation by the United States was inevitable, and should be welcomed if Canadians genuinely believed in the ideal of [[democracy]]. His view did not receive widespread support.<ref>Kelly, St\u00e9phane. [https://www.thestar.com/comment/article/164488 \"The Republic of Northern America\"] ''[[Toronto Star]]''; Opinion (Canada 2020).  26 December 2006.</ref>\n\nIn January 1893, concerned about Canada's possible annexation, a goal then being pursued by the Continental Union Association, a group of [[Ontario Liberal Party|Ontario]] and [[Quebec Liberal Party|Quebec Liberals]], Prime Minister [[John Sparrow David Thompson|Sir John Thompson]] delivered a speech on tolerance, [[Canadian nationalism]] and continued loyalty to Britain. Thompson eventually learned that the desire to make Canada part of the U.S. was confined to a small minority amongst the Liberals.\n\n===1900s===\nIn 1901 [[W. T. Stead]], a newspaper editor in London, England,  discussed in ''The Americanization of the World'' possible annexations of Canada and [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]]. He believed that because of its size and strength Canada would likely be the last of Britain's possessions in the Americas to join the United States. Stead cited several reasons for why he believed annexation seemed \"inevitable\", however, including rapidly growing economic ties and migration between the two countries, the [[French Shore]], and [[Alaska boundary dispute|disputes over the Alaska boundary]] and fishing rights in the Atlantic.<ref name=\"stead1901\">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/americanizationo01stea#page/83/mode/2up | title=The Americanization of the World | publisher=Horace Markley | author=Stead, W.

The US offered to lease the territory but not to give it back. London and Washington agreed on arbitration, with one member of the panel from Canada. In 1903 the Chief Justice of Britain sided with the Americans to resolve the map dispute in favour of the United States.  Many Canadians felt a sense of betrayal on the part of the British government, whose own national interest required close ties to the United States, regardless of the interests of Canada.<ref>F. W. Gibson, \"The Alaskan Boundary Dispute,\" ''Canadian Historical Association Report'' (1945) pp 25\u201340 at note 57</ref>\n\nThe 1932 establishment of the [[International Peace Garden]] on the North Dakota\u2013Manitoba border honored the long lasting friendship between the two countries rather than attempts at annexation.\n\n===Newfoundland in the mid-twentieth century===\nWhile the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] was still separate from Canada, during World War II, a party known as the [[Economic Union Party]] sought closer ties with the United States. However, Canada objected to the possibility, and the British government, which controlled Newfoundland as a colony, would not allow it to consider annexation with the United States in any referendum. Instead, the EUP sought an independent \"responsible government\" that would then explore American annexation.<ref>Karl McNeil Earle, \"Cousins of a Kind: The Newfoundland and Labrador Relationship with the United States\" ''American Review of Canadian Studies,'' Vol. 28, 1998</ref> A referendum showed a plurality in support of independence, but not a majority; a runoff referendum resulted in Newfoundland instead confederating with Canada to become the [[Newfoundland and Labrador|tenth province]].\n\n==Modern annexationist groups==\nTwo modern provincial political parties have proposed that their province [[secessionist movements of Canada|secede from Canada]] to join the United States. Neither attracted significant support.\n\nThe [[Unionest Party]] was a provincial political party in [[Saskatchewan]] in 1980 that promoted the union of the western provinces with the United States. It was the most politically successful annexationist group, but its success was both short-lived and extremely limited in scope. The party briefly had two members in the [[Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan]], both of whom [[crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] from another party, but dissolved within a few weeks after failing to qualify for [[official party status]].<ref>Stephen LaRose, \"It's All About the Crude\".

The party won just 3,846 votes, or 0.11 per cent of the popular vote in the province, in the [[1989 Quebec general election|1989 election]] \u2014 fewer votes than the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist Party of Quebec|Marxist\u2013Leninists]] or the satirical [[Lemon Party]] \u2014 and was dissolved the following year.<ref>Jean Cr\u00eate, \"La vie des partis\".

The use of this type of rhetoric may occur even if the proponents of such a course of action have ''not'' endorsed or proposed annexation.\n\nIn the [[1911 Canadian federal election|1911 federal election]], the [[Conservative Party of Canada (1867\u20131942)|Conservative]] response to the proposed reciprocity treaty negotiated by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] was to denounce it as equivalent to an American economic takeover, with annexation likely to follow. The parties swapped position in the later [[1988 Canadian federal election|1988 federal election]], when the Liberals used the same type of rhetoric to denounce the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]]' proposed [[Canada\u2013United States Free Trade Agreement]], although the Progressive Conservatives won that election and the agreement was implemented.\n\nAnnexation fears can be found throughout ''Canadian History for Dummies'', in which humourist [[Will Ferguson]] stated that for \"[[John L.
