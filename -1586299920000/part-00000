It was founded in 1894 as the '''Elkhart Institute of Science, Industry and the Arts''', and is affiliated with [[Mennonite Church USA]]. The college is [[school accreditation|accredited]] by the ]]Higher Learning Commission]]. Goshen has an enrollment of 950 students.<ref name=\"GC Quick Facts\" /> While Goshen maintains a distinctive liberal Mennonite worldview, it admits students of all religions. [[Mennonite]]s make up 43 percent of the student body.<ref name=\"GC Quick Facts\" />\n\nGoshen College is home to ''[[The Mennonite Quarterly Review]]'' and the [[Mennonite Historical Library]], a research library compiling one of the world's most comprehensive collection of [[Anabaptist]] and Mennonite primary source material.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = American Historical Association| title = Mennonite Historical Library| encyclopedia = American Historical Association Archives Wiki| date = 2013-05-17| url = http://archiveswiki.historians.org/index.php/Mennonite_Historical_Library}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe history of Goshen College (or Goshen, as it is commonly known) is intertwined with that of the history of Mennonites in America,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} and so Goshen's history is best told in the context of this broader history.{{according to whom|date=August 2016}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} \"Old\" Mennonites had traditionally been suspicious of higher education, but by the late 19th century, opinion started to change.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Decades earlier, [[mainline Protestant]] church denominations had begun to found colleges across America, with the hope of developing well-trained clergy for their congregations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} As more \"Old\" Mennonites sent their children to other Christian colleges, they realized that, without a college of their own, many of their youth would leave the church.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Thus, prompted in part as a reaction to mainline Christianity, the \"Old\" Mennonites started the Elkhart Institute in [[Elkhart, Indiana]] in August 1894, to prepare Mennonite youth for college.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Today,{{when|date=April 2017}} Goshen is open to everyone, but this earlier vision and its historical relationship with the Mennonite Church remains visible: it is home to ''[[The Mennonite Quarterly Review]]'', [[Mennonite Historical Library]], [[Mennonite Church USA Archives]], including Mennonite Central Committee archives, offices of \"The Mennonite\", and it has numerous alumni connections with the broader Mennonite Church.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nGoshen was the first Mennonite school of higher education in North America to confer a four-year degree.{{according to whom|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}<ref>[[Bethel College (Kansas)|Bethel College]], which was incorporated in 1887 and opened at its present site in 1893, is older, but did not originally grant four-year degrees.{{Original research inline|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}</ref>  H.A. Mumaw, a practicing physician, first led the small operation; in 1894, a group of 15 \"Old\" Mennonite ministers and laymen started a corporation that they named the Elkhart Institute association.<ref>Schlabach, Theron F: ''Peace, Faith, Nation: Mennonites and Amish in Nineteenth Century America'', page 300. Herald Press, 1988</ref>  The first diploma was awarded in 1898.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Lured by businessmen to relocate several miles away to [[Goshen, Indiana]], the Institute moved in September 1903 and added a junior college course list, renaming itself Goshen College.{{when|date=April 2017}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} By 1906, the Mennonite Board of Education had taken control of the college, dissolving the Elkhart Institute Association.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} A complete college course was established in 1908, and the first Bachelor of Arts degrees were conferred in 1910.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} After 1910, most of Goshen's students were enrolled in college courses. From 1914 to 1919, partly out of response to its constituents, Goshen College attempted a \"School of Agriculture,\" which sought to prepare Mennonite young people to return to their rural communities; the hope was that such a program would spark a technological revolution among some of the farmers, but it was never a success and was cut after [[World War I]], five years after it began.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The college-prep academy program of Goshen College was discontinued in 1935.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe school was closed during the 1923\u20131924 school year by the Mennonite Board of Education but reopened the following year. One of many factors in closing the college was denominational tension due to [[Liberal Christianity|modernist]] and [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christian]] theologies of the 1920s and their impact on Mennonite theology at the school.<ref>Juhnke, James C: ''Vision, Doctrine, War: Mennonite Identity and Organization in America 1890\u20131930'', page 128. Herald Press, 1989</ref> In response to this crisis, many of Goshen's faculty and dozens of students, angry with the Mennonite Board of Education's decision, relocated to [[Bluffton University|Bluffton College]]. As part of the larger ongoing reaction against liberalism through the early 20th century, [[Hesston College]] and [[Eastern Mennonite University|Eastern Mennonite School]] were formed among \"Old\" Mennonites, although staunch traditionalists realized that no higher education was particularly safe.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nWhen the institution was reopened, it was marked by the new leadership of president [[Sanford Calvin Yoder|S.C. Yoder]] and dean [[Harold S. Bender|Noah Oyer,]] who manifested outstanding abilities. His character was one marked by simplicity, modesty, and refinement, as well as unusual wisdom and insight. Under his leadership the educational program of the College developed rapidly, and much of the strength of the present college program is due to his untiring and wise endeavors. After dean Oyer\u2019s untimely passing in 1931, Harold Bender became dean. He was a man whose influence upon the \"Old\" Mennonites was significant for much of the 20th century. Bender carefully piloted the stormy waters of theology by stating that [[Mennonitism]] was not [[liberalism]]. Bender later went on to say that [[fundamentalism]] also contributed to problems with theology and created ''[[The Anabaptist Vision]]'', a \"third way\" that sought to spell out the direction for the future Mennonite Church. More than arguing doctrine, Bender and a younger group of intellectuals at Goshen College sought to shape the Mennonite faith that was more ideological than institutional. The goal was to articulate a faith that could stand the test of academic scrutiny in broader society while carefully upholding traditional beliefs of the church. Out of this ideology, Bender started ''[[The Mennonite Quarterly Review]]''. Throughout this time, Goshen remained the epicenter of \"Old\" Mennonite theology and higher education, and became known as the \"Goshen Historical Renaissance\".<ref>Toews, Paul: ''Mennonites in American Society, 1930\u20131970: Modernity and the Persistence of Religious Community'', page 88. Herald Press, 1996</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s, Goshen was one of the [[Mennonite Central Committee]]'s key places to form a \"relief training school\" that helped to train volunteers for unpaid jobs in the [[Civilian Public Service]], an alternative to the Army. Many Mennonites chose the civilian service alternative because of their beliefs regarding Biblical pacifism and nonresistance.  Although the young women pacifists were not liable to the draft, they volunteered for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs to demonstrate their patriotism; many worked in mental hospitals.<ref>Rachel Waltner Goossen, ''Women Against the Good War: Conscientious Objection and Gender on the American Home Front, 1941\u20131947'' (1997) pp 98-111</ref>\n\nIn 1980, the college was granted care of [[Merry Lea Environmental Center|Merry Lea Environmental Learning Center]], a {{convert|1150|acre|km2|adj=mid}} nature preserve that now offers Goshen's master's degree in Environmental Science.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 1993, Harold and Wilma Good, longtime friends of the college, left their estate to Goshen. The estate was estimated at roughly $28 million, the majority in stock of the [[Smuckers|J.M. Smucker Company]]. Wilma was a daughter of the company's founder. The college sold the stock and added the funds to its endowment, more than doubling it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mennoweekly.org/JUNE/06-19-06/ENDOWMENTS06-19.html |title=Mennonite college endowments lag behind |publisher=Mennonite Weekly Review |year=2006 |accessdate=2008-03-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021020/http://www.mennoweekly.org/JUNE/06-19-06/ENDOWMENTS06-19.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe campus experienced a building boom in the later half of the 1990s through the present, with an estimated $30 million in new or renovated structures on campus. This included the addition of the Roman Gingerich Recreation-Fitness Center, the Music Center, the Connector, and the renovation of all dormitories. The college is currently working on a new campus master plan and strategic plan that will define the college's priorities for the years ahead.

All faculty members at the school are Christian, with at least eighty percent adhering to Mennonite convictions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}  The college holds convocations or chapels every Wednesday, with occasional special events, such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Students are required to attend half of these services per semester.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nGoshen College operates a campus ministries team, headed by the campus pastor. The team includes an assistant campus minister and student leaders who help guide and plan spiritual life on campus for the school year. Activities include managing the network of Goshen's small groups, spiritual friendship, leading campus worship, and planning chapels. Campus worship night is a voluntary praise and reflection time held every Wednesday night. Students also hold a [[Taiz\u00e9]] prayer service once a month on Sunday nights at 9:00. Because service is an important aspect of Christian faith, volunteerism ties in with spiritual life on campus.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n=== Volunteerism ===\nEvery September, Goshen College participates in an activity called Celebrate Service Day (CSD). Students team with professors and administrative faculty and go out into the larger Goshen community for a day of service. First-year students go with their colloquium advisers, while other students go with their dormitory floor or small group. Aside from CSD, many students donate their time to work at local kindergartens, elementary schools, hospitals, and nursing homes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n== Athletics ==\nGoshen College athletic teams are known as the \"Maple Leafs,\" chosen due to the city of Goshen being referred to as ''\"The Maple City.\"''{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nGoshen is a member of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] and competes in the [[Crossroads League]] (formerly known as the [[Mid-Central College Conference]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Name and Logo|url=http://www.crossroadsleague.com/f/Name_and_Logo.php|website=Crossroads League|publisher=Crossroads League|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}</ref>).

Started in the 1970s, SGH offers students the opportunity to live in a house arrangement, with common kitchen and living spaces. The purpose of SGH is for students to develop another living experience alternative to dormitory life. This same idea was carried out with the construction of the Apartments. Goshen College maintains that SGH living is a privilege, and students must apply as a group to live in a residence. An application board consisting of resident directors, spiritual life, and physical plant review all potential candidates in the spring for the next school year. Each group must create a housing plan, division of responsibility, show examples of volunteerism, and a commitment to better the Goshen campus, as well as resolve conflict.

It was founded in 1894 as the '''Elkhart Institute of Science, Industry and the Arts''', and is affiliated with [[Mennonite Church USA]]. The college is [[school accreditation|accredited]] by the ]]Higher Learning Commission]]. Goshen has an enrollment of 950 students.<ref name=\"GC Quick Facts\" /> While Goshen maintains a distinctive liberal Mennonite worldview, it admits students of all religions. [[Mennonite]]s make up 43 percent of the student body.<ref name=\"GC Quick Facts\" />\n\nGoshen College is home to ''[[The Mennonite Quarterly Review]]'' and the [[Mennonite Historical Library]], a research library compiling one of the world's most comprehensive collection of [[Anabaptist]] and Mennonite primary source material.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = American Historical Association| title = Mennonite Historical Library| encyclopedia = American Historical Association Archives Wiki| date = 2013-05-17| url = http://archiveswiki.historians.org/index.php/Mennonite_Historical_Library}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe history of Goshen College (or Goshen, as it is commonly known) is intertwined with that of the history of Mennonites in America,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} and so Goshen's history is best told in the context of this broader history.{{according to whom|date=August 2016}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} \"Old\" Mennonites had traditionally been suspicious of higher education, but by the late 19th century, opinion started to change.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Decades earlier, [[mainline Protestant]] church denominations had begun to found colleges across America, with the hope of developing well-trained clergy for their congregations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} As more \"Old\" Mennonites sent their children to other Christian colleges, they realized that, without a college of their own, many of their youth would leave the church.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Thus, prompted in part as a reaction to mainline Christianity, the \"Old\" Mennonites started the Elkhart Institute in [[Elkhart, Indiana]] in August 1894, to prepare Mennonite youth for college.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Today,{{when|date=April 2017}} Goshen is open to everyone, but this earlier vision and its historical relationship with the Mennonite Church remains visible: it is home to ''[[The Mennonite Quarterly Review]]'', [[Mennonite Historical Library]], [[Mennonite Church USA Archives]], including Mennonite Central Committee archives, offices of \"The Mennonite\", and it has numerous alumni connections with the broader Mennonite Church.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nGoshen was the first Mennonite school of higher education in North America to confer a four-year degree.{{according to whom|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}<ref>[[Bethel College (Kansas)|Bethel College]], which was incorporated in 1887 and opened at its present site in 1893, is older, but did not originally grant four-year degrees.{{Original research inline|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}</ref>  H.A. Mumaw, a practicing physician, first led the small operation; in 1894, a group of 15 \"Old\" Mennonite ministers and laymen started a corporation that they named the Elkhart Institute association.<ref>Schlabach, Theron F: ''Peace, Faith, Nation: Mennonites and Amish in Nineteenth Century America'', page 300. Herald Press, 1988</ref>  The first diploma was awarded in 1898.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Lured by businessmen to relocate several miles away to [[Goshen, Indiana]], the Institute moved in September 1903 and added a junior college course list, renaming itself Goshen College.{{when|date=April 2017}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} By 1906, the Mennonite Board of Education had taken control of the college, dissolving the Elkhart Institute Association.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} A complete college course was established in 1908, and the first Bachelor of Arts degrees were conferred in 1910.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} After 1910, most of Goshen's students were enrolled in college courses. From 1914 to 1919, partly out of response to its constituents, Goshen College attempted a \"School of Agriculture,\" which sought to prepare Mennonite young people to return to their rural communities; the hope was that such a program would spark a technological revolution among some of the farmers, but it was never a success and was cut after [[World War I]], five years after it began.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The college-prep academy program of Goshen College was discontinued in 1935.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe school was closed during the 1923\u20131924 school year by the Mennonite Board of Education but reopened the following year. One of many factors in closing the college was denominational tension due to [[Liberal Christianity|modernist]] and [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christian]] theologies of the 1920s and their impact on Mennonite theology at the school.<ref>Juhnke, James C: ''Vision, Doctrine, War: Mennonite Identity and Organization in America 1890\u20131930'', page 128. Herald Press, 1989</ref> In response to this crisis, many of Goshen's faculty and dozens of students, angry with the Mennonite Board of Education's decision, relocated to [[Bluffton University|Bluffton College]]. As part of the larger ongoing reaction against liberalism through the early 20th century, [[Hesston College]] and [[Eastern Mennonite University|Eastern Mennonite School]] were formed among \"Old\" Mennonites, although staunch traditionalists realized that no higher education was particularly safe.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nWhen the institution was reopened, it was marked by the new leadership of president [[Sanford Calvin Yoder|S.C. Yoder]] and dean [[Harold S. Bender|Noah Oyer,]] who manifested outstanding abilities. His character was one marked by simplicity, modesty, and refinement, as well as unusual wisdom and insight. Under his leadership the educational program of the College developed rapidly, and much of the strength of the present college program is due to his untiring and wise endeavors. After dean Oyer\u2019s untimely passing in 1931, Harold Bender became dean. He was a man whose influence upon the \"Old\" Mennonites was significant for much of the 20th century. Bender carefully piloted the stormy waters of theology by stating that [[Mennonitism]] was not [[liberalism]]. Bender later went on to say that [[fundamentalism]] also contributed to problems with theology and created ''[[The Anabaptist Vision]]'', a \"third way\" that sought to spell out the direction for the future Mennonite Church. More than arguing doctrine, Bender and a younger group of intellectuals at Goshen College sought to shape the Mennonite faith that was more ideological than institutional. The goal was to articulate a faith that could stand the test of academic scrutiny in broader society while carefully upholding traditional beliefs of the church. Out of this ideology, Bender started ''[[The Mennonite Quarterly Review]]''. Throughout this time, Goshen remained the epicenter of \"Old\" Mennonite theology and higher education, and became known as the \"Goshen Historical Renaissance\".<ref>Toews, Paul: ''Mennonites in American Society, 1930\u20131970: Modernity and the Persistence of Religious Community'', page 88. Herald Press, 1996</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s, Goshen was one of the [[Mennonite Central Committee]]'s key places to form a \"relief training school\" that helped to train volunteers for unpaid jobs in the [[Civilian Public Service]], an alternative to the Army. Many Mennonites chose the civilian service alternative because of their beliefs regarding Biblical pacifism and nonresistance.  Although the young women pacifists were not liable to the draft, they volunteered for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs to demonstrate their patriotism; many worked in mental hospitals.<ref>Rachel Waltner Goossen, ''Women Against the Good War: Conscientious Objection and Gender on the American Home Front, 1941\u20131947'' (1997) pp 98-111</ref>\n\nIn 1980, the college was granted care of [[Merry Lea Environmental Center|Merry Lea Environmental Learning Center]], a {{convert|1150|acre|km2|adj=mid}} nature preserve that now offers Goshen's master's degree in Environmental Science.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 1993, Harold and Wilma Good, longtime friends of the college, left their estate to Goshen. The estate was estimated at roughly $28 million, the majority in stock of the [[Smuckers|J.M. Smucker Company]]. Wilma was a daughter of the company's founder. The college sold the stock and added the funds to its endowment, more than doubling it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mennoweekly.org/JUNE/06-19-06/ENDOWMENTS06-19.html |title=Mennonite college endowments lag behind |publisher=Mennonite Weekly Review |year=2006 |accessdate=2008-03-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021020/http://www.mennoweekly.org/JUNE/06-19-06/ENDOWMENTS06-19.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe campus experienced a building boom in the later half of the 1990s through the present, with an estimated $30 million in new or renovated structures on campus. This included the addition of the Roman Gingerich Recreation-Fitness Center, the Music Center, the Connector, and the renovation of all dormitories. The college is currently working on a new campus master plan and strategic plan that will define the college's priorities for the years ahead. Today, more than 20,000 Goshen College alumni have been counted, residing in more than 85 countries.

Throughout the year, students can participate in the coed sports of outdoor soccer, volleyball, sand volleyball, kickball, touch football, ultimate frisbee, and wiffleball, as well as basketball, indoor soccer, and 3-on-3 basketball.<ref>{{cite web|title=Intramurals|url=https://www.goshen.edu/campuslife/intramurals/|website=Goshen College|publisher=Goshen College|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Media ===\n\nGoshen College has its own school newspaper, ''The Record'' and its own radio station, [[WGCS]], branded as 91.1FM The Globe. On March 12, 2011, The Globe was named the Best College Station in the Nation, winning first place at the 71st Annual Conference of the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System (IBS) in New York City. On March 2, 2013, The Globe was again named Best College Station in the Nation, making it the first college to win the award twice.\nGoshen College Television (GCTV) produces a bi-weekly news show, \"The Correspondent\", which covers campus and community news. GCTV has also been involved in several larger projects, including the broadcast of the school's annual Festival of Carols on [[WNIT (TV)|WNIT]]. In the summer of 2011, the Goshen College communication department launched FiveCore Media, a video production company aimed at providing services for both on-campus and off-campus clients.\nEvery year Goshen College publishes the Maple Leaf, the school's yearbook, created, designed and managed by students.

All faculty members at the school are Christian, with at least eighty percent adhering to Mennonite convictions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}  The college holds convocations or chapels every Wednesday, with occasional special events, such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Students are required to attend half of these services per semester.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nGoshen College operates a campus ministries team, headed by the campus pastor. The team includes an assistant campus minister and student leaders who help guide and plan spiritual life on campus for the school year. Activities include managing the network of Goshen's small groups, spiritual friendship, leading campus worship, and planning chapels. Campus worship night is a voluntary praise and reflection time held every Wednesday night. Students also hold a [[Taiz\u00e9]] prayer service once a month on Sunday nights at 9:00. Because service is an important aspect of Christian faith, volunteerism ties in with spiritual life on campus.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n=== Volunteerism ===\nEvery September, Goshen College participates in an activity called Celebrate Service Day (CSD). Students team with professors and administrative faculty and go out into the larger Goshen community for a day of service.

The university is a member-school of the [[Thurgood Marshall College Fund]].\n\n==History==\nThe school was founded in 1897 and was known as the '''Oklahoma Colored Agricultural and Normal University'''. From 1898 to 1916 its president was [[Inman E. Page]]. Langston University was created as a result of the second [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts#Expansion|Morrill Act]] in 1890. The law required states with [[land-grant university|land-grant colleges]] (such as [[Oklahoma State University]], then known as Oklahoma A&M) to either admit African Americans, or provide an alternative school for them to attend as a condition of receiving federal funds.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/L/LA021.html| title=OHS Publications Division| accessdate=26 January 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007035506/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/ENCYCLOPEDIA/entries/L/LA021.html| archive-date=2014-10-07| url-status=dead}}</ref> The university was renamed as Langston University in 1941 in honor of [[John Mercer Langston]] (1829\u20131897), [[civil rights]] pioneer, first [[African American]] member of [[U.

Some of the most serious problems have been political influences, financial stress, and lack of adequate space and equipment. During the 1960s the campus underwent a complete makeover. New buildings appeared, and additions were made to the library and auditorium.\n\nPoet [[Melvin B. Tolson]] taught at Langston from 1947 until 1964.

It is the only [[historically black college]] in the state. Though located in a rural setting {{convert|10|mi|0}} east of [[Guthrie, Oklahoma|Guthrie]], Langston also serves an urban mission, with University Centers in both [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] (at the same campus as the [[OSU-Tulsa]] facility) and [[Oklahoma City]], and a nursing program set to open in [[Ardmore, Oklahoma|Ardmore]]. The university is a member-school of the [[Thurgood Marshall College Fund]].\n\n==History==\nThe school was founded in 1897 and was known as the '''Oklahoma Colored Agricultural and Normal University'''. From 1898 to 1916 its president was [[Inman E. Page]]. Langston University was created as a result of the second [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts#Expansion|Morrill Act]] in 1890. The law required states with [[land-grant university|land-grant colleges]] (such as [[Oklahoma State University]], then known as Oklahoma A&M) to either admit African Americans, or provide an alternative school for them to attend as a condition of receiving federal funds.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/L/LA021.html| title=OHS Publications Division| accessdate=26 January 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007035506/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/ENCYCLOPEDIA/entries/L/LA021.html| archive-date=2014-10-07| url-status=dead}}</ref> The university was renamed as Langston University in 1941 in honor of [[John Mercer Langston]] (1829\u20131897), [[civil rights]] pioneer, first [[African American]] member of [[U. S. Congress|Congress]] from [[Virginia]], founder of the [[Howard University Law School]], and American consul-general to [[Haiti]].\n\nThrough the years Langston University has developed slowly but surely. Some of the most serious problems have been political influences, financial stress, and lack of adequate space and equipment. During the 1960s the campus underwent a complete makeover. New buildings appeared, and additions were made to the library and auditorium.\n\nPoet [[Melvin B. Tolson]] taught at Langston from 1947 until 1964. Tolson was portrayed by [[Denzel Washington]] in the film ''[[The Great Debaters]]''.\n\n==Academics==\n\nSix schools house the degree programs of Langston University: Agriculture and Applied Sciences; Arts and Sciences; Business; Education and Behavioral Science; Nursing and Health Professions; and Physical Therapy. A total of 29 undergraduate and six graduate degree programs are offered at LU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.langston.edu/sites/default/files/basic-content-files/School+Profile+10-19-15+updated.pdf|title=Langston University -|author=|date=|website=www.langston.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe university offers the Edwin P.

Men's sports include basketball, football, and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cheerleading, softball, track & field and volleyball.  There is also a co-ed club soccer program. The present [[athletic director]] is Donnita Rogers. The Lions won the 1939 and 1941 [[Black college football national championship|HBCU National Championships in football]].
