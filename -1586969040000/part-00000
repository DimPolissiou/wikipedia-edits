[[Karna]] is also called Kaunteya when his real identity as Kunti's son comes to be known after the war.\n** These three are also called Partha, since Pritha is another name of Kunti.{{clarify |reason=What does ''Partha'' mean?

His name means \"one who is steadfast even during war\". His parents were Kunti and Yama, god of virtue, justice and morality. Though he lacked the characteristic combat prowess of a [[Kshatriya]], Yudhishthira was one of the most virtuous men, skilled in the duties of a king and steadfast in the path of [[dharma]]. He was a good king who, along with his brothers, founded the prosperous city of [[Indraprastha]]. By Krishna's designs and his brothers' conquests, Yudhishthira became the emperor of the world. He performed two [[Ashwamedha]] sacrifices and one [[Rajasuya]] sacrifice. Yudhishthira learnt to control the dice from the Sage Brihadaswa and became good at playing chess. His other names are Ajatshatru (\"without enemies\") and Dharmaraja (\"admired for virtues\").\n\n* [[Bhima]]: The second Pandava brother. His name means \"of terrible might\". His parents were Kunti and Vayu, the god of air and wind, who was known for his might. Bhima has the physical strength and prowess equal to a hundred elephants and was very athletic. He was aggressive and prone to anger. Bhima was devoted to his family and was their natural protector. He was a master in wielding the mace. He was also a powerful archer, having fought [[Drona]] and [[Ashwatthama]] and [[Karna]] on several occasions. Bhima was also very skilled in diverse areas of warfare, including wrestling, charioteering, riding elephants and sword fighting. Along with Arjuna, he went on expeditions to conquer the kingdoms to the east and south. During the [[Rajasuya]] [[Yagna]], Bhima subjugated the kingdoms of the eastern direction completely. He slew Krishna's most dangerous enemy, [[Jarasandha]], in a wrestling bout, and slew the Matsya commander, [[Kichaka]], for attempting to molesting [[Draupadi]]. During the war, Bhima was most famous for slaying one hundred Kauravas and [[Duryodhana]] himself. He was also skilled in chopping wood, cooking, culinary arts and sciences. Bhima's other name was Vrikodara (\"wolf bellied\"). However, he was selfish as well. He married a [[Rakshasa|rakshashi]] Hidimba during their hiding in the forest in addition to Draupadi and had a son Ghatotkachh.\n\n* [[Arjuna]]: The third Pandava brother. His name relates to \"arjana\" or earning. His parents were Kunti and Indra, king of the gods and the god of the sky and war. He was very virtuous and avoided unjust acts. He was known for his singleminded concentration, determination and his devotion to Krishna. He was the only person to whom Lord Krishna displayed his complete param avtara. Arjuna was more fortunate than his brothers as he was the favourite of Bhishma, popular among the people, famous among the gods and attractive to women. He was the favourite disciple of his guru [[Drona]], who taught weaponry. Arjuna was ambidextrous and perhaps the greatest of archers, having mastered archery to the highest possible level. He was rivalled by Bhishma, Drona and Karna. In those days, archery was considered to be the foremost of all fighting disciplines, and Arjuna's mastery over it contributed to his popularity. Arjuna was a complete master archer, a supreme chariot warrior and had also obtained near-perfect mastery over almost all divine, celestial and esoteric weapons, along with the secrets of invoking and recalling them. He spent five years acquiring and mastering divine weapons from Indra and the other gods. He also acquired the mastery over the rarest and the most powerful weapon, the [[Pashupatastra]], from Lord [[Shiva]] himself. He also had command over devastating weapons like the [[Brahmastra]].\n\n* [[Nakula]]: The fourth Pandava brother. His name means \"without ''kula'' (or, lineage)\". His parents were Madri and the [[Ashwin]] twin [[Nasatya]]. He was attractive, humble, diplomatic and helpful. During the [[Rajasuya]] Yagna, Nakula conquered the western direction. During the [[Kurukshetra]] War, he slew many warriors including many sons of [[Karna]] and son of Shakuni, [[Uluka]]. Nakula and his younger twin brother, Sahadeva, were excellent sword fighters. Nakula was also a master of equestrian arts and sciences, skilled in wielding unusual weapons, in chariotry and in riding horses. He was known for his understanding and special ways with horses.\n\n* [[Sahadeva]]: The fifth and the youngest brother of the Pandavas. His name means \"along gods\" or \"with gods\". His parents were Madri and the [[Ashwin]] twin [[Dasra]]. Sahadeva was the wisest of all the Pandava brothers, and the most mysterious and introverted. Like Nakula, Sahadeva was a master of sword fighting. He was also skilled in fighting and taming wild bulls. Additionally, he was a skilled cowherd, capable of maintaining cattle, treating their diseases, assessing their health, milking them and in producing milk products. Sahadeva acquired mastery over the science of Dharma, religious scriptures and other branches of knowledge under the tutelage of the Sage [[Brihaspati]], the preceptor of the gods. Sahadeva had a strong premonition which often warned him of upcoming dangers. During the [[Rajasuya]] War, Sahadeva conquered the southern direction, up to the kingdom of [[Lanka]]. During the [[Kurukshetra]] War, Sahadeva slew the wicked [[Shakuni]].\n\n* {{anchor|Karna}}[[Karna]]: The unknown Pandava. His name refers to the earrings he was born with. His parents were Kunti and [[Surya]], god of the Sun. He was born many years before Kunti's marriage to Pandu and the subsequent birth of the Pandavas. When she was unmarried, Kunti rashly tested the power of [[Durvasa]]'s [[mantra]], invoking Surya. Bound by the power of the mantra, Surya sired Karna with Kunti. Karna was born with golden armour and earrings, which granted him complete immunity to divine weapons and any physical threat. Fearing censure, Kunti set him afloat in the Ganga river in a wicker basket filled with lotuses and he was subsequently found and raised by Adhirath, a charioteer of Hastinapur and his wife Radha. He gained the knowledge of divine and celestial weapons comparable to Arjuna under parashurama. He helped Duryodhana kidnap the princess of [[Kalinga (Mahabharata)|Kalinga]] in her [[Swayamvara]], and he singlehandedly defeated all the kings in battle. When criticised by Bhishma, Karna pointed out that Bhishma had done the same thing in the past. Karna was the only warrior to defeat and humble the powerful [[Jarasandha]] in battle. For the first and only time in his life, Jarasandha surrendered to Karna and made an alliance with him. When Bhishma ridiculed Karna for his pathetic combat prowess, Karna single-handedly conquered the entire world and made Duryodhana the emperor. During the Kurukshetra War, Bhishma declared that the Pandavas were invincible. Karna proved him wrong by defeating Yudhishthira, Bhima, Nakula and Sahadeva on several occasions during the battle. He used the Amogh Shakti weapon of Lord Indra  during the Kurukshetra war to kill Ghatothkachh. Urged by Krishna, Arjuna beheaded Karna when he was trying to pull his chariot wheel from the mud. Karna was a great master in archery, equalling Dronacharya, Bhishma and Arjuna . When Kunti revealed Karna's true origin to the Pandavas, they were completely devastated. Yudhishthira nearly lost the will to rule the kingdom after finding the truth about Karna.\n\n==Story==\n[[File:General Bhimasen.jpg|thumb|250px|Bhima, the second Pandava, powerful warrior]]\n\nThe story begins with the introduction of the brothers' parents. Amongst the primary antagonists was [[Duryodhana]] (loosely translated as \"unconquerable\"), cousin to the Pandavas. He was the eldest of 100 brothers known as the Kauravas, who were born to [[Dhritarashtra]], the blind king of [[Hastinapura]], and his queen [[Gandhari (character)|Gandhari]], princess of [[Gandhara]].\n\nThe Pandavas were born to [[Pandu]] and his wives, [[Kunti]] and [[Madri]] by the boon given to Kunti by [[Durvasa]], that she could have a son by any god whom she respects without having any marital affair. After Madri's marriage, Pandu voluntary renounced royal life as penance for having accidentally killed the sage Rishi [[Kindama]] and his wife. At his death, Rishi Kindama cursed Pandu that he would surely die if he attempted to have sexual relationships with his wives. Because of this curse, Kunti had to use her boon to get sons. She bore him three sons: Yudhishthira by the god of [[Dharma]], Bhima by the god of [[Wind]], and Arjuna by [[Lord Indra]]. At the request of Pandu she shared this boon with Madri to get her sons, the twins Nakula and Sahadeva from the divine [[Ashvins|Ashvin]] twins.\n\nAfter the death of Pandu and Madri's [[Sati (practice)|sati]], Kunti brought the Pandavas back to Hastinapur. As children, the Pandavas and Kauravas often played together. However, Bhima (one of the Pandavas) was always at odds with the Kauravas, particularly with Duryodhana, who refused to accept the Pandavas as his kin. This usually led to much tension between the cousins. Insecure and jealous, Duryodhana harboured intense hatred for the five brothers throughout his childhood and youth, and following the advice of his maternal uncle [[Shakuni]], often plotted to get rid of them to clear his path to the lordship of the [[Kuru Dynasty]].\n\nThis plotting took a grave turn when Dhritarashtra had to relent to the will of the masses and rightfully appointed his nephew Yudhishthira as crown prince. This went against the personal ambitions of both father and son (Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana) and drove Duryodhana into such a rage that he enthusiastically agreed to an evil ploy by [[Shakuni]] to murder Yudhishthira. Shakuni commissioned the construction of a palace in Varnavrata, secretly built by incorporating flammable materials into the structure, most notably the lacquer known as [[shellac|lac]]. This palace was known as [[Lakshagraha]]. Duryodhana then successfully lobbied Dhritarashtra to send Yudhishthira to represent the royal household in Varnavrata during the celebrations of Shiva Mahotsava. The plan was to set the palace on fire during the night while Yudhishthira would likely be asleep. Yudhishthira left for Varnavrata, accompanied by his four brothers and their mother Kunti. The plan was discovered by their paternal uncle [[Vidura]], who was very loyal to them and an extraordinarily wise man. In addition, Yudhishthira had been forewarned about this plot by a hermit who came to him and spoke of an imminent disaster. Vidura arranged for a tunnel to be secretly built for the Pandavs to safely escape the palace as it was set afire.\n\n[[File:Pandavs Journeying With Their Mother.jpg|thumb|250px|Pandavas' Journeying With Their Mother]]\n\nAfter their flight from the palace, the five brothers lived in the forests for some time disguised as Brahmins. They heard from a group of travelling sages about a contest ([[Swayamvara]]) being held in the Kingdom of Panchala that offered the princess Draupadi's hand in marriage to the winner. The Swayamvara turned out to rely on the skills of archery, and Arjuna, who was a peerless archer, entered the competition and won. When the brothers took Draupadi to introduce her to their mother, they announced to Kunti that they had arrived with excellent alms. Kunti was busy with some work, and replied without turning to look at Draupadi (who was the alms referred to) ordering the brothers to share the alms equally amongst the five of them. Even when uttered erroneously, their mother's word was supreme for the Pandavas, and they agreed to share the princess, who was subsequently married to all five brothers.\n\nWhen Dhritarashtra heard that the five brothers were alive, he invited them back to the kingdom. However, in their absence, Duryodhana had succeeded in being made the crown prince. Upon the return of the Pandavas, the issue of returning Yudhishthira's crown to him was raised. Dhritarashtra led the subsequent discussions into ambiguity and agreed to a partition of the kingdom \"to do justice to both crown princes\". He retained the developed Hastinapur for himself and Duryodhana and gave the barren, arid and hostile lands of [[Khandavaprastha]] to the Pandavas. The Pandavas successfully developed their land and built a great and lavish city, which was considered comparable to the heavens, and thus came to be known as [[Indraprastha]].\n\nReeling under the loss of half the lands of his future kingdom, Duryodhana's jealousy and rage were further fuelled by the Pandavas' success and prosperity. Eventually [[Shakuni]] sired yet another ploy and got Duryodhana to invite the Pandavas over to his court for a game of dice (gambling). Shakuni was a master at gambling and owned a pair of dice which magically did his bidding. Owing to this, bet after bet, Yudhishthira lost all of his wealth, and eventually his kingdom, in the game. He was then enticed by Duryodhana and Shakuni to place his brothers as bets. Yudhishthira fell for it and put his brothers on stake, losing them too. He then placed himself as a bet and lost again. Duryodhana now played another trick and told Yudhishthira that he still had his wife Draupadi to place as a bet and if Yudhishthira won, he would return everything to the Pandavas. Yudhishthira fell for the ruse and bet Draupadi, losing her too. At this point Duryodhana ordered that Draupadi, who was now a slave to him, be brought to the court. None of the Pandavas fought for their wife's honour. Duryodhana's younger brother [[Dushasana]] dragged Draupadi to the royal court, pulling her by her hair, insulting her dignity and asserting that she, like the Pandava brothers, was now their servant. This caused immense anguish to all the great warriors seated in the court, but each of them, namely, [[Bhishma]] (grandsire of the clan), [[Dronacharya]] (teacher/[[guru]] of Kauravas and Pandavas) and [[Kripacharya]] except [[Vidura]] remained silent. Duryodhana then ordered Dushasana to disrobe Draupadi before everyone, as a slave girl has no rights. The elders and warriors in audience were shocked but did not intervene. As Dushasana began to disrobe her, she prayed to God to protect her honour, and Lord Krishna protected her by providing her garments an unending length. Finally, as the blind king Dhritharasthra realised that this humiliation could prompt Draupadi to curse his sons, he intervened, apologising to Draupadi for the behaviour of his sons, and turned the winnings of dice game back over to the Pandava brothers, releasing them from the bondage of slavery.\n\n[[File:Arjuna wins Draupadi.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Arjuna]] shooting at the eye of a fish to win [[Draupadi]] in marriage, [[Kalighat painting]]]]\n\nIncensed at the loss of all that he had won, Duryodhana threatened suicide and coerced his father into inviting the Pandavas for one last round of gambling, the terms of which were that the loser would be condemned to 12 years of exile into forests and a 13th year to be spent incognito, and if the cover be blown during the 13th year, another cycle of 13 years would ensue. Obeying their uncle's orders, the Pandavas played the round and again lost to Shakuni's cheating. However, this time, their patience had been nearly pushed to its edge. During the 12 years of exile in the forest, they prepared for war. Arjuna performed penance and won the entire gamut of celestial weapons (Divyasatras) as boons from the Gods. They spent the 13th year masquerading as peasants in the service of the royal family of [[Virata]], the king of [[Matsya]]. Upon completion of the terms of the last bet, the Pandavas returned and demanded that their kingdom be rightfully returned to them. Duryodhana refused to yield Indraprastha. For the sake of peace and to avert a disastrous war, Krishna proposed that if Hastinapur agrees to give the Pandavas only five villages named Indraprastha ([[Delhi]]), Swarnprastha ([[Sonipat]]), Panprastha ([[Panipat]]), Vyaghrprastha ([[Baghpat]]) and Tilprastha ([[Tilpat]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.naidunia.com/spiritual/vrat-tyohar-geeta-jayanti-2019-had-asked-these-five-villages-from-kauravas-know-about-these-4030796|title=Geeta Jayanti 2019 Pandavas had asked these five villages from Kauravas Know about these|date=2019-12-05|website=Nai Dunia|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qCduAAAAMAAJ&q=five+villages+demanded+by+pandavas&dq=five+villages+demanded+by+pandavas|title=The cities of Delhi|last=Jain|first=Ashok Kumar|date=1994|publisher=Management Pub.

Thus the stage was set for the great war, for which the epic of Mahabharata is known most of all.\n\nThe war was intense and lasted 18 days, over the course of which both parties worked around, bent and even broke rules of warfare. At the end, all 100 [[Kauravas|Kaurava brothers]] and their entire army was slain, with only four surviving on their side. The Pandavas too lost several allies but the five brothers survived. After having won the war Yudhishthira was crowned the king.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Death of Pandavas==\n[[File:Yudhisthira with a dog as a chariot from heaven arrive.jpg|thumb|250px|Yudhishthira and his dog ascending to Heaven]]\n\nThe Pandavas ruled Hastinapur for 36 years and established a righteous kingdom. Shortly after the death of Lord Krishna, they all decided that the time had come for them to renounce the world, as the age of [[Kali yuga]] had started.\n\nSo the five Pandavas and Draupadi left to the path of liberation. For this purpose they all climbed [[Mount Kailash]], which leads to the [[Swarga Loka]]. On their way, all except Yudhisthira slipped and died one by one. Yudhisthira was accompanied by a dog who was none other than Lord Yama himself.\n\nThe first to die was Draupadi; she was imperfect because she preferred Arjuna over her other husbands. Then it was Sahadeva, imperfect because he was smug about his knowledge. He was followed by Nakula, imperfect because he was arrogant about his good looks. Then fell Arjuna, imperfect because he was always jealous of other archers. Next was Bhima, imperfect because he was a glutton. Only the eldest Pandava, Yudhisthira, reached the door of Swarga Loka, carried on Lord Indra's chariot. On reaching Heaven he did not find either his virtuous brothers or his wife Draupadi. Instead he saw Karna, Bhishma, Dronacharya etc. and their sons.\n\nHe wanted an explanation from Lord Yama, the lord of death. Lord Yama explained that the Kauravas had been allowed into heaven because they died as warriors on the battlefield. This earned them so much merit and credit that it wiped out all their debts. Yudhisthira demanded to know where his brothers and his wife were. He was then taken to hell. Lord Yama explained that they were experiencing the reactions of their actions but it was temporary. Once the debt had been repaid, they would join them in Swarga. Yudhisthira loyally met his brothers, but the sight and sound of gore and blood horrified him. Though initially he was tempted to flee, he mastered himself and remained after hearing the voices of his beloved brothers and Draupadi calling out to him, asking him to stay with them in their misery. Yudhisthira decided to remain, ordering the divine charioteer to return. He preferred to live in hell with good people than in a heaven of his enemies. Eventually this turned out to be another illusion to test him.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Krishna's help to Pandavas===\n[[File:Wayang Pandawa.jpg|thumb|right|Five Pandavas in [[Wayang]] form. From left to right: [[Bhima]], [[Arjuna]], [[Yudhishthira]], [[Nakula]] and [[Sahadeva]]. [[Indonesia Museum]], Jakarta.]]\n\nKrishna, being a well wisher of the Pandavas, helped them in various ways during the time of their ordeals. When the kurukshetra war was going to be held, both Arjuna on behalf of the Pandavas, and Duryodhan on behalf of the Kauravas, went to Krishna to seek help.\nDuryodhan reached first and Arjuna was just behind him. They entered Krishna's room and found him sleeping. Duryodhan sat on a raised chair near Krishna's head and Arjuna sat near Krishna's feet closing his hands.\nWhen Krishna woke up, he saw Arjuna first and asked him about the purpose of his visit. Then he found Duryodhan sitting next to him, and asked him the same question. Krishna was then told that war was going to be held and Arjuna and Duryodhan had come to him seeking his military help. To this Krishna replied that he had seen Arjuna first and so he would give him priority, and asked what he needed. He gave Arjuna two options - either his one lakh fit and healthy army or Krishna himself who shall not fight in the war. To this Arjuna immediately opted for Krishna for his help and thus Duryodhan was given Krishna's one lakh army. Duryodhan was very satisfied to have received the huge army. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Parents of Pandavas==\n[[File:Kunti Gandhari Dhrtarashtra.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Kunti]] leading [[Gandhari (character)|Gandhari]].

On one occasion, Draupadi was kidnapped and abducted from a hermitage in the forest by the wicked king [[Jayadratha]]. When her husbands learned of the crime, they came in hot pursuit. Seeing them approach, Jayadratha asked Draupadi to describe them. Angrily, Draupadi told the king his time was up and that the knowledge would do him no good. She then proceeded to give the description. (Mahabharat, Book III: Varna Parva, Section 268.)\n\n* According to Draupadi, Yudhishthira possessed a \"complexion like that of pure gold, possessed of a prominent nose and large eyes and endued with a slender make.\" Master of the spear. He was just, had a correct sense of morality and was merciful to surrendering foes. Draupadi counselled Jayadratha to run to Yudhishthira and to beg for forgiveness.\n* Draupadi described Bhima as tall and long-armed. In a display of ferocity, he was \"biting his lips and contracting his forehead so as to bring the two eyebrows together.\" The master of the mace, his superhuman feats had earned him great renown. \"They that offend him are never suffered to live. He never forgets a foe. On some pretext or other he wreaks his vengeance.\"\n* Arjuna she praised as the greatest of archers, intelligent, second to none \"with senses under complete control.\" Neither lust nor fear nor anger could make him forsake virtue. Though capable of withstanding any foe, he would never commit an act of cruelty.\n* Nakula, said Draupadi, was \"the most handsome person in the whole world.\" An accomplished master swordsman, he was also \"versed in every question of morality and profit\" and \"endued with high wisdom.\" He was unflinchingly devoted to his brothers, who in turn regarded him as more valuable than their own lives. The name Nakula generally means full of love and the male characteristics implied by the name are: Intelligence, Focus, Hard-Work, Handsomeness, Health, Attractiveness, Success, Popularity, Respect and unconditional Love.\n* Finally, Sahadeva was the youngest of the brothers and like the others formidable in war and observant of morality.

His name means \"one who is steadfast even during war\". His parents were Kunti and Yama, god of virtue, justice and morality. Though he lacked the characteristic combat prowess of a [[Kshatriya]], Yudhishthira was one of the most virtuous men, skilled in the duties of a king and steadfast in the path of [[dharma]]. He was a good king who, along with his brothers, founded the prosperous city of [[Indraprastha]]. By Krishna's designs and his brothers' conquests, Yudhishthira became the emperor of the world. He performed two [[Ashwamedha]] sacrifices and one [[Rajasuya]] sacrifice. Yudhishthira learnt to control the dice from the Sage Brihadaswa and became good at playing chess. His other names are Ajatshatru (\"without enemies\") and Dharmaraja (\"admired for virtues\").\n\n* [[Bhima]]: The second Pandava brother. His name means \"of terrible might\". His parents were Kunti and Vayu, the god of air and wind, who was known for his might. Bhima has the physical strength and prowess equal to a hundred elephants and was very athletic. He was aggressive and prone to anger. Bhima was devoted to his family and was their natural protector. He was a master in wielding the mace. He was also a powerful archer, having fought [[Drona]] and [[Ashwatthama]] and [[Karna]] on several occasions. Bhima was also very skilled in diverse areas of warfare, including wrestling, charioteering, riding elephants and sword fighting. Along with Arjuna, he went on expeditions to conquer the kingdoms to the east and south. During the [[Rajasuya]] [[Yagna]], Bhima subjugated the kingdoms of the eastern direction completely. He slew Krishna's most dangerous enemy, [[Jarasandha]], in a wrestling bout, and slew the Matsya commander, [[Kichaka]], for attempting to molesting [[Draupadi]]. During the war, Bhima was most famous for slaying one hundred Kauravas and [[Duryodhana]] himself. He was also skilled in chopping wood, cooking, culinary arts and sciences. Bhima's other name was Vrikodara (\"wolf bellied\"). However, he was selfish as well. He married a [[Rakshasa|rakshashi]] Hidimba during their hiding in the forest in addition to Draupadi and had a son Ghatotkachh.\n\n* [[Arjuna]]: The third Pandava brother. His name relates to \"arjana\" or earning. His parents were Kunti and Indra, king of the gods and the god of the sky and war. He was very virtuous and avoided unjust acts. He was known for his singleminded concentration, determination and his devotion to Krishna. He was the only person to whom Lord Krishna displayed his complete param avtara. Arjuna was more fortunate than his brothers as he was the favourite of Bhishma, popular among the people, famous among the gods and attractive to women. He was the favourite disciple of his guru [[Drona]], who taught weaponry. Arjuna was ambidextrous and perhaps the greatest of archers, having mastered archery to the highest possible level. He was rivalled by Bhishma, Drona and Karna. In those days, archery was considered to be the foremost of all fighting disciplines, and Arjuna's mastery over it contributed to his popularity. Arjuna was a complete master archer, a supreme chariot warrior and had also obtained near-perfect mastery over almost all divine, celestial and esoteric weapons, along with the secrets of invoking and recalling them. He spent five years acquiring and mastering divine weapons from Indra and the other gods. He also acquired the mastery over the rarest and the most powerful weapon, the [[Pashupatastra]], from Lord [[Shiva]] himself. He also had command over devastating weapons like the [[Brahmastra]].\n\n* [[Nakula]]: The fourth Pandava brother. His name means \"without ''kula'' (or, lineage)\". His parents were Madri and the [[Ashwin]] twin [[Nasatya]]. He was attractive, humble, diplomatic and helpful. During the [[Rajasuya]] Yagna, Nakula conquered the western direction. During the [[Kurukshetra]] War, he slew many warriors including many sons of [[Karna]] and son of Shakuni, [[Uluka]]. Nakula and his younger twin brother, Sahadeva, were excellent sword fighters. Nakula was also a master of equestrian arts and sciences, skilled in wielding unusual weapons, in chariotry and in riding horses. He was known for his understanding and special ways with horses.\n\n* [[Sahadeva]]: The fifth and the youngest brother of the Pandavas. His name means \"along gods\" or \"with gods\". His parents were Madri and the [[Ashwin]] twin [[Dasra]]. Sahadeva was the wisest of all the Pandava brothers, and the most mysterious and introverted. Like Nakula, Sahadeva was a master of sword fighting. He was also skilled in fighting and taming wild bulls. Additionally, he was a skilled cowherd, capable of maintaining cattle, treating their diseases, assessing their health, milking them and in producing milk products. Sahadeva acquired mastery over the science of Dharma, religious scriptures and other branches of knowledge under the tutelage of the Sage [[Brihaspati]], the preceptor of the gods. Sahadeva had a strong premonition which often warned him of upcoming dangers. During the [[Rajasuya]] War, Sahadeva conquered the southern direction, up to the kingdom of [[Lanka]]. During the [[Kurukshetra]] War, Sahadeva slew the wicked [[Shakuni]].\n\n* {{anchor|Karna}}[[Karna]]: The unknown Pandava. His name refers to the earrings he was born with. His parents were Kunti and [[Surya]], god of the Sun. He was born many years before Kunti's marriage to Pandu and the subsequent birth of the Pandavas. When she was unmarried, Kunti rashly tested the power of [[Durvasa]]'s [[mantra]], invoking Surya. Bound by the power of the mantra, Surya sired Karna with Kunti. Karna was born with golden armour and earrings, which granted him complete immunity to divine weapons and any physical threat. Fearing censure, Kunti set him afloat in the Ganga river in a wicker basket filled with lotuses and he was subsequently found and raised by Adhirath, a charioteer of Hastinapur and his wife Radha. He gained the knowledge of divine and celestial weapons comparable to Arjuna under parashurama. He helped Duryodhana kidnap the princess of [[Kalinga (Mahabharata)|Kalinga]] in her [[Swayamvara]], and he singlehandedly defeated all the kings in battle. When criticised by Bhishma, Karna pointed out that Bhishma had done the same thing in the past. Karna was the only warrior to defeat and humble the powerful [[Jarasandha]] in battle. For the first and only time in his life, Jarasandha surrendered to Karna and made an alliance with him. When Bhishma ridiculed Karna for his pathetic combat prowess, Karna single-handedly conquered the entire world and made Duryodhana the emperor. During the Kurukshetra War, Bhishma declared that the Pandavas were invincible. Karna proved him wrong by defeating Yudhishthira, Bhima, Nakula and Sahadeva on several occasions during the battle. He used the Amogh Shakti weapon of Lord Indra  during the Kurukshetra war to kill Ghatothkachh. Urged by Krishna, Arjuna beheaded Karna when he was trying to pull his chariot wheel from the mud. Karna was a great master in archery, equalling Dronacharya, Bhishma and Arjuna . When Kunti revealed Karna's true origin to the Pandavas, they were completely devastated. Yudhishthira nearly lost the will to rule the kingdom after finding the truth about Karna.\n\n==Story==\n[[File:General Bhimasen.jpg|thumb|250px|Bhima, the second Pandava, powerful warrior]]\n\nThe story begins with the introduction of the brothers' parents. Amongst the primary antagonists was [[Duryodhana]] (loosely translated as \"unconquerable\"), cousin to the Pandavas. He was the eldest of 100 brothers known as the Kauravas, who were born to [[Dhritarashtra]], the blind king of [[Hastinapura]], and his queen [[Gandhari (character)|Gandhari]], princess of [[Gandhara]].\n\nThe Pandavas were born to [[Pandu]] and his wives, [[Kunti]] and [[Madri]] by the boon given to Kunti by [[Durvasa]], that she could have a son by any god whom she respects without having any marital affair. After Madri's marriage, Pandu voluntary renounced royal life as penance for having accidentally killed the sage Rishi [[Kindama]] and his wife. At his death, Rishi Kindama cursed Pandu that he would surely die if he attempted to have sexual relationships with his wives. Because of this curse, Kunti had to use her boon to get sons. She bore him three sons: Yudhishthira by the god of [[Dharma]], Bhima by the god of [[Wind]], and Arjuna by [[Lord Indra]]. At the request of Pandu she shared this boon with Madri to get her sons, the twins Nakula and Sahadeva from the divine [[Ashvins|Ashvin]] twins.\n\nAfter the death of Pandu and Madri's [[Sati (practice)|sati]], Kunti brought the Pandavas back to Hastinapur. As children, the Pandavas and Kauravas often played together. However, Bhima (one of the Pandavas) was always at odds with the Kauravas, particularly with Duryodhana, who refused to accept the Pandavas as his kin. This usually led to much tension between the cousins. Insecure and jealous, Duryodhana harboured intense hatred for the five brothers throughout his childhood and youth, and following the advice of his maternal uncle [[Shakuni]], often plotted to get rid of them to clear his path to the lordship of the [[Kuru Dynasty]].\n\nThis plotting took a grave turn when Dhritarashtra had to relent to the will of the masses and rightfully appointed his nephew Yudhishthira as crown prince. This went against the personal ambitions of both father and son (Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana) and drove Duryodhana into such a rage that he enthusiastically agreed to an evil ploy by [[Shakuni]] to murder Yudhishthira. Shakuni commissioned the construction of a palace in Varnavrata, secretly built by incorporating flammable materials into the structure, most notably the lacquer known as [[shellac|lac]]. This palace was known as [[Lakshagraha]]. Duryodhana then successfully lobbied Dhritarashtra to send Yudhishthira to represent the royal household in Varnavrata during the celebrations of Shiva Mahotsava. The plan was to set the palace on fire during the night while Yudhishthira would likely be asleep. Yudhishthira left for Varnavrata, accompanied by his four brothers and their mother Kunti. The plan was discovered by their paternal uncle [[Vidura]], who was very loyal to them and an extraordinarily wise man. In addition, Yudhishthira had been forewarned about this plot by a hermit who came to him and spoke of an imminent disaster. Vidura arranged for a tunnel to be secretly built for the Pandavs to safely escape the palace as it was set afire.\n\n[[File:Pandavs Journeying With Their Mother.jpg|thumb|250px|Pandavas' Journeying With Their Mother]]\n\nAfter their flight from the palace, the five brothers lived in the forests for some time disguised as Brahmins. They heard from a group of travelling sages about a contest ([[Swayamvara]]) being held in the Kingdom of Panchala that offered the princess Draupadi's hand in marriage to the winner. The Swayamvara turned out to rely on the skills of archery, and Arjuna, who was a peerless archer, entered the competition and won. When the brothers took Draupadi to introduce her to their mother, they announced to Kunti that they had arrived with excellent alms. Kunti was busy with some work, and replied without turning to look at Draupadi (who was the alms referred to) ordering the brothers to share the alms equally amongst the five of them. Even when uttered erroneously, their mother's word was supreme for the Pandavas, and they agreed to share the princess, who was subsequently married to all five brothers.\n\nWhen Dhritarashtra heard that the five brothers were alive, he invited them back to the kingdom. However, in their absence, Duryodhana had succeeded in being made the crown prince. Upon the return of the Pandavas, the issue of returning Yudhishthira's crown to him was raised. Dhritarashtra led the subsequent discussions into ambiguity and agreed to a partition of the kingdom \"to do justice to both crown princes\". He retained the developed Hastinapur for himself and Duryodhana and gave the barren, arid and hostile lands of [[Khandavaprastha]] to the Pandavas. The Pandavas successfully developed their land and built a great and lavish city, which was considered comparable to the heavens, and thus came to be known as [[Indraprastha]].\n\nReeling under the loss of half the lands of his future kingdom, Duryodhana's jealousy and rage were further fuelled by the Pandavas' success and prosperity. Eventually [[Shakuni]] sired yet another ploy and got Duryodhana to invite the Pandavas over to his court for a game of dice (gambling). Shakuni was a master at gambling and owned a pair of dice which magically did his bidding. Owing to this, bet after bet, Yudhishthira lost all of his wealth, and eventually his kingdom, in the game. He was then enticed by Duryodhana and Shakuni to place his brothers as bets. Yudhishthira fell for it and put his brothers on stake, losing them too. He then placed himself as a bet and lost again. Duryodhana now played another trick and told Yudhishthira that he still had his wife Draupadi to place as a bet and if Yudhishthira won, he would return everything to the Pandavas. Yudhishthira fell for the ruse and bet Draupadi, losing her too. At this point Duryodhana ordered that Draupadi, who was now a slave to him, be brought to the court. None of the Pandavas fought for their wife's honour. Duryodhana's younger brother [[Dushasana]] dragged Draupadi to the royal court, pulling her by her hair, insulting her dignity and asserting that she, like the Pandava brothers, was now their servant. This caused immense anguish to all the great warriors seated in the court, but each of them, namely, [[Bhishma]] (grandsire of the clan), [[Dronacharya]] (teacher/[[guru]] of Kauravas and Pandavas) and [[Kripacharya]] except [[Vidura]] remained silent. Duryodhana then ordered Dushasana to disrobe Draupadi before everyone, as a slave girl has no rights. The elders and warriors in audience were shocked but did not intervene. As Dushasana began to disrobe her, she prayed to God to protect her honour, and Lord Krishna protected her by providing her garments an unending length. Finally, as the blind king Dhritharasthra realised that this humiliation could prompt Draupadi to curse his sons, he intervened, apologising to Draupadi for the behaviour of his sons, and turned the winnings of dice game back over to the Pandava brothers, releasing them from the bondage of slavery.\n\n[[File:Arjuna wins Draupadi.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Arjuna]] shooting at the eye of a fish to win [[Draupadi]] in marriage, [[Kalighat painting]]]]\n\nIncensed at the loss of all that he had won, Duryodhana threatened suicide and coerced his father into inviting the Pandavas for one last round of gambling, the terms of which were that the loser would be condemned to 12 years of exile into forests and a 13th year to be spent incognito, and if the cover be blown during the 13th year, another cycle of 13 years would ensue. Obeying their uncle's orders, the Pandavas played the round and again lost to Shakuni's cheating. However, this time, their patience had been nearly pushed to its edge. During the 12 years of exile in the forest, they prepared for war. Arjuna performed penance and won the entire gamut of celestial weapons (Divyasatras) as boons from the Gods. They spent the 13th year masquerading as peasants in the service of the royal family of [[Virata]], the king of [[Matsya]]. Upon completion of the terms of the last bet, the Pandavas returned and demanded that their kingdom be rightfully returned to them. Duryodhana refused to yield Indraprastha. For the sake of peace and to avert a disastrous war, Krishna proposed that if Hastinapur agrees to give the Pandavas only five villages named Indraprastha ([[Delhi]]), Swarnprastha ([[Sonipat]]), Panprastha ([[Panipat]]), Vyaghrprastha ([[Baghpat]]) and Tilprastha ([[Tilpat]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.naidunia.com/spiritual/vrat-tyohar-geeta-jayanti-2019-had-asked-these-five-villages-from-kauravas-know-about-these-4030796|title=Geeta Jayanti 2019 Pandavas had asked these five villages from Kauravas Know about these|date=2019-12-05|website=Nai Dunia|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qCduAAAAMAAJ&q=five+villages+demanded+by+pandavas&dq=five+villages+demanded+by+pandavas|title=The cities of Delhi|last=Jain|first=Ashok Kumar|date=1994|publisher=Management Pub.

Thus the stage was set for the great war, for which the epic of Mahabharata is known most of all.\n\nThe war was intense and lasted 18 days, over the course of which both parties worked around, bent and even broke rules of warfare. At the end, all 100 Kaurava brothers and their entire army was slain, with only four surviving on their side. The Pandavas too lost several allies but the five brothers survived. After having won the war Yudhishthira was crowned the king.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Death of Pandavas==\n[[File:Yudhisthira with a dog as a chariot from heaven arrive.jpg|thumb|250px|Yudhishthira and his dog ascending to Heaven]]\n\nThe Pandavas ruled Hastinapur for 36 years and established a righteous kingdom. Shortly after the death of Lord Krishna, they all decided that the time had come for them to renounce the world, as the age of [[Kali yuga]] had started.\n\nSo the five Pandavas and Draupadi left to the path of liberation. For this purpose they all climbed [[Mount Kailash]], which leads to the [[Swarga Loka]]. On their way, all except Yudhisthira slipped and died one by one. Yudhisthira was accompanied by a dog who was none other than Lord Yama himself.\n\nThe first to die was Draupadi; she was imperfect because she preferred Arjuna over her other husbands. Then it was Sahadeva, imperfect because he was smug about his knowledge. He was followed by Nakula, imperfect because he was arrogant about his good looks. Then fell Arjuna, imperfect because he was always jealous of other archers. Next was Bhima, imperfect because he was a glutton. Only the eldest Pandava, Yudhisthira, reached the door of Swarga Loka, carried on Lord Indra's chariot. On reaching Heaven he did not find either his virtuous brothers or his wife Draupadi. Instead he saw Karna, Bhishma, Dronacharya etc. and their sons.\n\nHe wanted an explanation from Lord Yama, the lord of death. Lord Yama explained that the Kauravas had been allowed into heaven because they died as warriors on the battlefield. This earned them so much merit and credit that it wiped out all their debts. Yudhisthira demanded to know where his brothers and his wife were. He was then taken to hell. Lord Yama explained that they were experiencing the reactions of their actions but it was temporary. Once the debt had been repaid, they would join them in Swarga. Yudhisthira loyally met his brothers, but the sight and sound of gore and blood horrified him. Though initially he was tempted to flee, he mastered himself and remained after hearing the voices of his beloved brothers and Draupadi calling out to him, asking him to stay with them in their misery. Yudhisthira decided to remain, ordering the divine charioteer to return. He preferred to live in hell with good people than in a heaven of his enemies. Eventually this turned out to be another illusion to test him.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Krishna's help to Pandavas===\n[[File:Wayang Pandawa.jpg|thumb|right|Five Pandavas in [[Wayang]] form. From left to right: [[Bhima]], [[Arjuna]], [[Yudhishthira]], [[Nakula]] and [[Sahadeva]]. [[Indonesia Museum]], Jakarta.]]\n\nKrishna, being a well wisher of the Pandavas, helped them in various ways during the time of their ordeals. When the kurukshetra war was going to be held, both Arjuna on behalf of the Pandavas, and Duryodhan on behalf of the Kauravas, went to Krishna to seek help.\nDuryodhan reached first and Arjuna was just behind him. They entered Krishna's room and found him sleeping. Duryodhan sat on a raised chair near Krishna's head and Arjuna sat near Krishna's feet closing his hands.\nWhen Krishna woke up, he saw Arjuna first and asked him about the purpose of his visit. Then he found Duryodhan sitting next to him, and asked him the same question. Krishna was then told that war was going to be held and Arjuna and Duryodhan had come to him seeking his military help. To this Krishna replied that he had seen Arjuna first and so he would give him priority, and asked what he needed. He gave Arjuna two options - either his one lakh fit and healthy army or Krishna himself who shall not fight in the war. To this Arjuna immediately opted for Krishna for his help and thus Duryodhan was given Krishna's one lakh army. Duryodhan was very satisfied to have received the huge army. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Parents of Pandavas==\n[[File:Kunti Gandhari Dhrtarashtra.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Kunti]] leading [[Gandhari (character)|Gandhari]].

On one occasion, Draupadi was kidnapped and abducted from a hermitage in the forest by the wicked king [[Jayadratha]]. When her husbands learned of the crime, they came in hot pursuit. Seeing them approach, Jayadratha asked Draupadi to describe them. Angrily, Draupadi told the king his time was up and that the knowledge would do him no good. She then proceeded to give the description. (Mahabharat, Book III: Varna Parva, Section 268.)\n\n* According to Draupadi, Yudhishthira possessed a \"complexion like that of pure gold, possessed of a prominent nose and large eyes and endued with a slender make.\" Master of the spear. He was just, had a correct sense of morality and was merciful to surrendering foes. Draupadi counselled Jayadratha to run to Yudhishthira and to beg for forgiveness.\n* Draupadi described Bhima as tall and long-armed. In a display of ferocity, he was \"biting his lips and contracting his forehead so as to bring the two eyebrows together.\" The master of the mace, his superhuman feats had earned him great renown. \"They that offend him are never suffered to live. He never forgets a foe. On some pretext or other he wreaks his vengeance.\"\n* Arjuna she praised as the greatest of archers, intelligent, second to none \"with senses under complete control.\" Neither lust nor fear nor anger could make him forsake virtue. Though capable of withstanding any foe, he would never commit an act of cruelty.\n* Nakula, said Draupadi, was \"the most handsome person in the whole world.\" An accomplished master swordsman, he was also \"versed in every question of morality and profit\" and \"endued with high wisdom.\" He was unflinchingly devoted to his brothers, who in turn regarded him as more valuable than their own lives. The name Nakula generally means full of love and the male characteristics implied by the name are: Intelligence, Focus, Hard-Work, Handsomeness, Health, Attractiveness, Success, Popularity, Respect and unconditional Love.\n* Finally, Sahadeva was the youngest of the brothers and like the others formidable in war and observant of morality.

{"title_page": "Conservation and restoration of stained glass", "text_new": "[[Image:Sainte-chapelle.JPG|thumb|250px|Figure 1 \u2013 Tourists visiting [[Sainte-Chapelle|La Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris, France]]\n'''Stained glass conservation''' refers to the [[protection]] and [[preservation]] of historic [[stained glass]] for present and future generations.  It involves any and all actions devoted to the prevention, [[mitigation]], or reversal of the processes of [[deterioration]] that affect such glass works and subsequently inhibit individuals' ability to access and appreciate them, as part of the world's collective cultural heritage.  It functions as a part of the larger practices of cultural heritage conservation ([[conservation-restoration]]) and [[architectural conservation]].\n\nStained glass is lauded as one of the most beautiful and compelling forms of architectural decoration; however, it is also one of the most vulnerable (Brown et al. 2002, xi).  The fabric of the glass itself, the paint or stain used to decorate it, and even the metal framework used to hold the design together are all at risk for deterioration, and will likely require conservation work to ensure their long-term survival. Historic [[glazing (window)|glazing]] is subject to damage caused by continued exposure to [[pollution]] and the elements, on top of that resulting from inherent problems, such as the innate fragility of glass and any potential chemical instability of the materials involved (Brown et al. 2002, xi; Rauch 2004).  Deterioration does not always occur gradually and may also occur suddenly and catastrophically, as the result of [[natural disasters]] (e.g. fire, extreme weather), accidents (e.g. improper handling, removal or treatment), or malicious damage (e.g. vandalism) (Brown et al. 2002, xi; Vogel et al. 2007).\n\nOwing to the delicate nature of the materials, and the incalculable historic and [[aesthetic]] value of stained glass work, any and all treatments should be planned and performed by professional conservators and craftspeople, who have been specially trained in the peculiarities of the medium.  While preservation is the shared responsibility of all involved, including visitors, caretakers, and other stakeholders, it is imperative that professionals are consulted to ensure the continued integrity of the physical materials and their associated significance.  For this reason, all projects should begin with a conservation plan that incorporates research in such topics as the history of the windows or building, the materials involved, and past alterations, as a key element of all conservation decisions.  The type of conservation treatment employed should reflect this research, as well as the needs of the building as a whole, and should ''always'' be documented for reference in the future (CVMA 2004).\n\nFor information on the creation, construction, and history of stained glass windows see [[Stained glass]].\n\n==Deterioration of stained glass==\n\nThe primary aim of conservation is to slow the rate of deterioration, caused by various factors, to the point where the loss of significance, such as historic information and/or aesthetic value can be kept to a minimum (Pye 2001, Ch. 5).  However, in the case of stained glass, these efforts are complicated by the nature of the medium itself.  This is because a stained-glass window is a 'complex object' in that it is made from more than one component material, each with its own inherent risks and conservation needs (Pye 2001, 80).  In addition to the most obvious component, glass, all windows will typically involve some sort paint or stain as decoration, metal strips, or 'cames' used to join the pieces of glass together, waterproofing materials, and fixing systems or frameworks used for additional support (Brown et al. 2002; Vogel et al. 2007). The condition of each component is important for the overall preservation of the window, as deterioration within one material can affect the others with varying degrees of severity.\n\n===Causes===\n\nThe vast majority of stained glass was originally created to function as part of the building envelope, separating the interior of the structure from exterior environmental conditions.  As a result, most historic glazing that has been left in situ is subjected to a constant onslaught of harmful conditions including (but not limited to): UV light from sunlight, extreme weather conditions, indoor and outdoor man-made pollution, and biological damage caused by pests such as pigeons, bats, and various [[micro-organisms]] (Rauch 2004, 3).  As a result, panels often become encrusted with thick layers of dirt that eventually become quite firmly affixed, and can even begin to intermingle with the underlying, corroded layers of paint (Rauch 2004, 3).  Environmental influences also play a role in the continuing deterioration of metal cames and frameworks, which can cause significant structural damage. In addition to these environmental stressors, further deterioration can also result from the myriad of other factors that influence the materials out of which the window is constructed, such as vibration from building use and the remains of previous treatments and repairs that have since deteriorated and increased the corrosion processes of other materials (Rauch 2004, 3).\n\n===Deterioration of the glass===\n[[File:Glass trinity church.JPG|thumb|200px|Figure 2 \u2013 Faded faces on a panel form Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon, UK.]]\nAlthough glass as a material is known for its chemical stability resistance to natural deterioration, impurities, and variations in glass composition can cause considerable chemical instability that may further destructive processes (Vogel et al. 2007, 7).  Glass is also susceptible to atmospheric pollution, and high levels of humidity or moisture over long periods of time, both of which can speed up the corrosion rate of chemically unstable glass.  Over time, corrosion, marked by pitting or pocking of the glass, can deepen and spread until the surface layer itself breaks apart, uncovering the vulnerable, damaged core, until it becomes opaque (Rauch 2004, 3).  This opacification occurs as water seeps through the subsequent cracks, causing the formation of opaque syngenite and gypsum crystals that block light from filtering through the previously translucent glass (Rauch 2004, 3).  As these crystals continue to grow, they pose an even greater danger to the glass, eventually breaking through the surface and dislodging the delicate paint layer, or even causing cracks (Rauch 2004, 4).  Glass plates can also darken or cloud as the result of the oxidisation of certain metals, such as manganese, which was a common addition to late medieval glass (Rauch 2004, 4).\n\n===Breakdown of paints, enamels, stains===\n\nAs previously mentioned, the paint/stain layer may suffer as the result of deterioration within the fabric of the glass itself; however, this fragile layer is at risk for other types of damage as well.  Painted surfaces that would have been applied to glass cold and fired on, are especially vulnerable to damage from condensation or weathering if they were fired improperly during the production process (Vogel 2007, 7).  This is often the case with the fading or disappearance of fine detail, such as faces, in figural stained glass art (fig. 2). Over time, enamels can begin to flake off of glass panels, and certain types or colours of stains can discolour with continued UV exposure, all of which significantly alters the aesthetic impact of the work as a whole (Brown et al. 2002, 18\u201319; Vogel et al. 2007, 7).\n\n===Structural deformation and deterioration===\n[[File:Clerestory trinity church.JPG|thumb|200px|Figure 3 \u2013 The leaded clerestory windows of Holy Trinity Church have been weakened by time and the elements.]]\nThe breakdown of the skeletal structure that holds the glass in place, such as damage to tracery and the corrosion of metal cames and fixing systems, often poses the greatest, imminent risk to stained glass work (Vogel et al. 2007, 7).  Although stone elements are not prone to excessive change due to environmental conditions, this is not the case with metals, which are much more likely to deteriorate from prolonged exposure to the elements.  For example, the cames that make up the matrix of a stained-glass window, for which lead and zinc were most commonly used, undergo quite a bit of thermal expansion and contraction, eventually resulting in metal fatigue, which in turn weakens the joints between the plates, causing whole panels to deform or simply fall apart (Vogel et al. 2007, 8).  Additionally, metal matrixes and frames may weaken with stress, such as that which has occurred at Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon, UK, where years of wind buffeting the leaded clerestory windows has endangered the structural integrity of not only the glazing but also, the upper portion of building itself (fig. 3) (Friends of Shakespeare's Church 2009).\n\n==Creating a conservation plan==\n\nIn many ways, proper conservation is as much about research and documentation as it is about 'hands-on' conservation treatments and restoration (Sloan 1993, 27).  The conservator must be familiar with not only the general materials with which he or she is working but also the details specific to the project at hand, in order to understand and address the needs of a particular window or building.  Using this knowledge, conservators can develop a conservation plan that can be used throughout the project, to ensure that all decisions are made with the aims of the project and the needs of the object in mind (CVMA 2004).\n\n===Basic conservation philosophy===\n\nIn J. Sloan's discussion of stained glass conservation in the United States, the author gives the following list of ethical and philosophical criteria to be applied to the conservation of stained glass (Sloan 1993, 13):\n<blockquote>\n# All materials and procedures should be reversible without affecting the piece ... .\n# All intervention must be the least required to achieve the desired end.\n# Original materials should be retained so far as is possible.\n# All conditions, procedures, materials and processes must be recorded.\n# The hand or style of the conservator should not be visible to the casual observer on the object.  However, all restoration should be discernable to future conservators.\n# The conservator is ethically bound to provide the highest quality restoration within his [or her] power without regard for his [or her] personal opinion of the value ... of the object.\n</blockquote>\n\nWhile this list is not exhaustive, it does illustrate the basic foundations upon which responsible conservation decisions should be made.  Of utmost importance in this list are the fundamental ideas of minimal intervention and reversibility of treatment, both of which are necessary to ensure that the overall integrity of the windows, as historic and artistically valuable objects, is not compromised.\n\n===Research===\n\nOwing to the incredible amount of chemical and methodological variability to be found when dealing with stained glass, research into the general production habits of pertinent regions or eras may provide clues that can help conservators understand the overall significance of the piece, anticipate what to expect from the materials, and determine how to proceed (Sloan 1993, 28; Vogel 2007, 5).  For example, a conservator working on a set of windows in the United States, will want to ascertain whether the glass was produced before, during, or after the mid-19th century, as changes to general glass composition were made during this time that could influence the types of impurities\u2014and subsequently, some of the deterioration\u2014to be expected (Vogel et al. 2007, 7).  This research phase should also include a full condition report on the current condition of the stained glass that includes a record of any and all evidence of past intervention or repair (CVMA 2004).\n\n===Decision making and implementation===\n\nDecisions should be made using the information gathered during research, and implemented by experienced conservators.  Caretakers and project managers should be responsible for screening conservators/studios effectively, while the conservators themselves are responsible for advocating on behalf of the stained glass during any negotiations.  As much as possible, benefit to the historic glazing should come before all other considerations (Vogel et al. 2007, 1).  At all stages, steps should be taken to ensure that the actions taken are in keeping with the aims of the conservation plan.\n\n===Documentation===\n\nProper documentation plays an extremely important role throughout this entire process and should be considered obligatory.  All aspects of this process including preliminary research, condition surveys, conservation plans, and all the methods and materials used throughout treatment should be duly recorded, and the documents be preserved and made accessible in the long-term for future reference (CVMA 2004).\n\n==Types of treatments==\n\nIn general, it is best to keep interventive treatments at a minimum: minor signs of age are an integral part of the character of the structure and its history (Pye 2001, 96; Vogel et al. 2007, 9).  However, more serious damage that either detracts from the aesthetic or practical functions of the glass, or indicates active deterioration may require more extensive treatment.\n[[File:Glass notre dame paris.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Figure 4 \u2013 The linear shadow from a protective grill on a panel at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France.]]\n\n===Cleaning===\n\nCareful cleaning of stained glass can be a very effective means of improving its overall condition because its appearance and function are so heavily dependent on its ability to transmit light.  Unfortunately, owing to the fragility of corroded glass, nearly all cleaning treatments can cause changes in the surface of the glass that can expedite corrosion rates, or damage delicate paint layers (Romich et al. 2000).  Thus, cleaning efforts should not necessarily be concerned with the complete removal of all encrustrations, but rather the careful thinning of these layers to a point where light can be transmitted through the glass at an acceptable level (Rauch 2004, 5).  The simplest cleaning can be performed using carefully applied deionised water, although other mechanical or chemical means are often necessary, and must always be done slowly, in a controlled and focused manner (Rauch 2004, 5\u20136; Vogel et al. 2007, 9\u201310).  Scalpels or a micro-jet process* can be used to gradually, mechanically thin out these encrustations layer by layer, in the lab.  Conversely, poultices or gel pads steeped in a non-ionic detergent or EDTA can be applied to the surface of the glass for long periods of time for \u201cdeep, focused cleaning\u201d (Rauch 2004, 6).  With any of these methods, care must be taken to ensure the stability of painted layers, before treatment can take place.  In the event that these layers appear particularly friable, it is necessary to clean the glass delicately with cotton swabs, and in more extreme cases, manually affix the original paint lines to the surface, under a microscope, by applying small tiny drops of resin at specific points (Rauch 2004, 6; Vogel et al. 2007, 10).  Care should be taken not to remove any later over-painting without due consideration, as such layers may have historic value, in their own right (Rauch 2004, 7).\n\n===Repairs and replacements===\n\nWithin conservation, repairs are meant to last, but should also be as reversible as possible, in keeping with the general ethical guidelines of modern conservation practice (Sloane 1993, 13).  In the context of stained glass, repairs can involve treatment of the glass itself, treatment of missing areas, or structural consolidation of the matrix or surrounding architectural fabric.\n\nBroken glass is typically repaired in one of three ways: copper foiling (thin copper tape that is applied to both sides of the break and then soldered); epoxy edge-gluing; and silicone edge-gluing.  Each of these has its own inherent benefits and problems.  For instance, copper foiling produces a strong, reversible, attractive repair, but is unsuitable for use with unstable glass because of the heat involved in the application process.  Epoxy edge-gluing on the other hand is strong and nearly invisible, but deteriorates in direct sunlight, while silicone edge-gluing dries clear and is easily reversible, but unfortunately refracts light differently from glass, making such repairs more readily apparent (Vogel et al. 2007, 12).\n\nMissing areas can be filled or replaced but should be done so with caution.  All additions must be marked as such, and documented.  Ultimately, \u201cit is nearly always better to use an imperfect original piece of glass than to replace it\u201d (Vogel et al. 2007, 12).  Modern replacement of glass with \u201cexact\u201d replicas is virtually impossible, and goes against conservation philosophy by potentially clouding viewers' perception of the original.  Instead it is preferable to use similarly coloured, but clearly differentiated glass in order to preserve the aesthetic effect of the stained glass without sacrificing the integrity of the original (Rauch 2004, 7; Vogel et al. 2007, 11).\n\nStructurally speaking it is most important to keep the frame intact and in good condition, to ensure the overall safety of the window (Vogel et al. 2007, 10).  That being said, the original materials that make up this matrix are also integral aspects of the historic value and artistic design of the panel and should be preserved.  Steps should always be taken to ensure that panels retain their current matrix whenever possible, rather than opting for replacement (CVMA 2004).\n\n===Protective glazing===\n\n[[File:Protective grill.JPG|thumb|200px|Figure 5 \u2013 A protective grill on the gothic-style windows of a chapel in London, UK.]]\nProtective glazing is one of the few ways conservators can attempt to preventively conserve stained glass in situ.  While this practice can offer many benefits, as with most other treatments, it is not without drawbacks.  Ideally, the installation of protective glazing can \u201crelieve the stained glass of its function as a weather shield [\u2026], protect it against mechanical and atmospheric damage, and [\u2026] prevent condensation on the surface of the stained glass,\u201d thus minimising the need for interventive conservation (CVMA 2004). Unfortunately, in practice this is not always the case, and it is well known that unsuitable, or improperly ventilated protective glazing can actually create an overly hot or humid microclimate around the historic glass that increases the rate of deterioration (Vogel et al. 2007, 13).  Alternatively, protective screens or grills can be installed on the exterior of windows to prevent mechanical damage like vandalism, however this can have a significant, negative impact on the aesthetic value of the windows from both the exterior and interior (figs. 4\u20135).\n\n==Other options and considerations==\n[[File:Conservation yorkminster.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Figure 6 \u2013 A view of the conservation-related scaffolding around the east end of York Minster, York, UK.]]\nIn some cases, a project may be so extensive that it requires the complete removal of a panel, or set of panels from public view, which in turn raises other considerations concerning public access.  An excellent example of such a case is the current, on-going project to conserve York Minster funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF), which raises the question: how do conservators accommodate the needs of the living, functioning Minster, without compromising conservation goals (fig. 6) (Rosewell 2008a)?  [[File:Windowreplica yorkminster.JPG|thumb|150px|Figure 7 \u2013 A digitally produced replica of the Great East Window of York Minster.]] For instance, upon the removal of the Great East Window from public view (for up to ten years), a solution was needed to combat the sudden gloom of the Minster's interior.  Ultimately, a remarkable life-sized, digital replica was produced to brighten the \u201cvisual 'black hole' that remains\u201d while conservation work is taking place, thus facilitating the aims of conservators by minimising the detrimental effects of losing the visual impact window on the interior (fig. 7) (Rosewell 2008b).  This is not the first time that York Minster has employed a variety of methods to maintain and increase public access while also facilitating the conservation of its stained glass legacy.  Currently, conserved sections of panels that have been permanently removed from their original context due to conservation concerns can be viewed on display near the choir (fig. 8).  Although it is rare that a perfect solution to these concerns can be found, it is a necessary part of conservation planning to take public interest and access into consideration.

It involves any and all actions devoted to the prevention, [[mitigation]], or reversal of the processes of [[deterioration]] that affect such glass works and subsequently inhibit individuals' ability to access and appreciate them, as part of the world's collective cultural heritage.  It functions as a part of the larger practices of cultural heritage conservation ([[conservation-restoration]]) and [[architectural conservation]].\n\nStained glass is lauded as one of the most beautiful and compelling forms of architectural decoration; however, it is also one of the most vulnerable (Brown et al. 2002, xi).  The fabric of the glass itself, the paint or stain used to decorate it, and even the metal framework used to hold the design together are all at risk for deterioration, and will likely require conservation work to ensure their long-term survival. Historic [[glazing (window)|glazing]] is subject to damage caused by continued exposure to [[pollution]] and the elements, on top of that resulting from inherent problems, such as the innate fragility of glass and any potential chemical instability of the materials involved (Brown et al. 2002, xi; Rauch 2004).  Deterioration does not always occur gradually and may also occur suddenly and catastrophically, as the result of [[natural disasters]] (e.g. fire, extreme weather), accidents (e.g. improper handling, removal or treatment), or malicious damage (e.g. vandalism) (Brown et al. 2002, xi; Vogel et al. 2007).\n\nOwing to the delicate nature of the materials, and the incalculable historic and [[aesthetic]] value of stained glass work, any and all treatments should be planned and performed by professional conservators and craftspeople, who have been specially trained in the peculiarities of the medium.  While preservation is the shared responsibility of all involved, including visitors, caretakers, and other stakeholders, it is imperative that professionals are consulted to ensure the continued integrity of the physical materials and their associated significance.  For this reason, all projects should begin with a conservation plan that incorporates research in such topics as the history of the windows or building, the materials involved, and past alterations, as a key element of all conservation decisions.  The type of conservation treatment employed should reflect this research, as well as the needs of the building as a whole, and should ''always'' be documented for reference in the future (CVMA 2004).\n\nFor information on the creation, construction, and history of stained glass windows see [[Stained glass]].\n\n==Deterioration of stained glass==\n\nThe primary aim of conservation is to slow the rate of deterioration, caused by various factors, to the point where the loss of significance, such as historic information and/or aesthetic value can be kept to a minimum (Pye 2001, Ch. 5).  However, in the case of stained glass, these efforts are complicated by the nature of the medium itself.  This is because a stained-glass window is a 'complex object' in that it is made from more than one component material, each with its own inherent risks and conservation needs (Pye 2001, 80).  In addition to the most obvious component, glass, all windows will typically involve some sort paint or stain as decoration, metal strips, or 'cames' used to join the pieces of glass together, waterproofing materials, and fixing systems or frameworks used for additional support (Brown et al. 2002; Vogel et al. 2007). The condition of each component is important for the overall preservation of the window, as deterioration within one material can affect the others with varying degrees of severity.\n\n===Causes===\n\nThe vast majority of stained glass was originally created to function as part of the building envelope, separating the interior of the structure from exterior environmental conditions.  As a result, most historic glazing that has been left in situ is subjected to a constant onslaught of harmful conditions including (but not limited to): UV light from sunlight, extreme weather conditions, indoor and outdoor man-made pollution, and biological damage caused by pests such as pigeons, bats, and various [[micro-organisms]] (Rauch 2004, 3).  As a result, panels often become encrusted with thick layers of dirt that eventually become quite firmly affixed, and can even begin to intermingle with the underlying, corroded layers of paint (Rauch 2004, 3).  Environmental influences also play a role in the continuing deterioration of metal cames and frameworks, which can cause significant structural damage. In addition to these environmental stressors, further deterioration can also result from the myriad of other factors that influence the materials out of which the window is constructed, such as vibration from building use and the remains of previous treatments and repairs that have since deteriorated and increased the corrosion processes of other materials (Rauch 2004, 3).\n\n===Deterioration of the glass===\n[[File:Glass trinity church.JPG|thumb|200px|Figure 2 \u2013 Faded faces on a panel form Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon, UK.]]\nAlthough glass as a material is known for its chemical stability resistance to natural deterioration, impurities, and variations in glass composition can cause considerable chemical instability that may further destructive processes (Vogel et al. 2007, 7).  Glass is also susceptible to atmospheric pollution, and high levels of humidity or moisture over long periods of time, both of which can speed up the corrosion rate of chemically unstable glass.  Over time, corrosion, marked by pitting or pocking of the glass, can deepen and spread until the surface layer itself breaks apart, uncovering the vulnerable, damaged core, until it becomes opaque (Rauch 2004, 3).  This opacification occurs as water seeps through the subsequent cracks, causing the formation of opaque syngenite and gypsum crystals that block light from filtering through the previously translucent glass (Rauch 2004, 3).  As these crystals continue to grow, they pose an even greater danger to the glass, eventually breaking through the surface and dislodging the delicate paint layer, or even causing cracks (Rauch 2004, 4).  Glass plates can also darken or cloud as the result of the oxidisation of certain metals, such as manganese, which was a common addition to late medieval glass (Rauch 2004, 4).\n\n===Breakdown of paints, enamels, stains===\n\nAs previously mentioned, the paint/stain layer may suffer as the result of deterioration within the fabric of the glass itself; however, this fragile layer is at risk for other types of damage as well.  Painted surfaces that would have been applied to glass cold and fired on, are especially vulnerable to damage from condensation or weathering if they were fired improperly during the production process (Vogel 2007, 7).  This is often the case with the fading or disappearance of fine detail, such as faces, in figural stained glass art (fig. 2). Over time, enamels can begin to flake off of glass panels, and certain types or colours of stains can discolour with continued UV exposure, all of which significantly alters the aesthetic impact of the work as a whole (Brown et al. 2002, 18\u201319; Vogel et al. 2007, 7).\n\n===Structural deformation and deterioration===\n[[File:Clerestory trinity church.JPG|thumb|200px|Figure 3 \u2013 The leaded clerestory windows of Holy Trinity Church have been weakened by time and the elements.]]\nThe breakdown of the skeletal structure that holds the glass in place, such as damage to tracery and the corrosion of metal cames and fixing systems, often poses the greatest, imminent risk to stained glass work (Vogel et al. 2007, 7).  Although stone elements are not prone to excessive change due to environmental conditions, this is not the case with metals, which are much more likely to deteriorate from prolonged exposure to the elements.  For example, the cames that make up the matrix of a stained-glass window, for which lead and zinc were most commonly used, undergo quite a bit of thermal expansion and contraction, eventually resulting in metal fatigue, which in turn weakens the joints between the plates, causing whole panels to deform or simply fall apart (Vogel et al. 2007, 8).  Additionally, metal matrixes and frames may weaken with stress, such as that which has occurred at Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon, UK, where years of wind buffeting the leaded clerestory windows has endangered the structural integrity of not only the glazing but also, the upper portion of building itself (fig. 3) (Friends of Shakespeare's Church 2009).\n\n==Creating a conservation plan==\n\nIn many ways, proper conservation is as much about research and documentation as it is about 'hands-on' conservation treatments and restoration (Sloan 1993, 27).  The conservator must be familiar with not only the general materials with which he or she is working but also the details specific to the project at hand, in order to understand and address the needs of a particular window or building.  Using this knowledge, conservators can develop a conservation plan that can be used throughout the project, to ensure that all decisions are made with the aims of the project and the needs of the object in mind (CVMA 2004).\n\n===Basic conservation philosophy===\n\nIn J. Sloan's discussion of stained glass conservation in the United States, the author gives the following list of ethical and philosophical criteria to be applied to the conservation of stained glass (Sloan 1993, 13):\n<blockquote>\n# All materials and procedures should be reversible without affecting the piece ... .\n# All intervention must be the least required to achieve the desired end.\n# Original materials should be retained so far as is possible.\n# All conditions, procedures, materials and processes must be recorded.\n# The hand or style of the conservator should not be visible to the casual observer on the object.  However, all restoration should be discernable to future conservators.\n# The conservator is ethically bound to provide the highest quality restoration within his [or her] power without regard for his [or her] personal opinion of the value ... of the object.\n</blockquote>\n\nWhile this list is not exhaustive, it does illustrate the basic foundations upon which responsible conservation decisions should be made.  Of utmost importance in this list are the fundamental ideas of minimal intervention and reversibility of treatment, both of which are necessary to ensure that the overall integrity of the windows, as historic and artistically valuable objects, is not compromised.\n\n===Research===\n\nOwing to the incredible amount of chemical and methodological variability to be found when dealing with stained glass, research into the general production habits of pertinent regions or eras may provide clues that can help conservators understand the overall significance of the piece, anticipate what to expect from the materials, and determine how to proceed (Sloan 1993, 28; Vogel 2007, 5).  For example, a conservator working on a set of windows in the United States, will want to ascertain whether the glass was produced before, during, or after the mid-19th century, as changes to general glass composition were made during this time that could influence the types of impurities\u2014and subsequently, some of the deterioration\u2014to be expected (Vogel et al. 2007, 7).  This research phase should also include a full condition report on the current condition of the stained glass that includes a record of any and all evidence of past intervention or repair (CVMA 2004).\n\n===Decision making and implementation===\n\nDecisions should be made using the information gathered during research, and implemented by experienced conservators.  Caretakers and project managers should be responsible for screening conservators/studios effectively, while the conservators themselves are responsible for advocating on behalf of the stained glass during any negotiations.  As much as possible, benefit to the historic glazing should come before all other considerations (Vogel et al. 2007, 1).  At all stages, steps should be taken to ensure that the actions taken are in keeping with the aims of the conservation plan.\n\n===Documentation===\n\nProper documentation plays an extremely important role throughout this entire process and should be considered obligatory.  All aspects of this process including preliminary research, condition surveys, conservation plans, and all the methods and materials used throughout treatment should be duly recorded, and the documents be preserved and made accessible in the long-term for future reference (CVMA 2004).\n\n==Types of treatments==\n\nIn general it is best to keep interventive treatments at a minimum: minor signs of age are an integral part of the character of the structure and its history (Pye 2001, 96; Vogel et al. 2007, 9).  However, more serious damage that either detracts from the aesthetic or practical functions of the glass, or indicates active deterioration may require more extensive treatment.\n[[File:Glass notre dame paris.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Figure 4 \u2013 The linear shadow from a protective grill on a panel at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France.]]\n\n===Cleaning===\n\nCareful cleaning of stained glass can be a very effective means of improving its overall condition, because its appearance and function are so heavily dependent on its ability to transmit light.  Unfortunately, owing to the fragility of corroded glass, nearly all cleaning treatments can cause changes in the surface of the glass that can expedite corrosion rates, or damage delicate paint layers (Romich et al. 2000).  Thus, cleaning efforts should not necessarily be concerned with the complete removal of all encrustrations, but rather the careful thinning of these layers to a point where light can be transmitted through the glass at an acceptable level (Rauch 2004, 5).  The simplest cleaning can be performed using carefully applied deionised water, although other mechanical or chemical means are often necessary, and must always be done slowly, in a controlled and focused manner (Rauch 2004, 5\u20136; Vogel et al. 2007, 9\u201310).  Scalpels or a micro-jet process* can be used to gradually, mechanically thin out these encrustations layer by layer, in the lab.  Conversely, poultices or gel pads steeped in a non-ionic detergent or EDTA can be applied to the surface of the glass for long periods of time for \u201cdeep, focused cleaning\u201d (Rauch 2004, 6).  With any of these methods, care must be taken to ensure the stability of painted layers, before treatment can take place.  In the event that these layers appear particularly friable, it is necessary to clean the glass delicately with cotton swabs, and in more extreme cases, manually affix the original paint lines to the surface, under a microscope, by applying small tiny drops of resin at specific points (Rauch 2004, 6; Vogel et al. 2007, 10).  Care should be taken not to remove any later over-painting without due consideration, as such layers may have historic value, in their own right (Rauch 2004, 7).\n\n===Repairs and replacements===\n\nWithin conservation, repairs are meant to last, but should also be as reversible as possible, in keeping with the general ethical guidelines of modern conservation practice (Sloane 1993, 13).  In the context of stained glass, repairs can involve treatment of the glass itself, treatment of missing areas, or structural consolidation of the matrix or surrounding architectural fabric.\n\nBroken glass is typically repaired in one of three ways: copper foiling (thin copper tape that is applied to both sides of the break and then soldered); epoxy edge-gluing; and silicone edge-gluing.  Each of these has its own inherent benefits and problems.  For instance, copper foiling produces a strong, reversible, attractive repair, but is unsuitable for use with unstable glass because of the heat involved in the application process.  Epoxy edge-gluing on the other hand is strong and nearly invisible, but deteriorates in direct sunlight, while silicone edge-gluing dries clear and is easily reversible, but unfortunately refracts light differently from glass, making such repairs more readily apparent (Vogel et al. 2007, 12).\n\nMissing areas can be filled or replaced but should be done so with caution.  All additions must be marked as such, and documented.  Ultimately, \u201cit is nearly always better to use an imperfect original piece of glass than to replace it\u201d (Vogel et al. 2007, 12).  Modern replacement of glass with \u201cexact\u201d replicas is virtually impossible, and goes against conservation philosophy by potentially clouding viewers' perception of the original.  Instead it is preferable to use similarly coloured, but clearly differentiated glass in order to preserve the aesthetic effect of the stained glass without sacrificing the integrity of the original (Rauch 2004, 7; Vogel et al. 2007, 11).\n\nStructurally speaking it is most important to keep the frame intact and in good condition, to ensure the overall safety of the window (Vogel et al. 2007, 10).  That being said, the original materials that make up this matrix are also integral aspects of the historic value and artistic design of the panel and should be preserved.  Steps should always be taken to ensure that panels retain their current matrix whenever possible, rather than opting for replacement (CVMA 2004).\n\n===Protective glazing===\n\n[[File:Protective grill.JPG|thumb|200px|Figure 5 \u2013 A protective grill on the gothic-style windows of a chapel in London, UK.]]\nProtective glazing is one of the few ways conservators can attempt to preventively conserve stained glass in situ.  While this practice can offer many benefits, as with most other treatments, it is not without drawbacks.  Ideally, the installation of protective glazing can \u201crelieve the stained glass of its function as a weather shield [\u2026], protect it against mechanical and atmospheric damage, and [\u2026] prevent condensation on the surface of the stained glass,\u201d thus minimising the need for interventive conservation (CVMA 2004). Unfortunately, in practice this is not always the case, and it is well known that unsuitable, or improperly ventilated protective glazing can actually create an overly hot or humid microclimate around the historic glass that increases the rate of deterioration (Vogel et al. 2007, 13).  Alternatively, protective screens or grills can be installed on the exterior of windows to prevent mechanical damage like vandalism, however this can have a significant, negative impact on the aesthetic value of the windows from both the exterior and interior (figs. 4\u20135).\n\n==Other options and considerations==\n[[File:Conservation yorkminster.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Figure 6 \u2013 A view of the conservation-related scaffolding around the east end of York Minster, York, UK.]]\nIn some cases, a project may be so extensive that it requires the complete removal of a panel, or set of panels from public view, which in turn raises other considerations concerning public access.  An excellent example of such a case is the current, on-going project to conserve York Minster funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF), which raises the question: how do conservators accommodate the needs of the living, functioning Minster, without compromising conservation goals (fig. 6) (Rosewell 2008a)?  [[File:Windowreplica yorkminster.JPG|thumb|150px|Figure 7 \u2013 A digitally produced replica of the Great East Window of York Minster.]] For instance, upon the removal of the Great East Window from public view (for up to ten years), a solution was needed to combat the sudden gloom of the Minster's interior.  Ultimately, a remarkable life-sized, digital replica was produced to brighten the \u201cvisual 'black hole' that remains\u201d while conservation work is taking place, thus facilitating the aims of conservators by minimising the detrimental effects of losing the visual impact window on the interior (fig. 7) (Rosewell 2008b).  This is not the first time that York Minster has employed a variety of methods to maintain and increase public access while also facilitating the conservation of its stained glass legacy.  Currently, conserved sections of panels that have been permanently removed from their original context due to conservation concerns can be viewed on display near the choir (fig. 8).  Although it is rare that a perfect solution to these concerns can be found, it is a necessary part of conservation planning to take public interest and access into consideration.
