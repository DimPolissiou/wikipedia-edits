The second scheme involved a market manipulation involving the shares of KIT Digital (KITD). Maiden, at the request of Tuzman and Amanat, had driven up the price of KITD's shares when the company was seeking to raise money and shortly before the shares were listed on NASDAQ. The third scheme involved an accounting fraud that took place over a two-year period beginning in 2010. This scheme, designed to fraudulently inflate the revenue of KITD, involved the use of improper revenue recognition and sham round trip transactions.<ref name=\"this week\"/> KIT Digital filed for bankruptcy in 2013 and is now known as Piksel, Inc.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-08/kit-digital-s-tuzman-and-smyth-arrested-in-accounting-fraud |title=Kit Digital Ex-Chief Tuzman Charged With Accounting Fraud |work=Bloomberg Business |date=September 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://pagesix.com/2017/12/26/omar-amanat-found-guilty-of-defrauding-startup/ |title=Omar Amanat found guilty of defrauding startup |publisher=PageSix|date=26 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nFollowing his arrest, Tuzman was held in ''La Picota'' prison in [[Bogot\u00e1]], awaiting extradition. The conditions at ''La Picota'' prompted his legal team to file a complaint with the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights (part of the [[Organization of American States]]), which was signed by over 150 other inmates citing numerous abuses such as lack of medical care, lack of running water, extortion, etc. The complaint has been acknowledged by the Commission and has resulted in an investigation into the Colombian prison system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.noticiascaracol.com/colombia/extraditables-recluidos-en-la-picota-se-quejaron-por-sus-condiciones-ante-cidh |title=Extraditables recluidos en La Picota se quejaron por sus condiciones ante CIDH |work=Caracol News |date=January 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nHe was extradited to the United States, and at his bail hearing in July 2016, Tuzman claimed to have few assets left and significant liabilities, but prosecutors noted that Tuzman was wearing a $70,000 watch and the judge doubled his bail to $5 million.<ref>[http://www.telegram.com/news/20160716/70000-watch-costs-businessman-accused-extra-25m-in-bail \"$70,000 watch costs businessman accused extra $2.5M in bail\"]</ref> Tuzman's trial for 20 charges of fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, false statements in SEC reports, and manipulative and deceptive practices,<ref name=\"USA v.

[https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/this-week-in-securities-litigation-35975/]</ref> First, with respect to Maiden Capital, between February 2009 and June 2012 Amanat and others carried out a scheme to conceal the fact that firm clients suffered losses from an investment in Enable Invest Ltd, a hedge fund run by Amanat's brother for which he had raised capital using a series of misrepresentations. The second scheme involved a market manipulation involving the shares of KIT Digital (KITD). Maiden, at the request of Tuzman and Amanat, had driven up the price of KITD's shares when the company was seeking to raise money and shortly before the shares were listed on NASDAQ. The third scheme involved an accounting fraud that took place over a two-year period beginning in 2010. This scheme, designed to fraudulently inflate the revenue of KITD, involved the use of improper revenue recognition and sham round trip transactions.<ref name=\"this week\"/> KIT Digital filed for bankruptcy in 2013 and is now known as Piksel, Inc.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-08/kit-digital-s-tuzman-and-smyth-arrested-in-accounting-fraud |title=Kit Digital Ex-Chief Tuzman Charged With Accounting Fraud |work=Bloomberg Business |date=September 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://pagesix.com/2017/12/26/omar-amanat-found-guilty-of-defrauding-startup/ |title=Omar Amanat found guilty of defrauding startup |publisher=PageSix|date=26 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nFollowing his arrest, Tuzman was held in ''La Picota'' prison in [[Bogot\u00e1]], awaiting extradition. The conditions at ''La Picota'' prompted his legal team to file a complaint with the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights (part of the [[Organization of American States]]), which was signed by over 150 other inmates citing numerous abuses such as lack of medical care, lack of running water, extortion, etc. The complaint has been acknowledged by the Commission and has resulted in an investigation into the Colombian prison system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.noticiascaracol.com/colombia/extraditables-recluidos-en-la-picota-se-quejaron-por-sus-condiciones-ante-cidh |title=Extraditables recluidos en La Picota se quejaron por sus condiciones ante CIDH |work=Caracol News |date=January 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nHe was extradited to the United States, and at his bail hearing in July 2016, Tuzman claimed to have few assets left and significant liabilities, but prosecutors noted that Tuzman was wearing a $70,000 watch and the judge doubled his bail to $5 million.<ref>[http://www.telegram.com/news/20160716/70000-watch-costs-businessman-accused-extra-25m-in-bail \"$70,000 watch costs businessman accused extra $2.5M in bail\"]</ref> Tuzman's trial for 20 charges of fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, false statements in SEC reports, and manipulative and deceptive practices,<ref name=\"USA v.

Her debut single, \"[[Inside Your Heaven]]\", made her the only country artist to debut at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and the only solo country artist in the 2000s to have a number-one song on the Hot 100. Her debut album, ''[[Some Hearts]]'' (2005), was bolstered by the huge [[Crossover music|crossover]] success of the singles \"[[Jesus, Take the Wheel]]\" and \"[[Before He Cheats]]\", becoming the best-selling solo female debut album in country music history, the fastest-selling debut country album in [[Nielsen SoundScan]] history and the best-selling country album of the last 17 years. Underwood won three [[Grammy Awards]] for the album, including [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]].\n\nHer second album, ''[[Carnival Ride]]'', followed in 2007. It had one of the biggest opening weeks of all time by a female artist and won two Grammy Awards.

Underwood's fourth album, ''[[Blown Away (album)|Blown Away]]'' (2012), earned her a Grammy Award and was that year's second best-selling release by a female artist. Her first compilation album, ''[[Greatest Hits: Decade Number 1|Greatest Hits: Decade #1]]'' (2014), was a chart and sales success that spawned the Grammy Award-winning crossover single \"[[Something in the Water (Carrie Underwood song)|Something in the Water]]\". Her fifth album, ''[[Storyteller (Carrie Underwood album)|Storyteller]]'' (2015), made her the only country artist to have all first five studio albums reach either numbers one or two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. With her sixth album, ''[[Cry Pretty]]'' (2018), she became the only woman to top the ''Billboard'' 200 with four country albums, and had both the biggest week for any album by a woman in 2018 and the best-selling solo female album of the year.\n\nUnderwood has sold 70 million records worldwide. She is the fifth highest-certified female artist of all time on the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]'s [[List of highest-certified music artists in the United States|Top Artists (Digital Singles)]] ranking, the highest-certified country album artist to debut in the twenty-first century and the woman with the most number-one singles on the ''Billboard'' [[Country Airplay]] chart, with 15.

Her debut single, \"[[Inside Your Heaven]]\", made her the only country artist to debut at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and the only solo country artist in the 2000s to have a number-one song on the Hot 100. Her debut album, ''[[Some Hearts]]'' (2005), was bolstered by the huge [[Crossover music|crossover]] success of the singles \"[[Jesus, Take the Wheel]]\" and \"[[Before He Cheats]]\", becoming the best-selling solo female debut album in country music history, the fastest-selling debut country album in [[Nielsen SoundScan]] history and the best-selling country album of the last 17 years.

Her first compilation album, ''[[Greatest Hits: Decade Number 1|Greatest Hits: Decade #1]]'' (2014), was a chart and sales success that spawned the Grammy Award-winning crossover single \"[[Something in the Water (Carrie Underwood song)|Something in the Water]]\". Her fifth album, ''[[Storyteller (Carrie Underwood album)|Storyteller]]'' (2015), made her the only country artist to have all first five studio albums reach either numbers one or two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. With her sixth album, ''[[Cry Pretty]]'' (2018), she became the only woman to top the ''Billboard'' 200 with four country albums, and had both the biggest week for any album by a woman in 2018 and the best-selling solo female album of the year.\n\nUnderwood has sold 70 million records worldwide.

Upon graduation, he served as a medical officer in the Ministry of Health from 1988 to 1990. In the same year, Adham began his first career as a medical doctor in the private sector in 1990 to the present.

The appointment is made as the country faces [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Malaysia|COVID-19]] disease.<ref name=\"Malay Mail\"/>\n\n==Controversy==\n===Warm Water Helps Prevent the Spread of Coronavirus===\nOn 19 March 2020, Adham advised the public that drinking warm water will help prevent [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] virus infection as the virus will be flushed down to the stomach and the digestive acids will kill any virus, while being interviewed at [[Radio Televisyen Malaysia|RTM]]'s ''Bicara Naratif'' programme. His remarks later went viral on social media, with many netizens questioning his dubious claim. Dr Nur Amalina Che Bakri had criticised Adham saying that there was no scientific evidence that the stomach's acid can kill the virus.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/03/20/health-minister039s-039warm-water-method039-to-kill-coronavirus-questioned|title=Health Minister's 'warm water method' to kill coronavirus questioned|work=The Star}}</ref> [[World Health Organisation]] (WHO) has also refuted the claim, noting that while staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent the coronavirus infection.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://says.com/my/news/health-minister-wrongly-claims-hot-water-can-kill-coronavirus-because-it-doesn-t-like-heat|title=Health Minister Claims Warm Water Can Kill Coronavirus Because It \"Doesn't Like Heat\"|work=Says}}</ref> Health Director-General Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah later refuted   Adham's statement, commenting that the Health Ministry's approach for patient treatment and management is always based on scientific evidence.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.therakyatpost.com/2020/03/22/health-dg-appears-to-disagree-with-health-minister-on-warm-water-claim/|title=Health DG appears to disagree with Health Minister on Warm Water claim|work=The Rakyat Post}}</ref>\n\n===Pakatan Harapan Blamed for Failing to Contain Tabligh Cluster===\nOn 18 April 2020, Adham in a live-streamed video conference call with [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]] President [[Ahmad Zahid Hamidi]], he erroneously claimed that the previous [[Pakatan Harapan]] government has failed to contain the tabligh cluster happened from 27 February to 3 March, which grew to become a source of the largest [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] infections.

Journalists were allowed to report from the front only if they were experienced officers who had \"recognized patriotic views\".

Contact between journalists and fighting troops was prohibited, and journalists spoke only to high-ranking officers and commanders.<ref name=war>{{cite book|title=Selling War: The Role of Mass Media in Hostile Conflicts From World War I to the 'War on Terror'|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=29}}</ref>\n\nDespite the availability of [[Kodak Brownie]] cameras, both the [[Central Powers]] and the [[Entente Powers]] initially prohibited any photography or filming. The primary visual representation relied on [[war painting]] though the Germans used some filmed newsreels that were were heavily censored.

That would appear to be a form of [[censorship]], but the newspapers of Britain, which effectively controlled by the [[broadcast media|media]] barons of the time, were happy to follow and printed headlines that were designed to stir up emotions, regardless of whether they were accurate or not. The most infamous headlines included \"Belgium child's hands cut off by Germans\" and \"Germans crucify Canadian officer\".<ref name=\":4\">{{cite web|last1=Trueman|first1=Chris|title=Propaganda and World War One|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/propaganda_and_world_war_one.htm|website=History Learning Site}}</ref>\n\n==Use of patriotism and nationalism==\n[[File: Uncle sam propaganda in ww1.jpg|thumb|[[Uncle Sam]]'s call to arms]]\n\nAccording to the scholar [[David Welch (historian)|David Welch]], [[patriotism]] and [[nationalism]] were, during the war, two of the most important themes of propaganda.<ref name=\"Propaganda for patriotism and nationalism\" /> In 1914, the British army was made up of not only professional soldiers but also volunteers and so the government relied heavily on propaganda as a tool to justify the war to the public eye.<ref name=\"Propaganda for patriotism and nationalism\" /> It was used to promote recruitment into the armed forces and to convince civilians that if they joined, their sacrifices would be rewarded.<ref name=\"Propaganda for patriotism and nationalism\" /> One of the most impressionable images of the war was the \"Your Country Needs You\" poster, a distinctive recruitment poster of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] (similar to the later [[Uncle Sam]] poster) pointing at his British audience to convince it to join the war effort.<ref name=\"Propaganda for patriotism and nationalism\" /> Another message that was deeply embedded in national sentiment the religious symbolism of [[St George]], who was shown slaying a [[dragon]], which represented the German forces.<ref name=\"Propaganda for patriotism and nationalism\" /> Images of enthusiastic patriotism seemed to encapsulate the tragedy of the European and imperial populations.<ref name=pierre /> Such images were able to conjure up feelings of required patriotism and activism among those who were influenced.<ref name=pierre>{{cite web|last1=Purseigle|first1=Pierre|title=Inside the First World War|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/inside-first-world-war/part-three/10417056/world-war-one-propaganda.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Use as weapon==\nNonmilitary diplomatic and propaganda during the war were designed to build support for the cause or to undermine support for the enemy.<ref>David Stevenson, ''The First World War and International Politics'' (1988).</ref><ref>Z.A.B.

{"title_page": "Timeline of steam power", "text_new": "{{Short description|none}}\n{{refimprove|date=September 2011}}\n'''Steam power''' developed slowly over a period of several hundred years, progressing through expensive and fairly limited devices in the early 17th century, to useful pumps for [[mining]] in 1700, and then to Watt's improved [[steam engine]] designs in the late 18th century. It is these later designs, introduced just when the need for practical power was growing due to the [[Industrial Revolution]], that truly made steam power commonplace.\n\n==Development phases==\n\n===Early examples===\n*1st century AD \u2013 [[Hero of Alexandria]] describes the [[Aeolipile]], as an example of the power of heated air or water.

One is a new sort of steam pump, essentially two devices like de Caus', but attached to a single boiler.

This produces a partial vacuum inside the chambers, which is used to draw a volume of water into the containers through a pipe, thus forming a pump. He builds one of very large size into the side of [[Raglan Castle]], apparently the first \"industrial scale\" steam engine.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Thurston| first=Robert| title=A History of the Growth of the Steam-Engine| publisher=D.

A small number of his pumps are built, mostly experimental in nature, but like any system based on suction to lift the water, they have a maximum height of 32 feet (and typically much less). In order to be practical, his design can also use the pressure of additional steam to force the water out the top of the cylinder, allowing the pumps to be \"stacked\", but many mine owners were afraid of the high risk of explosion and avoided this option. (Savery engines were re-introduced in the 1780s to recirculate water to water wheels driving textile mills, especially in periods of drought).}}\n*{{Timeline-event|date=c. {{Start date|1705}}|event= [[Thomas Newcomen]] develops the [[atmospheric engine]], which, unlike the Savery pump, employs a piston in a cylinder; the vacuum pulling the piston down to the bottom of the cylinder when water is injected into it.<ref>Thurston, ch 2</ref> The engine enabled a great increase in pumping height and the draining of deeper mines than possible when using vacuum to pull the water up.

This greatly increases thermal efficiency by ensuring that the main cylinder can be kept hot at all times, unlike in the Newcomen engines where the condensing water spray cooled the cylinder at each stroke.

A small number of his pumps are built, mostly experimental in nature, but like any system based on suction to lift the water, they have a maximum height of 32 feet (and typically much less). In order to be practical, his design can also use the pressure of additional steam to force the water out the top of the cylinder, allowing the pumps to be \"stacked\", but many mine owners were afraid of the high risk of explosion and avoided this option.

This greatly increases thermal efficiency by ensuring that the main cylinder can be kept hot at all times, unlike in the Newcomen engines where the condensing water spray cooled the cylinder at each stroke.
