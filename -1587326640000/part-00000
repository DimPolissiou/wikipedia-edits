This depression seems formed by nature for the design of giving a more secure lodgement to the egg of the Hedge-sparrow, or its young one, when the young Cuckoo is employed in removing either of them from the nest. When it is about twelve days old, this cavity is quite filled up, and then the back assumes the shape of nestling birds in general.\" <ref>(Letter to Hunter at the Royal Society, as above)</ref> Jenner's nephew assisted in the study. He was born on 30 June 1737.\n\nJenner's understanding of the cuckoo's behaviour was not entirely believed until the artist [[Jemima Blackburn]], a keen observer of bird life, saw a blind nestling pushing out a host's egg.

This depression seems formed by nature for the design of giving a more secure lodgement to the egg of the Hedge-sparrow, or its young one, when the young Cuckoo is employed in removing either of them from the nest. When it is about twelve days old, this cavity is quite filled up, and then the back assumes the shape of nestling birds in general.\" <ref>(Letter to Hunter at the Royal Society, as above)</ref> Jenner's nephew assisted in the study. He was born on 30 June 1737.\n\nJenner's understanding of the cuckoo's behaviour was not entirely believed until the artist [[Jemima Blackburn]], a keen observer of bird life, saw a blind nestling pushing out a host's egg. Her description and illustration of this were enough to convince [[Charles Darwin]] to revise a later edition of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-link=Jemima Blackburn|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women|date=2006}}</ref>\n\nJenner's interest in Zoology played a large role in his first experiment with inoculation.  Not only did he have a profound understanding of human anatomy due to his medical training, but he also understood animal biology and its role in human-animal trans-species boundaries in disease transmission.  At the time there was no way of knowing how important this connection would be to the history and discovery of vaccinations.  We see this connection now; many present day vaccinations include animal parts from cows, rabbits, and chicken eggs, which can be attributed to the work of Jenner and his cowpox/smallpox vaccination.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=Alexandra Minna|last2=Markel|first2=Howard|date=|year=2005|title=The History of Vaccines and Immunization: Familiar Patterns, New Challenges|url=|journal=Health Affairs|volume=24|issue=3|pages=611\u2013621|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.3.611|pmid=15886151|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage and human medicine==\n[[File:Edward Jenner, certificate of attendance at Wellcome L0020702.jpg|thumb|upright|A lecturer's certificate of attendance given to Jenner.

{"title_page": "Series (mathematics)", "text_new": "{{short description|Infinite sum}}\n{{about|infinite sums|finite sums|Summation}}\n{{Calculus}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''series''' is, roughly speaking, a description of the operation of adding infinitely many quantities, one after the other, to a given starting quantity.<ref>{{cite book |title=Calculus Made Easy |last1=Thompson |first1=Silvanus |authorlink1=Silvanus P. Thompson |last2=Gardner |first2=Martin |authorlink2=Martin Gardner |date=1998 |isbn=978-0-312-18548-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/calculusmadeeasy00thom_0 }}</ref>  The study of series is a major part of [[calculus]] and its generalization, [[mathematical analysis]]. Series are used in most areas of mathematics, even for studying finite structures (such as in [[combinatorics]]), through [[generating function]]s. In addition to their ubiquity in mathematics, infinite series are also widely used in other quantitative disciplines such as [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[statistics]] and [[finance]].\n\nFor a long time, the idea that such a [[potential infinity|potentially infinite]] summation could produce a finite result was considered [[paradox]]ical. This paradox was resolved using the concept of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] during the 19th century. [[Zeno's paradox]] of [[Achilles and the tortoise]] illustrates this counterintuitive property of infinite sums: Achilles runs after a tortoise, but when he reaches the position of the tortoise at the beginning of the race, the tortoise has reached a second position; when he reaches this second position, the tortoise is at a third position, and so on. [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] concluded that Achilles could ''never'' reach the tortoise, and thus that movement does not exist. Zeno divided the race into infinitely many sub-races, each requiring a finite amount of time, so that the total time for Achilles to catch the tortoise is given by a series.  The resolution of the paradox is that, although the series has an infinite number of terms, it has a finite sum, which gives the time necessary for Achilles to catch up with the tortoise.\n\nIn modern terminology, any (ordered) [[Sequence (mathematics)|infinite sequence]] <math>(a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots)</math> of [[Term (mathematics)|terms]] (that is, numbers, [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], or anything that can be added) defines a series, which is the operation of adding the {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} one after the other. To emphasize that there are an infinite number of terms, a series may be called an '''infinite series'''. Such a series is represented (or denoted) by an [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] like\n: <math>a_1+a_2+a_3+\\cdots,</math>\nor, using the [[summation sign]],\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty a_i.</math>\n\nThe infinite sequence of additions implied by a series cannot be effectively carried on (at least in a finite amount of time). However, if the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] to which the terms and their finite sums belong has a notion of [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]], it is sometimes possible to assign a value to a series, called the sum of the series. This value is the limit as {{math|''n''}}  tends to infinity (if the limit exists) of the finite sums of the {{math|''n''}} first terms of the series, which are called the {{math|''n''}}th '''partial sums''' of the series. That is,\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty a_i  = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i.</math>\nWhen this limit exists, one says that the series is '''convergent''' or '''summable''', or that the sequence <math>(a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots)</math> is '''summable'''. In this case, the limit is called the '''sum''' of the series. Otherwise, the series is said to be '''divergent'''.\n\nGenerally, the terms of a series come from a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]], often the [[Field (mathematics)|field]] <math>\\mathbb R</math> of the [[real number]]s or the field <math>\\mathbb C</math> of the [[complex number]]s. In this case, the set of all series is itself a ring (and even an [[associative algebra]]), in which the addition consists of adding the series term by term, and the multiplication is the [[Cauchy product]].\n\n==Basic properties==\n\nAn infinite series or simply a series is an infinite sum, represented by an [[infinite expression]] of the form<ref name=\"SW501\">{{harvnb|Swokowski|1983|loc=p. 501}}</ref>\n:<math>a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots, </math>\nwhere <math>(a_n)</math> is any ordered [[sequence]] of [[term (mathematics)|terms]], such as [[number]]s, [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], or anything else that can be [[addition|added]] (an [[abelian group]]).  This is an expression that is obtained from the list of terms <math>a_0,a_1,\\dots</math> by laying them side by side, and conjoining them with the symbol \"+\".  A series may also be represented by using [[Summation#Capital-sigma notation|summation notation]], such as\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_n </math> .\n\nIf an abelian group ''A'' of terms has a concept of [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] (for example, if it is a [[metric space]]), then some series, the [[convergent series]], can be interpreted as having a value in ''A'', called the ''sum of the series''. This includes the common cases from calculus in which the group is the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers. Given a series <math>s=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n,</math> its ''k''th '''partial sum''' is\n:<math>s_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{k}a_n = a_0 + a_1 + \\cdots + a_k.</math>\nBy definition, the series <math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n</math> ''converges'' to the limit {{math|''L''}} (or simply ''sums'' to {{math|''L''}}), if the sequence of its partial sums has a limit {{math|''L''}}.<ref name=\"SW501\" /> In this case, one usually writes\n:<math>L = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_n.</math>\nA series is said to be ''convergent'' if it converges to some limit or ''divergent'' when it does not.  The value of this limit, if it exists, is then the value of the series.\n\n===Convergent series===\n[[File:Geometric sequences.svg|thumb|right|Illustration of 3 [[geometric series]] with partial sums from 1 to 6 terms. The dashed line represents the limit.]]\nA series {{math|\u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is said to [[Convergent series|converge]] or to ''be convergent'' when the sequence {{math|(''s''<sub>''k''</sub>)}} of partial sums has a finite [[Limit of a sequence|limit]]. If the limit of {{math|''s''<sub>''k''</sub>}} is infinite or does not exist, the series is said to [[Divergent series|diverge]].<ref>{{citation|title=Calculus|author=Michael Spivak}}</ref> When the limit of partial sums exists, it is called the value (or sum) of the series\n\n: <math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} s_k = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\sum_{n=0}^k a_n.</math>\n\nAn easy way that an infinite series can converge is if all the ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are zero for ''n'' sufficiently large.  Such a series can be identified with a finite sum, so it is only infinite in a trivial sense.\n\nWorking out the properties of the series that converge even if infinitely many terms are non-zero is the essence of the study of series. Consider the example\n\n:<math> 1 + \\frac{1}{2}+ \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{8}+\\cdots+ \\frac{1}{2^n}+\\cdots.</math>\n\nIt is possible to \"visualize\" its convergence on the [[real number|real number line]]: we can imagine a line of length 2, with successive segments marked off of lengths 1, \u00bd, \u00bc, etc. There is always room to mark the next segment, because the amount of line remaining is always the same as the last segment marked: when we have marked off \u00bd, we still have a piece of length \u00bd unmarked, so we can certainly mark the next&nbsp;\u00bc.  This argument does not prove that the sum is ''equal'' to 2 (although it is), but it does prove that it is ''at most''&nbsp;2.  In other words, the series has an upper bound. Given that the series converges, proving that it is equal to 2 requires only elementary algebra. If the series is denoted {{math|''S''}}, it can be seen that\n\n:<math>S/2 = \\frac{1+ \\frac{1}{2}+ \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{8}+\\cdots}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}+ \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{8}+ \\frac{1}{16} +\\cdots.</math>\n\nTherefore,\n\n:<math>S-S/2 = 1 \\Rightarrow S = 2.</math>\n\nThe idiom can be extended to other, equivalent notions of series. For instance, a [[Repeating decimal|recurring decimal]], as in\n\n:<math>x = 0.111\\dots </math>,\n\nencodes the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{10^n}.</math>\n\nSince these series always converge to [[real numbers]] (because of what is called the [[Complete space|completeness property]] of the real numbers), to talk about the series in this way is the same as to talk about the numbers for which they stand.  In particular, the decimal expansion 0.111... can be identified with <sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub>.  This leads to an argument that {{nowrap|1=9 \u00d7 0.111... = 0.999... = 1}}, which only relies on the fact that the limit laws for series preserve the arithmetic operations; this argument is presented in the article [[0.999...]].\n\n==Examples of numerical series==\n{{For|other examples|List of mathematical series|Sums of reciprocals#Infinitely many terms}}\n* A ''[[geometric series]]'' is one where each successive term is produced by multiplying the previous term by a [[Mathematical constant|constant number]] (called the common ratio in this context).

It is thus a [[unary operation]] on sequences. Further, this function is [[Linear map|linear]], and thus is a [[linear operator]] on the [[vector space]] of sequences, denoted \u03a3. The inverse operator is the [[finite difference]] operator, denoted \u0394. These behave as discrete analogs of [[Integral|integration]] and [[derivative|differentiation]], only for series (functions of a natural number) instead of functions of a real variable. For example, the sequence (1, 1, 1, ...) has series (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) as its partial summation, which is analogous to the fact that <math>\\int_0^x 1\\,dt = x.</math>\n\nIn [[computer science]] it is known as [[prefix sum]].\n\n==Properties of series==\nSeries are classified not only by whether they converge or diverge, but also by the properties of the terms a<sub>n</sub> (absolute or conditional convergence); type of convergence of the series (pointwise, uniform); the class of the term a<sub>n</sub> (whether it is a real number, arithmetic progression, trigonometric function); etc.\n\n===Non-negative terms===\nWhen ''a<sub>n</sub>'' is a non-negative real number for every ''n'', the sequence ''S<sub>N</sub>'' of partial sums is non-decreasing. It follows that a series \u2211''a<sub>n</sub>'' with non-negative terms converges if and only if the sequence ''S<sub>N</sub>'' of partial sums is bounded.\n\nFor example, the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2}</math>\n\nis convergent, because the inequality\n\n:<math>\\frac1 {n^2} \\le \\frac{1}{n-1} - \\frac{1}{n}, \\quad n \\ge 2,</math>\n\nand a telescopic sum argument implies that the partial sums are bounded by 2. The exact value of the original series is the [[Basel problem]].\n\n===Absolute convergence===\n{{Main|Absolute convergence}}\nA series\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n</math>\n''converges absolutely'' if the series of [[absolute value]]s\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\left|a_n\\right|</math>\nconverges. This is sufficient to guarantee not only that the original series converges to a limit, but also that any reordering of it converges to the same limit.\n\n===Conditional convergence===\n{{Main|Conditional convergence}}\nA series of real or complex numbers is said to be '''conditionally convergent''' (or '''semi-convergent''') if it is convergent but not absolutely convergent. A famous example is the alternating series\n\n:<math>\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty {(-1)^{n+1}  \\over n} = 1 - {1 \\over 2} + {1 \\over 3} - {1 \\over 4} + {1 \\over 5} - \\cdots,</math>\n\nwhich is convergent (and its sum is equal to&nbsp;ln&nbsp;2), but the series formed by taking the absolute value of each term is the divergent [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]]. The [[Riemann series theorem]] says that any conditionally convergent series can be reordered to make a divergent series, and moreover, if the ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are real and ''S'' is any real number, that one can find a reordering so that the reordered series converges with sum equal to&nbsp;''S''.\n\n[[Abel's test]] is an important tool for handling semi-convergent series. If a series has the form\n\n:<math>\\sum a_n = \\sum \\lambda_n b_n</math>\n\nwhere the partial sums ''B''<sub>''N''</sub>&nbsp;= {{nowrap|''b''<sub>0</sub> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''b<sub>n</sub>''}} are bounded, ''\u03bb''<sub>''n''</sub> has bounded variation, and {{nowrap|lim \u03bb<sub>''n''</sub>&thinsp;''B''<sub>''n''</sub>}} exists:\n\n:<math>\\sup_N \\Bigl| \\sum_{n=0}^N b_n \\Bigr| < \\infty, \\ \\ \\sum |\\lambda_{n+1} - \\lambda_n| < \\infty\\ \\text{and} \\ \\lambda_n B_n \\ \\text{converges,}</math>\n\nthen the series {{nowrap|\u2211&thinsp;''a<sub>n</sub>''}} is convergent.

Abel's method consists in writing ''b''<sub>''n''+1</sub>&nbsp;= ''B''<sub>''n''+1</sub>&nbsp;\u2212 ''B''<sub>''n''</sub>, and in performing a transformation similar to [[integration by parts]] (called [[summation by parts]]), that relates the given series {{nowrap|\u2211&thinsp;''a<sub>n</sub>''}} to the absolutely convergent series\n\n:<math> \\sum (\\lambda_n - \\lambda_{n+1}) \\, B_n.</math>\n\n===Evaluation of truncation errors===\nThe evaluation of truncation errors is an important procedure in [[numerical analysis]] (especially [[validated numerics]] and [[computer-assisted proof]]).\n====[[Alternating series]]====\nWhen conditions of the [[alternating series test]] is satisfied by <math>S:=\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty(-1)^m u_m</math>, there is an exact error evaluation.<ref>[https://www.ck12.org/book/CK-12-Calculus-Concepts/section/9.9/ Positive and Negative Terms: Alternating Series]</ref> Set <math>s_n</math> as the partial sum of the given alternating series <math>S:=\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty(-1)^m u_m</math>.

The converse is in general not true.\n* For some specific types of series there are more specialized convergence tests, for instance for [[Fourier series]] there is the [[Dini test]].\n\n==Series of functions==\n{{Main|Function series}}\nA series of real- or complex-valued functions\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty f_n(x)</math>\n\n[[Pointwise convergence|converges pointwise]] on a set ''E'', if the series converges for each ''x'' in ''E'' as an ordinary series of real or complex numbers.  Equivalently, the partial sums\n:<math>s_N(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^N f_n(x)</math>\nconverge to ''\u0192''(''x'') as ''N''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e for each ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''E''.\n\nA stronger notion of convergence of a series of functions is the [[uniform convergence]]. A series converges uniformly if it converges pointwise to the function ''\u0192''(''x''), and the error in approximating the limit by the ''N''th partial sum,\n:<math>|s_N(x) - f(x)|</math>\ncan be made minimal ''independently'' of ''x'' by choosing a sufficiently large ''N''.\n\nUniform convergence is desirable for a series because many properties of the terms of the series are then retained by the limit.  For example, if a series of continuous functions converges uniformly, then the limit function is also continuous.  Similarly, if the ''\u0192''<sub>''n''</sub> are [[integral|integrable]] on a closed and bounded interval ''I'' and converge uniformly, then the series is also integrable on ''I'' and can be integrated term-by-term. Tests for uniform convergence include the [[Weierstrass M-test|Weierstrass' M-test]], [[Abel's uniform convergence test]], [[Dini's test]], and the [[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy criterion]].\n\nMore sophisticated types of convergence of a series of functions can also be defined.  In [[measure theory]], for instance, a series of functions converges [[almost everywhere]] if it converges pointwise except on a certain set of [[null set|measure zero]].  Other [[modes of convergence]] depend on a different [[metric space]] structure on the space of functions under consideration.  For instance, a series of functions '''converges in mean''' on a set ''E'' to a limit function ''\u0192'' provided\n:<math>\\int_E \\left|s_N(x)-f(x)\\right|^2\\,dx \\to 0</math>\nas ''N''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e.\n\n===Power series===\n:{{Main|Power series}}\n\nA '''power series''' is a series of the form\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n(x-c)^n.</math>\n\nThe [[Taylor series]] at a point ''c'' of a function is a power series that, in many cases, converges to the function in a neighborhood of ''c''. For example, the series\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!}</math>\nis the Taylor series of <math>e^x</math> at the origin and converges to it for every ''x''.\n\nUnless it converges only at ''x''=''c'', such a series converges on a certain open disc of convergence centered at the point ''c'' in the complex plane, and may also converge at some of the points of the boundary of the disc.  The radius of this disc is known as the [[radius of convergence]], and can in principle be determined from the asymptotics of the coefficients ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>.  The convergence is uniform on [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]] (that is, [[compact set|compact]]) subsets of the interior of the disc of convergence: to wit, it is [[Compact convergence|uniformly convergent on compact sets]].\n\nHistorically, mathematicians such as [[Leonhard Euler]] operated liberally with infinite series, even if they were not convergent. When calculus was put on a sound and correct foundation in the nineteenth century, rigorous proofs of the convergence of series were always required.\n\n=== Formal power series ===\n{{main|Formal power series}}\n\nWhile many uses of power series refer to their sums, it is also possible to treat power series as ''formal sums'', meaning that no addition operations are actually performed, and the symbol \"+\" is an abstract symbol of conjunction which is not necessarily interpreted as corresponding to addition. In this setting, the sequence of coefficients itself is of interest, rather than the convergence of the series. Formal power series are used in [[combinatorics]] to describe and study [[sequence]]s that are otherwise difficult to handle, for example, using the method of [[generating function]]s.  The [[Hilbert\u2013Poincar\u00e9 series]] is a formal power series used to study [[graded algebra]]s.\n\nEven if the limit of the power series is not considered, if the terms support appropriate structure then it is possible to define operations such as [[addition]], [[multiplication]], [[derivative]], [[antiderivative]] for power series \"formally\", treating the symbol \"+\" as if it corresponded to addition. In the most common setting, the terms come from a [[commutative ring]], so that the formal power series can be added term-by-term and multiplied via the [[Cauchy product]]. In this case the algebra of formal power series is the [[total algebra]] of the [[monoid]] of [[natural numbers]] over the underlying term ring.<ref>{{citation|author=[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]|title=Algebra|publisher=Springer|year=1989}}: \u00a7III.2.11.</ref>  If the underlying term ring is a [[differential algebra]], then the algebra of formal power series is also a differential algebra, with differentiation performed term-by-term.\n\n===Laurent series===\n{{Main|Laurent series}}\nLaurent series generalize power series by admitting terms into the series with negative as well as positive exponents.  A Laurent series is thus any series of the form\n:<math>\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty a_n x^n.</math>\nIf such a series converges, then in general it does so in an [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] rather than a disc, and possibly some boundary points.  The series converges uniformly on compact subsets of the interior of the annulus of convergence.\n\n===Dirichlet series===\n:{{Main|Dirichlet series}}\n\nA [[Dirichlet series]] is one of the form\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty {a_n \\over n^s},</math>\n\nwhere ''s'' is a [[complex number]].  For example, if all ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are equal to 1, then the Dirichlet series is the [[Riemann zeta function]]\n\n:<math>\\zeta(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^s}.</math>\n\nLike the zeta function, Dirichlet series in general play an important role in [[analytic number theory]].  Generally a Dirichlet series converges if the real part of ''s'' is greater than a number called the abscissa of convergence.  In many cases, a Dirichlet series can be extended to an [[analytic function]] outside the domain of convergence by [[analytic continuation]].  For example, the Dirichlet series for the zeta function converges absolutely when Re&nbsp;''s''&nbsp;> 1, but the zeta function can be extended to a holomorphic function defined on <math>\\mathbf{C}\\setminus\\{1\\}</math>&thinsp; with a simple [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]] at&nbsp;1.\n\nThis series can be directly generalized to [[general Dirichlet series]].\n\n===Trigonometric series===\n{{Main|Trigonometric series}}\nA series of functions in which the terms are [[trigonometric function]]s is called a '''trigonometric series''':\n:<math>\\tfrac12 A_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(A_n\\cos nx + B_n \\sin nx\\right).</math>\nThe most important example of a trigonometric series is the [[Fourier series]] of a function.\n\n==History of the theory of infinite series==\n\n===Development of infinite series===\n[[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematician [[Archimedes]] produced the first known summation of an infinite series with a\nmethod that is still used in the area of calculus today. He used the [[method of exhaustion]] to calculate the [[area]] under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of [[Pi|\u03c0]].<ref>{{cite web | title = A history of calculus |author1=O'Connor, J.J.  |author2=Robertson, E.F.  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher = [[University of St Andrews]]| url = http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/The_rise_of_calculus.html |date=February 1996|accessdate= 2007-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ502088&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ502088|title=Archimedes and Pi-Revisited.|first=Bidwell, James|last=K.|date=30 November 1993|journal=School Science and Mathematics|volume=94|issue=3}}</ref>\n\nMathematicians from Kerala, India studied infinite series around 1350 CE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/article/?id=2962|title=Indians predated Newton 'discovery' by 250 years|author=|date=|website=manchester.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century, [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] worked in the new [[decimal]] system on infinite series and published several [[Maclaurin series]]. In 1715, a general method for constructing the [[Taylor series]] for all functions for which they exist was provided by [[Brook Taylor]]. [[Leonhard Euler]] in the 18th century, developed the theory of [[hypergeometric series]] and [[q-series]].\n\n===Convergence criteria===\nThe investigation of the validity of infinite series is considered to begin with [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in the 19th century. Euler had already considered the hypergeometric series\n\n:<math>1 + \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{1\\cdot\\gamma}x + \\frac{\\alpha(\\alpha+1)\\beta(\\beta+1)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\gamma(\\gamma+1)}x^2 + \\cdots</math>\non which Gauss published a memoir in 1812. It established simpler criteria of convergence, and the questions of remainders and the range of convergence.\n\n[[Cauchy]] (1821) insisted on strict tests of convergence; he showed that if two series are convergent their product is not necessarily so, and with him begins the discovery of effective criteria. The terms ''convergence'' and ''divergence'' had been introduced long before by [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|Gregory]] (1668). [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] had given various criteria, and [[Colin Maclaurin]] had anticipated some of Cauchy's discoveries. Cauchy advanced the theory of [[power series]] by his expansion of a complex [[function (mathematics)|function]] in such a form.\n\n[[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] (1826) in his memoir on the [[binomial series]]\n:<math>1 + \\frac{m}{1!}x + \\frac{m(m-1)}{2!}x^2 + \\cdots</math>\n\ncorrected certain of Cauchy's conclusions, and gave a completely\nscientific summation of the series for complex values of <math>m</math> and <math>x</math>. He showed the necessity of considering the subject of continuity in questions of convergence.\n\nCauchy's methods led to special rather than general criteria, and\nthe same may be said of [[Joseph Ludwig Raabe|Raabe]] (1832), who made the first elaborate\ninvestigation of the subject, of [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] (from 1842), whose\nlogarithmic test [[Paul du Bois-Reymond|DuBois-Reymond]] (1873) and [[Alfred Pringsheim|Pringsheim]] (1889) have\nshown to fail within a certain region; of [[Joseph Louis Fran\u00e7ois Bertrand|Bertrand]] (1842), [[Pierre Ossian Bonnet|Bonnet]]\n(1843), [[Carl Johan Malmsten|Malmsten]] (1846, 1847, the latter without integration);\n[[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] (1847), [[Paucker]] (1852), [[Chebyshev]] (1852), and [[Arndt]]\n(1853).\n\nGeneral criteria began with [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] (1835), and have been\nstudied by [[Gotthold Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] (1847), [[Weierstrass]] in his various\ncontributions to the theory of functions, [[Ulisse Dini|Dini]] (1867),\nDuBois-Reymond (1873), and many others. Pringsheim's memoirs (1889) present the most complete general theory.\n\n===Uniform convergence===\nThe theory of [[uniform convergence]] was treated by Cauchy (1821), his\nlimitations being pointed out by Abel, but the first to attack it\nsuccessfully were [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel|Seidel]] and [[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] (1847\u201348). Cauchy took up the\nproblem again (1853), acknowledging Abel's criticism, and reaching\nthe same conclusions which Stokes had already found. Thomae used the\ndoctrine (1866), but there was great delay in recognizing the\nimportance of distinguishing between uniform and non-uniform\nconvergence, in spite of the demands of the theory of functions.\n\n===Semi-convergence===\nA series is said to be semi-convergent (or conditionally convergent) if it is convergent but not [[absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]].\n\nSemi-convergent series were studied by Poisson (1823), who also gave a general form for the remainder of the Maclaurin formula. The most important solution of the problem is due, however, to Jacobi (1834),\nwho attacked the question of the remainder from a different standpoint and reached a different formula. This expression was also worked out, and another one given, by [[Carl Johan Malmsten|Malmsten]] (1847).  [[Schl\u00f6milch]] (''Zeitschrift'', Vol.I, p.&nbsp;192, 1856) also improved Jacobi's remainder, and showed the relation between the remainder and [[Faulhaber's formula|Bernoulli's function]]\n\n:<math>F(x) = 1^n + 2^n + \\cdots + (x - 1)^n.</math>\n\n[[Angelo Genocchi|Genocchi]] (1852) has further contributed to the theory.\n\nAmong the early writers was [[Josef Hoene-Wronski|Wronski]], whose \"loi supr\u00eame\" (1815) was hardly recognized until [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] (1873) brought it into\nprominence.\n\n===Fourier series===\n[[Fourier series]] were being investigated\nas the result of physical considerations at the same time that\nGauss, Abel, and Cauchy were working out the theory of infinite\nseries. Series for the expansion of sines and cosines, of multiple\narcs in powers of the sine and cosine of the arc had been treated by\n[[Jacob Bernoulli]] (1702) and his brother [[Johann Bernoulli]] (1701) and still\nearlier by [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]]. Euler and [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] simplified the subject,\nas did [[Louis Poinsot|Poinsot]], [[Karl Schr\u00f6ter|Schr\u00f6ter]], [[James Whitbread Lee Glaisher|Glaisher]], and [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]].\n\nFourier (1807) set for himself a different problem, to\nexpand a given function of ''x'' in terms of the sines or cosines of\nmultiples of ''x'', a problem which he embodied in his ''[[Th\u00e9orie analytique de la chaleur]]'' (1822). Euler had already given the\nformulas for determining the coefficients in the series;\nFourier was the first to assert and attempt to prove the general\ntheorem. [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson|Poisson]] (1820\u201323) also attacked the problem from a\ndifferent standpoint. Fourier did not, however, settle the question\nof convergence of his series, a matter left for [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] (1826) to\nattempt and for Dirichlet (1829) to handle in a thoroughly\nscientific manner (see [[convergence of Fourier series]]). Dirichlet's treatment (''[[Journal f\u00fcr die reine und angewandte Mathematik|Crelle]]'', 1829), of trigonometric series was the subject of criticism and improvement by\nRiemann (1854), Heine, [[Rudolf Lipschitz|Lipschitz]], [[Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli|Schl\u00e4fli]], and\n[[Paul du Bois-Reymond|du Bois-Reymond]]. Among other prominent contributors to the theory of\ntrigonometric and Fourier series were [[Ulisse Dini|Dini]], [[Charles Hermite|Hermite]], [[Georges Henri Halphen|Halphen]],\nKrause, Byerly and [[Paul \u00c9mile Appell|Appell]].\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Asymptotic series===\n[[Asymptotic series]], otherwise [[asymptotic expansion]]s, are infinite series whose partial sums become good approximations in the limit of some point of the domain.  In general they do not converge, but they are useful as sequences of approximations, each of which provides a value close to the desired answer for a finite number of terms. The difference is that an asymptotic series cannot be made to produce an answer as exact as desired, the way that convergent series can. In fact, after a certain number of terms, a typical asymptotic series reaches its best approximation; if more terms are included, most such series will produce worse answers.\n\n===Divergent series===\n{{Main|Divergent series}}\nUnder many circumstances, it is desirable to assign a limit to a series which fails to converge in the usual sense.  A [[summability method]] is such an assignment of a limit to a subset of the set of divergent series which properly extends the classical notion of convergence.  Summability methods include [[Ces\u00e0ro summation]], (''C'',''k'') summation, [[Abel summation]], and [[Borel summation]], in increasing order of generality (and hence applicable to increasingly divergent series).\n\nA variety of general results concerning possible summability methods are known.  The [[Silverman\u2013Toeplitz theorem]] characterizes ''matrix summability methods'', which are methods for summing a divergent series by applying an infinite matrix to the vector of coefficients.  The most general method for summing a divergent series is non-constructive, and concerns [[Banach limit]]s.\n\n===Series in topological vector spaces===\nIf ''X'' is a [[Topological Vector Space]] (TVS) and <math>\\left( x_{\\alpha} \\right)_{\\alpha \\in A}</math> is a (possibly [[uncountable]]) family in ''X'' then this family is '''summable'''{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=179-180}} if the limit <math>\\lim_{H \\in \\mathcal{F}(A)} x_{H}</math> of the [[Net (mathematics)|net]] <math>\\left( x_H \\right)_{H \\in \\mathcal{F}(A)}</math> converges in ''X'', where <math>\\mathcal{F}(A)</math> is the [[directed set]] of all finite subsets of ''A'' directed by inclusion <math>\\subseteq</math> and <math>x_H := \\sum_{i \\in H} x_i</math>. \n\nIt is called '''[[absolutely summable]]''' if in addition, for every continuous seminorm ''p'' on ''X'', the family <math>\\left( p \\left( x_{\\alpha} \\right) \\right)_{\\alpha \\in A}</math> is summable.\nIf ''X'' is a normable space and if <math>\\left( x_{\\alpha} \\right)_{\\alpha \\in A}</math> is an absolutely summable family in ''X'', then necessarily all but a countable collection of <math>x_{\\alpha}</math>'s are 0. Hence, in normed spaces, it is usually only ever necessary to consider series with countably many terms. \n\nSummable families play an important role in the theory of [[nuclear space]]s.\n\n====Series in Banach spaces====\nThe notion of series can be easily extended to the case of a [[Banach space]].  If ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> is a sequence of elements of a Banach space ''X'', then the series \u03a3''x''<sub>''n''</sub> converges to ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''X'' if the sequence of partial sums of the series tends to ''x''; to wit,\n:<math>\\biggl\\|x - \\sum_{n=0}^N x_n\\biggr\\|\\to 0</math>\nas ''N''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e.\n\nMore generally, convergence of series can be defined in any [[abelian group|abelian]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]].  Specifically, in this case, \u03a3''x''<sub>''n''</sub> converges to ''x'' if the sequence of partial sums converges to ''x''.\n\n===Summations over arbitrary index sets===\nDefinitions may be given for sums over an arbitrary index set {{math|''I''}}.<ref>{{citation|author=Jean Dieudonn\u00e9|title=Foundations of mathematical analysis|publisher=Academic Press}}</ref>  There are two main differences with the usual notion of series: first, there is no specific order given on the set {{math|''I''}}; second, this set {{math|''I''}} may be uncountable.  The notion of convergence needs to be strengthened, because the concept of [[conditional convergence]] depends on the ordering of the index set.\n\nIf <math>a:I \\mapsto G</math> is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] from an [[index set]] {{math|''I''}} to a set {{math|''G''}}, then the \"series\" associated to <math>a</math> is the [[formal sum]] of the elements <math>a(x) \\in G </math> over the index elements <math>x \\in I</math> denoted by the\n:<math>\\sum_{x \\in I} a(x).</math>\n\nWhen the index set is the natural numbers <math>I=\\mathbb{N}</math>, the function <math>a:\\mathbb{N} \\mapsto G</math> is a [[sequence]] denoted by <math>a(n)=a_n</math>. A series indexed on the natural numbers is an ordered formal sum and so we rewrite <math>\\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}</math> as <math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}</math> in order to emphasize the ordering induced by the natural numbers. Thus, we obtain the common notation for a series indexed by the natural numbers\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots.</math>\n\n====Families of non-negative numbers====\nWhen summing a family {''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}, ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'', of non-negative numbers, one may define\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i\\in I}a_i = \\sup \\Bigl\\{ \\sum_{i\\in A}a_i\\,\\big| A \\text{ finite, } A \\subset I\\Bigr\\} \\in [0, +\\infty].</math>\n\nWhen the supremum is finite, the set of ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'' such that ''a<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;> 0 is countable.  Indeed, for every ''n''&nbsp;\u2265 1, the set <math> A_n = \\{ i \\in I \\,:\\, a_i > 1/n \\}</math> is finite, because\n\n:<math> \\frac 1 n \\, \\textrm{card}(A_n) \\le \\sum_{i\\in A_n} a_i  \\le \\sum_{i\\in I}a_i < \\infty.</math>\n\nIf ''I''&thinsp; is countably infinite and enumerated as ''I''&nbsp;= {''i''<sub>0</sub>, ''i''<sub>1</sub>,...} then the above defined sum satisfies\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i \\in I} a_i = \\sum_{k=0}^{+\\infty} a_{i_k},</math>\n\nprovided the value \u221e is allowed for the sum of the series.\n\nAny sum over non-negative reals can be understood as the integral of a non-negative function with respect to the [[counting measure]], which accounts for the many similarities between the two constructions.\n\n====Abelian topological groups====\nLet ''a''&nbsp;: ''I'' \u2192 ''X'', where ''I''&thinsp; is any set and ''X''&thinsp; is an [[abelian group|abelian]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]].  Let ''F''&thinsp; be the collection of all [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]]s of ''I'', with ''F'' viewed as a [[directed set]], [[Partially ordered set|ordered]] under [[inclusion (mathematics)|inclusion]] with [[union (set theory)|union]] as [[join (mathematics)|join]].  Define the sum ''S''&thinsp; of the family ''a'' as the limit\n\n:<math> S = \\sum_{i\\in I}a_i = \\lim \\Bigl\\{\\sum_{i\\in A}a_i\\,\\big| A\\in F\\Bigr\\}</math>\n\nif it exists and say that the family ''a'' is unconditionally summable.  Saying that the sum ''S''&thinsp; is the limit of finite partial sums means that for every neighborhood ''V''&thinsp; of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''<sub>0</sub> of ''I''&thinsp; such that\n\n:<math>S - \\sum_{i \\in A} a_i \\in V, \\quad A \\supset A_0.</math>\n\nBecause ''F''&thinsp; is not [[total order|totally ordered]], this is not a [[limit of a sequence]] of partial sums, but rather of a [[net (mathematics)|net]].<ref name=\"Bourbaki\">{{cite book|title=General Topology: Chapters 1\u20134 |first=Nicolas |last=Bourbaki |authorlink=Nicolas Bourbaki |year=1998 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-64241-1 |pages=261\u2013270}}</ref><ref name=\"Choquet\">{{cite book|title=Topology |first=Gustave |last=Choquet |authorlink=Gustave Choquet |year=1966 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-173450-3 |pages=216\u2013231}}</ref>\n\nFor every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a smaller neighborhood ''V''&thinsp; such that ''V''&nbsp;\u2212 ''V''&nbsp;\u2282 ''W''. It follows that the finite partial sums of an unconditionally summable family ''a<sub>i</sub>'', ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'', form a ''Cauchy net'', that is, for every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''<sub>0</sub> of ''I''&thinsp; such that\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i \\in A_1} a_i - \\sum_{i \\in A_2} a_i \\in W, \\quad A_1, A_2 \\supset A_0.</math>\n\nWhen ''X''&thinsp; is [[Complete metric space|complete]], a family ''a'' is unconditionally summable in ''X''&thinsp; if and only if the finite sums satisfy the latter Cauchy net condition. When ''X''&thinsp; is complete and ''a<sub>i</sub>'', ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'', is unconditionally summable in ''X'', then for every subset ''J''&nbsp;\u2282 ''I'', the corresponding subfamily ''a<sub>j</sub>'', ''j''&nbsp;\u2208 ''J'', is also unconditionally summable in ''X''.\n\nWhen the sum of a family of non-negative numbers, in the extended sense defined before, is finite, then it coincides with the sum in the topological group ''X''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''R'''.\n\nIf a family ''a'' in ''X''&thinsp; is unconditionally summable, then for every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''<sub>0</sub> of ''I''&thinsp; such that ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;\u2208 ''W''&thinsp; for every ''i'' not in ''A''<sub>0</sub>.  If ''X''&thinsp; is [[first-countable space|first-countable]], it follows that the set of ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I''&thinsp; such that ''a<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;\u2260 0 is countable.  This need not be true in a general abelian topological group (see examples below).\n\n====Unconditionally convergent series====\nSuppose that ''I''&nbsp;= '''N'''.  If a family ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''n''&nbsp;\u2208 '''N''', is unconditionally summable in an abelian Hausdorff topological group ''X'', then the series in the usual sense converges and has the same sum,\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbf{N}} a_n.</math>\n\nBy nature, the definition of unconditional summability is insensitive to the order of the summation.  When \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> is unconditionally summable, then the series remains convergent after any permutation ''\u03c3'' of the set '''N''' of indices, with the same sum,\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_{\\sigma(n)} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n.</math>\n\nConversely, if every permutation of a series \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> converges, then the series is unconditionally convergent.  When ''X''&thinsp; is complete, then unconditional convergence is also equivalent to the fact that all subseries are convergent; if ''X''&thinsp; is a Banach space, this is equivalent to say that for every sequence of signs ''\u03b5''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;= \u00b11<!-- this is not about convergence of functions, even less about uniform convergence. -->, the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\varepsilon_n a_n</math>\n\nconverges in ''X''.  If ''X''&thinsp; is a Banach space, then one may define the notion of absolute convergence.  A series \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> of vectors in ''X''&thinsp; converges absolutely if\n\n:<math> \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbf{N}} \\|a_n\\| < +\\infty.</math>\n\nIf a series of vectors in a Banach space converges absolutely then it converges unconditionally, but the converse only holds in finite-dimensional Banach spaces (theorem of {{harvtxt|Dvoretzky|Rogers|1950}}).\n\n====Well-ordered sums====\nConditionally convergent series can be considered if ''I'' is a [[well-ordered]] set, for example, an [[ordinal number]] ''\u03b1''<sub>0</sub>.  One may define by [[transfinite recursion]]:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\beta < \\alpha + 1} a_\\beta = a_{\\alpha} + \\sum_{\\beta < \\alpha} a_\\beta</math>\n\nand for a limit ordinal ''\u03b1'',\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\beta < \\alpha} a_\\beta = \\lim_{\\gamma\\to\\alpha} \\sum_{\\beta < \\gamma} a_\\beta</math>\n\nif this limit exists.  If all limits exist up to ''\u03b1''<sub>0</sub>, then the series converges.\n\n====Examples====\n\n{{ordered list\n|1= Given a function ''f''&nbsp;: ''X''\u2192''Y'', with ''Y'' an abelian topological group, define for every ''a''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''X''\n\n:<math>f_a(x)=\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & x\\neq a, \\\\\nf(a) & x=a, \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\na function whose [[support (mathematics)|support]] is a [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] {''a''}.

Actually, one usually assumes more: the family of functions is ''locally finite'', that is, for every ''x'' there is a neighborhood of ''x'' in which all but a finite number of functions vanish.  Any regularity property of the ''\u03c6<sub>i</sub>'',&thinsp; such as continuity, differentiability, that is preserved under finite sums will be preserved for the sum of any subcollection of this family of functions.\n\n|3= On the [[first uncountable ordinal]] \u03c9<sub>1</sub> viewed as a topological space in the [[order topology]], the constant function ''f'': [0,\u03c9<sub>1</sub>) \u2192 [0,\u03c9<sub>1</sub>] given by ''f''(\u03b1) = 1 satisfies\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\alpha\\in[0,\\omega_1)}f(\\alpha) = \\omega_1</math>\n\n(in other words, \u03c9<sub>1</sub> copies of 1 is \u03c9<sub>1</sub>) only if one takes a limit over all ''countable'' partial sums, rather than finite partial sums.

Series are used in most areas of mathematics, even for studying finite structures (such as in [[combinatorics]]), through [[generating function]]s. In addition to their ubiquity in mathematics, infinite series are also widely used in other quantitative disciplines such as [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[statistics]] and [[finance]].\n\nFor a long time, the idea that such a [[potential infinity|potentially infinite]] summation could produce a finite result was considered [[paradox]]ical. This paradox was resolved using the concept of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] during the 19th century. [[Zeno's paradox]] of [[Achilles and the tortoise]] illustrates this counterintuitive property of infinite sums: Achilles runs after a tortoise, but when he reaches the position of the tortoise at the beginning of the race, the tortoise has reached a second position; when he reaches this second position, the tortoise is at a third position, and so on. [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] concluded that Achilles could ''never'' reach the tortoise, and thus that movement does not exist. Zeno divided the race into infinitely many sub-races, each requiring a finite amount of time, so that the total time for Achilles to catch the tortoise is given by a series.  The resolution of the paradox is that, although the series has an infinite number of terms, it has a finite sum, which gives the time necessary for Achilles to catch up with the tortoise.\n\nIn modern terminology, any (ordered) [[Sequence (mathematics)|infinite sequence]] <math>(a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots)</math> of [[Term (mathematics)|terms]] (that is, numbers, [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], or anything that can be added) defines a series, which is the operation of adding the {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} one after the other. To emphasize that there are an infinite number of terms, a series may be called an '''infinite series'''. Such a series is represented (or denoted) by an [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] like\n: <math>a_1+a_2+a_3+\\cdots,</math>\nor, using the [[summation sign]],\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty a_i.</math>\n\nThe infinite sequence of additions implied by a series cannot be effectively carried on (at least in a finite amount of time). However, if the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] to which the terms and their finite sums belong has a notion of [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]], it is sometimes possible to assign a value to a series, called the sum of the series. This value is the limit as {{math|''n''}}  tends to infinity (if the limit exists) of the finite sums of the {{math|''n''}} first terms of the series, which are called the {{math|''n''}}th '''partial sums''' of the series. That is,\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty a_i  = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i.</math>\nWhen this limit exists, one says that the series is '''convergent''' or '''summable''', or that the sequence <math>(a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots)</math> is '''summable'''. In this case, the limit is called the '''sum''' of the series. Otherwise, the series is said to be '''divergent'''.\n\nGenerally, the terms of a series come from a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]], often the [[Field (mathematics)|field]] <math>\\mathbb R</math> of the [[real number]]s or the field <math>\\mathbb C</math> of the [[complex number]]s. In this case, the set of all series is itself a ring (and even an [[associative algebra]]), in which the addition consists of adding the series term by term, and the multiplication is the [[Cauchy product]].\n\n==Basic properties==\n\nAn infinite series or simply a series is an infinite sum, represented by an [[infinite expression]] of the form<ref name=\"SW501\">{{harvnb|Swokowski|1983|loc=p. 501}}</ref>\n:<math>a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots, </math>\nwhere <math>(a_n)</math> is any ordered [[sequence]] of [[term (mathematics)|terms]], such as [[number]]s, [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], or anything else that can be [[addition|added]] (an [[abelian group]]).  This is an expression that is obtained from the list of terms <math>a_0,a_1,\\dots</math> by laying them side by side, and conjoining them with the symbol \"+\".  A series may also be represented by using [[Summation#Capital-sigma notation|summation notation]], such as\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_n </math> .\n\nIf an abelian group ''A'' of terms has a concept of [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] (for example, if it is a [[metric space]]), then some series, the [[convergent series]], can be interpreted as having a value in ''A'', called the ''sum of the series''. This includes the common cases from calculus in which the group is the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers. Given a series <math>s=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n,</math> its ''k''th '''partial sum''' is\n:<math>s_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{k}a_n = a_0 + a_1 + \\cdots + a_k.</math>\nBy definition, the series <math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n</math> ''converges'' to the limit {{math|''L''}} (or simply ''sums'' to {{math|''L''}}), if the sequence of its partial sums has a limit {{math|''L''}}.<ref name=\"SW501\" /> In this case, one usually writes\n:<math>L = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_n.</math>\nA series is said to be ''convergent'' if it converges to some limit or ''divergent'' when it does not.  The value of this limit, if it exists, is then the value of the series.\n\n===Convergent series===\n[[File:Geometric sequences.svg|thumb|right|Illustration of 3 [[geometric series]] with partial sums from 1 to 6 terms. The dashed line represents the limit.]]\nA series {{math|\u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is said to [[Convergent series|converge]] or to ''be convergent'' when the sequence {{math|(''s''<sub>''k''</sub>)}} of partial sums has a finite [[Limit of a sequence|limit]]. If the limit of {{math|''s''<sub>''k''</sub>}} is infinite or does not exist, the series is said to [[Divergent series|diverge]].<ref>{{citation|title=Calculus|author=Michael Spivak}}</ref> When the limit of partial sums exists, it is called the value (or sum) of the series\n\n: <math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} s_k = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\sum_{n=0}^k a_n.</math>\n\nAn easy way that an infinite series can converge is if all the ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are zero for ''n'' sufficiently large.  Such a series can be identified with a finite sum, so it is only infinite in a trivial sense.\n\nWorking out the properties of the series that converge even if infinitely many terms are non-zero is the essence of the study of series. Consider the example\n\n:<math> 1 + \\frac{1}{2}+ \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{8}+\\cdots+ \\frac{1}{2^n}+\\cdots.</math>\n\nIt is possible to \"visualize\" its convergence on the [[real number|real number line]]: we can imagine a line of length 2, with successive segments marked off of lengths 1, \u00bd, \u00bc, etc. There is always room to mark the next segment, because the amount of line remaining is always the same as the last segment marked: when we have marked off \u00bd, we still have a piece of length \u00bd unmarked, so we can certainly mark the next&nbsp;\u00bc.  This argument does not prove that the sum is ''equal'' to 2 (although it is), but it does prove that it is ''at most''&nbsp;2.  In other words, the series has an upper bound. Given that the series converges, proving that it is equal to 2 requires only elementary algebra. If the series is denoted {{math|''S''}}, it can be seen that\n\n:<math>S/2 = \\frac{1+ \\frac{1}{2}+ \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{8}+\\cdots}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}+ \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{8}+ \\frac{1}{16} +\\cdots.</math>\n\nTherefore,\n\n:<math>S-S/2 = 1 \\Rightarrow S = 2.</math>\n\nThe idiom can be extended to other, equivalent notions of series. For instance, a [[Repeating decimal|recurring decimal]], as in\n\n:<math>x = 0.111\\dots </math>,\n\nencodes the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{10^n}.</math>\n\nSince these series always converge to [[real numbers]] (because of what is called the [[Complete space|completeness property]] of the real numbers), to talk about the series in this way is the same as to talk about the numbers for which they stand.  In particular, the decimal expansion 0.111... can be identified with <sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub>.  This leads to an argument that {{nowrap|1=9 \u00d7 0.111... = 0.999... = 1}}, which only relies on the fact that the limit laws for series preserve the arithmetic operations; this argument is presented in the article [[0.999...]].\n\n==Examples of numerical series==\n{{For|other examples|List of mathematical series|Sums of reciprocals#Infinitely many terms}}\n* A ''[[geometric series]]'' is one where each successive term is produced by multiplying the previous term by a [[Mathematical constant|constant number]] (called the common ratio in this context).  Example:\n::<math>1 + {1 \\over 2} + {1 \\over 4} + {1 \\over 8} + {1 \\over 16} + \\cdots=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty{1 \\over 2^n}.</math>\n:In general, the geometric series\n::<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty z^n</math>\n:converges [[if and only if]] <math display=\"inline\">|z| < 1</math>.\n* [[Hypergeometric series]]:\n:<math>_rF_s \\left[ \\begin{matrix}a_1, a_2, \\dotsc, a_r \\\\ b_1, b_2, \\dotsc, b_s \\end{matrix}; z \\right] := \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(a_1)_n (a_2)_n \\dotsb (a_r)_n}{(b_1)_n (b_2)_n \\dotsb (b_s)_n \\; n!} z^n</math>\nand their generalizations (such as [[basic hypergeometric series]] and [[elliptic hypergeometric series]]) frequently appear in [[integrable systems]] and [[mathematical physics]].<ref>Gasper, G., Rahman, M. (2004). Basic hypergeometric series.

The value of the series is then ''b''<sub>1</sub> \u2212 ''L''.\n* There are some elementary series whose convergence is not yet known/proven. For example, it is unknown whether the Flint Hills series {{anchor|Flint Hills series|Flint Hills Series}}\n::<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\csc^{2} n}{n^{3}}</math>\n:converges or not. The convergence depends on how well <math>\\pi</math> can be approximated with rational numbers (which is unknown as of yet). More specifically, the values of ''n'' with large numerical contributions to the sum are the numerators of the continued fraction convergents of <math>\\pi</math>, a sequence beginning with 1, 3, 22, 333, 355, 103993, ... {{OEIS|A046947}}. These are integers that are close to <math>n\\pi</math> for some integer ''n'', so that <math>\\sin n\\pi</math> is close to 0 and its reciprocal is large. Alekseyev (2011) proved that if the series converges, then the [[irrationality measure]] of <math>\\pi</math> is smaller than 2.5, which is much smaller than the current known bound of 7.10320533....<ref>Max A.

It is thus a [[unary operation]] on sequences. Further, this function is [[Linear map|linear]], and thus is a [[linear operator]] on the [[vector space]] of sequences, denoted \u03a3. The inverse operator is the [[finite difference]] operator, denoted \u0394. These behave as discrete analogs of [[Integral|integration]] and [[derivative|differentiation]], only for series (functions of a natural number) instead of functions of a real variable. For example, the sequence (1, 1, 1, ...) has series (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) as its partial summation, which is analogous to the fact that <math>\\int_0^x 1\\,dt = x.</math>\n\nIn [[computer science]] it is known as [[prefix sum]].\n\n==Properties of series==\nSeries are classified not only by whether they converge or diverge, but also by the properties of the terms a<sub>n</sub> (absolute or conditional convergence); type of convergence of the series (pointwise, uniform); the class of the term a<sub>n</sub> (whether it is a real number, arithmetic progression, trigonometric function); etc.\n\n===Non-negative terms===\nWhen ''a<sub>n</sub>'' is a non-negative real number for every ''n'', the sequence ''S<sub>N</sub>'' of partial sums is non-decreasing. It follows that a series \u2211''a<sub>n</sub>'' with non-negative terms converges if and only if the sequence ''S<sub>N</sub>'' of partial sums is bounded.\n\nFor example, the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2}</math>\n\nis convergent, because the inequality\n\n:<math>\\frac1 {n^2} \\le \\frac{1}{n-1} - \\frac{1}{n}, \\quad n \\ge 2,</math>\n\nand a telescopic sum argument implies that the partial sums are bounded by 2. The exact value of the original series is the [[Basel problem]].\n\n===Absolute convergence===\n{{Main|Absolute convergence}}\nA series\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n</math>\n''converges absolutely'' if the series of [[absolute value]]s\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\left|a_n\\right|</math>\nconverges. This is sufficient to guarantee not only that the original series converges to a limit, but also that any reordering of it converges to the same limit.\n\n===Conditional convergence===\n{{Main|Conditional convergence}}\nA series of real or complex numbers is said to be '''conditionally convergent''' (or '''semi-convergent''') if it is convergent but not absolutely convergent. A famous example is the alternating series\n\n:<math>\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty {(-1)^{n+1}  \\over n} = 1 - {1 \\over 2} + {1 \\over 3} - {1 \\over 4} + {1 \\over 5} - \\cdots,</math>\n\nwhich is convergent (and its sum is equal to&nbsp;ln&nbsp;2), but the series formed by taking the absolute value of each term is the divergent [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]]. The [[Riemann series theorem]] says that any conditionally convergent series can be reordered to make a divergent series, and moreover, if the ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are real and ''S'' is any real number, that one can find a reordering so that the reordered series converges with sum equal to&nbsp;''S''.\n\n[[Abel's test]] is an important tool for handling semi-convergent series. If a series has the form\n\n:<math>\\sum a_n = \\sum \\lambda_n b_n</math>\n\nwhere the partial sums ''B''<sub>''N''</sub>&nbsp;= {{nowrap|''b''<sub>0</sub> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''b<sub>n</sub>''}} are bounded, ''\u03bb''<sub>''n''</sub> has bounded variation, and {{nowrap|lim \u03bb<sub>''n''</sub>&thinsp;''B''<sub>''n''</sub>}} exists:\n\n:<math>\\sup_N \\Bigl| \\sum_{n=0}^N b_n \\Bigr| < \\infty, \\ \\ \\sum |\\lambda_{n+1} - \\lambda_n| < \\infty\\ \\text{and} \\ \\lambda_n B_n \\ \\text{converges,}</math>\n\nthen the series {{nowrap|\u2211&thinsp;''a<sub>n</sub>''}} is convergent.  This applies to the pointwise convergence of many trigonometric series, as in\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{\\sin(n x)}{\\ln n}</math>\n\nwith 0&nbsp;< ''x''&nbsp;< 2\u03c0.  Abel's method consists in writing ''b''<sub>''n''+1</sub>&nbsp;= ''B''<sub>''n''+1</sub>&nbsp;\u2212 ''B''<sub>''n''</sub>, and in performing a transformation similar to [[integration by parts]] (called [[summation by parts]]), that relates the given series {{nowrap|\u2211&thinsp;''a<sub>n</sub>''}} to the absolutely convergent series\n\n:<math> \\sum (\\lambda_n - \\lambda_{n+1}) \\, B_n.</math>\n\n===Evaluation of truncation errors===\nThe evaluation of truncation errors is an important procedure in [[numerical analysis]] (especially [[validated numerics]] and [[computer-assisted proof]]).\n====[[Alternating series]]====\nWhen conditions of the [[alternating series test]] is satisfied by <math>S:=\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty(-1)^m u_m</math>, there is an exact error evaluation.<ref>[https://www.ck12.org/book/CK-12-Calculus-Concepts/section/9.9/ Positive and Negative Terms: Alternating Series]</ref> Set <math>s_n</math> as the partial sum of the given alternating series <math>S:=\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty(-1)^m u_m</math>.

When the ratio is less than 1, but not less than a constant less than 1, convergence is possible but this test does not establish it.\n* [[Root test]]: If there exists a constant ''C''&nbsp;< 1 such that |''a''<sub>''n''</sub>|<sup>1/''n''</sup>&nbsp;\u2264 ''C'' for all sufficiently large&nbsp;''n'', then \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> converges absolutely.\n* [[Integral test for convergence|Integral test]]: if ''\u0192''(''x'') is a positive [[monotone decreasing]] function defined on the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] <nowiki>[</nowiki>1, \u221e<nowiki>)</nowiki><!--DO NOT \"FIX\" THE \"TYPO\" IN THE FOREGOING.

Such a series converges if the [[sequence]] ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> is [[monotone decreasing]] and converges to&nbsp;0. The converse is in general not true.\n* For some specific types of series there are more specialized convergence tests, for instance for [[Fourier series]] there is the [[Dini test]].\n\n==Series of functions==\n{{Main|Function series}}\nA series of real- or complex-valued functions\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty f_n(x)</math>\n\n'''[[Pointwise convergence|converges pointwise]]''' on a set ''E'', if the series converges for each ''x'' in ''E'' as an ordinary series of real or complex numbers.  Equivalently, the partial sums\n:<math>s_N(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^N f_n(x)</math>\nconverge to ''\u0192''(''x'') as ''N''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e for each ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''E''.\n\nA stronger notion of convergence of a series of functions is called '''[[uniform convergence]]'''.  The series converges uniformly if it converges pointwise to the function ''\u0192''(''x''), and the error in approximating the limit by the ''N''th partial sum,\n:<math>|s_N(x) - f(x)|</math>\ncan be made minimal ''independently'' of ''x'' by choosing a sufficiently large ''N''.\n\nUniform convergence is desirable for a series because many properties of the terms of the series are then retained by the limit.  For example, if a series of continuous functions converges uniformly, then the limit function is also continuous.  Similarly, if the ''\u0192''<sub>''n''</sub> are [[integral|integrable]] on a closed and bounded interval ''I'' and converge uniformly, then the series is also integrable on ''I'' and can be integrated term-by-term. Tests for uniform convergence include the [[Weierstrass M-test|Weierstrass' M-test]], [[Abel's uniform convergence test]], [[Dini's test]], and the [[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy criterion]].\n\nMore sophisticated types of convergence of a series of functions can also be defined.  In [[measure theory]], for instance, a series of functions converges [[almost everywhere]] if it converges pointwise except on a certain set of [[null set|measure zero]].  Other [[modes of convergence]] depend on a different [[metric space]] structure on the space of functions under consideration.  For instance, a series of functions '''converges in mean''' on a set ''E'' to a limit function ''\u0192'' provided\n:<math>\\int_E \\left|s_N(x)-f(x)\\right|^2\\,dx \\to 0</math>\nas ''N''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e.\n\n===Power series===\n:{{Main|Power series}}\n\nA '''power series''' is a series of the form\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n(x-c)^n.</math>\n\nThe [[Taylor series]] at a point ''c'' of a function is a power series that, in many cases, converges to the function in a neighborhood of ''c''. For example, the series\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!}</math>\nis the Taylor series of <math>e^x</math> at the origin and converges to it for every ''x''.\n\nUnless it converges only at ''x''=''c'', such a series converges on a certain open disc of convergence centered at the point ''c'' in the complex plane, and may also converge at some of the points of the boundary of the disc.  The radius of this disc is known as the [[radius of convergence]], and can in principle be determined from the asymptotics of the coefficients ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>.  The convergence is uniform on [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]] (that is, [[compact set|compact]]) subsets of the interior of the disc of convergence: to wit, it is [[Compact convergence|uniformly convergent on compact sets]].\n\nHistorically, mathematicians such as [[Leonhard Euler]] operated liberally with infinite series, even if they were not convergent. When calculus was put on a sound and correct foundation in the nineteenth century, rigorous proofs of the convergence of series were always required.\n\n=== Formal power series ===\n{{main|Formal power series}}\n\nWhile many uses of power series refer to their sums, it is also possible to treat power series as ''formal sums'', meaning that no addition operations are actually performed, and the symbol \"+\" is an abstract symbol of conjunction which is not necessarily interpreted as corresponding to addition. In this setting, the sequence of coefficients itself is of interest, rather than the convergence of the series. Formal power series are used in [[combinatorics]] to describe and study [[sequence]]s that are otherwise difficult to handle, for example, using the method of [[generating function]]s.  The [[Hilbert\u2013Poincar\u00e9 series]] is a formal power series used to study [[graded algebra]]s.\n\nEven if the limit of the power series is not considered, if the terms support appropriate structure then it is possible to define operations such as [[addition]], [[multiplication]], [[derivative]], [[antiderivative]] for power series \"formally\", treating the symbol \"+\" as if it corresponded to addition. In the most common setting, the terms come from a [[commutative ring]], so that the formal power series can be added term-by-term and multiplied via the [[Cauchy product]]. In this case the algebra of formal power series is the [[total algebra]] of the [[monoid]] of [[natural numbers]] over the underlying term ring.<ref>{{citation|author=[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]|title=Algebra|publisher=Springer|year=1989}}: \u00a7III.2.11.</ref>  If the underlying term ring is a [[differential algebra]], then the algebra of formal power series is also a differential algebra, with differentiation performed term-by-term.\n\n===Laurent series===\n{{Main|Laurent series}}\nLaurent series generalize power series by admitting terms into the series with negative as well as positive exponents.  A Laurent series is thus any series of the form\n:<math>\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty a_n x^n.</math>\nIf such a series converges, then in general it does so in an [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] rather than a disc, and possibly some boundary points.  The series converges uniformly on compact subsets of the interior of the annulus of convergence.\n\n===Dirichlet series===\n:{{Main|Dirichlet series}}\n\nA [[Dirichlet series]] is one of the form\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty {a_n \\over n^s},</math>\n\nwhere ''s'' is a [[complex number]].  For example, if all ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are equal to 1, then the Dirichlet series is the [[Riemann zeta function]]\n\n:<math>\\zeta(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^s}.</math>\n\nLike the zeta function, Dirichlet series in general play an important role in [[analytic number theory]].  Generally a Dirichlet series converges if the real part of ''s'' is greater than a number called the abscissa of convergence.  In many cases, a Dirichlet series can be extended to an [[analytic function]] outside the domain of convergence by [[analytic continuation]].  For example, the Dirichlet series for the zeta function converges absolutely when Re&nbsp;''s''&nbsp;> 1, but the zeta function can be extended to a holomorphic function defined on <math>\\mathbf{C}\\setminus\\{1\\}</math>&thinsp; with a simple [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]] at&nbsp;1.\n\nThis series can be directly generalized to [[general Dirichlet series]].\n\n===Trigonometric series===\n{{Main|Trigonometric series}}\nA series of functions in which the terms are [[trigonometric function]]s is called a '''trigonometric series''':\n:<math>\\tfrac12 A_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(A_n\\cos nx + B_n \\sin nx\\right).</math>\nThe most important example of a trigonometric series is the [[Fourier series]] of a function.\n\n==History of the theory of infinite series==\n\n===Development of infinite series===\n[[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematician [[Archimedes]] produced the first known summation of an infinite series with a\nmethod that is still used in the area of calculus today. He used the [[method of exhaustion]] to calculate the [[area]] under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of [[Pi|\u03c0]].<ref>{{cite web | title = A history of calculus |author1=O'Connor, J.J.  |author2=Robertson, E.F.  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher = [[University of St Andrews]]| url = http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/The_rise_of_calculus.html |date=February 1996|accessdate= 2007-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ502088&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ502088|title=Archimedes and Pi-Revisited.|first=Bidwell, James|last=K.|date=30 November 1993|journal=School Science and Mathematics|volume=94|issue=3}}</ref>\n\nMathematicians from Kerala, India studied infinite series around 1350 CE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/article/?id=2962|title=Indians predated Newton 'discovery' by 250 years|author=|date=|website=manchester.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century, [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] worked in the new [[decimal]] system on infinite series and published several [[Maclaurin series]]. In 1715, a general method for constructing the [[Taylor series]] for all functions for which they exist was provided by [[Brook Taylor]]. [[Leonhard Euler]] in the 18th century, developed the theory of [[hypergeometric series]] and [[q-series]].\n\n===Convergence criteria===\nThe investigation of the validity of infinite series is considered to begin with [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in the 19th century. Euler had already considered the hypergeometric series\n\n:<math>1 + \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{1\\cdot\\gamma}x + \\frac{\\alpha(\\alpha+1)\\beta(\\beta+1)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\gamma(\\gamma+1)}x^2 + \\cdots</math>\non which Gauss published a memoir in 1812. It established simpler criteria of convergence, and the questions of remainders and the range of convergence.\n\n[[Cauchy]] (1821) insisted on strict tests of convergence; he showed that if two series are convergent their product is not necessarily so, and with him begins the discovery of effective criteria. The terms ''convergence'' and ''divergence'' had been introduced long before by [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|Gregory]] (1668). [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] had given various criteria, and [[Colin Maclaurin]] had anticipated some of Cauchy's discoveries. Cauchy advanced the theory of [[power series]] by his expansion of a complex [[function (mathematics)|function]] in such a form.\n\n[[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] (1826) in his memoir on the [[binomial series]]\n:<math>1 + \\frac{m}{1!}x + \\frac{m(m-1)}{2!}x^2 + \\cdots</math>\n\ncorrected certain of Cauchy's conclusions, and gave a completely\nscientific summation of the series for complex values of <math>m</math> and <math>x</math>. He showed the necessity of considering the subject of continuity in questions of convergence.\n\nCauchy's methods led to special rather than general criteria, and\nthe same may be said of [[Joseph Ludwig Raabe|Raabe]] (1832), who made the first elaborate\ninvestigation of the subject, of [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] (from 1842), whose\nlogarithmic test [[Paul du Bois-Reymond|DuBois-Reymond]] (1873) and [[Alfred Pringsheim|Pringsheim]] (1889) have\nshown to fail within a certain region; of [[Joseph Louis Fran\u00e7ois Bertrand|Bertrand]] (1842), [[Pierre Ossian Bonnet|Bonnet]]\n(1843), [[Carl Johan Malmsten|Malmsten]] (1846, 1847, the latter without integration);\n[[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] (1847), [[Paucker]] (1852), [[Chebyshev]] (1852), and [[Arndt]]\n(1853).\n\nGeneral criteria began with [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] (1835), and have been\nstudied by [[Gotthold Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] (1847), [[Weierstrass]] in his various\ncontributions to the theory of functions, [[Ulisse Dini|Dini]] (1867),\nDuBois-Reymond (1873), and many others. Pringsheim's memoirs (1889) present the most complete general theory.\n\n===Uniform convergence===\nThe theory of [[uniform convergence]] was treated by Cauchy (1821), his\nlimitations being pointed out by Abel, but the first to attack it\nsuccessfully were [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel|Seidel]] and [[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] (1847\u201348). Cauchy took up the\nproblem again (1853), acknowledging Abel's criticism, and reaching\nthe same conclusions which Stokes had already found. Thomae used the\ndoctrine (1866), but there was great delay in recognizing the\nimportance of distinguishing between uniform and non-uniform\nconvergence, in spite of the demands of the theory of functions.\n\n===Semi-convergence===\nA series is said to be semi-convergent (or conditionally convergent) if it is convergent but not [[absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]].\n\nSemi-convergent series were studied by Poisson (1823), who also gave a general form for the remainder of the Maclaurin formula. The most important solution of the problem is due, however, to Jacobi (1834),\nwho attacked the question of the remainder from a different standpoint and reached a different formula. This expression was also worked out, and another one given, by [[Carl Johan Malmsten|Malmsten]] (1847).  [[Schl\u00f6milch]] (''Zeitschrift'', Vol.I, p.&nbsp;192, 1856) also improved Jacobi's remainder, and showed the relation between the remainder and [[Faulhaber's formula|Bernoulli's function]]\n\n:<math>F(x) = 1^n + 2^n + \\cdots + (x - 1)^n.</math>\n\n[[Angelo Genocchi|Genocchi]] (1852) has further contributed to the theory.\n\nAmong the early writers was [[Josef Hoene-Wronski|Wronski]], whose \"loi supr\u00eame\" (1815) was hardly recognized until [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] (1873) brought it into\nprominence.\n\n===Fourier series===\n[[Fourier series]] were being investigated\nas the result of physical considerations at the same time that\nGauss, Abel, and Cauchy were working out the theory of infinite\nseries. Series for the expansion of sines and cosines, of multiple\narcs in powers of the sine and cosine of the arc had been treated by\n[[Jacob Bernoulli]] (1702) and his brother [[Johann Bernoulli]] (1701) and still\nearlier by [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]]. Euler and [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] simplified the subject,\nas did [[Louis Poinsot|Poinsot]], [[Karl Schr\u00f6ter|Schr\u00f6ter]], [[James Whitbread Lee Glaisher|Glaisher]], and [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]].\n\nFourier (1807) set for himself a different problem, to\nexpand a given function of ''x'' in terms of the sines or cosines of\nmultiples of ''x'', a problem which he embodied in his ''[[Th\u00e9orie analytique de la chaleur]]'' (1822). Euler had already given the\nformulas for determining the coefficients in the series;\nFourier was the first to assert and attempt to prove the general\ntheorem. [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson|Poisson]] (1820\u201323) also attacked the problem from a\ndifferent standpoint. Fourier did not, however, settle the question\nof convergence of his series, a matter left for [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] (1826) to\nattempt and for Dirichlet (1829) to handle in a thoroughly\nscientific manner (see [[convergence of Fourier series]]). Dirichlet's treatment (''[[Journal f\u00fcr die reine und angewandte Mathematik|Crelle]]'', 1829), of trigonometric series was the subject of criticism and improvement by\nRiemann (1854), Heine, [[Rudolf Lipschitz|Lipschitz]], [[Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli|Schl\u00e4fli]], and\n[[Paul du Bois-Reymond|du Bois-Reymond]]. Among other prominent contributors to the theory of\ntrigonometric and Fourier series were [[Ulisse Dini|Dini]], [[Charles Hermite|Hermite]], [[Georges Henri Halphen|Halphen]],\nKrause, Byerly and [[Paul \u00c9mile Appell|Appell]].\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Asymptotic series===\n[[Asymptotic series]], otherwise [[asymptotic expansion]]s, are infinite series whose partial sums become good approximations in the limit of some point of the domain.  In general they do not converge, but they are useful as sequences of approximations, each of which provides a value close to the desired answer for a finite number of terms. The difference is that an asymptotic series cannot be made to produce an answer as exact as desired, the way that convergent series can. In fact, after a certain number of terms, a typical asymptotic series reaches its best approximation; if more terms are included, most such series will produce worse answers.\n\n===Divergent series===\n{{Main|Divergent series}}\nUnder many circumstances, it is desirable to assign a limit to a series which fails to converge in the usual sense.  A [[summability method]] is such an assignment of a limit to a subset of the set of divergent series which properly extends the classical notion of convergence.  Summability methods include [[Ces\u00e0ro summation]], (''C'',''k'') summation, [[Abel summation]], and [[Borel summation]], in increasing order of generality (and hence applicable to increasingly divergent series).\n\nA variety of general results concerning possible summability methods are known.  The [[Silverman\u2013Toeplitz theorem]] characterizes ''matrix summability methods'', which are methods for summing a divergent series by applying an infinite matrix to the vector of coefficients.  The most general method for summing a divergent series is non-constructive, and concerns [[Banach limit]]s.\n\n===Series in topological vector spaces===\nIf ''X'' is a [[Topological Vector Space]] (TVS) and <math>\\left( x_{\\alpha} \\right)_{\\alpha \\in A}</math> is a (possibly [[uncountable]]) family in ''X'' then this family is '''summable'''{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=179-180}} if the limit <math>\\lim_{H \\in \\mathcal{F}(A)} x_{H}</math> of the [[Net (mathematics)|net]] <math>\\left( x_H \\right)_{H \\in \\mathcal{F}(A)}</math> converges in ''X'', where <math>\\mathcal{F}(A)</math> is the [[directed set]] of all finite subsets of ''A'' directed by inclusion <math>\\subseteq</math> and <math>x_H := \\sum_{i \\in H} x_i</math>. \n\nIt is called '''[[absolutely summable]]''' if in addition, for every continuous seminorm ''p'' on ''X'', the family <math>\\left( p \\left( x_{\\alpha} \\right) \\right)_{\\alpha \\in A}</math> is summable.\nIf ''X'' is a normable space and if <math>\\left( x_{\\alpha} \\right)_{\\alpha \\in A}</math> is an absolutely summable family in ''X'', then necessarily all but a countable collection of <math>x_{\\alpha}</math>'s are 0. Hence, in normed spaces, it is usually only ever necessary to consider series with countably many terms. \n\nSummable families play an important role in the theory of [[nuclear space]]s.\n\n====Series in Banach spaces====\nThe notion of series can be easily extended to the case of a [[Banach space]].  If ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> is a sequence of elements of a Banach space ''X'', then the series \u03a3''x''<sub>''n''</sub> converges to ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''X'' if the sequence of partial sums of the series tends to ''x''; to wit,\n:<math>\\biggl\\|x - \\sum_{n=0}^N x_n\\biggr\\|\\to 0</math>\nas ''N''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e.\n\nMore generally, convergence of series can be defined in any [[abelian group|abelian]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]].  Specifically, in this case, \u03a3''x''<sub>''n''</sub> converges to ''x'' if the sequence of partial sums converges to ''x''.\n\n===Summations over arbitrary index sets===\nDefinitions may be given for sums over an arbitrary index set {{math|''I''}}.<ref>{{citation|author=Jean Dieudonn\u00e9|title=Foundations of mathematical analysis|publisher=Academic Press}}</ref>  There are two main differences with the usual notion of series: first, there is no specific order given on the set {{math|''I''}}; second, this set {{math|''I''}} may be uncountable.  The notion of convergence needs to be strengthened, because the concept of [[conditional convergence]] depends on the ordering of the index set.\n\nIf <math>a:I \\mapsto G</math> is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] from an [[index set]] {{math|''I''}} to a set {{math|''G''}}, then the \"series\" associated to <math>a</math> is the [[formal sum]] of the elements <math>a(x) \\in G </math> over the index elements <math>x \\in I</math> denoted by the\n:<math>\\sum_{x \\in I} a(x).</math>\n\nWhen the index set is the natural numbers <math>I=\\mathbb{N}</math>, the function <math>a:\\mathbb{N} \\mapsto G</math> is a [[sequence]] denoted by <math>a(n)=a_n</math>. A series indexed on the natural numbers is an ordered formal sum and so we rewrite <math>\\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}</math> as <math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}</math> in order to emphasize the ordering induced by the natural numbers. Thus, we obtain the common notation for a series indexed by the natural numbers\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots.</math>\n\n====Families of non-negative numbers====\nWhen summing a family {''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}, ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'', of non-negative numbers, one may define\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i\\in I}a_i = \\sup \\Bigl\\{ \\sum_{i\\in A}a_i\\,\\big| A \\text{ finite, } A \\subset I\\Bigr\\} \\in [0, +\\infty].</math>\n\nWhen the supremum is finite, the set of ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'' such that ''a<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;> 0 is countable.

It follows that the finite partial sums of an unconditionally summable family ''a<sub>i</sub>'', ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'', form a ''Cauchy net'', that is, for every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''<sub>0</sub> of ''I''&thinsp; such that\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i \\in A_1} a_i - \\sum_{i \\in A_2} a_i \\in W, \\quad A_1, A_2 \\supset A_0.</math>\n\nWhen ''X''&thinsp; is [[Complete metric space|complete]], a family ''a'' is unconditionally summable in ''X''&thinsp; if and only if the finite sums satisfy the latter Cauchy net condition. When ''X''&thinsp; is complete and ''a<sub>i</sub>'', ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'', is unconditionally summable in ''X'', then for every subset ''J''&nbsp;\u2282 ''I'', the corresponding subfamily ''a<sub>j</sub>'', ''j''&nbsp;\u2208 ''J'', is also unconditionally summable in ''X''.\n\nWhen the sum of a family of non-negative numbers, in the extended sense defined before, is finite, then it coincides with the sum in the topological group ''X''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''R'''.\n\nIf a family ''a'' in ''X''&thinsp; is unconditionally summable, then for every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''<sub>0</sub> of ''I''&thinsp; such that ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;\u2208 ''W''&thinsp; for every ''i'' not in ''A''<sub>0</sub>.  If ''X''&thinsp; is [[first-countable space|first-countable]], it follows that the set of ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I''&thinsp; such that ''a<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;\u2260 0 is countable.  This need not be true in a general abelian topological group (see examples below).\n\n====Unconditionally convergent series====\nSuppose that ''I''&nbsp;= '''N'''.  If a family ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''n''&nbsp;\u2208 '''N''', is unconditionally summable in an abelian Hausdorff topological group ''X'', then the series in the usual sense converges and has the same sum,\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbf{N}} a_n.</math>\n\nBy nature, the definition of unconditional summability is insensitive to the order of the summation.  When \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> is unconditionally summable, then the series remains convergent after any permutation ''\u03c3'' of the set '''N''' of indices, with the same sum,\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_{\\sigma(n)} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n.</math>\n\nConversely, if every permutation of a series \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> converges, then the series is unconditionally convergent.  When ''X''&thinsp; is complete, then unconditional convergence is also equivalent to the fact that all subseries are convergent; if ''X''&thinsp; is a Banach space, this is equivalent to say that for every sequence of signs ''\u03b5''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;= \u00b11<!-- this is not about convergence of functions, even less about uniform convergence. -->, the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\varepsilon_n a_n</math>\n\nconverges in ''X''.  If ''X''&thinsp; is a Banach space, then one may define the notion of absolute convergence.  A series \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> of vectors in ''X''&thinsp; converges absolutely if\n\n:<math> \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbf{N}} \\|a_n\\| < +\\infty.</math>\n\nIf a series of vectors in a Banach space converges absolutely then it converges unconditionally, but the converse only holds in finite-dimensional Banach spaces (theorem of {{harvtxt|Dvoretzky|Rogers|1950}}).\n\n====Well-ordered sums====\nConditionally convergent series can be considered if ''I'' is a [[well-ordered]] set, for example, an [[ordinal number]] ''\u03b1''<sub>0</sub>.  One may define by [[transfinite recursion]]:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\beta < \\alpha + 1} a_\\beta = a_{\\alpha} + \\sum_{\\beta < \\alpha} a_\\beta</math>\n\nand for a limit ordinal ''\u03b1'',\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\beta < \\alpha} a_\\beta = \\lim_{\\gamma\\to\\alpha} \\sum_{\\beta < \\gamma} a_\\beta</math>\n\nif this limit exists.  If all limits exist up to ''\u03b1''<sub>0</sub>, then the series converges.\n\n====Examples====\n\n{{ordered list\n|1= Given a function ''f''&nbsp;: ''X''\u2192''Y'', with ''Y'' an abelian topological group, define for every ''a''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''X''\n\n:<math>f_a(x)=\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & x\\neq a, \\\\\nf(a) & x=a, \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\na function whose [[support (mathematics)|support]] is a [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] {''a''}.  Then\n\n:<math>f=\\sum_{a \\in X}f_a</math>\n\nin the [[topology of pointwise convergence]] (that is, the sum is taken in the infinite product group ''Y''<sup>''X''&nbsp;</sup>).\n\n|2= In the definition of [[partitions of unity]], one constructs sums of functions over arbitrary index set ''I'',\n\n:<math> \\sum_{i \\in I} \\varphi_i(x) = 1.</math>\n\nWhile, formally, this requires a notion of sums of uncountable series, by construction there are, for every given ''x'', only finitely many nonzero terms in the sum, so issues regarding convergence of such sums do not arise.  Actually, one usually assumes more: the family of functions is ''locally finite'', that is, for every ''x'' there is a neighborhood of ''x'' in which all but a finite number of functions vanish.  Any regularity property of the ''\u03c6<sub>i</sub>'',&thinsp; such as continuity, differentiability, that is preserved under finite sums will be preserved for the sum of any subcollection of this family of functions.\n\n|3= On the [[first uncountable ordinal]] \u03c9<sub>1</sub> viewed as a topological space in the [[order topology]], the constant function ''f'': [0,\u03c9<sub>1</sub>) \u2192 [0,\u03c9<sub>1</sub>] given by ''f''(\u03b1) = 1 satisfies\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\alpha\\in[0,\\omega_1)}f(\\alpha) = \\omega_1</math>\n\n(in other words, \u03c9<sub>1</sub> copies of 1 is \u03c9<sub>1</sub>) only if one takes a limit over all ''countable'' partial sums, rather than finite partial sums.  This space is not separable.\n}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Continued fraction]]\n* [[Convergence tests]]\n* [[Convergent series]]\n* [[Divergent series]]\n* [[Infinite compositions of analytic functions]]\n* [[Infinite expression (mathematics)|Infinite expression]]\n* [[Infinite product]]\n* [[Iterated binary operation]]\n* [[List of mathematical series]]\n* [[Prefix sum]]\n* [[Sequence transformation]]\n* [[Series expansion]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Thomas John I'Anson Bromwich|Bromwich, T.

She works in an upscale restaurant where her boss mistreats her, her boss's boyfriend sexually assaults her, and various men forcefully solicit her for sexual favors.

However after the departure of [[Alcoa]], the economy depended on the exports of [[Petroleum| Crude oil]] and [[gold]]. [[Suriname]] was ranked the 124th safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk rankings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Euromoney Country Risk|url=http://www.euromoneycountryrisk.com/|work=Euromoney Country Risk|publisher=Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC|accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Bauxite ==\n[[File:En explore explore tree map hs export sur all show 2012.png|thumb|left|Export Trading Treemap of 2012]]\nThe backbone of Suriname's economy is the export of [[aluminium oxide]] (alumina) and small amounts of [[aluminium]] produced from [[bauxite]] mined in the country. In 1999, the [[aluminium]] [[smelter]] at [[Paranam]] was closed<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.alcoa.com/suriname/en/info_page/home.asp | title=Alcoa in Surinam | publisher=Alcoa | accessdate=2013-04-21}}</ref> and mining at [[Onverdacht]] ceased; however, alumina exports accounted for 72% of Suriname's estimated export earnings of [[US dollar|US$]]496.6 million in 2001. Suriname's bauxite deposits have been among the world's richest.\n\nInexpensive power costs are Suriname's big advantage in the energy-intensive alumina and aluminium business. In the 1960s, the Aluminum Company of America ([[Alcoa]]) built the US$150-million Afobaka Dam<ref>{{cite web | url=http://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-1351582&fid=4449&c=suriname | title=Afobaka Dam: Suriname | publisher=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Bethesda, MD, USA | accessdate=2013-04-21}}</ref> for the production of [[hydroelectric]] energy. This created the [[Brokopondo Reservoir]] a 1,560&nbsp;km\u00b2 lake, one of the largest artificial lakes in the world.\n\n===West Suriname Plan===\n{{Main|West Suriname Plan}}\nIn 1976\u20131977, a 100&nbsp;km long single track [[railway]] was constructed by [[Washington Group International#Morrison Knudsen Co.|Morrison-Knudsen Co.]] in West Suriname from the bauxite containing [[Bakhuis Mountains]] to the town of [[Apoera]] on the [[Courantyne River|Corantijn river]], to transport bauxite by river to processing plants elsewhere. The construction of this railway was financially funded by the Dutch government's independence/severance payments after November 25, 1975. After completion of this railway and associated facilities, for political and economical reasons it was never actually used and was left to be overgrown by the [[jungle]]. Also plans to construct a dam in the [[Kabalebo River]] were developed but never fully executed.\n\nIn 1984, {{Ill|SURALCO|Suralco|nl}}, a subsidiary of [[Alcoa]], formed a [[joint venture]] with the (at that time) [[Royal Dutch Shell]]-owned [[Billiton]] Company, which did not process the bauxite it mined in Suriname. Under this agreement, both companies share risks and profits.\n\nThe major mining sites at [[Moengo]] and [[Lelydorp]] are maturing, and it is now estimated that their reserves will be depleted by 2006. Other proven reserves exist in the east, west, and north of the country sufficient to last until 2045. However, distance and [[topography]] make their immediate development costly. In October 2002, Alcoa and [[BHP Billiton]] signed a letter of intent as the basis for new joint ventures between the two companies, in which Alcoa will take part for 55% in all bauxite mining activities in West Suriname. The government and the companies are looking into cost-effective ways to develop the new mines. The preeminence of bauxite and ALCOA's continued presence in Suriname is a key element in the U.S.-Suriname economic relationship.\n\n== Gold mining ==\nThere is one large scale gold mine operating in Suriname. This is the [[Rosebel Gold Mine]]. Development of a second large scale mine called the Merian Gold Project was approved by the government of Suriname on June 7, 2013. This mining project would be a partnership of [[Newmont Mining Corporation]] and [[Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals]].

The teacher's training started February 2013 and is aimed at preparing them for the fieldwork. The duties of the teachers will be to provide hands-on training on the goldfields to small-scale gold miners. The teachers begin with prospecting and showing the small-scale miners more efficient ways to mine in their areas. Along the way they promote mercury free production methods. The Management of Ordening Goudsector hypothesizes that showing small-scale gold miners the benefits of new production methods will be the incentive itself to start the training programs.\n\n<ref name=\"dwtonline.com\"/>\n\n;Entrepreneurial Credit Fund\n\nThe Ministry of Finance initiated a credit fund in March 2013 for small and medium scale entrepreneurs.

However it is important to note that data show that the interesting area to mine, especially for the small-scale miners who look for alluvial gold, is the [[Greenstone belt]]. The greenstone runs from Guyana, through Suriname, into French Guyana. This greenstone belt, however, only counts for 15% of the Surinamese surface. At the moment almost all areas in this belt are already given out in concessions.\n\n== Foreign aid ==\nAfter the return to a more or less democratically elected government in 1991, Dutch aid resumed. The Dutch relationship continues to be an important factor in the economy, with the Dutch insisting that Suriname undertake economic reforms and produce specific plans acceptable to the Dutch for projects on which aid funds could be spent. In 2000, however, the Dutch revised the structure of their aid package and signaled to the Surinamese authorities their decision to disburse aid by sectoral priorities as opposed to individual projects. Although the present government is not in favor of this approach, it has identified sectors and is now working on sectoral analyses to present to the Dutch.\n\nAfter a short respite in 1991\u20131996, when measures taken in 1993 led to economic stabilization, a relatively stable exchange rate, low [[inflation]], sustainable fiscal policies, and growth, Suriname's economic situation deteriorated from 1996 to the present. This was due in large part to loose fiscal policies of the Wijdenbosch government, which, in the face of lower Dutch development aid, financed its deficit through credit extended by the central bank. As a consequence, the parallel market for foreign exchange soared so that by the end of 1998, the premium of the parallel market rate over the official rate was 85%. Since over 90% of import transactions took place at the parallel rate, inflation took off, with 12-month inflation growing from 0.5% at the end of 1996, to 23% at the end of 1998, and 113% at the end of 1999. The government also instituted a regime of stringent economic controls over prices, the exchange rate, imports, and exports, in an effort to contain the adverse efforts of its economic policies. The cumulative impact of soaring inflation, an unstable exchange rate, and falling real incomes led to a political crisis.\n\nDutch aid stopped to a large extent after [[D\u00e9si Bouterse]] was elected president. Aid from [[China]] has increased.<ref>{{cite news |title=With Aid and Migrants, China Expands Its Presence in a South American Nation |author= [[Simon Romero]]  |date= April 10, 2011 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/11/world/americas/11suriname.html?_r=3&ref=global-home& |accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\nSuriname elected a new government in May 2000, but until it was replaced, the [[Wijdenbosch]] government continued its loose fiscal and monetary policies. By the time it left office, the exchange rate in the [[parallel market]] had depreciated further, over 10% of [[GDP]] had been borrowed to finance the fiscal deficit, and there was a significant [[monetary overhang]] in the country. The new government dealt with these problems by devaluing the official exchange rate by 88%, eliminating all other exchange rates except the parallel market rate set by the banks and cambios, raising tariffs on water and electricity, and eliminating the [[subsidy]] on [[gasoline]]. The new administration also rationalized the extensive list of price controls to 12 basic food items. More important, the government ceased all financing from the [[central bank]]. It is attempting to broaden its economic base, establish better contacts with other nations and international financial institutions, and reduce its dependence on Dutch assistance. However, to date the government has yet to implement an investment law or to begin [[privatization]] of any of the 110 parastatal, nor has it given much indication that it has developed a comprehensive plan to develop the economy.\n\n== Oil ==\n[[Oil]] is a promising sector.

Pending implementation of these wage increases and concerned that the government may be unable to meet these increased expenses, the local currency weakened from Sf 2200 in January 2002 to nearly Sf 2500 in April 2002. On March 26, 2003, the [[Central Bank of Suriname]] (CBvS) adjusted the [[exchange rate]] of the U.S. dollar. This action resulted in further devaluation of the [[Surinamese guilder]]. The official exchange rate of the US$ was SF 2,650 for selling and SF 2,600 for purchasing. With the official exchange rate, the CBvS came closer to the exchange rate on the parallel market which sold the U.S. dollar for SF 3,250.\n\nFrom 2011: [[Surinamese dollar]] (SRD) = 100 cent; USD 1.00 is ca.

The same applies for \"currency notes\" (SRG 1 and 2.50).\n\nSurinamese guilders per US dollar - 2,346.75 (2002), 2,178.5 (2001), 1,322.47 (2000), 859.44 (1999), 401 (1998) <br>\nNote: during 1998, the exchange rate splintered into four distinct rates;

However after the departure of [[Alcoa]], the economy depended on the exports of [[Petroleum| Crude oil]] and [[gold]]. [[Suriname]] was ranked the 124th safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk rankings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Euromoney Country Risk|url=http://www.euromoneycountryrisk.com/|work=Euromoney Country Risk|publisher=Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC|accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Bauxite ==\n[[File:En explore explore tree map hs export sur all show 2012.png|thumb|left|Export Trading Treemap of 2012]]\nThe backbone of Suriname's economy is the export of [[aluminium oxide]] (alumina) and small amounts of [[aluminium]] produced from [[bauxite]] mined in the country. In 1999, the [[aluminium]] [[smelter]] at [[Paranam]] was closed<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.alcoa.com/suriname/en/info_page/home.asp | title=Alcoa in Surinam | publisher=Alcoa | accessdate=2013-04-21}}</ref> and mining at [[Onverdacht]] ceased; however, alumina exports accounted for 72% of Suriname's estimated export earnings of [[US dollar|US$]]496.6 million in 2001. Suriname's bauxite deposits have been among the world's richest.\n\nInexpensive power costs are Suriname's big advantage in the energy-intensive alumina and aluminium business. In the 1960s, the Aluminum Company of America ([[Alcoa]]) built the US$150-million Afobaka Dam<ref>{{cite web | url=http://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-1351582&fid=4449&c=suriname | title=Afobaka Dam: Suriname | publisher=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Bethesda, MD, USA | accessdate=2013-04-21}}</ref> for the production of [[hydroelectric]] energy. This created the [[Brokopondo Reservoir]] a 1,560&nbsp;km\u00b2 lake, one of the largest artificial lakes in the world.\n\n===West Suriname Plan===\n{{Main|West Suriname Plan}}\nIn 1976\u20131977, a 100&nbsp;km long single track [[railway]] was constructed by [[Washington Group International#Morrison Knudsen Co.|Morrison-Knudsen Co.]] in West Suriname from the bauxite containing [[Bakhuis Mountains]] to the town of [[Apoera]] on the [[Courantyne River|Corantijn river]], to transport bauxite by river to processing plants elsewhere. The construction of this railway was financially funded by the Dutch government's independence/severance payments after November 25, 1975. After completion of this railway and associated facilities, for political and economical reasons it was never actually used and was left to be overgrown by the [[jungle]]. Also plans to construct a dam in the [[Kabalebo River]] were developed but never fully executed.\n\nIn 1984, {{Ill|SURALCO|Suralco|nl}}, a subsidiary of [[Alcoa]], formed a [[joint venture]] with the (at that time) [[Royal Dutch Shell]]-owned [[Billiton]] Company, which did not process the bauxite it mined in Suriname. Under this agreement, both companies share risks and profits.\n\nThe major mining sites at [[Moengo]] and [[Lelydorp]] are maturing, and it is now estimated that their reserves will be depleted by 2006. Other proven reserves exist in the east, west, and north of the country sufficient to last until 2045. However, distance and [[topography]] make their immediate development costly. In October 2002, Alcoa and [[BHP Billiton]] signed a letter of intent as the basis for new joint ventures between the two companies, in which Alcoa will take part for 55% in all bauxite mining activities in West Suriname. The government and the companies are looking into cost-effective ways to develop the new mines. The preeminence of bauxite and ALCOA's continued presence in Suriname is a key element in the U.S.-Suriname economic relationship.\n\n== Gold mining ==\nThere is one large scale gold mine operating in Suriname. This is the [[Rosebel Gold Mine]]. Development of a second large scale mine called the Merian Gold Project was approved by the government of Suriname on June 7, 2013.

The teacher's training started February 2013 and is aimed at preparing them for the fieldwork. The duties of the teachers will be to provide hands-on training on the goldfields to small-scale gold miners. The teachers begin with prospecting and showing the small-scale miners more efficient ways to mine in their areas. Along the way they promote mercury free production methods. The Management of Ordening Goudsector hypothesizes that showing small-scale gold miners the benefits of new production methods will be the incentive itself to start the training programs.\n\n<ref name=\"dwtonline.com\"/>\n\n;Entrepreneurial Credit Fund\n\nThe Ministry of Finance initiated a credit fund in March 2013 for small and medium scale entrepreneurs.

However it is important to note that data show that the interesting area to mine, especially for the small-scale miners who look for alluvial gold, is the [[Greenstone belt]]. The greenstone runs from Guyana, through Suriname, into French Guyana. This greenstone belt, however, only counts for 15% of the Surinamese surface. At the moment almost all areas in this belt are already given out in concessions.\n\n== Foreign aid ==\nAfter the return to a more or less democratically elected government in 1991, Dutch aid resumed. The Dutch relationship continues to be an important factor in the economy, with the Dutch insisting that Suriname undertake economic reforms and produce specific plans acceptable to the Dutch for projects on which aid funds could be spent. In 2000, however, the Dutch revised the structure of their aid package and signaled to the Surinamese authorities their decision to disburse aid by sectoral priorities as opposed to individual projects. Although the present government is not in favor of this approach, it has identified sectors and is now working on sectoral analyses to present to the Dutch.\n\nAfter a short respite in 1991\u20131996, when measures taken in 1993 led to economic stabilization, a relatively stable exchange rate, low [[inflation]], sustainable fiscal policies, and growth, Suriname's economic situation deteriorated from 1996 to the present. This was due in large part to loose fiscal policies of the Wijdenbosch government, which, in the face of lower Dutch development aid, financed its deficit through credit extended by the central bank. As a consequence, the parallel market for foreign exchange soared so that by the end of 1998, the premium of the parallel market rate over the official rate was 85%. Since over 90% of import transactions took place at the parallel rate, inflation took off, with 12-month inflation growing from 0.5% at the end of 1996, to 23% at the end of 1998, and 113% at the end of 1999. The government also instituted a regime of stringent economic controls over prices, the exchange rate, imports, and exports, in an effort to contain the adverse efforts of its economic policies. The cumulative impact of soaring inflation, an unstable exchange rate, and falling real incomes led to a political crisis.\n\nDutch aid stopped to a large extent after [[D\u00e9si Bouterse]] was elected president. Aid from [[China]] has increased.<ref>{{cite news |title=With Aid and Migrants, China Expands Its Presence in a South American Nation |author= [[Simon Romero]]  |date= April 10, 2011 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/11/world/americas/11suriname.html?_r=3&ref=global-home& |accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\nSuriname elected a new government in May 2000, but until it was replaced, the [[Wijdenbosch]] government continued its loose fiscal and monetary policies. By the time it left office, the exchange rate in the [[parallel market]] had depreciated further, over 10% of [[GDP]] had been borrowed to finance the fiscal deficit, and there was a significant [[monetary overhang]] in the country. The new government dealt with these problems by devaluing the official exchange rate by 88%, eliminating all other exchange rates except the parallel market rate set by the banks and cambios, raising tariffs on water and electricity, and eliminating the [[subsidy]] on [[gasoline]]. The new administration also rationalized the extensive list of price controls to 12 basic food items. More important, the government ceased all financing from the [[central bank]]. It is attempting to broaden its economic base, establish better contacts with other nations and international financial institutions, and reduce its dependence on Dutch assistance. However, to date the government has yet to implement an investment law or to begin [[privatization]] of any of the 110 parastatal, nor has it given much indication that it has developed a comprehensive plan to develop the economy.\n\n== Oil ==\n[[Oil]] is a promising sector.

Pending implementation of these wage increases and concerned that the government may be unable to meet these increased expenses, the local currency weakened from Sf 2200 in January 2002 to nearly Sf 2500 in April 2002. On March 26, 2003, the [[Central Bank of Suriname]] (CBvS) adjusted the [[exchange rate]] of the U.S. dollar. This action resulted in further devaluation of the [[Surinamese guilder]]. The official exchange rate of the US$ was SF 2,650 for selling and SF 2,600 for purchasing. With the official exchange rate, the CBvS came closer to the exchange rate on the parallel market which sold the U.S. dollar for SF 3,250.\n\nFrom 2011: [[Surinamese dollar]] (SRD) = 100 cent; USD 1.00 is ca. SRD 3.20 (May 2011)\n\nFrom 2004 to 2011: [[Surinamese dollar]] (SRD) = 100 cent; USD 1.00 is ca.

The same applies for \"currency notes\" (SRG 1 and 2.50).\n\nSurinamese guilders per US dollar - 2,346.75 (2002), 2,178.5 (2001), 1,322.47 (2000), 859.44 (1999), 401 (1998) <br>\nNote: during 1998, the exchange rate splintered into four distinct rates; in January 1999 the government floated the guilder, but subsequently fixed it when the black-market rate plunged; the government then allowed trading within a band of SRG 500 around the official rate\n\n== Statistics ==\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1990\u20132017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=46&pr.y=8&sy=1990&ey=2017&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=366&s=NGDP_RPCH%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPPC%2CPCPIPCH%2CGGXWDG_NGDP&grp=0&a=|accessdate=2018-09-20|language=en-US}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Year\n!1990\n!1995\n!2000\n!2005\n!2006\n!2007\n!2008\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n!2013\n!2014\n!2015\n!2016\n!2017\n|-\n|GDP in $<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|2.71 Bln.\n|2.78 Bln.\n|3.63 Bln.\n|5.31 Bln.\n|5.79 Bln.\n|6.24 Bln.\n|6.63 Bln.\n|6.88 Bln.\n|7.33 Bln.\n|7.91 Bln.\n|8.28 Bln.\n|8.66 Bln.\n|8.84 Bln.\n|8.70 Bln.\n|8.36 Bln.\n|8.51 Bln.\n|-\n|GDP per capita in $<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|6,644\n|6,348\n|7,783\n|10,647\n|11,476\n|12,243\n|12,823\n|13,130\n|13,792\n|14,658\n|15,282\n|15,734\n|15,812\n|15,334\n|14,539\n|14,606\n|-\n|GDP growth<br /><small>(real)</small>\n|\u22121.5 %\n|11.3 %\n|\u22120.1 %\n|4.9 %\n|5.8 %\n|5.1 %\n|4.1 %\n|3.0 %\n|5.2 %\n|5.8 %\n|2.7 %\n|2.9 %\n|0.3 %\n|\u22122.6 %\n|\u22125.1 %\n|0.0 %\n|-\n|Inflation<br /><small>(in Percent)</small>\n|21.8 %\n|24.2 %\n|29.6 %\n|14.0 %\n|11.3 %\n|6.4 %\n|14.7 %\n|\u22120.3 %\n|6.9 %\n|17.7 %\n|5.0 %\n|1.9 %\n|3.4 %\n|6.9 %\n|55.5 %\n|22.0 %\n|-\n|Debt/GDP<br /><small>(in Percent)</small>\n|78 %\n|17 %\n|38 %\n|29 %\n|24 %\n|17 %\n|16 %\n|16 %\n|18 %\n|20 %\n|21 %\n|30 %\n|26 %\n|43 %\n|76 %\n|72 %\n|}\n\n*Industrial production growth rate: 6.5% (1994 est.)\n*Electricity \u2013 production: 1.58 billion [[kWh]] (2008)\n*Electricity \u2013 production by source:\n*Electricity \u2013 consumption: 1.44 billion kWh (2008)\n**exports: 0 kWh (1998)\n**imports: 0 kWh (1998)\n*Agriculture - products: paddy [[rice]], [[banana]]s, palm kernels, [[coconut]]s, [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, [[peanut]]s; [[beef]], [[chicken]]s; forest products; [[shrimp]]\n*There are no Patent Laws in Suriname.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billanderson.com.au/Gazetteer-Patents.htm|title=Gazetteer - Patents|website=Billanderson.com.au|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n* [[Surinamese dollar]]\n* [[Economy of South America]]\n* [[Central Bank of Suriname]]\n* [[Central banks and currencies of the Caribbean]]\n* [[Dutch Caribbean Securities Exchange]]\n* [[List of countries by credit rating]]\n* [[List of countries by public debt]]\n{{Col-2}}\n* [[List of Latin American and Caribbean countries by GDP growth]]\n* [[List of Latin American and Caribbean countries by GDP (nominal)]]\n* [[List of Latin American and Caribbean countries by GDP (PPP)]]\n* [[List of countries by tax revenue as percentage of GDP]]\n* [[List of countries by future gross government debt]]\n* [[List of countries by leading trade partners]]\n{{Col-end}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/11/world/americas/11suriname.html?_r=2&ref=global-home& With Aid and Migrants, China Expands Its Presence in a South American Nation] in ''The New York Times'' by [[Simon Romero]] published April 10, 2011\n*[http://amazonteam.org/maps/suriname-gold Amazon Gold Rush: Gold Mining in Suriname web map], published October 12, 2015\n\n{{Suriname topics}}\n{{Caricom}}\n{{SACN}}\n{{Americas topic|Economy of}}\n{{World Trade Organization}}\n\n[[Category:World Trade Organization member economies|Suriname]]\n[[Category:Economy of Suriname| ]]\n", "name_user": "KittenKlub", "label": "safe", "comment": "wikilink", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Suriname"}
