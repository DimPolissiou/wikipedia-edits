In October 1950, a group of 21 missionaries arrived in Tubuai including Hanks's brother.<ref name=\"Unto the islands\" />{{rp|15\u201317}} Missionary success did not last for long, however, since France placed restrictions on religious freedom in French Polynesia that resulted in the mission closing in May 1852.<ref name=\"French Poly newsroom\"/>\n\n===Missionaries return to French Polynesia: 1892 to 1946===\nAfter the missionaries left French Polynesia, church members faced harassment from some government officials and members of the Catholic Church. In 1867, general religious toleration was established in Polynesia which eventually led to the return of missionaries in the territory.<ref name=\"Unto the islands\" />{{rp|21}} In 1892, missionaries were able to return to the islands.<ref name=\"French Poly newsroom\" /> Joseph W. Damron and William A. Seegmiller were the missionaries who were assigned to return to the islands. They found that many of the members who had joined the church in the mid-1800s had fallen away.<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" /> Joseph F. Smith, counselor in the First Presidency, called James S. Brown, who was Pratt's mission companion in 1849, to be the new mission president when it reopened.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Giant of the Lord: Life of a Pioneer|last=Brown|first=James|publisher=Bookcraft, Inc.|year=1960|isbn=|location=SLC UT|pages=496-503}}</ref> Brown accepted. Upon his arrival to the islands, he discovered that there were some members who had remained faithful but that many had joined the [[Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. Eventually, Brown and the missionaries who accompanied him were successful in re-baptizing many Tahitians into the LDS Church. \n\nMissionaries in this time worked to create more branches and construct church buildings. In July 1893, Brown turned the leadership of the mission over to Joseph W. Damron. After Damron served as president, Daniel T. Miller was called and was instrumental in translating church materials into Tahitian. Under his direction <ref name=\"Unto the islands\" />{{rp|29}} The [[Book of Mormon]] was translated into Tahitian and finished on July 7, 1899, and was published in 1904.<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" /> Miller decided to send missionaries to [[Moorea]] and the [[Leeward Islands]] of the Society Islands.<ref name=\"Unto the islands\" />{{rp|35}} Missionaries had a headquarters at Tuamotu until a new mission home was opened in October 1906 in Papeete.<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" /> In 1907 the mission, which had been known as the Society Islands Mission, was renamed the Tahitian Mission.<ref name=\"Tahition mission presidents\" />\n\nChurch members were visited by Elder [[David O. McKay]] who was a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] at the time and Hugh J. Cannon on April 11, 1921.<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" /> He encouraged missionaries to get the members involved, suggested that the mission have a boat for transportation, and that the missionaries stop living with members and go live with people on islands who had not yet been exposed to the church.<ref name=\"Unto the islands\" />{{rp|56}} During World War II all foreign missionaries were recalled, and church members were asked to fulfill leadership positions that the foreign missionaries had held until they were able to return in June 1946.<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" />\n\nDuring this time period missionaries faced difficulties like the depression, World War II, a limited population, and sprawled islands. Much of their time was spent in transportation between islands and, therefore, they did not visit the people from house-to-house as is typical of Mormon missionary work. Instead, they sold mission newspapers, directed plays, held conferences, performed service, and supervised local members. Between 1920 and 1940, 12 chapels were built.<ref name=\"Unto the islands\" />{{rp|54\u201355}}\n\n===Church expansion since the mid 1900s===\n[[Matthew Cowley]] dedicated a meetinghouse and a new mission home in Papeete just four years later on January 22, 1950. Later that same year, the church purchased a two-masted schooner that was used to aid in transporting missionaries and members from the various islands in French Polynesia.<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" /> The boat was called ''Paraita'' which was the Tahitian name for Addison Pratt. The schooner was scheduled to take a group of members to [[Hawaii]] to visit the temple. President McKay instructed the members to cancel the trip in 1959. The boat sank a few days later and never would have made the trip.<ref name=\"Unto the islands\" />{{rp|69}} In 1963, the church experienced a tragedy when a boat that was transporting members back to [[Maupiti]] crashed. 15 church members were killed.<ref>{{cite web|title=LDS Statistics and Church Facts {{!}} Total Church Membership|url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics/country/french-polynesia|website=Mormon Newsroom|accessdate=2017-10-21|language=en}}</ref>\n\nMissionaries began teaching the French-speaking population beginning in 1955. The first French-speaking branch began in October 1957.<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" /> The [[Hamilton New Zealand Temple]] was completed in 1958 and members of the church were able to travel there. An elementary school was built by the church in 1964 in Tahiti.<ref name=\"French Poly newsroom\" /> In 1972 the first [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake]] was organized in French Polynesia in Tahiti by President [[Spencer W. Kimball]],<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" /> and by 1983 the [[Papeete Tahiti Temple]] was finished and dedicated.<ref name=\"French Poly newsroom\" /> The stake met in the meetinghouse that had been dedicated by Cowley.<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" /> The church continued to grow there and Tahiti had its second stake created in 1982, followed by a third one in 1990.<ref name=\"French Poly newsroom\">{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Richard|title=Facts and Statistics: Statistics by Country: French Polynesia |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics/country/french-polynesia|website=Newsroom|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saings|accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe church operated an LDS school that opened in 1914. It was closed during World War II and reopened in 1964. All classes were offered in French. The school was closed permanently in 1982 and the site later became the ground for the Papeete Temple. The church began offering home-study seminary in the 1970s to high school students.<ref name=\"Unto the islands\" />{{rp|80\u201382}}\n\n===Marquesas Islands===\nIn 1899 the first missionaries, Edgar L. Cropper and Eli Horton, were sent to the [[Marquesas Islands]]. There was little success in proselyting efforts, so missionaries were removed in July 1904. Missionaries were sent to the islands again in 1961 and in the 1980s, but had little success again. In 1991, however, four large families were baptized in Hiva Oa. One of these new converts was Robert O'Conner, who later was called as the branch president of the Marquesas Islands. The church built its first meetinghouse on the islands in 1998.<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" />\n\n==Church relations with government officials==\nBetween 1932 and 1933, the government denied visas to new missionaries. The church was accused of taking too much contribution money from the islands, and the French government did not want the American influence of foreign missionaries. In 1933, however, after a new governor was appointed in French Polynesia, relations with the church improved greatly. This governor even visited Salt Lake City.<ref name=\"Unto the islands\" />{{rp|58\u201359}}\n\nPresident [[Russell M. Nelson]], a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, had the opportunity to meet the territory's president along with the entire cabinet. [[Gordon B. Hinckley]], then president of the church, was welcomed by President [[Gaston Flosse]] to visit the islands in October 1997.<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" /> In January 2000, Flosse, his vice president Edward Fritche, and other government officials attended a dinner that was held by the mission president at the time, Ralph T.

In October 1950, a group of 21 missionaries arrived in Tubuai including Hanks's brother.<ref name=\"Unto the islands\" />{{rp|15\u201317}} Missionary success did not last for long, however, since France placed restrictions on religious freedom in French Polynesia that resulted in the mission closing in May 1852.<ref name=\"French Poly newsroom\"/>\n\n===Missionaries return to French Polynesia: 1892 to 1946===\nAfter the missionaries left French Polynesia, church members faced harassment from some government officials and members of the Catholic Church. In 1867, general religious toleration was established in Polynesia which eventually led to the return of missionaries in the territory.<ref name=\"Unto the islands\" />{{rp|21}} In 1892, missionaries were able to return to the islands.<ref name=\"French Poly newsroom\" /> Joseph W. Damron and William A. Seegmiller were the missionaries who were assigned to return to the islands. They found that many of the members who had joined the church in the mid-1800s had fallen away.<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" /> Joseph F. Smith, counselor in the First Presidency, called James S. Brown, who was Pratt's mission companion in 1849, to be the new mission president when it reopened.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Giant of the Lord: Life of a Pioneer|last=Brown|first=James|publisher=Bookcraft, Inc.|year=1960|isbn=|location=SLC UT|pages=496-503}}</ref> Brown accepted. Upon his arrival to the islands, he discovered that there were some members who had remained faithful but that many had joined the [[Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. Eventually, Brown and the missionaries who accompanied him were successful in re-baptizing many Tahitians into the LDS Church. \n\nMissionaries in this time worked to create more branches and construct church buildings. In July 1893, Brown turned the leadership of the mission over to Joseph W. Damron. After Damron served as president, Daniel T. Miller was called and was instrumental in translating church materials into Tahitian. Under his direction <ref name=\"Unto the islands\" />{{rp|29}} The [[Book of Mormon]] was translated into Tahitian and finished on July 7, 1899, and was published in 1904.<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" /> Miller decided to send missionaries to [[Moorea]] and the [[Leeward Islands]] of the Society Islands.<ref name=\"Unto the islands\" />{{rp|35}} Missionaries had a headquarters at Tuamotu until a new mission home was opened in October 1906 in Papeete.<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" /> In 1907 the mission, which had been known as the Society Islands Mission, was renamed the Tahitian Mission.<ref name=\"Tahition mission presidents\" />\n\nChurch members were visited by Elder [[David O. McKay]] who was a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] at the time and Hugh J. Cannon on April 11, 1921.<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" /> He encouraged missionaries to get the members involved, suggested that the mission have a boat for transportation, and that the missionaries stop living with members and go live with people on islands who had not yet been exposed to the church.<ref name=\"Unto the islands\" />{{rp|56}} During World War II all foreign missionaries were recalled, and church members were asked to fulfill leadership positions that the foreign missionaries had held until they were able to return in June 1946.<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" />\n\nDuring this time period missionaries faced difficulties like the depression, World War II, a limited population, and sprawled islands. Much of their time was spent in transportation between islands and, therefore, they did not visit the people from house-to-house as is typical of Mormon missionary work. Instead, they sold mission newspapers, directed plays, held conferences, performed service, and supervised local members. Between 1920 and 1940, 12 chapels were built.<ref name=\"Unto the islands\" />{{rp|54\u201355}}\n\n===Church expansion since the mid 1900s===\n[[Matthew Cowley]] dedicated a meetinghouse and a new mission home in Papeete just four years later on January 22, 1950. Later that same year, the church purchased a two-masted schooner that was used to aid in transporting missionaries and members from the various islands in French Polynesia.<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" /> The boat was called ''Paraita'' which was the Tahitian name for Addison Pratt. The schooner was scheduled to take a group of members to [[Hawaii]] to visit the temple. President McKay instructed the members to cancel the trip in 1959. The boat sank a few days later and never would have made the trip.<ref name=\"Unto the islands\" />{{rp|69}} In 1963, the church experienced a tragedy when a boat that was transporting members back to [[Maupiti]] crashed. 15 church members were killed.<ref>{{cite web|title=LDS Statistics and Church Facts {{!}} Total Church Membership|url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics/country/french-polynesia|website=Mormon Newsroom|accessdate=2017-10-21|language=en}}</ref>\n\nMissionaries began teaching the French-speaking population beginning in 1955. The first French-speaking branch began in October 1957.<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" /> The [[Hamilton New Zealand Temple]] was completed in 1958 and members of the church were able to travel there. An elementary school was built by the church in 1964 in Tahiti.<ref name=\"French Poly newsroom\" /> In 1972 the first [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake]] was organized in French Polynesia in Tahiti by President [[Spencer W. Kimball]],<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" /> and by 1983 the [[Papeete Tahiti Temple]] was finished and dedicated.<ref name=\"French Poly newsroom\" /> The stake met in the meetinghouse that had been dedicated by Cowley.<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" /> The church continued to grow there and Tahiti had its second stake created in 1982, followed by a third one in 1990.<ref name=\"French Poly newsroom\">{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Richard|title=Facts and Statistics: Statistics by Country: French Polynesia |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics/country/french-polynesia|website=Newsroom|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saings|accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe church operated an LDS school that opened in 1914. It was closed during World War II and reopened in 1964. All classes were offered in French. The school was closed permanently in 1982 and the site later became the ground for the Papeete Temple. The church began offering home-study seminary in the 1970s to high school students.<ref name=\"Unto the islands\" />{{rp|80\u201382}}\n\n===Marquesas Islands===\nIn 1899 the first missionaries, Edgar L. Cropper and Eli Horton, were sent to the [[Marquesas Islands]]. There was little success in proselyting efforts, so missionaries were removed in July 1904. Missionaries were sent to the islands again in 1961 and in the 1980s, but had little success again. In 1991, however, four large families were baptized in Hiva Oa. One of these new converts was Robert O'Conner, who later was called as the branch president of the Marquesas Islands. The church built its first meetinghouse on the islands in 1998.<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" />\n\n==Church relations with government officials==\nBetween 1932 and 1933, the government denied visas to new missionaries. The church was accused of taking too much contribution money from the islands, and the French government did not want the American influence of foreign missionaries. In 1933, however, after a new governor was appointed in French Polynesia, relations with the church improved greatly. This governor even visited Salt Lake City.<ref name=\"Unto the islands\" />{{rp|58\u201359}}\n\nPresident [[Russell M. Nelson]], a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, had the opportunity to meet the territory's president along with the entire cabinet. [[Gordon B. Hinckley]], then president of the church, was welcomed by President [[Gaston Flosse]] to visit the islands in October 1997.<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" /> In January 2000, Flosse, his vice president Edward Fritche, and other government officials attended a dinner that was held by the mission president at the time, Ralph T. Andersen, in the mission home. Each official was also given a copy of [[The Family: A Proclamation to the World]].<ref name=\"French poly pres meets church\">{{cite news|title=French Polynesian president meets with Church leaders|url=https://www.thechurchnews.com/archive/2000-02-26/french-polynesian-president-meets-with-church-leaders-17140|accessdate=24 August 2016|work=Church News|agency=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|date=26 Feb 2000}}</ref> When the presidency of French Polynesia held its inauguration in 2000, a choir of 400 member of the church sang at the ceremony. After attacks on 9/11, a memorial service was held in Papeete in which missionaries who were from the U.S. were invited to sing the national anthem. Afterwards, President Flosse and other officials shook hands with the missionaries.<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" />\n\n==Status today==\n[[File:The Plan of Salvation francais.jpg|thumb|The [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|plan of salvation]] in French]]\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints reported 25,841 members in six [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]], three [[District (Latter Day Saints)|districts]], 90 congregations (54 [[Ward (LDS Church)|wards]] and 29 [[Ward (LDS Church)#Branch|branches]]), one [[Mission (LDS Church)|mission]], and one [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] in [[French Polynesia]].<ref name=\"Church News French Poly\" /><ref name=\"French Poly newsroom\" /> Five percent of the population of French Polynesia is recorded as being members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<ref name=\"Countries and their cultures\">{{cite web|title=French Polynesia|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Cr-Ga/French-Polynesia.html|website=Countries and their Cultures|publisher=Advameg Inc.|accessdate=25 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Missions==\n*[[Tahiti]] [[Papeete]] Mission\n\n===Mission presidents===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Mission President\n! scope=\"col\"| Years of service\n|-\n| Noah Rogers || 1843\u20131845\n|-\n|[[Addison Pratt]] || 1845\u20131847\n|-\n|[[Benjamin Franklin Grouard]] ||1847\u20131850\n|-\n|Addison Pratt ||1849\u20131852\n|-\n|[[James Stephens Brown]] || 1892\u20131893\n|-\n|Frank Cutler || 1895\u20131896\n|-\n|Daniel Thomas Miller ||1896\u20131899\n|-\n|[[William Henry Chamberlin|William Henry Chamberlin Jr.]] ||1899\u20131900\n|-\n|Joseph Y.

Bravo Media Sets Sail with New Docu-Series \"Below Deck\" Premiering Monday, July 1 at 10PM ET/PT|accessdate=March 30, 2016|date=May 8, 2013|work=The Futon Critic}}</ref> The first season ran for eleven episodes and concluded on September 9, 2013. The second season of the reality series debuted on August 12, 2014 and ended on November 4, 2014, after airing thirteen episodes. Both seasons featured a \"Reunion\" episode that reunited all the crew members to discuss the events of the season, as well as a special episode \"The Crew Tells All\" with unseen footage of the season. The third season premiered on August 25, 2015 and concluded on December 1, 2015 with a two-part \"Reunion\" episode. Season four premiered on September 6, 2016 and concluded on December 6, 2016. The fifth season premiered on September 5, 2017 and concluded on December 5, 2017 with a \"Reunion\" episode airing on December 12, 2017. Season six premiered on October 2, 2018 and concluded on January 29, 2019 with a \"Reunion\" episode airing on February 5, 2019.\n\nBoth Below Deck and Below Deck Med appeared on E! Network in Canada for the first five (I - V) seasons.  For the first five seasons, E! Network Canada would often air the seasons in the same time slot as in the US, however not all seasons followed the Bravo! U.S.A. schedule.  Starting in season VI (6) Below Deck and Below Deck Med were picked up by SLICE Network in Canada and all shows aired in the identical time slot as in the U.S.A. on Bravo!.  Funny enough, although Canadians have access to both networks, Bravo U.S.A. and Bravo Canada (not the same ownership), the Below Deck shows have never aired on Bravo in Canada.  The two shows have a faithful viewing audience in Canada - especially since season V when Canadians started to appear in the show as part of the crew.  Canadians appearing in the shows included Matt Burns from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada as the crew chef in season V and Courtney Skippon (third stew) from British Columbia in season VII.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Portal|Television}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.bravotv.com/below-deck}}\n* {{IMDb title|tt2342499|Below Deck}}\n* {{tv.com show|below-deck|Below Deck}}\n\n{{Bravo programming}}\n\n[[Category:2013 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s American reality television series]]\n[[Category:2020s American reality television series]]\n[[Category:Bravo (American TV channel) original programming]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television series by Endemol]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name = Below Deck\n| image = Below Deck logo.png\n| genre = [[Reality television]]\n| country = United Status\n| language = English\n| num_seasons = 7\n| num_episodes = 105 <!--as of February 17, 2020-->\n| list_episodes = List of Below Deck episodes\n| executive_producer = {{Plainlist|\n* Mark Cronin\n* Courtland Cox\n* {{nowrap|Nadine Rajabi <small>(season 3\u2013)</small>}}\n* Lauren Simms \n* Rebecca Henning <br /><small>(co-executive, season 3\u2013)</small>\n* James Bruce<br /> <small>(co-executive, season 1)</small>\n* Elise Duran <small>(season 2)</small>}}\n| runtime = 42 minutes\n| company = [[51 Minds Entertainment]]\n| channel = [[Bravo (American TV channel)|Bravo]]\n| picture_format = {{plainlist|\n* [[480i]] ([[SDTV]])\n* [[1080i]] ([[HDTV]])}}\n| first_aired = {{Start date|2013|7|1}}\n| last_aired = present\n| related = {{plainlist|\n* ''[[Below Deck Mediterranean]]''\n* ''Below Deck Sailing Yacht''}}\n| website = http://www.bravotv.com/below-deck\n}}\n\n'''''Below Deck''''' is an American [[reality television]] series on [[Bravo (American TV channel)|Bravo]] that debuted on July 1, 2013, created by Rebecca Taylor Henning & Doug Henning.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|title=Bravo Media Sets Sail With New Docu-Series 'Below Deck' Premiering Monday Junly 1|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/05/08/bravo-media-sets-sail-with-new-docu-series-below-deck-premiering-monday-junly-1/181578/|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Tribune Digital Ventures|accessdate=May 23, 2013|date=May 8, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hertzfeld|first=Laura|title='Below Deck': Check out the mega yacht that's home to new Bravo series -- VIDEO EXCLUSIVE|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/05/08/below-deck-bravo/|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=May 24, 2013|date=May 8, 2012}}</ref> Announced in April 2012, ''Below Deck'' chronicles the lives of the crew members who work and reside aboard a [[mega-yacht]] during [[Yacht charter|charter]] season.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bibel|first=Sara|title=Bravo Greenlights 11 New and 8 Returning Unscripted Series and Plans First Scripted Premiere for 2013|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/04/04/bravo-greenlights-11-new-and-8-returning-unscripted-series-and-plans-first-scripted-premiere-for-2013/127574/|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Tribune Digital Ventures|accessdate=May 24, 2013|date=April 4, 2012}}</ref> It shows the crew as they deal with their personal issues in order to make their professional careers work.

The second season of the reality series debuted on August 12, 2014 and ended on November 4, 2014, after airing thirteen episodes. Both seasons featured a \"Reunion\" episode that reunited all the crew members to discuss the events of the season, as well as a special episode \"The Crew Tells All\" with unseen footage of the season. The third season premiered on August 25, 2015 and concluded on December 1, 2015 with a two-part \"Reunion\" episode. Season four premiered on September 6, 2016 and concluded on December 6, 2016. The fifth season premiered on September 5, 2017 and concluded on December 5, 2017 with a \"Reunion\" episode airing on December 12, 2017. Season six premiered on October 2, 2018 and concluded on January 29, 2019 with a \"Reunion\" episode airing on February 5, 2019.\n\nBoth Below Deck and Below Deck Med appeared on E! Network in Canada for the first five (I - V) seasons.  For the first five seasons, E! Network Canada would often air the seasons in the same time slot as in the US, however not all seasons followed the Bravo! U.S.A. schedule.  Starting in season VI (6) Below Deck and Below Deck Med were picked up by SLICE Network in Canada and all shows aired in the identical time slot as in the U.S.A. on Bravo!.  Funny enough, although Canadians have access to both networks, Bravo U.S.A. and Bravo Canada (not the same ownership), the Below Deck shows have never aired on Bravo in Canada.  The two shows have a faithful viewing audience in Canada - especially since season V when Canadians started to appear in the show as part of the crew.  Canadians appearing in the shows included Matt Burns from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada as the crew chef in season V and Courtney Skippon (third stew) from British Columbia in season VII.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Portal|Television}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.bravotv.com/below-deck}}\n* {{IMDb title|tt2342499|Below Deck}}\n* {{tv.com show|below-deck|Below Deck}}\n\n{{Bravo programming}}\n\n[[Category:2013 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s American reality television series]]\n[[Category:2020s American reality television series]]\n[[Category:Bravo (American TV channel) original programming]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television series by Endemol]]\n", "name_user": "Broadwaygenius", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRatings:Average Viewers", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Below_Deck"}
