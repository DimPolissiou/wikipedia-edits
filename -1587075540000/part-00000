They commissioned a few young type designers to make the first few FontFonts. The first font ever was FF Beowolf by the Dutch Erik van Blokland and Just van Rossum in 1990. It was called a \u201cliving\u201d font because it used a random feature of the [[PostScript]] language to generate randomly different letter forms each time when printed.

Many geneticists have recognized this and attempted to discover the processes involved in the mechanism by which the genes of the genotype bring about phenotypic effects. The first step in such an enterprise is \u2013 or rather should be, since it is often omitted by those with an undue respect for the powers of reason \u2013 to describe what can be seen of the developmental processes. For enquiries of this kind, the word 'phenogenetics' was coined by Haecker [1918, {{lang|de|Ph\u00e4nogenetik}}]. The second and more important part of the task is to discover the causal mechanisms at work, and to relate them as far as possible to what experimental embryology has already revealed of the mechanics of development. We might use the name 'epigenetics' for such studies, thus emphasizing their relation to the concepts, so strongly favourable to the classical theory of epigenesis, which have been reached by the experimental embryologists. We certainly need to remember that between genotype and phenotype, and connecting them to each other, there lies a whole complex of developmental processes. It is convenient to have a name for this complex: 'epigenotype' seems suitable.\"\n</ref> ''Epigenesis'' in the context of the biology of that period referred to the [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of cells from their initial [[totipotent]] state during [[embryonic development]].<ref>See ''[[preformationism]]'' for historical background. ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'':\n\"the theory that the germ is brought into existence (by successive accretions), and not merely developed, in the process of reproduction. [...] The opposite theory was formerly known as the 'theory of evolution'; to avoid the ambiguity of this name, it is now spoken of chiefly as the 'theory of preformation', sometimes as that of 'encasement' or 'embo\u00eetement'.\"</ref>\n\nWhen Waddington coined the term, the physical nature of [[gene]]s and their role in heredity was not known.

There are several layers of regulation of [[gene expression]]. One way that genes are regulated is through the remodeling of chromatin. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and the [[histone]] proteins with which it associates. If the way that DNA is wrapped around the histones changes, gene expression can change as well. Chromatin remodeling is accomplished through two main mechanisms:\n# The first way is [[post translational modification]] of the [[amino acid]]s that make up histone proteins. Histone proteins are made up of long chains of amino acids. If the amino acids that are in the chain are changed, the shape of the histone might be modified. DNA is not completely unwound during [[DNA replication|replication]]. It is possible, then, that the modified histones may be carried into each new copy of the DNA. Once there, these histones may act as templates, initiating the surrounding new histones to be shaped in the new manner. By altering the shape of the histones around them, these modified histones would ensure that a lineage-specific transcription program is maintained after cell division.\n# The second way is the addition of methyl groups to the DNA, mostly at [[CpG site]]s, to convert [[cytosine]] to [[5-methylcytosine]]. 5-Methylcytosine performs much like a regular cytosine, pairing with a [[guanine]] in double-stranded DNA. However, some areas of the genome are methylated more heavily than others, and highly methylated areas tend to be less transcriptionally active, through a mechanism not fully understood. Methylation of cytosines can also persist from the germ line of one of the parents into the zygote, marking the chromosome as being inherited from one parent or the other ([[genetic imprinting]]).\n\nMechanisms of heritability of histone state are not well understood; however, much is known about the mechanism of heritability of DNA methylation state during cell division and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]]. Heritability of methylation state depends on certain enzymes (such as [[DNA methyltransferase|DNMT1]]) that have a higher affinity for 5-methylcytosine than for cytosine. If this enzyme reaches a \"hemimethylated\" portion of DNA (where 5-methylcytosine is in only one of the two DNA strands) the enzyme will methylate the other half.\n\nAlthough histone modifications occur throughout the entire sequence, the unstructured N-termini of histones (called histone tails) are particularly highly modified. These modifications include [[acetylation]], [[methylation]], [[ubiquitylation]], [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], ribosylation and [[citrullination]]. Acetylation is the most highly studied of these modifications. For example, acetylation of the K14 and K9 lysines of the tail of [[histone H3]] by histone acetyltransferase enzymes (HATs) is known to regulate transcription in accordance with complementary histone deacetylases.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Berndsen|first=Christopher E.|last2=Denu|first2=John M.|date=2009|title=Catalysis and Substrate Selection by Histone/Protein Lysine Acetyltransferases|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2723715/|journal=Current opinion in structural biology|volume=18|issue=6|pages=682\u2013689|doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2008.11.004|issn=0959-440X|pmc=2723715|pmid=19056256|via=}}</ref>\n\nOne mode of thinking is that this tendency of acetylation to be associated with \"active\" transcription is biophysical in nature. Because it normally has a positively charged [[nitrogen]] at its end, lysine can bind the negatively charged phosphates of the DNA backbone. The acetylation event converts the positively charged amine group on the side chain into a neutral [[Peptide bond|amide linkage]]. This removes the positive charge, thus loosening the DNA from the histone. When this occurs, complexes like [[SWI/SNF]] and other transcriptional factors can bind to the DNA and allow transcription to occur. This is the \"cis\" model of the epigenetic function. In other words, changes to the histone tails have a direct effect on the DNA itself.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAnother model of epigenetic function is the \"trans\" model. In this model, changes to the histone tails act indirectly on the DNA. For example, lysine acetylation may create a binding site for chromatin-modifying enzymes (or transcription machinery as well). This chromatin remodeler can then cause changes to the state of the chromatin. Indeed, a bromodomain \u2013 a protein domain that specifically binds acetyl-lysine \u2013 is found in many enzymes that help activate transcription, including the [[SWI/SNF]] complex. It may be that acetylation acts in this and the previous way to aid in transcriptional activation.\n\nThe idea that modifications act as docking modules for related factors is borne out by [[histone methylation]] as well. Methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 has long been associated with constitutively transcriptionally silent chromatin (constitutive [[heterochromatin]]). It has been determined that a [[chromodomain]] (a domain that specifically binds methyl-lysine) in the transcriptionally repressive protein [[Heterochromatin Protein 1|HP1]] recruits HP1 to K9 methylated regions. One example that seems to refute this biophysical model for methylation is that tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 is strongly associated with (and required for full) transcriptional activation. Tri-methylation, in this case, would introduce a fixed positive charge on the tail.\n\nIt has been shown that the histone lysine methyltransferase (KMT) is responsible for this methylation activity in the pattern of histones H3 and [[Histone H4|H4]]. This enzyme utilizes a catalytically active site called the SET domain (Suppressor of variegation, Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax). The SET domain is a 130-amino acid sequence involved in modulating gene activities. This domain has been demonstrated to bind to the histone tail and causes the methylation of the histone.<ref name=\"pmid9487389\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jenuwein T, Laible G, Dorn R, Reuter G | title = SET domain proteins modulate chromatin domains in eu- and heterochromatin | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 80\u201393 | date = January 1998 | pmid = 9487389 | doi = 10.1007/s000180050127 }}</ref>\n\nDiffering histone modifications are likely to function in differing ways; acetylation at one position is likely to function differently from acetylation at another position. Also, multiple modifications may occur at the same time, and these modifications may work together to change the behavior of the [[nucleosome]]. The idea that multiple dynamic modifications regulate gene transcription in a systematic and reproducible way is called the [[histone code]], although the idea that histone state can be read linearly as a digital information carrier has been largely debunked. One of the best-understood systems that orchestrate chromatin-based silencing is the [[SIR protein]] based silencing of the yeast hidden mating-type loci HML and HMR.\n\nDNA methylation frequently occurs in repeated sequences, and helps to suppress the expression and mobility of '[[transposable elements]]':<ref name=\"slotkin2007\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Slotkin RK, Martienssen R | title = Transposable elements and the epigenetic regulation of the genome | journal = Nature Reviews.

Though, they are strongly associated with cancer, their role in other pathological conditions are of equal importance. It appears that the hyperglycaemic environment could imprint such changes at the genomic level, that macrophages are primed towards a pro-inflammatory state and could fail to exhibit any phenotypic alteration towards the pro-healing type. This phenomenon of altered Macrophage Polarization is mostly associated with all the diabetic complications in a clinical set-up. As of 2018, several reports reveal the relevance of different epigenetic modifications with respect to diabetic complications. Sooner or later, with the advancements in biomedical tools, the detection of such biomarkers as prognostic and diagnostic tools in patients could possibly emerge out as alternative approaches.

The formation of \u0394FosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for \u0394FosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of \u0394FosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of \u0394FosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a \u2018\u2018molecular switch\u2019\u2019 (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of \u0394FosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction. }}</ref><ref name=\"G9a reverses \u0394FosB plasticity\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bili\u0144ski P, Wojty\u0142a A, Kapka-Skrzypczak L, Chwedorowicz R, Cyranka M, Studzi\u0144ski T | title = Epigenetic regulation in drug addiction | journal = Annals of Agricultural and Environmental Medicine | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 491\u20136 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23020045 | doi =  | quote = For these reasons, \u0394FosB is considered a primary and causative transcription factor in creating new neural connections in the reward centre, prefrontal cortex, and other regions of the limbic system.

Many geneticists have recognized this and attempted to discover the processes involved in the mechanism by which the genes of the genotype bring about phenotypic effects. The first step in such an enterprise is \u2013 or rather should be, since it is often omitted by those with an undue respect for the powers of reason \u2013 to describe what can be seen of the developmental processes. For enquiries of this kind, the word 'phenogenetics' was coined by Haecker [1918, {{lang|de|Ph\u00e4nogenetik}}]. The second and more important part of the task is to discover the causal mechanisms at work, and to relate them as far as possible to what experimental embryology has already revealed of the mechanics of development. We might use the name 'epigenetics' for such studies, thus emphasizing their relation to the concepts, so strongly favourable to the classical theory of epigenesis, which have been reached by the experimental embryologists. We certainly need to remember that between genotype and phenotype, and connecting them to each other, there lies a whole complex of developmental processes. It is convenient to have a name for this complex: 'epigenotype' seems suitable.\"\n</ref> ''Epigenesis'' in the context of the biology of that period referred to the [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of cells from their initial [[totipotent]] state during [[embryonic development]].<ref>See ''[[preformationism]]'' for historical background. ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'':\n\"the theory that the germ is brought into existence (by successive accretions), and not merely developed, in the process of reproduction. [...] The opposite theory was formerly known as the 'theory of evolution'; to avoid the ambiguity of this name, it is now spoken of chiefly as the 'theory of preformation', sometimes as that of 'encasement' or 'embo\u00eetement'.\"</ref>\n\nWhen Waddington coined the term, the physical nature of [[gene]]s and their role in heredity was not known. He used it instead as a conceptual model of how genetic components might interact with their surroundings to produce a [[phenotype]]; he used the phrase \"[[epigenetic landscape]]\" as a metaphor for [[morphogenesis|biological development]]. Waddington held that cell fates were established during development in a process he called [[canalisation (genetics)|canalisation]] much as a marble rolls down to the point of [[local optimum|lowest local elevation]].<ref name=\"Waddington2014\">{{cite book |last1=Waddington |first1=C.

The microstructure (not code) of DNA itself or the associated [[chromatin]] proteins may be modified, causing activation or silencing. This mechanism enables differentiated cells in a multicellular organism to express only the genes that are necessary for their own activity.

There are several layers of regulation of [[gene expression]]. One way that genes are regulated is through the remodeling of chromatin. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and the [[histone]] proteins with which it associates. If the way that DNA is wrapped around the histones changes, gene expression can change as well. Chromatin remodeling is accomplished through two main mechanisms:\n# The first way is [[post translational modification]] of the [[amino acid]]s that make up histone proteins. Histone proteins are made up of long chains of amino acids. If the amino acids that are in the chain are changed, the shape of the histone might be modified. DNA is not completely unwound during [[DNA replication|replication]]. It is possible, then, that the modified histones may be carried into each new copy of the DNA. Once there, these histones may act as templates, initiating the surrounding new histones to be shaped in the new manner. By altering the shape of the histones around them, these modified histones would ensure that a lineage-specific transcription program is maintained after cell division.\n# The second way is the addition of methyl groups to the DNA, mostly at [[CpG site]]s, to convert [[cytosine]] to [[5-methylcytosine]]. 5-Methylcytosine performs much like a regular cytosine, pairing with a [[guanine]] in double-stranded DNA. However, some areas of the genome are methylated more heavily than others, and highly methylated areas tend to be less transcriptionally active, through a mechanism not fully understood. Methylation of cytosines can also persist from the germ line of one of the parents into the zygote, marking the chromosome as being inherited from one parent or the other ([[genetic imprinting]]).\n\nMechanisms of heritability of histone state are not well understood; however, much is known about the mechanism of heritability of DNA methylation state during cell division and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]]. Heritability of methylation state depends on certain enzymes (such as [[DNA methyltransferase|DNMT1]]) that have a higher affinity for 5-methylcytosine than for cytosine. If this enzyme reaches a \"hemimethylated\" portion of DNA (where 5-methylcytosine is in only one of the two DNA strands) the enzyme will methylate the other half.\n\nAlthough histone modifications occur throughout the entire sequence, the unstructured N-termini of histones (called histone tails) are particularly highly modified. These modifications include [[acetylation]], [[methylation]], [[ubiquitylation]], [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], ribosylation and [[citrullination]]. Acetylation is the most highly studied of these modifications. For example, acetylation of the K14 and K9 lysines of the tail of [[histone H3]] by histone acetyltransferase enzymes (HATs) is known to regulate transcription in accordance with complementary histone deacetylases.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Berndsen|first=Christopher E.|last2=Denu|first2=John M.|date=2009|title=Catalysis and Substrate Selection by Histone/Protein Lysine Acetyltransferases|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2723715/|journal=Current opinion in structural biology|volume=18|issue=6|pages=682\u2013689|doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2008.11.004|issn=0959-440X|pmc=2723715|pmid=19056256|via=}}</ref>\n\nOne mode of thinking is that this tendency of acetylation to be associated with \"active\" transcription is biophysical in nature. Because it normally has a positively charged [[nitrogen]] at its end, lysine can bind the negatively charged phosphates of the DNA backbone. The acetylation event converts the positively charged amine group on the side chain into a neutral [[Peptide bond|amide linkage]]. This removes the positive charge, thus loosening the DNA from the histone. When this occurs, complexes like [[SWI/SNF]] and other transcriptional factors can bind to the DNA and allow transcription to occur. This is the \"cis\" model of the epigenetic function. In other words, changes to the histone tails have a direct effect on the DNA itself.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAnother model of epigenetic function is the \"trans\" model. In this model, changes to the histone tails act indirectly on the DNA. For example, lysine acetylation may create a binding site for chromatin-modifying enzymes (or transcription machinery as well). This chromatin remodeler can then cause changes to the state of the chromatin. Indeed, a bromodomain \u2013 a protein domain that specifically binds acetyl-lysine \u2013 is found in many enzymes that help activate transcription, including the [[SWI/SNF]] complex. It may be that acetylation acts in this and the previous way to aid in transcriptional activation.\n\nThe idea that modifications act as docking modules for related factors is borne out by [[histone methylation]] as well. Methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 has long been associated with constitutively transcriptionally silent chromatin (constitutive [[heterochromatin]]). It has been determined that a [[chromodomain]] (a domain that specifically binds methyl-lysine) in the transcriptionally repressive protein [[Heterochromatin Protein 1|HP1]] recruits HP1 to K9 methylated regions. One example that seems to refute this biophysical model for methylation is that tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 is strongly associated with (and required for full) transcriptional activation. Tri-methylation, in this case, would introduce a fixed positive charge on the tail.\n\nIt has been shown that the histone lysine methyltransferase (KMT) is responsible for this methylation activity in the pattern of histones H3 and [[Histone H4|H4]]. This enzyme utilizes a catalytically active site called the SET domain (Suppressor of variegation, Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax). The SET domain is a 130-amino acid sequence involved in modulating gene activities. This domain has been demonstrated to bind to the histone tail and causes the methylation of the histone.<ref name=\"pmid9487389\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jenuwein T, Laible G, Dorn R, Reuter G | title = SET domain proteins modulate chromatin domains in eu- and heterochromatin | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 80\u201393 | date = January 1998 | pmid = 9487389 | doi = 10.1007/s000180050127 }}</ref>\n\nDiffering histone modifications are likely to function in differing ways; acetylation at one position is likely to function differently from acetylation at another position. Also, multiple modifications may occur at the same time, and these modifications may work together to change the behavior of the [[nucleosome]]. The idea that multiple dynamic modifications regulate gene transcription in a systematic and reproducible way is called the [[histone code]], although the idea that histone state can be read linearly as a digital information carrier has been largely debunked. One of the best-understood systems that orchestrate chromatin-based silencing is the [[SIR protein]] based silencing of the yeast hidden mating-type loci HML and HMR.\n\nDNA methylation frequently occurs in repeated sequences, and helps to suppress the expression and mobility of '[[transposable elements]]':<ref name=\"slotkin2007\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Slotkin RK, Martienssen R | title = Transposable elements and the epigenetic regulation of the genome | journal = Nature Reviews.

Most importantly, eukaryotes use epigenetic mechanisms primarily to regulate gene expression which bacteria rarely do. However, bacteria make widespread use of postreplicative DNA methylation for the epigenetic control of DNA-protein interactions. Bacteria also use DNA [[adenine]] methylation (rather than DNA [[cytosine]] methylation) as an epigenetic signal. DNA adenine methylation is important in bacteria virulence in organisms such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Salmonella]], [[Vibrio]], [[Yersinia]], [[Haemophilus]]'', and ''[[Brucella]]''. In ''[[Alphaproteobacteria]]'', methylation of adenine regulates the cell cycle and couples gene transcription to DNA replication. In ''[[Gammaproteobacteria]]'', adenine methylation provides signals for DNA replication, chromosome segregation, mismatch repair, packaging of bacteriophage, transposase activity and regulation of gene expression.<ref name=\"JorgTost\" /><ref name=\"Casadesus\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Casades\u00fas J, Low D | title = Epigenetic gene regulation in the bacterial world | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 70 | issue = 3 | pages = 830\u201356 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16959970 | pmc = 1594586 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.00016-06 }}</ref> There exists a genetic switch controlling ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' (the pneumococcus) that allows the bacterium to randomly change its characteristics into six alternative states that could pave the way to improved vaccines.

Though, they are strongly associated with cancer, their role in other pathological conditions are of equal importance. It appears that the hyperglycaemic environment could imprint such changes at the genomic level, that macrophages are primed towards a pro-inflammatory state and could fail to exhibit any phenotypic alteration towards the pro-healing type. This phenomenon of altered Macrophage Polarization is mostly associated with all the diabetic complications in a clinical set-up. As of 2018, several reports reveal the relevance of different epigenetic modifications with respect to diabetic complications. Sooner or later, with the advancements in biomedical tools, the detection of such biomarkers as prognostic and diagnostic tools in patients could possibly emerge out as alternative approaches. It is noteworthy to mention here that the use of epigenetic modifications as therapeutic targets warrant extensive preclinical as well as clinical evaluation prior to use.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Basu Mallik |first1=Sanchari |last2=Jayashree |first2=B.S. |last3=Shenoy |first3=Rekha R. |title=Epigenetic modulation of macrophage polarization- perspectives in diabetic wounds |journal=Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications |date=May 2018 |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=524\u2013530 |doi=10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2018.01.015 |pmid=29530315 }}</ref>\n\n===Examples of drugs altering gene expression from epigenetic events===\n\n{{See also|Epigenetic Priming|label 1=Epigenetic Priming}}\n\nThe use of beta-lactam antibiotics can alter glutamate receptor activity and the action of cyclosporine on multiple transcription factors.

The formation of \u0394FosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for \u0394FosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of \u0394FosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of \u0394FosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a \u2018\u2018molecular switch\u2019\u2019 (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of \u0394FosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction. }}</ref><ref name=\"G9a reverses \u0394FosB plasticity\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bili\u0144ski P, Wojty\u0142a A, Kapka-Skrzypczak L, Chwedorowicz R, Cyranka M, Studzi\u0144ski T | title = Epigenetic regulation in drug addiction | journal = Annals of Agricultural and Environmental Medicine | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 491\u20136 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23020045 | doi =  | quote = For these reasons, \u0394FosB is considered a primary and causative transcription factor in creating new neural connections in the reward centre, prefrontal cortex, and other regions of the limbic system. This is reflected in the increased, stable and long-lasting level of sensitivity to cocaine and other drugs, and tendency to relapse even after long periods of abstinence. These newly constructed networks function very efficiently via new pathways as soon as drugs of abuse are further taken&nbsp;... In this way, the induction of CDK5 gene expression occurs together with suppression of the G9A gene coding for dimethyltransferase acting on the histone H3. A feedback mechanism can be observed in the regulation of these 2 crucial factors that determine the adaptive epigenetic response to cocaine. This depends on \u0394FosB inhibiting G9a gene expression, i.e. H3K9me2 synthesis which in turn inhibits transcription factors for \u0394FosB. For this reason, the observed hyper-expression of G9a, which ensures high levels of the dimethylated form of histone H3, eliminates the neuronal structural and plasticity effects caused by cocaine by means of this feedback which blocks \u0394FosB transcription }}</ref> Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of addictive [[phenotypes]] has been noted to occur in preclinical studies.<ref name=\"pmid23920159\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vassoler FM, Sadri-Vakili G | title = Mechanisms of transgenerational inheritance of addictive-like behaviors | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 264 | issue =  | pages = 198\u2013206 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 23920159 | pmc = 3872494 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.07.064 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid26572641\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yuan TF, Li A, Sun X, Ouyang H, Campos C, Rocha NB, Arias-Carri\u00f3n O, Machado S, Hou G, So KF | display-authors = 6 | title = Transgenerational Inheritance of Paternal Neurobehavioral Phenotypes: Stress, Addiction, Ageing and Metabolism | journal = Molecular Neurobiology | volume = 53 | issue = 9 | pages = 6367\u20136376 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 26572641 | doi = 10.1007/s12035-015-9526-2 | hdl = 10400.22/7331 | hdl-access = free }}</ref>\n\n=== Anxiety ===\nTransgenerational epigenetic inheritance of anxiety-related phenotypes has been reported in a preclinical study using mice.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Short AK, Fennell KA, Perreau VM, Fox A, O'Bryan MK, Kim JH, Bredy TW, Pang TY, Hannan AJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Elevated paternal glucocorticoid exposure alters the small noncoding RNA profile in sperm and modifies anxiety and depressive phenotypes in the offspring | journal = Translational Psychiatry | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = e837 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27300263 | pmc = 4931607 | doi = 10.1038/tp.2016.109 }}</ref> In this investigation, transmission of paternal stress-induced traits across generations involved small non-coding RNA signals transmitted via the male germline.\n\n=== Depression ===\nEpigenetic inheritance of depression-related phenotypes has also been reported in a preclinical study.<ref name=\":0\" /> Inheritance of paternal stress-induced traits across generations involved small non-coding RNA signals transmitted via the paternal germline.\n\n=== Fear conditioning ===\nStudies on mice have shown that certain conditional fears can be inherited from either parent.

Since then, the hybrid has spread throughout South America and arrived in North America in 1985. Hives were found in south [[Texas]] in the [[United States]] in 1990.<ref name=SI>{{cite web |title=Africanized Bees |url=https://www.si.edu/Encyclopedia_SI/nmnh/buginfo/killbee.htm |website=Encyclopedia SI |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=7 Dec 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfricanized bees are typically much more defensive than other varieties of honey bee, and react to disturbances faster than European honey bees.

All subspecies are cross-fertile. Geographic isolation led to numerous local adaptations. These adaptations include brood cycles synchronized with the bloom period of local flora, forming a winter cluster in colder climates, migratory swarming in Africa, enhanced (long-distance) foraging behavior in desert areas, and numerous other inherited traits.\n\nThe Africanized honey bees in the [[Western Hemisphere]] are descended from hives operated by [[biologist]] [[Warwick Estevam Kerr|Warwick E. Kerr]], who had interbred honey bees from Europe and [[southern Africa]]. Kerr was attempting to breed a strain of bees that would produce more honey in [[tropics|tropical]] conditions than the European strain of honey bee currently in use throughout [[North America|North]], [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. The hives containing this particular Africanized subspecies were housed at an [[apiary]] near [[Rio Claro, S\u00e3o Paulo|Rio Claro]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]], in the southeast of [[Brazil]], and were noted to be especially defensive. These hives had been fitted with special excluder screens (called [[queen excluder]]s) to prevent the larger queen bees and drones from getting out and mating with the local population of European bees. According to Kerr, in October&nbsp;1957 a visiting beekeeper, noticing that the queen excluders were interfering with the worker bees' movement, removed them, resulting in the accidental release of 26&nbsp;[[Tanganyika]]n swarms of ''A. m. scutellata''. Following this accidental release, the Africanized swarms spread out and cross-bred with local European colonies.\n\nThe descendants of these colonies have since spread throughout the Americas, moving through the [[Amazon basin|Amazon Basin]] in the 1970s, crossing into Central America in 1982, and reaching Mexico in 1985.<ref>{{cite book |title=Killer bees: The Africanized honey bee in the Americas |author=Winston, M. L. |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1992}}</ref> Because their movement through these regions was rapid and largely unassisted by humans, Africanized bees have earned the reputation of being a notorious [[invasive species]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/misc/bees/ahb.htm |title=Africanized Honey Bee |publisher=University of Florida |department=Entomology & Nematology Department |access-date=2018-06-29 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The prospect of killer bees arriving in the United States caused a media sensation in the late 1970s, inspired several horror movies,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sfyl.ifas.ufl.edu/natural-resources/africanized-honey-bees/ |title=Africanized Honey Bees |publisher=University of Florida |department=[[Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences]] (IFAS) Extension |access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref> and sparked debate about the capability of humans to alter entire ecosystems.\n\nThe first Africanized bees in the US were discovered in 1985 at an oil field in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] of California. Bee experts theorized the colony had not traveled overland but instead \"arrived hidden in a load of oil-drilling pipe shipped from South America.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Le&nbsp;Page |first=Andrew |title=San Diego officials setting traps for expected arrival of 'killer bees' |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-05-10/news/mn-2787_1_africanized-killer-bees-san-diego-county |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=10 May 1989}}</ref> The first permanent colonies arrived in [[Texas]], from Mexico, in 1990.

This is not necessarily a severe loss in tropical climates where plants bloom all year but in more temperate climates it can leave the colony with not enough stores to survive the winter. Thus Africanized bees are expected to be a hazard mostly in the [[Southern United States|Southern States]] of the United States, reaching as far north as the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in the east. The cold-weather limits of the African bee have driven some professional bee breeders from Southern California into the harsher wintering locales of the northern [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and southern [[Cascade Range]]. This is a more difficult area to prepare bees for early [[pollination management|pollination]] placement in, such as is required for the production of [[almond]]s. The reduced available winter forage in northern California means that bees must be fed for early spring buildup.\n\nThe arrival of the Africanized honey bee in Central America is threatening the ancient art of keeping ''[[Melipona]]'' [[stingless bee]]s in [[log gum]]s, although they do not interbreed or directly compete with each other. The honey production from a single hive of Africanized bees can be 100&nbsp;kg annually and far exceeds the much smaller 3\u20135&nbsp;kg of the various ''Melipona'' stingless species. Thus economic pressures are forcing beekeepers to switch from the traditional bees of their ancestors to the new reality of the Africanized honey bee. Whether this will lead to their extinction is unknown, but they are well adapted to exist in the wild, and there are a number of indigenous plants that the Africanized honey bees do not visit, so their fate remains to be seen.\n\n[[File:Creation-Via-Pollination.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Africanized honey bees gathering pollen at an [[Opuntia engelmannii|Engelmann's prickly pear]] in the [[Mojave desert]]]]\n\n== Foraging behavior ==\nAfricanized honey bees have a set of characteristics with respect to foraging behavior.

By selecting only the most gentle, non-defensive races, beekeepers have, over centuries, eliminated the more defensive races and created a number of subspecies suitable for [[apiculture]]. The most common race used in Europe and the United States today is the Italian bee, ''[[Apis mellifera ligustica]]'', which has been used for over a thousand years in some parts of the world and in the Americas since the arrival of the European colonists.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nIn central and southern Africa there was formerly no tradition of beekeeping, and the hive was destroyed in order to harvest the honey, pollen and larvae. The bees adapted to the climate of sub-Saharan Africa, including prolonged droughts. Having to defend themselves against aggressive insects such as ants and wasps, as well as voracious animals like the [[honey badger]], African bees evolved as a race of highly defensive bees unsuitable by a number of metrics for domestic use.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nAs Africanized bees migrate into regions, hives with an old or absent queen can become hybridized by cross-breeding. The aggressive Africanized drones outcompete European drones for a newly developed queen of such hive, ultimately resulting in hybridization of the existing colony. Requeening, a term for swapping out the old queen with a new, already fertilized one, can reduce hybridization in apiaries.

Although Africanized bees do not search for humans to attack, they are more dangerous because they are more easily provoked, quicker to attack in greater numbers, and then pursue the perceived threat farther, {{Citation needed span|date=June 2017|sometimes for up to a kilometer (approx. {{frac|5|8}}&nbsp;mile) or more.}}\n\nWhile studies have shown that Africanized bees can infiltrate European bee colonies and then kill and replace their queen (thus usurping the hive), this is less common than other methods. Wild and managed colonies will sometimes be seen to fight over honey stores during the dearth (periods when plants are not flowering), but this behavior should not be confused with the aforementioned activity. The most common way that a European hive will become Africanized is through cross-breeding during a new queen's mating flight. Studies have consistently shown that Africanized drones are more numerous, stronger and faster than their European cousins and are therefore able to out-compete them during these mating flights. The results of mating between Africanized drones and European queens is almost always Africanized offspring.<ref>{{cite book |author=Winston, Mark L. |year=1992 |title=Killer Bees: The Africanized honey bee in the Americas |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-50353-3 |pages=9\u201334}}</ref>\n\n== Impact on existing apiculture ==\nIn areas of suitable temperate climate, the survival traits of Africanized colonies help them outperform European honey bee colonies. They also return later and basically work under conditions that often keep European bees hive-bound. This is the reason why they have gained a well-deserved reputation as superior honey producers, and those beekeepers who have learned to adapt their management techniques now seem to prefer them to their European counterparts. Studies show that in areas of Florida that contain Africanized honey bees, the honey production is higher than in areas in which they do not live.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.11.013 | title = The effect of Africanized honey bees on honey production in the United States: An informational approach | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 69 | issue = 4 | pages = 895\u2013904 | year = 2010 | last1 = Livanis | first1 = G. | last2 = Moss | first2 = C.

So despite all its negative factors, it is possible that the Africanized honey bee might actually end up being a boon to apiculture.\n\n=== Queen management in Africanized bee areas ===\nIn areas where Africanized bees are well established, purchased and pre-fertilized (i.e. mated) European queens can be used to maintain a hive's European genetics and behavior. However, this practice can be expensive since these queens must be purchased and shipped from breeder apiaries in areas which are completely free of Africanized bees, such as northern U.S. states or [[Hawaii]]. As such this is generally not practical for most commercial beekeepers outside of the U.S. and one of the main reasons why Central and South American beekeepers have had to learn to manage and work with the existing Africanized honey bee.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Any effort to cross-breed virgin European queens with Africanized drones will result in the offspring exhibiting Africanized traits; only 26&nbsp;escaped swarms in 1957, and nearly six decades later there does not appear to be a lessening to any noticeable degree of the typical Africanized characteristics.\n\n=== Gentle Africanized bees ===\nNot all Africanized hives display the typical hyper-defensive behavior, which may provide bee breeders a point to begin breeding a gentler stock.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beesource.com/point-of-view/africanized-honey-bees/preparing-for-the-africanized-honey-bee-a-program-for-arizona/ |series=Beesource Beekeeping |title=Preparing for the \"Africanized\" honey bee: A program for Arizona |publisher=Beesource.com |access-date=19 October 2010}}</ref> Work has been done in Brazil towards this end, but in order to maintain these traits, it is necessary to develop a queen breeding and mating facility in order to requeen colonies and to prevent reintroduction of unwanted genes or characteristics through unintended cross-breeding with feral colonies. In Puerto Rico, some bee colonies are already beginning to show more gentle behavior. This is believed to be because the more gentle bees contain genetic material that is more similar to the European honey bee although they also contain African honey bee material.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1186/1471-2156-14-65 | pmid = 23915100 | pmc = 3750330 | title = Genetic structure of the gentle Africanized honey bee population (gAHB) in Puerto Rico | journal = BMC Genetics | volume = 14 | pages = 65 | year = 2013 | last1 = Galindo-Cardona | first1 = A. | last2 = Acevedo-Gonzalez | first2 = J.

Prominent among these are locating bee-yards much further from human habitation, creating barriers to keep livestock at enough of a distance to prevent interaction, and education of the general public to teach them how to properly react when feral colonies are encountered and what resources to contact.

All subspecies are cross-fertile. Geographic isolation led to numerous local adaptations. These adaptations include brood cycles synchronized with the bloom period of local flora, forming a winter cluster in colder climates, migratory swarming in Africa, enhanced (long-distance) foraging behavior in desert areas, and numerous other inherited traits.\n\nThe Africanized honey bees in the [[Western Hemisphere]] are descended from hives operated by [[biologist]] [[Warwick Estevam Kerr|Warwick E. Kerr]], who had interbred honey bees from Europe and [[southern Africa]]. Kerr was attempting to breed a strain of bees that would produce more honey in [[tropics|tropical]] conditions than the European strain of honey bee currently in use throughout [[North America|North]], [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. The hives containing this particular Africanized subspecies were housed at an [[apiary]] near [[Rio Claro, S\u00e3o Paulo|Rio Claro]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]], in the southeast of [[Brazil]], and were noted to be especially defensive. These hives had been fitted with special excluder screens (called [[queen excluder]]s) to prevent the larger queen bees and drones from getting out and mating with the local population of European bees. According to Kerr, in October&nbsp;1957 a visiting beekeeper, noticing that the queen excluders were interfering with the worker bees' movement, removed them, resulting in the accidental release of 26&nbsp;[[Tanganyika]]n swarms of ''A. m. scutellata''. Following this accidental release, the Africanized swarms spread out and cross-bred with local European colonies.\n\nThe descendants of these colonies have since spread throughout the Americas, moving through the [[Amazon basin|Amazon Basin]] in the 1970s, crossing into Central America in 1982, and reaching Mexico in 1985.<ref>{{cite book |title=Killer bees: The Africanized honey bee in the Americas |author=Winston, M.

In a study conducted in Arizona in 2004 it was observed that swarms of Africanized bees could take over weakened European honey bee hives by invading the hive, then killing the European queen and establishing their own [[Queen bee|queen]].<ref name=\"Usurp\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00040-004-0753-1 |title=Seasonal nest usurpation of European colonies by African swarms in Arizona, USA |journal=Insectes Sociaux |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=359 |year=2004 |last1=Schneider |first1=S.S. |last2=Deeby |first2=T. |last3=Gilley |first3=D.C. |last4=Degrandi-Hoffman |first4=G.}}</ref> There are now relatively stable geographic zones in which either African bees dominate, a mix of African and European bees is present, or only non-African bees are found, as in the southern portions of South America or northern North America.\n\n[[File:Africanized honey bee hive.jpg|thumb|Bee hive on [[Gila River Indian Community]] land]]\n\nAfrican honeybees abscond (abandon the hive and any food store to start over in a new location) more readily than European honeybees. This is not necessarily a severe loss in tropical climates where plants bloom all year but in more temperate climates it can leave the colony with not enough stores to survive the winter. Thus Africanized bees are expected to be a hazard mostly in the [[Southern United States|Southern States]] of the United States, reaching as far north as the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in the east. The cold-weather limits of the African bee have driven some professional bee breeders from Southern California into the harsher wintering locales of the northern [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and southern [[Cascade Range]]. This is a more difficult area to prepare bees for early [[pollination management|pollination]] placement in, such as is required for the production of [[almond]]s. The reduced available winter forage in northern California means that bees must be fed for early spring buildup.\n\nThe arrival of the Africanized honey bee in Central America is threatening the ancient art of keeping ''[[Melipona]]'' [[stingless bee]]s in [[log gum]]s, although they do not interbreed or directly compete with each other. The honey production from a single hive of Africanized bees can be 100&nbsp;kg annually and far exceeds the much smaller 3\u20135&nbsp;kg of the various ''Melipona'' stingless species. Thus economic pressures are forcing beekeepers to switch from the traditional bees of their ancestors to the new reality of the Africanized honey bee. Whether this will lead to their extinction is unknown, but they are well adapted to exist in the wild, and there are a number of indigenous plants that the Africanized honey bees do not visit, so their fate remains to be seen.\n\n[[File:Creation-Via-Pollination.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Africanized honey bees gathering pollen at an [[Opuntia engelmannii|Engelmann's prickly pear]] in the [[Mojave desert]]]]\n\n== Foraging behavior ==\nAfricanized honey bees have a set of characteristics with respect to foraging behavior.

By selecting only the most gentle, non-defensive races, beekeepers have, over centuries, eliminated the more defensive races and created a number of subspecies suitable for [[apiculture]]. The most common race used in Europe and the United States today is the Italian bee, ''[[Apis mellifera ligustica]]'', which has been used for over a thousand years in some parts of the world and in the Americas since the arrival of the European colonists.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nIn central and southern Africa there was formerly no tradition of beekeeping, and the hive was destroyed in order to harvest the honey, pollen and larvae. The bees adapted to the climate of sub-Saharan Africa, including prolonged droughts. Having to defend themselves against aggressive insects such as ants and wasps, as well as voracious animals like the [[honey badger]], African bees evolved as a race of highly defensive bees unsuitable by a number of metrics for domestic use.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nAs Africanized bees migrate into regions, hives with an old or absent queen can become hybridized by cross-breeding. The aggressive Africanized drones outcompete European drones for a newly developed queen of such hive, ultimately resulting in hybridization of the existing colony. Requeening, a term for swapping out the old queen with a new, already fertilized one, can reduce hybridization in apiaries. As a prophylactic measure, the majority of beekeepers in North America tend to requeen their hives annually, maintaining strong colonies and avoiding hybridization.\n\n=== Defensiveness ===\nAfricanized bees exhibit far greater defensiveness than [[European honey bee]]s, and are more likely to attack  a perceived threat by attacking in large swarms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/misc/bees/ahb.htm|title=Africanized honey bee - Apis mellifera scutellata Lepeletier|last=Ellis|first=Jamie|date=January 2008|website=University of Florida Entymology and Nematology Department|access-date=}}</ref> These hybrids have been known to pursue a perceived threat for a distance of well over 500&nbsp;meters (1640&nbsp;ft).{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe venom of an Africanized bee is the same as that of a European honey bee, but since the former tends to sting in far greater numbers, deaths from them are naturally more numerous than from European honey bees.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Are Africanized honey bees more deadly than other bees? |url=http://www.bearcountrybees.com/are-africanized-honey-bees-more-deadly-than-other-bees/ |accessdate=2015-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715153855/http://www.bearcountrybees.com/are-africanized-honey-bees-more-deadly-than-other-bees/ |archive-date=2015-07-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> While allergies to the European honey bee may cause death, complications from African bee stings are usually not caused from allergies to their venom.

Wild and managed colonies will sometimes be seen to fight over honey stores during the dearth (periods when plants are not flowering), but this behavior should not be confused with the aforementioned activity. The most common way that a European hive will become Africanized is through cross-breeding during a new queen's mating flight. Studies have consistently shown that Africanized drones are more numerous, stronger and faster than their European cousins and are therefore able to out-compete them during these mating flights. The results of mating between Africanized drones and European queens is almost always Africanized offspring.<ref>{{cite book |author=Winston, Mark L. |year=1992 |title=Killer Bees: The Africanized honey bee in the Americas |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-50353-3 |pages=9\u201334}}</ref>\n\n== Impact on existing apiculture ==\nIn areas of suitable temperate climate, the survival traits of Africanized colonies help them outperform European honey bee colonies. They also return later and basically work under conditions that often keep European bees hive-bound. This is the reason why they have gained a well-deserved reputation as superior honey producers, and those beekeepers who have learned to adapt their management techniques now seem to prefer them to their European counterparts. Studies show that in areas of Florida that contain Africanized honey bees, the honey production is higher than in areas in which they do not live.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.11.013 | title = The effect of Africanized honey bees on honey production in the United States: An informational approach | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 69 | issue = 4 | pages = 895\u2013904 | year = 2010 | last1 = Livanis | first1 = G. | last2 = Moss | first2 = C.

So despite all its negative factors, it is possible that the Africanized honey bee might actually end up being a boon to apiculture.\n\n=== Queen management in Africanized bee areas ===\nIn areas where Africanized bees are well established, purchased and pre-fertilized (i.e. mated) European queens can be used to maintain a hive's European genetics and behavior. However, this practice can be expensive since these queens must be purchased and shipped from breeder apiaries in areas which are completely free of Africanized bees, such as northern U.S. states or [[Hawaii]]. As such this is generally not practical for most commercial beekeepers outside of the U.S. and one of the main reasons why Central and South American beekeepers have had to learn to manage and work with the existing Africanized honey bee.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Any effort to cross-breed virgin European queens with Africanized drones will result in the offspring exhibiting Africanized traits; only 26&nbsp;escaped swarms in 1957, and nearly six decades later there does not appear to be a lessening to any noticeable degree of the typical Africanized characteristics.\n\n=== Gentle Africanized bees ===\nNot all Africanized hives display the typical hyper-defensive behavior, which may provide bee breeders a point to begin breeding a gentler stock.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beesource.com/point-of-view/africanized-honey-bees/preparing-for-the-africanized-honey-bee-a-program-for-arizona/ |series=Beesource Beekeeping |title=Preparing for the \"Africanized\" honey bee: A program for Arizona |publisher=Beesource.com |access-date=19 October 2010}}</ref> Work has been done in Brazil towards this end, but in order to maintain these traits, it is necessary to develop a queen breeding and mating facility in order to requeen colonies and to prevent reintroduction of unwanted genes or characteristics through unintended cross-breeding with feral colonies. In Puerto Rico, some bee colonies are already beginning to show more gentle behavior. This is believed to be because the more gentle bees contain genetic material that is more similar to the European honey bee although they also contain African honey bee material.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1186/1471-2156-14-65 | pmid = 23915100 | pmc = 3750330 | title = Genetic structure of the gentle Africanized honey bee population (gAHB) in Puerto Rico | journal = BMC Genetics | volume = 14 | pages = 65 | year = 2013 | last1 = Galindo-Cardona | first1 = A. | last2 = Acevedo-Gonzalez | first2 = J.

Prominent among these are locating bee-yards much further from human habitation, creating barriers to keep livestock at enough of a distance to prevent interaction, and education of the general public to teach them how to properly react when feral colonies are encountered and what resources to contact. The Africanized bee is considered the bee of choice for beekeeping in Brazil.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Da Silva |title=Review of environmental impact and productivity of the Africanized honey bee in Brazil |journal=Brazilian Journal of Agricultural Research |date=2009 |volume=23 |issue=14 |pages=55\u201367}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bee removal]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite journal | author = Collet T. |author2=Ferreira K.M. |author3=Arias M.C. |author4=Soares A.E.E. |author5=Del Lama M.A. | year = 2006 | title = Genetic structure of African honeybee populations (''Apis mellifera'' L.) from Brazil and Uruguay viewed through mitochondrial DNA COI\u2013COII patterns | journal = Heredity | volume = 97 | issue = 5 | pages = 329\u2013335 | doi = 10.1038/sj.hdy.6800875 | pmid = 16955114  }}\n\n* {{cite journal |authors=Ronald M.

Her birth name is different from her legal name. It must be in the lead and bolded.--> November 26, 1939) is a singer and actress, originally from the United States and now a Swiss citizen. Turner rose to prominence as part of the [[Ike & Tina Turner|Ike & Tina Turner Revue]] before launching a successful career as a solo performer. One of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling recording artists of all time]], she has been referred to as [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|The Queen of Rock 'n' Roll]] and has sold more than 100 million records worldwide. Turner is noted for her energetic stage presence, powerful vocals, and career longevity.\n\nTurner began her career in 1958 as a featured singer with Ike Turner's [[Kings of Rhythm]], recording under the name \"Little Ann\" on \"[[Boxtop (song)|Boxtop]]\". Her introduction to the public as Tina Turner began with the hit single \"[[A Fool in Love]]\" (1960), released by the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. She married Ike Turner in 1962. Success followed with a string of notable hits, including \"[[River Deep \u2013 Mountain High]]\" (1966), the Grammy-winning \"[[Proud Mary]]\" (1971), and \"[[Nutbush City Limits]]\" (1973). Raised a [[Baptists|Baptist]], she became an adherent of [[Nichiren Buddhism]] in 1973, crediting the spiritual [[Buddhist chant|chant]] of ''[[Nam(u) My\u014dh\u014d Renge Ky\u014d|Nam Myoho Renge Kyo]]'' with helping her to endure during difficult times. Turner separated from Ike Turner in 1976, ending both their personal relationship and their musical partnership; the couple divorced in 1978. In her autobiography, ''[[I,&nbsp;Tina|I, Tina: My Life Story]]'' (1986), Turner revealed that Ike Turner had subjected her to [[domestic violence]].\n\nIn the 1980s, Turner launched a major comeback as a solo artist. The 1983 single \"[[Let's Stay Together (Al Green song)|Let's Stay Together]]\" was followed by the release of her fifth solo album, ''[[Private Dancer]]'' (1984), which became a worldwide success. The album contained the hit song \"[[What's Love Got to Do with It (song)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]\" (1984). Turner won the [[Grammy Award for Record Of The Year]] for the single, and it became her first (and only) No. 1 hit in the United States. Turner's solo success continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s with multi-platinum albums and hit singles. Her U.S. Top 10 hits from this period include \"[[Better Be Good to Me]]\" (1984), \"[[Private Dancer]]\" (1984), \"[[We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)]]\" (1985), \"[[Typical Male]]\" (1986), and \"[[I Don't Wanna Fight]]\" (1993). In 1993, ''[[What's Love Got to Do with It (film)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]'', a [[biographical film]] adapted from Turner's autobiography, was released along with an accompanying [[What's Love Got to Do with It (album)|soundtrack album]]. Turner also achieved success as an actress in films such as the 1975 [[rock musical]] ''[[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]]'', the 1985 action film ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]'', and the 1993 film ''[[Last Action Hero]]''.\n\nTurner has won 12 [[Grammy Award]]s; those awards include eight competitive awards, three [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] awards, and a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Turner 63rd on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time and 17th on its list of the 100 greatest singers of all time. Turner has her own stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] and on the [[St. Louis Walk of Fame]]. She was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] with Ike Turner in 1991 and is a 2005 recipient of the [[Kennedy Center Honors]].\n\n==Early life==\nTina Turner was born Anna Mae Bullock on November 26, 1939,<ref group=lower-alpha name=Contract>Turner signed her legal name as Martha Nell Turner on a 1977 contract.</ref><ref name=HA>{{Cite web|url=https://entertainment.ha.com/itm/music-memorabilia/autographs-and-signed-items/tina-turner-signed-contract-1977-/a/696-52395.s|title=Tina Turner Signed Contract (1977)....

Her birth name is different from her legal name. It must be in the lead and bolded.--> November 26, 1939) is a singer and actress, originally from the United States and now a Swiss citizen. Turner rose to prominence as part of the [[Ike & Tina Turner|Ike & Tina Turner Revue]] before launching a successful career as a solo performer. One of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling recording artists of all time]], she has been referred to as [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|The Queen of Rock 'n' Roll]] and has sold more than 100 million records worldwide. Turner is noted for her energetic stage presence, powerful vocals, and career longevity.\n\nTurner began her career in 1958 as a featured singer with Ike Turner's [[Kings of Rhythm]], recording under the name \"Little Ann\" on \"[[Boxtop (song)|Boxtop]]\". Her introduction to the public as Tina Turner began with the hit single \"[[A Fool in Love]]\" (1960), released by the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. She married Ike Turner in 1962. Success followed with a string of notable hits, including \"[[River Deep \u2013 Mountain High]]\" (1966), the Grammy-winning \"[[Proud Mary]]\" (1971), and \"[[Nutbush City Limits]]\" (1973). Raised a [[Baptists|Baptist]], she became an adherent of [[Nichiren Buddhism]] in 1973, crediting the spiritual [[Buddhist chant|chant]] of ''[[Nam(u) My\u014dh\u014d Renge Ky\u014d|Nam Myoho Renge Kyo]]'' with helping her to endure during difficult times. Turner separated from Ike Turner in 1976, ending both their personal relationship and their musical partnership; the couple divorced in 1978. In her autobiography, ''[[I,&nbsp;Tina|I, Tina: My Life Story]]'' (1986), Turner revealed that Ike Turner had subjected her to [[domestic violence]].\n\nIn the 1980s, Turner launched a major comeback as a solo artist. The 1983 single \"[[Let's Stay Together (Al Green song)|Let's Stay Together]]\" was followed by the release of her fifth solo album, ''[[Private Dancer]]'' (1984), which became a worldwide success. The album contained the hit song \"[[What's Love Got to Do with It (song)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]\" (1984). Turner won the [[Grammy Award for Record Of The Year]] for the single, and it became her first (and only) No. 1 hit in the United States. Turner's solo success continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s with multi-platinum albums and hit singles. Her U.S. Top 10 hits from this period include \"[[Better Be Good to Me]]\" (1984), \"[[Private Dancer]]\" (1984), \"[[We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)]]\" (1985), \"[[Typical Male]]\" (1986), and \"[[I Don't Wanna Fight]]\" (1993). In 1993, ''[[What's Love Got to Do with It (film)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]'', a [[biographical film]] adapted from Turner's autobiography, was released along with an accompanying [[What's Love Got to Do with It (album)|soundtrack album]]. Turner also achieved success as an actress in films such as the 1975 [[rock musical]] ''[[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]]'', the 1985 action film ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]'', and the 1993 film ''[[Last Action Hero]]''.\n\nTurner has won 12 [[Grammy Award]]s; those awards include eight competitive awards, three [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] awards, and a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Turner 63rd on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time and 17th on its list of the 100 greatest singers of all time. Turner has her own stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] and on the [[St. Louis Walk of Fame]]. She was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] with Ike Turner in 1991 and is a 2005 recipient of the [[Kennedy Center Honors]].\n\n==Early life==\nTina Turner was born Anna Mae Bullock on November 26, 1939,<ref group=lower-alpha name=Contract>Turner signed her legal name as Martha Nell Turner on a 1977 contract.</ref><ref name=HA>{{Cite web|url=https://entertainment.ha.com/itm/music-memorabilia/autographs-and-signed-items/tina-turner-signed-contract-1977-/a/696-52395.s|title=Tina Turner Signed Contract (1977)....
