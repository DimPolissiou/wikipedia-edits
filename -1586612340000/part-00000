Distinctly reddish when viewed with the naked eye, Antares is a [[slow irregular variable]] star that ranges in brightness from [[apparent magnitude]] +0.6 to +1.6. Often referred to as \"the heart of the scorpion\", Antares is flanked by [[Sigma Scorpii|\u03c3 Scorpii]] and [[Tau Scorpii|\u03c4 Scorpii]] near the center of the constellation.\n\nClassified as [[stellar classification#Spectral types|spectral type]] [[Stellar classification#Class M|M1.5Iab-Ib]], Antares is a [[red supergiant]], a large evolved massive star.  Its exact size remains uncertain, but if placed at the center of the [[Solar System]] it would reach to somewhere between the orbits of [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. Its mass is calculated to be around 12 times [[Solar mass|that of the Sun]].\n\nAntares is the brightest, most massive, and most evolved stellar member of the nearest [[stellar association|OB association]], the [[Scorpius\u2013Centaurus Association]]. Antares is a member of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the association, which contains thousands of stars with a mean age of 11 million years, about {{convert|170|pc|ly|lk=on}} from Earth.\n\nAntares appears as a single star when viewed with the naked eye, but it is actually a [[binary star]], with its two components called \u03b1 Scorpii A and \u03b1 Scorpii B.  The brighter of the pair is the red supergiant, while the fainter is a hot [[main sequence]] star of magnitude 5.5.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n[[File:Infrared Rho Ophiuchi Complex.jpg|thumb|left|Antares between [[sigma Scorpii|\u03c3]] and [[tau Scorpii|\u03c4 Scorpii]].

Antares has the [[Flamsteed designation]] 21 Scorpii, as well as catalogue designations such as HR 6134 in the [[Bright Star Catalogue]] and HD 148478 in the [[Henry Draper Catalogue]]. As a prominent [[infrared]] source, it appears in the [[Two Micron All-Sky Survey]] catalogue as 2MASS J16292443-2625549 and the [[IRAS|Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) Sky Survey Atlas]] catalogue as IRAS 16262\u20132619. It is also catalogued as a double star [[Washington Double Star Catalog|WDS]] J16294-2626 and [[Catalog of Components of Double and Multiple Stars|CCDM]] J16294-2626.  Antares is a variable star and is listed in the [[General Catalogue of Variable Stars]] but as a Bayer-designated star it does not have a separate [[variable star designation]].<ref name=gcvs/>\n\nIts traditional name ''Antares'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f08\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2}},<ref name=LSJ/> meaning \"rival to-[[Ares]]\" (\"opponent to-Mars\"), due to the similarity of its [[red]]dish hue to the appearance of the planet [[Mars]].<ref name=gettings/> The comparison of Antares with Mars may have originated with early [[Babylonian astronomy|Mesopotamian astronomers]].<ref name=\"allen\"/> Some scholars have speculated that the star may have been named after [[Antarah ibn Shaddad|Antar]], or Antarah ibn Shaddad, the [[Arabs|Arab]] warrior-hero celebrated in the pre-Islamic poems [[Mu'allaqat]].<ref name=\"allen\" /> In 2016, the [[International Astronomical Union]] organised a [[IAU Working Group on Star Names|Working Group on Star Names]] (WGSN)<ref name=\"WGSN\"/> to catalog and standardise proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016<ref name=\"WGSN1\"/> included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included ''Antares'' for the star \u03b1 Scorpii A. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.<ref name=\"IAU-CSN\"/>\n\n== Observation ==\nAntares is visible all night around May 31 of each year, when the star is at [[opposition (astronomy and astrology)|opposition]] to the [[Sun]]. Antares then rises at dusk and sets at dawn as seen at the equator. For two to three weeks on either side of November 30 Antares is not visible in the night sky, because it is near [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] with the Sun.<ref name=\"LASCO\"/> In higher northern latitudes, Antares is only visible low in the south in summertime. Higher than 64\u00ba northern latitude, the star does not rise at all. On the other side in the whole of Antarctica, the star is circumpolar as the whole continent is above 64\u00ba S latitude. <!--this period of invisibility is longer in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] than in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], since the star's [[celestial latitude]] is south of the ecliptic.-->\n\n=== History ===\n[[File:Antares near the Sun every year around 2 December.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Antares near the Sun on 30 November]][[Radial velocity]] variations were observed in the spectrum of Antares in the early 20th century<ref name=wright/> and attempts were made to derive [[spectroscopic binary|spectroscopic]] orbits.<ref name=lunt/>  It became apparent that the small variations could not be due to orbital motion, and were actually caused by pulsation of the star's atmosphere.  Even in 1928, it was calculated that the size of the star must vary by about 20%.<ref name=spencerjones/>\n\nAntares was first reported to have a companion star by [[Johann Tobias B\u00fcrg]] during an occultation on April 13, 1819,<ref name=\"burnham\" /> although this was not widely accepted and dismissed as a possible atmospheric effect.<ref name=\"Johnson1879\" />  It was then observed by Scottish astronomer [[James William Grant (astronomer)|James William Grant]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] while in [[India]] on 23 July 1844.<ref name=wikisource/> It was rediscovered by [[Ormsby M. Mitchel]] in 1846,<ref name=crossley/> and measured by [[William Rutter Dawes]] in April 1847.<ref name=innes/><ref name=dawes/>\n\nIn 1952, Antares was reported to vary in brightness.  A photographic magnitude range from 3.00 to 3.16 was described.<ref name=cousins/>  The brightness has been monitored by the [[American Association of Variable Star Observers]] since 1945,<ref name=aavso/> and it has been classified as an ''LC'' [[slow irregular variable]] star, whose [[apparent magnitude]] slowly varies between extremes of +0.6 and +1.6, although usually near magnitude +1.0. There is no obvious periodicity, but statistical analyses have suggested periods of 1,733 days or {{val|1,650|640}} days.<ref name=\"kiss\" /> No separate long secondary period has been detected,<ref name=\"percy\" /> although it has been suggested that primary periods longer than a thousand days are analogous to long secondary periods.<ref name=\"kiss\" />\n\nResearch published in 2018 demonstrated that Ngarrindjeri [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] people from South Australia observed the variability of Antares and incorporated it into their oral traditions as Waiyungari (meaning 'red man').<ref name=hamacher/>\n\n=== Occultations and conjunctions ===\n[[File:Antares-R.webm|thumb|right|Lunar Occultation of Antares (reappearance) was observed on 2006 May 14 from The Blue Mountains, Australia. Antares B reappears first, followed by Antares A 7.53 seconds later.]]\nAntares is 4.57 degrees south of the [[ecliptic]], one of four [[first magnitude star]]s within 6\u00b0 of the ecliptic (the others are [[Spica]], [[Regulus]] and [[Aldebaran]]), so it can be [[Occultation|occulted]] by the [[Moon]]. On 31 July 2009, Antares was occulted by the Moon. The event was visible in much of southern Asia and the Middle East.<ref name=\"iota\" /><ref name=\"timesofindia\" /> Every year around December 2 the Sun passes 5\u00b0 north of Antares.<ref name=\"LASCO\" /> Lunar occultations of Antares are fairly common, depending on the 18.6-year cycle of the [[lunar node]]s. The last cycle ended in 2010 and the next begins in 2023. Shown at right is a video of a reappearance event, clearly showing events for both components.\n\nAntares can also be occulted by the planets, e.g. [[Venus]], but these events are rare. The last occultation of Antares by Venus took place on September 17, 525 BC; the next one will be November 17, 2400.<ref name=jbaa/> Other planets have been calculated not to have occulted Antares over the last millennium, nor will they in the next millennium, as most planets stay near the ecliptic and pass north of Antares.<ref name=nightwatch/> Venus will be extremely near Antares on October 19, 2117 and every eight years thereafter through to October 29, 2157 it will pass ''south'' of the star.<ref>https://www.skyandtelescope.com/interactive-sky-chart/</ref>\n\n==Stellar system==\n\u03b1 Scorpii is a double star that are thought to form a [[binary system]]. The best calculated orbit for the stars is considered to be unreliable.<ref name=malkov/>  It describes an almost circular orbit seen nearly edge-on, with a period of 1,218 years and a [[semi-major axis]] of about {{val|2.9|ul=\"}}.<ref name=pavlovic/>  Other recent estimates of the period have ranged from 880 years for a calculated orbit,<ref name=baize/> to 2,562 years for a simple [[Kepler's Law]] estimate.<ref name=\"reimers\"/>\n\nEarly measurements of the pair found them to be about {{val|3.5|u=\"}} apart in 1847\u201349,<ref name=dawes/> or {{val|2.5|u=\"}} apart in 1848.<ref name=crossley/>  More modern observations consistently give separations around {{val|2.6|u=\"}} - {{val|2.8|u=\"}}.<ref name=wds/><ref name=gault/><ref name=jdso/><ref name=mcalister/>  The variations in the separation are often interpreted as evidence of orbital motion,<ref name=crossley/><ref name=\"aaa474_1_229\"/> but are more likely to be simply observational inaccuracies with very little true relative motion between the two components.<ref name=pavlovic/>\n\nThe pair have a [[projected separation]] of about 529 [[astronomical unit]]s (AU) (\u2248 80 billion km) at the estimated distance of Antares, giving a minimum value for the distance between them. Spectroscopic examination of the energy states in the outflow of matter from the companion star suggests that it is over {{val|220|ul=AU}} beyond the primary (more than 110 billion km).<ref name=\"aaa474_1_229\"/>\n\n===Antares===\n[[File:VLTI reconstructed view of the surface of Antares.jpg|thumb|left|[[VLTI]] reconstructed view of the surface of Antares A|alt=]]\nAntares is a red [[supergiant star]] with a [[stellar classification]] of M1.5Iab-Ib, and is indicated to be a spectral standard for that class.<ref name=\"perkins\" /> Due to the nature of the star, the derived [[parallax]] measurements have large errors, so that the true distance of Antares is approximately {{Convert|550|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on}} from the Sun.<ref name=\"aaa474_2_653\" />\n\nThe [[Absolute magnitude|brightness]] of Antares at visual wavelengths is about 10,000 times that of the [[Sun]], but because the star radiates a considerable part of its energy in the [[infrared]] part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], the true [[bolometric luminosity]] is around 100,000 times that of the Sun. There is a large margin of error assigned to values for the bolometric luminosity, typically 30% or more. There is also considerable variation between values published by different authors, for example {{solar luminosity|75,900}} and {{solar luminosity|97,700}} published in 2012 and 2013.<ref name=\"Pecaut\" /><ref name=\"ohnaka2013\" />\n\nThe mass of the star has been calculated to be about {{solar mass|12}},<ref name=\"Pecaut\" /> or {{solar mass|11 to 14.3}}.<ref name=\"ohnaka2013\" /> Comparison of the [[effective temperature]] and luminosity of Antares to theoretical evolutionary tracks for massive stars suggest a progenitor mass of {{solar mass|17}} and an age of 12 million years (MYr),<ref name=\"Pecaut\" /> or an initial mass of {{solar mass|15}} and an age of 11 to 15 MYr.<ref name=\"ohnaka2013\" /> Massive stars like Antares are expected to explode as [[supernova]]e.<ref name=\"Hockey2010\" />\n\n[[File:Redgiants.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|Comparison between the [[red supergiant]] Antares and the Sun, shown as the tiny dot toward the upper right|alt=Portion of a large yellow-orange circle representing Antares, with a black circle for the orbit of [[Mars]], and images of [[Arcturus]] and the sun to scale]]\nLike most cool supergiants, Antares's size has much uncertainty due to the tenuous and translucent nature of the extended outer regions of the star. Defining an effective temperature is difficult due to spectral lines being generated at different depths in the atmosphere, and linear measurements produce different results depending on the wavelength observed.<ref name=\"Ireland2004\" /> In addition, Antares appears to pulsate, varying its radius by {{solar radius|165}} or 19%.<ref name=\"Pecaut\" /> It also varies in temperature by 150 K, lagging 70 days behind [[radial velocity]] changes which are likely to be caused by the pulsations.<ref name=\"pugh2013\" />\n\nThe diameter of Antares can be measured most accurately using [[interferometry]] or observing [[Occultation|lunar occultation]]s events. An apparent diameter from occultations 41.3 \u00b1 0.1 [[Minute and second of arc#Symbols and abbreviations|milliarcseconds]] has been published.<ref name=\"richichi\" /> Interferometry allows synthesis of a view of the stellar disc, which is then represented as a [[Limb darkening|limb-darkened]] disk surrounded by an extended atmosphere. The diameter of the limb-darkened disk was measured as {{val|37.38|0.06|u=milliarcseconds}} in 2009 and {{val|37.31|0.09|u=milliarcseconds}} in 2010. The linear radius of the star can be calculated from its angular diameter and distance. However, the distance to Antares is not known with the same accuracy as modern measurements of its diameter.\n\nThe [[Hipparcos]] satellite's [[parallax|trigonometric parallax]] of {{val|5.89|1.00|u=mas}}<ref name=\"HIPPARCOS\" /> leads to a radius of about {{solar radius|680}}.<ref name=\"ohnaka2013\" /> Older radii estimates exceeding {{solar radius|850}} were derived from older measurements of the diameter,<ref name=\"pugh2013\" /> but those measurements are likely to have been affected by asymmetry of the atmosphere and the narrow range of infrared wavelengths observed; Antares has an extended shell which radiates strongly at those particular wavelengths.<ref name=\"ohnaka2013\" /> Despite its large size compared to the Sun, Antares is dwarfed by even larger red supergiants, such as [[VY Canis Majoris]], which is almost 30 times larger in terms of volume, or [[VV Cephei]] A and [[Mu Cephei]].\n\nAntares, like the similarly-sized red supergiant [[Betelgeuse]] in the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], will almost certainly explode as a [[supernova]],<ref name=\"Firestone2014\" /> possibly in the next ten thousand years. For a few months, the Antares supernova could be as bright as the full moon and be visible in daytime.<ref name=\"Hockey2010\" />\n\n===Antares B===\nAntares B is a magnitude 5.5 [[B-type main-sequence star|blue-white main-sequence star]] of spectral type B2.5V; it also has numerous unusual spectral lines suggesting it has been polluted by matter ejected by Antares.<ref name=\"aaa474_1_229\" />  It is assumed to be a relatively normal early-B main sequence star with a mass around {{solar mass|7|link=y}}, a temperature around {{val|18,500|fmt=commas|ul=K}}, and a radius of about {{solar radius|5}}.<ref name=antaresb/>\n\nAntares B is normally difficult to see in small telescopes due to glare from Antares, but can sometimes be seen in apertures over {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=off}}.<ref name=\"schaaf\" /> It is often described as green, but this is probably either a [[contrast effect]],<ref name=\"kaler\" /> or the result of the mixing of light from the two stars when they are seen together through a telescope and are too close to be completely resolved. Antares B can sometimes be observed with a small telescope for a few seconds during lunar [[occultation]]s while Antares is hidden by the Moon.<ref name=\"burnham\" />  Antares B appears a profound blue or bluish-green color, in contrast to the orange-red Antares.<ref name=\"Johnson1879\" /><ref name=\"burnham\" /><ref name=crossley/>\n\n==Etymology and mythology==\n[[File:Antares overlooking an Auxiliary Telescope.jpg|thumb|left|Antares seen from the ground]]\nIn the [[Babylonian star catalogues]] dating from at least 1100 BCE, Antares was called GABA GIR.TAB, \"the Breast of the Scorpion\".

It was the national star of the [[Shang Dynasty]], and it was sometimes referred to as ({{zh|c=\u706b\u661f|p=Hu\u01d2x\u012bng|l=fiery star}}) because of its reddish appearance.\n\nThe [[M\u0101ori people]] of New Zealand call Antares ''R\u0113hua'', and regard it as the chief of all the stars. R\u0113hua is father of ''[[Puanga]]/Puaka'' ([[Rigel]]), an important star in the calculation of the M\u0101ori calendar. The Wotjobaluk [[Koori]] people of Victoria, Australia, knew Antares as ''Djuit'', son of ''Marpean-kurrk'' ([[Arcturus]]); the stars on each side represented his wives.

Distinctly reddish when viewed with the naked eye, Antares is a [[slow irregular variable]] star that ranges in brightness from [[apparent magnitude]] +0.6 to +1.6. Often referred to as \"the heart of the scorpion\", Antares is flanked by [[Sigma Scorpii|\u03c3 Scorpii]] and [[Tau Scorpii|\u03c4 Scorpii]] near the center of the constellation.\n\nClassified as [[stellar classification#Spectral types|spectral type]] [[Stellar classification#Class M|M1.5Iab-Ib]], Antares is a [[red supergiant]], a large evolved massive star.  Its exact size remains uncertain, but if placed at the center of the [[Solar System]] it would reach to somewhere between the orbits of [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. Its mass is calculated to be around 12 times [[Solar mass|that of the Sun]].\n\nAntares is the brightest, most massive, and most evolved stellar member of the nearest [[stellar association|OB association]], the [[Scorpius\u2013Centaurus Association]]. Antares is a member of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the association, which contains thousands of stars with a mean age of 11 million years, about {{convert|170|pc|ly|lk=on}} from Earth.\n\nAntares appears as a single star when viewed with the naked eye, but it is actually a [[binary star]], with its two components called \u03b1 Scorpii A and \u03b1 Scorpii B.  The brighter of the pair is the red supergiant, while the fainter is a hot [[main sequence]] star of magnitude 5.5.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n[[File:Infrared Rho Ophiuchi Complex.jpg|thumb|left|Antares between [[sigma Scorpii|\u03c3]] and [[tau Scorpii|\u03c4 Scorpii]]. Antares appears white in this [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|WISE]] false colour [[infrared]] image.]]\n''\u03b1 Scorpii'' (Latinised to ''Alpha Scorpii'') is the star's [[Bayer designation]]. Antares has the [[Flamsteed designation]] 21 Scorpii, as well as catalogue designations such as HR 6134 in the [[Bright Star Catalogue]] and HD 148478 in the [[Henry Draper Catalogue]]. As a prominent [[infrared]] source, it appears in the [[Two Micron All-Sky Survey]] catalogue as 2MASS J16292443-2625549 and the [[IRAS|Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) Sky Survey Atlas]] catalogue as IRAS 16262\u20132619. It is also catalogued as a double star [[Washington Double Star Catalog|WDS]] J16294-2626 and [[Catalog of Components of Double and Multiple Stars|CCDM]] J16294-2626.  Antares is a variable star and is listed in the [[General Catalogue of Variable Stars]] but as a Bayer-designated star it does not have a separate [[variable star designation]].<ref name=gcvs/>\n\nIts traditional name ''Antares'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f08\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2}},<ref name=LSJ/> meaning \"rival to-[[Ares]]\" (\"opponent to-Mars\"), due to the similarity of its [[red]]dish hue to the appearance of the planet [[Mars]].<ref name=gettings/> The comparison of Antares with Mars may have originated with early [[Babylonian astronomy|Mesopotamian astronomers]].<ref name=\"allen\"/> Some scholars have speculated that the star may have been named after [[Antarah ibn Shaddad|Antar]], or Antarah ibn Shaddad, the [[Arabs|Arab]] warrior-hero celebrated in the pre-Islamic poems [[Mu'allaqat]].<ref name=\"allen\" /> In 2016, the [[International Astronomical Union]] organised a [[IAU Working Group on Star Names|Working Group on Star Names]] (WGSN)<ref name=\"WGSN\"/> to catalog and standardise proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016<ref name=\"WGSN1\"/> included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included ''Antares'' for the star \u03b1 Scorpii A. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.<ref name=\"IAU-CSN\"/>\n\n== Observation ==\nAntares is visible all night around May 31 of each year, when the star is at [[opposition (astronomy and astrology)|opposition]] to the [[Sun]]. Antares then rises at dusk and sets at dawn as seen at the equator. For two to three weeks on either side of November 30 Antares is not visible in the night sky, because it is near [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] with the Sun.<ref name=\"LASCO\"/> In higher northern latitudes, Antares is only visible low in the south in summertime. Higher than 64\u00ba northern latitude, the star does not rise at all. On the other side in the whole of Antarctica, the star is circumpolar as the whole continent is above 64\u00ba S latitude. <!--this period of invisibility is longer in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] than in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], since the star's [[celestial latitude]] is south of the ecliptic.-->\n\n=== History ===\n[[File:Antares near the Sun every year around 2 December.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Antares near the Sun on 30 November]][[Radial velocity]] variations were observed in the spectrum of Antares in the early 20th century<ref name=wright/> and attempts were made to derive [[spectroscopic binary|spectroscopic]] orbits.<ref name=lunt/>  It became apparent that the small variations could not be due to orbital motion, and were actually caused by pulsation of the star's atmosphere.  Even in 1928, it was calculated that the size of the star must vary by about 20%.<ref name=spencerjones/>\n\nAntares was first reported to have a companion star by [[Johann Tobias B\u00fcrg]] during an occultation on April 13, 1819,<ref name=\"burnham\" /> although this was not widely accepted and dismissed as a possible atmospheric effect.<ref name=\"Johnson1879\" />  It was then observed by Scottish astronomer [[James William Grant (astronomer)|James William Grant]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] while in [[India]] on 23 July 1844.<ref name=wikisource/> It was rediscovered by [[Ormsby M. Mitchel]] in 1846,<ref name=crossley/> and measured by [[William Rutter Dawes]] in April 1847.<ref name=innes/><ref name=dawes/>\n\nIn 1952, Antares was reported to vary in brightness.  A photographic magnitude range from 3.00 to 3.16 was described.<ref name=cousins/>  The brightness has been monitored by the [[American Association of Variable Star Observers]] since 1945,<ref name=aavso/> and it has been classified as an ''LC'' [[slow irregular variable]] star, whose [[apparent magnitude]] slowly varies between extremes of +0.6 and +1.6, although usually near magnitude +1.0. There is no obvious periodicity, but statistical analyses have suggested periods of 1,733 days or {{val|1,650|640}} days.<ref name=\"kiss\" /> No separate long secondary period has been detected,<ref name=\"percy\" /> although it has been suggested that primary periods longer than a thousand days are analogous to long secondary periods.<ref name=\"kiss\" />\n\nResearch published in 2018 demonstrated that Ngarrindjeri [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] people from South Australia observed the variability of Antares and incorporated it into their oral traditions as Waiyungari (meaning 'red man').<ref name=hamacher/>\n\n=== Occultations and Conjunctions ===\n[[File:Antares-R.webm|thumb|right|Lunar Occultation of Antares (reappearance) was observed on 2006 May 14 from The Blue Mountains, Australia. Antares B reappears first, followed by Antares A 7.53 seconds later.]]\nAntares is 4.57 degrees south of the [[ecliptic]], one of four [[first magnitude star]]s within 6\u00b0 of the ecliptic (the others are [[Spica]], [[Regulus]] and [[Aldebaran]]), so it can be [[Occultation|occulted]] by the [[Moon]]. On 31 July 2009, Antares was occulted by the Moon. The event was visible in much of southern Asia and the Middle East.<ref name=\"iota\" /><ref name=\"timesofindia\" /> Every year around December 2 the Sun passes 5\u00b0 north of Antares.<ref name=\"LASCO\" /> Lunar occultations of Antares are fairly common, depending on the 18.6-year cycle of the [[lunar node]]s. The last cycle ended in 2010 and the next begins in 2023. Shown at right is a video of a reappearance event, clearly showing events for both components.\n\nAntares can also be occulted by the planets, e.g. [[Venus]], but these events are rare. The last occultation of Antares by Venus took place on September 17, 525 BC; the next one will be November 17, 2400.<ref name=jbaa/> Other planets have been calculated not to have occulted Antares over the last millennium, nor will they in the next millennium, as most planets stay near the ecliptic and pass north of Antares.<ref name=nightwatch/> Venus will be extremely near Antares on October 19, 2117 and every eight years thereafter through to October 29, 2157 it will pass ''south'' of the star.<ref>https://www.skyandtelescope.com/interactive-sky-chart/</ref>\n\n==Stellar system==\n\u03b1 Scorpii is a double star that are thought to form a [[binary system]]. The best calculated orbit for the stars is considered to be unreliable.<ref name=malkov/>  It describes an almost circular orbit seen nearly edge-on, with a period of 1,218 years and a [[semi-major axis]] of about {{val|2.9|ul=\"}}.<ref name=pavlovic/>  Other recent estimates of the period have ranged from 880 years for a calculated orbit,<ref name=baize/> to 2,562 years for a simple [[Kepler's Law]] estimate.<ref name=\"reimers\"/>\n\nEarly measurements of the pair found them to be about {{val|3.5|u=\"}} apart in 1847\u201349,<ref name=dawes/> or {{val|2.5|u=\"}} apart in 1848.<ref name=crossley/>  More modern observations consistently give separations around {{val|2.6|u=\"}} - {{val|2.8|u=\"}}.<ref name=wds/><ref name=gault/><ref name=jdso/><ref name=mcalister/>  The variations in the separation are often interpreted as evidence of orbital motion,<ref name=crossley/><ref name=\"aaa474_1_229\"/> but are more likely to be simply observational inaccuracies with very little true relative motion between the two components.<ref name=pavlovic/>\n\nThe pair have a [[projected separation]] of about 529 [[astronomical unit]]s (AU) (\u2248 80 billion km) at the estimated distance of Antares, giving a minimum value for the distance between them. Spectroscopic examination of the energy states in the outflow of matter from the companion star suggests that it is over {{val|220|ul=AU}} beyond the primary (more than 110 billion km).<ref name=\"aaa474_1_229\"/>\n\n===Antares===\n[[File:VLTI reconstructed view of the surface of Antares.jpg|thumb|left|[[VLTI]] reconstructed view of the surface of Antares A|alt=]]\nAntares is a red [[supergiant star]] with a [[stellar classification]] of M1.5Iab-Ib, and is indicated to be a spectral standard for that class.<ref name=\"perkins\" /> Due to the nature of the star, the derived [[parallax]] measurements have large errors, so that the true distance of Antares is approximately {{Convert|550|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on}} from the Sun.<ref name=\"aaa474_2_653\" />\n\nThe [[Absolute magnitude|brightness]] of Antares at visual wavelengths is about 10,000 times that of the [[Sun]], but because the star radiates a considerable part of its energy in the [[infrared]] part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], the true [[bolometric luminosity]] is around 100,000 times that of the Sun. There is a large margin of error assigned to values for the bolometric luminosity, typically 30% or more. There is also considerable variation between values published by different authors, for example {{solar luminosity|75,900}} and {{solar luminosity|97,700}} published in 2012 and 2013.<ref name=\"Pecaut\" /><ref name=\"ohnaka2013\" />\n\nThe mass of the star has been calculated to be about {{solar mass|12}},<ref name=\"Pecaut\" /> or {{solar mass|11 to 14.3}}.<ref name=\"ohnaka2013\" /> Comparison of the [[effective temperature]] and luminosity of Antares to theoretical evolutionary tracks for massive stars suggest a progenitor mass of {{solar mass|17}} and an age of 12 million years (MYr),<ref name=\"Pecaut\" /> or an initial mass of {{solar mass|15}} and an age of 11 to 15 MYr.<ref name=\"ohnaka2013\" /> Massive stars like Antares are expected to explode as [[supernova]]e.<ref name=\"Hockey2010\" />\n\n[[File:Redgiants.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|Comparison between the [[red supergiant]] Antares and the Sun, shown as the tiny dot toward the upper right|alt=Portion of a large yellow-orange circle representing Antares, with a black circle for the orbit of [[Mars]], and images of [[Arcturus]] and the sun to scale]]\nLike most cool supergiants, Antares's size has much uncertainty due to the tenuous and translucent nature of the extended outer regions of the star. Defining an effective temperature is difficult due to spectral lines being generated at different depths in the atmosphere, and linear measurements produce different results depending on the wavelength observed.<ref name=\"Ireland2004\" /> In addition, Antares appears to pulsate, varying its radius by {{solar radius|165}} or 19%.<ref name=\"Pecaut\" /> It also varies in temperature by 150 K, lagging 70 days behind [[radial velocity]] changes which are likely to be caused by the pulsations.<ref name=\"pugh2013\" />\n\nThe diameter of Antares can be measured most accurately using [[interferometry]] or observing [[Occultation|lunar occultation]]s events. An apparent diameter from occultations 41.3 \u00b1 0.1 [[Minute and second of arc#Symbols and abbreviations|milliarcseconds]] has been published.<ref name=\"richichi\" /> Interferometry allows synthesis of a view of the stellar disc, which is then represented as a [[Limb darkening|limb-darkened]] disk surrounded by an extended atmosphere. The diameter of the limb-darkened disk was measured as {{val|37.38|0.06|u=milliarcseconds}} in 2009 and {{val|37.31|0.09|u=milliarcseconds}} in 2010. The linear radius of the star can be calculated from its angular diameter and distance. However, the distance to Antares is not known with the same accuracy as modern measurements of its diameter.\n\nThe [[Hipparcos]] satellite's [[parallax|trigonometric parallax]] of {{val|5.89|1.00|u=mas}}<ref name=\"HIPPARCOS\" /> leads to a radius of about {{solar radius|680}}.<ref name=\"ohnaka2013\" /> Older radii estimates exceeding {{solar radius|850}} were derived from older measurements of the diameter,<ref name=\"pugh2013\" /> but those measurements are likely to have been affected by asymmetry of the atmosphere and the narrow range of infrared wavelengths observed; Antares has an extended shell which radiates strongly at those particular wavelengths.<ref name=\"ohnaka2013\" /> Despite its large size compared to the Sun, Antares is dwarfed by even larger red supergiants, such as [[VY Canis Majoris]], which is almost 30 times larger in terms of volume, or [[VV Cephei]] A and [[Mu Cephei]].\n\nAntares, like the similarly-sized red supergiant [[Betelgeuse]] in the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], will almost certainly explode as a [[supernova]],<ref name=\"Firestone2014\" /> possibly in the next ten thousand years. For a few months, the Antares supernova could be as bright as the full moon and be visible in daytime.<ref name=\"Hockey2010\" />\n\n===Antares B===\nAntares B is a magnitude 5.5 [[B-type main-sequence star|blue-white main-sequence star]] of spectral type B2.5V; it also has numerous unusual spectral lines suggesting it has been polluted by matter ejected by Antares.<ref name=\"aaa474_1_229\" />  It is assumed to be a relatively normal early-B main sequence star with a mass around {{solar mass|7|link=y}}, a temperature around {{val|18,500|fmt=commas|ul=K}}, and a radius of about {{solar radius|5}}.<ref name=antaresb/>\n\nAntares B is normally difficult to see in small telescopes due to glare from Antares, but can sometimes be seen in apertures over {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=off}}.<ref name=\"schaaf\" /> It is often described as green, but this is probably either a [[contrast effect]],<ref name=\"kaler\" /> or the result of the mixing of light from the two stars when they are seen together through a telescope and are too close to be completely resolved. Antares B can sometimes be observed with a small telescope for a few seconds during lunar [[occultation]]s while Antares is hidden by the Moon.<ref name=\"burnham\" />  Antares B appears a profound blue or bluish-green color, in contrast to the orange-red Antares.<ref name=\"Johnson1879\" /><ref name=\"burnham\" /><ref name=crossley/>\n\n==Etymology and mythology==\n[[File:Antares overlooking an Auxiliary Telescope.jpg|thumb|left|Antares seen from the ground]]\nIn the [[Babylonian star catalogues]] dating from at least 1100 BCE, Antares was called GABA GIR.TAB, \"the Breast of the Scorpion\".

It was the national star of the [[Shang Dynasty]], and it was sometimes referred to as ({{zh|c=\u706b\u661f|p=Hu\u01d2x\u012bng|l=fiery star}}) because of its reddish appearance.\n\nThe [[M\u0101ori people]] of New Zealand call Antares ''R\u0113hua'', and regard it as the chief of all the stars. R\u0113hua is father of ''[[Puanga]]/Puaka'' ([[Rigel]]), an important star in the calculation of the M\u0101ori calendar. The Wotjobaluk [[Koori]] people of Victoria, Australia, knew Antares as ''Djuit'', son of ''Marpean-kurrk'' ([[Arcturus]]); the stars on each side represented his wives.

After the coupon system disappeared, an average urban family spent between 75 and 85 percent of their income on food, while state farmers were spending only a third of their income on food. These disparities show that North Korea does not have safety net mechanisms to protect the vulnerable people in society, such as housewives and the elderly.<ref name=\"Amnesty International\"/>\n\nWhen the food crisis began, access to food came through a public distribution system (PDS) controlled by the regime, and entitlements were partly a function of political status. As the planned economy crumbled and markets developed in response to the state's inability to fulfill its obligations under the old social compact, the character of the crisis changed. Current shortages bear a closer resemblance to food emergencies in market and transition economies, where access to food is determined by one's capacity to command resources in the marketplace. This type of emergency is no less severe, but poses different challenges to outside donors.<ref name=HHR>{{cite book|title=Hunger and Human Rights: The Politics of Famine in North Korea |publisher=Committee for Human Rights in North Korea |page=9 |url=http://hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/Hunger_and_Human_Rights.pdf |author1=Stephan Haggard |author2=Marcus Noland |accessdate=February 3, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107091010/http://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/Hunger_and_Human_Rights.pdf |archivedate=November 7, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nFood is distributed to the civilian population of North Korea through two channels. Workers on state and cooperative farms account for roughly 30 percent of the population, and most of these farmers are granted an annual allotment of grain at the time of the harvest. However, the country is highly urbanized, and the bulk of the population is fed through the PDS. The PDS distributes food as a monthly or biweekly ration. Rations, in turn, vary according to occupational status and age. For example, high-ranking party, government, and military officials are fed through separate distribution channels and receive higher rations, as do certain classes of workers.<ref name=\"HHR\"/>\n\nIn confronting the fundamentally non-cooperative stance of the North Korean government, the [[humanitarian]] community has pursued two basic strategies to guarantee the integrity of its assistance: the targeting of vulnerable groups, and the monitoring of food deliveries to assure that these targeted populations are being reached. At virtually every point, the North Korean government has placed roadblocks in the way of the donor community in North Korea, which succeeded to the extent that it did only through extraordinary perspicacity and flexibility. Yet, even by its own admission, this monitoring effort is a leaky sieve, and it is estimated that between 10 and 30 percent of food aid is diverted.

After the coupon system disappeared, an average urban family spent between 75 and 85 percent of their income on food, while state farmers were spending only a third of their income on food. These disparities show that North Korea does not have safety net mechanisms to protect the vulnerable people in society, such as housewives and the elderly.<ref name=\"Amnesty International\"/>\n\nWhen the food crisis began, access to food came through a public distribution system (PDS) controlled by the regime, and entitlements were partly a function of political status. As the planned economy crumbled and markets developed in response to the state's inability to fulfill its obligations under the old social compact, the character of the crisis changed. Current shortages bear a closer resemblance to food emergencies in market and transition economies, where access to food is determined by one's capacity to command resources in the marketplace. This type of emergency is no less severe, but poses different challenges to outside donors.<ref name=HHR>{{cite book|title=Hunger and Human Rights: The Politics of Famine in North Korea |publisher=Committee for Human Rights in North Korea |page=9 |url=http://hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/Hunger_and_Human_Rights.pdf |author1=Stephan Haggard |author2=Marcus Noland |accessdate=February 3, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107091010/http://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/Hunger_and_Human_Rights.pdf |archivedate=November 7, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nFood is distributed to the civilian population of North Korea through two channels. Workers on state and cooperative farms account for roughly 30 percent of the population, and most of these farmers are granted an annual allotment of grain at the time of the harvest. However, the country is highly urbanized, and the bulk of the population is fed through the PDS. The PDS distributes food as a monthly or biweekly ration. Rations, in turn, vary according to occupational status and age. For example, high-ranking party, government, and military officials are fed through separate distribution channels and receive higher rations, as do certain classes of workers.<ref name=\"HHR\"/>\n\nIn confronting the fundamentally non-cooperative stance of the North Korean government, the [[humanitarian]] community has pursued two basic strategies to guarantee the integrity of its assistance: the targeting of vulnerable groups, and the monitoring of food deliveries to assure that these targeted populations are being reached. At virtually every point, the North Korean government has placed roadblocks in the way of the donor community in North Korea, which succeeded to the extent that it did only through extraordinary perspicacity and flexibility. Yet, even by its own admission, this monitoring effort is a leaky sieve, and it is estimated that between 10 and 30 percent of food aid is diverted. Most concerns with diversion center on the appropriation of food by the military. Military and party elites have other sources of food; an equal if not greater problem is the diversion of food to the market or to less deserving groups.<ref name=\"HHR\"/>\n\nAlso, the remote regions that suffered from the most severe famine conditions were the first regions to stop receiving shipments of food supplies, and at the same time, as local industry collapsed, residents' purchasing power decreased.<ref name=Natsios>{{cite book|last=Natsios|first=Andrew|title=The Politics of Famine in North Korea|year=1999|publisher=US Institute of Peace|pages=5\u201311}}</ref>\n\nRestrictions on the freedom to move caused the so-called 'hostile class' \u2012 whose members were relocated to remote mountain areas \u2012 to suffer from the limited access to food.<ref name=\"Amnesty International\"/>\n\nA UN human rights office report released in May 2019 highlighted the \u201cappalling\u201d levels of hunger that have been affecting around 10.9 million people particularly in north-eastern and rural provinces of North Korea.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24651&LangID=E|title=People in North Korea trapped in vicious cycle of deprivation, corruption and repression \u2013 UN human rights report|accessdate=28 May 2019|publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights}}</ref> UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, [[Michelle Bachelet]] said, \u201cThe rights to food, health, shelter, work, freedom of movement and liberty are universal and inalienable, but in North Korea they depend primarily on the ability of individuals to bribe State officials.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/05/1039251|title=North Koreans trapped in \u2018vicious cycle of deprivation, corruption, repression\u2019 and endemic bribery: UN human rights office|accessdate=28 May 2019|publisher=UN News}}</ref>\n\n====Food shortage and malnutrition in detention====\nAccording to testimony by a previous detainee, detention was most often severely overcrowded and there existed a serious lack of food. \"amazingly made life in Yodok very difficult.

This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also an important practice for the general public.{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Public health==\n[[Image:HandCleaning.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|Hand cleaning station at the entrance of the [[Toronto General Hospital]]]]\n\n=== Health benefits ===\nHand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of [[influenza]], [[coronavirus]], and other [[infectious diseases]];<ref name=\"fmhh\">{{cite journal |last=Cowling |first=Benjamin J. |title=Facemasks and Hand Hygiene to Prevent Influenza Transmission in Households |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=151 |issue=7 |pages=437\u201346 |year=2009 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-151-7-200910060-00142 |pmid=19652172 |last2=Chan |first2=KH |last3=Fang |first3=VJ |last4=Cheng |first4=CK |last5=Fung |first5=RO |last6=Wai |first6=W |last7=Sin |first7=J |last8=Seto |first8=WH |last9=Yung |first9=R |displayauthors=1}}</ref><ref name=\"who-workplace-covid19\">{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/getting-workplace-ready-for-covid-19.pdf |title=Getting your workplace ready for COVID-19 |publisher=World Health Organization |date=27 February 2020 |access-date=27 March 2020}}</ref> preventing infectious causes of [[diarrhea]];<ref name=\"cdwt\">{{cite journal |last = Luby |first = Stephen P. |title = Combining drinking water treatment and hand washing for diarrhoea prevention, a cluster randomized controlled trial |journal = Tropical Medicine & International Health |volume = 11 |issue = 4 |pages = 479\u201389 |year = 2006 |pmid = 16553931 |doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2006.01592.x |last2 = Agboatwalla |first2 = Mubina |last3 = Painter |first3 = John |last4 = Altaf |first4 = Arshad |last5 = Billhimer |first5 = Ward |last6 = Keswick |first6 = Bruce |last7 = Hoekstra |first7 = Robert M.|title-link = cluster randomized controlled trial }}</ref> decreasing respiratory infections;<ref name=\"pcda\">{{cite web |last = Scott |first = Beth |title = Protecting Children from Diarrhoea and Acute Respiratory Infections: The Role of Hand Washing Promotion in Water and Sanitation Programmes |url = http://www.searo.who.int/LinkFiles/Regional_Health_Forum_1.pdf#page=49 |accessdate = 21 May 2009 |display-authors = etal |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090628221929/http://www.searo.who.int/LinkFiles/Regional_Health_Forum_1.pdf#page=49 |archive-date = 28 June 2009 |url-status = dead }}</ref> \nand reducing [[infant mortality]] rate at [[home birth]] deliveries.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Impact of Maternal and Birth Attendant Hand-washing on Neonatal Mortality in Southern Nepal|journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med.|volume=162|issue=7|doi=10.1001/archpedi.162.7.603|pmid = 18606930|pmc = 2587156|year=2008|last1 = Rhee|first1 = V.|last2 = Mullany|first2 = L.

A growing volume of research suggests paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric [[hand dryer]]s found in many washrooms.\n\nIn 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper-towel industry the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, warm-air hand dryers and the more modern jet-air hand dryers.<ref>[http://www.europeantissue.com/pdfs/090402-2008%20WUS%20Westminster%20University%20hygiene%20study,%20nov2008.pdf A comparative study of three different hand drying methods: paper towel, warm air dryer, jet air dryer\u2019] by Keith Redway and Shameem Fawdar of the School of Biosciences, University of Westminster London</ref> The key findings were:\n* After washing and drying hands with the warm-air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average on the finger pads by 194% and on the palms by 254%.\n* Drying with the jet-air dryer resulted in an increase on average of the total number of bacteria on the finger pads by 42% and on the palms by 15%.\n* After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced on average on the finger pads by up to 76% and on the palms by up to 77%.\n\nThe scientists also carried out tests to establish whether there was the potential for cross contamination of other washroom users and the washroom environment as a result of each type of drying method. They found that:\n* The jet-air dryer, which blows air out of the unit at claimed speeds of {{convert|180|m/s|km/h mi/h|abbr=on}}, was capable of blowing micro-organisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 metres away.\n* Use of a warm-air hand dryer spread micro-organisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.\n* Paper towels showed no significant spread of micro-organisms.\n\nIn 2005, in a study conducted by T\u00dcV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.<ref>T\u00dcV Produkt und Umwelt GmbH Report No. 425-452006 [http://www.europeantissue.com/pdfs/090410%20T%C3%9CV%20-%20Study%20of%20different%20methods%20used%20for%20drying%20hands%20Sept%202005.pdf A report concerning a study conducted with regard to the different methods used for drying hands; September 2005]</ref> The following changes in the bacterial count after drying the hands were observed:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

If there is debris under fingernails, a bristle brush may be used to remove it. Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe dry with a clean towel. After drying, the paper towel should be used to turn off the water (and open any exit door if necessary). This avoids re-contaminating the hands from those surfaces.\n\nThe purpose of hand-washing in the health-care setting is to remove [[pathogens|pathogenic microorganisms]] (\"germs\") and avoid transmitting them.

All jewelry should be removed. This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2\u20136 minutes. Long scrub-times (10 minutes) are not necessary.

It originates from the bible passage in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] where [[Pontius Pilate]] washed his hands of the decision to crucify [[Jesus Christ]], but has become a phrase with a much wider usage in some English communities.\n\nIn [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Macbeth]], [[Lady Macbeth (Shakespeare)|Lady Macbeth]] begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse an imagined stain, representing her guilty conscience regarding crimes she had committed and induced her husband to commit.\n\nIt has also been found that people, after having recalled or contemplated unethical acts, tend to wash hands more often than others, and tend to value hand washing equipment more. Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such a contemplation are less likely to engage in other \"cleansing\" compensatory actions, such as volunteering.<ref>{{cite news |author=Benedict Carey |title=Lady Macbeth Not Alone in Her Quest for Spotlessness |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/12/health/psychology/12macbeth.html |work=The New York Times |date=12 September 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhong CB, Liljenquist K |title=Washing away your sins: threatened morality and physical cleansing |journal=Science |volume=313 |issue=5792 |pages=1451\u201352 |year=2006 |pmid=16960010 |doi=10.1126/science.1130726|bibcode=2006Sci...313.1451Z |citeseerx=10.1.1.181.571 }}<br />{{cite journal |vauthors=Schnall S, Benton J, Harvey S |title=Clean Conscience: Cleanliness Reduces the Severity of Moral Judgments |journal=Psychological Science |volume=16 |pages=780\u201384 |year=2005 |pmid=16181440 |issue=10 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01614.x}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{seealso|Muslim hygienical jurisprudence}}\nReligions prescribe hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes.<ref name=religion/>\n\nSymbolic hand washing, using water but no soap to wash hands, is a part of [[Ritual purification|ritual hand washing]] featured in many religions, including [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]], [[Hinduism]], [[Ablution in Judaism|tevilah and netilat yadayim]] in [[Judaism]], [[Lavabo]] in [[Christianity]], and [[Wudhu]] in Islam.<ref name=religion/>\n\nReligions also prescribe hygienic hand washing, especially after certain actions.

''[[Tolo News]]'' reported that this was the fourth release of individuals tied to Hezbi Islami, and it brought the total number of released men to 500.\n\n==Accused combatant prisoners at Guantanamo==\nDozens of inmates at the United States prison at Guantanamo Bay faced allegations that they had been associated with the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin.\n\nOriginally the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] [[United States President|Presidency]] asserted it was not obliged to let any captives apprehended in Afghanistan know why they were being held, or to provide a venue where they could challenge the allegations against them. However, the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s ruling in [[Rasul v. Bush]] required the institution of a review. The Supreme Court recommended the reviews be modeled after the [[Army Regulation 190-8 Tribunal]]s that were ordinarily used to determine whether captives were innocent civilians who should be released, [[lawful combatant]]s entitled to [[Prisoner of War]] status, or [[war criminal]]s who could be tried, and who weren't protected by all the provisions of the [[Geneva Conventions]].\n\nThe [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] set up the [[Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants]] (OARDEC). OARDEC administered an initial [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]] for the 558 [[Guantanamo captive]]s who were still in the detention camp as of August 2004. Unlike the AR 190-8 Tribunals, the Combatant Status Review Tribunals were not authorized to determine whether captives were entitled to POW status, only whether they were \"[[enemy combatant]]s. OARDEC also administered annual [[Administrative Review Board]] hearings. The Boards were only authorized to make a recommendation as to whether captives might represent an ongoing threat, or might continue to hold intelligence value, and therefore should continue to be held in US custody.\n\nClose to 10,000 pages of documents from the Combatant Status Review Tribunals and Administrative Review Board hearings were released after contested [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests.\n\nDozens of captives faced allegations that they had been associated with the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin. Some of the documents just alleged that a captive was associated with Hezb-e-Islami, without explaining why this implied they were an \"enemy combatant\". Other documents did provide brief explanations as how an association with Hezb-e-Islami implied a captive was an \"enemy combatant\".

''[[Tolo News]]'' reported that this was the fourth release of individuals tied to Hezbi Islami, and it brought the total number of released men to 500.\n\n==Accused combatant prisoners at Guantanamo==\nDozens of inmates at the United States prison at Guantanamo Bay faced allegations that they had been associated with the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin.\n\nOriginally the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] [[United States President|Presidency]] asserted it was not obliged to let any captives apprehended in Afghanistan know why they were being held, or to provide a venue where they could challenge the allegations against them. However, the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s ruling in [[Rasul v. Bush]] required the institution of a review. The Supreme Court recommended the reviews be modeled after the [[Army Regulation 190-8 Tribunal]]s that were ordinarily used to determine whether captives were innocent civilians who should be released, [[lawful combatant]]s entitled to [[Prisoner of War]] status, or [[war criminal]]s who could be tried, and who weren't protected by all the provisions of the [[Geneva Conventions]].\n\nThe [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] set up the [[Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants]] (OARDEC). OARDEC administered an initial [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]] for the 558 [[Guantanamo captive]]s who were still in the detention camp as of August 2004. Unlike the AR 190-8 Tribunals, the Combatant Status Review Tribunals were not authorized to determine whether captives were entitled to POW status, only whether they were \"[[enemy combatant]]s. OARDEC also administered annual [[Administrative Review Board]] hearings. The Boards were only authorized to make a recommendation as to whether captives might represent an ongoing threat, or might continue to hold intelligence value, and therefore should continue to be held in US custody.\n\nClose to 10,000 pages of documents from the Combatant Status Review Tribunals and Administrative Review Board hearings were released after contested [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests.\n\nDozens of captives faced allegations that they had been associated with the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin. Some of the documents just alleged that a captive was associated with Hezb-e-Islami, without explaining why this implied they were an \"enemy combatant\". Other documents did provide brief explanations as how an association with Hezb-e-Islami implied a captive was an \"enemy combatant\".

{"title_page": "List of landscape architects", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Dynamic list}}\n\nA '''[[landscape architect]]''' is someone who practices [[landscape architecture]]. Regulations of the profession vary by country and state. The terminology has evolved to include those once known as [[List of professional gardeners|landscape gardeners]], [[garden designer|landscape designers]], architects, [[Surveying|surveyor]]s, or [[civil engineer]]s. In particular, this includes people from the 19th century who'd practiced before the term \"landscape architect\" was coined. Landscape architecture was also differentiated as a profession in the United States earlier than other parts of the world, but this ambiguity has persisted to the present day. In much of Europe, for example, landscape architecture is not a distinct profession; but there are many significant historical and contemporary examples of [[:Category:Landscape design history|\"landscape architectural design\"]] projects.  Though their influence on landscape architecture may be great, this list precludes gardeners, botanists, writers, theoreticians, ecologists, artists, and others who did not practice [[landscape design]] at a site scale and were not trained as a historical 'landscape gardener' or contemporary 'landscape architect.'<!---both terms used to address examples/practitioners below of pre-1890s

Regulations of the profession vary by country and state. The terminology has evolved to include those once known as [[List of professional gardeners|landscape gardeners]], [[garden designer|landscape designers]], architects, [[Surveying|surveyor]]s, or [[civil engineer]]s. In particular, this includes people from the 19th century who'd practiced before the term \"landscape architect\" was coined. Landscape architecture was also differentiated as a profession in the United States earlier than other parts of the world, but this ambiguity has persisted to the present day. In much of Europe, for example, landscape architecture is not a distinct profession; but there are many significant historical and contemporary examples of [[:Category:Landscape design history|\"landscape architectural design\"]] projects.  Though their influence on landscape architecture may be great, this list precludes gardeners, botanists, writers, theoreticians, ecologists, artists, and others who did not practice [[landscape design]] at a site scale and were not trained as a historical 'landscape gardener' or contemporary 'landscape architect.'<!---both terms used to address examples/practitioners below of pre-1890s
