The series' pilot first premiered as part of Cartoon Network's \"Cartoon Cartoon Summer\" on August 18, 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/feature/ccsummer/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000815053637/http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/feature/ccsummer/index.html|archivedate=August 15, 2000|title=Cartoon Cartoon Summer|publisher=[[Cartoon Network]]|accessdate=2012-12-28}}</ref>\n\nCreated by [[Mo Willems]], who previously created ''[[The Off-Beats]]'' for [[Nickelodeon]]'s ''[[KaBlam!]]'', the bulk of the show follows a runaway [[sheep]], Sheep, in his new life in \"the Big City\", trying to avoid a secret military organization.<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=545}}</ref> It also features several unrelated sketches and shorts, similar to ''[[The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends]]'' and ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]''. With an emphasis on more \"sophisticated\" (in particular, literal) humor, using multiple forms of [[rhetoric]] from the characters to the plots, it was more popular with older audiences. It was also unusual in featuring many comic references to film-making and television broadcasting.\n\nAt the time, the premiere of ''Sheep in the Big City'' was the highest-rated premiere for a [[Cartoon Network original series]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BDW/is_11_42/ai_71766817 |title=Eliciting a Sheepish Grin - Cartoon Network's campaign for Sheep in the City - Brief Article {{!}} Brandweek {{!}} Find Articles at BNET<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-07-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815033819/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BDW/is_11_42/ai_71766817/ |archive-date=2009-08-15 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe animation services for the series were handled by [[Rough Draft Studios|Rough Draft Korea]]. This was Cartoon Network's first original series produced by the animation studio [[Curious Pictures]], who would later go on to produce ''[[Codename: Kids Next Door]]'' in 2002.\n\n==Production==\nSeries creator [[Mo Willems]] began his career doing stage comedy in the 1980s, but he had also wanted to be an artist. Willems would recall this in a 2001 interview, stating, \"My desire as a kid was to find a way to be funny and draw. Animation turned out to be the best way for me to do that.\"<ref name=talking>{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/animationworld/talking-his-sheep-conversation-mo-willems|title=Talking in His Sheep: A Conversation with Mo Willems|first=Martin|last=Goodman|date=June 25, 2001|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|accessdate=2019-10-17}}</ref> After graduating from [[New York University Tisch School of the Arts]], Willems began making short films for ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and writing for ''[[The Muppets]]''.<ref name=\"talking\" /> He would also work on [[Nickelodeon]]'s short-form animated series ''[[The Off-Beats]]'', which had a similar art style to ''Sheep in the Big City''.<ref name=\"talking\" /> Willems has stated that the work of [[Pablo Picasso]] has influenced his art style.<ref name=\"talking\" />\n\n''Sheep in the Big City'' was broadcast alongside a number of potential series pilots during [[Cartoon Network]]'s \"Cartoon Cartoon Summer\" marathon on August 18, 2000. The series was greenlit and would go on to broadcast for two seasons.\n\n==Plot==\nSheep lives happily on a farm with his friends. Unfortunately, a Secret Military Organization, led by General Specific, needs Sheep for its Sheep-Powered Ray Gun (with a sheep-shaped hole in it).\n\nGeneral Specific will get Sheep at any cost, and, knowing that the farm is at stake, Sheep is forced to leave for the big city. Now Sheep is on the run from General Specific, who is assisted by his henchmen, Private Public, the Angry Scientist (who in the show is often wrongly referred to as \"Mad Scientist\"), a bunch of other military types, and the Plot Device.\n\nIn addition, Sheep has to come to grips with the Big City and trying to romance his love, Swanky the Poodle. All the while, he has to avoid the attentions of a host of unwelcome characters&nbsp;\u2014 Lisa Rental and Swanky's owner, the sheep-hating Lady Richington, wielding a stainless-steel wig.\n\n==Style==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hold the phone.png|thumb|right|A common running gag used throughout the first season was that, whenever the phrase \"hold the phone\" was said, there would be a cut to this still. This did not appear in Season 2.<br />{{ffdc|1=Hold the phone.png|log=2017 August 2}}]] -->\nThe show usually begins with a completely unrelated clip, which turns out to be a show that Sheep is watching. Sheep presses a button on his remote to change the channel, which segues into the theme song.\n\nEach episode is divided into three chapters; each one's title, as the narrator once quipped, is \"some pun on the word 'sheep' or something\": in the episode \"To Sheep, Perchance to Dream\", one of the chapters was actually named \"Some Pun on the Word 'Sheep'\".\n\nFake advertisements are in between the chapters, and sometimes short skits, such as the Sombrero Brothers. The fake advertisements are usually of products from Oxymoron with Victor the spokesperson promoting it. Each product is usually of low quality (contrary to what one may think) or causes pain in some way.\n\nThe show's most unusual characteristic is its frequent breaking of the [[fourth wall]]. For instance, the vast majority of the characters make references to the show's structure, script, and, occasionally, its premise. For example, in the episode \"Agony of De-Bleat\", when General Specific finally captures Sheep, the Angry Scientist states that he didn't actually have the Ray Gun ready, thinking that they would never capture Sheep due to it \"being so contrary to the set-up of the show\". The Narrator is also a pivotal character, frequently interacting with the characters via voice-over (and sometimes directly, when other characters unexpectedly show up in his studio). He also criticizes the television medium itself (such as the fact that two-thirds of the final episode of the first season was actually composed of [[dream sequence]]s) and the script, occasionally ad-libbing when he does not quite understand the script. He also tells the viewer to \"just go with it\" when the script seems to make no sense.\n\nLiteral humor is also important to the show's style. Phrases and expressions such as \"Hold the phone!\" or \"[[wikt:wild-goose chase|wild goose chase]]\" are usually followed by literal interpretations of the phrase mentioned. A running gag in the show, for example, is that whenever a character exclaims \"Great Scott!\" a [[Scotland|Scotsman]] appears out of nowhere, saying, \"Yes?\".\n\nWhenever the phrase \"Hold the phone!\" is said, it would cut to a still of Lisa Rental holding a phone. The first time the still is shown, it is in the episode \"Baa-ck in time\".\n\n==Characters==\n* Sheep (voiced by [[Kevin Seal]]) is an [[anthropomorphic]] [[sheep]], who is the main protagonist of the series. He is owned by Farmer John, who named him sheep due to the fact that he was a plucky little sheep. Sheep has a hard time with life\u2014between getting chased by the military and trying to see Swanky the Poodle, the poodle that Sheep loves, without getting bonked on the head by Lady Richington with her stainless steel wig. Yet, he still makes time to act in dish-washing commercials, travel through time, get a job at a hip club, and also makes a living jumping over fences for insomniacs. Sheep bleats but does not speak in any intelligible human language. As he is a normal sheep, aside from possibly higher intelligence, he has trouble resisting his animal urges, such as eating grass, even when he is being chased by General Specific.\n* General Specific (voiced by Kevin Seal) is the main antagonist of the series. The dim-witted leader of the Secret Military Organization, Specific does his best to capture Sheep for his Sheep-Powered Ray Gun. He is never discouraged by his constant losses. Specific always speaks through his clenched teeth. He mentions in one episode that he has a steel plate in his head. In one episode, he also developed the habit of throwing his subordinates into \"The Pit\" (a door, appearing out of nowhere under the characters' feet) (he once did it to the subordinate who asked him why he does not simply catch some random sheep and make the Sheep-Powered Ray Gun compatible to it), but later, finds out that this is a problem, when neither he nor Private Public can maneuver the helicopter properly, because Specific dropped the helicopter pilot into the Pit. General Specific's name is an [[oxymoron]]. On his uniform, he has 3 medals that look like exclamation marks, and one that looks like a question mark.\n* Farmer John (voiced by James Edmund Godwin) is Sheep's original owner, also seeking to recapture him\u2014although in a more mild-mannered way than General Specific. In one episode, it is revealed that \"Far\" and \"Mer\" are actually Farmer John's first and middle name, not his job description. According to Dirk and Sondra's reenacting of Farmer John's parents naming him, he was named \"Far\" after his father's desire to know how \"far\" he goes in life and \"Mer\" after a relative of Farmer John's father. Sondra also jokingly suggested (albeit it's unclear if she said it on her own or if she was still acting as Farmer John's mother) that Farmer John could be named [[Elton John|'Elton']]. Both Dirk and Sondra laughed at the suggestion. Farmer John's personality is best described that, in order not to kill any of his farm animals, he prepares water soup for the re-union. He is constantly using pseudo-psychological talk, which is, in fact, extremely boring and instead of \"helping\", it forces the characters not to pay attention to him. Another example of his annoyance is his \"thanks\" speech at the re-union, where he thanks for everything, including \"air\" and \"silly shoes\". He sometimes calls Sheep \"Sheepie\".\n* Ben Plotz (voiced by Ken Schatz) is the show's [[narrator]]. He often complains about the quality of the writing on the show, but overall, he has an appreciation for the cast. He, on one occasion, embellishes the storyline when he dislikes the ending. Other times, he is forced to make changes to the show by Irv to preserve the show's budget.\n* Private Public (voiced by James Edmund Godwin) is General Specific's right-hand man. He is always right behind General Specific, and despite being much smarter, he would prefer to receive orders than give them. His name is also oxymoronic.\n* The Angry Scientist (voiced by Mo Willems) often gets his hump busted for being an Angry Scientist rather than Mad, but he is the brains behind the organization, despite his extremely limited grasp of the English language (referring to it with the phrase \"Why are you not my Englishness be understanding? All the timing with that\"). His inventions include the Sheep-Powered Ray Gun, the Clome, and a Time-Travel Bicycle (although Private Public flatly points out that if he can invent a time machine why cannot he invent a ray gun that works without a sheep). He often goes into fits of rage at General Specific when he calls him a '[[mad scientist|Mad Scientist]]' (\"ANGURY!! I am an ANGURY Scientist!!\"), and on one occasion, he is called the 'Angry Chemist'. At the end of Season 1, he considers calling himself \"The Scientist with Some Issues\", now getting angry whenever he gets referred as \"The Angry Scientist\". He's mistakenly called 'Mad Scientist' so often that, in one occasion, he complained about it out of habit when he was called 'Angry Scientist'. He once opened an [[anger management]] center where he taught people to become angrier. General Specific used to be one of his clients until he said the center made him madder, making the Angry Scientist expel him, claiming it was an 'Anger Management Center' and not a 'Madness Management Center'. General Specific was so angry for being expelled The Angry Scientist considered him another satisfied customer.\n* The Plot Device (voiced by [[Stephanie D'Abruzzo]]) is a machine that comes up with plans for General Specific, such as disguising sleep potion as water soup to sneak into Farmer John's house. Her name is a pun as her main role in the stories is as a [[plot device]].\n* General Lee Outrageous (voiced by Joey Mazzarino) is General Specific's cousin, who is a stereotypical 1970s disco partier. He is nearly identical to Specific, but has sunglasses, shiny clothing, blue hair shaped into a [[ponytail]], a [[gold tooth]] and three stars on his hat, as opposed to Specific's one star. Lee is also Specific's rival, and uses a [[goat]]-powered ray-gun. He has a sidekick called Private Party, who is similar to Private Public and could be ''his'' cousin. His name is a pun on \"generally outrageous\".\n* Lady Virginia Richington (voiced by [[Ruth Buzzi]] in the pilot and [[Stephanie D'Abruzzo]] in the series) is the owner of Swanky. Lady Richington, of the Filthy Richingtons, is quite rich. She owns the majority of the city and is never seen without her gaudy jewellery and lavish clothing. While she may not look very intimidating, she has a severe hatred of sheep in general, and will not hesitate to pummel them into fluffy pulps with her [[stainless steel]] [[Wig (hair)|wig]].\n* Lisa Rental (voiced by [[Stephanie D'Abruzzo]]) is an annoying, evil little girl, who thinks that Sheep is a \"cutesy wootsey dog\" and wants him desperately. Lisa also loves to refer to Sheep as \"Doggy Woggy Smoggy Foggy Loggy Toggy Doggy\". Her name is a pun on the words \"[[lease]] a [[rental]]\". When she and General Specific first met, she convinced him that Sheep was a dog by having Sheep obey her commands (not knowing her true colors back then, Sheep played along) and telling him Sheep was a [[herding dog|sheep dog]].\n* X Agent is a black-woollen sheep whom General Specific hired in order to capture Sheep. X Agent becomes best friends with Sheep and, after feeling remorse for betraying Sheep, betrays Specific and becomes a [[Batman]]-like [[superhero]]. In another episode, he becomes an overprotective guardian of Sheep. He leaves after Completely Powerful Guy reads a telegram from \"The Writer\", informing X Agent that he has been assigned to [[Toledo, Ohio]], and that the request is not \"just a convenient way of getting you out of this show\". Like Sheep, X Agent bleats and does not speak in intelligible human language.\n* Oxymoron is an ox who debuted in numerous \"Phony Bologna\" advertisements for the Oxymoron company. He also makes cameos in some episodes. His name is a parody of [[oxymoron]], a phrase in which an adjective that means the opposite of the noun that it describes is used (e.g. a smart idiot, a planned coincidence, Hopeless Optimistic, etc.).\n* Victor (voiced by Ken Schatz) is an obnoxious salesman and spokesperson who usually hosts the Oxymoron commercials. The other people in the commercials do not usually expect him to show up and often demand to know who he is when he does, but he never tells them. Victor does not (or wishes not to) see the harmfulness and uselessness of his products.\n* Jay (voiced by Ken Schatz) is a man who, whenever Sheep or any other main character sees a sign, is first heard reading it aloud, and when the character turns to him, he raises his glasses and says something along the lines of \"I like to read\" or \"Reading is funducational\".\n* Swanky the Poodle (voiced by Stephanie D'Abruzzo) is a [[poodle]] and Sheep's love interest, who, luckily, gives Sheep some attention. Swanky is owned by Lady Richington.\n* Great Scott (voiced by Ken Schatz) is a Scotsman, appearing and saying \"EEE-Yeeeeeeeeesssss?\" (just like the late [[Frank Nelson (actor)|Frank Nelson]]) after someone says the exclamation \"Great Scott!\" He was once accompanied by Holly Molly.\n* News Announcers: The duo of news announcers, one a neurotic, angry man called Hank (voiced by Ken Schatz) and the other a ditsy blond female called Betsy (voiced by Stephanie D'Abruzzo), who proclaim everything oh-so unrelated as a \"related story\".\n* Irv, the Studio Accountant (voiced by Joey Mazzarino) forces, in order to lower show expenses, the narrator to make the sounds himself and re-directs Sheep into escaping in the time machine because \"so much time and money was put\" into its building and re-construction.\n* The Sombrero Brothers are two untalented performers in Mexican attire whose act, \"Flying Sombrero Brothers\", is flying on a plane. Their names are Hector (voiced by [[Mo Willems]]) and Bill (voiced by Ken Schatz).\n* The Ranting Swede (voiced by Kevin Seal) is a Swedish man who rants about pianos, supermarkets, and a variety of other topics. His rants appear at the end of every single episode, except episode 18, where he was replaced by The Ranting Norwegian, due to schedule conflict and the final one, which is done in reverse order.\n* The Ranting Norwegian (voiced by Kevin Seal) is a Norwegian man who does not know much about ranting but instead talks about a car he recently got, and appreciates things rather than ranting about them. Unlike the Ranting Swede, he speaks much more softly and nicely, and also explains how the people in Norway do not have too much to rant about.\n* General Public (voiced by Jerry Nelson) is Private Public's father.\n\n==Episodes==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |Season\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Episodes\n! colspan=\"2\" |Originally aired\n|-\n!

The series' pilot first premiered as part of Cartoon Network's \"Cartoon Cartoon Summer\" on August 18, 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/feature/ccsummer/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000815053637/http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/feature/ccsummer/index.html|archivedate=August 15, 2000|title=Cartoon Cartoon Summer|publisher=[[Cartoon Network]]|accessdate=2012-12-28}}</ref>\n\nCreated by [[Mo Willems]], who previously created ''[[The Off-Beats]]'' for [[Nickelodeon]]'s ''[[KaBlam!]]'', the bulk of the show follows a runaway [[sheep]], Sheep, in his new life in \"the Big City\", trying to avoid a secret military organization.<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=545}}</ref> It also features several unrelated sketches and shorts, similar to ''[[The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends]]'' and ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]''. With an emphasis on more \"sophisticated\" (in particular, literal) humor, using multiple forms of [[rhetoric]] from the characters to the plots, it was more popular with older audiences. It was also unusual in featuring many comic references to film-making and television broadcasting.\n\nAt the time, the premiere of ''Sheep in the Big City'' was the highest-rated premiere for a [[Cartoon Network original series]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BDW/is_11_42/ai_71766817 |title=Eliciting a Sheepish Grin - Cartoon Network's campaign for Sheep in the City - Brief Article {{!}} Brandweek {{!}} Find Articles at BNET<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-07-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815033819/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BDW/is_11_42/ai_71766817/ |archive-date=2009-08-15 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe animation services for the series were handled by [[Rough Draft Studios|Rough Draft Korea]]. This was Cartoon Network's first original series produced by the animation studio [[Curious Pictures]], who would later go on to produce ''[[Codename: Kids Next Door]]'' in 2002.\n\n==Production==\nSeries creator [[Mo Willems]] began his career doing stage comedy in the 1980s, but he had also wanted to be an artist. Willems would recall this in a 2001 interview, stating, \"My desire as a kid was to find a way to be funny and draw. Animation turned out to be the best way for me to do that.\"<ref name=talking>{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/animationworld/talking-his-sheep-conversation-mo-willems|title=Talking in His Sheep: A Conversation with Mo Willems|first=Martin|last=Goodman|date=June 25, 2001|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|accessdate=2019-10-17}}</ref> After graduating from [[New York University Tisch School of the Arts]], Willems began making short films for ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and writing for ''[[The Muppets]]''.<ref name=\"talking\" /> He would also work on [[Nickelodeon]]'s short-form animated series ''[[The Off-Beats]]'', which had a similar art style to ''Sheep in the Big City''.<ref name=\"talking\" /> Willems has stated that the work of [[Pablo Picasso]] has influenced his art style.<ref name=\"talking\" />\n\n''Sheep in the Big City'' was broadcast alongside a number of potential series pilots during [[Cartoon Network]]'s \"Cartoon Cartoon Summer\" marathon on August 18, 2000. The series was greenlit and would go on to broadcast for two seasons.\n\n==Plot==\nSheep lives happily on a farm with his friends. Unfortunately, a Secret Military Organization, led by General Specific, needs Sheep for its Sheep-Powered Ray Gun (with a sheep-shaped hole in it).\n\nGeneral Specific will get Sheep at any cost, and, knowing that the farm is at stake, Sheep is forced to leave for the big city. Now Sheep is on the run from General Specific, who is assisted by his henchmen, Private Public, the Angry Scientist (who in the show is often wrongly referred to as \"Mad Scientist\"), a bunch of other military types, and the Plot Device.\n\nIn addition, Sheep has to come to grips with the Big City and trying to romance his love, Swanky the Poodle. All the while, he has to avoid the attentions of a host of unwelcome characters&nbsp;\u2014 Lisa Rental and Swanky's owner, the sheep-hating Lady Richington, wielding a stainless-steel wig.\n\n==Style==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hold the phone.png|thumb|right|A common running gag used throughout the first season was that, whenever the phrase \"hold the phone\" was said, there would be a cut to this still. This did not appear in Season 2.<br />{{ffdc|1=Hold the phone.png|log=2017 August 2}}]] -->\nThe show usually begins with a completely unrelated clip, which turns out to be a show that Sheep is watching. Sheep presses a button on his remote to change the channel, which segues into the theme song.\n\nEach episode is divided into three chapters; each one's title, as the narrator once quipped, is \"some pun on the word 'sheep' or something\": in the episode \"To Sheep, Perchance to Dream\", one of the chapters was actually named \"Some Pun on the Word 'Sheep'\".\n\nFake advertisements are in between the chapters, and sometimes short skits, such as the Sombrero Brothers. The fake advertisements are usually of products from Oxymoron with Victor the spokesperson promoting it. Each product is usually of low quality (contrary to what one may think) or causes pain in some way.\n\nThe show's most unusual characteristic is its frequent breaking of the [[fourth wall]]. For instance, the vast majority of the characters make references to the show's structure, script, and, occasionally, its premise. For example, in the episode \"Agony of De-Bleat\", when General Specific finally captures Sheep, the Angry Scientist states that he didn't actually have the Ray Gun ready, thinking that they would never capture Sheep due to it \"being so contrary to the set-up of the show\". The Narrator is also a pivotal character, frequently interacting with the characters via voice-over (and sometimes directly, when other characters unexpectedly show up in his studio). He also criticizes the television medium itself (such as the fact that two-thirds of the final episode of the first season was actually composed of [[dream sequence]]s) and the script, occasionally ad-libbing when he does not quite understand the script. He also tells the viewer to \"just go with it\" when the script seems to make no sense.\n\nLiteral humor is also important to the show's style. Phrases and expressions such as \"Hold the phone!\" or \"[[wikt:wild-goose chase|wild goose chase]]\" are usually followed by literal interpretations of the phrase mentioned. A running gag in the show, for example, is that whenever a character exclaims \"Great Scott!\" a [[Scotland|Scotsman]] appears out of nowhere, saying, \"Yes?\".\n\nWhenever the phrase \"Hold the phone!\" is said, it would cut to a still of Lisa Rental holding a phone. The first time the still is shown, it is in the episode \"Baa-ck in time\".\n\n==Characters==\n* Sheep (voiced by [[Kevin Seal]]) is an [[anthropomorphic]] [[sheep]], who is the main protagonist of the series. He is owned by Farmer John, who named him sheep due to the fact that he was a plucky little sheep. Sheep has a hard time with life\u2014between getting chased by the military and trying to see Swanky the Poodle, the poodle that Sheep loves, without getting bonked on the head by Lady Richington with her stainless steel wig. Yet, he still makes time to act in dish-washing commercials, travel through time, get a job at a hip club, and also makes a living jumping over fences for insomniacs. Sheep bleats but does not speak in any intelligible human language. As he is a normal sheep, aside from possibly higher intelligence, he has trouble resisting his animal urges, such as eating grass, even when he is being chased by General Specific.\n* General Specific (voiced by Kevin Seal) is the main antagonist of the series. The dim-witted leader of the Secret Military Organization, Specific does his best to capture Sheep for his Sheep-Powered Ray Gun. He is never discouraged by his constant losses. Specific always speaks through his clenched teeth. He mentions in one episode that he has a steel plate in his head. In one episode, he also developed the habit of throwing his subordinates into \"The Pit\" (a door, appearing out of nowhere under the characters' feet) (he once did it to the subordinate who asked him why he does not simply catch some random sheep and make the Sheep-Powered Ray Gun compatible to it), but later, finds out that this is a problem, when neither he nor Private Public can maneuver the helicopter properly, because Specific dropped the helicopter pilot into the Pit. General Specific's name is an [[oxymoron]]. On his uniform, he has 3 medals that look like exclamation marks, and one that looks like a question mark.\n* Farmer John (voiced by James Edmund Godwin) is Sheep's original owner, also seeking to recapture him\u2014although in a more mild-mannered way than General Specific. In one episode, it is revealed that \"Far\" and \"Mer\" are actually Farmer John's first and middle name, not his job description. According to Dirk and Sondra's reenacting of Farmer John's parents naming him, he was named \"Far\" after his father's desire to know how \"far\" he goes in life and \"Mer\" after a relative of Farmer John's father. Sondra also jokingly suggested (albeit it's unclear if she said it on her own or if she was still acting as Farmer John's mother) that Farmer John could be named [[Elton John|'Elton']]. Both Dirk and Sondra laughed at the suggestion. Farmer John's personality is best described that, in order not to kill any of his farm animals, he prepares water soup for the re-union. He is constantly using pseudo-psychological talk, which is, in fact, extremely boring and instead of \"helping\", it forces the characters not to pay attention to him. Another example of his annoyance is his \"thanks\" speech at the re-union, where he thanks for everything, including \"air\" and \"silly shoes\". He sometimes calls Sheep \"Sheepie\".\n* Ben Plotz (voiced by Ken Schatz) is the show's [[narrator]]. He often complains about the quality of the writing on the show, but overall, he has an appreciation for the cast. He, on one occasion, embellishes the storyline when he dislikes the ending. Other times, he is forced to make changes to the show by Irv to preserve the show's budget.\n* Private Public (voiced by James Edmund Godwin) is General Specific's right-hand man. He is always right behind General Specific, and despite being much smarter, he would prefer to receive orders than give them. His name is also oxymoronic.\n* The Angry Scientist (voiced by Mo Willems) often gets his hump busted for being an Angry Scientist rather than Mad, but he is the brains behind the organization, despite his extremely limited grasp of the English language (referring to it with the phrase \"Why are you not my Englishness be understanding? All the timing with that\"). His inventions include the Sheep-Powered Ray Gun, the Clome, and a Time-Travel Bicycle (although Private Public flatly points out that if he can invent a time machine why cannot he invent a ray gun that works without a sheep). He often goes into fits of rage at General Specific when he calls him a '[[mad scientist|Mad Scientist]]' (\"ANGURY!! I am an ANGURY Scientist!!\"), and on one occasion, he is called the 'Angry Chemist'. At the end of Season 1, he considers calling himself \"The Scientist with Some Issues\", now getting angry whenever he gets referred as \"The Angry Scientist\". He's mistakenly called 'Mad Scientist' so often that, in one occasion, he complained about it out of habit when he was called 'Angry Scientist'. He once opened an [[anger management]] center where he taught people to become angrier. General Specific used to be one of his clients until he said the center made him madder, making the Angry Scientist expel him, claiming it was an 'Anger Management Center' and not a 'Madness Management Center'. General Specific was so angry for being expelled The Angry Scientist considered him another satisfied customer.\n* The Plot Device (voiced by [[Stephanie D'Abruzzo]]) is a machine that comes up with plans for General Specific, such as disguising sleep potion as water soup to sneak into Farmer John's house. Her name is a pun as her main role in the stories is as a [[plot device]].\n* General Lee Outrageous (voiced by Joey Mazzarino) is General Specific's cousin, who is a stereotypical 1970s disco partier. He is nearly identical to Specific, but has sunglasses, shiny clothing, blue hair shaped into a [[ponytail]], a [[gold tooth]] and three stars on his hat, as opposed to Specific's one star. Lee is also Specific's rival, and uses a [[goat]]-powered ray-gun. He has a sidekick called Private Party, who is similar to Private Public and could be ''his'' cousin. His name is a pun on \"generally outrageous\".\n* Lady Virginia Richington (voiced by [[Ruth Buzzi]] in the pilot and [[Stephanie D'Abruzzo]] in the series) is the owner of Swanky. Lady Richington, of the Filthy Richingtons, is quite rich. She owns the majority of the city and is never seen without her gaudy jewellery and lavish clothing. While she may not look very intimidating, she has a severe hatred of sheep in general, and will not hesitate to pummel them into fluffy pulps with her [[stainless steel]] [[Wig (hair)|wig]].\n* Lisa Rental (voiced by [[Stephanie D'Abruzzo]]) is an annoying, evil little girl, who thinks that Sheep is a \"cutesy wootsey dog\" and wants him desperately. Lisa also loves to refer to Sheep as \"Doggy Woggy Smoggy Foggy Loggy Toggy Doggy\". Her name is a pun on the words \"[[lease]] a [[rental]]\". When she and General Specific first met, she convinced him that Sheep was a dog by having Sheep obey her commands (not knowing her true colors back then, Sheep played along) and telling him Sheep was a [[herding dog|sheep dog]].\n* X Agent is a black-woollen sheep whom General Specific hired in order to capture Sheep. X Agent becomes best friends with Sheep and, after feeling remorse for betraying Sheep, betrays Specific and becomes a [[Batman]]-like [[superhero]]. In another episode, he becomes an overprotective guardian of Sheep. He leaves after Completely Powerful Guy reads a telegram from \"The Writer\", informing X Agent that he has been assigned to [[Toledo, Ohio]], and that the request is not \"just a convenient way of getting you out of this show\". Like Sheep, X Agent bleats and does not speak in intelligible human language.\n* Oxymoron is an ox who debuted in numerous \"Phony Bologna\" advertisements for the Oxymoron company. He also makes cameos in some episodes. His name is a parody of [[oxymoron]], a phrase in which an adjective that means the opposite of the noun that it describes is used (e.g. a smart idiot, a planned coincidence, Hopeless Optimistic, etc.).\n* Victor (voiced by Ken Schatz) is an obnoxious salesman and spokesperson who usually hosts the Oxymoron commercials. The other people in the commercials do not usually expect him to show up and often demand to know who he is when he does, but he never tells them. Victor does not (or wishes not to) see the harmfulness and uselessness of his products.\n* Jay (voiced by Ken Schatz) is a man who, whenever Sheep or any other main character sees a sign, is first heard reading it aloud, and when the character turns to him, he raises his glasses and says something along the lines of \"I like to read\" or \"Reading is funducational\".\n* Swanky the Poodle (voiced by Stephanie D'Abruzzo) is a [[poodle]] and Sheep's love interest, who, luckily, gives Sheep some attention. Swanky is owned by Lady Richington.\n* Great Scott (voiced by Ken Schatz) is a Scotsman, appearing and saying \"EEE-Yeeeeeeeeesssss?\" (just like the late [[Frank Nelson (actor)|Frank Nelson]]) after someone says the exclamation \"Great Scott!\" He was once accompanied by Holly Molly.\n* News Announcers: The duo of news announcers, one a neurotic, angry man called Hank (voiced by Ken Schatz) and the other a ditsy blond female called Betsy (voiced by Stephanie D'Abruzzo), who proclaim everything oh-so unrelated as a \"related story\".\n* Irv, the Studio Accountant (voiced by Joey Mazzarino) forces, in order to lower show expenses, the narrator to make the sounds himself and re-directs Sheep into escaping in the time machine because \"so much time and money was put\" into its building and re-construction.\n* The Sombrero Brothers are two untalented performers in Mexican attire whose act, \"Flying Sombrero Brothers\", is flying on a plane. Their names are Hector (voiced by [[Mo Willems]]) and Bill (voiced by Ken Schatz).\n* The Ranting Swede (voiced by Kevin Seal) is a Swedish man who rants about pianos, supermarkets, and a variety of other topics. His rants appear at the end of every single episode, except episode 18, where he was replaced by The Ranting Norwegian, due to schedule conflict and the final one, which is done in reverse order.\n* The Ranting Norwegian (voiced by Kevin Seal) is a Norwegian man who does not know much about ranting but instead talks about a car he recently got, and appreciates things rather than ranting about them.

Rosewood F.C. of Byker merged with Newcastle East End a short time later. In 1886, Newcastle East End moved from Byker to Heaton.

The origins of Newcastle United Football Club itself can be traced back to the formation of a football club by the Stanley Cricket Club of [[Byker]] in November 1881. This team was renamed [[Newcastle East End F.C.]] in October 1882, to avoid confusion with the cricket club in [[Stanley, County Durham]]. Rosewood F.C. of Byker merged with Newcastle East End a short time later. In 1886, Newcastle East End moved from Byker to Heaton.

Its lease was then bought by [[Newcastle East End F.C.]] in 1892, before they changed their name to Newcastle United. At the turn of the 19th century, the ground's capacity was given as 30,000 before being redeveloped between 1900 and 1905, increasing the capacity to 60,000 and making it the biggest stadium in England for a time. For most of the 20th century, the stadium changed very little, despite various plans for development of the ground. The old West Stand was replaced with the Milburn Stand in 1987, the Sir John Hall Stand replacing the Leazes End in 1993, and the rest of the ground renovated making the ground a 37,000 capacity [[all-seater stadium]]. Between 1998 and 2000, double tiers were added to the Milburn and John Hall stands to bring the venue up to its current capacity of 52,354. There were plans to build a new 90,000 seater stadium in Leazes park, just behind St James' with Newcastle Falcons taking over St James' Park, but due to protests the plans were dropped. St James' Park currently seats 52,354 people, but club owner [[Mike Ashley (businessman)|Mike Ashley]] would consider taking the roof off The Gallowgate end and adding another 6,000 seats making the total capacity to 58,420, but only if the team manage to finish in the top six places of the Premier League.<ref name=formation /><ref name=st_james>{{cite web|title=The Sports Direct Arena Story |work=nufc.co.uk |url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/SportsDirectArena |accessdate=13 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113184643/http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/SportsDirectArena |archivedate=13 November 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, Mike Ashley announced that he planned to lease the name of the ground in a bid to increase revenue, and in November the stadium was temporarily renamed sportsdirect.com @ St James' Park Stadium.<ref name=off_market /><ref name=direct>{{cite news\n| url        = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/8342406.stm\n| title      = Newcastle reveal new stadium name\n|work=BBC Sport\n| date       = 4 November 2009\n| accessdate =4 November 2009\n| location   = London\n}}</ref> This name was only supposed to be used until the end of the [[2009\u201310 Newcastle United F.C. season|2009\u201310 season]], but lasted until November 2011.<ref name=direct /><ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Newcastle-owner-Mike-Ashley-has-spent-a-staggering-285-8million-on-the-club-so-far-it-can-be-revealed-today-article718115.html\n| title       = Newcastle 'have cost Ashley \u00a3285.8m so far'\n| first       = Simon\n| last        = Bird\n| date        = 29 March 2011\n| work=Daily Mirror |location=UK\n| accessdate  =13 April 2011\n}}</ref> On 10 November 2011, the club officially changed the name of the stadium to the Sports Direct Arena, although this was an interim name to showcase the sponsorship capabilities of the stadium.
