There Prince Henry was knighted with a spur held by the [[Earl of Mar]] and crowned as a duke by his father. He was given the titles [[Prince of Scotland|Great Steward of Scotland]], [[Duke of Rothesay]], [[Earl of Carrick]], [[Lord of the Isles]], and [[Baron of Renfrew (title)|Baron of Renfrew]].\n[[File:CMSJ IMG 0428 (640x480) (3870360864).jpg|thumb|right|The name of the prince, \"Henry Frederick\" was announced from a window of the '''Great Hall''']]\nAfter this several Scottish men were made knights in the queen's outer hall. The names of the newly-made knights were proclaimed from the terrace at the forefront of the palace with sound of trumpets, and gold and other coins were cast amongst the people in the garden below as largesse.<ref>Thomas Rymer, ''Foedera'', vol. 16 (London, 1715), p. 263: ''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 412: William Fowler, ''A True Reportarie'' (Edinburgh, 1594).</ref> Next, Anne of Denmark received the gifts that the ambassadors had brought. The ambassadors were then escorted back to their lodgings until supper time.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 412.</ref>\n\n===Feast and masque===\n[[File:Interior Great Hall.JPG|thumb|right|Neptune's ship was presented in a masque in the Great Hall of Stirling Castle]]\nAt the supper or feast that evening at 8 o'clock, the first course was served by the new-made knights.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 412: Thomas Thomson, ''History of the Kirk of Scotland by Mr David Calderwood'', vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), p. 345.</ref> For the second course, a table laden with desserts of [[p\u00e2tisserie]], fruit, and sugar confectionaries was drawn up the length of the Great Hall with six maidens, presumably ladies-in-waiting to Anne of Denmark, either sitting on the table or standing beside it, in masque costumes with garlands on their heads, and feathers, pearls, and jewels in their hair, representing fecundity and fertility. William Fowler called this a \"silent comedy\" and explained that it had been intended a real lion should haul this tableau, but on consideration this might be too frightening for the guests, or the lion might be startled with unfortunate results. Instead an African man, who Fowler called \"the Moore\", gave the appearance of dragging the scene along with golden chains, although in reality it was moved by \"secret convoy\", hidden ropes and mechanism.<ref>William Fowler, ''A True Reportarie'' (Edinburgh, 1594).</ref> The role may have represented [[Gawain]], as he appears in the ''[[Knight of the Cart]]'' substituted for \"[[Ywain]]\" in ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]''. The exact reference intended is unclear in the evidence.\n\nThe African actor may have performed in 1590 at [[Entry and Coronation of Anne of Denmark|Anne of Denmark's Entry into Edinburgh]]. The queen also had an African servant in her household listed as \"the Moir\" in 1590, who was bought clothes with her pages, but there is no further record of this man.<ref>[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14629712.2019.1626110 Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', ''The Court Historian'', 24:2 (2019) p. 144.]</ref>\n\nAfter this tableau was removed, a large model ship was brought into the Great Hall, or uncovered there. This was to evoke to the King's journey to Norway and Denmark in 1589 to meet Anne of Denmark, in the manner of [[Jason|Jason and the Argonauts]], as if [[Neptune]], the pilot of the ship, had made their marriage, despite the \"conspiracies of witches\". The fore-sail was painted with a compass and the North Star, the main sail with the arms of Scotland and Denmark. Thetis and Triton were also onboard, with six sailors wearing shot-silk, and fourteen musicians dressed in Stewart red and yellow. The ship was accompanied by three women dressed as mermaids or [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]], as [[Parthenope (Siren)|Parthenope]], Ligeia, and Leucosia, who sang and mimed in time to the music. There were thirty six working brass cannons.<ref>William Fowler, ''A True Reportarie'' (Edinburgh, 1594).</ref>\n\nThe ship was laden with all kinds of fish made from sugar, including herring, whiting, flounders, oysters, whelks, crabs and clams, served in Venetian glasses tinted with azure, which were distributed while [[Arion]] seated on a dolphin played his harp. Some Latin verses in praise of Anne were sung, followed by [[Psalm 128]] in canon with musical accompaniment.<ref>Thomas Thomson, ''History of the Kirk of Scotland by Mr David Calderwood'', vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), p. 345, \"there was sung the 128th Psalm with diverse voices and tunes, and musical instruments playing\".</ref> Triton blew his trumpet and Neptune whistled, and then the ship sailed away, firing the rest of its guns. The ship model was kept at Stirling Castle for many years. Fowler's book gives the dimensions:<blockquote>\"Presently after the returning of the Chariot, entered a most sumpteous, artificiall, and well proportioned ship, the length of her keele, was 18. foot, and her bredth 8. foote: from her bottome to her highest flagge, was 40. foot: the Sea shee stoode vpon, was 24. foot long, with bredth convenient: her motion was so artificially devised within her self, that none could perceive what brought her in.\"<ref>William Fowler, ''A True Reportarie'' (Edinburgh, 1594).</ref></blockquote>\n\nJames and Anne and the ambassadors went into a room in the Palace, hung with recently repaired tapestry, where there was another sugar banquet. Sugar confections and sculptures were made for the court by Jacques de Boussy, a French or Flemish specialist.<ref>Michael Pearce, 'Riddle's Court, Banquet & Diplomacy in 1598', ''History Scotland'' 12:4 (2012), pp. 20-7: [[Marguerite Wood]], ''Extracts from the Records of the Burgh of Edinburgh, 1589-1603'' (Edinburgh, 1927), p. 362.</ref> Meanwhile, the Great Hall was cleared for revels, which Fowler did not describe further. The event ended at 3 o'clock in the morning. Over the next few days James gave gifts to the ambassadors.\n\nIn 1610 the masque ''[[Tethys' Festival]]'' at the investiture of Prince Henry as [[Prince of Wales]] also had a maritime theme, Anne of Denmark played a sea goddess [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] in [[Milford Haven]] harbour, while her ladies-in-waiting personified rivers. The banquet at the King James's baptism in December 1566 at Stirling Castle had also involved food on moving stages, with dancing choreographed by [[Bastian Pagez]].\n\n==Ambassadors and diplomatic gift-giving==\n[[File:Anne of Denmark, ca 1600.jpg|thumb|right|'''Anne of Denmark''' accepted gifts from the ambassadors in a ceremony held in her audience chamber in the palace.]]\n[[Robert Radclyffe, 5th Earl of Sussex]] was the ambassador from England.

The ambassador's masque would have comprised; six dancers wearing swords or [[falchion]]s with helmets dressed with feather plumes, presumably representing classical warriors; six masked torch bearers with hats with feathers, their costumes party-coloured in the Stewart colours red and yellow; four speaking parts wearing wigs and flower chaplets.

He said two of the Scottish envoys sent with invitations were unsuitable. Sir [[William Keith of Delny]] could not speak French, Latin, or Flemish, and the [[James Colville, 1st Lord Colville of Culross|laird of Easter Wemyss]] was chosen only because he happened to be travelling to London and Paris on his own business. Melville states that [[Peter Young (tutor)|Peter Young]] went to Denmark, Brunswick, and Mecklenberg, and was rewarded with gifts of three gold chains, but the dukes felt they would have been better honoured by a separate ambassador to each of them. Easter Wemyss received no rewards, because he was a messenger and did not have the status of an ambassador.

The Chapel Royal was purpose-built in 1594 under the direction of William Schaw, who was [[Master of Work to the Crown of Scotland|Master of Work]] to the king and the queen, and an administrator of the queen's landed income. The building has an central triumphal arch as an entrance, flanked by Italianate windows, and can be described as the first Renaissance style church in Britain.<ref>Ian Campbell and Aonghus MacKechnie, 'The 'Great Temple of Solomon' at Stirling Castle', ''Architectural History'', vol. 54 (2011), pp. 91, 103.</ref> The north fa\u00e7ade is featureless.

Modern historians continue to debate these themes, and also with a focus on the role of Anne, or Anna of Denmark as an agent in these events, or debate the role of the African actor, and the costumed performances.

William Fowler called this a \"silent comedy\" and explained that it had been intended a real lion should haul this tableau, but on consideration this might be too frightening for the guests, or the lion might be startled with unfortunate results. Instead an African man, who Fowler called \"the Moore\", gave the appearance of dragging the scene along with golden chains, although in reality it was moved by \"secret convoy\", hidden ropes and mechanism.<ref>William Fowler, ''A True Reportarie'' (Edinburgh, 1594).</ref> The role may have represented [[Gawain]], as he appears in the ''[[Knight of the Cart]]'' substituted for \"[[Ywain]]\" in ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]''. The exact reference intended is unclear in the evidence.\n\nThe African actor may have performed in 1590 at [[Entry and Coronation of Anne of Denmark|Anne of Denmark's Entry into Edinburgh]]. The queen also had an African servant in her household listed as \"the Moir\" in 1590, who was bought clothes with her pages, but there is no further record of this man.<ref>[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14629712.2019.1626110 Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', ''The Court Historian'', 24:2 (2019) p. 144.]</ref>\n\nAfter this tableau was removed, a large model ship was brought into the Great Hall, or uncovered there. This was to evoke to the King's journey to Norway and Denmark in 1589 to meet Anne of Denmark, in the manner of [[Jason|Jason and the Argonauts]], as if [[Neptune]], the pilot of the ship, had made their marriage, despite the \"conspiracies of witches\". The fore-sail was painted with a compass and the North Star, the main sail with the arms of Scotland and Denmark. Thetis and Triton were also onboard, with six sailors wearing shot-silk, and fourteen musicians dressed in Stewart red and yellow. The ship was accompanied by three women dressed as mermaids or [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]], as [[Parthenope (Siren)|Parthenope]], Ligeia, and Leucosia, who sang and mimed in time to the music. There were thirty six working brass cannons.<ref>William Fowler, ''A True Reportarie'' (Edinburgh, 1594).</ref>\n\nThe ship was laden with all kinds of fish made from sugar, including herring, whiting, flounders, oysters, whelks, crabs and clams, served in Venetian glasses tinted with azure, which were distributed while [[Arion]] seated on a dolphin played his harp. Some Latin verses in praise of Anne were sung, followed by [[Psalm 128]] in canon with musical accompaniment.<ref>Thomas Thomson, ''History of the Kirk of Scotland by Mr David Calderwood'', vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), p. 345, \"there was sung the 128th Psalm with diverse voices and tunes, and musical instruments playing\".</ref> Triton blew his trumpet and Neptune whistled, and then the ship sailed away, firing the rest of its guns. The ship model was kept at Stirling Castle for many years. Fowler's book gives the dimensions:<blockquote>\"Presently after the returning of the Chariot, entered a most sumpteous, artificiall, and well proportioned ship, the length of her keele, was 18. foot, and her bredth 8. foote: from her bottome to her highest flagge, was 40. foot: the Sea shee stoode vpon, was 24. foot long, with bredth convenient: her motion was so artificially devised within her self, that none could perceive what brought her in.\"<ref>William Fowler, ''A True Reportarie'' (Edinburgh, 1594).</ref></blockquote>\n\nJames and Anne and the ambassadors went into a room in the Palace, hung with recently repaired tapestry, where there was another sugar banquet.

The event ended at 3 o'clock in the morning. Over the next few days James gave gifts to the ambassadors.\n\nIn 1610 the masque ''[[Tethys' Festival]]'' at the investiture of Prince Henry as [[Prince of Wales]] also had a maritime theme, Anne of Denmark played a sea goddess [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] in [[Milford Haven]] harbour, while her ladies-in-waiting personified rivers.

Anne however was forced to stay in Norway by accidents and bad weather, the circumstances which gave rise to Fowler mentioning thanksgiving for deliverance from witchcraft. The ambassador's masque would have comprised; six dancers wearing swords or [[falchion]]s with helmets dressed with feather plumes, presumably representing classical warriors; six masked torch bearers with hats with feathers, their costumes party-coloured in the Stewart colours red and yellow; four speaking parts wearing wigs and flower chaplets. Only the account for making the costumes is known, and the subject of the masque was not recorded.<ref>Henry Morley, ''Masques and Entertainments by Ben Jonson'' (London, 1890), pp. xii-xiii: James Robinson Planche, ''A Cyclopedia Of Costume'', vol. 2 (London, 1879), p. 394: John Payne Collier, ''Annals of the Stage'', vol. 1 (London, 1831), pp. 270-1, citing British Library Lansdowne MS 59.</ref> At the same time, James VI had sent [[Roger Aston]] to [[Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton|Lord Scrope]] at Carlisle for actors from the [[Queen Elizabeth's Men|Queen's Players]] who were at [[Knowsley Hall]] to perform in Edinburgh.

He said two of the Scottish envoys sent with invitations were unsuitable. Sir [[William Keith of Delny]] could not speak French, Latin, or Flemish, and the [[James Colville, 1st Lord Colville of Culross|laird of Easter Wemyss]] was chosen only because he happened to be travelling to London and Paris on his own business. Melville states that [[Peter Young (tutor)|Peter Young]] went to Denmark, Brunswick, and Mecklenberg, and was rewarded with gifts of three gold chains, but the dukes felt they would have been better honoured by a separate ambassador to each of them. Easter Wemyss received no rewards, because he was a messenger and did not have the status of an ambassador. Melville claimed that Elizabeth was more enthusiastic to be represented at the event when she learnt that [[Henry IV of France]] was not sending an ambassador.<ref>Thomas Thomson, ''Memoirs of his own life by Sir James Melville of Halhill'' (Edinburgh, 1827), p. 411.</ref>\n\nThe Danish ambassadors and the ambassadors from the two German dukes had arrived in Leith on 11 and 12 July.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 376.</ref> Melville was appointed to greet them, but he could not persuade them to ride up to [[Holyrood Palace]] together in the same convoy and instead had to organise two processions.

[[John Colville (c. 1540\u20131605)|John Colville]] wrote that the day after the ambassadors arrived Anne of Denmark took the ferry to [[Fife, Scotland|Fife]] and went to [[Falkland Palace]] to avoid them because she felt her accommodation at [[Holyroodhouse]] was not up to scratch.

Modern historians continue to debate these themes, and also with a focus on the role of Anne, or Anna of Denmark as an agent in these events, or debate the role of the African actor, and the costumed performances.

The precise relation is not clear but both lines were descended from Sir John Tichborne (d. 1498) Knight and Sheriff of Hampshire in 1488 & 1496, and (married circa 1465) Margaret Martin, daughter and heiress of Richard Martin of Edenbridge.  The line for [[Chidiock Tichborne]] is also descended from this couple.\n\nThe Harleian MS 5800 in the British Library has a handwritten pedigree for the Tichbornes, written 1658 for Robert Tichborne just after he had been Lord Mayor of London (1656\u201357) and for his elevation to the Lords by Cromwell.

This John's brother Morris, married Jane Chaloner, sister of Dorothy.\n\n3. who was son of John Tichborne (d.&nbsp;1556) and Alice Wolffe of Ashington, possibly daughter of Edward Wolffe of manor of Ashinton, W Sussex)\n\n4. who was second son of Maurice/Morris Tichborne (d. before 1508) and Margaret Courthope (d. 1533), daughter of William Courthope of Heath.\n\nThis Morris Tichborne was either a younger son of John Tichborne and Margaret Martin \u2013 or grandson, with two generations in quick succession, through Thomas Tichborne (born between 1470\u20131477).

{"title_page": "Forbearance", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|{{more citations needed|date=September 2018}}}}\n\n'''Forbearance''', in the context of a [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] process, is a special agreement between the [[Creditor|lender]] and the [[Debtor|borrower]] to delay a [[foreclosure]]. The literal meaning of forbearance is \u201cholding back.\u201d\n\nWhen mortgage borrowers are unable to meet their repayment terms, lenders may opt to [[Foreclosure|foreclose]]. To avoid foreclosure, the lender and the borrower can make an agreement called \"forbearance.\" According to this agreement, the lender delays its right to exercise foreclosure if the borrower can catch up to its [[payment schedule]] by a certain time. This period and the payment plan depend on the details of the agreement that is accepted by both parties.\n\nHistorically, forbearance has been granted for [[customer]]s in temporary or short-term financial difficulty. If the borrower has more serious problems, e. g. the return to full mortgage payments in the long term does not appear sustainable, then forbearance is usually not a solution. Each lender is likely to have its own suite of forbearance products.\n\n==Types of forbearance==\nExamples of the types of forbearance which lenders may potentially consider include:\n\n#A full moratorium on payments\n# Reduced payments:\n#* Above [[Interest-only loan|Interest-Only]] (termed Positive-Amortising)\n#* Below Interest-Only (Negative-Amortising)\n#*[[Interest-only loan|Interest Only]]\n# Reduced [[interest rate]]\n# Split Mortgage\n\nIt needs to be understood that the type of forbearance being granted is being provided based on the customer's individual circumstances. For example, borrowers in short-term financial difficulty would be more likely to be approved of either a (short term) full moratorium or negative-amortising deal than customers in long-term financial difficulty, where the lender would at all times seek to ensure that the capital balance continues to be reduced (via an amortising forbearance arrangement). Negative-amortising forbearance arrangements are only suitable as short-term deals since failure to pay interest timely and/or on the whole loan balance is effectively is additional borrowing. It is important to note that depending on the parameters of the agreement consumers can be held fully responsible for paying the entire amount due after the duration of the forbearance. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sinnock|first=Bonnie|date=April 8, 2020|title=Mortgage Forbearance Requests Surged as Corona Virus Spreads|url=|journal=American Banker|volume=185|issue=68|pages=Pg. 1|via=EBSCO Host}}</ref>\n\nA lender who grants a forbearance is refraining from enforcing its right to realize interest on securities under their agreement or contract with the borrower. This is done to assist the borrower in returning to a performing financial position as well as better position the lender to realize its security should the borrower fail to perform. The borrower does not escape their debt obligations by accepting the agreed forbearance amount and/or terms. On expiry of the agreed forbearance period the loan account reverts to its original form. In many instances, upon expiration of the forbearance period, the difference between the level of forbearance granted and the full repayment (which was missed) is recalculated over the remaining term and the customer's new repayment is based on the current loan balance, rate and term.\n\nSome exceptions to this is where a reduced rate was given (where the possible intention here to reduce the capital balance as quickly as possible, thereby reducing the loan to value) or where the type of forbearance is for the lifetime of the loan, i.e. a split loan where 1 part of the loan is parked until the expiry date, with the intention that at that time a suitable repayment vehicle (say, sale of asset) is in place for the repayment of the loan in full.\n\n==Forbearance internationally==\nThe term \u2018forbearance\u2019 is addressed by different names in different countries. The norms of a foreclosure agreement also vary. For example, in Australia, banks offer \u2018hardship variation\u2019 to borrowers struggling financially.

The literal meaning of forbearance is \u201cholding back.\u201d\n\nWhen mortgage borrowers are unable to meet their repayment terms, lenders may opt to [[Foreclosure|foreclose]]. To avoid foreclosure, the lender and the borrower can make an agreement called \"forbearance.\" According to this agreement, the lender delays its right to exercise foreclosure if the borrower can catch up to its [[payment schedule]] by a certain time. This period and the payment plan depend on the details of the agreement that is accepted by both parties.\n\nHistorically, forbearance has been granted for [[customer]]s in temporary or short-term financial difficulty. If the borrower has more serious problems, e. g. the return to full mortgage payments in the long term does not appear sustainable, then forbearance is usually not a solution. Each lender is likely to have its own suite of forbearance products.\n\n==Types of forbearance==\nExamples of the types of forbearance which lenders may potentially consider include:\n\n#A full moratorium on payments\n# Reduced payments:\n#* Above [[Interest-only loan|Interest-Only]] (termed Positive-Amortising)\n#* Below Interest-Only (Negative-Amortising)\n#*[[Interest-only loan|Interest Only]]\n# Reduced [[interest rate]]\n# Split Mortgage\n\nIt needs to be understood that the type of forbearance being granted is being provided based on the customer's individual circumstances. For example, borrowers in short-term financial difficulty would be more likely to be approved of either a (short term) full moratorium or negative-amortising deal than customers in long-term financial difficulty, where the lender would at all times seek to ensure that the capital balance continues to be reduced (via an amortising forbearance arrangement). Negative-amortising forbearance arrangements are only suitable as short-term deals since failure to pay interest timely and/or on the whole loan balance is effectively is additional borrowing.\n\nA lender who grants a forbearance is refraining from enforcing its right to realize interest on securities under their agreement or contract with the borrower. This is done to assist the borrower in returning to a performing financial position as well as better position the lender to realize its security should the borrower fail to perform. The borrower does not escape their debt obligations by accepting the agreed forbearance amount and/or terms. On expiry of the agreed forbearance period the loan account reverts to its original form. In many instances, upon expiration of the forbearance period, the difference between the level of forbearance granted and the full repayment (which was missed) is recalculated over the remaining term and the customer's new repayment is based on the current loan balance, rate and term.\n\nSome exceptions to this is where a reduced rate was given (where the possible intention here to reduce the capital balance as quickly as possible, thereby reducing the loan to value) or where the type of forbearance is for the lifetime of the loan, i.e. a split loan where 1 part of the loan is parked until the expiry date, with the intention that at that time a suitable repayment vehicle (say, sale of asset) is in place for the repayment of the loan in full.\n\n==Forbearance internationally==\nThe term \u2018forbearance\u2019 is addressed by different names in different countries. The norms of a foreclosure agreement also vary. For example, in Australia, banks offer \u2018hardship variation\u2019 to borrowers struggling financially. Borrowers can ask their lenders to make changes to the terms of their loans.\n\nBorrowers can either opt for a short-term relief by having their mortgage payment suspended for a short period of time (known as forbearance in the U.S.), or they can apply for reduced payments over the life of the loan's term (known as loan modification in the U.S.). Lenders are required to give a particular reason as to why an application for hardship variation was being turned down by them.
