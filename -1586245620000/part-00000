In 1531, a royal decree required the clergy to take an [[English post-Reformation oaths|oath acknowledging the King]] as [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]]. The bishops at the [[Convocation of Canterbury]] in 1532 agreed to sign the Oath but only under threat of praemunire and only after these words were added: \"as far as Christ law allows\".

Retrieved 1 December 2015.</ref>\n\n=== ''Utopia'' ===\n{{Main|Utopia (book)}}\n\nMore's best known and most controversial work, ''Utopia'' is a [[frame narrative]] written in Latin.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} More completed and theologian [[Erasmus]] published the book in [[Leuven]] in 1516, but it was only translated into English and published in his native land in 1551 (16 years after his execution), and the 1684 translation became the most commonly cited. More (also a character in the book) and the narrator/traveller, Raphael Hythlodaeus (whose name alludes both to the healer archangel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], and 'speaker of nonsense', the surname's Greek meaning), discuss modern ills in [[Antwerp]], as well as describe the political arrangements of the imaginary island country of Utopia (a Greek pun on 'ou-topos' [no place] and 'eu-topos' [good place]) among themselves as well as to [[Pieter Gillis]] and [[Hieronymus van Busleyden]]. Utopia's original edition included a symmetrical \"[[Utopian language#Writing system|Utopian alphabet]]\" omitted by later editions, but which may have been an early attempt or precursor of [[shorthand]].\n\nUtopia contrasts the contentious social life of European states with the perfectly orderly, reasonable social arrangements of Utopia and its environs (Tallstoria, Nolandia, and Aircastle). In Utopia, there are no lawyers because of the laws' simplicity and because social gatherings are in public view (encouraging participants to behave well), communal ownership supplants private property, men and women are educated alike, and there is almost complete religious toleration (except for atheists, who are allowed but despised). More may have used [[Monasticism|monastic communalism]] as his model, although other concepts such as legalising [[euthanasia]] remain far outside Church doctrine. Hythlodaeus asserts that a man who refuses to believe in a god or an afterlife could never be trusted, because he would not acknowledge any authority or principle outside himself. Some take the novel's principal message to be the social need for order and discipline rather than liberty. Ironically, Hythlodaeus, who believes philosophers should not get involved in politics, addresses More's ultimate conflict between his humanistic beliefs and courtly duties as the King's servant, pointing out that one day those morals will come into conflict with the political reality.\n\n''Utopia'' gave rise to a literary genre, [[Utopian and dystopian fiction]], which features ideal societies or perfect cities, or their opposite. Early works influenced by ''Utopia'' included ''[[New Atlantis]]'' by [[Francis Bacon]], ''[[Erewhon]]'' by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], and ''[[Candide]]'' by [[Voltaire]]. Although [[Utopianism]] combined classical concepts of perfect societies ([[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]) with Roman rhetorical finesse (cf. [[Cicero]], [[Quintilian]], [[epideictic]] oratory), the Renaissance genre continued into the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and survives in modern science fiction.\n\n=== Religious polemics ===\nIn 1520 the reformer [[Martin Luther]] published three works in quick succession: ''An Appeal to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation'' (Aug.), ''Concerning the Babylonish Captivity of the Church'' (Oct.), and ''On the Liberty of a Christian Man'' (Nov.).<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|225}} In these books, Luther set out his doctrine of salvation through grace alone, rejected certain Catholic practices, and attacked abuses and excesses within the Catholic Church.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|225\u20136}} In 1521, Henry VIII formally responded to Luther's criticisms with the ''Assertio,'' written with More's assistance. [[Pope Leo X]] rewarded the English king with the title 'Fidei defensor' (\"Defender of the Faith\") for his work combating Luther's heresies.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|226\u20137}}\n\nMartin Luther then attacked Henry VIII in print, calling him a \"pig, dolt, and liar\".<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|227}} At the king's request, More composed a rebuttal: the ''[[Responsio ad Lutherum]]'' was published at the end of 1523. In the ''Responsio,'' More defended papal supremacy, the sacraments, and other Church traditions. More, though considered \"a much steadier personality\",<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zENJHwQqSy0C |title=The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History |author=John Vidmar |publisher=Paulist Press |year=2005 |isbn=0809142341 |page=184|author-link=John Vidmar }}</ref> described Luther as an \"ape\", a \"drunkard\", and a \"lousy little friar\" amongst other epithets.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|230}} Hiding under the pseudonym of Gulielmus Rosseus,<ref name=rebhorn /> More tells Luther that:\n\n:for as long as your reverend paternity will be determined to tell these shameless lies, others will be permitted, on behalf of his English majesty, to throw back into your paternity's shitty mouth, truly the shit-pool of all shit, all the muck and shit which your damnable rottenness has vomited up, and to empty out all the sewers and privies onto your crown divested of the dignity of the priestly crown, against which no less than the kingly crown you have determined to play the buffoon.<ref name=\"Dundes\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cFvY2jWqBlQC |author1=Alan Dundes |author2=Carl R.

He thereafter avoided any hint of criticism of Church authority.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|230}} In 1528, More published another religious polemic, ''A Dialogue Concerning Heresies'', that asserted the Catholic Church was the one true church, established by Christ and the Apostles, and affirmed the validity of its authority, traditions and practices.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|279\u201381}} In 1529, the circulation of [[Simon Fish]]'s ''Supplication for the Beggars'' prompted More to respond with ''The Supplication of Souls''.\n\nIn 1531, a year after More's father died, [[William Tyndale]] published ''An Answer unto Sir Thomas More's Dialogue'' in response to More's ''Dialogue Concerning Heresies.'' More responded with a half million words: the ''Confutation of Tyndale's Answer''. The ''Confutation'' is an imaginary dialogue between More and Tyndale, with More addressing each of Tyndale's criticisms of Catholic rites and doctrines.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|307\u20139}} More, who valued structure, tradition and order in society as safeguards against tyranny and error, vehemently believed that Lutheranism and the Protestant Reformation in general were dangerous, not only to the Catholic faith but to the stability of society as a whole.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|307\u20139}}\n\n=== Correspondence ===\nMost major humanists were prolific letter writers, and Thomas More was no exception. As in the case of his friend Erasmus of Rotterdam, however, only a small portion of his correspondence (about 280 letters) survived. These include everything from personal letters to official government correspondence (mostly in English), letters to fellow humanist scholars (in Latin), several epistolary tracts, verse epistles, prefatory letters (some fictional) to several of More's own works, letters to More's children and their tutors (in Latin), and the so-called \"prison-letters\" (in English) which he exchanged with his oldest daughter Margaret while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London awaiting execution.<ref name=\"Gerard\" /> More also engaged in controversies, most notably with the French poet [[Germain de Brie]], which culminated in the publication of de Brie's ''Antimorus'' (1519). Erasmus intervened, however, and ended the dispute.<ref name=\"MoynahanBrian\" />\n\nMore also wrote about more spiritual matters. They include: ''A Treatise on the Passion'' (a.k.a. Treatise on the Passion of Christ), ''A Treatise to Receive the Blessed Body'' (a.k.a. Holy Body Treaty), and ''De Tristitia Christi'' (a.k.a. The Agony of Christ). More handwrote the last which reads in the Tower of London while awaiting his execution. This last manuscript, saved from the confiscation decreed by Henry VIII, passed by the will of his daughter Margaret to Spanish hands through Fray Pedro de Soto, confessor of Emperor Charles V. More's friend [[Luis Vives]] received it in Valencia, where it remains in the collection of [[Real Colegio Seminario del Corpus Christi]] museum.\n\n== Canonization ==\n[[File:MEDAILLON.OF.SAINT.THOMAS.MORE.jpg|thumb|Medal of Saint Thomas More]]\n\n==={{anchor|Catholic Church}} Catholic Church ===\n[[Pope Leo XIII]] [[beatification|beatified]] Thomas More, [[John Fisher]], and [[List of Catholic martyrs of the English Reformation#Beatified 29 December 1886 by Pope Leo XIII|52 other English Martyrs]] on 29 December 1886.

In it More is portrayed as a wise and honest statesman. The original manuscript has survived as a handwritten text that shows many revisions by its several authors, as well as the censorious influence of Edmund Tylney, [[Master of the Revels]] in the government of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. The script has since been published and has had several productions.<ref name=\"Long, William B. 1989 pages 49\">Long, William B. ''The Occasion of the Book of Sir Thomas More''.

Page 1</ref>\n\nThe 20th-century agnostic playwright [[Robert Bolt]] portrayed Thomas More as the [[tragic hero]] of his 1960 play ''[[A Man for All Seasons]]''. The title is drawn from what [[Robert Whittington]] in 1520 wrote of More:\n\n<blockquote>More is a man of an angel's wit and singular learning. I know not his fellow. For where is the man of that gentleness, lowliness and affability? And, as time requireth, a man of marvelous mirth and pastimes, and sometime of as sad gravity. A man for all seasons.<ref name=oconnell /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1966, the play ''A Man for All Seasons'' was adapted into a [[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|film]] with the same title. It was directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]] and adapted for the screen by the playwright. It stars [[Paul Scofield]], a noted British actor, who said that the part of Sir Thomas More was \"the most difficult part I played.\"<ref>Gary O'Connor (2002), ''Paul Scofield: An Actor for All Seasons'', Applause Books. Page 150.</ref> The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and Scofield won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]]. In 1988 [[Charlton Heston]] starred in and directed a made-for-television film that restored the character of \"the common man\" that had been cut from the 1966 film.\n\nCatholic science fiction writer [[R. A. Lafferty]] wrote his novel ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' as a modern equivalent to More's ''Utopia'', which he saw as a satire. In this novel, Thomas More travels through time to the year 2535, where he is made king of the world \"Astrobe\", only to be beheaded after ruling for a mere nine days. One character compares More favourably to almost every other major historical figure: \"He had one completely honest moment right at the end. I cannot think of anyone else who ever had one.\"\n\n[[Karl Zuchardt]]'s novel, ''[[Stirb du Narr!]]'' (\"Die you fool!\"), about More's struggle with [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry]], portrays More as an idealist bound to fail in the power struggle with a ruthless ruler and an unjust world.\n\nThe novelist [[Hilary Mantel]] portrays More as an unsympathetic persecutor of Protestants, and an ally of the Habsburg empire, in her 2009 novel ''[[Wolf Hall]]'', told from the perspective of a sympathetically portrayed [[Thomas Cromwell]].\n\nLiterary critic James Wood in his book ''The Broken Estate'', a collection of essays, is critical of More and refers to him as \"cruel in punishment, evasive in argument, lusty for power, and repressive in politics\".<ref name=\"Wood2010\">{{cite book|last=Wood|first=James|title=The Broken Estate: Essays on Literature and Belief|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JiI8Kwd6j9AC&pg=PA15|year=2010|publisher=Picador|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-42956-0|page=15}}</ref>\n\n[[Aaron Zelman]]'s non-fiction book ''The State Versus the People'' includes a comparison of ''Utopia'' with Plato's ''Republic''. Zelman is undecided as to whether More was being ironic in his book or was genuinely advocating a [[police state]]. Zelman comments, \"More is the only Christian saint to be honoured with a statue at the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]].\"{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} By this Zelman implies that ''Utopia'' influenced [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolsheviks]], despite their brutal repression of religion.\n\nOther biographers, such as [[Peter Ackroyd]], have offered a more sympathetic picture of More as both a sophisticated philosopher and man of letters, as well as a zealous Catholic who believed in the authority of the [[Holy See]] over [[Christendom]].\n\nThe protagonist of [[Walker Percy]]'s novels, ''[[Love in the Ruins]]'' and ''[[The Thanatos Syndrome]]'', is \"Dr Thomas More\", a reluctant Catholic and descendant of More.\n\nMore is the focus of the [[Al Stewart]] song \"A Man For All Seasons\" from the 1978 album ''[[Time Passages]]'', and of the [[Far (band)|Far]] song \"Sir\", featured on the limited editions and 2008 re-release of their 1994 album ''[[Quick (album)|Quick]]''. In addition, the song \"[[So Says I]]\" by indie rock outfit [[The Shins]] alludes to the socialist interpretation of More's ''Utopia''.\n\n[[Jeremy Northam]] depicts More in the television series ''[[The Tudors]] ''as a peaceful man, as well as a devout Roman Catholic and loving family patriarch. He also shows More loathing Protestantism, burning both Martin Luther's books and English Protestants who have been convicted of heresy. The portrayal has unhistorical aspects, such as that More neither personally caused nor attended [[Simon Fish]]'s execution (since Fish actually died of [[bubonic plague]] in 1531 before he could stand trial), although More's ''The Supplycatyon of Soulys'', published in October 1529, addressed Fish's [[Simon Fish#Supplycatyon of Soulys: St. Thomas More's Response to Simon Fish|''Supplication for the Beggars'']].<ref name=FishOnline1>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/asupplicacyonfo01fishgoog|quote=simon fish.|title=A Supplicacyon for the Beggers|publisher=Early English Text Society|last1=Fish|first1=Simon|year=1871}}</ref><ref name=MoreVsFish1>see Fish, Simon. \"Supplycacion for the Beggar.\" 1529 in Carroll, Gerald L. and Joseph B.

The series also neglected to show More's avowed insistence that Richard Rich's testimony about More disputing the King's title as [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]] was perjured.\n\nIn 2002, More was placed at number 37 in the BBC's poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].<ref>Sue Parrill, William Baxter Robison (2013). \"The Tudors on Film and Television\", p. 92.

[[Crosby Hall, London|Crosby Hall]], which was part of More's London residence, was eventually relocated and reconstructed in Chelsea by conservation architect [[Walter Godfrey]] in 1910. Rebuilt in the 1990s, the white stone building stands amid modern brick structures that attempt to recapture the style of More's former manor on the site. Crosby Hall is privately owned and closed to the public. The modern structures face the Thames and include an entry way that displays More's arms, heraldic beasts, and a Latin maxim. Apartment buildings and a park cover the former gardens and orchard; Roper's Garden is the park atop one of More's gardens, sunken as his was believed to be. No other remnants exist of the More estate.\n\n=== Chelsea Old Church ===\n[[File:Chelsea Old Church 14.JPG|thumb|Thomas More statue, Chelsea Old Church]]\nAcross a small park and Old Church Street from Crosby Hall is [[Chelsea Old Church]], an Anglican church whose southern chapel More commissioned and in which he sang with the parish choir. Except for his chapel, the church was largely destroyed in the Second World War and rebuilt in 1958. The capitals on the medieval arch connecting the chapel to the main sanctuary display symbols associated with More and his office. On the southern wall of the sanctuary is the tomb and epitaph he erected for himself and his wives, detailing his ancestry and accomplishments in Latin, including his role as peacemaker between the various Christian European states as well as a curiously altered portion about his curbing heresy. When More served Mass, he would leave by the door just to the left of it. He is not, however, buried here, nor is it entirely certain which of his family may be. It is open to the public at specific times. Outside the church, facing the [[River Thames]], is a statue by L. Cubitt Bevis erected in 1969, commemorating More as \"saint\", \"scholar\", and \"statesman\"; the back displays his coat-of-arms. Nearby, on Upper Cheyne Row, the Roman Catholic Church of Our Most Holy Redeemer & St. Thomas More honours the martyr.\n\n=== Tower Hill ===\nA plaque and small garden commemorate the famed execution site on Tower Hill, London, just outside the Tower of London, as well as all those executed there, many as religious martyrs or as prisoners of conscience. More's corpse, minus his head, was unceremoniously buried in an unmarked mass grave beneath the [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula|Royal Chapel of St. Peter Ad Vincula]], within the walls of the [[Tower of London]], as was the custom for traitors executed at Tower Hill. The chapel is accessible to Tower visitors.\n\n=== St Katharine Docks ===\nThomas More is commemorated by a stone [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] near [[St Katharine Docks]], just east of the Tower where he was executed. The street in which it is situated was formerly called Nightingale Lane, a corruption of \"Knighten Guild\", derived from the original owners of the land. It is now renamed Thomas More Street in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploringeastlondon.co.uk/eel/Stkatharines/Stkatharines.htm#More|title=St Katharine's Dock|publisher=Exploring East London|accessdate=4 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== St Dunstan's Church and Roper House, Canterbury ===\n[[St. Dunstan's, Canterbury|St Dunstan's Church]], an Anglican parish church in Canterbury, possesses More's head, rescued by his daughter [[Margaret Roper]], whose family lived in Canterbury down and across the street from their parish church. A stone immediately to the left of the altar marks the sealed Roper family vault beneath the Nicholas Chapel, itself to the right of the church's sanctuary or main altar. [[St. Dunstan's, Canterbury|St Dunstan's Church]] has carefully investigated, preserved and sealed this burial vault. The last archaeological investigation revealed that the suspected head of More rests in a niche separate from the other bodies, possibly from later interference.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schulte Herbr\u00fcggen|first=Hubertus|title=Das Haupt des Thomas Morus in der St. Dunstan-Kirche zu Canterbury|series=Forschungsberichte des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen|year=1982|publisher=VS Verlag f\u00fcr Sozialwissenschaften}}</ref> Displays in the chapel record the archaeological findings in pictures and narratives. Roman Catholics donated stained glass to commemorate the events in More's life.

Retrieved 1 December 2015.</ref>\n\n=== ''Utopia'' ===\n{{Main|Utopia (book)}}\n\nMore's best known and most controversial work, ''Utopia'' is a [[frame narrative]] written in Latin.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} More completed and theologian [[Erasmus]] published the book in [[Leuven]] in 1516, but it was only translated into English and published in his native land in 1551 (16 years after his execution), and the 1684 translation became the most commonly cited. More (also a character in the book) and the narrator/traveller, Raphael Hythlodaeus (whose name alludes both to the healer archangel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], and 'speaker of nonsense', the surname's Greek meaning), discuss modern ills in [[Antwerp]], as well as describe the political arrangements of the imaginary island country of Utopia (a Greek pun on 'ou-topos' [no place] and 'eu-topos' [good place]) among themselves as well as to [[Pieter Gillis]] and [[Hieronymus van Busleyden]]. Utopia's original edition included a symmetrical \"[[Utopian language#Writing system|Utopian alphabet]]\" omitted by later editions, but which may have been an early attempt or precursor of [[shorthand]].\n\nUtopia contrasts the contentious social life of European states with the perfectly orderly, reasonable social arrangements of Utopia and its environs (Tallstoria, Nolandia, and Aircastle). In Utopia, there are no lawyers because of the laws' simplicity and because social gatherings are in public view (encouraging participants to behave well), communal ownership supplants private property, men and women are educated alike, and there is almost complete religious toleration (except for atheists, who are allowed but despised). More may have used [[Monasticism|monastic communalism]] as his model, although other concepts such as legalising [[euthanasia]] remain far outside Church doctrine. Hythlodaeus asserts that a man who refuses to believe in a god or an afterlife could never be trusted, because he would not acknowledge any authority or principle outside himself. Some take the novel's principal message to be the social need for order and discipline rather than liberty. Ironically, Hythlodaeus, who believes philosophers should not get involved in politics, addresses More's ultimate conflict between his humanistic beliefs and courtly duties as the King's servant, pointing out that one day those morals will come into conflict with the political reality.\n\n''Utopia'' gave rise to a literary genre, [[Utopian and dystopian fiction]], which features ideal societies or perfect cities, or their opposite. Early works influenced by ''Utopia'' included ''[[New Atlantis]]'' by [[Francis Bacon]], ''[[Erewhon]]'' by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], and ''[[Candide]]'' by [[Voltaire]]. Although [[Utopianism]] combined classical concepts of perfect societies ([[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]) with Roman rhetorical finesse (cf. [[Cicero]], [[Quintilian]], [[epideictic]] oratory), the Renaissance genre continued into the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and survives in modern science fiction.\n\n=== Religious polemics ===\nIn 1520 the reformer [[Martin Luther]] published three works in quick succession: ''An Appeal to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation'' (Aug.), ''Concerning the Babylonish Captivity of the Church'' (Oct.), and ''On the Liberty of a Christian Man'' (Nov.).<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|225}} In these books, Luther set out his doctrine of salvation through grace alone, rejected certain Catholic practices, and attacked abuses and excesses within the Catholic Church.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|225\u20136}} In 1521, Henry VIII formally responded to Luther's criticisms with the ''Assertio,'' written with More's assistance. [[Pope Leo X]] rewarded the English king with the title 'Fidei defensor' (\"Defender of the Faith\") for his work combating Luther's heresies.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|226\u20137}}\n\nMartin Luther then attacked Henry VIII in print, calling him a \"pig, dolt, and liar\".<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|227}} At the king's request, More composed a rebuttal: the ''[[Responsio ad Lutherum]]'' was published at the end of 1523. In the ''Responsio,'' More defended papal supremacy, the sacraments, and other Church traditions. More, though considered \"a much steadier personality\",<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zENJHwQqSy0C |title=The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History |author=John Vidmar |publisher=Paulist Press |year=2005 |isbn=0809142341 |page=184|author-link=John Vidmar }}</ref> described Luther as an \"ape\", a \"drunkard\", and a \"lousy little friar\" amongst other epithets.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|230}} Writing under the pseudonym of Gulielmus Rosseus,<ref name=rebhorn /> More tells Luther that:\n\n:for as long as your reverend paternity will be determined to tell these shameless lies, others will be permitted, on behalf of his English majesty, to throw back into your paternity's shitty mouth, truly the shit-pool of all shit, all the muck and shit which your damnable rottenness has vomited up, and to empty out all the sewers and privies onto your crown divested of the dignity of the priestly crown, against which no less than the kingly crown you have determined to play the buffoon.<ref name=\"Dundes\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cFvY2jWqBlQC |author1=Alan Dundes |author2=Carl R.

He thereafter avoided any hint of criticism of Church authority.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|230}} In 1528, More published another religious polemic, ''A Dialogue Concerning Heresies'', that asserted the Catholic Church was the one true church, established by Christ and the Apostles, and affirmed the validity of its authority, traditions and practices.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|279\u201381}} In 1529, the circulation of [[Simon Fish]]'s ''Supplication for the Beggars'' prompted More to respond with ''The Supplication of Souls''.\n\nIn 1531, a year after More's father died, [[William Tyndale]] published ''An Answer unto Sir Thomas More's Dialogue'' in response to More's ''Dialogue Concerning Heresies.'' More responded with a half million words: the ''Confutation of Tyndale's Answer''. The ''Confutation'' is an imaginary dialogue between More and Tyndale, with More addressing each of Tyndale's criticisms of Catholic rites and doctrines.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|307\u20139}} More, who valued structure, tradition and order in society as safeguards against tyranny and error, vehemently believed that Lutheranism and the Protestant Reformation in general were dangerous, not only to the Catholic faith but to the stability of society as a whole.<ref name=\"Ackroyd\" />{{rp|307\u20139}}\n\n=== Correspondence ===\nMost major humanists were prolific letter writers, and Thomas More was no exception. As in the case of his friend Erasmus of Rotterdam, however, only a small portion of his correspondence (about 280 letters) survived. These include everything from personal letters to official government correspondence (mostly in English), letters to fellow humanist scholars (in Latin), several epistolary tracts, verse epistles, prefatory letters (some fictional) to several of More's own works, letters to More's children and their tutors (in Latin), and the so-called \"prison-letters\" (in English) which he exchanged with his oldest daughter Margaret while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London awaiting execution.<ref name=\"Gerard\" /> More also engaged in controversies, most notably with the French poet [[Germain de Brie]], which culminated in the publication of de Brie's ''Antimorus'' (1519). Erasmus intervened, however, and ended the dispute.<ref name=\"MoynahanBrian\" />\n\nMore also wrote about more spiritual matters. They include: ''A Treatise on the Passion'' (a.k.a. Treatise on the Passion of Christ), ''A Treatise to Receive the Blessed Body'' (a.k.a. Holy Body Treaty), and ''De Tristitia Christi'' (a.k.a. The Agony of Christ). More handwrote the last which reads in the Tower of London while awaiting his execution. This last manuscript, saved from the confiscation decreed by Henry VIII, passed by the will of his daughter Margaret to Spanish hands through Fray Pedro de Soto, confessor of Emperor Charles V. More's friend [[Luis Vives]] received it in Valencia, where it remains in the collection of [[Real Colegio Seminario del Corpus Christi]] museum.\n\n== Canonization ==\n[[File:MEDAILLON.OF.SAINT.THOMAS.MORE.jpg|thumb|Medal of Saint Thomas More]]\n\n==={{anchor|Catholic Church}} Catholic Church ===\n[[Pope Leo XIII]] [[beatification|beatified]] Thomas More, [[John Fisher]], and [[List of Catholic martyrs of the English Reformation#Beatified 29 December 1886 by Pope Leo XIII|52 other English Martyrs]] on 29 December 1886.

In it More is portrayed as a wise and honest statesman. The original manuscript has survived as a handwritten text that shows many revisions by its several authors, as well as the censorious influence of Edmund Tylney, [[Master of the Revels]] in the government of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].

The title is drawn from what [[Robert Whittington]] in 1520 wrote of More:\n\n<blockquote>More is a man of an angel's wit and singular learning. I know not his fellow. For where is the man of that gentleness, lowliness and affability? And, as time requireth, a man of marvelous mirth and pastimes, and sometime of as sad gravity. A man for all seasons.<ref name=oconnell /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1966, the play ''A Man for All Seasons'' was adapted into a [[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|film]] with the same title. It was directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]] and adapted for the screen by the playwright. It stars [[Paul Scofield]], a noted British actor, who said that the part of Sir Thomas More was \"the most difficult part I played.\"<ref>Gary O'Connor (2002), ''Paul Scofield: An Actor for All Seasons'', Applause Books. Page 150.</ref> The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and Scofield won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]]. In 1988 [[Charlton Heston]] starred in and directed a made-for-television film that restored the character of \"the common man\" that had been cut from the 1966 film.\n\nCatholic science fiction writer [[R. A. Lafferty]] wrote his novel ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' as a modern equivalent to More's ''Utopia'', which he saw as a satire. In this novel, Thomas More travels through time to the year 2535, where he is made king of the world \"Astrobe\", only to be beheaded after ruling for a mere nine days. One character compares More favourably to almost every other major historical figure: \"He had one completely honest moment right at the end. I cannot think of anyone else who ever had one.\"\n\n[[Karl Zuchardt]]'s novel, ''[[Stirb du Narr!]]'' (\"Die you fool!\"), about More's struggle with [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry]], portrays More as an idealist bound to fail in the power struggle with a ruthless ruler and an unjust world.\n\nThe novelist [[Hilary Mantel]] portrays More as an unsympathetic persecutor of Protestants, and an ally of the Habsburg empire, in her 2009 novel ''[[Wolf Hall]]'', told from the perspective of a sympathetically portrayed [[Thomas Cromwell]].\n\nLiterary critic James Wood in his book ''The Broken Estate'', a collection of essays, is critical of More and refers to him as \"cruel in punishment, evasive in argument, lusty for power, and repressive in politics\".<ref name=\"Wood2010\">{{cite book|last=Wood|first=James|title=The Broken Estate: Essays on Literature and Belief|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JiI8Kwd6j9AC&pg=PA15|year=2010|publisher=Picador|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-42956-0|page=15}}</ref>\n\n[[Aaron Zelman]]'s non-fiction book ''The State Versus the People'' includes a comparison of ''Utopia'' with Plato's ''Republic''. Zelman is undecided as to whether More was being ironic in his book or was genuinely advocating a [[police state]]. Zelman comments, \"More is the only Christian saint to be honoured with a statue at the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]].\"{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} By this Zelman implies that ''Utopia'' influenced [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolsheviks]], despite their brutal repression of religion.\n\nOther biographers, such as [[Peter Ackroyd]], have offered a more sympathetic picture of More as both a sophisticated philosopher and man of letters, as well as a zealous Catholic who believed in the authority of the [[Holy See]] over [[Christendom]].\n\nThe protagonist of [[Walker Percy]]'s novels, ''[[Love in the Ruins]]'' and ''[[The Thanatos Syndrome]]'', is \"Dr Thomas More\", a reluctant Catholic and descendant of More.\n\nMore is the focus of the [[Al Stewart]] song \"A Man For All Seasons\" from the 1978 album ''[[Time Passages]]'', and of the [[Far (band)|Far]] song \"Sir\", featured on the limited editions and 2008 re-release of their 1994 album ''[[Quick (album)|Quick]]''. In addition, the song \"[[So Says I]]\" by indie rock outfit [[The Shins]] alludes to the socialist interpretation of More's ''Utopia''.\n\n[[Jeremy Northam]] depicts More in the television series ''[[The Tudors]] ''as a peaceful man, as well as a devout Roman Catholic and loving family patriarch. He also shows More loathing Protestantism, burning both Martin Luther's books and English Protestants who have been convicted of heresy. The portrayal has unhistorical aspects, such as that More neither personally caused nor attended [[Simon Fish]]'s execution (since Fish actually died of [[bubonic plague]] in 1531 before he could stand trial), although More's ''The Supplycatyon of Soulys'', published in October 1529, addressed Fish's [[Simon Fish#Supplycatyon of Soulys: St. Thomas More's Response to Simon Fish|''Supplication for the Beggars'']].<ref name=FishOnline1>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/asupplicacyonfo01fishgoog|quote=simon fish.|title=A Supplicacyon for the Beggers|publisher=Early English Text Society|last1=Fish|first1=Simon|year=1871}}</ref><ref name=MoreVsFish1>see Fish, Simon. \"Supplycacion for the Beggar.\" 1529 in Carroll, Gerald L. and Joseph B.

The series also neglected to show More's avowed insistence that Richard Rich's testimony about More disputing the King's title as [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]] was perjured.\n\nIn 2002, More was placed at number 37 in the BBC's poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].<ref>Sue Parrill, William Baxter Robison (2013). \"The Tudors on Film and Television\", p. 92.

Rebuilt in the 1990s, the white stone building stands amid modern brick structures that attempt to recapture the style of More's former manor on the site. Crosby Hall is privately owned and closed to the public. The modern structures face the Thames and include an entry way that displays More's arms, heraldic beasts, and a Latin maxim. Apartment buildings and a park cover the former gardens and orchard; Roper's Garden is the park atop one of More's gardens, sunken as his was believed to be. No other remnants exist of the More estate.\n\n=== Chelsea Old Church ===\n[[File:Chelsea Old Church 14.JPG|thumb|Thomas More statue, Chelsea Old Church]]\nAcross a small park and Old Church Street from Crosby Hall is [[Chelsea Old Church]], an Anglican church whose southern chapel More commissioned and in which he sang with the parish choir. Except for his chapel, the church was largely destroyed in the Second World War and rebuilt in 1958. The capitals on the medieval arch connecting the chapel to the main sanctuary display symbols associated with More and his office. On the southern wall of the sanctuary is the tomb and epitaph he erected for himself and his wives, detailing his ancestry and accomplishments in Latin, including his role as peacemaker between the various Christian European states as well as a curiously altered portion about his curbing heresy. When More served Mass, he would leave by the door just to the left of it. He is not, however, buried here, nor is it entirely certain which of his family may be. It is open to the public at specific times. Outside the church, facing the [[River Thames]], is a statue by L. Cubitt Bevis erected in 1969, commemorating More as \"saint\", \"scholar\", and \"statesman\"; the back displays his coat-of-arms. Nearby, on Upper Cheyne Row, the Roman Catholic Church of Our Most Holy Redeemer & St. Thomas More honours the martyr.\n\n=== Tower Hill ===\nA plaque and small garden commemorate the famed execution site on Tower Hill, London, just outside the Tower of London, as well as all those executed there, many as religious martyrs or as prisoners of conscience. More's corpse, minus his head, was unceremoniously buried in an unmarked mass grave beneath the [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula|Royal Chapel of St. Peter Ad Vincula]], within the walls of the [[Tower of London]], as was the custom for traitors executed at Tower Hill. The chapel is accessible to Tower visitors.\n\n=== St Katharine Docks ===\nThomas More is commemorated by a stone [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] near [[St Katharine Docks]], just east of the Tower where he was executed. The street in which it is situated was formerly called Nightingale Lane, a corruption of \"Knighten Guild\", derived from the original owners of the land. It is now renamed Thomas More Street in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploringeastlondon.co.uk/eel/Stkatharines/Stkatharines.htm#More|title=St Katharine's Dock|publisher=Exploring East London|accessdate=4 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== St Dunstan's Church and Roper House, Canterbury ===\n[[St. Dunstan's, Canterbury|St Dunstan's Church]], an Anglican parish church in Canterbury, possesses More's head, rescued by his daughter [[Margaret Roper]], whose family lived in Canterbury down and across the street from their parish church. A stone immediately to the left of the altar marks the sealed Roper family vault beneath the Nicholas Chapel, itself to the right of the church's sanctuary or main altar. [[St. Dunstan's, Canterbury|St Dunstan's Church]] has carefully investigated, preserved and sealed this burial vault. The last archaeological investigation revealed that the suspected head of More rests in a niche separate from the other bodies, possibly from later interference.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schulte Herbr\u00fcggen|first=Hubertus|title=Das Haupt des Thomas Morus in der St. Dunstan-Kirche zu Canterbury|series=Forschungsberichte des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen|year=1982|publisher=VS Verlag f\u00fcr Sozialwissenschaften}}</ref> Displays in the chapel record the archaeological findings in pictures and narratives. Roman Catholics donated stained glass to commemorate the events in More's life. A small plaque marks the former home of William and Margaret Roper; another house nearby and entitled Roper House is now a home for the deaf.\n\n== Works ==\nNote: The reference \"CW\" is to the relevant volume of the ''[[Yale Edition of the Complete Works of St. Thomas More]]'' (New Haven and London 1963\u20131997)\n\n=== Published during More's life (with dates of publication) ===\n* ''A Merry Jest'' (c. 1516) (CW 1)\n* ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516) (CW 4)\n* ''Latin Poems'' (1518, 1520) (CW 3, Pt.2)\n* ''Letter to Brixius'' (1520) (CW 3, Pt. 2, App C)\n* ''[[Responsio ad Lutherum]]'' (The Answer to Luther, 1523) (CW 5)\n* ''A Dialogue Concerning Heresies'' (1529, 1530) (CW 6)\n* ''Supplication of Souls'' (1529) (CW 7)\n* ''Letter Against Frith'' (1532) (CW 7) [https://www.thomasmorestudies.org/1557Workes/Letter_Frith.pdf pdf]\n* ''The Confutation of Tyndale's Answer'' (1532, 1533) (CW 8) Books 1\u20134, [https://www.thomasmorestudies.org/docs/Confutation5-9_2014-etext.pdf Books 5\u20139]\n* ''Apology'' (1533) (CW 9)\n* ''Debellation of Salem and Bizance'' (1533) (CW 10) [https://www.thomasmorestudies.org/docs/Debellation2014-etext.pdf pdf]\n* ''The Answer to a Poisoned Book'' (1533) (CW 11) [https://www.thomasmorestudies.org/docs/AnswerPoisonedBook2014-etext.pdf pdf]\n\n=== Published after More's death (with likely dates of composition) ===\n* ''The History of King Richard III'' (c. 1513\u20131518) (CW 2 & 15)\n* ''The Four Last Things'' (c. 1522) (CW 1)\n* ''[[A Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation]]'' (1534) (CW 12)\n* ''Treatise Upon the Passion'' (1534) (CW 13)\n* ''Treatise on the Blessed Body'' (1535) (CW 13)\n* ''Instructions and Prayers'' (1535) (CW 13)\n* ''De Tristitia Christi'' (1535) (CW 14) (preserved in the [[Real Colegio Seminario del Corpus Christi]], Valencia)\n\n== Translations ==\n* ''Translations of Lucian'' (many dates 1506\u20131534) (CW 3, Pt.1)\n* ''The Life of [[Pico della Mirandola]]'', by Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola (c. 1510) (CW 1)\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Saints|Biography}}\n* [[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)]]\n* [[English Reformation]]\n* [[Moreana]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Biographies ==\n* {{cite book | last = Ackroyd | first = Peter|title= The Life of Thomas More| url = https://archive.org/details/lifeofthomasmore00ackr | url-access = registration |year= 1999 | authorlink = Peter Ackroyd}}\n* {{cite book | last = Basset | first = Bernard, SJ | title = Born for Friendship: The Spirit of Sir Thomas More|year=1965|location=London|publisher=Burns & Oates}}\n* {{cite book | last = Berglar| first = Peter|authorlink= Peter Berglar|title= Thomas More: A Lonely Voice against the Power of the State | publisher = Scepter Publishers | location = New York | year = 2009 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=5eAN_FrS2o4C| isbn = 978-1-59417-073-7}} (Note: this is a 2009 translation (from the original German, by [[Hector de Cavilla]]) of Berglar's 1978 work ''Die Stunde des Thomas Morus \u2013 Einer gegen die Macht''.
