The aircraft family was first introduced at the [[Paris Air Show]] in 1999 and entered production in 2002.

The aircraft family was first introduced at the [[Paris Air Show]] in 1999 and entered production in 2002.  The series has been a commercial success primarily due to its ability to efficiently serve lower-demand routes while offering many of the same amenities and features of larger jets.

The trio forged a working partnership, and Donna was signed to their Oasis label in 1974. A demo tape of Summer's work with Moroder and Bellotte led to a deal with the European-distributed label Groovy Records. Due to an error on the record cover, Donna Sommer became Donna Summer; the name stuck. Summer's first album was ''[[Lady of the Night (album)|Lady of the Night]]''. It became a hit in the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and Belgium on the strength of two songs, \"[[The Hostage (song)|The Hostage]]\" and the title track \"Lady of the Night\". \"[[The Hostage (song)|The Hostage]]\" reached the top of the charts in France, but was removed from radio playlists in Germany because of the song's subject matter; a high ranking politician that had recently been kidnapped and held for ransom.<ref name=\"CLbio\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.classicbands.com/summer.html |title=Donna Summer |publisher=Classicbands.com |accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref> One of her first TV appearances was in the television show, ''[[Van Oekel's Discohoek]]'', which started the breakthrough of \"[[The Hostage (song)|The Hostage]]\", and in which she gracefully went along with the scripted absurdity and chaos in the show.\n\nIn 1975, Summer passed on an idea for a song to Moroder who was working with another artist; a song that would be called \"[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You]]\". Summer and [[Giorgio Moroder|Moroder]] wrote the song together, and together they worked on a demo version with Summer singing the song. [[Giorgio Moroder|Moroder]] decided that Summer's version should be released. Seeking an American release for the song, it was sent to [[Casablanca Records]] president [[Neil Bogart]]. Bogart played the song at one of his extravagant industry parties, where it was so popular with the crowd, they insisted that it be played over and over, each time it ended. Bogart requested that Moroder produce a longer version for discoth\u00e8ques. Moroder, [[Pete Bellotte|Bellotte]], and Summer returned with a 17-minute version. Bogart tweaked the title to \"[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You Baby]]\", and [[Casablanca Records|Casablanca]] signed Summer, releasing the single in November 1975. The shorter 7\" version of the single was promoted by radio stations, while clubs regularly played the 17 minute version (the longer version would also appear on the album).\n\nBy early 1976, \"Love to Love You Baby\" had reached No. 2 on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart and had become a Gold single, while the album had sold over a million copies. The song generated controversy due to Summer's moans and groans, and some American stations, like those in Europe with the initial release, refused to play it.<ref name=\"telegraph2\"/>  Despite this, \"Love to Love You Baby\" found chart success in several European countries, and made the Top 5 in the United Kingdom despite the BBC ban. Casablanca wasted no time releasing the album ''[[A Love Trilogy]]'', featuring \"[[Try Me, I Know We Can Make It]]\" No. 80 and Summer's remarkable rendition of [[Barry Manilow]]'s \"[[Could It Be Magic]]\" No. 52, which was followed by ''[[Four Seasons of Love]]'', which spawned the singles \"[[Spring Affair]]\" No. 58 and \"[[Winter Melody]]\", No. 43. Both albums went Gold.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn 1977, Summer released the concept album ''[[I Remember Yesterday]]''. The song \"[[I Feel Love]]\", reached No. 6 on the Hot 100 chart. and No. 1 in the UK. She received her first [[American Music Award]] nomination for Favorite Soul/R&B Female Artist. The single would attain Gold status and the album went Platinum in the U.S. Another concept album, also released in 1977, was ''[[Once Upon a Time (Donna Summer album)|Once Upon a Time]]'', a double album which told of a modern-day [[Cinderella]] \"rags to riches\" story. This album would attain Gold status. Summer recorded the song \"[[Down Deep Inside]]\" as the theme song for the 1977 film ''[[The Deep (1977 film)|The Deep]]''. In 1978, Summer acted in the film ''[[Thank God It's Friday (film)|Thank God It's Friday]]'', the film met with modest success; the song \"[[Last Dance (Donna Summer song)|Last Dance]]\", reached No. 3 on the Hot 100. The soundtrack and single both went Gold and resulted in Summer winning her first [[Grammy Award]], for [[Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]]. Its writer, [[Paul Jabara]], won both an [[Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] for the composition. Summer also had \"[[With Your Love]]\" and \"[[Je t'aime... moi non plus#Covers|Je t'aime... moi non plus]]\", on the soundtrack. Her version of the [[Jimmy Webb]] ballad, \"[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]\", became her first No. 1 hit on the Hot 100 chart. It was also the only No. 1 hit for songwriter Jimmy Webb; the single went Gold and topped the charts for three weeks. She received a Grammy nomination for [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]. The song was featured on Summer's first live album, ''[[Live and More]]'', which also became her first album to hit number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and went double-Platinum, selling over 2 million copies.

Summer performed at the world-televised [[Music for UNICEF Concert]], joining contemporaries such as [[ABBA]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], the [[Bee Gees]], [[Andy Gibb]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[John Denver]], [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], [[Rita Coolidge]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]] for a TV special that raised funds and awareness for the world's children. Artists donated royalties of certain songs, some in perpetuity, to benefit the cause. Summer began work on her next project with Moroder and Bellotte, ''[[Bad Girls (Donna Summer album)|Bad Girls]]''. [[Giorgio Moroder|Mororder]] brought in [[Harold Faltermeyer]], with whom he had collaborated on the soundtrack of film ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]'', to be the album's arranger.

Including \"Heaven Knows\" and \"Dim All the Lights\" she had achieved six top 4 singles on the Hot 100 chart in the same 12-month period. Those songs, along with \"Last Dance\", \"[[On the Radio (Donna Summer song)|On the Radio]]\", and \"[[The Wanderer (Donna Summer song)|The Wanderer]]\", would give her nine Top 5 singles on the Hot 100 chart in just over a two-year period. The single, \"No More Tears (Enough is Enough)\" would sell over 2 million copies becoming a Platinum success. \"Hot Stuff\" won her a Grammy Award in the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]], the first time the category was included. She was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] and both [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] and [[Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]], as well as [[Best Disco Recording]]. That year, Summer played eight sold-out nights at the [[Universal Amphitheater]] in Los Angeles.\n\nCasablanca then released ''[[On the Radio: Greatest Hits Volumes I & II]]'', her first (international) greatest hits set, in 1979. The album was mixed differently than the original songs issued on it, with each song segueing into the next, and included two new songs \"On the Radio\" and \"No More Tears (Enough is Enough)\". It would be the first time that such an album package would be made. The album went No. 1, her third consecutive No. 1 album on the ''Billboard'' 200, and gained double-Platinum status. \"On the Radio\", reached No. 5, selling over a million copies in the U.S. alone, making it a Gold single. Summer would again receive a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]].\n\n===1980\u20131985===\nSummer received four nominations for the [[American Music Awards of 1980|7th Annual American Music Awards]] in January 1980, and took home awards for Female Pop/Rock and Female Soul/R&B Artist; and well as Pop/Rock single for \"[[Bad Girls (Donna Summer song)|Bad Girls]]\". Just over a week after the awards, Summer had her own nationally televised special, ''[[The Donna Summer Special]]'',<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/tv/show/46047/Donna-Summer-Special/overview|title=The Donna Summer Special|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> which aired on ABC network on January 27, 1980. After the release of the ''[[On the Radio (Donna Summer song)|On the Radio]]'' album, Summer wanted to branch out into other musical styles, which led to tensions between her and [[Casablanca Records]]. [[Casablanca Records|Casablanca]] wanted her to continue to record disco only. Summer was upset with President [[Neil Bogart]] over the early release of the single \"[[No More Tears (Enough is Enough)]]\"; she had penned \"[[Dim All the Lights]]\" alone, and was hoping for a number-one hit as a songwriter. Not waiting until \"Dim All the Lights\" had peaked, or at least another month as promised; Summer felt it had detracted from the singles chart momentum. Summer and the label parted ways in 1980, and she signed with [[Geffen Records]], the new label started by [[David Geffen]]. Summer had filed a 10-million-dollar suit against [[Casablanca Records|Casablanca]]; the label counter-sued. In the end, she did not receive any money, but won the rights to her own lucrative song publishing.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3554408/Donna-Summer-too-hot-to-handle.html |title=Donna Summer: too hot to handle |newspaper=Telegraph |date=June 13, 2008 |accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSummer's first Geffen album, ''[[The Wanderer (Donna Summer album)|The Wanderer]]'', featured an eclectic mixture of sounds, bringing elements of [[rock music|rock]], [[rockabilly]], [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[gospel music]]. ''The Wanderer'' was rushed to market. The producers of the album wanted more production time. The album continued Summer's streak of Gold albums with the [[The Wanderer (Donna Summer song)|title track]] peaking at {{abbr|No.|Number}} 3 on the Hot 100 chart. Its follow-up singles were, \"[[Cold Love]]\" {{abbr|No.|Number}}33 and \"[[Who Do You Think You're Foolin']]\", {{abbr|No.|Number}}40.<ref name=\"interview1\">{{cite web|author=Harold Faltermeyer|title=Flood Of Memory: The Summer Reign On Sunset Blvd|url=http://Daeida.com|accessdate=May 13, 2014}}</ref> Summer was nominated for [[Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] for \"Cold Love\", and [[Best Inspirational Performance]] for \"[[The Wanderer (Donna Summer album)|I Believe in Jesus]]\" at the 1981 Grammy Awards.\n\nShe would soon be working on her next album. It was to be another double album set. When David Geffen stopped by the studio for a preview, he was warned that it was a work in progress, but it was almost done. That was a mistake, because only a few tracks had been finished, and most of them were in demo phase. He heard enough to tell producers that it was not good enough; the project was canceled. It would be released years later in 1996, under the title ''[[I'm a Rainbow]]''.<ref name=\"interview1\"/> Over the years, a few of the tracks would be released. The song \"Highway Runner\" appears on the soundtrack for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. \"Romeo\" appears on the ''[[Flashdance]]'' soundtrack. Both, \"I'm a Rainbow\" and \"[[Don't Cry For Me Argentina]]\" would be on her 1993 Anthology album.\n\nDavid Geffen hired top R&B and pop producer [[Quincy Jones]] to produce Summer's next album, the eponymously titled ''[[Donna Summer (album)|Donna Summer]]''. The album took over six months to record as Summer, who was pregnant at the time, found it hard to sing. During the recording of the project, [[Neil Bogart]] died of cancer in May 1982 at age 39. Summer would sing at his funeral. The album included the top ten hit \"[[Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger)]]\"; for which she received a Grammy nomination for [[Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]]. Summer was also nominated for [[Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] for \"[[Protection (Donna Summer song)|Protection]]\", penned for her by [[Bruce Springsteen]]. Other singles included a cover of the [[Jon and Vangelis]] song \"[[State of Independence]]\" ({{abbr|No.|Number}} 41 pop) and \"[[The Woman in Me (Donna Summer song)|The Woman in Me]]\" (No. 33 pop).\n\nBy then [[Geffen Records]] was notified by [[Polygram Records]], who now owned Casablanca, that Summer still needed to deliver them one more album to fulfill her contract with them. Summer had her biggest success in the 1980s while on Geffen's roster with her next album ''[[She Works Hard for the Money (album)|She Works Hard for the Money]]'' and its [[She Works Hard for the Money|title song]] \u2014 which were released by [[Mercury Records]] in a one-off arrangement to settle Summer's split with the soon-to-be-defunct Casablanca Records, whose catalogue now resided with Mercury and Casablanca's parent company [[PolyGram]].\n\nSummer recorded and delivered the album ''[[She Works Hard for the Money (album)|She Works Hard for the Money]]'' and Polygram released it on its [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] imprint in 1983. The title song became a major hit, reaching {{abbr|No.|Number}} 3 on the US Hot 100, as well as No. 1 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s R&B chart for three weeks. It also garnered Summer another Grammy nomination, for [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]. \"[[Unconditional Love (Donna Summer song)|Unconditional Love]]\", which featured the British group [[Musical Youth]], and \"[[Love Has a Mind of Its Own]]\" did not crack the top 40. The album itself was certified Gold, and climbed to {{abbr|No.|Number}} 9 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart; the highest chart position of any female artist in male-dominated 1983. The song \"[[He's a Rebel (Donna Summer song)|He's a Rebel]]\" would win Summer her third Grammy Award, this time for [[Best Inspirational Performance]].\n\nBritish director [[Brian Grant (director)|Brian Grant]] was hired to direct Summer's video for \"[[She Works Hard for the Money]]\". The video was a success, being nominated for Best Female Video and Best Choreography at the [[1984 MTV Video Music Awards|1984 MTV Music Video Awards]]; Summer became one of the first African-American artists, and the first African-American female artist to have her video played in ''heavy rotation'' on [[MTV]]. [[Brian Grant (director)|Grant]] would also be hired to direct Summer's Costa Mesa [[HBO]] concert special, ''A Hot Summers Night''. [[Brian Grant (director)|Grant]] who was a fan of the song [[State of Independence]] had an idea for a grand finale. He wanted a large chorus of children to join Summer on stage at the ending of the song. His team looked for local school children in Orange County, to create a chorus of 500 students. On the final day of rehearsals, the kids turned up and they had a full rehearsal.  According to [[Brian Grant (director)|Grant]], \"It looked and sounded amazing. It was a very emotional, very tearful experience for everyone who was there.\" He thought if this was that kind of reaction in rehearsal, then what an impact it would have in the concert. After the rehearsal [[Brian Grant (director)|Grant]] was informed that he could not use the kids because the concert would end after 10 pm; children could not be licensed to be on stage at such a late hour (California had strict child labor laws in 1983). \"It's a moment that I regret immensely: a grand finale concept I came up with that couldn't be filmed in the end\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Brian Grant/Directing A Diva (Donna Summer)|first=David|last=St. Mark|work=Daeida Magazine|date=February 2013|pages=12\u201316}}</ref> When the final sequence was filmed, Summer's daughter Mimi and her family members joined her on stage for \"[[State of Independence]]\".\n\nIn late 1983, David Geffen enlisted ''She Works Hard for the Money'''s producer [[Michael Omartian]] to produce ''[[Cats Without Claws]]''. Summer was happy that Geffen and his executives stayed out of the studio during the recording and thanked him in the album's liner notes, but her request for the lead single would be rejected. The album failed to attain Gold status in the U.S., her first album not to do so.<ref name=\"robio\">{{cite web |url=http://rogallery.com/Summer_Donna/Summer-biography.html |title=Donna Summer Biography |work=Rogallery |accessdate=June 13, 2014}}</ref> It was first album not to yield a top ten hit, since 1977's ''[[Once Upon a Time (Donna Summer album)|Once Upon a Time]]''.

He decided to reach out to Summer and, although she was not interested in singing the song, she was very much interested in working with Faltermeyer again. After a meeting with [[David Geffen]] he was on board with the project. Summer's main objective for the album was that it have stronger R&B influences; Faltermeyer who had just finished doing the soundtracks to ''[[Top Gun]]'' and ''[[Fletch (film)|Fletch]]'', was after a tough FM-oriented sound. On completion, Geffen liked what he heard, but his executives did not think there were enough songs that could be deemed singles. They wanted Faltermeyer to produce \"[[Dinner with Gershwin]]\", but he was already busy with another project, so another producer was found. They also substituted a previous recording called \"[[All Systems Go (Donna Summer album)|Bad Reputation]]\", songs like \"[[All Systems Go (Donna Summer album)|Fascination]]\", fell by the wayside. Geffen had shared the vision of moving Summer into the R&B market as a veteran artist, but these expectations were not met. Faltermeyer, in a 2012 interview with ''Daeida Magazine'', said, \"She was an older artist by then and the label's priority may have been on the youth market. The decision was made afterward by executives who were looking for a radio hit for 1987 and not something that would perhaps last beyond then.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Harold Faltermeyer Flood of memory: The Summer reign on Sunset Blvd|first=David|last=St. Mark|work=Daeida.com|date=October 2012|pages=13\u201328}}</ref> The label's President Ed Rosenblatt would later admit: \"The company never intended to focus on established superstars\".<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 16, 1989|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-16/entertainment/ca-2322_1_ed-rosenblatt-geffen-records-atlantic-records|title=Donna Summer: New Label, New Hit?|first=Paul|last=Grein|accessdate=June 13, 2014}}</ref> The album ''[[All Systems Go (Donna Summer album)|All Systems Go]]'', did not achieve Gold status.

The \"SAW\" team describe the working experience as a labour of love, and said it was their favourite album of all that they had recorded. Geffen decided not to release the album ''[[Another Place and Time]]'', and Summer and [[Geffen Records]] parted ways in 1988. The album was released in Europe in March 1989 on [[Warner Bros.

The television network started changing the premise of the show, making it less funny, says Sudano, \"And because we were an interracial couple, they didn't want us to be married anymore\".

Joining a touring version of the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', she left New York and spent several years living, acting and singing in Europe, where she met music producers [[Giorgio Moroder]] and [[Pete Bellotte]] in Munich, where they recorded influential disco hits such as \"[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You Baby]]\" and \"[[I Feel Love]]\", marking her breakthrough into an international career.

She claimed a top 40 hit every year between 1975 and 1984, and from her first top-ten hit in 1976, to the end of 1982, she had 12 top-ten hits (10 were top-five hits), more than any other act during that time period. She returned to the Hot 100's top-five in 1983, and claimed her final top-ten hit in 1989 with \"[[This Time I Know It's for Real]]\". She was the first artist to have three consecutive double albums reach number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and charted four number-one singles in the US within a 12-month period.

The trio forged a working partnership, and Donna was signed to their Oasis label in 1974. A demo tape of Summer's work with Moroder and Bellotte led to a deal with the European-distributed label Groovy Records. Due to an error on the record cover, Donna Sommer became Donna Summer; the name stuck. Summer's first album was ''[[Lady of the Night (album)|Lady of the Night]]''. It became a hit in the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and Belgium on the strength of two songs, \"[[The Hostage (song)|The Hostage]]\" and the title track \"Lady of the Night\". \"[[The Hostage (song)|The Hostage]]\" reached the top of the charts in France, but was removed from radio playlists in Germany because of the song's subject matter; a high ranking politician that had recently been kidnapped and held for ransom.<ref name=\"CLbio\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.classicbands.com/summer.html |title=Donna Summer |publisher=Classicbands.com |accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref> One of her first TV appearances was in the television show, ''[[Van Oekel's Discohoek]]'', which started the breakthrough of \"[[The Hostage (song)|The Hostage]]\", and in which she gracefully went along with the scripted absurdity and chaos in the show.\n\nIn 1975, Summer passed on an idea for a song to Moroder who was working with another artist; a song that would be called \"[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You]]\". Summer and [[Giorgio Moroder|Moroder]] wrote the song together, and together they worked on a demo version with Summer singing the song. [[Giorgio Moroder|Moroder]] decided that Summer's version should be released. Seeking an American release for the song, it was sent to [[Casablanca Records]] president [[Neil Bogart]]. Bogart played the song at one of his extravagant industry parties, where it was so popular with the crowd, they insisted that it be played over and over, each time it ended. Bogart requested that Moroder produce a longer version for discoth\u00e8ques. Moroder, [[Pete Bellotte|Bellotte]], and Summer returned with a 17-minute version. Bogart tweaked the title to \"[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You Baby]]\", and [[Casablanca Records|Casablanca]] signed Summer, releasing the single in November 1975. The shorter 7\" version of the single was promoted by radio stations, while clubs regularly played the 17 minute version (the longer version would also appear on the album).\n\nBy early 1976, \"Love to Love You Baby\" had reached No. 2 on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart and had become a Gold single, while the album had sold over a million copies. The song generated controversy due to Summer's moans and groans, and some American stations, like those in Europe with the initial release, refused to play it.<ref name=\"telegraph2\"/>  Despite this, \"Love to Love You Baby\" found chart success in several European countries, and made the Top 5 in the United Kingdom despite the BBC ban. Casablanca wasted no time releasing the album ''[[A Love Trilogy]]'', featuring \"[[Try Me, I Know We Can Make It]]\" No. 80 and Summer's remarkable rendition of [[Barry Manilow]]'s \"[[Could It Be Magic]]\" No. 52, which was followed by ''[[Four Seasons of Love]]'', which spawned the singles \"[[Spring Affair]]\" No. 58 and \"[[Winter Melody]]\", No. 43. Both albums went Gold.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn 1977, Summer released the concept album ''[[I Remember Yesterday]]''. The song \"[[I Feel Love]]\", reached No. 6 on the Hot 100 chart. and No. 1 in the UK. She received her first [[American Music Award]] nomination for Favorite Soul/R&B Female Artist. The single would attain Gold status and the album went Platinum in the U.S. Another concept album, also released in 1977, was ''[[Once Upon a Time (Donna Summer album)|Once Upon a Time]]'', a double album which told of a modern-day [[Cinderella]] \"rags to riches\" story. This album would attain Gold status. Summer recorded the song \"[[Down Deep Inside]]\" as the theme song for the 1977 film ''[[The Deep (1977 film)|The Deep]]''. In 1978, Summer acted in the film ''[[Thank God It's Friday (film)|Thank God It's Friday]]'', the film met with modest success; the song \"[[Last Dance (Donna Summer song)|Last Dance]]\", reached No. 3 on the Hot 100. The soundtrack and single both went Gold and resulted in Summer winning her first [[Grammy Award]], for [[Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]]. Its writer, [[Paul Jabara]], won both an [[Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] for the composition. Summer also had \"[[With Your Love]]\" and \"[[Je t'aime... moi non plus#Covers|Je t'aime... moi non plus]]\", on the soundtrack. Her version of the [[Jimmy Webb]] ballad, \"[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]\", became her first No. 1 hit on the Hot 100 chart. It was also the only No. 1 hit for songwriter Jimmy Webb; the single went Gold and topped the charts for three weeks. She received a Grammy nomination for [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]. The song was featured on Summer's first live album, ''[[Live and More]]'', which also became her first album to hit number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and went double-Platinum, selling over 2 million copies.

Summer performed at the world-televised [[Music for UNICEF Concert]], joining contemporaries such as [[ABBA]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], the [[Bee Gees]], [[Andy Gibb]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[John Denver]], [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], [[Rita Coolidge]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]] for a TV special that raised funds and awareness for the world's children. Artists donated royalties of certain songs, some in perpetuity, to benefit the cause. Summer began work on her next project with Moroder and Bellotte, ''[[Bad Girls (Donna Summer album)|Bad Girls]]''. [[Giorgio Moroder|Mororder]] brought in [[Harold Faltermeyer]], with whom he had collaborated on the soundtrack of film ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]'', to be the album's arranger. Faltermeyer's role would significantly increase from arranger, as he played keyboards and wrote songs with Summer.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe album went triple-Platinum, spawning the number-one hits \"[[Hot Stuff (Donna Summer song)|Hot Stuff]]\" and \"[[Bad Girls (Donna Summer song)|Bad Girls]]\", that went Platinum, and the number-two  \"[[Dim All the Lights]]\" which went Gold. The week of June 16, 1979, Summer would again have the number-one single on the Hot 100 chart, and the number-one album on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart; when \"Hot Stuff\" regained the top spot on the Hot 100 chart.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1979-06-16 |title=Billboard Hot 100 |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=16 June 1979 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref> The following week, \"[[Bad Girls (Donna Summer song)|Bad Girls]]\" would be on top of the U.S. [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|Top R&B albums chart]], \"Hot Stuff\" remained at No. 1, and \"Bad Girls\", the single, would climb into the top five on the Hot 100. The following week, Summer was the first solo artist to have two songs in the Hot 100 top three at the same time. In July 1979, Summer topped the Hot 100 singles chart, and the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart, and the Soul singles chart simultaneously. In the week of November 10, 1979, \"Dim All the Lights\" peaked at No. 2 for two weeks; the following week \"[[No More Tears (Enough is Enough)]]\" would get to No. 3; and once again Summer would have two songs in the top 3, on the Hot 100. One week later, \"No More Tears\" climbed to No. 1 spot on the Hot 100 chart, and \"Dim All the Lights\" went to No. 4; she again had two songs in the top 5 of the Hot 100 chart. In the span of eight months, Summer had topped both the singles and albums charts simultaneously, three times. She became the first Female Artist to have three number-one singles in a calendar year. With \"Mac Arthur Park\", \"Hot Stuff\", \"Bad Girls\", and the [[Barbra Streisand]]-duet \"No More Tears (Enough is Enough)\", Summer achieved four number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart within a 12-month period. Including \"Heaven Knows\" and \"Dim All the Lights\" she had achieved six top 4 singles on the Hot 100 chart in the same 12-month period. Those songs, along with \"Last Dance\", \"[[On the Radio (Donna Summer song)|On the Radio]]\", and \"[[The Wanderer (Donna Summer song)|The Wanderer]]\", would give her nine Top 5 singles on the Hot 100 chart in just over a two-year period. The single, \"No More Tears (Enough is Enough)\" would sell over 2 million copies becoming a Platinum success. \"Hot Stuff\" won her a Grammy Award in the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]], the first time the category was included. She was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] and both [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] and [[Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]], as well as [[Best Disco Recording]]. That year, Summer played eight sold-out nights at the [[Universal Amphitheater]] in Los Angeles.\n\nCasablanca then released ''[[On the Radio: Greatest Hits Volumes I & II]]'', her first (international) greatest hits set, in 1979. The album was mixed differently than the original songs issued on it, with each song segueing into the next, and included two new songs \"On the Radio\" and \"No More Tears (Enough is Enough)\". It would be the first time that such an album package would be made. The album went No. 1, her third consecutive No. 1 album on the ''Billboard'' 200, and gained double-Platinum status. \"On the Radio\", reached No. 5, selling over a million copies in the U.S. alone, making it a Gold single. Summer would again receive a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]].\n\n===1980\u20131985===\nSummer received four nominations for the [[American Music Awards of 1980|7th Annual American Music Awards]] in January 1980, and took home awards for Female Pop/Rock and Female Soul/R&B Artist; and well as Pop/Rock single for \"[[Bad Girls (Donna Summer song)|Bad Girls]]\". Just over a week after the awards, Summer had her own nationally televised special, ''[[The Donna Summer Special]]'',<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/tv/show/46047/Donna-Summer-Special/overview|title=The Donna Summer Special|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> which aired on ABC network on January 27, 1980. After the release of the ''[[On the Radio (Donna Summer song)|On the Radio]]'' album, Summer wanted to branch out into other musical styles, which led to tensions between her and [[Casablanca Records]]. [[Casablanca Records|Casablanca]] wanted her to continue to record disco only. Summer was upset with President [[Neil Bogart]] over the early release of the single \"[[No More Tears (Enough is Enough)]]\"; she had penned \"[[Dim All the Lights]]\" alone, and was hoping for a number-one hit as a songwriter. Not waiting until \"Dim All the Lights\" had peaked, or at least another month as promised; Summer felt it had detracted from the singles chart momentum. Summer and the label parted ways in 1980, and she signed with [[Geffen Records]], the new label started by [[David Geffen]]. Summer had filed a 10-million-dollar suit against [[Casablanca Records|Casablanca]]; the label counter-sued. In the end, she did not receive any money, but won the rights to her own lucrative song publishing.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3554408/Donna-Summer-too-hot-to-handle.html |title=Donna Summer: too hot to handle |newspaper=Telegraph |date=June 13, 2008 |accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSummer's first Geffen album, ''[[The Wanderer (Donna Summer album)|The Wanderer]]'', featured an eclectic mixture of sounds, bringing elements of [[rock music|rock]], [[rockabilly]], [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[gospel music]]. ''The Wanderer'' was rushed to market. The producers of the album wanted more production time. The album continued Summer's streak of Gold albums with the [[The Wanderer (Donna Summer song)|title track]] peaking at {{abbr|No.|Number}} 3 on the Hot 100 chart. Its follow-up singles were, \"[[Cold Love]]\" {{abbr|No.|Number}}33 and \"[[Who Do You Think You're Foolin']]\", {{abbr|No.|Number}}40.<ref name=\"interview1\">{{cite web|author=Harold Faltermeyer|title=Flood Of Memory: The Summer Reign On Sunset Blvd|url=http://Daeida.com|accessdate=May 13, 2014}}</ref> Summer was nominated for [[Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] for \"Cold Love\", and [[Best Inspirational Performance]] for \"[[The Wanderer (Donna Summer album)|I Believe in Jesus]]\" at the 1981 Grammy Awards.\n\nShe would soon be working on her next album. It was to be another double album set. When David Geffen stopped by the studio for a preview, he was warned that it was a work in progress, but it was almost done. That was a mistake, because only a few tracks had been finished, and most of them were in demo phase. He heard enough to tell producers that it was not good enough; the project was canceled. It would be released years later in 1996, under the title ''[[I'm a Rainbow]]''.<ref name=\"interview1\"/> Over the years, a few of the tracks would be released. The song \"Highway Runner\" appears on the soundtrack for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. \"Romeo\" appears on the ''[[Flashdance]]'' soundtrack. Both, \"I'm a Rainbow\" and \"[[Don't Cry For Me Argentina]]\" would be on her 1993 Anthology album.\n\nDavid Geffen hired top R&B and pop producer [[Quincy Jones]] to produce Summer's next album, the eponymously titled ''[[Donna Summer (album)|Donna Summer]]''. The album took over six months to record as Summer, who was pregnant at the time, found it hard to sing. During the recording of the project, [[Neil Bogart]] died of cancer in May 1982 at age 39. Summer would sing at his funeral. The album included the top ten hit \"[[Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger)]]\"; for which she received a Grammy nomination for [[Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]]. Summer was also nominated for [[Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] for \"[[Protection (Donna Summer song)|Protection]]\", penned for her by [[Bruce Springsteen]]. Other singles included a cover of the [[Jon and Vangelis]] song \"[[State of Independence]]\" ({{abbr|No.|Number}} 41 pop) and \"[[The Woman in Me (Donna Summer song)|The Woman in Me]]\" (No. 33 pop).\n\nBy then [[Geffen Records]] was notified by [[Polygram Records]], who now owned Casablanca, that Summer still needed to deliver them one more album to fulfill her contract with them. Summer had her biggest success in the 1980s while on Geffen's roster with her next album ''[[She Works Hard for the Money (album)|She Works Hard for the Money]]'' and its [[She Works Hard for the Money|title song]] \u2014 which were released by [[Mercury Records]] in a one-off arrangement to settle Summer's split with the soon-to-be-defunct Casablanca Records, whose catalogue now resided with Mercury and Casablanca's parent company [[PolyGram]].\n\nSummer recorded and delivered the album ''[[She Works Hard for the Money (album)|She Works Hard for the Money]]'' and Polygram released it on its [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] imprint in 1983. The title song became a major hit, reaching {{abbr|No.|Number}} 3 on the US Hot 100, as well as No. 1 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s R&B chart for three weeks. It also garnered Summer another Grammy nomination, for [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]. \"[[Unconditional Love (Donna Summer song)|Unconditional Love]]\", which featured the British group [[Musical Youth]], and \"[[Love Has a Mind of Its Own]]\" did not crack the top 40. The album itself was certified Gold, and climbed to {{abbr|No.|Number}} 9 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart; the highest chart position of any female artist in male-dominated 1983. The song \"[[He's a Rebel (Donna Summer song)|He's a Rebel]]\" would win Summer her third Grammy Award, this time for [[Best Inspirational Performance]].\n\nBritish director [[Brian Grant (director)|Brian Grant]] was hired to direct Summer's video for \"[[She Works Hard for the Money]]\". The video was a success, being nominated for Best Female Video and Best Choreography at the [[1984 MTV Video Music Awards|1984 MTV Music Video Awards]]; Summer became one of the first African-American artists, and the first African-American female artist to have her video played in ''heavy rotation'' on [[MTV]]. [[Brian Grant (director)|Grant]] would also be hired to direct Summer's Costa Mesa [[HBO]] concert special, ''A Hot Summers Night''. [[Brian Grant (director)|Grant]] who was a fan of the song [[State of Independence]] had an idea for a grand finale. He wanted a large chorus of children to join Summer on stage at the ending of the song. His team looked for local school children in Orange County, to create a chorus of 500 students. On the final day of rehearsals, the kids turned up and they had a full rehearsal.  According to [[Brian Grant (director)|Grant]], \"It looked and sounded amazing. It was a very emotional, very tearful experience for everyone who was there.\" He thought if this was that kind of reaction in rehearsal, then what an impact it would have in the concert. After the rehearsal [[Brian Grant (director)|Grant]] was informed that he could not use the kids because the concert would end after 10 pm; children could not be licensed to be on stage at such a late hour (California had strict child labor laws in 1983). \"It's a moment that I regret immensely: a grand finale concept I came up with that couldn't be filmed in the end\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Brian Grant/Directing A Diva (Donna Summer)|first=David|last=St. Mark|work=Daeida Magazine|date=February 2013|pages=12\u201316}}</ref> When the final sequence was filmed, Summer's daughter Mimi and her family members joined her on stage for \"[[State of Independence]]\".\n\nIn late 1983, David Geffen enlisted ''She Works Hard for the Money'''s producer [[Michael Omartian]] to produce ''[[Cats Without Claws]]''. Summer was happy that Geffen and his executives stayed out of the studio during the recording and thanked him in the album's liner notes, but her request for the lead single would be rejected.

He decided to reach out to Summer and, although she was not interested in singing the song, she was very much interested in working with Faltermeyer again. After a meeting with [[David Geffen]] he was on board with the project. Summer's main objective for the album was that it have stronger R&B influences; Faltermeyer who had just finished doing the soundtracks to ''[[Top Gun]]'' and ''[[Fletch (film)|Fletch]]'', was after a tough FM-oriented sound. On completion, Geffen liked what he heard, but his executives did not think there were enough songs that could be deemed singles. They wanted Faltermeyer to produce \"[[Dinner with Gershwin]]\", but he was already busy with another project, so another producer was found. They also substituted a previous recording called \"[[All Systems Go (Donna Summer album)|Bad Reputation]]\", songs like \"[[All Systems Go (Donna Summer album)|Fascination]]\", fell by the wayside. Geffen had shared the vision of moving Summer into the R&B market as a veteran artist, but these expectations were not met. Faltermeyer, in a 2012 interview with ''Daeida Magazine'', said, \"She was an older artist by then and the label's priority may have been on the youth market. The decision was made afterward by executives who were looking for a radio hit for 1987 and not something that would perhaps last beyond then.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Harold Faltermeyer Flood of memory: The Summer reign on Sunset Blvd|first=David|last=St. Mark|work=Daeida.com|date=October 2012|pages=13\u201328}}</ref> The label's President Ed Rosenblatt would later admit: \"The company never intended to focus on established superstars\".<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 16, 1989|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-16/entertainment/ca-2322_1_ed-rosenblatt-geffen-records-atlantic-records|title=Donna Summer: New Label, New Hit?|first=Paul|last=Grein|accessdate=June 13, 2014}}</ref> The album ''[[All Systems Go (Donna Summer album)|All Systems Go]]'', did not achieve Gold status.

She became a cultural icon and her prominence on the dance charts, for which she was referred to as the Queen of Disco, made her not just one of the defining voices of that era, but also an influence on pop artists from Madonna to Beyonc\u00e9. Unlike some other stars of disco who faded as the music became less popular in the early 1980s, Summer was able to grow beyond the genre and segued to a pop-rock sound. She had one of her biggest hits in the 1980s with \"She Works Hard For the Money\", which became another anthem, this time for [[women's rights]]. Summer was the first black woman to be nominated for an MTV Video Music Award. Summer remained a force on the ''Billboard'' Dance/Club Play Songs chart throughout her career and notched 19 number one singles. Her last studio album, 2008's ''Crayons'', spun off three No. 1 dance/club hits with \"[[I'm a Fire]]\", \"[[Stamp Your Feet]]\" and \"[[Fame (The Game)]]\".

The traction battery of the first generation Prius update (2000 onwards) was a [[seal (mechanical)|sealed]] 38-module [[nickel metal hydride]] (NiMH) [[rechargeable battery|battery]] pack providing 273.6 volt, 6.5&nbsp;Ah capacity and weighing {{convert|53.3|kg|lb|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"cgcc\">{{cite web |title=Toyota Prius II Battery Pack |publisher=The Clean Green Car Company |url=http://www.cleangreencar.co.nz/page/prius-battery-pack |accessdate=2008-05-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225234612/http://www.cleangreencar.co.nz/page/prius-battery-pack |archivedate=2008-02-25}}</ref> and is supplied by Japan's [[Panasonic EV Energy Co]]. They are normally charged between 40\u201360% of maximum capacity to prolong battery life as well as allow headroom for [[regenerative braking]]. Each battery pack uses {{convert|10|-|15|kg|abbr=on|0}} of [[lanthanum]], and each Prius electric motor contains {{convert|1|kg|abbr=on|0}} of [[neodymium]]; production of the car is described as \"the biggest user of [[Rare earth element|rare earths]] of any object in the world.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/08/31/us-mining-toyota-idUSTRE57U02B20090831 |title=As hybrid cars gobble rare metals, shortage looms |date=2009-08-31 |first=Steve |last=Gorman |agency=Reuters |accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> The LV battery is essential to starting the car and providing initial power to the computer.\n\nThe Second Generation Prius contains a 1.310&nbsp;kWh battery, composed of 28 modules. Each battery module is made of 6 individual 1.2&nbsp;V 6.5&nbsp;Ah Prismatic NiMH cells in series forming a 7.2&nbsp;V 6.5&nbsp;Ah module with 46&nbsp;Wh/kg energy density and 1.3&nbsp;kW/kg output power density.<ref>{{cite web |title=Battery Module NP2 |publisher=Primearth EV Energy Co., Ltd. |url=http://www.peve.jp/en/product/np2/index.html |accessdate=2015-07-12}}</ref> Each module contains an integrated charge controller and relay. These modules are connected 28 in series to form a 201.6&nbsp;V 6.5&nbsp;Ah battery (traction battery), also known as the energy storage system. The computer-controlled charge controller and battery management computer systems keep this battery between 38% and 82% state of charge, with a tendency to keep the average state of charge around 60%. By shallow cycling the battery, only a small portion of its net available energy storage capacity is available for use (approximately 400&nbsp;Wh) by the hybrid drive system, but the shallow computer-controlled cycling dramatically improves the cycle life, thermal management control, and net long term calendar life of the battery. Active cooling of this battery is achieved by a blower motor and air ducting, while passive thermal management was accomplished through the metal case design.\n\n=== Battery life cycle ===\nAs the Prius reached ten years of being available in the US market, in February 2011 ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' examined the lifetime and replacement cost of the Prius battery. The magazine tested a 2002 Toyota Prius with over 200,000 miles on it and compared the results to the nearly identical 2001 Prius with 2,000 miles tested by ''Consumer Reports'' 10 years before. The comparison showed little difference in performance when tested for fuel economy and acceleration. Overall [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] of the 2001 model was {{Convert|40.6|mpgus}} while the 2002 Prius with high mileage delivered {{Convert|40.4|mpgus}}. The magazine concluded that the effectiveness of the battery has not degraded over the long run.<ref name=CR2011>{{cite news |url=http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2011/02/200000-mile-toyota-prius-still-performs.html |title=The 200,000-mile question: How does the Toyota Prius hold up? |first=Jake |last=Fisher |publisher=[[Consumer Reports]] |date=2011-02-16 |accessdate=2011-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220062651/http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2011/02/200000-mile-toyota-prius-still-performs.html |archivedate=2011-02-20}}</ref> The cost of replacing the first generation battery varies between {{USD|2,200}} and {{USD|2,600}} from a Toyota dealer, but low-use units from salvage yards are available for around {{USD|500}}.<ref name=CR2011/> One study indicates it may be worthwhile to rebuild batteries using good blades from defective used batteries.<ref name=PriusBattRebuild>{{cite document |title=Failure analysis of some Toyota Prius battery packs and potential for recovery |work=Waikato University Research Commons |last1=Leijen |first1=Peter |last2=Scott |first2=Jonathan|hdl=10289/5714 }}</ref>\n\n=== Air conditioning (HVAC) ===\nThe [[HVAC]] system uses an AC [[induction motor]] to drive a sealed-system [[scroll compressor]], a design principle not usually used in automotive applications. Using a scroll compressor increases the efficiency of the system while driving it with an AC induction motor makes the system more flexible, so the [[Automobile air conditioning|AC]] can run while the engine is off. Because the oil used with the refrigerant gas also flows in the area of the high-voltage motor-windings, the fluid must be electrically insulating to avoid transmitting electric current to exposed metal parts of the system. Therefore, Toyota specifies a [[polyolester]] (POE) oil (designated ND11)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hecatinc.com/ToolsTechnologyAprMay09.pdf |title=Hybrid A/C Repair |publisher=ToolingUp |first=Craig |last=Van Batenburg |date=2009-04-01 |accessdate=2009-04-01}}</ref> is required for repairs. The system cannot be serviced with equipment normally employed for regular cars, which typically use polyalkylene glycol (PAG) oil, as the equipment would contaminate the ND11 oil with PAG oil. According to SAE J2843, the oil provided from maintenance equipment must contain less than 0.1% PAG when filling. One percent PAG oil may result in an electrical resistance drop by a factor of about 10.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hybrid vehicle air conditioning service |url=http://www.autoserviceprofessional.com/article/93187/Hybrid-vehicle-air-conditioning-service?Page=3 |publisher=Auto Service Professional |first=Mike |last=Mavrigian |date=2013-04-10 |accessdate=2013-04-10}}</ref>\n\n== Environmental impact ==\n\n=== Fuel economy and emissions ===\n;United States\n<!--This section is work in progress.

The two principal crops used are [[kenaf]] and [[China grass|ramie]]. Kenaf is a member of the [[Malvaceae|hibiscus family]], a relative to cotton and okra; ramie, commonly known as China grass, is a member of the [[Urticaceae|nettle family]] and one of the strongest natural fibres, with a density and absorbency comparable to [[flax]]. Toyota says this is a particularly timely breakthrough for plant-based eco-plastics because 2009 is the United Nations' International Year of Natural Fibres, which spotlights kenaf and ramie among others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/519B837DC4814BBECA257598000719BD |title=Goauto.com.au |publisher=Go auto |date=2009-04-14 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\n\nAt its introduction in 2009, it won the [[Car of the Year Japan]] Award for the second time.

The traction battery of the first generation Prius update (2000 onwards) was a [[seal (mechanical)|sealed]] 38-module [[nickel metal hydride]] (NiMH) [[rechargeable battery|battery]] pack providing 273.6 volt, 6.5&nbsp;Ah capacity and weighing {{convert|53.3|kg|lb|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"cgcc\">{{cite web |title=Toyota Prius II Battery Pack |publisher=The Clean Green Car Company |url=http://www.cleangreencar.co.nz/page/prius-battery-pack |accessdate=2008-05-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225234612/http://www.cleangreencar.co.nz/page/prius-battery-pack |archivedate=2008-02-25}}</ref> and is supplied by Japan's [[Panasonic EV Energy Co]]. They are normally charged between 40\u201360% of maximum capacity to prolong battery life as well as allow headroom for [[regenerative braking]]. Each battery pack uses {{convert|10|-|15|kg|abbr=on|0}} of [[lanthanum]], and each Prius electric motor contains {{convert|1|kg|abbr=on|0}} of [[neodymium]]; production of the car is described as \"the biggest user of [[Rare earth element|rare earths]] of any object in the world.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/08/31/us-mining-toyota-idUSTRE57U02B20090831 |title=As hybrid cars gobble rare metals, shortage looms |date=2009-08-31 |first=Steve |last=Gorman |agency=Reuters |accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> The LV battery is essential to starting the car and providing initial power to the computer.\n\nThe Second Generation Prius contains a 1.310&nbsp;kWh battery, composed of 28 modules. Each battery module is made of 6 individual 1.2&nbsp;V 6.5&nbsp;Ah Prismatic NiMH cells in series forming a 7.2&nbsp;V 6.5&nbsp;Ah module with 46&nbsp;Wh/kg energy density and 1.3&nbsp;kW/kg output power density.<ref>{{cite web |title=Battery Module NP2 |publisher=Primearth EV Energy Co., Ltd. |url=http://www.peve.jp/en/product/np2/index.html |accessdate=2015-07-12}}</ref> Each module contains an integrated charge controller and relay. These modules are connected 28 in series to form a 201.6&nbsp;V 6.5&nbsp;Ah battery (traction battery), also known as the energy storage system. The computer-controlled charge controller and battery management computer systems keep this battery between 38% and 82% state of charge, with a tendency to keep the average state of charge around 60%. By shallow cycling the battery, only a small portion of its net available energy storage capacity is available for use (approximately 400&nbsp;Wh) by the hybrid drive system, but the shallow computer-controlled cycling dramatically improves the cycle life, thermal management control, and net long term calendar life of the battery. Active cooling of this battery is achieved by a blower motor and air ducting, while passive thermal management was accomplished through the metal case design.\n\n=== Battery life cycle ===\nAs the Prius reached ten years of being available in the US market, in February 2011 ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' examined the lifetime and replacement cost of the Prius battery. The magazine tested a 2002 Toyota Prius with over 200,000 miles on it and compared the results to the nearly identical 2001 Prius with 2,000 miles tested by ''Consumer Reports'' 10 years before. The comparison showed little difference in performance when tested for fuel economy and acceleration. Overall [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] of the 2001 model was {{Convert|40.6|mpgus}} while the 2002 Prius with high mileage delivered {{Convert|40.4|mpgus}}. The magazine concluded that the effectiveness of the battery has not degraded over the long run.<ref name=CR2011>{{cite news |url=http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2011/02/200000-mile-toyota-prius-still-performs.html |title=The 200,000-mile question: How does the Toyota Prius hold up? |first=Jake |last=Fisher |publisher=[[Consumer Reports]] |date=2011-02-16 |accessdate=2011-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220062651/http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2011/02/200000-mile-toyota-prius-still-performs.html |archivedate=2011-02-20}}</ref> The cost of replacing the first generation battery varies between {{USD|2,200}} and {{USD|2,600}} from a Toyota dealer, but low-use units from salvage yards are available for around {{USD|500}}.<ref name=CR2011/> One study indicates it may be worthwhile to rebuild batteries using good blades from defective used batteries.<ref name=PriusBattRebuild>{{cite document |title=Failure analysis of some Toyota Prius battery packs and potential for recovery |work=Waikato University Research Commons |last1=Leijen |first1=Peter |last2=Scott |first2=Jonathan|hdl=10289/5714 }}</ref>\n\n=== Air conditioning (HVAC) ===\nThe [[HVAC]] system uses an AC [[induction motor]] to drive a sealed-system [[scroll compressor]], a design principle not usually used in automotive applications. Using a scroll compressor increases the efficiency of the system while driving it with an AC induction motor makes the system more flexible, so the [[Automobile air conditioning|AC]] can run while the engine is off. Because the oil used with the refrigerant gas also flows in the area of the high-voltage motor-windings, the fluid must be electrically insulating to avoid transmitting electric current to exposed metal parts of the system. Therefore, Toyota specifies a [[polyolester]] (POE) oil (designated ND11)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hecatinc.com/ToolsTechnologyAprMay09.pdf |title=Hybrid A/C Repair |publisher=ToolingUp |first=Craig |last=Van Batenburg |date=2009-04-01 |accessdate=2009-04-01}}</ref> is required for repairs. The system cannot be serviced with equipment normally employed for regular cars, which typically use polyalkylene glycol (PAG) oil, as the equipment would contaminate the ND11 oil with PAG oil. According to SAE J2843, the oil provided from maintenance equipment must contain less than 0.1% PAG when filling.

The name \"Miami-Illinois\" is a cover term for a cluster of highly similar dialects, the primary ones being Miami proper, ''Peoria'', ''Wea'', ''Piankeshaw'', and, in the older [[Jesuit missions in North America|Jesuit records]], ''Illinois''. <ref>\"Miami-Illinois.\" Catalogue of Endangered Languages. 2020. University of Hawaii at Manoa. Apr. 29, 2020. http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/1924 </ref> About half of the surviving several hundred speakers were displaced in the 19th century from their territories, eventually settling in northeastern [[Oklahoma]] as the Miami and the Peoria. The remainder of the Miami stayed behind in northern [[Indiana]].\n\nThe language was documented in written materials for over 200 years. [[Jacques Gravier]], a Jesuit [[missionary]] who lived among the Kaskaskia tribe in the early 18th century, compiled an extensive and detailed Kaskaskia\u2013French dictionary. Based on an analysis of its handwriting, it appears to have been transcribed by his assistant, [[Jacques Largillier]].\n\nGravier's dictionary contains nearly 600 pages and 20,000 entries. It is the \"most extensive of several manuscripts\" which French missionaries made of the Illinois languages.<ref name=\"oxfordjournals2002\">[http://ijl.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/17/3/325  \"Review\" of Carl Masthay, ''Kaskaskia Illinois-to-French Dictionary''], Saint Louis: Carl Masthay, 2002, ''International Journal of Lexicography'', 17(3):325\u2013327, Retrieved 2010-3-1</ref>  The original document is held by [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Illinois were subject to extermination by hostile tribes, as well as encroachment by European settlers.  The French abandoned the Kaskaskia mission.\n\nEventually the surviving Illinois speakers went to the [[Indian Territory]], later [[Oklahoma]] where the group became known as the Peoria. All of the [[Wea]] and [[Piankashaw]] were also forcibly relocated to Oklahoma, where they merged with the [[Peoria tribe|Peoria]]. About half the Miami proper remained in historic territory of present-day Indiana, the other half also being relocated to Oklahoma, eventually settling next to the Peoria. Because of the decline among the number of Miami-Illinois speakers, the language was not studied as extensively as many other Algonquian languages. It was not until 2002 that the manuscript was edited and published by Carl Masthay.<ref name=\"oxfordjournals2002\"/>\n\n==Phonology==\nThere is an extensive amount of data on the Miami-Illinois language. The problem with much of the data collected is that little of it was collected by trained phonologists and thus much of it is incomplete or incorrect. David Costa has written extensively on this language, compiling much of this data and correcting it in his book ''The Miami-Illinois Language''.\n\n===Consonants===\nThe consonants of the Miami-Illinois language are typical to the \"Central Algonquian\" languages. It contains the voiceless stops and affricate p, t, k, t\u0283; voiceless fricatives s, \u0283, h; nasals and liquids m, n, l; and the semivowels w, y.\nThe linguist David Costa (2003) notes that \"the original Proto-Algonquian consonants *p, *t, *k, * t\u0283, *s, *\u0283, *h, *m, *n, *w, *j remain largely unchanged.\"<ref name=\"Historical Phonology\">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3519724 \"Historical Phonology of Miami Illinois Consonants], Chicago: David Costa, 1991, ''International Journal of American Linguistics'', 57(3):365\u2013393, Retrieved 2011-11-6</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! align=\"center\"|[[labial consonant|Labial]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n!

There are also opposite alternations where {{IPA|/\u0283/}} occurs instead of {{IPA|/s/}}. Examples of both of these alternations seem to most prominently show themselves before the vowel {{IPA|/i/}}. Costa (2003) notes these \"examples of words showing {{IPA|/\u0283/}} for expected {{IPA|/s/}} follow: /apeeh\u0283ia/, /teekwee\u0283ita/, and /neeh\u0283iaani/\" <ref name=\"The Miami-Illinois Language\">Costa, David. 2003. The Miami-Illinois Language . Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press.</ref>\n\n===Vowels===\nMiami-Illinois has four short vowels, {{IPA|/i e a o/}} and four long vowels, {{IPA|/i\u02d0 e\u02d0 a\u02d0 o\u02d0/}}.\nCosta (2003) notes that \"{{IPA|/a/}} is a low non-front vowel however it can also be pronounced as a {{IPA|[\u028c]}} by some speakers. {{IPA|/o/}} is a back round vowel ranging from {{IPA|[o]}} through {{IPA|[\u028a]}} to {{IPA|[u]}}. {{IPA|/e/}} is a non-high front vowel ranging from {{IPA|[\u00e6]}} through {{IPA|[\u025b]}} to {{IPA|[e]}}. Finally, {{IPA|/i/}} is a high front vowel ranging from {{IPA|[\u026a]}} to {{IPA|[i]}}.\" These differences can occur from speaker to speaker and also from word to word.<ref name=\"The Miami-Illinois Language\"/>\n\n====Strong Syllable Rule====\nThe most important rule in the phonology of the vowels of the Miami-Illinois language is the [[Iamb (poetry)#Accentual-syllabic use|iambic metrical]] rule, which is referred to by David Costa (2003) as the strong syllable rule (SSR). Syllables in this language are considered either strong or weak depending on whether they occur in an even or odd numbered spot within the word. Counting from left to right, the even numbered syllables are strong and the odd numbered syllables are weak. However, a long vowel is always considered strong and the syllable count is restarted from this point. Anytime a short vowel comes after a long vowel it will always be weak because the count will have started over and it will occur in an even-numbered syllable.<ref name=\"The Miami-Illinois Language\"/>\n\n====Vowel Devoicing Rule====\nOne important rule for the phonology of Miami-Illinois is called the \"Vowel Devoicing Rule.\" In Miami-Illinois the weak vowels are devoiced any time they occur before a preaspirate. If a short vowel occurs before a preaspirate it will be devoiced if it follows a long vowel. This will also happen if it occurs in an odd-numbered syllable. However, if the vowel is in a strong syllable (or an even-numbered syllable) this rule does not apply. As Costa (2003) states it, \"a vowel in an original second syllable can be devoiced only if a long vowel precedes it, thus rendering the vowel odd-numbered for the syllable count.\" <ref name=\"The Miami-Illinois Language\"/>\n\n====Accents====\nAside from the \"Strong Syllable Rule\" (Costa, 2003), there is separate system of accenting in the Miami-Illinois language. In this rule, the syllable count begins at the end of the word and goes backwards towards the start of it (unlike the Strong Syllable Rule, which begins at the beginning of the word and goes forwards). Vowels in both weak and strong syllable can be accented. It is most common for words in this language to take accents on their penultimate syllables, though if a weak syllable is subject to devoicing, it can not receive an accent. This shows that the devoicing rule comes before the accent rule.<ref name=\"The Miami-Illinois Language\"/>\n\n==Language revitalization ==\nSince the mid-1990s, the [[Miami Tribe of Oklahoma]] has embarked on a [[language revitalization]] program.  Many Miami members have described the language as \"sleeping\" rather than \"extinct\" since it was not irretrievably lost.<ref>Leonard, Wesley Y. (2008). \"When is an 'Extinct Language' not Extinct? Miami, a Formerly Sleeping Language\", in Kendall A.

Based on his extensive studies, he published ''The Miami-Illinois Language'' in 1994 as his Ph.D. dissertation and as a book in 2003. The book reconstructs the Miami-Illinois language and all its grammatical features.

Based on an analysis of its handwriting, it appears to have been transcribed by his assistant, [[Jacques Largillier]].\n\nGravier's dictionary contains nearly 600 pages and 20,000 entries. It is the \"most extensive of several manuscripts\" which French missionaries made of the Illinois languages.<ref name=\"oxfordjournals2002\">[http://ijl.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/17/3/325  \"Review\" of Carl Masthay, ''Kaskaskia Illinois-to-French Dictionary''], Saint Louis: Carl Masthay, 2002, ''International Journal of Lexicography'', 17(3):325\u2013327, Retrieved 2010-3-1</ref>  The original document is held by [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Illinois were subject to extermination by hostile tribes, as well as encroachment by European settlers.  The French abandoned the Kaskaskia mission.\n\nEventually the surviving Illinois speakers went to the [[Indian Territory]], later [[Oklahoma]] where the group became known as the Peoria. All of the [[Wea]] and [[Piankashaw]] were also forcibly relocated to Oklahoma, where they merged with the [[Peoria tribe|Peoria]]. About half the Miami proper remained in historic territory of present-day Indiana, the other half also being relocated to Oklahoma, eventually settling next to the Peoria. Because of the decline among the number of Miami-Illinois speakers, the language was not studied as extensively as many other Algonquian languages. It was not until 2002 that the manuscript was edited and published by Carl Masthay.<ref name=\"oxfordjournals2002\"/>\n\n==Phonology==\nThere is an extensive amount of data on the Miami-Illinois language. The problem with much of the data collected is that little of it was collected by trained phonologists and thus much of it is incomplete or incorrect. David Costa has written extensively on this language, compiling much of this data and correcting it in his book ''The Miami-Illinois Language''.\n\n===Consonants===\nThe consonants of the Miami-Illinois language are typical to the \"Central Algonquian\" languages. It contains the voiceless stops and affricate p, t, k, t\u0283; voiceless fricatives s, \u0283, h; nasals and liquids m, n, l; and the semivowels w, y.\nThe linguist David Costa (2003) notes that \"the original Proto-Algonquian consonants *p, *t, *k, * t\u0283, *s, *\u0283, *h, *m, *n, *w, *j remain largely unchanged.\"<ref name=\"Historical Phonology\">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3519724 \"Historical Phonology of Miami Illinois Consonants], Chicago: David Costa, 1991, ''International Journal of American Linguistics'', 57(3):365\u2013393, Retrieved 2011-11-6</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! align=\"center\"|[[labial consonant|Labial]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n!

There are also opposite alternations where {{IPA|/\u0283/}} occurs instead of {{IPA|/s/}}. Examples of both of these alternations seem to most prominently show themselves before the vowel {{IPA|/i/}}. Costa (2003) notes these \"examples of words showing {{IPA|/\u0283/}} for expected {{IPA|/s/}} follow: /apeeh\u0283ia/, /teekwee\u0283ita/, and /neeh\u0283iaani/\" <ref name=\"The Miami-Illinois Language\">Costa, David. 2003. The Miami-Illinois Language . Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press.</ref>\n\n===Vowels===\nMiami-Illinois has four short vowels, {{IPA|/i e a o/}} and four long vowels, {{IPA|/i\u02d0 e\u02d0 a\u02d0 o\u02d0/}}.\nCosta (2003) notes that \"{{IPA|/a/}} is a low non-front vowel however it can also be pronounced as a {{IPA|[\u028c]}} by some speakers. {{IPA|/o/}} is a back round vowel ranging from {{IPA|[o]}} through {{IPA|[\u028a]}} to {{IPA|[u]}}. {{IPA|/e/}} is a non-high front vowel ranging from {{IPA|[\u00e6]}} through {{IPA|[\u025b]}} to {{IPA|[e]}}. Finally, {{IPA|/i/}} is a high front vowel ranging from {{IPA|[\u026a]}} to {{IPA|[i]}}.\" These differences can occur from speaker to speaker and also from word to word.<ref name=\"The Miami-Illinois Language\"/>\n\n====Strong Syllable Rule====\nThe most important rule in the phonology of the vowels of the Miami-Illinois language is the [[Iamb (poetry)#Accentual-syllabic use|iambic metrical]] rule, which is referred to by David Costa (2003) as the strong syllable rule (SSR). Syllables in this language are considered either strong or weak depending on whether they occur in an even or odd numbered spot within the word. Counting from left to right, the even numbered syllables are strong and the odd numbered syllables are weak. However, a long vowel is always considered strong and the syllable count is restarted from this point. Anytime a short vowel comes after a long vowel it will always be weak because the count will have started over and it will occur in an even-numbered syllable.<ref name=\"The Miami-Illinois Language\"/>\n\n====Vowel Devoicing Rule====\nOne important rule for the phonology of Miami-Illinois is called the \"Vowel Devoicing Rule.\" In Miami-Illinois the weak vowels are devoiced any time they occur before a preaspirate. If a short vowel occurs before a preaspirate it will be devoiced if it follows a long vowel. This will also happen if it occurs in an odd-numbered syllable. However, if the vowel is in a strong syllable (or an even-numbered syllable) this rule does not apply. As Costa (2003) states it, \"a vowel in an original second syllable can be devoiced only if a long vowel precedes it, thus rendering the vowel odd-numbered for the syllable count.\" <ref name=\"The Miami-Illinois Language\"/>\n\n====Accents====\nAside from the \"Strong Syllable Rule\" (Costa, 2003), there is separate system of accenting in the Miami-Illinois language. In this rule, the syllable count begins at the end of the word and goes backwards towards the start of it (unlike the Strong Syllable Rule, which begins at the beginning of the word and goes forwards). Vowels in both weak and strong syllable can be accented. It is most common for words in this language to take accents on their penultimate syllables, though if a weak syllable is subject to devoicing, it can not receive an accent. This shows that the devoicing rule comes before the accent rule.<ref name=\"The Miami-Illinois Language\"/>\n\n==Language revitalization ==\nSince the mid-1990s, the [[Miami Tribe of Oklahoma]] has embarked on a [[language revitalization]] program.  Many Miami members have described the language as \"sleeping\" rather than \"extinct\" since it was not irretrievably lost.<ref>Leonard, Wesley Y. (2008). \"When is an 'Extinct Language' not Extinct? Miami, a Formerly Sleeping Language\", in Kendall A.

It is one of only two [[extant taxon|extant]] [[species]] in the [[scientific classification|family]] [[Hippopotamidae]], the other being the [[pygmy hippopotamus]] (''Choeropsis liberiensis'' or ''Hexaprotodon liberiensis'').  The name comes from the [[ancient Greek]] for \"river horse\" ({{lang|grc|\u1f31\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2}}). After the [[elephant]] and [[rhinoceros]], both of which are found in [[Africa]], the hippopotamus is the third-[[Largest mammals#Even-toed Ungulates (Artiodactyla)|largest type of land mammal]] and the heaviest extant [[Even-toed ungulate|artiodactyl]]. Despite their physical resemblance to [[pig]]s and other terrestrial even-toed [[ungulate]]s, the closest living relatives of the Hippopotamidae are [[cetacea]]ns ([[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[porpoise]]s, etc.) from which they diverged about 55 million years ago.\n\nHippos are recognisable by their barrel-shaped torsos, wide-opening mouths revealing large [[Canine tooth|canine]] tusks, nearly hairless bodies, columnar legs and large size; adults average {{convert|1500|kg|lbs|-1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1300|kg|lbs|-1|abbr=on}} for males and females respectively. Despite its stocky shape and short legs, it is capable of running {{convert|30|km/h|abbr=on}} over short distances.\n\nHippos inhabit rivers, lakes, and [[mangrove]] swamps, where territorial males preside over a stretch of river and groups of five to thirty females and young hippos. During the day, they remain cool by staying in the water or mud; reproduction and childbirth both occur in water. They emerge at dusk to graze on grasses. While hippos rest near each other in the water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos are not [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] on land. The hippo is among the most dangerous animals in the world as it is highly aggressive and unpredictable.

The [[pygmy hippopotamus]] belongs to a different genus in Hippopotamidae, either ''[[Choeropsis]]'' or ''[[Hexaprotodon]].'' Hippopotamidae are sometimes known as hippopotamids. Sometimes, the subfamily Hippopotaminae is used.

Other artiodactyls include [[camels]], [[cows|cattle]], [[deer]] and [[pigs]], although hippos are not closely related to these groups.\n\n[[File:Hipop\u00f3tamo (Hippopotamus amphibius), parque nacional de Chobe, Botsuana, 2018-07-28, DD 60.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the head]]\n\nFive subspecies of hippos have been described based on [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] differences in their skulls and geographical differences:<ref name=\"The Hippos\"/>{{rp|3}}\n*'''Great northern hippopotamus''' or '''Nile hippopotamus''' ''H. a. amphibius'' \u2013 (the nominate subspecies) which stretched from [[Egypt]], where they are now extinct, south up the [[Nile River]] to [[Tanzania]] and [[Mozambique]]\n*'''East African hippopotamus''' ''H. a. kiboko'' \u2013 in [[Kenya]] in the [[African Great Lakes]] region, and in [[Somalia]] in the [[Horn of Africa]].

Despite its stocky shape and short legs, it is capable of running {{convert|30|km/h|abbr=on}} over short distances.\n\nHippos inhabit rivers, lakes, and [[mangrove]] swamps, where territorial males preside over a stretch of river and groups of five to thirty females and young hippos. During the day, they remain cool by staying in the water or mud; reproduction and childbirth both occur in water. They emerge at dusk to graze on grasses. While hippos rest near each other in the water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos are not [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] on land.
