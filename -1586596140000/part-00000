FC Schweinfurt 05 team in 1905]]\n\nAt a time when football became more and more popular among broad levels of the population, ''1. Fussball-Club Schweinfurt 1905'' was founded on 5 May 1905 by a group of sports enthusiasts. The club's first chairman Pepi Popp designed the still unchanged FC 05 crest.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/> \n\nThe team played in the local leagues until beginning of the [[First World War]]. Back  then, the home games were held at [[Stadion am Hutrasen|Hutrasen]] south of river [[Main (river)|Main]], which later became the venue of local competitor [[VfR 07 Schweinfurt]]. In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1.

With promotion to Gauliga Bayern in 1933, however, the existing venue proved to be more and more inadequate.\n\nThe club's necessity finally motivated local industrialist [[Willy Sachs]] to the donation of a football stadium to the City of [[Schweinfurt]], where the patron designated a privileged right of use for FC Schweinfurt 05. The new [[Willy-Sachs-Stadion]],<ref name=\"Willy Sachs Stadion\"/> built by German architect [[Paul Bonatz]], was opened on 23 July 1936 in the presence of leading politicians of the [[Third Reich]].<ref name=\"Cicero\"/> The stadium saw its first game three days later with a 2\u20132 draw between Schweinfurt 05 and [[1935 German football championship|1935]] German champion [[FC Schalke 04]].<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/> Attandance record was 22,500 at a friendly between Schweinfurt 05 and [[1.

Besides the football field, the stadium offers [[track and field]] facilities, and is equipped with a classical [[Marathon]] gate. Premises at the stadium include changing rooms for players, coaches, and referees. Speaker cabins and a press area are available in the grandstand.\n\nThe stadium has been renovated and equipped with [[floodlights]] in 2001 in order to meet the requirements for [[2001\u201302 2. Bundesliga|2. Bundesliga]]. In addition, an electronic [[scoreboard]] was contributed by Schweinfurt's [[Ball bearing|large]] industry.

Fussball-Club Schweinfurt 1905'' was founded on 5 May 1905 by a group of sports enthusiasts. The club's first chairman Pepi Popp designed the still unchanged FC 05 crest.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/> \n\nThe team played in the local leagues until beginning of the [[First World War]]. Back  then, the home games were held at [[Stadion am Hutrasen|Hutrasen]] south of river [[Main (river)|Main]], which later became the venue of local competitor [[VfR 07 Schweinfurt]]. In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1. Fussball-Club Schweinfurt 1905, Verein f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen e.V.''<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nWhile FC 05 did not reap the expected benefits from the brief union, it improved dramatically after re-establishing itself as an independent club. Membership grew significantly and a number of new sports departments were formed within the organization. The football team yielded its first fruits in 1927 by winning the Unterfranken Cup championship,<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\">{{cite web|title=Geschichte des FC 05 Schweinfurt | trans-title=FC Schweinfurt 05 History|publisher=www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de | url=https://www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de/geschichte/geschichte-des-fc-05-schweinfurt/ |accessdate=26 July 2017|language=German}}</ref> and in 1931, when it became Kreisliga Unterfranken champion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kreisliga Bayern 1931|trans-title=1931 Kreisliga Bayern|publisher=fussball-historie.de|url=http://www.fussball-historie.de/Sued/OstkreisII1931.html|accessdate=10 April 2020|language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Years of excellence: 1931\u20131963===\n[[File:Andreas Kupfer and Albin Kitzinger.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Andreas Kupfer]] (left) and [[Albin Kitzinger]]]]\n\nSchweinfurt 05 finally gained first class status again with its entry into the [[Bezirksliga Bayern]] in 1931. \nAfter introduction of the [[Gauliga]] system in 1933, the club became member of the top-flight [[Gauliga Bayern]]. \nSchweinfurt had a couple of successful seasons in this era, winning the Gauliga Bayern in [[1938\u201339 Gauliga Bayern|1939]] and [[1941\u201342 Gauliga Bayern|1942]], and qualifying for the [[List of German football champions|German football championship]] round.\n \nIn the German football championship [[1939 German football championship|1939]] competition, the team barely missed the semi-final qualification games after 3 wins in the group stage, where it defeated later [[1943 German football championship|1943]] and [[1944 German football championship|1944]] German champion [[Dresdner SC]] 1\u20130 in the first leg, but then lost to Dresden 0\u20131 in the deceisive away match.<ref name=\"Stumpf\">{{cite web|title=Ehemaliger 05-Torwart Hans Stumpf gestorben|trans-title=Former 05 goalkeeper Hans Stumpf passed|publisher=mainpost.de|url=https://www.mainpost.de/sport/schweinfurt/Ehemaliger-05-Torwart-Hans-Stumpf-gestorben;art795,5487291?wt_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2F&wt_t=1585256396531|accessdate=26 March 2020|language=German}}</ref>\nThe club failed in the round of 16 of the [[1942 German football championship|1942]] German football championship after a 1\u20132 loss to [[SG SS Stra\u00dfburg]].\n\nSchweinfurt made a semi-final appearance in the [[1936 Tschammerpokal]], when it was defeated 2\u20133 by [[FC Schalke 04]], the closest it ever came to winning a national title.

FC 05 goalkeeper [[G\u00fcnter Bernard]] made two West Germany appearances in 1962, before he joined Bundesliga founding member [[SV Werder Bremen]] one year later, and was named in Germany's squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n===Second tier years: 1963\u20131976===\nAs it did not qualify for the newly established Bundesliga in 1963, Schweinfurt 05 found itself playing in the second tier [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1963\u20131974)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]]. In the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga|1965\u201366]] season, the club became Southern German champion and made it to the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga#Bundesliga promotion round|Bundesliga advancement games]], but was unable to ascend to the top tier.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[2. Bundesliga]] in 1974, Schweinfurt was founding member of the [[2. Bundesliga S\u00fcd (1974\u201381)|southern division]] despite only finishing 15th in the last Regionalliga year. For its first 2. Bundesliga season in [[1974\u201375 2. Bundesliga|1974\u201375]], the club had signed-up former national team [[forward (association football)|striker]] and [[List of Bundesliga top scorers|Bundesliga top scorer]] [[Lothar Emmerich]]. The team earned an excellent third place and barely missed the advancement games for promotion to Bundesliga.\n\n===Yo-yo years: 1976\u20132016===\n[[File:Schweinfurt Performance Chart.png|280px|thumb|Historical chart of the 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 league performance after 1945]]\nAfter the 1974\u201375 season, FC 05 began to falter: poor results and financial problems saw the club descend first to the [[Bayernliga]] (III) and then, for the first time in 1983, to the [[Landesliga Bayern-Nord]] (IV). Schweinfurt 05 became a [[yo-yo club]] ascending and descending between tiers III and IV, with just a pair of brief 2. Bundesliga appearances in [[1990\u201391 2. Bundesliga|1990\u201391]] and in [[2001\u201302 2. Bundesliga|2001\u201302]]. In the [[1989\u201390 DFB-Pokal|1989\u201390]] season the team made it into the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal]], where it lost 0\u20132 to [[Eintracht Braunschweig]].\n\nDisasters happened in 2004 when FC Schweinfurt 05 was forced to leave the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III) because of financial reasons, and in 2005 when the club went bankrupt. The results in the Bayernliga (IV) were annulled and the team was relegated to the fifth tier Landesliga.\n\nA re-structured club successfully worked its way back into Bayernliga in 2008. After it was relegated again to the Landesliga in 2009, the team returned to the Bayerliga immediately the following year. At the end of the [[2011\u201312 Bayernliga|2011\u201312]] season the club managed to qualify for the promotion round to the new [[Regionalliga Bayern]] (IV) and advanced to the second round, where the club missed out on promotion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Das war die Relegation 2012 auf Verbandsebene |publisher=www.fupa.net|url=http://www.fupa.net/berichte/so-laeuft-die-relegation-auf-verbandsebene-21714.html |accessdate=13 June 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\nThe club finally earned direct promotion to tier-four Regionalliga Bayern in the [[2012\u201313 Bayernliga|2012\u201313]] season by taking the championship in the Bayernliga northern division.\nSchweinfurt's first three Regionalliga years, however, were characterized by a permanent struggle against relegation.\nFC Schweinfurt 05 finished the [[2013\u201314 Regionalliga#Regionalliga Bayern|2013\u201314]] Regionalliga with a relegation play-off rank only courtesy of a controversial final game of the season.

With the establishment of the [[Regionalliga Bayern]] as the new fourth tier in Bavaria in 2012 the [[Bayernliga]] was split into a northern and a southern division, the number of Landesligas expanded from three to five and the Bezirksoberligas were abolished.

With promotion to Gauliga Bayern in 1933, however, the existing venue proved to be more and more inadequate.\n\nThe club's necessity finally motivated local industrialist [[Willy Sachs]] to the donation of a football stadium to the City of [[Schweinfurt]], where the patron designated a privileged right of use for FC Schweinfurt 05. The new [[Willy-Sachs-Stadion]],<ref name=\"Willy Sachs Stadion\"/> built by German architect [[Paul Bonatz]], was opened on 23 July 1936 in the presence of leading politicians of the [[Third Reich]].<ref name=\"Cicero\"/> The stadium saw its first game three days later with a 2\u20132 draw between Schweinfurt 05 and [[1935 German football championship|1935]] German champion [[FC Schalke 04]].<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/> Attandance record was 22,500 at a friendly between Schweinfurt 05 and [[1.

Besides the football field, the stadium offers [[track and field]] facilities, and is equipped with a classical [[Marathon]] gate. Premises at the stadium include changing rooms for players, coaches, and referees. Speaker cabins and a press area are available in the grandstand.\n\nThe stadium has been renovated and equipped with [[floodlights]] in 2001 in order to meet the requirements for [[2001\u201302 2.

It remains the only UK-designed-and-built fighter capable of [[Mach number|Mach 2]].  The Lightning was designed, developed, and manufactured by [[English Electric]], which was later absorbed by the newly-formed [[British Aircraft Corporation]]. Later the type was marketed as the '''BAC Lightning'''.  It was operated by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), the [[Kuwait Air Force]] (KAF) and the [[Royal Saudi Air Force]] (RSAF).\n\nA unique feature of the Lightning's design is the vertical, staggered configuration of its two [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] [[turbojet]] engines within the fuselage. The Lightning was initially designed and developed as an interceptor to defend the [[V bomber]] airfields<ref>Note: at the time, the V bombers carried Britain's [[nuclear deterrent]] and thus were the likely first-strike targets of a Soviet air attack on the UK. In addition to the Lightning, last line-of-defence for the airfields was to be what became the [[Bloodhound (missile)|Bristol Bloodhound]] guided missile.</ref> from attack by anticipated future nuclear-armed supersonic Soviet bombers such as what emerged as the [[Tupolev Tu-22]], but it was subsequently also required to intercept other [[bomber]] aircraft such as the [[Tupolev Tu-16]] and the [[Tupolev Tu-95]]. The Lightning has exceptional [[rate of climb]], [[Ceiling (aeronautics)|ceiling]], and speed; pilots have described flying it as \"being saddled to a skyrocket\".<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" /> This performance and the initially limited fuel supply<ref>Note: the original specification only called for a 150-mile radius of action from the V bomber bases the aircraft was defending. [[Roland Beamont]] later called for the Lightning's fuel capacity to be greatly increased, which it was.</ref> made the Lightning a \"fuel-critical\" aircraft, meaning that its missions are dictated to a high degree by its limited range. Later developments provided greater range and speed along with [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[Close air support|ground-attack]] capability.\n\nFollowing retirement by the RAF in the late 1980s, many of the remaining aircraft became museum exhibits. Until 2009, three Lightnings were kept flying at \"[[Thunder City]]\" in [[Cape Town]], South Africa. In September 2008, the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] conferred on the Lightning its \"Engineering Heritage Award\" at a ceremony at [[BAE Systems]]' site at [[Warton Aerodrome]].<ref>Robinson, Ben.

''Lancashire Evening Post'', Retrieved: 23 January 2010.</ref>\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:English Electric Lightning P.1 P.1A.svg|thumb|The two P.1 research aircraft]]\n\nThe specification for the aircraft followed the cancellation of the Air Ministry's 1942 [[List of Air Ministry Specifications|E.24/43]] supersonic research aircraft specification which had resulted in the [[Miles M.52]] programme.<ref>Halpenny 1984, {{page needed|date=April 2012}}</ref> [[W.E.W. Petter|W.E.W. \"Teddy\" Petter]], formerly chief designer at [[Westland Aircraft]], was a keen early proponent of Britain's need to develop a supersonic fighter aircraft. In 1947, Petter approached the [[Ministry of Supply (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Supply]] (MoS) with his proposal, and in response [[List of Air Ministry Specifications|Specification ER.103]] was issued for a single research aircraft, which was to be capable of flight at {{convert|1.5|Mach|50,000|km/h|0}} and {{convert|50000|ft}}.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nPetter initiated a design proposal with [[Frederick Page|F W \"Freddie\" Page]] leading the design and [[Ray Creasey]] responsible for the aerodynamics.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=104}} By July 1948 their proposal incorporated the stacked engine configuration and a high-mounted tailplane but was designed for Mach 1.5. As a consequence it had a conventional 40\u00b0 swept wing {{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=102}} This proposal was submitted in the November {{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=218}} and in January 1949 the project was designated P.1 by English Electric.{{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=58}} On 29 March 1949 MoS granted approval for English Electric to start the detailed design, develop wind tunnel models and build a full-size mockup. The design that had developed during 1948 evolved further during 1949.{{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=219}}{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=104}} To achieve Mach 2 the wing sweep was increased to 60\u00b0 with the ailerons moved to the wingtips.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=103}} In late 1949 low-speed wind tunnel tests showed that a vortex was generated by the wing which caused a large downwash on the tailplane; this issue was solved by lowering its height below the wing.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=103}} Following the resignation of Petter, Page took over as design team leader for the P.1.<ref name=\"Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310\">Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310.</ref>\n\nIn 1949, the Ministry of Supply had issued Specification F23/49, which expanded upon the scope of ER103 to include fighter-level manoeuvring. On 1 April 1950, English Electric received a contract for two flying [[airframe]]s, as well as one static airframe, designated ''P.1.''<ref name=\"Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310\" />\n\nThe [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] was sceptical of Petter's swept wing concepts. To test the design of both the wing, the tailplane and to assess handling, [[Short Brothers]] were issued a contract to produce the [[Short SB5]] in mid-1950.<ref group=\"nb\">The SB5 was allocated serial number WG768 on 27 July 1950.</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Air-Britain Aeromilitaria|volume=37|issue=145|title=Post-1950 Aircraft Specifications|author=Phil Butler|publisher=[[Air-Britain]]|pages=24\u201325|issn=0262-8791 }}</ref> This was a low-speed research aircraft and was designed so that different wing sweep angles could be assumed by the single aircraft. An assortment of tailplanes and wings were supplied and could be installed in order for their flight performance to be evaluated. However, following the first flight of the SB.5 on 2 December 1952, the trials demonstrated the choice of a tailplane and a 60-degree wingsweep and proved the design principles to be effective.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Prototypes===\n[[File:English Electric P.1 (27898298121).jpg|thumb|P1A]]\nFrom 1953 onwards, the first three prototype aircraft were hand-built at [[Samlesbury]]. These aircraft had been assigned the [[United Kingdom military aircraft serial numbers|aircraft serials]] ''WG760'', ''WG763'', and ''WG765'' (the static airframe){{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The prototypes were powered by un-[[Afterburner|reheated]] [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire]] turbojets, as the selected [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] engines which powered subsequent production aircraft had fallen behind schedule due to their own development problems.<ref>Darling 2000, p. 10.</ref> Due to the limited internal space of the fuselage the fuel capacity was relatively small, giving the prototypes an extremely limited [[combat endurance|endurance]], and the narrow tyres housed in the thin wings rapidly wore out.<ref name=\"Scott 2000_13\">Scott 2000, p. 13.</ref> Outwardly, the prototypes looked very much like the production series, but they were distinguished by the rounded-triangular intakes, short fins and lack of operational equipment.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" />\n\nOn 9 June 1952, it was decided that there would be a second phase of prototypes built to develop the aircraft towards achieving {{convert|2.0|Mach|km/h|0}}; these were designated ''P.1B'' while the initial three prototypes were retroactively reclassified as ''P.1A''.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 16\u201317.</ref> P.1B was a significant improvement on P.1A. While it was similar in aerodynamics, structure and control systems, it incorporated extensive alterations to the forward fuselage, reheated Rolls Royce Avon R24R engines, a conical centre body [[inlet cone]], variable nozzle reheat and provision for weapons systems integrated with the [[air data computer|ADC]] and [[Airborne interception radar#AI#|AI.23 radar]].{{sfnp|Beamont|1984|p=51-52}}<ref name =\"buttler 65\" /> Three P1B prototypes were built, assigned serials XA847, XA853 and XA856<ref name=\"Beamont 123\">Beamont 1985 p.123</ref>\n\nIn May 1954, ''WG760'' and its support equipment were moved to [[RAF Boscombe Down]] for pre-flight ground taxi trials; on the morning of 4 August 1954, ''WG760'', piloted by [[Roland Beamont]], flew for the first time from Boscombe Down.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 10\u201312.</ref> One week later, ''WG760'' officially achieved [[supersonic]] flight for the first time, having exceeded the [[speed of sound]] during its third flight.<ref name =\"buttler 65\">Buttler 2000, p. 65.</ref> During its first flight, ''WG760'' had unknowingly exceeded {{convert|1|Mach|km/h|0}}, but due to [[position error]] the [[Machmeter|Mach meter]] only showed a maximum of {{convert|0.95|Mach|km/h|0}}.

The [[Ferranti]] [[AI.23]] onboard radar provided [[missile guidance]] and ranging, as well as search and track functions.<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.1\" />\n\nThe next two Lightning variants, the ''Lightning F.1A'' and ''F.2'', were steady but relatively minor refinements of the design; the next variant, the ''Lightning F.3'', was a major departure. The F.3 had higher thrust [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] 301R engines, a larger squared-off fin and strengthened [[inlet cone]] allowing a service clearance to {{convert|2.0|Mach|km/h|0}} (the F.1, F.1A and F.2 were limited to {{convert|1.7|Mach|km/h|0}}).<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.3\">''Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.3''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, April 1965.</ref> The A.I.23B radar and [[Red Top missile]] offered a forward hemisphere attack capability and deletion of the nose cannon. The new engines and fin made the F.3 the highest performance Lightning yet, but with an even higher fuel consumption and resulting shorter range. The next variant, the ''Lightning F.6'', was already in development, but there was a need for an interim solution to partially address the F.3's shortcomings, the ''F.3A''.\n\n[[File:English Electric Lightning F3, UK - Air Force AN1127832.jpg|thumb|left|Lightning F.3 in flight, 1983]]\nThe F.3A introduced two improvements: a new, non-jettisonable, {{convert|610|impgal|L|adj=on}} ventral fuel tank,<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.6\">''Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.6''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, September 1966.</ref> and a new, kinked, conically cambered wing leading edge, incorporating a slightly larger [[leading edge]] fuel tank, raising the total usable internal fuel by {{convert|716|impgal|L}}. The conically cambered wing improved manoeuvrability, especially at higher altitudes, and the ventral tank nearly doubled available fuel. The increased fuel was welcome, but the lack of cannon armament was felt to be a deficiency. It was thought that cannons were desirable to fire warning shots in the intercept mission.<ref>Williams and Gustin 2004, p. 106.</ref>\n\nThe ''Lightning F.6'' was the ultimate Lightning version to see British service. Originally it was nearly identical to the F.3A with the exception that it could carry two {{convert|260|impgal|L|adj=on}} [[ferry tank]]s on [[Hardpoint|pylons]] over the wings. These tanks were jettisonable in an emergency, and gave the F.6 a substantially improved deployment capability. There remained one glaring shortcoming: the lack of cannon. This was finally rectified in the form of a modified ventral tank with two ADEN cannons mounted in the front. The addition of the cannons and their ammunition decreased the tank's fuel capacity from {{convert|610|to|535|impgal|L}}, but the cannon made the F.6 a \"real fighter\" again.<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.6\" />\n\nThe final British Lightning was the ''Lightning F.2A''. This was an F.2 upgraded with the cambered wing, the squared fin, and the {{convert|610|impgal|L}} ventral tank. The F.2A retained the A.I.23 and Firestreak missile, the nose cannon, and the earlier Avon 211R engines.<ref name= \"Aircrew Manual, F.2A\">''Lightning F.Mk.2A Aircrew Manual''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, July 1968.</ref> Although the F.2A lacked the thrust of the later Lightnings, it had the longest tactical range of all Lightning variants, and was used for low-altitude interception over [[West Germany]].\n\n===Export and further developments===\nThe ''Lightning F.53'', otherwise known as the ''Export Lightning'', developed as a private venture by BAC. While the Lightning had originated as an interception aircraft, this version was to have a [[Multirole combat aircraft|multirole]] capability for quickly interchanging between interception, reconnaissance, and ground-attack duties.<ref name=\"flight68 p371\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, p. 371.</ref> The F.53 was based on the F.6 airframe and avionics, including the large ventral fuel tank, cambered wing and overwing pylons for drop tanks of the F.6, but incorporated an additional pair of hardpoints under the outer wing. These hardpoints could be fitted with pylons for [[air-to-ground weaponry]], including two {{convert|1000|lb|abbr=on}} bombs or four [[SNEB]] rocket pods each carrying 18 68&nbsp;mm rockets. A gun pack carrying two ADEN cannons and 120 rounds each could replace the forward part of the ventral fuel tank.<ref name=\"flight68 p372-3\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, pp. 372\u2013373.</ref>{{refn|The ventral cannon installation was designed for the export aircraft but was later adopted by the RAF for the F.6 and F.2A.<ref name=\"WoF7 p57\">Lake 1997, p. 57.</ref>|group=nb}} Alternative, interchangeable packs in the forward fuselage carried two Firestreak missiles, two Red Top missiles, twin retractable launchers for 44\u00d7 {{convert|2|inch|adj=on|sigfig=1}} rockets, or a [[reconnaissance pod]] fitted with five 70&nbsp;mm Type 360 Vinten cameras.<ref name=\"flight68 p373\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, p. 373.</ref>\n\nBAC also proposed clearing the overwing hardpoints for carriage of weapons as well as [[drop tank]]s, with additional Matra JL-100 combined rocket and fuel pods (each containing 18 SNEB {{convert|68|mm|abbr=on|lk=on}} rockets and {{convert|227|L|impgal|lk=on|order=flip}} of fuel) or {{convert|1000|lb}} bombs being possible options. This could give a maximum ground attack weapons load for a developed export Lightning of six {{convert|1000|lb}} bombs or 44 \u00d7 {{convert|2|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} rockets and 144 \u00d7 68&nbsp;mm rockets.<ref name=\"combatp67\">Gunston and Spick 1983, p. 67.</ref><ref name=\"flight68 p372-3,6\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, pp. 372\u2013373, 376.</ref> The ''Lightning T.55'' was the export two-seat variant; unlike the RAF two-seaters, the T.55 was equipped for combat duties. The T.55 had a very similar fuselage to the T.5, while also using the wing and large ventral tank of the F.6.<ref name=\"WoF7 p56-7\" /> The Export Lightning had all of the capability of the RAF's own Lightnings such as exceptional climb rate and agile manoeuvering. The Export Lightning also retained the difficulty of maintenance, and serviceability rates suffered. The F.53 was generally well regarded by its pilots, and its adaptation to multiple roles showed the skill of its designers.<ref name= \"McLelland 2009\">McLelland 2009, {{page needed|date=April 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963, BAC Warton was working on the preliminary design of a two-seat Lightning development with a [[variable-geometry wing]], based on the Lightning T.5. In addition to the [[variable-sweep wing]], which was to sweepback between 25 degrees and 60 degrees, the proposed design featured an extended ventral pack for greater fuel capacity, an enlarged dorsal fin fairing, an arrestor hook, and a revised inward-retracting undercarriage. The aircraft was designed to be compatible with the [[Royal Navy]]'s existing [[aircraft carriers]] [[carrier-based aircraft]], the VG Lightning concept was revised into a land-based interceptor intended for the RAF the following year.<ref name= \"Wood 1986\">Wood 1986, pp. 183\u2013184.</ref> Various alternative engines to the Avon were suggested, such as the newer [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] engine. It is likely that the VG Lightning would have adopted a solid nose (by moving the air inlet to the sides or to upper fuselage) to install a larger, more capable radar.<ref name =\"buttler 114-117\" />\n\n==Design==\n\n===Overview===\nThe Lightning had several distinctive design features, the primary being the twin-engine arrangement, notched [[delta wing]], and low-mounted tailplane. The vertically stacked and longitudinally staggered engines were the solution devised by Petter to meet the conflicting requirements of minimising frontal area, providing undisturbed engine airflow across a wide speed range, and packaging two engines to provide sufficient thrust to meet performance goals. The unusual over/under configuration allowed for the thrust of two engines, with the [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]] equivalent to only 1.5 engines mounted side-by-side, a reduction in drag of 25% over more conventional twin-engine installations.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%201766.html |title=Multi-mission Lightning |work=Flight International |page=372 |date=5 September 1960}}</ref> The engines were fed by a single nose inlet (with [[inlet cone]]), with the flow split vertically aft of the cockpit, and the nozzles tightly stacked, effectively tucking one engine behind the cockpit. The result was a low frontal area, an efficient inlet, and excellent single-engine handling with no problems of asymmetrical thrust. Because the engines were close together, an uncontained failure of one engine was likely to damage the other. If desired, an engine could be shut down in flight and the remaining engine run at a more efficient power setting which increased range or endurance;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%200542.html|title=air marshal \u2013 wg \u2013 ib \u2013 1957 \u2013 0542 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%201770.html|title=1968 \u2013 1770 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref> although this was rarely done operationally because there would be no hydraulic power if the remaining engine failed .<ref name=\"flightglobal.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1961/1961%20-%200231.html|title=lightning \u2013 english electric \u2013 1961 \u2013 0231 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EE Lightning F6 XS904 BQ (7173122840).jpg|thumb|left|Lightning F.6 XS904 after a high-speed taxi run at 2012 Cold War Jets Day, Bruntingthorpe]]\n\nProduction aircraft were powered by various models of the [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] engine. This power-plant was initially rated as capable of generating {{convert|11250|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} of dry thrust, but when employing the four-stage [[afterburner]] this increased to a maximum thrust of {{convert|14430|lbf|kN|abbr=on}}. Later models of the Avon featured, in addition to increased thrust, a full-variable [[Afterburner|reheat]] arrangement.<ref>Darling 2008, pp. 32, 66.</ref> A special heat-reflecting paint containing gold was used to protect the aircraft's structure from the hot engine casing which could reach temperatures of 600&nbsp;\u00b0C.

The inlet's central shock cone served as a compression surface, diverting air into the annular inlet. As the Lightning accelerated through Mach 1, the shock cone generated an oblique shock positioned forward of the intake lip. Known as a subcritical inlet condition, this was stable, but produced inefficient spillage drag. Around the Design Mach speed, the oblique shock was positioned just forward of the inlet lip and efficiently compressed the air without spillage. When travelling beyond the Design Mach, the oblique shock became supercritical, and supersonic airflow entered the inlet duct, which could only handle subsonic air. In this condition, the engine generated drastically less thrust and may result in [[engine surge|surges]] or [[compressor stall]]s, these could cause [[flameout]]s or damage.\n\nThermal and structural limits were also present. Air is heated considerably when compressed by the passage of an aircraft at supersonic speeds. The airframe absorbs heat from the surrounding air, the inlet shock cone at the front of the aircraft becoming the hottest part. The shock cone was composed of fibreglass, necessary because the shock cone also served as a radar radome; a metal shock cone would have interfered with the AI 23's radar emissions. The shock cone was eventually weakened due to the fatigue caused by the thermal cycles involved in regularly performing high-speed flights. At {{convert|36000|ft}} and {{convert|1.7|Mach|36000|km/h|0}}, the heating conditions on the shock cone was similar to those at sea level and {{convert|650|kn|km/h}} indicated airspeed,<ref group=\"nb\">On a standard day, the temperature of the air at the tip of the shock cone (stagnation temperature) was {{convert|156|\u00b0F}} at {{convert|1.7|Mach|36000|km/h|0}} and {{convert|36000|ft}}.

Prior testing had determined that the aircraft had the excess thrust to achieve this speed, given the right atmospheric conditions of a high tropopause and lower-than-standard temperature. The test flight was to check for inlet stability and monitor temperatures at higher Mach. The aircraft was equipped with a temperature probe to monitor the stagnation temperature, up to a never-exceed temperature of 115&nbsp;\u00b0C.

It remains the only UK-designed-and-built fighter capable of [[Mach number|Mach 2]].  The Lightning was designed, developed, and manufactured by [[English Electric]], which was later absorbed by the newly-formed [[British Aircraft Corporation]]. Later the type was marketed as the '''BAC Lightning'''.  It was operated by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), the [[Kuwait Air Force]] (KAF) and the [[Royal Saudi Air Force]] (RSAF).\n\nA unique feature of the Lightning's design is the vertical, staggered configuration of its two [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] [[turbojet]] engines within the fuselage. The Lightning was initially designed and developed as an interceptor to defend the [[V bomber]] airfields<ref>Note: at the time, the V bombers carried Britain's [[nuclear deterrent]] and thus were the likely first-strike targets of a Soviet air attack on the UK. In addition to the Lightning, last line-of-defence for the airfields was to be what became the [[Bloodhound (missile)|Bristol Bloodhound]] guided missile.</ref> from attack by anticipated future nuclear-armed supersonic Soviet bombers such as what emerged as the [[Tupolev Tu-22]], but it was subsequently also required to intercept other [[bomber]] aircraft such as the [[Tupolev Tu-16]] and the [[Tupolev Tu-95]].

Later developments provided greater range and speed along with [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[Close air support|ground-attack]] capability.\n\nFollowing retirement by the RAF in the late 1980s, many of the remaining aircraft became museum exhibits. Until 2009, three Lightnings were kept flying at \"[[Thunder City]]\" in [[Cape Town]], South Africa.

Petter|W.E.W. \"Teddy\" Petter]], formerly chief designer at [[Westland Aircraft]], was a keen early proponent of Britain's need to develop a supersonic fighter aircraft. In 1947, Petter approached the [[Ministry of Supply (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Supply]] (MoS) with his proposal, and in response [[List of Air Ministry Specifications|Specification ER.103]] was issued for a single research aircraft, which was to be capable of flight at {{convert|1.5|Mach|50,000|km/h|0}} and {{convert|50000|ft}}.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nPetter initiated a design proposal with [[Frederick Page|F W \"Freddie\" Page]] leading the design and [[Ray Creasey]] responsible for the aerodynamics.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=104}} By July 1948 their proposal incorporated the stacked engine configuration and a high-mounted tailplane but was designed for Mach 1.5. As a consequence it had a conventional 40\u00b0 swept wing {{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=102}} This proposal was submitted in the November {{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=218}} and in January 1949 the project was designated P.1 by English Electric.{{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=58}} On 29 March 1949 MoS granted approval for English Electric to start the detailed design, develop wind tunnel models and build a full-size mockup. The design that had developed during 1948 evolved further during 1949.{{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=219}}{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=104}} To achieve Mach 2 the wing sweep was increased to 60\u00b0 with the ailerons moved to the wingtips.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=103}} In late 1949 low-speed wind tunnel tests showed that a vortex was generated by the wing which caused a large downwash on the tailplane; this issue was solved by lowering its height below the wing.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=103}} Following the resignation of Petter, Page took over as design team leader for the P.1.<ref name=\"Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310\">Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310.</ref>\n\nIn 1949, the Ministry of Supply had issued Specification F23/49, which expanded upon the scope of ER103 to include fighter-level manoeuvring. On 1 April 1950, English Electric received a contract for two flying [[airframe]]s, as well as one static airframe, designated ''P.1.''<ref name=\"Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310\" />\n\nThe [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] was sceptical of Petter's swept wing concepts. To test the design of both the wing, the tailplane and to assess handling, [[Short Brothers]] were issued a contract to produce the [[Short SB5]] in mid-1950.<ref group=\"nb\">The SB5 was allocated serial number WG768 on 27 July 1950.</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Air-Britain Aeromilitaria|volume=37|issue=145|title=Post-1950 Aircraft Specifications|author=Phil Butler|publisher=[[Air-Britain]]|pages=24\u201325|issn=0262-8791 }}</ref> This was a low-speed research aircraft and was designed so that different wing sweep angles could be assumed by the single aircraft. An assortment of tailplanes and wings were supplied and could be installed in order for their flight performance to be evaluated. However, following the first flight of the SB.5 on 2 December 1952, the trials demonstrated the choice of a tailplane and a 60-degree wingsweep and proved the design principles to be effective.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Prototypes===\n[[File:English Electric P.1 (27898298121).jpg|thumb|P1A]]\nFrom 1953 onwards, the first three prototype aircraft were hand-built at [[Samlesbury]]. These aircraft had been assigned the [[United Kingdom military aircraft serial numbers|aircraft serials]] ''WG760'', ''WG763'', and ''WG765'' (the static airframe){{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The prototypes were powered by un-[[Afterburner|reheated]] [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire]] turbojets, as the selected [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] engines which powered subsequent production aircraft had fallen behind schedule due to their own development problems.<ref>Darling 2000, p. 10.</ref> Due to the limited internal space of the fuselage the fuel capacity was relatively small, giving the prototypes an extremely limited [[combat endurance|endurance]], and the narrow tyres housed in the thin wings rapidly wore out.<ref name=\"Scott 2000_13\">Scott 2000, p. 13.</ref> Outwardly, the prototypes looked very much like the production series, but they were distinguished by the rounded-triangular intakes, short fins and lack of operational equipment.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" />\n\nOn 9 June 1952, it was decided that there would be a second phase of prototypes built to develop the aircraft towards achieving {{convert|2.0|Mach|km/h|0}}; these were designated ''P.1B'' while the initial three prototypes were retroactively reclassified as ''P.1A''.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 16\u201317.</ref> P.1B was a significant improvement on P.1A. While it was similar in aerodynamics, structure and control systems, it incorporated extensive alterations to the forward fuselage, reheated Rolls Royce Avon R24R engines, a conical centre body [[inlet cone]], variable nozzle reheat and provision for weapons systems integrated with the [[air data computer|ADC]] and [[Airborne interception radar#AI.23|AI.23 radar]].{{sfnp|Beamont|1984|p=51-52}}<ref name =\"buttler 65\" /> Three P1B prototypes were built, assigned serials XA847, XA853 and XA856<ref name=\"Beamont 123\">Beamont 1985 p.123</ref>\n\nIn May 1954, ''WG760'' and its support equipment were moved to [[RAF Boscombe Down]] for pre-flight ground taxi trials; on the morning of 4 August 1954, ''WG760'', piloted by [[Roland Beamont]], flew for the first time from Boscombe Down.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 10\u201312.</ref> One week later, ''WG760'' officially achieved [[supersonic]] flight for the first time, having exceeded the [[speed of sound]] during its third flight.<ref name =\"buttler 65\">Buttler 2000, p. 65.</ref> During its first flight, ''WG760'' had unknowingly exceeded {{convert|1|Mach|km/h|0}}, but due to [[position error]] the [[Machmeter|Mach meter]] only showed a maximum of {{convert|0.95|Mach|km/h|0}}. The occurrence was noticed during flight data analysis a few days later.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%200541.html \"Progress with the P.1\"] ''Flight'', 26 April 1957, p.&nbsp;543.</ref> While ''WG760'' had proven the P.1 design to be viable, it was limited to {{convert|1.51|Mach|km/h|0}} due to [[directional stability]] limits. In May 1956, the P.1 received the \"Lightning\" name, which was said to have been partially selected to reflect the aircraft's supersonic capabilities.<ref name =\"buttler 66\">Buttler 2000, p. 66.</ref>\n\nOn 4 April 1957 Beamont made the first flight of the P.1B (XA847) exceeding Mach 1 during this flight.{{sfnp|Flight|26 April 1957}}{{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=56-57}} On 25 November he reached Mach 2, {{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=67}} the first time in a British aircraft.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" /> During the early flight trials of the P.1B speeds in excess of 1,000&nbsp;mph were achieved daily. During this period the [[Fairey FD2]] delta held the world speed record (1,132&nbsp;mph achieved on 10 March 1956 and held till December 1957). While the P.1B was potentially faster than the FD2, it lacked the fuel capacity to provide one run in each direction at maximum speed to claim the record in accordance with international rules.{{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=59}}\n\nIn 1958 two test pilots from the USAF [[Air Force Flight Test Center]], Andy Anderson and [[Deke Slayton]], were given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the P1B. Slayton, who was subsequently selected as one of the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] astronauts, commented:\n\n{{quote|The P.1 was a terrific plane, with the easy handling of the F-86 and the performance of an F-104.

To best perform this intercept mission, emphasis was placed on rate-of-climb, acceleration, and speed, rather than [[range (aeronautics)|range]] \u2013 originally a radius of operation of {{convert|150|mi}} from the V bomber airfields was specified \u2013 and [[combat endurance]]. It was equipped with two 30&nbsp;mm ADEN cannon in front of the cockpit windscreen and an interchangeable fuselage weapons pack containing either an additional two ADEN cannon, 48 {{convert|2|in|adj=on|spell=in}} unguided air-to-air rockets, or two [[de Havilland Firestreak]] [[air-to-air missile]]s;<ref name=\"Scott 2000_119\">Scott 2000, pp. 119\u2013129.</ref> a heavy loadout optimised for damaging large aircraft. The [[Ferranti]] [[AI.23]] onboard radar provided [[missile guidance]] and ranging, as well as search and track functions.<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.1\" />\n\nThe next two Lightning variants, the ''Lightning F.1A'' and ''F.2'', were steady but relatively minor refinements of the design; the next variant, the ''Lightning F.3'', was a major departure. The F.3 had higher thrust [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] 301R engines, a larger squared-off fin and strengthened [[inlet cone]] allowing a service clearance to {{convert|2.0|Mach|km/h|0}} (the F.1, F.1A and F.2 were limited to {{convert|1.7|Mach|km/h|0}}).<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.3\">''Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.3''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, April 1965.</ref> The A.I.23B radar and [[Red Top missile]] offered a forward hemisphere attack capability and deletion of the nose cannon. The new engines and fin made the F.3 the highest performance Lightning yet, but with an even higher fuel consumption and resulting shorter range. The next variant, the ''Lightning F.6'', was already in development, but there was a need for an interim solution to partially address the F.3's shortcomings, the ''F.3A''.\n\n[[File:English Electric Lightning F3, UK - Air Force AN1127832.jpg|thumb|left|Lightning F.3 in flight, 1983]]\nThe F.3A introduced two improvements: a new, non-jettisonable, {{convert|610|impgal|L|adj=on}} ventral fuel tank,<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.6\">''Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.6''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, September 1966.</ref> and a new, kinked, conically cambered wing leading edge, incorporating a slightly larger [[leading edge]] fuel tank, raising the total usable internal fuel by {{convert|716|impgal|L}}. The conically cambered wing improved manoeuvrability, especially at higher altitudes, and the ventral tank nearly doubled available fuel. The increased fuel was welcome, but the lack of cannon armament was felt to be a deficiency. It was thought that cannons were desirable to fire warning shots in the intercept mission.<ref>Williams and Gustin 2004, p. 106.</ref>\n\nThe ''Lightning F.6'' was the ultimate Lightning version to see British service. Originally it was nearly identical to the F.3A with the exception that it could carry two {{convert|260|impgal|L|adj=on}} [[ferry tank]]s on [[Hardpoint|pylons]] over the wings. These tanks were jettisonable in an emergency, and gave the F.6 a substantially improved deployment capability. There remained one glaring shortcoming: the lack of cannon. This was finally rectified in the form of a modified ventral tank with two ADEN cannons mounted in the front. The addition of the cannons and their ammunition decreased the tank's fuel capacity from {{convert|610|to|535|impgal|L}}, but the cannon made the F.6 a \"real fighter\" again.<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.6\" />\n\nThe final British Lightning was the ''Lightning F.2A''. This was an F.2 upgraded with the cambered wing, the squared fin, and the {{convert|610|impgal|L}} ventral tank. The F.2A retained the A.I.23 and Firestreak missile, the nose cannon, and the earlier Avon 211R engines.<ref name= \"Aircrew Manual, F.2A\">''Lightning F.Mk.2A Aircrew Manual''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, July 1968.</ref> Although the F.2A lacked the thrust of the later Lightnings, it had the longest tactical range of all Lightning variants, and was used for low-altitude interception over [[West Germany]].\n\n===Export and further developments===\nThe ''Lightning F.53'', otherwise known as the ''Export Lightning'', developed as a private venture by BAC. While the Lightning had originated as an interception aircraft, this version was to have a [[Multirole combat aircraft|multirole]] capability for quickly interchanging between interception, reconnaissance, and ground-attack duties.<ref name=\"flight68 p371\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, p. 371.</ref> The F.53 was based on the F.6 airframe and avionics, including the large ventral fuel tank, cambered wing and overwing pylons for drop tanks of the F.6, but incorporated an additional pair of hardpoints under the outer wing. These hardpoints could be fitted with pylons for [[air-to-ground weaponry]], including two {{convert|1000|lb|abbr=on}} bombs or four [[SNEB]] rocket pods each carrying 18 68&nbsp;mm rockets. A gun pack carrying two ADEN cannons and 120 rounds each could replace the forward part of the ventral fuel tank.<ref name=\"flight68 p372-3\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, pp. 372\u2013373.</ref>{{refn|The ventral cannon installation was designed for the export aircraft but was later adopted by the RAF for the F.6 and F.2A.<ref name=\"WoF7 p57\">Lake 1997, p. 57.</ref>|group=nb}} Alternative, interchangeable packs in the forward fuselage carried two Firestreak missiles, two Red Top missiles, twin retractable launchers for 44\u00d7 {{convert|2|inch|adj=on|sigfig=1}} rockets, or a [[reconnaissance pod]] fitted with five 70&nbsp;mm Type 360 Vinten cameras.<ref name=\"flight68 p373\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, p. 373.</ref>\n\nBAC also proposed clearing the overwing hardpoints for carriage of weapons as well as [[drop tank]]s, with additional Matra JL-100 combined rocket and fuel pods (each containing 18 SNEB {{convert|68|mm|abbr=on|lk=on}} rockets and {{convert|227|L|impgal|lk=on|order=flip}} of fuel) or {{convert|1000|lb}} bombs being possible options. This could give a maximum ground attack weapons load for a developed export Lightning of six {{convert|1000|lb}} bombs or 44 \u00d7 {{convert|2|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} rockets and 144 \u00d7 68&nbsp;mm rockets.<ref name=\"combatp67\">Gunston and Spick 1983, p. 67.</ref><ref name=\"flight68 p372-3,6\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, pp. 372\u2013373, 376.</ref> The ''Lightning T.55'' was the export two-seat variant; unlike the RAF two-seaters, the T.55 was equipped for combat duties. The T.55 had a very similar fuselage to the T.5, while also using the wing and large ventral tank of the F.6.<ref name=\"WoF7 p56-7\" /> The Export Lightning had all of the capability of the RAF's own Lightnings such as exceptional climb rate and agile manoeuvering. The Export Lightning also retained the difficulty of maintenance, and serviceability rates suffered. The F.53 was generally well regarded by its pilots, and its adaptation to multiple roles showed the skill of its designers.<ref name= \"McLelland 2009\">McLelland 2009, {{page needed|date=April 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963, BAC Warton was working on the preliminary design of a two-seat Lightning development with a [[variable-geometry wing]], based on the Lightning T.5. In addition to the [[variable-sweep wing]], which was to sweepback between 25 degrees and 60 degrees, the proposed design featured an extended ventral pack for greater fuel capacity, an enlarged dorsal fin fairing, an arrestor hook, and a revised inward-retracting undercarriage. The aircraft was designed to be compatible with the [[Royal Navy]]'s existing [[aircraft carriers]] [[carrier-based aircraft]], the VG Lightning concept was revised into a land-based interceptor intended for the RAF the following year.<ref name= \"Wood 1986\">Wood 1986, pp. 183\u2013184.</ref> Various alternative engines to the Avon were suggested, such as the newer [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] engine. It is likely that the VG Lightning would have adopted a solid nose (by moving the air inlet to the sides or to upper fuselage) to install a larger, more capable radar.<ref name =\"buttler 114-117\" />\n\n==Design==\n\n===Overview===\nThe Lightning had several distinctive design features, the primary being the twin-engine arrangement, notched [[delta wing]], and low-mounted tailplane. The vertically stacked and longitudinally staggered engines were the solution devised by Petter to meet the conflicting requirements of minimising frontal area, providing undisturbed engine airflow across a wide speed range, and packaging two engines to provide sufficient thrust to meet performance goals. The unusual over/under configuration allowed for the thrust of two engines, with the [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]] equivalent to only 1.5 engines mounted side-by-side, a reduction in drag of 25% over more conventional twin-engine installations.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%201766.html |title=Multi-mission Lightning |work=Flight International |page=372 |date=5 September 1960}}</ref> The engines were fed by a single nose inlet (with [[inlet cone]]), with the flow split vertically aft of the cockpit, and the nozzles tightly stacked, effectively tucking one engine behind the cockpit. The result was a low frontal area, an efficient inlet, and excellent single-engine handling with no problems of asymmetrical thrust. Because the engines were close together, an uncontained failure of one engine was likely to damage the other. If desired, an engine could be shut down in flight and the remaining engine run at a more efficient power setting which increased range or endurance;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%200542.html|title=air marshal \u2013 wg \u2013 ib \u2013 1957 \u2013 0542 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%201770.html|title=1968 \u2013 1770 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref> although this was rarely done operationally because there would be no hydraulic power if the remaining engine failed .<ref name=\"flightglobal.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1961/1961%20-%200231.html|title=lightning \u2013 english electric \u2013 1961 \u2013 0231 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EE Lightning F6 XS904 BQ (7173122840).jpg|thumb|left|Lightning F.6 XS904 after a high-speed taxi run at 2012 Cold War Jets Day, Bruntingthorpe]]\n\nProduction aircraft were powered by various models of the [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] engine. This power-plant was initially rated as capable of generating {{convert|11250|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} of dry thrust, but when employing the four-stage [[afterburner]] this increased to a maximum thrust of {{convert|14430|lbf|kN|abbr=on}}.

The inlet's central shock cone served as a compression surface, diverting air into the annular inlet. As the Lightning accelerated through Mach 1, the shock cone generated an oblique shock positioned forward of the intake lip. Known as a subcritical inlet condition, this was stable, but produced inefficient spillage drag. Around the Design Mach speed, the oblique shock was positioned just forward of the inlet lip and efficiently compressed the air without spillage. When travelling beyond the Design Mach, the oblique shock became supercritical, and supersonic airflow entered the inlet duct, which could only handle subsonic air. In this condition, the engine generated drastically less thrust and may result in [[engine surge|surge]]s or [[compressor stall]]s, these could cause [[flameout]]s or damage.\n\nThermal and structural limits were also present. Air is heated considerably when compressed by the passage of an aircraft at supersonic speeds. The airframe absorbs heat from the surrounding air, the inlet shock cone at the front of the aircraft becoming the hottest part. The shock cone was composed of fibreglass, necessary because the shock cone also served as a radar radome; a metal shock cone would have interfered with the AI 23's radar emissions. The shock cone was eventually weakened due to the fatigue caused by the thermal cycles involved in regularly performing high-speed flights. At {{convert|36000|ft}} and {{convert|1.7|Mach|36000|km/h|0}}, the heating conditions on the shock cone was similar to those at sea level and {{convert|650|kn|km/h}} indicated airspeed,<ref group=\"nb\">On a standard day, the temperature of the air at the tip of the shock cone (stagnation temperature) was {{convert|156|\u00b0F}} at {{convert|1.7|Mach|36000|km/h|0}} and {{convert|36000|ft}}.

The shock cone was strengthened on the later Lightning F.2A, F.3, F.6, and F.53 models, thus allowing routine operations at up to Mach 2.0.<ref name= \"McLelland 2009_50\">McLelland 2009, p. 50.</ref>\n\nThe small-fin variants could exceed Mach 1.7,{{refn|Roland Beamont took the Lightning P.1B XA847, a prototype of the F.1, to Mach 2.0. Prior testing had determined that the aircraft had the excess thrust to achieve this speed, given the right atmospheric conditions of a high tropopause and lower-than-standard temperature. The test flight was to check for inlet stability and monitor temperatures at higher Mach. The aircraft was equipped with a temperature probe to monitor the stagnation temperature, up to a never-exceed temperature of 115&nbsp;\u00b0C. On 28 November 1958, the weather availed a high tropopause and a substandard \u221267&nbsp;\u00b0C at {{convert|40000|ft}}.

[[Education City]], a large campus where U.S. and European universities reside, hosted a series of religious prayers and lectures as part of a month-long annual Ramadan program in 2015. The prayers and lectures were held at [[Education City]]'s new lavish mosque in Doha. [[Education City]] also affords campus space to other American universities such as [[Texas A&M University|Texas A&M]] and [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]].\n\nAmong those who have attended [[Education City]] lectures is a Saudi preacher who described the ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' massacre in Paris as \"the sequel to the comedy film of 9/11\", and another cleric who wrote, \"Jews and their helpers must be destroyed.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/06/24/qatar-s-foundation-for-hypocrisy.html|title=Qatar's Foundation for Hypocrisy|last=Dettmer|first=Jamie|date=24 June 2015|newspaper=The Daily Beast|access-date=27 April 2016}}</ref> The mosque in [[Education City]] has hosted extremist Anti-Semitic Wahhabi preachers speaking against \"Zionist aggressors\" in their sermons, and calling upon Allah \"to count them in number and kill them completely, do not spare a [single] one of them.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Qatar has reportedly sent Jewish professors back to America,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gulfnewsjournal.com/stories/510701773-houston-community-college-scales-back-operation-in-qatar|title=Houston Community College scales back operation in Qatar|last=Nakano|first=Hanna|website=gulfnewsjournal.com|access-date=27 April 2016}}</ref> and students attending American universities in Qatar are reportedly required to dress in a manner respectful to Wahhabism.<ref>{{cite news|title=While U.S. universities see dollar signs in Qatari partnerships, some cry foul|url=http://gulfnewsjournal.com/stories/510639673-while-u-s-universities-see-dollar-signs-in-qatari-partnerships-some-cry-foul|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=Gulf News Journal|date=24 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===European expansion===\nThere has been much concern, expressed in both American and European media and scholarship, over the fact that Wahhabi countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been financing mosques and buying up land all over Europe.

In 2016, the citizens of Brussels, Belgium overturned a 2015 decision to build a 600-person mosque next to the Qatari embassy. Fear largely emanates from the fact that Belgian citizens see the mosque as an opportunity for a Wahhabi country to exert control over Muslims in Europe, thus spreading the more extreme sect of Islam.<ref name=\"petrodollar\" />\n \nSeveral articles have been written that list the [[Cork Islamic Cultural Center]] as an example of one of many properties throughout Europe, paid for by the Qatari government, in an effort to spread an extreme and intolerant form of Islam known as Wahhabism.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe [[Assalam Mosque]] is located in Nantes, France was also a source on some controversy. Construction on the mosque began in 2009 and was completed in 2012. It is the largest mosque in its region in France.

These activists expressed fear that the Qatari government aimed to build Mosques all over Europe to spread Wahhabism. But the government quashed the lawsuit.
