It is estimated that 7% of world's population (420 million) are carriers, with 60% of total and 70% pathological being in Africa. Hemoglobinopathies are most common in populations from Africa, the Mediterranean basin and Southeast Asia.\n\nHemoglobinopathies are simply structural abnormalities in the globin proteins themselves.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.medicalassistantonlineprograms.org/hemoglobinopathy/ |title=Hemoglobinopathies and Thalassemia |website=medicalassistantonlineprograms.org/ }}</ref> [[Thalassemia]]s, in contrast, usually result in underproduction of normal globin [[protein]]s, often through mutations in regulatory genes.

Thus, some hemoglobinopathies are also thalassemias, but most are not.\n\nEither hemoglobinopathy or thalassemia, or both, may cause [[anemia]]. Some well-known hemoglobin variants such as [[sickle-cell anemia]] and [[congenital dyserythropoietic anemia]] are responsible for diseases, and are considered hemoglobinopathies. However, many [[hemoglobin variants]] do not cause pathology or anemia, and thus are often not classed as hemoglobinopathies, because they are not considered pathologies. [[Hemoglobin variants]] are a part of the normal [[human embryonic development|embryonic]] and [[human fetal development|fetal]] development, but may also be pathologic mutant forms of hemoglobin in a [[population]], caused by variations in genetics.

The majority of Hb variants do not cause disease and are most commonly discovered either incidentally or through newborn screening. A subset of Hb variants can cause severe disease when inherited in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state in combination with another structural variant or a thalassemia mutation. When clinical consequences occur, they may include anemia due to hemolysis or polycythemia due to alterations in the oxygen affinity of the abnormal Hb. Common examples of hemoglobin variants associated with hemolysis include sickle Hb (Hb S) and Hb C. Hb variants can usually be detected by protein-based assay methods; however, DNA-based methods may be required for variants with ambiguous or unusual results from protein analysis.\n\nThe major functional consequences of Hb structural variants can be classified as follows:\n\n* Change in physical properties (solubility): Common beta globin mutations can alter the solubility of the Hb molecule: Hb S polymerizes when deoxygenated and Hb C crystallizes.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0065-3233(08)60287-9| pmid=2195851| isbn=9780120342402| title=Sickle Cell Hemoglobin Polymerization | journal=Advances in Protein Chemistry| year=1990| last1=Eaton| first1=William A.| last2=Hofrichter| first2=James| volume=40| pages=63\u2013279}}</ref>\n* Reduced protein stability (instability): Unstable Hb variants are mutations that cause the Hb molecule to precipitate, spontaneously or upon oxidative stress, resulting in hemolytic anemia. Precipitated, denatured Hb can attach to the inner layer of the plasma membrane of the red blood cell (RBC) and form Heinz bodies.<ref>Srivastava P, Kaeda J, Roper D, Vulliamy T, Buckley M, Luzzatto L.

Blood. 1995Sep1;86(5):1977\u201382.</ref>\n* Change in oxygen affinity: High or low oxygen affinity Hb molecules are more likely than normal to adopt the relaxed (R, oxy) state or the tense (T, deoxy) state, respectively. High oxygen affinity variants (R state) cause polycythemia (e.g., Hb Chesapeake, Hb Montefiore). Low oxygen affinity variants can cause cyanosis (e.g., Hb Kansas, Hb Beth Israel).<ref>Percy MJ, Butt NN, Crotty GM, Drummond MW, Harrison C, Jones GL, et al.

Unstable Hb:'''\n\n* [[Methemoglobinemia]]:\n** a condition caused by elevated levels of [[methemoglobin]] in the blood. Methaemoglobin is a form of [[Hemoglobin|Hb]] that contains the ferric [Fe<sup>3+</sup>] form of iron. The affinity for oxygen of ferric iron is impaired. The binding of oxygen to methaemoglobin results in an ''increased'' affinity for oxygen in the remaining heme sites that are in ferrous state within the same tetrameric haemoglobin unit.\n\n'''B)\u00a0 Quantitative'''\n\n===== Amount abnormalities =====\nCopy number variation (e.g., deletion, duplication, insertion) is also a common genetic cause of Hb disorders, and complex rearrangements and globin gene fusions can also occur.\n\n* [[Thalassemia|Thalassemias]]: Thalassemias are quantitative defects that lead to reduced levels of one type of globin chain, creating an imbalance in the ratio of alpha-like chains to beta-like chains. As noted above, this ratio is normally tightly regulated to prevent excess globin chains of one type from accumulating. The excess chains that fail to incorporate into Hb form non-functional aggregates that precipitate within the RBC. This can lead to premature RBC destruction in the bone marrow (beta thalassemia) and/or in the peripheral blood (alpha thalassemia). Types:\n** Alpha\n** Beta (Major)\n** Beta (Minor)\n\n== Hemoglobin variants ==\nHaemoglobin variant are not necessarily pathological.

Malaria parasites live inside red blood cells, but subtly disturb normal cellular function. In patients predisposed for rapid clearance of red blood cells, this may lead to early destruction of cells infected with the parasite and increased chance of survival for the carrier of the trait.\n\n'''Hemoglobin functions''':\n*  Transport of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues: This is due to the peculiar cooperation of the globin chains that allows the molecule to take in more oxygen where there is increased oxygen and to release oxygen in low concentration of oxygen.\n* Transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs: The end product of tissue metabolism is acidic which increases [[hydrogen ion]]s in solution. The hydrogen ions combine with [[bicarbonate]]s to produce water and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is mop up by hemoglobin to favor this reversible reaction.\n* Transport of [[nitric oxide]]: Nitric oxide is a vasodilatator. This assists in the regulation of vascular reaction in times of stress as experienced during inflammation.\nPathology and organic structural abnormalities may lead to any of the following disease processes:\n* Anemia due to reduced life span of the red cells of reduced production of the cells e. g. hemoglobin S, C and E.\n* Increased oxygen affinity: The red blood cells do not release their oxygen content readily in hypoxic conditions. The bone marow therefore needs to produce more red blood cells and there is polycythemia.\n* Unstable hemoglobins: Red blood cells are easily destroyed under stress and hemolysis occurs with possible jaundice.\n* [[Methemoglobinemia]]: The iron in the heme portion of hemoglobin is easily oxidised and this reduces the ability of hemoglobin to bind oxygen. More deoxygenated hemoglobin are formed and the blood becomes [[cyanosis|cyanotic]].\n\n<br />\n\n== Hemoglobin Biology ==\nNormal hemoglobins \u2014 Human Hbs are tetrameric proteins composed of two pairs of globin chains, each of which contains one alpha-like (\u03b1-like) chain and one beta-like (\u03b2-like) chain. Each globin chain is associated with an iron-containing heme moiety. Throughout life, the synthesis of the alpha-like and the beta-like (also called non-alpha-like) chains is balanced so that their ratio is relatively constant and there is no excess of either type. <ref>Weatherall DJ. The New Genetics and Clinical Practice, Oxford University Press, Oxford 1991.</ref>\n\nThe specific alpha and beta-like chains that are incorporated into Hb are highly regulated during development:\n\n* Embryonic Hbs are expressed as early as four to six weeks of embryogenesis and disappear around the eighth week of gestation as they are replaced by fetal Hb.<ref>Huisman TH.

It is estimated that 7% of world's population (420 million) are carriers, with 60% of total and 70% pathological being in Africa. Hemoglobinopathies are most common in populations from Africa, the Mediterranean basin and Southeast Asia.\n\nHemoglobinopathies are simply structural abnormalities in the globin proteins themselves.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.medicalassistantonlineprograms.org/hemoglobinopathy/ |title=Hemoglobinopathies and Thalassemia |website=medicalassistantonlineprograms.org/ }}</ref> [[Thalassemia]]s, in contrast, usually result in underproduction of normal globin [[protein]]s, often through mutations in regulatory genes. The two conditions may overlap, however, since some conditions which cause abnormalities in globin proteins (hemoglobinopathy) also affect their production (thalassemia). Thus, some hemoglobinopathies are also thalassemias, but most are not.\n\nEither hemoglobinopathy or thalassemia, or both, may cause [[anemia]]. Some well-known hemoglobin variants such as [[sickle-cell anemia]] and [[congenital dyserythropoietic anemia]] are responsible for diseases, and are considered hemoglobinopathies. However, many [[hemoglobin variants]] do not cause pathology or anemia, and thus are often not classed as hemoglobinopathies, because they are not considered pathologies. [[Hemoglobin variants]] are a part of the normal [[human embryonic development|embryonic]] and [[human fetal development|fetal]] development, but may also be pathologic mutant forms of hemoglobin in a [[population]], caused by variations in genetics.

The majority of Hb variants do not cause disease and are most commonly discovered either incidentally or through newborn screening. A subset of Hb variants can cause severe disease when inherited in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state in combination with another structural variant or a thalassemia mutation. When clinical consequences occur, they may include anemia due to hemolysis or polycythemia due to alterations in the oxygen affinity of the abnormal Hb. Common examples of hemoglobin variants associated with hemolysis include sickle Hb (Hb S) and Hb C. Hb variants can usually be detected by protein-based assay methods; however, DNA-based methods may be required for variants with ambiguous or unusual results from protein analysis.\n\nThe major functional consequences of Hb structural variants can be classified as follows:\n\n* Change in physical properties (solubility): Common beta globin mutations can alter the solubility of the Hb molecule: Hb S polymerizes when deoxygenated and Hb C crystallizes.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0065-3233(08)60287-9| pmid=2195851| isbn=9780120342402| title=Sickle Cell Hemoglobin Polymerization | journal=Advances in Protein Chemistry| year=1990| last1=Eaton| first1=William A.| last2=Hofrichter| first2=James| volume=40| pages=63\u2013279}}</ref>\n* Reduced protein stability (instability): Unstable Hb variants are mutations that cause the Hb molecule to precipitate, spontaneously or upon oxidative stress, resulting in hemolytic anemia. Precipitated, denatured Hb can attach to the inner layer of the plasma membrane of the red blood cell (RBC) and form Heinz bodies.<ref>Srivastava P, Kaeda J, Roper D, Vulliamy T, Buckley M, Luzzatto L. Severe hemolytic anemia associated with the homozygous state for an unstable hemoglobin variant (Hb Bushwick). Blood. 1995Sep1;86(5):1977\u201382.</ref>\n* Change in oxygen affinity: High or low oxygen affinity Hb molecules are more likely than normal to adopt the relaxed (R, oxy) state or the tense (T, deoxy) state, respectively. High oxygen affinity variants (R state) cause polycythemia (e.g., Hb Chesapeake, Hb Montefiore). Low oxygen affinity variants can cause cyanosis (e.g., Hb Kansas, Hb Beth Israel).<ref>Percy MJ, Butt NN, Crotty GM, Drummond MW, Harrison C, Jones GL, et al.

Unstable Hb:'''\n\n* [[Methemoglobinemia]]:\n** a condition caused by elevated levels of [[methemoglobin]] in the blood. Methaemoglobin is a form of [[Hemoglobin|Hb]] that contains the ferric [Fe<sup>3+</sup>] form of iron. The affinity for oxygen of ferric iron is impaired. The binding of oxygen to methaemoglobin results in an ''increased'' affinity for oxygen in the remaining heme sites that are in ferrous state within the same tetrameric haemoglobin unit.\n\n'''B)\u00a0 Quantitative'''\n\n===== Amount abnormalities =====\nCopy number variation (e.g., deletion, duplication, insertion) is also a common genetic cause of Hb disorders, and complex rearrangements and globin gene fusions can also occur.\n\n* [[Thalassemia|Thalassemias]]: Thalassemias are quantitative defects that lead to reduced levels of one type of globin chain, creating an imbalance in the ratio of alpha-like chains to beta-like chains. As noted above, this ratio is normally tightly regulated to prevent excess globin chains of one type from accumulating. The excess chains that fail to incorporate into Hb form non-functional aggregates that precipitate within the RBC. This can lead to premature RBC destruction in the bone marrow (beta thalassemia) and/or in the peripheral blood (alpha thalassemia). Types:\n** Alpha\n** Beta (Major)\n** Beta (Minor)\n\n== Hemoglobin variants ==\nHaemoglobin variant are not necessarily pathological.

Malaria parasites live inside red blood cells, but subtly disturb normal cellular function. In patients predisposed for rapid clearance of red blood cells, this may lead to early destruction of cells infected with the parasite and increased chance of survival for the carrier of the trait.\n\n'''Hemoglobin functions''':\n*  Transport of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues: This is due to the peculiar cooperation of the globin chains that allows the molecule to take in more oxygen where there is increased oxygen and to release oxygen in low concentration of oxygen.\n* Transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs: The end product of tissue metabolism is acidic which increases [[hydrogen ion]]s in solution. The hydrogen ions combine with [[bicarbonate]]s to produce water and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is mop up by hemoglobin to favor this reversible reaction.\n* Transport of [[nitric oxide]]: Nitric oxide is a vasodilatator. This assists in the regulation of vascular reaction in times of stress as experienced during inflammation.\nPathology and organic structural abnormalities may lead to any of the following disease processes:\n* Anemia due to reduced life span of the red cells of reduced production of the cells e. g. hemoglobin S, C and E.\n* Increased oxygen affinity: The red blood cells do not release their oxygen content readily in hypoxic conditions. The bone marow therefore needs to produce more red blood cells and there is polycythemia.\n* Unstable hemoglobins: Red blood cells are easily destroyed under stress and hemolysis occurs with possible jaundice.\n* [[Methemoglobinemia]]: The iron in the heme portion of hemoglobin is easily oxidised and this reduces the ability of hemoglobin to bind oxygen. More deoxygenated hemoglobin are formed and the blood becomes [[cyanosis|cyanotic]].\n\n<br />\n\n== Hemoglobin Biology ==\nNormal hemoglobins \u2014 Human Hbs are tetrameric proteins composed of two pairs of globin chains, each of which contains one alpha-like (\u03b1-like) chain and one beta-like (\u03b2-like) chain. Each globin chain is associated with an iron-containing heme moiety. Throughout life, the synthesis of the alpha-like and the beta-like (also called non-alpha-like) chains is balanced so that their ratio is relatively constant and there is no excess of either type. <ref>Weatherall DJ.
