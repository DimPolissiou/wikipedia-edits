Electrical contacts made from [[busbar]]s (the larger silver-colored strips) and fingers (the smaller ones) are printed on the [[silicon]] [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]].]]\n[[File:Photovoltaic cell.svg|thumb|Symbol of a Photovoltaic cell.]]\nA '''solar cell''', or '''photovoltaic cell''', is an electrical device that converts the energy of [[light]] directly into [[electricity]] by the [[photovoltaic effect]], which is a [[physics|physical]] and [[Chemical substance|chemical]] phenomenon.<ref name=\"chemistryexplained.com\">[http://www.chemistryexplained.com/Ru-Sp/Solar-Cells.html Solar Cells]. chemistryexplained.com</ref> It is a form of photoelectric cell, defined as a device whose electrical characteristics, such as [[Electric current|current]], [[voltage]], or [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]], vary when exposed to light. Individual solar cell devices can be combined to form modules, otherwise known as [[solar panel]]s. The common single junction [[silicon]] solar cell can produce a maximum open-circuit voltage of approximately 0.5 to 0.6 volts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://solarbotics.net/starting/200202_solar_cells/200202_solar_cell_use.html|title=Solar cells \u2013 performance and use|website=solarbotic s.net}}</ref>\n\nSolar cells are described as being [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]], irrespective of whether the source is [[sunlight]] or an artificial light. In addition to producing energy, they can be used as a [[photodetector]] (for example [[infrared detector]]s), detecting light or other [[electromagnetic radiation]] near the visible range, or measuring light intensity.\n\nThe operation of a photovoltaic (PV) cell requires three basic attributes:\n* The absorption of light, generating either [[electron]]-[[Electron hole|hole]] pairs or [[exciton]]s.\n* The separation of [[charge carrier]]s of opposite types.\n* The separate extraction of those carriers to an external circuit.\n\nIn contrast, a [[solar thermal collector]] supplies [[heat]] by [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbing sunlight]], for the purpose of either direct heating or indirect [[electrical power generation]] from heat. A \"photoelectrolytic cell\" ([[photoelectrochemical cell]]), on the other hand, refers either to a type of photovoltaic cell (like that developed by [[Edmond Becquerel]] and modern [[dye-sensitized solar cell]]s), or to a device that [[Water splitting|splits water]] directly into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] using only solar illumination.\n{{TOC_limit|3}}\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:From a solar cell to a PV system.svg|thumb|From a solar cell to a PV system. Diagram of the possible components of a [[photovoltaic system]]]]\n\nAssemblies of solar cells are used to make [[Solar panel|solar modules]] that generate electrical power from [[sunlight]], as distinguished from a \"solar thermal module\" or \"solar hot water panel\". A solar array generates [[solar power]] using [[solar energy]].\n\n=== Cells, modules, panels and systems ===\n{{Main|Photovoltaic system}}\nMultiple solar cells in an integrated group, all oriented in one plane, constitute a [[Solar panel|solar photovoltaic panel or module]]. Photovoltaic modules often have a sheet of glass on the sun-facing side, allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]]. Solar cells are usually connected in [[series and parallel circuits]] or series in modules, creating an additive voltage. Connecting cells in parallel yields a higher current; however, problems such as shadow effects can shut down the weaker (less illuminated) parallel string (a number of series connected cells) causing substantial power loss and possible damage because of the reverse bias applied to the shadowed cells by their illuminated partners. Strings of series cells are usually handled independently and not connected in parallel, though as of 2014, individual [[Electric power conversion|power boxes]] are often supplied for each module, and are connected in parallel. Although modules can be interconnected to create an array with the desired peak DC voltage and loading current capacity, using independent MPPTs ([[Maximum power point tracking|maximum power point trackers]]) is preferable. Otherwise, shunt [[diode]]s can reduce shadowing power loss in arrays with series/parallel connected cells.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: 4px auto 1px auto;\"\n|+ Typical PV system prices in 2013 in selected countries ($/W)\n|-\n!

[[Willoughby Smith]] first described the \"Effect of Light on Selenium during the passage of an Electric Current\" in a 20 February 1873 issue of [[Nature (magazine)|Nature]]. In 1883 [[Charles Fritts]] built the first [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] photovoltaic cell by coating the [[semiconductor]] [[selenium]] with a thin layer of [[gold]] to form the junctions; the device was only around 1% efficient. Other milestones include:\n* 1888 \u2013 Russian physicist [[Aleksandr Stoletov]] built the first cell based on the outer [[photoelectric effect]] discovered by [[Heinrich Hertz]] in 1887.<ref name=\"Gevorkian2007\">{{cite book|last=Gevorkian |first=Peter |title=Sustainable energy systems engineering: the complete green building design resource|url={{google books|id=i8rcHsOfPScC|p=498|plainurl=y}}|year=2007|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-147359-0}}</ref>\n* 1905 \u2013 [[Albert Einstein]] proposed a new quantum theory of light and explained the [[photoelectric effect]] in a landmark paper, for which he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1921.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/ \"The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921: Albert Einstein\"], Nobel Prize official page</ref>\n* 1941 \u2013 [[Vadim Lashkaryov]] discovered ''p''-''n''-junctions in [[Copper(I) oxide|Cu<sub>2</sub>O]] and [[Silver sulfide|Ag<sub>2</sub>S]] protocells.<ref>Lashkaryov, V.

For Example, [[Explorer 6]], launched in 1959, had four arrays that folded out once in orbit. They provided power for months in space.]]\nSolar cells were first used in a prominent application when they were proposed and flown on the Vanguard satellite in 1958, as an alternative power source to the [[primary cell|primary battery]] power source. By adding cells to the outside of the body, the mission time could be extended with no major changes to the spacecraft or its power systems. In 1959 the United States launched [[Explorer 6]], featuring large wing-shaped solar arrays, which became a common feature in satellites. These arrays consisted of 9600 [[H. Leslie (Les) Hoffman|Hoffman solar cells]].\n\nBy the 1960s, solar cells were (and still are) the main power source for most Earth orbiting satellites and a number of probes into the solar system, since they offered the best [[power-to-weight ratio]]. However, this success was possible because in the space application, power system costs could be high, because space users had few other power options, and were willing to pay for the best possible cells. The space power market drove the development of higher efficiencies in solar cells up until the [[National Science Foundation]] \"Research Applied to National Needs\" program began to push development of solar cells for terrestrial applications.\n\nIn the early 1990s the technology used for space solar cells diverged from the silicon technology used for terrestrial panels, with the spacecraft application shifting to [[gallium arsenide]]-based III-V semiconductor materials, which then evolved into the modern III-V [[multijunction photovoltaic cell]] used on spacecraft.\n\nIn recent years, research has moved towards designing and manufacturing lightweight, flexible, and highly efficient solar cells. Terrestrial solar cell technology generally uses photovoltaic cells that are laminated with a layer of glass for strength and protection. Space applications for solar cells require that the cells and arrays are both highly efficient and extremely lightweight. Some newer technology implemented on satellites are multi-junction photovoltaic cells, which are composed of different PN junctions with varying bandgaps in order to utilize a wider spectrum of the sun's energy. Additionally, large satellites require the use of large solar arrays to produce electricity. These solar arrays need to be broken down to fit in the geometric constraints of the launch vehicle the satellite travels on before being injected into orbit. Historically, solar cells on satellites consisted of several small terrestrial panels folded together. These small panels would be unfolded into a large panel after the satellite is deployed in its orbit. Newer satellites aim to use flexible rollable solar arrays that are very lightweight and can be packed into a very small volume. The smaller size and weight of these flexible arrays drastically decreases the overall cost of launching a satellite due to the direct relationship between payload weight and launch cost of a launch vehicle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/solar_arrays.html|title=International Space Station Solar Arrays|last=Garcia|first=Mark|date=31 July 2017|website=NASA|access-date=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Price reductions ===\nImprovements were gradual over the 1960s. This was also the reason that costs remained high, because space users were willing to pay for the best possible cells, leaving no reason to invest in lower-cost, less-efficient solutions. The price was determined largely by the [[semiconductor industry]]; their move to [[integrated circuit]]s in the 1960s led to the availability of larger [[Boule (crystal)|boules]] at lower relative prices. As their price fell, the price of the resulting cells did as well. These effects lowered 1971 cell costs to some $100 per watt.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p= 50}}\n\nIn late 1969 Elliot Berman joined [[Exxon]]'s task force which was looking for projects 30 years in the future and in April 1973 he founded Solar Power Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon at that time.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p=53}}<ref name=\"williams 2005\">\n{{cite book\n | first = Neville | last = Williams\n | title = Chasing the Sun: Solar Adventures Around the World\n | url = https://archive.org/details/chasingsunsolara0000will | url-access = registration | year = 2005\n | publisher = [[New Society Publishers]]\n | page = [https://archive.org/details/chasingsunsolara0000will/page/84 84]\n | isbn = 9781550923124}}\n</ref><ref name=jones>\n{{cite book\n | first1 = Geoffrey | last1 = Jones\n | first2 = Loubna | last2 = Bouamane \n | title = \"Power from Sunshine\": A Business History of Solar Energy\n | url = http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/12-105.pdf\n | year = 2012\n | publisher = [[Harvard Business School]]\n | pages = 22\u201323\n }}\n</ref> The group had concluded that electrical power would be much more expensive by 2000, and felt that this increase in price would make alternative energy sources more attractive.

Cell sizes grew as equipment became available on the surplus market; [[ARCO]] Solar's original panels used cells {{convert|2|to|4|in|mm|-1}} in diameter. Panels in the 1990s and early 2000s generally used 125&nbsp;mm wafers; since 2008, almost all new panels use 156&nbsp;mm cells. The widespread introduction of [[flat screen television]]s in the late 1990s and early 2000s led to the wide availability of large, high-quality glass sheets to cover the panels.\n\nDuring the 1990s, [[polysilicon]] (\"poly\") cells became increasingly popular. These cells offer less efficiency than their monosilicon (\"mono\") counterparts, but they are grown in large vats that reduce cost. By the mid-2000s, poly was dominant in the low-cost panel market, but more recently the mono returned to widespread use.\n\nManufacturers of wafer-based cells responded to high silicon prices in 2004\u20132008 with rapid reductions in silicon consumption. In 2008, according to Jef Poortmans, director of [[IMEC]]'s organic and solar department, current cells use {{convert|8|-|9|g|oz}} of silicon per watt of power generation, with wafer thicknesses in the neighborhood of 200&nbsp;[[microns]].

These [[List of semiconductor materials|materials]] must have certain characteristics in order to absorb [[sunlight]]. Some cells are designed to handle sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, while others are optimized for [[Solar panels on spacecraft|use in space]]. Solar cells can be made of only one single layer of light-absorbing material ([[p-n junction|single-junction]]) or use multiple physical configurations ([[multi-junction]]s) to take advantage of various absorption and charge separation mechanisms.\n\nSolar cells can be classified into first, second and third generation cells. The first generation cells\u2014also called conventional, traditional or [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]-based cells\u2014are made of [[crystalline silicon]], the commercially predominant PV technology, that includes materials such as [[polysilicon]] and [[monocrystalline silicon]]. Second generation cells are [[thin film solar cells]], that include [[amorphous silicon]], [[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|CdTe]] and [[Copper indium gallium selenide solar cell|CIGS]] cells and are commercially significant in utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station]]s, [[building integrated photovoltaics]] or in small [[stand-alone power system]]. The [[third-generation photovoltaic cell|third generation of solar cells]] includes a number of thin-film technologies often described as emerging photovoltaics\u2014most of them have not yet been commercially applied and are still in the research or development phase. Many use organic materials, often [[organometallic]] compounds as well as inorganic substances.

Solar panels using mono-Si cells display a distinctive pattern of small white diamonds.\n\n====Epitaxial silicon development====\n[[Epitaxial wafer]]s of crystalline silicon can be grown on a monocrystalline silicon \"seed\" wafer by [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD), and then detached as self-supporting wafers of some standard thickness (e.g., 250&nbsp;\u00b5m) that can be manipulated by hand, and directly substituted for wafer cells cut from monocrystalline silicon ingots.

Based on the previous literature and some theoretical analysis, there are several reasons why GaAs has such high power conversion efficiency. First, GaAs bandgap is 1.43ev which is almost ideal for solar cells. Second, because Gallium is a by-product of the smelting of other metals, GaAs cells are relatively insensitive to heat and it can keep high efficiency when temperature is quite high. Third, GaAs has the wide range of design options. Using GaAs as active layer in solar cell, engineers can have multiple choices of other layers which can better generate electrons and holes in GaAs.\n\n=== Multijunction cells ===\n{{Main|Multi-junction solar cell}}\n[[File:Dawn solar panel.jpg|thumb|[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'s 10&nbsp;[[Kilowatt|kW]] triple-junction gallium arsenide solar array at full extension]]\n\nMulti-junction cells consist of multiple thin films, each essentially a solar cell grown on top of another, typically using [[metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy]].

Either of these techniques could be used to produce higher efficiency solar cells by allowing solar photons to be more efficiently used. The difficulty, however, is that the conversion efficiency of existing [[phosphor]]s exhibiting up- or down-conversion is low, and is typically narrow band.\n\nOne upconversion technique is to incorporate [[lanthanide]]-doped materials ([[Erbium|{{chem|Er|3+}}]], [[Ytterbium|{{chem|Yb|3+}}]], [[Holmium|{{chem|Ho|3+}}]] or a combination), taking advantage of their [[luminescence]] to convert [[infrared radiation]] to visible light. Upconversion process occurs when two [[infrared]] photons are absorbed by [[rare-earth]] [[ion]]s to generate a (high-energy) absorbable photon. As example, the energy transfer upconversion process (ETU), consists in successive transfer processes between excited ions in the near infrared. The upconverter material could be placed below the solar cell to absorb the infrared light that passes through the silicon. Useful ions are most commonly found in the trivalent state. {{chem|Er|+}} ions have been the most used. {{chem|Er|3+}} ions absorb solar radiation around 1.54&nbsp;\u00b5m. Two {{chem|Er|3+}} ions that have absorbed this radiation can interact with each other through an upconversion process. The excited ion emits light above the Si bandgap that is absorbed by the solar cell and creates an additional electron\u2013hole pair that can generate current. However, the increased efficiency was small.

In bulk it should be significantly less expensive than older [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] cell designs. DSSC's can be engineered into flexible sheets and although its [[conversion efficiency]] is less than the best [[thin film cell]]s, its [[price/performance ratio]] may be high enough to allow them to compete with [[fossil fuel electrical generation]].\n\nTypically a [[ruthenium]] [[Metalorganics|metalorganic]] [[dye]] (Ru-centered) is used as a [[monolayer]] of light-absorbing material. The dye-sensitized solar cell depends on a [[mesoporous]] layer of [[nanoparticulate]] [[titanium dioxide]] to greatly amplify the surface area (200\u2013300 m<sup>2</sup>/g {{chem|TiO|2}}, as compared to approximately 10 m<sup>2</sup>/g of flat single crystal). The photogenerated electrons from the light absorbing dye are passed on to the n-type {{chem|TiO|2}} and the holes are absorbed by an [[electrolyte]] on the other side of the dye. The circuit is completed by a [[redox]] couple in the electrolyte, which can be liquid or solid. This type of cell allows more flexible use of materials and is typically manufactured by [[screen printing]] or [[ultrasonic nozzle]]s, with the potential for lower processing costs than those used for bulk solar cells. However, the dyes in these cells also suffer from [[chemical decomposition|degradation]] under heat and [[UV]] light and the cell casing is difficult to [[Seal (mechanical)|seal]] due to the solvents used in assembly.

An adaptive material responds to the intensity and angle of incident light. At the part of the cell where the light is most intense, the cell surface changes from reflective to adaptive, allowing the light to penetrate the cell. The other parts of the cell remain reflective increasing the retention of the absorbed light within the cell.<ref name=tr1407>Bullis, Kevin (30 July 2014) [http://www.technologyreview.com/news/529476/adaptive-material-could-cut-the-cost-of-solar-in-half Adaptive Material Could Cut the Cost of Solar in Half].

The system also includes an array of fixed lenses/mirrors to concentrate light onto the adaptive surface. As the day continues, the concentrated light moves along the surface of the cell. That surface switches from reflective to adaptive when the light is most concentrated and back to reflective after the light moves along.<ref name=tr1407/>\n\n=== Surface texturing ===\n[[File:SolarImpulse HB-SIA landing Brussels Airport 3-crop.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Solar Impulse]] aircraft are Swiss-designed single-seat monoplanes powered entirely from photovoltaic cells]]\n\nFor the past years, researchers have been trying to reduce the price of solar cells while maximizing efficiency. [[Thin-film solar cell]] is a cost-effective second generation solar cell with much reduced thickness at the expense of light absorption efficiency. Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways.

However, the strict requirements for cleanliness and quality control of semiconductor fabrication are more relaxed for solar cells, lowering costs.\n\n[[Polycrystalline silicon]] wafers are made by wire-sawing block-cast silicon ingots into 180 to 350 micrometer wafers. The wafers are usually lightly [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]]-doped. A surface diffusion of [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] dopants is performed on the front side of the wafer. This forms a p\u2013n junction a few hundred nanometers below the surface.\n\n[[Anti-reflective coating|Anti-reflection coatings]] are then typically applied to increase the amount of light coupled into the solar cell. [[Silicon nitride]] has gradually replaced titanium dioxide as the preferred material, because of its excellent surface passivation qualities. It prevents carrier recombination at the cell surface. A layer several hundred nanometers thick is applied using PECVD. Some solar cells have textured front surfaces that, like anti-reflection coatings, increase the amount of light reaching the wafer. Such surfaces were first applied to single-crystal silicon, followed by multicrystalline silicon somewhat later.\n\nA full area metal contact is made on the back surface, and a grid-like metal contact made up of fine \"fingers\" and larger \"bus bars\" are screen-printed onto the front surface using a [[silver]] paste. This is an evolution of the so-called \"wet\" process for applying electrodes, first described in a US patent filed in 1981 by [[Bayer AG]].<ref>Fitzky, Hans G. and Ebneth, Harold (24 May 1983) {{US patent|4385102}}, \"Large-area photovoltaic cell\"</ref> The rear contact is formed by screen-printing a metal paste, typically aluminium. Usually this contact covers the entire rear, though some designs employ a grid pattern. The paste is then fired at several hundred degrees Celsius to form metal electrodes in [[ohmic contact]] with the silicon. Some companies use an additional electro-plating step to increase efficiency. After the metal contacts are made, the solar cells are interconnected by flat wires or metal ribbons, and assembled into [[photovoltaic module|modules]] or \"solar panels\". Solar panels have a sheet of [[tempered glass]] on the front, and a [[polymer]] encapsulation on the back.\n\n== Manufacturers and certification ==\n{{Further|List of photovoltaics companies}}\n[[File:SolarCellProduction-E.PNG|thumb|right|190px|Solar cell production by region<ref name=\"pvnews\">[http://www.greentechmedia.com/research/report/pv-news Pv News November 2012].

Individual solar cell devices can be combined to form modules, otherwise known as [[solar panel]]s. The common single junction [[silicon]] solar cell can produce a maximum open-circuit voltage of approximately 0.5 to 0.6 volts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://solarbotics.net/starting/200202_solar_cells/200202_solar_cell_use.html|title=Solar cells \u2013 performance and use|website=solarbotic s.net}}</ref>\n\nSolar cells are described as being [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]], irrespective of whether the source is [[sunlight]] or an artificial light. In addition to producing energy, they can be used as a [[photodetector]] (for example [[infrared detector]]s), detecting light or other [[electromagnetic radiation]] near the visible range, or measuring light intensity.\n\nThe operation of a photovoltaic (PV) cell requires three basic attributes:\n* The absorption of light, generating either [[electron]]-[[Electron hole|hole]] pairs or [[exciton]]s.\n* The separation of [[charge carrier]]s of opposite types.\n* The separate extraction of those carriers to an external circuit.\n\nIn contrast, a [[solar thermal collector]] supplies [[heat]] by [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbing sunlight]], for the purpose of either direct heating or indirect [[electrical power generation]] from heat. A \"photoelectrolytic cell\" ([[photoelectrochemical cell]]), on the other hand, refers either to a type of photovoltaic cell (like that developed by [[Edmond Becquerel]] and modern [[dye-sensitized solar cell]]s), or to a device that [[Water splitting|splits water]] directly into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] using only solar illumination.\n{{TOC_limit|3}}\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:From a solar cell to a PV system.svg|thumb|From a solar cell to a PV system. Diagram of the possible components of a [[photovoltaic system]]]]\n\nAssemblies of solar cells are used to make [[Solar panel|solar modules]] that generate electrical power from [[sunlight]], as distinguished from a \"solar thermal module\" or \"solar hot water panel\". A solar array generates [[solar power]] using [[solar energy]].\n\n=== Cells, modules, panels and systems ===\n{{Main|Photovoltaic system}}\nMultiple solar cells in an integrated group, all oriented in one plane, constitute a [[Solar panel|solar photovoltaic panel or module]]. Photovoltaic modules often have a sheet of glass on the sun-facing side, allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]]. Solar cells are usually connected in [[series and parallel circuits]] or series in modules, creating an additive voltage. Connecting cells in parallel yields a higher current; however, problems such as shadow effects can shut down the weaker (less illuminated) parallel string (a number of series connected cells) causing substantial power loss and possible damage because of the reverse bias applied to the shadowed cells by their illuminated partners. Strings of series cells are usually handled independently and not connected in parallel, though as of 2014, individual [[Electric power conversion|power boxes]] are often supplied for each module, and are connected in parallel. Although modules can be interconnected to create an array with the desired peak DC voltage and loading current capacity, using independent MPPTs ([[Maximum power point tracking|maximum power point trackers]]) is preferable. Otherwise, shunt [[diode]]s can reduce shadowing power loss in arrays with series/parallel connected cells.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: 4px auto 1px auto;\"\n|+ Typical PV system prices in 2013 in selected countries ($/W)\n|-\n!

In 1839, at age 19, he built the world's first photovoltaic cell in his father's laboratory.

For Example, [[Explorer 6]], launched in 1959, had four arrays that folded out once in orbit. They provided power for months in space.]]\nSolar cells were first used in a prominent application when they were proposed and flown on the Vanguard satellite in 1958, as an alternative power source to the [[primary cell|primary battery]] power source. By adding cells to the outside of the body, the mission time could be extended with no major changes to the spacecraft or its power systems. In 1959 the United States launched [[Explorer 6]], featuring large wing-shaped solar arrays, which became a common feature in satellites. These arrays consisted of 9600 [[H. Leslie (Les) Hoffman|Hoffman solar cells]].\n\nBy the 1960s, solar cells were (and still are) the main power source for most Earth orbiting satellites and a number of probes into the solar system, since they offered the best [[power-to-weight ratio]]. However, this success was possible because in the space application, power system costs could be high, because space users had few other power options, and were willing to pay for the best possible cells. The space power market drove the development of higher efficiencies in solar cells up until the [[National Science Foundation]] \"Research Applied to National Needs\" program began to push development of solar cells for terrestrial applications.\n\nIn the early 1990s the technology used for space solar cells diverged from the silicon technology used for terrestrial panels, with the spacecraft application shifting to [[gallium arsenide]]-based III-V semiconductor materials, which then evolved into the modern III-V [[multijunction photovoltaic cell]] used on spacecraft.\n\nIn recent years, research has moved towards designing and manufacturing lightweight, flexible, and highly efficient solar cells. Terrestrial solar cell technology generally uses photovoltaic cells that are laminated with a layer of glass for strength and protection. Space applications for solar cells require that the cells and arrays are both highly efficient and extremely lightweight. Some newer technology implemented on satellites are multi-junction photovoltaic cells, which are composed of different PN junctions with varying bandgaps in order to utilize a wider spectrum of the sun's energy. Additionally, large satellites require the use of large solar arrays to produce electricity. These solar arrays need to be broken down to fit in the geometric constraints of the launch vehicle the satellite travels on before being injected into orbit. Historically, solar cells on satellites consisted of several small terrestrial panels folded together. These small panels would be unfolded into a large panel after the satellite is deployed in its orbit. Newer satellites aim to use flexible rollable solar arrays that are very lightweight and can be packed into a very small volume. The smaller size and weight of these flexible arrays drastically decreases the overall cost of launching a satellite due to the direct relationship between payload weight and launch cost of a launch vehicle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/solar_arrays.html|title=International Space Station Solar Arrays|last=Garcia|first=Mark|date=31 July 2017|website=NASA|access-date=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Price reductions ===\nImprovements were gradual over the 1960s. This was also the reason that costs remained high, because space users were willing to pay for the best possible cells, leaving no reason to invest in lower-cost, less-efficient solutions. The price was determined largely by the [[semiconductor industry]]; their move to [[integrated circuit]]s in the 1960s led to the availability of larger [[Boule (crystal)|boules]] at lower relative prices. As their price fell, the price of the resulting cells did as well. These effects lowered 1971 cell costs to some $100 per watt.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p= 50}}\n\nIn late 1969 Elliot Berman joined [[Exxon]]'s task force which was looking for projects 30 years in the future and in April 1973 he founded Solar Power Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon at that time.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p=53}}<ref name=\"williams 2005\">\n{{cite book\n | first = Neville | last = Williams\n | title = Chasing the Sun: Solar Adventures Around the World\n | url = https://archive.org/details/chasingsunsolara0000will | url-access = registration | year = 2005\n | publisher = [[New Society Publishers]]\n | page = [https://archive.org/details/chasingsunsolara0000will/page/84 84]\n | isbn = 9781550923124}}\n</ref><ref name=jones>\n{{cite book\n | first1 = Geoffrey | last1 = Jones\n | first2 = Loubna | last2 = Bouamane \n | title = \"Power from Sunshine\": A Business History of Solar Energy\n | url = http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/12-105.pdf\n | year = 2012\n | publisher = [[Harvard Business School]]\n | pages = 22\u201323\n }}\n</ref> The group had concluded that electrical power would be much more expensive by 2000, and felt that this increase in price would make alternative energy sources more attractive.

Cell sizes grew as equipment became available on the surplus market; [[ARCO]] Solar's original panels used cells {{convert|2|to|4|in|mm|-1}} in diameter. Panels in the 1990s and early 2000s generally used 125&nbsp;mm wafers; since 2008, almost all new panels use 156&nbsp;mm cells. The widespread introduction of [[flat screen television]]s in the late 1990s and early 2000s led to the wide availability of large, high-quality glass sheets to cover the panels.\n\nDuring the 1990s, [[polysilicon]] (\"poly\") cells became increasingly popular. These cells offer less efficiency than their monosilicon (\"mono\") counterparts, but they are grown in large vats that reduce cost. By the mid-2000s, poly was dominant in the low-cost panel market, but more recently the mono returned to widespread use.\n\nManufacturers of wafer-based cells responded to high silicon prices in 2004\u20132008 with rapid reductions in silicon consumption. In 2008, according to Jef Poortmans, director of [[IMEC]]'s organic and solar department, current cells use {{convert|8|-|9|g|oz}} of silicon per watt of power generation, with wafer thicknesses in the neighborhood of 200&nbsp;[[microns]].

The overall efficiency is the product of these individual metrics.\n\nThe [[Energy conversion efficiency|power conversion efficiency]] of a solar cell is a parameter which is defined by the fraction of incident power converted into electricity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/solar-cell-efficiency|title=Solar Cell Efficiency {{!}} PVEducation|website=www.pveducation.org|access-date=31 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nA solar cell has a voltage dependent efficiency curve, temperature coefficients, and allowable shadow angles.\n\nDue to the difficulty in measuring these parameters directly, other parameters are substituted: thermodynamic efficiency, [[Quantum efficiency of a solar cell|quantum efficiency]], [[Quantum efficiency|integrated quantum efficiency]], [[Open-circuit voltage|V<sub>OC</sub>]] ratio, and fill factor. Reflectance losses are a portion of quantum efficiency under \"[[Quantum efficiency#Types of quantum efficiency|external quantum efficiency]]\". Recombination losses make up another portion of quantum efficiency, V<sub>OC</sub> ratio, and fill factor. Resistive losses are predominantly categorized under fill factor, but also make up minor portions of quantum efficiency, V<sub>OC</sub> ratio.\n\nThe [[Solar cell efficiency#Fill factor|fill factor]] is the ratio of the actual maximum obtainable [[power (physics)|power]] to the product of the [[open circuit voltage]] and [[short circuit current]]. This is a key parameter in evaluating performance. In 2009, typical commercial solar cells had a fill factor > 0.70.

These [[List of semiconductor materials|materials]] must have certain characteristics in order to absorb [[sunlight]]. Some cells are designed to handle sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, while others are optimized for [[Solar panels on spacecraft|use in space]]. Solar cells can be made of only one single layer of light-absorbing material ([[p-n junction|single-junction]]) or use multiple physical configurations ([[multi-junction]]s) to take advantage of various absorption and charge separation mechanisms.\n\nSolar cells can be classified into first, second and third generation cells. The first generation cells\u2014also called conventional, traditional or [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]-based cells\u2014are made of [[crystalline silicon]], the commercially predominant PV technology, that includes materials such as [[polysilicon]] and [[monocrystalline silicon]]. Second generation cells are [[thin film solar cells]], that include [[amorphous silicon]], [[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|CdTe]] and [[Copper indium gallium selenide solar cell|CIGS]] cells and are commercially significant in utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station]]s, [[building integrated photovoltaics]] or in small [[stand-alone power system]]. The [[third-generation photovoltaic cell|third generation of solar cells]] includes a number of thin-film technologies often described as emerging photovoltaics\u2014most of them have not yet been commercially applied and are still in the research or development phase. Many use organic materials, often [[organometallic]] compounds as well as inorganic substances. Despite the fact that their efficiencies had been low and the stability of the absorber material was often too short for commercial applications, there is a lot of research invested into these technologies as they promise to achieve the goal of producing low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.\n\n=== Crystalline silicon ===\n{{Main|Crystalline silicon}}\nBy far, the most prevalent bulk material for solar cells is [[crystalline silicon]] (c-Si), also known as \"solar grade silicon\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Bulk silicon is separated into multiple categories according to crystallinity and crystal size in the resulting [[ingot]], [[ribbon]] or [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]. These cells are entirely based around the concept of a [[p-n junction]].\nSolar cells made of c-Si are made from [[wafer (electronics)|wafers]] between 160 and 240&nbsp;micrometers thick.\n\n==== Monocrystalline silicon ====\n{{Main|Monocrystalline silicon}}\n[[File:Sono Sion Front Back.jpg|thumb|The roof, bonnet and large parts of the outer shell of the [[Sion (electric car)|Sion]] are equipped with highly efficient monocrystalline silicon cells]]\n\n[[Monocrystalline silicon]] (mono-Si) solar cells are more efficient and more expensive than most other types of cells.

Solar panels using mono-Si cells display a distinctive pattern of small white diamonds.\n\n====Epitaxial silicon development====\n[[Epitaxial wafer]]s of crystalline silicon can be grown on a monocrystalline silicon \"seed\" wafer by [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD), and then detached as self-supporting wafers of some standard thickness (e.g., 250&nbsp;\u00b5m) that can be manipulated by hand, and directly substituted for wafer cells cut from monocrystalline silicon ingots.

Based on the previous literature and some theoretical analysis, there are several reasons why GaAs has such high power conversion efficiency. First, GaAs bandgap is 1.43ev which is almost ideal for solar cells. Second, because Gallium is a by-product of the smelting of other metals, GaAs cells are relatively insensitive to heat and it can keep high efficiency when temperature is quite high. Third, GaAs has the wide range of design options. Using GaAs as active layer in solar cell, engineers can have multiple choices of other layers which can better generate electrons and holes in GaAs.\n\n=== Multijunction cells ===\n{{Main|Multi-junction solar cell}}\n[[File:Dawn solar panel.jpg|thumb|[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'s 10&nbsp;[[Kilowatt|kW]] triple-junction gallium arsenide solar array at full extension]]\n\nMulti-junction cells consist of multiple thin films, each essentially a solar cell grown on top of another, typically using [[metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy]].

Either of these techniques could be used to produce higher efficiency solar cells by allowing solar photons to be more efficiently used. The difficulty, however, is that the conversion efficiency of existing [[phosphor]]s exhibiting up- or down-conversion is low, and is typically narrow band.\n\nOne upconversion technique is to incorporate [[lanthanide]]-doped materials ([[Erbium|{{chem|Er|3+}}]], [[Ytterbium|{{chem|Yb|3+}}]], [[Holmium|{{chem|Ho|3+}}]] or a combination), taking advantage of their [[luminescence]] to convert [[infrared radiation]] to visible light. Upconversion process occurs when two [[infrared]] photons are absorbed by [[rare-earth]] [[ion]]s to generate a (high-energy) absorbable photon. As example, the energy transfer upconversion process (ETU), consists in successive transfer processes between excited ions in the near infrared. The upconverter material could be placed below the solar cell to absorb the infrared light that passes through the silicon. Useful ions are most commonly found in the trivalent state. {{chem|Er|+}} ions have been the most used. {{chem|Er|3+}} ions absorb solar radiation around 1.54&nbsp;\u00b5m. Two {{chem|Er|3+}} ions that have absorbed this radiation can interact with each other through an upconversion process. The excited ion emits light above the Si bandgap that is absorbed by the solar cell and creates an additional electron\u2013hole pair that can generate current. However, the increased efficiency was small. In addition, fluoroindate glasses have low [[phonon]] energy and have been proposed as suitable matrix doped with {{chem|Ho|3+}} ions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hern\u00e1ndez-Rodr\u00edguez|first=M.A.|author2=Imanieh, M.H. |author3=Mart\u00edn, L.L. |author4= Mart\u00edn, I.R. |title=Experimental enhancement of the photocurrent in a solar cell using upconversion process in fluoroindate glasses exciting at 1480nm|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|date=September 2013|volume=116|pages=171\u2013175|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2013.04.023}}</ref>\n\n=== Light-absorbing dyes ===\n{{Main|Dye-sensitized solar cell|l1=Dye-sensitized solar cells}}\n[[Dye-sensitized solar cell]]s (DSSCs) are made of low-cost materials and do not need elaborate manufacturing equipment, so they can be made in a [[Do it yourself|DIY]] fashion. In bulk it should be significantly less expensive than older [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] cell designs. DSSC's can be engineered into flexible sheets and although its [[conversion efficiency]] is less than the best [[thin film cell]]s, its [[price/performance ratio]] may be high enough to allow them to compete with [[fossil fuel electrical generation]].\n\nTypically a [[ruthenium]] [[Metalorganics|metalorganic]] [[dye]] (Ru-centered) is used as a [[monolayer]] of light-absorbing material. The dye-sensitized solar cell depends on a [[mesoporous]] layer of [[nanoparticulate]] [[titanium dioxide]] to greatly amplify the surface area (200\u2013300 m<sup>2</sup>/g {{chem|TiO|2}}, as compared to approximately 10 m<sup>2</sup>/g of flat single crystal). The photogenerated electrons from the light absorbing dye are passed on to the n-type {{chem|TiO|2}} and the holes are absorbed by an [[electrolyte]] on the other side of the dye. The circuit is completed by a [[redox]] couple in the electrolyte, which can be liquid or solid. This type of cell allows more flexible use of materials and is typically manufactured by [[screen printing]] or [[ultrasonic nozzle]]s, with the potential for lower processing costs than those used for bulk solar cells. However, the dyes in these cells also suffer from [[chemical decomposition|degradation]] under heat and [[UV]] light and the cell casing is difficult to [[Seal (mechanical)|seal]] due to the solvents used in assembly.

An adaptive material responds to the intensity and angle of incident light. At the part of the cell where the light is most intense, the cell surface changes from reflective to adaptive, allowing the light to penetrate the cell. The other parts of the cell remain reflective increasing the retention of the absorbed light within the cell.<ref name=tr1407>Bullis, Kevin (30 July 2014) [http://www.technologyreview.com/news/529476/adaptive-material-could-cut-the-cost-of-solar-in-half Adaptive Material Could Cut the Cost of Solar in Half]. ''MIT Technology Review''</ref>\n\nIn 2014, a system was developed that combined an adaptive surface with a glass substrate that redirect the absorbed to a light absorber on the edges of the sheet. The system also includes an array of fixed lenses/mirrors to concentrate light onto the adaptive surface. As the day continues, the concentrated light moves along the surface of the cell. That surface switches from reflective to adaptive when the light is most concentrated and back to reflective after the light moves along.<ref name=tr1407/>\n\n=== Surface texturing ===\n[[File:SolarImpulse HB-SIA landing Brussels Airport 3-crop.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Solar Impulse]] aircraft are Swiss-designed single-seat monoplanes powered entirely from photovoltaic cells]]\n\nFor the past years, researchers have been trying to reduce the price of solar cells while maximizing efficiency. [[Thin-film solar cell]] is a cost-effective second generation solar cell with much reduced thickness at the expense of light absorption efficiency. Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Patrick|author2=Green, Martin A. |title=Light Trapping Properties of Pyramidally textured surfaces|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=Feb 1987|volume=62|issue=1| pages=243\u2013249|doi=10.1063/1.339189|bibcode=1987JAP....62..243C}}</ref> Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids.

This texture effect as well as the interaction with other interfaces in the PV module is a challenging optical simulation task.

The encapsulants are commonly made from [[polyvinyl acetate]] or glass. Most encapsulants are uniform in structure and composition, which increases light collection owing to light trapping from total internal reflection of light within the resin.

However, the strict requirements for cleanliness and quality control of semiconductor fabrication are more relaxed for solar cells, lowering costs.\n\n[[Polycrystalline silicon]] wafers are made by wire-sawing block-cast silicon ingots into 180 to 350 micrometer wafers. The wafers are usually lightly [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]]-doped. A surface diffusion of [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] dopants is performed on the front side of the wafer. This forms a p\u2013n junction a few hundred nanometers below the surface.\n\n[[Anti-reflective coating|Anti-reflection coatings]] are then typically applied to increase the amount of light coupled into the solar cell. [[Silicon nitride]] has gradually replaced titanium dioxide as the preferred material, because of its excellent surface passivation qualities. It prevents carrier recombination at the cell surface. A layer several hundred nanometers thick is applied using PECVD. Some solar cells have textured front surfaces that, like anti-reflection coatings, increase the amount of light reaching the wafer. Such surfaces were first applied to single-crystal silicon, followed by multicrystalline silicon somewhat later.\n\nA full area metal contact is made on the back surface, and a grid-like metal contact made up of fine \"fingers\" and larger \"bus bars\" are screen-printed onto the front surface using a [[silver]] paste. This is an evolution of the so-called \"wet\" process for applying electrodes, first described in a US patent filed in 1981 by [[Bayer AG]].<ref>Fitzky, Hans G. and Ebneth, Harold (24 May 1983) {{US patent|4385102}}, \"Large-area photovoltaic cell\"</ref> The rear contact is formed by screen-printing a metal paste, typically aluminium. Usually this contact covers the entire rear, though some designs employ a grid pattern. The paste is then fired at several hundred degrees Celsius to form metal electrodes in [[ohmic contact]] with the silicon. Some companies use an additional electro-plating step to increase efficiency. After the metal contacts are made, the solar cells are interconnected by flat wires or metal ribbons, and assembled into [[photovoltaic module|modules]] or \"solar panels\". Solar panels have a sheet of [[tempered glass]] on the front, and a [[polymer]] encapsulation on the back.\n\n== Manufacturers and certification ==\n{{Further|List of photovoltaics companies}}\n[[File:SolarCellProduction-E.PNG|thumb|right|190px|Solar cell production by region<ref name=\"pvnews\">[http://www.greentechmedia.com/research/report/pv-news Pv News November 2012].

The [[Old High German]] form of the name is recorded as ''Hessun'' (dative plural of ''Hessi''), in [[Middle Latin]] as ''Hassia'', ''Hessia'', ''Hassonia''. The name of the Hessians ultimately continues the tribal name of the ''[[Chatti]]''.<ref>[[Gudmund Sch\u00fctte]], ''Our forefathers : The Gothonic nations : A manual of the ethnography of the Gothic, German, Dutch, Anglo-Saxon, Frisian and Scandinavian peoples'', vol. 2 (1933), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=0R9aAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA191 p. 191].</ref>\nThe ancient name ''Chatti'' by the 7th century is recorded as ''Chassi'', and from the 8th century as ''Hassi'' or ''Hessi''.<ref>\nChristian Presche, ''Kassel im Mittelalter: Zur Stadtentwicklung bis 1367'' vol. 1 (2013), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=5ZfbAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41 p. 41].</ref>\n\nAn inhabitant of Hessen is called a \"Hessian\" (German: ''[[:wikt:Hesse#German|Hesse]]'' (masculine) or ''Hessin'' (feminine), plural ''Hessen''). \nThe [[American English]] term [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian]] for 18th-century British auxiliary troops originates with Landgrave [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse|Frederick II]] of [[Landgraviate of Hessen-Kassel|Hessen-Cassel]] hiring out regular army units to the government of Great Britain to fight in the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\nThe English form ''Hesse'' was in common use by the 18th century, first in the hyphenated names ''Hesse-Cassel'' and ''Hesse-Darmstadt'', but the latinate form ''Hessia'' remained in common English usage well into the 19th century.<ref>\"The Hessians, called, in the early history of Germany, Catti, lived in the present Hessia\".

It corresponds only loosely to the medieval [[Landgraviate of Hessen]].\nIn the 19th century, prior to the [[unification of Germany]], the territory of what is now Hesse comprised the territories of [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]], the [[Duchy of Nassau]], the free city of [[Frankfurt]] and the [[Electorate of Hesse]] (also known as Hesse-Cassel). \n\n=== Early history ===\n{{see|Chatti|Austrasia}}\nThe Central Hessian region was inhabited in the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. \nFinds of tools in southern Hesse in R\u00fcsselsheim suggest the presence of Pleistocene hunters about 13,000 years ago. A [[Rh\u00fcnda Skull|fossil hominid skull]] that was found in northern Hesse, just outside the village of Rh\u00fcnda, has been dated at 12,000 years ago.\nThe [[Z\u00fcschen (megalithic tomb)|Z\u00fcschen tomb]] (German: Steinkammergrab von Z\u00fcschen, sometimes also Lohne-Z\u00fcschen) is a prehistoric burial monument, located between [[Lohne, Germany|Lohne]] and [[Z\u00fcschen, Fritzlar|Z\u00fcschen]], near [[Fritzlar]], Hesse, Germany. Classified as a gallery grave or a Hessian-Westphalian stone [[cist]] (''hessisch-westf\u00e4lische Steinkiste''), it is one of the most important [[megalithic]] monuments in Central Europe. Dating to c. 3000 BC, it belongs to the Late [[Neolithic]] [[Wartberg culture]].\n\nAn early [[Celt]]ic presence in what is now Hesse is indicated by a mid-5th-century BC [[La T\u00e8ne]]-style burial uncovered at [[Glauberg]]. The region was later settled by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Chatti]] tribe around the 1st century BC, and the name ''Hesse'' is a continuation of that tribal name.\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had a military camp in Dorlar, and in Waldgirmes directly on the eastern outskirts of Wetzlar was a civil settlement under construction. Presumably, the provincial government for the occupied territories of the right bank of Germania was planned at this location. The governor of Germania, at least temporarily, likely had resided here. The settlement appears to have been abandoned by the Romans after the devastating [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] failed in the year AD 9. The Chatti were also involved in the [[Revolt of the Batavi]] in AD 69.\n\nHessia, from the early 7th century on, served as a buffer between areas dominated by the [[Saxons]] (to the north) and the [[Franks]], who brought the area to the south under their control in the early sixth century and occupied [[Thuringia]] (to the east) in 531.<ref>Clay 125-27, 137-39.</ref> Hessia occupies the northwestern part of the modern German state of Hesse; its borders were not clearly delineated. Its geographic center is [[Fritzlar]]; it extends in the southeast to [[Hersfeld]] on the Fulda River, in the north to past [[Kassel]] and up to the rivers Diemel and Weser. To the west, it occupies the valleys of the Rivers Eder and Lahn (the latter until it turns south). It measured roughly 90 kilometers north-south, and 80 north-west.<ref>Clay 120.</ref>\n\nThe area around Fritzlar shows evidence of significant pagan belief from the 1st century on. Geismar was a particular focus of such activity; it was continuously occupied from the Roman period on, with a settlement from the Roman period, which itself had a predecessor from the 5th century BC. Excavations have produced a [[horse burial]] and bronze artifacts. A possible religious cult may have centered on a natural spring in Geismar, called ''Heilgenbron''; the name \"Geismar\" (possibly \"energetic pool\") itself may be derived from that spring. \nThe village of {{Interlanguage link multi|Maden, Gudensberg|de|3=Maden (Gudensberg)}}, now a part of [[Gudensberg]] near Fritzlar and less than ten miles from Geismar, was likely an ancient religious center; the basaltic outcrop of Gudensberg is named after Wodan, and a two-meter tall [[quartzite]] [[megalith]] called the ''[[Wotanstein (Hesse)|Wotanstein]]'' is at the center of the village.<ref>Clay 132\u2013137.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-7th century, the Franks had established themselves as overlords, which is suggested by archeological evidence of burials, and they built fortifications in various places, including [[Christenberg]].<ref>Clay 143\u2013155.</ref> By 690, they took direct control over Hessia, apparently to counteract expansion by the Saxons, who built fortifications in [[Diemelstadt|Gaulskopf]] and [[Eresburg]] across the River Diemel, the northern boundary of Hessia. The [[B\u00fcraburg]] (which already had a Frankish settlement in the sixth century<ref>Rau 141.</ref>) was one of the places the Franks fortified to resist the Saxon pressure, and according to John-Henry Clay, the B\u00fcraburg was \"probably the largest man-made construction seen in Hessia for at least seven hundred years\". Walls and trenches totaling one kilometer in length were made, and they enclosed \"8 hectares of a spur that offered a commanding view over Fritzlar and the densely-populated heart of Hessia\".<ref>Clay 157\u2013158.</ref>\n\nFollowing Saxon incursions into Chattish territory in the 7th century, two ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|gau]]e'' had been established; a Frankish one, comprising an area around [[Fritzlar]] and [[Kassel]], and a Saxonian one. In the 9th century, the Saxon [[Hessengau]] also came under the rule of the Franconians.\n\n=== Holy Roman Empire ===\n{{see|Duchy of Franconia|Duchy of Thuringia|Landgraviate of Hesse|Free City of Frankfurt|Upper Rhenish Circle|Hesse-Marburg|Hesse-Rheinfels|Hesse-Homburg|Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt}}\n{{see|Ludovingians|House of Hesse|List of rulers of Hesse}}\n[[File:COA family de Landgrafen von Hessen.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|The Ludovingian coat of arms with its ''lion rampant barry argent and gules'', the so-called [[Coat of arms of Hesse|lion of Hesse]]]]\nIn the 12th century, [[Hessengau]] was passed to [[Thuringia]].\nIn the [[War of the Thuringian Succession]] (1247\u20131264), Hesse gained independence and became a [[Landgraviate of Hesse|Landgraviate]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It shortly rose to primary importance under Landgrave [[Philipp I of Hesse|Philip the Magnanimous]], who was one of the leaders of German [[Protestantism]]. After Philip's death in 1567, the territory was divided among his four sons from his first marriage (Philip was a [[Polygamy|bigamist]]) into four lines: [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel), [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]], [[Hesse-Rheinfels]], and the also previously existing [[Hesse-Marburg]]. As the latter two lines died out quite soon (1583 and 1605, respectively), Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Darmstadt were the two core states within the Hessian lands. Several collateral lines split off during the centuries, such as in 1622, when [[Hesse-Homburg]] split off from Hesse-Darmstadt. In the late 16th century, Kassel adopted [[Calvinism]], while Darmstadt remained [[Lutheran]] and subsequently the two lines often found themselves on different sides of a conflict, most notably in the disputes over Hesse-Marburg and in the [[Thirty Years' War]], when Darmstadt fought on the side of the Emperor, while Kassel sided with [[Sweden]] and [[kingdom of France|France]].\n\n[[File:Hessen-Darmstadt Landgrafschaft-Wappen.png|thumb|upright=0.6|Coat of arms of Hesse-Darmstadt]]\nThe Landgrave [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel|Frederick II]] (1720\u20131785) ruled as a benevolent despot, from 1760 to 1785. He combined [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment ideas]] with Christian values, [[Cameralism|cameralist]] plans for central control of the economy, and a militaristic approach toward diplomacy.<ref>Charles W. Ingrao, ''The Hessian Mercenary State: Ideas, Institutions, and Reform under Frederick II, 1760\u20131785'' (2003)</ref> He funded the depleted treasury of the poor nation by loaning 19,000 soldiers in complete military formations to [[Great Britain]] to fight in North America during the [[American Revolutionary War]], 1776\u20131783. These soldiers, commonly known as [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessians]], fought under the British flag. The British used the Hessians in several conflicts, including in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. For further revenue, the soldiers were loaned to other places as well. Most were conscripted, with their pay going to the Landgrave.\n\n=== Modern history ===\n{{see|Electorate of Hesse|Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Nassau|People's State of Hesse|Province of Kurhessen|Greater Hesse}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Grand Duchy of Hesse 1806-1918.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|Coat of arms of the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]]]\nThe ruler of [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] was elevated to the status of [[Prince-Elector]] in 1803, but this remained without effect, as the Holy Roman Empire was disbanded in 1806. The territory was annexed by Napoleon to the Kingdom of [[Westphalia]] in 1806, but restored to the Elector in 1813. While other Electors had gained other titles, becoming either Kings or Grand Dukes, the Elector of Hesse-Kassel alone retained the anachronistic title. The name survived in the term ''Kurhessen'', denoting the region around Kassel. In 1866, it was annexed by [[Prussia]], together with the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], the small [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg]], and the [[Duchy of Nassau]], which were then combined into the province of [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\n[[Hesse-Darmstadt]] was elevated by Napoleon to the status of a Grand Duchy in 1806, becoming the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]. In the [[War of 1866]], it fought on the side of [[Austria]] against [[Prussia]], but retained its autonomy in defeat because a greater part of the country was situated south of the [[Main River]] and Prussia did not dare to expand beyond the Main line, as this might have provoked France. However, the parts of Hesse-Darmstadt north of the Main (the region around the town of [[Gie\u00dfen]], commonly called ''Oberhessen'') were incorporated in the [[Norddeutscher Bund]], a tight federation of German states, established by Prussia in 1867. In 1871, after France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the rest of the Grand Duchy joined the [[German Empire]]. Around the turn of the 20th century, Darmstadt was one of the centres of the [[Jugendstil]]. Until 1907, the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]] used the Hessian red and white lion as its coat-of-arms.\n\nThe revolution of 1918 transformed Hesse-Darmstadt from a monarchy to a republic, which officially renamed itself \"[[Volksstaat Hessen]]\" (People's State of Hesse). The parts of Hesse-Darmstadt on the western banks of the Rhine (province Rheinhessen) were occupied by French troops until 1930 under the terms of the Versailles peace treaty that officially ended World War I in 1919. In 1929 the [[Principality of Waldeck]] was dissolved and incorporated into [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the Hessian territory west of the Rhine was again occupied by France, whereas the rest of the region was part of the US occupation zone. The French separated their part of Hesse from the rest of the region and incorporated it into the newly founded state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] (Rheinland-Pfalz). The United States, on the other side, proclaimed the state of [[Greater Hesse]] (''Gro\u00df-Hessen'') on 19 September 1945, out of Hesse-Darmstadt and most of the former Prussian province of [[Province of Hesse-Nassau|Hesse-Nassau]]. \n\nOn 4 December 1946 Gro\u00df-Hessen was officially renamed Hessen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://60stolzejahre.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dssid=77&dsmid=1898 |title=Hessen - 60 stolze Jahre - Zeittafel 1945/1946 |accessdate=2006-12-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017144544/http://60stolzejahre.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dssid=77&dsmid=1898 |archivedate=2006-10-17 }}</ref>\nHesse in the 1940s received more than a million [[Heimatvertriebene|displaced ethnic Germans]].\nDue to its proximity to the [[Inner German border]], Hesse became an important location of [[NATO]] installations in the 1950s, especially military bases of the US [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]] and [[United States Army Europe]]. \nThe first elected minister president of Hesse was [[Christian Stock]], followed by [[Georg-August Zinn]] (both Social Democrats). The German Social Democrats gained an absolute majority in 1962 and pursued progressive policies with the so-called ''Gro\u00dfer Hessenplan''. The [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] gained a relative majority in the 1974 elections, but the Social Democrats continued to govern in a coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]. Hesse was first governed by the CDU under [[Walter Wallmann]] during 1987\u20131991, replaced by a SPD-Greens coalition under [[Hans Eichel]] during 1991\u20131999. From 1999, Hesse was governed by the CDU under [[Roland Koch]] (retired 2010) and [[Volker Bouffier]] (incumbent as of 2019).\n[[Frankfurt]] during the 1960s to 1990s developed into one of the major cities of West Germany. As of 2016, 12% of the total population of Hesse lived in the city of Frankfurt.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{See also|List of places in Hesse|List of mountains of Hesse}}\n[[File:Hessen topografisch Relief Karte.png|thumb|upright=1.05|The most important rivers, mountains, and cities of Hesse]]\n\nSituated in west-central Germany, The state of Hesse borders the German states of (starting in the north and proceeding clockwise) [[Lower Saxony]], [[Thuringia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].\n\nMost of the population of Hesse lives in the southern part, in the [[Frankfurt Rhein-Main Region|Rhine Main Area]]. The principal cities of the area include [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Wiesbaden]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Offenbach, Hesse|Offenbach]], [[Hanau]], [[Gie\u00dfen]], [[Wetzlar]], and [[Limburg an der Lahn|Limburg]]. Other major towns in Hesse are [[Fulda]] in the [[East Hesse|east]], and [[Kassel]] and [[Marburg an der Lahn]] in the [[North Hesse|north]]. The densely populated Rhine-Main region is much better developed than the rural areas in the middle and northern parts of Hesse.\n\nThe most important rivers in Hesse are the [[Fulda River|Fulda]] and [[Eder]] Rivers in the north, the [[Lahn]] in the central part of Hesse, and the [[Main (river)|Main]] and [[Rhine]] in the south. The countryside is hilly and the numerous mountain ranges include the [[Rh\u00f6n]], the [[Westerwald]], the [[Taunus]], the [[Vogelsberg Mountains|Vogelsberg]], the [[Kn\u00fcll]] and the [[Spessart]].\n\nThe Rhine borders Hesse on the southwest without running through the state, only one [[oxbow lake]] \u2014\u2013 the so-called Alt-Rhein \u2014\u2013 runs through Hesse. The mountain range between the Main and the Neckar Rivers is called the [[Odenwald]]. The plain between the rivers Main, Rhine, and Neckar, and the Odenwald Mountains is called the Ried.\n\nHesse is the greenest state in Germany, as forest covers 42% of the state.<ref name=\"HesseGeography\">{{cite web|title=Our State|url=http://www.hessen.eu/irj/hessen_en_Internet?cid=42734bf7b41385446b3a113d3314add9|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130106184553/http://www.hessen.eu/irj/hessen_en_Internet?cid=42734bf7b41385446b3a113d3314add9|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 January 2013|publisher=State of Hesse|accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Administration ==\nHesse is a [[unitary state]] governed directly by the [[Landtag of Hesse|Hessian government]] in the capital city Wiesbaden, partially through regional vicarious authorities called ''Regierungspr\u00e4sidien''. Municipal parliaments are, however, elected independently from the state government by the Hessian people. Local municipalities enjoy a considerable degree of [[home rule]].\n\n=== Districts ===\nThe state is divided into three administrative provinces (''Regierungsbezirke''): [[Kassel (region)|Kassel]] in the north and east, [[Gie\u00dfen (region)|Gie\u00dfen]] in the centre, and [[Darmstadt (region)|Darmstadt]] in the south, the latter being the most populous region with the [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main]] agglomeration in its central area.

It has not been part of the State of Hesse since 1946 due to divisions in the aftermath of World War II. This province is now part of the State of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. It is a hilly countryside largely devoted to vineyards; therefore, it is also called the \"land of the thousand hills\". Its larger towns include [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]], [[Alzey]], [[Nieder-Olm]], and [[Ingelheim]]. Many inhabitants commute to work in Mainz, Wiesbaden, or Frankfurt.\n\n== State symbols and politics ==\n{{Main article|Politics of Hesse}}\n\nHesse has been a parliamentary republic since 1918, except during [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]] (1933\u20131945). The German federal system has elements of exclusive federal competences, shared competences, and exclusive competences of the federal states. Hesse is famous for having a rather brisk style in its politics with the ruling parties being either the center-right [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) or the center-left [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). Due to the Hessian electoral laws, the biggest party normally needs a smaller coalition partner.\n\n=== Head of state ===\nAs Hesse is a federal state, its constitution combines the offices of the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] in one office called the [[Minister-president|Minister-President]] (German: ''Ministerpr\u00e4sident'') which is comparable to the office of a [[prime minister]].\n\n=== Most recent state election ===\nIn the [[Hessian_state_election,_2018|2018 state elections]] the two leading parties, CDU and SPD, lost 11.3% (7 seats) and 10.9% (8 seats) of the vote respectively. The Green party, a member of Hesse's previous governing coalition with CDU, gained 8.7% (16 seats). The largest gains during the election were made by [[Alternative for Germany]] (AfD) at 13.1%. As AfD had not passed the 5% threshold in the [[Hessian_state_election,_2013|2013 state election]], this marked its first entry into the [[Landtag of Hesse|Hessian parliament]] (''Hessischer Landtag''). The two other parties also made gains. The major losses of the two leading parties (whose [[Grand_coalition_(Germany)|coalition]] made up the federal cabinet during the election) closely mirrors the results of the [[Bavarian_state_election,_2018|2018 state elections in Bavaria]]. In the current parliament the conservative CDU holds a 40 seats, the centre-left SPD and the leftist Green party each hold 29 seats, the right-wing AfD holds 19 seats, the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] party holds 11 seats and the socialist party [[The Left (Germany)|Die Linke]] holds 9 seats.\n\n[[File:Landtag of Hesse 2018.svg|thumb|The Hessian parliament as of the 2018 election]]\n\n=== Foreign affairs ===\nAs a member state of the German federation, Hesse does not have a diplomatic service of its own. However, Hesse operates representation offices in such foreign countries as the United States, China, Hungary, Cuba, Russia, Poland, and Iran. These offices are mostly used to represent Hessian interests in cultural and economic affairs. Hesse has also permanent representation offices in Berlin at the [[federal government of Germany]] and in [[Brussels]] at the [[European Union]].<ref>State of Hessen. Foreign representation offices.

The Frankfurt Central Station is the most important hub for German trains, with over 1,100 trains per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2817|title=Bahn|website=Frankfurt am Main|accessdate=5 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905175904/https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2817|archive-date=5 September 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe region around Frankfurt has an extensive [[S-Bahn]] network, the [[S-Bahn Rhein-Main]], which is complemented by many regional train connections. In the rest of the country, the rail network is less extensive. Since 2007, the region around Kassel has been served by the [[RegioTram Kassel|RegioTram]], a [[tram-train]]-concept similar to the [[Karlsruhe model]].\n\n=== Air transport ===\n[[Frankfurt Airport]] is by far the largest airport in Germany with more than 57 million passengers each year, is and among the world's ten largest. [[Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport]] lies to the south, and is frequented by [[general aviation]] and private planes. [[Kassel Airport]] offers a few flights to holiday destinations, but has struggled to compete. There are also a number of sports airfields. [[Low-cost airline]]s, especially [[Ryanair]], use [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport]] as a major base, although the airport is actually located about 100&nbsp;km from Frankfurt in the neighbouring state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. The DFS ([[Deutsche Flugsicherung|German air traffic control]]) has its headquarters in [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]].\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* Ingrao, Charles W.

The [[Old High German]] form of the name is recorded as ''Hessun'' (dative plural of ''Hessi''), in [[Middle Latin]] as ''Hassia'', ''Hessia'', ''Hassonia''. The name of the Hessians ultimately continues the tribal name of the ''[[Chatti]]''.<ref>[[Gudmund Sch\u00fctte]], ''Our forefathers : The Gothonic nations : A manual of the ethnography of the Gothic, German, Dutch, Anglo-Saxon, Frisian and Scandinavian peoples'', vol. 2 (1933), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=0R9aAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA191 p. 191].</ref>\nThe ancient name ''Chatti'' by the 7th century is recorded as ''Chassi'', and from the 8th century as ''Hassi'' or ''Hessi''.<ref>\nChristian Presche, ''Kassel im Mittelalter: Zur Stadtentwicklung bis 1367'' vol. 1 (2013), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=5ZfbAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41 p. 41].</ref>\n\nAn inhabitant of Hessen is called a \"Hessian\" (German: ''[[:wikt:Hesse#German|Hesse]]'' (masculine) or ''Hessin'' (feminine), plural ''Hessen''). \nThe [[American English]] term [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian]] for 18th-century British auxiliary troops originates with Landgrave [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse|Frederick II]] of [[Landgraviate of Hessen-Kassel|Hessen-Cassel]] hiring out regular army units to the government of Great Britain to fight in the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\nThe English form ''Hesse'' was in common use by the 18th century, first in the hyphenated names ''Hesse-Cassel'' and ''Hesse-Darmstadt'', but the latinate form ''Hessia'' remained in common English usage well into the 19th century.<ref>\"The Hessians, called, in the early history of Germany, Catti, lived in the present Hessia\".

It corresponds only loosely to the medieval [[Landgraviate of Hessen]].\nIn the 19th century, prior to the [[unification of Germany]], the territory of what is now Hesse comprised the territories of [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]], the [[Duchy of Nassau]], the free city of [[Frankfurt]] and the [[Electorate of Hesse]] (also known as Hesse-Cassel). \n\n=== Early history ===\n{{see|Chatti|Austrasia}}\nThe Central Hessian region was inhabited in the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. \nFinds of tools in southern Hesse in R\u00fcsselsheim suggest the presence of Pleistocene hunters about 13,000 years ago. A [[Rh\u00fcnda Skull|fossil hominid skull]] that was found in northern Hesse, just outside the village of Rh\u00fcnda, has been dated at 12,000 years ago.\nThe [[Z\u00fcschen (megalithic tomb)|Z\u00fcschen tomb]] (German: Steinkammergrab von Z\u00fcschen, sometimes also Lohne-Z\u00fcschen) is a prehistoric burial monument, located between [[Lohne, Germany|Lohne]] and [[Z\u00fcschen, Fritzlar|Z\u00fcschen]], near [[Fritzlar]], Hesse, Germany. Classified as a gallery grave or a Hessian-Westphalian stone [[cist]] (''hessisch-westf\u00e4lische Steinkiste''), it is one of the most important [[megalithic]] monuments in Central Europe. Dating to c. 3000 BC, it belongs to the Late [[Neolithic]] [[Wartberg culture]].\n\nAn early [[Celt]]ic presence in what is now Hesse is indicated by a mid-5th-century BC [[La T\u00e8ne]]-style burial uncovered at [[Glauberg]]. The region was later settled by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Chatti]] tribe around the 1st century BC, and the name ''Hesse'' is a continuation of that tribal name.\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had a military camp in Dorlar, and in Waldgirmes directly on the eastern outskirts of Wetzlar was a civil settlement under construction. Presumably, the provincial government for the occupied territories of the right bank of Germania was planned at this location. The governor of Germania, at least temporarily, likely had resided here. The settlement appears to have been abandoned by the Romans after the devastating [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] failed in the year AD 9. The Chatti were also involved in the [[Revolt of the Batavi]] in AD 69.\n\nHessia, from the early 7th century on, served as a buffer between areas dominated by the [[Saxons]] (to the north) and the [[Franks]], who brought the area to the south under their control in the early sixth century and occupied [[Thuringia]] (to the east) in 531.<ref>Clay 125-27, 137-39.</ref> Hessia occupies the northwestern part of the modern German state of Hesse; its borders were not clearly delineated. Its geographic center is [[Fritzlar]]; it extends in the southeast to [[Hersfeld]] on the Fulda River, in the north to past [[Kassel]] and up to the rivers Diemel and Weser. To the west, it occupies the valleys of the Rivers Eder and Lahn (the latter until it turns south). It measured roughly 90 kilometers north-south, and 80 north-west.<ref>Clay 120.</ref>\n\nThe area around Fritzlar shows evidence of significant pagan belief from the 1st century on. Geismar was a particular focus of such activity; it was continuously occupied from the Roman period on, with a settlement from the Roman period, which itself had a predecessor from the 5th century BC. Excavations have produced a [[horse burial]] and bronze artifacts. A possible religious cult may have centered on a natural spring in Geismar, called ''Heilgenbron''; the name \"Geismar\" (possibly \"energetic pool\") itself may be derived from that spring. \nThe village of {{Interlanguage link multi|Maden, Gudensberg|de|3=Maden (Gudensberg)}}, now a part of [[Gudensberg]] near Fritzlar and less than ten miles from Geismar, was likely an ancient religious center; the basaltic outcrop of Gudensberg is named after Wodan, and a two-meter tall [[quartzite]] [[megalith]] called the ''[[Wotanstein (Hesse)|Wotanstein]]'' is at the center of the village.<ref>Clay 132\u2013137.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-7th century, the Franks had established themselves as overlords, which is suggested by archeological evidence of burials, and they built fortifications in various places, including [[Christenberg]].<ref>Clay 143\u2013155.</ref> By 690, they took direct control over Hessia, apparently to counteract expansion by the Saxons, who built fortifications in [[Diemelstadt|Gaulskopf]] and [[Eresburg]] across the River Diemel, the northern boundary of Hessia. The [[B\u00fcraburg]] (which already had a Frankish settlement in the sixth century<ref>Rau 141.</ref>) was one of the places the Franks fortified to resist the Saxon pressure, and according to John-Henry Clay, the B\u00fcraburg was \"probably the largest man-made construction seen in Hessia for at least seven hundred years\". Walls and trenches totaling one kilometer in length were made, and they enclosed \"8 hectares of a spur that offered a commanding view over Fritzlar and the densely-populated heart of Hessia\".<ref>Clay 157\u2013158.</ref>\n\nFollowing Saxon incursions into Chattish territory in the 7th century, two ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|gau]]e'' had been established; a Frankish one, comprising an area around [[Fritzlar]] and [[Kassel]], and a Saxonian one. In the 9th century, the Saxon [[Hessengau]] also came under the rule of the Franconians.\n\n=== Holy Roman Empire ===\n{{see|Duchy of Franconia|Duchy of Thuringia|Landgraviate of Hesse|Free City of Frankfurt|Upper Rhenish Circle|Hesse-Marburg|Hesse-Rheinfels|Hesse-Homburg|Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt}}\n{{see|Ludovingians|House of Hesse|List of rulers of Hesse}}\n[[File:COA family de Landgrafen von Hessen.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|The Ludovingian coat of arms with its ''lion rampant barry argent and gules'', the so-called [[Coat of arms of Hesse|lion of Hesse]]]]\nIn the 12th century, [[Hessengau]] was passed to [[Thuringia]].\nIn the [[War of the Thuringian Succession]] (1247\u20131264), Hesse gained independence and became a [[Landgraviate of Hesse|Landgraviate]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It shortly rose to primary importance under Landgrave [[Philipp I of Hesse|Philip the Magnanimous]], who was one of the leaders of German [[Protestantism]]. After Philip's death in 1567, the territory was divided among his four sons from his first marriage (Philip was a [[Polygamy|bigamist]]) into four lines: [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel), [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]], [[Hesse-Rheinfels]], and the also previously existing [[Hesse-Marburg]]. As the latter two lines died out quite soon (1583 and 1605, respectively), Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Darmstadt were the two core states within the Hessian lands. Several collateral lines split off during the centuries, such as in 1622, when [[Hesse-Homburg]] split off from Hesse-Darmstadt. In the late 16th century, Kassel adopted [[Calvinism]], while Darmstadt remained [[Lutheran]] and subsequently the two lines often found themselves on different sides of a conflict, most notably in the disputes over Hesse-Marburg and in the [[Thirty Years' War]], when Darmstadt fought on the side of the Emperor, while Kassel sided with [[Sweden]] and [[kingdom of France|France]].\n\n[[File:Hessen-Darmstadt Landgrafschaft-Wappen.png|thumb|upright=0.6|Coat of arms of Hesse-Darmstadt]]\nThe Landgrave [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel|Frederick II]] (1720\u20131785) ruled as a benevolent despot, from 1760 to 1785. He combined [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment ideas]] with Christian values, [[Cameralism|cameralist]] plans for central control of the economy, and a militaristic approach toward diplomacy.<ref>Charles W. Ingrao, ''The Hessian Mercenary State: Ideas, Institutions, and Reform under Frederick II, 1760\u20131785'' (2003)</ref> He funded the depleted treasury of the poor nation by loaning 19,000 soldiers in complete military formations to [[Great Britain]] to fight in North America during the [[American Revolutionary War]], 1776\u20131783. These soldiers, commonly known as [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessians]], fought under the British flag. The British used the Hessians in several conflicts, including in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. For further revenue, the soldiers were loaned to other places as well. Most were conscripted, with their pay going to the Landgrave.\n\n=== Modern history ===\n{{see|Electorate of Hesse|Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Nassau|People's State of Hesse|Province of Kurhessen|Greater Hesse}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Grand Duchy of Hesse 1806-1918.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|Coat of arms of the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]]]\nThe ruler of [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] was elevated to the status of [[Prince-Elector]] in 1803, but this remained without effect, as the Holy Roman Empire was disbanded in 1806. The territory was annexed by Napoleon to the Kingdom of [[Westphalia]] in 1806, but restored to the Elector in 1813. While other Electors had gained other titles, becoming either Kings or Grand Dukes, the Elector of Hesse-Kassel alone retained the anachronistic title. The name survived in the term ''Kurhessen'', denoting the region around Kassel. In 1866, it was annexed by [[Prussia]], together with the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], the small [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg]], and the [[Duchy of Nassau]], which were then combined into the province of [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\n[[Hesse-Darmstadt]] was elevated by Napoleon to the status of a Grand Duchy in 1806, becoming the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]. In the [[War of 1866]], it fought on the side of [[Austria]] against [[Prussia]], but retained its autonomy in defeat because a greater part of the country was situated south of the [[Main River]] and Prussia did not dare to expand beyond the Main line, as this might have provoked France. However, the parts of Hesse-Darmstadt north of the Main (the region around the town of [[Gie\u00dfen]], commonly called ''Oberhessen'') were incorporated in the [[Norddeutscher Bund]], a tight federation of German states, established by Prussia in 1867. In 1871, after France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the rest of the Grand Duchy joined the [[German Empire]]. Around the turn of the 20th century, Darmstadt was one of the centres of the [[Jugendstil]]. Until 1907, the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]] used the Hessian red and white lion as its coat-of-arms.\n\nThe revolution of 1918 transformed Hesse-Darmstadt from a monarchy to a republic, which officially renamed itself \"[[Volksstaat Hessen]]\" (People's State of Hesse). The parts of Hesse-Darmstadt on the western banks of the Rhine (province Rheinhessen) were occupied by French troops until 1930 under the terms of the Versailles peace treaty that officially ended World War I in 1919. In 1929 the [[Principality of Waldeck]] was dissolved and incorporated into [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the Hessian territory west of the Rhine was again occupied by France, whereas the rest of the region was part of the US occupation zone. The French separated their part of Hesse from the rest of the region and incorporated it into the newly founded state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] (Rheinland-Pfalz). The United States, on the other side, proclaimed the state of [[Greater Hesse]] (''Gro\u00df-Hessen'') on 19 September 1945, out of Hesse-Darmstadt and most of the former Prussian province of [[Province of Hesse-Nassau|Hesse-Nassau]]. \n\nOn 4 December 1946 Gro\u00df-Hessen was officially renamed Hessen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://60stolzejahre.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dssid=77&dsmid=1898 |title=Hessen - 60 stolze Jahre - Zeittafel 1945/1946 |accessdate=2006-12-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017144544/http://60stolzejahre.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dssid=77&dsmid=1898 |archivedate=2006-10-17 }}</ref>\nHesse in the 1940s received more than a million [[Heimatvertriebene|displaced ethnic Germans]].\nDue to its proximity to the [[Inner German border]], Hesse became an important location of [[NATO]] installations in the 1950s, especially military bases of the US [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]] and [[United States Army Europe]]. \nThe first elected minister president of Hesse was [[Christian Stock]], followed by [[Georg-August Zinn]] (both Social Democrats). The German Social Democrats gained an absolute majority in 1962 and pursued progressive policies with the so-called ''Gro\u00dfer Hessenplan''. The [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] gained a relative majority in the 1974 elections, but the Social Democrats continued to govern in a coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]. Hesse was first governed by the CDU under [[Walter Wallmann]] during 1987\u20131991, replaced by a SPD-Greens coalition under [[Hans Eichel]] during 1991\u20131999. From 1999, Hesse was governed by the CDU under [[Roland Koch]] (retired 2010) and [[Volker Bouffier]] (incumbent as of 2019).\n[[Frankfurt]] during the 1960s to 1990s developed into one of the major cities of West Germany. As of 2016, 12% of the total population of Hesse lived in the city of Frankfurt.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{See also|List of places in Hesse|List of mountains of Hesse}}\n[[File:Hessen topografisch Relief Karte.png|thumb|upright=1.05|The most important rivers, mountains, and cities of Hesse]]\n\nSituated in west-central Germany, The state of Hesse borders the German states of (starting in the north and proceeding clockwise) [[Lower Saxony]], [[Thuringia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].\n\nMost of the population of Hesse lives in the southern part, in the [[Frankfurt Rhein-Main Region|Rhine Main Area]]. The principal cities of the area include [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Wiesbaden]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Offenbach, Hesse|Offenbach]], [[Hanau]], [[Gie\u00dfen]], [[Wetzlar]], and [[Limburg an der Lahn|Limburg]]. Other major towns in Hesse are [[Fulda]] in the [[East Hesse|east]], and [[Kassel]] and [[Marburg an der Lahn]] in the [[North Hesse|north]]. The densely populated Rhine-Main region is much better developed than the rural areas in the middle and northern parts of Hesse.\n\nThe most important rivers in Hesse are the [[Fulda River|Fulda]] and [[Eder]] Rivers in the north, the [[Lahn]] in the central part of Hesse, and the [[Main (river)|Main]] and [[Rhine]] in the south. The countryside is hilly and the numerous mountain ranges include the [[Rh\u00f6n]], the [[Westerwald]], the [[Taunus]], the [[Vogelsberg Mountains|Vogelsberg]], the [[Kn\u00fcll]] and the [[Spessart]].\n\nThe Rhine borders Hesse on the southwest without running through the state, only one [[oxbow lake]] \u2014\u2013 the so-called Alt-Rhein \u2014\u2013 runs through Hesse. The mountain range between the Main and the Neckar Rivers is called the [[Odenwald]]. The plain between the rivers Main, Rhine, and Neckar, and the Odenwald Mountains is called the Ried.\n\nHesse is the greenest state in Germany, as forest covers 42% of the state.<ref name=\"HesseGeography\">{{cite web|title=Our State|url=http://www.hessen.eu/irj/hessen_en_Internet?cid=42734bf7b41385446b3a113d3314add9|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130106184553/http://www.hessen.eu/irj/hessen_en_Internet?cid=42734bf7b41385446b3a113d3314add9|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 January 2013|publisher=State of Hesse|accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Administration ==\nHesse is a [[unitary state]] governed directly by the [[Landtag of Hesse|Hessian government]] in the capital city Wiesbaden, partially through regional vicarious authorities called ''Regierungspr\u00e4sidien''. Municipal parliaments are, however, elected independently from the state government by the Hessian people. Local municipalities enjoy a considerable degree of [[home rule]].\n\n=== Districts ===\nThe state is divided into three administrative provinces (''Regierungsbezirke''): [[Kassel (region)|Kassel]] in the north and east, [[Gie\u00dfen (region)|Gie\u00dfen]] in the centre, and [[Darmstadt (region)|Darmstadt]] in the south, the latter being the most populous region with the [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main]] agglomeration in its central area. The administrative regions have no legislature of their own, but are executive agencies of the state government.\n\n[[File:Map of Hesse with districts (with numbers).svg|frameless|upright=1.45]]\n[[File:0472-0490R-Hessische Staatskanzlei.jpg|thumb|The state chancellery building in the capital city of [[Wiesbaden]]]]\n[[File:FrankfurtSkyline2014.jpg|thumb|[[Frankfurt am Main]]]]\n[[File:Schlosspark Wilhelmsh\u00f6he 001.jpg|thumb|[[Kassel]]]]\n[[File:Luisenplatz.jpg|thumb|[[Darmstadt]]]]\n[[File:Offenbach am main from drone.jpg|thumb|[[Offenbach, Hesse|Offenbach am Main]]]]\nHesse is divided into 21 districts (Kreise) and five independent cities, each with their own local governments.

It has not been part of the State of Hesse since 1946 due to divisions in the aftermath of World War II. This province is now part of the State of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. It is a hilly countryside largely devoted to vineyards; therefore, it is also called the \"land of the thousand hills\". Its larger towns include [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]], [[Alzey]], [[Nieder-Olm]], and [[Ingelheim]]. Many inhabitants commute to work in Mainz, Wiesbaden, or Frankfurt.\n\n== State symbols and politics ==\n{{Main article|Politics of Hesse}}\n\nHesse has been a parliamentary republic since 1918, except during [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]] (1933\u20131945). The German federal system has elements of exclusive federal competences, shared competences, and exclusive competences of the federal states. Hesse is famous for having a rather brisk style in its politics with the ruling parties being either the center-right [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) or the center-left [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). Due to the Hessian electoral laws, the biggest party normally needs a smaller coalition partner.\n\n=== Head of state ===\nAs Hesse is a federal state, its constitution combines the offices of the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] in one office called the [[Minister-president|Minister-President]] (German: ''Ministerpr\u00e4sident'') which is comparable to the office of a [[prime minister]].\n\n=== Most recent state election ===\nIn the [[Hessian_state_election,_2018|2018 state elections]] the two leading parties, CDU and SPD, lost 11.3% (7 seats) and 10.9% (8 seats) of the vote respectively. The Green party, a member of Hesse's previous governing coalition with CDU, gained 8.7% (16 seats). The largest gains during the election were made by [[Alternative for Germany]] (AfD) at 13.1%. As AfD had not passed the 5% threshold in the [[Hessian_state_election,_2013|2013 state election]], this marked its first entry into the [[Landtag of Hesse|Hessian parliament]] (''Hessischer Landtag''). The two other parties also made gains. The major losses of the two leading parties (whose [[Grand_coalition_(Germany)|coalition]] made up the federal cabinet during the election) closely mirrors the results of the [[Bavarian_state_election,_2018|2018 state elections in Bavaria]]. In the current parliament the conservative CDU holds a 40 seats, the centre-left SPD and the leftist Green party each hold 29 seats, the right-wing AfD holds 19 seats, the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] party holds 11 seats and the socialist party [[The Left (Germany)|Die Linke]] holds 9 seats.\n\n[[File:Landtag of Hesse 2018.svg|thumb|The Hessian parliament as of the 2018 election]]\n\n=== Foreign affairs ===\nAs a member state of the German federation, Hesse does not have a diplomatic service of its own. However, Hesse operates representation offices in such foreign countries as the United States, China, Hungary, Cuba, Russia, Poland, and Iran. These offices are mostly used to represent Hessian interests in cultural and economic affairs. Hesse has also permanent representation offices in Berlin at the [[federal government of Germany]] and in [[Brussels]] at the [[European Union]].<ref>State of Hessen. Foreign representation offices.

HR is a member of the federal [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] broadcasting association. HR provides a statewide TV channel as well as a range of regional radio stations (HR&nbsp;1, HR&nbsp;2, HR&nbsp;3, HR&nbsp;4, you&nbsp;fm and HR&nbsp;info). Besides the state run HR, privately run TV stations exist and are an important line of commerce. Among the commercial radio stations that are active in Hesse, Hit Radio FFH, Planet Radio, Harmony FM, Radio BOB and Antenne Frankfurt are the most popular.\n\n== Economy ==\nWith Hesse's largest city [[Frankfurt am Main]] being home of the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB), the [[Bundesbank|German Bundesbank]] and the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]], Hesse is home to the financial capital of mainland Europe. Furthermore, Hesse has always been one of the largest and healthiest economies in Germany.

The main economic fields of importance are the [[chemical]] and [[pharmaceutical]] industries with [[Sanofi]], [[Merck Group|Merck]], [[Heraeus]], [[Messer Griesheim]] and [[Degussa]]. In the mechanical and automotive engineering field [[Opel]] in R\u00fcsselsheim is worth mentioning. Frankfurt is crucial as a [[financial center]], with both the [[European Central Bank]] and the [[Deutsche Bundesbank]]'s headquarters located there. Numerous smaller banks and [[Deutsche Bank]], [[DZ Bank]], [[KfW|KfW Bank]], [[Commerzbank]] are also headquartered in Frankfurt, with the offices of several international banks also being housed there. Frankfurt is also the location of the most important German stock exchange, the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]]. [[Insurance]] companies have settled mostly in [[Wiesbaden]]. The city's largest private employer is the [[R+V Versicherung]], with about 3,900 employees, other major employers are [[Winterthur Group|DBV-Winterthur]], the [[SV SparkassenVersicherung]] and the [[Delta Lloyd Group]]. The leather industry is predominantly settled in [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]].

[[Frankfurt International Airport]] is Germany's largest and Europe's third-largest airport (after [[London Heathrow]] and [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle]]). [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof]] is Germany's second-busiest railway station by passengers but the busiest in terms of traffic.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n=== Road transport ===\nHesse has a dense highway network with a total of 24 motorways. The internationally important motorway routes through Hesse are the A3, A5, and A7. Close to Frankfurt Airport is the [[Frankfurter Kreuz]], Germany's busiest and one of Europe's busiest motorway junctions, where the motorways [[Bundesautobahn 3|A3]] (Arnhem-Cologne-Frankfurt-Nuremberg-Passau) and [[Bundesautobahn 5|A5]] (Hattenbach-Frankfurt-Karlsruhe-Basel) intersect. The A5 becomes as wide as four lanes in each direction near the city of Frankfurt am Main, and during the rush-hour, it is possible to use the emergency lanes on the A3 and A5 motorway in the [[Frankfurt/Rhine-Main|Rhine-Main Region]], adding additional lanes. Other major leading Hesse highways are the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]], the [[Bundesautobahn 44|A44]], the [[Bundesautobahn 45|A45]], the Federal Highway [[Bundesautobahn 66|A66]] and the [[Bundesautobahn 67|A67]]. There are also a number of smaller motorways and major trunk roads, some of which are [[dual carriageway]]s.\n\n=== Railway transport ===\nHesse is accessed by many major rail lines, including the high-speed lines [[K\u00f6ln\u2013Frankfurt high-speed rail line|Cologne\u2013Frankfurt]] and [[Hanover\u2013W\u00fcrzburg high-speed railway|Hanover\u2013W\u00fcrzburg]]. Other north-south connections traverse major east-west routes from Wiesbaden and Mainz to Frankfurt and from Hanau and Aschaffenburg to Fulda and Kassel. The Frankfurt Central Station is the most important hub for German trains, with over 1,100 trains per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2817|title=Bahn|website=Frankfurt am Main|accessdate=5 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905175904/https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2817|archive-date=5 September 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe region around Frankfurt has an extensive [[S-Bahn]] network, the [[S-Bahn Rhein-Main]], which is complemented by many regional train connections. In the rest of the country, the rail network is less extensive. Since 2007, the region around Kassel has been served by the [[RegioTram Kassel|RegioTram]], a [[tram-train]]-concept similar to the [[Karlsruhe model]].\n\n=== Air transport ===\n[[Frankfurt Airport]] is by far the largest airport in Germany with more than 57 million passengers each year, is and among the world's ten largest. [[Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport]] lies to the south, and is frequented by [[general aviation]] and private planes. [[Kassel Airport]] offers a few flights to holiday destinations, but has struggled to compete. There are also a number of sports airfields. [[Low-cost airline]]s, especially [[Ryanair]], use [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport]] as a major base, although the airport is actually located about 100&nbsp;km from Frankfurt in the neighbouring state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. The DFS ([[Deutsche Flugsicherung|German air traffic control]]) has its headquarters in [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]].\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* Ingrao, Charles W.

Accessed September 2011.</ref> The [[Green Party of British Columbia|BC Greens]] ran Canada's first Green candidate. Later that year, the founding conference of the [[Green Party of Canada|Canadian Greens]] was held at [[Carleton University]] in [[Ottawa]], Ontario.<ref name=\"greenparty.ca\"/> Close to 200 people from 55 communities attended, coming from every province except [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] and [[Prince Edward Island]].\n\nThe birthing process was difficult, with deep divisions between those arguing for a national structure, and those in favour of a process that would build from the regions following the [[bioregional democracy]] structure.\n\n[[Trevor Hancock]] was the party's first registered leader. Party members chose a radically decentralized party structure, and for several years a kind of [[green anarchism]] prevailed. Eventually, an uneasy agreement was reached for a federation of regional parties, with strong support for building upwards from the bottom. The question arose: \"Is the priority to redefine politics from the ground up, or to play the electoral game according to the present rules? Or both?\"\n\nMany members saw the party as a way to protest Canada's political system, and not much more. Nonetheless it did run candidates.\n\n==1980s==\nThe [[Green Party of Canada]] was registered in 1983 by Paul George, Ted Mousseau, William Marshall, Ed McDonough and Seymour Trieger in June - just preceding a byelection in Mission-Port Moody during which Betty Nickerson ran as a Green Party of Canada candidate. The party had not gained official status at that point so the party name did not appear on the ballot - though it did on all her communications. The first convention in Ontario later that fall elected the next set of party officers. The [[Green Party of Canada]] contested its first [[1984 Canadian federal election|federal election in September 1984]]. Approximately 27,000 Canadians voted Green (0.2% of the votes cast). But ongoing discussions about the party's ''modus operandi'' became so exhausting that, at one point in the mid-1980s, there was a near collapse of the party. It survived \u2014 though not particularly active \u2014 for almost a decade under the stewardship of the BC Greens.\n\nIn the [[1988 Canadian federal election|1988 federal election]], Greens concentrated on [[Quebec]], where ''le Parti Vert'' (not the same as the current [[Parti Vert du Qu\u00e9bec]]) ran 29 candidates, up from just 4 in the previous election. ''Les Verts'' received higher results than Green candidates anywhere else in Canada, polling an average of 2.4% of the vote. The Quebec wing hosted the 1990 Canadian Greens conference in Montreal. But soon after that, Canada's constitutional problems interfered, and many Quebec candidates abandoned the Greens in favour of a [[Quebec sovereignty|Quebec sovereigntist]] party, the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]. There were only six Green candidates from Quebec in the [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 election]].\n\nIn the summer of 1988, the BC Greens, under the ''de facto'' leadership of electoral-reform activist [[Steve Kisby]], tried to get the Green Party of Canada onto its feet by hosting a conference \u2014 the first federal gathering since the founding meeting in 1983. The main accomplishment of that conference was the acceptance, after five years as a registered party, of a constitution. The party continued to field candidates at the federal level, and provincial parties were organized in a few other provinces, led by consistently strong efforts in British Columbia.\n\nIn 1988, however, despite minimal on-the-ground organization, Quebec produced the lion's share of Green candidates and votes thanks to the efforts of Quebec organizer and candidate Rolf Bramann. A year later, the provincial Greens in Quebec scored 2% of the popular vote, averaging 5% in the constituencies in which they ran under the leadership of [[Jean Ouimet]]. Montreal's municipal Ecology Party also scored very well in elections in this period under the leadership of publisher [[Dimitrios Roussopoulos]].\n\nOuimet, a strong sovereigntist, maintained a party wholly independent of the federal Greens during his leadership; as a result Bramann created an organization called the Green Party of Canada in Quebec, a predominantly Anglophone entity that nominated federal candidates only. There was open antipathy between Ouimet and Bramann. Neither was affiliated with \u00c9cologie-Montreal.\n\nAt the same time as the Parti Vert began to collapse due to Ouimet's defection to the PQ in 1992, Bramann was removed from his position in the federal party due to anti-Semitic comments he and some of his candidates had made. This led to a precipitous decline in all Green Party organizations in Quebec despite a very promising start a mere four years previous.\n\nFrom 1988 onwards, a pattern developed whereby the federal party tended to function alternately as an appendage of the BC and Ontario provincial parties. Lacking sufficient funding and an administrative base of its own, control of the federal Greens was sometimes a prize (when the provincial affiliate and its leader wanted to demonstrate its success), and at others, a burden (when the provincial affiliate was forced to invest significant volunteer energy or money for its maintenance) for the Greens in BC and Ontario. Successful candidates for the positions of Leader and Chief Financial Officer were typically personal associates of either the BC or Ontario party's ''de facto'' or ''de jure'' leader, for whom the leader publicly mobilized and delivered votes.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the spring of 1996, although the hopes of electing a representative to the BC legislature proved premature, Andy Shadrack in the interior of the province received over 11% of the vote. Overall, the party's proportion of the popular vote surged to a new high. Shadrack was also the most popular Green candidate in the 1997 federal election, scoring over 6% of the popular vote in West Kootenay-Okanagan.\n\nAt the party's sixth annual gathering in [[Castlegar, British Columbia]], hosted by Shadrack's riding association, in August 1996, a complete overhaul of the party's constitution was made, spearheaded by [[Stuart Parker (politician)|Stuart Parker]], leader of the provincial Greens in BC. The party's new constitutional framework both democratized and centralized the party which had been previously hobbled by an unworkably decentralized structure. These changes also ended de jure (it had ended de facto some three years earlier) the constitutional prohibition against the party's registered leader acting as its spokesperson or representative. Policy was also agreed to in a wide variety of areas. An important step forward was the structuring of a [[Shadow Cabinet]], whose mandate was to create a platform for the [[1997 Canadian federal election|next election in 1997]].\n\nThe Castlegar gathering marked the beginning of a new era in Canadian Green history, and a somewhat uneasy one at that. In spite of a concern about the nature of leadership in a decentralized party, the Greens' first leadership campaign had been underway for the previous six months. Four candidates contested the leadership. A mail-in ballot was held: [[Wendy Priesnitz]] (from Ontario) beat Don Francis (Quebec), Jason Crummey ([[Newfoundland and Labrador]]), and Harry Garfinkle ([[Alberta]]) to become the Registered Leader of the Green Party of Canada.\n\nIn January 1997, although initially recruited by [[Green Party of Ontario|Ontario Green Party]] leader [[Frank de Jong]], Wendy Priesnitz resigned over what she characterized as domination of the party by an \"old boys' network\" comprising the BC and Ontario provincial leaders and their male-dominated circles of organizers and advisors. Harry Garfinkle stepped in to be the interim Registered Leader of the Green Party of Canada, and a leadership convention by mail-in ballot was held.\n\n==Joan Russow==\nBritish Columbia's [[Joan Russow]] became leader of the Green Party of Canada on April 13, 1997. Russow won 52% of the ballots cast in the 1997 leadership race, surpassing Ontario's Jim Harris (39%) and Rachelle Small (8%). Immediately upon attaining the leadership, Russow was plunged into a federal general election. Russow's campaign in 1997 set a number of important precedents. The 1997 election was the first campaign in which the Greens conducted a national leader's tour, presented a national platform and a bilingual campaign (Russow is trilingual, speaking Spanish, French and English). Previous campaigns, due in part to the party's few resources and, in part, to the party's constitutional straitjacket, had been characterized by policy and spokespeople operating, at best, province-by-province and, at worst, riding-by-riding. In her own riding of Victoria, Russow received just shy of 3000 votes and 6% of the popular vote.\n\nIn the [[2000 Canadian federal election|2000 election]], the party nominated 111 candidates, in nine out of ten provinces \u2014 all but Newfoundland and Labrador \u2014 and in one of three territories ([[Nunavut]]). These candidates collected 0.81% of the total popular vote.\n\nCandidates were not run in Newfoundland and Labrador, as a result of ongoing divisions over Joan Russow's refusal to endorse the Green candidate in an earlier St. John's West [[by-election]]. (The candidate in question supported the seal hunt and mining development, as most locals did.) This caused much uncertainty and friction between Newfoundland's Terra Nova Green Party Association and the Green Party leader as the party gradually adapted to the realities of functioning as a true national party rather than a disorganized federation of local activists.\n\nIn the 2001 [[Quebec City protest]] against the [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]], Russow was the first person incarcerated in a jail built specially for protesters, for taking a photograph of it from outside. Russow promoted the Green Party as a leader in the [[anti-globalization movement]], in particular the anti-[[corporatist]] and pro-peace movement, but felt undermined when the [[German Greens]] supported the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|bombing of Belgrade]]. As other members of her party had supported military intervention, Russow's leadership was called into question. She stepped down as party leader in 2001 and left the party to join the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP). Because the NDP's federal and provincial wings are integrated, this also entailed joining the [[New Democratic Party of British Columbia]].\n\nAnother factor in her resignation may have been ongoing conflicts within the party provincially and municipally in her home city of Victoria, where she had switched allegiance from the Parker faction to the [[Adriane Carr]] faction. Her late conversion left her on unsure footing with the powerful new provincial leader and in public conflict with City Councilor Art Vanden Berg and other members of the Parker-affiliated team that had backed her leadership during the 1997 and 1998 leadership contests.\n\nThe conflicts left Russow isolated and alienated from most members of the party. Volunteer efforts were substantially absorbed in provincial campaigns between 2001 and 2003, and the federal party became dormant between elections, as was typical in the past. [[Chris Bradshaw]] served the party as interim leader from 2001 to February 2003.\n\n==Jim Harris==\n[[File:Jim Harris of the Green Party - 2008 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Jim Harris (politician)|Jim Harris]], Former Green Party Leader]]\n\nIn February 2003, [[Jim Harris (politician)|Jim Harris]], in his second bid for the leadership, defeated John Grogan of [[Valemount, British Columbia]], and Jason Crummey. Crummey was originally from Newfoundland and involved with [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] Terra Nova Greens. Harris, an author and public speaker, and GPC member since 1987 (though not active in several previous elections), had the support of all provincial Green Party leaders, breaking 15 years of precedent of the BC leader backing a BC candidate from their own political circle. His election was taken by many as reflecting a desire among the members to \"become serious\" in achieving electoral progress, and to steer away from any explicit anti-political ideas. However, his campaign also included a hard line against [[Red-green alliance|Red-Green]] (i.e., alliances with NDP members and [[labour movement|organized labour]]) coalitions that Russow had supported at the municipal level in Victoria. While adopting the rhetoric of pragmatism, some argue, Harris eschewed the only strategy that has ever elected Greens under the first-past-the-post system. Harris announced on April 24, 2006, that he would stand down as leader at the party's convention in August.\n\n===Full slate===\nThe Green Party ran a fundraising campaign in 2003 to realize Harris' goal of running a full slate in the upcoming election. This party also had to borrow hundreds of thousands of dollars against the $1.75/vote expected to accrue to the party after the election. The party began organizing in all provinces with paid staff.\n\n===2004 election and aftermath===\nIn the [[2004 Canadian federal election|2004 election]], the party received a significant increase in media coverage on the strength of its [[Green Party of Canada candidates, 2004 federal election|308 candidates]], the platform, and a national leaders' tour. The party began to be included in almost all national political polls. Its popular support peaked at 7% during the campaign, and the party finished with 4.3% of the vote. The party's strongest candidate, Andrew Lewis in the riding of [[Saanich\u2014Gulf Islands]], won over 10,000 votes, the first Green Party candidate to do so. Lewis still finished fourth in the riding, however.\n\nIn August 2004 at the national convention near Calgary, Alberta, Jim Harris was re-elected, with a reduced majority of only 56%. Rival Tom Manley polled nearly 37%.\n\nMost conference debate centred on significant constitutional reform proposals, and the role of membership in ruling on matters of policy and the constitution. The conference ended with a re-affirmation of a hybrid that was developed during the campaign: a centralized executive with decentralized policy and constitutional development.\n\nPoliticians from different political backgrounds have expressed interest in the party. Former Deputy Prime Minister [[Sheila Copps]] on March 2, 2005, spoke publicly to a group of Greens in Toronto, advising the party on its electoral strategy. Former Progressive Conservative leadership candidate [[David Orchard]] not only attended but met with members of the GPC Council; however, Orchard's involvement with the Greens dates back to the mid-1990s when he worked with Russow on a variety of trade and international issues. (Ontario leader [[Frank de Jong]] and BC leader [[Stuart Parker (politician)|Stuart Parker]] were featured speakers at pro-Orchard rallies early in his first bid for the Tory leadership in 1998.) It was also rumoured in the media in 2004 that [[David Anderson (British Columbia politician)|David Anderson]], the former Minister of the Environment in Chr\u00e9tien's government, was considering joining the party. Anderson, however, successfully ran for re-election as a Liberal.\n\n===2006 election===\n[[File:Green Party of Canada leadership convention, 2006.jpg|thumb|Green Party of Canada leadership convention, 2006]]\n\nNone of the party's candidates were elected, but the party received 4.5% of the vote nationally (up from 4.3% in 2004) and 665,940 votes (an increase of about 80,000 votes from 2004). Its best performance was in Alberta, where it received 6.6%. Sean Maw won 10.84% of the vote in [[Wild Rose (electoral district)|Wild Rose]] and finished a very distant second to Conservative [[Myron Thompson]]. [[Shane Jolley]] won 12.9% of the vote in [[Bruce\u2014Grey\u2014Owen Sound]] riding, the largest share of the vote won by any of its candidates. In the riding [[Ottawa Centre]], the Green candidate [[David Chernushenko]] received 6,766 votes, the largest number of votes of any of the party's candidates. It had been hoped by Greens that the party's deputy leader, Andrew Lewis, would achieve a breakthrough in [[Saanich\u2014Gulf Islands]] where he won 16.7% of the vote in the 2004 election and carried 17 of 238 polling divisions, making Lewis the first Green candidate to win even one polling division. However, running again in Saanich\u2014Gulf Islands in 2006 he lost one-third of his 2004 vote share, winning only 9.6% of the ballots cast.\n\nThe party's [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006 election campaign]] was disrupted by allegations made by Matthew Pollesell, the party's former assistant national organizer, that Harris had not filed a proper accounting of money spent during his 2004 leadership campaign, as required by law. Pollesell issued a request that Elections Canada investigate. Pollesell and another former party member, Gretchen Schwarz, were subsequently warned by the party's legal counsel to retract allegations they had made or face a possible legal action. Dana Miller, who served in the party's shadow cabinet with responsibility for human-rights issues, made public her earlier complaints that the party has violated election law and its own constitution and has also asked for an Elections Canada investigation. Miller was expelled from the party after filing a complaint within the party in April.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20051229/ELXNGREENS29/TPNational/?query=%22jim+harris%22 | location=Toronto | title=globeandmail.com }} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>\n\n==Elizabeth May==\n[[Image:Elizabeth May.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Elizabeth May]], Green Party Leader from August 2006 to November 2019]]\nElizabeth May was elected leader of the Green Party of Canada in August 2006. She ran in the November 27, 2006 [[London North Centre]] by-election, finishing second with 26% of the votes. It was the Green Party's best-ever result in a federal election, easily eclipsing the previous mark of 16.7% achieved in  2004 in the B.C. riding of [[Saanich-Gulf Islands]].\n\n===2008 election===\nIn the [[2008 Canadian federal election|2008 general election]], the Green Party's vote was up again to 6.8% and 937,613 votes. On August 30, former Liberal MP [[Blair Wilson]] announced that he would be joining the [[Green Party of Canada]], becoming the party's first MP. However, he was defeated in the 2008 federal election, which was called before he had a chance to officially sit in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] as a Green MP. The best showing in 2008 was in Elizabeth May's riding of Central Nova where May captured 32.2% of the vote against Conservative cabinet minister Peter MacKay.  Part of the reason for May's strong showing is that she brokered a deal with Liberal leader St\u00e9phane Dion in which he agreed not to run a Liberal candidate.  In return, May agreed not to run a candidate in Dion's riding.\n\n===2011 election===\nBoth for the first time, the leader [[Elizabeth May]] became the first [[Member of Parliament#Canada|Member]] of [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] elected to represent the party.

Accessed September 2011.</ref> The [[Green Party of British Columbia|BC Greens]] ran Canada's first Green candidate. Later that year, the founding conference of the [[Green Party of Canada|Canadian Greens]] was held at [[Carleton University]] in [[Ottawa]], Ontario.<ref name=\"greenparty.ca\"/> Close to 200 people from 55 communities attended, coming from every province except [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] and [[Prince Edward Island]].\n\nThe birthing process was difficult, with deep divisions between those arguing for a national structure, and those in favour of a process that would build from the regions following the [[bioregional democracy]] structure.\n\n[[Trevor Hancock]] was the party's first registered leader. Party members chose a radically decentralized party structure, and for several years a kind of [[green anarchism]] prevailed. Eventually, an uneasy agreement was reached for a federation of regional parties, with strong support for building upwards from the bottom. The question arose: \"Is the priority to redefine politics from the ground up, or to play the electoral game according to the present rules? Or both?\"\n\nMany members saw the party as a way to protest Canada's political system, and not much more. Nonetheless it did run candidates.\n\n==1980s==\nThe [[Green Party of Canada]] was registered in 1983 by Paul George, Ted Mousseau, William Marshall, Ed McDonough and Seymour Trieger in June - just preceding a byelection in Mission-Port Moody during which Betty Nickerson ran as a Green Party of Canada candidate. The party had not gained official status at that point so the party name did not appear on the ballot - though it did on all her communications. The first convention in Ontario later that fall elected the next set of party officers. The [[Green Party of Canada]] contested its first [[1984 Canadian federal election|federal election in September 1984]]. Approximately 27,000 Canadians voted Green (0.2% of the votes cast). But ongoing discussions about the party's ''modus operandi'' became so exhausting that, at one point in the mid-1980s, there was a near collapse of the party. It survived \u2014 though not particularly active \u2014 for almost a decade under the stewardship of the BC Greens.\n\nIn the [[1988 Canadian federal election|1988 federal election]], Greens concentrated on [[Quebec]], where ''le Parti Vert'' (not the same as the current [[Parti Vert du Qu\u00e9bec]]) ran 29 candidates, up from just 4 in the previous election. ''Les Verts'' received higher results than Green candidates anywhere else in Canada, polling an average of 2.4% of the vote. The Quebec wing hosted the 1990 Canadian Greens conference in Montreal. But soon after that, Canada's constitutional problems interfered, and many Quebec candidates abandoned the Greens in favour of a [[Quebec sovereignty|Quebec sovereigntist]] party, the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]. There were only six Green candidates from Quebec in the [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 election]].\n\nIn the summer of 1988, the BC Greens, under the ''de facto'' leadership of electoral-reform activist [[Steve Kisby]], tried to get the Green Party of Canada onto its feet by hosting a conference \u2014 the first federal gathering since the founding meeting in 1983. The main accomplishment of that conference was the acceptance, after five years as a registered party, of a constitution. The party continued to field candidates at the federal level, and provincial parties were organized in a few other provinces, led by consistently strong efforts in British Columbia.\n\nIn 1988, however, despite minimal on-the-ground organization, Quebec produced the lion's share of Green candidates and votes thanks to the efforts of Quebec organizer and candidate Rolf Bramann. A year later, the provincial Greens in Quebec scored 2% of the popular vote, averaging 5% in the constituencies in which they ran under the leadership of [[Jean Ouimet]]. Montreal's municipal Ecology Party also scored very well in elections in this period under the leadership of publisher [[Dimitrios Roussopoulos]].\n\nOuimet, a strong sovereigntist, maintained a party wholly independent of the federal Greens during his leadership; as a result Bramann created an organization called the Green Party of Canada in Quebec, a predominantly Anglophone entity that nominated federal candidates only. There was open antipathy between Ouimet and Bramann. Neither was affiliated with \u00c9cologie-Montreal.\n\nAt the same time as the Parti Vert began to collapse due to Ouimet's defection to the PQ in 1992, Bramann was removed from his position in the federal party due to anti-Semitic comments he and some of his candidates had made. This led to a precipitous decline in all Green Party organizations in Quebec despite a very promising start a mere four years previous.\n\nFrom 1988 onwards, a pattern developed whereby the federal party tended to function alternately as an appendage of the BC and Ontario provincial parties. Lacking sufficient funding and an administrative base of its own, control of the federal Greens was sometimes a prize (when the provincial affiliate and its leader wanted to demonstrate its success), and at others, a burden (when the provincial affiliate was forced to invest significant volunteer energy or money for its maintenance) for the Greens in BC and Ontario. Successful candidates for the positions of Leader and Chief Financial Officer were typically personal associates of either the BC or Ontario party's ''de facto'' or ''de jure'' leader, for whom the leader publicly mobilized and delivered votes.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the spring of 1996, although the hopes of electing a representative to the BC legislature proved premature, Andy Shadrack in the interior of the province received over 11% of the vote. Overall, the party's proportion of the popular vote surged to a new high. Shadrack was also the most popular Green candidate in the 1997 federal election, scoring over 6% of the popular vote in West Kootenay-Okanagan.\n\nAt the party's sixth annual gathering in [[Castlegar, British Columbia]], hosted by Shadrack's riding association, in August 1996, a complete overhaul of the party's constitution was made, spearheaded by [[Stuart Parker (politician)|Stuart Parker]], leader of the provincial Greens in BC.

Former Progressive Conservative leadership candidate [[David Orchard]] not only attended but met with members of the GPC Council; however, Orchard's involvement with the Greens dates back to the mid-1990s when he worked with Russow on a variety of trade and international issues. (Ontario leader [[Frank de Jong]] and BC leader [[Stuart Parker (politician)|Stuart Parker]] were featured speakers at pro-Orchard rallies early in his first bid for the Tory leadership in 1998.) It was also rumoured in the media in 2004 that [[David Anderson (British Columbia politician)|David Anderson]], the former Minister of the Environment in Chr\u00e9tien's government, was considering joining the party. Anderson, however, successfully ran for re-election as a Liberal.\n\n===2006 election===\n[[File:Green Party of Canada leadership convention, 2006.jpg|thumb|Green Party of Canada leadership convention, 2006]]\n\nNone of the party's candidates were elected, but the party received 4.5% of the vote nationally (up from 4.3% in 2004) and 665,940 votes (an increase of about 80,000 votes from 2004). Its best performance was in Alberta, where it received 6.6%. Sean Maw won 10.84% of the vote in [[Wild Rose (electoral district)|Wild Rose]] and finished a very distant second to Conservative [[Myron Thompson]]. [[Shane Jolley]] won 12.9% of the vote in [[Bruce\u2014Grey\u2014Owen Sound]] riding, the largest share of the vote won by any of its candidates. In the riding [[Ottawa Centre]], the Green candidate [[David Chernushenko]] received 6,766 votes, the largest number of votes of any of the party's candidates. It had been hoped by Greens that the party's deputy leader, Andrew Lewis, would achieve a breakthrough in [[Saanich\u2014Gulf Islands]] where he won 16.7% of the vote in the 2004 election and carried 17 of 238 polling divisions, making Lewis the first Green candidate to win even one polling division. However, running again in Saanich\u2014Gulf Islands in 2006 he lost one-third of his 2004 vote share, winning only 9.6% of the ballots cast.\n\nThe party's [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006 election campaign]] was disrupted by allegations made by Matthew Pollesell, the party's former assistant national organizer, that Harris had not filed a proper accounting of money spent during his 2004 leadership campaign, as required by law. Pollesell issued a request that Elections Canada investigate. Pollesell and another former party member, Gretchen Schwarz, were subsequently warned by the party's legal counsel to retract allegations they had made or face a possible legal action. Dana Miller, who served in the party's shadow cabinet with responsibility for human-rights issues, made public her earlier complaints that the party has violated election law and its own constitution and has also asked for an Elections Canada investigation. Miller was expelled from the party after filing a complaint within the party in April.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20051229/ELXNGREENS29/TPNational/?query=%22jim+harris%22 | location=Toronto | title=globeandmail.com }} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>\n\n==Elizabeth May==\n[[Image:Elizabeth May.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Elizabeth May]], Green Party Leader from August 2006 to November 2019]]\nElizabeth May was elected leader of the Green Party of Canada in August 2006. She ran in the November 27, 2006 [[London North Centre]] by-election, finishing second with 26% of the votes. It was the Green Party's best-ever result in a federal election, easily eclipsing the previous mark of 16.7% achieved in  2004 in the B.C. riding of [[Saanich-Gulf Islands]].\n\n===2008 election===\nIn the [[2008 Canadian federal election|2008 general election]], the Green Party's vote was up again to 6.8% and 937,613 votes. On August 30, the former Liberal MP [[Blair Wilson]] announces he is joining the [[Green Party of Canada]], becoming the party's first MP and He was defeated in the 2008 federal election, which was called before he had a chance to officially sit in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] as a Green MP. The best showing was in Elizabeth May's riding of Central Nova where May captured 32.2% of the vote against Conservative cabinet minister Peter MacKay.  Part of the reason for May's strong showing is that she brokered a deal with Liberal leader St\u00e9phane Dion in which he agreed not to run a Liberal candidate.  In return, May agreed not to run a candidate in Dion's riding.\n\n===2011 election===\nBoth for the first time, the leader [[Elizabeth May]] became the first [[Member of Parliament#Canada|Member]] of [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] elected to represent the party.

The Cardinals' 8\u20135 victory over Cincinnati on the last day of the month gave [[Tony La Russa]] victory #1,042 as the Cardinal manager, passing [[Red Schoendienst]] to become the winningest Cardinal manager of all time.  In the same game, Cardinal right fielder [[Juan Encarnaci\u00f3n]] was struck in the eye and severely injured with a foul ball.  Encarnacion was diagnosed with severe injuries to his left eye and multiple fractures of the orbital bone.  The injury ended his season and is believed to be potentially career-threatening.<ref>{{cite web|author =Matthew Leach|others=MLB.com |url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070831&content_id=2181965&vkey=news_stl&fext=.jsp&c_id=stl |title=The Official Site of The St. Louis Cardinals: News: Encarnacion struck in face by foul ball |publisher=Stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com |accessdate=December 12, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author =Matthew Leach|others=MLB.com |url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070902&content_id=2185910&vkey=news_stl&fext=.jsp&c_id=stl/ |title=The Official Site of Major League Baseball: News: Cards doc guarded on Encarnacion |publisher=Stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com |date=January 2, 2011 |accessdate=December 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe last off-day for the team in 2007 came on August 27, when they had four games remaining in the month, and then 31 games in September.

They entered the game on September 7 against the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] with a chance to take sole possession of first place, but instead the D-backs won and went on to sweep the weekend series.  September 7 was also the day that the ''New York Daily News'' reported that Rick Ankiel received a year's worth of [[human growth hormone]] in 2004 while he was trying to come back as a pitcher.  HGH was legal at that time but has since been banned by MLB.

They lost nine in a row to Arizona, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Chicago again.  The ninth loss came to the Cubs in the first game of a doubleheader on September 15, the game rescheduled from April 29 after the death of Josh Hancock.  It was the longest losing streak for the franchise since the 1980 Cardinals lost ten in a row.  The Cardinals were officially eliminated on September 21, as they lost to the visiting Houston Astros at Busch Stadium.  After being eliminated from postseason, St. Louis played out the string by going 7\u20132 the rest of the way, and finished the season with a 78\u201384 record, finishing in third place, seven games behind the NL Central winning [[2007 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]].  It was the first losing season for the franchise since the 1999 Cardinals went 75\u201386, and as of 2019, the last losing season the team has endured. \n    \nOn September 22, 2007, hosting the Houston Astros, the Cardinals set a one-day attendance record in their new Busch Stadium with 46,237.    \n    \nIn 2007, the Cardinals drew an all-time attendance record for any year with 3,552,180 in their 81 home games (breaking their previous record set in 2005), an average of 43,854 per game.\n\n==Aftermath==\nOwner [[William DeWitt, Jr.]] fired [[Walt Jocketty]], [[General manager (baseball)|General Manager]] for the Cardinals since 1995, on October 3.

The season started with the team trying to defend their [[2006 World Series]] championship.  During the offseason, the Cardinals were faced with the challenge of handling their starting rotation.  Four of their five starters were free agents, including [[Jeff Suppan]] (the [[2006 National League Championship Series|2006 NLCS]] MVP), [[Jeff Weaver]] (the winning pitcher in the World Series Game 5 clincher), [[Mark Mulder]], and [[Jason Marquis]].  In the end, Suppan, Weaver, and Marquis all signed with other teams.  The Cardinals signed Mulder, who ended the 2006 season on the [[disabled list]], to a new two-year contract, but Mulder remained on the disabled list after undergoing shoulder surgery.<ref>{{cite web | title = Cardinals sign Mulder to two-year deal | work = St. Louis Cardinals official website | url = http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070110&content_id=1776919&vkey=news_stl&fext=.jsp&c_id=stl | accessdate = May 14, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nTo replace the departed pitchers, the Cardinals promoted [[Adam Wainwright]], who spent 2006 in relief and took the closer's job from injured [[Jason Isringhausen]], to the rotation.  They signed free agent pitcher [[Kip Wells]] to fill another spot.  The team entered 2007 with a rotation of [[Chris Carpenter]], Wells, Wainwright and [[Anthony Reyes]], with reliever [[Braden Looper]] assuming the fifth starter's role until Mulder's return.<ref>{{cite web | title = Notes: Starting five are finalized | work = St. Louis Cardinals official website | url = http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070321&content_id=1853372&vkey=spt2007news&fext=.jsp&c_id=stl | accessdate = June 2, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast with the rotation, the rest of the team remained stable.

It consists of a sealed glass tube containing radioactive tritium gas whose inner surfaces are coated with a [[phosphor]].]]\n\n'''Radioluminescence''' is the phenomenon by which [[luminescence|light is produced in a material]] by bombardment with [[ionizing radiation]] such as [[alpha particle]]s, [[beta particle]]s, or [[gamma ray]]s.  Radioluminescence is used as a low level light source for night illumination of instruments or signage.  Radioluminescent paint used to be used for clock hands and instrument dials, enabling them to be read in the dark.  Radioluminescence is also sometimes seen around high-power radiation sources, such as [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[Radionuclide|radioisotopes]].\n\n==Mechanism==\nRadioluminescence occurs when an incoming particle of [[ionizing radiation]]  collides with an atom or molecule, exciting an orbital electron to a higher energy level.  The particle usually comes from the [[radioactive decay]] of an atom of a [[Radionuclide|radioisotope]], an [[isotope]] of an element which is radioactive.  The electron then returns to its ground energy level by emitting the extra energy as a [[photon]] of light.  A chemical that releases light of a particular color when struck by ionizing radiation is called a [[phosphor]].  Radioluminescent light sources usually consist of a radioactive substance mixed with, or in proximity to, a phosphor.\n\n==Applications==\n{{see also|Luminous paint#Radioluminescent paint}}\nSince radioactivity was discovered around the turn of the 20th century, the main application of radioluminescence has been in [[radioluminescent paint]], used on [[watch]] and [[compass]] dials, [[gunsight]]s, [[flight instruments|aircraft flight instrument]] faces, and other instruments, to allow them to be seen in the dark.  Radioluminescent paint consists of a mixture of a chemical containing a [[radioisotope]] with a radioluminescent chemical ([[phosphor]]).  The continuous [[radioactive decay]] of the isotope's atoms releases radiation particles which strike the molecules of the phosphor, causing them to give off light.  The constant bombardment by radioactive particles causes the chemical breakdown of many types of phosphor, so radioluminescent paints lose some of their luminosity over their working life.\n\n===Tritium===\n{{main article|Tritium radioluminescence}}\n[[File:Tritium-watch.jpg|thumb|Watch face illuminated by tritium tubes]]\n\nThe latest generation of radioluminescent materials is based on [[tritium]], a radioactive isotope of [[hydrogen]] with half-life of 12.32 years that emits very low-energy beta radiation.  It is used on [[wristwatch]] faces, [[Sight (device)|gun sights]], and emergency [[exit signs]].  The tritium gas is contained in a small glass tube, coated with a [[phosphor]] on the inside.  [[Beta particles]] emitted by the tritium strike the phosphor coating and cause it to [[fluoresce]], emitting light, usually yellow-green.\n\nTritium is used because it is believed to pose a negligible threat to human health, in contrast to the previous radioluminescent source, radium ''(below)'', which proved to be a significant radiological hazard. The low-energy 5.7&nbsp;keV beta particles emitted by tritium cannot pass through the enclosing glass tube.  Even if they could, they are not able to penetrate human skin. Tritium is only a health threat if ingested. Since tritium is a gas, if a tritium tube breaks, the gas dissipates in the air and is diluted to safe concentrations.\nTritium has a half-life of 12.3 years, so the brightness of a tritium light source will decline to half its initial value in that time.\n\n===Promethium===\nIn the second half of the 20th century, radium was progressively replaced with paint containing [[promethium]]-147. Promethium is a low-energy [[beta particle|beta-emitter]], which, unlike [[alpha particle|alpha emitters]] like radium, does not degrade the phosphor lattice, so the luminosity of the material will not degrade so quickly. It also does not emit the penetrating [[gamma ray]]s which radium does. The half-life of <sup>147</sup>Pm is only 2.62 years, so in a decade the radioactivity of a promethium dial will decline to only 1/16 of its original value, making it safer to dispose of, compared to radium with its half life of 1600 years. However, this short half-life meant that the luminosity of promethium dials also dropped by half every 2.62 years, giving them a short useful life, which led to promethium's replacement by tritium (above).\n\nPromethium-based paint was used to illuminate [[Apollo Lunar Module]] electrical switch tips and painted on control panels of the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Apollo Experience Report \u2013 Protection Against Radiation|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7080RadProtect.pdf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=9 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Radium===\n{{main article|Radium dials}}\n{{see also|Radium Girls}}\n[[File:Radium Dial.jpg|thumb|A 1950s radium clock, exposed to [[black light|ultraviolet light]] to increase luminescence]]\n[[File:Radium-paint.jpg|thumb|Self-luminous white radium paint on the face and hand of an old clock.]]\n\nThe first use of radioluminescence was in luminous paint containing [[radium]], a natural [[radioisotope]].  Beginning in 1908, luminous paint containing a mixture of [[radium]] and [[copper]]-[[dopant|doped]] [[zinc sulfide]] was used to paint watch faces and instrument dials, giving a greenish glow. Phosphors containing [[copper]]-doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu) yield blue-green light; copper and [[manganese]]-doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu,Mn), yielding yellow-orange light, are also used. Radium-based luminescent paint is no longer used due to the radiation hazard posed to those manufacturing the dials. These phosphors are not suitable for use in layers thicker than 25&nbsp;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>, as the self-absorption of the light then becomes a problem. Furthermore, zinc sulfide undergoes degradation of its crystal lattice structure, leading to gradual loss of brightness significantly faster than the depletion of radium.\n\nZnS:Ag coated [[spinthariscope]] screens were used by [[Ernest Rutherford]] in his experiments discovering the [[atomic nucleus]].\n\nRadium was used in luminous paint until the 1960s, when it was replaced with the other radioisotopes above due to health concerns.<ref name=\"Tykva\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Tykva\n | first1 = Richard\n | last2  = Sabol \n | first2 = Jozef\n | title  = Low-Level Environmental Radioactivity: Sources and Evaluation\n | publisher = CRC Press\n | date   = 1995\n | location = \n | pages  = 88\u201389\n | language = \n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=Tz9PZpxQc5YC&pg=PA88\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 1566761891\n }}</ref>  In addition to [[alpha ray|alpha]] and [[beta ray]]s, radium emits penetrating [[gamma ray]]s, which can pass through the metal and glass of a watch dial, and skin.  A typical older radium wristwatch dial has a radioactivity of 3\u201310 [[Becquerel|kBq]] and could expose its wearer to an annual dose of 24 [[Sievert|millisieverts]] if worn continuously.<ref name=\"Tykva\" />  Another health hazard is its decay product, the radioactive gas [[radon]], which constitutes a significant risk even at extremely low concentrations when breathed.  Radium's long [[half-life]] of 1600 years means that surfaces coated with radium paint, such as watch faces and hands, remain a health hazard long after their useful life is over.  There are still millions of luminous radium clock, watch, and compass faces and aircraft instrument dials owned by the public.  The case of the \"[[Radium Girls]]\", workers in watch factories in the early 1920s who painted watch faces with radium paint and later contracted fatal cancer through ingesting radium when they pointed their brushes with their lips, increased public awareness of the hazards of radioluminescent materials, and [[Radioactive decay|radioactivity]] in general.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cherenkov radiation]]\n*[[Gas mantle]]\n*[[List of light sources]]\n*[[Undark]]\n*[[Radium Dial Company]]\n*[[United States Radium Corporation]]\n*[[Phosphor#Radioluminescence|Radioluminescence in phosphor]]\n\n{{Artificial light sources}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Luminescence]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:Gaseous tritium light source.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Radioluminescent {{convert|1.8|Ci|GBq|lk=on|adj=on}} {{convert|6|\u00d7|0.2|in|mm|adj=on}} [[tritium]] vial used as a light source.

Furthermore, zinc sulfide undergoes degradation of its crystal lattice structure, leading to gradual loss of brightness significantly faster than the depletion of radium.\n\nZnS:Ag coated [[spinthariscope]] screens were used by [[Ernest Rutherford]] in his experiments discovering the [[atomic nucleus]].\n\nRadium was used in luminous paint until the 1960s, when it was replaced with the other radioisotopes above due to health concerns.<ref name=\"Tykva\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Tykva\n | first1 = Richard\n | last2  = Sabol \n | first2 = Jozef\n | title  = Low-Level Environmental Radioactivity: Sources and Evaluation\n | publisher = CRC Press\n | date   = 1995\n | location = \n | pages  = 88\u201389\n | language = \n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=Tz9PZpxQc5YC&pg=PA88\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 1566761891\n }}</ref>  In addition to [[alpha ray|alpha]] and [[beta ray]]s, radium emits penetrating [[gamma ray]]s, which can pass through the metal and glass of a watch dial, and skin.

Radium's long [[half-life]] of 1600 years means that surfaces coated with radium paint, such as watch faces and hands, remain a health hazard long after their useful life is over.  There are still millions of luminous radium clock, watch, and compass faces and aircraft instrument dials owned by the public.  The case of the \"[[Radium Girls]]\", workers in watch factories in the early 1920s who painted watch faces with radium paint and later contracted fatal cancer through ingesting radium when they pointed their brushes with their lips, increased public awareness of the hazards of radioluminescent materials, and [[Radioactive decay|radioactivity]] in general.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cherenkov radiation]]\n*[[Gas mantle]]\n*[[List of light sources]]\n*[[Undark]]\n*[[Radium Dial Company]]\n*[[United States Radium Corporation]]\n*[[Phosphor#Radioluminescence|Radioluminescence in phosphor]]\n\n{{Artificial light sources}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Luminescence]]\n", "name_user": "Squids and Chips", "label": "safe", "comment": "DisambiguateDopedtodopantusingpopups", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioluminescence"}

The variety of materials from which a clock may be constructed and the complexity of [[clockwork]] warrant such care to be taken by a clock owner so that a clock can continue to function.\n\n== Preventive conservation ==\nProper handling, suitable storage and display environments, and regular maintenance can together prevent issues from arising and impacting a clock's sustainability. Such controls can extend the life of a clock.\n\n=== Horological Conservation History ===\n[[File:L Ancient-egyptian-sundial.jpg|thumb|World's oldest Sundial, from Egypt's Valley of the Kings (c. 1500 BC). University of Basel - Valley of the Kings, Egypt]]\nThe history of clock conservation dates back to ancient times.  Horology, the study of the measurement of time, dates to 1450 BC, \"when the Ancient Egyptians first observed the earth's natural circadian rhythms (Meadows, C., (n.d.)<ref>Meadows, C., (n.d.). Horology: A Brief History. Retrieved from: https://www.artsandcollections.com/article/horology-a-brief-history</ref>.\u201d Some examples of instruments used to measure time include: clocks, watches, sundials, hourglasses, time recorders, and atomic clocks.  Horological Conservation is the science and art of preserving timepieces to connect humanity with the history and heritage of timepieces.\n\n=== Correct Handling ===\nCertain precautionary measures taken by a clock handler can prevent opportunities for damage:\n[[File:Pendulum_removed_from_clockwork.jpg|thumb|right|150x300px|Pendulum removed from clockwork.]]\n* Loose items worn by a handler have the potential to come into contact with and cause damage to a clock. Removal of these items prior to clock handling can lower the risk of damage. \n* Wearing \u201c[...] cotton or Nitrile gloves when handling the metal portions of the clock\u201d <ref name=Fahey>{{cite web|last1=Fahey|first1=Mary M.|title=The Care and Preservation of Clocks|url=http://www.thehenryford.org/research/caring/clocks.aspx|website=Benson Ford Research Center|publisher=The Henry Ford|accessdate=19 November 2015}}</ref> can limit opportunities for transfer of contaminants from hands to clock surfaces. \n* [[Pendulum]] damage during clock movement can be prevented by either removing the pendulum or fixing it within the interior of the clock via a latch or padding prior to clock movement.<ref name=Fahey /> This can also prevent damage to other interior components.\n* A clock \"[...] should always be grasped at its most sturdy area\" <ref name=Fahey /> and moved from one location to the next on its back. \n* The correlation of the size of a clock with the number of people moving it can ensure the safety of the clock. A small, mantle clock for example may only require one mover, while a tall clock can necessitate a number of movers to safely carry it to another location.\n\n=== Proper Storage and display ===\n[[File:Tall Clock MET 192934.jpg|thumb|19th c. Tiffany Longcase Clock photo donated by the Met 192934]] \n\nProper storage and display mechanisms can work to ensure a clock's safety. For safety and mechanical reasons, conservators securely fix long case clocks and wall clocks to a wall to avoid accidents and to ensure the clocks area to run properly. The use of a solid, sturdy surface when storing or displaying a clock can prevent it from falling on a hard surface. A wall clock for example requires a secure attachment \"[...] to a wall if accidents are to be avoided and clocks are to run properly.\u201d <ref name=ICON>{{cite web|title=Care and Conservation of Clocks|url=https://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_clocks.pdf|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=Conservation Register|publisher=The Institute of Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> \nClock cases, which come in many different materials, require special consideration and treatment in their own right. Conservators further advise not exposing a clock to a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire, as this can cause damage to the clock cases and movements.<ref name=ICON/> \n\nMotion sensitive lighting and use of non-direct light sources can limit the amount of light and heat withstood by a clock, both of which are sources of clock damage. A clean clock environment can eliminate opportunities for dangerous contaminants to come into contact with a clock. An [[HVAC]] system can add an extra level of security by removing such contaminants from the air.\n\n==== Correct Humidity and temperature levels ====\nThe [[humidity]] and [[temperature]] of the environment in which a clock is being displayed or stored can adversely affect the clock's condition. Damage may be avoided by maintaining certain levels of humidity and temperature within the clock environment, dependent on the materials from which the clock is constructed.\n:a. '''Wood clocks'''\n:The ideal humidity and temperature ranges for clocks whose cases are made from wood vary depending on the season. In the summer, an environment with a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 40% to 60% [[relative humidity]] is suitable.<ref name=Fahey /> During the winter, an environment with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 35% to 50% relative humidity is prime.<ref name=Fahey />\n:b. '''Metal clocks'''\n:Clocks whose cases are made from metal function well in an environment with a temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 30%.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Running Clocks vs. Static Display ====\n\nClocks can be simple display objects if they are not required to run. This reduces the physical force on the clock. Whereas \u201crunning any functional object will result in wear and handling, which contributes to the degradation of the parts\u201d.<ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/> Running clocks also require winding, which adds to the wear-and-tear of the gears and leads to more handling of the object. <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\n=== Regular Clock Maintenance ===\n[[File:Prim clockwork.jpg|thumb|The mechanics inside a timepiece]] \nRegular maintenance of a clock can ensure its long-term preservation. Conservation experts advise clocks need to be serviced regularly. A clock is a complex mechanical contraption made of a variety of materials and with many small moving parts <ref>Historical Clocks, 2012. Retrieved from: http://publish.illinois.edu/cuhistoricalclocks/preservation/</ref>. Even in perfect conditions lubricants deteriorate, particularly after three years. Clocks should be examined and re-lubricated every three years.  After five years, and certainly no longer than eight years, the whole movement is advised to be dismantled and \u2018cleaned\u2019 if excessive wear and expensive attention is to be avoided <ref name=ICON/> \n\nVisual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. \n:a. '''Cleaning, polishing, and lubrication'''\n:Regular clock surface dusting can negate opportunities for corrosion or abrasion as a result of dust buildup. It should be stated that such surface cleaning can also result in a loss of information about a clock\u2019s history, as \u201c[...] various \u201cdirt\u201d or \u201csalt\u201d deposits can provide precious clues to an objects past [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss>{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=James|title=Concerns regarding the Conservation of Functional Horological Objects|url= https://cool.culturalheritage.org/byauth/moss/concerns.html|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Dust and other contaminants can also cause clockwork wear, as \u201cthe abrasive particle will become imbedded into the bearing wall and act as a piece of \u201csandpaper [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Regular clockwork activities can also lead to wear, as lubricants are known to degrade over time. Loss of clock function due to clockwork wear can be avoided through regular clockwork cleaning, polishing, and lubrication performed by a trained professional. In performing such maintenance, a professional will disassemble clockwork so that it can be thoroughly examined \u201c[...] for worn or broken parts, fatigued springs and accumulations of dirt or oil.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> \n:b. '''Winding and setting'''\n:In order to function as time keepers, and to prevent damage to clockwork, clocks must be regularly wound. An established winding schedule eliminates the threat of over-winding. Regular winding can also ensure that clockwork is still functioning. In setting the correct time, the minute hand is turned clockwise to the desired time.\n\n== Agents of Deterioration ==\n\nDamage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused. Agents of Deterioration  (AOD) are the ten primary categories of threats to heritage objects. These agents of deterioration can occur while an object is in storage, on display, undergoing conservation, or during transportation of the object. <ref name=Canadian>{{cite web |last1=Canadian Conservation Institute |title=Agents of Deterioration |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration.html |website=Government of Canada}}</ref>\n\n=== Physical Force ===\n\nPhysical force is any impact, shock, vibration, pressure or abrasion that causes damage to an object. Physical force damage commonly occurs when handling the object. <ref name=Canadian/> Any excessive physical force will break, damage, splinter the clock frame or easily shatter the glass of the object.\n\nClocks are complex functional objects; many have moveable working parts. Any excessive physical force can damage the mechanics inside the clock which are critical to its operation. Most commonly, these delicate inner-workings are metal, but clocks can be made of any number of materials, from wood to precious metals like silver and gold. They can have enamel inlays or delicate carvings and be a variety of sizes from small watches to large grandfather clocks or clock towers. When a clock is in the custody of a professional institution such as a museum, proper barriers and monitored security are of the wood clocks greatly reduce this risk. Some common sources of physical force damage to clocks are:\n\n:a. '''Mishandling'''\n:The failure of a handler to remove loose items like jewelry or clothing items like scarves from their person can result in these items striking a clock\u2019s surface. A handler who uses his or her bare hands to touch or transport a clock exposes the clock to contaminants, leaving \u201cunsightly and potentially damaging marks.\u201d <ref name=ICON /> A handler who chooses to drag rather than lift a large clock \u201c[...] can place stress on the legs and feet of the clock.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Lifting a clock via false handles or non-sturdy components may cause these parts to snap off of the clock, potentially leading to the clock falling and smashing on a surface.\n:b. '''Over-winding or improper hand setting'''\n:Improper clock winding and hand setting procedures can cause serious damage to clockwork components. The use of an inappropriate key to wind a clock is one such improper procedure. The manner in which a clock is wound is also important, as \u201c[...] considerable and potentially expensive damage can be caused by not winding gently and steadily\u201d,<ref name=ICON /> as well as by turning the key too many times. \n:When hand setting a clock, manually moving the hour or seconds hand rather than the minute hand to set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning.<ref name=ICON /> Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, \u201cRather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.\u201d <ref name=ICON />\n:c. '''Unstable storage or display''' \n:Unsuitable storage and display environments pose great risks to a clock\u2019s condition. Placement of a clock on an unstable surface or non-secure mounting on a wall can cause a clock to fall when external vibrations or human-caused accidents occur.\n\n=== Theft and Vandalism ===\n\nSome clocks are constructed out of precious materials that are a source of temptation for theft. They can be small enough to easily steal. While a minimal concern for most wood clocks, as they are rarely stolen in a burglary, a valuable historic clock may be more susceptible to theft.  \n\nWith regard to vandalism, any public place runs a risk for any object being vandalized. If a clock is on display in a location that does not have conventional display cases for example, large clocks could be vandalize by visitors.  In the case of wood clocks, slashing the wood, smashing the glass, or graffiti would be the most common problems for a public institution.   Obviously, high security, cameras, and inspections after crowds leave, especially for highly coveted antique clocks, would be required in any professional institution.\n\n=== Disassociation  ===\n\nThe disassociation agent of deterioration refers to the separation or loss of individual parts of an object. This is possible in clocks, especially during cleaning or maintenance when the clock has to be disassembled. \u201cClocks can consist of up to five hundred individual components\u201d <ref>{{cite web |last1=The Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material (AICCM) |title=Machinery, clocks and scientific equipment. |url=https://aiccm.org.au/things-we-conserve/machinery-clocks-scientific}}</ref>, so preventive conservation can be complex for these objects. Any one of those components can be lost or misplaced, resulting in damage to the object as a whole. If the part is critical, the clock may no longer run.\n\n=== Incorrect Relative Humidity ===\n\nThe variety of materials used in clocks, can be sensitive to fluctuations in humidity. \u201cA stable and appropriate relative humidity and temperature should be maintained to prevent parts from rusting, corrosion, darkening of silvers, and lubricants from drying out\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\">{{cite web |title=Preventative Conservation Workshop 2017 Part III: Clocks of Staatsburgh |url=http://staatsburghstatehistoricsite.blogspot.com/2017/10/preventative-conservation-workshop-2017.html |website=Staatsburgh State Historic Site}}</ref>. Changes in relative humidity can cause wooded clocks to expand or contract. Fluctuating humidity leads to swelling and shrinking that can \u201cloosen the joints of organic components\u201d.<ref name=\"NPS\">{{cite web |title=The Museum Handbook Part I: Museum Collections |url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/MHI.pdf |website=National Park Service}}</ref> When changes in humidity causes the wooden parts of the clock to expand and contact, the inorganic components of a clock remain fixed, resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>. This is particularly a problem if the wood becomes warped and creates a pressure point against the inorganic interior workings. \n\nHumidity that is too damp can deform organic materials or corrode metals found in clocks.<ref name=\"NPS\"/> High humidity can cause warping, rotting, and mold or fungus growth in a wood clock, and can corrode the metal components of a clock. \n\n\nGlass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally.<ref name=Canadian/>\n\n=== Incorrect Temperature ===\n\nThe temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. \u201c[...] extremes in temperature and humidity\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near \"a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements.\" <ref name=ICON /> In some instances, the heat from the fire contribute to faster deterioration in mantel clocks <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>.\n\nClocks, regardless of the materials they are made of, are susceptible to damage from incorrect temperatures. Like light, temperature that is too high can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials <ref name=\"NPS\"/>. \n\nWith wood clocks, temperature is critical to conservation and preservation. Extreme heat and freezing temperature will significantly damage the wood\u2019s surface.  Incorrect temperatures or uncontrolled climates of storage areas can cause rapid deterioration to wood clocks. Incorrect temperature causes the wood to expand or contract.\n\n=== Pests ===\n\nDepending on the materials the clock is made of, pests may be attracted to it. This is especially true for wooden clocks, since many pests feed on organic materials like wood. Many pests, rodents and insects burrow or feast on wood. Wood-boring insects may infest a clock if it is stored in an environment which supports insect activity and allows them access to the clock<ref name=Canadian/>.\n\nEven for clocks that are made entirely of metal, spiders can cause problems because \u201ctheir webs attract dust and can clog a clock\u2019s movement\u201d.<ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nPests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:\n:* '''[[Carpet beetle (disambiguation)|Carpet beetle]]'''<!--intentional link to DAB page-->- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such \u201c[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n:* '''[[Powderpost beetle]]'''- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n=== Light: Infrared and Ultraviolet ===\n\nOver-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways; many of the materials used in clocks are prone to light damage, both ultraviolet and infrared.\n\nVisible light damage can cause discoloration and deterioration. Exposure to infrared can increase the temperature of the wood, this can cause increased oxidation, which causing damage to the wood\u2019s surface and develop irregular markings.\n\nUltraviolet light can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials like wood.<ref name=\"NPS\"/> Exposure to direct sunlight (UV) over long periods of time will damage the wood by warping, fading, dry-rotting, and cause damage to the wood structure. Exposure to both UV and infrared light can alter, damage or ruin any stains or finish on a wood clock.\n\nLight agents of deterioration can be associated with temperature agents of deterioration, depending on the nature of the light source. Heat from a light source can also cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached.<ref name=Fahey /> Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration \u201c[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or \u201calligatored\u201d appearance.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\n=== Pollutants ===\n[[File:Dust_buildup_on_a_clock_case.jpg|thumb|right|Dust buildup on top of a clock case.]]\n\nPollutants are any elements which can corrode, degrade, or alter the condition of an object. Chemicals, smoke, airborne particles, and gases are all pollutants that can damage a clock. The following are two such examples:  \n\n:* '''Dust''' is one such contaminant which settles on a clock\u2019s surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion. Dust and other airborne abrasives can build up inside clocks and impeded and wear down their mechanisms. In the case of mantel clocks that have been displayed above fireplaces, these abrasives include soot.\n \n:* '''Oil''' is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched.\n\nOther pollutants can cause oxidization and tarnishing in metal clocks. The cleaning agents used to remove pollutants can result in a chemical reaction with previously used lubricants or cleaning agents or with the materials of the clock. Excessive cleaning can \u201ccause more issues like over-drying of bearings and stress corrosion cracking of brass that is exposed to ammonia solution\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>. The mechanisms within clocks are highly sensitive to external matter like oils from fingertips or dust, so much so, that it can cause the machine to malfunction if it gets into the wrong area <ref name=\"Moss\"/>. For static displays, the functionality of a clock is not always necessary, but limiting the introduction of organic matter through mishandling will prevent unnecessary decay over the life of the clock. The wood used in many wood clocks are very porous, and easily absorb the elements around their environment and affect the integrity of the wood. Well-sealed and insulated rooms mitigate pollutant damage.\n\n=== Fire  ===\n\nLike most heritage objects, clocks are highly vulnerable to fire. Not only are the fluctuations in temperature harmful, most clocks will be irreparably damaged if exposed to fire. Errant embers from a fireplace can be a potential threat to mantle clocks. Other threats may be any open flame, wood burning stove, heater, or pilot light. \n\nMany clocks are small enough that evacuating them during an emergency could be possible. Large clocks that belong to buildings, like clock towers, may survive fire and could possibly be restored.\n\n=== Water  ===\n\nWater damage is one of the greatest agents of deterioration for a wood clock; water warps, swells and rots the wood. The components of many clocks are extremely susceptible to water damage. Because of the complexity of these objects, they are very challenging to dry if water damage occurs. It may be extremely difficult, depending upon the severity of the water damage, to repair or restore the clock to its correct condition. Often times with salvaging warped or rotted wood, it has to be replaced entirely. Water damage also causes corrosion to the internal mechanisms of the clock.\n\n== Specific Types of Clock Damage ==\nDamage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed.\n\n==== Wood damage ====\nDue to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage.<ref name=Fahey /> Such changes in character from the wood's original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include \u201c[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives.\" <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Metal damage ====\nSimilar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This \u201c[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Finish or paint damage ====\nFinish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock's surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products \u201ccan actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands.\n\n==== Interior or clockwork damage ====\nClockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement.\n\n==== Improper cleaning and polishing ====\nMany cleaners and polishers contain properties that \u201c[...] have been proven to age poorly.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Resultantly, the use of such cleaners and polishers can prove detrimental. The use of ammonia based cleaning products for example on brass clock components can lead to an irreversible form of damage called [[Stress Corrosion Cracking]].<ref name=Moss /> Depending on the type of metal on which it is used, a metallic brush employed to apply cleaning products not only can create the proper conditions for corrosion, but can \u201c[...] remove any protective oxide layers even with careful use.\u201d <ref name=Moss />\n\n==== Improper lubrication ====\nAttempts by non-professionals to lubricate or repair clockwork can lead to serious damage and loss of clock functionality. A lubricant applied without first cleaning and polishing clockwork to remove the previous lubricant and contaminants can result in wear rather than prevent it.<ref name=Moss /> The combination of the newly applied lubricant with the previous lubricant often results in \u201c[...] an unwanted chemical reaction between the two lubricants [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> A careless lubricant choice can result in the use of inappropriate or \"Poor-quality oil\" on clockwork, which \"can become sticky leading to mechanical problems.\" <ref name=Fahey /> The inexperience of a non-professional can also lead to \u201cthe use of too much oil, or oil in the wrong place\u201d <ref name=ICON /> during attempts to lubricate clockwork. The application of too much of a lubricant can be damaging because it \u201c[...] usually causes the lubrication to run out of the bearing and by capillary action will cause the bearing to go dry.\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Totally ignoring the lubrication needs of clockwork can be jeopardizing not only because of lubricant degradation, but because of the acidic nature of the organic lubricants often used in antique clocks.<ref name=Moss />\n\n== Conservation and restoration ==\nInterventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation.\n\n=== Conservators ===\n\nA [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to \u201c[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as \u201cSometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].\u201d <ref name=NAWCC>{{cite web|title=Horological Conservation|url= http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/member-resources/horological-conservation<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=NAWCC|publisher=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided.\n\n=== Example: Anglesey Abbey Pagoda Clock ===\n[[Horological]] conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house [[Anglesey Abbey]] by the [[National Trust]].

Removal of these items prior to clock handling can lower the risk of damage. \n* Wearing \u201c[...] cotton or Nitrile gloves when handling the metal portions of the clock\u201d <ref name=Fahey>{{cite web|last1=Fahey|first1=Mary M.|title=The Care and Preservation of Clocks|url=http://www.thehenryford.org/research/caring/clocks.aspx|website=Benson Ford Research Center|publisher=The Henry Ford|accessdate=19 November 2015}}</ref> can limit opportunities for transfer of contaminants from hands to clock surfaces. \n* [[Pendulum]] damage during clock movement can be prevented by either removing the pendulum or fixing it within the interior of the clock via a latch or padding prior to clock movement.<ref name=Fahey /> This can also prevent damage to other interior components.\n* A clock \"[...] should always be grasped at its most sturdy area\" <ref name=Fahey /> and moved from one location to the next on its back. \n* The correlation of the size of a clock with the number of people moving it can ensure the safety of the clock. A small, mantle clock for example may only require one mover, while a tall clock can necessitate a number of movers to safely carry it to another location.\n\n=== Proper Storage and display ===\n[[File:Tall Clock MET 192934.jpg|thumb|19th c. Tiffany Longcase Clock photo donated by the Met 192934]] \n\nProper storage and display mechanisms can work to ensure a clock's safety. For safety and mechanical reasons, conservators securely fix long case clocks and wall clocks to a wall to avoid accidents and to ensure the clocks area to run properly. The use of a solid, sturdy surface when storing or displaying a clock can prevent it from falling on a hard surface. A wall clock for example requires a secure attachment \"[...] to a wall if accidents are to be avoided and clocks are to run properly.\u201d <ref name=ICON>{{cite web|title=Care and Conservation of Clocks|url=https://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_clocks.pdf|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=Conservation Register|publisher=The Institute of Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> \nClock cases, which come in many different materials, require special consideration and treatment in their own right. Conservators further advise not exposing a clock to a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire, as this can cause damage to the clock cases and movements.<ref name=ICON/> \n\nMotion sensitive lighting and use of non-direct light sources can limit the amount of light and heat withstood by a clock, both of which are sources of clock damage. A clean clock environment can eliminate opportunities for dangerous contaminants to come into contact with a clock. An [[HVAC]] system can add an extra level of security by removing such contaminants from the air.\n\n==== Correct Humidity and temperature levels ====\nThe [[humidity]] and [[temperature]] of the environment in which a clock is being displayed or stored can adversely affect the clock's condition. Damage may be avoided by maintaining certain levels of humidity and temperature within the clock environment, dependent on the materials from which the clock is constructed.\n:a. '''Wood clocks'''\n:The ideal humidity and temperature ranges for clocks whose cases are made from wood vary depending on the season. In the summer, an environment with a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 40% to 60% [[relative humidity]] is suitable.<ref name=Fahey /> During the winter, an environment with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 35% to 50% relative humidity is prime.<ref name=Fahey />\n:b. '''Metal clocks'''\n:Clocks whose cases are made from metal function well in an environment with a temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 30%.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Running Clocks vs. Static Display ====\n\nClocks can be simple display objects if they are not required to run. This reduces the physical force on the clock. Whereas \u201crunning any functional object will result in wear and handling, which contributes to the degradation of the parts\u201d.<ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/> Running clocks also require winding, which adds to the wear-and-tear of the gears and leads to more handling of the object. <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\n=== Regular Clock Maintenance ===\n[[File:Prim clockwork.jpg|thumb|The mechanics inside a timepiece]] [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 22:46, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\nRegular maintenance of a clock can ensure its long-term preservation. Conservation experts advise clocks need to be serviced regularly. A clock is a complex mechanical contraption made of a variety of materials and with many small moving parts <ref>Historical Clocks, 2012. Retrieved from: http://publish.illinois.edu/cuhistoricalclocks/preservation/</ref>. Even in perfect conditions lubricants deteriorate, particularly after three years. Clocks should be examined and re-lubricated every three years.  After five years, and certainly no longer than eight years, the whole movement is advised to be dismantled and \u2018cleaned\u2019 if excessive wear and expensive attention is to be avoided <ref name=ICON/> [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:06, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\nVisual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. \n:a. '''Cleaning, polishing, and lubrication'''\n:Regular clock surface dusting can negate opportunities for corrosion or abrasion as a result of dust buildup. It should be stated that such surface cleaning can also result in a loss of information about a clock\u2019s history, as \u201c[...] various \u201cdirt\u201d or \u201csalt\u201d deposits can provide precious clues to an objects past [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss>{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=James|title=Concerns regarding the Conservation of Functional Horological Objects|url= https://cool.culturalheritage.org/byauth/moss/concerns.html|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Dust and other contaminants can also cause clockwork wear, as \u201cthe abrasive particle will become imbedded into the bearing wall and act as a piece of \u201csandpaper [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Regular clockwork activities can also lead to wear, as lubricants are known to degrade over time. Loss of clock function due to clockwork wear can be avoided through regular clockwork cleaning, polishing, and lubrication performed by a trained professional. In performing such maintenance, a professional will disassemble clockwork so that it can be thoroughly examined \u201c[...] for worn or broken parts, fatigued springs and accumulations of dirt or oil.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> \n:b. '''Winding and setting'''\n:In order to function as time keepers, and to prevent damage to clockwork, clocks must be regularly wound. An established winding schedule eliminates the threat of over-winding. Regular winding can also ensure that clockwork is still functioning. In setting the correct time, the minute hand is turned clockwise to the desired time.\n\n== Agents of Deterioration ==\n\nDamage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused. Agents of Deterioration  (AOD) are the ten primary categories of threats to heritage objects. These agents of deterioration can occur while an object is in storage, on display, undergoing conservation, or during transportation of the object. <ref name=Canadian>{{cite web |last1=Canadian Conservation Institute |title=Agents of Deterioration |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration.html |website=Government of Canada}}</ref>\n\n=== Physical Force ===\n\nPhysical force is any impact, shock, vibration, pressure or abrasion that causes damage to an object. Physical force damage commonly occurs when handling the object. <ref name=Canadian/> Any excessive physical force will break, damage, splinter the clock frame or easily shatter the glass of the object.\n\nClocks are complex functional objects; many have moveable working parts. Any excessive physical force can damage the mechanics inside the clock which are critical to its operation. Most commonly, these delicate inner-workings are metal, but clocks can be made of any number of materials, from wood to precious metals like silver and gold. They can have enamel inlays or delicate carvings and be a variety of sizes from small watches to large grandfather clocks or clock towers. When a clock is in the custody of a professional institution such as a museum, proper barriers and monitored security are of the wood clocks greatly reduce this risk. Some common sources of physical force damage to clocks are:\n\n:a. '''Mishandling'''\n:The failure of a handler to remove loose items like jewelry or clothing items like scarves from their person can result in these items striking a clock\u2019s surface. A handler who uses his or her bare hands to touch or transport a clock exposes the clock to contaminants, leaving \u201cunsightly and potentially damaging marks.\u201d <ref name=ICON /> A handler who chooses to drag rather than lift a large clock \u201c[...] can place stress on the legs and feet of the clock.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Lifting a clock via false handles or non-sturdy components may cause these parts to snap off of the clock, potentially leading to the clock falling and smashing on a surface.\n:b. '''Over-winding or improper hand setting'''\n:Improper clock winding and hand setting procedures can cause serious damage to clockwork components. The use of an inappropriate key to wind a clock is one such improper procedure. The manner in which a clock is wound is also important, as \u201c[...] considerable and potentially expensive damage can be caused by not winding gently and steadily\u201d,<ref name=ICON /> as well as by turning the key too many times. \n:When hand setting a clock, manually moving the hour or seconds hand rather than the minute hand to set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning.<ref name=ICON /> Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, \u201cRather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.\u201d <ref name=ICON />\n:c. '''Unstable storage or display''' \n:Unsuitable storage and display environments pose great risks to a clock\u2019s condition. Placement of a clock on an unstable surface or non-secure mounting on a wall can cause a clock to fall when external vibrations or human-caused accidents occur.\n\n=== Theft and Vandalism ===\n\nSome clocks are constructed out of precious materials that are a source of temptation for theft. They can be small enough to easily steal. While a minimal concern for most wood clocks, as they are rarely stolen in a burglary, a valuable historic clock may be more susceptible to theft.  \n\nWith regard to vandalism, any public place runs a risk for any object being vandalized. If a clock is on display in a location that does not have conventional display cases for example, large clocks could be vandalize by visitors.  In the case of wood clocks, slashing the wood, smashing the glass, or graffiti would be the most common problems for a public institution.   Obviously, high security, cameras, and inspections after crowds leave, especially for highly coveted antique clocks, would be required in any professional institution.\n\n=== Disassociation  ===\n\nThe disassociation agent of deterioration refers to the separation or loss of individual parts of an object. This is possible in clocks, especially during cleaning or maintenance when the clock has to be disassembled. \u201cClocks can consist of up to five hundred individual components\u201d <ref>{{cite web |last1=The Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material (AICCM) |title=Machinery, clocks and scientific equipment. |url=https://aiccm.org.au/things-we-conserve/machinery-clocks-scientific}}</ref>, so preventive conservation can be complex for these objects. Any one of those components can be lost or misplaced, resulting in damage to the object as a whole. If the part is critical, the clock may no longer run.\n\n=== Incorrect Relative Humidity ===\n\nThe variety of materials used in clocks, can be sensitive to fluctuations in humidity. \u201cA stable and appropriate relative humidity and temperature should be maintained to prevent parts from rusting, corrosion, darkening of silvers, and lubricants from drying out\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\">{{cite web |title=Preventative Conservation Workshop 2017 Part III: Clocks of Staatsburgh |url=http://staatsburghstatehistoricsite.blogspot.com/2017/10/preventative-conservation-workshop-2017.html |website=Staatsburgh State Historic Site}}</ref>. Changes in relative humidity can cause wooded clocks to expand or contract. Fluctuating humidity leads to swelling and shrinking that can \u201cloosen the joints of organic components\u201d.<ref name=\"NPS\">{{cite web |title=The Museum Handbook Part I: Museum Collections |url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/MHI.pdf |website=National Park Service}}</ref> When changes in humidity causes the wooden parts of the clock to expand and contact, the inorganic components of a clock remain fixed, resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>. This is particularly a problem if the wood becomes warped and creates a pressure point against the inorganic interior workings. \n\nHumidity that is too damp can deform organic materials or corrode metals found in clocks.<ref name=\"NPS\"/> High humidity can cause warping, rotting, and mold or fungus growth in a wood clock, and can corrode the metal components of a clock. \n\n\nGlass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally.<ref name=Canadian/>\n\n=== Incorrect Temperature ===\n\nThe temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. \u201c[...] extremes in temperature and humidity\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near \"a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements.\" <ref name=ICON /> In some instances, the heat from the fire contribute to faster deterioration in mantel clocks <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>.\n\nClocks, regardless of the materials they are made of, are susceptible to damage from incorrect temperatures. Like light, temperature that is too high can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials <ref name=\"NPS\"/>. \n\nWith wood clocks, temperature is critical to conservation and preservation. Extreme heat and freezing temperature will significantly damage the wood\u2019s surface.  Incorrect temperatures or uncontrolled climates of storage areas can cause rapid deterioration to wood clocks. Incorrect temperature causes the wood to expand or contract.\n\n=== Pests ===\n\nDepending on the materials the clock is made of, pests may be attracted to it. This is especially true for wooden clocks, since many pests feed on organic materials like wood. Many pests, rodents and insects burrow or feast on wood. Wood-boring insects may infest a clock if it is stored in an environment which supports insect activity and allows them access to the clock<ref name=Canadian/>.\n\nEven for clocks that are made entirely of metal, spiders can cause problems because \u201ctheir webs attract dust and can clog a clock\u2019s movement\u201d.<ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nPests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:\n:* '''[[Carpet beetle (disambiguation)|Carpet beetle]]'''<!--intentional link to DAB page-->- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such \u201c[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n:* '''[[Powderpost beetle]]'''- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n=== Light: Infrared and Ultraviolet ===\n\nOver-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways; many of the materials used in clocks are prone to light damage, both ultraviolet and infrared.\n\nVisible light damage can cause discoloration and deterioration. Exposure to infrared can increase the temperature of the wood, this can cause increased oxidation, which causing damage to the wood\u2019s surface and develop irregular markings.\n\nUltraviolet light can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials like wood.<ref name=\"NPS\"/> Exposure to direct sunlight (UV) over long periods of time will damage the wood by warping, fading, dry-rotting, and cause damage to the wood structure. Exposure to both UV and infrared light can alter, damage or ruin any stains or finish on a wood clock.\n\nLight agents of deterioration can be associated with temperature agents of deterioration, depending on the nature of the light source. Heat from a light source can also cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached.<ref name=Fahey /> Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration \u201c[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or \u201calligatored\u201d appearance.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\n=== Pollutants ===\n[[File:Dust_buildup_on_a_clock_case.jpg|thumb|right|Dust buildup on top of a clock case.]]\n\nPollutants are any elements which can corrode, degrade, or alter the condition of an object. Chemicals, smoke, airborne particles, and gases are all pollutants that can damage a clock. The following are two such examples:  \n\n:* '''Dust''' is one such contaminant which settles on a clock\u2019s surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion. Dust and other airborne abrasives can build up inside clocks and impeded and wear down their mechanisms. In the case of mantel clocks that have been displayed above fireplaces, these abrasives include soot.\n \n:* '''Oil''' is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched.\n\nOther pollutants can cause oxidization and tarnishing in metal clocks. The cleaning agents used to remove pollutants can result in a chemical reaction with previously used lubricants or cleaning agents or with the materials of the clock. Excessive cleaning can \u201ccause more issues like over-drying of bearings and stress corrosion cracking of brass that is exposed to ammonia solution\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>. The mechanisms within clocks are highly sensitive to external matter like oils from fingertips or dust, so much so, that it can cause the machine to malfunction if it gets into the wrong area <ref name=\"Moss\"/>. For static displays, the functionality of a clock is not always necessary, but limiting the introduction of organic matter through mishandling will prevent unnecessary decay over the life of the clock. The wood used in many wood clocks are very porous, and easily absorb the elements around their environment and affect the integrity of the wood. Well-sealed and insulated rooms mitigate pollutant damage.\n\n=== Fire  ===\n\nLike most heritage objects, clocks are highly vulnerable to fire. Not only are the fluctuations in temperature harmful, most clocks will be irreparably damaged if exposed to fire. Errant embers from a fireplace can be a potential threat to mantle clocks. Other threats may be any open flame, wood burning stove, heater, or pilot light. \n\nMany clocks are small enough that evacuating them during an emergency could be possible. Large clocks that belong to buildings, like clock towers, may survive fire and could possibly be restored.\n\n=== Water  ===\n\nWater damage is one of the greatest agents of deterioration for a wood clock; water warps, swells and rots the wood. The components of many clocks are extremely susceptible to water damage. Because of the complexity of these objects, they are very challenging to dry if water damage occurs. It may be extremely difficult, depending upon the severity of the water damage, to repair or restore the clock to its correct condition. Often times with salvaging warped or rotted wood, it has to be replaced entirely. Water damage also causes corrosion to the internal mechanisms of the clock.\n\n== Specific Types of Clock Damage ==\nDamage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed.\n\n==== Wood damage ====\nDue to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage.<ref name=Fahey /> Such changes in character from the wood's original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include \u201c[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives.\" <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Metal damage ====\nSimilar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This \u201c[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Finish or paint damage ====\nFinish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock's surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products \u201ccan actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands.\n\n==== Interior or clockwork damage ====\nClockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement.\n\n==== Improper cleaning and polishing ====\nMany cleaners and polishers contain properties that \u201c[...] have been proven to age poorly.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Resultantly, the use of such cleaners and polishers can prove detrimental. The use of ammonia based cleaning products for example on brass clock components can lead to an irreversible form of damage called [[Stress Corrosion Cracking]].<ref name=Moss /> Depending on the type of metal on which it is used, a metallic brush employed to apply cleaning products not only can create the proper conditions for corrosion, but can \u201c[...] remove any protective oxide layers even with careful use.\u201d <ref name=Moss />\n\n==== Improper lubrication ====\nAttempts by non-professionals to lubricate or repair clockwork can lead to serious damage and loss of clock functionality. A lubricant applied without first cleaning and polishing clockwork to remove the previous lubricant and contaminants can result in wear rather than prevent it.<ref name=Moss /> The combination of the newly applied lubricant with the previous lubricant often results in \u201c[...] an unwanted chemical reaction between the two lubricants [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> A careless lubricant choice can result in the use of inappropriate or \"Poor-quality oil\" on clockwork, which \"can become sticky leading to mechanical problems.\" <ref name=Fahey /> The inexperience of a non-professional can also lead to \u201cthe use of too much oil, or oil in the wrong place\u201d <ref name=ICON /> during attempts to lubricate clockwork. The application of too much of a lubricant can be damaging because it \u201c[...] usually causes the lubrication to run out of the bearing and by capillary action will cause the bearing to go dry.\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Totally ignoring the lubrication needs of clockwork can be jeopardizing not only because of lubricant degradation, but because of the acidic nature of the organic lubricants often used in antique clocks.<ref name=Moss />\n\n== Conservation and restoration ==\nInterventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation.\n\n=== Conservators ===\n\nA [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to \u201c[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as \u201cSometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].\u201d <ref name=NAWCC>{{cite web|title=Horological Conservation|url= http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/member-resources/horological-conservation<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=NAWCC|publisher=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided.\n\n=== Example: Anglesey Abbey Pagoda Clock ===\n[[Horological]] conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house [[Anglesey Abbey]] by the [[National Trust]]. In starting the project, examination of the clock revealed that \"The automata and clock elements seem to be running, but struggling, and the music sounds as though it needs a few extra hands to help play its tune.\" <ref>{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Brittany N.|title=Anglesey Abbey\u2019s Pagoda Clock|url=https://westdeanconservation.wordpress.com/2012/06/05/anglesey-abbeys-pagoda-clock/|date=5 June 2012|website=Current Projects|publisher=West Dean Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> The clock was then disassembled, and care was taken to document information about each of the over 600 components both textually and photographically, including measurements and where each component fits within the clock. \"After examination, each component was cleaned and dried, wrapped in acid-free tissue, and stored with the catalogue number.\" <ref>{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Brittany N.|title=The Pagoda Part 2|url=https://westdeanconservation.wordpress.com/2012/06/28/the-pagoda-part-2/|date=28 June 2012|website=Current Projects|publisher=West Dean Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Cultural Conservation-Restoration |state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Clocks]]\n[[Category:Conservation and restoration]]\n[[Hr:Konzervacija satova]]\n", "name_user": "Daniel Cull", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRegular Clock Maintenance:removing signature", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_and_restoration_of_clocks"}

Immigration continued over the next 86 years although at a comparatively low rate.\n\nThe dictatorship of [[Rafael Trujillo]] from 1930 to 1961 greatly constrained foreign travel by Dominicans. In 1960, there were 1,812 Dominicans in Puerto Rico, some of whom were \"returning\" descendants of Puerto Ricans who had themselves migrated to the Dominican Republic.\n\nHistorically, there has been very high migration between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, not only during the Taino era, but also during the Spanish colonial era up until modern times. It was very, very common, due to similar cultures, for newcomers to intermarry and assimilate easily into the local culture. It is estimated that significant portions of both islands have some distant ancestry from the other island due to the constant flow between both islands especially in the 18th to mid 20th centuries.\n\n==Recently==\nDominican migration increased sharply after 1961 as a result of political events, of which the first was the assassination of Trujillo that year. Many politicians and other members of the conservative former regime, as well as government employees, left the country, many of them for Puerto Rico. The next major political event to drive emigration was the [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the elected, leftist president [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]] in 1963. Then followed the Dominican Civil War in 1965 after a revolt to restore Bosch. The United States [[Operation Power Pack|invaded the Dominican Republic]] a few days into the conflict, and one of its policies was to prevent renewed civil war by issuing visas to opponents or potential opponents of the newly-elected US-backed conservative regime of [[Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer]] (who was incidentally, like Bosch, of Puerto Rican ancestry). Many of the visaholders traveled to Puerto Rico.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nPolitics continued to play a role in emigration in succeeding decades, as [[Government of the Dominican Republic|presidential election years]] produced emigration peaks whenever Balaguer, a member of the former Trujillo regime, won the presidency, as happened in 1966, 1970, 1974, 1986, and 1990. As a result, most of the Dominican emigration was middle-class and skilled, including many managers and professionals.<ref name=Duany/>\n\nAlthough there are substantial [[upper class]] and [[middle class]] segments in the Dominican Republic, the country also has a high poverty rate. Since the 1970s, the poor [[economy of the Dominican Republic]] has rampantly driven emigration. Overall, between 1966 and 2002 119,000 Dominicans were legally admitted to Puerto Rico, while many thousands arrived illegally. Most emigrants, however, are far from destitute, as they tend to be jobholders in the Dominican Republic, many in skilled occupations such as mechanic, mason, seamstress, and nurse. Such migrants have been attracted by the [[economy of Puerto Rico]]'s higher wages, which have generally tended to rise in relation to Dominican wages since the early 1980s, when an era of frequent devaluation of the Dominican peso began. Economic crises that beset the Dominican Republic in the 1980s further increased emigration. Despite strong economic growth, the 1990s marked the peak in Dominican emigration because of the high income inequality.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Castro |first=Max J. |author2=Thomas D.

Though, many Dominicans who moved to Puerto Rico, stayed and started a life there, some Dominicans (and even other Latinos/Caribbeans like Haitians and Cubans) used it as a temporary stop-over point to the US mainland, particularly to cities like New York and Miami. Although, 2010 census estimates put the number of Dominicans living in Puerto Rico at 68,000 , there are estimates that put the number as high as 300,000 , with many undocumented.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-01-25-mn-5757-story.html]</ref> Some Dominican criminals take advantage of Puerto Rico's territory status, by doing crimes such as Identity theft of Puerto Rican US citizens, and drug distribution working with Puerto Rican criminals to ship Colombian drugs to the island and then further be shipped to the US mainland. However, the vast majority of Dominicans come for a better life, to start a business, and live a positive lifestyle.\n\n==Illegal immigration==\n[[File:Dominican boat.jpg|frame|Abandoned yola in the coast of [[Aguadilla, Puerto Rico]]]]\nThe [[Illegal immigration|illegal or undocumented]] component of the Dominican immigration to Puerto Rico has increased over recent decades, becoming large enough to attract great attention, both in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. The first recorded illegal trip took place in 1972, and perhaps 28% of all Dominicans in Puerto Rico were undocumented in 1996, during the peak decade of Dominican immigration to the Commonwealth; many of the documented residents had regularized their originally undocumented status.<!--There were believed to be between 100,000 and 150,000 illegal Dominican immigrants living in Puerto Rico as of 2007.<ref name=ap> {{cite news |first=|last=|title= Pedro Saul Perez |url=http://www.legacy.com/Obituaries.asp?Page=APStory&Id=13499|work= [[Associated Press]] |publisher=Legacy.com |date=2007-10-02 |accessdate=2007-10-03}}</ref> dead link--> Illegal immigration has been one of the most recurrent themes in Puerto Rican [[news media]] during the first decade of the 21st century.\n\nIllegal trips usually take place in ''yolas'' (small wooden boats), usually overcrowded, as trip planners and boat captains seek to realize the greatest profit from the ventures. A trip on a ''yola'' takes 26\u201328 hours and takes place over the [[Puerto Rico Trench]] (an underwater [[Volcanic crater|crater]] area) or through the [[Mona Passage]]. Accounts by survivors include people being either eaten alive by sharks or forced to jump into the sea when there is a danger of sinking. Others tell of seeing their loved ones left behind to drown after a heavy wave has overturned one of these ''yolas'', and many others tell of corpses left on board. Travelers sometimes die of [[starvation]] or [[dehydration]] since the ''yolas'' can get lost out at sea for days, and many have no type of navigation equipment on board to steer them in the right direction.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/12/world/dominicans-saved-from-sea-tell-of-attacks-and-deaths-of-thirst.html| title=Dominicans Saved From Sea Tell of Attacks and Deaths of Thirst | publisher=The New York Times| date=2004-08-12| accessdate=2008-03-05}}</ref>\n\nNoted tragedies on such trips include a 1989 sinking near [[Mona Island]] where as many as 500 perished, and other, comparatively small tragedies where groups of 30 or more passengers have died. Perhaps the most famous of these tragic trips was the Nagua Tragedy, named so because the yola heading to Puerto Rico that time sunk while trying to make its way out of a beach in [[Nagua]]. More than one hundred died, including the boat's captain and the trip planner.\n\nIn November 2008, a group of 33 illegal Dominican migrants who were en route to Puerto Rico were forced to resort to cannibalism after they were lost at sea for over 15 days before being rescued by a [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] patrol boat.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27531105 Dominican migrant: We ate flesh to survive - A small group turned to cannibalism after being stranded in mid-ocean], NBC News, November 4, 2008</ref>\n\nNot all illegal trips to Puerto Rico from the Dominican Republic end in tragedy. These trips are massively scheduled by traffickers, who sometimes travel up to three times each week from Puerto Rico to illegally bring Dominicans. But, because of the large amount of lives that have been lost in many of these trips, both the governments of [[Government of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]] and the Dominican Republic have launched [[mass media]] campaigns to try to reduce them. In the Dominican Republic, videos of dead bodies on the water are shown on television to try to deter people from travelling to Puerto Rico on ''yolas''. The traffickers face long periods in jail if caught, whereas the travelers are deported to the Dominican Republic, where they do not face criminal charges.\n\nIn 2009 an order was given by Governor [[Luis Fortu\u00f1o]] to shut off essential services, such as water and electricity, to Villas del Sol, a [[shantytown]] within the municipality of [[Toa Baja, Puerto Rico|Toa Baja]]. The shantytown consisted mainly of homes built illegally on flood-prone government-owned land. The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] bought these homes from the Puerto Rican Government in order to keep them from being used further. In January 2010 the island government began demolishing some of the homes whose residents are both U.S. citizens and undocumented aliens, mainly of Dominican origin.\n\n==Current circumstances==\nDominicans in Puerto Rico are largely disadvantaged [[Politics of Puerto Rico|politically]], in great part because so many are not citizens. They are also disadvantaged economically, and possess on average much lower [[Education in Puerto Rico|levels of education]] than the mainstream of Puerto Ricans on the island. That is in contrast to their situation in the 1970s, when a demographic study considered Dominican immigrants to be \"privileged\" and an \"elite,\" as a large percentage of Dominican immigrants were professionals and managers. Their present characteristics have made them easy victims for ethnic discrimination, which include accusations of excessive use of government programs. They are often targets of prejudice and [[racism]] as well. In response, dozens of organizations have sprouted to increase the group's political participation, although these efforts' full effectiveness is hampered by inadequate coordination.\n\nThe group is not ignored by Dominican politicians, however. The main [[List of political parties in the Dominican Republic|Dominican parties]] campaign in Puerto Rico during presidential elections and raise important amounts of funds from the Dominican residents. Dominicans in Puerto Rico send millions of dollars per month to their relatives in the Dominican Republic, and are thus also important as a source of foreign currency for the D.R.\n\nThe 2010 census estimated a population of 68,036 Dominicans in Puerto Rico,<ref name=ACS>{{cite web |url =http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_11_3YR_S0201PR&prodType=table|archive-url =https://archive.today/20200212213559/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_11_3YR_S0201PR&prodType=table|url-status =dead|archive-date =2020-02-12|title= SELECTED POPULATION PROFILE IN PUERTO RICO 2009-2011 American Community Survey 3-Year Estimates |accessdate=2011-11-09 |work=Data Set: 2010 U.S. Census |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}</ref> equal to 1.8% of the Commonwealth's population.

Many of the visaholders traveled to Puerto Rico.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nPolitics continued to play a role in emigration in succeeding decades, as [[Government of the Dominican Republic|presidential election years]] produced emigration peaks whenever Balaguer, a member of the former Trujillo regime, won the presidency, as happened in 1966, 1970, 1974, 1986, and 1990. As a result, most of the Dominican emigration was middle-class and skilled, including many managers and professionals.<ref name=Duany/>\n\nAlthough there are substantial [[upper class]] and [[middle class]] segments in the Dominican Republic, the country also has a high poverty rate. Since the 1970s, the poor [[economy of the Dominican Republic]] has rampantly driven emigration. Overall, between 1966 and 2002 119,000 Dominicans were legally admitted to Puerto Rico, while many thousands arrived illegally. Most emigrants, however, are far from destitute, as they tend to be jobholders in the Dominican Republic, many in skilled occupations such as mechanic, mason, seamstress, and nurse. Such migrants have been attracted by the [[economy of Puerto Rico]]'s higher wages, which have generally tended to rise in relation to Dominican wages since the early 1980s, when an era of frequent devaluation of the Dominican peso began. Economic crises that beset the Dominican Republic in the 1980s further increased emigration. Despite strong economic growth, the 1990s marked the peak in Dominican emigration because of the high income inequality.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Castro |first=Max J. |author2=Thomas D.

Though, many Dominicans who moved to Puerto Rico, stayed and started a life there, some Dominicans (and even other Latinos/Caribbeans like Haitians and Cubans) used it as a temporary stop-over point to the US mainland, particularly to cities like New York and Miami. Although, 2010 census estimates put the number of Dominicans living in Puerto Rico at 68,000 , there are estimates that put the number as high as 300,000 , with many undocumented.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-01-25-mn-5757-story.html]</ref> Some Dominican criminals take advantage of Puerto Rico's territory status, by doing crimes such as Identity theft of Puerto Rican US citizens, and drug distribution working with Puerto Rican criminals to ship Colombian drugs to the island and then further be shipped to the US mainland. However, the vast majority of Dominicans come for a better life, to start a business, and live a positive lifestyle.\n\n==Illegal immigration==\n[[File:Dominican boat.jpg|frame|Abandoned yola in the coast of [[Aguadilla, Puerto Rico]]]]\nThe [[Illegal immigration|illegal or undocumented]] component of the Dominican immigration to Puerto Rico has increased over recent decades, becoming large enough to attract great attention, both in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. The first recorded illegal trip took place in 1972, and perhaps 28% of all Dominicans in Puerto Rico were undocumented in 1996, during the peak decade of Dominican immigration to the Commonwealth; many of the documented residents had regularized their originally undocumented status.<!--There were believed to be between 100,000 and 150,000 illegal Dominican immigrants living in Puerto Rico as of 2007.<ref name=ap> {{cite news |first=|last=|title= Pedro Saul Perez |url=http://www.legacy.com/Obituaries.asp?Page=APStory&Id=13499|work= [[Associated Press]] |publisher=Legacy.com |date=2007-10-02 |accessdate=2007-10-03}}</ref> dead link--> Illegal immigration has been one of the most recurrent themes in Puerto Rican [[news media]] during the first decade of the 21st century.\n\nIllegal trips usually take place in ''yolas'' (small wooden boats), usually overcrowded, as trip planners and boat captains seek to realize the greatest profit from the ventures. A trip on a ''yola'' takes 26\u201328 hours and takes place over the [[Puerto Rico Trench]] (an underwater [[Volcanic crater|crater]] area) or through the [[Mona Passage]]. Accounts by survivors include people being either eaten alive by sharks or forced to jump into the sea when there is a danger of sinking. Others tell of seeing their loved ones left behind to drown after a heavy wave has overturned one of these ''yolas'', and many others tell of corpses left on board. Travelers sometimes die of [[starvation]] or [[dehydration]] since the ''yolas'' can get lost out at sea for days, and many have no type of navigation equipment on board to steer them in the right direction.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/12/world/dominicans-saved-from-sea-tell-of-attacks-and-deaths-of-thirst.html| title=Dominicans Saved From Sea Tell of Attacks and Deaths of Thirst | publisher=The New York Times| date=2004-08-12| accessdate=2008-03-05}}</ref>\n\nNoted tragedies on such trips include a 1989 sinking near [[Mona Island]] where as many as 500 perished, and other, comparatively small tragedies where groups of 30 or more passengers have died. Perhaps the most famous of these tragic trips was the Nagua Tragedy, named so because the yola heading to Puerto Rico that time sunk while trying to make its way out of a beach in [[Nagua]]. More than one hundred died, including the boat's captain and the trip planner.\n\nIn November 2008, a group of 33 illegal Dominican migrants who were en route to Puerto Rico were forced to resort to cannibalism after they were lost at sea for over 15 days before being rescued by a [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] patrol boat.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27531105 Dominican migrant: We ate flesh to survive - A small group turned to cannibalism after being stranded in mid-ocean], NBC News, November 4, 2008</ref>\n\nNot all illegal trips to Puerto Rico from the Dominican Republic end in tragedy. These trips are massively scheduled by traffickers, who sometimes travel up to three times each week from Puerto Rico to illegally bring Dominicans. But, because of the large amount of lives that have been lost in many of these trips, both the governments of [[Government of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]] and the Dominican Republic have launched [[mass media]] campaigns to try to reduce them. In the Dominican Republic, videos of dead bodies on the water are shown on television to try to deter people from travelling to Puerto Rico on ''yolas''. The traffickers face long periods in jail if caught, whereas the travelers are deported to the Dominican Republic, where they do not face criminal charges.\n\nIn 2009 an order was given by Governor [[Luis Fortu\u00f1o]] to shut off essential services, such as water and electricity, to Villas del Sol, a [[shantytown]] within the municipality of [[Toa Baja, Puerto Rico|Toa Baja]]. The shantytown consisted mainly of homes built illegally on flood-prone government-owned land. The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] bought these homes from the Puerto Rican Government in order to keep them from being used further. In January 2010 the island government began demolishing some of the homes whose residents are both U.S. citizens and undocumented aliens, mainly of Dominican origin.\n\n==Current circumstances==\nDominicans in Puerto Rico are largely disadvantaged [[Politics of Puerto Rico|politically]], in great part because so many are not citizens. They are also disadvantaged economically, and possess on average much lower [[Education in Puerto Rico|levels of education]] than the mainstream of Puerto Ricans on the island. That is in contrast to their situation in the 1970s, when a demographic study considered Dominican immigrants to be \"privileged\" and an \"elite,\" as a large percentage of Dominican immigrants were professionals and managers. Their present characteristics have made them easy victims for ethnic discrimination, which include accusations of excessive use of government programs. They are often targets of prejudice and [[racism]] as well. In response, dozens of organizations have sprouted to increase the group's political participation, although these efforts' full effectiveness is hampered by inadequate coordination.\n\nThe group is not ignored by Dominican politicians, however. The main [[List of political parties in the Dominican Republic|Dominican parties]] campaign in Puerto Rico during presidential elections and raise important amounts of funds from the Dominican residents. Dominicans in Puerto Rico send millions of dollars per month to their relatives in the Dominican Republic, and are thus also important as a source of foreign currency for the D.R.\n\nThe 2010 census estimated a population of 68,036 Dominicans in Puerto Rico,<ref name=ACS>{{cite web |url =http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_11_3YR_S0201PR&prodType=table|archive-url =https://archive.today/20200212213559/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_11_3YR_S0201PR&prodType=table|url-status =dead|archive-date =2020-02-12|title= SELECTED POPULATION PROFILE IN PUERTO RICO 2009-2011 American Community Survey 3-Year Estimates |accessdate=2011-11-09 |work=Data Set: 2010 U.S. Census |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}</ref> equal to 1.8% of the Commonwealth's population. Majority of Dominicans in Puerto Rico live in the San Juan area, chiefly the cities of San Juan, Bayam\u00f3n, and Carolina.
