{"title_page": "2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}\n[[File:Pedro Alvares Cabral.jpg|thumb|Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]]\nThe '''Second [[Portuguese India Armadas|Portuguese India Armada]]''' was assembled in 1500 on the order of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and placed under the command of [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]].  Cabral's armada famously discovered [[Brazil]] for the Portuguese crown along the way. By and large, the Second Armada's diplomatic mission to [[India]] failed, and provoked the opening of hostilities between the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the feudal city-state of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]].  Nonetheless, it managed to establish a factory in the nearby [[Kingdom of Cochin]], the first Portuguese [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Asia.\n\n== Fleet ==\n\nThe [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first India Armada]], commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]], arrived in Portugal in the summer of 1499, in rather sorry shape. Half of his ships and men had been lost thanks to battles, disease, and storms. Although Gama came back with a hefty cargo of spices that would be sold at enormous profit, he had failed in the principal objective of his mission: to negotiate a treaty with [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], the spice entrep\u00f4t on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India. Gama managed, however, to open the sea route to India via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and secured good relations with the African city-state of [[Malindi]], a critical staging post along the way.\n\nOn King Manuel I's orders, arrangements were immediately made to begin the assembly of a second armada in [[Cascais]].  Determined not to repeat Gama's mistakes, this one was to be a large and well-armed fleet of 13 ships and 1500 men, laden with valuable gifts and diplomatic letters to win over the potentates of the east.\n\nMany details of the composition of the fleet are missing. Only three ship names are known, and there is some conflict among the sources on the captains.  The following list of ships should not be regarded as authoritative, but as a tentative list compiled from various conflicting accounts.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=5\n|style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Ship Name''' ||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Captain'''||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''Notes'''\n|- valign = top\n| 1. uncertain || D.

Oddly, Couto inserts [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in place of Sim\u00e3o de Pina, but subsequently corrects himself.

Cabral had no notable naval or military experience; his appointment as ''capit\u00e3o-mor'' (captain-major) was largely politically motivated.  The exiled [[Crown of Castile|Castillian]] nobleman [[Sancho de Tovar]] was designated vice-admiral (''soto-capit\u00e3o'') and Cabral's successor should anything happen to him.<ref group=note>This is according to Castanheda and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is. Gaspar Correia identifies Sim\u00e3o de Miranda as the predesignated successor instead.</ref>\n\nVeteran pilot [[Pedro Escobar]] was given the overall technical command of the expedition. Other veterans of the first armada included captain Nicolau Coelho, pilot [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]], and clerks Afonso Lopes and [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]].  The famed navigator Bartolomeu Dias, who was the first to double the Cape of Good Hope, and his brother Diogo Dias, who had served as clerk on Gama's ship, also served as captains. \n\nMost of the ships were either [[carracks]] (''naus'') or [[caravels]], and at least one was a small supply ship, although details on names and tonnage are missing.<ref group=note>Castanheda (1551) claims there were ten carracks and three caravels. The Anonymous Pilot refers to only twelve ships, plus a supply ship.</ref>  At least two ships, Cabral's flagship and Tovar's ''El Rei'', were said to be around 240 tons, that is, about twice the size of the largest ship in the first armada three years prior.\n\nTen ships were destined for [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (Malabar, India), while the two ships headed by the Dias brothers were destined for [[Sofala]] in East Africa and the supply ship was destined to be scuttled and burnt along the way.<ref group=note>The Sofala destination of the Dias brothers is found in Castanheda (1551). It is confirmed in the Anonymous Pilot.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro das Armadas).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\n\nAt least two ships were privately owned and outfitted: Lu\u00eds Pires's ship was owned by Diogo da Silva e Meneses, [[Count of Portalegre]], while Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha's ''Anunciada'' was owned by the king's cousin D. [[\u00c1lvaro of Braganza]], and financed by an Italian consortium composed of the Florentine bankers [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] and [[Girolamo Sernigi]] and the Genoese Antonio Salvago. The remainder belonged to the Portuguese crown.\n\nAccompanying the expedition as translator was [[Gaspar da Gama]], who was a Jew captured in Angediva by Vasco Gama, as well as four Hindu hostages from Calicut taken by Gama in 1498 during negotiations. Also aboard was the ambassador of the Sultan of Malindi, who had arrived at Portugal with Gama, and was set to return to Malindi with Cabral's expedition.\n\nOther passengers on the expedition included Aires Correia, the designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut, his secretary P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha, Afonso Furtado, the designated factor for Sofala, and clerk Martinho Neto.  Accompanying them on the trip was the royal physician and amateur astronomer, Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], who brought along the latest astrolabe and new Arabic astronomical staves for navigational experiments.  One chronicler suggests that the knight [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] was also aboard.<ref group=note>[[Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is]] is the chronicler responsible for this claim.  This is not substantiated elsewhere.  Greenlee (1938, p. li) and Diffie and Winius (1977, p. 188fn) dismiss the possibility.</ref>\n\nThe fleet carried some twenty Portuguese ''[[degredado|degredados]]'', who were criminal convicts who could fulfill their sentences by being abandoned along the shores of various places and exploring inland on the crown's behalf. Four of the degredados are known: Afonso Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Machado, Luiz de Moura, and Antonio Fernandes, who was also a ship carpenter. \n\nFinally, the fleet carried eight [[Franciscan]] friars and eight chaplains, under the supervision of the head chaplain, Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra. They were the first Portuguese Christian missionaries to India.\n\nThere are three surviving eyewitness accounts of this expedition: (1) an extended letter written by P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha (possibly dictated by Aires Correia), written from Brazil on May 1, 1500, to King Manuel I; (2) the brief letter by Mestre [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]] to the king, also from Brazil; and (3) the account of an anonymous Portuguese pilot, first published in Italian in 1507 (commonly referred to as the ''Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Piloto An\u00f4nimo'', sometimes believed to be the clerk [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]]).\n\n== Mission ==\n\nThe priority of the mission was to secure a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode), the principal commercial entrep\u00f4t of the [[Kerala]] spice trade and dominant feudal city-state on the [[Malabar coast]] of [[India]]. [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first armada had visited Calicut in 1498, but had failed to impress the elderly ruling Manivikraman Raja ('Samoothiri Raja'), the [[Zamorin of Calicut]]. As such, no agreements had been signed. Cabral's instructions were to succeed where Gama had failed, and to this end was entrusted with magnificent gifts to present to the Zamorin. Cabral was under orders to establish a ''feitoria'' ([[Factory (trading post)|factory]]) in Calicut, which would be placed under Aires Correia.\n\nThe second priority, assigned to Bartolomeu and Diogo Dias, was to search out the East African port of [[Sofala]], near the mouth of the [[Zambezi]] river.<ref>Anonymous Pilot, p. 107</ref> Sofala had been secretly visited and described by the explorer [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]] during his overland expedition a decade earlier (c. 1487), and he identified it as the endpoint of the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade.  The Portuguese crown was eager to tap into that gold source, but Gama's armada had failed to find it.  The Dias brothers were instructed to find and establish a factory at Sofala under designated factor Afonso Furtado.  To this end, the brothers were likely also instructed to secure the consent of [[Kilwa Sultanate|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city-state of the East African coast and putative overlord of Sofala.  \n\nA minor objective included the delivery of a group of [[Franciscan]] missionaries to India. It is said that Vasco da Gama had misinterpreted the [[Hinduism]] he saw practiced in India as a form of \"primitive\" Christianity.  He believed its peculiar characteristics were a result of centuries of separation from the mainstream church in Europe. As such, Gama recommended that missionaries be sent to India to help bring the practices of the \"Hindu church\" up to date with Roman Catholic orthodoxy.  To this end, a group of Franciscan friars, led by Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra, joined the expedition.\n\nAs a final objective, the Second Armada was also a commercial spice run. The crown and private merchants who had outfitted the ships expected full cargoes of spices to return to Lisbon. \n\n=== Suspected Brazilian mission ===\n\nThere has been some debate over whether Cabral also had secret instructions from the king to lay claim to the landmass of Brazil\u2014or, more precisely, to swing as far west as possible to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]] and claim whatever lands or islands might be discovered there for the Portuguese crown, before the Spanish did.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peres |first=Dami\u00e3o |date=1949 |title=O descobrimento do Brasil por Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral: antecedentes e intencionalidade |language=Portuguese}}</ref> Among the pieces of evidence is an indication of an island in the area in a 1448 map of [[Andrea Bianco]], apparently alluded to in the letter of Master Jo\u00e3o Faras; there is also the suggestion by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in his ''Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis'' that he had been sent on an expedition to a western landmass in 1498.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pacheco Pereira |first=Duarte |date=c. 1505 |title=Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis |url=https://archive.org/details/esmeraldodesitu00peregoog/page/n62/mode/2up |chapter=Cap 2: Da cantidade & grandeza da terra, & daugua qual destas he a mayor parte. |language=Portuguese}}</ref> That is about the full extent of the evidence of intentionality and this claim is largely speculative.<ref>{{cite book|last=Greenlee |first=William Brooks |date=1938 |pages=l\u2013lv |title=The Voyage of Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral to Brazil and India: from contemporary documents and narratives |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1409414485}}</ref> There are various reasons to presume the existence of such instructions unlikely.\n\nSpanish explorers had certainly been tending south at that time. Christopher Columbus]had touched the coast of the South American mainland around [[Guyana]] in 1498 on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third trip]]. In late 1499, [[Alonso de Ojeda]] had discovered much of the [[Venezuela|Venezuelan]] coast and in early 1500, [[Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n]] and [[Diego de Lepe]], via generous southerly swings from the [[Canary islands]], had reached at least what is now [[Cear\u00e1]], and perhaps went as far east as [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape of Santo Agostinho]] in [[Pernambuco]]. They had explored much of the northern Brazilian coast west of it. It is possible that the southerly Spanish tendencies were deliberate, aimed at securing more land for the Spanish crown.<ref group=note>Although the person from whom the Spanish crown was trying to claim land was not the king of Portugal, as that was already mediated by Tordesillas, but Christopher Columbus, their own vice-roy of the Indies. Ojeda, Pinz\u00f3n, and Lepe were all dispatched on separate royal capitulations by [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], an enemy of Columbus, with the deliberate intent of finding and claiming lands ''outside'' (i.e., to the south) of the Columbus-owned West Indian islands, thereby circumscribing Columbus's viceroyalty and limiting him to the islands he already had. This would figure in later lawsuits by the Columbus family.</ref>\n\nThese expeditions, however, were too recent for their results to have been known in Lisbon before Cabral's departure in March 1500; indeed, they were unknown in Spain itself. It is very doubtful that the Portuguese were aware of them. Even if they were, it would not seem sensible for Cabral's Second Armada to be instructed to deviate from its original mission in India to pursue exploratory work which be far more efficiently accomplished by smaller caravels. \n\n== Outward journey ==\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu).jpg|thumb|350px|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'']]\nOn March 9, Cabral's expedition set out from the [[Tagus]]. Thirteen days later, on March 22, Cabral's armada reached the island of [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]] in the middle of a storm.  The privately outfitted ship of Lu\u00eds Pires was too damaged by the tempest to continue, and returned to Lisbon<ref>According to Barros (1552, II.5.2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA386#v=onepage&q&f=false p.386]); also Castanheda (1551), G\u00f3is (1566).</ref><ref group=note>Caminha's eyewitness account made no mention of Pires and instead reported that it was the Vasco de Ataide's crown ship that was lost around Cape Verde.</ref>\n\nFrom Cape Verde, Cabral went southwest. It is unknown why he chose such an unusual direction, but the most probable hypothesis is that he was simply following the wide arc in the South Atlantic to catch a favorable wind to carry them to the Cape of Good Hope. Navigationally, the arc is sensible. From Cape Verde, the ship would cut across the [[doldrums]] below the equator, catch the southwest-bound [[South Equatorial Current|equatorial drift]], and turn into the southbound [[Brazil Current]] that will carry them down to the [[horse latitudes]] (30\u00b0S), where the prevailing [[westerlies]] begin.  The westerlies would easily carry the ships across the South Atlantic around the Cape of Good Hope. If instead of this arc, Cabral attempted to strike southeast from Cape Verde, it would go into the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. To reach the Cape from there would be a struggle, as Cabral would have had to sail against the southeasterly [[trade wind|trade winds]], as well as the [[Benguela Current]]. \n\nHow Cabral knew of this arc is unknown. Most likely, this was precisely the route followed by Gama on his first trip in 1497. The veterans of the first fleet\u2014notably the pilots Alenquer and Escobar\u2014would very likely have charted the same route for Cabral again.<ref group=note>That this arc was sailed by Gama in 1497 is uncertain, but most modern historians have come to accept that he did. How did Gama know about the arc when no one had yet sailed it before? Some have speculated that the Portuguese crown might have dispatched secret exploratory expeditions to those waters in advance. The more widely accepted hypothesis, first forwarded by admiral [[Gago Coutinho]], is more straightforward: Since Bartolomeu Dias's 1488 expedition discovered the westerlies, the South Atlantic arc became \"navigationally obvious\" to any sensible pilot, especially pilots as experienced as Alenquer and Escobar. See Gago Coutinho (1951\u201352) ''A Nautica dos Descobrimentos: os descobrimentos maritimos visitos por um navegador'', 2 vols., Lisbon: Agencia Geral do Ultramar.</ref> Indeed, in the Lisbon archives, there is a draft of a document intended for Cabral that instructs him to strike in a southwesterly direction when he reaches the doldrums.<ref>After Cape Verde, where the wind is weak ('vento escasso') the ships should strike in the open ocean arc ('ir na volta do mar'), until the Cape of Good Hope, as this is the shorter route ('a navega\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 mais breve'). See Fonseca (1908, p. 211; see also p.224) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false copy of letter]; see also Greenlee (1938, p. 167)</ref> \n\nAlternative hypotheses forwarded for Cabral striking southwest are that he was trying to reach the [[Azores]] to repair his storm-battered fleet, that he was searching for and rounding up missing tempest-tossed ships, or that it was an intentional attempt to discover if there was any land by the Tordesillas line.\n\n=== Discovery of Brazil ===\n\nCabral took the same path as Gama had, but made a slightly wider arc and went further west than Gama had. As a result, he hit upon the hitherto unknown landmass of Brazil. After nearly 30 days of sailing (44 since departure), on April 21, Cabral's fleet found the first indications of nearby land.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fonseca |first=Faustino da |date=1908 |page=225 |title=A Descoberta to Brasil |language=Portuguese |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Livraria Central de Gomes de Carvalho |place=Lisbon}}</ref> The next day, the armada caught sight of the Brazilian coast, seeing the outlines of a hill they named [[Monte Pascoal]].\n\nThe armada anchored at the mouth of the [[Do Frade River|Frade river]] the next day, and a group of local [[Tupiniquim]] Indians assembled on the beach. Cabral dispatched a small party, headed by Nicolau Coelho, in a longboat ashore to make first contact. Coelho tossed his hat in exchange for a feathered headdress, but the surf was too strong for a proper landing and opening of communication, so they returned to the ships.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fonseca |first=Faustino da |date=1908 |pages=241\u2013242 |title=A Descoberta to Brasil |language=Portuguese |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Livraria Central de Gomes de Carvalho |place=Lisbon}}</ref>\n\nStrong overnight winds prompted the armada to lift anchor and sail some 10 leagues (45&nbsp;km) north, finding harbor behind the reef at Cabr\u00e1lia Bay, just north of [[Porto Seguro]].  The pilot Afonso Lopes, while [[Sounding line|sounding]] in a rowboat, spotted a native canoe, captured the two Indians on board, and brought them back to ship. The language barrier prevented questioning, but they were fed and given cloth and beads. The cultural difference was apparent: The natives spat out their honey and cake and were deeply surprised upon seeing a chicken.<ref>Guia politicamente incorreto da Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil, Leandro Narloch</ref>\n\nThe next day, on April 25, a party led by Coelho and Bartolomeu Dias went ashore, accompanied by the two natives. Armed Tupiniquim warily approached the beach, but upon a signal from the two natives, set down their bows, and allowed the Portuguese to land and collect water.\n\n[[File:Meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The First Mass in Brazil'' by [[Victor Meirelles]] (1861)]]\n\nOn April 26, the Octave of Easter Sunday, the Franciscan friar Henrique Soares of Coimbra went ashore to celebrate mass in front of 200 Tupiniquim Indians.  This is the first known Christian mass on the American mainland.\n\nInteraction between the Portuguese and the Tupiniquim gradually increased throughout the week.  European iron nails, cloth, beads, and crucifixes were traded for American amulets, spears, parrots, and monkeys. There was only the slightest hint that precious metals might be found in the hinterlands. Portuguese ''degredados'' are assigned to spend the night in Tupiniquim villages, while the rest of the crew sleeps aboard ships.\n\n[[File:Carta-caminha.png|thumb|150px|Facsimile of P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha's letter to the king, reporting the discovery of the \"Island of the True Cross\" (Brazil)]]\n\nOn May 1, Cabral makes preparations to resume the journey to India. The Portuguese pilots, assisted by the physician-astronomer Master Jo\u00e3o Faras, determined that Brazil lay east of the Tordesillas line, prompting Cabral to formally claim it for the Portuguese crown, bestowing upon it the name of ''Ilha de Vera Cruz'' (\"Island  of the True Cross\"). It was later renamed ''Terra de Santa Cruz''\u2014\"Land of the Holy Cross\"\u2014upon the realization that it was not an island).<ref group=note>Gaspar Correia ([https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3ALCCN05022145&as_brr=1&pg=PA152#v=onepage&q&f=false p.152]) and Jo\u00e3o de Barros ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA391#v=onepage&q&f=false p.391]) say it was named \"Santa Cruz\" from the start, with Correia saying it was named so because the departure date was the [[Feast of the Cross]] on the liturgical calendar. However, both Caminha's and Mestre Jo\u00e3o's letters are signed as written from \"Vera Cruz\" on May 1.</ref>\n\nOn May 2, Cabral dispatched the supply ship back to [[Lisbon]], with the Brazilian items and a letter to King Manuel I composed by the secretary P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha to announce the discovery.<ref>Anonymous Pilot [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCsOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false p.110]</ref> It also carried a separate private letter to the king from Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], in which he identified the main guiding constellation in the southern hemisphere, the [[Southern Cross]] (''Cruzeiro'').<ref>Some sources claim that the ''Cruzeiro'' constellation had already been identified by [[Alvise Cadamosto]] in the 1450s.</ref> The supply ship arrived in Lisbon in June.\n\nAfter that, with a couple of Portuguese ''degredados'' left beind with the Tupiniquim of Porto Seguro,<ref>Anonymous Pilot [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCsOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false p.110]</ref> Cabral ordered the eleven remaining ships to set sail and continue on their route to India.\n\n=== Crossing to India ===\n\nAfter crossing the Atlantic Ocean, Cabral's armada reached the Cape of Good Hope in late May.  The fleet faced headlong winds for six straight days and four ship\u2014Bartolomeu Dias's, Aires Gomes da Silva's, Sim\u00e3o de Pina's, and Vasco de Ata\u00edde's\u2014are lost at sea in the process.<ref>Castanheda (1551)</ref><ref>Barros (1552)</ref><ref>G\u00f3is (1566)</ref><ref group=note>The ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'' mistakenly substitutes Sim\u00e3o de Miranda for Sim\u00e3o da Pina in the losses, although this is corrected in the marginal gloss. Gaspar Correia (1550) almost concurs\u2014but as he does not have Aires Gomes da Silva on his original captain list, he identifies the fourth ship lost as Gaspar de Lemos. Similarly, the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which has neither Pina nor Gomes da Silva on its list, say it was Diogo de Figueir\u00f3 and Luis Pires who were lost.  Diogo do Couto (c.1600) mistakenly adds P\u00earo d'Ataide to the list, bringing the losses to five. Some scholars also contend that Pires was lost at this point, and Vasco de Ata\u00edde had been lost earlier at Cape Verde.</ref> In this way, the fleet was reduced to seven ships. Facing strong winds, the armada split into smaller groups to meet again on the other side. Cabral's ship went with two others.\n\nOn June 16, 1500, Cabral's three-ship squadron reached the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago|Primeiras Islands]] several leagues north of Sofala.  Two local merchant ships, catching sight of Cabral, took flight. Cabral gave pursuit\u2014one of them runs aground and the other is captured. Upon questioning, it was discovered that these ships were owned by a cousin of the sultan Fateima of Malindi (who had received Vasco da Gama in 1498), so they were released. \n\nThe three ships landed on [[Mozambique Island]] on June 22. Despite the earlier quarrel with his ships, Cabral was given a warm reception by the Sultan of Mozambique and was allowed to collect water and supplies.  Shortly after, three more ships of the Second Armada sailed into the island and joined with Cabral.  Only the ship of Diogo Dias remained missing.  As Dias's mission was for Sofala anyway, Cabral decided not to wait for it and instead pressed on with his fleet of six ships.\n\n[[File:Map of Cabral route, 1500.gif|thumb|340px|Approximate route of outward journey of Cabral's 2nd Armada (also route of stray ship of Diogo Dias)]]\n\nMore than a month later, on July 26, Cabral's armada reached [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], the dominant city-state of the East African coast and which Gama had never visited. Afonso Furtado, who had been appointed factor for Sofala in Lisbon and had escaped death (Furtado had been aboard Bartolomeu Dias's ship, but moved to the flagship just before the Cape crossing), went ashore to open negotiations with the strongman ruler, Emir Ibrahim.<ref group=note>At the time, there was no ruling [[Kilwa Sultanate|Sultan of Kilwa]] as the previous one, al-Fudail, had been deposed in a coup (c. 1495) by his minister, Emir Ibrahim, who had since ruled Kilwa with a vacant throne.</ref>\n\nA meeting was arranged between Cabral and Ibrahim, conducted on a couple of rowboats in the harbor. Cabral presents a letter from King Manuel I proposing a treaty, but Ibrahim was suspicious and remained resistant to the overtures. Cabral, sensing Ibrahim's resistance and worrying that they might miss the monsoon winds to India, broke off the negotiations and sailed on.\n\nPressing north, the Cabral fleet avoided the hostile [[Mombassa]] (''Momba\u00e7a'') and finally reached friendly Malindi (''Melinde'') on August 2.  There, he was well-received by the Sultan of Malindi and dropped off the Malindi ambassador that Gama had taken the previous year.  Leaving behind  two ''degredados'', Lu\u00eds de Moura and Jo\u00e3o Machado, and picking up two Gujarati pilots, Cabral's six-ship armada finally began its Indian Ocean crossing on August 7, 1500.\n\n== Cabral in India ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\nAugust 22, 1500 \u2013 After an uneventful ocean crossing, Cabral's six ships land in [[Anjediva Island]] (''Angediva'', Anjadip), where they rest and recuperate, repair and repaint the ships.\n\nSeptember 13, 1500 \u2013 Sailing down the Indian coast, Cabral's expedition finally reaches at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode, the capital of the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] kingdom of same name ruled by Zamorins, or Nediyuiruppu Swarupam). Gaily decorated native boats come out to greet them, but remembering Gama's experience, Cabral refuses to go ashore until hostages are exchanged.  He dispatches Afonso Furtado and the four Calicut hostages taken by Gama the previous year, to negotiate the details of the landing. This eventually done, Cabral finally goes ashore himself and meets new [[Zamorin]] of Calicut (the wary old Zamorin that Gama had met, had recently died). The Portuguese are better-prepared this time\u2014Cabral presents the young Zamorin with much finer and more luxurious gifts than Gama had brought, and more respectful and personalized letters of address from King [[Manuel I of Portugal]].\n\nA commercial treaty is successfully negotiated, and the Zamorin gives Cabral a security-of-trade certificate etched on a silver plate. The Portuguese are allowed to establish a ''[[Factory (trading post)|feitoria]]'' in Calicut and Aires Correia, the designated factor for Calicut, goes ashore with some 70 men. Once the factory is set up, Cabral releases the ship hostages as a sign of trust. Correia immediately sets about buying spices in Calicut's markets for the ships to take home.\n\nOctober (?), 1500 \u2013 Not long after, the Zamorin of Calicut dispatches a service request to Cabral's idling fleet. Arab merchants allied with rival city-state of [[Cochin kingdom]] are returning from [[Ceylon]] with a cargo of [[war elephants]] destined for the Sultan of [[Cambay]] (Khambhat, Gujarat).  Claiming it to be illegal contraband (and the Zamorin could probably use the elephants himself), Cabral is asked if he can intercept them.  Cabral sends one of his caravels, brimming with cannon, under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]] (nicknamed 'Inferno'), to capture it.  Hoping for a spectacle, the Zamorin himself comes down to the beachfront to witness the engagement, but leaves in disgust when the Arab ship deftly slips past Ataide.  But Ata\u00edde gives chase and eventually catches up with it near [[Kannur|Cannanore]] and successfully seizes the vessel.  Cabral presents the captured ship, with its nearly intact elephant cargo (one pachyderm was killed in the engagement), to the Zamorin as a gift.\n\n=== Calicut Massacre ===\n\nDecember 1500 \u2013 After two months of operation, factor Aires Correia has only been able to buy enough spices to load two of the ships. He complains to Cabral his suspicions that the [[guild]] of Arab merchants in Calicut have been [[collusion|colluding]] to shut out Portuguese purchasing agents from the city's spice markets which is not unlikely. Arab traders had reportedly used similar collusive tactics to drive out Chinese merchants earlier in the 15th century from various ports on the [[Malabar Coast]]. It would make sense if they tried doing so again\u2014particularly as the Portuguese had arrived trumpeting their hatred of 'the Moors' and demanding trading privileges and preferences, a clear danger to their own trade.\n\nHistorians cite murkier elements to this, in particular, that the Portuguese traders might have been unwitting counters in on-going quarrels between competing older and newer Arab merchant guilds in Calicut and or used as pawns in the personal power struggles among the Zamorin's leading advisors, etc. There were certainly more dimensions to this affair, the full details of which will likely never be clearly known.\n\nCabral presents the complaint to the Zamorin, and requests that he crack down on the Arab merchant guild or enforce Portuguese priority in the spice markets.  But the Zamorin refuses to intervene in the matter\u2014or rather makes only some vague promises, but disdains to get actively involved in the matter, as Cabral demands.\n\nDecember 17, 1500 \u2013 Frustrated by the Zamorin's inaction, Cabral decides to take matters into his own hands.  On the advice of Aires Correia, Cabral orders the seizure of an Arab merchant ship from [[Jeddah]], then loading up with spices in Calicut harbor, claiming that as the Zamorin had promised the Portuguese priority in the spice markets, the cargo is rightfully theirs.  Incensed, the Arab merchants around the quay immediately raise a riot in Calicut and direct mobs to attack the Portuguese factory.  The Portuguese ships, anchored out in the harbor and unable to approach the docks, helplessly watch the unfolding massacre.  After three hours of fighting, some 53 (some say 70) Portuguese are slaughtered by the mobs\u2014including the factor Aires Correia, the secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], and three (some say five) of the Franciscan friars.  Around twenty Portuguese then in the city manage to escape the riot by jumping into the harbor waters and swimming to the ships.  The survivors report to Cabral that the Zamorin's own [[Hindu]] guards were seen either standing aside or actively helping the rioters.\n\nAt least one Portuguese, a man called Gon\u00e7alo Peixoto, survived the massacre, sheltered from the mob by a local merchant (whom the chronicles call \"Coja Bequij\").  In the aftermath, the wares in the Portuguese factory are impounded by the Calicut authorities.\n\n=== War with Calicut ===\n\nDecember 18\u201322, 1500 \u2013 Incensed at the attack on the factory, Cabral waits one day for redress by the Zamorin.  When this is not forthcoming, Cabral takes his revenge. The Portuguese seize around ten Arab merchant ships then in harbor, confiscating their cargoes, killing their crews, and burning their ships.  Then, accusing the Zamorin of sanctioning the riot, Cabral orders a full day [[shore bombardment]] of Calicut, doing immense damage to the unfortified city (estimates of Calicut casualties reach up to 600). Cabral proceeds to also bomb the nearby Zamorin-owned port of Pandarane (Pantalayani Kollam, near present-day [[Koyilandy]]) as well.<ref>The port of ''Pandarane'' has since vanished.  Its location is usually identified as 'Pantalyini Kollam', a port that has since been annexed by the growing city of [[Koyilandy]]; it is also sometimes identified with modern [[Kappad]]. (Dames, 1918: p.85)</ref>\n\nThus opened the war between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Zamorin of Calicut.  The war will drag on for the next decade.  Future [[Portuguese India Armadas]] have to contend with this conflict, it will dictate Portuguese strategy in the Indian Ocean and draw in other participants.  The conflict will also overturn the political order on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India, and shape a different future for [[Kerala]].\n\n=== Alliance with Cochin kingdom ===\n\n[[File:Kerala cities at time of Cabral (1500).gif|thumb|250px|India [[Malabar Coast]] c. 1500]]\nDecember 24, 1500 \u2013 Cabral leaves smoldering Calicut, unsure of what to do next. At the suggestion of [[Gaspar da Gama]] (the Goese Jew who had been accompanying the expedition), Cabral sets sail south along the coast towards [[Cochin kingdom]] (''Cochim'', Kochi or Perumpadappu Swarupam), a small [[Hindu]] [[Nair]] city-state at the outlet of the [[brackish]] [[Vembanad Lake|Vembanad]] lagoon in the Kerala backwaters. Half-in-vassalage and half-at-war with Zamorin's Calicut, Cochin kingdom had long chafed at the dominance of its larger neighbor and was looking for an opportunity to break away.\n\nArriving in Cochin, a Portuguese emissary, accompanied by a [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christian]] picked up in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], are set ashore to make contact with the Trimumpara Raja (Unni Goda Varma), the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] prince of [[Cochin kingdom]].<ref>The exact status of the 'Trimumpara Raja', the ruling prince of Cochin, is a bit unclear.  It seems the formal ruler of Cochin was the king of [[Edapalli]], across the lagoon on the mainland, that the Cochinese peninsula (with capital at [[Perumpadappu (Malappuram district)|Perumpadappu]]) had at some point been detached as an appanage for a son, who, in turn, had detached the northern tip, Cochin proper, for another son.  Moreover, it seems these appanages were not supposed to be permanent fiefs, but rather to serve as temporary 'training' grounds for princely heirs before they moved up in succession order.  In other words, the ruler of Cochin was the second heir of Edapalli.  Upon the death of the ruler of Edapalli, the first heir was supposed to leave the peninsula and take up his duties in Edapalli, and the second heir move from Cochin to Perumpadappu, and assign Cochin to his own successor (the new second heir). It seems the Portuguese arrived at a time when the princely heirs were somewhat at odds with each other\u2014possibly because of some violation in the rules of succession, or simply because the ruler of Cochin was tired of waiting for his turn. It is only  under Portuguese protection that the rulers of Cochin finally became proper kings in their own right.  Thus, the Raja Trimumpara's search for a Portuguese alliance have more to do with his own family quarrels than with the exactions of the Zamorin of Calicut.  See Dames (1918: p.86n).</ref> The Portuguese are greeted warmly\u2014the bombardment of hated Zamorin's Calicut outweighing the earlier matter of the war elephants.  All the cordialities and hostage-swapping quickly fulfilled, Cabral himself goes ashore and negotiates a treaty of alliance between Portugal and Cochin kingdom, directed against Zamorin's Calicut. Cabral promises to make the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin the ruler of kingdom of Calicut, upon the city's capture.\n\nA Portuguese factory is set up in Cochin, with Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa as chief factor (the pre-designated Aires Correia having perished in the Calicut Massacre). A smaller, poorer city, the spice markets of Cochin are not nearly as well supplied as Calicut, but the trade is good enough to begin loading ships.  The stay in Cochin is not without incident\u2014the factory is set ablaze one evening (probably at the instigation of Arab traders in the city), but the Trimumpara Raja will not countenance a repeat of the events of Calicut.  He cracks down on the arsonists, takes the Portuguese under his protection (the factors stay in his palace), and assigns his personal [[Nair]] guards to escort the Portuguese factors in the city's markets and protect the factory against any further incidents.\n\nEarly January 1501 \u2013 While in Cochin, Cabral receives missives from the rulers of [[Kannur|Cannanore]] (''Canonor'', Kannur or Kolathunad, further north, another of Calicut's reluctant rivals) and [[Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam or Venad Swarupam, further south, once a great Syrian Christian merchant city-state, entrepot for cinnamon, ginger and dyewood).  They commend Cabral's actions against Zamorin's Calicut, and invite the Portuguese to trade in their cities instead. Not wishing to offend his gracious Cochinese host, Cabral politely declines the invitations, promising only to visit those cities at some future date.\n\nWhile still at Cochin, Cabral receives yet another invitation, this one from nearby [[Kodungallur Kovilakam|Cranganore kingdom]] (''Cranganor'', Kodungallur). Once a great city on the northern end of the Vembanad lagoon, capital of the [[Chera dynasty]] of [[Sangam period]], Cranganore had since fallen on hard times.  Mother nature delivered Cranganore two severe blows\u2014silting up the channels that connected Cranganore to the waterways, and breaking open a competing sea outlet by Cochin in the 14th century.<ref>Cochin was originally just a village along a long embankment.  Violent overflows of the [[Periyar River]] in 1341 forced the opening of the outlet between the Vembanad lagoon and the Arabian Sea at the juncture where Cochin now sits, separating the long Cochinese peninsula from what is now [[Vypin]] island. See Hunter's ''Imperial Gazetteer'' (1908: p.360).</ref> Cochin's rise had been principally due to the re-routing of commercial traffic away from Cranganore. Nonetheless, the remaining merchants of the dwindling city still maintained their old connections to the Kerala pepper plantations in the interior. Finding the supply in Cochin running low, Cabral takes up the offer to top up their cargo at Cranganore.\n\nThe visit to Cranganore turns out to be an eye-opener for the Portuguese, for among the city's remaining inhabitants are substantial established communities of [[Cochin Jews|Malabari Jews]] and [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christians]].  The encounter with a clearly recognizable Christian community in Kerala confirms to Cabral what the Franciscan friars had already suspected back in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]\u2014namely, that Vasco da Gama's earlier hypothesis about a 'Hindu Church' was mistaken. If real Christians have existed alongside Hindus in India for centuries, then clearly [[Hinduism]] must be a distinct and separate religion, 'heathen idolaters', as the Portuguese friars characterized them, rather than a 'primitive' form of Christianity.  Two Syrian Christian priests from Cranganore apply to Cabral for passage to Europe (one of them, known as Jos\u00e9 de Cranganore or Joseph the Indian (''Josephus Indus''), will provide instrumental intelligence about India to the Portuguese.<ref>Upon arrival in Lisbon, Joseph the Indian spent a couple of years being intensely interviewed by the Portuguese court and the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], relating to them his detailed knowledge of the history and geography of India and points east, expanding Portuguese intelligence dramatically.  It is likely that the detailed depiction of the east Indian coast and the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 is owed in large part to Joseph's information.  Around 1503, Joseph proceeded to Rome to meet [[Pope Alexander VI]] and report on the condition of the Malabari [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christian]] church.  It was on this trip that Joseph dictated his famous narrative on India to an Italian scribe, which was eventually published in 1507 (in Italian) as part of a collection, ''Paesi Novamente Retrovati'', edited by Fracanzio da Montalboddo.  The narrative includes Joseph's own account of Cabral's expedition.  See Vallavanthara (2001).</ref>\n\nJanuary 16, 1501 \u2013 News arrives that the Zamorin of Calicut had assembled and dispatched a fleet of around 80 boats against the Portuguese in Cochin.  Despite the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin's offer of military assistance against the Calicut fleet, Cabral decides to precipitously lift anchor and slip away rather than risk a confrontation.  Cabral's armada leave behind the factor Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa and six assistants in Cochin.  In their hasty departure, the Portuguese inadvertently take along two of the Trimumpara's officers (Idikkela Menon and Parangoda Mennon), who had been serving as noble hostages aboard the vessels.\n\nHeading north, Cabral's armada takes a wide sweep to avoid Calicut, and pays a quick visit to [[Kannur|Cannanore]].  Cabral is warmly received by the [[Kolathiri]] Raja of Cannanore who, eager for a Portuguese alliance, offers to sell the Portuguese spices on credit. Cabral accepts the cargo but pays him nonetheless (not a splendid cargo\u2014only low-quality ginger, as it turns out, but Cabral is appreciative of the gesture.)\n\nHis ships now filled with spices, Cabral decides not to visit [[Quilon]], as he had earlier promised, but to make way back home to Portugal.\n\n== Diogo Dias' misadventures ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nWhile Cabral's main fleet was in India, [[Diogo Dias]], captain of the missing seventh ship of the armada, was going through his own set of adventures.\n\n[[File:Detail of Diogo Dias's ship (Cabral Armada).jpg|thumb|180px|Ship of [[Diogo Dias]], detail from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\nShortly after being separated from the main fleet at the Cape in June 1500, Dias had struck out too far east into the Indian Ocean and sighted the western coast of the island of [[Madagascar]].  Although the island was not unknown (its Arab name, \"island of the Moon\", was already reported by [[Pero de Covilha|Covilh\u00e3]]), Diogo Dias was the first Portuguese captain to have sighted it and is often credited with renaming it the island of ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o'', on account of it being found on [[St. Lawrence]]'s day (August 10, 1500).  However, a proper landing on Madagascar would not be undertaken until 1506 and it would only be extensively explored in 1508.\n\nProbably thinking he was on a South African island, Diogo Dias tried to find the African coast by sailing straight north from Madagascar, hoping to reconnect with Cabral's armada there, or at least to make it to [[Sofala]] (Dias's formal destination).  But to no avail.  He had struck too far east, and was heading along north in open ocean.  Dias sighted the African coast only around [[Mogadishu]] (''Magadoxo''). By this time, Cabral had already crossed the Indian Ocean, and the change in the monsoon winds prevented Dias from undertaking his own crossing. Dias pushed up the coast, unexpectedly going past [[Cape Guardafui]] into the [[Gulf of Aden]], waters as yet unsailed by Portuguese ships.  Dias spent the next few months in the area\u2014trapped by contrary winds, battered by tempests, attacked by Arab pirates, and forced aground on the [[Eritrea]]n coast, in a desperate search for water and food.\n\nDias eventually (in late 1500 and early 1501) managed to procure supplies, repair his ship and catch a favorable wind to take him out of that harrowing trap.  With his remaining six crewmen, Dias set sail back to Portugal, hoping to catch Cabral's armada on the return journey.\n\n== Return journey ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nLate January, 1501 \u2013 Cabral takes aboard an ambassador from Cannanore, and starts his ocean crossing back to East Africa.  On the way, the Portuguese capture a  Gujarati ship, replete with a magnificent cargo.  They steal the cargo, but spare the crew, once they realize they are not Arabs.\n\nFebruary, 1501 \u2013 As Cabral's expedition approaches [[Malindi]], vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]], sailing at the front, runs his spice-laden ship, the ''El Rei'', aground on the Malindi coast.  Irreparable, the great ship is burnt (to recover the iron fittings) and the crews and the cargo reallocated.  Cabral's armada is now reduced to five ships. Cabral authorizes the king of Malindi to recover the cannons from the ''El Rei'' wreck and keep them for himself.\n\nSpring, 1501 \u2013 Cabral's fleet reaches [[Mozambique Island]].  As there is no sign or news from [[Diogo Dias]] awaiting him, Cabral realizes he must take responsibility for the Sofala mission himself.  Cabral orders the private ship ''Anunciada'' of Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha, the fastest in the fleet, to be placed under the command of veteran hand [[Nicolau Coelho]], and dispatched ahead of the rest of the fleet and deliver the results of the voyage to Portugal.  Vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]] (who had lost the ''El-Rei'') is given the chance to make amends by taking command of the caravel ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (hitherto commanded by [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]) and seek out Sofala and to proceed home alone from there.  Ata\u00edde is transferred to the command of Coelho's old nau.\n\nIn the meantime, Cabral lands a ''[[degredado]]'' Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes on the African coast, with letters of instruction for Diogo Dias and any passing Portuguese expeditions, informing them of the dramatic turn of events in India, and warning them to avoid Calicut.\n\n[It is uncertain exactly where Cabral left Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes or where he was ordered to go.  According to Ata\u00edde, Fernandes was ordered to go to Mombassa (odd, as Mombassa was then on hostile terms with the Portuguese); others suggest he was supposed to go to Kilwa (which is where the 3rd Armada of [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]] will find him). Others have speculated that Fernandes was left in Kilwa on the outward leg, and that Cabral's letters were dispatched to him by a local messenger from Mozambique on the return.  Another possibility is that Fernandes was instructed to make his way to Sofala overland, meet Tovar's ship there, and then proceed to explore inland from there to locate [[Monomatapa]] (but then why give him the letters?).  Finally, some conjecture Fernandes is being confused with another degredado, Jo\u00e3o Machado, who had been left in Malindi on the first leg, that he was picked up on the return, and now sent back once again with the letters.]\n\nMarch\u2013April, 1501 \u2013 Matters settled, Cabral takes the remaining three ships\u2014his own flagship, the large nau of Sim\u00e3o de Miranda and Coelho's ship (now under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]])\u2014and sets sail out of Mozambique island.\n\nAta\u00edde gets separated from the other two in the [[Mozambique Channel]] soon after departure. He hurries to S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s ([[Mossel Bay]], South Africa), hoping to find Cabral there waiting for him.  But he is out of luck\u2014Cabral and Miranda had decided to proceed on together towards Lisbon without him.  Not finding any trace of the others, Ata\u00edde decides to make his way home on his own, leaving behind a letter in a boot by a local watering hole giving an account of the expedition (Ataide's note will be found later that year by [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd Armada]]).\n\nIn the meantime, Sancho de Tovar, aboard the ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', finally sights [[Sofala]], the entrepot of Monomatapa gold.  He doesn't go ashore, and instead contents himself with scouting the city from his ship, and then sets sail back home alone.\n\n=== Conference at Bezeguiche ===\n\nJune 2, 1501 \u2013 Following up on the discovery of Brazil the previous year, King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] had assembled a small exploratory expedition of three caravels under an unnamed Portuguese captain, and carrying the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] aboard, to explore and map the coast of Brazil.  The exact identity of the captain is uncertain - some speculate it to be [[Gaspar de Lemos]] or [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]], whichever of the two had commanded the supply vessel that had delivered the news in June 1500; others conjecture Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves went merely as passengers, and that the expedition itself was commanded by [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]].<ref>[[Amerigo Vespucci]] wrote two detailed accounts of this Brazilian mapping expedition - in ''Mundus Novus'' (pub. 1502/03) and as the \"third voyage\" in ''Lettera a Soderini'' (pub.1504/05) - but does not identify the Portuguese captain by name in either.  Chronicler [[Gaspar Correia]], writing a half-century later, identifies the mapping captain as the same captain who steered the returning supply ship - ergo the Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves identification.  Greenlee (1945) suggests the captain was [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]], although this has been dismissed by others (e.g. Roukema, 1963).  More recently, historians have drawn attention to a nautical chart by [[Vesconte de Maggiolo]], which identifies the Brazilian landmass with the label ''Tera de Gonsalvo Coigo Vocatur Santa Cruz'' (translated as \"Land of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] called Santa Cruz\").  [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] is known to have led a later expedition to Brazil (which set out in 1503), but it is commonly estimated that Coelho was still out at sea when Maggiolo composed his chart (c. 1504-05), thereby suggesting Coelho might have also captained the previous 1501 mapping expedition as well. (Morison, 1974, vol. 2, p.281)</ref> Setting out from Lisbon in May 1501, the little Brazilian mapping expedition made a watering stop in early June at ''Bezeguiche'' (as the bay of [[Dakar]] (Senegal) was known to the Portuguese sailors of the time) and stumbles upon  [[Diogo Dias]] cooling his heels there. Dias relates to the Portuguese captain and Vespucci the tales of his misadventures\u2014how he had been separated from Cabral at the Cape, how he had ventured up to the Gulf of Aden, and, finding no trace of Cabral on his return, decided to wait for him in Bezeguiche. Just two days later, the lead ship of the returning India fleet\u2014the ''Anunciada'' under [[Nicolau Coelho]]\u2014sails into Bezeguiche, surprised to find both Dias and the Brazilian mapping expedition there (apparently  Bezeguiche must have been a pre-arranged point of encounter for the Second Armada).\n\nFor the next two weeks, the captains and crews of the different ships exchange tales of their travels and adventures.  It has been since speculated that it was during this time that Amerigo Vespucci came up with his \"[[New World]]\" hypothesis.  After all, Vespucci was quite familiar with the Americas, having participated in [[Alonso de Ojeda|Ojeda]]'s 1499 expedition to the coasts of South America, and it is said he had intense discussions at Bezeguiche with [[Gaspar da Gama]], the Goese Jew aboard Coelho's ship, undoubtedly the person most familiar with the East Indies. Comparing notes, it probably dawned on Vespucci that it was simply impossible to square what he knew of the Americas with what the men of the 2nd Armada knew of Asia.  While still at Bezeguiche, Vespucci wrote a letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463\u20131503)|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], relating his encounter, which he sends back with some Florentine passengers on the ''Anunciada''.<ref>Vespucci's 1501 letter is reproduced in Varnhagen (1865).   An English translation can be found in W.H.Greenlee (1938: p.152ff).</ref>  This was a prelude to an even more famous letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo in 1503, shortly after his return, where he finally asserts that the Brazilian landmass was in fact a continent, that the lands discovered to the west were definitely not part of Asia, but must be an entirely different continent, a \"[[New World]]\".<ref>Vespucci (1503). After leaving Bezeguiche, the mapping expedition would make landfall at [[Cape S\u00e3o Roque]] in August 1501, and proceeded to sail south along the Brazilian coast, possibly as far as the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] coast. They returned to Lisbon before September 1502, perhaps as early as June. A second mapping expedition, this time more certainly under [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], also accompanied by Vespucci (his \"fourth voyage\"), set out for Brazil in April, 1503.</ref>\n\nMid-June, 1501 \u2013 Lemos & Vespucci leave Bezeguiche for Brazil. Shortly after, the pair [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda themselves reach Bezeguiche, where they find Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho awaiting them. Cabral sends Coelho's swift ''Anunciada'' ahead to Lisbon to announce their return, while the remainder rest and wait in Bezeguiche for the remaining two ships.  [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]'s ship (making his way alone from Mossel Bay) and [[Sancho de Tovar]]'s ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (returning from Sofala) arrive in Bezeguiche by the end of June.\n\nJune 23, 1501 \u2013 The ''Anunciada'', commanded by [[Nicolau Coelho]], arrives in Lisbon and anchors in [[Bel\u00e9m]].  (Just as in case of Vasco da Gama's expedition, it turns out Nicolau Coelho is once again the first to deliver the news!)  The merchants of the consortium led by [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] (who own the ''Anunciada'') are delighted.  Letters are immediately fired off throughout Europe announcing the results.\n\nThe news arrives too late for [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd India Armada]], which departed for India in April.  But Nova will collect the necessary information along the way\u2014from the note in Ata\u00edde's shoe in Mossel Bay, and from Cabral's letters in the possession of Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes in Kilwa.\n\nJuly 21, 1501 \u2013 One month after Coelho's arrival, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda, the two larger ships, finally arrive in Lisbon. The other three ships arrive a few days later: Sancho de Tovar and P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde on July 25 and the hapless Diogo Dias, with his empty caravel, on July 27.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bernardelli - Monumento a Cabral.jpg|thumb|180px|Monument to [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in Lisbon, copy of a Brazilian monument by Rodolpho Bernardelli]]\nOn the surface, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral's 2nd Armada had been a failure and the reaction was conspicuously muted.\n\nShip losses were very heavy. Of the thirteen ships sent out, only five returned with cargo (four crown, one private), five were lost at sea, three returned without cargo (Gaspar de Lemos, Lu\u00eds Pires and Diogo Dias).\n\nHuman losses were even more disheartening.  This included all the crews and captains of the four ships lost at the Cape (notably, the celebrated discoverer Bartolomeu Dias).  Another fifty-something Portuguese (including the factor Aires Correia) had been killed in the Calicut massacre.\n\nThen there were the mission failures.  Relative to the instructions given to him in Lisbon, Cabral had failed on nearly every count:\n*1. failed to establish a treaty with the Zamorin of Calicut\u2014indeed, Calicut was now more hostile than ever.\n*2. failed to establish a factory at Calicut (massacred);\n*3. failed to bring the 'Hindu Church' in line (the friars that survived reported the Hindus weren't Christians after all, just 'idolaters');\n*4. failed to make a treaty with Kilwa;\n*5. failed to establish a factory at Sofala (seen from afar by Tovar, but that is all).\n\nOn the other hand, in his defense, Cabral could point to some positive achievements.\n\n*1. opening of friendly relations with Cochin, Canannore and Quilon;\n*2. a factory in Cochin, poorer than Calicut perhaps, but workable;\n*3. discovery of true Christian communities in Cranganore, etc.;\n*4. Sofala was at least discovered and scouted;\n*5. discovery of Brazil, which might serve as a useful staging post for future India runs;\n*6. Diogo Dias's discovery of Madagascar and exploration of the African coast up to Cape Guardafui and the Gulf of Aden was useful information.\n*7. Finally, Cabral did bring back tons of spices, which were off-loaded into the Lisbon warehouses and sold at no small profit for the crown treasury.\n\nHowever, it was the ship and human losses that weighed heavily against Cabral being honored or rewarded. Allegations of 'incompetence' flew easily in the circles that mattered. Although Cabral was initially offered the command of the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th Armada]], scheduled for 1502, it seemed more like a ''pro forma'' gesture than a sincere offer.<ref>Subrahmanyam (1997: p.191)</ref> The crown made it clear that Cabral's command would be limited and supervised \u2013 conditions humiliating enough to force Cabral to withdraw his name.  The 4th Armada would be placed under the command of Vasco da Gama.\n\nAlthough the reaction of Portuguese court opinion in 1501, on Cabral's return, was generally low, it ascended retrospectively.  Cabral's discovery of Brazil, initially received as a minor discovery of little interest, turned out to be much more momentous.  The follow-up Brazilian mapping expeditions of 1501-02 and 1503-04, under the captaincy of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], carrying the Florentine cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], revealed a massive continent - which Vespucci famously labelled a \"[[New World]]\" (''Mundus Novus'').  The plentitude of [[brazilwood]] (''pau-brasil'') discovered by the mapping expeditions on its shores lured the interest of European cloth industry, and led to the 1505 contract granted to [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]] for the commercial exploitation of Brazil. The lucrative brazilwood trade eventually drew competition from French and Spanish interlopers, forcing the Portuguese government to take a more active interest in Cabral's \"[[Name of Brazil|Land of Vera Cruz]]\", finally leading to the establishment of the first Portuguese colonies in [[Colonial Brazil]] in 1532.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Carta de P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]]\n* [[Portuguese India Armadas]]\n* [[Portuguese India]]\n* [[Alternative theory of the European discovery of Brazil]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note |30em}}\n\n== References == \n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n'''Eyewitness Accounts'''\n\n* [Anonymous Pilot] \"Navigationi del Capitano Pedro Alvares Cabral Scrita per un Piloto Portoghese et Tradotta di Lingua Portoghese in Italiana\", first published in Francanzano Montalbado, 1507, editor, ''Paesi novamente retrovati et Novo Mondo da Alberico Vesputio Florentino intitulato'', Vicenza.

Cabral's armada famously discovered [[Brazil]] for the Portuguese crown along the way. By and large, the Second Armada's diplomatic mission to [[India]] failed, and provoked the opening of hostilities between the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the feudal city-state of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]].  Nonetheless, it managed to establish a factory in the nearby [[Kingdom of Cochin]], the first Portuguese [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Asia.\n\n== Fleet ==\n\nThe [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first India Armada]], commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]], arrived in Portugal in the summer of 1499, in rather sorry shape. Half of his ships and men had been lost thanks to battles, disease, and storms. Although Gama came back with a hefty cargo of spices that would be sold at enormous profit, he had failed in the principal objective of his mission: to negotiate a treaty with [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], the spice entrep\u00f4t on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India. Gama managed, however, to open the sea route to India via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and secured good relations with the African city-state of [[Malindi]], a critical staging post along the way.\n\nOn King Manuel I's orders, arrangements were immediately made to begin the assembly of a second armada in [[Cascais]].  Determined not to repeat Gama's mistakes, this one was to be a large and well-armed fleet of 13 ships and 1500 men, laden with valuable gifts and diplomatic letters to win over the potentates of the east.\n\nMany details of the composition of the fleet are missing. Only three ship names are known, and there is some conflict among the sources on the captains.

Cabral had no notable naval or military experience; his appointment as ''capit\u00e3o-mor'' (captain-major) was largely politically motivated.  The exiled [[Crown of Castile|Castillian]] nobleman [[Sancho de Tovar]] was designated vice-admiral (''soto-capit\u00e3o'') and Cabral's successor should anything happen to him.<ref group=note>This is according to Castanheda and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is. Gaspar Correia identifies Sim\u00e3o de Miranda as the predesignated successor instead.</ref>\n\nVeteran pilot [[Pedro Escobar]] was given the overall technical command of the expedition. Other veterans of the first armada included captain Nicolau Coelho, pilot [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]], and clerks Afonso Lopes and [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]].  The famed navigator Bartolomeu Dias, who was the first to double the Cape of Good Hope, and his brother Diogo Dias, who had served as clerk on Gama's ship, also served as captains. \n\nMost of the ships were either [[carracks]] (''naus'') or [[caravels]], and at least one was a small supply ship, although details on names and tonnage are missing.<ref group=note>Castanheda (1551) claims there were ten carracks and three caravels. The Anonymous Pilot refers to only twelve ships, plus a supply ship.</ref>  At least two ships, Cabral's flagship and Tovar's ''El Rei'', were said to be around 240 tons, that is, about twice the size of the largest ship in the first armada three years prior.\n\nTen ships were destined for [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (Malabar, India), while the two ships headed by the Dias brothers were destined for [[Sofala]] in East Africa and the supply ship was destined to be scuttled and burnt along the way.<ref group=note>The Sofala destination of the Dias brothers is found in Castanheda (1551). It is confirmed in the Anonymous Pilot.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro das Armadas).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\n\nAt least two ships were privately owned and outfitted: Lu\u00eds Pires's ship was owned by Diogo da Silva e Meneses, [[Count of Portalegre]], while Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha's ''Anunciada'' was owned by the king's cousin D. [[\u00c1lvaro of Braganza]], and financed by an Italian consortium composed of the Florentine bankers [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] and [[Girolamo Sernigi]] and the Genoese Antonio Salvago. The remainder belonged to the Portuguese crown.\n\nAccompanying the expedition as translator was [[Gaspar da Gama]], who was a Jew captured in Angediva by Vasco Gama, as well as four Hindu hostages from Calicut taken by Gama in 1498 during negotiations. Also aboard was the ambassador of the Sultan of Malindi, who had arrived at Portugal with Gama, and was set to return to Malindi with Cabral's expedition.\n\nOther passengers on the expedition included Aires Correia, the designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut, his secretary P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha, Afonso Furtado, the designated factor for Sofala, and clerk Martinho Neto.  Accompanying them on the trip was the royal physician and amateur astronomer, Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], who brought along the latest astrolabe and new Arabic astronomical staves for navigational experiments.  One chronicler suggests that the knight [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] was also aboard.<ref group=note>[[Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is]] is the chronicler responsible for this claim.  This is not substantiated elsewhere.  Greenlee (1938, p. li) and Diffie and Winius (1977, p. 188fn) dismiss the possibility.</ref>\n\nThe fleet carried some twenty Portuguese ''[[degredado|degredados]]'', who were criminal convicts who could fulfill their sentences by being abandoned along the shores of various places and exploring inland on the crown's behalf. Four of the degredados are known: Afonso Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Machado, Luiz de Moura, and Antonio Fernandes, who was also a ship carpenter. \n\nFinally, the fleet carried eight [[Franciscan]] friars and eight chaplains, under the supervision of the head chaplain, Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra. They were the first Portuguese Christian missionaries to India.\n\nThere are three surviving eyewitness accounts of this expedition: (1) an extended letter written by P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha (possibly dictated by Aires Correia), written from Brazil on May 1, 1500, to King Manuel I; (2) the brief letter by Mestre [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]] to the king, also from Brazil; and (3) the account of an anonymous Portuguese pilot, first published in Italian in 1507 (commonly referred to as the ''Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Piloto An\u00f4nimo'', sometimes believed to be the clerk [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]]).\n\n== Mission ==\n\nThe priority of the mission was to secure a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode), the principal commercial entrep\u00f4t of the [[Kerala]] spice trade and dominant feudal city-state on the [[Malabar coast]] of [[India]]. [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first armada had visited Calicut in 1498, but had failed to impress the elderly ruling Manivikraman Raja ('Samoothiri Raja'), the [[Zamorin of Calicut]]. As such, no agreements had been signed. Cabral's instructions were to succeed where Gama had failed, and to this end was entrusted with magnificent gifts to present to the Zamorin. Cabral was under orders to establish a ''feitoria'' ([[Factory (trading post)|factory]]) in Calicut, which would be placed under Aires Correia.\n\nThe second priority, assigned to Bartolomeu and Diogo Dias, was to search out the East African port of [[Sofala]], near the mouth of the [[Zambezi]] river.<ref>Anonymous Pilot, p. 107</ref> Sofala had been secretly visited and described by the explorer [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]] during his overland expedition a decade earlier (c. 1487), and he identified it as the endpoint of the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade.  The Portuguese crown was eager to tap into that gold source, but Gama's armada had failed to find it.  The Dias brothers were instructed to find and establish a factory at Sofala under designated factor Afonso Furtado.  To this end, the brothers were likely also instructed to secure the consent of [[Kilwa Sultanate|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city-state of the East African coast and putative overlord of Sofala.  \n\nA minor objective included the delivery of a group of [[Franciscan]] missionaries to India. It is said that Vasco da Gama had misinterpreted the [[Hinduism]] he saw practiced in India as a form of \"primitive\" Christianity.  He believed its peculiar characteristics were a result of centuries of separation from the mainstream church in Europe. As such, Gama recommended that missionaries be sent to India to help bring the practices of the \"Hindu church\" up to date with Roman Catholic orthodoxy.  To this end, a group of Franciscan friars, led by Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra, joined the expedition.\n\nAs a final objective, the Second Armada was also a commercial spice run. The crown and private merchants who had outfitted the ships expected full cargoes of spices to return to Lisbon. \n\n=== Suspected Brazilian mission ===\n\nThere has been some debate over whether Cabral also had secret instructions from the king to lay claim to the landmass of Brazil\u2014or, more precisely, to swing as far west as possible to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]] and claim whatever lands or islands might be discovered there for the Portuguese crown, before the Spanish did.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peres |first=Dami\u00e3o |date=1949 |title=O descobrimento do Brasil por Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral: antecedentes e intencionalidade |language=Portuguese}}</ref> Among the pieces of evidence is an indication of an island in the area in a 1448 map of [[Andrea Bianco]], apparently alluded to in the letter of Master Jo\u00e3o Faras; there is also the suggestion by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in his ''Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis'' that he had been sent on an expedition to a western landmass in 1498.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pacheco Pereira |first=Duarte |date=c. 1505 |title=Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis |url=https://archive.org/details/esmeraldodesitu00peregoog/page/n62/mode/2up |chapter=Cap 2: Da cantidade & grandeza da terra, & daugua qual destas he a mayor parte. |language=Portuguese}}</ref> That is about the full extent of the evidence of intentionality and this claim is largely speculative.<ref>{{cite book|last=Greenlee |first=William Brooks |date=1938 |pages=l\u2013lv |title=The Voyage of Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral to Brazil and India: from contemporary documents and narratives |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1409414485}}</ref> There are various reasons to presume the existence of such instructions unlikely.\n\nSpanish explorers had certainly been tending south at that time. Christopher Columbus]had touched the coast of the South American mainland around [[Guyana]] in 1498 on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third trip]]. In late 1499, [[Alonso de Ojeda]] had discovered much of the [[Venezuela|Venezuelan]] coast and in early 1500, [[Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n]] and [[Diego de Lepe]], via generous southerly swings from the [[Canary islands]], had reached at least what is now [[Cear\u00e1]], and perhaps went as far east as [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape of Santo Agostinho]] in [[Pernambuco]]. They had explored much of the northern Brazilian coast west of it. It is possible that the southerly Spanish tendencies were deliberate, aimed at securing more land for the Spanish crown.<ref group=note>Although the person from whom the Spanish crown was trying to claim land was not the king of Portugal, as that was already mediated by Tordesillas, but Christopher Columbus, their own vice-roy of the Indies. Ojeda, Pinz\u00f3n, and Lepe were all dispatched on separate royal capitulations by [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], an enemy of Columbus, with the deliberate intent of finding and claiming lands ''outside'' (i.e., to the south) of the Columbus-owned West Indian islands, thereby circumscribing Columbus's viceroyalty and limiting him to the islands he already had. This would figure in later lawsuits by the Columbus family.</ref>\n\nThese expeditions, however, were too recent for their results to have been known in Lisbon before Cabral's departure in March 1500; indeed, they were unknown in Spain itself. It is very doubtful that the Portuguese were aware of them. Even if they were, it would not seem sensible for Cabral's Second Armada to be instructed to deviate from its original mission in India to pursue exploratory work which be far more efficiently accomplished by smaller caravels. \n\n== Outward journey ==\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu).jpg|thumb|350px|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'']]\nOn March 9, Cabral's expedition set out from the [[Tagus]]. Thirteen days later, on March 22, Cabral's armada reached the island of [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]] in the middle of a storm.  The privately outfitted ship of Lu\u00eds Pires was too damaged by the tempest to continue, and returned to Lisbon<ref>According to Barros (1552, II.5.2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA386#v=onepage&q&f=false p.386]); also Castanheda (1551), G\u00f3is (1566).</ref><ref group=note>Caminha's eyewitness account made no mention of Pires and instead reported that it was the Vasco de Ataide's crown ship that was lost around Cape Verde.</ref>\n\nFrom Cape Verde, Cabral went southwest. It is unknown why he chose such an unusual direction, but the most probable hypothesis is that he was simply following the wide arc in the South Atlantic to catch a favorable wind to carry them to the Cape of Good Hope. Navigationally, the arc is sensible. From Cape Verde, the ship would cut across the [[doldrums]] below the equator, catch the southwest-bound [[South Equatorial Current|equatorial drift]], and turn into the southbound [[Brazil Current]] that will carry them down to the [[horse latitudes]] (30\u00b0S), where the prevailing [[westerlies]] begin.  The westerlies would easily carry the ships across the South Atlantic around the Cape of Good Hope. If instead of this arc, Cabral attempted to strike southeast from Cape Verde, it would go into the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. To reach the Cape from there would be a struggle, as Cabral would have had to sail against the southeasterly [[trade wind|trade winds]], as well as the [[Benguela Current]]. \n\nHow Cabral knew of this arc is unknown. Most likely, this was precisely the route followed by Gama on his first trip in 1497. The veterans of the first fleet\u2014notably the pilots Alenquer and Escobar\u2014would very likely have charted the same route for Cabral again.<ref group=note>That this arc was sailed by Gama in 1497 is uncertain, but most modern historians have come to accept that he did. How did Gama know about the arc when no one had yet sailed it before? Some have speculated that the Portuguese crown might have dispatched secret exploratory expeditions to those waters in advance. The more widely accepted hypothesis, first forwarded by admiral [[Gago Coutinho]], is more straightforward: Since Bartolomeu Dias's 1488 expedition discovered the westerlies, the South Atlantic arc became \"navigationally obvious\" to any sensible pilot, especially pilots as experienced as Alenquer and Escobar. See Gago Coutinho (1951\u201352) ''A Nautica dos Descobrimentos: os descobrimentos maritimos visitos por um navegador'', 2 vols., Lisbon: Agencia Geral do Ultramar.</ref> Indeed, in the Lisbon archives, there is a draft of a document intended for Cabral that instructs him to strike in a southwesterly direction when he reaches the doldrums.<ref>After Cape Verde, where the wind is weak ('vento escasso') the ships should strike in the open ocean arc ('ir na volta do mar'), until the Cape of Good Hope, as this is the shorter route ('a navega\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 mais breve'). See Fonseca (1908, p. 211; see also p.224) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false copy of letter]; see also Greenlee (1938, p. 167)</ref> \n\nAlternative hypotheses forwarded for Cabral striking southwest are that he was trying to reach the [[Azores]] to repair his storm-battered fleet, that he was searching for and rounding up missing tempest-tossed ships, or that it was an intentional attempt to discover if there was any land by the Tordesillas line.\n\n=== Discovery of Brazil ===\n\nCabral took the same path as Gama had, but made a slightly wider arc and went further west than Gama had. As a result, he hit upon the hitherto unknown landmass of Brazil. After nearly 30 days of sailing (44 since departure), on April 21, Cabral's fleet found the first indications of nearby land.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fonseca |first=Faustino da |date=1908 |page=225 |title=A Descoberta to Brasil |language=Portuguese |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Livraria Central de Gomes de Carvalho |place=Lisbon}}</ref> The next day, the armada caught sight of the Brazilian coast, seeing the outlines of a hill they named [[Monte Pascoal]].\n\nThe armada anchored at the mouth of the [[Do Frade River|Frade river]] the next day, and a group of local [[Tupiniquim]] Indians assembled on the beach. Cabral dispatched a small party, headed by Nicolau Coelho, in a longboat ashore to make first contact. Coelho tossed his hat in exchange for a feathered headdress, but the surf was too strong for a proper landing and opening of communication, so they returned to the ships.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fonseca |first=Faustino da |date=1908 |pages=241\u2013242 |title=A Descoberta to Brasil |language=Portuguese |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Livraria Central de Gomes de Carvalho |place=Lisbon}}</ref>\n\nStrong overnight winds prompted the armada to lift anchor and sail some 10 leagues (45&nbsp;km) north, finding harbor behind the reef at Cabr\u00e1lia Bay, just north of [[Porto Seguro]].  The pilot Afonso Lopes, while [[Sounding line|sounding]] in a rowboat, spotted a native canoe, captured the two Indians on board, and brought them back to ship. The language barrier prevented questioning, but they were fed and given cloth and beads. The cultural difference was apparent: The natives spat out their honey and cake and were deeply surprised upon seeing a chicken.<ref>Guia politicamente incorreto da Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil, Leandro Narloch</ref>\n\nThe next day, on April 25, a party led by Coelho and Bartolomeu Dias went ashore, accompanied by the two natives. Armed Tupiniquim warily approached the beach, but upon a signal from the two natives, set down their bows, and allowed the Portuguese to land and collect water.\n\n[[File:Meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The First Mass in Brazil'' by [[Victor Meirelles]] (1861)]]\n\nOn April 26, the Octave of Easter Sunday, the Franciscan friar Henrique Soares of Coimbra went ashore to celebrate mass in front of 200 Tupiniquim Indians.  This is the first known Christian mass on the American mainland.\n\nInteraction between the Portuguese and the Tupiniquim gradually increased throughout the week.  European iron nails, cloth, beads, and crucifixes were traded for American amulets, spears, parrots, and monkeys. There was only the slightest hint that precious metals might be found in the hinterlands. Portuguese ''degredados'' are assigned to spend the night in Tupiniquim villages, while the rest of the crew sleeps aboard ships.\n\n[[File:Carta-caminha.png|thumb|150px|Facsimile of P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha's letter to the king, reporting the discovery of the \"Island of the True Cross\" (Brazil)]]\n\nOn May 1, Cabral makes preparations to resume the journey to India. The Portuguese pilots, assisted by the physician-astronomer Master Jo\u00e3o Faras, determined that Brazil lay east of the Tordesillas line, prompting Cabral to formally claim it for the Portuguese crown, bestowing upon it the name of ''Ilha de Vera Cruz'' (\"Island  of the True Cross\"). It was later renamed ''Terra de Santa Cruz''\u2014\"Land of the Holy Cross\"\u2014upon the realization that it was not an island).<ref group=note>Gaspar Correia ([https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3ALCCN05022145&as_brr=1&pg=PA152#v=onepage&q&f=false p.152]) and Jo\u00e3o de Barros ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA391#v=onepage&q&f=false p.391]) say it was named \"Santa Cruz\" from the start, with Correia saying it was named so because the departure date was the [[Feast of the Cross]] on the liturgical calendar. However, both Caminha's and Mestre Jo\u00e3o's letters are signed as written from \"Vera Cruz\" on May 1.</ref>\n\nOn May 2, Cabral dispatched the supply ship back to [[Lisbon]], with the Brazilian items and a letter to King Manuel I composed by the secretary P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha to announce the discovery.<ref>Anonymous Pilot [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCsOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false p.110]</ref> It also carried a separate private letter to the king from Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], in which he identified the main guiding constellation in the southern hemisphere, the [[Southern Cross]] (''Cruzeiro'').<ref>Some sources claim that the ''Cruzeiro'' constellation had already been identified by [[Alvise Cadamosto]] in the 1450s.</ref> The supply ship arrived in Lisbon in June.\n\nAfter that, with a couple of Portuguese ''degredados'' left beind with the Tupiniquim of Porto Seguro,<ref>Anonymous Pilot [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCsOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false p.110]</ref> Cabral ordered the eleven remaining ships to set sail and continue on their route to India.\n\n=== Crossing to India ===\n\nAfter crossing the Atlantic Ocean, Cabral's armada reached the Cape of Good Hope in late May.  The fleet faced headlong winds for six straight days and four ship\u2014Bartolomeu Dias's, Aires Gomes da Silva's, Sim\u00e3o de Pina's, and Vasco de Ata\u00edde's\u2014are lost at sea in the process.<ref>Castanheda (1551)</ref><ref>Barros (1552)</ref><ref>G\u00f3is (1566)</ref><ref group=note>The ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'' mistakenly substitutes Sim\u00e3o de Miranda for Sim\u00e3o da Pina in the losses, although this is corrected in the marginal gloss. Gaspar Correia (1550) almost concurs\u2014but as he does not have Aires Gomes da Silva on his original captain list, he identifies the fourth ship lost as Gaspar de Lemos. Similarly, the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which has neither Pina nor Gomes da Silva on its list, say it was Diogo de Figueir\u00f3 and Luis Pires who were lost.  Diogo do Couto (c.1600) mistakenly adds P\u00earo d'Ataide to the list, bringing the losses to five. Some scholars also contend that Pires was lost at this point, and Vasco de Ata\u00edde had been lost earlier at Cape Verde.</ref> In this way, the fleet was reduced to seven ships. Facing strong winds, the armada split into smaller groups to meet again on the other side. Cabral's ship went with two others.\n\nOn June 16, 1500, Cabral's three-ship squadron reached the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago|Primeiras Islands]] several leagues north of Sofala.  Two local merchant ships, catching sight of Cabral, took flight. Cabral gave pursuit\u2014one of them runs aground and the other is captured. Upon questioning, it was discovered that these ships were owned by a cousin of the sultan Fateima of Malindi (who had received Vasco da Gama in 1498), so they were released. \n\nThe three ships landed on [[Mozambique Island]] on June 22. Despite the earlier quarrel with his ships, Cabral was given a warm reception by the Sultan of Mozambique and was allowed to collect water and supplies.  Shortly after, three more ships of the Second Armada sailed into the island and joined with Cabral.  Only the ship of Diogo Dias remained missing.  As Dias's mission was for Sofala anyway, Cabral decided not to wait for it and instead pressed on with his fleet of six ships.\n\n[[File:Map of Cabral route, 1500.gif|thumb|340px|Approximate route of outward journey of Cabral's 2nd Armada (also route of stray ship of Diogo Dias)]]\n\nMore than a month later, on July 26, Cabral's armada reached [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], the dominant city-state of the East African coast and which Gama had never visited. Afonso Furtado, who had been appointed factor for Sofala in Lisbon and had escaped death (Furtado had been aboard Bartolomeu Dias's ship, but moved to the flagship just before the Cape crossing), went ashore to open negotiations with the strongman ruler, Emir Ibrahim<ref group=note>At the time, there was no ruling [[Kilwa Sultanate|Sultan of Kilwa]] as the previous one, al-Fudail, had been deposed in a coup (c. 1495) by his minister, Emir Ibrahim, who had since ruled Kilwa with a vacant throne.</ref>\n\nA meeting was arranged between Cabral and Ibrahim, conducted on a couple of rowboats in the harbor. Cabral presents a letter from King Manuel I proposing a treaty, but Ibrahim was suspicious and remained resistant to the overtures. Cabral, sensing Ibrahim's resistance and worrying that they might miss the monsoon winds to India, broke off the negotiations and sailed on.\n\nPressing north, the Cabral fleet avoided the hostile [[Mombassa]] (''Momba\u00e7a'') and finally reached friendly Malindi (''Melinde'') on August 2.  There, he was well-received by the Sultan of Malindi and dropped off the Malindi ambassador that Gama had taken the previous year.  Leaving behind  two ''degredados'', Lu\u00eds de Moura and Jo\u00e3o Machado, and picking up two Gujarati pilots, Cabral's six-ship armada finally began its Indian Ocean crossing on August 7, 1500.\n\n== Cabral in India ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\nAugust 22, 1500 \u2013 After an uneventful ocean crossing, Cabral's six ships land in [[Anjediva Island]] (''Angediva'', Anjadip), where they rest and recuperate, repair and repaint the ships.\n\nSeptember 13, 1500 \u2013 Sailing down the Indian coast, Cabral's expedition finally reaches at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode, the capital of the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] kingdom of same name ruled by Zamorins, or Nediyuiruppu Swarupam). Gaily decorated native boats come out to greet them, but remembering Gama's experience, Cabral refuses to go ashore until hostages are exchanged.  He dispatches Afonso Furtado and the four Calicut hostages taken by Gama the previous year, to negotiate the details of the landing. This eventually done, Cabral finally goes ashore himself and meets new [[Zamorin]] of Calicut (the wary old Zamorin that Gama had met, had recently died). The Portuguese are better-prepared this time\u2014Cabral presents the young Zamorin with much finer and more luxurious gifts than Gama had brought, and more respectful and personalized letters of address from King [[Manuel I of Portugal]].\n\nA commercial treaty is successfully negotiated, and the Zamorin gives Cabral a security-of-trade certificate etched on a silver plate. The Portuguese are allowed to establish a ''[[Factory (trading post)|feitoria]]'' in Calicut and Aires Correia, the designated factor for Calicut, goes ashore with some 70 men. Once the factory is set up, Cabral releases the ship hostages as a sign of trust. Correia immediately sets about buying spices in Calicut's markets for the ships to take home.\n\nOctober (?), 1500 \u2013 Not long after, the Zamorin of Calicut dispatches a service request to Cabral's idling fleet. Arab merchants allied with rival city-state of [[Cochin kingdom]] are returning from [[Ceylon]] with a cargo of [[war elephants]] destined for the Sultan of [[Cambay]] (Khambhat, Gujarat).  Claiming it to be illegal contraband (and the Zamorin could probably use the elephants himself), Cabral is asked if he can intercept them.  Cabral sends one of his caravels, brimming with cannon, under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]] (nicknamed 'Inferno'), to capture it.  Hoping for a spectacle, the Zamorin himself comes down to the beachfront to witness the engagement, but leaves in disgust when the Arab ship deftly slips past Ataide.  But Ata\u00edde gives chase and eventually catches up with it near [[Kannur|Cannanore]] and successfully seizes the vessel.  Cabral presents the captured ship, with its nearly intact elephant cargo (one pachyderm was killed in the engagement), to the Zamorin as a gift.\n\n=== Calicut Massacre ===\n\nDecember 1500 \u2013 After two months of operation, factor Aires Correia has only been able to buy enough spices to load two of the ships. He complains to Cabral his suspicions that the [[guild]] of Arab merchants in Calicut have been [[collusion|colluding]] to shut out Portuguese purchasing agents from the city's spice markets which is not unlikely. Arab traders had reportedly used similar collusive tactics to drive out Chinese merchants earlier in the 15th century from various ports on the [[Malabar Coast]]. It would make sense if they tried doing so again\u2014particularly as the Portuguese had arrived trumpeting their hatred of 'the Moors' and demanding trading privileges and preferences, a clear danger to their own trade.\n\nHistorians cite murkier elements to this, in particular, that the Portuguese traders might have been unwitting counters in on-going quarrels between competing older and newer Arab merchant guilds in Calicut and or used as pawns in the personal power struggles among the Zamorin's leading advisors, etc. There were certainly more dimensions to this affair, the full details of which will likely never be clearly known.\n\nCabral presents the complaint to the Zamorin, and requests that he crack down on the Arab merchant guild or enforce Portuguese priority in the spice markets.  But the Zamorin refuses to intervene in the matter\u2014or rather makes only some vague promises, but disdains to get actively involved in the matter, as Cabral demands.\n\nDecember 17, 1500 \u2013 Frustrated by the Zamorin's inaction, Cabral decides to take matters into his own hands.  On the advice of Aires Correia, Cabral orders the seizure of an Arab merchant ship from [[Jeddah]], then loading up with spices in Calicut harbor, claiming that as the Zamorin had promised the Portuguese priority in the spice markets, the cargo is rightfully theirs.  Incensed, the Arab merchants around the quay immediately raise a riot in Calicut and direct mobs to attack the Portuguese factory.  The Portuguese ships, anchored out in the harbor and unable to approach the docks, helplessly watch the unfolding massacre.  After three hours of fighting, some 53 (some say 70) Portuguese are slaughtered by the mobs\u2014including the factor Aires Correia, the secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], and three (some say five) of the Franciscan friars.  Around twenty Portuguese then in the city manage to escape the riot by jumping into the harbor waters and swimming to the ships.  The survivors report to Cabral that the Zamorin's own [[Hindu]] guards were seen either standing aside or actively helping the rioters.\n\nAt least one Portuguese, a man called Gon\u00e7alo Peixoto, survived the massacre, sheltered from the mob by a local merchant (whom the chronicles call \"Coja Bequij\").  In the aftermath, the wares in the Portuguese factory are impounded by the Calicut authorities.\n\n=== War with Calicut ===\n\nDecember 18\u201322, 1500 \u2013 Incensed at the attack on the factory, Cabral waits one day for redress by the Zamorin.  When this is not forthcoming, Cabral takes his revenge. The Portuguese seize around ten Arab merchant ships then in harbor, confiscating their cargoes, killing their crews, and burning their ships.  Then, accusing the Zamorin of sanctioning the riot, Cabral orders a full day [[shore bombardment]] of Calicut, doing immense damage to the unfortified city (estimates of Calicut casualties reach up to 600). Cabral proceeds to also bomb the nearby Zamorin-owned port of Pandarane (Pantalayani Kollam, near present-day [[Koyilandy]]) as well.<ref>The port of ''Pandarane'' has since vanished.  Its location is usually identified as 'Pantalyini Kollam', a port that has since been annexed by the growing city of [[Koyilandy]]; it is also sometimes identified with modern [[Kappad]]. (Dames, 1918: p.85)</ref>\n\nThus opened the war between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Zamorin of Calicut.  The war will drag on for the next decade.  Future [[Portuguese India Armadas]] have to contend with this conflict, it will dictate Portuguese strategy in the Indian Ocean and draw in other participants.  The conflict will also overturn the political order on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India, and shape a different future for [[Kerala]].\n\n=== Alliance with Cochin kingdom ===\n\n[[File:Kerala cities at time of Cabral (1500).gif|thumb|250px|India [[Malabar Coast]] c. 1500]]\nDecember 24, 1500 \u2013 Cabral leaves smoldering Calicut, unsure of what to do next. At the suggestion of [[Gaspar da Gama]] (the Goese Jew who had been accompanying the expedition), Cabral sets sail south along the coast towards [[Cochin kingdom]] (''Cochim'', Kochi or Perumpadappu Swarupam), a small [[Hindu]] [[Nair]] city-state at the outlet of the [[brackish]] [[Vembanad Lake|Vembanad]] lagoon in the Kerala backwaters. Half-in-vassalage and half-at-war with Zamorin's Calicut, Cochin kingdom had long chafed at the dominance of its larger neighbor and was looking for an opportunity to break away.\n\nArriving in Cochin, a Portuguese emissary, accompanied by a [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christian]] picked up in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], are set ashore to make contact with the Trimumpara Raja (Unni Goda Varma), the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] prince of [[Cochin kingdom]].<ref>The exact status of the 'Trimumpara Raja', the ruling prince of Cochin, is a bit unclear.  It seems the formal ruler of Cochin was the king of [[Edapalli]], across the lagoon on the mainland, that the Cochinese peninsula (with capital at [[Perumpadappu (Malappuram district)|Perumpadappu]]) had at some point been detached as an appanage for a son, who, in turn, had detached the northern tip, Cochin proper, for another son.  Moreover, it seems these appanages were not supposed to be permanent fiefs, but rather to serve as temporary 'training' grounds for princely heirs before they moved up in succession order.  In other words, the ruler of Cochin was the second heir of Edapalli.  Upon the death of the ruler of Edapalli, the first heir was supposed to leave the peninsula and take up his duties in Edapalli, and the second heir move from Cochin to Perumpadappu, and assign Cochin to his own successor (the new second heir). It seems the Portuguese arrived at a time when the princely heirs were somewhat at odds with each other\u2014possibly because of some violation in the rules of succession, or simply because the ruler of Cochin was tired of waiting for his turn. It is only  under Portuguese protection that the rulers of Cochin finally became proper kings in their own right.  Thus, the Raja Trimumpara's search for a Portuguese alliance have more to do with his own family quarrels than with the exactions of the Zamorin of Calicut.  See Dames (1918: p.86n).</ref> The Portuguese are greeted warmly\u2014the bombardment of hated Zamorin's Calicut outweighing the earlier matter of the war elephants.  All the cordialities and hostage-swapping quickly fulfilled, Cabral himself goes ashore and negotiates a treaty of alliance between Portugal and Cochin kingdom, directed against Zamorin's Calicut. Cabral promises to make the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin the ruler of kingdom of Calicut, upon the city's capture.\n\nA Portuguese factory is set up in Cochin, with Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa as chief factor (the pre-designated Aires Correia having perished in the Calicut Massacre). A smaller, poorer city, the spice markets of Cochin are not nearly as well supplied as Calicut, but the trade is good enough to begin loading ships.  The stay in Cochin is not without incident\u2014the factory is set ablaze one evening (probably at the instigation of Arab traders in the city), but the Trimumpara Raja will not countenance a repeat of the events of Calicut.  He cracks down on the arsonists, takes the Portuguese under his protection (the factors stay in his palace), and assigns his personal [[Nair]] guards to escort the Portuguese factors in the city's markets and protect the factory against any further incidents.\n\nEarly January 1501 \u2013 While in Cochin, Cabral receives missives from the rulers of [[Kannur|Cannanore]] (''Canonor'', Kannur or Kolathunad, further north, another of Calicut's reluctant rivals) and [[Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam or Venad Swarupam, further south, once a great Syrian Christian merchant city-state, entrepot for cinnamon, ginger and dyewood).  They commend Cabral's actions against Zamorin's Calicut, and invite the Portuguese to trade in their cities instead. Not wishing to offend his gracious Cochinese host, Cabral politely declines the invitations, promising only to visit those cities at some future date.\n\nWhile still at Cochin, Cabral receives yet another invitation, this one from nearby [[Kodungallur Kovilakam|Cranganore kingdom]] (''Cranganor'', Kodungallur). Once a great city on the northern end of the Vembanad lagoon, capital of the [[Chera dynasty]] of [[Sangam period]], Cranganore had since fallen on hard times.  Mother nature delivered Cranganore two severe blows\u2014silting up the channels that connected Cranganore to the waterways, and breaking open a competing sea outlet by Cochin in the 14th century.<ref>Cochin was originally just a village along a long embankment.  Violent overflows of the [[Periyar River]] in 1341 forced the opening of the outlet between the Vembanad lagoon and the Arabian Sea at the juncture where Cochin now sits, separating the long Cochinese peninsula from what is now [[Vypin]] island. See Hunter's ''Imperial Gazetteer'' (1908: p.360).</ref> Cochin's rise had been principally due to the re-routing of commercial traffic away from Cranganore. Nonetheless, the remaining merchants of the dwindling city still maintained their old connections to the Kerala pepper plantations in the interior. Finding the supply in Cochin running low, Cabral takes up the offer to top up their cargo at Cranganore.\n\nThe visit to Cranganore turns out to be an eye-opener for the Portuguese, for among the city's remaining inhabitants are substantial established communities of [[Cochin Jews|Malabari Jews]] and [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christians]].  The encounter with a clearly recognizable Christian community in Kerala confirms to Cabral what the Franciscan friars had already suspected back in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]\u2014namely, that Vasco da Gama's earlier hypothesis about a 'Hindu Church' was mistaken. If real Christians have existed alongside Hindus in India for centuries, then clearly [[Hinduism]] must be a distinct and separate religion, 'heathen idolaters', as the Portuguese friars characterized them, rather than a 'primitive' form of Christianity.  Two Syrian Christian priests from Cranganore apply to Cabral for passage to Europe (one of them, known as Jos\u00e9 de Cranganore or Joseph the Indian (''Josephus Indus''), will provide instrumental intelligence about India to the Portuguese.<ref>Upon arrival in Lisbon, Joseph the Indian spent a couple of years being intensely interviewed by the Portuguese court and the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], relating to them his detailed knowledge of the history and geography of India and points east, expanding Portuguese intelligence dramatically.  It is likely that the detailed depiction of the east Indian coast and the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 is owed in large part to Joseph's information.  Around 1503, Joseph proceeded to Rome to meet [[Pope Alexander VI]] and report on the condition of the Malabari [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christian]] church.  It was on this trip that Joseph dictated his famous narrative on India to an Italian scribe, which was eventually published in 1507 (in Italian) as part of a collection, ''Paesi Novamente Retrovati'', edited by Fracanzio da Montalboddo.  The narrative includes Joseph's own account of Cabral's expedition.  See Vallavanthara (2001).</ref>\n\nJanuary 16, 1501 \u2013 News arrives that the Zamorin of Calicut had assembled and dispatched a fleet of around 80 boats against the Portuguese in Cochin.  Despite the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin's offer of military assistance against the Calicut fleet, Cabral decides to precipitously lift anchor and slip away rather than risk a confrontation.  Cabral's armada leave behind the factor Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa and six assistants in Cochin.  In their hasty departure, the Portuguese inadvertently take along two of the Trimumpara's officers (Idikkela Menon and Parangoda Mennon), who had been serving as noble hostages aboard the vessels.\n\nHeading north, Cabral's armada takes a wide sweep to avoid Calicut, and pays a quick visit to [[Kannur|Cannanore]].  Cabral is warmly received by the [[Kolathiri]] Raja of Cannanore who, eager for a Portuguese alliance, offers to sell the Portuguese spices on credit. Cabral accepts the cargo but pays him nonetheless (not a splendid cargo\u2014only low-quality ginger, as it turns out, but Cabral is appreciative of the gesture.)\n\nHis ships now filled with spices, Cabral decides not to visit [[Quilon]], as he had earlier promised, but to make way back home to Portugal.\n\n== Diogo Dias' misadventures ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nWhile Cabral's main fleet was in India, [[Diogo Dias]], captain of the missing seventh ship of the armada, was going through his own set of adventures.\n\n[[File:Detail of Diogo Dias's ship (Cabral Armada).jpg|thumb|180px|Ship of [[Diogo Dias]], detail from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\nShortly after being separated from the main fleet at the Cape in June 1500, Dias had struck out too far east into the Indian Ocean and sighted the western coast of the island of [[Madagascar]].  Although the island was not unknown (its Arab name, \"island of the Moon\", was already reported by [[Pero de Covilha|Covilh\u00e3]]), Diogo Dias was the first Portuguese captain to have sighted it and is often credited with renaming it the island of ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o'', on account of it being found on [[St. Lawrence]]'s day (August 10, 1500).  However, a proper landing on Madagascar would not be undertaken until 1506 and it would only be extensively explored in 1508.\n\nProbably thinking he was on a South African island, Diogo Dias tried to find the African coast by sailing straight north from Madagascar, hoping to reconnect with Cabral's armada there, or at least to make it to [[Sofala]] (Dias's formal destination).  But to no avail.  He had struck too far east, and was heading along north in open ocean.  Dias sighted the African coast only around [[Mogadishu]] (''Magadoxo''). By this time, Cabral had already crossed the Indian Ocean, and the change in the monsoon winds prevented Dias from undertaking his own crossing. Dias pushed up the coast, unexpectedly going past [[Cape Guardafui]] into the [[Gulf of Aden]], waters as yet unsailed by Portuguese ships.  Dias spent the next few months in the area\u2014trapped by contrary winds, battered by tempests, attacked by Arab pirates, and forced aground on the [[Eritrea]]n coast, in a desperate search for water and food.\n\nDias eventually (in late 1500 and early 1501) managed to procure supplies, repair his ship and catch a favorable wind to take him out of that harrowing trap.  With his remaining six crewmen, Dias set sail back to Portugal, hoping to catch Cabral's armada on the return journey.\n\n== Return journey ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nLate January, 1501 \u2013 Cabral takes aboard an ambassador from Cannanore, and starts his ocean crossing back to East Africa.  On the way, the Portuguese capture a  Gujarati ship, replete with a magnificent cargo.  They steal the cargo, but spare the crew, once they realize they are not Arabs.\n\nFebruary, 1501 \u2013 As Cabral's expedition approaches [[Malindi]], vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]], sailing at the front, runs his spice-laden ship, the ''El Rei'', aground on the Malindi coast.  Irreparable, the great ship is burnt (to recover the iron fittings) and the crews and the cargo reallocated.  Cabral's armada is now reduced to five ships. Cabral authorizes the king of Malindi to recover the cannons from the ''El Rei'' wreck and keep them for himself.\n\nSpring, 1501 \u2013 Cabral's fleet reaches [[Mozambique Island]].  As there is no sign or news from [[Diogo Dias]] awaiting him, Cabral realizes he must take responsibility for the Sofala mission himself.  Cabral orders the private ship ''Anunciada'' of Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha, the fastest in the fleet, to be placed under the command of veteran hand [[Nicolau Coelho]], and dispatched ahead of the rest of the fleet and deliver the results of the voyage to Portugal.  Vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]] (who had lost the ''El-Rei'') is given the chance to make amends by taking command of the caravel ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (hitherto commanded by [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]) and seek out Sofala and to proceed home alone from there.  Ata\u00edde is transferred to the command of Coelho's old nau.\n\nIn the meantime, Cabral lands a ''[[degredado]]'' Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes on the African coast, with letters of instruction for Diogo Dias and any passing Portuguese expeditions, informing them of the dramatic turn of events in India, and warning them to avoid Calicut.\n\n[It is uncertain exactly where Cabral left Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes or where he was ordered to go.  According to Ata\u00edde, Fernandes was ordered to go to Mombassa (odd, as Mombassa was then on hostile terms with the Portuguese); others suggest he was supposed to go to Kilwa (which is where the 3rd Armada of [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]] will find him). Others have speculated that Fernandes was left in Kilwa on the outward leg, and that Cabral's letters were dispatched to him by a local messenger from Mozambique on the return.  Another possibility is that Fernandes was instructed to make his way to Sofala overland, meet Tovar's ship there, and then proceed to explore inland from there to locate [[Monomatapa]] (but then why give him the letters?).  Finally, some conjecture Fernandes is being confused with another degredado, Jo\u00e3o Machado, who had been left in Malindi on the first leg, that he was picked up on the return, and now sent back once again with the letters.]\n\nMarch\u2013April, 1501 \u2013 Matters settled, Cabral takes the remaining three ships\u2014his own flagship, the large nau of Sim\u00e3o de Miranda and Coelho's ship (now under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]])\u2014and sets sail out of Mozambique island.\n\nAta\u00edde gets separated from the other two in the [[Mozambique Channel]] soon after departure. He hurries to S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s ([[Mossel Bay]], South Africa), hoping to find Cabral there waiting for him.  But he is out of luck\u2014Cabral and Miranda had decided to proceed on together towards Lisbon without him.  Not finding any trace of the others, Ata\u00edde decides to make his way home on his own, leaving behind a letter in a boot by a local watering hole giving an account of the expedition (Ataide's note will be found later that year by [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd Armada]]).\n\nIn the meantime, Sancho de Tovar, aboard the ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', finally sights [[Sofala]], the entrepot of Monomatapa gold.  He doesn't go ashore, and instead contents himself with scouting the city from his ship, and then sets sail back home alone.\n\n=== Conference at Bezeguiche ===\n\nJune 2, 1501 \u2013 Following up on the discovery of Brazil the previous year, King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] had assembled a small exploratory expedition of three caravels under an unnamed Portuguese captain, and carrying the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] aboard, to explore and map the coast of Brazil.  The exact identity of the captain is uncertain - some speculate it to be [[Gaspar de Lemos]] or [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]], whichever of the two had commanded the supply vessel that had delivered the news in June 1500; others conjecture Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves went merely as passengers, and that the expedition itself was commanded by [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]].<ref>[[Amerigo Vespucci]] wrote two detailed accounts of this Brazilian mapping expedition - in ''Mundus Novus'' (pub. 1502/03) and as the \"third voyage\" in ''Lettera a Soderini'' (pub.1504/05) - but does not identify the Portuguese captain by name in either.  Chronicler [[Gaspar Correia]], writing a half-century later, identifies the mapping captain as the same captain who steered the returning supply ship - ergo the Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves identification.  Greenlee (1945) suggests the captain was [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]], although this has been dismissed by others (e.g. Roukema, 1963).  More recently, historians have drawn attention to a nautical chart by [[Vesconte de Maggiolo]], which identifies the Brazilian landmass with the label ''Tera de Gonsalvo Coigo Vocatur Santa Cruz'' (translated as \"Land of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] called Santa Cruz\").  [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] is known to have led a later expedition to Brazil (which set out in 1503), but it is commonly estimated that Coelho was still out at sea when Maggiolo composed his chart (c. 1504-05), thereby suggesting Coelho might have also captained the previous 1501 mapping expedition as well. (Morison, 1974, vol. 2, p.281)</ref> Setting out from Lisbon in May 1501, the little Brazilian mapping expedition made a watering stop in early June at ''Bezeguiche'' (as the bay of [[Dakar]] (Senegal) was known to the Portuguese sailors of the time) and stumbles upon  [[Diogo Dias]] cooling his heels there. Dias relates to the Portuguese captain and Vespucci the tales of his misadventures\u2014how he had been separated from Cabral at the Cape, how he had ventured up to the Gulf of Aden, and, finding no trace of Cabral on his return, decided to wait for him in Bezeguiche. Just two days later, the lead ship of the returning India fleet\u2014the ''Anunciada'' under [[Nicolau Coelho]]\u2014sails into Bezeguiche, surprised to find both Dias and the Brazilian mapping expedition there (apparently  Bezeguiche must have been a pre-arranged point of encounter for the Second Armada).\n\nFor the next two weeks, the captains and crews of the different ships exchange tales of their travels and adventures.  It has been since speculated that it was during this time that Amerigo Vespucci came up with his \"[[New World]]\" hypothesis.  After all, Vespucci was quite familiar with the Americas, having participated in [[Alonso de Ojeda|Ojeda]]'s 1499 expedition to the coasts of South America, and it is said he had intense discussions at Bezeguiche with [[Gaspar da Gama]], the Goese Jew aboard Coelho's ship, undoubtedly the person most familiar with the East Indies. Comparing notes, it probably dawned on Vespucci that it was simply impossible to square what he knew of the Americas with what the men of the 2nd Armada knew of Asia.  While still at Bezeguiche, Vespucci wrote a letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463\u20131503)|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], relating his encounter, which he sends back with some Florentine passengers on the ''Anunciada''.<ref>Vespucci's 1501 letter is reproduced in Varnhagen (1865).   An English translation can be found in W.H.Greenlee (1938: p.152ff).</ref>  This was a prelude to an even more famous letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo in 1503, shortly after his return, where he finally asserts that the Brazilian landmass was in fact a continent, that the lands discovered to the west were definitely not part of Asia, but must be an entirely different continent, a \"[[New World]]\".<ref>Vespucci (1503). After leaving Bezeguiche, the mapping expedition would make landfall at [[Cape S\u00e3o Roque]] in August 1501, and proceeded to sail south along the Brazilian coast, possibly as far as the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] coast. They returned to Lisbon before September 1502, perhaps as early as June. A second mapping expedition, this time more certainly under [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], also accompanied by Vespucci (his \"fourth voyage\"), set out for Brazil in April, 1503.</ref>\n\nMid-June, 1501 \u2013 Lemos & Vespucci leave Bezeguiche for Brazil. Shortly after, the pair [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda themselves reach Bezeguiche, where they find Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho awaiting them. Cabral sends Coelho's swift ''Anunciada'' ahead to Lisbon to announce their return, while the remainder rest and wait in Bezeguiche for the remaining two ships.  [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]'s ship (making his way alone from Mossel Bay) and [[Sancho de Tovar]]'s ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (returning from Sofala) arrive in Bezeguiche by the end of June.\n\nJune 23, 1501 \u2013 The ''Anunciada'', commanded by [[Nicolau Coelho]], arrives in Lisbon and anchors in [[Bel\u00e9m]].  (Just as in case of Vasco da Gama's expedition, it turns out Nicolau Coelho is once again the first to deliver the news!)  The merchants of the consortium led by [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] (who own the ''Anunciada'') are delighted.  Letters are immediately fired off throughout Europe announcing the results.\n\nThe news arrives too late for [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd India Armada]], which departed for India in April.  But Nova will collect the necessary information along the way\u2014from the note in Ata\u00edde's shoe in Mossel Bay, and from Cabral's letters in the possession of Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes in Kilwa.\n\nJuly 21, 1501 \u2013 One month after Coelho's arrival, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda, the two larger ships, finally arrive in Lisbon. The other three ships arrive a few days later: Sancho de Tovar and P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde on July 25 and the hapless Diogo Dias, with his empty caravel, on July 27.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bernardelli - Monumento a Cabral.jpg|thumb|180px|Monument to [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in Lisbon, copy of a Brazilian monument by Rodolpho Bernardelli]]\nOn the surface, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral's 2nd Armada had been a failure and the reaction was conspicuously muted.\n\nShip losses were very heavy. Of the thirteen ships sent out, only five returned with cargo (four crown, one private), five were lost at sea, three returned without cargo (Gaspar de Lemos, Lu\u00eds Pires and Diogo Dias).\n\nHuman losses were even more disheartening.  This included all the crews and captains of the four ships lost at the Cape (notably, the celebrated discoverer Bartolomeu Dias).  Another fifty-something Portuguese (including the factor Aires Correia) had been killed in the Calicut massacre.\n\nThen there were the mission failures.  Relative to the instructions given to him in Lisbon, Cabral had failed on nearly every count:\n*1. failed to establish a treaty with the Zamorin of Calicut\u2014indeed, Calicut was now more hostile than ever.\n*2. failed to establish a factory at Calicut (massacred);\n*3. failed to bring the 'Hindu Church' in line (the friars that survived reported the Hindus weren't Christians after all, just 'idolaters');\n*4. failed to make a treaty with Kilwa;\n*5. failed to establish a factory at Sofala (seen from afar by Tovar, but that is all).\n\nOn the other hand, in his defense, Cabral could point to some positive achievements.\n\n*1. opening of friendly relations with Cochin, Canannore and Quilon;\n*2. a factory in Cochin, poorer than Calicut perhaps, but workable;\n*3. discovery of true Christian communities in Cranganore, etc.;\n*4. Sofala was at least discovered and scouted;\n*5. discovery of Brazil, which might serve as a useful staging post for future India runs;\n*6. Diogo Dias's discovery of Madagascar and exploration of the African coast up to Cape Guardafui and the Gulf of Aden was useful information.\n*7. Finally, Cabral did bring back tons of spices, which were off-loaded into the Lisbon warehouses and sold at no small profit for the crown treasury.\n\nHowever, it was the ship and human losses that weighed heavily against Cabral being honored or rewarded. Allegations of 'incompetence' flew easily in the circles that mattered. Although Cabral was initially offered the command of the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th Armada]], scheduled for 1502, it seemed more like a ''pro forma'' gesture than a sincere offer.<ref>Subrahmanyam (1997: p.191)</ref> The crown made it clear that Cabral's command would be limited and supervised \u2013 conditions humiliating enough to force Cabral to withdraw his name.  The 4th Armada would be placed under the command of Vasco da Gama.\n\nAlthough the reaction of Portuguese court opinion in 1501, on Cabral's return, was generally low, it ascended retrospectively.  Cabral's discovery of Brazil, initially received as a minor discovery of little interest, turned out to be much more momentous.  The follow-up Brazilian mapping expeditions of 1501-02 and 1503-04, under the captaincy of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], carrying the Florentine cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], revealed a massive continent - which Vespucci famously labelled a \"[[New World]]\" (''Mundus Novus'').  The plentitude of [[brazilwood]] (''pau-brasil'') discovered by the mapping expeditions on its shores lured the interest of European cloth industry, and led to the 1505 contract granted to [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]] for the commercial exploitation of Brazil. The lucrative brazilwood trade eventually drew competition from French and Spanish interlopers, forcing the Portuguese government to take a more active interest in Cabral's \"[[Name of Brazil|Land of Vera Cruz]]\", finally leading to the establishment of the first Portuguese colonies in [[Colonial Brazil]] in 1532.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Carta de P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]]\n* [[Portuguese India Armadas]]\n* [[Portuguese India]]\n* [[Alternative theory of the European discovery of Brazil]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note |30em}}\n\n== References == \n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n'''Eyewitness Accounts'''\n\n* [Anonymous Pilot] \"Navigationi del Capitano Pedro Alvares Cabral Scrita per un Piloto Portoghese et Tradotta di Lingua Portoghese in Italiana\", first published in Francanzano Montalbado, 1507, editor, ''Paesi novamente retrovati et Novo Mondo da Alberico Vesputio Florentino intitulato'', Vicenza.

(April 1915). \"The F. F. V.'s of Virginia\". William and Mary College Quarterly Historical Magazine.

These elite families generally married within their social class for many generations and, as a result, most surnames of First Families date to the colonial period.\n\nThe American Revolution cut ties with Britain but not with its social traditions. While some First Family members were loyal to Britain, others were Whigs who not only supported, but led the Revolution.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gutzman |first=Kevin R. C. |title=Virginia's American Revolution: From Dominion tor Republic, 1776\u20131840 |location=Lanham |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7391-2131-3 }}</ref> Most First Families remained in Virginia, where they flourished as tobacco planters, and from the sale of slaves to the cotton states to the south. Indeed, many younger sons were relocated into the cotton belt to start their own plantations. The Civil War devastated the Virginia economy, and emancipated all the slaves without compensation. Planters and small farmers both were economically hurt, but in general the First Families, albeit poorer than before, maintained social and political leadership. [[Marshall Fishwick]] says that by the 1950s, \"the old-time aristocracy [had] not given up, or sunk into decadence as Southern novelists suggest.\" They adopted modern agricultural technology and co-opted rich \"Yankees\" into their upper-class, rural horse-estate society.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fishwick |first=Marshall |title=F. F. V.'s |journal=American Quarterly |year=1959 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=147\u2013156 |jstor=2710671 }}</ref>\n\n==English heritage, second sons==\n[[File:Mann Page II of Virginia Charles Bridges.jpeg|thumb|Mann Page II of [[Rosewell (plantation)|Rosewell]], painted by Charles Bridges.  The Rosewell plantation was called one of the finest homes in colonial America and built of brick imported from England.]]\n\nEnglish colonists who formed the FFV emigrated to the new [[Colony of Virginia]]. Their migration took place from the settlement of Jamestown through the [[English Civil War]] and [[English Interregnum]] period (1642\u20131660). Some royalists left England on the accession to power of Oliver Cromwell and his Parliament. Because most of Virginia's leading families recognized [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King following the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, Charles II reputedly called Virginia his \"Old Dominion\" \u2013 a nickname that endures today. The affinity of many early supposedly aristocratic Virginia settlers for the Crown led to the term \"distressed Cavaliers\", often applied to the Virginia oligarchy. Some Cavaliers who served under King Charles I fled to Virginia. FFVs often refer to Virginia as \"Cavalier Country\". These men were offered rewards of land, etc., by King Charles II, but most who had settled in Virginia stayed in Virginia.\n\nMany such early settlers in Virginia were so-called \"Second Sons\". [[Primogeniture]] favored the first sons' inheriting lands and titles in England. Second or third sons went out to the colonies to make their fortune, or entered the military and the clergy. Tidewater Virginia evolved as a society descended from second or third sons of English gentry who inherited [[land grant]]s or land in Virginia. They formed part of what became the southern elite in America.\n\nIn some cases, longstanding ties among families of the English gentry were carried to the new colony, where they were reinforced by marriage and other relations. For instance, there were ancestral ties between the [[Nicholas Spencer|Spencer]] family of Bedfordshire and the [[Washington (name)|Washington]] family; a Spencer secured the land grant later purchased by the Washingtons, where they built their [[Mount Vernon]] home. These sorts of ties were common in the early colony, as families shuttled back and forth between England and Virginia, maintaining their connections with the mother country and with each other.\n\nA thin network of increasingly interrelated families made up the planter elite and held power in colonial Virginia. \"As early as 1660 every seat on the ruling Council of Virginia was held by members of five interrelated families,\" writes British historian [[John Keegan]], \"and as late as 1775 every council member was descended from one of the 1660 councillors.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The American Civil War |page=[https://archive.org/details/americancivilwar00keeg/page/334 334] |first=John |last=Keegan |authorlink=John Keegan |publisher=Alfred A.

In a pre-Revolutionary War economy dependent on the production of tobacco as a commodity crop, the ownership of the best land was tightly controlled. It often passed between families of corresponding social rank. The Virginia economy was based on slave labor as the colony became a slave society. The landed gentry could keep tight rein on political power, which passed in somewhat orderly fashion from family to family. (In the more modern mercantile economy of the north, social mobility became more prominent. The power of the elite was muted by newcomers who gained wealth in the [[market economy]].)\n\n==Pocahontas ==\n[[File:Pocahontas by Simon van de Passe 1616.jpg|thumb|Pocahontas by [[Van de Passe family|Simon de Passe]]]]\n\n[[Pocahontas]] (1595\u20131617), a [[Native Americans of the United States|Native American]], was the daughter of  [[Chief Powhatan]], founder of the [[Powhatan Confederacy]].

Rolfe had become prominent and wealthy as the first to successfully develop an export [[cash crop]] for the Colony with new varieties of tobacco. Their only child, [[Thomas Rolfe]], was born on January 30, 1615. He married and had a family: his descendants married into other elite families.\n\nPocahontas was much celebrated in London where she was welcomed with great ceremony at the Royal Court. She died young but became legendary as the first Indian from Virginia to become Christian, marry an Englishman, and have a known child from such a marriage. (There were no doubt mixed-race children born to lower-class colonists and [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] women, although they may have been neither married nor Christian.) She became an important symbol of friendly Native American-English relations of the Jamestown colony. By virtue of many fictional accounts, her marriage was romanticized and became part of the mythology of early American history.<ref>[[Camilla Townsend]], ''Pocahontas and the Powhatan Dilemma'' (2007)</ref><ref>F. W. Gleach, ''Powhatan's world and colonial Virginia'' (1997)</ref>\n\n==Organizing the FFV==\nIn 1887, following the [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction era]] after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Virginia Governor [[Wyndham Robertson]] wrote the first history of Pocahontas and her descendants, delineating the ancestry of FFV families including the Bollings, Clements, Whittles, Blands, Skipwiths, Flemings, Catletts, Gays, Jordans, Randolphs, Tazewells, and many others.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/pocahontasalias00robegoog <!-- quote=\"wyndham robertson\" pocahontas. --> Wyndham Robertson, ''Pocahontas, alias Matoaka, and Her Descendants''], Richmond VA: J.

A mother's maiden name might be used as a \"[[middle name]]\", to document that part of the person's ancestry. For example, Lt. Col. Powhatan Bolling Whittle of the [[38th Virginia Infantry]], [[Confederate States Army]] was an uncle of Matoaka Whittle Sims.<ref>[http://www.victorianvilla.com/sims-mitchell/history/whittle_pb/index.htm Lt.

These elite families generally married within their social class for many generations and, as a result, most surnames of First Families date to the colonial period.\n\nThe American Revolution cut ties with Britain but not with its social traditions. While some First Family members were loyal to Britain, others were Whigs who not only supported, but led the Revolution.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gutzman |first=Kevin R. C. |title=Virginia's American Revolution: From Dominion tor Republic, 1776\u20131840 |location=Lanham |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7391-2131-3 }}</ref> Most First Families remained in Virginia, where they flourished as tobacco planters, and from the sale of slaves to the cotton states to the south. Indeed, many younger sons were relocated into the cotton belt to start their own plantations. The Civil War devastated the Virginia economy, and emancipated all the slaves without compensation. Planters and small farmers both were economically hurt, but in general the First Families, albeit poorer than before, maintained social and political leadership. [[Marshall Fishwick]] says that by the 1950s, \"the old-time aristocracy [had] not given up, or sunk into decadence as Southern novelists suggest.\" They adopted modern agricultural technology and co-opted rich \"Yankees\" into their upper-class, rural horse-estate society.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fishwick |first=Marshall |title=F. F. V.'s |journal=American Quarterly |year=1959 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=147\u2013156 |jstor=2710671 }}</ref>\n\n==English heritage, second sons==\n[[File:Mann Page II of Virginia Charles Bridges.jpeg|thumb|Mann Page II of [[Rosewell (plantation)|Rosewell]], painted by Charles Bridges.  The Rosewell plantation was called one of the finest homes in colonial America and built of brick imported from England.]]\n\nEnglish colonists who formed the FFV emigrated to the new [[Colony of Virginia]]. Their migration took place from the settlement of Jamestown through the [[English Civil War]] and [[English Interregnum]] period (1642\u20131660). Some royalists left England on the accession to power of Oliver Cromwell and his Parliament. Because most of Virginia's leading families recognized [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King following the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, Charles II reputedly called Virginia his \"Old Dominion\" \u2013 a nickname that endures today. The affinity of many early supposedly aristocratic Virginia settlers for the Crown led to the term \"distressed Cavaliers\", often applied to the Virginia oligarchy. Some Cavaliers who served under King Charles I fled to Virginia. FFVs often refer to Virginia as \"Cavalier Country\". These men were offered rewards of land, etc., by King Charles II, but most who had settled in Virginia stayed in Virginia.\n\nMany such early settlers in Virginia were so-called \"Second Sons\". [[Primogeniture]] favored the first sons' inheriting lands and titles in England. Second or third sons went out to the colonies to make their fortune, or entered the military and the clergy. Tidewater Virginia evolved as a society descended from second or third sons of English gentry who inherited [[land grant]]s or land in Virginia. They formed part of what became the southern elite in America.\n\nIn some cases, longstanding ties among families of the English gentry were carried to the new colony, where they were reinforced by marriage and other relations. For instance, there were ancestral ties between the [[Nicholas Spencer|Spencer]] family of Bedfordshire and the [[Washington (name)|Washington]] family; a Spencer secured the land grant later purchased by the Washingtons, where they built their [[Mount Vernon]] home. These sorts of ties were common in the early colony, as families shuttled back and forth between England and Virginia, maintaining their connections with the mother country and with each other.\n\nA thin network of increasingly interrelated families made up the planter elite and held power in colonial Virginia. \"As early as 1660 every seat on the ruling Council of Virginia was held by members of five interrelated families,\" writes British historian [[John Keegan]], \"and as late as 1775 every council member was descended from one of the 1660 councillors.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The American Civil War |page=[https://archive.org/details/americancivilwar00keeg/page/334 334] |first=John |last=Keegan |authorlink=John Keegan |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-307-26343-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/americancivilwar00keeg/page/334 }}</ref>\n\nThe ties among Virginia families were based on marriage. In a pre-Revolutionary War economy dependent on the production of tobacco as a commodity crop, the ownership of the best land was tightly controlled. It often passed between families of corresponding social rank. The Virginia economy was based on slave labor as the colony became a slave society. The landed gentry could keep tight rein on political power, which passed in somewhat orderly fashion from family to family. (In the more modern mercantile economy of the north, social mobility became more prominent. The power of the elite was muted by newcomers who gained wealth in the [[market economy]].)\n\n==Pocahontas ==\n[[File:Pocahontas by Simon van de Passe 1616.jpg|thumb|Pocahontas by [[Van de Passe family|Simon de Passe]]]]\n\n[[Pocahontas]] (1595\u20131617), a [[Native Americans of the United States|Native American]], was the daughter of  [[Chief Powhatan]], founder of the [[Powhatan Confederacy]]. According to [[Mattaponi]] and [[Patawomeck]] tradition, Pocahontas was previously married to a Patawomeck ''[[weroance]]'', Kocoum, who was murdered by Englishmen when [[Samuel Argall]] abducted her on April 13, 1613.<ref name=\"tides\">{{cite journal |last=Deyo |first=William \"Night Owl\" |date=5 September 2009 |title=Our Patawomeck Ancestors |url=http://patawomeckindians.org/Patawomeck%20Tides%202009.pdf |journal=Patawomeck Tides |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=2\u20137 |accessdate=6 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714145119/http://patawomeckindians.org/Patawomeck%20Tides%202009.pdf |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Educated among the English of Virginia and converted to Christianity during her captivity in [[Henricus]], Pocahontas married colonist [[John Rolfe]] at a church in Jamestown on April 5, 1614. Rolfe had become prominent and wealthy as the first to successfully develop an export [[cash crop]] for the Colony with new varieties of tobacco. Their only child, [[Thomas Rolfe]], was born on January 30, 1615. He married and had a family: his descendants married into other elite families.\n\nPocahontas was much celebrated in London where she was welcomed with great ceremony at the Royal Court. She died young but became legendary as the first Indian from Virginia to become Christian, marry an Englishman, and have a known child from such a marriage. (There were no doubt mixed-race children born to lower-class colonists and [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] women, although they may have been neither married nor Christian.) She became an important symbol of friendly Native American-English relations of the Jamestown colony. By virtue of many fictional accounts, her marriage was romanticized and became part of the mythology of early American history.<ref>[[Camilla Townsend]], ''Pocahontas and the Powhatan Dilemma'' (2007)</ref><ref>F. W. Gleach, ''Powhatan's world and colonial Virginia'' (1997)</ref>\n\n==Organizing the FFV==\nIn 1887, following the [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction era]] after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Virginia Governor [[Wyndham Robertson]] wrote the first history of Pocahontas and her descendants, delineating the ancestry of FFV families including the Bollings, Clements, Whittles, Blands, Skipwiths, Flemings, Catletts, Gays, Jordans, Randolphs, Tazewells, and many others.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/pocahontasalias00robegoog <!-- quote=\"wyndham robertson\" pocahontas. --> Wyndham Robertson, ''Pocahontas, alias Matoaka, and Her Descendants''], Richmond VA: J. W. Randolph & English, 1887</ref> Excluded from this history were 'natural children', [[mixed-race]] descendants of unions with slaves.\n\nFamilies often used surnames as given names, as in the \"Johns\" of [[Johns Hopkins University]]. A mother's maiden name might be used as a \"[[middle name]]\", to document that part of the person's ancestry. For example, Lt. Col. Powhatan Bolling Whittle of the [[38th Virginia Infantry]], [[Confederate States Army]] was an uncle of Matoaka Whittle Sims.<ref>[http://www.victorianvilla.com/sims-mitchell/history/whittle_pb/index.htm Lt.

Harris.<ref>Waghorn, p.56.</ref>\n\nHarris' first recorded game for Hampshire was against [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] on 3\u20135 July 1782, a match which also featured the known debut of Kent's [[Joey Ring]].<ref name=\"SB51\">Haygarth, p. 51.</ref> Although he was never noted as a batsman, Harris made the top score of 27 in Hampshire's first innings, in which they were dismissed for 87.<ref name=\"SB51\"/> Harris played three times for Hampshire in the 1783 season, twice against Kent and once against [[All-England Eleven|All-England]]. He took nine wickets in these matches.<ref>Haygarth, p.57\u201359.</ref>\n\nHarris is only recorded once in 1784 when he again played for Odiham in a minor match. In 1785, when few first-class matches took place, Harris played for [[Berkshire county cricket teams|Berkshire]] against [[Essex county cricket teams|Essex]].<ref>Waghorn, p. 64.</ref>\n\nOn 13 July 1776, Harris had his best known performance to date when he took four 1st innings wickets for Hampshire v. Kent at [[Windmill Down]], Hampshire winning the game by 1 wicket. This was the match in which [[Tom Sueter]] was given out [[hit the ball twice]], the earliest recorded instance of this form of dismissal.<ref>Haygarth, p. 66.</ref> On 8\u201312 August of the same year, Harris played for the [[White Conduit Club]] against Kent at [[Bourne Paddock]] and took six wickets in the match, three in each innings, to help White Conduit to a 164 run victory. White Conduit's big win was due to [[Tom Walker (cricketer)|Tom Walker]] and [[Thomas Taylor (cricketer)|Tom Taylor]] becoming the first players known to score a century in the same innings. Walker made 95* and 102, just missing the honour of becoming the first player to score two centuries in a match.<ref>Haygarth, p. 68.</ref>\n\nPlaying for [[Sir Horatio Mann]]'s XI against the [[George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea|Earl of Winchilsea]]'s XI at the new [[Lord's Old Ground]] on 26\u201328 May 1788, Harris took 10 wickets in the match with 4 in the 1st innings and 6 in the 2nd. But it was to little avail as Winchilsea's XI won by 106 runs.<ref>Haygarth, p.81.</ref>\n\nBy now, Harris' reputation was well established and he played regularly in major matches into the 1790s. He was a frequent taker of wickets and again took ten in a match on 30\u201331 August 1790 when he guided Hampshire to a 10-wicket win against [[All-England Eleven|All-England]] at Lord's Old Ground.<ref>Haygarth, p.108.</ref> On 15\u201317 August 1792, Harris had the best known return of his career when he took 11 wickets in the match for Hampshire against Kent at Cobham Park, including eight in the first innings. Hampshire won by 8 wickets.<ref>Haygarth, p.140.</ref>\n\nHis later career was ruined by attacks of [[gout]] and Harris played his final match on 13\u201315 August 1798 for All-England v. Surrey at Lord's Old Ground. He took five wickets in the 1st innings and his last, subject to the batting order, was when he bowled [[W. Wells (Middlesex cricketer)|W Wells]] for 5. He scored 0* in his final innings and his team won the match by an innings and 1 run.<ref>Haygarth, p.243\u2013244.</ref> He died 19 May 1803, [[Crookham Village]], Hampshire\n\n==Style and technique==\n{{cquote|In taking my place at the wicket, I almost felt as if taking my ground in a duel... and my terrors were so much increased by the mock pity and sympathy of Hammond, Beldham, and others round the wicket, that when this mighty bowler, this ''Jupiter tonas'', hurled his bolt at me, I shut my eyes in the intensity of my panic, and mechanically gave a random desperate blow, which, to my utter astonishment, was followed by a loud cry all over the ring of 'run, run'.<sub> \u2013 Playwright Lord [[Frederic Reynolds|Frederick Reynolds]] on facing Harris.</sub><ref name=\"Major2007\">{{cite book|last=Major|first=John S.|title=More than a Game: the Story of Cricket's Early Years|year=2007|publisher=HarperPress|location=London|isbn=0-00-718364-X|page=122}}</ref>}}\n\nHarris was highly rated by his contemporaries, especially [[John Nyren]], who called him \"the very best bowler; a bowler who, between any one and himself, comparison must fail\".<ref name=\"N93\"/>\n\nNyren described Harris' style and technique in some detail. Harris began from an erect stance \"like a soldier at drill\" and raised the ball to his forehead before stepping forward.

In theory, this eliminates the need to distribute different executable files for different platforms and CPU types. CIL code is verified for safety during runtime, providing better security and reliability than natively compiled executable files.\n\nThe execution process looks like this:\n\n#Source code is converted to CIL [[bytecode]] and a [[Assembly (CLI)|CLI assembly]] is created.\n#Upon execution of a CIL assembly, its code is passed through the runtime's [[Just-in-time compilation|JIT compiler]] to generate native code. Ahead-of-time compilation may also be used, which eliminates this step, but at the cost of executable-file portability.\n#The computer's processor executes the native code.\n\n==Instructions==\n{{See also|List of CIL instructions}}\n\nCIL bytecode has [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]]s for the following groups of tasks:\n*Load and store\n*[[Arithmetic]]\n*[[Type conversion]]\n*[[Dynamic memory allocation|Object creation and manipulation]]\n*[[stack (data structure)|Operand stack management (push / pop)]]\n*[[branch (computer science)|Control transfer (branching)]]\n*[[Subroutine|Method invocation and return]]\n*[[Exception handling|Throwing exceptions]]\n*[[Monitor (synchronization)|Monitor-based concurrency]]\n*Data and function pointers manipulation needed for C++/CLI and unsafe C# code\n\n==Computational model==\nThe Common Intermediate Language is object-oriented and [[stack-based]]. That means that data is pushed on a stack instead of pulled from registers as in most [[CPU architecture]]s.\n\nIn [[x86]] it might look like this:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"asm\">\nadd eax, edx\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe corresponding code in [[Intermediate language|IL]] can be rendered as this, where 0 is eax and 1 is edx:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\nldloc.0    // push local variable 0 onto stack\nldloc.1    // push local variable 1 onto stack\nadd        // pop and add the top two stack items then push the result onto the stack\nstloc.0    // pop and store the top stack item to local variable 0\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nHere are two locals that are pushed on the stack. When the add-instruction is called the operands get popped and the result is pushed. The remaining value is then popped and stored in the first local.\n\n===Object-oriented concepts===\nThis extends to object-oriented concepts as well. You may create objects, call methods and use other types of members such as fields.\n\nCIL is designed to be object-oriented and every [[Method (programming)|method]] needs (with some exceptions) to reside in a class. So does this static method:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\n.class public Foo\n{\n    .method public static int32 Add(int32, int32) cil managed\n    {\n        .maxstack 2\n        ldarg.0 // load the first argument;\n        ldarg.1 // load the second argument;\n        add     // add them;\n        ret     // return the result;\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis method does not require any instance of Foo to be declared because it is static. That means it belongs to the class and it may then be used like this in C#:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\nint r = Foo.Add(2, 3);    // 5\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn CIL:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\nldc.i4.2\nldc.i4.3\ncall int32 Foo::Add(int32, int32)\nstloc.0\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n====Instance classes====\n\nAn instance class contains at least one constructor and some instance members. This class has a set of methods representing actions of a Car-object.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\n.class public Car\n{\n    .method public specialname rtspecialname instance void .ctor(int32, int32) cil managed\n    {\n        /* Constructor */\n    }\n\n    .method public void Move(int32) cil managed\n    {\n        /* Omitting implementation */\n    }\n\n    .method public void TurnRight() cil managed\n    {\n        /* Omitting implementation */\n    }\n\n    .method public void TurnLeft() cil managed\n    {\n        /* Omitting implementation */\n    }\n\n    .method public void Brake() cil managed\n    {\n        /* Omitting implementation */\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n====Creating objects====\n\nIn C# class instances are created like this:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\nCar myCar = new Car(1, 4); \nCar yourCar = new Car(1, 3); \n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAnd these statements are roughly the same as these instructions:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\nldc.i4.1\nldc.i4.4\nnewobj instance void Car::.ctor(int, int)\nstloc.0    // myCar = new Car(1, 4);\nldc.i4.1\nldc.i4.3\nnewobj instance void Car::.ctor(int, int)\nstloc.1    // yourCar = new Car(1, 3);\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n====Invoking instance methods====\n\nInstance methods are invoked like the one that follows:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\nmyCar.Move(3);\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn CIL:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\nldloc.0    // Load the object \"myCar\" on the stack\nldc.i4.3\ncall instance void Car::Move(int32)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Metadata===\n{{Main|Metadata (CLI)}}\nCLI records information about compiled classes as [[Metadata]]. Like the type library in the [[Component Object Model]], this enables applications to support and discover the interfaces, classes, types, methods, and fields in the assembly. The process of reading such metadata is called ''[[Reflection (computer science)|reflection]]''.\n\nMetadata can be data in the form of '' attributes''. Attributes can be custom made by extending from the <code>Attribute</code> class. This is a very powerful feature. It allows the creator of the class the ability to adorn it with extra information that consumers of the class can use in various meaningful ways depending on the application domain.\n\n==Example==\nBelow is a basic [[Hello, World]] program written in CIL. It will display the string \"Hello, world!\".\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\n.assembly Hello {}\n.assembly extern mscorlib {}\n.method static void Main()\n{\n    .entrypoint\n    .maxstack 1\n    ldstr \"Hello, world!\"\n    call void [mscorlib]System.Console::WriteLine(string)\n    ret\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe following code is more complex in number of opcodes.\n\n''This code can also be compared with the corresponding code in the article about [[Java bytecode]].''\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\n    for (int i = 2; i < 1000; i++)\n    {\n        for (int j = 2; j < i; j++)\n        {\n             if (i % j == 0)\n                 goto outer;\n        }\n        Console.WriteLine(i);\n        outer:;\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn CIL syntax it looks like this:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\n.method private hidebysig static void Main(string[] args) cil managed\n{\n    .entrypoint\n    .maxstack  2\n    .locals init (int32 V_0,\n                  int32 V_1)\n\n              ldc.i4.2\n              stloc.0\n              br.s       IL_001f\n    IL_0004:  ldc.i4.2\n              stloc.1\n              br.s       IL_0011\n    IL_0008:  ldloc.0\n              ldloc.1\n              rem\n              brfalse.s  IL_001b\n              ldloc.1\n              ldc.i4.1\n              add\n              stloc.1\n    IL_0011:  ldloc.1\n              ldloc.0\n              blt.s      IL_0008\n              ldloc.0\n              call       void [mscorlib]System.Console::WriteLine(int32)\n    IL_001b:  ldloc.0\n              ldc.i4.1\n              add\n              stloc.0\n    IL_001f:  ldloc.0\n              ldc.i4     0x3e8\n              blt.s      IL_0004\n              ret\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis is just a representation of how CIL looks like near VM-level. When compiled the methods are stored in tables and the instructions are stored as bytes inside the assembly, which is a [[Portable Executable]] (PE).\n\n==Generation==\nA CIL assembly and instructions are generated by either a compiler or a utility called the ''IL Assembler'' ([[ILAsm]]) that is shipped with the execution environment.\n\nAssembled CIL can also be disassembled into code again using the ''IL Disassembler'' (ILDASM). There are other tools such as [[.NET Reflector]] that can decompile CIL into a high-level language (e.&nbsp;g. C# or [[Visual Basic .NET|Visual Basic]]). This makes CIL a very easy target for reverse engineering. This trait is shared with [[Java bytecode]]. However, there are tools that can [[Obfuscated code|obfuscate]] the code, and do it so that the code cannot be easily readable but still be runnable.\n\n==Execution==\n\n===Just-in-time compilation===\n[[Just-in-time compilation]] (JIT) involves turning the byte-code into code immediately executable by the CPU. The conversion is performed gradually during the program's execution. JIT compilation provides environment-specific optimization, runtime type safety, and assembly verification. To accomplish this, the JIT compiler examines the assembly metadata for any illegal accesses and handles violations appropriately.\n\n===Ahead-of-time compilation===\n[[Common Language Infrastructure|CLI]]-compatible execution environments also come with the option to do an [[Ahead-of-time compilation]] (AOT) of an assembly to make it execute faster by removing the JIT process at runtime.\n\nIn the [[.NET Framework]] there is a special tool called the [[Native Image Generator]] (NGEN) that performs the AOT. A different approach for AOT is [[CoreRT]] that allows the compilation of .Net Core code to a single executable with no dependency on a runtime. In [[Mono (programming)|Mono]] there is also an option to do an AOT.\n\n==Pointer instructions - C++/CLI==\nA notable difference from Java's bytecode is that CIL comes with ldind, stind, ldloca, and many call instructions which are enough for data/function pointers manipulation needed to compile C/C++ code into CIL.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\nclass A {\n   public: virtual void __stdcall meth() {}\n};\nvoid test_pointer_operations(int param) {\n\tint k = 0;\n\tint * ptr = &k;\n\t*ptr = 1;\n\tptr = &param;\n\t*ptr = 2;\n\tA a;\n\tA * ptra = &a;\n\tptra->meth();\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe corresponding code in CIL can be rendered as this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\n.method assembly static void modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallConvCdecl) \n        test_pointer_operations(int32 param) cil managed\n{\n  .vtentry 1 : 1\n  // Code size       44 (0x2c)\n  .maxstack  2\n  .locals ([0] int32* ptr,\n           [1] valuetype A* V_1,\n           [2] valuetype A* a,\n           [3] int32 k)\n// k = 0;\n  IL_0000:  ldc.i4.0 \n  IL_0001:  stloc.3\n// ptr = &k;\n  IL_0002:  ldloca.s   k // load local's address instruction\n  IL_0004:  stloc.0\n// *ptr = 1;\n  IL_0005:  ldloc.0\n  IL_0006:  ldc.i4.1\n  IL_0007:  stind.i4 // indirection instruction\n// ptr = &param\n  IL_0008:  ldarga.s   param // load parameter's address instruction\n  IL_000a:  stloc.0\n// *ptr = 2\n  IL_000b:  ldloc.0\n  IL_000c:  ldc.i4.2\n  IL_000d:  stind.i4\n// a = new A;\n  IL_000e:  ldloca.s   a\n  IL_0010:  call       valuetype A* modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallConvThiscall) 'A.{ctor}'(valuetype A* modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IsConst) modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IsConst))\n  IL_0015:  pop\n// ptra = &a;\n  IL_0016:  ldloca.s   a\n  IL_0018:  stloc.1\n// ptra->meth();\n  IL_0019:  ldloc.1\n  IL_001a:  dup\n  IL_001b:  ldind.i4 // reading the VMT for virtual call\n  IL_001c:  ldind.i4\n  IL_001d:  calli      unmanaged stdcall void modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallConvStdcall)(native int)\n  IL_0022:  ret\n} // end of method 'Global Functions'::test_pointer_operations\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of CIL instructions]]\n*[[List_of_CLI_languages]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm Common Language Infrastructure (Standard ECMA-335)]\n*[https://www.visualstudio.com/license-terms/ecma-c-common-language-infrastructure-standards/ \u201cECMA C# and Common Language Infrastructure Standards\u201d on the Visual Studio website]\n*[[wikibooks:Computer Programming/Hello world#CIL|Hello world program in CIL]]\n*[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163808.aspx Speed: NGen Revs Up Your Performance With Powerful New Features -- MSDN Magazine, April 2005]\n\n{{Common Language Infrastructure}}\n\n[[Category:Assembly languages]]\n[[Category:Common Language Infrastructure]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Intermediate representation defined within the CLI specification}}\n{{confused|C Intermediate Language}}\n{{refimprove|date=November 2017}}\n'''Common Intermediate Language''' ('''CIL'''), formerly called '''Microsoft Intermediate Language''' ('''MSIL''') or '''Intermediate Language''' ('''IL'''),<ref>{{cite web |url = https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/managed-code |title = Intermediate Language & execution}}</ref> is the [[intermediate language]] binary instruction set defined within the [[Common Language Infrastructure]] (CLI) specification.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-335.pdf |page = 32 |title = ECMA-335 Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)}}</ref> CIL instructions are executed by a CLI-compatible runtime environment such as the [[Common Language Runtime]].

This class has a set of methods representing actions of a Car-object.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\n.class public Car\n{\n    .method public specialname rtspecialname instance void .ctor(int32, int32) cil managed\n    {\n        /* Constructor */\n    }\n\n    .method public void Move(int32) cil managed\n    {\n        /* Omitting implementation */\n    }\n\n    .method public void TurnRight() cil managed\n    {\n        /* Omitting implementation */\n    }\n\n    .method public void TurnLeft() cil managed\n    {\n        /* Omitting implementation */\n    }\n\n    .method public void Brake() cil managed\n    {\n        /* Omitting implementation */\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n====Creating objects====\n\nIn C# class instances are created like this:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\nCar myCar = new Car(1, 4); \nCar yourCar = new Car(1, 3); \n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAnd these statements are roughly the same as these instructions:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\nldc.i4.1\nldc.i4.4\nnewobj instance void Car::.ctor(int, int)\nstloc.0    // myCar = new Car(1, 4);\nldc.i4.1\nldc.i4.3\nnewobj instance void Car::.ctor(int, int)\nstloc.1    // yourCar = new Car(1, 3);\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n====Invoking instance methods====\n\nInstance methods are invoked like the one that follows:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\nmyCar.Move(3);\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn CIL:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\nldloc.0    // Load the object \"myCar\" on the stack\nldc.i4.3\ncall instance void Car::Move(int32)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Metadata===\n{{Main|Metadata (CLI)}}\nCLI records information about compiled classes as [[Metadata]]. Like the type library in the [[Component Object Model]], this enables applications to support and discover the interfaces, classes, types, methods, and fields in the assembly. The process of reading such metadata is called ''[[Reflection (computer science)|reflection]]''.\n\nMetadata can be data in the form of '' attributes''. Attributes can be custom made by extending from the <code>Attribute</code> class. This is a very powerful feature. It allows the creator of the class the ability to adorn it with extra information that consumers of the class can use in various meaningful ways depending on the application domain.\n\n==Example==\nBelow is a basic [[Hello, World]] program written in CIL. It will display the string \"Hello, world!\".\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\n.assembly Hello {}\n.assembly extern mscorlib {}\n.method static void Main()\n{\n    .entrypoint\n    .maxstack 1\n    ldstr \"Hello, world!\"\n    call void [mscorlib]System.Console::WriteLine(string)\n    ret\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe following code is more complex in number of opcodes.\n\n''This code can also be compared with the corresponding code in the article about [[Java bytecode]].''\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"csharp\">\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\n    for (int i = 2; i < 1000; i++)\n    {\n        for (int j = 2; j < i; j++)\n        {\n             if (i % j == 0)\n                 goto outer;\n        }\n        Console.WriteLine(i);\n        outer:;\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn CIL syntax it looks like this:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\n.method private hidebysig static void Main(string[] args) cil managed\n{\n    .entrypoint\n    .maxstack  2\n    .locals init (int32 V_0,\n                  int32 V_1)\n\n              ldc.i4.2\n              stloc.0\n              br.s       IL_001f\n    IL_0004:  ldc.i4.2\n              stloc.1\n              br.s       IL_0011\n    IL_0008:  ldloc.0\n              ldloc.1\n              rem\n              brfalse.s  IL_001b\n              ldloc.1\n              ldc.i4.1\n              add\n              stloc.1\n    IL_0011:  ldloc.1\n              ldloc.0\n              blt.s      IL_0008\n              ldloc.0\n              call       void [mscorlib]System.Console::WriteLine(int32)\n    IL_001b:  ldloc.0\n              ldc.i4.1\n              add\n              stloc.0\n    IL_001f:  ldloc.0\n              ldc.i4     0x3e8\n              blt.s      IL_0004\n              ret\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis is just a representation of how CIL looks like near VM-level. When compiled the methods are stored in tables and the instructions are stored as bytes inside the assembly, which is a [[Portable Executable]] (PE).\n\n==Generation==\nA CIL assembly and instructions are generated by either a compiler or a utility called the ''IL Assembler'' ([[ILAsm]]) that is shipped with the execution environment.\n\nAssembled CIL can also be disassembled into code again using the ''IL Disassembler'' (ILDASM). There are other tools such as [[.NET Reflector]] that can decompile CIL into a high-level language (e.&nbsp;g. C# or [[Visual Basic .NET|Visual Basic]]). This makes CIL a very easy target for reverse engineering. This trait is shared with [[Java bytecode]]. However, there are tools that can [[Obfuscated code|obfuscate]] the code, and do it so that the code cannot be easily readable but still be runnable.\n\n==Execution==\n\n===Just-in-time compilation===\n[[Just-in-time compilation]] (JIT) involves turning the byte-code into code immediately executable by the CPU. The conversion is performed gradually during the program's execution. JIT compilation provides environment-specific optimization, runtime type safety, and assembly verification. To accomplish this, the JIT compiler examines the assembly metadata for any illegal accesses and handles violations appropriately.\n\n===Ahead-of-time compilation===\n[[Common Language Infrastructure|CLI]]-compatible execution environments also come with the option to do an [[Ahead-of-time compilation]] (AOT) of an assembly to make it execute faster by removing the JIT process at runtime.\n\nIn the [[.NET Framework]] there is a special tool called the [[Native Image Generator]] (NGEN) that performs the AOT. A different approach for AOT is [[CoreRT]] that allows the compilation of .Net Core code to a single executable with no dependency on a runtime. In [[Mono (programming)|Mono]] there is also an option to do an AOT.\n\n==Pointer instructions - C++/CLI==\nA notable difference from Java's bytecode is that CIL comes with ldind, stind, ldloca, and many call instructions which are enough for data/function pointers manipulation needed to compile C/C++ code into CIL.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\nclass A {\n   public: virtual void __stdcall meth() {}\n};\nvoid test_pointer_operations(int param) {\n\tint k = 0;\n\tint * ptr = &k;\n\t*ptr = 1;\n\tptr = &param;\n\t*ptr = 2;\n\tA a;\n\tA * ptra = &a;\n\tptra->meth();\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe corresponding code in CIL can be rendered as this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\n.method assembly static void modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallConvCdecl) \n        test_pointer_operations(int32 param) cil managed\n{\n  .vtentry 1 : 1\n  // Code size       44 (0x2c)\n  .maxstack  2\n  .locals ([0] int32* ptr,\n           [1] valuetype A* V_1,\n           [2] valuetype A* a,\n           [3] int32 k)\n// k = 0;\n  IL_0000:  ldc.i4.0 \n  IL_0001:  stloc.3\n// ptr = &k;\n  IL_0002:  ldloca.s   k // load local's address instruction\n  IL_0004:  stloc.0\n// *ptr = 1;\n  IL_0005:  ldloc.0\n  IL_0006:  ldc.i4.1\n  IL_0007:  stind.i4 // indirection instruction\n// ptr = &param\n  IL_0008:  ldarga.s   param // load parameter's address instruction\n  IL_000a:  stloc.0\n// *ptr = 2\n  IL_000b:  ldloc.0\n  IL_000c:  ldc.i4.2\n  IL_000d:  stind.i4\n// a = new A;\n  IL_000e:  ldloca.s   a\n  IL_0010:  call       valuetype A* modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallConvThiscall) 'A.{ctor}'(valuetype A* modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IsConst) modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IsConst))\n  IL_0015:  pop\n// ptra = &a;\n  IL_0016:  ldloca.s   a\n  IL_0018:  stloc.1\n// ptra->meth();\n  IL_0019:  ldloc.1\n  IL_001a:  dup\n  IL_001b:  ldind.i4 // reading the VMT for virtual call\n  IL_001c:  ldind.i4\n  IL_001d:  calli      unmanaged stdcall void modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallConvStdcall)(native int)\n  IL_0022:  ret\n} // end of method 'Global Functions'::test_pointer_operations\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of CIL instructions]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm Common Language Infrastructure (Standard ECMA-335)]\n*[https://www.visualstudio.com/license-terms/ecma-c-common-language-infrastructure-standards/ \u201cECMA C# and Common Language Infrastructure Standards\u201d on the Visual Studio website]\n*[[wikibooks:Computer Programming/Hello world#CIL|Hello world program in CIL]]\n*[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163808.aspx Speed: NGen Revs Up Your Performance With Powerful New Features -- MSDN Magazine, April 2005]\n\n{{Common Language Infrastructure}}\n\n[[Category:Assembly languages]]\n[[Category:Common Language Infrastructure]]\n", "name_user": "Rickylqhan", "label": "safe", "comment": "Add link to Common Language Infrastructure languages", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language"}

After showing some hitting potential with a .269 [[batting average (baseball)|average]] in his rookie season with Toronto, the Dodgers were enthusiastic to trade for him.\n\n===Los Angeles Dodgers===\nIzturis was designated as the everyday starting shortstop from Opening Day of the [[2002 Major League Baseball season|2002 season]], and he quickly established himself in the Dodgers' infield. But he showed no patience at the plate, resulting in a decline in average and very few [[Base on balls|walks]]. After two years of barely adequate hitting (though compensated by his stellar glovework), he improved markedly in 2004, when he hit .288 with 62 [[Run batted in|RBI]] and 25 [[stolen base]]s in 159 games. At the end of the season, he earned his first [[Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]], the first by a Dodger shortstop since [[Maury Wills]]' back-to-back honors in [[1961 Major League Baseball season|1961]] and [[1962 Major League Baseball season|1962]].\n\nIn [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005]], Izturis hit .348 through June 1 and led the entire majors in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]]. He was selected for the [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|National League All-Star]] team, but his batting average later dipped all the way down into the .250 range. Curiously, his defense also seemed to suffer. After two trips to the [[disabled list]], Izturis underwent [[Tommy John surgery]] in his right elbow, and returned in mid-June, 2006.\n\nWith the uncertainty around Izturis, the Dodgers acquired shortstop [[Rafael Furcal]] in the off-season. That move seemed to have put Izturis' future with the Dodgers in doubt. With a $13 million annual salary, Furcal did not seem a likely candidate to be benched.\n\n===Chicago Cubs/Pittsburgh Pirates/St. Louis Cardinals===\nAt the 2006 trade deadline, Izturis was traded to the [[Chicago Cubs]] for [[Greg Maddux]] and cash considerations.\n\nOn July 19, 2007, Izturis and cash were traded to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] for a player to be named later.\n\nOn November 16, 2007, the Pirates declined an option on Izturis, and he became a free agent. Shortly thereafter on November 30, 2007, Izturis signed a one-year, $2.85 million deal with the St. Louis Cardinals.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/cardinals/story/EAC9E2342BE58705862573A400164658?OpenDocument|title = Izturis deal nudges out Eckstein|accessdate = December 1, 2007|last = Strauss|first = Joe|date = December 1, 2007|publisher = St. Louis Post-Dispatch|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071202040229/http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/cardinals/story/EAC9E2342BE58705862573A400164658?OpenDocument|archivedate = December 2, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Baltimore Orioles===\nOn December 16, 2008, Izturis signed a two-year deal with the [[Baltimore Orioles]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20081216&content_id=3718637&vkey=pr_bal&fext=.jsp&c_id=bal|title=Orioles sign shortstop Izturis|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2009 Major League Baseball season|2009]], he led all starting shortstops in [[range factor]], at 4.89.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/fielding/_/position/ss/sort/rangeFactor/order/true \"MLB Player Fielding Stats \u2013 As ss \u2013 2009\"] ''ESPN'', accessed October 6, 2009</ref>\n\nOn December 10, 2010, Izturis re-signed with the [[Baltimore Orioles]] to a 1-year contract.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/10/AR2010121005051.html|title=Orioles, SS Izturis agree to $1.5M, 1-year deal|last=Ginsburg|first=David|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=10 December 2010|accessdate=2010-12-11}}</ref>\n\n===Milwaukee Brewers===\nOn December 21, 2011 he signed a minor league contract with the [[Milwaukee Brewers]].

After showing some hitting potential with a .269 [[batting average (baseball)|average]] in his rookie season with Toronto, the Dodgers were enthusiastic to trade for him.\n\n===Los Angeles Dodgers===\nIzturis was designated as the everyday starting shortstop from Opening Day of the [[2002 Major League Baseball season|2002 season]], and he quickly established himself in the Dodgers' infield. But he showed no patience at the plate, resulting in a decline in average and very few [[Base on balls|walks]]. After two years of barely adequate hitting (though compensated by his stellar glovework), he improved markedly in 2004, when he hit .288 with 62 [[Run batted in|RBI]] and 25 [[stolen base]]s in 159 games. At the end of the season, he earned his first [[Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]], the first by a Dodger shortstop since [[Maury Wills]]' back-to-back honors in [[1961 Major League Baseball season|1961]] and [[1962 Major League Baseball season|1962]].\n\nIn [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005]], Izturis hit .348 through June 1 and led the entire majors in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]]. He was selected for the [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|National League All-Star]] team, but his batting average later dipped all the way down into the .250 range. Curiously, his defense also seemed to suffer. After two trips to the [[disabled list]], Izturis underwent [[Tommy John surgery]] in his right elbow, and returned in mid-June, 2006.\n\nWith the uncertainty around Izturis, the Dodgers acquired shortstop [[Rafael Furcal]] in the off-season. That move seemed to have put Izturis' future with the Dodgers in doubt. With a $13 million annual salary, Furcal did not seem a likely candidate to be benched.\n\n===Chicago Cubs/Pittsburgh Pirates/St. Louis Cardinals===\nAt the 2006 trade deadline, Izturis was traded to the [[Chicago Cubs]] for [[Greg Maddux]] and cash considerations.\n\nOn July 19, 2007, Izturis and cash were traded to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] for a player to be named later.\n\nOn November 16, 2007, the Pirates declined an option on Izturis, and he became a free agent. Shortly thereafter on November 30, 2007, Izturis signed a one-year, $2.85 million deal with the St. Louis Cardinals.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/cardinals/story/EAC9E2342BE58705862573A400164658?OpenDocument|title = Izturis deal nudges out Eckstein|accessdate = December 1, 2007|last = Strauss|first = Joe|date = December 1, 2007|publisher = St. Louis Post-Dispatch|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071202040229/http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/cardinals/story/EAC9E2342BE58705862573A400164658?OpenDocument|archivedate = December 2, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Baltimore Orioles===\nOn December 16, 2008, Izturis signed a two-year deal with the [[Baltimore Orioles]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20081216&content_id=3718637&vkey=pr_bal&fext=.jsp&c_id=bal|title=Orioles sign shortstop Izturis|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2009 Major League Baseball season|2009]], he led all starting shortstops in [[range factor]], at 4.89.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/fielding/_/position/ss/sort/rangeFactor/order/true \"MLB Player Fielding Stats \u2013 As ss \u2013 2009\"] ''ESPN'', accessed October 6, 2009</ref>\n\nOn December 10, 2010, Izturis re-signed with the [[Baltimore Orioles]] to a 1-year contract.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/10/AR2010121005051.html|title=Orioles, SS Izturis agree to $1.5M, 1-year deal|last=Ginsburg|first=David|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=10 December 2010|accessdate=2010-12-11}}</ref>\n\n===Milwaukee Brewers===\nOn December 21, 2011 he signed a minor league contract with the [[Milwaukee Brewers]].

He reached the Majors towards the end of the [[1997 Major League Baseball season|1997 season]], joining a struggling Oakland Athletics club. Though he only hit .202 in 26 games that year, the A's saw potential in the 23-year-old Tejada. This was bolstered by his performance with the [[Edmonton Trappers]] (AAA) in the [[Pacific Coast League]] during the season, and returning to the minors to lead the Trappers to a PCL championship that year. He was rewarded with the starting shortstop job beginning in [[1998 Major League Baseball season|1998]].\n\nThe A's, and Tejada, steadily improved over the next two years. His hitting improved as he gained more discipline at the plate. In 1998, he hit .233 with 11 [[home run]]s and in [[1999 Major League Baseball season|1999]] his average jumped to .251 with 21 home runs.\n\nAfter a solid 87-win campaign in 1999, Tejada and a core of young players led their A's to their first [[American League Western Division]] title in eight years in [[2000 Major League Baseball season|2000]]. Bolstered by an [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|American League MVP]]-winning performance by [[first baseman]] [[Jason Giambi]], and aided by Tejada's .275 average and 30 home runs, the A's won 91 games. The [[2000 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] faced the [[2000 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] in the [[2000 American League Division Series|first round of the postseason]], which was won by the Yankees 3-2.\n\nIn [[2001 Major League Baseball season|2001]], Tejada had a comparable offensive year, hitting .267 with 31 homers. The [[2001 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] captured the American League [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] with a 102-60 record. In the [[2001 American League Division Series|postseason]], however, the A's fell to the [[2001 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] in five games, blowing an initial 2-0 series lead.\n\n====2002====\nTejada's breakout year came in [[2002 Major League Baseball season|2002]]. With the departure of Jason Giambi to the [[New York Yankees]] during the offseason, and a leg injury to slugger [[Jermaine Dye]], the A's lost two of their key offensive players. Tejada hit .308 with 34 homers and led the [[2002 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] to their second Western Division title in three years. Their campaign included an American League record 20 game winning-streak. Tejada contributed one-out, game-winning hits in the 18th and 19th games of that run: a three-run homer off [[Minnesota Twins]] closer [[Eddie Guardado]] for a 7-5 victory and a bases-loaded single against [[2002 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] reliever [[Jason Grimsley]] to break a 6-6 tie. Tejada also showed modest speed on the basepaths with 18 steals over a two-year stretch. His performance was rewarded with the 2002 American League MVP award. For the third straight year, though, the A's fell in the fifth game of the [[2002 American League Division Series|ALDS]], this time to the [[2002 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]].\n\n====2003====\nThe [[2003 Major League Baseball season|next year]], both the [[2003 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] and Tejada got off to a slow start, with the shortstop hitting under [[Mendoza line|.200]] for the first month of the season. Improved play in the second half of the season led the A's to their second straight Western Division title and their third in four years. Tejada hit .278 with 27 homers for the year, a decrease from his numbers in 2002, but still leading many offensive categories for shortstops.\n\n[[File:M Tejada - Orioles v Yanks 2007-07-29.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Tejada during his first tenure with the [[2007 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles in 2007]]]]\nIn a [[2003 American League Division Series|tension-filled series]], the powerful offense of the [[2003 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] narrowly edged out the A's in the first round, once again in five games. Tejada was known for his public display of anger toward Boston starting pitcher [[Derek Lowe]] at the series' conclusion for what he perceived as obscene gestures. Lowe denied the accusation, claiming his fist pump was in celebration only.<ref>{{cite web|last=Christensen|first2=Roch|last2=Kubatko|first=Joe|title=Tejada, Lowe say ALDS feud is in past|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-04-07/sports/0404070346_1_mazzilli-tejada-derek-lowe|publisher=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=May 18, 2014|date=April 7, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=AL: A's irate about Lowe's gesture|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/10/07/Sports/AL__A_s_irate_about_L.shtml|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=May 18, 2014|date=October 7, 2003}}</ref>\n\n===Baltimore Orioles (2004\u20132007)===\nBy the end of the 2003 season, Tejada had established himself as one of baseball's premier shortstops. The A's elected not to re-sign the free agent, citing budget concerns and a young [[Bobby Crosby]] coming through the system, so Tejada signed a six-year, $72 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles during the offseason.\n\nOn arrival in Baltimore, Tejada was given uniform number 10, since 4, his number in Oakland, had been retired for former manager [[Earl Weaver]]. As an Oriole, Tejada followed in the footsteps of legendary Baltimore shortstop [[Cal Ripken Jr.]]. Like Ripken, Tejada was a strong and durable shortstop with unusual power numbers for a middle infielder.\n\n====2004\u20132005====\nOn July 12, 2004, Tejada won the [[Century 21 Real Estate|Century 21]] [[Home Run Derby]] in [[Houston]]. Tejada hit a (then) record 27 [[home run]]s in the contest, including a record 15 homers in the second round. He defeated [[Houston Astros]] outfielder [[Lance Berkman]] (who would later become his teammate) 5-4 in the final round of the contest.<ref>{{cite web |last=Antonen |first=Mel |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/allstar/2004-07-12-homerun-derby_x.htm |title=Tejada blasts way to victory in Derby |work=USA Today |date=July 12, 2004 |accessdate=April 9, 2016}}</ref> Both records were broken the following year in [[Detroit]] by [[Bobby Abreu]]. Tejada finished the 2004 season with 34 home runs and an MLB-leading 150 RBIs, and won his first career [[Silver Slugger Award]].\n\nWhile Tejada did not participate in the Home Run Derby in 2005, he was an [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] and starter for the [[American League|AL]]. In his first All-Star start, Tejada hit a solo [[home run]] against [[John Smoltz]] of the [[Atlanta Braves]], had a sacrifice RBI and was part of an all-Oriole double play with teammate [[Brian Roberts (baseball)|Brian Roberts]]. His efforts earned him the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star MVP]], winning a [[Chevrolet Corvette]].\n\n====2005\u20132006 offseason====\nOn December 8, 2005, it was widely reported by the [[Associated Press]] that Tejada asked the Orioles for a trade, citing unhappiness with the team's direction. Tejada challenged those statements in an interview with [[Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic|Comcast Sportsnet's]] Kelli Johnson, saying he only asked for a better team, referring to his hope that the Baltimore Orioles would improve after their eighth straight losing season.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nSeveral weeks later, Tejada reiterated his complaints with the Orioles' lack of action and demanded to be traded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Tejada stated that he wants a \"good group that helps me to win\" and commented briefly on his alleged non-involvement in Palmeiro's steroid scandal.  On January 7, 2006, Tejada stated his intent to remain with Baltimore for \"the rest of [his] career.\"{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} This statement was made to Orioles Vice President [[Jim Duquette]] in a meeting arranged by mutual friend and teammate [[Melvin Mora]]. It was reported that Tejada was claimed by the [[Chicago White Sox]] off trade waivers, but the two teams did not make a deal for Tejada.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n====2006\u20132007====\nTejada played in his 1,000th [[Major League Baseball consecutive games played streaks|consecutive game]] on July 1, 2006.\n\nTejada's streak was at 1,151 games when he was hit on his left wrist by a pitch on June 20, 2007. The next day, he went up to bunt in the top of the first inning, bunted into a force play, and was replaced by a pinch runner. Following that game, it was announced that he had a broken wrist. On June 22 he was placed on the disabled list, ending his streak at 1,152 consecutive games, the fifth longest in Major League history, behind [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] (2,632), [[Lou Gehrig]] (2,130), [[Everett Scott]] (1,307), and [[Steve Garvey]] (1,217).<ref>{{cite news |first=Spencer |last=Fordin |title=Streak over: Tejada placed on DL |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070622&content_id=2042946&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |publisher=[[MLB.com]]|date=June 22, 2007 |accessdate=July 28, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Miguel Tejada 2008.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Tejada playing for the [[2008 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros in 2008]]]]\n\n===Houston Astros (2008\u20132009)===\nOn December 12, 2007, Tejada was dealt to the [[Houston Astros]] for five players, including SP [[Troy Patton]], OF [[Luke Scott]], RP [[Dennis Sarfate]] and RP/SP [[Matt Albers]].<ref>{{cite news|author = |title = Tejada traded to Astros, Orioles to receive five players for former AL MVP|url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/baseball/mlb/12/12/tejada.trade.ap/index.html|work=[[SI.com]]|date = December 12, 2007|accessdate = December 12, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071214160439/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/baseball/mlb/12/12/tejada.trade.ap/index.html |archivedate = December 14, 2007}}</ref>\n\nTejada scored his 1,000th career run on July 7, 2008, at [[PNC Park]].

Tejada previously claimed to have been born in 1976, so 1974 is correct. Please do not change it to 1972 -->) is a Dominican former professional [[baseball]] [[shortstop]] who played 16 seasons in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). He played for six different teams, most notably the [[Oakland Athletics]] and [[Baltimore Orioles]], before short stints with the [[Houston Astros]], [[San Diego Padres]], [[San Francisco Giants]], and [[Kansas City Royals]].\n\nTejada spent his first six seasons in MLB with the Athletics, where he began a streak of 1,152 [[Major League Baseball consecutive games played streaks|consecutive game]]s that ended with the Orioles on June 22, 2007. He is a six-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] and a two-time [[Silver Slugger Award]] winner. In 2002, he won the [[American League]] [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award]], and was the [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2005]] [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star Game MVP]]. Tejada's nickname is \"La Guagua\", which means \"the bus\" in certain Spanish dialects, as Tejada was known for his ability to drive in runs.\n\nOn February 11, 2009, he pleaded guilty to one count of [[perjury]] for lying to [[United States Congress|Congress]] in his testimony on whether [[Rafael Palmeiro]] lied about his steroid use.<ref name=\"Schmidt\">{{cite news |first=Michael S. |last=Schmidt |title=The Tumult Continues: Tejada Pleads Guilty |curly= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/sports/baseball/12tejada.htm |agency= |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 11, 2009 |accessdate=February 12, 2009}}</ref> On August 17, 2013, MLB suspended Tejada for 105 games for violating MLB drug policy.

He grew up idolizing the Baltimore Orioles shortstop [[Cal Ripken Jr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3079-2004Feb24.html |title=Tejada Looks to Build on Ripken Legacy |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2004-02-24 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}</ref> \nTejada's rise from the slums of Ban\u00ed through the minors and into the Major Leagues is chronicled in the book ''Away Games: The Life and Times of a Latin Ballplayer'' by Marcos Breton and Jose Luis Villegas. ''Away Games'' describes the struggles of Dominican players in general and Tejada in particular as they arrive in the U.S. speaking very little English, often in small towns playing for minor league teams, with dreams of making it big.<ref>{{Cite book|title=page for Away Games |isbn = 978-0684849911|last1 = Bret\u00f3n|first1 = Marcos|last2= Villegas|first2= Jos\u00e9 Luis|year=1999 }}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Oakland Athletics (1997\u20132003)===\n\n====1997\u20132001====\nTejada developed quickly into a top-notch prospect, showing early signs of power. He reached the Majors towards the end of the [[1997 Major League Baseball season|1997 season]], joining a struggling Oakland Athletics club. Though he only hit .202 in 26 games that year, the A's saw potential in the 23-year-old Tejada. This was bolstered by his performance with the [[Edmonton Trappers]] (AAA) in the [[Pacific Coast League]] during the season, and returning to the minors to lead the Trappers to a PCL championship that year. He was rewarded with the starting shortstop job beginning in [[1998 Major League Baseball season|1998]].\n\nThe A's, and Tejada, steadily improved over the next two years. His hitting improved as he gained more discipline at the plate. In 1998, he hit .233 with 11 [[home run]]s and in [[1999 Major League Baseball season|1999]] his average jumped to .251 with 21 home runs.\n\nAfter a solid 87-win campaign in 1999, Tejada and a core of young players led their A's to their first [[American League Western Division]] title in eight years in [[2000 Major League Baseball season|2000]]. Bolstered by an [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|American League MVP]]-winning performance by [[first baseman]] [[Jason Giambi]], and aided by Tejada's .275 average and 30 home runs, the A's won 91 games. The [[2000 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] faced the [[2000 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] in the [[2000 American League Division Series|first round of the postseason]], which was won by the Yankees 3-2.\n\nIn [[2001 Major League Baseball season|2001]], Tejada had a comparable offensive year, hitting .267 with 31 homers. The [[2001 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] captured the American League [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] with a 102-60 record. In the [[2001 American League Division Series|postseason]], however, the A's fell to the [[2001 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] in five games, blowing an initial 2-0 series lead.\n\n====2002====\nTejada's breakout year came in [[2002 Major League Baseball season|2002]]. With the departure of Jason Giambi to the [[New York Yankees]] during the offseason, and a leg injury to slugger [[Jermaine Dye]], the A's lost two of their key offensive players. Tejada hit .308 with 34 homers and led the [[2002 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] to their second Western Division title in three years. Their campaign included an American League record 20 game winning-streak. Tejada contributed one-out, game-winning hits in the 18th and 19th games of that run: a three-run homer off [[Minnesota Twins]] closer [[Eddie Guardado]] for a 7-5 victory and a bases-loaded single against [[2002 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] reliever [[Jason Grimsley]] to break a 6-6 tie. Tejada also showed modest speed on the basepaths with 18 steals over a two-year stretch. His performance was rewarded with the 2002 American League MVP award. For the third straight year, though, the A's fell in the fifth game of the [[2002 American League Division Series|ALDS]], this time to the [[2002 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]].\n\n====2003====\nThe [[2003 Major League Baseball season|next year]], both the [[2003 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] and Tejada got off to a slow start, with the shortstop hitting under [[Mendoza line|.200]] for the first month of the season. Improved play in the second half of the season led the A's to their second straight Western Division title and their third in four years. Tejada hit .278 with 27 homers for the year, a decrease from his numbers in 2002, but still leading many offensive categories for shortstops.\n\n[[File:M Tejada - Orioles v Yanks 2007-07-29.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Tejada during his first tenure with the [[2007 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles in 2007]]]]\nIn a [[2003 American League Division Series|tension-filled series]], the powerful offense of the [[2003 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] narrowly edged out the A's in the first round, once again in five games. Tejada was known for his public display of anger toward Boston starting pitcher [[Derek Lowe]] at the series' conclusion for what he perceived as obscene gestures. Lowe denied the accusation, claiming his fist pump was in celebration only.<ref>{{cite web|last=Christensen|first2=Roch|last2=Kubatko|first=Joe|title=Tejada, Lowe say ALDS feud is in past|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-04-07/sports/0404070346_1_mazzilli-tejada-derek-lowe|publisher=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=May 18, 2014|date=April 7, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=AL: A's irate about Lowe's gesture|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/10/07/Sports/AL__A_s_irate_about_L.shtml|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=May 18, 2014|date=October 7, 2003}}</ref>\n\n===Baltimore Orioles (2004\u20132007)===\nBy the end of the 2003 season, Tejada had established himself as one of baseball's premier shortstops. The A's elected not to re-sign the free agent, citing budget concerns and a young [[Bobby Crosby]] coming through the system, so Tejada signed a six-year, $72 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles during the offseason.\n\nOn arrival in Baltimore, Tejada was given uniform number 10, since 4, his number in Oakland, had been retired for former manager [[Earl Weaver]]. As an Oriole, Tejada followed in the footsteps of legendary Baltimore shortstop [[Cal Ripken Jr.]]. Like Ripken, Tejada was a strong and durable shortstop with unusual power numbers for a middle infielder.\n\n====2004\u20132005====\nOn July 12, 2004, Tejada won the [[Century 21 Real Estate|Century 21]] [[Home Run Derby]] in [[Houston]]. Tejada hit a (then) record 27 [[home run]]s in the contest, including a record 15 homers in the second round. He defeated [[Houston Astros]] outfielder [[Lance Berkman]] (who would later become his teammate) 5-4 in the final round of the contest.<ref>{{cite web |last=Antonen |first=Mel |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/allstar/2004-07-12-homerun-derby_x.htm |title=Tejada blasts way to victory in Derby |work=USA Today |date=July 12, 2004 |accessdate=April 9, 2016}}</ref> Both records were broken the following year in [[Detroit]] by [[Bobby Abreu]]. Tejada finished the 2004 season with 34 home runs and an MLB-leading 150 RBIs, and won his first career [[Silver Slugger Award]].\n\nWhile Tejada did not participate in the Home Run Derby in 2005, he was an [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] and starter for the [[American League|AL]]. In his first All-Star start, Tejada hit a solo [[home run]] against [[John Smoltz]] of the [[Atlanta Braves]], had a sacrifice RBI and was part of an all-Oriole double play with teammate [[Brian Roberts (baseball)|Brian Roberts]]. His efforts earned him the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star MVP]], winning a [[Chevrolet Corvette]].\n\n====2005\u20132006 offseason====\nOn December 8, 2005, it was widely reported by the [[Associated Press]] that Tejada asked the Orioles for a trade, citing unhappiness with the team's direction. Tejada challenged those statements in an interview with [[Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic|Comcast Sportsnet's]] Kelli Johnson, saying he only asked for a better team, referring to his hope that the Baltimore Orioles would improve after their eighth straight losing season.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nSeveral weeks later, Tejada reiterated his complaints with the Orioles' lack of action and demanded to be traded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Tejada stated that he wants a \"good group that helps me to win\" and commented briefly on his alleged non-involvement in Palmeiro's steroid scandal.  On January 7, 2006, Tejada stated his intent to remain with Baltimore for \"the rest of [his] career.\"{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} This statement was made to Orioles Vice President [[Jim Duquette]] in a meeting arranged by mutual friend and teammate [[Melvin Mora]]. It was reported that Tejada was claimed by the [[Chicago White Sox]] off trade waivers, but the two teams did not make a deal for Tejada.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n====2006\u20132007====\nTejada played in his 1,000th [[Major League Baseball consecutive games played streaks|consecutive game]] on July 1, 2006.\n\nTejada's streak was at 1,151 games when he was hit on his left wrist by a pitch on June 20, 2007. The next day, he went up to bunt in the top of the first inning, bunted into a force play, and was replaced by a pinch runner. Following that game, it was announced that he had a broken wrist. On June 22 he was placed on the disabled list, ending his streak at 1,152 consecutive games, the fifth longest in Major League history, behind [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] (2,632), [[Lou Gehrig]] (2,130), [[Everett Scott]] (1,307), and [[Steve Garvey]] (1,217).<ref>{{cite news |first=Spencer |last=Fordin |title=Streak over: Tejada placed on DL |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070622&content_id=2042946&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |publisher=[[MLB.com]]|date=June 22, 2007 |accessdate=July 28, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Miguel Tejada 2008.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Tejada playing for the [[2008 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros in 2008]]]]\n\n===Houston Astros (2008\u20132009)===\nOn December 12, 2007, Tejada was dealt to the [[Houston Astros]] for five players, including SP [[Troy Patton]], OF [[Luke Scott]], RP [[Dennis Sarfate]] and RP/SP [[Matt Albers]].<ref>{{cite news|author = |title = Tejada traded to Astros, Orioles to receive five players for former AL MVP|url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/baseball/mlb/12/12/tejada.trade.ap/index.html|work=[[SI.com]]|date = December 12, 2007|accessdate = December 12, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071214160439/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/baseball/mlb/12/12/tejada.trade.ap/index.html |archivedate = December 14, 2007}}</ref>\n\nTejada scored his 1,000th career run on July 7, 2008, at [[PNC Park]].

He played for the [[New York Mets]], [[Baltimore Orioles]], [[Colorado Rockies]] and [[Arizona Diamondbacks]].\n\nFrom his debut in 1999 to 2003, Melvin Mora was known as a [[utility player]], playing all three outfield positions, shortstop, and second base. In 2004, the Orioles made Mora their everyday third baseman, a position he occupied through 2009.\n\n==Career==\n\n===New York Mets===\nMora was signed out of Venezuela in 1991. After spending seven years in the [[Houston Astros|Astros]] [[Minor League Baseball|minors]] system and couple of months in [[CPBL]]'s [[Mercuries Tigers]], he signed as a [[free agent]] with the [[New York Mets|Mets]] in [[1998 Major League Baseball season|1998]] and made his major league debut in the [[1999 Major League Baseball season|1999 season]]. Mora made himself more valuable by being able to play all three [[outfield]] positions, [[shortstop]], [[second base]] and [[third base|third]].\n\n[[File:Melvin Mora (1999) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Mora with the [[New York Mets]] in 1999]]\nIn 1999, he scored the winning run of the final game of the year for the Mets on a wild pitch by the Pirates' [[Brad Clontz]], which propelled the [[1999 New York Mets season|Mets]] to a one-game playoff with [[1999 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]], which they won.\n\n===Baltimore Orioles===\n\n====2000&ndash;02====\nMelvin Mora was traded by the Mets to Baltimore on July 28, 2000, with two minor league players and [[Mike Kinkade]] for shortstop [[Mike Bordick]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/M/Pmoram002.htm|title=Melvin Mora|accessdate=2009-06-23 |publisher=[[Retrosheet]]}}</ref>\n\nUsed as a utility player in Baltimore, Mora showed promise and hints of ability to contribute as an everyday player but struggled to break through. Things changed when an injury-depleted Orioles team used Mora almost exclusively in left field, and Mora responded with the best stretch of his career. He reached base in 32 straight games while using a 23-game hitting streak to temporarily become the [[American League]] batting leader. Finally excelling as a hitter, Mora was chosen for his first [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] selection. Mora's season was cut short due to injuries (a bruised wrist and a partially torn ligament in his left knee), but finished with a .317 batting average, 15 home runs, and a .418 [[on-base percentage]] in 96 games.\n\n====2003&ndash;04====\nMora's 2003 season proved that he could be a consistent hitter at the major league level. In 2004, Mora became the Orioles' regular third baseman and enjoyed his most productive season in the majors. Mora hit a career-high .340, finishing second in the [[American League|AL]] batting race to [[Ichiro Suzuki]]'s .372 mark; led the league in on-base percentage (.419); ranked 5th in [[slugging average]] (.562) and [[On-base plus slugging|OPS]] (.981); 6th in [[Run (baseball)|runs]] (111), [[Double (baseball)|doubles]] (41) and [[times on base]] (264); 8th in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] (187), and 9th in [[total bases]] (264).

He played for the [[New York Mets]], [[Baltimore Orioles]], [[Colorado Rockies]] and [[Arizona Diamondbacks]].\n \nFrom his debut in 1999 to 2003, Melvin Mora was known as a [[utility player]], playing all three outfield positions, shortstop, and second base. In 2004, the Orioles made Mora their everyday third baseman, a position he occupied through 2009.\n\n==Career==\n\n===New York Mets===\nMora was signed out of Venezuela in 1991. After spending seven years in the [[Houston Astros|Astros]] [[Minor League Baseball|minors]] system and couple of months in [[CPBL]]'s [[Mercuries Tigers]], he signed as a [[free agent]] with the [[New York Mets|Mets]] in [[1998 Major League Baseball season|1998]] and made his major league debut in the [[1999 Major League Baseball season|1999 season]]. Mora made himself more valuable by being able to play all three [[outfield]] positions, [[shortstop]], [[second base]] and [[third base|third]].\n\n[[File:Melvin Mora (1999) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Mora with the [[New York Mets]] in 1999]]\nIn 1999, he scored the winning run of the final game of the year for the Mets on a wild pitch by the Pirates' [[Brad Clontz]], which propelled the [[1999 New York Mets season|Mets]] to a one-game playoff with [[1999 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]], which they won.\n\n===Baltimore Orioles===\n\n====2000&ndash;02====\nMelvin Mora was traded by the Mets to Baltimore on July 28, 2000, with two minor league players and [[Mike Kinkade]] for shortstop [[Mike Bordick]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/M/Pmoram002.htm|title=Melvin Mora|accessdate=2009-06-23 |publisher=[[Retrosheet]]}}</ref>\n\nUsed as a utility player in Baltimore, Mora showed promise and hints of ability to contribute as an everyday player but struggled to break through. Things changed when an injury-depleted Orioles team used Mora almost exclusively in left field, and Mora responded with the best stretch of his career. He reached base in 32 straight games while using a 23-game hitting streak to temporarily become the [[American League]] batting leader. Finally excelling as a hitter, Mora was chosen for his first [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] selection. Mora's season was cut short due to injuries (a bruised wrist and a partially torn ligament in his left knee), but finished with a .317 batting average, 15 home runs, and a .418 [[on-base percentage]] in 96 games.\n\n====2003&ndash;04====\nMora's 2003 season proved that he could be a consistent hitter at the major league level. In 2004, Mora became the Orioles' regular third baseman and enjoyed his most productive season in the majors. Mora hit a career-high .340, finishing second in the [[American League|AL]] batting race to [[Ichiro Suzuki]]'s .372 mark; led the league in on-base percentage (.419); ranked 5th in [[slugging average]] (.562) and [[On-base plus slugging|OPS]] (.981); 6th in [[Run (baseball)|runs]] (111), [[Double (baseball)|doubles]] (41) and [[times on base]] (264); 8th in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] (187), and 9th in [[total bases]] (264). His 27 home runs and 104 RBI were also career-highs, while leading his team in batting average, runs, on-base percentage, slugging average and OPS. At third base, he improved and became more consistent as the season wore on. Mora finished 18th in [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|American League MVP]] voting and won a [[Silver Slugger Award]].\n\n====2005&ndash;07====\n[[File:Melvin Mora Baltimore Orioles.jpg|thumb|Melvin Mora, during a break in the action, playing for Baltimore Orioles in 2006.]]\nIn 2005, Mora once again hit 27 home runs, although his [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] and on-base percentage dropped.
