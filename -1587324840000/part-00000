It is a side-scrolling [[beat 'em up]] based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[X-Men|characters of the same name]]. The character designs of the [[X-Men]] and the supervillains in the game are based on the [[1989 in television|1989]] X-Men [[Television pilot|pilot]] episode ''[[X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men]]''. In the game, players control one of the six playable X-Men to defeat their enemy [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]. Konami made a six-player version of the game utilizing two screens housed in a deluxe [[arcade cabinet|cabinet]].\n\nAn HD port of the game by [[Backbone Entertainment]] was released by Konami on [[PlayStation Network]] and [[Xbox Live Arcade]] on December 14, 2010 and December 15, 2010 respectively, followed by mobile versions for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices. It is no longer available for purchase as of 2013.\n\n==Plot==\nThe player chooses one of six X-Men: [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] or [[Dazzler (comics)|Dazzler]]. Their objective is to stop the villain [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] from wreaking havoc on human civilization. They must fight through enemies from the comics such as an army of hundreds of [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]], mutant crocodiles, [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] and supervillains such as [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]], [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]], [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]], [[Emma Frost|The White Queen]], [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. Later, [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] kidnaps [[Professor X]] and [[Kitty Pryde]], prompting the heroes to go on a rescue mission. The heroes fight their way to Island M and ultimately to Magneto's base on [[Asteroid M]] where the final battle takes place.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe object of the game is to progress as far as possible while surviving attacks from Magneto and his minions.  The character is controlled with a standard joystick, an attack button, a jump button, and a mutant power button. In addition to right and left, the character can move up and down the screen as well which adds a three-dimensional feel to the game. Every character is able to fight with punches, kicks, or other close combat attacks.  Each character also has a unique mutant power which can be used to defeat multiple enemies on the screen at once. The use of a mutant power is very effective, but also costly since it causes a character to lose three health points. Normally, a character who drops below four health can no longer use any mutant powers, but it is also possible for characters to obtain bonus mutant powers which can be stored like items. In the Japanese version, the power items are used up before the health, and there are also power-ups and health packs throughout the levels.\n\n==Release==\nDepending on the machine, the maximum number of simultaneous players varies from two to six. The six-player version is particularly unusual because it has two contiguous screens (one screen in the usual place for an arcade game, the other in the cabinet below, reflected by a mirror one side of the screen) which created the effect of a single, \"double-wide\" screen set up, similar to ''[[Tecmo Bowl]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racketboy.com/gamerooms/2006/04/x-men-6-player-arcade-best-cabinet.html |title=X-Men 6-Player Arcade: The Best Cabinet EVER &#124; RetroGaming with Racketboy |publisher=Racketboy.com |date=2006-04-18 |accessdate=2012-05-25}}</ref>\n\nOn October 9, 2010 Konami revealed that the game would be coming to [[PlayStation Network]] and [[Xbox Live Arcade]]. The game was ported by [[Backbone Entertainment]] with the original US and Japanese [[Read-only memory|ROMs]] and was released on December 14, 2010 and December 15, 2010 respectively.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/10/09/the-x-men-return-to-the-arcade|title=The X-Men Return to the Arcade|last=George|first=Richard|date=October 9, 2010|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref>  The [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3|PS3]] port features drop-in local or online multiplayer for up to six players (only four local players possible on the XBLA version), as well as custom matchmaking and adjustable difficulty. Players can also choose between the US and Japanese versions of the game, the latter of which features power-ups and health packs. All of the voices were re-recorded by Bang Zoom Entertainment due to licensing reasons, but the script retained the [[Engrish|infamous lines]] from the original game, including \"I am Magneto, master of magnet!\" and \"Welcome to die!\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} In the re-recorded script, only two voice actors were used for male and female characters ([[Kyle Hebert]] and [[Mela Lee]], respectively).\n\nThe game was delisted from both digital stores at the end of 2013.\n\nOn June 2, 2011 Konami also released the game in the [[iTunes App Store]] to be played on [[iOS]] devices, as well as in the [[Android Market]]. The game remained largely identical to the original, with the addition of on-screen controls for smartphones.  In June 2014 the app was no longer available in the US iTunes App Store.\n\n==Reception==\n[[IGN]] gave the HD port of the game a score of 7.5, saying \"The game is incredibly simple and repetitive...

The six-player version is particularly unusual because it has two contiguous screens (one screen in the usual place for an arcade game, the other in the cabinet below, reflected by a mirror one side of the screen) which created the effect of a single, \"double-wide\" screen set up, similar to ''[[Tecmo Bowl]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racketboy.com/gamerooms/2006/04/x-men-6-player-arcade-best-cabinet.html |title=X-Men 6-Player Arcade: The Best Cabinet EVER &#124; RetroGaming with Racketboy |publisher=Racketboy.com |date=2006-04-18 |accessdate=2012-05-25}}</ref>\n\nOn October 9, 2010 Konami revealed that the game would be coming to [[PlayStation Network]] and [[Xbox Live Arcade]]. The game was ported by [[Backbone Entertainment]] with the original US and Japanese [[Read-only memory|ROMs]] and was released on December 14, 2010 and December 15, 2010 respectively.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/10/09/the-x-men-return-to-the-arcade|title=The X-Men Return to the Arcade|last=George|first=Richard|date=October 9, 2010|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref>  The [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3|PS3]] port features drop-in local or online multiplayer for up to six players (only four local players possible on the XBLA version), as well as custom matchmaking and adjustable difficulty. Players can also choose between the US and Japanese versions of the game, the latter of which features power-ups and health packs. All of the voices were re-recorded by Bang Zoom Entertainment due to licensing reasons, but the script retained the [[Engrish|infamous lines]] from the original game, including \"I am Magneto, master of magnet!\" and \"Welcome to die!\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} In the re-recorded script, only two voice actors were used for male and female characters ([[Kyle Hebert]] and [[Mela Lee]], respectively).\n\nThe game was delisted from both digital stores at the end of 2013.\n\nOn June 2, 2011 Konami also released the game in the [[iTunes App Store]] to be played on [[iOS]] devices, as well as in the [[Android Market]]. The game remained largely identical to the original, with the addition of on-screen controls for smartphones.  In June 2014 the app was no longer available in the US iTunes App Store.\n\n==Reception==\n[[IGN]] gave the HD port of the game a score of 7.5, saying \"The game is incredibly simple and repetitive... And yet it works. It's simply a blast to play with friends.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/114/1140753p1.html|title=X-Men Arcade Review - PlayStation 3 Review at IGN|author=George|first=Richard|date=December 16, 2010|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=Uk.ps3.ign.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2012-05-25}}</ref> Many websites and reviewers such as Gouki.com<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gouki.com/Story/Details/x-men-arcade-review|title=X-men Arcade Review!|last=Cinderkin|first=|date=December 16, 2010|website=|publisher=Gouki.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2012-05-25}}</ref> stated that having unlimited Continues without penalty for all modes has cheapened the classic experience, especially Online play.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{KLOV game|id=10496|name=X-Men}}\n<!--*[http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-47.html Gamespot - The Greatest Games of All-Time]\n*[http://comics.ign.com/articles/595/595982p1.html The Best and Worst Comic Book Video Games]-->\n\n{{X-Men media}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:X-Men (Arcade Game)}}\n[[Category:1992 video games]]\n[[Category:Arcade games]]\n[[Category:Video games based on X-Men]]\n[[Category:Konami beat 'em ups]]\n[[Category:IOS games]]\n[[Category:Cooperative video games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 3 games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Network games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Japan]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring female protagonists]]\n[[Category:Xbox 360 games]]\n[[Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games]]\n[[Category:Superhero video games]]\n", "name_user": "78.148.88.214", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(1992_video_game)"}
