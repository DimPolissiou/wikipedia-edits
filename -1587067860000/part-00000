Between 1976 and 1982 RAR activists organised national Carnivals and tours, as well as local gigs and clubs throughout the country. RAR brought together black and white fans in their common love of music, in order to discourage young people from embracing [[racism]]. The musicians came from all [[Pop music|pop]] music genres, something reflected in one of RAR's slogans: \"[[Reggae]], soul, rock'n'roll, jazz, funk and [[punk rock|punk]]\". The movement was founded, in part, as a response to racist statements by well-known rock musicians.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/04/race.otherparties|title=Blood and glory|first=Ed|last=Vulliamy|date=4 March 2007|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=16 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nOriginally conceived as a one-off concert with a message against racism, Rock Against Racism was founded in 1976 by [[Red Saunders (photographer)|Red Saunders]], Roger Huddle, Jo Wreford, Pete Bruno and others.

Who shot the Sheriff, Eric?

At the end of the gig the bands took part in a jam, something which was to become a signature of RAR's gigs at a time when it was still rare for black and white musicians to perform together. In the same year RAR launched its revolutionary [[fanzine]]'', Temporary Hoarding'', going on to produce 15 issues over the next five years. By 1977 local RAR groups were springing up all over the country, including in Leeds, Birmingham, Manchester, Hull, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast, Sheffield, Cardiff, Swansea, Bristol, and across London. Eventually there were more than 200 throughout the UK. Across the globe, several RAR groups started in the United States, in New York, San Francisco and Chicago, and also in Ireland, France, Belgium, Sweden, Holland, Germany, Norway, South Africa and Australia.{{cn|date=February 2020}} \n\nMusicians not only played for RAR, many took part in organising gigs and clubs. For instance, in Leeds, [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]], [[The Mekons]] and [[Delta 5]] were all actively involved in their local RAR group. As were [[Au Pairs]] and [[The Beat (British band)|The Beat]] in Birmingham, and [[Misty In Roots]] and [[The Ruts]] in Southall, London. [[Tom Robinson]], who was an early supporter of the movement, played several gigs with his band, [[Tom Robinson Band|TRB]], and came occasionally to meetings of the RAR Central Collective. The Collective \u2013 which included writers, graphic artists, photographers, musicians and fans \u2013 oversaw RAR's national events and comprised elected representatives: from ''Temporary Hoarding'' (Ruth Gregory, [[David Widgery]] and [[Syd Shelton]]); from RAR central office (Kate Webb, John Dennis and Wayne Minter), as well as Red Saunders and Clarence Baker from Misty in Roots. Other members who regularly participated in meetings included Lucy Whitman (who wrote for Temporary Hoarding as Lucy Toothpaste), Roger Huddle and Robert Galvin.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n== Carnivals Against Racism ==\nWith support for the movement growing, in 1978 RAR organised two national Carnivals in London in conjunction with the [[Anti-Nazi League|Anti-Nazi League (ANL)]] to counteract the rising number of racist attacks in the UK. These were held in poor but vibrant multi-racial areas. On 30 April 1978, 100,000 people marched six miles from [[Trafalgar Square]] to the [[East End of London]] (a National Front hotspot) for an open-air concert at [[Victoria Park, London|Victoria Park]] in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lmhrcarnival.com/RAR_carnival_background |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421084539/http://www.lmhrcarnival.com/RAR_carnival_background/ |archive-date=21 April 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tomrobinson.com/trb/rar.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401070230/http://www.tomrobinson.com/trb/rar.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 April 2009|title=TRB - Rock Against Racism|date=1 April 2009|accessdate=16 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Hazan-Rude_Boy\">{{cite video\n |people    = Hazan, Jack; David Mingay, Ray Gange, [[Joe Strummer]], [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]], [[Paul Simonon]], [[Topper Headon|Nicky Headon]], Buzzy Enterprises, Epic Music Video \n | date      = 2006\n | title     = Rude Boy\n | medium    = Documentary, Rockumentary\n | publisher = Epic Music Video\n | location  = New York, NY, United States\n | isbn      = 0-7389-0082-6\n | oclc      = 70850190\n | quote     = 2nd edition digitally restored and remastered sound.\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040505020926/http://www.virtual-festivals.com/artists/article.cfm?articleid=949 |title=Rock Against Racism |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2020-02-09}}</ref> The concert featured [[The Clash]],<ref name=\"Hazan-Rude_Boy\" /><ref name=\"Westway_to_the_World\">{{cite video \n | people    = [[Don Letts|Letts Don]]; [[Joe Strummer]], [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]], [[Paul Simonon]], [[Topper Headon]], [[Terry Chimes]], Rick Elgood, [[The Clash]]\n | date      = 2001 \n | title     = The Clash, [[Westway to the World]]\n | medium    = Documentary \n | publisher = [[Sony Music Entertainment]]; Dorismo; Uptown Films \n | location  = New York, NY \n | time      = 47:42 \n | isbn      = 0-7389-0082-6 \n | oclc      = 49798077 \n | quote     = \n}}</ref><ref name=\"Green-A_Riot_of_Our_Own\">{{cite book \n | last      = Green \n | first     = Johnny \n |author2=Garry Barker \n  | title     = A Riot of Our Own: Night and Day with The Clash \n | origyear  = 1997 \n | edition   = 3rd\n | year      = 2003 \n | publisher = Orion \n | location  = London \n | isbn      = 0-7528-5843-2 \n | oclc      = 52990890 \n | pages     = 63\u201368\n}}</ref> [[Steel Pulse]], [[Tom Robinson Band]], [[X-Ray Spex]], [[Sham 69|Jimmy Pursey (from Sham 69)]] and [[Patrik Fitzgerald]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Anti Nazi League/Rock Against Racism Rallies|url=http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/victoria-park-1978.html|website=UK Rock Festivals|accessdate=8 March 2016}}</ref> The [[Southall]]-based reggae band [[Misty In Roots]] led the parade from the back of a lorry.

There, over a couple of days, [[Buzzcocks]], [[Steel Pulse]], [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]], [[Graham Parker and the Rumour]], Exodus, and China Street all performed; a week later at the Deeply Vale Festival, a Rock Against Racism day was held. There were also large Carnivals that year in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Brent.{{cn|date=February 2020}} \n\nIn 1981, Leeds RAR organized the last RAR Carnival at Potternewton Park in Chapeltown. Bands who played included [[The Specials]], Aswad, Au Pairs and Misty in Roots.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n== Militant Entertainment ==\n{{unsourced|section|date=February 2020}}\nIn the run-up to the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|UK general election of 1979]], RAR organised the Militant Entertainment Tour which traveled 2000 miles across the country visiting [[Cambridge]], [[Leicester]], [[Cromer]], [[Coventry]], [[Sheffield]], [[Leeds]], [[Middlesbrough]], [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Stirling]], [[Aberdeen]], [[Bradford]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], [[Birmingham]], [[Nottingham]], [[Cardiff]], [[Llanelli]], [[Exeter]], [[Plymouth]], [[Newport, Shropshire|Newport]], and [[Bristol]]. The tour's grand finale was at the Alexander Palace in North London. Forty bands played on the tour, including: Barry Forde Band, [[Leyton Buzzards]], [[The Piranhas]], [[Stiff Little Fingers]], 15, 6, 17, [[The Mekons]], [[Carol Grimes]], [[The Band]], [[Alex Harvey (musician)|Alex Harvey]], [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]], [[Angelic Upstarts]], [[Aswad]], [[The Ruts]], [[Crisis (band)|Crisis]], [[UK Subs]], Exodus and [[John Cooper Clarke]]. \n\nIn April 1979 a sister organisation, [[Rock Against Sexism]] (RAS) was founded by a group of women concerned about sexism in the music industry. Lucy Toothpaste, from RAR became a lead organiser. Many RAR bands were involved and Kate Webb and others from RAR also helped organise some of RAS's concerts.\n\nAlso in April 1979, a demonstration organised by the Southall Youth Movement against the National Front, who were standing candidates in the upcoming general election, was attacked by the police. This resulted in the death of schoolteacher, [[Death of Blair Peach|Blair Peach]], and dozens of injuries including the head wounds suffered by Clarence Baker from [[Misty in Roots]], which left him in a coma for several months. RAR quickly organised two benefit concerts at The Rainbow Theatre in North London, called 'Southall Kids Are Innocent'. The Clash, [[Pete Townshend]] of [[The Who]], The Enchanters, [[The Pop Group]], Misty in Roots, Aswad, [[The Members]] and The Ruts all performed.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2002, some music fans, concerned about a resurgence of nationalist and racist activity in the UK, organised a new group under the name of one of RAR's best-known slogans: '[[Love Music Hate Racism]]'. They put on a concert at The Astoria in [[London]] featuring [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]], [[Buzzcocks]], and [[The Libertines]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-libertines-259-1365760|title=ROCK AGAINST RACISM!|date=2004-03-08|website=NME|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref> Other acts involved in the campaign include [[Ms. Dynamite]] and [[The Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster]]. \n\nAround the globe anti-racist music fans continue to stage concerts, festivals and rallies in support of multi-culturalism, warning of the dangers of neo-fascist hatred.\n\n==Further reading==\n*''Beating Time'' by [[David Widgery]] (1986)\n*''Rock Against Racism'' by [[Syd Shelton]] (2016)\n*''Walls Come Tumbling Down: The Music and Politics of Rock Against Racism, 2 Tone and Red Wedge'' by Daniel Rachel (2016)\n*''Reminiscences of RAR: Rocking Against Racism 1976-1979''.

Lucy Toothpaste, from RAR became a lead organiser. Many RAR bands were involved and Kate Webb and others from RAR also helped organise some of RAS's concerts.\n\nAlso in April 1979, a demonstration organised by the Southall Youth Movement against the National Front, who were standing candidates in the upcoming general election, was attacked by the police. This resulted in the death of schoolteacher, [[Death of Blair Peach|Blair Peach]], and dozens of injuries including the head wounds suffered by Clarence Baker from [[Misty in Roots]], which left him in a coma for several months. RAR quickly organised two benefit concerts at The Rainbow Theatre in North London, called 'Southall Kids Are Innocent'.

It begins with the fall of the [[Hindu]] [[Vijayanagara Empire]] in 1565 and ends just before the rise of [[Sultan]] [[Haidar Ali]] in 1761.\n\nAt the height of the Vijayanagara Empire (1350\u20131565), the Mysore and Coorg region was ruled by motley [[chiefdom|chieftains]], or [[raja]]s (\"little kings\").  Each raja had dominion over a small area and supplied soldiers and annual [[tribute]] for the empire's needs. After the empire's fall and the subsequent eastward move of the diminished ruling family, many chieftains tried to loosen their imperial bonds and expand their realms. Sensing opportunity amidst the new uncertainty, various powers from the north invaded the region.  Among these were the [[Sultanate of Bijapur]] to the northwest, the [[Sultanate]] of [[Qutb Shahi dynasty|Golconda]] to the northeast, the fledgeling [[Maratha empire]] farther northwest, and the [[Mughul Empire|Mughal empire]], still farther north. For much of the 17th century the tussles between the little kings and the big powers, and amongst the little kings, culminated in shifting sovereignties, loyalties, and borders. By the turn of the 18th century, the political landscape had become better defined:  the northwestern hills were being ruled by the [[Nayak (title)#Nayankara System (in South India)|Nayaka]] rulers of [[Keladi Nayaka|Ikkeri]] the southwestern, in the [[Western Ghats]], by the [[Raja]]s of [[Coorg]], the southern plains by the [[Wodeyar]] rulers of [[Mysore state|Mysore]], all of which were [[Hindu]] dynasties; and the eastern and northeastern regions by the [[Muslim]] [[Nawab]]s of [[Nawab of the Carnatic|Arcot]] and [[Sira, India|Sira]]. Of these, Ikkeri and Coorg were independent, Mysore, although much-expanded, was formally a Mughal dependency, and Arcot and Sira, Mughal ''[[Subah (province)|subahs]]'' (or provinces).\n\nThis stability, however, did not last. Mysore's expansions had been based on unstable alliances. When the alliances began to unravel, as they did during the next half-century, political decay set in, presided over by pageant kings. The Mughal governor, Nawab of Arcot, in a display of the surviving reach of a [[Mughal Empire#Decline|declining Mughal empire]], raided the Mysore capital, [[Seringapatam]], to collect unpaid taxes.  The neighbouring Raja of Coorg began a war of attrition with Mysore over western territory.  The [[Maratha empire]] invaded again and exacted more concessions of territory. In the chaotic last decade of this period, a little-known [[Muslim]] cavalryman, [[Haidar Ali]], seized power in Mysore.  Under him, in the decades following, Mysore expanded again.  It matched all of southern India in size, and posed the last serious threat to the new rising power on the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]], the [[East India Company|English East India Company]].\n\nA common feature of all large regimes in the region during the period 1565\u20131760 is increased [[Fiscal-military state|military fiscalism]]. This mode of creating income for the state consisted of extraction of [[tribute]] payments from local chiefs under threat of military action.  It differed both from the more [[Segmentary lineage|segmentary]] modes of preceding regimes and the more absolutist modes of succeeding ones\u2014the latter achieved through direct tax collection from citizens. Another common feature of these regimes is the fragmentary [[historiography]] devoted to them, making broad generalizations difficult.\n\n==Poligars of Vijayanagara, 1565\u20131635==\n<!---FIGURE/MAP **************************** BELOW-->\n[[File:Eastern Gopura, Krishna Temple Complex, Hemakuta Hill 2 1856 photo.jpg|left|thumb|250px|alt=Ruins of a temple, entirely made of stone.

There, on the south bank of the river, in late January 1565, the Vijayanagara armies were at last decisively defeated, Rama Raja and many of his kinsmen and dependants were killed and the city opened to sacking by a combination of Golkonda soldiers and poligars from nearer to Vijayanagara. Rama Raja\u2019s warrior brother Tirumala survived the battle and brought the remnants of the once great army to Vijayanagara. Soon after, at the approach of the celebrating Golkonda army, he sought a place of greater security. This may have been Penukonda, a longtime royal stronghold, 120 miles and eight days\u2019 journey south-east of Vijayanagara; others believe that Tirumala took refuge behind the high walls of Venkatesvara\u2019s temple at Tirupati, still further away. The Muslim confederates immediately retrieved most of the territory that had been seized by Rama Raja during the previous twenty years, but certain places remained in Hindu hands for a longer time: Adoni was held until 1568 and Dharwar and Bankapur until 1573. After looting and a brief occupation, Vijayanagara was left to a future of neglect which has only been lifted recently by archaeologists and art historians working at Hampi.}}</ref> The battle was fought  on the ''[[doab]]'' ([[interfluve]], or tongue of land) between the [[Kistna River|Kistna river]] and its major left bank tributary, the [[Bhima river|Bhima]], {{convert|100|mi|km}} to the north of the imperial capital, [[Vijayanagara]] ([[:File:Poligars1525.jpg|Map&nbsp;2]]).<ref name=stein-vijayanagara-118-119/> The invaders from the north later destroyed the capital, and the ruler's family escaped to [[Penukonda]], {{convert|125|mi|km}} to the southeast, where they established their new capital.<ref name=stein-vijayanagara-119>{{citation|last=Stein|first=Burton|title=The New Cambridge History of India: Vijayanagara|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OpxeaYQbGDMC&pg=PA119|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-26693-2|pages=119|quote=Less than a year later, the sultanate confederates fell out.

Some contemporary accounts even relate how Tirumala was approached to become a co-belligerent against Bijapur in the resurgent struggles! This last scheme did not materialise, leaving Tirumala free to commence his rule of the kingdom, nominally as regent, for Sadasivaraya was still alive and remained so until perhaps 1575. Vijayanagara appears to have been reoccupied by Tirumala for a time after his victors departed, but his efforts to repopulate the city were frustrated by attacks upon it by Bijapur soldiers who might have been invited there by Peda Tirumala, Rama Raja\u2019s son, who opposed his uncle\u2019s seizure of the regency.

A foundation myth tells of a miraculous milch cow from whom milk flowed spontaneously into a pit and how the god Ranganatha appeared to the Kartar, or Raja, in a dream, instructing him to build a temple in his honour on the site (1).  Another story, in the ''Sthalapurana'', relates how the god came to reside on the island at the request of the river goddess.  The myths reflect the auspicious nature of the location, whose situation made a potent source of sacred power, the power to which aspiring rulers sought access over the centuries. It is little wonder, then, that Seringapatam, as it is more familiarly known, remained Mysore's capital, through fluctuating fortunes, until its final conquest by the British in 1799. In more mundane terms, the establishment of Wodeyar power had been facilitated by the decline of the empire of Vijayanagara, whose suzerainty Mysore continued to acknowledge for another fifty-eight years.

According to historian [[Burton Stein]]: <blockquote> 'Little kings', or ''[[raja]]s'', never attained the legal independence of an aristocracy from both monarchs and the local people whom they ruled. The sovereign claims of would-be centralizing, South Indian rulers and the resources demanded in the name of that sovereignty diminished the resources which local chieftains used as a kind of royal largess; thus centralizing demands were opposed on moral as well as on political grounds by even quite modest chiefs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stein|1985b|p=392}}</ref></blockquote>\n<!---FIGURE/MAP **************************** BELOW-->\n[[File:Channapatna fort.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=A distant fort atop a low hill.

The 18th-century [[Wodeyar]] rulers of Mysore\u2014in contrast to their contemporaries in [[Rajputana]], [[Central India]], [[Maratha]] [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]], and [[Tanjavur]]\u2014left little or no record of their administrations. Surveying the historiography, Subrahmanyam, says:<blockquote>A major problem attendant on such generalisations by modern historians concerning pre-1760 Mysore is, however, the paucity of documentation on this older 'Old Regime'.<ref name=subra1989-206/></blockquote>\n\nThe first explicit ''History'' of Mysore in English is ''Historical Sketches of the South of India, in an attempt to trace the History of Mysoor'' ({{Harvnb|Wilks|1811}}), by [[Mark Wilks]]. Wilks claimed to have based his history on various [[Kannada language]] documents, many of which have not survived. According to {{Harvnb|Subrahmanyam|1989|p=206}}, all subsequent histories of Mysore have borrowed heavily from Wilks's book for their pre-1760 content. These include [[Lewis Rice]]'s well-known ''[[Gazetteer]]'' of 1897 and C. Hayavadana Rao's major revision of the ''Gazetteer'' half a century later, and many modern spin-offs of these two works. In Subrahmanyam's words, \"Wilks's work is an important one therefore, not only for its own sake, but for its having been regurgitated and reproduced time and again with minor variations.\"<ref name=subra1989-206/>\n\nA [[Wodeyar]] dynasty genealogy, the ''Chikkadevar\u00e4ya Vam\u015b\u00e4vali'' of Tirumalarya, was composed in [[Kannada language|Kannada]] during the period 1710\u20131715, and was claimed to be based on all the then-extant inscriptions in the region.<ref name=subra1989-206>{{Harvnb|Subrahmanyam|1989|p=206}}</ref> Another genealogy, ''Kalale Doregala Vam\u015b\u00e4vali'', of the ''Delvoys'', the near-hereditary chief ministers of Mysore, was composed around the turn of the ''19th'' century.<ref name=subra1989-206/> However, neither manuscript provides information about administration, economy or military capability.<ref name=subra1989-206/> The ruling dynasty's origins, especially as expounded in later palace genealogies, are also of doubtful accuracy; this is, in part, because the Wodeyars, who were reinstated by the British on the Mysore ''[[Throne#Thrones in the Middle Ages|gaddi]]'' in 1799, to preside over a fragile sovereignty,<ref>{{Harvnb|Ikegame|2007|p=17}}</ref> \"obsessively\" attempted to demonstrate their \"unbroken\" royal lineage,<ref>{{Harvnb|Nair|2006|pp=139\u2013140}}</ref> to bolster their then uncertain status.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bhagavan|2008|p=887}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest manuscript offering clues to governance and military conflict in the pre-1760 Mysore, seems to be Dias {{Harv|Dias|1725}}, an annual letter written in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] by a Mysore-based [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit missionary]], Joachim Dias, and addressed to his [[Provincial superior]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Subrahmanyam|1989|pp=215\u2013216}}</ref> After the [[East India Company]]'s final 1799 victory over [[Tipu Sultan]], official Company records began to be published as well; these include {{Harvnb|East India Company|1800}}, a collection of [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]-related correspondence between the Company's officials in India and [[British East India Company directors|Court of Directors]] in London, and {{Harvnb|Wilks|1805}}, the first report on the new [[Princely State of Mysore]] by its resident, Mark Wilks. Around this time, French accounts of the Anglo-Mysore wars appeared as well and included {{Harvnb|Michaud|1809}}, a history of the wars by Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Michaud, another Jesuit priest. The first attempt at including a comprehensive history of Mysore in an English language work is {{Harvnb|Buchanan|1807}}, an account of a survey of [[South India]] conducted at Lord [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Richard Wellesley]]'s request, by [[Francis Buchanan]], a Scottish physician and geographer. By the end of the period of British Commissionership of Mysore (1831\u20131881), many English language works had begun to appear on a variety of Mysore-related subjects. These included {{Harvnb|Rice|1879}}, a book of English translations of [[Kannada language]] inscriptions, and {{Harvnb|Digby|1878}}, [[William Digby (writer)|William Digby]]'s two-volume critique of British famine policy during the [[Great Famine of 1876\u201378]], which devastated Mysore for years to come.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Political history of Mysore and Coorg (1761\u20131799)]]\n* [[Political history of Mysore and Coorg (1800\u20131947)]]\n* [[Company rule in India]]\n* [[Princely state]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Secondary sources===\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=60em}}\n* {{Citation|last=Ames|first=Glenn J.|title=Renascent Empire?

It begins with the fall of the [[Hindu]] [[Vijayanagara Empire]] in 1565 and ends just before the rise of [[Sultan]] [[Haidar Ali]] in 1761.\n\nAt the height of the Vijayanagara Empire (1350\u20131565), the Mysore and Coorg region was ruled by motley [[chiefdom|chieftains]], or [[raja]]s (\"little kings\").  Each raja had dominion over a small area and supplied soldiers and annual [[tribute]] for the empire's needs. After the empire's fall and the subsequent eastward move of the diminished ruling family, many chieftains tried to loosen their imperial bonds and expand their realms. Sensing opportunity amidst the new uncertainty, various powers from the north invaded the region.  Among these were the [[Sultanate of Bijapur]] to the northwest, the [[Sultanate]] of [[Qutb Shahi dynasty|Golconda]] to the northeast, the fledgeling [[Maratha empire]] farther northwest, and the [[Mughul Empire|Mughal empire]], still farther north. For much of the 17th century the tussles between the little kings and the big powers, and amongst the little kings, culminated in shifting sovereignties, loyalties, and borders. By the turn of the 18th century, the political landscape had become better defined:  the northwestern hills were being ruled by the [[Nayak (title)#Nayankara System (in South India)|Nayaka]] rulers of [[Keladi Nayaka|Ikkeri]] the southwestern, in the [[Western Ghats]], by the [[Raja]]s of [[Coorg]], the southern plains by the [[Wodeyar]] rulers of [[Mysore state|Mysore]], all of which were [[Hindu]] dynasties; and the eastern and northeastern regions by the [[Muslim]] [[Nawab]]s of [[Nawab of the Carnatic|Arcot]] and [[Sira, India|Sira]]. Of these, Ikkeri and Coorg were independent, Mysore, although much-expanded, was formally a Mughal dependency, and Arcot and Sira, Mughal ''[[Subah (province)|subahs]]'' (or provinces).\n\nThis stability, however, did not last. Mysore's expansions had been based on unstable alliances. When the alliances began to unravel, as they did during the next half-century, political decay set in, presided over by pageant kings. The Mughal governor, Nawab of Arcot, in a display of the surviving reach of a [[Mughal Empire#Decline|declining Mughal empire]], raided the Mysore capital, [[Seringapatam]], to collect unpaid taxes.  The neighbouring Raja of Coorg began a war of attrition with Mysore over western territory.  The [[Maratha empire]] invaded again and exacted more concessions of territory. In the chaotic last decade of this period, a little-known [[Muslim]] cavalryman, [[Haidar Ali]], seized power in Mysore.  Under him, in the decades following, Mysore expanded again.  It matched all of southern India in size, and posed the last serious threat to the new rising power on the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]], the [[East India Company|English East India Company]].\n\nA common feature of all large regimes in the region during the period 1565\u20131760 is increased [[Fiscal-military state|military fiscalism]]. This mode of creating income for the state consisted of extraction of [[tribute]] payments from local chiefs under threat of military action.  It differed both from the more [[Segmentary lineage|segmentary]] modes of preceding regimes and the more absolutist modes of succeeding ones\u2014the latter achieved through direct tax collection from citizens. Another common feature of these regimes is the fragmentary [[historiography]] devoted to them, making broad generalizations difficult.\n\n==Poligars of Vijayanagara, 1565\u20131635==\n<!---FIGURE/MAP **************************** BELOW-->\n[[File:Eastern Gopura, Krishna Temple Complex, Hemakuta Hill 2 1856 photo.jpg|left|thumb|250px|alt=Ruins of a temple, entirely made of stone.

Rama Raja\u2019s warrior brother Tirumala survived the battle and brought the remnants of the once great army to Vijayanagara. Soon after, at the approach of the celebrating Golkonda army, he sought a place of greater security.

Another story, in the ''Sthalapurana'', relates how the god came to reside on the island at the request of the river goddess.  The myths reflect the auspicious nature of the location, whose situation made a potent source of sacred power, the power to which aspiring rulers sought access over the centuries. It is little wonder, then, that Seringapatam, as it is more familiarly known, remained Mysore's capital, through fluctuating fortunes, until its final conquest by the British in 1799. In more mundane terms, the establishment of Wodeyar power had been facilitated by the decline of the empire of Vijayanagara, whose suzerainty Mysore continued to acknowledge for another fifty-eight years.

First, the terrain, and the possibility of retreating periodically into the wooded hillside, favoured them, in contrast to their relatively clumsy opponents. Second, the Mysore army could never maintain a permanent presence in the region, given the fact that the Wodeyar kingdom had several open frontiers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Subrahmanyam|1989|p=220}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMore than a century earlier, [[Lewis Rice]], had written: <blockquote> Dodda Virappa evinced throughout his long and vigorous reign an unconquerable spirit, and though surrounded by powerful neighbours, neither the number nor the strength of this enemies seems to have relaxed his courage or damped his enterprise.

The 18th-century [[Wodeyar]] rulers of Mysore\u2014in contrast to their contemporaries in [[Rajputana]], [[Central India]], [[Maratha]] [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]], and [[Tanjavur]]\u2014left little or no record of their administrations. Surveying the historiography, Subrahmanyam, says:<blockquote>A major problem attendant on such generalisations by modern historians concerning pre-1760 Mysore is, however, the paucity of documentation on this older 'Old Regime'.<ref name=subra1989-206/></blockquote>\n\nThe first explicit ''History'' of Mysore in English is ''Historical Sketches of the South of India, in an attempt to trace the History of Mysoor'' ({{Harvnb|Wilks|1811}}), by [[Mark Wilks]]. Wilks claimed to have based his history on various [[Kannada language]] documents, many of which have not survived. According to {{Harvnb|Subrahmanyam|1989|p=206}}, all subsequent histories of Mysore have borrowed heavily from Wilks's book for their pre-1760 content. These include [[Lewis Rice]]'s well-known ''[[Gazetteer]]'' of 1897 and C. Hayavadana Rao's major revision of the ''Gazetteer'' half a century later, and many modern spin-offs of these two works. In Subrahmanyam's words, \"Wilks's work is an important one therefore, not only for its own sake, but for its having been regurgitated and reproduced time and again with minor variations.\"<ref name=subra1989-206/>\n\nA [[Wodeyar]] dynasty genealogy, the ''Chikkadevar\u00e4ya Vam\u015b\u00e4vali'' of Tirumalarya, was composed in [[Kannada language|Kannada]] during the period 1710\u20131715, and was claimed to be based on all the then-extant inscriptions in the region.<ref name=subra1989-206>{{Harvnb|Subrahmanyam|1989|p=206}}</ref> Another genealogy, ''Kalale Doregala Vam\u015b\u00e4vali'', of the ''Delvoys'', the near-hereditary chief ministers of Mysore, was composed around the turn of the ''19th'' century.<ref name=subra1989-206/> However, neither manuscript provides information about administration, economy or military capability.<ref name=subra1989-206/> The ruling dynasty's origins, especially as expounded in later palace genealogies, are also of doubtful accuracy; this is, in part, because the Wodeyars, who were reinstated by the British on the Mysore ''[[Throne#Thrones in the Middle Ages|gaddi]]'' in 1799, to preside over a fragile sovereignty,<ref>{{Harvnb|Ikegame|2007|p=17}}</ref> \"obsessively\" attempted to demonstrate their \"unbroken\" royal lineage,<ref>{{Harvnb|Nair|2006|pp=139\u2013140}}</ref> to bolster their then uncertain status.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bhagavan|2008|p=887}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest manuscript offering clues to governance and military conflict in the pre-1760 Mysore, seems to be Dias {{Harv|Dias|1725}}, an annual letter written in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] by a Mysore-based [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit missionary]], Joachim Dias, and addressed to his [[Provincial superior]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Subrahmanyam|1989|pp=215\u2013216}}</ref> After the [[East India Company]]'s final 1799 victory over [[Tipu Sultan]], official Company records began to be published as well; these include {{Harvnb|East India Company|1800}}, a collection of [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]-related correspondence between the Company's officials in India and [[British East India Company directors|Court of Directors]] in London, and {{Harvnb|Wilks|1805}}, the first report on the new [[Princely State of Mysore]] by its resident, Mark Wilks. Around this time, French accounts of the Anglo-Mysore wars appeared as well and included {{Harvnb|Michaud|1809}}, a history of the wars by Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Michaud, another Jesuit priest. The first attempt at including a comprehensive history of Mysore in an English language work is {{Harvnb|Buchanan|1807}}, an account of a survey of [[South India]] conducted at Lord [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Richard Wellesley]]'s request, by [[Francis Buchanan]], a Scottish physician and geographer. By the end of the period of British Commissionership of Mysore (1831\u20131881), many English language works had begun to appear on a variety of Mysore-related subjects.

Suzong ascended the throne after his father fled to [[Sichuan]] during the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] in 756; Li Heng himself had fled in the opposite direction, to [[Lingwu]], where he was declared emperor by the army. Much of Emperor Suzong's reign was spent in quelling the aforementioned rebellion, which was ultimately put down in 763 during the reign of his son [[Emperor Daizong of Tang|Emperor Daizong]].\n\nDuring Emperor Suzong's reign, the tradition of [[eunuch]]s becoming top-ranked officials began, with [[Li Fuguo]] becoming the commander of the [[Imperial Guards (Tang dynasty)|imperial guards]] and possessing nearly absolute power near Emperor Suzong's reign. In 762, with Emperor Suzong gravely ill, Li Fuguo killed Emperor Suzong's wife [[Empress Zhang (Tang dynasty)|Empress Zhang]] in a power struggle and shortly after that, Emperor Suzong died of [[myocardial infarction]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} He was succeeded by his son Emperor Daizong, who was eventually able to kill Li Fuguo, but the tradition of eunuchs in power had started. Suzong's death on 16 May came only 13 days after the death of his father, the Emperor Xuanzong.\n\n== Background ==\nLi Sisheng was born in 711,<ref name=birth/> during the second reign of his grandfather [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|Emperor Ruizong]], as the third son of his father, then the Crown Prince, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Li Longji]], who would later become Emperor Xuanzong.  His mother Consort [[Yang Guipin]] (posthumously [[Empress Yuanxian]]) was from the imperial clan of the preceding [[Sui dynasty]].  Her great-grandfather Yang Shida (\u694a\u58eb\u9054) was a high -level official during Sui and had been given the title Prince of Zheng (\u912d\u738b).  Her father Yang Zhiqing (\u694a\u77e5\u6176) was a general of the imperial guards during Tang.  At the time that Consort Yang Guipin was pregnant with Li Sisheng, Li Longji was locked in a power struggle with his aunt, Emperor Ruizong's sister [[Princess Taiping]], and it was said that Princess Taiping had placed many associates in the crown prince's palace to spy on Li Longji and that she did not want him to have many sons.  (He already had two by that point\u2014Li Sisheng's older brothers [[Li Cong|Li Sizhi]], later named Li Cong (by Consort Liu) and [[Li Ying (prince)|Li Siqian]], later named Li Ying (by Consort Zhao).)  Li Longji was worried that, if Princess Taiping found out that Yang Guipin was pregnant, Princess Taiping's associates might harm him, and he spoke to a close associate, [[Zhang Yue (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Shuo]], stating: \"A powerful individual did not want me to have many sons.  I am afraid that this woman would become a target.  What do you think?\"  Li Longji began to prepare an herbal stew that, in [[traditional Chinese medicine]], was believed to be able to induce an [[abortion]], but as he did so, fell asleep and had a dream that a god descended and overturned the ''[[ding (vessel)|ding]]'' holding the stew.  When he told Zhang this as well, Zhang responded, \"This is heaven's will.  You should not worry.\"<ref name=BT52>''Old Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u537752|vol. 52]].</ref>  (As a result, later on in life, Li Sisheng would feel personally indebted to Zhang Shuo.)<ref>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377220|vol. 220]].</ref>\n\nIn 712, Emperor Ruizong passed the throne to Li Longji, who took the throne as Emperor Xuanzong, but Emperor Ruizong retained actual power as ''[[Taishang Huang]]'' (retired emperor).  Shortly after Emperor Xuanzong took the throne, Emperor Ruizong, as retired emperor, was the one who created Li Sisheng the Prince of Shan.  (After Emperor Xuanzong suppressed Princess Taiping's associates in 713 and forced her to commit suicide, Emperor Ruizong transferred imperial authorities to Emperor Xuanzong and was no longer involved in politics.)  Li Siqian, whose mother Consort Zhao was then Emperor Xuanzong's favorite concubine, was created crown prince.  Li Sisheng, although his mother alive, was raised by Emperor Xuanzong's wife [[Empress Wang (Xuanzong)|Empress Wang]], who was herself sonless.<ref name=BT52/>  It was said that in his childhood, he was kind and studious, and Emperor Xuanzong was pleased with him.  Emperor Xuanzong thus made the officials He Zhizhang (\u8cc0\u77e5\u7ae0), Pan Su (\u6f58\u8085), L\u00fc Xiang (\u5442\u5411), Huangfu Bin (\u7687\u752b\u5f6c), and Xing Su (\u90a2\u74b9) accompany him in his studies.\n\nIn 724, due to the machinations of [[Consort Wu]], who had by then become Emperor Xuanzong's favorite concubine, Empress Wang was deposed, and she died shortly after.<ref>''Old Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u537751|vol. 51]].</ref>  Thereafter, Consort Wu began a campaign, in association with the [[chancellor of the Tang dynasty|chancellor]] [[Li Linfu]], to have her own son Li Qing the Prince of Shou made crown prince, but was not able to initially succeed.  Meanwhile, in 726, Li Sisheng's title was changed to the Prince of Zhong, and his name was changed to Li Jun.  In 728, his own mother Consort Yang Guipin died.<ref name=BT52/>\n\nIn 729, when there was a [[Khitan people|Khitan]] and [[Kumo Xi]] incursion, Li Jun was put in titular command of the army sent to repel the Khitan and the Xi, with Emperor Xuanzong's second cousin Li Hui (\u674e\u8918) the Prince of Xin'an in actual command of the army.  After Li Hui defeated the Khitan and the Xi, Li Jun was nevertheless rewarded with the honorific title of ''Situ'' (\u53f8\u5f92), one of the [[Three Ducal Ministers]].  In 735, his name was changed to Li Yu.\n\nIn 737, due to the machinations of Consort Wu, Li Ying, along with his brothers Li Yao (\u674e\u7464) the Prince of E and Li Ju (\u674e\u741a) the Prince of Guang, was accused of crimes, deposed, and forced to commit suicide.  Consort Wu and Li Linfu continued to lobby for Li Qing (whose name had been changed to Li Mao at this point) to be created crown prince, but with Consort Wu having died herself later in 737 and Emperor Xuanzong believing that Li Yu was capable, he hesitated.  At the urging of the eunuch [[Gao Lishi]], who believed that one of his older sons should be made crown prince, Emperor Xuanzong created Li Yu crown prince in 738 and renamed him Li Shao.  (As it was quickly pointed out that he thus shared a name with the [[Liu Song]] crown prince [[Liu Shao (Liu Song)|Liu Shao]], who killed his father and usurped the throne, his name was then quickly changed to Li Heng and would not change again thereafter.)  One of his consorts, Consort Wei, the sister of the official Wei Jian (\u97cb\u5805), was created crown princess.\n\n== As crown prince ==\n[[File:S407 Qianyuan SuZong (7243234232).jpg|thumb|\"Qianyuan SuZong\" during Suzong Emperor]]\nAs Li Heng's ascension to be crown prince was against Li Linfu's wishes, and also because Wei Jian, who drew favor from Emperor Xuanzong due to his abilities to increase revenues for the imperial treasury, was becoming a rival to Li Linfu at court, Li Linfu looked for ways to incriminate both Wei and Li Heng.  In 746, when the official Yang Shenjin (\u694a\u614e\u77dc), at Li Linfu's instigation, reported to Emperor Xuanzong that, one night, Li Heng met Wei while both were sightseeing, and shortly after, Wei met a friend of his, the general Huangfu Weiming (\u7687\u752b\u60df\u660e) at a [[Taoist temple]], Li Linfu used these incidents to accuse Wei and Huangfu of secretly pledging allegiance to Li Heng and planning to remove Emperor Xuanzong to replace him with Li Heng.  Wei and Huangfu were arrested and interrogated by Yang, Wang Hong (\u738b\u9277), and Ji Wen (\u5409\u6eab), but Emperor Xuanzong, who did not want the case to further explode into a major incident although he believed Li Linfu's accusations, demoted Wei and Huangfu out of the capital and, for the time being, stopped the investigation.  However, when Wei Jian's brothers Wei Lan (\u97cb\u862d) and Wei Zhi (\u97cb\u829d) submitted a defense of their brother Wei Jian later in 746\u2014and the defense cited words from Li Heng\u2014Emperor Xuanzong was incensed.  Li Heng, in fear, divorced Crown Princess Wei and asked for the Wei brothers to be punished.  The Wei brothers, along with a number of their associates\u2014including the former chancellor [[Li Shizhi]], Wei Bin (\u97cb\u658c), Wei Jian's nephew Li Quan (\u674e\u7404) the Prince of Xue, Pei Kuan (\u88f4\u5bec), and Li Qiwu (\u674e\u9f4a\u7269), were all demoted.  (In 747, at Li Linfu's instigation, the Wei brothers, Huangfu, and Li Shizhi were all forced to commit suicide.)\n\nLater in 746, yet another incident again nearly brought disaster to Li Heng.  One of Li Heng's other consorts, Consort Du, was a daughter of the official Du Youlin (\u675c\u6709\u9130).  Consort Du's brother-in-law Liu Ji (\u67f3\u52e3) had a dispute with the Du family and falsely accused them of using witchcraft in favor of Li Heng.  Li Linfu had Ji Wen interrogate Liu, and Ji implicated Liu in the alleged plot as well.  Du Youlin, Liu, and Liu's friend Wang Zeng (\u738b\u66fe) were all caned to death, and Li Heng felt compelled to expel Consort Du from the household as well.  Li Linfu also used this case to have two other officials friendly with Liu, Li Yong (\u674e\u9095) and Pei Dunfu (\u88f4\u6566\u5fa9), executed by caning.\n\nIn 747, when one of Emperor Xuanzong's favorite generals, [[An Lushan]], visited the capital [[Chang'an]] to pay respect to Emperor Xuanzong, An, who was not [[Han Chinese|Han]], initially refused to bow to Li Heng\u2014pretending that he was only loyal to Emperor Xuanzong and to no one else, including the crown prince, and that he did not even know what a crown prince was.  Only after Emperor Xuanzong explained what a crown prince is\u2014the reserve emperor, to succeed him later\u2014was An willing to bow to Li Heng.  This caused Emperor Xuanzong to favor An even more, but also later caused An to be apprehensive of whether Li Heng would bear continued resentment toward him over the incident.\n\nLater in 747, Li Linfu tried to use yet another case to undermine Li Heng.  The general [[Wang Zhongsi]], who was raised with Li Heng inside the palace on account of the fact that his father Wang Haibin (\u738b\u6d77\u8cd3) had died in battle in service to the empire, was accused of interfering with the campaign of another general, Dong Yan'guang (\u8463\u5ef6\u5149), against [[Tibetan Empire]].  Li Linfu broadened the accusation to an accusation that Wang was planning to start a coup to overthrow Emperor Xuanzong and replace him with Li Heng.  At the intercession of another general, [[Geshu Han]], however, Wang was spared from death, and Li Heng was not implicated.  It was said that during this time period, Li Linfu made other attempts to undermine Li Heng, but with Gao Lishi and Zhang Shuo's son Zhang Ji (\u5f35\u578d), who had married Li Heng's sister Princess Ningqing, protecting Li Heng, Li Heng escaped unharmed each time.\n\nAs of 754, the chancellor in power was [[Yang Guozhong]] (Li Linfu having died in 752), the cousin of Emperor Xuanzong's then-favorite concubine [[Yang Guifei]] (unrelated to Li Heng's mother).  Yang Guozhong and An were locked in a power struggle, and Yang repeatedly accused An of plotting a rebellion, but Emperor Xuanzong would not believe it, although Li Heng eventually came to agree with Yang Guozhong.  In late 755, with Yang Guozhong repeatedly trying to provoke An into a rebellion, An finally did, from his base at Fanyang (\u8303\u967d, in modern [[Beijing]]).  After the rebellion started, Emperor Xuanzong briefly considered making Li Heng [[regent]], but at the pleas of Consort Yang and her three sisters (who were fearful that Li Heng would act against them if he had regent powers), did not actually do so.\n\nBy summer 756, An had declared a new state of [[Yan (An\u2013Shi)|Yan]] as its emperor, and his forces were approaching Chang'an.  on July 14, 756,<ref>[http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna=%AD%F0&king=%A5%C8%A9v&reign=%A4%D1%C4_&yy=15&ycanzi=&mm=6&dd=13&dcanzi=]{{dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref> Emperor Xuanzong, with Yang Guozhong suggesting that they flee to Jiannan Circuit (\u528d\u5357, headquartered in modern [[Chengdu]]), abandoned Chang'an and fled with Gao Lishi, Yang Guozhong, Wei, Li Heng, Consort Yang, and her family. The following day, July 15, the imperial guards accompanying the emperor, angry at Yang Guozhong, rose at Mawei Station (\u99ac\u5d6c, in modern [[Baoji]], [[Shaanxi]]) and killed him and forced Emperor Xuanzong to kill Consort Yang as well.  Emperor Xuanzong then poised to continue to head toward Jiannan.  The people in the Mawei region tried to persuade Emperor Xuanzong not to continue on\u2014believing that Chang'an could be recaptured.  Emperor Xuanzong asked Li Heng to try to comfort the people.  Once Li Heng left Emperor Xuanzong's presence, however, Li Fuguo and Li Heng's sons [[Li Tan]] the Prince of Jianning and [[Emperor Daizong of Tang|Li Chu]] the Prince of Guangping, persuaded Li Heng not to follow Emperor Xuanzong to Jiannan\u2014arguing that with the physical barriers between Chang'an and Jiannan, that once they had left the region, Chang'an could no longer be captured.  Li Heng agreed and had Li Chu report this to Emperor Xuanzong.  Emperor Xuanzong agreed with Li Heng's decision, but he himself continued on to Jiannan.  Li Heng, escorted by a small number of guard soldiers commanded by Li Tan, then headed to the border city of [[Lingwu]].  With the army at Lingwu pressuring him to take imperial title, Li Heng declared himself emperor on August 13 (as Emperor Suzong).<ref name=startreign/>  When news of this reached Emperor Xuanzong in Jiannan, Emperor Xuanzong recognized Emperor Suzong as emperor and took the title of ''[[Taishang Huang]]'' (retired emperor), although he continued to exercise some imperial authority\u2014including, for example, issuing an edict that posthumously honored Emperor Suzong's mother Consort Yang as Empress Yuanxian.  (Some historians, including the modern historian [[Bo Yang]], believed that Emperor Xuanzong's continued issuance of edicts, while not on the surface conflicting with Emperor Suzong's authority, caused Emperor Suzong pressure to try to recapture Chang'an as quickly as possible to avoid any contention for the throne\u2014either in the form of Emperor Xuanzong himself resuming imperial authority or in the form of another imperial prince rising to defeat Yan.<ref>''[[Bo Yang]] Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian'', vol. 53 [757].</ref>)\n\n== Reign ==\n[[File:Tang Suzong.jpg|thumb|left|\"Greeting the Emperor at Wangxian\" \u671b\u8ce2\u8fce\u99d5\u5716, probably a 13th-century painting, detail of Tang Suzong.]]\nEmperor Suzong, once he became emperor, set his eyes on recapturing Chang'an from Yan forces, as Yan forces faced heavy resistance from the people of the [[Guanzhong]] region (i.e., the region around Chang'an) and was not able to keep the region under firm control.  (By this point, An Lushan had been assassinated and succeeded by his son [[An Qingxu]], as the emperor of Yan.)  However, an immediate attempt to do so, commanded by the chancellor [[Fang Guan]], was defeated by the Yan forces near Chang'an with heavy losses.  Meanwhile, around the same time, Emperor Suzong's brother [[Li Lin (prince)|Li Lin]] the Prince of Yong tried to mount a challenge against him, seeking to effectively secede with the region south of the [[Yangtze River]], but was quickly defeated and killed by forces loyal to Emperor Suzong.  Emperor Suzong's court was also itself filled with internal struggles, with Li Fuguo aligned with Emperor Suzong's favorite concubine [[Empress Zhang (Tang dynasty)|Consort Zhang]], in opposition to Li Chu, Li Tan, and Emperor Suzong's trusted advisor [[Li Mi (chancellor)|Li Mi]].  In early 757, after Li Tan repeatedly accused Li Fuguo and Consort Zhang of corruption, Li Fuguo and Empress Zhang in turn falsely accused him of trying to assassinate Li Chu, who was older than he was, in order to become the heir.  Emperor Suzong, in anger, ordered Li Tan to commit suicide, which drew fear from Li Chu and Li Mi.  Li Chu considered assassinating Li Fuguo and Consort Zhang, but at Li Mi's urging, stopped his plans to do so.\n\nEmperor Suzong, finding it difficult to recapture Chang'an just with his own troops, then entered into an alliance with [[Huige]]'s [[Bayanchur Khan]] Yaoluoge Moyanchuo, where Huige forces arrived at Emperor Suzong's then-headquarters at Fengxiang (\u9cf3\u7fd4, in modern Baoji) to join the elite Tang forces recalled from the Anxi Circuit and the [[Western Regions]] (''Xiyu'').  (Emperor Suzong did so by promising that the Huige forces would be permitted to pillage the Chnag'an region once it was recaptured.)  Li Mi suggested that these forces be used to attack Yan's power base at Fanyang first, to root out the possibility of a Yan recovery.  Emperor Suzong chose not to do so and decided to attack Chang'an first, with Li Chu in command of the joint forces.  The forces recaptured Chang'an in fall 757, allowing Emperor Suzong to rebuild his administration in the capital. (Huige forces were set to pillage Chang'an, but Li Chu bowed to the Huige prince commanding Huige forces to plead to delay the pillage\u2014pointing out that if pillaging were carried out, the people of the eastern capital [[Luoyang]], then serving as Yan's capital, would resist heavily, and asking that Huige pillage ''Luoyang'' instead.  The Huige prince agreed.)  After Emperor Suzong recaptured Chang'an, Li Mi resigned and became a [[hermit]], leaving Li Fuguo, Consort Zhang (who was then created empress), and Li Chu the lead figures at court, and Li Fuguo, in command of the imperial guards, would soon have such paramount powers that even Emperor Suzong was afraid of offending him.  Empress Zhang, meanwhile, wanted to make her son Li Shao (\u674e\u4f4b) crown prince, but Emperor Suzong, believing Li Chu, who was his oldest son, to be capable and accomplished, created him crown prince instead and changed his name to Li Yu.  Emperor Suzong also welcomed Emperor Xuanzong back from Jiannan and housed him at a palace converted from Emperor Xuanzong's old residence as an imperial prince, Xingqing Palace (\u8208\u6176\u5bae).\n\nA month after Chang'an was recaptured, Tang and Huige forces recaptured Luoyang as well, and Luoyang suffered heavy pillaging by Huige forces.<ref>Bo Yang, ''Outlines of the History of the Chinese'' (\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba\u53f2\u7db1), vol. 2, p. 549.</ref>  An Qingxu fled to [[Ye, China|Yecheng]] and took up position there, but most Yan territory resubmitted to Tang, and war appeared to be poised to end.  To cement the alliance with Huige, Emperor Suzong also gave his daughter Princess Ningguo in marriage to Yaoluoge Moyanchuo.\n\nIn 758, however, one of the major Yan generals who had submitted to Tang, [[Shi Siming]], claiming that there had been a plot by Emperor Suzong and the Tang general [[Li Guangbi]], to have his subordinate Wu Cheng'en (\u70cf\u627f\u6069) assassinate him, re-rebelled and advanced south.  In spring 759, he engaged the Tang forces then sieging An Qingxu at Yecheng, and while the initial battle was indecisive, the Tang forces panicked during the battle and collapsed, allowing the siege of Yecheng to be lifted.  Shi Siming then led An Qingxu into a trap and killed him, taking over as the emperor of Yan and further advancing south to recapture Luoyang, again making it Yan's capital.  However, his further attempts to advance against Chang'an was blocked by Li Guangbi, and the Yan and Tang forces went into a stalemate.  While the stalemate was continuing, in 760, after the eunuch Xing Yan'en (\u90a2\u5ef6\u6069) reported to Emperor Suzong that the general Liu Zhan (\u5289\u5c55) was disobeying orders, and that Liu's name was in mystical prophecies, Emperor Suzong accepted Xing's suggestion to find a way to eliminate Liu.  After Liu found this out, he was forced into rebellion in late 760; he had successes against other Tang generals and controlled the lower Yangtze region for several months until he was defeated by another Tang general, Tian Shen'gong (\u7530\u795e\u529f).\n\nMeanwhile, Emperor Xuanzong settled into a routine at Xingqing Palace, with Chen Xuanli (\u9673\u7384\u79ae) and Gao Lishi attending to him. Also often attending to him were his sister Li Chiying (\u674e\u6301\u76c8) the Princess Yuzhen, the [[lady-in-waiting]] Ru Xianyuan (\u5982\u4ed9\u5a9b), and the eunuchs Wang Cheng'en (\u738b\u627f\u6069) and Wei Yue (\u9b4f\u6085).  The imperial musicians often played for him, and he often climbed up Changqing Tower (\u9577\u6176\u6a13) to receive well wishes from the populace.  He also often held feasts for generals and people from Jiannan, with Li Chiying and Ru serving as hostesses.  Emperor Xuanzong's attendants looked down at Li Fuguo. To retaliate, Li Fuguo began to try to convince Emperor Suzong that Emperor Xuanzong and his attendants were plotting to seize power back.  In 760, with Emperor Suzong's tacit, although not explicit, approval, on one occasion when Emperor Xuanzong was out riding, Li Fuguo intercepted him and forced him to move back to the main palace.  Even on that occasion, however, Gao would not submit to Li Fuguo and even yelled at Li Fuguo to force him to get off his horse and to escort Emperor Xuanzong on foot, along with Gao.  Soon after Emperor Xuanzong was forcibly moved, Li Fuguo forced Chen to retire, Li Chiying to return to her temple (she had become an ordained [[Daoism|Daoist nun]] in 711), and exiled Gao, Wang, Wei, and Ru.  Emperor Suzong then had his daughters Princesses Wan'an and Xianyi attend to Emperor Xuanzong, but Emperor Xuanzong, having lost his trusted attendants, became silent and ill.  For the time being, Emperor Suzong frequently visited Emperor Xuanzong, but he himself grew ill as well and rarely visited.  He also regretted permitting Li Fuguo to take these actions and considered killing him, but hesitated and ultimately did not do so because Li Fuguo commanded the imperial guards.  Indeed, thereafter, Li Fuguo became minister of defense, and Emperor Suzong was often forced to comply with his wishes as far as governance was concerned, although Emperor Suzong rebuffed his wishes to become chancellor.\n\nIn 761, Shi Siming was assassinated and succeeded by his son [[Shi Chaoyi]], and it was said that other Yan generals, who were originally Shi Siming's equals, began to disobey Shi Chaoyi's orders.  Tang forces thus were able to beat back the Yan forces but were not able to dislodge Shi Huaiyi from Luoyang, and final victory over Yan would not come in Emperor Suzong's lifetime.\n\nIn summer 762, Emperor Xuanzong died.  Emperor Suzong was bedridden by this point, and it was said that he was so saddened by Emperor Xuanzong's death that his illness further advanced.  He thus granted [[regent]] powers on Li Yu.  By this point, Empress Zhang and Li Fuguo were no longer allies, and Empress Zhang summoned Li Yu, wanting an alliance with him to kill Li Fuguo and his subordinate [[Cheng Yuanzhen]].  Li Yu refused, pointing out that this would cause alarm to the very-ill Emperor Suzong.  Empress Zhang then entered into an alliance with Li Yu's younger brother Li Xi (\u674e\u4fc2) the Prince of Yue, and they tried to set a trap for Li Fuguo, with 200 strong eunuchs loyal to her and Li Xi ready to act against Li Fuguo.  On May 14, 762,<ref>[http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna=%AD%F0&king=%B5%C2%A9v&reign=%C4_%C0%B3&yy=1&ycanzi=&mm=4&dd=16&dcanzi=]{{dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref> she issued an order in Emperor Suzong's name, summoning Li Yu into the palace.  However, Cheng received this news and reported this to Li Fuguo and Li Yu, and Cheng then escorted Li Yu to the imperial guard headquarters.  Imperial guards commanded by Li Fuguo and Cheng then entered the palace and arrested Empress Zhang, Li Xi, and their associates.  It was said that with Emperor Suzong resting at Changsheng Hall (\u9577\u751f\u6bbf), the soldiers dragged Empress Zhang and the attending ladies in waiting and eunuchs away from his presence.  Emperor Suzong was said to be left alone without attendants.  He died on May 16, only 13 days after Emperor Xuanzong's death.<ref name=death/>  Li Fuguo executed Empress Zhang, Li Xi, and Li Xian (\u674e\u50e9) the Prince of Yan and then declared Li Yu emperor (as Emperor Daizong).\n\n===Relations with Muslims===\nFaced with the devastating [[An Lushan Rebellion]], Emperor Suzong of Tang wrote a desperate letter to [[Al-Mansur]] requesting for armed assistance. [[Al-Mansur]] responded by sending 4000 men to China in order to aid Emperor Suzong of Tang. In return they were allowed to settle down permanently in China after the rebellion was repressed. Some of them married local Chinese people. This helped in founding of the earliest Muslim communities of China.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5LSvkQvvmAMC&pg=PA283&dq=arab+mercenaries+china&q=arab%20mercenaries%20china|title=The religious traditions of Asia: religion, history, and culture|author=Joseph Mitsuo Kitagawa|editor=Joseph Mitsuo Kitagawa|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|edition=2, illustrated|location=|page=283|isbn=978-0-7007-1762-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqkeAAAAIAAJ&q=arab+mercenaries+china&dq=arab+mercenaries+china|title=China: a short cultural history|author=Charles Patrick Fitzgerald|year=1961|publisher=Praeger|edition=3|page=332}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oLnXAAAAMAAJ&dq=abu+giafar+chinese&q=China+%E2%80%A2+Arab+troops+were+dispatched+by+Abu+Gia-+far+to+China.|title=The Muslim diaspora: a comprehensive reference to the spread of Islam in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas|author=Everett Jenkins|accessdate= |series= |volume=1 |date= |year=1999 |edition=illustrated |publisher=McFarland |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-7864-0431-5|page=61 |pages= |quote=Arab troops were dispatched by Abu Gia-far to China.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvtwAAAAMAAJ&dq=abu+giafar+chinese&q=abu+giafar|title=Embers in Cathay|author=Stanley Ghosh|accessdate= |edition=|series= |volume= |date= |year=1961 |publisher=Doubleday |location= |language= |isbn=|page=60 |pages= |quote=During the reign of Abbassid Caliph Abu Giafar in the middle of the 8th century, many Arab soldiers evidently settled near the garrisons on the Chinese frontier.}}</ref>\n\n== Chancellors during reign ==\n* [[Wei Jiansu]] (756\u2013757)\n* [[Cui Yuan (705\u2013768)|Cui Yuan]] (756\u2013758)\n* [[Fang Guan]] (756\u2013757)\n* [[Pei Mian]] (756\u2013757)\n* [[Cui Huan]] (756\u2013757)\n* [[Li Lin (Tang chancellor)|Li Lin]] (757\u2013758)\n* [[Miao Jinqing]] (757\u2013759, 760\u2013762)\n* [[Zhang Gao]] (757\u2013758)\n* [[Wang Yu (chancellor)|Wang Yu]] (758\u2013759)\n* [[L\u00fc Yin]] (759, 759\u2013760)\n* [[Li Xian (chancellor)|Li Xian]] (759)\n* [[Li Kui (chancellor)|Li Kui]] (759\u2013761)\n* [[Diwu Qi]] (759)\n* [[Xiao Hua (Tang dynasty)|Xiao Hua]] (761\u2013762)\n* [[Pei Zunqing]] (761\u2013762)\n* [[Yuan Zai]] (762)\n\n==Family==\n* Parents:\n** [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Li Longji]], Xuanzong ({{lang|zh|\u7384\u5b97 \u674e\u9686\u57fa}};

Suzong ascended the throne after his father fled to [[Sichuan]] during the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] in 756; Li Heng himself had fled in the opposite direction, to [[Lingwu]], where he was declared emperor by the army. Much of Emperor Suzong's reign was spent in quelling the aforementioned rebellion, which was ultimately put down in 763 during the reign of his son [[Emperor Daizong of Tang|Emperor Daizong]].\n\nDuring Emperor Suzong's reign, the tradition of [[eunuch]]s becoming top-ranked officials began, with [[Li Fuguo]] becoming the commander of the [[Imperial Guards (Tang dynasty)|imperial guards]] and possessing nearly absolute power near Emperor Suzong's reign. In 762, with Emperor Suzong gravely ill, Li Fuguo killed Emperor Suzong's wife [[Empress Zhang (Tang dynasty)|Empress Zhang]] in a power struggle and shortly after that, Emperor Suzong died of [[myocardial infarction]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} He was succeeded by his son Emperor Daizong, who was eventually able to kill Li Fuguo, but the tradition of eunuchs in power had started. Suzong's death on 16 May came only 13 days after the death of his father, the Emperor Xuanzong.\n\n== Background ==\nLi Sisheng was born in 711,<ref name=birth/> during the second reign of his grandfather [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|Emperor Ruizong]], as the third son of his father, then the Crown Prince, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Li Longji]], who would later become Emperor Xuanzong.  His mother Consort [[Yang Guipin]] (posthumously [[Empress Yuanxian]]) was from the imperial clan of the preceding [[Sui dynasty]].  Her great-grandfather Yang Shida (\u694a\u58eb\u9054) was a high -level official during Sui and had been given the title Prince of Zheng (\u912d\u738b).  Her father Yang Zhiqing (\u694a\u77e5\u6176) was a general of the imperial guards during Tang.  At the time that Consort Yang Guipin was pregnant with Li Sisheng, Li Longji was locked in a power struggle with his aunt, Emperor Ruizong's sister [[Princess Taiping]], and it was said that Princess Taiping had placed many associates in the crown prince's palace to spy on Li Longji and that she did not want him to have many sons.  (He already had two by that point\u2014Li Sisheng's older brothers [[Li Cong|Li Sizhi]], later named Li Cong (by Consort Liu) and [[Li Ying (prince)|Li Siqian]], later named Li Ying (by Consort Zhao).)  Li Longji was worried that, if Princess Taiping found out that Yang Guipin was pregnant, Princess Taiping's associates might harm him, and he spoke to a close associate, [[Zhang Yue (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Shuo]], stating: \"A powerful individual did not want me to have many sons.  I am afraid that this woman would become a target.  What do you think?\"  Li Longji began to prepare an herbal stew that, in [[traditional Chinese medicine]], was believed to be able to induce an [[abortion]], but as he did so, fell asleep and had a dream that a god descended and overturned the ''[[ding (vessel)|ding]]'' holding the stew.  When he told Zhang this as well, Zhang responded, \"This is heaven's will.  You should not worry.\"<ref name=BT52>''Old Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u537752|vol. 52]].</ref>  (As a result, later on in life, Li Sisheng would feel personally indebted to Zhang Shuo.)<ref>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377220|vol. 220]].</ref>\n\nIn 712, Emperor Ruizong passed the throne to Li Longji, who took the throne as Emperor Xuanzong, but Emperor Ruizong retained actual power as ''[[Taishang Huang]]'' (retired emperor).  Shortly after Emperor Xuanzong took the throne, Emperor Ruizong, as retired emperor, was the one who created Li Sisheng the Prince of Shan.  (After Emperor Xuanzong suppressed Princess Taiping's associates in 713 and forced her to commit suicide, Emperor Ruizong transferred imperial authorities to Emperor Xuanzong and was no longer involved in politics.)  Li Siqian, whose mother Consort Zhao was then Emperor Xuanzong's favorite concubine, was created crown prince.  Li Sisheng, although his mother alive, was raised by Emperor Xuanzong's wife [[Empress Wang (Xuanzong)|Empress Wang]], who was herself sonless.<ref name=BT52/>  It was said that in his childhood, he was kind and studious, and Emperor Xuanzong was pleased with him.  Emperor Xuanzong thus made the officials He Zhizhang (\u8cc0\u77e5\u7ae0), Pan Su (\u6f58\u8085), L\u00fc Xiang (\u5442\u5411), Huangfu Bin (\u7687\u752b\u5f6c), and Xing Su (\u90a2\u74b9) accompany him in his studies.\n\nIn 724, due to the machinations of [[Consort Wu]], who had by then become Emperor Xuanzong's favorite concubine, Empress Wang was deposed, and she died shortly after.<ref>''Old Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u537751|vol. 51]].</ref>  Thereafter, Consort Wu began a campaign, in association with the [[chancellor of the Tang dynasty|chancellor]] [[Li Linfu]], to have her own son Li Qing the Prince of Shou made crown prince, but was not able to initially succeed.  Meanwhile, in 726, Li Sisheng's title was changed to the Prince of Zhong, and his name was changed to Li Jun.  In 728, his own mother Consort Yang Guipin died.<ref name=BT52/>\n\nIn 729, when there was a [[Khitan people|Khitan]] and [[Kumo Xi]] incursion, Li Jun was put in titular command of the army sent to repel the Khitan and the Xi, with Emperor Xuanzong's second cousin Li Hui (\u674e\u8918) the Prince of Xin'an in actual command of the army.  After Li Hui defeated the Khitan and the Xi, Li Jun was nevertheless rewarded with the honorific title of ''Situ'' (\u53f8\u5f92), one of the [[Three Ducal Ministers]].  In 735, his name was changed to Li Yu.\n\nIn 737, due to the machinations of Consort Wu, Li Ying, along with his brothers Li Yao (\u674e\u7464) the Prince of E and Li Ju (\u674e\u741a) the Prince of Guang, was accused of crimes, deposed, and forced to commit suicide.  Consort Wu and Li Linfu continued to lobby for Li Qing (whose name had been changed to Li Mao at this point) to be created crown prince, but with Consort Wu having died herself later in 737 and Emperor Xuanzong believing that Li Yu was capable, he hesitated.  At the urging of the eunuch [[Gao Lishi]], who believed that one of his older sons should be made crown prince, Emperor Xuanzong created Li Yu crown prince in 738 and renamed him Li Shao.  (As it was quickly pointed out that he thus shared a name with the [[Liu Song]] crown prince [[Liu Shao (Liu Song)|Liu Shao]], who killed his father and usurped the throne, his name was then quickly changed to Li Heng and would not change again thereafter.)  One of his consorts, Consort Wei, the sister of the official Wei Jian (\u97cb\u5805), was created crown princess.\n\n== As crown prince ==\n[[File:S407 Qianyuan SuZong (7243234232).jpg|thumb|\"Qianyuan SuZong\" during Suzong Emperor]]\nAs Li Heng's ascension to be crown prince was against Li Linfu's wishes, and also because Wei Jian, who drew favor from Emperor Xuanzong due to his abilities to increase revenues for the imperial treasury, was becoming a rival to Li Linfu at court, Li Linfu looked for ways to incriminate both Wei and Li Heng.  In 746, when the official Yang Shenjin (\u694a\u614e\u77dc), at Li Linfu's instigation, reported to Emperor Xuanzong that, one night, Li Heng met Wei while both were sightseeing, and shortly after, Wei met a friend of his, the general Huangfu Weiming (\u7687\u752b\u60df\u660e) at a [[Taoist temple]], Li Linfu used these incidents to accuse Wei and Huangfu of secretly pledging allegiance to Li Heng and planning to remove Emperor Xuanzong to replace him with Li Heng.  Wei and Huangfu were arrested and interrogated by Yang, Wang Hong (\u738b\u9277), and Ji Wen (\u5409\u6eab), but Emperor Xuanzong, who did not want the case to further explode into a major incident although he believed Li Linfu's accusations, demoted Wei and Huangfu out of the capital and, for the time being, stopped the investigation.  However, when Wei Jian's brothers Wei Lan (\u97cb\u862d) and Wei Zhi (\u97cb\u829d) submitted a defense of their brother Wei Jian later in 746\u2014and the defense cited words from Li Heng\u2014Emperor Xuanzong was incensed.  Li Heng, in fear, divorced Crown Princess Wei and asked for the Wei brothers to be punished.  The Wei brothers, along with a number of their associates\u2014including the former chancellor [[Li Shizhi]], Wei Bin (\u97cb\u658c), Wei Jian's nephew Li Quan (\u674e\u7404) the Prince of Xue, Pei Kuan (\u88f4\u5bec), and Li Qiwu (\u674e\u9f4a\u7269), were all demoted.  (In 747, at Li Linfu's instigation, the Wei brothers, Huangfu, and Li Shizhi were all forced to commit suicide.)\n\nLater in 746, yet another incident again nearly brought disaster to Li Heng.  One of Li Heng's other consorts, Consort Du, was a daughter of the official Du Youlin (\u675c\u6709\u9130).  Consort Du's brother-in-law Liu Ji (\u67f3\u52e3) had a dispute with the Du family and falsely accused them of using witchcraft in favor of Li Heng.  Li Linfu had Ji Wen interrogate Liu, and Ji implicated Liu in the alleged plot as well.  Du Youlin, Liu, and Liu's friend Wang Zeng (\u738b\u66fe) were all caned to death, and Li Heng felt compelled to expel Consort Du from the household as well.  Li Linfu also used this case to have two other officials friendly with Liu, Li Yong (\u674e\u9095) and Pei Dunfu (\u88f4\u6566\u5fa9), executed by caning.\n\nIn 747, when one of Emperor Xuanzong's favorite generals, [[An Lushan]], visited the capital [[Chang'an]] to pay respect to Emperor Xuanzong, An, who was not [[Han Chinese|Han]], initially refused to bow to Li Heng\u2014pretending that he was only loyal to Emperor Xuanzong and to no one else, including the crown prince, and that he did not even know what a crown prince was.  Only after Emperor Xuanzong explained what a crown prince is\u2014the reserve emperor, to succeed him later\u2014was An willing to bow to Li Heng.  This caused Emperor Xuanzong to favor An even more, but also later caused An to be apprehensive of whether Li Heng would bear continued resentment toward him over the incident.\n\nLater in 747, Li Linfu tried to use yet another case to undermine Li Heng.  The general [[Wang Zhongsi]], who was raised with Li Heng inside the palace on account of the fact that his father Wang Haibin (\u738b\u6d77\u8cd3) had died in battle in service to the empire, was accused of interfering with the campaign of another general, Dong Yan'guang (\u8463\u5ef6\u5149), against [[Tibetan Empire]].  Li Linfu broadened the accusation to an accusation that Wang was planning to start a coup to overthrow Emperor Xuanzong and replace him with Li Heng.  At the intercession of another general, [[Geshu Han]], however, Wang was spared from death, and Li Heng was not implicated.  It was said that during this time period, Li Linfu made other attempts to undermine Li Heng, but with Gao Lishi and Zhang Shuo's son Zhang Ji (\u5f35\u578d), who had married Li Heng's sister Princess Ningqing, protecting Li Heng, Li Heng escaped unharmed each time.\n\nAs of 754, the chancellor in power was [[Yang Guozhong]] (Li Linfu having died in 752), the cousin of Emperor Xuanzong's then-favorite concubine [[Yang Guifei]] (unrelated to Li Heng's mother).  Yang Guozhong and An were locked in a power struggle, and Yang repeatedly accused An of plotting a rebellion, but Emperor Xuanzong would not believe it, although Li Heng eventually came to agree with Yang Guozhong.  In late 755, with Yang Guozhong repeatedly trying to provoke An into a rebellion, An finally did, from his base at Fanyang (\u8303\u967d, in modern [[Beijing]]).  After the rebellion started, Emperor Xuanzong briefly considered making Li Heng [[regent]], but at the pleas of Consort Yang and her three sisters (who were fearful that Li Heng would act against them if he had regent powers), did not actually do so.\n\nBy summer 756, An had declared a new state of [[Yan (An\u2013Shi)|Yan]] as its emperor, and his forces were approaching Chang'an.  on July 14, 756,<ref>[http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna=%AD%F0&king=%A5%C8%A9v&reign=%A4%D1%C4_&yy=15&ycanzi=&mm=6&dd=13&dcanzi=]{{dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref> Emperor Xuanzong, with Yang Guozhong suggesting that they flee to Jiannan Circuit (\u528d\u5357, headquartered in modern [[Chengdu]]), abandoned Chang'an and fled with Gao Lishi, Yang Guozhong, Wei, Li Heng, Consort Yang, and her family. The following day, July 15, the imperial guards accompanying the emperor, angry at Yang Guozhong, rose at Mawei Station (\u99ac\u5d6c, in modern [[Baoji]], [[Shaanxi]]) and killed him and forced Emperor Xuanzong to kill Consort Yang as well.  Emperor Xuanzong then poised to continue to head toward Jiannan.  The people in the Mawei region tried to persuade Emperor Xuanzong not to continue on\u2014believing that Chang'an could be recaptured.  Emperor Xuanzong asked Li Heng to try to comfort the people.  Once Li Heng left Emperor Xuanzong's presence, however, Li Fuguo and Li Heng's sons [[Li Tan]] the Prince of Jianning and [[Emperor Daizong of Tang|Li Chu]] the Prince of Guangping, persuaded Li Heng not to follow Emperor Xuanzong to Jiannan\u2014arguing that with the physical barriers between Chang'an and Jiannan, that once they had left the region, Chang'an could no longer be captured.  Li Heng agreed and had Li Chu report this to Emperor Xuanzong.  Emperor Xuanzong agreed with Li Heng's decision, but he himself continued on to Jiannan.  Li Heng, escorted by a small number of guard soldiers commanded by Li Tan, then headed to the border city of [[Lingwu]].  With the army at Lingwu pressuring him to take imperial title, Li Heng declared himself emperor on August 13 (as Emperor Suzong).<ref name=startreign/>  When news of this reached Emperor Xuanzong in Jiannan, Emperor Xuanzong recognized Emperor Suzong as emperor and took the title of ''[[Taishang Huang]]'' (retired emperor), although he continued to exercise some imperial authority\u2014including, for example, issuing an edict that posthumously honored Emperor Suzong's mother Consort Yang as Empress Yuanxian.  (Some historians, including the modern historian [[Bo Yang]], believed that Emperor Xuanzong's continued issuance of edicts, while not on the surface conflicting with Emperor Suzong's authority, caused Emperor Suzong pressure to try to recapture Chang'an as quickly as possible to avoid any contention for the throne\u2014either in the form of Emperor Xuanzong himself resuming imperial authority or in the form of another imperial prince rising to defeat Yan.<ref>''[[Bo Yang]] Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian'', vol. 53 [757].</ref>)\n\n== Reign ==\n[[File:Tang Suzong.jpg|thumb|left|\"Greeting the Emperor at Wangxian\" \u671b\u8ce2\u8fce\u99d5\u5716, probably a 13th-century painting, detail of Tang Suzong.]]\nEmperor Suzong, once he became emperor, set his eyes on recapturing Chang'an from Yan forces, as Yan forces faced heavy resistance from the people of the [[Guanzhong]] region (i.e., the region around Chang'an) and was not able to keep the region under firm control.  (By this point, An Lushan had been assassinated and succeeded by his son [[An Qingxu]], as the emperor of Yan.)  However, an immediate attempt to do so, commanded by the chancellor [[Fang Guan]], was defeated by the Yan forces near Chang'an with heavy losses.  Meanwhile, around the same time, Emperor Suzong's brother [[Li Lin (prince)|Li Lin]] the Prince of Yong tried to mount a challenge against him, seeking to effectively secede with the region south of the [[Yangtze River]], but was quickly defeated and killed by forces loyal to Emperor Suzong.  Emperor Suzong's court was also itself filled with internal struggles, with Li Fuguo aligned with Emperor Suzong's favorite concubine [[Empress Zhang (Tang dynasty)|Consort Zhang]], in opposition to Li Chu, Li Tan, and Emperor Suzong's trusted advisor [[Li Mi (chancellor)|Li Mi]].  In early 757, after Li Tan repeatedly accused Li Fuguo and Consort Zhang of corruption, Li Fuguo and Empress Zhang in turn falsely accused him of trying to assassinate Li Chu, who was older than he was, in order to become the heir.  Emperor Suzong, in anger, ordered Li Tan to commit suicide, which drew fear from Li Chu and Li Mi.  Li Chu considered assassinating Li Fuguo and Consort Zhang, but at Li Mi's urging, stopped his plans to do so.\n\nEmperor Suzong, finding it difficult to recapture Chang'an just with his own troops, then entered into an alliance with [[Huige]]'s [[Bayanchur Khan]] Yaoluoge Moyanchuo, where Huige forces arrived at Emperor Suzong's then-headquarters at Fengxiang (\u9cf3\u7fd4, in modern Baoji) to join the elite Tang forces recalled from the Anxi Circuit and the [[Western Regions]] (''Xiyu'').  (Emperor Suzong did so by promising that the Huige forces would be permitted to pillage the Chnag'an region once it was recaptured.)  Li Mi suggested that these forces be used to attack Yan's power base at Fanyang first, to root out the possibility of a Yan recovery.  Emperor Suzong chose not to do so and decided to attack Chang'an first, with Li Chu in command of the joint forces.  The forces recaptured Chang'an in fall 757, allowing Emperor Suzong to rebuild his administration in the capital. (Huige forces were set to pillage Chang'an, but Li Chu bowed to the Huige prince commanding Huige forces to plead to delay the pillage\u2014pointing out that if pillaging were carried out, the people of the eastern capital [[Luoyang]], then serving as Yan's capital, would resist heavily, and asking that Huige pillage ''Luoyang'' instead.  The Huige prince agreed.)  After Emperor Suzong recaptured Chang'an, Li Mi resigned and became a [[hermit]], leaving Li Fuguo, Consort Zhang (who was then created empress), and Li Chu the lead figures at court, and Li Fuguo, in command of the imperial guards, would soon have such paramount powers that even Emperor Suzong was afraid of offending him.  Empress Zhang, meanwhile, wanted to make her son Li Shao (\u674e\u4f4b) crown prince, but Emperor Suzong, believing Li Chu, who was his oldest son, to be capable and accomplished, created him crown prince instead and changed his name to Li Yu.  Emperor Suzong also welcomed Emperor Xuanzong back from Jiannan and housed him at a palace converted from Emperor Xuanzong's old residence as an imperial prince, Xingqing Palace (\u8208\u6176\u5bae).\n\nA month after Chang'an was recaptured, Tang and Huige forces recaptured Luoyang as well, and Luoyang suffered heavy pillaging by Huige forces.<ref>Bo Yang, ''Outlines of the History of the Chinese'' (\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba\u53f2\u7db1), vol. 2, p. 549.</ref>  An Qingxu fled to [[Ye, China|Yecheng]] and took up position there, but most Yan territory resubmitted to Tang, and war appeared to be poised to end.  To cement the alliance with Huige, Emperor Suzong also gave his daughter Princess Ningguo in marriage to Yaoluoge Moyanchuo.\n\nIn 758, however, one of the major Yan generals who had submitted to Tang, [[Shi Siming]], claiming that there had been a plot by Emperor Suzong and the Tang general [[Li Guangbi]], to have his subordinate Wu Cheng'en (\u70cf\u627f\u6069) assassinate him, re-rebelled and advanced south.  In spring 759, he engaged the Tang forces then sieging An Qingxu at Yecheng, and while the initial battle was indecisive, the Tang forces panicked during the battle and collapsed, allowing the siege of Yecheng to be lifted.  Shi Siming then led An Qingxu into a trap and killed him, taking over as the emperor of Yan and further advancing south to recapture Luoyang, again making it Yan's capital.  However, his further attempts to advance against Chang'an was blocked by Li Guangbi, and the Yan and Tang forces went into a stalemate.  While the stalemate was continuing, in 760, after the eunuch Xing Yan'en (\u90a2\u5ef6\u6069) reported to Emperor Suzong that the general Liu Zhan (\u5289\u5c55) was disobeying orders, and that Liu's name was in mystical prophecies, Emperor Suzong accepted Xing's suggestion to find a way to eliminate Liu.  After Liu found this out, he was forced into rebellion in late 760; he had successes against other Tang generals and controlled the lower Yangtze region for several months until he was defeated by another Tang general, Tian Shen'gong (\u7530\u795e\u529f).\n\nMeanwhile, Emperor Xuanzong settled into a routine at Xingqing Palace, with Chen Xuanli (\u9673\u7384\u79ae) and Gao Lishi attending to him. Also often attending to him were his sister Li Chiying (\u674e\u6301\u76c8) the Princess Yuzhen, the [[lady-in-waiting]] Ru Xianyuan (\u5982\u4ed9\u5a9b), and the eunuchs Wang Cheng'en (\u738b\u627f\u6069) and Wei Yue (\u9b4f\u6085).  The imperial musicians often played for him, and he often climbed up Changqing Tower (\u9577\u6176\u6a13) to receive well wishes from the populace.  He also often held feasts for generals and people from Jiannan, with Li Chiying and Ru serving as hostesses.  Emperor Xuanzong's attendants looked down at Li Fuguo. To retaliate, Li Fuguo began to try to convince Emperor Suzong that Emperor Xuanzong and his attendants were plotting to seize power back.  In 760, with Emperor Suzong's tacit, although not explicit, approval, on one occasion when Emperor Xuanzong was out riding, Li Fuguo intercepted him and forced him to move back to the main palace.  Even on that occasion, however, Gao would not submit to Li Fuguo, and even yelled at Li Fuguo to force him to get off his horse and to escort Emperor Xuanzong on foot, along with Gao.  Soon after Emperor Xuanzong was forcibly moved, Li Fuguo forced Chen to retire, Li Chiying to return to her temple (she had become an ordained [[Daoism|Daoist nun]] in 711), and exiled Gao, Wang, Wei, and Ru.  Emperor Suzong then had his daughters Princesses Wan'an and Xianyi attend to Emperor Xuanzong, but Emperor Xuanzong, having lost his trusted attendants, became silent and ill.  For the time being, Emperor Suzong frequently visited Emperor Xuanzong, but he himself grew ill as well and rarely visited.  He also regretted permitting Li Fuguo to take these actions and considered killing him, but hesitated and ultimately did not do so because Li Fuguo commanded the imperial guards.  Indeed, thereafter, Li Fuguo became minister of defense, and Emperor Suzong was often forced to comply with his wishes as far as governance was concerned, although Emperor Suzong rebuffed his wishes to become chancellor.\n\nIn 761, Shi Siming was assassinated and succeeded by his son [[Shi Chaoyi]], and it was said that other Yan generals, who were originally Shi Siming's equals, began to disobey Shi Chaoyi's orders.  Tang forces thus were able to beat back the Yan forces, but were not able to dislodge Shi Huaiyi from Luoyang, and final victory over Yan would not come in Emperor Suzong's lifetime.\n\nIn summer 762, Emperor Xuanzong died.  Emperor Suzong was himself bedridden by this point, and it was said that he was so saddened by Emperor Xuanzong's death that his illness further advanced.  He thus granted [[regent]] powers on Li Yu.  By this point, Empress Zhang and Li Fuguo were no longer allies, and Empress Zhang summoned Li Yu, wanting an alliance with him to kill Li Fuguo and his subordinate [[Cheng Yuanzhen]].  Li Yu refused, pointing out that this would cause alarm to the very-ill Emperor Suzong.  Empress Zhang then entered into an alliance with Li Yu's younger brother Li Xi (\u674e\u4fc2) the Prince of Yue, and they tried to set a trap for Li Fuguo, with 200 strong eunuchs loyal to her and Li Xi ready to act against Li Fuguo.  On May 14, 762,<ref>[http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna=%AD%F0&king=%B5%C2%A9v&reign=%C4_%C0%B3&yy=1&ycanzi=&mm=4&dd=16&dcanzi=]{{dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref> she issued an order in Emperor Suzong's name, summoning Li Yu into the palace.  However, Cheng received this news and reported this to Li Fuguo and Li Yu, and Cheng then escorted Li Yu to the imperial guard headquarters.  Imperial guards commanded by Li Fuguo and Cheng then entered the palace and arrested Empress Zhang, Li Xi, and their associates.  It was said that with Emperor Suzong resting at Changsheng Hall (\u9577\u751f\u6bbf), the soldiers dragged Empress Zhang and the attending ladies in waiting and eunuchs away from his presence.  Emperor Suzong was said to be left alone without attendants.  He died on May 16, only 13 days after Emperor Xuanzong's death.<ref name=death/>  Li Fuguo executed Empress Zhang, Li Xi, and Li Xian (\u674e\u50e9) the Prince of Yan and then declared Li Yu emperor (as Emperor Daizong).\n\n===Relations with Muslims===\nFaced with the devastating [[An Lushan Rebellion]], Emperor Suzong of Tang wrote a desperate letter to [[Al-Mansur]] requesting for armed assistance. [[Al-Mansur]] responded by sending 4000 men to China in order to aid Emperor Suzong of Tang. In return they were allowed to settle down permanently in China after the rebellion was repressed. Some of them married local Chinese people. This helped in founding of the earliest Muslim communities of China.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5LSvkQvvmAMC&pg=PA283&dq=arab+mercenaries+china&q=arab%20mercenaries%20china|title=The religious traditions of Asia: religion, history, and culture|author=Joseph Mitsuo Kitagawa|editor=Joseph Mitsuo Kitagawa|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|edition=2, illustrated|location=|page=283|isbn=978-0-7007-1762-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqkeAAAAIAAJ&q=arab+mercenaries+china&dq=arab+mercenaries+china|title=China: a short cultural history|author=Charles Patrick Fitzgerald|year=1961|publisher=Praeger|edition=3|page=332}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oLnXAAAAMAAJ&dq=abu+giafar+chinese&q=China+%E2%80%A2+Arab+troops+were+dispatched+by+Abu+Gia-+far+to+China.|title=The Muslim diaspora: a comprehensive reference to the spread of Islam in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas|author=Everett Jenkins|accessdate= |series= |volume=1 |date= |year=1999 |edition=illustrated |publisher=McFarland |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-7864-0431-5|page=61 |pages= |quote=Arab troops were dispatched by Abu Gia-far to China.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvtwAAAAMAAJ&dq=abu+giafar+chinese&q=abu+giafar|title=Embers in Cathay|author=Stanley Ghosh|accessdate= |edition=|series= |volume= |date= |year=1961 |publisher=Doubleday |location= |language= |isbn=|page=60 |pages= |quote=During the reign of Abbassid Caliph Abu Giafar in the middle of the 8th century, many Arab soldiers evidently settled near the garrisons on the Chinese frontier.}}</ref>\n\n== Chancellors during reign ==\n* [[Wei Jiansu]] (756\u2013757)\n* [[Cui Yuan (705\u2013768)|Cui Yuan]] (756\u2013758)\n* [[Fang Guan]] (756\u2013757)\n* [[Pei Mian]] (756\u2013757)\n* [[Cui Huan]] (756\u2013757)\n* [[Li Lin (Tang chancellor)|Li Lin]] (757\u2013758)\n* [[Miao Jinqing]] (757\u2013759, 760\u2013762)\n* [[Zhang Gao]] (757\u2013758)\n* [[Wang Yu (chancellor)|Wang Yu]] (758\u2013759)\n* [[L\u00fc Yin]] (759, 759\u2013760)\n* [[Li Xian (chancellor)|Li Xian]] (759)\n* [[Li Kui (chancellor)|Li Kui]] (759\u2013761)\n* [[Diwu Qi]] (759)\n* [[Xiao Hua (Tang dynasty)|Xiao Hua]] (761\u2013762)\n* [[Pei Zunqing]] (761\u2013762)\n* [[Yuan Zai]] (762)\n\n==Family==\n* Parents:\n** [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Li Longji]], Xuanzong ({{lang|zh|\u7384\u5b97 \u674e\u9686\u57fa}};

The [[Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York|New York City medical examiner]] ruled Epstein's death a suicide by hanging, however, Epstein's lawyers challenged that conclusion and opened their own investigation.
