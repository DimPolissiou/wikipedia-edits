Because of its privileged location in the [[Eastern Carpathians|Eastern Carpathian]] mountains, it is considered one of the most [[picturesque]] cities in Romania. The [[Nord-Est (development region)|''Nord-Est'' Regional Development Agency]] is located in Piatra Neam\u021b.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe ''piatra'' [[toponym]] (meaning ''[[rock (geology)|rock]]'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]) was always part of the settlement's name throughout its history. Other names that the city has been called are: '''Piatra lui Cr\u0103ciun''' (Christmas Rock, thus also corresponding to the Hungarian name of the city, \"Kar\u00e1cson-K\u0151\"); '''T\u00e2rgu Piatra''' (Rock Fair, Rock Market) (in the [[Middle Ages]]) or simply '''Piatra''' to which the county name '''[[Neam\u021b County|Neam\u021b]]''' was added.\n\n== Geography and access ==\n\nPiatra Neam\u021b lies in the [[Bistri\u021ba River (Siret)|Bistri\u021ba River]] Valley, surrounded by mountains - Pietricica (530 m), Cozla (679 m), Cernegura (852 m), B\u00e2tca Doamnei (462 m) and C\u00e2rloman (617 m), at an average height of {{convert|345|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}.\n\nThe city is located {{convert|350|km|0|abbr=off}} north of [[Bucharest]], in the historical region of [[Moldavia]]. The nearest airport is [[Bac\u0103u International Airport|Bac\u0103u]], situated {{convert|60|km|0|abbr=in}} south. Piatra Neam\u021b is linked by Romanian railway trunk number 509 to [[Bac\u0103u]] (therefore by 500 to Bucharest), and by DN15 national road to Bac\u0103u (therefore by [[DN2]] to Bucharest), Ia\u0219i, [[Suceava]], and [[T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]] ([[Transylvania]]).\n[[File:pnt map.svg|thumb|right|Map of Piatra Neam\u021b]]\n[[File:Piatra Neamt - Top Of Mt. Cozla 1 (lake).JPG|thumb|270px|B\u00e2tca Doamnei lake]]\n\nThe city is informally divided in several districts (in Romanian: ''cartiere''):\n* 1 Mai\n* B\u0103cioaia\n* Centru\n* Ciritei\n* D\u0103rm\u0103ne\u0219ti\n* Doamna\n* Gara Veche\n* M\u0103r\u0103\u021bei\n* Precista\n* Sarata\n* Speran\u021ba\n* Valea Viei\n* V\u0103leni\n* V\u00e2n\u0103tori\n\nOf these, Ciritei, Doamna and V\u0103leni are formally separate villages administered by the municipality. There are plans to build two new districts, the larger of which will be on the site of the former ''Reconstruc\u021bia'' factory.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Stephen's Tower in Piatra Neam\u0163, Romania.jpg|thumb|left|270px|[[Nativity of St. John the Baptist Church, Piatra Neam\u021b|Stephen's Tower]] built in 1499]]\nThe area around Piatra Neam\u021b is one of the oldest inhabited areas in Romania. The oldest traces of human civilisation in the present territory date back to the higher [[Paleolithic]], about 100,000 years BCE. The [[Cucuteni culture]], whose development lasted approximately one thousand years (ca. 3600-2600 BCE) was attested in the territory of Neam\u0163 county by a remarkable number of settlements (approx. 150), archaeological diggings unearthing important museum collections of [[Chalcolithic|Aeneolithic]] artifacts. Archaeologists have also discovered objects here dating back to the Neolithic Period and the [[Bronze Age]] (about 1900-1700 BCE).\n\nExcavations just outside the city revealed the ruins of a large [[Dacia]]n city, Petrodava, mentioned by Greek geographer [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century. The whole compound had its heyday between the first century BCE and the first century CE. Standing out is the citadel at [[B\u00e2tca Doamnei]] which contains shrines resembling those identified in the [[Dacian Fortresses of the Orastie Mountains|Or\u0103\u0219tiei Mountains]]. As far as the existence of a local leader is concerned, historians tend to suggest the identification of the Kingdom of Dicomes in the very political centre at Petrodava. The complex of strongholds without peer in Moldavia and [[Wallachia]] is evidence as to a powerful political and military centre both in [[Burebista]]\u2019s time and in the period that preceded the reign of [[Decebalus]]. The settlement was documented in the 15th century as Piatra lui Craciun, or Camena, a [[market town]].\n\nThe first urban settlements, which emerged under [[Petru I of Moldova|Petru I Mu\u0219at]] (1375\u20131391), were Piatra lui Craciun, [[Roman, Romania|Roman]] and Neam\u021b. The [[Neam\u021b citadel]], whose documentary attestation dates back to February 2, 1395, was also erected during the same consolidation period of the Moldovian principality east of the Carpathians. The Princely Court of Piatra Neam\u021b is mentioned for the first time in a document dated April 20, 1491, to have been founded between 1468 and 1475, under [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]], the Princely Cathedral being built in 1497\u20131498, and the {{convert|20|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} tall Bell Tower in 1499.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1912 |18965\n|1930 |29827\n|1948 |26303\n|1956 |32648\n|1966 |45852\n|1977 |77812\n|1992 |123360\n|2002 |104914\n|2011 |85055\n}}\n\nAs of [[Demographic history of Romania|2011 census]] data, Piatra Neam\u021b has a population of 85,055,<ref name=\"INSSER\">{{cite web | url = http://www.neamt.insse.ro/cmsneamt/rw/resource/date%20provizorii%20rpl%202011%20neamt.pdf | title = 2011 Census | date = February 2, 2012 | accessdate = March 12, 2012 | publisher = [[National Institute of Statistics (Romania)|INSSE]] | language = Romanian}}</ref> a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census, making it the 24th [[List of cities and towns in Romania|largest city]] in Romania.\n\nAccording to the census from 2002, there were 104,914 people living within the city of Piatra Neam\u021b.<ref name=\"census\">{{cite web | url = http://www.edrc.ro/recensamant.jsp?regiune_id=1&judet_id=253&localitate_id=254 | title = Ethno-demographic Structure of Romania | accessdate = January 2, 2011 | publisher = The Ethnocultural Diversity Resource Center }}</ref> The ethnic makeup was as follows:\n\n* [[Romanians]]: 98.08%\n* [[Romani people|Roma]]: 1.3%\n* [[Lipovans]]: 0.16%\n* [[Hungarians]]: 0.14%\n* Other: 0.32%\n\n==Economy==\n\nThe city's industries include a fertilizer plant, a pulp and paper mill, and several food-processing plants.

There are plans to build two new districts, the larger of which will be on the site of the former ''Reconstruc\u021bia'' factory.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Stephen's Tower in Piatra Neam\u0163, Romania.jpg|thumb|left|270px|[[Nativity of St. John the Baptist Church, Piatra Neam\u021b|Stephen's Tower]] built in 1499]]\nThe area around Piatra Neam\u021b is one of the oldest inhabited areas in Romania. The oldest traces of human civilisation in the present territory date back to the higher [[Paleolithic]], about 100,000 years BCE. The [[Cucuteni culture]], whose development lasted approximately one thousand years (ca. 3600-2600 BCE) was attested in the territory of Neam\u0163 county by a remarkable number of settlements (approx. 150), archaeological diggings unearthing important museum collections of [[Chalcolithic|Aeneolithic]] artifacts. Archaeologists have also discovered objects here dating back to the Neolithic Period and the [[Bronze Age]] (about 1900-1700 BCE).\n\nExcavations just outside the city revealed the ruins of a large [[Dacia]]n city, Petrodava, mentioned by Greek geographer [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century. The whole compound had its heyday between the first century BCE and the first century CE. Standing out is the citadel at [[B\u00e2tca Doamnei]] which contains shrines resembling those identified in the [[Dacian Fortresses of the Orastie Mountains|Or\u0103\u0219tiei Mountains]]. As far as the existence of a local leader is concerned, historians tend to suggest the identification of the Kingdom of Dicomes in the very political centre at Petrodava. The complex of strongholds without peer in Moldavia and [[Wallachia]] is evidence as to a powerful political and military centre both in [[Burebista]]\u2019s time and in the period that preceded the reign of [[Decebalus]]. The settlement was documented in the 15th century as Piatra lui Craciun, or Camena, a [[market town]].\n\nThe first urban settlements, which emerged under [[Petru I of Moldova|Petru I Mu\u0219at]] (1375\u20131391), were Piatra lui Craciun, [[Roman, Romania|Roman]] and Neam\u021b. The [[Neam\u021b citadel]], whose documentary attestation dates back to February 2, 1395, was also erected during the same consolidation period of the Moldovian principality east of the Carpathians. The Princely Court of Piatra Neam\u021b is mentioned for the first time in a document dated April 20, 1491, to have been founded between 1468 and 1475, under [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]], the Princely Cathedral being built in 1497-1498, and the {{convert|20|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} tall Bell Tower in 1499.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1912 |18965\n|1930 |29827\n|1948 |26303\n|1956 |32648\n|1966 |45852\n|1977 |77812\n|1992 |123360\n|2002 |104914\n|2011 |85055\n}}\n\nAs of [[Demographic history of Romania|2011 census]] data, Piatra Neam\u021b has a population of 85,055,<ref name=\"INSSER\">{{cite web | url = http://www.neamt.insse.ro/cmsneamt/rw/resource/date%20provizorii%20rpl%202011%20neamt.pdf | title = 2011 Census | date = February 2, 2012 | accessdate = March 12, 2012 | publisher = [[National Institute of Statistics (Romania)|INSSE]] | language = Romanian}}</ref> a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census, making it the 24th [[List of cities and towns in Romania|largest city]] in Romania.\n\nAccording to the census from 2002, there were 104,914 people living within the city of Piatra Neam\u021b.<ref name=\"census\">{{cite web | url = http://www.edrc.ro/recensamant.jsp?regiune_id=1&judet_id=253&localitate_id=254 | title = Ethno-demographic Structure of Romania | accessdate = January 2, 2011 | publisher = The Ethnocultural Diversity Resource Center }}</ref> The ethnic makeup was as follows:\n\n* [[Romanians]]: 98.08%\n* [[Romani people|Roma]]: 1.3%\n* [[Lipovans]]: 0.16%\n* [[Hungarians]]: 0.14%\n* Other: 0.32%\n\n==Economy==\n\nThe city's industries include a fertilizer plant, a pulp and paper mill, and several food-processing plants.

The goal of fine-art photography is to express an idea, a message, or an emotion. This stands in contrast to representational photography, such as photojournalism, which provides a documentary visual account of specific subjects and events, literally representing objective reality rather than the subjective intent of the photographer; and commercial photography, the primary focus of which is to advertise products, or services.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Aktikompositsioon 19 (J. K\u00fcnnap).jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[nudity]] has been one of the dominating themes in fine-art photography. ''Nude composition 19'' from 1988 by [[Jaan K\u00fcnnap]].]]\n\n=== Invention through 1940s ===\nOne photography historian claimed that \"the earliest exponent of 'Fine Art' or composition photography was [[John Jabez Edwin Mayall|John Edwin Mayall]], \"who exhibited [[daguerrotype]]s illustrating the [[Lord's Prayer]] in 1851\".<ref>Gernsheim, Helmut. ''Creative photography: aesthetic trends 1839-1960''. New York: Dover, 1991. {{ISBN|0-486-26750-4}}</ref>  Successful attempts to make fine art photography can be traced to [[Victorian era]] practitioners such as [[Julia Margaret Cameron]], [[Charles Lutwidge Dodgson]], and [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander]] and others.  In the U.S. [[F. Holland Day]], [[Alfred Stieglitz]] and [[Edward Steichen]] were instrumental in making photography a fine art, and Stieglitz was especially notable in introducing it into museum collections.\n\nIn the UK as recently as 1960, photography was not really recognised as a Fine Art. Dr [[S.D.Jouhar]] said, when he formed the Photographic Fine Art Association at that time  - ''\"At the moment photography is not generally recognized as anything more than a craft. In the USA photography has been openly accepted as Fine Art in certain official quarters. It is shown in galleries and exhibitions as an Art. There is not corresponding recognition in this country. The London Salon shows pictorial photography, but it is not generally understood as an art. Whether a work shows aesthetic qualities or not it is designated 'Pictorial Photography' which is a very ambiguous term. The photographer himself must have confidence in his work and in its dignity and aesthetic value, to force recognition as an Art rather than a Craft\"''\n\nUntil the late 1970s several genres predominated, such as nudes, portraits, and natural landscapes (exemplified by [[Ansel Adams]]). Breakthrough 'star' artists in the 1970s and 80s, such as [[Sally Mann]], [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], [[Robert Farber (photographer)|Robert Farber]] and [[Cindy Sherman]], still relied heavily on such [[genre]]s, although seeing them with fresh eyes. Others investigated a [[snapshot aesthetic]] approach.\n\nAmerican organizations, such as the [[Aperture (magazine)|Aperture Foundation]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]], have done much to keep photography at the forefront of the fine arts. MOMA's establishment of a department of photography in 1940 and appointment of [[Beaumont Newhall]] as its first curator are often cited as institutional confirmation of photography's status as an art.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Phillips |first1=Christopher |title=The Judgment Seat of Photography |journal=October |date=Autumn 1982 |volume=22 |doi=10.2307/778362 |jstor=778362 }}</ref>\n\n===1950s to present day===\n[[File:Gursky Shanghai.jpg|thumb|left|[[Andreas Gursky]], ''Shanghai'', 2000, C-print mounted to plexiglass, 119 x 81 inches]]\nThere is now a trend toward a careful staging and lighting of the picture, rather than hoping to \"discover\" it ready-made.  Photographers such as [[Gregory Crewdson]], and [[Jeff Wall]] are noted for the quality of their [[Tableaux Vivant|staged]] pictures.  Additionally, new technological trends in digital photography have opened a new direction in [[full spectrum photography]], where careful filtering choices across the ultraviolet, visible and infrared lead to new artistic visions.\n\nAs printing technologies have improved since around 1980, a photographer's art prints reproduced in a finely-printed limited-edition book have now become an area of strong interest to collectors.  This is because books usually have high production values, a short print run, and their limited market means they are almost never reprinted. The collector's market in photography books by individual photographers is developing rapidly.\n\nAccording to [https://web.archive.org/web/20101116174818/http://press.artprice.com/pdf/trends2004.pdf ''Art Market Trends 2004''] (PDF link) 7,000 photographs were sold in auction rooms in 2004, and photographs averaged a 7.6 [[percent]] annual price rise from 1994 and 2004.{{Failed verification|date=October 2008}} Around 80 percent were sold in the United States. Of course, auction sales only record a fraction of total private sales. There is now a thriving collectors' market for which the most sought-after art photographers will produce high quality archival prints in strictly limited editions. Attempts by online art retailers to sell fine photography to the general public alongside prints of paintings have had mixed results, with strong sales coming only from the traditional \"big names\" of photography such as Ansel Adams.\n\nIn addition to the \"digital movement\" towards manipulation, filtering, or resolution changes, some fine artists deliberately seek a \"naturalistic,\" including \"natural lighting\" as a value in itself. Sometimes the art work as in the case of [[Gerhard Richter]] consists of a photographic image that has been subsequently painted over with oil paints and/or contains some political or historical significance beyond the image itself. The existence of \"photographically-projected painting\" now blurs the line between painting and photography which traditionally was absolute.\n\n==Framing and print size==\nUntil the mid-1950s it was widely considered vulgar and pretentious to frame a photograph for a gallery exhibition. Prints were usually simply pasted onto blockboard or plywood, or given a white border in the darkroom and then pinned at the corners onto display boards. Prints were thus shown without any glass reflections obscuring them. Steichen's famous [[The Family of Man]] exhibition was unframed, the pictures pasted to panels. Even as late as 1966 [[Bill Brandt]]'s MoMA show was unframed, with simple prints pasted to thin plywood. From the mid-1950s to about 2000 most gallery exhibitions had prints behind glass. Since about 2000 there has been a noticeable move toward once again showing contemporary gallery prints on boards and without glass. In addition, throughout the twentieth century, there was a noticeable increase in the size of prints.\n\n[[File:Adams The Tetons and the Snake River.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ansel Adams]]' ''The Tetons and the Snake River'' (1942).]]\n\n==Politics==\nFine art photography is created primarily as an expression of the artist's vision, but as a byproduct it has also been important in advancing certain causes. The work of [[Ansel Adams]] in [[Yosemite]] and [[Yellowstone]] provides an example. Adams is one of the most widely recognized fine art photographers of the 20th century, and was an avid promoter of conservation. While his primary focus was on photography as art, some of his work raised public awareness of the beauty of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and helped to build political support for their protection.\n\nSuch photography has also had effects in the area of censorship law and free expression, due to its concern with the nude body.\n\n==Overlap with other genres==\nAlthough fine art photography may overlap with many other genres of photography, the overlaps with [[fashion photography]] and [[photojournalism]] merit special attention.\n\nIn 1996 it was stated that there had been a \"recent blurring of lines between commercial illustrative photography and fine art photography,\" especially in the area of fashion.<ref name=\"Bryant\">Bryant, Eric.

The goal of fine-art photography is to express an idea, a message, or an emotion. This stands in contrast to representational photography, such as photojournalism, which provides a documentary visual account of specific subjects and events, literally representing objective reality rather than the subjective intent of the photographer; and commercial photography, the primary focus of which is to advertise products, or services.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Aktikompositsioon 19 (J. K\u00fcnnap).jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[nudity]] has been one of the dominating themes in fine-art photography. ''Nude composition 19'' from 1988 by [[Jaan K\u00fcnnap]].]]\n\n=== Invention through 1940s ===\nOne photography historian claimed that \"the earliest exponent of 'Fine Art' or composition photography was [[John Jabez Edwin Mayall|John Edwin Mayall]], \"who exhibited [[daguerrotype]]s illustrating the [[Lord's Prayer]] in 1851\".<ref>Gernsheim, Helmut. ''Creative photography: aesthetic trends 1839-1960''. New York: Dover, 1991. {{ISBN|0-486-26750-4}}</ref>  Successful attempts to make fine art photography can be traced to [[Victorian era]] practitioners such as [[Julia Margaret Cameron]], [[Charles Lutwidge Dodgson]], and [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander]] and others.  In the U.S. [[F. Holland Day]], [[Alfred Stieglitz]] and [[Edward Steichen]] were instrumental in making photography a fine art, and Stieglitz was especially notable in introducing it into museum collections.\n\nIn the UK as recently as 1960, photography was not really recognised as a Fine Art. Dr [[S.D.Jouhar]] said, when he formed the Photographic Fine Art Association at that time  - ''\"At the moment photography is not generally recognized as anything more than a craft. In the USA photography has been openly accepted as Fine Art in certain official quarters. It is shown in galleries and exhibitions as an Art. There is not corresponding recognition in this country. The London Salon shows pictorial photography, but it is not generally understood as an art. Whether a work shows aesthetic qualities or not it is designated 'Pictorial Photography' which is a very ambiguous term. The photographer himself must have confidence in his work and in its dignity and aesthetic value, to force recognition as an Art rather than a Craft\"''\n\nUntil the late 1970s several genres predominated, such as nudes, portraits, and natural landscapes (exemplified by [[Ansel Adams]]). Breakthrough 'star' artists in the 1970s and 80s, such as [[Sally Mann]], [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], [[Robert Farber (photographer)|Robert Farber]] and [[Cindy Sherman]], still relied heavily on such [[genre]]s, although seeing them with fresh eyes. Others investigated a [[snapshot aesthetic]] approach.\n\nAmerican organizations, such as the [[Aperture (magazine)|Aperture Foundation]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]], have done much to keep photography at the forefront of the fine arts. MOMA's establishment of a department of photography in 1940 and appointment of [[Beaumont Newhall]] as its first curator are often cited as institutional confirmation of photography's status as an art.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Phillips |first1=Christopher |title=The Judgment Seat of Photography |journal=October |date=Autumn 1982 |volume=22 |doi=10.2307/778362 |jstor=778362 }}</ref>\n\n===1950s to present day===\n[[File:Gursky Shanghai.jpg|thumb|left|[[Andreas Gursky]], ''Shanghai'', 2000, C-print mounted to plexiglass, 119 x 81 inches]]\nThere is now a trend toward a careful staging and lighting of the picture, rather than hoping to \"discover\" it ready-made.  Photographers such as [[Gregory Crewdson]], and [[Jeff Wall]] are noted for the quality of their [[Tableaux Vivant|staged]] pictures.  Additionally, new technological trends in digital photography have opened a new direction in [[full spectrum photography]], where careful filtering choices across the ultraviolet, visible and infrared lead to new artistic visions.\n\nAs printing technologies have improved since around 1980, a photographer's art prints reproduced in a finely-printed limited-edition book have now become an area of strong interest to collectors.  This is because books usually have high production values, a short print run, and their limited market means they are almost never reprinted. The collector's market in photography books by individual photographers is developing rapidly.\n\nAccording to [https://web.archive.org/web/20101116174818/http://press.artprice.com/pdf/trends2004.pdf ''Art Market Trends 2004''] (PDF link) 7,000 photographs were sold in auction rooms in 2004, and photographs averaged a 7.6 [[percent]] annual price rise from 1994 and 2004.{{Failed verification|date=October 2008}} Around 80 percent were sold in the United States. Of course, auction sales only record a fraction of total private sales. There is now a thriving collectors' market for which the most sought-after art photographers will produce high quality archival prints in strictly limited editions. Attempts by online art retailers to sell fine photography to the general public alongside prints of paintings have had mixed results, with strong sales coming only from the traditional \"big names\" of photography such as Ansel Adams.\n\nIn addition to the \"digital movement\" towards manipulation, filtering, or resolution changes, some fine artists deliberately seek a \"naturalistic,\" including \"natural lighting\" as a value in itself. Sometimes the art work as in the case of [[Gerhard Richter]] consists of a photographic image that has been subsequently painted over with oil paints and/or contains some political or historical significance beyond the image itself. The existence of \"photographically-projected painting\" now blurs the line between painting and photography which traditionally was absolute.\n\n==Framing and print size==\nUntil the mid-1950s it was widely considered vulgar and pretentious to frame a photograph for a gallery exhibition. Prints were usually simply pasted onto blockboard or plywood, or given a white border in the darkroom and then pinned at the corners onto display boards. Prints were thus shown without any glass reflections obscuring them. Steichen's famous [[The Family of Man]] exhibition was unframed, the pictures pasted to panels. Even as late as 1966 [[Bill Brandt]]'s MoMA show was unframed, with simple prints pasted to thin plywood. From the mid-1950s to about 2000 most gallery exhibitions had prints behind glass. Since about 2000 there has been a noticeable move toward once again showing contemporary gallery prints on boards and without glass. In addition, throughout the twentieth century, there was a noticeable increase in the size of prints.\n\n[[File:Adams The Tetons and the Snake River.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ansel Adams]]' ''The Tetons and the Snake River'' (1942).]]\n\n==Politics==\nFine art photography is created primarily as an expression of the artist\u2019s vision, but as a byproduct it has also been important in advancing certain causes. The work of [[Ansel Adams]] in [[Yosemite]] and [[Yellowstone]] provides an example. Adams is one of the most widely recognized fine art photographers of the 20th century, and was an avid promoter of conservation. While his primary focus was on photography as art, some of his work raised public awareness of the beauty of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and helped to build political support for their protection.\n\nSuch photography has also had effects in the area of censorship law and free expression, due to its concern with the nude body.\n\n==Overlap with other genres==\nAlthough fine art photography may overlap with many other genres of photography, the overlaps with [[fashion photography]] and [[photojournalism]] merit special attention.\n\nIn 1996 it was stated that there had been a \"recent blurring of lines between commercial illustrative photography and fine art photography,\" especially in the area of fashion.<ref name=\"Bryant\">Bryant, Eric.

Although each version is essentially the same, several forms of [[regional lockout]] prevent the different cartridges from being compatible with one another.\n\nThe SNES is Nintendo's second programmable home console, following the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). The console introduced advanced graphics and sound capabilities compared with other systems at the time. The system was designed to accommodate the ongoing development of [[List of Super NES enhancement chips|a variety of enhancement chips]] integrated in [[ROM cartridge|game cartridges]] to be competitive into the next generation.\n\nThe SNES was a global success, becoming the best-selling console of the [[Fourth generation of video game consoles|16-bit era]] after launching relatively late and facing intense competition from [[Sega]]'s [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] console in North America and Europe. Overlapping the NES's 61.9 million unit sales, the SNES remained popular well into the [[Fifth generation of video game consoles|32-bit era]], with 49.1 million units sold worldwide by the time it was discontinued in 2003. It continues to be popular among collectors and [[Retrogaming|retro gamers]], with new [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] games and Nintendo's emulated rereleases, such as on the [[Virtual Console]], the [[Super NES Classic Edition]], and [[Nintendo Switch Online]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Super NES designs.png|thumb|Early concept designs for the SNES, referred to as the \"Nintendo Entertainment System 2\"]]\nTo compete with the popular [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] in Japan, [[NEC Corporation|NEC Home Electronics]] launched the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] in 1987, and [[Sega]] followed suit with the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] in 1988. The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Sega Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the [[Third generation of video game consoles\n|8-bit]] NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful.<ref>[[#CITEREFSheff1993|Sheff (1993)]], pp. 353\u2013356. \"The Genesis continued to flounder through its first couple of years on the market, although Sega showed Sisyphean resolve....

North American cartridges have a rectangular bottom with inset grooves matching protruding tabs in the console, while other regions' cartridges are narrower with a smooth curve on the front and no grooves. The physical incompatibility can be overcome with use of various adapters, or through [[modding|modification]] of the console.<ref name=\"palconverter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/07/soapbox_why_region_locking_is_a_total_non_issue|title=Soapbox: Why Region Locking Is A Total Non-Issue|author=Nintendo Life|work=Nintendo Life}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/df-hardware-the-ultimate-console-collectors-guide|title=The Ultimate Retro Console Collectors' Guide|date=May 6, 2012|work=Eurogamer.net}}</ref>\n\nInternally, a regional [[lockout chip]] ([[CIC (Nintendo)|CIC]]) within the console and in each cartridge prevents PAL region games from being played on Japanese or North American consoles and vice versa. The Japanese and North American machines have the same region chip. This can be overcome through the use of adapters, typically by inserting the imported cartridge in one slot and a cartridge with the correct region chip in a second slot. Alternatively, disconnecting one pin of the console's lockout chip will prevent it from locking the console; hardware in later games can detect this situation, so it later became common to install a switch to reconnect the lockout chip as needed.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://home.freeuk.com/markk/Consoles/SNES_Lockout.txt |title=Disabling the SNES/Super Famicom \"Lockout Chip\"|accessdate= April 14, 2007 |author=Mark Knibbs|date=December 27, 1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030121165526/http://home.freeuk.com/markk/Consoles/SNES_Lockout.txt |archivedate=January 21, 2003}}</ref>\n\nPAL consoles face another incompatibility when playing out-of-region cartridges: the [[NTSC]] video standard specifies video at 60&nbsp;Hz while [[PAL]] operates at 50&nbsp;Hz, resulting in approximately 16.7% slower framerate. Additionally, PAL's higher resolution results in [[letterbox]]ing of the output image.<ref name=\"palconverter\" /> Some commercial PAL region releases exhibit this same problem and, therefore, can be played in NTSC systems without issue, while other games will face a 20% speedup if played in an NTSC console. To mostly correct this issue, a switch can be added to place the SNES PPU into a 60&nbsp;Hz mode supported by most newer PAL televisions. Later games will detect this setting and refuse to run, requiring the switch to be thrown only after the check completes.<ref name=\"SNES-pal-switch\">{{cite web |url=http://home.freeuk.net/markk/Consoles/SNES_50-60Hz_Switch.txt\n|title=Super NES/Super Famicom 50/60\u00a0Hz Switch Modification |accessdate=April 14, 2007 |author=Mark Knibbs|date=January 25, 1998 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010502190046/http://home.freeuk.net/markk/Consoles/SNES_50-60Hz_Switch.txt |archivedate=May 2, 2001}}</ref>\n\n=== Casing ===\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|[[File:Nintendo-Super-Famicom-Set-FL.jpg|none|135px|Original Japanese SFC]]\n|[[File:SNES-Mod1-Console-Set.jpg|none|145px|Original U.S. SNES]]\n|[[File:Wikipedia SNES PAL.jpg|none|120px|Original PAL SNES]]\n|[[File:SNES-Model-2-Set.jpg|none|135px|New-Style Super NES]]\n|[[File:SuperFamicom jr.jpg|none|110px|Super Famicom Jr.]]\n|[[File:Hyundai Super Comboy - Main Body.jpg|none|110px|Super Comboy]]\n|[[File:Nintendo Super System controller.jpg|none|110px|Nintendo Super System controller]]\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"80\"|<small>Japanese SHVC-001 model<br />(1990\u20131998)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>North American SNS-001 model<br />(1991\u20131997)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>PAL-region SNSP-001A model<br />(1992\u20131998)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>[[New-Style Super NES]] SNS-101<br />(1997\u20131999)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>Japanese SHVC-101 model<br />(1998\u20132003)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>South Korean SNSN-001 model</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>Nintendo Super System controller</small>\n|}</center>\nAll versions of the Super NES are predominantly gray, of slightly different shades.

Although each version is essentially the same, several forms of [[regional lockout]] prevent the different cartridges from being compatible with one another.\n\nThe SNES is Nintendo's second programmable home console, following the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). The console introduced advanced graphics and sound capabilities compared with other systems at the time. The system was designed to accommodate the ongoing development of [[List of Super NES enhancement chips|a variety of enhancement chips]] integrated in [[ROM cartridge|game cartridges]] to be competitive into the next generation.\n\nThe SNES was a global success, becoming the best-selling console of the [[Fourth generation of video game consoles|16-bit era]] after launching relatively late and facing intense competition from [[Sega]]'s [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] console in North America and Europe. Overlapping the NES's 61.9 million unit sales, the SNES remained popular well into the [[Fifth generation of video game consoles|32-bit era]], with 49.1 million units sold worldwide by the time it was discontinued in 2003. It continues to be popular among collectors and [[Retrogaming|retro gamers]], with new [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] games and Nintendo's emulated rereleases, such as on the [[Virtual Console]], the [[Super NES Classic Edition]], and [[Nintendo Switch Online]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Super NES designs.png|thumb|Early concept designs for the SNES, referred to as the \"Nintendo Entertainment System 2\"]]\nTo compete with the popular [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] in Japan, [[NEC Corporation|NEC Home Electronics]] launched the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] in 1987, and [[Sega]] followed suit with the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] in 1988. The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Sega Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the [[Third generation of video game consoles\n|8-bit]] NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful.<ref>[[#CITEREFSheff1993|Sheff (1993)]], pp. 353\u2013356. \"The Genesis continued to flounder through its first couple of years on the market, although Sega showed Sisyphean resolve....

North American cartridges have a rectangular bottom with inset grooves matching protruding tabs in the console, while other regions' cartridges are narrower with a smooth curve on the front and no grooves. The physical incompatibility can be overcome with use of various adapters, or through [[modding|modification]] of the console.<ref name=\"palconverter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/07/soapbox_why_region_locking_is_a_total_non_issue|title=Soapbox: Why Region Locking Is A Total Non-Issue|author=Nintendo Life|work=Nintendo Life}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/df-hardware-the-ultimate-console-collectors-guide|title=The Ultimate Retro Console Collectors' Guide|date=May 6, 2012|work=Eurogamer.net}}</ref>\n\nInternally, a regional [[lockout chip]] ([[CIC (Nintendo)|CIC]]) within the console and in each cartridge prevents PAL region games from being played on Japanese or North American consoles and vice versa. The Japanese and North American machines have the same region chip. This can be overcome through the use of adapters, typically by inserting the imported cartridge in one slot and a cartridge with the correct region chip in a second slot. Alternatively, disconnecting one pin of the console's lockout chip will prevent it from locking the console; hardware in later games can detect this situation, so it later became common to install a switch to reconnect the lockout chip as needed.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://home.freeuk.com/markk/Consoles/SNES_Lockout.txt |title=Disabling the SNES/Super Famicom \"Lockout Chip\"|accessdate= April 14, 2007 |author=Mark Knibbs|date=December 27, 1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030121165526/http://home.freeuk.com/markk/Consoles/SNES_Lockout.txt |archivedate=January 21, 2003}}</ref>\n\nPAL consoles face another incompatibility when playing out-of-region cartridges: the [[NTSC]] video standard specifies video at 60&nbsp;Hz while [[PAL]] operates at 50&nbsp;Hz, resulting in approximately 16.7% slower framerate. Additionally, PAL's higher resolution results in [[letterbox]]ing of the output image.<ref name=\"palconverter\" /> Some commercial PAL region releases exhibit this same problem and, therefore, can be played in NTSC systems without issue, while other games will face a 20% speedup if played in an NTSC console. To mostly correct this issue, a switch can be added to place the SNES PPU into a 60&nbsp;Hz mode supported by most newer PAL televisions. Later games will detect this setting and refuse to run, requiring the switch to be thrown only after the check completes.<ref name=\"SNES-pal-switch\">{{cite web |url=http://home.freeuk.net/markk/Consoles/SNES_50-60Hz_Switch.txt\n|title=Super NES/Super Famicom 50/60\u00a0Hz Switch Modification |accessdate=April 14, 2007 |author=Mark Knibbs|date=January 25, 1998 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010502190046/http://home.freeuk.net/markk/Consoles/SNES_50-60Hz_Switch.txt |archivedate=May 2, 2001}}</ref>\n\n=== Casing ===\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|[[File:Nintendo-Super-Famicom-Set-FL.jpg|none|135px|Original Japanese SFC]]\n|[[File:SNES-Mod1-Console-Set.jpg|none|145px|Original U.S. SNES]]\n|[[File:Wikipedia SNES PAL.jpg|none|120px|Original PAL SNES]]\n|[[File:SNES-Model-2-Set.jpg|none|135px|New-Style Super NES]]\n|[[File:SuperFamicom jr.jpg|none|110px|Super Famicom Jr.]]\n|[[File:Hyundai Super Comboy - Main Body.jpg|none|110px|Super Comboy]]\n|[[File:Nintendo Super System controller.jpg|none|110px|Nintendo Super System controller]]\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"80\"|<small>Japanese SHVC-001 model<br />(1990\u20131998)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>North American SNS-001 model<br />(1991\u20131997)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>PAL-region SNSP-001A model<br />(1992\u20131998)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>[[New-Style Super NES]] SNS-101<br />(1997\u20131999)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>Japanese SHVC-101 model<br />(1998\u20132003)</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>South Korean SNSN-001 model</small>\n|width=\"80\"|<small>Nintendo Super System controller</small>\n|}</center>\nAll versions of the Super NES are predominantly gray, of slightly different shades.

This area consists of the Santa Monica freeway to the North, the Harbor Freeway to the West, Slauson Avenue to the South and Alameda to the East. It includes the Vermont Central neighborhood and Central Avenue Corridor. Since its founding, CCSCLA has expanded its work into other low-income neighborhoods, including Watts and Compton. At the time of its founding, CCSCLA's area of concentration had one of the highest populations of African Americans in Los Angeles.\n\nCCSCLA felt it needed to develop a base in order to enact substantial change. Starting in 1990, they began to organize block clubs<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Kleinman|first=Dan|year=2011|title=The New Neighborhood Block Club Manual|url=http://chicago47.org/wp-content/uploads/the-new-neighborhood-block-club-manual.pdf|journal=The New Neighborhood Block Club Manual|volume=|pages=4|via=}}</ref> throughout the Vernon-Central Area. To date, CCSCLA has been able to organize 57 block clubs. The primary issue of concern among all block clubs is the conditions of streets. Alleys in CCSCLA's area of concern were considered to be the worst in Los Angeles in the organization's beginning stages.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== History ==\nThe Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles was founded in 1985 by Robin Cannon and Charlotte Bullock in order to form a group to protest the construction of a waste incinerator known as the LANCER within the predominately low income, colored community. By 1987, its construction was successfully thwarted protests by the CCSCLA being large contributing factor to the decision.\n\nSince dismantling the LANCER, CCSCLA has broadened its mission, fighting to better the communities of South Central LA with a number of programs that still exist today. This includes campaigns fighting against environmental hazards in the community, alleyway clean ups, affordable housing projects, and youth programs.\n\n== Environmental Justice and CCSCLA ==\nBorn from the recognition that environmental hazards are unequally distributed across the United States (poor and colored communities in close proximity, and richer and white communities safely farther away) the Environmental Justice movement seeks to draw attention to and rectify these harms. This understanding, that poor and colored communities are disproportionately being exposed to environmental hazards, has been brought about by dozens of studies completed in the last thirty years.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=From the Ground Up: Environmental Racism and the Rise of the Environmental Justice Movement|last=Cole|first=Luke W.|last2=Foster|first2=Sheila R.|publisher=New York University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=New York and London|pages=10\u201314}}</ref> [[Environmental justice|Environmental Justice]] as a political movement is constituted of events and strategies aimed at achieving social and economic justice in regards to the environmental hazards plaguing marginalized communities.<ref name=\":2\" />  President Bill Clinton's [https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-executive-order-12898-federal-actions-address-environmental-justice Executive Order 12898] on Environmental Justice in 1994 adopted the work of the movement and created federal government policy.

They won the case and went on to start sponsoring and constructing affordable housing developments.

Melanie Dove, mother of one of the teens Nevada Dove, was an organizer of Concerned Citizens of South-Central LA at the time, contributing to CCSCLA's involvement in the situation. The teens\u2019 actions raised public awareness of the build on toxic land, and brought to light discrepancies in the building company's plans.

At the time of its founding, CCSCLA's area of concentration had one of the highest populations of African Americans in Los Angeles.\n\nCCSCLA felt it needed to develop a base in order to enact substantial change.

By 1987, its construction was successfully thwarted protests by the CCSCLA being large contributing factor to the decision.\n\nSince dismantling the LANCER, CCSCLA has broadened its mission, fighting to better the communities of South Central LA with a number of programs that still exist today. This includes campaigns fighting against environmental hazards in the community, alleyway clean ups, affordable housing projects, and youth programs.\n\n== Environmental Justice and CCSCLA ==\nBorn from the recognition that environmental hazards are unequally distributed across the United States (poor and colored communities in close proximity, and richer and white communities safely farther away) the Environmental Justice movement seeks to draw attention to and rectify these harms. This understanding, that poor and colored communities are disproportionately being exposed to environmental hazards, has been brought about by dozens of studies completed in the last thirty years.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=From the Ground Up: Environmental Racism and the Rise of the Environmental Justice Movement|last=Cole|first=Luke W.|last2=Foster|first2=Sheila R.|publisher=New York University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=New York and London|pages=10\u201314}}</ref> [[Environmental justice|Environmental Justice]] as a political movement is constituted of events and strategies aimed at achieving social and economic justice in regards to the environmental hazards plaguing marginalized communities.<ref name=\":2\" />  President Bill Clinton's [https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-executive-order-12898-federal-actions-address-environmental-justice Executive Order 12898] on Environmental Justice in 1994 adopted the work of the movement and created federal government policy.

Slobodkin (1920\u20132006), who, under the name ''MHarris1920'', started to post his own blogs. Martin died in October 2006, and received an outpouring of tributes from other YouTube users after his wife, Teresa, posted a video announcing his death. His widow temporarily took over his blogs, but later closed this account. Another older person is Bernhard von Schwerin, who appears under the name bernie1927. He too was a World War II veteran, but on the German side. He was encouraged by Oakley, and has talked about his youth and his many travels, and his emigration to the U.S. in 1951.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nArtist [[Annemarie Wright]], 31, was so inspired by Oakley's story that she dedicated a piece of artwork to him.

On 5 March 2014 Chantrey posted the song on his own channel on YouTube, accompanied by video footage of Peter as a tribute following the announcement of his illness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QJ5FbD1Hvk |title=A tribute to Peter (Geriatric1927) - Telling It All |publisher=YouTube |date=5 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nOakley was featured in an installment of Yahoo! Current Buzz (which chronicles the top searches on the Internet), entitled \"Retired and Wired\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://video.yahoo.com/video/play?&ei=UTF-8&gid=g_c860df3ccf66c83fb61bb2ffd934330b.3bef3f8c287ebfb39a15f8d372d0b8a2&ex=2&b=12&vid=c860df3ccf66c83fb61bb2ffd934330b.1041506&rurl=video.yahoo.com&vdone=http%3A%2F%2Fvideo.yahoo.com%2Fvideo%2Fgroup%3Fei%3DUTF-8%26gid%3Dg_c860df3ccf66c83fb61bb2ffd934330b.3bef3f8c287ebfb39a15f8d372d0b8a2%26ex%3D2%26b%3D11 |title=video.yahoo.com |publisher=video.yahoo.com |accessdate=3 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723234709/http://video.yahoo.com/video/play |archivedate=23 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nOakley's [[YouTube]] success inspired other older people, particularly men with life experiences to share, to begin posting [[vlog]]s on it. [[Jonathan King]] credits him for starting his YouTube videos in 2006. Oakley influenced World War II veteran Martin H. Slobodkin (1920\u20132006), who, under the name ''MHarris1920'', started to post his own blogs. Martin died in October 2006, and received an outpouring of tributes from other YouTube users after his wife, Teresa, posted a video announcing his death. His widow temporarily took over his blogs, but later closed this account. Another older person is Bernhard von Schwerin, who appears under the name bernie1927. He too was a World War II veteran, but on the German side. He was encouraged by Oakley, and has talked about his youth and his many travels, and his emigration to the U.S. in 1951.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nArtist [[Annemarie Wright]], 31, was so inspired by Oakley's story that she dedicated a piece of artwork to him. The image is of Oakley to the lyrics of [[The Zimmers]]' version of \"[[My Generation]]\".{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Media==\nOn 17 August 2006, Oakley uploaded \"Telling it all 7\", in which he made a statement about how much attention he had received from the media over the previous days. He mentioned that this was not what he sought or wanted. He also stated that any web sites using his username (geriatric1927) were in no way affiliated with him.<ref name=\"tell7\">Telling it all 7 - Something important to say youtube posting 17 August 2006</ref> In \"Telling it all 7\", he stated that he had received many messages from advertising companies, telephone companies, and newspaper companies that wanted to interview him, but he preferred to speak only to his fellow YouTubers, whom he considered his friends.\n\nOn 16 February 2007, Oakley made his first television appearance, on a special episode of the BBC's ''[[The Money Programme]]'' called \"Coming to Your Screen: DIY TV\". The program was taped in the autumn of 2006. He also featured in a radio interview for the [[BBC World Service]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmkHG5YIUTw |title=Telling it all 44 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2016-12-09}}</ref> In March 2007, Oakley announced that he was working on some television programmes about silver surfing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz8pakXuaGY |title=Telling it all 46 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2007-03-14 |accessdate=2016-12-09}}</ref>\n\nOakley was part of a BBC documentary in which he was recruited as one of [[The Zimmers]], a group of pensioners whom the documentary maker [[Tim Samuels]] brought together to sing [[The Who|The Who's]] classic \"[[My Generation (The Who song)|My Generation]]\" to highlight the plight of pensioners in modern Britain. The single was released in May 2007 to raise money for the charity [[Age Concern]]. As part of The Zimmers, Oakley recorded a version of the [[Alan Parsons Project]]'s song \"[[Old and Wise]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/thezimmersband |title=The Zimmers &#124; Listen and Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos |website=Myspace.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-09}}</ref> His work with the band took him to [[Washington, D.C.]] in September 2007, as a guest of the [[AARP]].\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130205101033/http://www.askgeriatric.com/wordpress Archive of official site] (now defunct)\n*[https://www.youtube.com/user/geriatric1927 geriatric1927 on YouTube]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/profile?user=geriatric1927blues geriatric1927blues channel]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-hon}}\n{{succession box|\nbefore=[[Brookers]]|\ntitle=Most Subscribed Channel on YouTube|\nyears=|\nafter=[[lonelygirl15]]|\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oakley, Peter}}\n[[Category:1927 births]]\n[[Category:2014 deaths]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:British Army soldiers]]\n[[Category:British Internet celebrities]]\n[[Category:English video bloggers]]\n[[Category:English YouTubers]]\n[[Category:People from Bakewell]]\n[[Category:People from Leicester]]\n[[Category:YouTube channels launched in 2006]]\n[[Category:YouTube channels closed in 2014]]\n", "name_user": "Markymark101", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Oakley"}
