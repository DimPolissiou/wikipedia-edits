Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with [[Amnesty International]] and more than a hundred other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.<ref

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Sports]] (Yahoo!).\n\nCurrently, the NCAA compiles consensus all-America teams in the sports of [[NCAA Division I#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I-FBS]] football and Division I men's basketball using a point system computed from All-America teams named by coaches associations or media sources.  The system consists of three points for a first-team honor, two points for second-team honor, and one point for third-team honor.  Honorable mention and fourth team or lower recognitions are not accorded any points.  Football consensus teams are compiled by position and the player accumulating the most points at each position is named first team consensus all-American.  Currently, the NCAA recognizes All-Americans selected by the '''AP, AFCA, FWAA, ''TSN'', and the WCFF''' to determine Consensus and Unanimous All-Americans. Any player named to the First Team by all five of the NCAA-recognized selectors is deemed a Unanimous All-American.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |title=2010-11 NCAA Statistics Policies(updated 9/15/2010) |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |archivedate=November 9, 2011 |date=September 15, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109025404/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/ncaa-football/news/alabamas-tua-tagovailoa-2018-consensus-all-american-team/u4gei2bnxvig1jmptsbwhsj97 2018 Consensus All-America Team]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

For the 2019 poll, Michigan was voted as the favorite to win both the East Division and the Big Ten Championship Game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/osu/2019/07/michigan-named-big-ten-football-favorite-in-clevelandcom-2019-preseason-poll.html|title=Michigan named Big Ten football favorite in cleveland.com 2019 preseason poll|date=July 18, 2019|website=Cleveland.com|first=Doug|last=Lesmerises}}</ref> \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"display: inline-table;\"\n|+East\n|- align=\"center\"\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Big Ten Conference|Predicted finish|Team|Votes (1st place)}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1 || Michigan || 222 (20)\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2 || Ohio State || 214 (14)\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 3 || Michigan State || 156\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 4 || Penn State || 154\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 5 || Indiana || 86.5\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 6 || Maryland || 82.5\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 7 || Rutgers || 37\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"display: inline-table;\"\n|+West\n|- align=\"center\"\n{{CollegeSecondaryHeader|team=Big Ten Conference|Predicted finish|Team|Votes (1st place)}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1 || Nebraska || 198 (14)\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2 || Iowa || 194.5 (14)\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 3 || Wisconsin || 172.5 (4)\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 4 || Northwestern || 142.5 (1)\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 5 || Purdue || 110.5\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 6 || Minnesota || 100 (1)\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 7 || Illinois || 34\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n|align=\"center\" Colspan=\"3\" |'''Media poll (Big Ten Championship)'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Big Ten Conference|Rank|Team|Votes}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1 || Michigan over Nebraska || 8\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2 || Michigan over Iowa || 8\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 3 || Ohio State over Iowa || 6\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 4 || Ohio State over Nebraska || 4\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 5 || Ohio State over Wisconsin || 3\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 6 || Nebraska over Michigan || 2\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 7 || Michigan over Wisconsin || 1\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 8 || Ohio State over Minnesota || 1\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 9 || Northwestern over Michigan || 1\n|}\n\n===Preseason awards===\n\n===Preseason All-Big Ten===\n\n'''East Division'''\n*Joe Bachie, Sr., LB, Michigan State\n*Kenny Willekes, Sr., DE, Michigan State\n*[[J.

Sports]] (Yahoo!).\n\nCurrently, the NCAA compiles consensus all-America teams in the sports of [[NCAA Division I#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I-FBS]] football and Division I men's basketball using a point system computed from All-America teams named by coaches associations or media sources.  The system consists of three points for a first-team honor, two points for second-team honor, and one point for third-team honor.  Honorable mention and fourth team or lower recognitions are not accorded any points.  Football consensus teams are compiled by position and the player accumulating the most points at each position is named first team consensus all-American.  Currently, the NCAA recognizes All-Americans selected by the '''AP, AFCA, FWAA, ''TSN'', and the WCFF''' to determine Consensus and Unanimous All-Americans. Any player named to the First Team by all five of the NCAA-recognized selectors is deemed a Unanimous All-American.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |title=2010-11 NCAA Statistics Policies(updated 9/15/2010) |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |archivedate=November 9, 2011 |date=September 15, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109025404/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/ncaa-football/news/alabamas-tua-tagovailoa-2018-consensus-all-american-team/u4gei2bnxvig1jmptsbwhsj97 2018 Consensus All-America Team]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He was less successful in extending control into Wales. William is commonly known as '''William Rufus''' ({{lang|la|Rufus}} being Latin for \"the Red\"), perhaps because of his ruddy appearance or, more likely, due to having red hair as a child that grew out in later life.<ref>Barlow ''William Rufus'' pp. 11\u201312</ref>{{efn|{{lang|la|De Miraculis Sancti Eadmundi|italic=no}} is alone in calling him William Longsword.<ref>Mason, ''King Rufus: The Life and Murder of William II of England'', p. 10</ref>}}\n\nWilliam was a figure of complex temperament, capable of both bellicosity and flamboyance. He did not marry, nor did he father any offspring, which has led to speculations of possible [[homosexuality]] by historians.<ref>Mason, ''King Rufus: The Life and Murder of William II of England'', p. 16</ref> He died after being hit by an arrow while hunting, under circumstances that remain unclear. Circumstantial evidence in the behaviour of those around him raises strong, but unproven, suspicions of murder.<ref>Mason, ''King Rufus: The Life and Murder of William II of England'', pp. 9-11</ref> His younger brother [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] hurriedly succeeded him as king.\n\n[[Frank Barlow (historian)|Frank Barlow]] observed William was \"A rumbustious, devil-may-care soldier, without natural dignity or social graces, with no cultivated tastes and little show of conventional religious piety or morality\u2014indeed, according to his critics, addicted to every kind of vice, particularly lust and especially sodomy.\" On the other hand, he was a wise ruler and victorious general. Barlow noted, \"His chivalrous virtues and achievements were all too obvious. He had maintained good order and satisfactory justice in England and restored good peace to Normandy. He had extended Anglo-Norman rule in Wales, brought Scotland firmly under his lordship, recovered [[Maine (province)|Maine]], and kept up the pressure on the [[Vexin]].\"<ref>Frank Barlow, \"William II (c.1060\u20131100)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29449, online accessed 28 Nov 2013]</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nWilliam's exact date of birth is not known, but it was some time between the years 1056 and 1060. He was the third of four sons born to [[William the Conqueror]] and [[Matilda of Flanders]], the eldest being [[Robert Curthose]], the second [[Richard, son of William the Conqueror|Richard]], and the youngest [[Henry I of England|Henry]]. Richard died around 1075 while hunting in the [[New Forest]]. William succeeded to the throne of England on his father's death in 1087, but Robert inherited Normandy.<ref name=Douglas393>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 393</ref>\n\nWilliam had five or six sisters. The existence of sisters [[Adeliza]] and Matilda is not absolutely certain, but four sisters are more securely attested:\n* [[Adela of Normandy|Adela]], who married [[Stephen, Count of Blois|the Count of Blois]]\n* [[Cecilia of Normandy|Cecily]], who became a nun\n* [[Agatha of Normandy|Agatha]], who died unmarried\n* [[Constance of Normandy|Constance]], who married the Duke of Brittany.<ref name=Douglas395>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 395</ref>\n\nRecords indicate strained relations between the three surviving sons of William I. William's contemporary, chronicler [[Orderic Vitalis]], wrote about an incident that took place at [[L'Aigle]] in Normandy in 1077 or 1078: William and Henry, having grown bored with casting dice, decided to make mischief by emptying a [[chamber pot]] onto their brother Robert from an upper gallery, thus infuriating and shaming him. A brawl broke out, and their father had to intercede to restore order.<ref name=Barlow33>Barlow ''William Rufus pp. 33\u201334</ref>{{efn|Barlow suggests that William and Henry probably urinated over Robert.<ref name=Barlow33/>}}\n\nAccording to [[William of Malmesbury]], writing in the 12th century, William Rufus was \"well set; his complexion florid, his hair yellow; of open countenance; different coloured eyes, varying with certain glittering specks; of astonishing strength, though not very tall, and his belly rather projecting.\"<ref>William of Malmesbury ''History of the Norman Kings'' p. 70</ref>\n\n==England and France==\n[[File:Great Seal of William Rufus.jpg|thumb|left|Great Seal of William II]]\n\nThe division of William the Conqueror's lands into two parts presented a dilemma for those nobles who held land on both sides of the English Channel. Since the younger William and his brother Robert were natural rivals, these nobles worried that they could not hope to please both of their lords, and thus ran the risk of losing the favour of one ruler or the other, or both.<ref>Carpenter, ''Struggle for Mastery'', p. 125 f.</ref> The only solution, as they saw it, was to unite England and Normandy once more under one ruler. The pursuit of this aim led them to revolt against William in favour of Robert in the [[Rebellion of 1088]], under the leadership of the powerful Bishop [[Odo of Bayeux]], who was a half-brother of William the Conqueror.<ref name=Carpenter129>Carpenter, ''Struggle for Mastery'', p. 129.</ref> As Robert failed to appear in England to rally his supporters, William won the support of the English with silver and promises of better government, and defeated the rebellion, thus securing his authority. In 1091 he invaded Normandy, crushing Robert's forces and forcing him to cede a portion of his lands. The two made up their differences and William agreed to help Robert recover lands lost to France, notably [[Maine (province)|Maine]]. This plan was later abandoned, but William continued to pursue a ferociously warlike defence of his French possessions and interests to the end of his life, exemplified by his response to the attempt by [[Elias I, Count of Maine|Elias de la Fl\u00e8che]], [[Counts and dukes of Maine|Count of Maine]], to take [[Le Mans]] in 1099.<ref>Barlow, ''William Rufus'', pp. 402\u2013406.</ref>\n\nWilliam Rufus was thus secure in what was then the most powerful kingdom in Europe, given the contemporary eclipse of the [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] emperors. As in Normandy, his bishops and abbots were bound to him by feudal obligations; and his right of investiture in the Norman tradition prevailed within his kingdom, during the age of the [[Investiture Controversy]] that brought excommunication upon the Salian Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]]. The king's personal power, through an effective and loyal [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]], penetrated to the local level to an extent unmatched in France. The king's administration and law unified the realm, rendering him relatively impervious to papal condemnation.  In 1097 he commenced the original [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster Hall]], which when completed in 1099 was the largest hall in Europe, built \"to impress his subjects with the power and majesty of his authority\".<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Cescinsky |first1=Herbert |last2=Gribble |first2=Ernest R. |date=February 1922 |title=Westminster Hall and Its Roof |journal=The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs |volume=40 |issue=227 |pages=76\u201384 |jstor=861585}} {{Subscription required}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n\n[[File:Silver penny of William II (YORYM 2000 2062) obverse.jpg|thumb|upright|Silver penny of William II showing a crowned head facing forward (1089), [[Yorkshire Museum]], York]]\nLess than two years after becoming king, William II lost his father's adviser and confidant, the Italian-Norman [[Lanfranc]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. After Lanfranc's death in 1089, the king delayed appointing a new archbishop for many years, appropriating ecclesiastical revenues in the interim. In panic, owing to serious illness in 1093, William nominated as archbishop another Norman-Italian, [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]]&nbsp;\u2013 considered the greatest theologian of his generation&nbsp;\u2013 but this led to a long period of animosity between Church and State, Anselm being a stronger supporter of the [[Gregorian Reform|Gregorian reforms]] in the Church than Lanfranc. William and Anselm disagreed on a range of ecclesiastical issues, in the course of which the king declared of Anselm that, \"Yesterday I hated him with great hatred, today I hate him with yet greater hatred and he can be certain that tomorrow and thereafter I shall hate him continually with ever fiercer and more bitter hatred.\"<ref>Bosanquet (tr.) ''Eadmer's History'' p. 53</ref> The English clergy, beholden to the king for their preferments and livings, were unable to support Anselm publicly. In 1095 William called a council at [[Rockingham, Northamptonshire|Rockingham]] to bring Anselm to heel, but the archbishop remained firm. In October 1097, Anselm went into exile, taking his case to the Pope. The diplomatic and flexible [[Pope Urban II|Urban II]], a new pope, was involved in a major conflict with [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV]], who supported an [[antipope]]. Reluctant to make another enemy, Urban came to a [[concordat]] with William, whereby William recognised Urban as pope, and Urban gave sanction to the Anglo-Norman ecclesiastical ''status quo''. Anselm remained in exile, and William was able to claim the revenues of the archbishop of Canterbury to the end of his reign.<ref>Carpenter ''Struggle for Mastery'' p. 132</ref>\n\nHowever, this conflict was symptomatic of medieval English politics, as exemplified by the murder of [[Thomas Becket]] during the reign of the later [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] king [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (his great-nephew through his brother Henry) and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s actions centuries later, and as such should not be seen as a defect of William's reign in particular.{{efn|According to [[Eadmer]], an unusually well placed witness, William II \"protested that Archbishop [[Anselm of Canterbury]] could not possibly keep at the same time both the allegiance which he owed to the King and obedience to the Apostolic See against the King's will.\"<ref>Bosanquet (tr.) ''Eadmer's History'' p. 54</ref> Anselm found himself in similar conflict with William II's successor, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], as also reported by Eadmer.}} Of course, contemporary churchmen were themselves not above engaging in such politics: it is reported that, when Archbishop Lanfranc suggested to William I that he imprison the rebellious bishop [[Odo of Bayeux]], he exclaimed \"What! he is a clergyman.\" Lanfranc retorted that \"You will not seize the bishop of Bayeux, but confine the earl of Kent.\" (Odo held both titles.)<ref>William of Malmesbury ''History of the Norman Kings'' p. 60</ref>\n\nWhile there are complaints of contemporaries regarding William's personal behaviour, he was instrumental in assisting the foundation of [[Bermondsey Abbey]], endowing it with the manor of Bermondsey; and it is reported that his \"customary oath\" was \"By the [[Holy Face of Lucca|Face at Lucca]]!\"{{efn|For an interesting discussion of such blasphemous oaths, see Barlow, F., ''William Rufus'', Univ. of California Press, 1983, pp. 116\u20138. An alternative, pagan interpretation of this oath proposed by [[Margaret Murray]] is that William swore by the \"face of [[Loki]]\": Murray, Margaret A., ''The God of the Witches'', [[Oxford University Press|OUP]], 1970, p.&nbsp;164.}} It seems reasonable to suppose that such details are indicative of William's personal beliefs.\n\n==War and rebellion==\n\nWilliam Rufus inherited the Anglo-Norman settlement detailed in the [[Domesday Book]], a survey undertaken at his father's command, essentially for the purposes of taxation, which was an example of the control of the English monarchy. If he was less effective than his father in containing the Norman lords' propensity for rebellion and violence, through charisma or political skills, he was forceful in overcoming the consequences. In 1095, [[Robert de Mowbray]], the earl of [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]], refused to attend the ''[[Curia regis|Curia Regis]]'', the thrice-annual court where the King announced his governmental decisions to the great lords. William led an army against Robert and defeated him. Robert was dispossessed and imprisoned, and another noble, [[William II, Count of Eu|William of Eu]], accused of treachery, was blinded and [[Castration|castrated]].<ref>Carpenter, ''Struggle for Mastery'', p. 131.</ref>\n\nIn external affairs, William had some successes. In 1091 he repulsed an invasion by King [[Malcolm III of Scotland]], forcing Malcolm to pay homage. In 1092 he built [[Carlisle Castle]], taking control of [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]], which had previously been claimed by the Scots.<ref name=Carpenter129/> Subsequently, the two kings quarrelled over Malcolm's possessions in England, and Malcolm again invaded, ravaging Northumbria. At the [[Battle of Alnwick (1093)|Battle of Alnwick]], on 13 November 1093, Malcolm was ambushed by Norman forces led by Robert de Mowbray. Malcolm and his son Edward were killed and Malcolm's brother [[Donald III of Scotland|Donald]] seized the throne. William supported Malcolm's son [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan II]], who held power for a short time, and then another of Malcolm's sons, [[Edgar, King of Scotland|Edgar]]. Edgar conquered [[Lothian]] in 1094 and eventually removed Donald in 1097 with William's aid in a campaign led by [[Edgar \u00c6theling]]. The new king recognised William's authority over Lothian and attended William's court.\n\nWilliam made two forays into Wales in 1097. Nothing decisive was achieved, but a series of castles was constructed as a marchland defensive barrier.<ref>Philip J. Potter, ''Gothic Kings of Britain: The Lives of 31 Medieval Rulers, 1016-1399'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=h_zW8TBBVQkC&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 47].</ref>\n\nIn 1096, William's brother Robert Curthose joined the [[First Crusade]]. He needed money to fund this venture and pledged his [[Duchy of Normandy]] to William in return for a payment of 10,000 marks, which equates to about a quarter of William's annual revenue. In a display of the effectiveness of English taxation, William raised the money by levying a special, heavy, and much-resented tax upon the whole of England. He then ruled Normandy as regent in Robert's absence. Robert did not return until September 1100, one month after William's death.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-II-duke-of-Normandy|title=Robert II {{!}} duke of Normandy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=12 September 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs regent in Normandy, William campaigned in France from 1097 to 1099. He secured northern Maine but failed to seize the French-controlled part of the [[Vexin]] region. According to William of Malmesbury he was planning to invade the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]] at the time of his death.<ref>Gillingham, William II, p.97</ref>\n\n==Death==\nWilliam went hunting on 2 August 1100 in the New Forest, probably near [[Brockenhurst]], and was killed by an arrow through the lung, though the circumstances remain unclear. The earliest statement of the event was in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', which noted that the king was \"shot by an arrow by one of his own men.\"<ref name=QRufus420>Quoted in Barlow ''William Rufus'' p. 421</ref> Later chroniclers added the name of the killer, a nobleman named [[Walter Tirel]], although the description of events was later embroidered with other details that may or may not be true.<ref name=Rufus420>Barlow ''William Rufus'' pp. 420\u2013423</ref> The first mention of any location more exact than the New Forest comes from [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], who wrote in 1530 that William died at Thorougham, a placename that is no longer used, but that probably referred to a location on what is now Park Farm on the [[Beaulieu, Hampshire|Beaulieu]] estates.<ref name =Lloyd19>{{cite book |title=The Death of Rufus |last=Lloyd |first=Arthur|year=2000 |publisher=The New Forest Ninth Centenary trust  |isbn=0-9526120-5-4 |pages=19\u201320 }}</ref><ref name =Lloyd1>{{cite book |title=The Death of Rufus |last=Lloyd |first=Arthur |year=2000 |publisher=The New Forest Ninth Centenary trust|isbn=0-9526120-5-4 |page=1 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tomb of William Rufus, Winchester Cathedral (Robert Chambers, p.161, 1832) - Copy.jpg|thumb|Tomb of William Rufus, [[Winchester Cathedral]] (Robert Chambers, p.161, 1832)<ref name=Chambers>{{cite book|last1=Chambers|first1=Robert|title=The Book of Days: A Miscellany of Popular Antiquities in Connection with the Calendar, Including Anecdote, Biography, & History, Curiosities of Literature and Oddities of Human Life and Character, Volume 2|date=1832|publisher=W. & R.

A peasant later found it. William's younger brother, [[Henry I of England|Henry]], hastened to Winchester to secure the royal treasury, then to London, where he was crowned within days, before either archbishop could arrive.

''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' p. 235</ref> [[Chronicle]]rs tended to take a dim view of William's reign, arguably on account of his long and difficult struggles with the Church: these chroniclers were themselves generally clerics, and so might be expected to report him somewhat negatively. His chief minister was [[Ranulf Flambard]], whom he appointed [[Bishop of Durham]] in 1099: this was a political appointment, to a [[Episcopal see|see]] that was also a great [[fief]]dom. The particulars of the king's relationship with the people of England are not credibly documented. Contemporaries of William, as well as those writing after his death, roundly denounced him for presiding over what these dissenters considered a dissolute court. In keeping with tradition of Norman leaders, William scorned the English and the English culture.<ref>Cantor ''Civilization of the Middle Ages'' pp. 280\u2013284</ref>\n\n==Sexuality==\n\nContemporaries of William raised concerns about a court dominated by homosexuality and effeminacy, although this appears to have had more to do with their luxurious attire than with actual sexual practices.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mills |first1=Robert |title=Seeing Sodomy in the Middle Ages |date=2015 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226169262 |pages=82-83 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e6J0BgAAQBAJ |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe historian Emma Mason has noted that while during his reign William himself was never openly accused of homosexuality, in the decades after his death numerous medieval writers spoke of this and a few began to describe him as a \"sodomite\".<ref name=\":0\">Mason, ''King Rufus: The Life and Murder of William II of England'', pp. 9\u201325</ref> Modern historians cannot state with certainty whether William was homosexual or not; however, he never took a wife or a mistress, or fathered any children.

Barlow also allows that William may have been sterile. Noting that no \"favourites\" were identified, and that William's \"baronial friends and companions were mostly married men\", despite having concluded that the chroniclers were \"hostile and biased witnesses\", Barlow considers that \"there seems no reason why they should have invented this particular charge\" (of homosexuality) and states that, in his opinion, \"On the whole the evidence points to the king's bisexuality\".{{sfn|Barlow|2000|p=109}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|30em}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Barlow |first= Frank |authorlink=Frank Barlow (historian)|title=William Rufus |publisher=Yale University Press  |edition= Second|location=New Haven, CT |year=2000 |isbn=0-300-08291-6 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |author=Bosanquet, G.

He was less successful in extending control into Wales. William is commonly known as '''William Rufus''' ({{lang|la|Rufus}} being Latin for \"the Red\"), perhaps because of his ruddy appearance or, more likely, due to having red hair as a child that grew out in later life.<ref>Barlow ''William Rufus'' pp. 11\u201312</ref>{{efn|{{lang|la|De Miraculis Sancti Eadmundi|italic=no}} is alone in calling him William Longsword.<ref>Mason, ''King Rufus: The Life and Murder of William II of England'', p. 10</ref>}}\n\nWilliam was a figure of complex temperament, capable of both bellicosity and flamboyance.

Barlow noted, \"His chivalrous virtues and achievements were all too obvious. He had maintained good order and satisfactory justice in England and restored good peace to Normandy. He had extended Anglo-Norman rule in Wales, brought Scotland firmly under his lordship, recovered [[Maine (province)|Maine]], and kept up the pressure on the [[Vexin]].\"<ref>Frank Barlow, \"William II (c.1060\u20131100)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29449, online accessed 28 Nov 2013]</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nWilliam's exact date of birth is not known, but it was some time between the years 1056 and 1060. He was the third of four sons born to [[William the Conqueror]] and [[Matilda of Flanders]], the eldest being [[Robert Curthose]], the second [[Richard, son of William the Conqueror|Richard]], and the youngest [[Henry I of England|Henry]]. Richard died around 1075 while hunting in the [[New Forest]]. William succeeded to the throne of England on his father's death in 1087, but Robert inherited Normandy.<ref name=Douglas393>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 393</ref>\n\nWilliam had five or six sisters. The existence of sisters [[Adeliza]] and Matilda is not absolutely certain, but four sisters are more securely attested:\n* [[Adela of Normandy|Adela]], who married [[Stephen, Count of Blois|the Count of Blois]]\n* [[Cecilia of Normandy|Cecily]], who became a nun\n* [[Agatha of Normandy|Agatha]], who died unmarried\n* [[Constance of Normandy|Constance]], who married the Duke of Brittany.<ref name=Douglas395>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 395</ref>\n\nRecords indicate strained relations between the three surviving sons of William I. William's contemporary, chronicler [[Orderic Vitalis]], wrote about an incident that took place at [[L'Aigle]] in Normandy in 1077 or 1078: William and Henry, having grown bored with casting dice, decided to make mischief by emptying a [[chamber pot]] onto their brother Robert from an upper gallery, thus infuriating and shaming him. A brawl broke out, and their father had to intercede to restore order.<ref name=Barlow33>Barlow ''William Rufus pp. 33\u201334</ref>{{efn|Barlow suggests that William and Henry probably urinated over Robert.<ref name=Barlow33/>}}\n\nAccording to [[William of Malmesbury]], writing in the 12th century, William Rufus was \"well set; his complexion florid, his hair yellow; of open countenance; different coloured eyes, varying with certain glittering specks; of astonishing strength, though not very tall, and his belly rather projecting.\"<ref>William of Malmesbury ''History of the Norman Kings'' p. 70</ref>\n\n==England and France==\n[[File:Great Seal of William Rufus.jpg|thumb|left|Great Seal of William II]]\n\nThe division of William the Conqueror's lands into two parts presented a dilemma for those nobles who held land on both sides of the English Channel. Since the younger William and his brother Robert were natural rivals, these nobles worried that they could not hope to please both of their lords, and thus ran the risk of losing the favour of one ruler or the other, or both.<ref>Carpenter, ''Struggle for Mastery'', p. 125 f.</ref> The only solution, as they saw it, was to unite England and Normandy once more under one ruler. The pursuit of this aim led them to revolt against William in favour of Robert in the [[Rebellion of 1088]], under the leadership of the powerful Bishop [[Odo of Bayeux]], who was a half-brother of William the Conqueror.<ref name=Carpenter129>Carpenter, ''Struggle for Mastery'', p. 129.</ref> As Robert failed to appear in England to rally his supporters, William won the support of the English with silver and promises of better government, and defeated the rebellion, thus securing his authority. In 1091 he invaded Normandy, crushing Robert's forces and forcing him to cede a portion of his lands. The two made up their differences and William agreed to help Robert recover lands lost to France, notably [[Maine (province)|Maine]]. This plan was later abandoned, but William continued to pursue a ferociously warlike defence of his French possessions and interests to the end of his life, exemplified by his response to the attempt by [[Elias I, Count of Maine|Elias de la Fl\u00e8che]], [[Counts and dukes of Maine|Count of Maine]], to take [[Le Mans]] in 1099.<ref>Barlow, ''William Rufus'', pp. 402\u2013406.</ref>\n\nWilliam Rufus was thus secure in what was then the most powerful kingdom in Europe, given the contemporary eclipse of the [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] emperors. As in Normandy, his bishops and abbots were bound to him by feudal obligations; and his right of investiture in the Norman tradition prevailed within his kingdom, during the age of the [[Investiture Controversy]] that brought excommunication upon the Salian Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]]. The king's personal power, through an effective and loyal [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]], penetrated to the local level to an extent unmatched in France. The king's administration and law unified the realm, rendering him relatively impervious to papal condemnation.  In 1097 he commenced the original [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster Hall]], which when completed in 1099 was the largest hall in Europe, built \"to impress his subjects with the power and majesty of his authority\".<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Cescinsky |first1=Herbert |last2=Gribble |first2=Ernest R. |date=February 1922 |title=Westminster Hall and Its Roof |journal=The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs |volume=40 |issue=227 |pages=76\u201384 |jstor=861585}} {{Subscription required}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n\n[[File:Silver penny of William II (YORYM 2000 2062) obverse.jpg|thumb|upright|Silver penny of William II showing a crowned head facing forward (1089), [[Yorkshire Museum]], York]]\nLess than two years after becoming king, William II lost his father's adviser and confidant, the Italian-Norman [[Lanfranc]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. After Lanfranc's death in 1089, the king delayed appointing a new archbishop for many years, appropriating ecclesiastical revenues in the interim. In panic, owing to serious illness in 1093, William nominated as archbishop another Norman-Italian, [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]]&nbsp;\u2013 considered the greatest theologian of his generation&nbsp;\u2013 but this led to a long period of animosity between Church and State, Anselm being a stronger supporter of the [[Gregorian Reform|Gregorian reforms]] in the Church than Lanfranc. William and Anselm disagreed on a range of ecclesiastical issues, in the course of which the king declared of Anselm that, \"Yesterday I hated him with great hatred, today I hate him with yet greater hatred and he can be certain that tomorrow and thereafter I shall hate him continually with ever fiercer and more bitter hatred.\"<ref>Bosanquet (tr.) ''Eadmer's History'' p. 53</ref> The English clergy, beholden to the king for their preferments and livings, were unable to support Anselm publicly. In 1095 William called a council at [[Rockingham, Northamptonshire|Rockingham]] to bring Anselm to heel, but the archbishop remained firm. In October 1097, Anselm went into exile, taking his case to the Pope. The diplomatic and flexible [[Pope Urban II|Urban II]], a new pope, was involved in a major conflict with [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV]], who supported an [[antipope]]. Reluctant to make another enemy, Urban came to a [[concordat]] with William, whereby William recognised Urban as pope, and Urban gave sanction to the Anglo-Norman ecclesiastical ''status quo''. Anselm remained in exile, and William was able to claim the revenues of the archbishop of Canterbury to the end of his reign.<ref>Carpenter ''Struggle for Mastery'' p. 132</ref>\n\nHowever, this conflict was symptomatic of medieval English politics, as exemplified by the murder of [[Thomas Becket]] during the reign of the later [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] king [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (his great-nephew through his brother Henry) and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s actions centuries later, and as such should not be seen as a defect of William's reign in particular.{{efn|According to [[Eadmer]], an unusually well placed witness, William II \"protested that Archbishop [[Anselm of Canterbury]] could not possibly keep at the same time both the allegiance which he owed to the King and obedience to the Apostolic See against the King's will.\"<ref>Bosanquet (tr.) ''Eadmer's History'' p. 54</ref> Anselm found himself in similar conflict with William II's successor, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], as also reported by Eadmer.}} Of course, contemporary churchmen were themselves not above engaging in such politics: it is reported that, when Archbishop Lanfranc suggested to William I that he imprison the rebellious bishop [[Odo of Bayeux]], he exclaimed \"What! he is a clergyman.\" Lanfranc retorted that \"You will not seize the bishop of Bayeux, but confine the earl of Kent.\" (Odo held both titles.)<ref>William of Malmesbury ''History of the Norman Kings'' p. 60</ref>\n\nWhile there are complaints of contemporaries regarding William's personal behaviour, he was instrumental in assisting the foundation of [[Bermondsey Abbey]], endowing it with the manor of Bermondsey; and it is reported that his \"customary oath\" was \"By the [[Holy Face of Lucca|Face at Lucca]]!\"{{efn|For an interesting discussion of such blasphemous oaths, see Barlow, F., ''William Rufus'', Univ. of California Press, 1983, pp. 116\u20138. An alternative, pagan interpretation of this oath proposed by [[Margaret Murray]] is that William swore by the \"face of [[Loki]]\": Murray, Margaret A., ''The God of the Witches'', [[Oxford University Press|OUP]], 1970, p.&nbsp;164.}} It seems reasonable to suppose that such details are indicative of William's personal beliefs.\n\n==War and rebellion==\n\nWilliam Rufus inherited the Anglo-Norman settlement detailed in the [[Domesday Book]], a survey undertaken at his father's command, essentially for the purposes of taxation, which was an example of the control of the English monarchy. If he was less effective than his father in containing the Norman lords' propensity for rebellion and violence, through charisma or political skills, he was forceful in overcoming the consequences. In 1095, [[Robert de Mowbray]], the earl of [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]], refused to attend the ''[[Curia regis|Curia Regis]]'', the thrice-annual court where the King announced his governmental decisions to the great lords. William led an army against Robert and defeated him. Robert was dispossessed and imprisoned, and another noble, [[William II, Count of Eu|William of Eu]], accused of treachery, was blinded and [[Castration|castrated]].<ref>Carpenter, ''Struggle for Mastery'', p. 131.</ref>\n\nIn external affairs, William had some successes. In 1091 he repulsed an invasion by King [[Malcolm III of Scotland]], forcing Malcolm to pay homage. In 1092 he built [[Carlisle Castle]], taking control of [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]], which had previously been claimed by the Scots.<ref name=Carpenter129/> Subsequently, the two kings quarrelled over Malcolm's possessions in England, and Malcolm again invaded, ravaging Northumbria. At the [[Battle of Alnwick (1093)|Battle of Alnwick]], on 13 November 1093, Malcolm was ambushed by Norman forces led by Robert de Mowbray. Malcolm and his son Edward were killed and Malcolm's brother [[Donald III of Scotland|Donald]] seized the throne. William supported Malcolm's son [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan II]], who held power for a short time, and then another of Malcolm's sons, [[Edgar, King of Scotland|Edgar]]. Edgar conquered [[Lothian]] in 1094 and eventually removed Donald in 1097 with William's aid in a campaign led by [[Edgar \u00c6theling]]. The new king recognised William's authority over Lothian and attended William's court.\n\nWilliam made two forays into Wales in 1097. Nothing decisive was achieved, but a series of castles was constructed as a marchland defensive barrier.<ref>Philip J.

He needed money to fund this venture and pledged his [[Duchy of Normandy]] to William in return for a payment of 10,000 marks, which equates to about a quarter of William's annual revenue. In a display of the effectiveness of English taxation, William raised the money by levying a special, heavy, and much-resented tax upon the whole of England. He then ruled Normandy as regent in Robert's absence. Robert did not return until September 1100, one month after William's death.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-II-duke-of-Normandy|title=Robert II {{!}} duke of Normandy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=12 September 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs regent in Normandy, William campaigned in France from 1097 to 1099.

His chief minister was [[Ranulf Flambard]], whom he appointed [[Bishop of Durham]] in 1099: this was a political appointment, to a [[Episcopal see|see]] that was also a great [[fief]]dom. The particulars of the king's relationship with the people of England are not credibly documented. Contemporaries of William, as well as those writing after his death, roundly denounced him for presiding over what these dissenters considered a dissolute court.

Barlow also allows that William may have been sterile.

This period was followed by one of the [[Roman Empire]]'s rule or influence. The Germanic [[Vandal]]s invaded after that, followed by the equally brief re-establishment of a weak Roman rule by the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Islamic [[Caliphates]] came to power under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and the [[Fatimid Caliphate]]. The most enduring rule was that of the local Berber empires of the [[Almoravid dynasty]], [[Almohad Caliphate]], [[Hammadid dynasty]], [[Zirid dynasty]], [[Marinid dynasty]], [[Zayyanid dynasty]], and [[Wattasid dynasty]], extending from the 8th to 13th centuries. The [[Ottoman Empire]] for a period also controlled parts of the region.\n\nAlgeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia established the Arab Maghreb Union in 1989 to promote cooperation and [[economic integration]] in a [[common market]].

These trade relations can be dated at least to the [[Phoenicians]] in the 1st millennium BC. (The Phoenician colony of [[Carthage]] was founded, according to tradition, in what is now Tunisia circa 800 BC).\n\nThe [[Berbers]] predominantly constructed their coastal ports and cities. Later, some Phoenicians and Carthaginians arrived for trade. The main Berber and Phoenician settlements centered in the [[Gulf of Tunis]] ([[Carthage]], [[Utica, Tunisia]]) along the North African [[littoral]], between the [[Pillars of Hercules]] and the Libyan coast east of ancient [[Cyrenaica]]. They dominated the trade and intercourse of the [[Western Mediterranean]] for centuries. The Carthage defeat in the [[Punic Wars]] in 206 BC allowed Rome to establish the [[Province of Africa]] and control many of these ports. Rome eventually took control of the entire Maghreb north of the Atlas Mountains. Rome was greatly helped by the defection of King [[Massinissa]] and Carthage's eastern Numidian [[Massylii]] client-allies. Some of the most mountainous regions, such as the Moroccan [[Rif]], remained outside Rome's control. The pressure put on the [[Western Roman Empire]] by the [[Barbarian invasions]] (the [[Vandals]] and [[Hispania|Spain]]) in the 5th century reduced Roman control and led to the establishment of the [[Vandal Kingdom]]in 430 A.D. with its capital at Carthage. A century later, the Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] sent a force under General [[Belisarius]] that [[Vandalic War|succeeded in destroying]] the Vandal Kingdom. [[Exarchate of Carthage|Byzantine rule]] lasted for 150 years. The Berbers contested outside-the-area control. After the advent of [[Islam]] in the 640s\u2013700 AD period, Arabs took control of the entire region.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{main|Ifriqiya|Umayyad Caliphate|Abbasid Caliphate|Idrisid dynasty|Almoravid dynasty|Kingdom of Africa|Almohad Caliphate|Hafsid dynasty|Marinid dynasty|Ziyyanid dynasty|Wattasid dynasty}}\n[[File:Kairouan Mosque Courtyard.jpg|thumb|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]], founded by the Arab general Uqba Ibn Nafi (in 670), is the oldest mosque in the Maghreb city of [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DBqId4J_sIAC&pg=PA128&dq=kairouan+oldest+mosque+maghreb&hl=fr&ei=YDg8TbPsH8vAswbDhszzBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false Titus Burckhardt, ''Art of Islam, Language and Meaning: Commemorative Edition'', World Wisdom, Inc, 2009, page 128]</ref>]]\n\nThe Arabs reached the Maghreb in early [[Umayyad]] times. Islamic Berber kingdoms such as the [[Almohad]]s expansion and the spread of [[Islam]] contributed to the development of [[trans-Saharan trade]]. While restricted due to the cost and dangers, the trade was highly profitable. Commodities traded included such goods as salt, gold, ivory, and [[Arab slave trade|enslaved persons from sub-Saharan regions]]. Arab control over the Maghreb was quite weak. Various Islamic variations, such as the [[Ibadi]]s and the [[Shia]], were adopted by some Berbers, often leading to scorning of [[Caliph]]al control in favour of their own interpretation of Islam.\n\nAs a result of the invasion of the [[Banu Hilal]] Arabs, the [[Arabic language]] and dialects spread slowly without eliminating Berber. These Arabs had been set upon the Berbers by the [[Fatimid]]s in punishment for their [[Zirid]] former Berber clients who defected and abandoned [[Shiism]] in the 12th century. Throughout this period, the Berber world most often was divided into three states, roughly corresponding to modern Morocco, western Algeria, and eastern Algeria and [[Tunisia]]. The region was occasionally briefly unified, as under the [[Almohad]] Berber empire, and briefly under the [[Marinid]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Early modern history===\n{{main|Barbary Coast|Saadi dynasty|Alaouite dynasty|Ottoman Algeria|Ottoman Tunisia|Ottoman Tripolitania}}\n[[File:Guillaume Delisle North West Africa 1707.jpg|thumb|1707 map of northwest Africa by [[Guillaume Delisle]], including the Maghreb\nAfter the Middle Ages, the [[Ottoman Empire]] loosely controlled the area east of Morocco.]]\n\n===Modern history===\n{{further|Spanish Morocco|Spanish Sahara|French protectorate of Morocco|French Algeria|French Protectorate of Tunisia|Italian Libya}}\n{{further|North African Campaign (World War I)|North African Campaign|Western Desert Campaign}}\n{{further|Western Sahara War|Algerian War of Independence|History of Algeria since 1962|History of modern Tunisia|Kingdom of Libya|Libya under Gaddafi}}\nAfter the 19th century, areas of the Maghreb were colonized by [[France]], [[Spain]] and later [[Italy]].\n\nToday, more than two and a half million Maghrebi immigrants live in France, many from Algeria and Morocco.

In northern coastal towns, in particular, several waves of European immigrants influenced the population in the Medieval era. Most notable were the [[morisco]]s and [[muladi]]es, that is, the indigenous [[Spaniards]] (Moors) who were forcibly converted to Catholicism and later were expelled, together with ethnic Arab and Berber Muslims, from the [[Reconquista|Spanish Catholic Reconquista]].{{awkward|date=April 2020}} Other European contributions included the French, Italian, and English crew and passengers taken captive by the [[Barbary corsairs|corsairs]].

These were later augmented by Sephardic Jews from Spain and Portugal who, fleeing the Spanish Catholic Inquisition of the 15th and 16th centuries, established a presence in North Africa. They settled primarily in the urban trading centers. Many Jews from Spain emigrated to North America from the Maghreb in the 19th and early 20th centuries, or to France and Israel later in the 20th century after the latter was founded.\n\nAnother significant group are Turks, who migrated with the expansion of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. A large [[Kouloughli|ethnic Turkish]] population exists, particularly in Libya, Tunisia and Algeria.\n\nSub-Saharan Africans joined the population mix during centuries of [[trans-Saharan trade]]. Traders and slaves went to the Maghreb from the [[Sahel]] region. On the Saharan southern edge of the Maghreb are small communities of black populations, sometimes called [[Haratine]]. They appear to have descended from black populations who inhabited the Sahara during its last wet period and then migrated north as it turned to desert.\n\nIn Algeria especially, a large European minority, known as the \"[[pied noir]]s\", immigrated to the region, settling under French colonial rule in late 19th century. They established farms and businesses. The overwhelming majority of these, however, left Algeria during and following the war for independence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files_156/north-africa_5493/france-and-maghreb_5495/an-enhanced-partnership-with-the-maghreb-20.03.07_8821.html |title=France and Maghreb \u2013 An enhanced partnership with the Maghreb (March 20, 2007) |access-date=2007-07-11 |website=French Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs }}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Imedghasen.jpg|thumb|right|The [[mausoleum]] of [[Madghacen]]]]\nThe original religions of the peoples of the Maghreb seem<ref>[http://www.second-congress-matriarchal-studies.com/grasshoff.html]</ref> to have been based in and related to fertility cults of a strong [[Matriarchal religion|matriarchal pantheon]]. This theory is based on the social and linguistic structures of the [[Amazigh]] cultures that antedated all Egyptian and eastern Asian, northern Mediterranean, and European influences.\n\nHistoric records of religion in the Maghreb region show its gradual inclusion in the Classical World, with coastal colonies established first by Phoenicians, some Greeks, and later extensive conquest and colonization by the Romans. By the 2nd century of the common era, the area had become a center of Phoenician-speaking Christianity. Its bishops spoke and wrote in [[Punic]], and Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] was noted by his local accent. Roman settlers and Romanized populations converted to Christianity. The region produced figures such as Christian church writer [[Tertullian]] (c. 155 \u2013 c. 202); and Christian martyrs or leading figures such as [[Perpetua|Perpetua and Felicity]] (martyrs, c. 200 CE); [[Cyprian|St. Cyprian of Carthage]] (+ 258); [[Monica (Christian saint)|St. Monica]]; her son the philosopher [[St. Augustine]], Bishop of Hippo I (+ 430) (1); and [[Julia of Corsica|St. Julia of Carthage]] (5th century).\n\n===Islam===\n[[File:Kabylie Christian family.jpg|thumb|upright|Christian [[Berbers|Berber]] family from [[Kabylia]]]]\n[[Islam]] arrived in 647 and challenged the domination of Christianity. The first permanent foothold of Islam was the founding in 667 of the city of [[Kairouan]], in present-day [[Tunisia]]. [[Carthage]] fell to Muslims in 698 and the remainder of the region fell by 709. Islamization proceeded slowly. \n\nFrom the end of the 7th century, over a period of more than 400 years, the region's peoples converted to Islam. Many left during this time for Italy, although surviving letters showed correspondence from regional Christians to Rome up until the 12th century. Christianity was still a living faith. Although there were numerous conversions after the conquest, Muslims did not become a majority until some time late in the 9th centur. During the 10th century, Islam became by far the dominant religion in the region.<ref>''Staying Roman,'' Jonathan Conant, pp.&nbsp;362\u2013368, 2012</ref> Christian bishoprics and dioceses continued to be active, and continued their relations with the Christian Church of Rome.

[[Pope Gregory VII]] (1073\u201385) consecrated a new bishop for Hippo. Christianity seems to have suffered several shocks that led to its demise. First, many upper-class, urban-dwelling, Latin-speaking Christians left for Europe after the Muslim conquest. The second major influence were the large-scale conversions to Islam from the end of the 9th century. Many Christians of a much reduced community departed in the mid-11th century, and remnants were evacuated in the 12th by the Norman rulers of Sicily. The Latin-African language lingered a while longer.\n\nThere was a small but thriving Jewish community, as well as a small Christian community. Most Muslims follow the [[Sunni]] [[Maliki]] school. Small [[Ibadi]] communities remain in some areas. A strong tradition of venerating [[marabout]]s and saints' tombs is found throughout regions inhabited by Berbers. This practice was also common among the Jews of the region. Any map of the region demonstrates the tradition by the proliferation of \"[[Sidi]]\"s, showing places named after the marabouts. This tradition has declined through the 20th century. A network of ''[[zaouia]]s'' traditionally helped teach basic literacy and knowledge of Islam in rural regions.\n\nCommunities of Christians, mostly [[Catholics]] and [[Protestant]], persist in [[Algeria]] (100,000\u2013380,000),<ref>Deeb, Mary Jane. \"Religious minorities\", ''Algeria (Country Study)''.

Over the following two or three centuries, such Jewish traders became known as the Maghribi, a distinctive social group who traveled throughout the Mediterranean world. They passed this identification on from father to son. Their tight-knit pan-Maghreb community had the ability to use social sanctions as a credible alternative to legal recourse, which was weak at the time anyway. This unique institutional alternative permitted the Maghribis to very successfully participate in Mediterranean trade.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Avner Greif | title = Contract Enforceability and Economic Institutions in Early Trade: The Maghribi Traders' Coalition | version = | publisher = [[American Economic Association]] in its journal [[American Economic Review]] | date= June 1993 | url = http://www.stanford.edu/~avner/Greif_Papers/SSRNAUG202008.pdf | access-date = 2007-07-11 | author-link = Avner Greif }}.

The Maghreb's variations in elevation, rainfall, temperature, and soils give rise to distinct communities of plants and animals. The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) identifies several distinct [[ecoregion]]s in the Maghreb.\n\n====Mediterranean Maghreb====\n[[File:Chamaerops humilis argentea1.jpg|thumb|[[Chamaerops|Dwarf fan palm]], grown in Maghrebi countries]]\nThe portions of the Maghreb between the [[Atlas Mountains]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]], along with coastal [[Tripolitania]] and [[Cyrenaica]] in Libya, are home to [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]]. These ecoregions share many species of plants and animals with other portions of [[Mediterranean Basin]]. The southern extent of the Mediterranean Maghreb corresponds with the {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[Contour line#Precipitation and air moisture|isohyet]], or the southern range of the [[Olive|European Olive]] ''(Olea europea)''<ref>Dallman, Peter R.

Its central part is hyper-arid and supports little plant or animal life, but the northern portion of the desert receives occasional winter rains, while the strip along the Atlantic coast receives moisture from marine fog, which nourishes a greater variety of plants and animals. The northern edge of the Sahara corresponds to the 100&nbsp;mm isohyet, which is also the northern range of the [[date palm]] ''(Phoenix dactylifera)''.<ref name=\"Wickens\"/>\n* [[North Saharan steppe and woodlands]]: This ecoregion lies along the northern edge of the Sahara, next to the [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] ecoregions of the Mediterranean Maghreb and Cyrenaica. Winter rains sustain shrublands and dry woodlands that form a transition between the [[Mediterranean climate]] regions to the north and the hyper-arid Sahara proper to the south.

Vegetation is rare, and this ecoregion consists mostly of sand dunes ''([[erg (landform)|erg]])'', stone plateaus ''([[hamada]])'', gravel plains ''([[Desert pavement|reg]])'', dry valleys ''([[wadi]])'', and salt flats.

Among these is a culinary tradition that [[Habib Bourguiba]] defined as Western Arab, where bread or [[couscous]] are the staple foods, as opposed to Eastern Arab, where bread or white rice are the staple foods.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} In terms of food, similarities beyond the starches are found throughout the Arab world.\n\n==Genetics of the Maghreb population==\nThe Y-chromosome genetic structure of the Maghreb population seems to be modulated chiefly by geography. The Y-DNA Haplogroups [[haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] and [[haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J]] make up the vast majority of the genetic markers of the populations of the Maghreb. Haplogroup [[haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] is the most widespread among Maghrebi groups, especially the downstream lineage of [[E-M81|E1b1b1b1a]], which is typical of the indigenous Berbers of North-West Africa. Haplogroup J is more indicative of Middle East origins, and has its highest distribution among populations in Arabia and the Levant. Due to the distribution of [[E-M81]](E1b1b1b1a), which has reached its highest documented levels in the world at 95\u2013100% in some populations of the Maghreb, it has often been termed the \"Berber marker\" in the scientific literature.

These trade relations can be dated at least to the [[Phoenicians]] in the 1st millennium BC. (The Phoenician colony of [[Carthage]] was founded, according to tradition, in what is now Tunisia circa 800 BC).\n\nThe [[Berbers]] predominantly constructed their coastal ports and cities. Later, some Phoenicians and Carthaginians arrived for trade. The main Berber and Phoenician settlements centered in the [[Gulf of Tunis]] ([[Carthage]], [[Utica, Tunisia]]) along the North African [[littoral]], between the [[Pillars of Hercules]] and the Libyan coast east of ancient [[Cyrenaica]]. They dominated the trade and intercourse of the [[Western Mediterranean]] for centuries. The Carthage defeat in the [[Punic Wars]] in 206 BC allowed Rome to establish the [[Province of Africa]] and control many of these ports. Rome eventually took control of the entire Maghreb north of the Atlas Mountains. Rome was greatly helped by the defection of King [[Massinissa]] and Carthage's eastern Numidian [[Massylii]] client-allies. Some of the most mountainous regions, such as the Moroccan [[Rif]], remained outside Rome's control. The pressure put on the [[Western Roman Empire]] by the [[Barbarian invasions]] (the [[Vandals]] and [[Hispania|Spain]]) in the 5th century reduced Roman control and led to the establishment of the [[Vandal Kingdom]]in 430 A.D. with its capital at Carthage. A century later, the Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] sent a force under General [[Belisarius]] that [[Vandalic War|succeeded in destroying]] the Vandal Kingdom. [[Exarchate of Carthage|Byzantine rule]] lasted for 150 years. The Berbers contested outside-the-area control. After the advent of [[Islam]] in the 640s\u2013700 AD period, Arabs took control of the entire region.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{main|Ifriqiya|Umayyad Caliphate|Abbasid Caliphate|Idrisid dynasty|Almoravid dynasty|Kingdom of Africa|Almohad Caliphate|Hafsid dynasty|Marinid dynasty|Ziyyanid dynasty|Wattasid dynasty}}\n[[File:Kairouan Mosque Courtyard.jpg|thumb|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]], founded by the Arab general Uqba Ibn Nafi (in 670), is the oldest mosque in the Maghreb city of [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DBqId4J_sIAC&pg=PA128&dq=kairouan+oldest+mosque+maghreb&hl=fr&ei=YDg8TbPsH8vAswbDhszzBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false Titus Burckhardt, ''Art of Islam, Language and Meaning: Commemorative Edition'', World Wisdom, Inc, 2009, page 128]</ref>]]\n\nThe Arabs reached the Maghreb in early [[Umayyad]] times. Islamic Berber kingdoms such as the [[Almohad]]s expansion and the spread of [[Islam]] contributed to the development of [[trans-Saharan trade]]. While restricted due to the cost and dangers, the trade was highly profitable. Commodities traded included such goods as salt, gold, ivory, and [[Arab slave trade|enslaved persons from sub-Saharan regions]]. Arab control over the Maghreb was quite weak. Various Islamic variations, such as the [[Ibadi]]s and the [[Shia]], were adopted by some Berbers, often leading to scorning of [[Caliph]]al control in favour of their own interpretation of Islam.\n\nAs a result of the invasion of the [[Banu Hilal]] Arabs, the [[Arabic language]] and dialects spread slowly without eliminating Berber. These Arabs had been set upon the Berbers by the [[Fatimid]]s in punishment for their [[Zirid]] former Berber clients who defected and abandoned [[Shiism]] in the 12th century. Throughout this period, the Berber world most often was divided into three states, roughly corresponding to modern Morocco, western Algeria, and eastern Algeria and [[Tunisia]]. The region was occasionally briefly unified, as under the [[Almohad]] Berber empire, and briefly under the [[Marinid]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Early modern history===\n{{main|Barbary Coast|Saadi dynasty|Alaouite dynasty|Ottoman Algeria|Ottoman Tunisia|Ottoman Tripolitania}}\n[[File:Guillaume Delisle North West Africa 1707.jpg|thumb|1707 map of northwest Africa by [[Guillaume Delisle]], including the Maghreb\nAfter the Middle Ages, the [[Ottoman Empire]] loosely controlled the area east of Morocco.]]\n\n===Modern history===\n{{further|Spanish Morocco|Spanish Sahara|French protectorate of Morocco|French Algeria|French Protectorate of Tunisia|Italian Libya}}\n{{further|North African Campaign (World War I)|North African Campaign|Western Desert Campaign}}\n{{further|Western Sahara War|Algerian War of Independence|History of Algeria since 1962|History of modern Tunisia|Kingdom of Libya|Libya under Gaddafi}}\nAfter the 19th century, areas of the Maghreb were colonized by [[France]], [[Spain]] and later [[Italy]].\n\nToday, more than two and a half million Maghrebi immigrants live in France, many from Algeria and Morocco.

Many Jews from Spain emigrated to North America from the Maghreb in the 19th and early 20th centuries, or to France and Israel later in the 20th century after the latter was founded.\n\nAnother significant group are Turks, who migrated with the expansion of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. A large [[Kouloughli|ethnic Turkish]] population exists, particularly in Libya, Tunisia and Algeria.\n\nSub-Saharan Africans joined the population mix during centuries of [[trans-Saharan trade]]. Traders and slaves went to the Maghreb from the [[Sahel]] region. On the Saharan southern edge of the Maghreb are small communities of black populations, sometimes called [[Haratine]]. They appear to have descended from black populations who inhabited the Sahara during its last wet period and then migrated north as it turned to desert.\n\nIn Algeria especially, a large European minority, known as the \"[[pied noir]]s\", immigrated to the region, settling under French colonial rule in late 19th century. They established farms and businesses. The overwhelming majority of these, however, left Algeria during and following the war for independence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files_156/north-africa_5493/france-and-maghreb_5495/an-enhanced-partnership-with-the-maghreb-20.03.07_8821.html |title=France and Maghreb \u2013 An enhanced partnership with the Maghreb (March 20, 2007) |access-date=2007-07-11 |website=French Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs }}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Imedghasen.jpg|thumb|right|The [[mausoleum]] of [[Madghacen]]]]\nThe original religions of the peoples of the Maghreb seem<ref>[http://www.second-congress-matriarchal-studies.com/grasshoff.html]</ref> to have been based in and related to fertility cults of a strong [[Matriarchal religion|matriarchal pantheon]]. This theory is based on the social and linguistic structures of the [[Amazigh]] cultures that antedated all Egyptian and eastern Asian, northern Mediterranean, and European influences.\n\nHistoric records of religion in the Maghreb region show its gradual inclusion in the Classical World, with coastal colonies established first by Phoenicians, some Greeks, and later extensive conquest and colonization by the Romans. By the 2nd century of the common era, the area had become a center of Phoenician-speaking Christianity. Its bishops spoke and wrote in [[Punic]], and Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] was noted by his local accent. Roman settlers and Romanized populations converted to Christianity. The region produced figures such as Christian church writer [[Tertullian]] (c. 155 \u2013 c. 202); and Christian martyrs or leading figures such as [[Perpetua|Perpetua and Felicity]] (martyrs, c. 200 CE); [[Cyprian|St. Cyprian of Carthage]] (+ 258); [[Monica (Christian saint)|St. Monica]]; her son the philosopher [[St. Augustine]], Bishop of Hippo I (+ 430) (1); and [[Julia of Corsica|St. Julia of Carthage]] (5th century).\n\n===Islam===\n[[File:Kabylie Christian family.jpg|thumb|upright|Christian [[Berbers|Berber]] family from [[Kabylia]]]]\n[[Islam]] arrived in 647 and challenged the domination of Christianity. The first permanent foothold of Islam was the founding in 667 of the city of [[Kairouan]], in present-day [[Tunisia]]. [[Carthage]] fell to Muslims in 698 and the remainder of the region fell by 709. Islamization proceeded slowly. \n\nFrom the end of the 7th century, over a period of more than 400 years, the region's peoples converted to Islam. Many left during this time for Italy, although surviving letters showed correspondence from regional Christians to Rome up until the 12th century. Christianity was still a living faith. Although there were numerous conversions after the conquest, Muslims did not become a majority until some time late in the 9th centur. During the 10th century, Islam became by far the dominant religion in the region.<ref>''Staying Roman,'' Jonathan Conant, pp.&nbsp;362\u2013368, 2012</ref> Christian bishoprics and dioceses continued to be active, and continued their relations with the Christian Church of Rome. As late as the reign of Pope [[Benedict VII]] (974\u2013983), a new [[Archdiocese of Carthage|Archbishop of Carthage]] was consecrated. From the 10th century, Christianity declined in the region.<ref>Insoll, T.

[[Pope Gregory VII]] (1073\u201385) consecrated a new bishop for Hippo. Christianity seems to have suffered several shocks that led to its demise. First, many upper-class, urban-dwelling, Latin-speaking Christians left for Europe after the Muslim conquest. The second major influence were the large-scale conversions to Islam from the end of the 9th century. Many Christians of a much reduced community departed in the mid-11th century, and remnants were evacuated in the 12th by the Norman rulers of Sicily. The Latin-African language lingered a while longer.\n\nThere was a small but thriving Jewish community, as well as a small Christian community. Most Muslims follow the [[Sunni]] [[Maliki]] school. Small [[Ibadi]] communities remain in some areas. A strong tradition of venerating [[marabout]]s and saints' tombs is found throughout regions inhabited by Berbers. This practice was also common among the Jews of the region. Any map of the region demonstrates the tradition by the proliferation of \"[[Sidi]]\"s, showing places named after the marabouts. This tradition has declined through the 20th century. A network of ''[[zaouia]]s'' traditionally helped teach basic literacy and knowledge of Islam in rural regions.\n\nCommunities of Christians, mostly [[Catholics]] and [[Protestant]], persist in [[Algeria]] (100,000\u2013380,000),<ref>Deeb, Mary Jane. \"Religious minorities\", ''Algeria (Country Study)''.

Over the following two or three centuries, such Jewish traders became known as the Maghribi, a distinctive social group who traveled throughout the Mediterranean world. They passed this identification on from father to son. Their tight-knit pan-Maghreb community had the ability to use social sanctions as a credible alternative to legal recourse, which was weak at the time anyway. This unique institutional alternative permitted the Maghribis to very successfully participate in Mediterranean trade.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Avner Greif | title = Contract Enforceability and Economic Institutions in Early Trade: The Maghribi Traders' Coalition | version = | publisher = [[American Economic Association]] in its journal [[American Economic Review]] | date= June 1993 | url = http://www.stanford.edu/~avner/Greif_Papers/SSRNAUG202008.pdf | access-date = 2007-07-11 | author-link = Avner Greif }}.

The Maghreb's variations in elevation, rainfall, temperature, and soils give rise to distinct communities of plants and animals. The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) identifies several distinct [[ecoregion]]s in the Maghreb.\n\n====Mediterranean Maghreb====\n[[File:Chamaerops humilis argentea1.jpg|thumb|[[Chamaerops|Dwarf fan palm]], grown in Maghrebi countries]]\nThe portions of the Maghreb between the [[Atlas Mountains]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]], along with coastal [[Tripolitania]] and [[Cyrenaica]] in Libya, are home to [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]].

Its central part is hyper-arid and supports little plant or animal life, but the northern portion of the desert receives occasional winter rains, while the strip along the Atlantic coast receives moisture from marine fog, which nourishes a greater variety of plants and animals.

Among these is a culinary tradition that [[Habib Bourguiba]] defined as Western Arab, where [[couscous]] is the staple food, as opposed to Eastern Arab, where white rice is the staple food. In terms of food, similarities beyond the starches are found throughout the Arab world.\n\n==Genetics of the Maghreb population==\nThe Y-chromosome genetic structure of the Maghreb population seems to be modulated chiefly by geography. The Y-DNA Haplogroups [[haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] and [[haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J]] make up the vast majority of the genetic markers of the populations of the Maghreb. Haplogroup [[haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] is the most widespread among Maghrebi groups, especially the downstream lineage of [[E-M81|E1b1b1b1a]], which is typical of the indigenous Berbers of North-West Africa. Haplogroup J is more indicative of Middle East origins, and has its highest distribution among populations in Arabia and the Levant. Due to the distribution of [[E-M81]](E1b1b1b1a), which has reached its highest documented levels in the world at 95\u2013100% in some populations of the Maghreb, it has often been termed the \"Berber marker\" in the scientific literature.
