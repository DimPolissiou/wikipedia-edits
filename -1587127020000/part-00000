{"title_page": "List of The Chronicles of Amber characters", "text_new": "''[[The Chronicles of Amber]]'' is a [[fantasy series]] written by [[Roger Zelazny]] chiefly in ten books published from 1970 to 1991. It features a great variety of characters from a myriad [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]] (including  \"our\" Earth [[universe]]). All universes spiral out on a continuum, which are more closely related to one end, Amber (and its history and functions), or slides on a scale closer and closer to Amber's opposite, the Courts of Chaos, at the other.\n\n==Amberites==\nCharacters from Amber are referred to as Amberites.\n\n===The Amber royal family===\nMuch information about the royal family is compiled only in the authorized companion book ''Roger Zelazny's Visual Guide to Castle Amber''. Some personal colors and offspring are identified only there.\n\nThe founder of the family is '''[[Dworkin Barimen]]''', who first appears as a mad sorcerer. He is the creator of [[The Pattern (The Chronicles of Amber)|the Primal Pattern]] and father of Oberon. The surname Barimen is an anagram of \"in Amber\" and may or may not have been intended as the name of a House of Chaos; it also suspiciously similar to the name \u201cShambarimen\u201d, the maker of a major artifact in [[Philip Jose Farmer]]'s [[World of Tiers]] series and is likely a voluntary tip of the hat to him.\n\nDworkin\u2019s children and grandchildren are:\n\n* {{Anchor|Oberon}}'''Oberon''', liege lord of Amber and only known child of Dworkin (by the Unicorn?). His children are:\n* ''by Cymnea'':\n** {{Anchor|Benedict}}'''Benedict''' (orange, yellow, brown), The master tactician of the family as well as the unmatched master of all martial weapons, and a man who seldom smiles. He chose to remove himself from the struggle for the crown, leaving Eric and Corwin as the eldest surviving heirs. Moreover, Oberon declared his marriage with Cymnea null and void, rendering all his children by her retroactively illegitimate. Benedict has had an affair with Lintra the Hellmaid of Chaos, during a brief interlude in hostilities between them, and is unaware that she bore a child as a result of this. Benedict and Lintra subsequently came to blows again, and Benedict slew Lintra but lost his arm. He still fights better with one arm than anybody else with two.\n*** '''Dara''', great-granddaughter of Benedict after his affair with Lintra. Because of the differing speed of time-flow in different Shadows and between Amber and Chaos, she is first met as a fairly young woman: But within only a couple of weeks of Amber time, she has grown considerably older and embittered in Chaos, to herself be a mother of at least three fully adult children.\n** '''Osric''' (silver & red) and '''Finndo''' (green & gold), long-dead brothers of whom we learn little. It is suggested that they conspired to take the throne from their father, after which they were sent to the front lines of a war from which they did not return.\n* ''by Faiella'':\n** '''Eric''' (black & red), Corwin's elder full-brother (illegitimate because Oberon & Faiella were not married at the time of his birth). An arrogant yet competent would-be king of Amber; he commands the loyalty of Julian, Caine, and G\u00e9rard. Corwin and Eric's rivalry for the throne drives much of the plot of the first two books. After Benedict, Eric was reputedly the greatest swordsman in the Universe of Amber and Shadow. A few centuries before the events of the first novels, he and Corwin decided to settle their rivalry in a duel to the death. In the event, Eric, fearing Oberon's wrath, left Corwin, gravely injured, on Earth in the 17th&nbsp;century. Corwin recovered physically but his memory was gone. Eric maintained that Corwin had left Amber of his own volition, but Oberon would often hint that he suspected Eric of killing Corwin. When Oberon disappeared, he was lured into Shadow in order to find a tool to fix the Pattern after Brand damaged it. Eric soon allied with Caine and Julian to hold the throne.\n** '''[[Corwin of Amber]]''' (silver & black), the narrator of the first five books. He is the first legitimate living child of Oberon who desires the throne. His years on [[Earth]] seem to have softened him somewhat from his earlier arrogant beliefs, particularly with respect to the rest of the family, and to the residents of Shadow, who are regarded by some in the family as creations of their own minds, to be used and abused as they see fit. He also improved his political skills and his swordsmanship to the point where he fights Eric to a draw in ''[[Nine Princes in Amber]]''.\n*** '''[[Merlin of Amber]]''' (purple and grey), son of Corwin and Dara following a brief mid-afternoon fling. The narrator of the second set of five books. He was raised in the Courts of Chaos, and Corwin is unaware of his son's existence until he is informed by Dara late in the series. Adopting Earth, home to Flora and to his father, as his own home, he becomes a software developer in [[San Francisco]]. He finds himself subject to attempts on his life, which turn out to be instigated by his friend Luke, who is really Brand's son Rinaldo. He also has two younger half-brothers, Despil and Jurt, on his mother's side (from her second husband, Lord Gramble Sawall of Chaos), and an older step-halfbrother, Mandor, from Gramble's own prior marriage.\n** '''Deirdre''' (silver & black), Corwin's sister. Corwin's feelings for Deirdre are decidedly [[incest|un-brotherly]], and she appears to return his affection. She is a minor character in the Corwin cycle, but the ''Visual Guide to Amber'' says that she was the best-loved of the royals, due to her beauty and compassion. She dresses in black plate armor and used an axe in battle. Her mother was Faiella, who died while bearing Deirdre.<ref>{{cite book |last=Zelazny |first=Roger |chapter=Nine Princes in Amber |title=The Great Book of Amber |place=New York |publisher=Avon Books |year=1999 |edition=print}}</ref>\n* ''by Clarissa'', known as \"the redheads\":\n** '''Fiona''' (green, lavender, purple), a deft mind and stunning beauty. Sorceress of the family. With Bleys, she was one of the original co-conspirators with Brand to unseat Oberon and take the throne. Corwin initially does not like her, but they become closer during the events of the series. Later she befriends her nephew Merlin and helps him solve his own mysteries.\n** '''Bleys''' (red & orange), a dashing and charming extrovert who partners with Corwin in the effort to retake Amber from Eric. He is also a sorcerer, though of lesser skill than his two full siblings, and favors the sword.\n** '''Brand''' (green), a [[manic depressive]] [[megalomania]]c sorcerer. He makes [[Faustian]] bargains with the forces of Chaos in order to gain power, apparently becoming a \"living Trump\" who can move anywhere in Shadow by willing it. By the time of the final conflict at the Courts of Chaos, he is no longer quite human, even by Amberite standards, and is quite insane.\n*** '''Rinaldo''', also known as '''Luke''', son of Brand and Jasra. He and Merlin both studied at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] and then worked with a computer company Grand Design. Luke does not tell much about himself, but shows he is strong, intelligent and has a salesman's ability to convince people and make them do things he wants. Luke plots revenge against the Royal Family, especially Merlin and Caine, for his father's death. After Caine's death, he is persuaded to give up the vendetta. He appears to prefer his own chosen alias of Luke to his given name of Rinaldo, even to people who know his birth name.\n* ''by Lady Moins of Rebma'':\n** '''Llewella''' (green, lavender, gray), was born of an affair Oberon had with Moins. She is older than Brand and younger than Bleys: Technically illegitimate, she was legally adopted to spite Clarissa after their final divorce. Llewella removed herself from the presence of her family, and lives in ''Rebma'', an underwater city that is a reflection of Amber. Hers is something of a sad existence. She stands with her half-siblings in the final confrontation at the Courts of Chaos.\n* ''by Harla'':\n** None known\n* ''by Rilga'':\n** '''Caine''' (black & green), a calculating, realistic manipulator with naval talents and lifestyle. He and G\u00e9rard command both the Amber Navy and the merchant fleets which ply a thousand different Shadow oceans in their trade. Caine seemed to give Corwin the sea passage to Amber on his first assault, but then ambushed him with help from Eric, who was controlling the weather. After Eric's death and Corwin's assumption of power, Caine faked his own death in order to \"go underground\" in finding the author of the threat to Amber among the Royal Family. He arranged for Corwin to discover his \"body\", actually that of one of his shadows, and later stabbed Corwin after it appeared to him that Corwin, by bringing back Brand, was attempting to revive the plot against Oberon. Caine reappeared in the final battle at the Courts of Chaos, his silver arrows killing Brand. In the second set of novels, he himself is killed by Luke/Rinaldo as revenge for Brand's death. This results in Julian and G\u00e9rard declaring a [[Feud|vendetta]] against Luke.\n** '''Julian''' (white & black), a cold, sinister hunter with a calm manner and biting tongue. He is usually found guarding the Forest of Arden in Amber, with his hell-hounds &ndash; beasts out of Shadow who are quite capable of ripping bodies, and metal, with their teeth. He has incestuous feelings for Fiona. Eventually he admits to Corwin that he recommended that Corwin be blinded in captivity, to render him useless to Brand's [[cabal]] (and thus in a way saving his life). With Eric and Caine, Julian formed the counter-cabal to hold the throne.\n** '''G\u00e9rard''' (blue & gray), a trusted brother, the strongest man in the multiverse and called \"the best of all of us\" by Brand. His loyalty is not, however, backed up with intelligence. He resents being manipulated by his siblings, preferring the face-to-face confrontation and the contest of strength, not of guile. When the family contacts Brand in his shadow prison, G\u00e9rard is the first to grab an axe, teleport into Brand's cell, and free him. Later he loyally guards Brand after he is mysteriously stabbed after returning to Amber.\n* ''by Dybele''\n** '''Florimel''' (green & gray), known as '''Flora''', is regarded as shallow or a [[dumb blonde]] by her siblings, yet she often is on the winning side. Her beauty is legendary in many Shadows and also in Amber itself. She was placed on Earth to keep an eye on Corwin while he was in the hospital. She likes nothing better than to live a pampered existence in her luxurious house in [[Westchester, New York]] and entertain her many lovers. Her solution to not using her powers on Earth is to always have a [[hand grenade]] on her person.\n* ''by Kinta'', introduced in the Merlin Cycle:\n** '''Coral''', a princess from a nearby shadow called Begma, a result of Oberon's secret short liaison with the wife of a Begman diplomat. Although Coral is Merlin's willing lover, she is actually married to Rinaldo as part of a treaty between royal families. Coral is half-sister to Nayda.\n* ''by Paulette''\n** '''Random''' (orange, red, brown), a sneaky rascal, often irritating and called a 'punk' by his older siblings. Random helps Corwin regain his memory, and supports Corwin in his quest for the throne of Amber. After the final battle at the Courts of Chaos, the Unicorn chooses Random himself to succeed Oberon. Random's passions before this were gliding and [[drum kit|drumming]]. It was after a \"hot set\" in his favorite Shadow that Brand contacted him through a card in a hand of [[poker]] he was playing, setting into motion the events that led him to contact Corwin at Flora's house in [[Westchester, New York]].\n*** '''Martin''', son of Random by Moire's daughter Morganthe. After walking the Pattern in Rebma, he wandered in Shadow until he encountered Benedict, who became a mentor. Brand later created a Trump for Martin, using it to summon him to the Primal Pattern, where he stabbed Martin, using the blood he shed to damage the Primal Pattern and allow the forces of Chaos to threaten Amber.\n** '''Mirelle''' (red & yellow)\n* ''by Lora'', introduced in the Merlin Cycle &ndash; or possibly by Harla (see above):\n** '''Delwin''' (brown & black) and '''Sand''' (pale tan & dark brown), twin brother and sister. They only lived a short time in Amber, preferring to live in the Shadow worlds and keep themselves removed from the affairs of their siblings. (In the novel ''Blood of Amber'', Merlin names Harla as the mother of Delwin and Sand and further states that Oberon was married to Harla while still married to Rilga, making this a bigamous marriage and calling the legitimacy of Delwin and Sand into question. It is known that neither has any interest in dynastic struggles.)\n* ''by Deela'', an enemy of Amber, introduced in the Merlin Cycle:\n** '''Dalt''' (black & green), Oberon's illegitimate son, a mercenary who possesses a keen hatred of Amber &ndash; his symbol is a lion rending a unicorn. He was conceived while Deela was Oberon's prisoner. (Or so he claims, probably having been told by his mother that Deela was raped. That may well be true, or it may be that she seduced Oberon as a way of working her way out of imprisonment and lied about it afterwards, when hostilities between Amber and Chaos resumed.) He is known to hang around the kingdom of Kashfa although he is outlawed there, and was Luke's childhood friend. Dalt is very strong, and recovered from being impaled on a sword by Benedict.\n\nThe names of Florimel's and Random's mothers are not given in the novels; the names here are taken from the ''Visual Guide to Amber'' and the ''Complete Amber Sourcebook''. The ''Visual Guide'' adds a younger daughter of Paulette, '''Mirelle''', but she does not appear in any of the novels.\n\nCaine's parentage varies from book to book: Corwin places him above Bleys in the succession &nbsp; and Random also alludes to this &nbsp; but Merlin says he is a full brother of Julian and G\u00e9rard. (Both statements could be true if Caine is, in fact, older than any of Clarissa's children, and the result of an illegitimate affair with Rilga but legally adopted into the line before Clarissa's children, just as Llewella was born illegitimate but legally adopted. Although Oberon did not actually marry Rilga till after finally divorcing Clarissa after the birth of Brand.) The ''Visual Guide to Amber'' and the ''Complete Amber Sourcebook'', though both are authorised works, contradict each other.<ref>For more details on \nCaine's parentage, see section&nbsp;A7 of the [http://leutheuser.com/amber/FAQ.html Amber FAQ].</ref> Corwin also ignores his sisters in the succession.\n\nIt is also mentioned that, although Llewella definitely (and possibly Caine, as mentioned above) was legally adopted into the family after being born illegitimate, this did '''not''' happen to Eric, because Oberon needed to remain on good terms with Cymnea's family, and Eric was perpetually bitter about this.\n\nIn ''[[Nine Princes in Amber]]'' Corwin mentions his fondness for Random as related to being full brothers instead of half-brothers. However, he is still suffering from brain damage at the time. Given that only two books later, it is Corwin himself who mentions that his mother Faiella died giving birth to Deirdre, and Random was only born much later after many more children to other women, this can be put down to either an official authorial change and [[retcon]] (in book&nbsp;3), or to Corwin's still-damaged memory (in book&nbsp;1).\n\nIn the Merlin Cycle, a Pattern-created ghost of Oberon claims that there were a total of 47&nbsp;children, though only 20 are mentioned in the books. Corwin reliably states (while walking the pattern) there were once 15&nbsp;brothers and 8&nbsp;sisters, going on to say 6&nbsp;brothers are dead as are 2&nbsp;sisters (or possibly 4). Having no knowledge of Dalt at the time, this makes a total of 24&nbsp;''known'' children of Oberon, of which only 21 are ever named. One daughter and 3&nbsp;sons are never named in any of the books or accompanying materials.\n\n===Other Amberites===\n*'''Lord Rein''', a [[minstrel]] who was once knighted by Corwin\n*'''Roger''', a guard in Castle Amber, and amateur author. Likely this is Zelazny writing himself into his novel.  Corwin describes Roger as lean, cadaverous, pipe-smoking, and grinning, a description that would fit the author. Roger says that he is writing a \"philosophical romance shot through with elements of horror and morbidity,\" and that he composes the \"horror\" portions while on duty in the dungeon.\n*'''Droppa MaPantz''', the court [[jester]] in the Merlin Cycle. From time to time King Random takes him to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] to gather new material. Merlin and Corwin's friend Bill from Earth recognizes some of his jokes as being taken from [[George Carlin]]'s act.\n*'''Bloody Bill''', '''Bloody Andy''', '''Bloody Eddie''', [[restaurateur]]s in Amber.  They successively run the same establishment with a reputation for good food and random violence.  The restaurant is traditionally known by the name of the previous, deceased, owner, be it Bill, Andy etc.  Proper table manners at \"Bloody Bill's\" (later \"Bloody Andy's\") include making sure your sword is partly unsheathed and visible to all.  The Fish Fry is to-die-for (literally).\n*'''Vinta Bayle''', Caine's mistress and daughter to Baron Bayle, Amber's [[vintner]].  For a time she is possessed by the ''ty'iga'' spirit which Dara has set to watch over Merlin.  The ''ty'iga'' likes to seduce Merlin when in human form.\n*'''Jopin''', keeper of the lighthouse at Cabra. A former sea captain who enjoys the simplicity and solitude of his job.\n\n==The Courts of Chaos==\nPerhaps fittingly, in all but the last novel there isn\u2019t a specific name for characters from the Courts of Chaos.  Both ''Chaosites'' and ''Chaosians'' are popular choices by fans; through the first series, they are referred to only as \u201c''the Courts''\u201d, or as \u201c''the forces of Chaos''\u201d. In the final book, those of the Courts of Chaos are referred to as ''Chaosites'' by Merlin.\n\n<!-- please keep this section alphabetical -->\n*'''Borel''', a duke and master of arms of house Hendrake. Dara's fencing instructor.\n*{{Anchor|Dara}}'''Dara''', great-granddaughter of Benedict, Corwin's lover, mother of [[Merlin of Amber]], and wife of the Chaos nobleman Gramble Sawall\n*'''Gilva''', a warrior-maiden of house Hendrake.\n*'''Gramble Sawall''', Dara's husband, an ally of King Swayvil.\n*'''Jurt''' and '''Despil''', Merlin's half brothers &ndash; sons of Dara (Merlin's mother) and Gramble Sawall. Jurt hates Merlin, while Despil tries to avoid conflicts.\n*'''[[Merlin of Amber]]''', son of Dara and Corwin, great-great-grandson of Benedict, and narrator of the second cycle of books.\n*'''Mandor''', Merlin's stepbrother, a son of Gramble Sawall from a previous marriage. He is a [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli|machiavellian]] manipulator, but Merlin likes him. His name may be derived from the Latin ''[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mandare mandare]'', and is an anagram of \"Random\".\n*'''Suhuy''' (called ''Uncle Suhuy'' by Merlin), keeper of [[the Logrus]] and friendly adversary of [[Dworkin Barimen|Dworkin]].\n*'''Swayvil''', King of Chaos during the Merlin Cycle.\n\n==Shadow dwellers==\n\n<!-- please keep this section alphabetical -->\n*'''Ganelon''', an exile from Avalon, killed and impersonated by Oberon. Based on the character of the same name from ''[[The Song of Roland]]''.\n*'''Ghostwheel''', a sentient computer created by [[Merlin of Amber]], capable of generating Trump connections at a rate of thousands per second, apparently regarded by the Pattern and Logrus as a minor upstart in the ranks of cosmic powers.\n*'''Hugi''', a fatalist talking [[raven]]. Based on Hugin, one of the two ravens who perched on [[Odin]]'s shoulders in [[Norse mythology]].\n*'''Jasra''', a powerful sorceress, mother of Luke, tutor of Julia, former handmaid to Dara and deposed ruler of the Keep of Four Worlds.  She has venomous lips and a thirst for power.\n*'''Julia Barnes''', Merlin's ex-girlfriend, whom he finds murdered in her San Francisco apartment by a doglike monster from another world. This is later revealed to be a deception; Julia is alive under the alias of '''Mask''' and has become a sorceress, taking over the Keep of Four Worlds from Jasra. Merlin had taken her with him on a shadow walk, which led to their breakup and to her pursuing an interest in occult magic.\n* '''Lancelot''', one of Ganelon's knights who was rescued by Corwin. Based on [[Sir Lancelot]] from [[Arthurian legend]].\n*'''Lorraine''', a [[prostitute|camp follower]] with [[second sight]] in a shadow of the same name.\n*'''Victor Melman''', occultist from Earth, associate and possible teacher of Julia Barnes, student of Jasra.  Killed by Merlin using primal chaos.\n*'''Moire''', queen of Rebma, maternal grandmother of Random's son Martin through her daughter Morganthe, who committed suicide after being abandoned by Random.\n*'''Rhanda''', a vampire-like being called a ''shroudling''. She and Merlin were childhood playmates.\n*'''Bill Roth''', a lawyer from Earth, who aids Corwin and ends up being something of a confidant for Merlin, as well as legal counsel to the court of Amber.  In ''[[Sign of the Unicorn]]'', Bill, frustrated by Corwin's evasiveness, complains, \"I've a peculiar feeling that I may never see you again. It is as if I were one of those minor characters in a melodrama who gets shuffled offstage without ever learning how things turn out.\"\n*'''Sharu Garrul''', Jasra's former tutor and a previous ruler of the Keep of the Four Worlds.\n* '''The Sphinx''', a monster that devours those who cannot answer its riddles. Based on the [[Sphinx#Greek traditions|riddling Sphinx of Thebes]] in the Greek myth of [[Oedipus]].\n*The '''Ty'iga''', a bodyless demon who inhabits the bodies of others.  She is female, or at least feminine, though she is able to possess male bodies as well.  When she leaves one's body the possessed person feels like waking up from a sleep and has no memory of the intervening time.  She appears as '''Dan Martinez''', '''George Hansen''', '''Meg Devlin''', '''Vinta Bayle''' and it is revealed that she was also '''Gail Lampron''', a former girlfriend of Luke.  She is finally bound in the body of '''Nayda''', Coral's sister, since Nayda actually died from an illness just as she was possessed. She was originally set to watch and protect Merlin by his mother Dara, unless she caught sight of the Jewel.\n*'''Vialle''', a blind noblewoman from Rebma whom Random is forced to marry.  This was intended as a punishment for Random's affair with Moire's late daughter.  Random would be bound to stay in Rebma for a year, and Vialle would gain status as a noble of Amber.  To everyone's surprise, the marriage worked out well.  She is artistic, creating sculptures by touch, specializing in busts of the Amberites.  Vialle gives Luke/Rinaldo her protection in the form of her ring, ensuring that the [[Feud|vendetta]] against him by Caine's supporters will not be allowed to proceed.\n*'''Ygg''', a talking tree planted by Oberon to mark the border between Order and Chaos. Based on [[Yggdrasil]], the tree that holds up the sky in northern Germanic and Icelandic myths.\n\n==The Powers==\nThe two main beings who control and create the Amber [[multiverse]] are The Pattern and The Logrus, who are immensely competitive and often cause collateral damage and casualties in the course of their struggles against each other.\n* '''[[The Pattern (The Chronicles of Amber)|The Pattern]]''', sentient embodiment of Order. It is capable of manifesting as a [[unicorn]], which according to Dworkin is the mother of Oberon, and of creating pattern-ghosts of any who have walked its path. In the Merlin cycle, the Pattern's spirit is implied to be older than the Primal Pattern, since it refers to events in its competition with the Logrus that predate Dworkin's creation of that Pattern. It appears to wish to impose unending, unmoving, static pure order over the universe.\n* '''[[The Logrus]]''', embodiment of Chaos, also sentient and capable of manifesting as a giant serpent, and of creating semi-solid projections similar to pattern-ghosts. It claims that the Jewel of Judgement was its eye, stolen by the Unicorn; it appears to desire to return all existence to the primal chaos from which it came.\n* '''Corwin's Pattern''', created by Corwin in ''[[The Courts of Chaos]]'', it is also sentient and attempts to remain neutral in the conflict between the higher powers. It is also able to produce pattern-ghosts, and allies itself with Merlin, who along with Corwin is the only other being to walk its path.\n* '''The Ghostwheel''', a computer-based, pattern-manipulating artificial intelligence created by Merlin in a secret location in the shadows, near Chaos. Like the trump cards, it is able to transport objects between shadow worlds, and to view goings-on in remote locations. It is not a cosmic-power like the patterns, but is able to act in defiance of them. The Ghostwheel is loyal to Merlin, and refers to him as \"dad\".\n* '''The Unicorn''', a mysterious individual who only appears rarely, in the shape of a [[unicorn]], at crucial points in some of the Amber stories. It always arrives to act as a protector of the family of Dworkin, but never speaks, and its figure was adopted as an emblem of the realm of Amber. Dworkin reports that it provided him with the Jewel of Judgement, formerly one of the eyes of the snake apparition of the Logrus, so the Unicorn must have been an inhabitant or denizen of the Courts of Chaos, before Dworkin created the Primal Pattern. It also is reputed to have mated with Dworkin to produce his (only?) child, Oberon, and so is apparently the family's grandmother.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.stwing.upenn.edu/~avm/Amber.shtml] Amber Dictionary Page\n\n{{AmberBooks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Characters In The Chronicles Of Amber}}\n[[Category:The Chronicles of Amber characters| ]]\n", "text_old": "''[[The Chronicles of Amber]]'' is a [[fantasy series]] written by [[Roger Zelazny]] chiefly in ten books published from 1970 to 1991. It features a great variety of characters from a myriad [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]] (including  \"our\" Earth [[universe]]). All universes spiral out on a continuum, which are more closely related to one end, Amber (and its history and functions), or slides on a scale closer and closer to Amber's opposite, the Courts of Chaos, at the other.\n\n==Amberites==\nCharacters from Amber are referred to as Amberites.\n\n===The Amber royal family===\nMuch information about the royal family is compiled only in the authorized companion book ''Roger Zelazny's Visual Guide to Castle Amber''. Some personal colors and offspring are identified only there.\n\nThe founder of the family is '''[[Dworkin Barimen]]''', who first appears as a mad sorcerer. He is the creator of [[The Pattern (The Chronicles of Amber)|the Primal Pattern]] and father of Oberon. The surname Barimen is an anagram of \"in Amber\" and may or may not have been intended as the name of a House of Chaos; it also suspiciously similar to the name \u201cShambarimen\u201d, the maker of a major artifact in [[Philip Jose Farmer]]'s [[World of Tiers]] series and is likely a voluntary tip of the hat to him.\n\nDworkin\u2019s children and grandchildren are:\n\n* {{Anchor|Oberon}}'''Oberon''', liege lord of Amber and only known child of Dworkin (by the Unicorn?). His children are:\n* ''by Cymnea'':\n** {{Anchor|Benedict}}'''Benedict''' (orange, yellow, brown), The master tactician of the family as well as the unmatched master of all martial weapons, and a man who seldom smiles. He chose to remove himself from the struggle for the crown, leaving Eric and Corwin as the eldest surviving heirs. Moreover, Oberon declared his marriage with Cymnea null and void, rendering all his children by her retroactively illegitimate. Benedict has had an affair with Lintra the Hellmaid of Chaos, during a brief interlude in hostilities between them, and is unaware that she bore a child as a result of this. Benedict and Lintra subsequently came to blows again, and Benedict slew Lintra but lost his arm. He still fights better with one arm than anybody else with two.\n*** '''Dara''', great-granddaughter of Benedict after his affair with Lintra. Because of the differing speed of time-flow in different Shadows and between Amber and Chaos, she is first met as a fairly young woman: But within only a couple of weeks of Amber time, she has grown considerably older and embittered in Chaos, to herself be a mother of at least three fully adult children.\n** '''Osric''' (silver & red) and '''Finndo''' (green & gold), long-dead brothers of whom we learn little. It is suggested that they conspired to take the throne from their father, after which they were sent to the front lines of a war from which they did not return.\n* ''by Faiella'':\n** '''Eric''' (black & red), Corwin's elder full-brother (illegitimate because Oberon & Faiella were not married at the time of his birth). An arrogant yet competent would-be king of Amber; he commands the loyalty of Julian, Caine, and G\u00e9rard. Corwin and Eric's rivalry for the throne drives much of the plot of the first two books. After Benedict, Eric was reputedly the greatest swordsman in the Universe of Amber and Shadow. A few centuries before the events of the first novels, he and Corwin decided to settle their rivalry in a duel to the death. In the event, Eric, fearing Oberon's wrath, left Corwin, gravely injured, on Earth in the 17th&nbsp;century. Corwin recovered physically but his memory was gone. Eric maintained that Corwin had left Amber of his own volition, but Oberon would often hint that he suspected Eric of killing Corwin. When Oberon disappeared, he was lured into Shadow in order to find a tool to fix the Pattern after Brand damaged it. Eric soon allied with Caine and Julian to hold the throne.\n** '''[[Corwin of Amber]]''' (silver & black), the narrator of the first five books. He is the first legitimate living child of Oberon who desires the throne. His years on [[Earth]] seem to have softened him somewhat from his earlier arrogant beliefs, particularly with respect to the rest of the family, and to the residents of Shadow, who are regarded by some in the family as creations of their own minds, to be used and abused as they see fit. He also improved his political skills and his swordsmanship to the point where he fights Eric to a draw in ''[[Nine Princes in Amber]]''.\n*** '''[[Merlin of Amber]]''' (purple and grey), son of Corwin and Dara following a brief mid-afternoon fling. The narrator of the second set of five books. He was raised in the Courts of Chaos, and Corwin is unaware of his son's existence until he is informed by Dara late in the series. Adopting Earth, home to Flora and to his father, as his own home, he becomes a software developer in [[San Francisco]]. He finds himself subject to attempts on his life, which turn out to be instigated by his friend Luke, who is really Brand's son Rinaldo. He also has two younger half-brothers, Despil and Jurt, on his mother's side (from her second husband, Lord Gramble Sawall of Chaos), and an older step-halfbrother, Mandor, from Gramble's own prior marriage.\n** '''Deirdre''' (silver & black), Corwin's sister. Corwin's feelings for Deirdre are decidedly [[incest|un-brotherly]], and she appears to return his affection. She is a minor character in the Corwin cycle, but the ''Visual Guide to Amber'' says that she was the best-loved of the royals, due to her beauty and compassion. She dresses in black plate armor and used an axe in battle. Her mother was Faiella, who died while bearing Deirdre.<ref>{{cite book |last=Zelazny |first=Roger |chapter=Nine Princes in Amber |title=The Great Book of Amber |place=New York |publisher=Avon Books |year=1999 |edition=print}}</ref>\n* ''by Clarissa'', known as \"the redheads\":\n** '''Fiona''' (green, lavender, purple), a deft mind and stunning beauty. Sorceress of the family. With Bleys, she was one of the original co-conspirators with Brand to unseat Oberon and take the throne. Corwin initially does not like her, but they become closer during the events of the series. Later she befriends her nephew Merlin and helps him solve his own mysteries.\n** '''Bleys''' (red & orange), a dashing and charming extrovert who partners with Corwin in the effort to retake Amber from Eric. He is also a sorcerer, though of lesser skill than his two full siblings, and favors the sword.\n** '''Brand''' (green), a [[manic depressive]] [[megalomania]]c sorcerer. He makes [[Faustian]] bargains with the forces of Chaos in order to gain power, apparently becoming a \"living Trump\" who can move anywhere in Shadow by willing it. By the time of the final conflict at the Courts of Chaos, he is no longer quite human, even by Amberite standards, and is quite insane.\n*** '''Rinaldo''', also known as '''Luke''', son of Brand and Jasra. He and Merlin both studied at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] and then worked with a computer company Grand Design. Luke does not tell much about himself, but shows he is strong, intelligent and has a salesman's ability to convince people and make them do things he wants. Luke plots revenge against the Royal Family, especially Merlin and Caine, for his father's death. After Caine's death, he is persuaded to give up the vendetta. He appears to prefer his own chosen alias of Luke to his given name of Rinaldo, even to people who know his birth name.\n* ''by Lady Moins of Rebma'':\n** '''Llewella''' (green, lavender, gray), was born of an affair Oberon had with Moins. She is older than Brand and younger than Bleys: Technically illegitimate, she was legally adopted to spite Clarissa after their final divorce. Llewella removed herself from the presence of her family, and lives in ''Rebma'', an underwater city that is a reflection of Amber. Hers is something of a sad existence. She stands with her half-siblings in the final confrontation at the Courts of Chaos.\n* ''by Harla'':\n** None known\n* ''by Rilga'':\n** '''Caine''' (black & green), a calculating, realistic manipulator with naval talents and lifestyle. He and G\u00e9rard command both the Amber Navy and the merchant fleets which ply a thousand different Shadow oceans in their trade. Caine seemed to give Corwin the sea passage to Amber on his first assault, but then ambushed him with help from Eric, who was controlling the weather. After Eric's death and Corwin's assumption of power, Caine faked his own death in order to \"go underground\" in finding the author of the threat to Amber among the Royal Family. He arranged for Corwin to discover his \"body\", actually that of one of his shadows, and later stabbed Corwin after it appeared to him that Corwin, by bringing back Brand, was attempting to revive the plot against Oberon. Caine reappeared in the final battle at the Courts of Chaos, his silver arrows killing Brand. In the second set of novels, he himself is killed by Luke/Rinaldo as revenge for Brand's death. This results in Julian and G\u00e9rard declaring a [[Feud|vendetta]] against Luke.\n** '''Julian''' (white & black), a cold, sinister hunter with a calm manner and biting tongue. He is usually found guarding the Forest of Arden in Amber, with his hell-hounds &ndash; beasts out of Shadow who are quite capable of ripping bodies, and metal, with their teeth. He has incestuous feelings for Fiona. Eventually he admits to Corwin that he recommended that Corwin be blinded in captivity, to render him useless to Brand's [[cabal]] (and thus in a way saving his life). With Eric and Caine, Julian formed the counter-cabal to hold the throne.\n** '''G\u00e9rard''' (blue & gray), a trusted brother, the strongest man in the multiverse and called \"the best of all of us\" by Brand. His loyalty is not, however, backed up with intelligence. He resents being manipulated by his siblings, preferring the face-to-face confrontation and the contest of strength, not of guile. When the family contacts Brand in his shadow prison, G\u00e9rard is the first to grab an axe, teleport into Brand's cell, and free him. Later he loyally guards Brand after he is mysteriously stabbed after returning to Amber.\n* ''by Dybele''\n** '''Florimel''' (green & gray), known as '''Flora''', is regarded as shallow or a [[dumb blonde]] by her siblings, yet she often is on the winning side. Her beauty is legendary in many Shadows and also in Amber itself. She was placed on Earth to keep an eye on Corwin while he was in the hospital. She likes nothing better than to live a pampered existence in her luxurious house in [[Westchester, New York]] and entertain her many lovers. Her solution to not using her powers on Earth is to always have a [[hand grenade]] on her person.\n* ''by Kinta'', introduced in the Merlin Cycle:\n** '''Coral''', a princess from a nearby shadow called Begma, a result of Oberon's secret short liaison with the wife of a Begman diplomat. Although Coral is Merlin's willing lover, she is actually married to Rinaldo as part of a treaty between royal families. Coral is half-sister to Nayda.\n* ''by Paulette''\n** '''Random''' (orange, red, brown), a sneaky rascal, often irritating and called a 'punk' by his older siblings. Random helps Corwin regain his memory, and supports Corwin in his quest for the throne of Amber. After the final battle at the Courts of Chaos, the Unicorn chooses Random himself to succeed Oberon. Random's passions before this were gliding and [[drum kit|drumming]]. It was after a \"hot set\" in his favorite Shadow that Brand contacted him through a card in a hand of [[poker]] he was playing, setting into motion the events that led him to contact Corwin at Flora's house in [[Westchester, New York]].\n*** '''Martin''', son of Random by Moire's daughter Morganthe. After walking the Pattern in Rebma, he wandered in Shadow until he encountered Benedict, who became a mentor. Brand later created a Trump for Martin, using it to summon him to the Primal Pattern, where he stabbed Martin, using the blood he shed to damage the Primal Pattern and allow the forces of Chaos to threaten Amber.\n** '''Mirelle''' (red & yellow)\n* ''by Lora'', introduced in the Merlin Cycle &ndash; or possibly by Harla (see above):\n** '''Delwin''' (brown & black) and '''Sand''' (pale tan & dark brown), twin brother and sister. They only lived a short time in Amber, preferring to live in the Shadow worlds and keep themselves removed from the affairs of their siblings. (In the novel ''Blood of Amber'', Merlin names Harla as the mother of Delwin and Sand and further states that Oberon was married to Harla while still married to Rilga, making this a bigamous marriage and calling the legitimacy of Delwin and Sand into question. It is known that neither has any interest in dynastic struggles.)\n* ''by Deela'', an enemy of Amber, introduced in the Merlin Cycle:\n** '''Dalt''' (black & green), Oberon's illegitimate son, a mercenary who possesses a keen hatred of Amber &ndash; his symbol is a lion rending a unicorn. He was conceived while Deela was Oberon's prisoner. (Or so he claims, probably having been told by his mother that Deela was raped. That may well be true, or it may be that she seduced Oberon as a way of working her way out of imprisonment and lied about it afterwards, when hostilities between Amber and Chaos resumed.) He is known to hang around the kingdom of Kashfa although he is outlawed there, and was Luke's childhood friend. Dalt is very strong, and recovered from being impaled on a sword by Benedict.\n\nThe names of Florimel's and Random's mothers are not given in the novels; the names here are taken from the ''Visual Guide to Amber'' and the ''Complete Amber Sourcebook''. The ''Visual Guide'' adds a younger daughter of Paulette, '''Mirelle''', but she does not appear in any of the novels.\n\nCaine's parentage varies from book to book: Corwin places him above Bleys in the succession &nbsp; and Random also alludes to this &nbsp; but Merlin says he is a full brother of Julian and G\u00e9rard. (Both statements could be true if Caine is, in fact, older than any of Clarissa's children, and the result of an illegitimate affair with Rilga but legally adopted into the line before Clarissa's children, just as Llewella was born illegitimate but legally adopted. Although Oberon did not actually marry Rilga till after finally divorcing Clarissa after the birth of Brand.) The ''Visual Guide to Amber'' and the ''Complete Amber Sourcebook'', though both are authorised works, contradict each other.<ref>For more details on \nCaine's parentage, see section&nbsp;A7 of the [http://leutheuser.com/amber/FAQ.html Amber FAQ].</ref> Corwin also ignores his sisters in the succession.\n\nIt is also mentioned that, although Llewella definitely (and possibly Caine, as mentioned above) was legally adopted into the family after being born illegitimate, this did '''not''' happen to Eric, because Oberon needed to remain on good terms with Cymnea's family, and Eric was perpetually bitter about this.\n\nIn ''[[Nine Princes in Amber]]'' Corwin mentions his fondness for Random as related to being full brothers instead of half-brothers. However, he is still suffering from brain damage at the time. Given that only two books later, it is Corwin himself who mentions that his mother Faiella died giving birth to Deirdre, and Random was only born much later after many more children to other women, this can be put down to either an official authorial change and [[retcon]] (in book&nbsp;3), or to Corwin's still-damaged memory (in book&nbsp;1).\n\nIn the Merlin Cycle, a Pattern-created ghost of Oberon claims that there were a total of 47&nbsp;children, though only 20 are mentioned in the books. Corwin reliably states (while walking the pattern) there were once 15&nbsp;brothers and 8&nbsp;sisters, going on to say 6&nbsp;brothers are dead as are 2&nbsp;sisters (or possibly 4). Having no knowledge of Dalt at the time, this makes a total of 24&nbsp;''known'' children of Oberon, of which only 21 are ever named. One daughter and 3&nbsp;sons are never named in any of the books or accompanying materials.\n\n===Other Amberites===\n*'''Lord Rein''', a [[minstrel]] who was once knighted by Corwin\n*'''Roger''', a guard in Castle Amber, and amateur author. Likely this is Zelazny writing himself into his novel.  Corwin describes Roger as lean, cadaverous, pipe-smoking, and grinning, a description that would fit the author. Roger says that he is writing a \"philosophical romance shot through with elements of horror and morbidity,\" and that he composes the \"horror\" portions while on duty in the dungeon.\n*'''Droppa MaPantz''', the court [[jester]] in the Merlin Cycle. From time to time King Random takes him to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] to gather new material. Merlin and Corwin's friend Bill from Earth recognizes some of his jokes as being taken from [[George Carlin]]'s act.\n*'''Bloody Bill''', '''Bloody Andy''', '''Bloody Eddie''', [[restaurateur]]s in Amber.  They successively run the same establishment with a reputation for good food and random violence.  The restaurant is traditionally known by the name of the previous, deceased, owner, be it Bill, Andy etc.  Proper table manners at \"Bloody Bill's\" (later \"Bloody Andy's\") include making sure your sword is partly unsheathed and visible to all.  The Fish Fry is to-die-for (literally).\n*'''Vinta Bayle''', Caine's mistress and daughter to Baron Bayle, Amber's [[vintner]].  For a time she is possessed by the ''ty'iga'' spirit which Dara has set to watch over Merlin.  The ''ty'iga'' likes to seduce Merlin when in human form.\n*'''Jopin''', keeper of the lighthouse at Cabra. A former sea captain who enjoys the simplicity and solitude of his job.\n\n==The Courts of Chaos==\nPerhaps fittingly, in all but the last novel there isn\u2019t a specific name for characters from the Courts of Chaos.  Both ''Chaosites'' and ''Chaosians'' are popular choices by fans; through the first series, they are referred to only as \u201c''the Courts''\u201d, or as \u201c''the forces of Chaos''\u201d. In the final book, those of the Courts of Chaos are referred to as ''Chaosites'' by Merlin.\n\n<!-- please keep this section alphabetical -->\n*'''Borel''', a duke and master of arms of house Hendrake. Dara's fencing instructor.\n*{{Anchor|Dara}}'''Dara''', great-granddaughter of Benedict, Corwin's lover, mother of [[Merlin of Amber]], and wife of the Chaos nobleman Gramble Sawall\n*'''Gilva''', a warrior-maiden of house Hendrake.\n*'''Gramble Sawall''', Dara's husband, an ally of King Swayvil.\n*'''Jurt''' and '''Despil''', Merlin's half brothers &ndash; sons of Dara (Merlin's mother) and Gramble Sawall. Jurt hates Merlin, while Despil tries to avoid conflicts.\n*'''[[Merlin of Amber]]''', son of Dara and Corwin, great-great-grandson of Benedict, and narrator of the second cycle of books.\n*'''Mandor''', Merlin's stepbrother, a son of Gramble Sawall from a previous marriage. He is a [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli|machiavellian]] manipulator, but Merlin likes him. His name may be derived from the Latin ''[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mandare mandare]'', and is an anagram of \"Random\".\n*'''Suhuy''' (called ''Uncle Suhuy'' by Merlin), keeper of [[the Logrus]] and friendly adversary of [[Dworkin]].\n*'''Swayvil''', King of Chaos during the Merlin Cycle.\n\n==Shadow dwellers==\n\n<!-- please keep this section alphabetical -->\n*'''Ganelon''', an exile from Avalon, killed and impersonated by Oberon. Based on the character of the same name from ''[[The Song of Roland]]''.\n*'''Ghostwheel''', a sentient computer created by [[Merlin of Amber]], capable of generating Trump connections at a rate of thousands per second, apparently regarded by the Pattern and Logrus as a minor upstart in the ranks of cosmic powers.\n*'''Hugi''', a fatalist talking [[raven]]. Based on Hugin, one of the two ravens who perched on [[Odin]]'s shoulders in [[Norse mythology]].\n*'''Jasra''', a powerful sorceress, mother of Luke, tutor of Julia, former handmaid to Dara and deposed ruler of the Keep of Four Worlds.  She has venomous lips and a thirst for power.\n*'''Julia Barnes''', Merlin's ex-girlfriend, whom he finds murdered in her San Francisco apartment by a doglike monster from another world. This is later revealed to be a deception; Julia is alive under the alias of '''Mask''' and has become a sorceress, taking over the Keep of Four Worlds from Jasra. Merlin had taken her with him on a shadow walk, which led to their breakup and to her pursuing an interest in occult magic.\n* '''Lancelot''', one of Ganelon's knights who was rescued by Corwin. Based on [[Sir Lancelot]] from [[Arthurian legend]].\n*'''Lorraine''', a [[prostitute|camp follower]] with [[second sight]] in a shadow of the same name.\n*'''Victor Melman''', occultist from Earth, associate and possible teacher of Julia Barnes, student of Jasra.  Killed by Merlin using primal chaos.\n*'''Moire''', queen of Rebma, maternal grandmother of Random's son Martin through her daughter Morganthe, who committed suicide after being abandoned by Random.\n*'''Rhanda''', a vampire-like being called a ''shroudling''. She and Merlin were childhood playmates.\n*'''Bill Roth''', a lawyer from Earth, who aids Corwin and ends up being something of a confidant for Merlin, as well as legal counsel to the court of Amber.  In ''[[Sign of the Unicorn]]'', Bill, frustrated by Corwin's evasiveness, complains, \"I've a peculiar feeling that I may never see you again. It is as if I were one of those minor characters in a melodrama who gets shuffled offstage without ever learning how things turn out.\"\n*'''Sharu Garrul''', Jasra's former tutor and a previous ruler of the Keep of the Four Worlds.\n* '''The Sphinx''', a monster that devours those who cannot answer its riddles. Based on the [[Sphinx#Greek traditions|riddling Sphinx of Thebes]] in the Greek myth of [[Oedipus]].\n*The '''Ty'iga''', a bodyless demon who inhabits the bodies of others.  She is female, or at least feminine, though she is able to possess male bodies as well.  When she leaves one's body the possessed person feels like waking up from a sleep and has no memory of the intervening time.  She appears as '''Dan Martinez''', '''George Hansen''', '''Meg Devlin''', '''Vinta Bayle''' and it is revealed that she was also '''Gail Lampron''', a former girlfriend of Luke.  She is finally bound in the body of '''Nayda''', Coral's sister, since Nayda actually died from an illness just as she was possessed. She was originally set to watch and protect Merlin by his mother Dara, unless she caught sight of the Jewel.\n*'''Vialle''', a blind noblewoman from Rebma whom Random is forced to marry.  This was intended as a punishment for Random's affair with Moire's late daughter.  Random would be bound to stay in Rebma for a year, and Vialle would gain status as a noble of Amber.  To everyone's surprise, the marriage worked out well.  She is artistic, creating sculptures by touch, specializing in busts of the Amberites.  Vialle gives Luke/Rinaldo her protection in the form of her ring, ensuring that the [[Feud|vendetta]] against him by Caine's supporters will not be allowed to proceed.\n*'''Ygg''', a talking tree planted by Oberon to mark the border between Order and Chaos. Based on [[Yggdrasil]], the tree that holds up the sky in northern Germanic and Icelandic myths.\n\n==The Powers==\nThe two main beings who control and create the Amber [[multiverse]] are The Pattern and The Logrus, who are immensely competitive and often cause collateral damage and casualties in the course of their struggles against each other.\n* '''[[The Pattern (The Chronicles of Amber)|The Pattern]]''', sentient embodiment of Order. It is capable of manifesting as a [[unicorn]], which according to Dworkin is the mother of Oberon, and of creating pattern-ghosts of any who have walked its path. In the Merlin cycle, the Pattern's spirit is implied to be older than the Primal Pattern, since it refers to events in its competition with the Logrus that predate Dworkin's creation of that Pattern. It appears to wish to impose unending, unmoving, static pure order over the universe.\n* '''[[The Logrus]]''', embodiment of Chaos, also sentient and capable of manifesting as a giant serpent, and of creating semi-solid projections similar to pattern-ghosts. It claims that the Jewel of Judgement was its eye, stolen by the Unicorn; it appears to desire to return all existence to the primal chaos from which it came.\n* '''Corwin's Pattern''', created by Corwin in ''[[The Courts of Chaos]]'', it is also sentient and attempts to remain neutral in the conflict between the higher powers. It is also able to produce pattern-ghosts, and allies itself with Merlin, who along with Corwin is the only other being to walk its path.\n* '''The Ghostwheel''', a computer-based, pattern-manipulating artificial intelligence created by Merlin in a secret location in the shadows, near Chaos. Like the trump cards, it is able to transport objects between shadow worlds, and to view goings-on in remote locations. It is not a cosmic-power like the patterns, but is able to act in defiance of them. The Ghostwheel is loyal to Merlin, and refers to him as \"dad\".\n* '''The Unicorn''', a mysterious individual who only appears rarely, in the shape of a [[unicorn]], at crucial points in some of the Amber stories. It always arrives to act as a protector of the family of Dworkin, but never speaks, and its figure was adopted as an emblem of the realm of Amber. Dworkin reports that it provided him with the Jewel of Judgement, formerly one of the eyes of the snake apparition of the Logrus, so the Unicorn must have been an inhabitant or denizen of the Courts of Chaos, before Dworkin created the Primal Pattern. It also is reputed to have mated with Dworkin to produce his (only?) child, Oberon, and so is apparently the family's grandmother.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.stwing.upenn.edu/~avm/Amber.shtml] Amber Dictionary Page\n\n{{AmberBooks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Characters In The Chronicles Of Amber}}\n[[Category:The Chronicles of Amber characters| ]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toDworkin(link changed toDworkin Barimen) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Chronicles_of_Amber_characters"}

The show later moved to Animal Planet with its third season released as early as February 18, 1998.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Stinky the [[Skunk]]''' (performed by [[Dave Goelz]]) - The host of the show. He always asks the ridiculous questions.\n* '''Jake the [[Polar bear|Polar Bear]]''' (performed by [[Steve Whitmire]]) - The co-host of the show. He always asks the clever questions. With Jake being a Live-Hand Muppet, Steve Whitmire is assisted in performing him by [[Bill Barretta]] who operates Jake's right hand.\n* '''Armstrong the [[Chickenhawk (bird)|Chickenhawk]]''' (performed by [[Bill Barretta]]) - Armstrong is the show's expert on birds. He was paired up with Ollie the Tapir in Season One and paired up with Bunnie the Bear in Season Two and Three. Armstrong is usually the straight man/victim in these team-ups. Armstrong's puppet was previously seen in the \"[[Loretta Swit]]\" episode of ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' and in Episode 3060 of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' during the \"Let's Lay an Egg\" song (a spoof of [[Cole Porter]]'s \"[[Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love]]\").\n* '''Ollie the [[Tapir]]''' (performed by [[Karen Prell]]) - An enthusiastic, nasal-voiced tapir who was paired up with Armstrong in Season One. She would also be the one who would bring in any animal guest that required assistance (mostly the insect ones). Ollie the Tapir was dropped at the end of Season One.\n* '''Bunnie the [[Bear]]''' (performed by [[Louise Gold]]) - Jake the Polar Bear's cousin. She joins the show in Season Two after Ollie the Tapir was dropped during the production of this show. Like Ollie the Tapir, Bunnie the Bear would bring in any animal guest that required assistance (mostly the insect ones).\n* '''Yves St. LaRoache''' (performed by [[Mak Wilson]] in Season One, [[John Eccleston]] in Season Two and Three) - The show's [[cockroach]] chef. He is a recycled version of Jacques Roach from ''[[The Jim Henson Hour]]''.\n* '''Tizzy the [[Bee]]''' (performed by [[Karen Prell]] in Season One, [[Louise Gold]] in Season Two) - A bee would pop in to ask Stinky and Jake some animal-related questions. Tizzy was later dropped from the show before Season Three. She is a computer-animated Muppet similar to [[Waldo C. Graphic]].\n* '''Rhonda [[Rat]]''' (performed by [[Louise Gold]]) - A rodent [[Journalist|reporter]] who joined the show in Season Three. She often asks any animals backstage animal-related questions. When Rhonda gets annoyed by the animal, she has the animal sent down the trap door.\n* '''Dullard the [[Aardvark]]''' (performed by [[Bill Barretta]]) - An aardvark who serves as Rhonda Rat's [[camera operator]]. His puppet was previously used for Arlene the Aardvark with the puppet having been designed and built by [[Jean-Guy White]].\n\n==Episode format==\nA typical episode format involves:\n* An opening with Stinky the Skunk and Jake the Polar Bear\n* Ollie (in Season 1), Bunnie (in Seasons 2 and 3), and Armstrong host \"That's Amazing\" where they take a look at fascinating things that animals can do.\n* Stinky and Jake interview an animal guest.\n* \"Baby Talk\" which is a segment with live footage of baby animals with the puppeteers dubbing these animals' voices.\n* A song plays over live animal footage. In Seasons 1 and 2, songs from previous Jim Henson productions were reused\n* In Seasons 1 and 2, Tizzy pops in to ask Stinky and Jake an animal-related question. In Season 3, Rhonda Rat: Rodent Reporter asks any animal backstage an animal-related question. When Rhonda gets annoyed by the animal, she has the animal sent down the trapdoor.\n* Yves St. La Roache's segments show Yves St. La Roache either preparing an animal-themed meal or how animals eat.\n* Stinky and Jake interview another animal guest in which he or she will sing a song after the interview.\n* Ollie (in Season 1), Bunnie (in Seasons 2 and 3), and Armstrong host \"Animal Award\" which shows which animal is best at above the rest.\n* \"Jake's Tale\" where Jake tells a story to Stinky (plus Bunnie and Armstrong in Seasons 2 and 3) with live animal footage while Jake is narrating the story.\n* Ollie (in Season 1), Bunnie (in Seasons 2 and 3) and Armstrong host \"Habitat Time\" where they go to where animals live.\n* In Seasons 1 and 2, Tizzy pops in again to ask Stinky and Jake another animal-related question. In Season 3, Rhonda Rat asks any animal backstage another animal-related question.

From an extant letter written by Thomas Purcell we learn that this anthem was composed for the exceptionally fine voice of the Rev. [[John Gostling]], then at [[Canterbury]], but afterwards a gentleman of His Majesty's Chapel. Purcell wrote several anthems at different times for Gostling's extraordinary [[basso profondo]] voice, which is known to have had a [[Vocal range|range]] of at least two full [[octave]]s, from D below the [[Clef|bass staff]] to the D above it. The dates of very few of these sacred compositions are known; perhaps the most notable example is the anthem ''They that go down to the sea in ships.'' In gratitude for the providential escape of King Charles II from shipwreck, Gostling, who had been of the royal party, put together some verses from the [[Psalms]] in the form of an anthem and requested Purcell to set them to music.

Although it incorporated [[Music of Italy|Italian]] and [[Music of France|French]] stylistic elements, Purcell's was a uniquely English form of [[Baroque music]].

''Henry Purcell 1659\u20131695 His Life and Times''. (New York City: St. Martin's Press Inc., 1967), 29.</ref> (The dates for his compositions are often uncertain, despite considerable research.) It is assumed that the three-part song ''Sweet tyranness, I now resign'' was written by him as a child.<ref name=\"Westrup, J. A. Purcell 1975\" /> After Humfrey's death, Purcell continued his studies under Dr [[John Blow]]. He attended [[Westminster School]] and in 1676 was appointed copyist at [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref name=EB1911/> Henry Purcell's earliest [[anthem]] ''Lord, who can tell'' was composed in 1678. It is a [[Psalms|psalm]] that is prescribed for Christmas Day and also to be read at morning prayer on the fourth day of the month.<ref>Zimmerman, Franklin. ''Henry Purcell 1659\u20131695 His Life and Times''. (New York City: St. Martin's Press Inc., 1967), 65.</ref>\n\nIn 1679, he wrote songs for [[John Playford]]'s ''Choice Ayres, Songs and Dialogues'' and an anthem, the name of which is unknown, for the Chapel Royal. From an extant letter written by Thomas Purcell we learn that this anthem was composed for the exceptionally fine voice of the Rev. [[John Gostling]], then at [[Canterbury]], but afterwards a gentleman of His Majesty's Chapel. Purcell wrote several anthems at different times for Gostling's extraordinary [[basso profondo]] voice, which is known to have had a [[Vocal range|range]] of at least two full [[octave]]s, from D below the [[Clef|bass staff]] to the D above it. The dates of very few of these sacred compositions are known; perhaps the most notable example is the anthem ''They that go down to the sea in ships.'' In gratitude for the providential escape of King Charles II from shipwreck, Gostling, who had been of the royal party, put together some verses from the [[Psalms]] in the form of an anthem and requested Purcell to set them to music. The challenging work opens with a passage which traverses the full extent of Gostling's range, beginning on the upper D and descending two octaves to the lower.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 1679, Blow, who had been appointed organist of [[Westminster Abbey]] 10 years before, resigned his office in favour of Purcell.<ref name=Runciman>Runciman, John F. (1909). ''Purcell''. London: [[George Bell & Sons]]. {{OCLC|5690003}}.</ref> Purcell now devoted himself almost entirely to the composition of sacred music, and for six years severed his connection with the theatre. However, during the early part of the year, probably before taking up his new office, he had produced two important works for the stage, the music for [[Nathaniel Lee]]'s ''Theodosius'', and [[Thomas d'Urfey]]'s ''Virtuous Wife''.<ref name=Runciman /> Between 1680 and 1688 Purcell wrote music for seven plays.<ref name=\"Harris, Ellen T 1987\">Harris, Ellen T. ''Henry Purcell's Dido and Aeneas''. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1987), 6.</ref> The composition of his chamber opera ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'', which forms a very important landmark in the history of English dramatic music, has been attributed to this period, and its earliest production may well have predated the documented one of 1689.<ref name=Runciman /> It was written to a [[libretto]] furnished by [[Nahum Tate]], and performed in 1689 in cooperation with [[Josias Priest]], a dancing master and the choreographer for the [[Dorset Garden Theatre]]. Priest's wife kept a boarding school for young gentlewomen, first in [[Leicester Fields]] and afterwards at [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], where the opera was performed.<ref name=AH54>[[Arthur Hutchings|Hutchings, Arthur]]. Purcell.

Each work runs to less than one hour. At the time, ''Dido and Aeneas'' never found its way to the theatre, though it appears to have been very popular in private circles. It is believed to have been extensively copied, but only one song was printed by Purcell's widow in ''[[Orpheus Britannicus]]'', and the complete work remained in manuscript until 1840, when it was printed by the [[Musical Antiquarian Society]] under the editorship of Sir [[George Alexander Macfarren|George Macfarren]].<ref name=EB1911/> The composition of ''Dido and Aeneas'' gave Purcell his first chance to write a sustained musical setting of a dramatic text. It was his only opportunity to compose a work in which the music carried the entire drama.<ref name=\"Harris, Ellen T 1987\" /> The story of ''Dido and Aeneas'' derives from the original source in Virgil's epic the ''[[Aeneid]]''.<ref>Harris, Ellen T.

In this year, Purcell also composed a march and passepied called ''Quick-step'', which became so popular that [[Thomas Wharton, 1st Marquess of Wharton|Lord Wharton]] adapted the latter to the fatal verses of ''[[Lillibullero]]''; and in or before January 1688, Purcell composed his anthem ''Blessed are they that fear the Lord'' by express command of the King. A few months later, he wrote the music for D'Urfey's play, ''The Fool's Preferment''. In 1690, he composed the music for [[Thomas Betterton|Betterton]]'s adaptation of [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher]] and [[Philip Massinger|Massinger]]'s ''Prophetess'' (afterwards called ''[[Dioclesian]]'')<ref>Muller 1990{{Page needed|date=December 2009}}</ref> and Dryden's ''[[Amphitryon (Dryden)|Amphitryon]]''.

Morelos and [[Ignacio L\u00f3pez Ray\u00f3n]] are credited with organizing the war of independence. Under Morelos the [[Congress of An\u00e1huac]] was installed on September 13, 1813, and in November 6 of the same year congress [[Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America|declared]] the country's independence. On October 22, 1814, a constitution, [[Constitution of Apatzing\u00e1n|''Decreto Constitucional para la Libertad de la Am\u00e9rica Mexicana'']], was drafted by the Congress which declared that Mexico would be a Republic.\n\nAfter a series of defeats he was captured by the Spanish royalist military, tried by the Inquisition, defrocked as a cleric, and executed by civil authorities for [[treason]] in 1815. Morelos is a national hero in Mexico and is considered a very successful military leader despite the fact that he never took a military career and was instead a priest.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Morelia casa natal de Morelos.JPG|left|thumb|Birthplace and house of Morelos in Morelia, today a museum.]]\nMorelos was born in Valladolid, since renamed \"[[Morelia]]\" in his honor, to a humble family of mixed Spanish and [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous]] descent.<ref name=\"morelos bicentenario\">{{cite web|title=Sitio del Bicentenario de independencia de Mexico, biografia de Morelos. |url=http://www.bicentenario.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=72 |quote=Fue registrado como espa\u00f1ol, pero en realidad era mestizo, con algo de ascendencia negra. |accessdate=June 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905195800/http://www.bicentenario.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=72 |archivedate=September 5, 2010}}</ref>  Morelos was classified as an ''espa\u00f1ol'' in the baptismal register.<ref name=\"Guedea p. 948\">Guedea, \"Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos\", p. 948</ref>\n\nHis father was Jos\u00e9 Manuel Morelos y Robles, a carpenter originally from Zindurio, a predominantly indigenous village a few kilometers west of Valladolid.

About 6:00&nbsp;a.m. on September 16, 1810, Hidalgo then the parish priest of Dolores, Guanajuato (since renamed ''[[Dolores Hidalgo]]'' in his honor), hastily ordered the church bells to be rung, and gathered his congregation. Flanked by [[Ignacio Allende]] and [[Juan Aldama]], Hidalgo addressed the people in front of his church, urging them to take up arms, with the Cry of Independence (''El Grito de Dolores'', now celebrated every year on September 15 at 11:00&nbsp;p.m.) that called for armed revolt after the Spanish colonial authorities had discovered the [[Conspiracy of Quer\u00e9taro]], a clandestine movement seeking Mexican independence. Like Allende and Aldama, [[Josefa Ortiz de Dom\u00ednguez]], popularly known as ''La Corregidora'', was one of the famous initial supporters of the revolt. Miguel Hidalgo and his followers rose in open rebellion against the Spanish colonial authorities launching what became the [[Mexican War of Independence]].\n\nWith the imperial government taken by surprise, [[operatives]] took important cities of the [[Baj\u00edo]] region without an organized response. The insurgency proclaimed Hidalgo [[Captain General|captain general]] of Mexico in [[Celaya]] on September 21. Hidalgo y Costilla advanced as far as [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]]; and on September 28, the rebels captured the [[Alh\u00f3ndiga de Granaditas]] in battle, killing at least 500 Spaniards who had taken shelter there. Among the dead was the crown's highest official in Guanajuato, Intendant [[Juan Antonio Ria\u00f1o]], an old friend of Hidalgo y Costilla.\n\n[[File:San_Diego_Fort_in_Acapulco,_Mexico.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Fort of San Diego Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico.

Hidalgo y Costilla and his army marched on to Valladolid, where the locals feared that the slaughter of Guanajuato would be repeated, prompting many people to abandon the region, particularly elites. Valladolid was taken peacefully on October 17, 1810.\n\nIn Tac\u00e1mbaro Hidalgo y Costilla was proclaimed general, and Allende captain general. Hidalgo ordered a rest for his troops in [[Indaparapeo, Michoac\u00e1n|Indaparapeo]], where a few minutes before their departure, Morelos, who had read about his excommunication and his triumphs, found him.\n\nMorelos had heard of the revolt in October 1810 and determined to join it.<ref>Guedea, \"Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, 948.</ref> Hidalgo asked his former student to recruit troops in the south of the colony and capture the port of [[Acapulco]], the west coast port for the Pacific trade to the Philippines, also a Spanish colony.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Guedea, \"Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos\", p. 948.</ref> Unlike Hidalgo, who was a poor tactician leading a huge and undisciplined following, Morelos quickly demonstrated military skills, gathering and training a small core of fighters. He sought allies in the region, and obtained cannon and other war materiel.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMorelos's hopes for the rebellion called for the creation of a republican government that \u201call Mexican people would participate, the abolition of slavery, and the elimination of divisions between races and ethnicities.\u201d<ref>Meade, Teresa A. 2010. A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to the present. Chichester, West Sussex, U.K.: Wiley-Blackwell, p. 72. \n</ref> Morelos saw the suffering of the poor at the ends of the Church and the elites, and believed that these things must be changed in order to achieve the full participation of the people in the new government. Morelos also called for the end of the Church's special privileges and the redistribution of large estates among the people. These principles demonstrated the rebellion's desire to achieve both independence and justice for the poor.\n\n===Campaigns===\n[[File:Jos\u00e9_Mar\u00eda_Morelos,_siglo_XIX.png|thumb|right|200px|Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos (1765-1815)]]\n\n[[File:C243aMexico, Oaxaca, 8 Reales 1814, Obverse.jpg|thumb|left|Insurgent coinage: Mexico, Oaxaca, 8 Reales 1814, obverse.]]\nMorelos soon showed himself to be a talented strategist, and became one of the greatest revolutionary military commanders of the war. In his first nine months, he won 22 victories, annihilating the armies of three Spanish royalist leaders and dominating almost all of what is now the state of [[Guerrero]]. In December, he captured Acapulco for the first time, except for the [[Fort of San Diego]]. Spanish reinforcements forced him to raise the siege in January. By quick marches, he was able to capture most of the Spanish possessions on the Pacific coast of what are now Michoac\u00e1n and Guerrero. On May 24, 1811, he occupied [[Chilpancingo]] and on May 26 he took [[Tixtla]].\n\nIn his second campaign, Morelos divided his army into three groups. The most important engagement of this campaign was at [[Cuautla, Morelos|Cuautla]]. On Christmas Eve 1811 the townspeople welcomed Morelos to the town. The next year his forces were [[Siege of Cuautla|besieged by the Spanish army]] under general [[F\u00e9lix Mar\u00eda Calleja del Rey, 1st Count of Calder\u00f3n|F\u00e9lix Mar\u00eda Calleja del Rey]]. On May 2, 1812, after 58 days, Morelos broke through the siege, and started his third campaign.\n\nMajor victories on this third campaign were at [[Citlalli]] on June 8, 1812, [[Tehuac\u00e1n, Puebla|Tehuac\u00e1n]] on August 10, 1812, [[Orizaba]], [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]] and Acapulco. Morelos arrived at Orizaba with 10,000 soldiers on October 28, 1812. The city was defended by 600 Spanish soldiers. Negotiation led to a surrender without bloodshed. He entered Oaxaca in triumph on November 25, 1812. Acapulco fell on April 12, 1813, forcing the Spanish army to take refuge in Fort of San Diego\n\n===Congress of Chilpancingo===\n{{Main|Congress of Chilpancingo}}\n[[File:Campa\u00f1a de Morelos.png|thumb|250px|A map of the military campaigns of Morelos.]]\n[[File:Congreso de Chilpancingo.png|left|thumb|200px|Congress of Anahuac the day of the writing of Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America]]\nIn 1813, Morelos called the [[Congress of Chilpancingo|National Constituent Congress of Chilpancingo]], composed of representatives of the provinces under his control, to consider a political and social program which he outlined in a document entitled \"[[Sentimientos de la Naci\u00f3n]]\" (Sentiments of the Nation). The Congress called itself the Congress of An\u00e1huac, referring poetically to the ancient [[Aztecs]].\n\nOn September 31, 1813, the Congress, with Morelos present, endorsed the \"Sentiments of the Nation\". This document declared Mexican independence from Spain, established the Roman Catholic religion and created the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government. It declared respect for property and confiscated the productions of the Spanish colonial government. It abolished slavery and racial social distinctions in favor of the title \"American\" for all native-born individuals. Torture, monopolies and the system of tributes were also abolished. Morelos was offered the title \"Generalissimo\" with the style of address \"Your Highness\", but he refused these and asked to be called \"Siervo de la Naci\u00f3n\" (Servant of the Nation). On November 6, 1813, the Congress declared independence.\n\nAfter several military defeats, the Congress organized a meeting in [[Apatzing\u00e1n]], and on October 22 promulgated the \"Decreto Constitucional para la Libertad de la Am\u00e9rica Mexicana\" ([[Constitution of Apatzing\u00e1n]]). This established a weak executive and a powerful legislature, the opposite of what Morelos had called for. He nevertheless conceded that it was the best he could hope for under the circumstances.\n\n===Capture and execution===\n[[File:Degradaci\u00f3n Morelos.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Contemporary engraving depicting the defrocking and degradation of Morelos by church officials before released to civil authorities for execution]]\n[[File:Fusilamiento_Morelos.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Flag Of Morelos.]]\nShortly thereafter, Morelos began his fourth military campaign, a series of disasters beginning at Valladolid in late 1813. While escorting the new insurgent Congress in November 1815, he was defeated in Tezmalaca by royalist forces. Morelos and his guard were surrounded; rather than have all taken prisoner, Morelos told his men to each save himself. This left Morelos to be captured alone.<ref>Christon I.

Inquisition officials drew up a 23 charges against Morelos, and following proper procedure, Morelos had a defense attorney, one Lic.

Morelos was executed by firing squad on December 22, 1815, in San Crist\u00f3bal Ecatepec, north of Mexico City in order that his execution not provoke a dangerous public reaction. He was later judged to be reconciled to the church, lifting his excommunication, as he was seen praying on his way to his execution.<ref>Gustavo Watson Marron, director of the historical archive of the archdiocese, cited in ''El Universal'', August 31, 2009.</ref> After his death, his lieutenant, [[Vicente Guerrero]], continued the war for independence.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Retrato del excelent\u00edsimo se\u00f1or don Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos.png|thumb|right|200px|Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos, 1812, now in [[Chapultepec Castle]] in the Museo Nacional de Historia.]]\n[[File:CoinsMexico.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Jose on a peso.]]\nMorelos is considered a national [[hero]] of Mexico; the state of [[Morelos]] and city of [[Morelia]] are named after him.

Morelos and [[Ignacio L\u00f3pez Ray\u00f3n]] are credited with organizing the war of independence. Under Morelos the [[Congress of An\u00e1huac]] was installed on September 13, 1813, and in November 6 of the same year congress [[Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America|declared]] the country's independence. On October 22, 1814, a constitution, [[Constitution of Apatzing\u00e1n|''Decreto Constitucional para la Libertad de la Am\u00e9rica Mexicana'']], was drafted by the Congress which declared that Mexico would be a Republic.\n\nAfter a series of defeats he was captured by the Spanish royalist military, tried by the Inquisition, defrocked as a cleric, and executed by civil authorities for [[treason]] in 1815. Morelos is a national hero in Mexico and is considered a very successful military leader despite the fact that he never took a military career and was instead a priest.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Morelia casa natal de Morelos.JPG|left|thumb|Birthplace and house of Morelos in Morelia, today a museum.]]\nMorelos was born in Valladolid, since renamed \"[[Morelia]]\" in his honor, to a humble family of mixed Spanish and [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous]] descent.<ref name=\"morelos bicentenario\">{{cite web|title=Sitio del Bicentenario de independencia de Mexico, biografia de Morelos. |url=http://www.bicentenario.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=72 |quote=Fue registrado como espa\u00f1ol, pero en realidad era mestizo, con algo de ascendencia negra. |accessdate=June 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905195800/http://www.bicentenario.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=72 |archivedate=September 5, 2010}}</ref>  Morelos was classified as an ''espa\u00f1ol'' in the baptismal register.<ref name=\"Guedea p. 948\">Guedea, \"Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos\", p. 948</ref>\n\nHis father was Jos\u00e9 Manuel Morelos y Robles, a carpenter originally from Zindurio, a predominantly indigenous village a few kilometers west of Valladolid.

About 6:00&nbsp;a.m. on September 16, 1810, Hidalgo then the parish priest of Dolores, Guanajuato (since renamed ''[[Dolores Hidalgo]]'' in his honor), hastily ordered the church bells to be rung, and gathered his congregation. Flanked by [[Ignacio Allende]] and [[Juan Aldama]], Hidalgo addressed the people in front of his church, urging them to take up arms, with the Cry of Independence (''El Grito de Dolores'', now celebrated every year on September 15 at 11:00&nbsp;p.m.) that called for armed revolt after the Spanish colonial authorities had discovered the [[Conspiracy of Quer\u00e9taro]], a clandestine movement seeking Mexican independence. Like Allende and Aldama, [[Josefa Ortiz de Dom\u00ednguez]], popularly known as ''La Corregidora'', was one of the famous initial supporters of the revolt. Miguel Hidalgo and his followers rose in open rebellion against the Spanish colonial authorities launching what became the [[Mexican War of Independence]].\n\nWith the imperial government taken by surprise, [[operatives]] took important cities of the [[Baj\u00edo]] region without an organized response. The insurgency proclaimed Hidalgo [[Captain General|captain general]] of Mexico in [[Celaya]] on September 21. Hidalgo y Costilla advanced as far as [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]]; and on September 28, the rebels captured the [[Alh\u00f3ndiga de Granaditas]] in battle, killing at least 500 Spaniards who had taken shelter there. Among the dead was the crown's highest official in Guanajuato, Intendant [[Juan Antonio Ria\u00f1o]], an old friend of Hidalgo y Costilla.\n\n[[File:San_Diego_Fort_in_Acapulco,_Mexico.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Fort of San Diego Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico. It was originally built between 1615 and 1617, but an earthquake knocked down in 1776 and it's until 1783 the current one is rebuilt.]]\n\nThe [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Morelia|bishop of Michoac\u00e1n]], [[Manuel Abad y Queipo]], excommunicated the insurgents.  Hidalgo y Costilla and his army marched on to Valladolid, where the locals feared that the slaughter of Guanajuato would be repeated, prompting many people to abandon the region, particularly elites. Valladolid was taken peacefully on October 17, 1810.\n\nIn Tac\u00e1mbaro Hidalgo y Costilla was proclaimed general, and Allende captain general. Hidalgo ordered a rest for his troops in [[Indaparapeo, Michoac\u00e1n|Indaparapeo]], where a few minutes before their departure, Morelos, who had read about his excommunication and his triumphs, found him.\n\nMorelos had heard of the revolt in October 1810 and determined to join it.<ref>Guedea, \"Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, 948.</ref> Hidalgo asked his former student to recruit troops in the south of the colony and capture the port of [[Acapulco]], the west coast port for the Pacific trade to the Philippines, also a Spanish colony.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Guedea, \"Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos\", p. 948.</ref> Unlike Hidalgo, who was a poor tactician leading a huge and undisciplined following, Morelos quickly demonstrated military skills, gathering and training a small core of fighters. He sought allies in the region, and obtained cannon and other war materiel.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMorelos's hopes for the rebellion called for the creation of a republican government that \u201call Mexican people would participate, the abolition of slavery, and the elimination of divisions between races and ethnicities.\u201d<ref>Meade, Teresa A. 2010. A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to the present. Chichester, West Sussex, U.K.: Wiley-Blackwell, p. 72. \n</ref> Morelos saw the suffering of the poor at the ends of the Church and the elites, and believed that these things must be changed in order to achieve the full participation of the people in the new government. Morelos also called for the end of the Church's special privileges and the redistribution of large estates among the people. These principles demonstrated the rebellion's desire to achieve both independence and justice for the poor.\n\n===Campaigns===\n[[File:Jos\u00e9_Mar\u00eda_Morelos,_siglo_XIX.png|thumb|right|200px|Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos (1765-1815)]]\n\n[[File:C243aMexico, Oaxaca, 8 Reales 1814, Obverse.jpg|thumb|left|Insurgent coinage: Mexico, Oaxaca, 8 Reales 1814, obverse.]]\nMorelos soon showed himself to be a talented strategist, and became one of the greatest revolutionary military commanders of the war. In his first nine months, he won 22 victories, annihilating the armies of three Spanish royalist leaders and dominating almost all of what is now the state of [[Guerrero]]. In December, he captured Acapulco for the first time, except for the [[Fort of San Diego]]. Spanish reinforcements forced him to raise the siege in January. By quick marches, he was able to capture most of the Spanish possessions on the Pacific coast of what are now Michoac\u00e1n and Guerrero. On May 24, 1811, he occupied [[Chilpancingo]] and on May 26 he took [[Tixtla]].\n\nIn his second campaign, Morelos divided his army into three groups. The most important engagement of this campaign was at [[Cuautla, Morelos|Cuautla]]. On Christmas Eve 1811 the townspeople welcomed Morelos to the town. The next year his forces were [[Siege of Cuautla|besieged by the Spanish army]] under general [[F\u00e9lix Mar\u00eda Calleja del Rey, 1st Count of Calder\u00f3n|F\u00e9lix Mar\u00eda Calleja del Rey]]. On May 2, 1812, after 58 days, Morelos broke through the siege, and started his third campaign.\n\nMajor victories on this third campaign were at [[Citlalli]] on June 8, 1812, [[Tehuac\u00e1n, Puebla|Tehuac\u00e1n]] on August 10, 1812, [[Orizaba]], [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]] and Acapulco. Morelos arrived at Orizaba with 10,000 soldiers on October 28, 1812. The city was defended by 600 Spanish soldiers. Negotiation led to a surrender without bloodshed. He entered Oaxaca in triumph on November 25, 1812. Acapulco fell on April 12, 1813, forcing the Spanish army to take refuge in Fort of San Diego\n\n===Congress of Chilpancingo===\n{{Main|Congress of Chilpancingo}}\n[[File:Campa\u00f1a de Morelos.png|thumb|250px|A map of the military campaigns of Morelos.]]\n[[File:Congreso de Chilpancingo.png|left|thumb|200px|Congress of Anahuac the day of the writing of Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America]]\nIn 1813, Morelos called the [[Congress of Chilpancingo|National Constituent Congress of Chilpancingo]], composed of representatives of the provinces under his control, to consider a political and social program which he outlined in a document entitled \"[[Sentimientos de la Naci\u00f3n]]\" (Sentiments of the Nation). The Congress called itself the Congress of An\u00e1huac, referring poetically to the ancient [[Aztecs]].\n\nOn September 31, 1813, the Congress, with Morelos present, endorsed the \"Sentiments of the Nation\". This document declared Mexican independence from Spain, established the Roman Catholic religion and created the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government. It declared respect for property and confiscated the productions of the Spanish colonial government. It abolished slavery and racial social distinctions in favor of the title \"American\" for all native-born individuals. Torture, monopolies and the system of tributes were also abolished. Morelos was offered the title \"Generalissimo\" with the style of address \"Your Highness\", but he refused these and asked to be called \"Siervo de la Naci\u00f3n\" (Servant of the Nation). On November 6, 1813, the Congress declared independence.\n\nAfter several military defeats, the Congress organized a meeting in [[Apatzing\u00e1n]], and on October 22 promulgated the \"Decreto Constitucional para la Libertad de la Am\u00e9rica Mexicana\" ([[Constitution of Apatzing\u00e1n]]). This established a weak executive and a powerful legislature, the opposite of what Morelos had called for. He nevertheless conceded that it was the best he could hope for under the circumstances.\n\n===Capture and execution===\n[[File:Degradaci\u00f3n Morelos.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Contemporary engraving depicting the defrocking and degradation of Morelos by church officials before released to civil authorities for execution]]\n[[File:Fusilamiento_Morelos.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Flag Of Morelos.]]\nShortly thereafter, Morelos began his fourth military campaign, a series of disasters beginning at Valladolid in late 1813. While escorting the new insurgent Congress in November 1815, he was defeated in Tezmalaca by royalist forces. Morelos and his guard were surrounded; rather than have all taken prisoner, Morelos told his men to each save himself. This left Morelos to be captured alone.<ref>Christon I.

Inquisition officials drew up a 23 charges against Morelos, and following proper procedure, Morelos had a defense attorney, one Lic. Jos\u00e9 Quiles.<ref>Archer, \"Death's Patriots\", p. 78.</ref> He was charged with treason, disloyalty to the crown, and transgressions in his personal life, namely, sending his natural sons to the United States for education.<ref>Archer, \"Death's Patriots\" p. 78.</ref>\n\nHe was tried and sentenced to death for treason. Morelos was executed by firing squad on December 22, 1815, in San Crist\u00f3bal Ecatepec, north of Mexico City in order that his execution not provoke a dangerous public reaction. He was later judged to be reconciled to the church, lifting his excommunication, as he was seen praying on his way to his execution.<ref>Gustavo Watson Marron, director of the historical archive of the archdiocese, cited in ''El Universal'', August 31, 2009.</ref> After his death, his lieutenant, [[Vicente Guerrero]], continued the war for independence.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Retrato del excelent\u00edsimo se\u00f1or don Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos.png|thumb|right|200px|Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos, 1812, now in [[Chapultepec Castle]] in the Museo Nacional de Historia.]]\n[[File:CoinsMexico.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Jose on a peso.]]\nMorelos is considered a national [[hero]] of Mexico; the state of [[Morelos]] and city of [[Morelia]] are named after him.
