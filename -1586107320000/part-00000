Bonann. The film was directed by [[Seth Gordon]], written by [[Mark Swift and Damian Shannon]] (from a story by Jay Scherick, David Ronn, [[Thomas Lennon]], and [[Robert Ben Garant]]), and stars [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Zac Efron]], [[Jon Bass (actor)|Jon Bass]], [[Alexandra Daddario]], [[Kelly Rohrbach]] and [[Priyanka Chopra]]. The story follows lifeguard [[Mitch Buchannon]] and his team who must take down a drug lord in an effort to save their beach.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on February 22, 2016, in [[Florida]] and [[Savannah, Georgia]]. The film was released in the United States on May 25, 2017, by [[Paramount Pictures]], grossed $177 million worldwide and received negative reviews from critics, with criticism for its crude humor, storyline, and character development, but Johnson did receive some praise.<ref name=\"thr-roundup\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/baywatch-movie-reviews-roundup-1007039|title=\u2018'Baywatch': What the Critics Are Saying|author= Lauren Huff|work= [[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=May 23, 2017|accessdate=January 1, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"opening\" /> ''Baywatch'' received five nominations at the [[38th Golden Raspberry Awards]], including [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor|Worst Actor]] for Efron.<ref name=\"razzies\" />\n\n==Plot==\nIn Emerald Bay, [[Florida]], Lt. Mitch Buchannon and his team of lifeguards, including second-in-command Stephanie Holden and veteran C.J. Parker, protect the beaches and the bay as part of an elite division known as Baywatch. Having made over 500 rescues in his career, Mitch is beloved by the community, to the annoyance of local beat cop Garner Ellerbee and Mitch's superior, Captain Thorpe. During one of his morning patrols, Mitch finds a small pouch of [[flakka]] drug washed up near the Huntley Club, which is now under the ownership of businesswoman Victoria Leeds, who has been secretly bribing city councilman Rodriguez and others in efforts to increase her stake in the bay.\n\nMitch later meets Olympian Matt Brody who, thinking his [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] position entitles him to be on the team without trying out, says that he is already on the team. He then calls Holden in, and they tease Brody. Mitch later makes Brody beat him on the \"big boys'\" course. When the course ends, a mom and her kids start drowning, resulting in the lifeguards and Brody rushing to save them, even though Brody isn't a lifeguard yet. When everything's clear, the results of the tryouts are in, and the people who made it are Ronnie Greenbaum, Summer Quinn, and Matt Brody. \n\nWhen a private yacht catches fire, Brody disobeys orders and dives directly under the flames, causing Holden and C. J. to have to save him. The occupants are evacuated, except for the deceased councilman Rodriguez. Ellerbee disapproves of Mitch's further investigative actions. Mitch and the gang attend a party held by Leeds to investigate about the [[Alpha-Pyrrolidinopentiophenone|flakka]], but without much luck, as Brody makes a fool of himself getting drunk. Mitch, Brody, and Summer later infiltrate the hospital morgue, where they record two of Leeds' henchmen planting a falsified autopsy report to cover up the fact that Rodriguez was murdered on her orders. Unfortunately, they are discovered, and though Mitch manages to subdue and capture one of them, the recording is destroyed and Ellerbee is forced to release their suspect on a lack of evidence. Angered, Thorpe threatens to fire Mitch if he oversteps his authority again.\n\nConvinced that Leeds is running drugs out of the Huntley, Mitch and Brody go undercover and sneak into the club kitchen, where they witness her workers retrieving the drugs from barrels of fish and processing them. They contact Ellerbee, only to learn that another dead body has been found on the beach. Thorpe, enraged that Mitch essentially deserted his post, fires him and names Brody as the new lieutenant. Brody doesn't want the job, but he is forced to take it. Mitch then takes a job as a salesman at [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]].\n\nBrody later sees a \"sand grifter (beach thief)\" steal bags using a cooler. He later intercepts the man and steals the cooler. After finding another pouch of [[Alpha-Pyrrolidinopentiophenone|flakka]] on the beach, Brody steals the second victim's report from Ellerbee using the cooler and brings it to Summer, who confirms his suspicion that the man was killed by a knife instead of a shark attack. Ronnie, upon recognizing the victim as his friend Dave, helps Brody hack into Leeds' servers, revealing her plan to privatize the entire beach by systematically buying out or eliminating every competing business owner.\n\nThe team later infiltrates a private party on Leeds' personal yacht, discovering how she's been using the hull to smuggle the drugs. Brody is captured and placed in a bait cage to be drowned, and a gloating Leeds reveals that she bribed Thorpe to fire Mitch and put Brody for the job before pushing the cage into the water. Just before Brody dies, Summer swims up to him and gives him the kiss of life. However, this turns out to be a hallucination when he regains consciousness and realizes it is actually Mitch resuscitating him. The two catch up to Leeds, while Ronnie and C. J. hack the system and launch fireworks to prevent her escape helicopter from landing. Just as they run out, a wounded Mitch, having intentionally stung himself with a [[sea urchin]] to boost his adrenaline, uses a [[Roman candle (firework)|Roman candle]] to blow Leeds up, saving Brody once again. Ellerbee arrives and takes Leeds' henchmen into custody, apologizing to Mitch for doubting him. Thorpe arrives and begins to berate Mitch for not understanding he's fired and returning to the beach. In response, Brody punches Thorpe in the face. Thorpe is subsequently arrested for his role in Leeds' plan.\n\nIn the aftermath, Ronnie and Brody begin relationships with C.J. and Summer respectively. Mitch, having been reinstated, no longer makes Summer, Ronnie, and Brody trainees and introduces them to their new captain, [[Pamela Anderson|Casey Jean]].\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- opening title card order at start of film, role names per closing credits -->\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as [[Mitch Buchannon]]\n* [[Zac Efron]] as Matt Brody\n* [[Priyanka Chopra]] as Victoria Leeds \n* [[Alexandra Daddario]] as Summer Quinn\n* [[Jon Bass (actor)|Jon Bass]] as Ronnie Greenbaum\n* [[Hannibal Buress]] as Dave the Tech\n* [[Kelly Rohrbach]] as [[C.

Bonann.

The story follows lifeguard [[Mitch Buchannon]] and his team who must take down a drug lord in an effort to save their beach.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on February 22, 2016, in [[Florida]] and [[Savannah, Georgia]]. The film was released in the United States on May 25, 2017, by [[Paramount Pictures]], grossed $177 million worldwide and received negative reviews from critics, with criticism for its crude humor, storyline, and character development, but Johnson did receive some praise.<ref name=\"thr-roundup\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/baywatch-movie-reviews-roundup-1007039|title=\u2018'Baywatch': What the Critics Are Saying|author= Lauren Huff|work= [[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=May 23, 2017|accessdate=January 1, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"opening\" /> ''Baywatch'' received five nominations at the [[38th Golden Raspberry Awards]], including [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor|Worst Actor]] for Efron.<ref name=\"razzies\" />\n\n==Plot==\nIn Emerald Bay, [[Florida]], Lt. Mitch Buchannon and his team of lifeguards, including second-in-command Stephanie Holden and veteran C.J. Parker, protect the beaches and the bay as part of an elite division known as Baywatch. Having made over 500 rescues in his career, Mitch is beloved by the community, to the annoyance of local beat cop Garner Ellerbee and Mitch's superior, Captain Thorpe. During one of his morning patrols, Mitch finds a small pouch of [[flakka]] drug washed up near the Huntley Club, which is now under the ownership of businesswoman Victoria Leeds, who has been secretly bribing city councilman Rodriguez and others in efforts to increase her stake in the bay.\n\nMitch later meets Olympian Matt Brody who, thinking his [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] position entitles him to be on the team without trying out, says that he is already on the team. He then calls Holden in, and they tease Brody. Mitch later makes Brody beat him on the \"big boys'\" course. When the course ends, a mom and her kids start drowning, resulting in the lifeguards and Brody rushing to save them, even though Brody isn't a lifeguard yet. When everything's clear, the results of the tryouts are in, and the people who made it are Ronnie Greenbaum, Summer Quinn, and Matt Brody. \n\nWhen a private yacht catches fire, Brody disobeys orders and dives directly under the flames, causing Holden and C. J. to have to save him. The occupants are evacuated, except for the deceased councilman Rodriguez. Ellerbee disapproves of Mitch's further investigative actions. Mitch and the gang attend a party held by Leeds to investigate about the [[Alpha-Pyrrolidinopentiophenone|flakka]], but without much luck, as Brody makes a fool of himself getting drunk. Mitch, Brody, and Summer later infiltrate the hospital morgue, where they record two of Leeds' henchmen planting a falsified autopsy report to cover up the fact that Rodriguez was murdered on her orders. Unfortunately, they are discovered, and though Mitch manages to subdue and capture one of them, the recording is destroyed and Ellerbee is forced to release their suspect on a lack of evidence. Angered, Thorpe threatens to fire Mitch if he oversteps his authority again.\n\nConvinced that Leeds is running drugs out of the Huntley, Mitch and Brody go undercover and sneak into the club kitchen, where they witness her workers retrieving the drugs from barrels of fish and processing them. They contact Ellerbee, only to learn that another dead body has been found on the beach. Thorpe, enraged that Mitch essentially deserted his post, fires him and names Brody as the new lieutenant. Brody doesn't want the job, but he is forced to take it. Mitch then takes a job as a salesman at [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]].\n\nBrody later sees a \"sand grifter (beach thief)\" steal bags using a cooler. He later intercepts the man and steals the cooler. After finding another pouch of [[Alpha-Pyrrolidinopentiophenone|flakka]] on the beach, Brody steals the second victim's report from Ellerbee using the cooler and brings it to Summer, who confirms his suspicion that the man was killed by a knife instead of a shark attack. Ronnie, upon recognizing the victim as his friend Dave, helps Brody hack into Leeds' servers, revealing her plan to privatize the entire beach by systematically buying out or eliminating every competing business owner.\n\nThe team later infiltrates a private party on Leeds' personal yacht, discovering how she's been using the hull to smuggle the drugs. Brody is captured and placed in a bait cage to be drowned, and a gloating Leeds reveals that she bribed Thorpe to fire Mitch and put Brody for the job before pushing the cage into the water. Just before Brody dies, Summer swims up to him and gives him the kiss of life. However, this turns out to be a hallucination when he regains consciousness and realizes it is actually Mitch resuscitating him. The two catch up to Leeds, while Ronnie and C. J. hack the system and launch fireworks to prevent her escape helicopter from landing. Just as they run out, a wounded Mitch, having intentionally stung himself with a [[sea urchin]] to boost his adrenaline, uses a [[Roman candle (firework)|Roman candle]] to blow Leeds up, saving Brody once again. Ellerbee arrives and takes Leeds' henchmen into custody, apologizing to Mitch for doubting him. Thorpe arrives and begins to berate Mitch for not understanding he's fired and returning to the beach. In response, Brody punches Thorpe in the face. Thorpe is subsequently arrested for his role in Leeds' plan.\n\nIn the aftermath, Ronnie and Brody begin relationships with C.J. and Summer respectively. Mitch, having been reinstated, no longer makes Summer, Ronnie, and Brody trainees and introduces them to their new captain, [[Pamela Anderson|Casey Jean]].\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- opening title card order at start of film, role names per closing credits -->\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as [[Mitch Buchannon]]\n* [[Zac Efron]] as Matt Brody\n* [[Priyanka Chopra]] as Victoria Leeds \n* [[Alexandra Daddario]] as Summer Quinn\n* [[Jon Bass (actor)|Jon Bass]] as Ronnie Greenbaum\n* [[Hannibal Buress]] as Dave the Tech\n* [[Kelly Rohrbach]] as [[C.

The crew was horrifically slaughtered and their corpses are reanimated into creatures known as \"Necromorphs\". The various types of Necromorphs appeared throughout the game, each with different abilities and requiring different tactics to defeat. The game is played from an over-the-shoulder third-person perspective.<ref name=ignpreview1 />\n\n''Dead Space'' does not use a traditional [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]]. Instead, all information is relayed to the player via [[Holography|holographic projections]] from Isaac's Resource Integration Gear (RIG) spacesuit and the weapons themselves. For example, a small holographic display is mounted on Isaac's weapons to indicate the ammunition count while aiming. Also, the health meter is integrated into his suit spine and the spines of the suits that are worn by the other game characters.<ref name=gamespypreview1>{{cite web|last=Graziani|first=Gabe|title=Previews: Dead Space|work=GameSpy.com|publisher=IGN Entertainment|date=2007-10-09|url=http://uk.xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/dead-space/825786p1.html|accessdate=2008-05-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214075024/http://uk.xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/dead-space/825786p1.html|archive-date=February 14, 2008|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The player can check the current objectives and the 3D map via the floating holograms that are projected in front of Isaac or access the inventory screen to manage items or choose guns. However, the game still progresses in real-time during these activities so the player remains in danger of being attacked while browsing through menus and the map.<ref name=gamespypreview1 />\n\nCombat involves a mechanism called \"strategic [[dismemberment]]\" which the player must cut the limbs or sections of the individual Necromorphs off to defeat them. For example, shooting most Necromorphs in the head will have little effect and will only disorient them.

A military-grade [[automatic rifle]] is available and Isaac can also attack the enemies by clubbing them with his weapon or stomping on them. All weapons featured a secondary-fire mode. For example, the Plasma Cutter can be rotated 90 degrees for more effective dismemberment of vertical limbs (Such as legs on a normal [[Bipedalism|bipedal]] humanoid).<ref>{{cite web|first=Jeff|last=Haynes|url=http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/908/908187p1.html|title=Weapons of Dead Space|publisher=IGN|date=2008-09-05|accessdate=2011-12-18}}</ref> The player must scavenge for ammunition and items which are found throughout the ship or dropped by the Necromorphs when they are killed.
