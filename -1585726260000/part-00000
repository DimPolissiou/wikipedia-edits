Those that could not bring cash with them to the church were sent banking details of a company, Rising Estates, the directors of which are Bushiri lieutenants, Willah Mudolo, Duncan Oduor Otieno and Kit Ching Catherine Kum. Almost two years later, the people who gave Bushiri money claim to have not received anything back.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mashego |first1=Abram |title=\u2018Robbed\u2019 from the pulpit: How Bushiri conned investors out of millions |url=https://city-press.news24.com/News/robbed-from-the-pulpit-how-bushiri-conned-investors-out-of-millions-20190225 |website=City Press |publisher=News24.com |accessdate=1 March 2019 |date=25 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe investment scheme appears to be linked to Palambano Investments as six congregants from Bushiri's church claim they were told that the money they donated would be invested in Zambia in \"gold minerals\" as part of a Palamabo investment scheme. The congregants provided proof that the money had been paid into the ECG's First National Bank account. [[East London, Eastern Cape]], police spokesperson Capt Mluleki Mbi confirmed that a case had been opened against Palambano Investments and its directors in response to a complaint by Nombeko Dwesini, one of Bushiri's congregants.<ref name=\"Fuzile 2019\">{{cite web | last=Fuzile | first=Bongani | title=Major One Bushiri 'duped us with gold scam' | website=TimesLIVE | date=10 February 2019 | url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/news/2019-02-10-major-one-bushiri-duped-us-with-gold-scam/ | access-date=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Paternity ===\nIt is alleged that in 2010 Bushiri impregnated a teenage Malawian woman, whom he met in 2007 in their home town, Mzimba. It is further claimed that he bribed her with a cheque for {{val|80000|fmt=gaps}} Malawian kwacha (about R{{val|1500|fmt=gaps}}) to have an abortion but that the cheque bounced. The woman subsequently gave birth in 2011 to a girl who \"is the spitting image of Bushiri and it is widely known in the district that he is the biological father,\u201d according to the father of the woman. The woman is now married and the family alleges that they \"kept quiet out of fear.\" The village that the woman and child live in broke the news before the family approached Bushiri. Bushiri claims that the cheque was stolen from him and that, on the day the woman claims he made her pregnant, Bushiri was at a police station dealing with an attempted hijacking. In 2018, the mother again tried to get maintenance via the courts but was unsuccessful. Family members of the girl claim that Bushiri admits to the allegations in private, despite his public denials and have demanded a paternity test. His lawyer, Terrence Baloyi, did not respond to emails, text messages and calls from City Press seeking comment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Makhoba |first1=Ntombizodwa |title=Bushiri\u2019s hidden baby: Family says he tried to bribe woman to have abortion {{!}} City Press |url=https://city-press.news24.com/News/bushiris-hidden-baby-family-says-he-tried-to-bribe-woman-to-have-abortion-20190311 |website=News 24 |publisher=City Press |accessdate=19 March 2019 |date=11 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Non-payment for clothing ===\nDarlington Manyawu, a businessman based in Hong Kong, claims to have sold Bushiri clothing to the value of R{{val|450000|fmt=gaps}} but had not received payment for them.

Those that could not bring cash with them to the church were sent banking details of a company, Rising Estates, the directors of which are Bushiri lieutenants, Willah Mudolo, Duncan Oduor Otieno and Kit Ching Catherine Kum. Almost two years later, the people who gave Bushiri money claim to have not received anything back.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mashego |first1=Abram |title=\u2018Robbed\u2019 from the pulpit: How Bushiri conned investors out of millions |url=https://city-press.news24.com/News/robbed-from-the-pulpit-how-bushiri-conned-investors-out-of-millions-20190225 |website=City Press |publisher=News24.com |accessdate=1 March 2019 |date=25 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe investment scheme appears to be linked to Palambano Investments as six congregants from Bushiri's church claim they were told that the money they donated would be invested in Zambia in \"gold minerals\" as part of a Palamabo investment scheme. The congregants provided proof that the money had been paid into the ECG's First National Bank account. [[East London, Eastern Cape]], police spokesperson Capt Mluleki Mbi confirmed that a case had been opened against Palambano Investments and its directors in response to a complaint by Nombeko Dwesini, one of Bushiri's congregants.<ref name=\"Fuzile 2019\">{{cite web | last=Fuzile | first=Bongani | title=Major One Bushiri 'duped us with gold scam' | website=TimesLIVE | date=10 February 2019 | url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/news/2019-02-10-major-one-bushiri-duped-us-with-gold-scam/ | access-date=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Paternity ===\nIt is alleged that in 2010 Bushiri impregnated a teenage Malawian woman, whom he met in 2007 in their home town, Mzimba. It is further claimed that he bribed her with a cheque for {{val|80000|fmt=gaps}} Malawian kwacha (about R{{val|1500|fmt=gaps}}) to have an abortion but that the cheque bounced. The woman subsequently gave birth in 2011 to a girl who \"is the spitting image of Bushiri and it is widely known in the district that he is the biological father,\u201d according to the father of the woman. The woman is now married and the family alleges that they \"kept quiet out of fear.\" The village that the woman and child live in broke the news before the family approached Bushiri. Bushiri claims that the cheque was stolen from him and that, on the day the woman claims he made her pregnant, Bushiri was at a police station dealing with an attempted hijacking. In 2018, the mother again tried to get maintenance via the courts but was unsuccessful. Family members of the girl claim that Bushiri admits to the allegations in private, despite his public denials and have demanded a paternity test. His lawyer, Terrence Baloyi, did not respond to emails, text messages and calls from City Press seeking comment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Makhoba |first1=Ntombizodwa |title=Bushiri\u2019s hidden baby: Family says he tried to bribe woman to have abortion {{!}} City Press |url=https://city-press.news24.com/News/bushiris-hidden-baby-family-says-he-tried-to-bribe-woman-to-have-abortion-20190311 |website=News 24 |publisher=City Press |accessdate=19 March 2019 |date=11 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Non-payment for clothing ===\nDarlington Manyawu, a businessman based in Hong Kong, claims to have sold Bushiri clothing to the value of R{{val|450000|fmt=gaps}} but had not received payment for them.

It was located in [[Ephesus]] (near the modern town of [[Sel\u00e7uk]] in present-day [[Turkey]]). It was completely rebuilt twice, once after a devastating flood and three hundred years later after an act of arson, and in its final form was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].

[[Callimachus]], in his ''Hymn to Artemis'', attributed it to the [[Amazons]]. In the 7th century BC, it was destroyed by a flood. Its reconstruction, in more grandiose form, began around 550 BC, under [[Chersiphron]], the Cretan [[architect]], and his son [[Metagenes]].

This version of the temple was destroyed in 356 BC by [[Herostratus]] in an act of [[arson]].\n\nThe next, greatest and last form of the temple, funded by the Ephesians themselves, is described in [[Antipater of Sidon]]'s list of the world's Seven Wonders:\n<blockquote>I have set eyes on the wall of lofty [[Babylon]] on which is a road for chariots, and the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|statue of Zeus by the Alpheus]], and the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon|hanging gardens]], and the [[Colossus of Rhodes|colossus of the Sun]], and the huge labour of the [[Egyptian pyramids|high pyramids]], and the vast [[Mausoleum of Mausolus|tomb of Mausolus]]; but when I saw the house of Artemis that mounted to the clouds, those other marvels lost their brilliancy, and I said, \"Lo, apart from Olympus, the Sun never looked on aught so grand\".<ref>Antipater, ''[[Greek Anthology]]'' IX.58.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Location and history==\n[[File:Temple of Artemis.jpg|thumb|alt=imaginary Temple of Artemis 16th-century hand-colored engraving by Martin Heemskerck|The fame of the Temple of Artemis was known in the [[Renaissance]], as demonstrated in this imagined portrayal of the temple in a 16th-century hand-colored engraving by [[Martin Heemskerck]].]]\n\nThe Temple of Artemis was located near the ancient city of Ephesus, about {{convert|75|km}} south from the modern port city of [[\u0130zmir]], in Turkey.

[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] was certain that it antedated the Ionic immigration by many years, being older even than the oracular shrine of Apollo at [[Didyma]].<ref>Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 7.7\u20138.</ref>  He said that the pre-Ionic inhabitants of the city were [[Leleges]] and [[Lydia]]ns.  [[Callimachus]], in his ''Hymn to Artemis'' attributed the earliest ''temenos'' at Ephesus to the [[Amazons]], whose worship he imagined already centered upon an image (''bretas'') of Artemis, their matron goddess. Pausanias says that [[Pindar]] believed the temple's founding Amazons to have been involved with the siege at Athens. [[Tacitus]] also believed in the Amazon foundation, however Pausanias believed the temple predated the Amazons.<ref>{{Cite book | last1=Steinem | first1=Gloria | last2=Chesler | first2=Phyllis | last3=Feitler | first3=Bea | title=Wonder Woman | publisher=Hole, Rinehart and Winston and Warner Books | date=1972 | isbn=0-03-005376-5 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/wonderwoman00mars }}</ref>\n\n[[Modern archaeology]] cannot confirm Callimachus's Amazons, but Pausanias's account of the site's antiquity seems well-founded.

Among the flood debris were the remains of a carved ivory plaque of a [[griffin]] and the [[Tree of Life]], apparently North Syrian, and some drilled tear-shaped amber drops of elliptical cross-section. These probably once dressed a wooden effigy (''[[xoanon]]'') of the Lady of Ephesus, which must have been destroyed or recovered from the flood.

It was 115&nbsp;m (377&nbsp;ft) long and 46&nbsp;m (151&nbsp;ft) wide, supposedly the first Greek temple built of marble. Its [[peripteral]] columns stood some 13&nbsp;m (40&nbsp;ft) high, in double rows that formed a wide ceremonial passage around the ''[[cella]]'' that housed the goddess's cult image. Thirty-six of these columns were, according to Pliny, decorated by carvings in relief. A new ebony or blackened grapewood [[Cult image|cult statue]] was sculpted by Endoios,<ref>[[Pliny's Natural History]], 16.79.213-16; Pliny's source was the Roman [[Mucianus]], who thought that the cult image by an \"Endoios\" was extremely ancient, however. Endoios' name appears in late 7th-century Attic inscriptions, and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] notes works attributed to him. Most importantly, the Ephesians of Mucianus' time maintained the tradition that a particular sculptor had created the remade image {{Harv|LiDonnici|1992|p=398}}.</ref> and a ''[[naiskos]]'' to house it was erected east of the open-air altar.\n\n===Foundation deposit===\n[[File:Triti, Phanes, 625-600 BC, Ionia - 301224.jpg|thumb|The earliest known inscribed [[coin]]age, from the foundation deposit of the Temple of Athena: [[electrum]] coin of [[Phanes (coin issuer)|Phanes]] from [[Ephesus#Archaic period|Ephesus]], 625-600 BC.

On the whole, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] dealt fairly with Ephesus, but removed some religious artifacts from Artemis' Temple to [[Sardis]] and brought Persian priests into her Ephesian cult; this was not forgiven.<ref>{{Harvnb|LiDonnici|1992|p=401}}.</ref> When Alexander conquered the Persians, his offer to finance the Temple's second rebuilding was politely but firmly refused.<ref>The intended offering might have included a divine statue of Alexander himself, or simply an inscription commemorating his subsidy as a gift to the Goddess, with himself as her particular protege.

It was part of a definitively Greek political and cultural identity, essential to the economic life of the region, and an excellent opportunity for young, unmarried Greeks of both sexes to seek out marriage partners. Games, contests and theatrical performances were held in the goddess's name, and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] describes her procession as a magnificent crowd-puller; it was shown in one of [[Apelles]]' best paintings, which depicted the goddess's image carried through the streets and surrounded by maidens.<ref>Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'', 35\u201393.</ref> In the [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial era]], the emperor [[Commodus]] lent his name to the festival games, and might have sponsored them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnold|1972|p=18}}, citing Xenophon for marriage-broking at the Ephesian ''Artemesia''.</ref>\n\n==Ephesian Artemis==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    =  \n | image1    = Artemis Efes Museum.JPG\n | width1    = 160\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = The Lady of Ephesus, 1st century AD, [[Ephesus Archaeological Museum]]\n | image2    = ArtemisEphesus.jpg\n | width2    = 190\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = An 18th-century [[engraving]] of a Roman marble copy of a Greek replica of a lost Geometric period ''[[xoanon]]''\n }}\nFrom the Greek point of view, the Ephesian Artemis is a distinctive form of their goddess [[Artemis]]. In Greek cult and myth, Artemis is the twin of [[Apollo]], a virgin huntress who supplanted the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Selene]] as goddess of the [[Moon]]. At Ephesus, a goddess whom the Greeks associated with Artemis was venerated in an archaic, pre-Hellenic [[cult image]]<ref name=\"auto1\">The iconic images have been most thoroughly assembled by Robert Fleischer, ''Artemis von Ephesos und der erwandte Kultstatue von Anatolien und Syrien'' EPRO '''35''' (Leiden: Brill) 1973.</ref> that was carved of wood (a ''[[xoanon]]'') and kept decorated with jewelry. The features are most similar to Near-Eastern and Egyptian deities, and least similar to Greek ones. The body and legs are enclosed within a tapering pillar-like [[Term (architecture)|term]], from which the goddess' feet protrude. On the coins minted at Ephesus, the goddess wears a [[mural crown]] (like a city's walls), an attribute of [[Cybele]] as a protector of cities (see ''[[polos]]'').<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n[[File:Fontana di Diana Efesina-Tivoli, Villa d'Este.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=16th-century fountain of ''Diana Efesina'', at Villa d'Este, Tivoli, Lazio, Italy|Traditional many-breasted interpretation in a 16th-century fountain of ''Diana Efesina'', [[Villa d'Este]], [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]], [[Italy]]]]\nThe traditional interpretation of the oval objects covering the upper part of the Ephesian Artemis is that they represent multiple breasts, symbolizing her fertility. This interpretation began in late antiquity and resulted in designations of the Ephesian goddess as ''Diana Efesia Multimammia'' and other related descriptions.<ref name=Nielsen/> This interpretation was rooted in [[Minucius Felix]] and [[Jerome]]'s Christian attacks on pagan popular religion, and modern scholarship has cast doubt on the traditional interpretation that the statue depicts a many-breasted goddess. Evidence suggests that the oval objects were not intended to depict part of the goddess' anatomy at all. In some versions of the statue, the goddess' skin has been painted black (likely to emulate the aged wood of the original), while her clothes and regalia, including the so-called \"breasts\", were left unpainted or cast in different colors.<ref name=Nielsen/> Robert Fleischer suggested that instead of breasts, the oval objects were decorations that would have been hung ceremonially on the original wood statue (possibly eggs or the scrotal sacs of sacrificed bulls<ref>{{cite journal |last=Seiterle |title=Artemis: die Grosse G\u00f6ttin von Ephesos |journal=Antike Welt |volume=10 |year=1979 |pages=3\u201316 }} accepted in the 1980s by [[Walter Burkert]] and Brita Alroth, among others, criticised and rejected by Robert Fleischer, but widely popularized.</ref>), and which were incorporated as carved features on later copies.<ref name=Nielsen/> The \"breasts\" of the Lady of Ephesus, it now appears, were likely based on [[amber]] gourd-shaped drops, elliptical in cross-section and drilled for hanging, that were rediscovered in the archaeological excavations of 1987\u20131988. These objects remained in place where the ancient wooden statue of the goddess had been caught by an 8th-century flood. This form of jewelry, then, had already been developed by the [[Geometric Period]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fleischer |title=Neues zur kleinasiatischen Kultstatue |journal=Arch\u00e4ologischer Anzeiger |volume=98 |year=1983 |pages=81\u201393 }}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Bammer|1990|p=153}}.</ref>\n\nOn the coins she rests either arm on a staff formed of entwined [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpents]] or of a stack of ''[[Ouroboros|ouroboroi]]'', the eternal serpent with its tail in its mouth.

It was located in [[Ephesus]] (near the modern town of [[Sel\u00e7uk]] in present-day [[Turkey]]).

[[Callimachus]], in his ''Hymn to Artemis'', attributed it to the [[Amazons]]. In the 7th century BC, it was destroyed by a flood. Its reconstruction, in more grandiose form, began around 550 BC, under [[Chersiphron]], the Cretan [[architect]], and his son [[Metagenes]]. The project was funded by [[Croesus]] of [[Lydia]], and took 10 years to complete. This version of the temple was destroyed in 356 BC by [[Herostratus]] in an act of [[arson]].\n\nThe next, greatest and last form of the temple, funded by the Ephesians themselves, is described in [[Antipater of Sidon]]'s list of the world's Seven Wonders:\n<blockquote>I have set eyes on the wall of lofty [[Babylon]] on which is a road for chariots, and the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|statue of Zeus by the Alpheus]], and the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon|hanging gardens]], and the [[Colossus of Rhodes|colossus of the Sun]], and the huge labour of the [[Egyptian pyramids|high pyramids]], and the vast [[Mausoleum of Mausolus|tomb of Mausolus]]; but when I saw the house of Artemis that mounted to the clouds, those other marvels lost their brilliancy, and I said, \"Lo, apart from Olympus, the Sun never looked on aught so grand\".<ref>Antipater, ''[[Greek Anthology]]'' IX.58.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Location and history==\n[[File:Temple of Artemis.jpg|thumb|alt=imaginary Temple of Artemis 16th-century hand-colored engraving by Martin Heemskerck|The fame of the Temple of Artemis was known in the [[Renaissance]], as demonstrated in this imagined portrayal of the temple in a 16th-century hand-colored engraving by [[Martin Heemskerck]].]]\n\nThe Temple of Artemis was located near the ancient city of Ephesus, about {{convert|75|km}} south from the modern port city of [[\u0130zmir]], in Turkey.

[[Callimachus]], in his ''Hymn to Artemis'' attributed the earliest ''temenos'' at Ephesus to the [[Amazons]], whose worship he imagined already centered upon an image (''bretas'') of Artemis, their matron goddess. Pausanias says that [[Pindar]] believed the temple's founding Amazons to have been involved with the siege at Athens. [[Tacitus]] also believed in the Amazon foundation, however Pausanias believed the temple predated the Amazons.<ref>{{Cite book | last1=Steinem | first1=Gloria | last2=Chesler | first2=Phyllis | last3=Feitler | first3=Bea | title=Wonder Woman | publisher=Hole, Rinehart and Winston and Warner Books | date=1972 | isbn=0-03-005376-5 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/wonderwoman00mars }}</ref>\n\n[[Modern archaeology]] cannot confirm Callimachus's Amazons, but Pausanias's account of the site's antiquity seems well-founded.

Its [[peripteral]] columns stood some 13&nbsp;m (40&nbsp;ft) high, in double rows that formed a wide ceremonial passage around the ''[[cella]]'' that housed the goddess's cult image. Thirty-six of these columns were, according to Pliny, decorated by carvings in relief. A new ebony or blackened grapewood [[Cult image|cult statue]] was sculpted by Endoios,<ref>[[Pliny's Natural History]], 16.79.213-16; Pliny's source was the Roman [[Mucianus]], who thought that the cult image by an \"Endoios\" was extremely ancient, however. Endoios' name appears in late 7th-century Attic inscriptions, and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] notes works attributed to him. Most importantly, the Ephesians of Mucianus' time maintained the tradition that a particular sculptor had created the remade image {{Harv|LiDonnici|1992|p=398}}.</ref> and a ''[[naiskos]]'' to house it was erected east of the open-air altar.\n\n===Foundation deposit===\n[[File:Triti, Phanes, 625-600 BC, Ionia - 301224.jpg|thumb|The earliest known inscribed [[coin]]age, from the foundation deposit of the Temple of Athena: [[electrum]] coin of [[Phanes (coin issuer)|Phanes]] from [[Ephesus#Archaic period|Ephesus]], 625-600 BC.

Once Persia ousted and replaced their Lydian overlord [[Croesus]], the Ephesians played down his contribution to the Temple's restoration.

It was part of a definitively Greek political and cultural identity, essential to the economic life of the region, and an excellent opportunity for young, unmarried Greeks of both sexes to seek out marriage partners. Games, contests and theatrical performances were held in the goddess's name, and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] describes her procession as a magnificent crowd-puller; it was shown in one of [[Apelles]]' best paintings, which depicted the goddess's image carried through the streets and surrounded by maidens.<ref>Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'', 35\u201393.</ref> In the [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial era]], the emperor [[Commodus]] lent his name to the festival games, and might have sponsored them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnold|1972|p=18}}, citing Xenophon for marriage-broking at the Ephesian ''Artemesia''.</ref>\n\n==Ephesian Artemis==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    =  \n | image1    = Artemis Efes Museum.JPG\n | width1    = 160\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = The Lady of Ephesus, 1st century AD, [[Ephesus Archaeological Museum]]\n | image2    = ArtemisEphesus.jpg\n | width2    = 190\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = An 18th-century [[engraving]] of a Roman marble copy of a Greek replica of a lost Geometric period ''[[xoanon]]''\n }}\nFrom the Greek point of view, the Ephesian Artemis is a distinctive form of their goddess [[Artemis]]. In Greek cult and myth, Artemis is the twin of [[Apollo]], a virgin huntress who supplanted the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Selene]] as goddess of the [[Moon]]. At Ephesus, a goddess whom the Greeks associated with Artemis was venerated in an archaic, pre-Hellenic [[cult image]]<ref name=\"auto1\">The iconic images have been most thoroughly assembled by Robert Fleischer, ''Artemis von Ephesos und der erwandte Kultstatue von Anatolien und Syrien'' EPRO '''35''' (Leiden: Brill) 1973.</ref> that was carved of wood (a ''[[xoanon]]'') and kept decorated with jewelry. The features are most similar to Near-Eastern and Egyptian deities, and least similar to Greek ones. The body and legs are enclosed within a tapering pillar-like [[Term (architecture)|term]], from which the goddess' feet protrude. On the coins minted at Ephesus, the goddess wears a [[mural crown]] (like a city's walls), an attribute of [[Cybele]] as a protector of cities (see ''[[polos]]'').<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n[[File:Fontana di Diana Efesina-Tivoli, Villa d'Este.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=16th-century fountain of ''Diana Efesina'', at Villa d'Este, Tivoli, Lazio, Italy|Traditional many-breasted interpretation in a 16th-century fountain of ''Diana Efesina'', [[Villa d'Este]], [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]], [[Italy]]]]\nThe traditional interpretation of the oval objects covering the upper part of the Ephesian Artemis is that they represent multiple breasts, symbolizing her fertility. This interpretation began in late antiquity and resulted in designations of the Ephesian goddess as ''Diana Efesia Multimammia'' and other related descriptions.<ref name=Nielsen/> This interpretation was rooted in [[Minucius Felix]] and [[Jerome]]'s Christian attacks on pagan popular religion, and modern scholarship has cast doubt on the traditional interpretation that the statue depicts a many-breasted goddess. Evidence suggests that the oval objects were not intended to depict part of the goddess' anatomy at all. In some versions of the statue, the goddess' skin has been painted black (likely to emulate the aged wood of the original), while her clothes and regalia, including the so-called \"breasts\", were left unpainted or cast in different colors.<ref name=Nielsen/> Robert Fleischer suggested that instead of breasts, the oval objects were decorations that would have been hung ceremonially on the original wood statue (possibly eggs or the scrotal sacs of sacrificed bulls<ref>{{cite journal |last=Seiterle |title=Artemis: die Grosse G\u00f6ttin von Ephesos |journal=Antike Welt |volume=10 |year=1979 |pages=3\u201316 }} accepted in the 1980s by [[Walter Burkert]] and Brita Alroth, among others, criticised and rejected by Robert Fleischer, but widely popularized.</ref>), and which were incorporated as carved features on later copies.<ref name=Nielsen/> The \"breasts\" of the Lady of Ephesus, it now appears, were likely based on [[amber]] gourd-shaped drops, elliptical in cross-section and drilled for hanging, that were rediscovered in the archaeological excavations of 1987\u20131988. These objects remained in place where the ancient wooden statue of the goddess had been caught by an 8th-century flood. This form of jewelry, then, had already been developed by the [[Geometric Period]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fleischer |title=Neues zur kleinasiatischen Kultstatue |journal=Arch\u00e4ologischer Anzeiger |volume=98 |year=1983 |pages=81\u201393 }}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Bammer|1990|p=153}}.</ref>\n\nOn the coins she rests either arm on a staff formed of entwined [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpents]] or of a stack of ''[[Ouroboros|ouroboroi]]'', the eternal serpent with its tail in its mouth. In some accounts, the Lady of Ephesus was attended by eunuch priests called \"Megabyzoi\"; this could have been a proper name or a title. The practise of ritual self-emasculation as qualification to serve a deity is usually identified with Cybele's eunuch mendicant priests, the [[Galli]].
