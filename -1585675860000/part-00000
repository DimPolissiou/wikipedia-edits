Large scale adoption began in 2019 and today virtually every telecommunication service provider in the developed world is upgrading its infrastructure to offer 5G functionality. \n\nThe [[Electromagnetic spectrum|frequency spectrum]] of 5G is divided into millimeter waves, mid-band, and low-band. Low-band uses a similar frequency range as the predecessor, [[4G]]. 5G millimeter wave is the fastest, with actual speeds often being 1\u20132 Gbit/s down. Frequencies are above 24&nbsp;GHz reaching up to 72&nbsp;GHz which is above the [[extremely high frequency]] band's lower boundary. The reach is short, so more cells are required. Millimeter waves have difficulty traversing many walls and windows, so indoor coverage is limited.\n\n5G mid-band is the most widely deployed, in over 30 networks. Speeds in a 100&nbsp;MHz wide band are usually 100\u2013400 Mbit/s down. In the lab and occasionally in the field, speeds can go over a gigabit per second. Frequencies deployed are from 2.4&nbsp;GHz to 4.2&nbsp;GHz. [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] and [[China Mobile]] are using 2.5&nbsp;GHz, while others are mostly between 3.3 and 4.2&nbsp;GHz.  Many areas can be covered simply by upgrading existing towers, which lowers the cost.  Mid-band networks have better reach, bringing the cost close to the cost of 4G.\n\n5G low-band offers similar capacity to advanced 4G. \nIn the [[United States]], [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]] and [[AT&T Mobility|AT&T]] launched low-band services on the first week of December 2019. T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray warns that speeds on their 600&nbsp;MHz 5G may be as low as 25 Mbit/s down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov|title=FCC testimony Neville Ray|last=Ray|first=Neville|date=June 18, 2018|website=FCC.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> AT&T, using 850&nbsp;MHz, will also usually deliver less than 100 Mbit/s in 2019. The performance will improve, but cannot be significantly greater than robust 4G in the same spectrum.\n\n[[Verizon Wireless|Verizon]], AT&T, and almost all 5G providers in 2019 have latencies between 25\u201335 milliseconds. The \"air latency\" (between a phone and a tower) in 2019 equipment is 8\u201312 ms. The latency to the server, farther back in the network, raise the average to ~30 ms, 25\u201340% lower than typical 4G deployed. Adding \"Edge Servers\" close to the towers can bring latency down to 10\u201320 ms. Lower latency, such as the often touted 1 ms, is years away and does not include the time to the server.\n\nThe industry project [[3GPP]] defines any system using \"[[5G NR]]\" (5G New Radio) software as, \"5G\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2017/08/02/understanding-3gpp-starting-basics|title=Understanding 3GPP \u2013 starting with the basics|date=2017-08-01|website=Qualcomm|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> a definition that came into general use by late 2018.

[[Analog signal]]s representing sounds and images are digitized in the telephone, converted by an [[analog to digital converter]] and transmitted as a stream of [[binary digit|bits]]. All the 5G wireless devices in a cell communicate by radio waves with a local [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] array and low power automated [[transceiver]] ([[transmitter]] and [[radio receiver|receiver]]) in the cell, over frequency channels assigned by the transceiver from a pool of frequencies that are reused in other cells. The local antennas are connected with the [[Public switched telephone network|telephone network]] and the [[Internet]] by a high bandwidth [[optical fiber]] or wireless [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul connection]]. As in other cell networks, a mobile device crossing from one cell to another is automatically \"[[Handover|handed off]]\" seamlessly to the new cell.\n\nVerizon and a few others are using [[millimeter wave]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Millimeter Wave Mobile Communications for 5G Cellular: It Will Work! |journal = IEEE Access |date = 2013-01-01 |issn = 2169-3536 |pages = 335\u2013349 |volume = 1 |doi = 10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2260813 |first = T.S. |last = Rappaport |first2 = Shu |last2 = Sun |first3 = R. |last3 = Mayzus |first4 = Hang |last4 = Zhao |first5 = Y. |last5 = Azar |first6 = K. |last6 = Wang |first7 = G.N. |last7 = Wong |first8 = J.K. |last8 = Schulz |first9 = M. |last9 = Samimi}}</ref> Millimeter waves have shorter range than [[microwave]]s, therefore the cells are limited to smaller size.

Some are only a few inches (several centimeters) long. \n\nMassive MIMO ([[multiple-input multiple-output]]), was deployed in 4G as early as 2016. Massive MIMO, typically uses 32 to 128 small antennas at each cell. In the right frequencies and configuration, it can increase performance from 4 to 10 times<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wirelessone.news/9-mimo/687-china-mobile-softbank-ordering-1-000-s-of-massive-mimo-bases-2|title=\"I am crazy about Massive MIMO,\" Kitihara of Softbank ordering 1,000's of Massive MIMO bases|website=wirelessone.news|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>.  Multiple [[bitstream]]s of data are transmitted simultaneously. In a technique called ''[[beamforming]]'', the base station computer will continuously calculate the best route for radio waves to reach each wireless device, and will organize multiple antennas to work together as [[phased array]]s to create beams of millimeter waves to reach the device.<ref name=\"Nordrum\" /><ref name=\"Hoffman\">{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/340002/what-is-5g-and-how-fast-will-it-be/|title=What is 5G, and how fast will it be?|last=Hoffman|first=Chris|date=7 January 2019|work=How-To Geek website|publisher=How-To Geek LLC|format=|doi=|accessdate=23 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190124041504/https://www.howtogeek.com/340002/what-is-5g-and-how-fast-will-it-be/|archive-date=January 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, created and revised by the 3GPP.

The 1914.1 standards focus on network architecture and dividing the connection between the RRU and BBU into two key sections. Radio Unit (RU) to the Distributor Unit (DU) being the NGFI-I (Next Generation Fronthaul Interface) and the DU to the Central Unit (CU) being the NGFI-II interface allowing a more diverse and cost-effective network. NGFI-I and NGFI-II have defined performance values which should be compiled to ensure different traffic types defined by the ITU are capable of being carried. 1914.3 standard is creating a new Ethernet frame format capable of carrying IQ data in a much more efficient way depending on the functional split utilized. This is based on the [[3GPP]] definition of functional splits.

This requires placing 5G base stations every few hundred meters in order to use higher frequency bands. Also, these higher frequency 5G signals cannot penetrate solid objects easily, such as cars, trees, and walls, because of the nature of these higher frequency electromagnetic waves. 5G cells can be deliberately designed to be as inconspicuous as possible, which finds applications in places like restaurants and shopping malls. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|title=5G speed vs 5G range-What is the value of 5G speed,5G range|website=rfwireless-world.com|access-date=April 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421224510/http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|archive-date=April 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ \n! colspan=2 | Cell types\n!

Small cells are critical to 5G networks, as 5G's radio waves can't travel long distances, because of 5G's higher frequencies.\n\n=== Beamforming ===\n{{main|Beamforming}}\nBeamforming, as the name suggests, is used to direct radio waves to a target. This is achieved by combining elements in an antenna array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. This improves signal quality and data transfer speeds. 5G uses beamforming due to the improved signal quality it provides. Beamforming can be accomplished using [[phased array]] antennas.\n\n=== Wifi-cellular convergence ===\nOne expected benefit of the transition to 5G is the convergence of multiple networking functions to achieve cost, power, and complexity reductions. LTE has targeted convergence with [[Wi-Fi]] band/technology via various efforts, such as [[License Assisted Access]] (LAA; 5G signal in unlicensed frequency bands that are also used by Wi-Fi) and [[LTE-WLAN Aggregation]] (LWA; convergence with Wi-Fi Radio), but the differing capabilities of cellular and Wi-Fi have limited the scope of convergence. However, significant improvement in cellular performance specifications in 5G, combined with migration from Distributed [[Radio access network|Radio Access Network]] (D-RAN) to Cloud- or Centralized-RAN ([[C-RAN]]) and rollout of cellular [[small cell]]s can potentially narrow the gap between Wi-Fi and cellular networks in dense and indoor deployments. Radio convergence could result in sharing ranging from the aggregation of cellular and Wi-Fi channels to the use of a single silicon device for multiple radio access technologies.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) ===\n{{main|NOMA (5G)}}\nNOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) is a proposed multiple-access technique for future cellular systems via allocation of power.\n\n=== SDN/NFV ===\n{{main|Software-defined networking|SD-WAN|Network function virtualization|5G network slicing}}\nInitially, cellular mobile communications technologies were designed in the context of providing voice services and Internet access.

This was done by initiating and addressing work in relevant global fora (e.g. ITU-R), as well as in national and regional regulatory bodies.<ref name=\"METIS presentation\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|title=METIS projet presentation|date=November 2012|access-date=2014-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222211609/https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|archive-date=2014-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Also in November 2012, the iJOIN EU project was launched, focusing on \"[[small cell]]\" technology, which is of key importance for taking advantage of limited and strategic resources, such as the [[radio wave]] [[spectrum]].

Large scale adoption began in 2019 and today virtually every telecommunication service provider in the developed world is upgrading its infrastructure to offer 5G functionality. \n\nThe [[Electromagnetic spectrum|frequency spectrum]] of 5G is divided into millimeter waves, mid-band, and low-band. Low-band uses a similar frequency range as the predecessor, [[4G]]. 5G millimeter wave is the fastest, with actual speeds often being 1\u20132 Gbit/s down. Frequencies are above 24&nbsp;GHz reaching up to 72&nbsp;GHz which is above the [[extremely high frequency]] band's lower boundary. The reach is short, so more cells are required. Millimeter waves have difficulty traversing many walls and windows, so indoor coverage is limited.\n\n5G mid-band is the most widely deployed, in over 30 networks. Speeds in a 100&nbsp;MHz wide band are usually 100\u2013400 Mbit/s down. In the lab and occasionally in the field, speeds can go over a gigabit per second. Frequencies deployed are from 2.4&nbsp;GHz to 4.2&nbsp;GHz. [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] and [[China Mobile]] are using 2.5&nbsp;GHz, while others are mostly between 3.3 and 4.2&nbsp;GHz.  Many areas can be covered simply by upgrading existing towers, which lowers the cost.  Mid-band networks have better reach, bringing the cost close to the cost of 4G.\n\n5G low-band offers similar capacity to advanced 4G. \nIn the [[United States]], [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]] and [[AT&T Mobility|AT&T]] launched low-band services on the first week of December 2019. T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray warns that speeds on their 600&nbsp;MHz 5G may be as low as 25 Mbit/s down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov|title=FCC testimony Neville Ray|last=Ray|first=Neville|date=June 18, 2018|website=FCC.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> AT&T, using 850&nbsp;MHz, will also usually deliver less than 100 Mbit/s in 2019. The performance will improve, but cannot be significantly greater than robust 4G in the same spectrum.\n\n[[Verizon Wireless|Verizon]], AT&T, and almost all 5G providers in 2019 have latencies between 25\u201335 milliseconds. The \"air latency\" (between a phone and a tower) in 2019 equipment is 8\u201312 ms.

[[Analog signal]]s representing sounds and images are digitized in the telephone, converted by an [[analog to digital converter]] and transmitted as a stream of [[binary digit|bits]]. All the 5G wireless devices in a cell communicate by radio waves with a local [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] array and low power automated [[transceiver]] ([[transmitter]] and [[radio receiver|receiver]]) in the cell, over frequency channels assigned by the transceiver from a pool of frequencies that are reused in other cells. The local antennas are connected with the [[Public switched telephone network|telephone network]] and the [[Internet]] by a high bandwidth [[optical fiber]] or wireless [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul connection]]. As in other cell networks, a mobile device crossing from one cell to another is automatically \"[[Handover|handed off]]\" seamlessly to the new cell.\n\nVerizon and a few others are using [[millimeter wave]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Millimeter Wave Mobile Communications for 5G Cellular: It Will Work! |journal = IEEE Access |date = 2013-01-01 |issn = 2169-3536 |pages = 335\u2013349 |volume = 1 |doi = 10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2260813 |first = T.S. |last = Rappaport |first2 = Shu |last2 = Sun |first3 = R. |last3 = Mayzus |first4 = Hang |last4 = Zhao |first5 = Y. |last5 = Azar |first6 = K. |last6 = Wang |first7 = G.N. |last7 = Wong |first8 = J.K. |last8 = Schulz |first9 = M. |last9 = Samimi}}</ref> Millimeter waves have shorter range than [[microwave]]s, therefore the cells are limited to smaller size.

Some are only a few inches (several centimeters) long. \n\nMassive MIMO ([[multiple-input multiple-output]]), was deployed in 4G as early as 2016. Massive MIMO, typically uses 32 to 128 small antennas at each cell.

Small cells are critical to 5G networks, as 5G's radio waves can't travel long distances, because of 5G's higher frequencies.\n\n=== Beamforming ===\n{{main|Beamforming}}\nBeamforming, as the name suggests, is used to direct radio waves to a target. This is achieved by combining elements in an antenna array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. This improves signal quality and data transfer speeds. 5G uses beamforming due to the improved signal quality it provides. Beamforming can be accomplished using [[phased array]] antennas.\n\n=== Wifi-cellular convergence ===\nOne expected benefit of the transition to 5G is the convergence of multiple networking functions to achieve cost, power, and complexity reductions. LTE has targeted convergence with [[Wi-Fi]] band/technology via various efforts, such as [[License Assisted Access]] (LAA; 5G signal in unlicensed frequency bands that are also used by Wi-Fi) and [[LTE-WLAN Aggregation]] (LWA; convergence with Wi-Fi Radio), but the differing capabilities of cellular and Wi-Fi have limited the scope of convergence. However, significant improvement in cellular performance specifications in 5G, combined with migration from Distributed [[Radio access network|Radio Access Network]] (D-RAN) to Cloud- or Centralized-RAN ([[C-RAN]]) and rollout of cellular [[small cell]]s can potentially narrow the gap between Wi-Fi and cellular networks in dense and indoor deployments. Radio convergence could result in sharing ranging from the aggregation of cellular and Wi-Fi channels to the use of a single silicon device for multiple radio access technologies.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) ===\n{{main|NOMA (5G)}}\nNOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) is a proposed multiple-access technique for future cellular systems via allocation of power.\n\n=== SDN/NFV ===\n{{main|Software-defined networking|SD-WAN|Network function virtualization|5G network slicing}}\nInitially, cellular mobile communications technologies were designed in the context of providing voice services and Internet access.

When two particles approach each other, electrostatic repulsion increases and the interference between their electrical [[Double layer (surface science)|double layers]] increases.

At a distance of two Debye screening lengths the electrical potential energy is reduced to 2 percent of the value at the surface wall.\n\n: <math>\\kappa = \\sqrt{\\sum_i \\frac{\\rho_{\\infty i} e^2z^2_i}{\\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0 k_{\\rm B} T}}</math>\n\nwith unit of ''m''<sup>&minus;1</sup>\nwhere\n*<math>\\rho_{\\infty i}</math> is the number density of ion i in the bulk solution.\n*''z'' is the valency of the ion.  For example, H<sup>+</sup> has a valency of +1 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> has a valency of +2.\n*<math>\\varepsilon_0</math> is the [[vacuum permittivity]], <math>\\epsilon_r</math> is the [[relative static permittivity]].\n*''k''<sub>B</sub> is the [[Boltzmann constant]].\n\nThe repulsive free energy per unit area between two planar surfaces is shown as\n\n: <math>W = \\frac{64k_{\\rm B} T\\rho_{\\infty } \\gamma ^2}{\\kappa}e^{-\\kappa D}</math>\n\nwhere\n*<math>\\gamma</math> is the reduced surface potential\n<math>\\gamma =\\tanh\\left(\\frac{ze\\psi_0}{4k_{\\rm B}T}\\right)</math>\n*<math>\\psi_0</math> is the potential on the surface.\n\nThe interaction free energy between two spheres of radius R is\n\n: <math>W = \\frac{64\\pi k_{\\rm B} TR\\rho_{\\infty} \\gamma ^2}{\\kappa ^2}e^{-\\kappa D} \n</math><ref>\n{{Citation\n | last1=Bhattacharjee\n | first1=S.\n | last2=Elimelech\n | first2=M.\n | last3=Borkovec\n | first3=Michal\n | year=1998\n | title=DLVO interaction between colloidal particles: Beyond Derjaguins approximation\n | journal=Croatica Chimca Acta\n | volume=71\n | pages=883\u2013903\n}}.\n</ref>\n\nCombining the van der Waals interaction energy and the double layer interaction energy, the interaction between two particles or two surfaces in a liquid can be expressed as:\n\n: <math>W\\left(D\\right) = W(D)_A + W(D)_R \\, </math>\n\nwhere ''W(D)<sub>R</sub>'' is the repulsive interaction energy due to electric repulsion and ''W(D)<sub>A</sub>'' is the attractive interaction energy due to van der Waals interaction.\n\n==Application==\nSince the 1940s, the DLVO theory has been used to explain phenomena found in colloidal science, adsorption and many other fields. Due to the more recent popularity of nanoparticle research, DLVO theory has become even more popular because it can be used to explain behavior of both material nanoparticles such as [[fullerene]] particles and [[Bacterial adhesion in aquatic system|microorganisms]].\n\n==Shortcomings==\nAdditional forces beyond the DLVO construct have been reported to also play a major role in determining colloid stability.<ref>\nGrasso, D., Subramaniam, K., Butkus,M., K Strevett, Bergendahl, J.\n\"A review of non-DLVO interactions in environmental colloidal systems,\"\n''Reviews in Environmental Science and Biotechnology'' 1 (1), 17\u201338\n</ref>\nDLVO theory is not effective in describing ordering processes such as the evolution of [[colloidal crystal]]s in dilute dispersions with low salt concentrations. It also can not explain the relation between the formation of colloidal crystals and salt concentrations.<ref>\nN. Ise and I. S.

Paci Dal\u00f2 created the sculpture \"Sun Tzu\" under invitation of the Galleria Civica di Modena (2010) and the work \"Smallville#1\" as part of the Bologna Art First 2011. In 2011 he presented the music-theatre work ''De bello Gallico - Enklave Rimini''.\n\nIn 2012 he creates in Shanghai the audio-visual performance ''Ye Shanghai''; the project deals with several aspects of the Shanghainese life before 1949. At the core of this work is the story of the [[Shanghai Ghetto]], an area of approximately one square mile located in the Hongkou District of Japanese-occupied Shanghai. It housed about 23,000 Jewish refugees relocated by the Japanese-issued Proclamation Concerning Restriction of Residence and Business of Stateless Refugees, after they fled from the German-occupied Europe before and during World War II.\nHe produced a series of [[Berlin]] projects based on [[Heiner M\u00fcller]]'s texts: ''Greuelm\u00e4rchen'' - sound/video installation (Internationale Heiner M\u00fcller Gesellschaft, Berlin), ''Schwarzes Licht'', ''Roter Schnee''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://giardini.sm/greuelmaerchen|title=GREUELMAERCHEN|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nHe collaborates with a number of institutions and research centres including the [[Joint Research Centre]] of the  [[European Commission]], the University of the Republic of San Marino, [[University of Bologna]], IULM University Milan, University of Newcastle Culture Lab (UK), Domus Academy Milan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.domusacademy.it|title=Domus Academy|author=Domus Academy|work=Domus Academy}}</ref> [[Brera Academy|Brera]] Fine Arts Academy Milan, Ascoli Piceno and [[Rome]] universities, and [[Great Northern Way Campus]], where he develops projects between technology, art, and the urban space in collaboration with designers, architects, city planners, artists, programmers, theoreticians and hackers. \nHe is member of the Internationale [[Heiner M\u00fcller]] Gesellschaft Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ihmg.de/de/gesellschaft/mitglieder|title=Internationale Heiner M\u00fcller Gesellschaft - Gesellschaft - Mitglieder|publisher=}}</ref> He is artist-in-residence at Djerassi Foundation ([[San Francisco]]), [[STEIM]] ([[Amsterdam]]), Ars Electronica FutureLab (Linz), Mont\u00e9vid\u00e9o and GMEM ([[Marseille]]), La Bellone (Bruxelles), Western Front ([[Vancouver]]), Tonspur / MuseumsQuartier ([[Vienna]]).\n\n== Works ==\nRoberto Paci Dal\u00f2 has developed a multi-layered language out of his background in sound and visual arts, which combines the spoken language with body and architecture. His work uses new technologies in combination with an analysis on classical tragic drama. The areas of work of Roberto Paci Dal\u00f2 includes [[robotics]], [[cybernetics]], man-machine interaction, [[psychoacoustics]], realtime video and sound processing. He wrote, composed and directed since 1985 about 30 music-theatre works presented worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.giardini.sm/theatre.htm|title=spettacoli / performing arts|publisher=}}</ref> He composed music for acoustical ensembles, electronics, voices and a large number of radioworks produced by European broadcasting corporations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.giardini.sm/oradio.htm|title=Opere radiofoniche, Radioworks, H\u00f6rspiele, and Telematic Radio Projects|publisher=}}</ref> His production of films and videos is regularly presented in international festivals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.giardini.sm/cinema|title=ROBERTO PACI DAL\u00d2 : FILMS & DOCUMENTARIES|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2327955/bio Roberto Paci Dal\u00f2 - Biography<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> His dramaturgical materials are frequently re-composed in sound and video installations \u2013 often site specific and interactive \u2013 presented in museums, galleries, and the public space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.giardini.sm/installa.htm|title=roberto paci dal\u00f2 --- shows & installations 1982-2006|publisher=}}</ref> As performer he developed extended techniques on the [[clarinet]] and with electronics and [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]]. \nHis performances range from solo to electro-acoustical ensembles and improvised music projects in collaboration with other artists. His interest in traditional cultures brought him into explorations and field researches through the Mediterranean, Eastern Europe, Balkans and the North West European islands. He works on expansions of radio language(s) especially through his long term collaboration with ORF Kunstradio.<ref>[http://kunstradio.at/BIOS/pacidalobio.html Biography of Roberto Paci Dal\u00f2 on Kunstradio]</ref> Among his on-site/on-air/on-line projects: La Natura Ama Nascondersi (Kunstradio 1992), Napoli (Nantes 1994, official selection Prix Italia), La lunga notte (1993, award EBU/UER), Lost Memories (Graz 1994, official selection Prix Futura), Many Many Voices (Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Berlino 1995, CD Edel Records / Akademie der K\u00fcnste Berlin), Fuori Luogo (commissioned by SFB Sender Freies Berlin for the Prix Europa 98 opening), OZ (SFB / Sonambiente 1996), Italia anno zero (2005), L'assedio delle ceneri (RAI, 2008).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://italiaannozero.org|title=Notizie Sport, Turismo ed altro!|publisher=}}</ref> \nUrban explorations is a fundamental aspect of his work. He collects ''soundscapes'' since the beginning of the 80's. His interest in urban spaces brought him to the creation of a corpus of sound and visual work based on this research. Some of this activity is documented on-line in the permanent website Atlas Linz (since 1998) created in collaboration with the [[Ars Electronica Center]] [[Linz]]. The site is conceived as an open net space devoted to urban explorations and interventions.<ref>http://www.aec.at/residence/atlas</ref> He develops interfaces and software/hardware in different research centres & foundations.\n\n=== Curatorial work ===\nHe founded in 1985 the performing arts ensemble ''Giardini Pensili'' with Isabella Bordoni<ref>''The New Music Theater : Seeing the Voice, Hearing the Body: Seeing the Voice, Hearing the Body'', Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 199.</ref><ref>Judy Malloy, ''Women, Art, and Technology'', MIT Press, 2003, p. 66.</ref>.

Large scale adoption began in 2019 and today virtually every telecommunication service provider in the developed world is upgrading its infrastructure to offer 5G functionality. \n\nThe [[Electromagnetic spectrum|frequency spectrum]] of 5G is divided into millimeter waves, mid-band, and low-band. Low-band uses a similar frequency range as the predecessor, [[4G]]. 5G millimeter wave is the fastest, with actual speeds often being 1\u20132 Gbit/s down. Frequencies are above 24&nbsp;GHz reaching up to 72&nbsp;GHz which is above the [[extremely high frequency]] band's lower boundary. The reach is short, so more cells are required. Millimeter waves have difficulty traversing many walls and windows, so indoor coverage is limited.\n\n5G mid-band is the most widely deployed, in over 30 networks. Speeds in a 100&nbsp;MHz wide band are usually 100\u2013400 Mbit/s down. In the lab and occasionally in the field, speeds can go over a gigabit per second. Frequencies deployed are from 2.4&nbsp;GHz to 4.2&nbsp;GHz. [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] and [[China Mobile]] are using 2.5&nbsp;GHz, while others are mostly between 3.3 and 4.2&nbsp;GHz.  Many areas can be covered simply by upgrading existing towers, which lowers the cost.  Mid-band networks have better reach, bringing the cost close to the cost of 4G.\n\n5G low-band offers similar capacity to advanced 4G. \nIn the [[United States]], [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]] and [[AT&T Mobility|AT&T]] launched low-band services on the first week of December 2019. T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray warns that speeds on their 600&nbsp;MHz 5G may be as low as 25 Mbit/s down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov|title=FCC testimony Neville Ray|last=Ray|first=Neville|date=June 18, 2018|website=FCC.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> AT&T, using 850&nbsp;MHz, will also usually deliver less than 100 Mbit/s in 2019. The performance will improve, but cannot be significantly greater than robust 4G in the same spectrum.\n\n[[Verizon Wireless|Verizon]], AT&T, and almost all 5G providers in 2019 have latencies between 25\u201335 milliseconds. The \"air latency\" (between a phone and a tower) in 2019 equipment is 8\u201312 ms. The latency to the server, farther back in the network, raise the average to ~30 ms, 25\u201340% lower than typical 4G deployed. Adding \"Edge Servers\" close to the towers can bring latency down to 10\u201320 ms. Lower latency, such as the often touted 1 ms, is years away and does not include the time to the server.\n\nThe industry project [[3GPP]] defines any system using \"[[5G NR]]\" (5G New Radio) software as, \"5G\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2017/08/02/understanding-3gpp-starting-basics|title=Understanding 3GPP \u2013 starting with the basics|date=2017-08-01|website=Qualcomm|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> a definition that came into general use by late 2018. Previously, some reserved the term 5G for systems that deliver download speeds of 20&nbsp;GHz shared called for by [[ITU]] [[IMT-2020]]. 3GPP will submit their 5G NR to the ITU.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1901-imt2020_news|title=Preparing the ground for IMT-2020|publisher=www.3gpp.org|access-date=2019-04-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190414233657/https://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1901-imt2020_news|archive-date=April 14, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition to traditional mobile operator services, 5G NR also addresses specific requirements for private mobile networks ranging from industrial [[Internet of things|IoT]] to critical communications.\n\n==Overview==\n5G networks are [[digital signal|digital]] [[cellular network]]s, in which the service area covered by providers is divided into small geographical areas called ''cells''. [[Analog signal]]s representing sounds and images are digitized in the telephone, converted by an [[analog to digital converter]] and transmitted as a stream of [[binary digit|bits]]. All the 5G wireless devices in a cell communicate by radio waves with a local [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] array and low power automated [[transceiver]] ([[transmitter]] and [[radio receiver|receiver]]) in the cell, over frequency channels assigned by the transceiver from a pool of frequencies that are reused in other cells. The local antennas are connected with the [[Public switched telephone network|telephone network]] and the [[Internet]] by a high bandwidth [[optical fiber]] or wireless [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul connection]]. As in other cell networks, a mobile device crossing from one cell to another is automatically \"[[Handover|handed off]]\" seamlessly to the new cell.\n\nVerizon and a few others are using [[millimeter wave]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Millimeter Wave Mobile Communications for 5G Cellular: It Will Work! |journal = IEEE Access |date = 2013-01-01 |issn = 2169-3536 |pages = 335\u2013349 |volume = 1 |doi = 10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2260813 |first = T.S. |last = Rappaport |first2 = Shu |last2 = Sun |first3 = R. |last3 = Mayzus |first4 = Hang |last4 = Zhao |first5 = Y. |last5 = Azar |first6 = K. |last6 = Wang |first7 = G.N. |last7 = Wong |first8 = J.K. |last8 = Schulz |first9 = M. |last9 = Samimi}}</ref> Millimeter waves have shorter range than [[microwave]]s, therefore the cells are limited to smaller size.

Some are only a few inches (several centimeters) long. \n\nMassive MIMO ([[multiple-input multiple-output]]), was deployed in 4G as early as 2016. Massive MIMO, typically uses 32 to 128 small antennas at each cell. In the right frequencies and configuration, it can increase performance from 4 to 10 times<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wirelessone.news/9-mimo/687-china-mobile-softbank-ordering-1-000-s-of-massive-mimo-bases-2|title=\"I am crazy about Massive MIMO,\" Kitihara of Softbank ordering 1,000's of Massive MIMO bases|website=wirelessone.news|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>.  Multiple [[bitstream]]s of data are transmitted simultaneously. In a technique called ''[[beamforming]]'', the base station computer will continuously calculate the best route for radio waves to reach each wireless device, and will organize multiple antennas to work together as [[phased array]]s to create beams of millimeter waves to reach the device.<ref name=\"Nordrum\" /><ref name=\"Hoffman\">{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/340002/what-is-5g-and-how-fast-will-it-be/|title=What is 5G, and how fast will it be?|last=Hoffman|first=Chris|date=7 January 2019|work=How-To Geek website|publisher=How-To Geek LLC|format=|doi=|accessdate=23 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190124041504/https://www.howtogeek.com/340002/what-is-5g-and-how-fast-will-it-be/|archive-date=January 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, created and revised by the 3GPP.

Small cells are critical to 5G networks, as 5G's radio waves can't travel long distances, because of 5G's higher frequencies.\n\n=== Beamforming ===\n{{main|Beamforming}}\nBeamforming, as the name suggests, is used to direct radio waves to a target. This is achieved by combining elements in an antenna array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. This improves signal quality and data transfer speeds. 5G uses beamforming due to the improved signal quality it provides. Beamforming can be accomplished using [[phased array]] antennas.\n\n=== Wifi-cellular convergence ===\nOne expected benefit of the transition to 5G is the convergence of multiple networking functions to achieve cost, power, and complexity reductions. LTE has targeted convergence with [[Wi-Fi]] band/technology via various efforts, such as [[License Assisted Access]] (LAA; 5G signal in unlicensed frequency bands that are also used by Wi-Fi) and [[LTE-WLAN Aggregation]] (LWA; convergence with Wi-Fi Radio), but the differing capabilities of cellular and Wi-Fi have limited the scope of convergence. However, significant improvement in cellular performance specifications in 5G, combined with migration from Distributed [[Radio access network|Radio Access Network]] (D-RAN) to Cloud- or Centralized-RAN ([[C-RAN]]) and rollout of cellular [[small cell]]s can potentially narrow the gap between Wi-Fi and cellular networks in dense and indoor deployments. Radio convergence could result in sharing ranging from the aggregation of cellular and Wi-Fi channels to the use of a single silicon device for multiple radio access technologies.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) ===\n{{main|NOMA (5G)}}\nNOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) is a proposed multiple-access technique for future cellular systems via allocation of power.\n\n=== SDN/NFV ===\n{{main|Software-defined networking|SD-WAN|Network function virtualization|5G network slicing}}\nInitially, cellular mobile communications technologies were designed in the context of providing voice services and Internet access.

This was done by initiating and addressing work in relevant global fora (e.g. ITU-R), as well as in national and regional regulatory bodies.<ref name=\"METIS presentation\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|title=METIS projet presentation|date=November 2012|access-date=2014-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222211609/https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|archive-date=2014-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Also in November 2012, the iJOIN EU project was launched, focusing on \"[[small cell]]\" technology, which is of key importance for taking advantage of limited and strategic resources, such as the [[radio wave]] [[spectrum]].

Large scale adoption began in 2019 and today virtually every telecommunication service provider in the developed world is upgrading its infrastructure to offer 5G functionality. \n\nThe [[Electromagnetic spectrum|frequency spectrum]] of 5G is divided into millimeter waves, mid-band, and low-band. Low-band uses a similar frequency range as the predecessor, [[4G]]. 5G millimeter wave is the fastest, with actual speeds often being 1\u20132 Gbit/s down. Frequencies are above 24&nbsp;GHz reaching up to 72&nbsp;GHz which is above the [[extremely high frequency]] band's lower boundary. The reach is short, so more cells are required. Millimeter waves have difficulty traversing many walls and windows, so indoor coverage is limited.\n\n5G mid-band is the most widely deployed, in over 30 networks. Speeds in a 100&nbsp;MHz wide band are usually 100\u2013400 Mbit/s down. In the lab and occasionally in the field, speeds can go over a gigabit per second. Frequencies deployed are from 2.4&nbsp;GHz to 4.2&nbsp;GHz. [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] and [[China Mobile]] are using 2.5&nbsp;GHz, while others are mostly between 3.3 and 4.2&nbsp;GHz.  Many areas can be covered simply by upgrading existing towers, which lowers the cost.  Mid-band networks have better reach, bringing the cost close to the cost of 4G.\n\n5G low-band offers similar capacity to advanced 4G. \nIn the [[United States]], [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]] and [[AT&T Mobility|AT&T]] launched low-band services on the first week of December 2019. T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray warns that speeds on their 600&nbsp;MHz 5G may be as low as 25 Mbit/s down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov|title=FCC testimony Neville Ray|last=Ray|first=Neville|date=June 18, 2018|website=FCC.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> AT&T, using 850&nbsp;MHz, will also usually deliver less than 100 Mbit/s in 2019. The performance will improve, but cannot be significantly greater than robust 4G in the same spectrum.\n\n[[Verizon Wireless|Verizon]], AT&T, and almost all 5G providers in 2019 have latencies between 25\u201335 milliseconds. The \"air latency\" (between a phone and a tower) in 2019 equipment is 8\u201312 ms.

[[Analog signal]]s representing sounds and images are digitized in the telephone, converted by an [[analog to digital converter]] and transmitted as a stream of [[binary digit|bits]]. All the 5G wireless devices in a cell communicate by radio waves with a local [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] array and low power automated [[transceiver]] ([[transmitter]] and [[radio receiver|receiver]]) in the cell, over frequency channels assigned by the transceiver from a pool of frequencies that are reused in other cells. The local antennas are connected with the [[Public switched telephone network|telephone network]] and the [[Internet]] by a high bandwidth [[optical fiber]] or wireless [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul connection]]. As in other cell networks, a mobile device crossing from one cell to another is automatically \"[[Handover|handed off]]\" seamlessly to the new cell.\n\nVerizon and a few others are using [[millimeter wave]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Millimeter Wave Mobile Communications for 5G Cellular: It Will Work! |journal = IEEE Access |date = 2013-01-01 |issn = 2169-3536 |pages = 335\u2013349 |volume = 1 |doi = 10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2260813 |first = T.S. |last = Rappaport |first2 = Shu |last2 = Sun |first3 = R. |last3 = Mayzus |first4 = Hang |last4 = Zhao |first5 = Y. |last5 = Azar |first6 = K. |last6 = Wang |first7 = G.N. |last7 = Wong |first8 = J.K. |last8 = Schulz |first9 = M. |last9 = Samimi}}</ref> Millimeter waves have shorter range than [[microwave]]s, therefore the cells are limited to smaller size.

Some are only a few inches (several centimeters) long. \n\nMassive MIMO ([[multiple-input multiple-output]]), was deployed in 4G as early as 2016. Massive MIMO, typically uses 32 to 128 small antennas at each cell.

Small cells are critical to 5G networks, as 5G's radio waves can't travel long distances, because of 5G's higher frequencies.\n\n=== Beamforming ===\n{{main|Beamforming}}\nBeamforming, as the name suggests, is used to direct radio waves to a target. This is achieved by combining elements in an antenna array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. This improves signal quality and data transfer speeds. 5G uses beamforming due to the improved signal quality it provides. Beamforming can be accomplished using [[phased array]] antennas.\n\n=== Wifi-cellular convergence ===\nOne expected benefit of the transition to 5G is the convergence of multiple networking functions to achieve cost, power, and complexity reductions. LTE has targeted convergence with [[Wi-Fi]] band/technology via various efforts, such as [[License Assisted Access]] (LAA; 5G signal in unlicensed frequency bands that are also used by Wi-Fi) and [[LTE-WLAN Aggregation]] (LWA; convergence with Wi-Fi Radio), but the differing capabilities of cellular and Wi-Fi have limited the scope of convergence. However, significant improvement in cellular performance specifications in 5G, combined with migration from Distributed [[Radio access network|Radio Access Network]] (D-RAN) to Cloud- or Centralized-RAN ([[C-RAN]]) and rollout of cellular [[small cell]]s can potentially narrow the gap between Wi-Fi and cellular networks in dense and indoor deployments. Radio convergence could result in sharing ranging from the aggregation of cellular and Wi-Fi channels to the use of a single silicon device for multiple radio access technologies.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) ===\n{{main|NOMA (5G)}}\nNOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) is a proposed multiple-access technique for future cellular systems via allocation of power.\n\n=== SDN/NFV ===\n{{main|Software-defined networking|SD-WAN|Network function virtualization|5G network slicing}}\nInitially, cellular mobile communications technologies were designed in the context of providing voice services and Internet access.

It is claimed that such branding is a marketing move that will cause confusion with consumers, as it is not made clear that such improvements are not true 5G.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theverge.com/2017/4/25/15425414/att-5g-evolution-network-lte-advanced-misleading-marketing|title=AT&T announces it will build a fake 5G network|date=2017-04-25|access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121215106/https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15425414/att-5g-evolution-network-lte-advanced-misleading-marketing|archive-date=November 21, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Update section|date=April 2019}}\n* In April 2008, NASA partnered with Geoff Brown and [[M2Mi Corporation|Machine-to-Machine Intelligence (M2Mi) Corp]] to develop 5G communications technology.<ref name=\"NASA Ames Partners with M2Mi for small satellite development\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/apr/HQ_08107_Ames_nanosat.html|title=NASA \u2013 NASA Ames Partners With M2MI For Small Satellite Development|last=jim|website=nasa.gov|access-date=April 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190408142034/https://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/apr/HQ_08107_Ames_nanosat.html|archive-date=April 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* In 2008, the South Korean IT R&D program of \"5G mobile communication systems based on beam-division multiple access and relays with group cooperation\" was formed.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n* In August 2012, New York University founded [[NYU Wireless|NYU WIRELESS]], a multi-disciplinary academic research centre that has conducted pioneering work in 5G wireless communications.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nyuwireless.com/ |title=The world's first academic research center combining Wireless, Computing, and Medical Applications |publisher=Nyu Wireless |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2016-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311171645/http://nyuwireless.com/ |archive-date=March 11, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/special-reports/nyu-wireless-rappaport-envisions-5g-millimeter-wave-future |title=NYU Wireless' Rappaport envisions a 5G, millimeter-wave future \u2013 FierceWirelessTech |publisher=Fiercewireless.com |date=2014-01-13 |accessdate=2016-01-14 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230738/http://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/special-reports/nyu-wireless-rappaport-envisions-5g-millimeter-wave-future |archivedate=2016-03-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Alleven |first=Monica |url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/story/nyu-wireless-says-us-falling-behind-5g-presses-fcc-act-now-mmwave-spectrum/2015-01-14 |title=NYU Wireless says U.S. falling behind in 5G, presses FCC to act now on mmWave spectrum |publisher=Fiercewireless.com |date=2015-01-14 |accessdate=2016-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060627/http://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/story/nyu-wireless-says-us-falling-behind-5g-presses-fcc-act-now-mmwave-spectrum/2015-01-14 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* On 8 October 2012, the UK's [[University of Surrey]] secured \u00a335M for a new 5G research centre, jointly funded by the British government's UK Research Partnership Investment Fund (UKRPIF) and a consortium of key international mobile operators and infrastructure providers, including [[Huawei]], [[Samsung]], [[Telefonica]] Europe, [[Fujitsu]] Laboratories Europe, [[Rohde & Schwarz]], and [[Aircom International]].

{"title_page": "Centrifuge casting", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Underlinked|date=October 2019}}\n{{Orphan|date=October 2019}}\n}}\n\n'''Centrifugal casting''', also commonly known as '''spin casting''' is typically used for industrial manufacturing of cast parts. It was the work of A. G. Eckhardt in 1809 to develop a [[patent]] showing the basic principles involved with the process.<ref>http://www.metalwebnews.com/howto/casting/casting.pdf</ref> Centrifugal casting is one of the few [[casting]] processes that can be used both to manufacture [[Metal|metals]] as well as plastic parts. Parts ranging from belt buckles, medallions, figurines, and [[Souvenir|souvenirs]] to \"pot metal\" gears and machine parts, bushings, and concrete expansion fasteners are usually manufactured using this process.<ref>http://www.castcraft.com/centrif.htm</ref> [[Spin casting]] or centrifugal casting is considered to be a relatively inexpensive process ranging to a total cost of no more than a $20,000 investment requirement, in comparison to a process such as [[investment casting|investment molding]] that costs a lot more (usually millions). Centrifugal casting is a popular process for the [[petrochemical]] market, defense market, and virtually any other market who needs good quality products at a low manufacturing cost.<ref>http://www.appliancedesign.com/articles/94272-centrifugal-casting</ref>\n\n== Process variants ==\nCentrifugal casting is a metal casting technique that uses the forces of [[Acceleration#Tangential and centripetal acceleration|centripetal acceleration]] to distribute the molten material in the [[mold (casting)|mold]].<ref>http://thelibraryofmanufacturing.com/semicentrifugal_casting.html</ref> Molten metal is typically fed into the mold using a spout. The process is then completed using rollers that rotate the mold about its axis causing the liquid metal to form to the mold and harden as the rotation continues.  Rotation speeds and pouring rates are specific to the material being used and the design specifications. The true centrifugal casting technique can be performed using both vertical as well as horizontal rotation. The vertical rotation technique is generally used for the smaller parts whereas the longer parts are formed using the horizontal technique.\n\n=== Horizontal ===\nThe horizontal method is utilized for castings that have a much larger length than diameter and a cylindrical bore in the center.<ref>https://centrifugalcastingmachineco.wordpress.com/2012/10/09/the-differences-between-horizontal-and-vertical-centrifugal-casting-machinery/</ref> Complex shapes are not obtainable through this process; however, this process is very useful for making things such as piping and tubing. The trouble with this process is the slip that occurs between the metal and the mold as the mold rotates, causing the metal to move slower than the mold.<ref>https://centrifugalcastingmachineco.wordpress.com/2012/10/09/the-differences-between-horizontal-and-vertical-centrifugal-casting-machinery/</ref>\n\n=== Vertical ===\nThis method is usually used to cast parts in which the diameter exceeds the length. Vertical casting can produce both cylindrical and non-cylindrical castings. These non-cylindrical castings include [[ball valve]] balls, [[Gear_manufacturing|gear blanks]], and conical shaped parts.

It was the work of A. G. Eckhardt in 1809 to develop a [[patent]] showing the basic principles involved with the process.<ref>http://www.metalwebnews.com/howto/casting/casting.pdf</ref> Centrifugal casting is one of the few [[casting]] processes that can be used both to manufacture [[Metal|metals]] as well as plastic parts. Parts ranging from belt buckles, medallions, figurines, and [[Souvenir|souvenirs]] to \"pot metal\" gears and machine parts, bushings, and concrete expansion fasteners are usually manufactured using this process.<ref>http://www.castcraft.com/centrif.htm</ref> [[Spin casting]] or centrifugal casting is considered to be a relatively inexpensive process ranging to a total cost of no more than a $20,000 investment requirement, in comparison to a process such as [[investment casting|investment molding]] that costs a lot more (usually millions). Centrifugal casting is a popular process for the [[petrochemical]] market, defense market, and virtually any other market who needs good quality products at a low manufacturing cost.<ref>http://www.appliancedesign.com/articles/94272-centrifugal-casting</ref>\n\n== Process variants ==\nCentrifugal casting is a metal casting technique that uses the forces of [[Acceleration#Tangential and centripetal acceleration|centripetal acceleration]] to distribute the molten material in the [[mold (casting)|mold]].<ref>http://thelibraryofmanufacturing.com/semicentrifugal_casting.html</ref> Molten metal is typically fed into the mold using a spout. The process is then completed using rollers that rotate the mold about its axis causing the liquid metal to form to the mold and harden as the rotation continues.  Rotation speeds and pouring rates are specific to the material being used and the design specifications. The true centrifugal casting technique can be performed using both vertical as well as horizontal rotation. The vertical rotation technique is generally used for the smaller parts whereas the longer parts are formed using the horizontal technique.\n\n=== Horizontal ===\nThe horizontal method is utilized for castings that have a much larger length than diameter and a cylindrical bore in the center.<ref>https://centrifugalcastingmachineco.wordpress.com/2012/10/09/the-differences-between-horizontal-and-vertical-centrifugal-casting-machinery/</ref> Complex shapes are not obtainable through this process; however, this process is very useful for making things such as piping and tubing. The trouble with this process is the slip that occurs between the metal and the mold as the mold rotates, causing the metal to move slower than the mold.<ref>https://centrifugalcastingmachineco.wordpress.com/2012/10/09/the-differences-between-horizontal-and-vertical-centrifugal-casting-machinery/</ref>\n\n=== Vertical ===\nThis method is usually used to cast parts in which the diameter exceeds the length. Vertical casting can produce both cylindrical and non-cylindrical castings. These non-cylindrical castings include [[ball valve]] balls, [[Gear_manufacturing|gear blanks]], and conical shaped parts. Unlike the horizontal method, no slip occurs between the metal and mold due to the constant resultant force applied during rotation.<ref>https://centrifugalcastingmachineco.wordpress.com/2012/10/09/the-differences-between-horizontal-and-vertical-centrifugal-casting-machinery/</ref>\n\n=== Semi-centrifugal ===\nSemi-centrifugal casting is a variant of centrifugal casting. The main difference being that the mold is completely filled during the process through the use of a central [[sprue (manufacturing)|sprue]].
