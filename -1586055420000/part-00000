The first Thunderbolt peripheral devices appeared in retail stores only in late 2011, with the relatively expensive ''Pegasus R4'' (4-drive) and ''Pegasus R6'' (6-drive) [[RAID]] enclosures by [[Promise Technology]] aimed at the [[prosumer]] and professional market, initially offering up to 12&nbsp;TB of storage, later increased to 18&nbsp;TB. Sales of these units were hurt by the [[2011 Thailand floods|2011 floods in Thailand]] (who manufacture much of the world's supply of hard-drives) resulting in a cut to worldwide hard-drive production and a subsequent driving-up of storage costs, hence the retail price of these Promise units increased in response, contributing to a slower take-up of the devices.\n\nIt also took some time for other storage manufacturers to release products: most were smaller devices aimed at the professional market, and focused on speed rather than high capacity. Many storage devices were under 1&nbsp;[[terabyte|TB]] in size, with some featuring SSDs for faster external-data access rather than standard hard-drives.\n\nOther companies have offered interface products that can route multiple older, usually slower, connections through a single Thunderbolt port. In July 2011, Apple released its [[Apple Thunderbolt Display]], whose [[gigabit Ethernet]] and other older connector types made it the first hub of its type. Later, companies such as [[Belkin]], [http://www.caldigit.com/us/ CalDigit], [[Other World Computing]], [[Matrox]], [[StarTech.com|StarTech]], and [[Elgato]] have all released Thunderbolt docks.\n\nAs of late 2012, few other storage devices offering double-digit [[terabyte|TB]] capacity had appeared. Exceptions included Sonnet Technologies' highly priced professional units, and [[Drobo]]'s 4- and 5-drive enclosures, the latter featuring their own [[Drobo#BeyondRAID|BeyondRAID]] proprietary data-handling system.\n\nBackwards compatibility with non-Thunderbolt-equipped computers was a problem, as most storage devices featured only two Thunderbolt ports, for daisy-chaining up to six devices from each one. In mid-2012, [[LaCie]], Drobo, and other device makers started to swap out one of the two Thunderbolt ports for a [[USB 3.0]] connection on some of their low-to-mid end products. Later models had the USB 3.0 added ''in addition'' to the two Thunderbolt ports, including those from LaCie on their ''2big'' range.\n\nThe late 2013 Retina MacBook Pro was the first product to have Thunderbolt 2 ports, following which manufacturers started to update their model offerings to those featuring the newer, faster, 20 Gbit/s connection throughout 2014. Again, among the first was Promise Technology, who released updated ''Pegasus 2'' versions of their R4 and R6 models along with an even larger R8 (8-drive) [[RAID]] unit, offering up to 32&nbsp;TBs of storage. Later, other brands similarly introduced high capacity models with the newer connection type, including G-Technology (with their ''G-RAID Studio'' models offering up to 24&nbsp;TB) and LaCie (with their ''5big'', and [[19-inch rack|rack mounted]] ''8big'' models, offering up to 48&nbsp;TB). LaCie also offering updated designed versions of their ''2big'' mainstream consumer models, up to 12&nbsp;TB, using new 6&nbsp;TB hard-drives.\n\nThunderbolt 3 was introduced in late 2015, with several motherboard manufacturers and [[OEM]] laptop manufacturers including Thunderbolt 3 with their products. [[Gigabyte Technology|Gigabyte]] and [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], large computer component manufacturers, enter the market for the first time with Thunderbolt 3 compatible components.<ref name=\"TPU TB3 info 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.techpowerup.com/215773/gigabyte-unveils-the-z170x-ud5-th-thunderbolt-3-certified-motherboard.html|title=Gigabyte Unveils the Z170X-UD5 TH Thunderbolt 3 Certified Motherboard|date=|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"PCW TB3 info 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2978318/laptop-computers/msi-embraces-skylake-and-thunderbolt-3-0-for-new-gaming-laptops.html|title=MSI embraces Skylake and Thunderbolt 3.0 for new gaming laptops|date=|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Dell]] was the first to include Thunderbolt 3 ports in laptops with their [[Dell XPS|XPS Series]] and their [[Dell Alienware]] range.<ref name=\"PCW TB3 info 2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2976593/laptop-computers/new-alienware-laptops-pack-thunderbolt-3-and-better-screens-but-oddly-lack-skylake.html|title=New Alienware laptops pack Thunderbolt 3 and prettier screens, but oddly lack Skylake|date=|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nApple Mac machines with Thunderbolt 3 include: [[iMac Pro]], [[iMac]] 2017, [[Mac Mini]] 2018, [[MacBook Pro]] 2016 onwards, [[MacBook Air]] 2018.\n\nAlthough Thunderbolt has initially had poor hardware support outside of Apple devices and has been relegated to a niche gadget port, the adoption of the Thunderbolt 3 using USB-C connector standard into a wide array of hardware bodes well for market acceptance of the standard, besides that it will become part of USB4 standard.\n\n===Vulnerability to DMA attacks===\n\nThunderbolt \u2014 like many high-speed expansion buses, including [[PCI Express]], [[PC Card]], [[ExpressCard]], [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]], [[Conventional PCI|PCI]], and [[PCI-X]] \u2014 is potentially vulnerable to a [[direct memory access]] (DMA) [[DMA attack|attack]]. If users extend the PCI Express bus (the most common high-speed expansion bus in systems {{as of | 2018| lc = on}}) with Thunderbolt, it allows very low-level access to the computer. An attacker could physically attach a malicious device, which, through its direct and unimpeded access to system memory and other devices, would be able to bypass almost all security measures of the operating system, allowing the attacker to read and write system memory, potentially exposing encryption keys or installing [[malware]].<ref name=\"erratasec\"/> Such attacks have been demonstrated, modifying inexpensive commodity Thunderbolt hardware.<ref name=\"funderbolt\"/> An [[Input\u2013output memory management unit|IOMMU]], if present, bug-free, and correctly integrated into and configured by the operating system, can close a computer's vulnerability to DMA attacks,<ref name=\"funderbolt\"/> but only if a malicious device can't alter the code that configures the IOMMU before the code is executed. As of 2019, the major OS vendors had not taken into account the variety of ways in which a malicious device could take advantage of complex interactions between multiple emulated peripherals, exposing subtle bugs and vulnerabilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/thunderclap-exploring-vulnerabilities-in-operating-system-iommu-protection-via-dma-from-untrustworthy-peripherals/|title=Thunderclap: Exploring Vulnerabilities in Operating System IOMMU Protection via DMA from Untrustworthy Peripherals \u2013 NDSS Symposium|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref> Some UEFI implementations offer Kernel DMA Protection.\n\nThis vulnerability is not present when Thunderbolt is used as a system interconnection ({{abbr|IPoTB|Internet Protocol over Thunderbolt Bridge}} supported on [[OS X Mavericks]]), because the [[Internet Protocol|IP]] implementation runs on the underlying Thunderbolt low-latency packet-switching fabric, and the PCI Express protocol is not present on the cable. That means that if IPoTB networking is used between a group of computers, there is no threat of such DMA attack between them.<ref name=\"erratasec\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.erratasec.com/2011/02/thunderbolt-introducing-new-way-to-hack.html|title=Thunderbolt: Introducing a new way to hack Macs|last=Graham|first=Robert|date=24 February 2011|website=Errata Security|accessdate=5 March 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"funderbolt\">{{cite conference |url=https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Sevinsky-Funderbolt-Adventures-in-Thunderbolt-DMA-Attacks-Slides.pdf|title=Funderbolt: Adventures in Thunderbolt DMA Attacks|first=Russ|last=Sevinsky |conference=Black Hat Briefings|conferenceurl=https://www.blackhat.com|location=Las Vegas |format=PDF |date=1 August 2013 |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name=\"TBHW\">{{cite web|url= https://thunderbolttechnology.net/tech/how-it-works|title=Thunderbolt how it works|publisher=Intel|date=2014|accessdate=1 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029185956/https://thunderbolttechnology.net/tech/how-it-works |archive-date=2014-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0HthE3qDMw|title=Black Hat USA 2013 - Funderbolt: Adventures in Thunderbolt DMA Attacks|first=Russ|last=Sevinsky|date=1 October 2013|accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Vulnerability to Option ROM attacks===\nWhen a system with Thunderbolt boots, it loads and executes [[Option ROM]]s from attached devices.

The first Thunderbolt peripheral devices appeared in retail stores only in late 2011, with the relatively expensive ''Pegasus R4'' (4-drive) and ''Pegasus R6'' (6-drive) [[RAID]] enclosures by [[Promise Technology]] aimed at the [[prosumer]] and professional market, initially offering up to 12&nbsp;TB of storage, later increased to 18&nbsp;TB. Sales of these units were hurt by the [[2011 Thailand floods|2011 floods in Thailand]] (who manufacture much of the world's supply of hard-drives) resulting in a cut to worldwide hard-drive production and a subsequent driving-up of storage costs, hence the retail price of these Promise units increased in response, contributing to a slower take-up of the devices.\n\nIt also took some time for other storage manufacturers to release products: most were smaller devices aimed at the professional market, and focused on speed rather than high capacity. Many storage devices were under 1&nbsp;[[terabyte|TB]] in size, with some featuring SSDs for faster external-data access rather than standard hard-drives.\n\nOther companies have offered interface products that can route multiple older, usually slower, connections through a single Thunderbolt port. In July 2011, Apple released its [[Apple Thunderbolt Display]], whose [[gigabit Ethernet]] and other older connector types made it the first hub of its type. Later, companies such as [[Belkin]], [http://www.caldigit.com/us/ CalDigit], [[Other World Computing]], [[Matrox]], [[StarTech.com|StarTech]], and [[Elgato]] have all released Thunderbolt docks.\n\nAs of late 2012, few other storage devices offering double-digit [[terabyte|TB]] capacity had appeared. Exceptions included Sonnet Technologies' highly priced professional units, and [[Drobo]]'s 4- and 5-drive enclosures, the latter featuring their own [[Drobo#BeyondRAID|BeyondRAID]] proprietary data-handling system.\n\nBackwards compatibility with non-Thunderbolt-equipped computers was a problem, as most storage devices featured only two Thunderbolt ports, for daisy-chaining up to six devices from each one. In mid-2012, [[LaCie]], Drobo, and other device makers started to swap out one of the two Thunderbolt ports for a [[USB 3.0]] connection on some of their low-to-mid end products. Later models had the USB 3.0 added ''in addition'' to the two Thunderbolt ports, including those from LaCie on their ''2big'' range.\n\nThe late 2013 Retina MacBook Pro was the first product to have Thunderbolt 2 ports, following which manufacturers started to update their model offerings to those featuring the newer, faster, 20 Gbit/s connection throughout 2014. Again, among the first was Promise Technology, who released updated ''Pegasus 2'' versions of their R4 and R6 models along with an even larger R8 (8-drive) [[RAID]] unit, offering up to 32&nbsp;TBs of storage. Later, other brands similarly introduced high capacity models with the newer connection type, including G-Technology (with their ''G-RAID Studio'' models offering up to 24&nbsp;TB) and LaCie (with their ''5big'', and [[19-inch rack|rack mounted]] ''8big'' models, offering up to 48&nbsp;TB). LaCie also offering updated designed versions of their ''2big'' mainstream consumer models, up to 12&nbsp;TB, using new 6&nbsp;TB hard-drives.\n\nThunderbolt 3 was introduced in late 2015, with several motherboard manufacturers and [[OEM]] laptop manufacturers including Thunderbolt 3 with their products. [[Gigabyte Technology|Gigabyte]] and [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], large computer component manufacturers, enter the market for the first time with Thunderbolt 3 compatible components.<ref name=\"TPU TB3 info 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.techpowerup.com/215773/gigabyte-unveils-the-z170x-ud5-th-thunderbolt-3-certified-motherboard.html|title=Gigabyte Unveils the Z170X-UD5 TH Thunderbolt 3 Certified Motherboard|date=|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"PCW TB3 info 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2978318/laptop-computers/msi-embraces-skylake-and-thunderbolt-3-0-for-new-gaming-laptops.html|title=MSI embraces Skylake and Thunderbolt 3.0 for new gaming laptops|date=|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Dell]] was the first to include Thunderbolt 3 ports in laptops with their [[Dell XPS|XPS Series]] and their [[Dell Alienware]] range.<ref name=\"PCW TB3 info 2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2976593/laptop-computers/new-alienware-laptops-pack-thunderbolt-3-and-better-screens-but-oddly-lack-skylake.html|title=New Alienware laptops pack Thunderbolt 3 and prettier screens, but oddly lack Skylake|date=|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nApple Mac machines with Thunderbolt 3 include: [[iMac Pro]], [[iMac]] 2017, [[Mac Mini]] 2018, [[MacBook Pro]] 2016 onwards, [[MacBook Air]] 2018.\n\nAlthough Thunderbolt has initially had poor hardware support outside of Apple devices and has been relegated to a niche gadget port, the adoption of the Thunderbolt 3 using USB-C connector standard into a wide array of hardware bodes well for market acceptance of the standard, besides that it will become part of USB4 standard.\n\n===Vulnerability to DMA attacks===\n\nThunderbolt \u2014 like many high-speed expansion buses, including [[PCI Express]], [[PC Card]], [[ExpressCard]], [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]], [[Conventional PCI|PCI]], and [[PCI-X]] \u2014 is potentially vulnerable to a [[direct memory access]] (DMA) [[DMA attack|attack]]. If users extend the PCI Express bus (the most common high-speed expansion bus in systems {{as of | 2018| lc = on}}) with Thunderbolt, it allows very low-level access to the computer. An attacker could physically attach a malicious device, which, through its direct and unimpeded access to system memory and other devices, would be able to bypass almost all security measures of the operating system, allowing the attacker to read and write system memory, potentially exposing encryption keys or installing [[malware]].<ref name=\"erratasec\"/> Such attacks have been demonstrated, modifying inexpensive commodity Thunderbolt hardware.<ref name=\"funderbolt\"/> An [[Input\u2013output memory management unit|IOMMU]], if present, bug-free, and correctly integrated into and configured by the operating system, can close a computer's vulnerability to DMA attacks,<ref name=\"funderbolt\"/> but only if a malicious device can't alter the code that configures the IOMMU before the code is executed. As of 2019, the major OS vendors had not taken into account the variety of ways in which a malicious device could take advantage of complex interactions between multiple emulated peripherals, exposing subtle bugs and vulnerabilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/thunderclap-exploring-vulnerabilities-in-operating-system-iommu-protection-via-dma-from-untrustworthy-peripherals/|title=Thunderclap: Exploring Vulnerabilities in Operating System IOMMU Protection via DMA from Untrustworthy Peripherals \u2013 NDSS Symposium|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref> Some UEFI implementations offer Kernel DMA Protection.\n\nThis vulnerability is not present when Thunderbolt is used as a system interconnection ({{abbr|IPoTB|Internet Protocol over Thunderbolt Bridge}} supported on [[OS X Mavericks]]), because the [[Internet Protocol|IP]] implementation runs on the underlying Thunderbolt low-latency packet-switching fabric, and the PCI Express protocol is not present on the cable.

These disturbances are sometimes strong enough to alter the trajectories of [[charged particle]]s in both solar wind and magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s, [[Electron precipitation|precipitate]] into the upper atmosphere ([[thermosphere]]/[[exosphere]]).\n\nThe resulting [[ionization]] and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying color and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles. Precipitating protons generally produce optical emissions as incident [[hydrogen]] atoms after gaining electrons from the atmosphere. Proton auroras are usually observed at lower latitudes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://auspace.athabascau.ca/handle/2149/518 |title=Simultaneous ground and satellite observations of an isolated proton arc at sub-auroral latitudes |publisher=Journal of Geophysical Research |date=2007 |accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"aurora\" is derived from the name of the Roman goddess of the dawn, [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]], who travelled from east to west announcing the coming of the sun.

The low number of oxygen atoms and their gradually diminishing concentration is responsible for the faint appearance of the top parts of the \"curtains\". Scarlet, crimson, and carmine are the most often-seen hues of red for the auroras.\n* '''Green''': At lower altitudes, the more frequent collisions suppress the 630-nm (red) mode: rather the 557.7&nbsp;nm emission (green) dominates. A fairly high concentration of atomic oxygen and higher eye sensitivity in green make green auroras the most common. The excited molecular nitrogen (atomic nitrogen being rare due to the high stability of the N<sub>2</sub> molecule) plays a role here, as it can transfer energy by collision to an oxygen atom, which then radiates it away at the green wavelength. (Red and green can also mix together to produce pink or yellow hues.) The rapid decrease of concentration of atomic oxygen below about 100&nbsp;km is responsible for the abrupt-looking end of the lower edges of the curtains. Both the 557.7 and 630.0&nbsp;nm wavelengths correspond to [[forbidden transition]]s of atomic oxygen, a slow mechanism responsible for the graduality (0.7&nbsp;s and 107&nbsp;s respectively) of flaring and fading.\n* '''Blue''': At yet lower altitudes, atomic oxygen is uncommon, and molecular nitrogen and ionized molecular nitrogen take over in producing visible light emission, radiating at a large number of wavelengths in both red and blue parts of the spectrum, with 428&nbsp;nm (blue) being dominant. Blue and purple emissions, typically at the lower edges of the \"curtains\", show up at the highest levels of solar activity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Windows to the Universe \u2013 Auroral colors and spectra|url=http://www.windows2universe.org/earth/Magnetosphere/tour/tour_earth_magnetosphere_09.html}}</ref> The molecular nitrogen transitions are much faster than the atomic oxygen ones.\n* '''Ultraviolet''': Ultraviolet radiation from auroras (within the optical window but not visible to virtually all humans) has been observed with the requisite equipment.

The varying intensity of the solar wind produces effects of different magnitudes but includes one or more of the following physical scenarios.\n# A quiescent solar wind flowing past the Earth's magnetosphere steadily interacts with it and can both inject solar wind particles directly onto the geomagnetic field lines that are 'open', as opposed to being 'closed' in the opposite hemisphere, and provide diffusion through the [[bow shock]]. It can also cause particles already trapped in the [[Van Allen radiation belt|radiation belts]] to precipitate into the atmosphere. Once particles are lost to the atmosphere from the radiation belts, under quiet conditions, new ones replace them only slowly, and the loss-cone becomes depleted. In the magnetotail, however, particle trajectories seem constantly to reshuffle, probably when the particles cross the very weak magnetic field near the equator. As a result, the flow of electrons in that region is nearly the same in all directions (\"isotropic\") and assures a steady supply of leaking electrons. The leakage of electrons does not leave the tail positively charged, because each leaked electron lost to the atmosphere is replaced by a low energy electron drawn upward from the [[ionosphere]]. Such replacement of \"hot\" electrons by \"cold\" ones is in complete accord with the [[2nd law of thermodynamics]]. The complete process, which also generates an electric ring current around the Earth, is uncertain.\n# Geomagnetic disturbance from an enhanced [[solar wind]] causes distortions of the [[magnetosphere|magnetotail]] (\"magnetic substorms\"). These 'substorms' tend to occur after prolonged spells(hours) during which the interplanetary magnetic field has had an appreciable southward component. This leads to a higher rate of interconnection between its field lines and those of Earth. As a result, the solar wind moves [[magnetic flux]] (tubes of magnetic field lines, 'locked' together with their resident plasma) from the day side of Earth to the magnetotail, widening the obstacle it presents to the solar wind flow and constricting the tail on the night-side. Ultimately some tail plasma can separate (\"[[magnetic reconnection]]\"); some blobs (\"[[plasmoid]]s\") are squeezed downstream and are carried away with the solar wind; others are squeezed toward Earth where their motion feeds strong outbursts of auroras, mainly around midnight (\"unloading process\"). A geomagnetic storm resulting from greater interaction adds many more particles to the plasma trapped around Earth, also producing enhancement of the \"ring current\". Occasionally the resulting modification of the Earth's magnetic field can be so strong that it produces auroras visible at middle latitudes, on field lines much closer to the equator than those of the auroral zone.\n#: [[File:Moon and Aurora.jpg|thumb|Moon and Aurora]]\n# Acceleration of auroral charged particles invariably accompanies a magnetospheric disturbance that causes an aurora. This mechanism, which is believed to predominantly arise from strong electric fields along the magnetic field or wave-particle interactions, raises the velocity of a particle in the direction of the guiding magnetic field. The pitch angle is thereby decreased and increases the chance of it being precipitated into the atmosphere. Both electromagnetic and electrostatic waves, produced at the time of greater geomagnetic disturbances, make a significant contribution to the energizing processes that sustain an aurora. Particle acceleration provides a complex intermediate process for transferring energy from the solar wind indirectly into the atmosphere.\n[[File:Aurora australis 20050911.jpg|right|thumb|Aurora australis (11 September 2005) as captured by NASA's [[IMAGE]] satellite, digitally overlaid onto ''[[The Blue Marble]]'' composite image.\n[[:Image:Aurora Australis.gif|An animation]] created using the same satellite data is also available]]\nThe details of these phenomena are not fully understood. However, it is clear that the prime source of auroral particles is the solar wind feeding the magnetosphere, the reservoir containing the radiation zones and temporarily magnetically-trapped particles confined by the geomagnetic field, coupled with particle acceleration processes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Burch |first1=J L |editor1-last=Akasofu S-I and Y Kamide |title=The solar wind and the Earth |date=1987 |publisher=D.

Both incoming electrons and protons may be involved. Excitation energy is lost within the atmosphere by the emission of a photon, or by collision with another atom or molecule:\n;[[oxygen]] emissions: green or orange-red, depending on the amount of energy absorbed.\n;[[nitrogen]] emissions:blue, purple or red; blue and purple if the molecule regains an electron after it has been ionized, red if returning to ground state from an excited state.\n\nOxygen is unusual in terms of its return to ground state: it can take 0.7 seconds to emit the 557.7&nbsp;nm green light and up to two minutes for the red 630.0&nbsp;nm emission. Collisions with other atoms or molecules absorb the excitation energy and prevent emission, this process is called [[Quenching (fluorescence)|collisional quenching]]. Because the highest parts of the atmosphere contain a higher percentage of oxygen and lower particle densities, such collisions are rare enough to allow time for oxygen to emit red light. Collisions become more frequent progressing down into the atmosphere due to increasing density, so that red emissions do not have time to happen, and eventually, even green light emissions are prevented.\nThis is why there is a color differential with altitude; at high altitudes oxygen red dominates, then oxygen green and nitrogen blue/purple/red, then finally nitrogen blue/purple/red when collisions prevent oxygen from emitting anything. Green is the most common color. Then comes pink, a mixture of light green and red, followed by pure red, then yellow (a mixture of red and green), and finally, pure blue.\n\n===Auroras and the ionosphere===\nBright auroras are generally associated with [[Birkeland current]]s (Schield et al., 1969;<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/JA074i001p00247 |last1=Schield |first1=M.

In between, some of the current connects directly through the ionospheric E layer (125&nbsp;km); the rest (\"region 2\") detours, leaving again through field lines closer to the equator and closing through the \"partial ring current\" carried by magnetically trapped plasma. The ionosphere is an [[Ohm's law|ohmic conductor]], so some consider that such currents require a driving voltage, which an, as yet unspecified, dynamo mechanism can supply. Electric field probes in orbit above the polar cap suggest voltages of the order of 40,000 volts, rising up to more than 200,000 volts during intense magnetic storms. In another interpretation, the currents are the direct result of electron acceleration into the atmosphere by wave/particle interactions.\n\nIonospheric resistance has a complex nature, and leads to a secondary [[Hall current]] flow. By a strange twist of physics, the magnetic disturbance on the ground due to the main current almost cancels out, so most of the observed effect of auroras is due to a secondary current, the auroral [[electrojet]]. An auroral electrojet index (measured in nanotesla) is regularly derived from ground data and serves as a general measure of auroral activity.

The solar wind reaches Earth with a velocity typically around 400&nbsp;km/s, a density of around 5 ions/cm<sup>3</sup> and a magnetic field intensity of around 2\u20135 nT (for comparison, Earth's surface field is typically 30,000\u201350,000 nT). During [[Geomagnetic storm|magnetic storms]], in particular, flows can be several times faster; the [[interplanetary magnetic field]] (IMF) may also be much stronger. [[Joan Feynman]] deduced in the 1970s that the long-term averages of solar wind speed correlated with geomagnetic activity.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19770051690|title=On the high correlation between long-term averages of solar wind speed and geomagnetic activity|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|author1=Crooker, N.

It is well known (since [[Michael Faraday]]'s work around 1830) that when an electrical conductor is placed within a magnetic field while relative motion occurs in a direction that the conductor cuts ''across'' (or is cut ''by''), rather than ''along'', the lines of the magnetic field, an electric current is induced within the conductor. The strength of the current depends on a) the rate of relative motion, b) the strength of the magnetic field, c) the number of conductors ganged together and d) the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field, while the ''direction'' of flow is dependent upon the direction of relative motion. [[Dynamo]]s make use of this basic process (\"the [[dynamo theory|dynamo effect]]\"), any and all conductors, solid or otherwise are so affected, including plasmas and other fluids.\nThe IMF originates on the Sun, linked to the [[sunspot]]s, and its [[magnetism|field lines (lines of force)]] are dragged out by the solar wind. That alone would tend to line them up in the Sun-Earth direction, but the rotation of the Sun angles them at Earth by about 45 degrees forming a spiral in the ecliptic plane), known as the [[Eugene Parker|Parker spiral]]. The field lines passing Earth are therefore usually linked to those near the western edge (\"limb\") of the visible Sun at any time.<ref>[http://gse.gi.alaska.edu/recent/javascript_movie.html Alaska.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220050940/http://gse.gi.alaska.edu/recent/javascript_movie.html |date=20 December 2006 }}, Solar wind forecast from a [[University of Alaska]] website</ref>\nThe solar wind and the magnetosphere, being two electrically conducting fluids in relative motion, should be able in principle to generate electric currents by dynamo action and impart energy from the flow of the solar wind. However, this process is hampered by the fact that plasmas conduct readily along magnetic field lines, but less readily perpendicular to them. Energy is more effectively transferred by the temporary magnetic connection between the field lines of the solar wind and those of the magnetosphere. Unsurprisingly this process is known as [[magnetic reconnection]]. As already mentioned, it happens most readily when the interplanetary field is directed southward, in a similar direction to the geomagnetic field in the inner regions of both the [[north magnetic pole]] and [[south magnetic pole]].\n[[File:Structure_of_the_magnetosphere_LanguageSwitch.svg|lang=en|thumb|Schematic of Earth's [[magnetosphere]]]]\nAuroras are more frequent and brighter during the intense phase of the solar cycle when [[coronal mass ejections]] increase the intensity of the solar wind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/aurora_worldbook.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905165404/http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/aurora_worldbook.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 September 2005 |title=NASA \u2013 NASA and World Book |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=7 February 2011 |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Magnetosphere===\nEarth's [[magnetosphere]] is shaped by the impact of the solar wind on the Earth's magnetic field.

It is not well understood, but geomagnetic storms may vary with Earth's seasons. Two factors to consider are the tilt of both the solar and Earth's axis to the ecliptic plane. As the Earth orbits throughout a year, it experiences an interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) from different latitudes of the Sun, which is tilted at 8 degrees. Similarly, the 23-degree tilt of the Earth's axis about which the geomagnetic pole rotates with a diurnal variation changes the daily average angle that the geomagnetic field presents to the incident IMF throughout a year. These factors combined can lead to minor cyclical changes in the detailed way that the IMF links to the magnetosphere. In turn, this affects the average probability of opening a door through which energy from the solar wind can reach the Earth's inner magnetosphere and thereby enhance auroras.\n\n==Auroral particle acceleration==\nThe electrons responsible for the brightest forms of the aurora are well accounted for by their acceleration in the dynamic electric fields of plasma turbulence encountered during precipitation from the magnetosphere into the auroral atmosphere. In contrast, static electric fields are unable to transfer energy to the electrons due to their conservative nature.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bryant |first1=Duncan |title=Electron-Acceleration-in-the-Aurora-and-Beyond |date=1998 |publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing Ltd |location=Bristol & Philadelphia |isbn=978-0750305334 |url=https://www.crcpress.com/Electron-Acceleration-in-the-Aurora-and-Beyond/Bryant/9780750305334 |page=163}}</ref> The electrons and ions that cause the diffuse aurora appear not to be accelerated during precipitation.\nThe increase in strength of magnetic field lines towards the Earth creates a 'magnetic mirror' that turns back many of the downward flowing electrons. The bright forms of auroras are produced when downward acceleration not only increases the energy of precipitating electrons but also reduces their pitch angles (angle between electron velocity and the local magnetic field vector). This greatly increases the rate of deposition of energy into the atmosphere, and thereby the rates of ionization, excitation and consequent emission of auroral light. Acceleration also increases the electron current flowing between the atmosphere and magnetosphere.\n\nOne early theory proposed for the acceleration of auroral electrons is based on an assumed static, or quasi-static, electric field creating a uni-directional potential drop.<ref name=\"Evidence for the low altitude acceleration of auroral particles\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=D S |title=Hot Plasma in the Magnetosphere |date=1975 |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York and London |isbn=978-0306337000 |pages=319\u2013340}}</ref> No mention is provided of either the necessary space-charge or equipotential distribution, and these remain to be specified for the notion of acceleration by double layers to be credible.

The question is whether these waves might just be a different way of looking at the above process, however, because this approach does not point out a different energy source, and many plasma bulk phenomena can also be described in terms of Alfv\u00e9n waves.\nOther processes are also involved in the aurora, and much remains to be learned. Auroral electrons created by large geomagnetic storms often seem to have energies below 1 keV and are stopped higher up, near 200&nbsp;km. Such low energies excite mainly the red line of oxygen so that often such auroras are red. On the other hand, positive ions also reach the ionosphere at such time, with energies of 20\u201330 keV, suggesting they might be an \"overflow\" along magnetic field lines of the copious \"ring current\" ions accelerated at such times, by processes different from the ones described above.\nSome O+ ions (\"conics\") also seem accelerated in different ways by plasma processes associated with the aurora. These ions are accelerated by plasma waves in directions mainly perpendicular to the field lines. They, therefore, start at their \"mirror points\" and can travel only upward. As they do so, the \"mirror effect\" transforms their directions of motion, from perpendicular to the field line to a cone around it, which gradually narrows down, becoming increasingly parallel at large distances where the field is much weaker.\n\n==Auroral events of historical significance==\nThe discovery of a 1770 Japanese [[diary]] in 2017 depicting auroras above the ancient Japanese capital of [[Kyoto]] suggested that the storm may have been 7% larger than the [[Carrington event]], which affected telegraph networks.<ref name=\"1770 Japanese diary\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/aurora-kyoto-1770-painting-science-magnetic-storm |title=1770 Kyoto Diary |last=Frost |first=Natasha |date=4 October 2017 |website=Atlas Obscura |access-date=13 October 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Inclined zenith aurora over Kyoto on 17 September 1770: Graphical evidence of extreme magnetic storm\">{{Cite journal |title=Inclined zenith aurora over Kyoto on 17 September 1770: Graphical evidence of extreme magnetic storm |journal=Space Weather |volume=15 |issue=10 |pages=1314\u20131320 |date=17 September 2017 |doi = 10.1002/2017SW001690|last1 = Kataoka|first1 = Ryuho|last2=Iwahashi |first2=Kiyomi |bibcode=2017SpWea..15.1314K }}</ref>\n\nThe auroras that resulted from the \"[[Solar storm of 1859|great geomagnetic storm]]\" on both 28 August and 2 September 1859, however, are thought to be the most spectacular in recent recorded history.

It says no appearance is recorded in the [[French Academy of Sciences|''Transactions of the French Academy of Sciences'']] between 1666 and 1716.

[[Anders Celsius|Celsius]] (1733) states the oldest residents of [[Uppsala]] thought the phenomenon a great rarity before 1716. The period between approximately 1645 to 1715 corresponds to the [[Maunder minimum]] in sunspot activity.\n\nIt was the Norwegian scientist [[Kristian Birkeland]] who, in the early 1900s, laid the foundation for our current understanding of geomagnetism and polar auroras.\n\n==Non-terrestrial auroras==\n\n[[Image:Jupiter.Aurora.HST.UV.jpg|thumb|[[Jupiter]] aurora; the far left bright spot connects magnetically to [[Io (moon)|Io]]; the spots at the bottom of the image lead to [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]].]]\n[[File:Saturns Northern Aurora still.jpg|thumb|An aurora high above the northern part of Saturn; image taken by the [[Cassini spacecraft]].\n[[:Image:Saturns Northern Aurora in Motion.gif|A movie]] shows images from 81 hours of observations of Saturn's aurora]]\n{{see also|Magnetosphere of Jupiter#Aurorae}}\nBoth [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] have magnetic fields that are stronger than Earth's (Jupiter's equatorial field strength is 4.3 gauss, compared to 0.3 gauss for Earth), and both have extensive radiation belts.

However, Jupiter's aurorae are more complex. The Jupiter's main auroral oval is associated with the plasma produced by the volcanic moon, [[Io (moon)|Io]] and the transport of this plasma within the planet's [[Magnetosphere of Jupiter|magnetosphere]]. An uncertain fraction of Jupiter's aurorae are powered by the solar wind. In addition, the moons, especially Io, are also powerful sources of aurora. These arise from electric currents along field lines (\"field aligned currents\"), generated by a dynamo mechanism due to the relative motion between the rotating planet and the moving moon. Io, which has active [[volcanism]] and an ionosphere, is a particularly strong source, and its currents also generate radio emissions, which have been studied since 1955. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, auroras over Io, Europa and Ganymede have all been observed.\n\nAuroras have also been observed on [[Venus]] and [[Mars]]. Venus has no magnetic field and so Venusian auroras appear as bright and diffuse patches of varying shape and intensity, sometimes distributed over the full disc of the planet. A Venusian aurora originates when electrons from the solar wind collide with the night-side atmosphere.\n\nAn aurora was detected on Mars, on 14 August 2004, by the SPICAM instrument aboard [[Mars Express]]. The aurora was located at [[Terra Cimmeria]], in the region of 177\u00b0 East, 52\u00b0 South. The total size of the emission region was about 30&nbsp;km across, and possibly about 8&nbsp;km high. By analyzing a map of crustal magnetic anomalies compiled with data from [[Mars Global Surveyor]], scientists observed that the region of the emissions corresponded to an area where the strongest magnetic field is localized. This correlation indicated that the origin of the light emission was a flux of electrons moving along the crust magnetic lines and exciting the upper atmosphere of Mars.<ref name=\"esa\"/><ref>{{cite news|date=18 February 2006 |url=http://www.universetoday.com/am/publish/mars_express_aurorae.html?1722006 |title=Mars Express Finds Auroras on Mars |work=Universe Today |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe first ever [[Extra-solar object|extra-solar]] auroras were discovered in July 2015 over the [[brown dwarf]] star [[LSR J1835+3259]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/monstrous-aurora-detected-beyond-our-solar-system-150729.htm |title=Monstrous Aurora Detected Beyond our Solar System |last1=O'Neill |first1=Ian |date=29 July 2015 |website=news.discovery.com |publisher=Discovery |access-date=29 July 2015}}</ref> The mainly red aurora was found to be a million times brighter than the Northern Lights, a result of the charged particles interacting with hydrogen in the atmosphere.

The low number of oxygen atoms and their gradually diminishing concentration is responsible for the faint appearance of the top parts of the \"curtains\". Scarlet, crimson, and carmine are the most often-seen hues of red for the auroras.\n* '''Green''': At lower altitudes, the more frequent collisions suppress the 630-nm (red) mode: rather the 557.7&nbsp;nm emission (green) dominates. A fairly high concentration of atomic oxygen and higher eye sensitivity in green make green auroras the most common. The excited molecular nitrogen (atomic nitrogen being rare due to the high stability of the N<sub>2</sub> molecule) plays a role here, as it can transfer energy by collision to an oxygen atom, which then radiates it away at the green wavelength. (Red and green can also mix together to produce pink or yellow hues.) The rapid decrease of concentration of atomic oxygen below about 100&nbsp;km is responsible for the abrupt-looking end of the lower edges of the curtains. Both the 557.7 and 630.0&nbsp;nm wavelengths correspond to [[forbidden transition]]s of atomic oxygen, a slow mechanism responsible for the graduality (0.7&nbsp;s and 107&nbsp;s respectively) of flaring and fading.\n* '''Blue''': At yet lower altitudes, atomic oxygen is uncommon, and molecular nitrogen and ionized molecular nitrogen take over in producing visible light emission, radiating at a large number of wavelengths in both red and blue parts of the spectrum, with 428&nbsp;nm (blue) being dominant.

The varying intensity of the solar wind produces effects of different magnitudes but includes one or more of the following physical scenarios.\n# A quiescent solar wind flowing past the Earth's magnetosphere steadily interacts with it and can both inject solar wind particles directly onto the geomagnetic field lines that are 'open', as opposed to being 'closed' in the opposite hemisphere, and provide diffusion through the [[bow shock]]. It can also cause particles already trapped in the [[Van Allen radiation belt|radiation belts]] to precipitate into the atmosphere. Once particles are lost to the atmosphere from the radiation belts, under quiet conditions, new ones replace them only slowly, and the loss-cone becomes depleted. In the magnetotail, however, particle trajectories seem constantly to reshuffle, probably when the particles cross the very weak magnetic field near the equator. As a result, the flow of electrons in that region is nearly the same in all directions (\"isotropic\") and assures a steady supply of leaking electrons. The leakage of electrons does not leave the tail positively charged, because each leaked electron lost to the atmosphere is replaced by a low energy electron drawn upward from the [[ionosphere]]. Such replacement of \"hot\" electrons by \"cold\" ones is in complete accord with the [[2nd law of thermodynamics]]. The complete process, which also generates an electric ring current around the Earth, is uncertain.\n# Geomagnetic disturbance from an enhanced [[solar wind]] causes distortions of the [[magnetosphere|magnetotail]] (\"magnetic substorms\"). These 'substorms' tend to occur after prolonged spells(hours) during which the interplanetary magnetic field has had an appreciable southward component. This leads to a higher rate of interconnection between its field lines and those of Earth. As a result, the solar wind moves [[magnetic flux]] (tubes of magnetic field lines, 'locked' together with their resident plasma) from the day side of Earth to the magnetotail, widening the obstacle it presents to the solar wind flow and constricting the tail on the night-side. Ultimately some tail plasma can separate (\"[[magnetic reconnection]]\"); some blobs (\"[[plasmoid]]s\") are squeezed downstream and are carried away with the solar wind; others are squeezed toward Earth where their motion feeds strong outbursts of auroras, mainly around midnight (\"unloading process\"). A geomagnetic storm resulting from greater interaction adds many more particles to the plasma trapped around Earth, also producing enhancement of the \"ring current\". Occasionally the resulting modification of the Earth's magnetic field can be so strong that it produces auroras visible at middle latitudes, on field lines much closer to the equator than those of the auroral zone.\n#: [[File:Moon and Aurora.jpg|thumb|Moon and Aurora]]\n# Acceleration of auroral charged particles invariably accompanies a magnetospheric disturbance that causes an aurora. This mechanism, which is believed to predominantly arise from strong electric fields along the magnetic field or wave-particle interactions, raises the velocity of a particle in the direction of the guiding magnetic field. The pitch angle is thereby decreased and increases the chance of it being precipitated into the atmosphere. Both electromagnetic and electrostatic waves, produced at the time of greater geomagnetic disturbances, make a significant contribution to the energizing processes that sustain an aurora. Particle acceleration provides a complex intermediate process for transferring energy from the solar wind indirectly into the atmosphere.\n[[File:Aurora australis 20050911.jpg|right|thumb|Aurora australis (11 September 2005) as captured by NASA's [[IMAGE]] satellite, digitally overlaid onto ''[[The Blue Marble]]'' composite image.\n[[:Image:Aurora Australis.gif|An animation]] created using the same satellite data is also available]]\nThe details of these phenomena are not fully understood. However, it is clear that the prime source of auroral particles is the solar wind feeding the magnetosphere, the reservoir containing the radiation zones and temporarily magnetically-trapped particles confined by the geomagnetic field, coupled with particle acceleration processes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Burch |first1=J L |editor1-last=Akasofu S-I and Y Kamide |title=The solar wind and the Earth |date=1987 |publisher=D.

Both incoming electrons and protons may be involved. Excitation energy is lost within the atmosphere by the emission of a photon, or by collision with another atom or molecule:\n;[[oxygen]] emissions: green or orange-red, depending on the amount of energy absorbed.\n;[[nitrogen]] emissions:blue, purple or red; blue and purple if the molecule regains an electron after it has been ionized, red if returning to ground state from an excited state.\n\nOxygen is unusual in terms of its return to ground state: it can take 0.7 seconds to emit the 557.7&nbsp;nm green light and up to two minutes for the red 630.0&nbsp;nm emission. Collisions with other atoms or molecules absorb the excitation energy and prevent emission, this process is called [[Quenching (fluorescence)|collisional quenching]]. Because the highest parts of the atmosphere contain a higher percentage of oxygen and lower particle densities, such collisions are rare enough to allow time for oxygen to emit red light. Collisions become more frequent progressing down into the atmosphere due to increasing density, so that red emissions do not have time to happen, and eventually, even green light emissions are prevented.\nThis is why there is a color differential with altitude; at high altitudes oxygen red dominates, then oxygen green and nitrogen blue/purple/red, then finally nitrogen blue/purple/red when collisions prevent oxygen from emitting anything. Green is the most common color. Then comes pink, a mixture of light green and red, followed by pure red, then yellow (a mixture of red and green), and finally, pure blue.\n\n===Auroras and the ionosphere===\nBright auroras are generally associated with [[Birkeland current]]s (Schield et al., 1969;<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/JA074i001p00247 |last1=Schield |first1=M.

In between, some of the current connects directly through the ionospheric E layer (125&nbsp;km); the rest (\"region 2\") detours, leaving again through field lines closer to the equator and closing through the \"partial ring current\" carried by magnetically trapped plasma. The ionosphere is an [[Ohm's law|ohmic conductor]], so some consider that such currents require a driving voltage, which an, as yet unspecified, dynamo mechanism can supply. Electric field probes in orbit above the polar cap suggest voltages of the order of 40,000 volts, rising up to more than 200,000 volts during intense magnetic storms. In another interpretation, the currents are the direct result of electron acceleration into the atmosphere by wave/particle interactions.\n\nIonospheric resistance has a complex nature, and leads to a secondary [[Hall current]] flow. By a strange twist of physics, the magnetic disturbance on the ground due to the main current almost cancels out, so most of the observed effect of auroras is due to a secondary current, the auroral [[electrojet]]. An auroral electrojet index (measured in nanotesla) is regularly derived from ground data and serves as a general measure of auroral activity.

The solar wind reaches Earth with a velocity typically around 400&nbsp;km/s, a density of around 5 ions/cm<sup>3</sup> and a magnetic field intensity of around 2\u20135 nT (for comparison, Earth's surface field is typically 30,000\u201350,000 nT). During [[Geomagnetic storm|magnetic storms]], in particular, flows can be several times faster; the [[interplanetary magnetic field]] (IMF) may also be much stronger. [[Joan Feynman]] deduced in the 1970s that the long-term averages of solar wind speed correlated with geomagnetic activity.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19770051690|title=On the high correlation between long-term averages of solar wind speed and geomagnetic activity|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|author1=Crooker, N.

It is well known (since [[Michael Faraday]]'s work around 1830) that when an electrical conductor is placed within a magnetic field while relative motion occurs in a direction that the conductor cuts ''across'' (or is cut ''by''), rather than ''along'', the lines of the magnetic field, an electric current is induced within the conductor. The strength of the current depends on a) the rate of relative motion, b) the strength of the magnetic field, c) the number of conductors ganged together and d) the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field, while the ''direction'' of flow is dependent upon the direction of relative motion. [[Dynamo]]s make use of this basic process (\"the [[dynamo theory|dynamo effect]]\"), any and all conductors, solid or otherwise are so affected, including plasmas and other fluids.\nThe IMF originates on the Sun, linked to the [[sunspot]]s, and its [[magnetism|field lines (lines of force)]] are dragged out by the solar wind. That alone would tend to line them up in the Sun-Earth direction, but the rotation of the Sun angles them at Earth by about 45 degrees forming a spiral in the ecliptic plane), known as the [[Eugene Parker|Parker spiral]]. The field lines passing Earth are therefore usually linked to those near the western edge (\"limb\") of the visible Sun at any time.<ref>[http://gse.gi.alaska.edu/recent/javascript_movie.html Alaska.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220050940/http://gse.gi.alaska.edu/recent/javascript_movie.html |date=20 December 2006 }}, Solar wind forecast from a [[University of Alaska]] website</ref>\nThe solar wind and the magnetosphere, being two electrically conducting fluids in relative motion, should be able in principle to generate electric currents by dynamo action and impart energy from the flow of the solar wind. However, this process is hampered by the fact that plasmas conduct readily along magnetic field lines, but less readily perpendicular to them. Energy is more effectively transferred by the temporary magnetic connection between the field lines of the solar wind and those of the magnetosphere. Unsurprisingly this process is known as [[magnetic reconnection]]. As already mentioned, it happens most readily when the interplanetary field is directed southward, in a similar direction to the geomagnetic field in the inner regions of both the [[north magnetic pole]] and [[south magnetic pole]].\n[[File:Structure_of_the_magnetosphere_LanguageSwitch.svg|lang=en|thumb|Schematic of Earth's [[magnetosphere]]]]\nAuroras are more frequent and brighter during the intense phase of the solar cycle when [[coronal mass ejections]] increase the intensity of the solar wind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/aurora_worldbook.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905165404/http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/aurora_worldbook.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 September 2005 |title=NASA \u2013 NASA and World Book |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=7 February 2011 |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Magnetosphere===\nEarth's [[magnetosphere]] is shaped by the impact of the solar wind on the Earth's magnetic field.

It is not well understood, but geomagnetic storms may vary with Earth's seasons. Two factors to consider are the tilt of both the solar and Earth's axis to the ecliptic plane. As the Earth orbits throughout a year, it experiences an interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) from different latitudes of the Sun, which is tilted at 8 degrees. Similarly, the 23-degree tilt of the Earth's axis about which the geomagnetic pole rotates with a diurnal variation changes the daily average angle that the geomagnetic field presents to the incident IMF throughout a year. These factors combined can lead to minor cyclical changes in the detailed way that the IMF links to the magnetosphere. In turn, this affects the average probability of opening a door through which energy from the solar wind can reach the Earth's inner magnetosphere and thereby enhance auroras.\n\n==Auroral particle acceleration==\nThe electrons responsible for the brightest forms of the aurora are well accounted for by their acceleration in the dynamic electric fields of plasma turbulence encountered during precipitation from the magnetosphere into the auroral atmosphere. In contrast, static electric fields are unable to transfer energy to the electrons due to their conservative nature.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bryant |first1=Duncan |title=Electron-Acceleration-in-the-Aurora-and-Beyond |date=1998 |publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing Ltd |location=Bristol & Philadelphia |isbn=978-0750305334 |url=https://www.crcpress.com/Electron-Acceleration-in-the-Aurora-and-Beyond/Bryant/9780750305334 |page=163}}</ref> The electrons and ions that cause the diffuse aurora appear not to be accelerated during precipitation.\nThe increase in strength of magnetic field lines towards the Earth creates a 'magnetic mirror' that turns back many of the downward flowing electrons. The bright forms of auroras are produced when downward acceleration not only increases the energy of precipitating electrons but also reduces their pitch angles (angle between electron velocity and the local magnetic field vector). This greatly increases the rate of deposition of energy into the atmosphere, and thereby the rates of ionization, excitation and consequent emission of auroral light. Acceleration also increases the electron current flowing between the atmosphere and magnetosphere.\n\nOne early theory proposed for the acceleration of auroral electrons is based on an assumed static, or quasi-static, electric field creating a uni-directional potential drop.<ref name=\"Evidence for the low altitude acceleration of auroral particles\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=D S |title=Hot Plasma in the Magnetosphere |date=1975 |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York and London |isbn=978-0306337000 |pages=319\u2013340}}</ref> No mention is provided of either the necessary space-charge or equipotential distribution, and these remain to be specified for the notion of acceleration by double layers to be credible.

The question is whether these waves might just be a different way of looking at the above process, however, because this approach does not point out a different energy source, and many plasma bulk phenomena can also be described in terms of Alfv\u00e9n waves.\nOther processes are also involved in the aurora, and much remains to be learned. Auroral electrons created by large geomagnetic storms often seem to have energies below 1 keV and are stopped higher up, near 200&nbsp;km. Such low energies excite mainly the red line of oxygen so that often such auroras are red. On the other hand, positive ions also reach the ionosphere at such time, with energies of 20\u201330 keV, suggesting they might be an \"overflow\" along magnetic field lines of the copious \"ring current\" ions accelerated at such times, by processes different from the ones described above.\nSome O+ ions (\"conics\") also seem accelerated in different ways by plasma processes associated with the aurora. These ions are accelerated by plasma waves in directions mainly perpendicular to the field lines. They, therefore, start at their \"mirror points\" and can travel only upward. As they do so, the \"mirror effect\" transforms their directions of motion, from perpendicular to the field line to a cone around it, which gradually narrows down, becoming increasingly parallel at large distances where the field is much weaker.\n\n==Auroral events of historical significance==\nThe discovery of a 1770 Japanese [[diary]] in 2017 depicting auroras above the ancient Japanese capital of [[Kyoto]] suggested that the storm may have been 7% larger than the [[Carrington event]], which affected telegraph networks.<ref name=\"1770 Japanese diary\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/aurora-kyoto-1770-painting-science-magnetic-storm |title=1770 Kyoto Diary |last=Frost |first=Natasha |date=4 October 2017 |website=Atlas Obscura |access-date=13 October 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Inclined zenith aurora over Kyoto on 17 September 1770: Graphical evidence of extreme magnetic storm\">{{Cite journal |title=Inclined zenith aurora over Kyoto on 17 September 1770: Graphical evidence of extreme magnetic storm |journal=Space Weather |volume=15 |issue=10 |pages=1314\u20131320 |date=17 September 2017 |doi = 10.1002/2017SW001690|last1 = Kataoka|first1 = Ryuho|last2=Iwahashi |first2=Kiyomi |bibcode=2017SpWea..15.1314K }}</ref>\n\nThe auroras that resulted from the \"[[Solar storm of 1859|great geomagnetic storm]]\" on both 28 August and 2 September 1859, however, are thought to be the most spectacular in recent recorded history.

The European explorer [[Samuel Hearne]] traveled with [[Chipewyan|Chipewyan Dene]] in 1771 and recorded their views on the ''ed-thin'' ('caribou'). According to Hearne, the Dene people saw the resemblance between an aurora and the sparks produced when [[caribou]] fur is stroked. They believed that the lights were the spirits of their departed friends dancing in the sky, and when they shone brightly it meant that their deceased friends were very happy.<ref>Hearne, Samuel (1958).

The [[Confederate Army]] took this as a sign that God was on their side, as the lights were rarely seen so far south. The painting ''[[Aurora Borealis (painting)|Aurora Borealis]]'' by [[Frederic Edwin Church]] is widely interpreted to represent the conflict of the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=4806|title=''Aurora Borealis'' at the American Art Museum}}</ref>\n\nA mid 19th-century British source says auroras were a rare occurrence before the 18th-century.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol.II'', (1847), London, Charles Knight, p.496</ref> It quotes [[Edmond Halley|Halley]] as saying that before the aurora of 1716, no such phenomenon had been recorded for more than 80 years, and none of any consequence since 1574. It says no appearance is recorded in the [[French Academy of Sciences|''Transactions of the French Academy of Sciences'']] between 1666 and 1716. And that one aurora recorded in ''Berlin Miscellany'' for 1797 was called a very rare event. One observed in 1723 at [[Bologna]] was stated to be the first ever seen there. [[Anders Celsius|Celsius]] (1733) states the oldest residents of [[Uppsala]] thought the phenomenon a great rarity before 1716. The period between approximately 1645 to 1715 corresponds to the [[Maunder minimum]] in sunspot activity.\n\nIt was the Norwegian scientist [[Kristian Birkeland]] who, in the early 1900s, laid the foundation for our current understanding of geomagnetism and polar auroras.\n\n==Non-terrestrial auroras==\n\n[[Image:Jupiter.Aurora.HST.UV.jpg|thumb|[[Jupiter]] aurora; the far left bright spot connects magnetically to [[Io (moon)|Io]]; the spots at the bottom of the image lead to [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]].]]\n[[File:Saturns Northern Aurora still.jpg|thumb|An aurora high above the northern part of Saturn; image taken by the [[Cassini spacecraft]].\n[[:Image:Saturns Northern Aurora in Motion.gif|A movie]] shows images from 81 hours of observations of Saturn's aurora]]\n{{see also|Magnetosphere of Jupiter#Aurorae}}\nBoth [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] have magnetic fields that are stronger than Earth's (Jupiter's equatorial field strength is 4.3 gauss, compared to 0.3 gauss for Earth), and both have extensive radiation belts. Auroras have been observed on both gas planets, most clearly using the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], and the [[Cassini\u2013Huygens|''Cassini'']] and [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'']] spacecraft, as well as on [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]].<ref name=\"esa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMLQ71DU8E_index_0.html |title=ESA Portal \u2013 Mars Express discovers auroras on Mars |publisher=Esa.int |date=11 August 2004 |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe aurorae on Saturn seem, like Earth's, to be powered by the solar wind. However, Jupiter's aurorae are more complex. The Jupiter's main auroral oval is associated with the plasma produced by the volcanic moon, [[Io (moon)|Io]] and the transport of this plasma within the planet's [[Magnetosphere of Jupiter|magnetosphere]]. An uncertain fraction of Jupiter's aurorae are powered by the solar wind. In addition, the moons, especially Io, are also powerful sources of aurora. These arise from electric currents along field lines (\"field aligned currents\"), generated by a dynamo mechanism due to the relative motion between the rotating planet and the moving moon. Io, which has active [[volcanism]] and an ionosphere, is a particularly strong source, and its currents also generate radio emissions, which have been studied since 1955. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, auroras over Io, Europa and Ganymede have all been observed.\n\nAuroras have also been observed on [[Venus]] and [[Mars]]. Venus has no magnetic field and so Venusian auroras appear as bright and diffuse patches of varying shape and intensity, sometimes distributed over the full disc of the planet. A Venusian aurora originates when electrons from the solar wind collide with the night-side atmosphere.\n\nAn aurora was detected on Mars, on 14 August 2004, by the SPICAM instrument aboard [[Mars Express]]. The aurora was located at [[Terra Cimmeria]], in the region of 177\u00b0 East, 52\u00b0 South. The total size of the emission region was about 30&nbsp;km across, and possibly about 8&nbsp;km high. By analyzing a map of crustal magnetic anomalies compiled with data from [[Mars Global Surveyor]], scientists observed that the region of the emissions corresponded to an area where the strongest magnetic field is localized. This correlation indicated that the origin of the light emission was a flux of electrons moving along the crust magnetic lines and exciting the upper atmosphere of Mars.<ref name=\"esa\"/><ref>{{cite news|date=18 February 2006 |url=http://www.universetoday.com/am/publish/mars_express_aurorae.html?1722006 |title=Mars Express Finds Auroras on Mars |work=Universe Today |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe first ever [[Extra-solar object|extra-solar]] auroras were discovered in July 2015 over the [[brown dwarf]] star [[LSR J1835+3259]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/monstrous-aurora-detected-beyond-our-solar-system-150729.htm |title=Monstrous Aurora Detected Beyond our Solar System |last1=O'Neill |first1=Ian |date=29 July 2015 |website=news.discovery.com |publisher=Discovery |access-date=29 July 2015}}</ref> The mainly red aurora was found to be a million times brighter than the Northern Lights, a result of the charged particles interacting with hydrogen in the atmosphere. It has been speculated that stellar winds may be stripping off material from the surface of the brown dwarf to produce its own electrons. Another possible explanation for the auroras is that an as-yet-undetected body around the dwarf star is throwing off material, as is the case with Jupiter and its moon Io.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/30087-alien-auroras-found-beyond-solar-system.html |title=First Alien Auroras Found, Are 1 Million Times Brighter Than Any on Earth |last1=Q.
