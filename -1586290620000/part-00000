Container terminal operations are subcontracted to a private consortium called the Beirut Container Terminal Consortium (BCTC).\n\nSince the end of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1990, the port has gone through a major updating and expansion program with the rehabilitation of existing port facilities, the construction of new administration buildings, and the construction of a new container terminal.\n\nIt's an important gateway for transporting freight to [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], [[Iraq]], and the [[Persian Gulf States]].\n\nThe Port of Beirut has a total area of 1,200,000m<sup>2</sup> and has 4 [[dock (maritime)|basins]], 16 [[quays]], and a new [[container terminal]] at quay 16 capable of handling {{TEU|745,000|first=yes}} per year.\n\nThe [[free port|Free Zone]] includes three industrial buildings with warehouses covering a total area of 32,400m<sup>2</sup> and a commercial building with 46 [[duty-free]] shops covering an area of 11,200m<sup>2</sup>. In 2007, the Logistic Free Zone (LFZ) was established containing several logistics warehouses where goods can undergo transformations before being exported via land, sea, and air or imported into Lebanon.\n\nThe general cargo area consists of 12 warehouses and a [[storage silo|grain silo]] with a capacity of 120,000 tons of grain.\n\nThe Port of Beirut has been selected as a [[transshipment|transshipment hub]] for the second and third largest container shipping companies in the world, Swiss-based [[Mediterranean Shipping Company]] (MSC) and French-based [[CMA CGM|Compagnie Maritime d\u2019Affr\u00e8tement - Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Maritime]] (CMA-CGM).

It was established in December 2004 and began operations in 2005, although the container terminal facilities were completed in 2000.\n\nThe majority of container traffic is handled by the new quay 16, the longest and deepest of all the quays at a length of 600m and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of 15.5m allowing it to accommodate the largest [[container ships]] in the world. It has a stacking area of 365,000m<sup>2</sup> allowing it to process up to 745,000 [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEU]] per year.\n\nQuay 16 is equipped with 6 [[Super-post-Panamax]] [[container crane]]s and 18 [[rubber tyred gantry crane]]s manufactured by [[Zhenhua|Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industry Company]] (ZPMC). \n\nDue to the very high traffic the container terminal is experiencing, the BCTC reached an agreement with the port authority to utilize the older quays 12, 13, and 14 for handling smaller container ships when quay 16 is occupied. This allows the container terminal to process up to 1,200,000 TEU per year and reduce vessel wait times. Container ships that are processed at these older quays as well as quay 15 have their containers loaded and unloaded by two [[mobile crane|mobile harbour cranes]] manufactured by [[Gottwald Port Technology]].\n\n===Expansion===\n====Phase I====\nThe first phase of the container terminal expansion was launched last year and involves expanding quay 16 by 500m to the east reaching the mouth of the [[Beirut River]] by reclaiming 140,000m<sup>2</sup> of land creating a new 180,000m<sup>2</sup> stacking area for containers. This will extend the quay from its present 600m to 1,100m. The [[draft (hull)|draft]] along the expanded quay will be 17.5m. The existing detached [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] for quay 16 will also be extended. The expansion will increase the container terminal capacity by 450,000 TEU allowing the terminal to process 1,500,000 TEU per year.

Ratios larger or smaller than compared with that in the sun or [[CI chondrite]]s, which are used as proxy for the sun, indicate that significant hydrodynamic escape has occurred since the formation of the planet.

Middle East.\u201d The map, entitled \u201cHow 5 Could Become 14,\u201d shows a hypothetical future division of Libya, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia into 14 potential new countries along with two additional city-states. I was immediately reminded of Ralph Peters\u2019 troublesome remapping of the same region. As explained in a previous GeoCurrents post, Peters\u2019 intriguing mental exercise in redrawing national boundaries was widely misinterpreted across the Muslim world as indicating a nefarious plot to enhance US power. As a result, the region\u2019s pronounced anti-Americanism was further inflamed.<ref>http://www.geocurrents.info/geopolitics/myth-nation-state/robin-wrights-audacious-remapping-middle-east</ref><ref>https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2015/03/26/from-one-yemen-to-a-dissolution-of-saudi-arabia/</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Robin-Wrights-Remapped-Middle-East.png</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Saudi-Arabia-Remapped-by-Robin-Wright.png</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in June 2012 the Yemeni newspaper ''Al-Shareh'' revealed the names of high-ranking Yemeni state officials and tribal sheikhs who had been receiving monthly bribes from Saudi Arabia. This sparked anger among Yemenis, and a group of Yemeni activists founded the \"Asir Movement\" in order to reclaim the provinces of Asir, Najran, and Jizan, which Yemen conceded in the 2000 [[Treaty of Jeddah (2000)|Treaty of Jeddah]].

Although the DPP has been the nominal ruling party of the Republic of China throughout these four ruling terms, the DPP has been pushing a pro-Taiwan independence agenda, whether tacitly or overtly. Some representatives of the DPP, such as [[William Lai]], argue that Taiwan independence should not even be considered an \"independence movement\" but is rather the recognition of the reality of the current situation of the [[Republic of China on Taiwan]].

However, Kinmen's history is highly distinct from Taiwan's, and they've only really had a shared history since 1949, when the [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|Republic of China retreated to Taiwan]]. Furthermore, Kinmen's recent history has been largely shaped by military conflict between the ROC and the PRC and by the fact that [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] was abolished in Kinmen in 1992, five years after it was abolished in Taiwan (in 1987). If the \"[[Taiwan independence movement|Republic of Taiwan]]\" were to be established, many people are uncertain of whether Kinmen should be included in this new country.

The Kinmen County government has frequently clashed with the [[Mainland Affairs Council|Taiwan Mainland Affairs Council]] (which oversees relations with the PRC) over its willingness to allow the Chinese (PRC) government to infiltrate its society, economy, politics, cultural institutions, religious institutions, educational institutions, and local communities. It is unknown what percentage of Kinmenese society supports this movement but it is known that the Kinmen County government supports this movement and that it has been actively pushing for Kinmen's annexation into China (PRC).\n*** Area of Kinmen: Roughly 150&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n***Population of Kinmen: Roughly 130,000 people\n\n'''Chinese (re)unification under the ROC'''\n\n{{See also|Three Principles of the People|Project National Glory|Communist bandit}}\n\nThis is a variant of the Chinese (re)unification movement that advocates for the ROC to become the ruling regime of China again, replacing the PRC.

It advocates for the (re)unification of China (PRC) and Taiwan (ROC) under a hypothetical \"New China\". Proponents of this movement believe that both the PRC and the ROC have expired and that the only logical solution that is fair to both parties is to overthrow both regimes and replace them with a single \"New China\" regime that possesses characteristics of both the PRC and the ROC, as well as its own unique traits. Visions for such a \"New China\" range from a \"[[dictatorship]]\" to a \"[[democracy]]\".

Middle East.\u201d The map, entitled \u201cHow 5 Could Become 14,\u201d shows a hypothetical future division of Libya, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia into 14 potential new countries along with two additional city-states. I was immediately reminded of Ralph Peters\u2019 troublesome remapping of the same region. As explained in a previous GeoCurrents post, Peters\u2019 intriguing mental exercise in redrawing national boundaries was widely misinterpreted across the Muslim world as indicating a nefarious plot to enhance US power. As a result, the region\u2019s pronounced anti-Americanism was further inflamed.<ref>http://www.geocurrents.info/geopolitics/myth-nation-state/robin-wrights-audacious-remapping-middle-east</ref><ref>https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2015/03/26/from-one-yemen-to-a-dissolution-of-saudi-arabia/</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Robin-Wrights-Remapped-Middle-East.png</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Saudi-Arabia-Remapped-by-Robin-Wright.png</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in June 2012 the Yemeni newspaper ''Al-Shareh'' revealed the names of high-ranking Yemeni state officials and tribal sheikhs who had been receiving monthly bribes from Saudi Arabia. This sparked anger among Yemenis, and a group of Yemeni activists founded the \"Asir Movement\" in order to reclaim the provinces of Asir, Najran, and Jizan, which Yemen conceded in the 2000 [[Treaty of Jeddah (2000)|Treaty of Jeddah]]. A \"[[Human rights|rights]] organization which has worked to denounce Saudi Arabia\u2019s abuses in northern Yemen\",<ref name=PressTV>{{cite news|title=Yemen's Houthis standing ground against Saudi Arabia |url= http://www.presstv.com/detail/2014/02/07/349604/houthis-stand-ground-against-s-arabia |work=Press TV| date=February 7, 2014}}</ref> the Asir Movement described itself as a \u201ccivil popular\u201d movement that seeks to raise \"internal Yemeni awareness\" about the situation and to explore legal remedies against Saudi Arabia \"for their involvement and assistance in abdicating Yemen\u2019s historical right to its territories\", all while emphasizing Yemeni unity.

Although the DPP has been the nominal ruling party of the Republic of China throughout these four ruling terms, the DPP has been pushing a pro-Taiwan independence agenda, whether tacitly or overtly. Some representatives of the DPP, such as [[William Lai]], argue that Taiwan independence should not even be considered an \"independence movement\" but is rather the recognition of the reality of the current situation of the [[Republic of China on Taiwan]]. Many supporters of Taiwan independence believe that Taiwan, under the formal name of the \"Republic of China\", is already an independent country from China, under the formal name of the \"People's Republic of China\".\n***Political parties: [[Pan-Green Coalition]] ([[Democratic Progressive Party]], [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]], [[Taiwan Independence Party]]), [[New Power Party]], [[Taiwan Statebuilding Party]]\n***Advocacy groups: Keep Taiwan Free (Taiwanese organisation), [[World United Formosans for Independence]]\n***Claimed territories: Taiwan (Kaohsiung, New Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Taipei, Taiwan-Penghu, Taoyuan)\n***Area of claimed territories: Roughly 36,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n***Population of claimed territories: Roughly 24,000,000 people\n{{flagdeco|Kinmen}}{{flagdeco|TWN}} '''[[Kinmen|Kinmen County, Republic of China (Taiwan)]] (Kinmen)''' \u2014 Independence movement{{See also|Kinmen|Taiwan independence movement#The issue of Kinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu (Lienchiang)}}\n\n* Ethnic group: Kinmenese people, [[Taiwanese people]]\n**Proposed unification with a proposed state: {{flagdeco|Kinmen}}{{flagdeco|TWN}}[[File:Flag of World Taiwanese Congress.svg|22px|border]] Kinmen County, Republic of Taiwan\n***Movement: Kinmen-Taiwan unification movement, [[Taiwan independence movement]], [[Taiwanese nationalism]]\n****Note: [[Kinmen]] is currently ruled by the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]], so it and Taiwan are ''de facto'' already united. However, Kinmen's history is highly distinct from Taiwan's, and they've only really had a shared history since 1949, when the [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|Republic of China retreated to Taiwan]]. Furthermore, Kinmen's recent history has been largely shaped by military conflict between the ROC and the PRC and by the fact that [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] was abolished in Kinmen in 1992, five years after it was abolished in Taiwan (in 1987). If the \"[[Taiwan independence movement|Republic of Taiwan]]\" were to be established, many people are uncertain of whether Kinmen should be included in this new country.

Kinmen is viewed by the Chinese (PRC) government as a place where Chinese (re)unification experiments can be conducted, in preparation for the ultimate goal of annexing the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]]. The Kinmen County government has frequently clashed with the [[Mainland Affairs Council|Taiwan Mainland Affairs Council]] (which oversees relations with the PRC) over its willingness to allow the Chinese (PRC) government to infiltrate its society, economy, politics, cultural institutions, religious institutions, educational institutions, and local communities. It is unknown what percentage of Kinmenese society supports this movement but it is known that the Kinmen County government supports this movement and that it has been actively pushing for Kinmen's annexation into China (PRC).\n*** Area of Kinmen: Roughly 150&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n***Population of Kinmen: Roughly 130,000 people\n\n'''Chinese (re)unification under the ROC'''\n\n{{See also|Three Principles of the People|Project National Glory|Communist bandit}}\n\nThis is a variant of the Chinese (re)unification movement that advocates for the ROC to become the ruling regime of China again, replacing the PRC.

It advocates for the (re)unification of China (PRC) and Taiwan (ROC) under a hypothetical \"New China\". Proponents of this movement believe that both the PRC and the ROC have expired and that the only logical solution that is fair to both parties is to overthrow both regimes and replace them with a single \"New China\" regime that possesses characteristics of both the PRC and the ROC, as well as its own unique traits. Visions for such a \"New China\" range from a \"[[dictatorship]]\" to a \"[[democracy]]\".

The first floor consists of two 50-seat lecture halls, two 50-seat active learning classrooms, a bicycle storage room, a 24-seat biomaterials teaching lab, a cafe, and a 280-seat auditorium. The building also has a central atrium which extends through all 6 floors and contains the main spiral staircase. Floors 2-5 house an array of experimental labs on the rectangular half of the building and contain several offices and conference rooms on the rounded half of the building across the atrium. The 6th floor is structurally similar to floors 2\u20135, but house computational research facilities in place of the laboratories. The north corner of floors 3-6 contain a computational research room, and floor 2 has a lab classroom in the same corner.\n\n== Architecture ==\n=== Construction ===\nThe ISEC building was constructed for collaboration and research. The central body of the building consists of a large atrium that extends from the ground floor to the six-story ceiling. Much of the research space which borders this main atrium is completely visible to observers, allowing for high levels of transparency between the public and different disciplines. Open spaces of collaboration and \"research on display\" define much of the complex.\n\nISEC was constructed on an urban brownfield site that was formerly a parking lot set between the Columbus Ave and Renaissance Park Garages. Set between Boston's historic Roxbury  and Fenway neighborhoods, The facility serves to connect two areas that were for the most part separated by the Amtrak and MBTA rail lines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.payette.com/project/interdisciplinary-science-and-engineering-complex/|title=Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Complex \u2013 Payette|website=www.payette.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-29}}</ref>\n\n== Influence and impact ==\n=== University profile ===\nCompletion of the ISEC facility signifies a major shift in the culture, history, and trajectory of Northeastern University. In the period from 2006\u20132016, its ranking as measured by U.S. News & World Report rose from 98th to 39th. The school reports having received 50,000 applications for 2,300 places last year.

Researchers, students, faculty, administrators, and executives of various research institutions attended the grand opening along with a protesting student environmental group, DivestNU.\n\nDivestNU is a student organization that advocates for Northeastern's administration to divest the university's endowments from the fossil fuel industry.

The first floor consists of two 50-seat lecture halls, two 50-seat active learning classrooms, a bicycle storage room, a 24-seat biomaterials teaching lab, a cafe, and a 280-seat auditorium. The building also has a central atrium which extends through all 6 floors and contains the main spiral staircase. Floors 2-5 house an array of experimental labs on the rectangular half of the building and contain several offices and conference rooms on the rounded half of the building across the atrium. The 6th floor is structurally similar to floors 2-5, but house computational research facilities in place of the laboratories. The north corner of floors 3-6 contain a computational research room, and floor 2 has a lab classroom in the same corner.\n\n== Architecture ==\n=== Construction ===\nThe ISEC building was constructed for collaboration and research. The central body of the building consists of a large atrium that extends from the ground floor to the six-story ceiling. Much of the research space which borders this main atrium is completely visible to observers, allowing for high levels of transparency between the public and different disciplines. Open spaces of collaboration and \"research on display\" define much of the complex.\n\nISEC was constructed on an urban brownfield site that was formerly a parking lot set between the Columbus Ave and Renaissance Park Garages. Set between Boston's historic Roxbury  and Fenway neighborhoods, The facility serves to connect two areas that were for the most part separated by the Amtrak and MBTA rail lines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.payette.com/project/interdisciplinary-science-and-engineering-complex/|title=Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Complex \u2013 Payette|website=www.payette.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-29}}</ref>\n\n== Influence and impact ==\n=== University profile ===\nCompletion of the ISEC facility signifies a major shift in the culture, history, and trajectory of Northeastern University.

However, as production has become increasingly international and the import/export market between nations has flourished, Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) models have been developed. The unique feature of MRIO is allowing a product to be traced across its production cycle, \"quantifying the contributions to the value of the product from different economic sectors in various countries represented in the model. It hence offers a description of the global supply chains of products consumed\".<ref name=\"Hertwich 2010 3\"/> From this, assuming regional- and industry-specific data for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit of output are available, the total amount of emissions for the product can be calculated, and therefore the amount of emissions the final consumer is allocated responsibility for.<ref name=\"Davis and Caldeira 2010\" />\n\nThe two methodologies of emissions accounting begin to expose their key differences. Production-based accounting is transparently consistent with GDP, whereas consumption-based accounting (more complex and uncertain) is consistent with national consumption and trade. However, the most important difference is that the latter covers global emissions - including those [[embedded emissions|\u2018embodied\u2019 emissions]] that are omitted in production-based accounting - and offers globally based mitigation options.<ref name=\"Peters and Hertwich 2008a.\" /> Thus the attribution of emissions embodied in international trade is the crux of the matter.<ref name=\"Davis and Caldeira 2010\" />\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Davis and Caldeira World Trade Flux Map.png|thumbnail|right|upright=2.0|Figure 1.

Figure 1 shows the international trade flows of the top 10 countries with largest trade fluxes in 2004 and illustrates the dominance of trade from developing countries (principally China, Russia and India) to developed countries (principally USA, EU and Japan). Table 3 supports this showing that the traded emissions in 2008 total 7.8 gigatonnes (Gt) with a net CO<sub>2</sub> emissions trade from developing to developed countries of 1.6 Gt.\n\nTable 3 also shows how these processes of production, consumption and trade have changed from 1990 (commonly chosen for baseline levels) to 2008. Global emissions have risen 39%, but in the same period developed countries seem to have stabilized their domestic emissions, whereas developing countries\u2019 domestic emissions have doubled. This \u2018stabilization\u2019 is arguably misleading, however, if the increased trade from developing to developed countries is considered. This has increased from 0.4 Gt CO<sub>2</sub> to 1.6 Gt CO<sub>2</sub> - a 17%/year average growth meaning 16 Gt CO<sub>2</sub> have been traded from developing to developed countries between 1990\u20132008. Assuming a proportion of the increased production in developing countries is to fulfil the consumption demands of developed countries, the process known as carbon leakage becomes evident. Thus, including international trade (i.e. the methodology of consumption-based accounting) reverses the apparent decreasing trend in emissions in developed countries, changing a 2% decrease (as calculated by production-based accounting) into a 7% increase across the time period.<ref name=\"Caldeira and Davis 2011\">{{cite journal|last=Caldeira|first=K.|author2=Davis, S.J.|title=Accounting for carbon dioxide emissions: A matter of time|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2011|volume=108|issue=21|doi=10.1073/pnas.1106517108|pmid=21562217|pages=8533\u20138534|pmc=3102393}}</ref> This point is only further emphasized when these trends are studied at a less aggregated scale.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" | style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;font-size:90%\"\n|+ align=\"bottom\" |Table 3.

In general, production-based accounting proposes lower emissions for the [[European Union|EU]] and [[OECD]] countries (developed countries) and higher emissions for [[BRIC]] and [[Rest of the world|RoW]] (developing countries). However, consumption-based accounting proposes the reverse with lower emissions in BRIC and RoW, and higher emissions in EU and OECD countries.<ref name=\"Boitier 2012\" /> This led Boitier<ref name=\"Boitier 2012 p8\">{{cite journal|last=Boitier|first=B.|title=CO<sub>2</sub> emissions production-based accounting vs consumption: Insights from the WIOD databases|pages=8|year=2012|series=WIOD Conference Paper, April|url=http://www.wiod.org/conferences/groningen/paper_Boitier.pdf}}</ref> to term EU and OECD \u2018CO<sub>2</sub> consumers\u2019 and BRIC and RoW \u2018CO<sub>2</sub> producers\u2019.\n\nThe large difference in these results is corroborated by further analysis. The [[European Union|EU-27]] in 1994 counted emissions using the consumption-based approach at 11% higher than those counted using the production-based approach, this difference rising to 24% in 2008. Similarly OECD countries reached a peak variance of 16% in 2006 whilst dropping to 14% in 2008. In contrast, although RoW starts and ends relatively equal, in the intervening years it is a clear CO<sub>2</sub> producer, as are BRIC with an average consumption-based emissions deficit of 18.5% compared to production-based emissions.\n\nPeters and Hertwich<ref name=\"Peters and Hertwich 2008b\" /> completed a MRIO study to calculate emissions embodied in international trade using data from the 2001 Global Trade Analysis Program (GTAP). After manipulation, although their numbers are slightly more conservative (EU 14%; OECD 3%; BRIC 16%; RoW 6%) than Boitier<ref name=\"Boitier 2012\" /> the same trend is evident - developed countries are CO<sub>2</sub> consumers and developing countries are CO<sub>2</sub> producers.

Other key advantages include: extending mitigation options, covering more global emissions through increased participation, and inherently encompassing policies such as the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM).<ref name=\"Peters 2008\" />\n\n==== Extending mitigation options ====\nUnder the production-based system a country is punished for having a pollution intensive resource base. If this country has pollution intensive exports, such as Norway where 69% of its CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are the result of production for export,<ref name=\"Peters and Hertwich 2006a\">{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=G.P.|author2=Hertwich, E.G.|title=Structural analysis of international trade: environmental impacts of Norway|journal=Economic Systems Research|year=2006|volume=18|issue=2|doi=10.1080/09535310600653008|pages=155\u2013181}}</ref> a simple way to meet its emissions reductions set out under Kyoto would be to reduce its exports. Although this would be environmentally advantageous, it would be economically and politically harmful as exports are an important part of a country's GDP.<ref name=\"Peters 2008\" /> However, by having appropriate mechanisms in place, such as a [[Carbon tax#Harmonized carbon taxes|harmonized global tax]], [[Carbon tax#Border adjustments, tariffs and bans|border-tax adjustment or quotas]], a consumption-based accounting system could shift the [[comparative advantage]] towards a decision that includes environmental factors.<ref name=\"Peters and Hertwich 2006b\">{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=G.P.|author2=Hertwich, E.G.|title=Pollution embodied in trade: The Norwegian case|journal=Global Environmental Change|year=2006|volume=16|issue=4|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2006.03.001|pages=379\u2013387}}</ref> The tax most discussed is based on the carbon content of the fossil fuels used to produce and transport the product, the greater the level of carbon used the more tax being charged. If a country did not voluntarily participate then a border tax could be imposed on them.<ref name=\"Peters and Hertwich 2008a.\" /> This system would have the effect of embedding the cost of environmental load in the price of the product and therefore market forces would shift production to where it is economically and environmentally preferable, thus reducing GHG emissions.\n\n==== Increasing participation ====\n\nIn addition to reducing emissions directly this system may also alleviate [[Competition|competitiveness]] concerns in twofold ways: firstly, domestic and foreign producers are exposed to the same carbon tax; and secondly, if multiple countries are competing for the same export market they can promote environmental performance as a marketing tool.<ref name=\"Peters and Hertwich 2008a.\" /> A loss of competitiveness resulting from the absence of legally binding commitments for non-Annex B countries was the principal reason the US and Australia, two heavily emitting countries,  did not originally ratify the [[Kyoto protocol]] (Australia later ratified in 2007).<ref name=\"Tjernshaugen 2005\">{{cite journal|last=Tjernshaugen|first=A.|title=United States participation in future climate agreements: an assessment|journal=CICERO Policy Note 2005:01, CICERO|year=2005|url=https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/32742}}</ref> By alleviating such concerns more countries may participate in future climate policies resulting in a greater percentage of global emissions being covered by legally binding reduction policies. Furthermore, as developed countries are currently expected to reduce their emissions more than developing countries, the more emissions are (fairly) attributed to developed countries the more they become covered by legally bound reduction policies. Peters<ref name=\"Peters 2008\" /> argues that this last prediction means that consumption-based accounting would advantageously result in greater emissions reductions irrespective of increased participation.\n\n==== Encompassing policies such as the CDM ====\n\nThe [[Clean Development Mechanism|CDM]] is a flexible mechanism set up under the Kyoto Protocol with the aim of creating \u2018[[Carbon Credits]]\u2019 for trade in trading schemes such as the [[EU ETS]]. Despite coming under heavy criticism (see Evans,<ref name=\"Evans 2012\">{{cite book|last=Evans|first=J.|title=Environmental governance|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415589826|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KEU8YgEACAAJ|edition=1st}}</ref> p134-135; and Burniaux et al.,<ref name=\"Burniaux et al 2009\">{{cite journal|last=Burniaux|first=J.M.|author2=Chateau, J. |author3=Dellink, R. |author4=Duval, R. |author5=Jamet, S. |title=The economics of climate change mitigation: how to build the necessary global action in a cost-effective manner|journal=Economics Department Working Papers|year=2009|volume=701|url=http://search.oecd.org/officialdocuments/displaydocumentpdf/?doclanguage=en&cote=eco/wkp(2009)42}}</ref> p58-65), the theory is that as the marginal cost of environmental abatement is lower in non-Annex B countries a scheme like this will promote [[technology transfer]] from Annex B to non-Annex B countries resulting in cheaper emissions reductions. Because under consumption-based emissions accounting a country is responsible for the emissions caused by its imports, it is important for the importing country to encourage good environmental behaviour and promote the cleanest production technologies available in the exporting country.<ref name=\"Peters and Hertwich 2008a.\" /> Therefore, unlike the Kyoto Protocol where the CDM was added later, consumption-based emissions accounting inherently promotes clean development in the foreign country because of the way it allocates emissions. One loophole that remains relevant is \u2018[[Carbon emission trading#Criticisms|carbon colonialism]]\u2019 whereby developed countries do not mitigate the underlying problem but simply continue to increase consumption offsetting this by exploiting the abatement potential of developing countries.<ref name=\"Harvey 2007\">{{cite web|last=Harvey|first=F.|title=Beware the carbon offsetting cowboys|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dcdefef6-f350-11db-9845-000b5df10621.html#axzz2YewBjlDl|work=Financial Times|access-date=10 July 2013|year=2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Disadvantages and implementation ===\nDespite its advantages consumption-based emissions accounting is not without its drawbacks. These were highlighted above and in Table 1 and are principally: greater uncertainty, greater complexity requiring more data not always available, and requiring greater international collaboration.\n\n==== Greater uncertainty and complexity ====\nUncertainty derives from three main reasons: production-based accounting is much closer to statistical sources and GDP which are more assured; the methodology behind consumption-based accounting requires an extra step over production-based accounting, this step inherently incurring further doubt; and consumption-based accounting includes data from all trading partners of a particular country which will contain different levels of accuracy.<ref name=\"Peters and Hertwich 2008a.\" /><ref name=\"Peters 2008\" /> The bulk of data required is its second pitfall as in some countries the lack of data means consumption-based accounting is not possible. However, it must be noted levels and accuracy of data will improve as more and better techniques are developed and the scientific community produce more data sets - examples including the recently launched global databases: EORA from the University of Sydney, EXIOPOL and WIOD databases from European consortia, and the Asian IDE-JETRO.<ref name=\"Marques et al 2012\">{{cite journal|last=Marques|first=A.|author2=Rodrigues, J. |author3=Lenzen, M. |author4=Domingos, T. |title=Income-based environmental responsibility|journal=Ecological Economics|year=2012|volume=84|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.09.010 |pages=57\u201365}}</ref> In the short term it will be important to attempt to quantify the level of uncertainty more accurately.<ref name=\"Peters and Hertwich 2008a.\" />\n\n==== Greater international co-operation ====\n\nThe third problem is that consumption-based accounting requires greater international collaboration to deliver effective results. A Government has the authority to implement policies only over emissions it directly generates. In consumption-based accounting emissions from different geo-political territories are allocated to the importing country. Although the importing country can indirectly oppose this by changing its importing habits or by applying a border tax as discussed, only by greater international collaboration, through an international dialogue such as the UNFCCC, can direct and meaningful emissions reductions be enforced.<ref name=\"Peters and Hertwich 2008a.\" />\n\n== Sharing emissions responsibility ==\n\nThus far it has been implied that one must implement either production-based accounting or consumption-based accounting.<ref name=\"Andrew and Forgie 2008\">{{cite journal|last=Andrew|first=A.R.|author2=Forgie, V.|title=A three-perspective view of greenhouse gas emission responsibilities in New Zealand|journal=Ecological Economics|year=2008|volume=68|issue=1\u20132|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2008.02.016|pages=194\u2013204}}</ref> However, there are arguments that the answer lies somewhere in the middle i.e. emissions should be shared between the importing and exporting countries. This approach asserts that although it is the final consumer that ultimately initiates the production, the activities that create the product and associated pollution also contribute to the producing country's GDP. This topic is still developing in the literature principally through works by Rodrigues et al.,<ref name=\"Rodrigues et al 2006\">{{cite journal|last=Rodrigues|first=J.|author2=Domingos, T. |author3=Giljum, S. |author4=Schneider, F. |title=Designing an indicator of environmental responsibility|journal=Ecological Economics|year=2006|volume=59|issue=3|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.10.002 |pages=256\u2013266}}</ref> Lenzen et al.,<ref name=\"Lenzen et al 2007\">{{cite journal|last=Lenzen|first=M.|author2=Murray, J. |author3=Sack, F. |author4=Wiedmann, T. |title=Shared producer and consumer responsibility \u2014 Theory and practice|journal=Ecological Economics|year=2007|volume=61|issue=1|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2006.05.018 |pages=27\u201342}}</ref> Marques et al.<ref name=\"Marques et al 2012\" /> as well as through empirical studies by such as Andrew and Forgie.<ref name=\"Andrew and Forgie 2008\" /> Crucially it proposes that at each stage of the supply chain the emissions are shared by some pre-defined criteria between the different actors involved.<ref name=\"Marques et al 2012\" />\n\nWhilst this approach of sharing emissions responsibility seems advantageous, the controversy arises over what these pre-defined criteria should be.

As no criteria set has been adequately developed and further work is needed to produce a finished methodology for a potentially valuable concept.\n\n== The future ==\n{{POV section|date=December 2019}}\nMeasures of regions' GHG emissions are critical to climate policy. It is clear that production-based emissions accounting, the currently favoured method for policy-making, significantly underestimates the level of GHG emitted by excluding emissions embodied in international trade. Implementing consumption-based accounting which includes such emissions, developed countries take a greater share of GHG emissions and consequently the low level of emissions commitments for developing countries are not as important.<ref name=\"Peters and Hertwich 2008a.\" /> Not only does consumption-based accounting encompass global emissions, it promotes good environmental behaviour and increases participation by reducing competitiveness.\n\nDespite these advantages the shift from production-based to consumption-based accounting arguably represents a shift from one extreme to another.<ref name=\"Peters 2008\" /> The third option of sharing responsibility between importing and exporting countries represents a compromise between the two systems. However,  as yet no adequately developed methodology exists for this third way, so further study is required before it can be implemented for policy-making decisions.\n\nToday, given its lower uncertainty, established methodology and reporting, consistency between political and environmental boundaries, and widespread implementation, it is hard to see any movement away from the favoured production-based accounting.<ref name=\"Peters 2008\" /> However, because of its key disadvantage of omitting emissions embodied in international trade, it is clear that consumption-based accounting provides invaluable information and should at least be used as a \u2018shadow\u2019 to production-based accounting. With further work into the methodologies of consumption-based accounting and sharing emissions responsibility, both can play greater roles in the future of climate policy.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Carbon footprint]]\n*[[Environmental economics]]\n*[[Global warming]]\n*[[Kyoto Protocol]]\n*[[Paris Agreement]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Global warming}}\n\n[[Category:Greenhouse gas inventories]]\n[[Category:Climate change]]\n", "text_old": "{{Update|type=|date=January 2020|reason=}}\n\n'''Greenhouse gas emissions accounting''' designate the measuring of the amount of [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gases]] (GHG) [[Emission of greenhouse gases|emitted]] by a region or an entity (most often a country) during a given period of time.

However, as production has become increasingly international and the import/export market between nations has flourished, Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) models have been developed. The unique feature of MRIO is allowing a product to be traced across its production cycle, \"quantifying the contributions to the value of the product from different economic sectors in various countries represented in the model. It hence offers a description of the global supply chains of products consumed\".<ref name=\"Hertwich 2010 3\"/> From this, assuming regional- and industry-specific data for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit of output are available, the total amount of emissions for the product can be calculated, and therefore the amount of emissions the final consumer is allocated responsibility for.<ref name=\"Davis and Caldeira 2010\" />\n\nThe two methodologies of emissions accounting begin to expose their key differences. Production-based accounting is transparently consistent with GDP, whereas consumption-based accounting (more complex and uncertain) is consistent with national consumption and trade. However, the most important difference is that the latter covers global emissions - including those [[embedded emissions|\u2018embodied\u2019 emissions]] that are omitted in production-based accounting - and offers globally based mitigation options.<ref name=\"Peters and Hertwich 2008a.\" /> Thus the attribution of emissions embodied in international trade is the crux of the matter.<ref name=\"Davis and Caldeira 2010\" />\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Davis and Caldeira World Trade Flux Map.png|thumbnail|right|upright=2.0|Figure 1.

Figure 1 shows the international trade flows of the top 10 countries with largest trade fluxes in 2004 and illustrates the dominance of trade from developing countries (principally China, Russia and India) to developed countries (principally USA, EU and Japan). Table 3 supports this showing that the traded emissions in 2008 total 7.8 gigatonnes (Gt) with a net CO<sub>2</sub> emissions trade from developing to developed countries of 1.6 Gt.\n\nTable 3 also shows how these processes of production, consumption and trade have changed from 1990 (commonly chosen for baseline levels) to 2008. Global emissions have risen 39%, but in the same period developed countries seem to have stabilized their domestic emissions, whereas developing countries\u2019 domestic emissions have doubled. This \u2018stabilization\u2019 is arguably misleading, however, if the increased trade from developing to developed countries is considered. This has increased from 0.4 Gt CO<sub>2</sub> to 1.6 Gt CO<sub>2</sub> - a 17%/year average growth meaning 16 Gt CO<sub>2</sub> have been traded from developing to developed countries between 1990-2008. Assuming a proportion of the increased production in developing countries is to fulfil the consumption demands of developed countries, the process known as carbon leakage becomes evident. Thus, including international trade (i.e. the methodology of consumption-based accounting) reverses the apparent decreasing trend in emissions in developed countries, changing a 2% decrease (as calculated by production-based accounting) into a 7% increase across the time period.<ref name=\"Caldeira and Davis 2011\">{{cite journal|last=Caldeira|first=K.|author2=Davis, S.J.|title=Accounting for carbon dioxide emissions: A matter of time|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2011|volume=108|issue=21|doi=10.1073/pnas.1106517108|pmid=21562217|pages=8533\u20138534|pmc=3102393}}</ref> This point is only further emphasized when these trends are studied at a less aggregated scale.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" | style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;font-size:90%\"\n|+ align=\"bottom\" |Table 3.

If a country did not voluntarily participate then a border tax could be imposed on them.<ref name=\"Peters and Hertwich 2008a.\" /> This system would have the effect of embedding the cost of environmental load in the price of the product and therefore market forces would shift production to where it is economically and environmentally preferable, thus reducing GHG emissions.\n\n==== Increasing participation ====\n\nIn addition to reducing emissions directly this system may also alleviate [[Competition|competitiveness]] concerns in twofold ways: firstly, domestic and foreign producers are exposed to the same carbon tax; and secondly, if multiple countries are competing for the same export market they can promote environmental performance as a marketing tool.<ref name=\"Peters and Hertwich 2008a.\" /> A loss of competitiveness resulting from the absence of legally binding commitments for non-Annex B countries was the principal reason the US and Australia, two heavily emitting countries,  did not originally ratify the [[Kyoto protocol]] (Australia later ratified in 2007).<ref name=\"Tjernshaugen 2005\">{{cite journal|last=Tjernshaugen|first=A.|title=United States participation in future climate agreements: an assessment|journal=CICERO Policy Note 2005:01, CICERO|year=2005|url=https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/32742}}</ref> By alleviating such concerns more countries may participate in future climate policies resulting in a greater percentage of global emissions being covered by legally binding reduction policies. Furthermore, as developed countries are currently expected to reduce their emissions more than developing countries, the more emissions are (fairly) attributed to developed countries the more they become covered by legally bound reduction policies. Peters<ref name=\"Peters 2008\" /> argues that this last prediction means that consumption-based accounting would advantageously result in greater emissions reductions irrespective of increased participation.\n\n==== Encompassing policies such as the CDM ====\n\nThe [[Clean Development Mechanism|CDM]] is a flexible mechanism set up under the Kyoto Protocol with the aim of creating \u2018[[Carbon Credits]]\u2019 for trade in trading schemes such as the [[EU ETS]]. Despite coming under heavy criticism (see Evans,<ref name=\"Evans 2012\">{{cite book|last=Evans|first=J.|title=Environmental governance|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415589826|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KEU8YgEACAAJ|edition=1st}}</ref> p134-135; and Burniaux et al.,<ref name=\"Burniaux et al 2009\">{{cite journal|last=Burniaux|first=J.M.|author2=Chateau, J. |author3=Dellink, R. |author4=Duval, R. |author5=Jamet, S. |title=The economics of climate change mitigation: how to build the necessary global action in a cost-effective manner|journal=Economics Department Working Papers|year=2009|volume=701|url=http://search.oecd.org/officialdocuments/displaydocumentpdf/?doclanguage=en&cote=eco/wkp(2009)42}}</ref> p58-65), the theory is that as the marginal cost of environmental abatement is lower in non-Annex B countries a scheme like this will promote [[technology transfer]] from Annex B to non-Annex B countries resulting in cheaper emissions reductions. Because under consumption-based emissions accounting a country is responsible for the emissions caused by its imports, it is important for the importing country to encourage good environmental behaviour and promote the cleanest production technologies available in the exporting country.<ref name=\"Peters and Hertwich 2008a.\" /> Therefore, unlike the Kyoto Protocol where the CDM was added later, consumption-based emissions accounting inherently promotes clean development in the foreign country because of the way it allocates emissions. One loophole that remains relevant is \u2018[[Carbon emission trading#Criticisms|carbon colonialism]]\u2019 whereby developed countries do not mitigate the underlying problem but simply continue to increase consumption offsetting this by exploiting the abatement potential of developing countries.<ref name=\"Harvey 2007\">{{cite web|last=Harvey|first=F.|title=Beware the carbon offsetting cowboys|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dcdefef6-f350-11db-9845-000b5df10621.html#axzz2YewBjlDl|work=Financial Times|access-date=10 July 2013|year=2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Disadvantages and implementation ===\nDespite its advantages consumption-based emissions accounting is not without its drawbacks. These were highlighted above and in Table 1 and are principally: greater uncertainty, greater complexity requiring more data not always available, and requiring greater international collaboration.\n\n==== Greater uncertainty and complexity ====\nUncertainty derives from three main reasons: production-based accounting is much closer to statistical sources and GDP which are more assured; the methodology behind consumption-based accounting requires an extra step over production-based accounting, this step inherently incurring further doubt; and consumption-based accounting includes data from all trading partners of a particular country which will contain different levels of accuracy.<ref name=\"Peters and Hertwich 2008a.\" /><ref name=\"Peters 2008\" /> The bulk of data required is its second pitfall as in some countries the lack of data means consumption-based accounting is not possible. However, it must be noted levels and accuracy of data will improve as more and better techniques are developed and the scientific community produce more data sets - examples including the recently launched global databases: EORA from the University of Sydney, EXIOPOL and WIOD databases from European consortia, and the Asian IDE-JETRO.<ref name=\"Marques et al 2012\">{{cite journal|last=Marques|first=A.|author2=Rodrigues, J. |author3=Lenzen, M. |author4=Domingos, T. |title=Income-based environmental responsibility|journal=Ecological Economics|year=2012|volume=84|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.09.010 |pages=57\u201365}}</ref> In the short term it will be important to attempt to quantify the level of uncertainty more accurately.<ref name=\"Peters and Hertwich 2008a.\" />\n\n==== Greater international co-operation ====\n\nThe third problem is that consumption-based accounting requires greater international collaboration to deliver effective results. A Government has the authority to implement policies only over emissions it directly generates. In consumption-based accounting emissions from different geo-political territories are allocated to the importing country. Although the importing country can indirectly oppose this by changing its importing habits or by applying a border tax as discussed, only by greater international collaboration, through an international dialogue such as the UNFCCC, can direct and meaningful emissions reductions be enforced.<ref name=\"Peters and Hertwich 2008a.\" />\n\n== Sharing emissions responsibility ==\n\nThus far it has been implied that one must implement either production-based accounting or consumption-based accounting.<ref name=\"Andrew and Forgie 2008\">{{cite journal|last=Andrew|first=A.R.|author2=Forgie, V.|title=A three-perspective view of greenhouse gas emission responsibilities in New Zealand|journal=Ecological Economics|year=2008|volume=68|issue=1\u20132|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2008.02.016|pages=194\u2013204}}</ref> However, there are arguments that the answer lies somewhere in the middle i.e. emissions should be shared between the importing and exporting countries. This approach asserts that although it is the final consumer that ultimately initiates the production, the activities that create the product and associated pollution also contribute to the producing country's GDP. This topic is still developing in the literature principally through works by Rodrigues et al.,<ref name=\"Rodrigues et al 2006\">{{cite journal|last=Rodrigues|first=J.|author2=Domingos, T. |author3=Giljum, S. |author4=Schneider, F. |title=Designing an indicator of environmental responsibility|journal=Ecological Economics|year=2006|volume=59|issue=3|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.10.002 |pages=256\u2013266}}</ref> Lenzen et al.,<ref name=\"Lenzen et al 2007\">{{cite journal|last=Lenzen|first=M.|author2=Murray, J. |author3=Sack, F. |author4=Wiedmann, T. |title=Shared producer and consumer responsibility \u2014 Theory and practice|journal=Ecological Economics|year=2007|volume=61|issue=1|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2006.05.018 |pages=27\u201342}}</ref> Marques et al.<ref name=\"Marques et al 2012\" /> as well as through empirical studies by such as Andrew and Forgie.<ref name=\"Andrew and Forgie 2008\" /> Crucially it proposes that at each stage of the supply chain the emissions are shared by some pre-defined criteria between the different actors involved.<ref name=\"Marques et al 2012\" />\n\nWhilst this approach of sharing emissions responsibility seems advantageous, the controversy arises over what these pre-defined criteria should be. Two of the current front runners are Lenzen et al.<ref name=\"Lenzen et al 2007\" /> who say \u201cthe share of responsibility allocated to each agent should be proportional to its value added\u201d and Rodrigues et al.<ref name=\"Rodrigues et al 2006\" /> who say it should be based on \u201cthe average between an agent's consumption-based responsibility and income-based responsibility\u201d (quoted in Marques et al.<ref name=\"Marques et al 2012 p60\">{{cite journal|last=Marques|first=A.|author2=Rodrigues, J. |author3=Lenzen, M. |author4=Domingos, T. |title=Income-based environmental responsibility|journal=Ecological Economics|year=2012|volume=84|pages=57\u201365|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.09.010}}</ref>). As no criteria set has been adequately developed and further work is needed to produce a finished methodology for a potentially valuable concept.\n\n== The future ==\n{{POV section|date=December 2019}}\nMeasures of regions' GHG emissions are critical to climate policy. It is clear that production-based emissions accounting, the currently favoured method for policy-making, significantly underestimates the level of GHG emitted by excluding emissions embodied in international trade. Implementing consumption-based accounting which includes such emissions, developed countries take a greater share of GHG emissions and consequently the low level of emissions commitments for developing countries are not as important.<ref name=\"Peters and Hertwich 2008a.\" /> Not only does consumption-based accounting encompass global emissions, it promotes good environmental behaviour and increases participation by reducing competitiveness.\n\nDespite these advantages the shift from production-based to consumption-based accounting arguably represents a shift from one extreme to another.<ref name=\"Peters 2008\" /> The third option of sharing responsibility between importing and exporting countries represents a compromise between the two systems. However,  as yet no adequately developed methodology exists for this third way, so further study is required before it can be implemented for policy-making decisions.\n\nToday, given its lower uncertainty, established methodology and reporting, consistency between political and environmental boundaries, and widespread implementation, it is hard to see any movement away from the favoured production-based accounting.<ref name=\"Peters 2008\" /> However, because of its key disadvantage of omitting emissions embodied in international trade, it is clear that consumption-based accounting provides invaluable information and should at least be used as a \u2018shadow\u2019 to production-based accounting. With further work into the methodologies of consumption-based accounting and sharing emissions responsibility, both can play greater roles in the future of climate policy.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Carbon footprint]]\n*[[Environmental economics]]\n*[[Global warming]]\n*[[Kyoto Protocol]]\n*[[Paris Agreement]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Global warming}}\n\n[[Category:Greenhouse gas inventories]]\n[[Category:Climate change]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: longer term \u2192 longer-term, 1-3 \u2192 1\u20133, 1990-95 \u2192 1990\u201395 (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions_accounting"}
