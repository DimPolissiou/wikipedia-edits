He is recorded as being present at the reception of [[Anne of Cleves]], and together with his father, he served at the [[Sieges of Boulogne (1544\u201346)|Siege of Boulogne]]. He was given the manor of [[Calstone]] near [[Calne]] in 1538 in a grant by Henry VIII, and at least part of this land was still controlled by the Long family in 1704, when the rent from one farm called Tossells was used for a Draycot charity.\n\nHe was appointed [[High Sheriff of Wiltshire]] in 1575, during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].\n\nHe married Barbara Carne c. 1546 and they had one daughter and four sons including: \n*[[Walter Long (died 1610)|Sir Walter Long]] (d.1610)\n*Jewel Long (d.1647), whose godfather was the Bishop of Salisbury [[John Jewel]]\n*Henry Long, murdered 1594\n\nSir Robert Long died at Draycot in 1581 and his wife died at [[Bulford]] in 1605.\n\n== Murder of his son ==\nSir Robert's son Henry was murdered by [[Sir Charles Danvers]] and [[Henry Danvers, 1st Earl of Danby|Sir Henry Danvers]], after a long-running feud between the neighbouring Danvers' and the Longs, in particular, Henry and his brother Sir Walter Long.  The mutual animosity came to a head in 1594, when their father Sir John Danvers, from the magistrate's bench, committed one of Sir Walter Long's servants for robbery. Sir Walter rescued the servant from the justice, and, after complaining to the judge at the next [[assizes]], Sir John had Sir Walter locked up in the [[Fleet Prison]]. He then committed another of Sir Walter's servants on a charge of murder. On leaving prison, Sir Walter and his brother provoked various brawls between their own followers and Sir John's, resulting in one servant being killed and another grievously wounded.\n\n=== History of the feud ===\nSir John Danvers was one of the executors of Sir Robert Long's will, indicating that perhaps the feud was started between the sons, and had not been carried over from a previous generation, although in his book ''William Shakespeare: The Man Behind the Genius'', author [[Anthony Holden]] contends the feud dated as far back as the [[Wars of the Roses]]. Another author<ref>Society, Politics and Culture: Studies in Early Modern England (Past and Present Publications), Mervyn Evans James 1988</ref> writes that it began as a result of the attempts of Sir Walter Long \u2013 recently returned from military service in Ireland, strengthened by his marriage to Catherine Thynne of [[Longleat]], and with one of his houses, Draycot, only a few miles from the Danvers seat at Dauncey \u2013 to challenge the Danvers' predominance. Sir Charles Danvers developed a close friendship with [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]], and served under him in Ireland, later taking a prominent part in the revolt there. On the other hand, Sir Walter Long, through his Thynne connection, developed a friendship with Sir [[Walter Raleigh]], who was deeply hostile to Essex.<ref>John Aubrey, Letters... by Eminent Persons and Lives of Eminent Men 1813</ref> There was an established conservative group of gentry with whom the Danvers' associated, and who were opposed to the rival Knyvet-Long faction, which was backed by the Thynnes at Longleat.\n\n=== Unendurable insults ===\nIt was the Danvers family itself, and not their followers, that were the target of the Longs, and Henry Long wrote insulting letters to Sir Charles Danvers calling him a liar, a fool, a puppy dog, a mere boy, and promised that he would whip his bare backside with a rod. Sir Charles was very angry. His mother later wrote to [[Lord Burghley]] describing the letters as 'of such a form as the heart of a man indeed had rather die than endure'.  Accompanied by his brother and some of his men, he went to an inn at [[Corsham]] where Sir Walter and Henry Long were dining with a group of magistrates.  Sir Henry Danvers drew his pistol, ('a certain engine called a dagge') and shortly after Henry Long was dead. The Danvers brothers got away and took refuge with their friend [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton]] at his seat, Whitley Lodge near Titchfield, who happened to be in the midst of his twenty-first birthday celebrations.<ref>William Shakespeare: The Man Behind the Genius \u2013  Anthony Holden 2000 {{ISBN|0-316-51849-2}}</ref>\n\n== Romeo and Juliet? ==\nSouthampton was patron of [[William Shakespeare]] and some literary critics (e.g. [[A.
