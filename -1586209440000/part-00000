The intent of Haig's draft was to place overall responsibility for the direction and implementation of [[U.S. foreign policy]] within the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]]. Relying on his experience in the [[Richard Nixon]] administration, Haig wanted to ensure Department of State control of the interagency groups within the National Security Council (NSC) because they were the \"key [to] the flow of options to the President,\" and thus to policy control.<ref name=\"whitehouse.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/history.html#reagan |title=National Security Council |work=The White House |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010126104800/http://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/history.html |archivedate=2001-01-26 }}</ref>\n\nHaig's initiative, which he repeated on several occasions, was never responded to. Senior members of the White House staff including, Counselor Meese, Chief of Staff [[James A. Baker III]], and [[Michael Deaver]] were concerned that the proposed reorganization took too much power out of the President's hands and that an [[activist]] Secretary of State operating with wide powers could eclipse the President in his public role as the chief enunciator of U.S. foreign policy.  Although the Haig initiative failed, the Secretary of State appeared to achieve for a time broad authority over the formulation of foreign policy. The President placed National Security Advisor [[Richard V. Allen|Richard Allen]]'s office under the supervision of Meese, and for the first time in the history of the NSC, the [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] lost direct access to the President. In subsequent public statements, the President underlined his belief that his Secretary of State was his \"primary adviser on foreign affairs, and in that capacity, he is the chief formulator and spokesman for foreign policy for this administration.\"<ref name=\"whitehouse.gov\"/>\nAllen, who had less personal authority, undertook a role as National Security Advisor that emphasized the \"integration\" of the proposed policies and views of the foreign affairs agencies. Nor did he take on any of the articulation of administration foreign policy (a responsibility left to Secretary Haig who at first thought of himself as the \"[[Vicar]]\" of foreign affairs).\n\n===Attempts to reorganize the NSC===\nChanges were made in the NSC from the outset of the Reagan presidency. At a February 25, 1981, meeting chaired by Meese, Cabinet-level heads of the major foreign affairs agencies agreed on a plan to establish three [[Senior Interdepartmental Groups]] (SIGs) on foreign, defense, and intelligence problems, chaired respectively by the Secretaries of State and [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] and the [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. Under the SIGs, a series of Assistant Secretary-level Interdepartmental Groups (IGs), each chaired by the agency with particular responsibility, dealt with specific issues. The NSC staff was responsible for the assignment of issues to the groups.\n\nOne example of a failed effort to create a new NSC organ in the hopes of improving interagency coordination and reducing friction among the Departments of State and Defense, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], and the NSC, was President Reagan's order on March 24, 1981, naming then [[George H. W. Bush|Vice President George Bush]] as chair of a proposed administration crisis management team. The NSC was charged with providing staff support for this effort. The crisis group, referred to as the [[Special Situation Group]] (SSG) received a formal charter on December 14, 1981, but in fact only met once. Secretary Haig immediately and forcefully complained that the SSG would remove coordinating responsibility from him.\n\nIn another effort to improve policy coordination during the summer of 1981, the President authorized the creation of a [[National Security Planning Group]] (NSPG) composed of the Vice President, the Secretaries of State and Defense, the Director of Central Intelligence, the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and the National Security Advisor. This group met weekly with the President and shaped policy prior to formal meetings of the NSC.\n\n==A \"Mid-Life Crisis\"==\n\nIn January 1982, following the resignation of National Security Advisor Allen, the President appointed a close personal friend, Deputy Secretary of State [[William Clark Jr. (diplomat)|William Clark]], as his new advisor. The brief episode of the weakened National Security Advisor was over. Clark would report directly to the President and not through Meese or the other two members of the triumvirate of Baker and Deaver as Allen had done. President Reagan issued a written directive (NSDD(2)) in January 1982 outlining the structure and functions of the National Security Council. The directive placed responsibility for developing, coordinating, and monitoring national security policy with the National Security Advisor in consultation with the NSC members. It assigned to the Secretary of State \"authority and responsibility\" for the \"overall direction, coordination and supervision of the interdepartmental activities incident to foreign policy formulation, and the activities of executive departments and agencies overseas,\" except for military activities. NSDD(2) delineated the functions of the three SIGs. It designated the Secretary of State as chairman of the Senior Interdepartmental Group for Foreign Policy (SIG(FP)), and established a \"permanent secretariat, composed of personnel of the State Department,\" augmented \"as necessary\" by other agency personnel requested by the Secretary of State, to deal with foreign affairs matters.\n\nTo assist the SIG(FP), the Secretary of State set up [[Interagency Groups]] (IGs) for each geographic region, politico-military affairs, and international economic affairs. The IGs, in turn, created full-time [[working group]]s. The two other SIGs followed a similar structure under the leadership of the Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence. Over the next 5 years, the Reagan administration established an additional 22 SIGs and 55 IGs within the NSC system. Some committees met only once. Observers pointed out the overuse of SIGs and the increasing snarl of responsibilities that led to enterprising NSC officials like [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Oliver North]] developing their own sub-domains within the policy-making system. political analyst, [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], described the NSC as entering its \"[[Mid-Life Crisis]]\" during the Reagan years.\n\n===The NSC under William Clark===\nClark took a very active role in coordination of policy among the agencies in such areas as intelligence and the protection of classified security information. He replaced a number of senior NSC staff members and reorganized his office to create three \"clusters\" to deal with political, military, and intelligence matters. Clark emerged as a major spokesman for Reagan administration foreign policy, particularly with the [[Congress of the United States|Congress]]. He publicly reaffirmed President Reagan's stated policy that the Secretary of State would be the primary \"formulator and enunciator of foreign policy.\" At the same time, however, Clark insisted that the role of the President as the final arbiter on matters of foreign policy be kept in front of the public. He also asserted NSC staff jurisdiction over long-range policy review, formerly a Department of State function.\n\nThe NSC system under Clark did not solve the coordination problems. Friction between the Department of State and the NSC continued and came to a head during the intense debates within the administration over how the United States should act in the [[1982 Lebanon War|Lebanon crisis]] in the spring of 1982 following the Israel invasion. The disputes resulted in Secretary Haig's resignation on June 25, 1982, and President Reagan's appointment of [[George P. Shultz]] as his new Secretary of State. In his July confirmation hearings, Shultz emphasized the primary role of the President in the formulation of policy and stressed the [[collegial]] nature of policy formulation in the Reagan administration. Shultz also referred to the delegation of authority as laid out in NSDD(2) as the source of his own responsibilities and authority.\n\nThe apparent resolution of the dimensions of the Secretary of State's authority ironically coincided with ever-increasing activities in the foreign affairs field. The NSC frequently disagreed with the Department of State over the management of daily U.S. foreign relations problems. One observer called the NSC a \"bee hive of activity.\" An NSC-chaired group took over arms control responsibilities from a State-chaired group (SAC/G) and ramrodded the tough negotiating position favored by ACDA Chief [[Fred Ikle]] and [[Richard Perle]] of the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]]. [[Deputy National Security Advisor (United States)|Deputy National Security Advisor]] [[Robert McFarlane]] replaced [[Philip C. Habib]] as the chief U.S. Middle East negotiator in July 1983, and the National Security Advisor became directly involved in the operations of foreign policy. It led to a major change in how the NSC system worked.\n\nIn October 1983, McFarlane replaced Clark as National Security Advisor, with Admiral [[John Poindexter]] as his deputy. The new National Security Advisor had a background in both military and diplomatic affairs. Retaining the NSC structural changes established by Clark, McFarlane played a highly active role in attempting to compromise interagency disputes. He lacked the personal ties with the President that Clark enjoyed, but continued to have direct Presidential access. During his tenure, the National Security Advisor stepped back from the previous high profile in public policy enunciation, but became more involved in the direct management of key areas of foreign policy.\n\n==Central American Economic Development==\nThe Reagan Administration used a variety of policies and plans to encourage greater democracy in [[Central America]], including  a bold plan for economic development. Reagan's efforts to fund the [[contras]] is well known. In 1985 another effort was serious undertaken to provide economic assistance. Reagan created a National Security Study Directives (NSSD)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/nssd/index.html|title=National Security Study Directives (NSSD) [Reagan Administration, 1981-89]|work=fas.org}}</ref> on January 9, 1985 to study actions that could enhance the fragile economies of Central America.  A senior interagency task force was created headed by [[William Flynn Martin]]. The analysis looked at the factors of stability in the region: the need for security/peace; the need for economic assistance of 8 billion dollars as recommended by Henry Kissinger in a Presidential commission on Central America and the need for the Central American economies to adopt more market oriented, free market policies.  Martin presented the results to the President in early 1985 and the following recommendations were implemented by President Reagan: provide full $8 billion assistance to the region; encourage every US department to provide skills and know how to the region in their area of expertise (i.e. agriculture, energy, transportation, commerce, etc.) and to begin intense engagement to bring about Democratic reforms and market developments that would allow sustainable long-term economic development, against the backdrop of 3.3% population growth per year.

It was an activism run amok in the \"[[Iran\u2013Contra affair]]\" that brought the NSC to a nadir of public trust and brought upon it Congressional investigation and the threat of prison for those involved. The Iran\u2013Contra matter resulted from NSC-led efforts to develop a policy to befriend Iran and provide arms to that nation in exchange for its resistance to the [[Soviet Union]] and, more particularly to assist in the freeing of American hostages held by Muslim extremist groups in the Middle East. National Security Advisor McFarlane and Admiral Poindexter, who succeeded him in December 1985, played major roles in these matters. The efforts to provide arms for hostages eventually became connected, through the transfer of funds made with arms sales, with the NSC staff's ardent support for the Nicaraguan \"Contras\" in their civil war against the left-wing government of Nicaragua. Investigations in 1987 and thereafter by a Presidential Review Board (the [[Tower Commission]]), Congress ([[Congressional Committees Investigating The Iran\u2013Contra affair]]), and a Special Prosecutor ([[Lawrence Walsh]]) examined in great detail the activities of the NSC staff, as well as the actions and responsibilities of the President, the National Security Advisor, and the heads of agencies.\n\n===The Tower Commission===\n{{main|Tower Commission}}\nThe Tower Board, headed by Senator [[John Tower]] and including former Senator Edmund Muskie and former National Security Advisor Scowcroft, not only reviewed the events of Iran\u2013Contra but made a body of recommendations for the reform of the NSC. NSDD(266) of March 31, 1987, adopted the Board's major recommendations: reduction of the size of the staff, appointment of a legal counsel, removal of the Crisis Pre-Planning Group, and its replacement with [[Policy Review Committee]]. The spirit of the reforms was given more content by the new NSC leadership appointed by President Reagan in November 1987: National Security Advisor [[Frank Carlucci]] and Deputy National Security Advisor Lieutenant General [[Colin Powell]]. Carlucci reformed the NSC by replacing more than half of the professional staff within 3 months. Carlucci largely withdrew the NSC from its operational roles, but in the matter of Nicaragua, NSC continued to exercise the coordination that was not forthcoming from any of the agencies.\n\n==The NSC under Colin Powell==\n[[File:Colin Powell official Secretary of State photo.jpg|thumb|Future Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] served as Deputy National Security Advisor to President Ronald Reagan.]]\n\nIn the autumn of 1988, Carlucci was called to the Defense Department to succeed [[Caspar Weinberger]], and for the third time among his six appointments to the position of National Security Advisor during his presidency, Reagan promoted the Deputy. General Powell directed an NSC that strived to provide balanced coordination of major foreign policy presentations for the President. Managing the Policy Review Group and the National Security Planning Group that Poindexter had so favored in preparing the NSC for discussions, Powell conducted an NSC process that was efficient but low key. There were no longer free-lancers operating out of the NSC staff. Under Powell's direction, the President and his chief advisors weathered the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf]] crisis in 1987 and the Reagan-[[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] relationship culminating in the [[Moscow Summit]] of June 1988 (the smoothest ever seen by observers at the time).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{White House website}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|1980s}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20010126104800/http://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/history.html National Security Council Website]\n\n{{HistoryUSNatSecCouncil}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History of the United States National Security Council 1981-1989}}\n[[Category:United States National Security Council]]\n[[Category:Presidency of Ronald Reagan]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more footnotes|date=April 2018}}\n{{primary sources|date=November 2009}}\n}}\nThis article is about the '''history of the United States National Security Council during the Reagan Administration, 1981&ndash;1989'''.\n\n==The Haig initiative==\n[[File:The Troika 1981.jpg|thumb|(from left to right) Chief of Staff James Baker, Counselor to the President Ed Meese, Deputy White House Chief of Staff Michael Deaver at the [[White House]], December 2, 1981]]\n\nOn [[inauguration day]], [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]-designate [[Alexander Haig]] presented a draft National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) on the organization of U.S. foreign policy to Presidential Counselor [[Edwin Meese III]].

In 1898, the British introduced coffee to the [[East Godavari]] district in [[Pamuluru]] before it spread to Araku in the early 19th century. After independence, the [[Andhra Pradesh Forest Department]] took up coffee plantations in the valley and by 1956, the [[Coffee Board of India]] appointed Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC) for its promotion through local tribal farmers. In a significant development, the Naidu Government and [[SpiceJet]], the third largest airline in the country by number of domestic passengers carried, came forward to serve the organic brew of Araku to its passengers. SpiceJet air hostesses would make special announcements about the brand and its significance, and about the coffee plantations in Araku Valley. To increase visits to tourist places located around Araku Valley, a scheme of scratch cards was introduced. Cards would be given to every passenger and two passengers, with their families, would receive free accommodation in Araku Valley and the tourism department would pay to the airline towards promotion of Araku Coffee for three months. The brand became so popular and exotic that Naidu gifted them to Korean and Russian delegates during their visits and the coffee was marketed in all the international investor meetings organized by the state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/Naidu-markets-Araku-coffee-at-womens-meet/articleshow/51893052.cms|title=Naidu markets Araku coffee at women's meet|date=19 April 2016 |work=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yovizag.com/araku-coffee-exotic-brand/|title=Coffee From Araku - Our Very Own Exotic Brand |date=27 May 2017|website=Yo Vizag|language=en-US|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref> Naidu once said that Araku Valley\u2019s tribal coffee is competing with Columbian and Sumatran coffee in the international market.

He had taken a position on a popularly debated question of the day \u2013 whether all four feet of a horse were off the ground at the same time while trotting. The same question had arisen about the actions of horses during a gallop. In 1872, Muybridge began experimenting with an array of 12 cameras photographing a galloping horse in a sequence of shots. His initial efforts seemed to prove that Stanford was right, but he didn\u2019t have the process perfected.\n\nThe human eye could not break down the action at the quick gaits of the trot and gallop.

In 1872, Muybridge settled Stanford's question with a single photographic negative showing his [[Standardbred]] trotting horse named Occident, also fully airborne at the trot. This negative was lost, but the image survives through [[woodcuts]] made at the time (the technology for printed reproductions of photographs was still being developed). Muybridge later made additional studies, as well as improving his camera for quicker shutter speed and faster film emulsions.

The opening of the [[Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, and the development of [[steamship]]s made travel much faster and less arduous than it was in 1860. On 13 March 1882 he lectured at the [[Royal Institution]] in London in front of a sell-out audience, which included members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]], notably the future [[King Edward VII]].<ref name=BCLG>Brian Clegg [https://books.google.com/books?id=eHcI45y0gG8C&pg=PA159&dq=King+Edward+-+eadweard+muybridge&hl=en&ei=4aQRTfnAFJGJhQfW-cS3Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=King%20Edward%20-%20eadweard%20muybridge&f=false ''The Man Who Stopped Time: The Illuminating Story of Eadweard Muybridge : Pioneer Photographer, Father of the Motion Picture, Murderer''], Joseph Henry Press, 2007</ref> He displayed his photographs on screen and showed moving pictures projected by his zoopraxiscope.<ref name=BCLG/>\n\nMuybridge and Stanford had a major falling-out concerning his research on equine locomotion.

The human models, either entirely nude or very lightly clothed, were photographed against a measured grid background in a variety of action sequences, including walking up or down stairs, hammering on an anvil, carrying buckets of water, or throwing water over one another. Muybridge produced sequences showing farm, industrial, construction, and household work, military maneuvers, and everyday activities. He also photographed athletic activities such as [[baseball]], [[cricket]], [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], [[discus throwing]], and a [[ballet]] dancer performing. Showing a single-minded dedication to scientific accuracy and artistic composition, Muybridge himself posed nude for some of the photographic sequences, such as one showing him swinging a miner's pick.<ref name=\"Shimamura\"/><ref name=\"Leslie\"/>\n[[File:Muybridge horse jumping animated.gif|left|thumb|Classic animation by Muybridge of a horse and rider jumping]]\n\nBetween 1883 and 1886, Muybridge made more than 100,000 images, working obsessively in Philadelphia under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania. During 1884, the painter [[Thomas Eakins]] briefly worked alongside him, to learn more about the application of photography to the study of human and animal motion. Eakins later favored the use of [[multiple exposure]]s superimposed on a single photographic negative to study motion more precisely, while Muybridge continued to use multiple cameras to produce separate images which could also be projected by his zoopraxiscope.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=93|ps=}} The vast majority of Muybridge's work at this time was done in a special sunlit outdoor studio, due to the bulky cameras and slow photographic emulsion speeds then available. Toward the end of this period, Muybridge spent much of his time selecting and editing his photos in preparation for publication.\n\nIn 1887, the photos were published as a massive portfolio, with 781 plates comprising 20,000 of the photographs, in a groundbreaking collection titled ''Animal Locomotion: an Electro-Photographic Investigation of Connective Phases of Animal Movements''.<ref name=\"UPennArchive\">[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html Selected Items from the Eadweard Muybridge Collection (University of Pennsylvania Archives and Records Center)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216072501/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html |date=16 December 2008 }} \"The Eadweard Muybridge Collection at the University of Pennsylvania Archives contains 702 of the 784 plates in his Animal Locomotion study\"</ref> Muybridge's work contributed substantially to developments in the science of [[biomechanics]] and the mechanics of athletics.

In 1881, Muybridge first visited Marey's studio in France and viewed stop-motion studies before returning to the US to further his own work in the same area.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=91|ps=}} Marey was a pioneer in producing multiple-exposure, sequential images using a rotary shutter in his so-called \"Marey wheel\" camera.\n\nWhile Marey's scientific achievements in the realms of [[cardiology]] and [[aerodynamics]] (as well as pioneering work in [[photography]] and [[chronophotography]]) are indisputable, Muybridge's efforts were to some degree more artistic rather than scientific. As Muybridge explained, in some of his published sequences he had substituted images where original exposures had failed, in order to illustrate a representative movement (rather than producing a strictly scientific recording of a particular sequence).<ref name=Adam14>{{cite book|editor-last=Adam|editor-first=Hans Christian|title=Eadweard Muybridge, the human and animal locomotion photographs|year=2010|publisher=Taschen|location=K\u00f6ln|isbn=978-3-8365-0941-1|page=14|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIVePgAACAAJ}}</ref>\n\nToday, similar setups of carefully timed multiple cameras are used in modern [[special effects]] photography, but they have the opposite goal of capturing changing camera angles, with little or no movement of the subject. This is often dubbed \"[[bullet time]]\" photography.\n\nAfter his work at the University of Pennsylvania, Muybridge travelled widely and gave numerous lectures and demonstrations of his still photography and primitive motion picture sequences. At the Chicago [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893, Muybridge presented a series of lectures on the \"Science of Animal Locomotion\" in the Zoopraxographical Hall, built specially for that purpose in the \"Midway Plaisance\" arm of the exposition. He used his zoopraxiscope to show his [[film|moving pictures]] to a paying public.

He returned to the US once more, in 1896\u20131897, to settle financial affairs and to dispose of property related to his work at the University of Pennsylvania. He retained control of his negatives, which he used to publish two popular books of his work, ''Animals in Motion'' (1899) and ''The Human Figure in Motion'' (1901), both of which remain in print over a century later.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=100|ps=}}\n\nMuybridge died on 8 May 1904 in Kingston upon Thames of [[prostate cancer]] at the home of his cousin Catherine Smith.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=101|ps=}} His body was cremated, and its ashes interred in a grave at [[Woking]] in [[Surrey]].

He also edited and published compilations of his work, which greatly influenced [[visual artist]]s and the developing fields of scientific and industrial photography. He returned to his native England permanently in 1894.

He had taken a position on a popularly debated question of the day \u2013 whether all four feet of a horse were off the ground at the same time while trotting. The same question had arisen about the actions of horses during a gallop. In 1872, Muybridge began experimenting with an array of 12 cameras photographing a galloping horse in a sequence of shots. His initial efforts seemed to prove that Stanford was right, but he didn\u2019t have the process perfected.\n\nThe human eye could not break down the action at the quick gaits of the trot and gallop. Up until this time, most artists painted horses at a trot with one foot always on the ground; and at a full gallop with the front legs extended forward and the hind legs extended to the rear, and all feet off the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com/muybridge.html |title=Eadweard Muybridge and His Influence on Horse Art |publisher=Your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> Stanford sided with the assertion of \"unsupported transit\" in the trot and gallop, and decided to have it proven scientifically.

In 1872, Muybridge settled Stanford's question with a single photographic negative showing his [[Standardbred]] trotting horse named Occident, also fully airborne at the trot. This negative was lost, but the image survives through [[woodcuts]] made at the time (the technology for printed reproductions of photographs was still being developed). Muybridge later made additional studies, as well as improving his camera for quicker shutter speed and faster film emulsions.

The opening of the [[Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, and the development of [[steamship]]s made travel much faster and less arduous than it was in 1860. On 13 March 1882 he lectured at the [[Royal Institution]] in London in front of a sell-out audience, which included members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]], notably the future [[King Edward VII]].<ref name=BCLG>Brian Clegg [https://books.google.com/books?id=eHcI45y0gG8C&pg=PA159&dq=King+Edward+-+eadweard+muybridge&hl=en&ei=4aQRTfnAFJGJhQfW-cS3Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=King%20Edward%20-%20eadweard%20muybridge&f=false ''The Man Who Stopped Time: The Illuminating Story of Eadweard Muybridge : Pioneer Photographer, Father of the Motion Picture, Murderer''], Joseph Henry Press, 2007</ref> He displayed his photographs on screen and showed moving pictures projected by his zoopraxiscope.<ref name=BCLG/>\n\nMuybridge and Stanford had a major falling-out concerning his research on equine locomotion.

Muybridge, looking elsewhere for funding, was more successful.<ref name=\"Shimamura\"/> The Royal Society later invited Muybridge back to show his work.<ref name=\"Leslie\"/>\n\nIn the 1880s, the [[University of Pennsylvania]] sponsored Muybridge's research using banks of cameras to photograph people in a studio, and animals from the [[Philadelphia Zoo]] to study their movement. The human models, either entirely nude or very lightly clothed, were photographed against a measured grid background in a variety of action sequences, including walking up or down stairs, hammering on an anvil, carrying buckets of water, or throwing water over one another. Muybridge produced sequences showing farm, industrial, construction, and household work, military maneuvers, and everyday activities. He also photographed athletic activities such as [[baseball]], [[cricket]], [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], [[discus throwing]], and a [[ballet]] dancer performing. Showing a single-minded dedication to scientific accuracy and artistic composition, Muybridge himself posed nude for some of the photographic sequences, such as one showing him swinging a miner's pick.<ref name=\"Shimamura\"/><ref name=\"Leslie\"/>\n[[File:Muybridge horse jumping animated.gif|left|thumb|Classic animation by Muybridge of a horse and rider jumping]]\n\nBetween 1883 and 1886, Muybridge made more than 100,000 images, working obsessively in Philadelphia under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania. During 1884, the painter [[Thomas Eakins]] briefly worked alongside him, to learn more about the application of photography to the study of human and animal motion. Eakins later favored the use of [[multiple exposure]]s superimposed on a single photographic negative to study motion more precisely, while Muybridge continued to use multiple cameras to produce separate images which could also be projected by his zoopraxiscope.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=93|ps=}} The vast majority of Muybridge's work at this time was done in a special sunlit outdoor studio, due to the bulky cameras and slow photographic emulsion speeds then available. Toward the end of this period, Muybridge spent much of his time selecting and editing his photos in preparation for publication.\n\nIn 1887, the photos were published as a massive portfolio, with 781 plates comprising 20,000 of the photographs, in a groundbreaking collection titled ''Animal Locomotion: an Electro-Photographic Investigation of Connective Phases of Animal Movements''.<ref name=\"UPennArchive\">[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html Selected Items from the Eadweard Muybridge Collection (University of Pennsylvania Archives and Records Center)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216072501/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html |date=16 December 2008 }} \"The Eadweard Muybridge Collection at the University of Pennsylvania Archives contains 702 of the 784 plates in his Animal Locomotion study\"</ref> Muybridge's work contributed substantially to developments in the science of [[biomechanics]] and the mechanics of athletics.

In 1881, Muybridge first visited Marey's studio in France and viewed stop-motion studies before returning to the US to further his own work in the same area.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=91|ps=}} Marey was a pioneer in producing multiple-exposure, sequential images using a rotary shutter in his so-called \"Marey wheel\" camera.\n\nWhile Marey's scientific achievements in the realms of [[cardiology]] and [[aerodynamics]] (as well as pioneering work in [[photography]] and [[chronophotography]]) are indisputable, Muybridge's efforts were to some degree more artistic rather than scientific. As Muybridge explained, in some of his published sequences he had substituted images where original exposures had failed, in order to illustrate a representative movement (rather than producing a strictly scientific recording of a particular sequence).<ref name=Adam14>{{cite book|editor-last=Adam|editor-first=Hans Christian|title=Eadweard Muybridge, the human and animal locomotion photographs|year=2010|publisher=Taschen|location=K\u00f6ln|isbn=978-3-8365-0941-1|page=14|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIVePgAACAAJ}}</ref>\n\nToday, similar setups of carefully timed multiple cameras are used in modern [[special effects]] photography, but they have the opposite goal of capturing changing camera angles, with little or no movement of the subject. This is often dubbed \"[[bullet time]]\" photography.\n\nAfter his work at the University of Pennsylvania, Muybridge travelled widely and gave numerous lectures and demonstrations of his still photography and primitive motion picture sequences. At the Chicago [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893, Muybridge presented a series of lectures on the \"Science of Animal Locomotion\" in the Zoopraxographical Hall, built specially for that purpose in the \"Midway Plaisance\" arm of the exposition. He used his zoopraxiscope to show his [[film|moving pictures]] to a paying public.

He returned to the US once more, in 1896\u20131897, to settle financial affairs and to dispose of property related to his work at the University of Pennsylvania. He retained control of his negatives, which he used to publish two popular books of his work, ''Animals in Motion'' (1899) and ''The Human Figure in Motion'' (1901), both of which remain in print over a century later.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=100|ps=}}\n\nMuybridge died on 8 May 1904 in Kingston upon Thames of [[prostate cancer]] at the home of his cousin Catherine Smith.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=101|ps=}} His body was cremated, and its ashes interred in a grave at [[Woking]] in [[Surrey]].

[[Diane Brewster]] was cast as Muybridge's wife, the former Flora Stone, who was twenty-one years his junior.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0556756/?ref_=ttep_ep26|title=The $25,000 Wager on ''Death Valley Days''|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=14 September 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Jim Morrison]] makes a reference to Muybridge in his poetry book ''The Lords'' (1969), suggesting that \"Muybridge derived his animal subjects from the Philadelphia Zoological Garden, male performers from the University\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://glamour-and-discourse.blogspot.com.au/p/jim-morrison-lords.html |title=The Lords, 11th paperback edition (October 15, 1971) |publisher=Touchstone |accessdate=21 July 2015}}</ref>\n* The filmmaker [[Thom Andersen]] made a 1974 documentary titled ''[[Eadweard Muybridge, Zoopraxographer]]'', describing his life and work.\n* The composer [[Philip Glass]]'s opera ''[[The Photographer]]'' (1982) is based on Muybridge's murder trial, with a [[libretto]] including text from the court transcript.\n* His pictures are shown in a 42-minute movie, made in 1984 by the Italian director Paolo Gioli, called \"The naked killer\" (Italian: ''L'assassino nudo'').\n* In 1985, the [[music video]] for [[Larry Gowan]]'s single \"(You're a) Strange Animal\" prominently featured animation [[rotoscope]]d from Muybridge's work.

{"title_page": "Rob Gonsalves", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=November 2010}}\n\n'''Robert \"Rob\" Gonsalves''' (June 25, 1959 \u2013 June 14, 2017) was a [[Canadian]] painter of [[magic realism]] ([[surrealism]]). He produced original works, limited edition prints and [[illustrations]] for his own books.\n\n==Early life==\nGonsalves was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. As child, he developed an interest in art. By the age of thirteen, his awareness of architecture grew as he learned perspective techniques and he began to create his first paintings and renderings of imagined buildings.\nAfter an introduction to artists in his thirties [[M. C. Escher|Escher]], [[Salvador Dal\u00ed|Dal\u00ed]], and [[Yves Tanguy|Tanguy]], Gonsalves began his first surrealistic paintings. The \"Magic Realism\" approach of [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte|Magritte]] along with the precise perspective illusions of [[M. C. Escher|Escher]] came to be influences in his future work.\n\n==Career==\nIn his post college years, Gonsalves worked full-time as an architect, also painting [[trompe-l'\u0153il]] murals and theatre sets. After an enthusiastic response in 1990 at the [http://www.torontooutdoorart.org/ Toronto Outdoor Art Exhibition], Gonsalves devoted himself to painting full-time.\n\nAlthough Gonsalves' work is often categorized as [[surrealistic]], it differs because the images are deliberately planned and result from conscious thought. Ideas are largely generated by the external world and involve recognizable human activities, using carefully planned illusionist devices. Gonsalves injects a sense of magic into realistic scenes. As a result, the term \"Magic Realism\" describes his work accurately. His work is an attempt to represent human beings' desire to believe the impossible, to be open to possibility.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.zmescience.com/other/feature-post/the-surreal-mind-bending-paintings-of-rob-gonsalves/|title = The Surreal, Mind-Bending Paintings of Rob Gonsalves|date = February 23, 2015|accessdate = February 26, 2015|website = ZME Science|publisher = |last = Mihai|first = Andrei}}</ref>\n\nGonsalves exhibited at Art Expo New York and Los Angeles, Decor Atlanta and Las Vegas, Fine Art Forum, as well as one-man shows at [http://huckleberryfineart.com/artist/rob-gonsalves/ Huckleberry Fine Art], Marcus Ashley Gallery in South Lake Tahoe, Hudson River Art Gallery, [http://sapergalleries.com/Gonsalves.html Saper Galleries] (November 7 to December 31, 2004), Discovery Galleries, Ltd., and Kaleidoscope Gallery.

He produced original works, limited edition prints and [[illustrations]] for his own books.\n\n==Early life==\nGonsalves was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. As child, he developed an interest in art. By the age of thirteen, his awareness of architecture grew as he learned perspective techniques and he began to create his first paintings and renderings of imagined buildings.\nAfter an introduction to artists in his thirties [[M. C. Escher|Escher]], [[Salvador Dal\u00ed|Dal\u00ed]], and [[Yves Tanguy|Tanguy]], Gonsalves began his first surrealistic paintings. The \"Magic Realism\" approach of [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte|Magritte]] along with the precise perspective illusions of [[M. C. Escher|Escher]] came to be influences in his future work.\n\n==Career==\nIn his post college years, Gonsalves worked full-time as an architect, also painting [[trompe-l'\u0153il]] murals and theatre sets. After an enthusiastic response in 1990 at the [http://www.torontooutdoorart.org/ Toronto Outdoor Art Exhibition], Gonsalves devoted himself to painting full-time.\n\nAlthough Gonsalves' work is often categorized as [[surrealistic]], it differs because the images are deliberately planned and result from conscious thought. Ideas are largely generated by the external world and involve recognizable human activities, using carefully planned illusionist devices. Gonsalves injects a sense of magic into realistic scenes. As a result, the term \"Magic Realism\" describes his work accurately. His work is an attempt to represent human beings' desire to believe the impossible, to be open to possibility.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.zmescience.com/other/feature-post/the-surreal-mind-bending-paintings-of-rob-gonsalves/|title = The Surreal, Mind-Bending Paintings of Rob Gonsalves|date = February 23, 2015|accessdate = February 26, 2015|website = ZME Science|publisher = |last = Mihai|first = Andrei}}</ref>\n\nGonsalves exhibited at Art Expo New York and Los Angeles, Decor Atlanta and Las Vegas, Fine Art Forum, as well as one-man shows at [http://huckleberryfineart.com/artist/rob-gonsalves/ Huckleberry Fine Art], Marcus Ashley Gallery in South Lake Tahoe, Hudson River Art Gallery, [http://sapergalleries.com/Gonsalves.html Saper Galleries] (November 7 to December 31, 2004), Discovery Galleries, Ltd., and Kaleidoscope Gallery.

{"title_page": "History of the United States (1945\u20131964)", "text_new": "{{History of the United States}}\n{{Periods in US history}}\n\nFor the [[United States|United States of America]], 1945 to 1964 was a time of high economic growth and general prosperity. It was also a time of confrontation as the capitalist United States and its allies politically opposed the Soviet Union and other communist countries; the [[Cold War]] had begun. African Americans united and organized, and a triumph of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] ended [[Jim Crow]] segregation in the South.<ref>James T. Patterson, ''Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945\u20131974'' (1988) pp 771-90</ref> Further laws were passed that made discrimination illegal and provided federal oversight to guarantee voting rights.\n\nEarly in the period, an active foreign policy was pursued to help Western Europe and Asia recover from the devastation of [[World War II]]. The [[Marshall Plan]] helped Western Europe rebuild from wartime devastation. The main American goal was to contain the expansion of [[Communism]], which was controlled by the [[Soviet Union]] until [[Sino-Soviet split|China broke away]] about 1960. An arms race escalated through increasingly powerful nuclear weapons. The Soviets formed the [[Warsaw Pact]] of European satellites to oppose the American-led [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) alliance.  The U.S. fought a bloody, inconclusive war in [[Korean War|Korea]] and was escalating the war in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] as the period ended.  The Communists took power in Cuba, and when the USSR sent in nuclear missiles to defend it, the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962 was triggered with the U.S., the most dangerous point of the era.<ref>Alan P. Dobson and Steve Marsh, ''US foreign policy since 1945'' (2006) pp 18-29, 76-90</ref>\n\nOn the domestic front, after a short transition, the economy grew rapidly, with widespread prosperity, rising wages, and the movement of most of the remaining farmers to the towns and cities. Politically, the era was dominated by liberal Democrats who held together the [[New Deal Coalition]]: [[Harry Truman]] (1945\u20131953), [[John F. Kennedy]] (1961\u20131963) and [[Lyndon Johnson]] (1963\u20131969). Republican [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (1953\u20131961) was a moderate who did not attempt to reverse New Deal programs such as regulation of business and support for labor unions; he expanded Social Security and built the interstate highway system. For most of the period, the Democrats controlled Congress; however, they were usually unable to pass as much liberal legislation as they had hoped because of the power of the [[Conservative Coalition]].  The [[Modern liberalism in the United States#Liberal coalition|Liberal coalition]] took control of Congress after Kennedy's assassination in 1963, and launched the [[Great Society]].<ref>[[Alonzo L. Hamby]], ''Liberalism and Its Challengers: From F.D.R. to Bush''  (2nd ed. 1992)  pp 52-139</ref>\n\nThis period witnessed the rise of suburbs and a growing middle class. [[Communitarianism]] and measurable [[social capital]] was at its highest point during this time. <ref>Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community by Robert D. Putnam</ref>\n\n==Cold War==\n{{Main article|Cold War (1947\u20131953)|Cold War (1953\u20131962)|Culture during the Cold War}}\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:EasternBloc BorderChange38-48.svg|right|thumb|Post-war territorial changes in Europe and the formation of the Eastern Bloc, the western border is  the \"[[Iron Curtain]]\".]]\n\nWhile Roosevelt was confident he could deal with Stalin after the war, Truman was much more suspicious. The United States provided large-scale grants to Western Europe  under the [[Marshall Plan]] (1948 - 1951), leading to a rapid economic recovery. The Soviet Union refused to allow its satellites to receive American aid. Instead, the Kremlin used local Communist parties, and the Red army, to control Eastern Europe in totalitarian fashion.<ref>Anne Applebaum, ''Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe, 1944\u20131956'' (2012) p. xxii - xxv.</ref>   Britain, in deep financial trouble, could no longer support Greece in its civil war with the communists. They asked the United States to take over their role in Greece. With bipartisan support in Congress, Truman responded with the [[Truman Doctrine]] in 1947. Truman followed the intellectual leadership of the State Department, which, especially under the guidance of [[George F. Kennan]], called for [[containment]] of Soviet communist expansion. The idea was that internal contradictions, such as diverse nationalism,  would ultimately undermine Soviet ambitions.<ref>Carole K. Fink, ''Cold War: An International History'' (2013) pp 53-79.</ref> \n\nBy 1947, the Soviets had fully absorbed the three Baltic nations, and effectively controlled Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia,  Romania, and Bulgaria. Austria and Finland were neutral and demilitarized.  The Kremlin did not control Yugoslavia, which had a separate communist regime under [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshall Tito]]; They had a permanent bitter break in 1948. The Cold War lines stabilized in Europe along the [[Iron Curtain]], and there was no fighting. The United States helped form a strong military alliance in [[NATO]] in 1949 including most of the nations of Western Europe, and Canada.  In Asia, however, there was much more movement. The United States failed to negotiate a settlement between its ally, nationalist China under [[Chiang Kai-shek]], and the Communists under [[Mao Zedong]]. The Communists took over [[History of China|China]] in 1949 and the nationalist government moved to the offshore island of Formosa (Taiwan), which came under American protection. Local communist movements attempted to take over all of Korea (1950) and Vietnam (1954). Communist hegemony covered one third of the world's land while the United States emerged as the world's more influential superpower, and formed a worldwide network of military alliances.<ref>John Lewis Gaddis, ''The Cold War: A New History'' (2006) pp 31-95</ref>\n\nThere were fundamental contrasts between the visions of the United States and the Soviet Union, between capitalist democracy and totalitarian communism.  The United States envisioned the new [[United Nations]] as a [[Wilsonian]] tool to resolve future troubles, but it failed in that purpose. The U.S. rejected totalitarianism and colonialism, in line with the principles laid down by the [[Atlantic Charter]] of 1941: self-determination, equal economic access, and a rebuilt capitalist, democratic Europe that could again serve as a hub in world affairs.<ref>Townsend Hoopes and Douglas Brinkley, ''FDR and the Creation of the U.N.'' (2000)  pp 205-22</ref>\n\n===Containment===\n{{Main article|Containment}}\nFor NATO, containment of the expansion of Soviet influence became foreign policy doctrine; the expectation was that eventually the inefficient Soviet system would collapse of internal weakness, and no \"hot\" war (that is, one with large-scale combat) would be necessary. Containment was supported by Republicans (led by Senator [[Arthur Vandenberg]] of Michigan, Governor [[Thomas Dewey]] of New York, and general [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]), but was opposed by the isolationists led by Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] of Ohio.\n\n===1949\u20131953===\nIn 1949, the communist leader [[Mao Zedong]] won control of mainland China in a civil war, proclaimed the [[People's Republic of China]], then traveled to Moscow where he negotiated the [[Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship]]. China had thus moved from a close ally of the U.S. to a bitter enemy, and the two fought each other starting in late 1950 in Korea.  The Truman administration responded with a secret 1950 plan, [[NSC 68]], designed to confront the Communists with large-scale defense spending.   The Russians had built an atomic bomb by 1949\u2014much sooner than expected; Truman ordered the development of the [[hydrogen bomb]]. [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Two of the spies]] who gave atomic secrets to Russia were tried and executed.\n\nFrance was hard-pressed by Communist insurgents in the [[First Indochina War]]. The U.S. in 1950 started to fund the French effort on the proviso that the Vietnamese be given more autonomy.\n\n===Korean War===\n{{Main article|Korean War}}\n\nStalin approved a [[North Korea]]n plan to invade U.S.-supported [[South Korea]] in June 1950. President Truman immediately and unexpectedly implemented the containment policy by a full-scale commitment of American and UN forces to Korea. He did not consult or gain approval of Congress but did gain the approval of the [[United Nations]] (UN) to drive back the North Koreans and re-unite that country in terms of a [[rollback]] strategy.<ref>The Soviets were boycotting the UN at that time (because it would not admit the [[People's Republic of China]]) and so was not present to veto Truman's actions.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=James I. |last=Matray |title=Truman's Plan for Victory: National Self-Determination and the Thirty-Eighth Parallel Decision in Korea |journal=[[Journal of American History]] |volume=66 |issue=2 |year=1979 |pages=314\u2013333 |jstor=1900879 |doi=10.2307/1900879 }}</ref>\n\nAfter a few weeks of retreat, General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s success at the [[Battle of Inchon]] turned the war around; UN forces invaded North Korea.  This advantage was lost when hundreds of thousands of Chinese entered an undeclared war against the United States and pushed the US/UN/Korean forces back to the original starting line, the 38th parallel. The war became a stalemate, with over 33,000 American dead and 100,000 wounded <ref>{{cite web|url=http://siadapp.dior.whs.mil/personnel/CASUALTY/korea.pdf |accessdate=2006-09-27 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927211600/http://siadapp.dior.whs.mil/personnel/CASUALTY/korea.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-27 }}</ref> but nothing to show for it except a resolve to continue the containment policy.  Truman fired MacArthur but was unable to end the war.  [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in 1952 campaigned against Truman's failures of \"Korea, Communism and Corruption,\" promising to go to Korea himself and end the war. By threatening to use nuclear weapons in 1953, Eisenhower ended the war with a truce that is still in effect.<ref>Spencer Tucker, ed. ''The Encyclopedia of the Korean War'' (3 vol 2010)</ref>\n\n===Anti-Communism and McCarthyism: 1947\u20131954===\n{{main article|McCarthyism}}\nIn 1947, well before McCarthy became active, the [[Conservative Coalition]] in Congress passed the [[Taft Hartley Act]], designed to balance the rights of management and unions, and delegitimizing Communist union leaders. The challenge of rooting out Communists from labor unions and the Democratic Party was successfully undertaken by liberals, such as [[Walter Reuther]] of the autoworkers union<ref>Martin Halpern, \"Taft-Hartley and the Defeat of the Progressive Alternative in the United Auto Workers,\" ''Labor History,'' Spring 1986, Vol. 27 Issue 2, pp 204-26</ref> and [[Ronald Reagan]] of the Screen Actors Guild (Reagan was a liberal Democrat at the time).<ref>Lou Cannon, ''President Reagan: the role of a lifetime'' (2000) p. 245</ref>  Many of the purged leftists joined the presidential campaign in 1948 of FDR's Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]].\n[[File:Is this tomorrow.jpg|thumb|225px|A 1947 booklet published by the Catholic Catechetical Guild Educational Society raising the specter of a Communist takeover]]\n\nThe [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], with young Congressman [[Richard M. Nixon]] playing a central role, accused [[Alger Hiss]], a top Roosevelt aide, of being a Communist spy, using testimony and documents provided by [[Whittaker Chambers]]. Hiss was convicted and sent to prison, with the anti-Communists gaining a powerful political weapon.<ref>Sam Tanenhaus, ''Whittaker Chambers: a biography'' (1988)</ref>  It launched Nixon's meteoric rise to the Senate (1950) and the vice presidency (1952).<ref>Roger Morris, ''Richard Milhous Nixon: The Rise of an American Politician'' (1991)</ref>\n\nWith anxiety over Communism in Korea and China reaching fever pitch in 1950, a previously obscure Senator, [[Joe McCarthy]] of Wisconsin, launched Congressional investigations into the cover-up of spies in the government. McCarthy dominated the media, and used reckless allegations and tactics that allowed his opponents to effectively counterattack.  Irish Catholics (including conservative wunderkind [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] and the [[Kennedy Family]]) were intensely anti-Communist and defended McCarthy (a  fellow Irish Catholic).<ref>William F. Buckley and L. Brent Bozell, ''Mccarthy and His Enemies: The Record and Its Meaning'' (1954)</ref>  Paterfamilias [[Joseph Kennedy]] (1888\u20131969), a very active conservative Democrat, was McCarthy's most ardent supporter and got his son [[Robert F. Kennedy]] a job with McCarthy.  McCarthy had talked of \"twenty years of treason\" (i.e. since Roosevelt's election in 1932). When, in 1953, he started talking of \"21 years of treason\" and launched a major attack on the Army for promoting a Communist dentist in the medical corps, his recklessness proved too much for Eisenhower, who encouraged Republicans to censure McCarthy formally in 1954. The Senator's power collapsed overnight. Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] did not vote for censure.<ref>Richard M. Fried, ''Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective'' (1990)</ref>  Buckley went on to found the ''[[National Review]]'' in 1955 as a weekly magazine that helped [[Conservatism in the United States|define the conservative position on public issues]].\n\n\"McCarthyism\" was expanded to include attacks on supposed Communist influence in Hollywood, which resulted in a black-list whereby artists who refused to testify about possible Communist connections could not get work. Some famous celebrities (such as [[Charlie Chaplin]]) left the U.S.; other worked under pseudonyms (such as [[Dalton Trumbo]]).  McCarthyism included investigations into academics and teachers as well.<ref>Ellen Schrecker, ''The Age of McCarthyism: A Brief History with Documents'' (2d ed. 2002)</ref>\n\n===Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations===\n[[File:JohnFosterDulles.jpeg|framed|John Foster Dulles]]\n{{Main|Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Presidency of John F. Kennedy}}\nIn 1953, Stalin died, and after the [[U.S. presidential election, 1952|1952 presidential election]], President Dwight D. Eisenhower used the opportunity to end the Korean War, while continuing Cold War policies.  Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] was the dominant figure in the nation's foreign policy in the 1950s.  Dulles denounced the \"containment\" of the Truman administration and espoused an active program of \"liberation\", which would lead to a \"[[rollback]]\" of communism. The most prominent of those doctrines was the policy of \"[[massive retaliation]]\", which Dulles announced early in 1954, eschewing the costly, conventional ground forces characteristic of the Truman administration in favor of wielding the vast superiority of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and covert intelligence. Dulles defined this approach as \"[[brinkmanship]]\".<ref>Chester J. Pach and Elmo Richardson, ''Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower'' (1991)</ref>\n\nA dramatic shock to Americans' self-confidence and its technological superiority came in 1957, when the Soviets beat the United States into outer space by launching [[Sputnik]], the first earth satellite. The space race began, and by the early 1960s the United States had forged ahead, with President Kennedy promising to land a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s\u2014the landing indeed took place on July 20, 1969.<ref>Paul Dickson, ''Sputnik: the shock of the century'' (2003)</ref>\n\nTrouble close to home appeared when [[Fidel Castro]] took control of [[Cuban Revolution|Cuba in 1959]] and forged increasingly  close ties with the Soviet Union, becoming communism's center in Latin America. The United States responded with an economic boycott of Cuba, and a large-scale economic support program for Latin America under Kennedy, the [[Alliance for Progress]].\n\nEast Germany was the weak point in the Soviet empire, with refugees leaving for the West by the thousands every week. The Soviet solution came in 1961, with the [[Berlin Wall]] to stop East Germans from fleeing communism. This was a major propaganda setback for the USSR, but it did allow them to keep control of East Berlin.<ref>Frederick Taylor, ''The Berlin Wall: A World Divided, 1961\u20131989'' (2008)</ref>\n\nThe Communist world split in half, as [[Sino-Soviet split|China turned against the Soviet Union]]; Mao denounced Khrushchev for going soft on capitalism. However, the US failed to take advantage of this split until President [[Richard Nixon]] saw the opportunity in 1969.  In 1958, the U.S. sent troops into [[Lebanon]] for nine months to stabilize a country on the verge of civil war. Between 1954 and 1961, Eisenhower dispatched large sums of economic and military aid and 695 military advisers to [[South Vietnam]] to stabilize the pro-western government under attack by insurgents.  Eisenhower supported CIA efforts to undermine anti-American governments, which proved most successful in Iran and Guatemala.<ref>Stephen E. Ambrose, ''Ike's spies: Eisenhower and the espionage establishment'' (1999)</ref>\n\nThe first major strain among the NATO alliance occurred in 1956 when Eisenhower forced Britain and France to retreat from their [[Suez crisis|invasion of Egypt]] (with [[Israel]]) which was intended to get back their ownership of the [[Suez Canal]]. Instead of supporting the claims of its NATO partners, the Eisenhower administration stated that it opposed French and British imperial adventurism in the region by sheer prudence, fearing that Egyptian leader [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]'s standoff with the region's old colonial powers would bolster Soviet power in the region.<ref>Cole Christian Kingseed, ''Eisenhower and the Suez Crisis of 1956'' (1995)</ref>\n\nThe Cold War reached its most dangerous point during the Kennedy administration in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], a tense confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba. The crisis began on October 16, 1962, and lasted for thirteen days. It was the moment when the Cold War was closest to exploding into a devastating nuclear exchange between the two superpower nations. Kennedy decided not to invade or bomb Cuba but to institute a naval blockade of the island. The crisis ended in a compromise, with the Soviets removing their missiles publicly, and the United States secretly removing its nuclear missiles in Turkey.  In Moscow, Communist leaders removed [[Nikita Khrushchev]] because of his reckless behavior.<ref>Don Munton and David A.

Inflation became a rather serious problem, averaging over 10% a year until 1950 and raw materials shortages dogged manufacturing industry. In addition, labor strikes rocked the nation, in some cases exacerbated by racial tensions due to African-Americans having taken jobs during the war and now being faced with irate returning veterans who demanded that they step aside. Munitions factories shut down and temporary workers returned home. Following the Republican takeover of Congress in the 1946 elections, President Truman was compelled to reduce taxes and curb government interference in the economy. With this done, the stage was set for the economic boom that, with only a few minor hiccups, would last for the next 23 years.  Between 1945 and 1960, GNP grew by 250%, expenditures on new construction multiplied nine times, and consumption on personal services increased three times. By 1960, per capita income was 35% higher than in 1945, and America had entered what the economist Walt Rostow referred to as the \"high mass consumption\" stage of economic development. Short-term credit went up from $8.4 billion in 1946 to $45.6 billion in 1958. As a result of the postwar economic boom, 60% of the American population had attained a \"middle-class\" standard of living by the mid-50s (defined as incomes of $3,000 to $10,000 in constant dollars), compared with only 31% in the last year of prosperity before the onset of the Great Depression. By the end of the decade, 87% of families owned a TV set, 75% a car, and 75% a washing machine. Between 1947 and 1960, the average real income for American workers increased by as much as it had in the previous half-century.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">The Unfinished Journey: America Since World War II by William H. Chafe</ref>\n\nProsperity and overall optimism made Americans feel that it was a good time to bring children into the world, and so a huge baby boom resulted during the decade following 1945 (the baby boom climaxed during the mid-1950s, after which birthrates gradually dropped off until going below replacement level in 1965). Although the overall number of children per woman was not unusually high (averaging 2.3), they were assisted by improving technology that greatly brought down infant mortality rates versus the prewar era. Among other things, this resulted in an unprecedented demand for children's products and a huge expansion of the public school system. The large size of the postwar baby boom generation would have significant social repercussions in American society for decades to come.\n\nIn 1963, [[Betty Friedan]] published her book ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' which ridiculed the housewife role of women during the postwar years; it was a best-seller and a major catalyst of the [[women's liberation movement]].\n\nThe American economy grew dramatically in the post-war period, expanding at a rate of 3.5% per annum between 1945 and 1970. During this period of prosperity, many incomes doubled in a generation, described by economist [[Frank Levy]] as \"upward mobility on a rocket ship.\" The substantial increase in average family income within a generation resulted in millions of office and factory workers being lifted into a growing middle class, enabling them to sustain a standard of living once considered to be reserved for the wealthy.<ref>Nancy Wiefek, ''The impact of economic anxiety in postindustrial America'' (2003) p 3</ref> As noted by Deone Zell, assembly line work paid well, while unionized factory jobs served as \"stepping-stones to the middle class.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Changing by design: organizational innovation at Hewlett-Packard by Deone Zell</ref> By the end of the Fifties, 87% of all American families owned at least one T.V., 75% owned cars, and 60% owned their homes.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Nation's business: Volume 48, Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, 1960</ref> By 1960, blue-collar workers had become the biggest buyers of many luxury goods and services.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> In addition, by the early 1970s, post-World War II American consumers enjoyed higher levels of disposable income than those in any other country.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe great majority of American workers who had stable jobs were well off financially, while even non-union jobs were associated with rising paychecks, benefits, and obtained many of the advantages that characterized union work.<ref>Beth A.

Indeed, for at least a quarter of century, the material promises of consumer-oriented Americanism were fulfilled in improvements in everyday life that made them the most affluent working class in American history.\"<ref>Ronald Edsforth and Larry Bennett, ''Popular culture and political change in modern America'' (1991) p 125</ref>\n\nBetween 1946 and 1960, the United States witnessed a significant expansion in the consumption of goods and services. GNP rose by 36% and personal consumption expenditures by 42%, cumulative gains which were reflected in the incomes of families and unrelated individuals. While the number of these units rose sharply from 43.3 million to 56.1 million in 1960, a rise of almost 23%, their average incomes grew even faster, from $3940 in 1946 to $6900 in 1960, an increase of 43%. After taking inflation into account, the real advance was 16%. The dramatic rise in the average American standard of living was such that, according to sociologist [[George Katona]]:\n:\"Today in this country minimum standards of nutrition, housing and clothing are assured, not for all, but for the majority. Beyond these minimum needs, such former luxuries as homeownership, durable goods, travel, recreation, and entertainment are no longer restricted to a few. The broad masses participate in enjoying all these things and generate most of the demand for them.\"<ref>George Katona, ''The mass consumption society'' (1964) p 5</ref>\n\nMore than 21 million housing units were constructed between 1946 and 1960, and in the latter year 52% of consumer units in the metropolitan areas owned their own homes. In 1957, out of all the wired homes throughout the country, 96% had a refrigerator, 87% an electric washer, 81% a television, 67% a vacuum cleaner, 18% a freezer, 12% an electric or gas dryer, and 8% air conditioning. Car ownership also soared, with 72% of consumer units owning an automobile by 1960.<ref name=\"Bernstein\"/> From 1958 to 1964, the average weekly take-home pay of blue-collar workers rose steadily from $68 to $78 (in constant dollars).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MQKinXkAJLUC&pg=PA37&dq=america+blue-collar+consumer+spending+1965#v=onepage&q=america%20blue-collar%20consumer%20spending%201965&f=false |title=Beyond the Liberal Consensus: A Political History of the United States Since ... |author=Iwan W.

The forty-hour workweek established by the Fair Labor Standards Act in covered industries became the actual schedule in most workplaces by 1960, while uncovered workers such as farmworkers and the self-employed worked fewer hours than they had done previously, although they still worked much longer hours than most other workers. Paid vacations also came to be enjoyed by the vast majority of workers, with 91% of blue-collar workers covered by major collective bargaining agreements receiving paid vacations by 1957 (usually to a maximum of three weeks), while by the early Sixties virtually all industries paid for holidays and most did so for seven days a year. Industries catering to leisure activities blossomed as a result of most Americans enjoying significant paid leisure time by 1960,<ref name=\"Bernstein\"/> while many blue-collar and white-collar workers had come to expect to hold on to their jobs for life.<ref>Stephen J. Whitfield, ''A companion to 20th-century America''</ref> This period saw the growth of [[motel]]s along major highways, as well as [[amusement park]]s such as [[Disneyland]], which opened in 1955.\n\nEducational outlays were also greater than in other countries while a higher proportion of young people were graduating from high schools and universities than elsewhere in the world, as hundreds of new colleges and universities opened every year.

By the mid-Sixties, the majority of American workers enjoyed the highest wage levels in the world,<ref>American Labor by Henry Pelling</ref> and by the late Sixties, the great majority of Americans were richer than people in other countries, except Sweden, Switzerland, and Canada. Educational outlays were also greater than in other countries while a higher proportion of young people was at school and college than elsewhere in the world. As noted by the historian [[John Vaizey]]:\n\n\"To strike a balance with the Soviet Union, it would be easy to say that all but the very poorest Americans were better off than the Russians, that education was better but the health service worse, but that above all the Americans had freedom of expression and democratic institutions.\"<ref>Social Democracy by John Vaizey</ref>\n\nIn regards to social welfare, the postwar era saw a considerable improvement in insurance for workers and their dependents against the risks of illness, as private insurance programs like Blue Cross and Blue Shield expanded. With the exception of farm and domestic workers, virtually all members of the labor force were covered by Social Security. In 1959 about two-thirds of the factory workers and three-fourths of the office workers were provided with supplemental private pension plans. In addition 86% of factory workers and 83% of office workers had jobs that covered for hospital insurance while 59% and 61% had additional insurance for doctors.<ref name=\"Bernstein\"/> By 1969, the average white family income had risen to $10,953, while the average black family income lagged behind at $7,255, revealing a continued racial disparity in income amongst various segments of the American population.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lI89AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA140&dq=American+median+household+income+1969#v=onepage&q=American%20median%20household%20income%201969&f=false |title=An Atlas of North American Affairs |author1=David Keith Adams |author2=H.

There were also three recessions, the first in 1953-54 following the end of the Korean War, the second in 1958, and the third in 1960\u201361. In each case, the Republican Party, which had begun the Eisenhower era with a plurality in Congress, suffered the consequences. In the 1954 midterms, the Democrats regained a solid majority of both houses and they would retain an unbroken control of the Senate until 1981 and the House until 1995. The 1958 recession cost the GOP yet more seats, and the 1960 recession was used by John F. Kennedy as cannon fodder against the Republicans in his presidential run.\n\nUnemployment peaked at 7% in the spring of 1961 before an economic rebound began that would continue to the end of the decade. President Kennedy then decided to break with the New Deal orthodoxy of high Federal taxes to force income equality. In a December 1962 speech, he announced his plans to reduce the top marginal tax rate to 75%, which one GOP Congressman wryly dubbed \"the most Republican speech a president has made since McKinley\". Although the president did not live to see his tax proposal passed, Lyndon Johnson quickly steered it through Congress, and by late 1965, real GDP growth was exceeding 6% a year.\n\n===Suburbia===\n[[File:LevittownPA.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Aerial view of [[Levittown, Pennsylvania]], circa 1959]]Very little housing had been built during the Great Depression and World War, except for emergency quarters near war industries. Overcrowded and inadequate apartments was the common condition. Some suburbs had developed around large cities where there was rail transportation to the jobs downtown. However, the real growth in suburbia depended on the availability of automobiles, highways, and inexpensive housing. The population had grown, and the stock of family savings had accumulated the money for down payments, automobiles and appliances. The product was a great housing boom. Whereas an average of 316,000 new housing nonfarm units had been constructed each year from the 1930s through 1945, there were 1,450,000 built annually from 1946 through 1955 in all areas, especially suburbs.<ref>U.S. Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States '' (1976) series H-156</ref> The G.I. Bill guaranteed low cost loans for veterans, with very low down payments, and low interest rates. With 16 million eligible veterans, the opportunity to buy a house was suddenly at hand. In 1947 alone, 540,000 veterans bought one; their average price was $7300. The construction industry kept prices low by standardization \u2013 for example standardizing sizes for kitchen cabinets, refrigerators, and stoves allowed for mass production of kitchen furnishings. Developers purchased empty land just outside the city, installed tract houses based on a handful of designs, and provided streets and utilities, as local public officials race to build schools.<ref>Joseph Goulden, ''The Best Years, 1945\u20131950'' (1976) pp 135-39.</ref> The most famous development was [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]], in Long Island just east of New York City. It offered a new house for $1000 down, and $70 a month; it featured three bedrooms, fireplace, gas range and gas furnace, and a landscaped lot of 75 by 100 feet, all for a total price of $10,000. Veterans could get one with a much lower down payment.<ref>Barbara Mae Kelly, ''Expanding the American Dream: Building and Rebuilding Levittown'' (SUNY Press, 1993).</ref>  Growth of the suburbs was especially prominent in the [[Sunbelt]] regions of the country; one example of a suburb on the West Coast was [[Lakewood, California]], built largely to serve family of aviation workers.  Going hand-in-hand with suburban development was the rise of [[shopping mall]]s, [[fast-food restaurant]]s and [[Diner|coffee shop]]s.\n\nWith Detroit turning out automobiles as fast as possible, city dwellers gave up cramped apartments for a suburban life style centered around children and housewives, with the male breadwinner commuting to work.<ref>Rosalyn Baxandall and Elizabeth Ewen, ''Picture Windows: How the Suburbs Happened'' (2000)</ref> Suburbia encompassed  a third of the nation's population by 1960. The growth of suburbs was not only a result of postwar prosperity, but innovations of the single-family housing market with low interest rates on 20 and 30 year mortgages, and low down payments, especially for veterans. Meanwhile, the suburban population swelled because of the [[post\u2013World War II baby boom|baby boom]]. Suburbs provided larger homes for larger families, security from urban living, privacy, and space for consumer goods.<ref>Robert Fishman, ''Bourgeois Utopias: The Rise and Fall of Suburbia'' (1989)</ref>\n\n===Television and the consumer culture===\nAt the center of middle-class culture in the 1950s was a growing demand for consumer goods; a result of the postwar prosperity, the increase in variety and availability of consumer products, and television advertising. America generated a steadily growing demand for better automobiles, clothing, appliances, family vacations and higher education.  After the initial hurdles of the 1945-48 period were overcome, Americans found themselves flush with cash from wartime work due to there being little to buy for several years. The result was a mass consumer spending spree, with a huge and voracious demand for new homes, cars, and housewares. Increasing numbers enjoyed high wages, larger houses, better schools, more cars and home comforts like vacuum cleaners, washing machines&mdash;which were all made for labor-saving and to make housework easier. Inventions familiar in the early 21st century made their first appearance during this era. The live-in maid and cook, common features of middle-class homes at the beginning of the century, were virtually unheard of in the 1950s; only the very rich had servants. Householders enjoyed centrally heated homes with running hot water. New style furniture was bright, cheap, and light, and easy to move around.<ref>William H. Young and Nacy K. Young, ''The 1950s'' (2004) p 76</ref> As noted by [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] in 1958:\n\n\"the ordinary individual has access to amenities \u2013  foods, entertainments, personal transportation, and plumbing \u2013  in which not even the rich rejoiced a century ago.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1763989 |title=The Age of Affluence Revisited: Council Estates and Consumer Society in Britain, 1950\u20131970 &#124; Matthew Hollow |website=Academia.edu |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}</ref>  Television, a commodity virtually unheard of during the Second World War, was now prevalent in most American homes by the mid-to-late 1950s.  Americans now had a wide bevy of shows to choose from, ranging from sitcoms such ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' and ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' to music and variety shows such as ''[[American Bandstand]]'' and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', to fantasy programs such as ''[[Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]''.  Television also increasingly became a medium for which to advertise products.\n\nConsumerism represented one of the consequences (as well as one of the key ingredients) of the postwar economic boom. The initial quest for cars, appliances, and new furniture after the end of World War II quickly expanded into the mass consumption of goods, services, and recreational materials during the Fifties.\n\nIn addition to the huge domestic market for consumer items, the United States became \"the world's factory\", as it was the only major power whose soil had been untouched by the war. American money and manufactured goods flooded into Europe, South Korea, and Japan and helped in their reconstruction. US manufacturing dominance would be almost unchallenged for a quarter-century after 1945.\n\nProsperity also brought about the development of a distinct youth culture for the first time, as teenagers were not forced to work and support their family at young ages like in the past. This had its culmination in the development of new music genres such as rock-and-roll as well as fashion styles and subcultures, the most famous of which was the \"greaser\", a young male who drove [[motorcycle]]s, sported ducktail haircuts (which were widely banned in schools) and displayed a general disregard for the law and authority. The greaser phenomenon was kicked off by the controversial youth-oriented movies ''[[The Wild One]]'' (1953) starring [[Marlon Brando]] and ''[[Rebel Without A Cause]]'' (1955) starring [[James Dean]].\n\n===Science, technology and futurism===\nWith the prosperity of the era, the prevailing social attitude was one of belief in science, technology, progress, and futurism, although there had been signs of this trend since the 1930s. There was comparatively little nostalgia for the prewar era and the overall emphasis was on having everything new and more advanced than before. Nonetheless, the social conformity and consumerism of the 1950s often came under attack from intellectuals (e.g. [[Henry Miller]]'s books ''The Air-Conditioned Nightmare'' and ''Sunday After The War'') and there was a good deal of unrest fermenting under the surface of American society that would erupt during the following decade.\n\nOne of the key factors in postwar prosperity was a technology boom due to the experience of the war. Manufacturing had made enormous strides and it was now possible to produce consumer goods in quantities and levels of sophistication unseen before 1945. Acquisition of technology from occupied Germany also proved an asset, as it was sometimes more advanced than its American counterpart, especially in the optics and audio equipment fields. The typical automobile in 1950 was an average of $300 more expensive than the 1940 version, but also produced in twice the numbers. Luxury makes such as [[Cadillac]], which had been largely hand-built vehicles only available to the rich, now became a mass-produced car within the price range of the upper middle-class.\n\nThe rapid social and technological changes brought about a growing corporatization of America and the decline of smaller businesses, which often suffered from high postwar inflation and mounting operating costs. Newspapers declined in numbers and consolidated, both due to the above-mentioned factors and the event of TV news. The railroad industry, once one of the cornerstones of the American economy and an immense and often scorned influence on national politics, also suffered from the explosion in automobile sales and the construction of the interstate system. By the end of the 1950s, it was well into decline and by the 1970s became completely bankrupt, necessitating a takeover by the federal government. Smaller automobile manufacturers such as [[Nash Motors|Nash]], [[Studebaker]], and [[Packard]] were unable to compete with the Big Three in the new postwar world and gradually declined into oblivion over the next 15 years. Suburbanization caused the gradual movement of working-class people and jobs out of the inner cities as shopping centers displaced the traditional downtown stores. In time, this would have disastrous effects on urban areas.\n\n===Poverty and inequality in the postwar era===\n\nDespite the prosperity of the postwar era, a significant minority of Americans continued to live in poverty by the end of the Fifties. In 1947, 34% of all families earned less than $3,000 a year, compared with 22.1% in 1960. Nevertheless, between one-fifth to one-fourth of the population could not survive on the income they earned. The older generation of Americans did not benefit as much from the postwar economic boom especially as many had never recovered financially from the loss of their savings during the Great Depression. It was generally a given that the average 35-year-old in 1959 owned a better house and car than the average 65-year-old, who typically had nothing but a small Social Security pension for an income. Many blue-collar workers continued to live in poverty, with 30% of those employed in industry in 1958 receiving under $3,000 a year. In addition, individuals who earned more than $10,000 a year paid a lower proportion of their income in taxes than those who earned less than $2,000 a year.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1947, 60% of black families lived below the poverty level (defined in one study as below $3000 in 1968 dollars), compared with 23% of white families. In 1968, 23% of black families lived below the poverty level, compared with 9% of white families. In 1947, 11% of white families were affluent (defined as above $10,000 in 1968 dollars), compared with 3% of black families. In 1968, 42% of white families were defined as affluent, compared with 21% of black families. In 1947, 8% of black families received $7000 or more (in 1968 dollars) compared with 26% of white families. In 1968, 39% of black families received $7,000 or more, compared with 66% of white families. In 1960, the median for a married man of blue-collar income was $3,993 for blacks and $5,877 for whites. In 1969, the equivalent figures were $5,746 and $7,452, respectively.<ref>Sociology: Third Edition by Paul B. Horton and Chester L.

Conkin, ''A Revolution Down on the Farm: The Transformation of American Agriculture since 1929'' (2009)</ref>  Friedberger argues that the postwar period saw an accelerating mechanization of agriculture, combined with new and better fertilizers and genetic manipulation of hybrid corn. It made for greater specialization and greater economic risks for the farmer. With rising land prices many sold their land and moved to town, the old farm becoming part of a neighbor's enlarged operation. Mechanization meant less need for hired labor; farmers could operate more acres even though they were older. The result was a decline in rural-farm population, with gains in service centers that provided the new technology. The rural non-farm population grew as factories were attracted by access to good transportation without the high land costs, taxes, unionization and congestion of city factory districts.  Once remote rural areas such as the Missouri Ozarks and the North Woods of the upper Midwest, with a rustic life style and many good fishing spots, attracted retirees and vacationers.<ref>Mark Friedberger, \"The Transformation of the Rural Midwest, 1945\u20131985,\" ''Old Northwest,'' 1992, Vol. 16 Issue 1, pp 13-36</ref>\n\n==Civil Rights Movement==\n{{Main article|Civil Rights Movement}}\nFollowing the end of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], many states adopted restrictive [[Jim Crow law]]s which enforced segregation of the races and the second-class status of African Americans.  The Supreme Court in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896) accepted segregation as constitutional. [[Voting rights]] discrimination remained widespread through the 1950s. Fewer than 10% voted in the Deep South, although a larger proportion voted in the border states, and blacks in the northern urban areas had shifted wholesale to the Democrats during the New Deal era. Although both parties pledged progress in 1948, the only major development before 1954 was the integration of the military.<ref>Harvard Sitkoff, ''The Struggle for Black Equality'' (2008)</ref>\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1957 was the first piece of Federal civil rights legislation in almost a century, and would pave the way for the climactic Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\n===''Brown v.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decisions in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]] of [[Topeka]]'' (1954); ''[[Powell v. Alabama]]'' (1932); ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'' (1944); ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'' (1948); ''[[Sweatt v. Painter]]'' (1950); and ''[[McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents]]'' (1950) led to a shift in tactics, and from 1955 to 1965, \"direct action\" was the strategy&mdash;primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins, freedom rides, and social movements.\n\n''Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka'' was a landmark case of the United States Supreme Court which explicitly outlawed segregated public education facilities for blacks and whites, ruling so on the grounds that the doctrine of \"[[separate but equal]]\" public education could never truly provide black Americans with facilities of the same standards available to white Americans. One hundred and one members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] and 19 [[United States Senate|Senators]] signed \"[[The Southern Manifesto]]\" condemning the Supreme Court decision as unconstitutional.\n\nGovernor [[Orval Faubus|Orval Eugene Faubus]] (Democrat) of [[Arkansas]] used the Arkansas National Guard to prevent school integration at [[Little Rock Central High School]] in 1957. President Eisenhower (Republican) nationalized state forces and sent in the US Army to enforce federal court orders. Governors [[Ross Barnett]] of [[Mississippi]] and [[George Wallace]] of [[Alabama]] physically blocked school doorways at their respective states' universities.  [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham's]] public safety commissioner Eugene T. \"Bull\" Connor advocated violence against freedom riders and ordered fire hoses and police dogs turned on demonstrators during the 1963 [[Birmingham campaign|Birmingham Children's Crusade]]. Sheriff [[Jim Clark (sheriff)|Jim Clark]] of [[Dallas County, Alabama]], loosed his deputies during the \"[[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]]\" event of the [[Selma to Montgomery march]], injuring many of the marchers and personally menacing other protesters. Police all across the South arrested civil rights activists on trumped-up charges.\n\n===Civil rights organizations===\n[[File:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] speaking in [[Washington, D.C.]] at the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] in 1963]]\n\nAlthough they had white supporters and sympathizers, the Civil Rights Movement was designed, led, organized, and manned by African-Americans, who placed themselves and their families on the front lines in the struggle for freedom. Their heroism was brought home to every American through newspaper, and later, television reports as their peaceful marches and demonstrations were violently attacked by law enforcement. Officers used batons, bullwhips, fire hoses, police dogs, and mass arrests to intimidate the protesters. The second characteristic of the movement is that it was not monolithic, led by one or two men. Rather it was a dispersed, grass-roots campaign that attacked segregation in many different places using many different tactics.  While some groups and individuals within the civil rights movement&mdash;such as [[Malcolm X]]&mdash;advocated [[Black Power]], black separatism, or even armed resistance, the majority of participants remained committed to the principles of [[nonviolence]], a deliberate decision by an oppressed minority to abstain from violence for political gain. Using nonviolent strategies, civil rights activists took advantage of emerging national network-news reporting, especially television, to capture national attention.<ref>Taylor Branch,  ''Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, 1954\u20131963''  (1988)</ref>\n\nThe leadership role of black churches in the movement was a natural extension of their structure and function. They offered members an opportunity to exercise roles denied them in society. Throughout history, the black church served as a place of worship and also as a base for powerful ministers, such as Congressman [[Adam Clayton Powell Jr.|Adam Clayton Powell]] in New York City.  The most prominent clergyman in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] was [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] ''Time'' magazine's 1963 \"[[Time Person of the Year|Man of the Year]]\" showed tireless personal commitment to black freedom and his strong leadership won him worldwide acclaim and the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].\n\nStudents and seminarians in both the South and the [[Northern United States|North]] played key roles in every phase of the movement. Church and student-led movements, such as the [[Nashville Student Movement]], developed their own organizational and sustaining structures. The [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), founded in 1957, coordinated and raised funds, mostly from northern sources, for local protests and for the training of black leaders. The [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], or SNCC, founded in 1957, developed the \"jail-no-bail\" strategy. SNCC's role was to develop and link sit-in campaigns and to help organize freedom rides, voter registration drives, and other protest activities. These three new groups often joined forces with existing organizations such as the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), founded in 1909, the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE), founded in 1942, and the [[National Urban League]]. The NAACP and its Director, [[Roy Wilkins]], provided legal counsel for jailed demonstrators, helped raise bail, and continued to test segregation and discrimination in the courts as it had been doing for half a century. CORE initiated the 1961 [[Freedom Rides]] which involved many SNCC members, and CORE's leader [[James L. Farmer, Jr.|James Farmer]] later became executive secretary of SNCC. \nThe administration of President [[John F. Kennedy]] supported enforcement of desegregation in schools and public facilities. Attorney General [[Robert Kennedy]] brought more than 50 lawsuits in four states to secure black Americans' right to vote. However, [[FBI]] director [[J. Edgar Hoover]], concerned about possible communist influence in the civil rights movement and personally antagonistic to King, used the FBI to discredit King and other civil rights leaders.<ref>James Giglio,  ''The Presidency of John F. Kennedy'' (1991),</ref>\n\n==Presidential administrations==\n\n===Truman: 1945\u20131953===\n{{Main article|Presidency of Harry S. Truman}}\nTruman, a self-educated farm boy from [[Missouri]], stood in sharp contrast to the urbane and imperious Roosevelt who kept personal control of all major decisions.<ref>Alonzo L. Hamby, ''Man of the People: A Life of Harry S. Truman'' (1995)</ref> Truman was a folksy, unassuming president who relied on his cabinet, remarking \"[[The buck stops here]]\" and \"If you can't stand the heat, you better get out of the kitchen.\"<ref>[[David McCullough]], ''[[Truman (book)|Truman]]'' (1992) p 717</ref>  Truman faced many challenges in domestic affairs. His poll ratings were sky high when he took office in April 1945 after Roosevelt's sudden death, then plunged to low levels for most of his eight years in office. The disorderly postwar reconversion of the economy of the United States was marked by severe shortages of housing, meat, appliance, automobiles and other rationed goods. The country was hit by long strikes in major industries in 1946, and Truman's unpopularity was such that the GOP regained Congress in a landslide during the midterms that year, and proceeded to pass the [[Taft\u2013Hartley Act]] over his veto. He used executive orders to end racial discrimination in the armed forces and created loyalty checks that dismissed thousands of communist fellow travelers from office. Truman's presidency was also eventful in [[Foreign relations of the United States|foreign affairs]], with the defeat of Nazi Germany and his decision to use [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear weapons against Japan]], the founding of the [[United Nations]], the [[Marshall Plan]] of 1948 to rebuild Europe, the [[Truman Doctrine]] of 1947 to contain communism, the beginning of the [[Cold War]], the [[Berlin Airlift]] of 1948, and in 1949 the creation of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military alliance]].\n\nTruman confounded all predictions to win election in [[1948 United States presidential election|1948]], helped by his famous [[Whistle stop train tour|Whistle Stop Tour]] which reinvigorated the [[New Deal Coalition]]. In addition, the short-lived GOP dominance of Congress was ended as the Democratic Party regained a comfortable majority in both houses, something they would surrender only once in the next 32 years. His victory validated his domestic liberalism, his foreign policy of containment, and the new federal commitment to civil rights.<ref>Andrew E. Busch, ''Truman's Triumphs: The 1948 Election and the Making of Postwar America'' (2012)</ref>\n\nThe defeat of America's wartime ally in the [[Chinese Civil War]] brought a hostile Communist regime to China under [[Mao Zedong]]. Soon the US became bogged down fighting China in the [[Korean War]], 1950\u201353. Corruption in Truman's administration, which was linked to cabinet-level appointees and senior White House staff, was a central issue in the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 presidential campaign]]. Truman's third term hopes were dashed by a poor showing in the 1952 primaries. Republican [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the famous wartime general, won a [[1952 United States presidential election|landslide in the 1952 presidential election]] by campaigning against Truman's failures in terms of \"Communism, Korea and Corruption.\"<ref>Richard S. Kirkendall, ''Harry S. Truman Encyclopedia'' (1990)</ref>\n\n===Eisenhower: 1953\u20131961===\n{{Main article|Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower}}\nEisenhower had been a prospective presidential candidate since the end of World War II, and although he publicly announced himself a Republican, he declined the party's offers to run in 1948. However, four years later, he reconsidered, in part because he believed the Democratic Party had had a monopoly on power for too long (control of the White House for 19 straight years and Congress for 16 of the last 19 years) and it was necessary to restore a proper two party balance. Also, the GOP in their desperation to regain power had begun supporting controversial figures such as Joseph McCarthy. As a national hero, Eisenhower carried every major demographic bloc and all states outside the South in the 1952 presidential election. He ended the Korean War, maintained the peace in Asia and the Middle East, and worked smoothly with NATO allies in Europe while keeping the [[Containment|policy of containing Communism]] rather than trying to [[rollback|roll it back]].<ref>Richard A. Melanson and David Mayers, eds., ''Reevaluating Eisenhower: American Foreign Policy in the Fifties'' (1988)</ref>\n\nWhile frugal in budget matters he expanded Social Security and did not try to repeal the remaining [[New Deal]] programs. He launched the interstate highway system (using a tax on gasoline) that dramatically improved the nation's transportation infrastructure.<ref>Dan McNichol, ''The Roads That Built America: The Incredible Story of the U.S. Interstate System'' (2005)</ref> The economy was generally healthy, apart from a sharp economic recession in 1958.<ref>Harold G. Vatter, ''The U. S. Economy in the 1950s: An Economic History'' (1984)</ref>  Eisenhower remained  popular and largely avoided partisan politics; he was reelected by a landslide in 1956.\n\nIn both foreign and domestic policy Eisenhower remained on friendly terms with the Democrats, who regained Congress in 1954 and made large gains in 1958.  His farewell address to the nation warned of the dangers of a growing \"[[military\u2013industrial complex]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=old&doc=90 |title=Our Documents - President Dwight D.

Kennedy]] of [[Massachusetts]]. Historians have explained Kennedy's victory in terms of an economic recession, the numerical dominance of 17 million more registered Democrats than Republicans, the votes that Kennedy gained among Catholics practically matched the votes Nixon gained among Protestants,<ref>Shaun A. Casey, ''The Making of a Catholic President: Kennedy vs. Nixon, 1960'' (2009)</ref> Kennedy's better organization, and Nixon's superior campaigning skills.  Nixon's emphasis on his experience carried little weight, and he wasted energy by campaigning in all 50 states instead of concentrating on the swing states. Kennedy used his large, well-funded campaign organization to win the nomination, secure endorsements, and with the aid of the last of the big-city bosses, to get out the vote in the big cities. He relied on Johnson to hold the South and used television effectively.<ref>Hal Brands, \"Burying Theodore White: Recent Accounts of the 1960 Presidential Election,\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 2010.  Vol. 40#2  pp 364+.</ref><ref>W. J.  Rorabaugh, ''The Real Making of the President: Kennedy, Nixon, and the 1960 Election'' (2009)</ref> Kennedy was the first Catholic to run for president since [[Al Smith]]'s ill-fated campaign in 1928.  Voters were polarized on religious grounds, but Kennedy's election was a transforming event for Catholics, who finally realized they were accepted in America, and it marked the virtual end of anti-Catholicism as a political force.<ref>Lawrence H. Fuchs, ''John F. Kennedy and American Catholicism'' (1967)</ref>\n\n====Presidency====\n{{Main article|Presidency of John F. Kennedy}}\nThe Kennedy Family had long been leaders of the Irish Catholic wing of the Democratic Party; JFK was middle-of-the-road or liberal on domestic issues and conservative on foreign policy, sending military forces into Cuba and Vietnam. The Kennedy style called for youth, dynamism, vigor and an intellectual approach to aggressive new policies in foreign affairs. The downside was his inexperience in foreign affairs, standing in stark contrast to the vast experience of the president he replaced.  He is best known for his call to [[Republicanism in the United States|civic virtue]]: \"And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country.\"  In Congress the [[Conservative Coalition]] blocked nearly all of Kennedy's domestic programs, so there were few changes in domestic policy, even as the civil rights movement gained momentum.<ref>James Giglio, ''The Presidency of John F. Kennedy'' (1991)</ref>\n\n=====Assassination=====\n{{Main article|Assassination of John F. Kennedy}}\n[[John F. Kennedy assassination|President Kennedy was assassinated]] in [[Dallas]], Texas, on November 22, 1963 by [[Lee Harvey Oswald]].  The event proved to be one of the greatest psychological shocks to the American people in the 20th century and led to Kennedy being revered as a martyr and hero.\n\n===Johnson, 1963\u20131969===\n{{Main article|Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson}}\nAfter Kennedy's assassination, vice president Lyndon Baines Johnson served out the remainder of the term, using appeals to finish the job that Kennedy had started to pass a remarkable package of liberal legislation that he called the [[Great Society]]. Johnson used the full powers of the presidency to ensure passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. These actions helped Johnson to win a historic landslide in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]] over conservative champion Senator [[Barry Goldwater]]. Johnson's big victory brought an overwhelming liberal majority in Congress.<ref>Randall Woods, ''LBJ: Architect of American Ambition'' (2006).</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of the United States (1964\u20131980)]]\n* [[Post\u2013World War II boom]]\n* [[United States in the 1950s]]\n* [[Timeline of United States history (1930\u20131949)]]\n* [[Timeline of United States history (1950\u20131969)]]\n* [[Presidency of Franklin D.

It was also a time of confrontation as the capitalist United States and its allies politically opposed the Soviet Union and other communist countries; the [[Cold War]] had begun. African Americans united and organized, and a triumph of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] ended [[Jim Crow]] segregation in the South.<ref>James T. Patterson, ''Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945\u20131974'' (1988) pp 771-90</ref> Further laws were passed that made discrimination illegal and provided federal oversight to guarantee voting rights.\n\nEarly in the period, an active foreign policy was pursued to help Western Europe and Asia recover from the devastation of [[World War II]]. The [[Marshall Plan]] helped Western Europe rebuild from wartime devastation. The main American goal was to contain the expansion of [[Communism]], which was controlled by the [[Soviet Union]] until [[Sino-Soviet split|China broke away]] about 1960. An arms race escalated through increasingly powerful nuclear weapons. The Soviets formed the [[Warsaw Pact]] of European satellites to oppose the American-led [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) alliance.  The U.S. fought a bloody, inconclusive war in [[Korean War|Korea]] and was escalating the war in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] as the period ended.  The Communists took power in Cuba, and when the USSR sent in nuclear missiles to defend it, the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962 was triggered with the U.S., the most dangerous point of the era.<ref>Alan P. Dobson and Steve Marsh, ''US foreign policy since 1945'' (2006) pp 18-29, 76-90</ref>\n\nOn the domestic front, after a short transition, the economy grew rapidly, with widespread prosperity, rising wages, and the movement of most of the remaining farmers to the towns and cities. Politically, the era was dominated by liberal Democrats who held together the [[New Deal Coalition]]: [[Harry Truman]] (1945\u20131953), [[John F. Kennedy]] (1961\u20131963) and [[Lyndon Johnson]] (1963\u20131969). Republican [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (1953\u20131961) was a moderate who did not attempt to reverse New Deal programs such as regulation of business and support for labor unions; he expanded Social Security and built the interstate highway system. For most of the period, the Democrats controlled Congress; however, they were usually unable to pass as much liberal legislation as they had hoped because of the power of the [[Conservative Coalition]].  The [[Modern liberalism in the United States#Liberal coalition|Liberal coalition]] took control of Congress after Kennedy's assassination in 1963, and launched the [[Great Society]].<ref>[[Alonzo L. Hamby]], ''Liberalism and Its Challengers: From F.D.R. to Bush''  (2nd ed. 1992)  pp 52-139</ref>\n\nThis period witnessed the rise of suburbs and a growing middle class. [[Communitarianism]] and measurable [[social capital]] was at its highest point during this time. <ref>Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community by Robert D. Putnam</ref>\n\n==Cold War==\n{{Main article|Cold War (1947\u20131953)|Cold War (1953\u20131962)|Culture during the Cold War}}\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:EasternBloc BorderChange38-48.svg|right|thumb|Post-war territorial changes in Europe and the formation of the Eastern Bloc, the western border is  the \"[[Iron Curtain]]\".]]\n\nWhile Roosevelt was confident he could deal with Stalin after the war, Truman was much more suspicious. The United States provided large-scale grants to Western Europe  under the [[Marshall Plan]] (1948 - 1951), leading to a rapid economic recovery. The Soviet Union refused to allow its satellites to receive American aid. Instead, the Kremlin used local Communist parties, and the Red army, to control Eastern Europe in totalitarian fashion.<ref>Anne Applebaum, ''Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe, 1944\u20131956'' (2012) p. xxii - xxv.</ref>   Britain, in deep financial trouble, could no longer support Greece in its civil war with the communists. They asked the United States to take over their role in Greece. With bipartisan support in Congress, Truman responded with the [[Truman Doctrine]] in 1947. Truman followed the intellectual leadership of the State Department, which, especially under the guidance of [[George F. Kennan]], called for [[containment]] of Soviet communist expansion. The idea was that internal contradictions, such as diverse nationalism,  would ultimately undermine Soviet ambitions.<ref>Carole K. Fink, ''Cold War: An International History'' (2013) pp 53-79.</ref> \n\nBy 1947, the Soviets had fully absorbed the three Baltic nations, and effectively controlled Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia,  Romania, and Bulgaria. Austria and Finland were neutral and demilitarized.  The Kremlin did not control Yugoslavia, which had a separate communist regime under [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshall Tito]]; They had a permanent bitter break in 1948. The Cold War lines stabilized in Europe along the [[Iron Curtain]], and there was no fighting. The United States helped form a strong military alliance in [[NATO]] in 1949 including most of the nations of Western Europe, and Canada.  In Asia, however, there was much more movement. The United States failed to negotiate a settlement between its ally, nationalist China under [[Chiang Kai-shek]], and the Communists under [[Mao Zedong]]. The Communists took over [[History of China|China]] in 1949 and the nationalist government moved to the offshore island of Formosa (Taiwan), which came under American protection. Local communist movements attempted to take over all of Korea (1950) and Vietnam (1954). Communist hegemony covered one third of the world's land while the United States emerged as the world's more influential superpower, and formed a worldwide network of military alliances.<ref>John Lewis Gaddis, ''The Cold War: A New History'' (2006) pp 31-95</ref>\n\nThere were fundamental contrasts between the visions of the United States and the Soviet Union, between capitalist democracy and totalitarian communism.  The United States envisioned the new [[United Nations]] as a [[Wilsonian]] tool to resolve future troubles, but it failed in that purpose. The U.S. rejected totalitarianism and colonialism, in line with the principles laid down by the [[Atlantic Charter]] of 1941: self-determination, equal economic access, and a rebuilt capitalist, democratic Europe that could again serve as a hub in world affairs.<ref>Townsend Hoopes and Douglas Brinkley, ''FDR and the Creation of the U.N.'' (2000)  pp 205-22</ref>\n\n===Containment===\n{{Main article|Containment}}\nFor NATO, containment of the expansion of Soviet influence became foreign policy doctrine; the expectation was that eventually the inefficient Soviet system would collapse of internal weakness, and no \"hot\" war (that is, one with large-scale combat) would be necessary. Containment was supported by Republicans (led by Senator [[Arthur Vandenberg]] of Michigan, Governor [[Thomas Dewey]] of New York, and general [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]), but was opposed by the isolationists led by Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] of Ohio.\n\n===1949\u20131953===\nIn 1949, the communist leader [[Mao Zedong]] won control of mainland China in a civil war, proclaimed the [[People's Republic of China]], then traveled to Moscow where he negotiated the [[Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship]]. China had thus moved from a close ally of the U.S. to a bitter enemy, and the two fought each other starting in late 1950 in Korea.  The Truman administration responded with a secret 1950 plan, [[NSC 68]], designed to confront the Communists with large-scale defense spending.   The Russians had built an atomic bomb by 1949\u2014much sooner than expected; Truman ordered the development of the [[hydrogen bomb]]. [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Two of the spies]] who gave atomic secrets to Russia were tried and executed.\n\nFrance was hard-pressed by Communist insurgents in the [[First Indochina War]]. The U.S. in 1950 started to fund the French effort on the proviso that the Vietnamese be given more autonomy.\n\n===Korean War===\n{{Main article|Korean War}}\n\nStalin approved a [[North Korea]]n plan to invade U.S.-supported [[South Korea]] in June 1950. President Truman immediately and unexpectedly implemented the containment policy by a full-scale commitment of American and UN forces to Korea. He did not consult or gain approval of Congress but did gain the approval of the [[United Nations]] (UN) to drive back the North Koreans and re-unite that country in terms of a [[rollback]] strategy.<ref>The Soviets were boycotting the UN at that time (because it would not admit the [[People's Republic of China]]) and so was not present to veto Truman's actions.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=James I. |last=Matray |title=Truman's Plan for Victory: National Self-Determination and the Thirty-Eighth Parallel Decision in Korea |journal=[[Journal of American History]] |volume=66 |issue=2 |year=1979 |pages=314\u2013333 |jstor=1900879 |doi=10.2307/1900879 }}</ref>\n\nAfter a few weeks of retreat, General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s success at the [[Battle of Inchon]] turned the war around; UN forces invaded North Korea.  This advantage was lost when hundreds of thousands of Chinese entered an undeclared war against the United States and pushed the US/UN/Korean forces back to the original starting line, the 38th parallel. The war became a stalemate, with over 33,000 American dead and 100,000 wounded <ref>{{cite web|url=http://siadapp.dior.whs.mil/personnel/CASUALTY/korea.pdf |accessdate=2006-09-27 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927211600/http://siadapp.dior.whs.mil/personnel/CASUALTY/korea.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-27 }}</ref> but nothing to show for it except a resolve to continue the containment policy.  Truman fired MacArthur but was unable to end the war.  [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in 1952 campaigned against Truman's failures of \"Korea, Communism and Corruption,\" promising to go to Korea himself and end the war. By threatening to use nuclear weapons in 1953, Eisenhower ended the war with a truce that is still in effect.<ref>Spencer Tucker, ed.

The challenge of rooting out Communists from labor unions and the Democratic Party was successfully undertaken by liberals, such as [[Walter Reuther]] of the autoworkers union<ref>Martin Halpern, \"Taft-Hartley and the Defeat of the Progressive Alternative in the United Auto Workers,\" ''Labor History,'' Spring 1986, Vol. 27 Issue 2, pp 204-26</ref> and [[Ronald Reagan]] of the Screen Actors Guild (Reagan was a liberal Democrat at the time).<ref>Lou Cannon, ''President Reagan: the role of a lifetime'' (2000) p. 245</ref>  Many of the purged leftists joined the presidential campaign in 1948 of FDR's Vice President [[Henry A.

Nixon]] playing a central role, accused [[Alger Hiss]], a top Roosevelt aide, of being a Communist spy, using testimony and documents provided by [[Whittaker Chambers]]. Hiss was convicted and sent to prison, with the anti-Communists gaining a powerful political weapon.<ref>Sam Tanenhaus, ''Whittaker Chambers: a biography'' (1988)</ref>  It launched Nixon's meteoric rise to the Senate (1950) and the vice presidency (1952).<ref>Roger Morris, ''Richard Milhous Nixon: The Rise of an American Politician'' (1991)</ref>\n\nWith anxiety over Communism in Korea and China reaching fever pitch in 1950, a previously obscure Senator, [[Joe McCarthy]] of Wisconsin, launched Congressional investigations into the cover-up of spies in the government. McCarthy dominated the media, and used reckless allegations and tactics that allowed his opponents to effectively counterattack.  Irish Catholics (including conservative wunderkind [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] and the [[Kennedy Family]]) were intensely anti-Communist and defended McCarthy (a  fellow Irish Catholic).<ref>William F. Buckley and L. Brent Bozell, ''Mccarthy and His Enemies: The Record and Its Meaning'' (1954)</ref>  Paterfamilias [[Joseph Kennedy]] (1888\u20131969), a very active conservative Democrat, was McCarthy's most ardent supporter and got his son [[Robert F. Kennedy]] a job with McCarthy.  McCarthy had talked of \"twenty years of treason\" (i.e. since Roosevelt's election in 1932). When, in 1953, he started talking of \"21 years of treason\" and launched a major attack on the Army for promoting a Communist dentist in the medical corps, his recklessness proved too much for Eisenhower, who encouraged Republicans to censure McCarthy formally in 1954. The Senator's power collapsed overnight. Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] did not vote for censure.<ref>Richard M. Fried, ''Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective'' (1990)</ref>  Buckley went on to found the ''[[National Review]]'' in 1955 as a weekly magazine that helped [[Conservatism in the United States|define the conservative position on public issues]].\n\n\"McCarthyism\" was expanded to include attacks on supposed Communist influence in Hollywood, which resulted in a black-list whereby artists who refused to testify about possible Communist connections could not get work. Some famous celebrities (such as [[Charlie Chaplin]]) left the U.S.; other worked under pseudonyms (such as [[Dalton Trumbo]]).  McCarthyism included investigations into academics and teachers as well.<ref>Ellen Schrecker, ''The Age of McCarthyism: A Brief History with Documents'' (2d ed. 2002)</ref>\n\n===Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations===\n[[File:JohnFosterDulles.jpeg|framed|John Foster Dulles]]\n{{Main|Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Presidency of John F. Kennedy}}\nIn 1953, Stalin died, and after the [[U.S. presidential election, 1952|1952 presidential election]], President Dwight D. Eisenhower used the opportunity to end the Korean War, while continuing Cold War policies.  Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] was the dominant figure in the nation's foreign policy in the 1950s.  Dulles denounced the \"containment\" of the Truman administration and espoused an active program of \"liberation\", which would lead to a \"[[rollback]]\" of communism. The most prominent of those doctrines was the policy of \"[[massive retaliation]]\", which Dulles announced early in 1954, eschewing the costly, conventional ground forces characteristic of the Truman administration in favor of wielding the vast superiority of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and covert intelligence. Dulles defined this approach as \"[[brinkmanship]]\".<ref>Chester J. Pach and Elmo Richardson, ''Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower'' (1991)</ref>\n\nA dramatic shock to Americans' self-confidence and its technological superiority came in 1957, when the Soviets beat the United States into outer space by launching [[Sputnik]], the first earth satellite. The space race began, and by the early 1960s the United States had forged ahead, with President Kennedy promising to land a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s\u2014the landing indeed took place on July 20, 1969.<ref>Paul Dickson, ''Sputnik: the shock of the century'' (2003)</ref>\n\nTrouble close to home appeared when [[Fidel Castro]] took control of [[Cuban Revolution|Cuba in 1959]] and forged increasingly  close ties with the Soviet Union, becoming communism's center in Latin America. The United States responded with an economic boycott of Cuba, and a large-scale economic support program for Latin America under Kennedy, the [[Alliance for Progress]].\n\nEast Germany was the weak point in the Soviet empire, with refugees leaving for the West by the thousands every week. The Soviet solution came in 1961, with the [[Berlin Wall]] to stop East Germans from fleeing communism. This was a major propaganda setback for the USSR, but it did allow them to keep control of East Berlin.<ref>Frederick Taylor, ''The Berlin Wall: A World Divided, 1961\u20131989'' (2008)</ref>\n\nThe Communist world split in half, as [[Sino-Soviet split|China turned against the Soviet Union]]; Mao denounced Khrushchev for going soft on capitalism. However, the US failed to take advantage of this split until President [[Richard Nixon]] saw the opportunity in 1969.  In 1958, the U.S. sent troops into [[Lebanon]] for nine months to stabilize a country on the verge of civil war. Between 1954 and 1961, Eisenhower dispatched large sums of economic and military aid and 695 military advisers to [[South Vietnam]] to stabilize the pro-western government under attack by insurgents.  Eisenhower supported CIA efforts to undermine anti-American governments, which proved most successful in Iran and Guatemala.<ref>Stephen E. Ambrose, ''Ike's spies: Eisenhower and the espionage establishment'' (1999)</ref>\n\nThe first major strain among the NATO alliance occurred in 1956 when Eisenhower forced Britain and France to retreat from their [[Suez crisis|invasion of Egypt]] (with [[Israel]]) which was intended to get back their ownership of the [[Suez Canal]]. Instead of supporting the claims of its NATO partners, the Eisenhower administration stated that it opposed French and British imperial adventurism in the region by sheer prudence, fearing that Egyptian leader [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]'s standoff with the region's old colonial powers would bolster Soviet power in the region.<ref>Cole Christian Kingseed, ''Eisenhower and the Suez Crisis of 1956'' (1995)</ref>\n\nThe Cold War reached its most dangerous point during the Kennedy administration in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], a tense confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba. The crisis began on October 16, 1962, and lasted for thirteen days. It was the moment when the Cold War was closest to exploding into a devastating nuclear exchange between the two superpower nations. Kennedy decided not to invade or bomb Cuba but to institute a naval blockade of the island. The crisis ended in a compromise, with the Soviets removing their missiles publicly, and the United States secretly removing its nuclear missiles in Turkey.  In Moscow, Communist leaders removed [[Nikita Khrushchev]] because of his reckless behavior.<ref>Don Munton and David A. Welch, ''The Cuban Missile Crisis: A Concise History'' (2006)</ref>\n\n==The Affluent Society==\n{{Further information|United States in the 1950s|Post\u2013World War II economic expansion|Culture during the Cold War}}\nWartime rationing was officially lifted in September 1945, but prosperity did not immediately return as the next three years would witness the difficult transition back to a peacetime economy. 12 million returning veterans were in need of work and in many cases could not find it. Inflation became a rather serious problem, averaging over 10% a year until 1950 and raw materials shortages dogged manufacturing industry. In addition, labor strikes rocked the nation, in some cases exacerbated by racial tensions due to African-Americans having taken jobs during the war and now being faced with irate returning veterans who demanded that they step aside. Munitions factories shut down and temporary workers returned home. Following the Republican takeover of Congress in the 1946 elections, President Truman was compelled to reduce taxes and curb government interference in the economy. With this done, the stage was set for the economic boom that, with only a few minor hiccups, would last for the next 23 years.  Between 1945 and 1960, GNP grew by 250%, expenditures on new construction multiplied nine times, and consumption on personal services increased three times. By 1960, per capita income was 35% higher than in 1945, and America had entered what the economist Walt Rostow referred to as the \"high mass consumption\" stage of economic development. Short-term credit went up from $8.4 billion in 1946 to $45.6 billion in 1958. As a result of the postwar economic boom, 60% of the American population had attained a \"middle-class\" standard of living by the mid-50s (defined as incomes of $3,000 to $10,000 in constant dollars), compared with only 31% in the last year of prosperity before the onset of the Great Depression. By the end of the decade, 87% of families owned a TV set, 75% a car, and 75% a washing machine. Between 1947 and 1960, the average real income for American workers increased by as much as it had in the previous half-century.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">The Unfinished Journey: America Since World War II by William H. Chafe</ref>\n\nProsperity and overall optimism made Americans feel that it was a good time to bring children into the world, and so a huge baby boom resulted during the decade following 1945 (the baby boom climaxed during the mid-1950s, after which birthrates gradually dropped off until going below replacement level in 1965). Although the overall number of children per woman was not unusually high (averaging 2.3), they were assisted by improving technology that greatly brought down infant mortality rates versus the prewar era. Among other things, this resulted in an unprecedented demand for children's products and a huge expansion of the public school system. The large size of the postwar baby boom generation would have significant social repercussions in American society for decades to come.\n\nIn 1963, [[Betty Friedan]] published her book ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' which ridiculed the housewife role of women during the postwar years; it was a best-seller and a major catalyst of the [[women's liberation movement]].\n\nThe American economy grew dramatically in the post-war period, expanding at a rate of 3.5% per annum between 1945 and 1970. During this period of prosperity, many incomes doubled in a generation, described by economist [[Frank Levy]] as \"upward mobility on a rocket ship.\" The substantial increase in average family income within a generation resulted in millions of office and factory workers being lifted into a growing middle class, enabling them to sustain a standard of living once considered to be reserved for the wealthy.<ref>Nancy Wiefek, ''The impact of economic anxiety in postindustrial America'' (2003) p 3</ref> As noted by Deone Zell, assembly line work paid well, while unionized factory jobs served as \"stepping-stones to the middle class.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Changing by design: organizational innovation at Hewlett-Packard by Deone Zell</ref> By the end of the Fifties, 87% of all American families owned at least one T.V., 75% owned cars, and 60% owned their homes.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Nation's business: Volume 48, Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, 1960</ref> By 1960, blue-collar workers had become the biggest buyers of many luxury goods and services.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> In addition, by the early 1970s, post-World War II American consumers enjoyed higher levels of disposable income than those in any other country.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe great majority of American workers who had stable jobs were well off financially, while even non-union jobs were associated with rising paychecks, benefits, and obtained many of the advantages that characterized union work.<ref>Beth A.

Theirs was not an unobtainable dream; nor were their lives empty because of it. Indeed, for at least a quarter of century, the material promises of consumer-oriented Americanism were fulfilled in improvements in everyday life that made them the most affluent working class in American history.\"<ref>Ronald Edsforth and Larry Bennett, ''Popular culture and political change in modern America'' (1991) p 125</ref>\n\nBetween 1946 and 1960, the United States witnessed a significant expansion in the consumption of goods and services. GNP rose by 36% and personal consumption expenditures by 42%, cumulative gains which were reflected in the incomes of families and unrelated individuals. While the number of these units rose sharply from 43.3 million to 56.1 million in 1960, a rise of almost 23%, their average incomes grew even faster, from $3940 in 1946 to $6900 in 1960, an increase of 43%. After taking inflation into account, the real advance was 16%. The dramatic rise in the average American standard of living was such that, according to sociologist [[George Katona]]:\n:\"Today in this country minimum standards of nutrition, housing and clothing are assured, not for all, but for the majority. Beyond these minimum needs, such former luxuries as homeownership, durable goods, travel, recreation, and entertainment are no longer restricted to a few. The broad masses participate in enjoying all these things and generate most of the demand for them.\"<ref>George Katona, ''The mass consumption society'' (1964) p 5</ref>\n\nMore than 21 million housing units were constructed between 1946 and 1960, and in the latter year 52% of consumer units in the metropolitan areas owned their own homes. In 1957, out of all the wired homes throughout the country, 96% had a refrigerator, 87% an electric washer, 81% a television, 67% a vacuum cleaner, 18% a freezer, 12% an electric or gas dryer, and 8% air conditioning. Car ownership also soared, with 72% of consumer units owning an automobile by 1960.<ref name=\"Bernstein\"/> From 1958 to 1964, the average weekly take-home pay of blue-collar workers rose steadily from $68 to $78 (in constant dollars).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MQKinXkAJLUC&pg=PA37&dq=america+blue-collar+consumer+spending+1965#v=onepage&q=america%20blue-collar%20consumer%20spending%201965&f=false |title=Beyond the Liberal Consensus: A Political History of the United States Since ... |author=Iwan W.

The forty-hour workweek established by the Fair Labor Standards Act in covered industries became the actual schedule in most workplaces by 1960, while uncovered workers such as farmworkers and the self-employed worked fewer hours than they had done previously, although they still worked much longer hours than most other workers. Paid vacations also came to be enjoyed by the vast majority of workers, with 91% of blue-collar workers covered by major collective bargaining agreements receiving paid vacations by 1957 (usually to a maximum of three weeks), while by the early Sixties virtually all industries paid for holidays and most did so for seven days a year. Industries catering to leisure activities blossomed as a result of most Americans enjoying significant paid leisure time by 1960,<ref name=\"Bernstein\"/> while many blue-collar and white-collar workers had come to expect to hold on to their jobs for life.<ref>Stephen J. Whitfield, ''A companion to 20th-century America''</ref> This period saw the growth of [[motel]]s along major highways, as well as [[amusement park]]s such as [[Disneyland]], which opened in 1955.\n\nEducational outlays were also greater than in other countries while a higher proportion of young people were graduating from high schools and universities than elsewhere in the world, as hundreds of new colleges and universities opened every year.

Forest and Kevin Kinser, ''Higher Education in the United States: An Encyclopedia'' (2002) p 98</ref> At the advanced level American science, engineering and medicine was world-famous. By the mid-Sixties, the majority of American workers enjoyed the highest wage levels in the world,<ref>American Labor by Henry Pelling</ref> and by the late Sixties, the great majority of Americans were richer than people in other countries, except Sweden, Switzerland, and Canada. Educational outlays were also greater than in other countries while a higher proportion of young people was at school and college than elsewhere in the world. As noted by the historian [[John Vaizey]]:\n\n\"To strike a balance with the Soviet Union, it would be easy to say that all but the very poorest Americans were better off than the Russians, that education was better but the health service worse, but that above all the Americans had freedom of expression and democratic institutions.\"<ref>Social Democracy by John Vaizey</ref>\n\nIn regards to social welfare, the postwar era saw a considerable improvement in insurance for workers and their dependents against the risks of illness, as private insurance programs like Blue Cross and Blue Shield expanded. With the exception of farm and domestic workers, virtually all members of the labor force were covered by Social Security. In 1959 about two-thirds of the factory workers and three-fourths of the office workers were provided with supplemental private pension plans. In addition 86% of factory workers and 83% of office workers had jobs that covered for hospital insurance while 59% and 61% had additional insurance for doctors.<ref name=\"Bernstein\"/> By 1969, the average white family income had risen to $10,953, while the average black family income lagged behind at $7,255, revealing a continued racial disparity in income amongst various segments of the American population.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lI89AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA140&dq=American+median+household+income+1969#v=onepage&q=American%20median%20household%20income%201969&f=false |title=An Atlas of North American Affairs |author1=David Keith Adams |author2=H.

There were also three recessions, the first in 1953-54 following the end of the Korean War, the second in 1958, and the third in 1960-61. In each case, the Republican Party, which had begun the Eisenhower era with a plurality in Congress, suffered the consequences. In the 1954 midterms, the Democrats regained a solid majority of both houses and they would retain an unbroken control of the Senate until 1981 and the House until 1995. The 1958 recession cost the GOP yet more seats, and the 1960 recession was used by John F. Kennedy as cannon fodder against the Republicans in his presidential run.\n\nUnemployment peaked at 7% in the spring of 1961 before an economic rebound began that would continue to the end of the decade. President Kennedy then decided to break with the New Deal orthodoxy of high Federal taxes to force income equality. In a December 1962 speech, he announced his plans to reduce the top marginal tax rate to 75%, which one GOP Congressman wryly dubbed \"the most Republican speech a president has made since McKinley\". Although the president did not live to see his tax proposal passed, Lyndon Johnson quickly steered it through Congress, and by late 1965, real GDP growth was exceeding 6% a year.\n\n===Suburbia===\n[[File:LevittownPA.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Aerial view of [[Levittown, Pennsylvania]], circa 1959]]Very little housing had been built during the Great Depression and World War, except for emergency quarters near war industries. Overcrowded and inadequate apartments was the common condition. Some suburbs had developed around large cities where there was rail transportation to the jobs downtown. However, the real growth in suburbia depended on the availability of automobiles, highways, and inexpensive housing. The population had grown, and the stock of family savings had accumulated the money for down payments, automobiles and appliances. The product was a great housing boom. Whereas an average of 316,000 new housing nonfarm units had been constructed each year from the 1930s through 1945, there were 1,450,000 built annually from 1946 through 1955 in all areas, especially suburbs.<ref>U.S. Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States '' (1976) series H-156</ref> The G.I. Bill guaranteed low cost loans for veterans, with very low down payments, and low interest rates. With 16 million eligible veterans, the opportunity to buy a house was suddenly at hand. In 1947 alone, 540,000 veterans bought one; their average price was $7300. The construction industry kept prices low by standardization \u2013 for example standardizing sizes for kitchen cabinets, refrigerators, and stoves allowed for mass production of kitchen furnishings. Developers purchased empty land just outside the city, installed tract houses based on a handful of designs, and provided streets and utilities, as local public officials race to build schools.<ref>Joseph Goulden, ''The Best Years, 1945\u20131950'' (1976) pp 135-39.</ref> The most famous development was [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]], in Long Island just east of New York City. It offered a new house for $1000 down, and $70 a month; it featured three bedrooms, fireplace, gas range and gas furnace, and a landscaped lot of 75 by 100 feet, all for a total price of $10,000. Veterans could get one with a much lower down payment.<ref>Barbara Mae Kelly, ''Expanding the American Dream: Building and Rebuilding Levittown'' (SUNY Press, 1993).</ref>  Growth of the suburbs was especially prominent in the [[Sunbelt]] regions of the country; one example of a suburb on the West Coast was [[Lakewood, California]], built largely to serve family of aviation workers.  Going hand-in-hand with suburban development was the rise of [[shopping mall]]s, [[fast-food restaurant]]s and [[Diner|coffee shop]]s.\n\nWith Detroit turning out automobiles as fast as possible, city dwellers gave up cramped apartments for a suburban life style centered around children and housewives, with the male breadwinner commuting to work.<ref>Rosalyn Baxandall and Elizabeth Ewen, ''Picture Windows: How the Suburbs Happened'' (2000)</ref> Suburbia encompassed  a third of the nation's population by 1960. The growth of suburbs was not only a result of postwar prosperity, but innovations of the single-family housing market with low interest rates on 20 and 30 year mortgages, and low down payments, especially for veterans. Meanwhile, the suburban population swelled because of the [[post\u2013World War II baby boom|baby boom]]. Suburbs provided larger homes for larger families, security from urban living, privacy, and space for consumer goods.<ref>Robert Fishman, ''Bourgeois Utopias: The Rise and Fall of Suburbia'' (1989)</ref>\n\n===Television and the consumer culture===\nAt the center of middle-class culture in the 1950s was a growing demand for consumer goods; a result of the postwar prosperity, the increase in variety and availability of consumer products, and television advertising. America generated a steadily growing demand for better automobiles, clothing, appliances, family vacations and higher education.  After the initial hurdles of the 1945-48 period were overcome, Americans found themselves flush with cash from wartime work due to there being little to buy for several years. The result was a mass consumer spending spree, with a huge and voracious demand for new homes, cars, and housewares. Increasing numbers enjoyed high wages, larger houses, better schools, more cars and home comforts like vacuum cleaners, washing machines&mdash;which were all made for labor-saving and to make housework easier. Inventions familiar in the early 21st century made their first appearance during this era. The live-in maid and cook, common features of middle-class homes at the beginning of the century, were virtually unheard of in the 1950s; only the very rich had servants. Householders enjoyed centrally heated homes with running hot water. New style furniture was bright, cheap, and light, and easy to move around.<ref>William H. Young and Nacy K. Young, ''The 1950s'' (2004) p 76</ref> As noted by [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] in 1958:\n\n\"the ordinary individual has access to amenities \u2013  foods, entertainments, personal transportation, and plumbing \u2013  in which not even the rich rejoiced a century ago.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1763989 |title=The Age of Affluence Revisited: Council Estates and Consumer Society in Britain, 1950\u20131970 &#124; Matthew Hollow |website=Academia.edu |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}</ref>  Television, a commodity virtually unheard of during the Second World War, was now prevalent in most American homes by the mid-to-late 1950s.  Americans now had a wide bevy of shows to choose from, ranging from sitcoms such ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' and ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' to music and variety shows such as ''[[American Bandstand]]'' and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', to fantasy programs such as ''[[Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]''.  Television also increasingly became a medium for which to advertise products.\n\nConsumerism represented one of the consequences (as well as one of the key ingredients) of the postwar economic boom. The initial quest for cars, appliances, and new furniture after the end of World War II quickly expanded into the mass consumption of goods, services, and recreational materials during the Fifties.\n\nIn addition to the huge domestic market for consumer items, the United States became \"the world's factory\", as it was the only major power whose soil had been untouched by the war. American money and manufactured goods flooded into Europe, South Korea, and Japan and helped in their reconstruction. US manufacturing dominance would be almost unchallenged for a quarter-century after 1945.\n\nProsperity also brought about the development of a distinct youth culture for the first time, as teenagers were not forced to work and support their family at young ages like in the past. This had its culmination in the development of new music genres such as rock-and-roll as well as fashion styles and subcultures, the most famous of which was the \"greaser\", a young male who drove [[motorcycle]]s, sported ducktail haircuts (which were widely banned in schools) and displayed a general disregard for the law and authority. The greaser phenomenon was kicked off by the controversial youth-oriented movies ''[[The Wild One]]'' (1953) starring [[Marlon Brando]] and ''[[Rebel Without A Cause]]'' (1955) starring [[James Dean]].\n\n===Science, technology and futurism===\nWith the prosperity of the era, the prevailing social attitude was one of belief in science, technology, progress, and futurism, although there had been signs of this trend since the 1930s. There was comparatively little nostalgia for the prewar era and the overall emphasis was on having everything new and more advanced than before. Nonetheless, the social conformity and consumerism of the 1950s often came under attack from intellectuals (e.g. [[Henry Miller]]'s books ''The Air-Conditioned Nightmare'' and ''Sunday After The War'') and there was a good deal of unrest fermenting under the surface of American society that would erupt during the following decade.\n\nOne of the key factors in postwar prosperity was a technology boom due to the experience of the war. Manufacturing had made enormous strides and it was now possible to produce consumer goods in quantities and levels of sophistication unseen before 1945. Acquisition of technology from occupied Germany also proved an asset, as it was sometimes more advanced than its American counterpart, especially in the optics and audio equipment fields. The typical automobile in 1950 was an average of $300 more expensive than the 1940 version, but also produced in twice the numbers. Luxury makes such as [[Cadillac]], which had been largely hand-built vehicles only available to the rich, now became a mass-produced car within the price range of the upper middle-class.\n\nThe rapid social and technological changes brought about a growing corporatization of America and the decline of smaller businesses, which often suffered from high postwar inflation and mounting operating costs. Newspapers declined in numbers and consolidated, both due to the above-mentioned factors and the event of TV news. The railroad industry, once one of the cornerstones of the American economy and an immense and often scorned influence on national politics, also suffered from the explosion in automobile sales and the construction of the interstate system. By the end of the 1950s, it was well into decline and by the 1970s became completely bankrupt, necessitating a takeover by the federal government. Smaller automobile manufacturers such as [[Nash Motors|Nash]], [[Studebaker]], and [[Packard]] were unable to compete with the Big Three in the new postwar world and gradually declined into oblivion over the next 15 years. Suburbanization caused the gradual movement of working-class people and jobs out of the inner cities as shopping centers displaced the traditional downtown stores. In time, this would have disastrous effects on urban areas.\n\n===Poverty and inequality in the postwar era===\n\nDespite the prosperity of the postwar era, a significant minority of Americans continued to live in poverty by the end of the Fifties. In 1947, 34% of all families earned less than $3,000 a year, compared with 22.1% in 1960. Nevertheless, between one-fifth to one-fourth of the population could not survive on the income they earned. The older generation of Americans did not benefit as much from the postwar economic boom especially as many had never recovered financially from the loss of their savings during the Great Depression. It was generally a given that the average 35-year-old in 1959 owned a better house and car than the average 65-year-old, who typically had nothing but a small Social Security pension for an income. Many blue-collar workers continued to live in poverty, with 30% of those employed in industry in 1958 receiving under $3,000 a year. In addition, individuals who earned more than $10,000 a year paid a lower proportion of their income in taxes than those who earned less than $2,000 a year.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1947, 60% of black families lived below the poverty level (defined in one study as below $3000 in 1968 dollars), compared with 23% of white families. In 1968, 23% of black families lived below the poverty level, compared with 9% of white families. In 1947, 11% of white families were affluent (defined as above $10,000 in 1968 dollars), compared with 3% of black families. In 1968, 42% of white families were defined as affluent, compared with 21% of black families. In 1947, 8% of black families received $7000 or more (in 1968 dollars) compared with 26% of white families. In 1968, 39% of black families received $7,000 or more, compared with 66% of white families. In 1960, the median for a married man of blue-collar income was $3,993 for blacks and $5,877 for whites. In 1969, the equivalent figures were $5,746 and $7,452, respectively.<ref>Sociology: Third Edition by Paul B. Horton and Chester L. Hunt, 1972</ref>\n\nAs Socialist leader [[Michael Harrington]] emphasized, there was still [[The Other America]].<ref>Michael Harrington, ''The Other America: Poverty in the United States'' (1962)</ref> Poverty declined sharply in the Sixties<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/45/item/8140?start_page=157 |title=1969 - Economic Report of the President - FRASER - St. Louis Fed |website=Fraser.stlouisfed.org |date=1969-01-01 }}</ref> as the [[New Frontier]] and [[Great Society]] especially helped older people.

Conkin, ''A Revolution Down on the Farm: The Transformation of American Agriculture since 1929'' (2009)</ref>  Friedberger argues that the postwar period saw an accelerating mechanization of agriculture, combined with new and better fertilizers and genetic manipulation of hybrid corn. It made for greater specialization and greater economic risks for the farmer. With rising land prices many sold their land and moved to town, the old farm becoming part of a neighbor's enlarged operation. Mechanization meant less need for hired labor; farmers could operate more acres even though they were older. The result was a decline in rural-farm population, with gains in service centers that provided the new technology. The rural non-farm population grew as factories were attracted by access to good transportation without the high land costs, taxes, unionization and congestion of city factory districts.  Once remote rural areas such as the Missouri Ozarks and the North Woods of the upper Midwest, with a rustic life style and many good fishing spots, attracted retirees and vacationers.<ref>Mark Friedberger, \"The Transformation of the Rural Midwest, 1945\u20131985,\" ''Old Northwest,'' 1992, Vol. 16 Issue 1, pp 13-36</ref>\n\n==Civil Rights Movement==\n{{Main article|Civil Rights Movement}}\nFollowing the end of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], many states adopted restrictive [[Jim Crow law]]s which enforced segregation of the races and the second-class status of African Americans.  The Supreme Court in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896) accepted segregation as constitutional. [[Voting rights]] discrimination remained widespread through the 1950s. Fewer than 10% voted in the Deep South, although a larger proportion voted in the border states, and blacks in the northern urban areas had shifted wholesale to the Democrats during the New Deal era. Although both parties pledged progress in 1948, the only major development before 1954 was the integration of the military.<ref>Harvard Sitkoff, ''The Struggle for Black Equality'' (2008)</ref>\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1957 was the first piece of Federal civil rights legislation in almost a century, and would pave the way for the climactic Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\n===''Brown v. Board of Education'' and \"massive resistance\"===\nIn the early days of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], litigation and lobbying were the focus of integration efforts. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decisions in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]] of [[Topeka]]'' (1954); ''[[Powell v. Alabama]]'' (1932); ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'' (1944); ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'' (1948); ''[[Sweatt v. Painter]]'' (1950); and ''[[McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents]]'' (1950) led to a shift in tactics, and from 1955 to 1965, \"direct action\" was the strategy&mdash;primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins, freedom rides, and social movements.\n\n''Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka'' was a landmark case of the United States Supreme Court which explicitly outlawed segregated public education facilities for blacks and whites, ruling so on the grounds that the doctrine of \"[[separate but equal]]\" public education could never truly provide black Americans with facilities of the same standards available to white Americans. One hundred and one members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] and 19 [[United States Senate|Senators]] signed \"[[The Southern Manifesto]]\" condemning the Supreme Court decision as unconstitutional.\n\nGovernor [[Orval Faubus|Orval Eugene Faubus]] (Democrat) of [[Arkansas]] used the Arkansas National Guard to prevent school integration at [[Little Rock Central High School]] in 1957. President Eisenhower (Republican) nationalized state forces and sent in the US Army to enforce federal court orders. Governors [[Ross Barnett]] of [[Mississippi]] and [[George Wallace]] of [[Alabama]] physically blocked school doorways at their respective states' universities.  [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham's]] public safety commissioner Eugene T. \"Bull\" Connor advocated violence against freedom riders and ordered fire hoses and police dogs turned on demonstrators during the 1963 [[Birmingham campaign|Birmingham Children's Crusade]]. Sheriff [[Jim Clark (sheriff)|Jim Clark]] of [[Dallas County, Alabama]], loosed his deputies during the \"[[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]]\" event of the [[Selma to Montgomery march]], injuring many of the marchers and personally menacing other protesters. Police all across the South arrested civil rights activists on trumped-up charges.\n\n===Civil rights organizations===\n[[File:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] speaking in [[Washington, D.C.]] at the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] in 1963]]\n\nAlthough they had white supporters and sympathizers, the Civil Rights Movement was designed, led, organized, and manned by African-Americans, who placed themselves and their families on the front lines in the struggle for freedom. Their heroism was brought home to every American through newspaper, and later, television reports as their peaceful marches and demonstrations were violently attacked by law enforcement. Officers used batons, bullwhips, fire hoses, police dogs, and mass arrests to intimidate the protesters. The second characteristic of the movement is that it was not monolithic, led by one or two men. Rather it was a dispersed, grass-roots campaign that attacked segregation in many different places using many different tactics.  While some groups and individuals within the civil rights movement&mdash;such as [[Malcolm X]]&mdash;advocated [[Black Power]], black separatism, or even armed resistance, the majority of participants remained committed to the principles of [[nonviolence]], a deliberate decision by an oppressed minority to abstain from violence for political gain. Using nonviolent strategies, civil rights activists took advantage of emerging national network-news reporting, especially television, to capture national attention.<ref>Taylor Branch,  ''Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, 1954\u20131963''  (1988)</ref>\n\nThe leadership role of black churches in the movement was a natural extension of their structure and function. They offered members an opportunity to exercise roles denied them in society. Throughout history, the black church served as a place of worship and also as a base for powerful ministers, such as Congressman [[Adam Clayton Powell Jr.|Adam Clayton Powell]] in New York City.  The most prominent clergyman in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] was [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] ''Time'' magazine's 1963 \"[[Time Person of the Year|Man of the Year]]\" showed tireless personal commitment to black freedom and his strong leadership won him worldwide acclaim and the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].\n\nStudents and seminarians in both the South and the [[Northern United States|North]] played key roles in every phase of the movement. Church and student-led movements, such as the [[Nashville Student Movement]], developed their own organizational and sustaining structures. The [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), founded in 1957, coordinated and raised funds, mostly from northern sources, for local protests and for the training of black leaders. The [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], or SNCC, founded in 1957, developed the \"jail-no-bail\" strategy. SNCC's role was to develop and link sit-in campaigns and to help organize freedom rides, voter registration drives, and other protest activities. These three new groups often joined forces with existing organizations such as the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), founded in 1909, the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE), founded in 1942, and the [[National Urban League]]. The NAACP and its Director, [[Roy Wilkins]], provided legal counsel for jailed demonstrators, helped raise bail, and continued to test segregation and discrimination in the courts as it had been doing for half a century. CORE initiated the 1961 [[Freedom Rides]] which involved many SNCC members, and CORE's leader [[James L. Farmer, Jr.|James Farmer]] later became executive secretary of SNCC. \nThe administration of President [[John F. Kennedy]] supported enforcement of desegregation in schools and public facilities. Attorney General [[Robert Kennedy]] brought more than 50 lawsuits in four states to secure black Americans' right to vote. However, [[FBI]] director [[J. Edgar Hoover]], concerned about possible communist influence in the civil rights movement and personally antagonistic to King, used the FBI to discredit King and other civil rights leaders.<ref>James Giglio,  ''The Presidency of John F. Kennedy'' (1991),</ref>\n\n==Presidential administrations==\n\n===Truman: 1945\u20131953===\n{{Main article|Presidency of Harry S. Truman}}\nTruman, a self-educated farm boy from [[Missouri]], stood in sharp contrast to the urbane and imperious Roosevelt who kept personal control of all major decisions.<ref>Alonzo L. Hamby, ''Man of the People: A Life of Harry S. Truman'' (1995)</ref> Truman was a folksy, unassuming president who relied on his cabinet, remarking \"[[The buck stops here]]\" and \"If you can't stand the heat, you better get out of the kitchen.\"<ref>[[David McCullough]], ''[[Truman (book)|Truman]]'' (1992) p 717</ref>  Truman faced many challenges in domestic affairs. His poll ratings were sky high when he took office in April 1945 after Roosevelt's sudden death, then plunged to low levels for most of his eight years in office. The disorderly postwar reconversion of the economy of the United States was marked by severe shortages of housing, meat, appliance, automobiles and other rationed goods. The country was hit by long strikes in major industries in 1946, and Truman's unpopularity was such that the GOP regained Congress in a landslide during the midterms that year, and proceeded to pass the [[Taft\u2013Hartley Act]] over his veto. He used executive orders to end racial discrimination in the armed forces and created loyalty checks that dismissed thousands of communist fellow travelers from office. Truman's presidency was also eventful in [[Foreign relations of the United States|foreign affairs]], with the defeat of Nazi Germany and his decision to use [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear weapons against Japan]], the founding of the [[United Nations]], the [[Marshall Plan]] of 1948 to rebuild Europe, the [[Truman Doctrine]] of 1947 to contain communism, the beginning of the [[Cold War]], the [[Berlin Airlift]] of 1948, and in 1949 the creation of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military alliance]].\n\nTruman confounded all predictions to win election in [[1948 United States presidential election|1948]], helped by his famous [[Whistle stop train tour|Whistle Stop Tour]] which reinvigorated the [[New Deal Coalition]]. In addition, the short-lived GOP dominance of Congress was ended as the Democratic Party regained a comfortable majority in both houses, something they would surrender only once in the next 32 years. His victory validated his domestic liberalism, his foreign policy of containment, and the new federal commitment to civil rights.<ref>Andrew E. Busch, ''Truman's Triumphs: The 1948 Election and the Making of Postwar America'' (2012)</ref>\n\nThe defeat of America's wartime ally in the [[Chinese Civil War]] brought a hostile Communist regime to China under [[Mao Zedong]]. Soon the US became bogged down fighting China in the [[Korean War]], 1950-53. Corruption in Truman's administration, which was linked to cabinet-level appointees and senior White House staff, was a central issue in the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 presidential campaign]]. Truman's third term hopes were dashed by a poor showing in the 1952 primaries. Republican [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the famous wartime general, won a [[1952 United States presidential election|landslide in the 1952 presidential election]] by campaigning against Truman's failures in terms of \"Communism, Korea and Corruption.\"<ref>Richard S. Kirkendall, ''Harry S. Truman Encyclopedia'' (1990)</ref>\n\n===Eisenhower: 1953\u20131961===\n{{Main article|Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower}}\nEisenhower had been a prospective presidential candidate since the end of World War II, and although he publicly announced himself a Republican, he declined the party's offers to run in 1948. However, four years later, he reconsidered, in part because he believed the Democratic Party had had a monopoly on power for too long (control of the White House for 19 straight years and Congress for 16 of the last 19 years) and it was necessary to restore a proper two party balance. Also, the GOP in their desperation to regain power had begun supporting controversial figures such as Joseph McCarthy. As a national hero, Eisenhower carried every major demographic bloc and all states outside the South in the 1952 presidential election. He ended the Korean War, maintained the peace in Asia and the Middle East, and worked smoothly with NATO allies in Europe while keeping the [[Containment|policy of containing Communism]] rather than trying to [[rollback|roll it back]].<ref>Richard A. Melanson and David Mayers, eds., ''Reevaluating Eisenhower: American Foreign Policy in the Fifties'' (1988)</ref>\n\nWhile frugal in budget matters he expanded Social Security and did not try to repeal the remaining [[New Deal]] programs. He launched the interstate highway system (using a tax on gasoline) that dramatically improved the nation's transportation infrastructure.<ref>Dan McNichol, ''The Roads That Built America: The Incredible Story of the U.S. Interstate System'' (2005)</ref> The economy was generally healthy, apart from a sharp economic recession in 1958.<ref>Harold G. Vatter, ''The U. S. Economy in the 1950s: An Economic History'' (1984)</ref>  Eisenhower remained  popular and largely avoided partisan politics; he was reelected by a landslide in 1956.\n\nIn both foreign and domestic policy Eisenhower remained on friendly terms with the Democrats, who regained Congress in 1954 and made large gains in 1958.  His farewell address to the nation warned of the dangers of a growing \"[[military\u2013industrial complex]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=old&doc=90 |title=Our Documents - President Dwight D.

Historians have explained Kennedy's victory in terms of an economic recession, the numerical dominance of 17 million more registered Democrats than Republicans, the votes that Kennedy gained among Catholics practically matched the votes Nixon gained among Protestants,<ref>Shaun A. Casey, ''The Making of a Catholic President: Kennedy vs. Nixon, 1960'' (2009)</ref> Kennedy's better organization, and Nixon's superior campaigning skills.  Nixon's emphasis on his experience carried little weight, and he wasted energy by campaigning in all 50 states instead of concentrating on the swing states. Kennedy used his large, well-funded campaign organization to win the nomination, secure endorsements, and with the aid of the last of the big-city bosses, to get out the vote in the big cities. He relied on Johnson to hold the South and used television effectively.<ref>Hal Brands, \"Burying Theodore White: Recent Accounts of the 1960 Presidential Election,\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 2010.

Voters were polarized on religious grounds, but Kennedy's election was a transforming event for Catholics, who finally realized they were accepted in America, and it marked the virtual end of anti-Catholicism as a political force.<ref>Lawrence H. Fuchs, ''John F. Kennedy and American Catholicism'' (1967)</ref>\n\n====Presidency====\n{{Main article|Presidency of John F. Kennedy}}\nThe Kennedy Family had long been leaders of the Irish Catholic wing of the Democratic Party; JFK was middle-of-the-road or liberal on domestic issues and conservative on foreign policy, sending military forces into Cuba and Vietnam. The Kennedy style called for youth, dynamism, vigor and an intellectual approach to aggressive new policies in foreign affairs. The downside was his inexperience in foreign affairs, standing in stark contrast to the vast experience of the president he replaced.  He is best known for his call to [[Republicanism in the United States|civic virtue]]: \"And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country.\"  In Congress the [[Conservative Coalition]] blocked nearly all of Kennedy's domestic programs, so there were few changes in domestic policy, even as the civil rights movement gained momentum.<ref>James Giglio, ''The Presidency of John F. Kennedy'' (1991)</ref>\n\n=====Assassination=====\n{{Main article|Assassination of John F. Kennedy}}\n[[John F. Kennedy assassination|President Kennedy was assassinated]] in [[Dallas]], Texas, on November 22, 1963 by [[Lee Harvey Oswald]].  The event proved to be one of the greatest psychological shocks to the American people in the 20th century and led to Kennedy being revered as a martyr and hero.\n\n===Johnson, 1963\u20131969===\n{{Main article|Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson}}\nAfter Kennedy's assassination, vice president Lyndon Baines Johnson served out the remainder of the term, using appeals to finish the job that Kennedy had started to pass a remarkable package of liberal legislation that he called the [[Great Society]]. Johnson used the full powers of the presidency to ensure passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. These actions helped Johnson to win a historic landslide in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]] over conservative champion Senator [[Barry Goldwater]]. Johnson's big victory brought an overwhelming liberal majority in Congress.<ref>Randall Woods, ''LBJ: Architect of American Ambition'' (2006).</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of the United States (1964\u20131980)]]\n* [[Post\u2013World War II boom]]\n* [[United States in the 1950s]]\n* [[Timeline of United States history (1930\u20131949)]]\n* [[Timeline of United States history (1950\u20131969)]]\n* [[Presidency of Franklin D.

White. However, a predecessor institution called Great Burstead Board School opened on 13 February  1878. This school was situated just across from Laindon Road and P.G. White who was Billericay School's first headmaster was appointed head of the senior mixed department here in 1923. The Billericay School was built as by the 1930s the school was struggling to cope with a growing enrollment and plans were drawn up for a new school big enough to cater for Billericay\u2019s growing population.\n\nCosting \u00a322,400 Billericay School opened its doors in 1937 a year before its 'official' opening as a [[grammar school]]. Air raid shelters were built almost immediately  to protect students from Luftwaffe planes travelling to London on bombing raids during World War II. The school was built upon the site of an Iron Age foundry where prior to the building of the school a cornfield and a farm was located.\n\nP.G. White served a headmaster until 1949 when he died suddenly on holiday shortly before he was due to retire. Arthur Lingard became headmaster in 1949 and oversaw the school's transformation to a comprehensive on 1 September 1968 and the building of the school\u2019s sixth form centre which occurred in the 1960s. During the 1970s exchanges began with international schools including an annual trip to the Einstein Gymnasium in [[Reutlingen]] in Germany - an exchange programme that continues to this day.  The Parents\u2019 Guild (later Friends of Billericay School) was also formed in this decade. Robert Goodier became headmaster in 1991 and oversaw the move away from LEA governance to self-governance.\n\nThe school's Music Studio was finished in 1991 and the decade saw a period of success for the Music Department under the headship of Mr John Stevenson (blatant nonce) including appearances at the London TV Arts Festival and on the BBC's Blue Peter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvWxoBF-FHkUQ06lWN0ImLg?feature=watch |title=John Stevenson |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=17 May 2014}}</ref> In 1997 the school was awarded its third Schools Curriculum Award by Princess Anne. Sue Hammond became the first female head of the school in Easter 1998 and in 1999 the [[Resource-based learning|Resource Based Learning Centre]] (RBLC) was opened. In March 2002 the school was the subject of a channel 5 documentary concerning a school reunion for pupils who attended the school between 1980 and 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y-vAFei0og |title=Billericay School Reunion - March 2002 |publisher=YouTube |date=26 August 2012 |accessdate=17 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Billericayschool.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A-block can be seen in the background of the front cover of Sylvia Kent's book on The Billericay School.]]\n\nThe School achieved [[Mathematics and Computing College|Maths and Computing College]] status in 2003 allowing some use of selection based on aptitude in these subjects. It was thought that this status would generate an additional \u00a31 million worth of funding, but a [[government]] policy on foundation schools reduced this sum significantly. The school has since converted to academy status, but continues to have Maths and Computing as a specialism.\n\nThe 2000s saw long-running attempts to sell disused land adjacent to the school in order to fund a series of improvements\nDevelopment was initially refused<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basildonrecorder.co.uk/search/2072077.Billericay_School_plan_set_for_refusal/ |title=Billericay School plan set for refusal (From Basildon Recorder) |publisher=Basildonrecorder.co.uk |date=26 February 2008 |accessdate=15 June 2009}}</ref> but was appealed.<ref name=\"billericay3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/local_news/billericay/3982265.Planning_inquiry_told_green_belt_land_sale_vital_for_Billericay_School/ |title=Planning inquiry told green belt land sale vital for Billericay School (From Echo) |publisher=Echo-news.co.uk |date=17 December 2008 |accessdate=15 June 2009}}</ref> In 2009 approval was gained to develop 51 new homes upon a six-acre plot.<ref name=\"billericay3\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/local_news/billericay/4079551.Green_belt_homes_fury/ |title=Green belt homes fury (From Echo) |publisher=Echo-news.co.uk |date=28 January 2009 |accessdate=12 June 2009}}</ref><ref>http://www.investmentland.com/news.php</ref>\n\nChanges were made in the 2005/06 academic year which cut the lunch break from 1 hour to 45 mins so that the school day finished at 3.00pm rather than 3.15pm.

A B Block used to exist on the greenery, next to the car park, where the footpath now leads from the main gate to 'F' Block. B block was a two-storey wooden structure housing metal and woodworking classrooms on the ground floor and art, pottery, home economics and  technical drawing classrooms, on the first floor. It was demolished on the last day of term 1989.\n\nA Block contains mostly Maths classes and R.E classes along with humanities and Geography. This was the original building from when the school was first opened.\n\nC block is the biggest block at the school. It contains mainly Science classrooms. The main wing of the block is a 3 stories high with roughly 1 and a half of these rooms as Science labs. This block also contains the RBLC, more commonly known as the library, which houses over 30,000 books.<ref name=\"billericay1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.billericay.essex.sch.uk/bl/about_us |title=About Us / The Billericay School - A Specialist Maths & Computer School |publisher=Billericay.essex.sch.uk |date= |accessdate=13 June 2009 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718234923/http://www.billericay.essex.sch.uk/bl/about_us |archivedate=18 July 2012  }}</ref>  It also contains (on the top floor) R.E, Media and English rooms and on the ground floor there are Drama Studios, Music rooms, Student Services and the important sick bay.\n\nD Block is the new languages block which was completed in the spring of 2013, constructed from the demountables previously used in V block. The previous D block stood on the same site, constructed from a set of demountables demolished prior to construction of the new block.\n\nE Block is a raising of the school-leaving age (Rosla) building built to house the additional students capacity needed when the school leaving age was raised to a compulsory 16.  This block contains the Art classrooms and the Food Technology and Textiles rooms and also houses Child Development.\n\nF block opened for the first time in September 1988. The original F Block contained the, then CDT Department (downstairs) and the Business Studies Department (upstairs). Later, there was a major rebuild to the front of F Block, enlarging it to take the ever-expanding school administrations. At the same time the Head Teacher's office was moved from C block (now the Withdrawal unit) to a new room in the new F Block. As ICT (IT then) expanded, the Business Studies rooms, F7 and F10 became computer rooms.  Recently F12 has been converted to house a number of PCs as has F1 with the addition of 30 PCs to augment the DT graphics lessons.\n\nIn 2004, a V block was created. It is thought that this refers to the concept of the block being a 'village' community. The V block was built to house the English department, whilst we awaited the new build block. There was a small fire in one of the old D block demountables, but the fire itself did not contribute to the installation of V block. However, 2 of the 5 buildings still remain which were not touched by the fire. V block housed the school's English department. But is now used as a cafeteria.\n\n==Sixth-form==\n[[Sixth-form]] students (years 12 and 13) have their own study areas and common room, but shares classrooms with the rest of the school.\n\n==Houses==\nSchool records show that a house system has been adopted at three periods during the school's history. During the 1930s the house names were Effingham (Red),\nRaleigh (Blue), Grenville (Green) and Drake (Yellow). From 1961 to 1968 the houses where Stock, Blunt, Norsey and Chantry.

White. However, a predecessor institution called Great Burstead Board School opened on 13 February  1878. This school was situated just across from Laindon Road and P.G. White who was Billericay School's first headmaster was appointed head of the senior mixed department here in 1923. The Billericay School was built as by the 1930s the school was struggling to cope with a growing enrollment and plans were drawn up for a new school big enough to cater for Billericay\u2019s growing population.\n\nCosting \u00a322,400 Billericay School opened its doors in 1937 a year before its 'official' opening as a [[grammar school]]. Air raid shelters were built almost immediately  to protect students from Luftwaffe planes travelling to London on bombing raids during World War II. The school was built upon the site of an Iron Age foundry where prior to the building of the school a cornfield and a farm was located.\n\nP.G. White served a headmaster until 1949 when he died suddenly on holiday shortly before he was due to retire. Arthur Lingard became headmaster in 1949 and oversaw the school's transformation to a comprehensive on 1 September 1968 and the building of the school\u2019s sixth form centre which occurred in the 1960s. During the 1970s exchanges began with international schools including an annual trip to the Einstein Gymnasium in [[Reutlingen]] in Germany - an exchange programme that continues to this day.  The Parents\u2019 Guild (later Friends of Billericay School) was also formed in this decade. Robert Goodier became headmaster in 1991 and oversaw the move away from LEA governance to self-governance.\n\nThe school's Music Studio was finished in 1991 and the decade saw a period of success for the Music Department under the headship of Mr John Stevenson including appearances at the London TV Arts Festival and on the BBC's Blue Peter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvWxoBF-FHkUQ06lWN0ImLg?feature=watch |title=John Stevenson |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=17 May 2014}}</ref> In 1997 the school was awarded its third Schools Curriculum Award by Princess Anne. Sue Hammond became the first female head of the school in Easter 1998 and in 1999 the [[Resource-based learning|Resource Based Learning Centre]] (RBLC) was opened. In March 2002 the school was the subject of a channel 5 documentary concerning a school reunion for pupils who attended the school between 1980 and 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y-vAFei0og |title=Billericay School Reunion - March 2002 |publisher=YouTube |date=26 August 2012 |accessdate=17 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Billericayschool.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A-block can be seen in the background of the front cover of Sylvia Kent's book on The Billericay School.]]\n\nThe School achieved [[Mathematics and Computing College|Maths and Computing College]] status in 2003 allowing some use of selection based on aptitude in these subjects. It was thought that this status would generate an additional \u00a31 million worth of funding, but a [[government]] policy on foundation schools reduced this sum significantly. The school has since converted to academy status, but continues to have Maths and Computing as a specialism.\n\nThe 2000s saw long-running attempts to sell disused land adjacent to the school in order to fund a series of improvements\nDevelopment was initially refused<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basildonrecorder.co.uk/search/2072077.Billericay_School_plan_set_for_refusal/ |title=Billericay School plan set for refusal (From Basildon Recorder) |publisher=Basildonrecorder.co.uk |date=26 February 2008 |accessdate=15 June 2009}}</ref> but was appealed.<ref name=\"billericay3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/local_news/billericay/3982265.Planning_inquiry_told_green_belt_land_sale_vital_for_Billericay_School/ |title=Planning inquiry told green belt land sale vital for Billericay School (From Echo) |publisher=Echo-news.co.uk |date=17 December 2008 |accessdate=15 June 2009}}</ref> In 2009 approval was gained to develop 51 new homes upon a six-acre plot.<ref name=\"billericay3\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/local_news/billericay/4079551.Green_belt_homes_fury/ |title=Green belt homes fury (From Echo) |publisher=Echo-news.co.uk |date=28 January 2009 |accessdate=12 June 2009}}</ref><ref>http://www.investmentland.com/news.php</ref>\n\nChanges were made in the 2005/06 academic year which cut the lunch break from 1 hour to 45 mins so that the school day finished at 3.00pm rather than 3.15pm.

This block contains the Art classrooms and the Food Technology and Textiles rooms and also houses Child Development.\n\nF block opened for the first time in September 1988. The original F Block contained the, then CDT Department (downstairs) and the Business Studies Department (upstairs). Later, there was a major rebuild to the front of F Block, enlarging it to take the ever-expanding school administrations. At the same time the Head Teacher's office was moved from C block (now the Withdrawal unit) to a new room in the new F Block. As ICT (IT then) expanded, the Business Studies rooms, F7 and F10 became computer rooms.  Recently F12 has been converted to house a number of PCs as has F1 with the addition of 30 PCs to augment the DT graphics lessons.\n\nIn 2004, a V block was created. It is thought that this refers to the concept of the block being a 'village' community. The V block was built to house the English department, whilst we awaited the new build block. There was a small fire in one of the old D block demountables, but the fire itself did not contribute to the installation of V block. However, 2 of the 5 buildings still remain which were not touched by the fire. V block housed the school's English department. But is now used as a cafeteria.\n\n==Sixth-form==\n[[Sixth-form]] students (years 12 and 13) have their own study areas and common room, but shares classrooms with the rest of the school.\n\n==Houses==\nSchool records show that a house system has been adopted at three periods during the school's history. During the 1930s the house names were Effingham (Red),\nRaleigh (Blue), Grenville (Green) and Drake (Yellow). From 1961 to 1968 the houses where Stock, Blunt, Norsey and Chantry. In 1969 a house system was introduced with the names of houses referencing historical figures \u2013 Fitzwalter, de Vere, Audley and Christopher Martin.
