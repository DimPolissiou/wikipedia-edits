In Old English, the day was called \u201cLong Friday\u201d (\"Langa friged\u00e6g\" {{IPA-ang|\u02c8l\u0251\u014b.\u0261\u0251 \u02c8fri\u02d0.je\u02ccd\u00e6j|}}), and this term was adopted from Old English and is still used in Scandinavian languages and Finnish.<ref>[http://runeberg.org/svetym/0522.html ]</ref>\n\n===Other languages===\nIn Latin, the name used by the Catholic Church until 1955 was ''Feria sexta in Parasceve'' (\"Friday of Preparation [for the Sabbath]\"). In the 1955 reform of Holy Week, it was renamed ''Feria sexta in Passione et Morte Domini'' (\"Friday of the Passion and Death of the Lord\"), and in the new rite introduced in 1970, shortened to ''Feria sexta in Passione Domini'' (\"Friday of the Passion of the Lord\").\n\nIn Dutch, Good Friday is known as ''Goede Vrijdag'', in Frisian as ''Goedfreed''. In German-speaking countries, it is generally referred to as ''Karfreitag'' (\"Mourning Friday\", with ''Kar'' from [[Old High German]] ''kara''\u201a \"bewail\", \"grieve\"\u201a \"mourn\", which is related to the English word \"care\" in the sense of cares and woes), but it is sometimes also called ''Stiller Freitag'' (\"Silent Friday\") and ''Hoher Freitag'' (\"High Friday, Holy Friday\"). In the Scandinavian languages and Finnish (\"pitk\u00e4perjantai\"), it is called the equivalent of \"Long Friday\" as it was in Old English (\"Langa friged\u00e6g\").\n\nIn Greek, Polish, Hungarian, and Romanian it is generally referred to as the equivalent of \"Great Friday\" (''\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5\u03ae'', ''Wielki Pi\u0105tek'', ''Nagyp\u00e9ntek'', ''Vinerea Mare'').

Judas received money ([[30 pieces of silver]]) ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:14\u201316|KJV}}) for [[Bargain of Judas|betraying Jesus]] and told the guards that whomever [[Kiss of Judas|he kisses]] is the one they are to arrest. Following his arrest, Jesus was taken to the house of [[Annas]], the father-in-law of the [[Cohen Gadol|high priest]], [[Caiaphas]]. There he was interrogated with little result and sent bound to Caiaphas the high priest where the [[Sanhedrin]] had assembled ({{Bibleverse||John|18:1\u201324|KJV}}).\n\nConflicting testimony against Jesus was brought forth by many witnesses, to which Jesus answered nothing. Finally the high priest adjured Jesus to respond under solemn oath, saying \"I adjure you, by the Living God, to tell us, are you the Anointed One, the Son of God?\" Jesus testified ambiguously, \"You have said it, and in time you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty, coming on the clouds of Heaven.\" The high priest condemned Jesus for [[blasphemy]], and the [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Sanhedrin concurred with a sentence of death]] ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:57\u201366|KJV}}). Peter, waiting in the courtyard, also [[Denial of Peter|denied Jesus]] three times to bystanders while the interrogations were proceeding just as Jesus had predicted.\n\nIn the morning, the whole assembly brought Jesus to the Roman governor [[Pontius Pilate]] under charges of subverting the nation, opposing taxes to Caesar, and making himself a king ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:1\u20132|KJV}}). Pilate authorized the Jewish leaders to judge Jesus according to their own law and execute sentencing; however, the Jewish leaders replied that they were not allowed by the Romans to carry out a sentence of death ({{Bibleverse||John|18:31|KJV}}).\n\n[[Pilate's court|Pilate questioned]] Jesus and told the assembly that there was no basis for sentencing. Upon learning that Jesus was from Galilee, Pilate referred the case to the ruler of [[Galilee]], [[Herod Antipas|King Herod]], who was in [[Jerusalem]] for the [[Passover]] Feast. [[Jesus at Herod's court|Herod questioned]] Jesus but received no answer; Herod sent Jesus back to Pilate. Pilate told the assembly that neither he nor Herod found Jesus to be guilty; Pilate resolved to have Jesus whipped and released ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:3\u201316|KJV}}). Under the guidance of the chief priests, the crowd asked for [[Barabbas]], who had been imprisoned for committing murder during an insurrection. Pilate asked what they would have him do with Jesus, and they demanded, \"Crucify him\" ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:6\u201314|KJV}}). [[Pontius Pilate's wife|Pilate's wife]] had seen Jesus in a dream earlier that day, and she forewarned Pilate to \"have nothing to do with this righteous man\" ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:19|KJV}}). Pilate had Jesus [[Flagellation of Christ|flogged]] and then brought him out to the crowd to release him. The chief priests informed Pilate of a new charge, demanding Jesus be sentenced to death \"because he claimed to be God's son.\" This possibility filled Pilate with fear, and he brought Jesus back inside the palace and demanded to know from where he came ({{Bibleverse||John|19:1\u20139|KJV|}}).\n\n[[File:Ecce homo by Antonio Ciseri (1).jpg|thumb|left|[[Antonio Ciseri]]'s depiction of ''[[Ecce Homo]]'' with Jesus and [[Pontius Pilate]], 19th century]]\nComing before the crowd one last time, Pilate declared Jesus innocent and washed his own hands in water to show he had no part in this condemnation. Nevertheless, Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified in order to forestall a riot ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:24\u201326|KJV}}) and ultimately to keep his job. The sentence written was \"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.\" Jesus carried his cross to the site of execution (assisted by [[Simon of Cyrene]]), called the \"place of the Skull\", or \"[[Golgotha]]\" in Hebrew and in Latin \"Calvary\". There he was crucified along with two criminals ({{Bibleverse||John|19:17\u201322|KJV}}).\n\nJesus agonized on the cross for six hours. During his last three hours on the cross, from noon to 3&nbsp;pm, [[Crucifixion darkness|darkness fell over the whole land]].<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:45}}; {{Bibleverse||Mark|15:13}}; {{Bibleverse||Luke|23:44}}</ref> Jesus [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|spoke from the cross]], quoting the messianic [[Psalm 22]]: \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\"\n\nWith a loud cry, Jesus gave up his spirit. There was an earthquake, tombs broke open, and the curtain in the Temple was torn from top to bottom. The [[centurion]] on guard at the site of crucifixion declared, \"Truly this was God's Son!\" ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:45\u201354|KJV}})\n\n[[Joseph of Arimathea]], a member of the Sanhedrin and a secret follower of Jesus, who had not consented to his condemnation, went to Pilate to request the body of Jesus ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:50\u201352|KJV}}). Another secret follower of Jesus and member of the Sanhedrin named [[Nicodemus]] brought about a hundred-pound weight mixture of spices and helped wrap the body of Jesus ({{Bibleverse||John|19:39\u201340|KJV}}). Pilate asked confirmation from the centurion of whether Jesus was dead ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:44|KJV}}). A soldier pierced the side of Jesus with a lance causing blood and water to flow out ({{Bibleverse||John|19:34|KJV}}), and the centurion informed Pilate that Jesus was dead ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:45|KJV}}).\n\nJoseph of Arimathea took Jesus' body, wrapped it in a clean linen shroud, and placed it in his own new tomb that had been carved in the rock ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:59\u201360|KJV}}) in a garden near the site of the crucifixion. Nicodemus ({{Bibleverse||John|3:1|KJV}}) also brought 75 pounds of [[myrrh]] and [[aloes]], and placed them in the linen with the body, in keeping with Jewish burial customs ({{Bibleverse||John|19:39\u201340|KJV}}). They rolled a large rock over the entrance of the tomb ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:60|KJV}}). Then they returned home and rested, because [[Shabbat]] had begun at sunset ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:54\u201356|KJV}}). Matt. 28:1 \"After the Shabbat, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb\". i.e. \"After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week,...\". \"He is not here; he has risen, just as he said....\".

Also on Great Friday, the clergy no longer wear the purple or red that is customary throughout [[Great Lent]],<ref>There is a wide variety of uses regarding the [[liturgical colors]] worn during Great Lent and Holy Week in the Rite of Constantinople.</ref> but instead don [[black vestments]]. There is no \"stripping of the altar\" on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy and Great Thursday]] as in the West; instead, all of the [[antipendia|church hangings]] are changed to black, and will remain so until the Divine Liturgy on [[Great Saturday]].\n\nThe faithful revisit the events of the day through the public reading of specific [[Psalms]] and the [[Gospel]]s, and singing [[hymn]]s about Christ's death. Rich visual imagery and symbolism, as well as stirring hymnody, are remarkable elements of these observances. In the [[Orthodox theology|Orthodox understanding]], the events of [[Holy Week]] are not simply an annual commemoration of past events, but the faithful actually participates in the death and the [[resurrection of Jesus]].\n\n<blockquote>Each hour of this day is the new suffering and the new effort of the expiatory suffering of the Savior. And the echo of this suffering is already heard in every word of our worship service \u2013 unique and incomparable both in the power of tenderness and feeling and in the depth of the boundless compassion for the suffering of the Savior. The Holy Church opens before the eyes of believers a full picture of the redeeming suffering of the Lord beginning with the bloody sweat in the Garden of Gethsemane up to the crucifixion on Golgotha. Taking us back through the past centuries in thought, the Holy Church brings us to the foot of the cross of Christ erected on Golgotha and makes us present among the quivering spectators of all the torture of the Savior.<ref name=\"Bulg\">{{Cite book\n|last = Bulgakov\n|first = Sergei V.\n|year = 1900\n|title = Handbook for Church Servers|edition= 2nd\n|page = 543\n|chapter = Great Friday\n|place = Kharkov\n|publisher = Tr.

Scattered throughout this [[Matins]] service are twelve readings from all four of the Gospels which recount the events of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] from the [[Last Supper]] through the [[Crucifixion]] and [[Holy Sepulchre|burial]] of Jesus. Some churches have a candelabrum with twelve candles on it, and after each Gospel reading one of the candles is extinguished.\n[[File:Agias Triados frescos cross.jpg|thumb|upright|Good Friday cross from the [[Katholikon|Catholicon]] at Holy Trinity Monastery, [[Meteora]], Greece]]\n\nThe first of these twelve readings {{Bibleverse||John|13:31\u201318:1|KJV}} is the longest Gospel reading of the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical year]], and is a [[concatenation]] from all [[four Gospels]].

Much of the service takes place around the tomb of Christ in the center of the nave.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nA unique feature of the service is the chanting of the Lamentations or Praises (''[[Encomium|Enk\u014dmia]]''), which consist of verses chanted by the clergy interspersed between the verses of [[Psalm 119]] (which is, by far, the longest [[psalm]] in the Bible). The ''Enk\u014dmia'' are the best-loved hymns of Byzantine hymnography, both their poetry and their music being uniquely suited to each other and to the spirit of the day. They consist of 185 [[tercet]] [[antiphon]]s arranged in three parts (''st\u00e1seis'' or \"stops\"), which are interjected with the verses of Psalm 119, and nine short ''doxastik\u00e1'' (\"[[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloriae]]\") and ''Theot\u00f3kia'' (invocations to the Virgin Mary). The three ''st\u00e1seis'' are each set to its own music, and are commonly known by their initial antiphons: {{lang|grc|\u1f29 \u03b6\u03c9\u1f74 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03ac\u03c6\u1ff3}}, \"Life in a grave\", {{lang|grc|\u1f0c\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af}}, \"Worthy it is\", and {{lang|grc|\u0391\u1f31 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9}}, \"All the generations\".  Musically they can be classified as [[strophic]], with 75, 62, and 48 tercet [[stanza]]s each, respectively. The climax of the ''Enk\u014dmia'' comes during the third ''st\u00e1sis'', with the antiphon \"''\u014c glyk\u00fd mou \u00c9ar''\", a lamentation of the Virgin for her dead Child (\"O, my sweet spring, my sweetest child, where has your beauty gone?\"). The author(s) and date of the ''Enk\u014dmia'' are unknown. Their High Attic linguistic style suggests a dating around the 6th century, possibly before the time of [[St. Romanos the Melodist]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Epitaph Adelaide.jpg|thumb|The Epitaphios mounted upon return of procession, at an Orthodox Church in Adelaide, Australia.]]\nAt the end of the [[Great Doxology]], while the [[Trisagion]] is sung, the epitaphios is taken in [[crucession|procession]] around the outside the church, and is then returned to the tomb.

During that time, Lutheranism had no restrictions on the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] on Good Friday; on the contrary, it was a prime day on which to receive the Eucharist, and services were often accentuated by special music such as the ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref name=\"GassmannOldenburg2011\"/>\n\nMore recently, Lutheran liturgical practice has recaptured Good Friday as part of the larger sweep of the great Three Days: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Vigil of Easter. The Three Days remain one liturgy which celebrates the death and resurrection of Jesus. As part of the liturgy of the Three Days, Lutherans generally fast from the Eucharist on Good Friday. Rather, it is celebrated in remembrance of the [[Last Supper]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] and at the [[Vigil of Easter]]. One practice among Lutheran churches is to celebrate a [[tenebrae]] service on Good Friday, typically conducted in candlelight and consisting of a collection of passion accounts from the four gospels. While being called \"Tenebrae\" it holds little resemblance to the now-suppressed Catholic monastic rite of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historiclectionary.com/2010/03/a-word-about-tenebrae |title=A Word About Tenebrae &#124; |publisher=Historiclectionary.com |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> The Good Friday liturgy appointed in ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'', the worship book of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, specifies a liturgy similar to the revised Roman Catholic liturgy. A rite for adoration of the crucified Christ includes the optional singing of the Solemn Reproaches in an updated and revised translation which eliminates some of the anti-Jewish overtones in previous versions. Many Lutheran churches have Good Friday services, such as the [[Three Hours' Agony]] centered on the remembrance of the \"Seven Last Words,\" sayings of Jesus assembled from the four gospels, while others hold a liturgy that places an emphasis on the triumph of the cross, and a singular biblical account of the Passion narrative from the Gospel of John.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nAlong with observing a general Lenten fast,<ref name=\"GassmannOldenburg2011\">{{cite book|last1=Gassmann|first1=G\u00fcnther|last2=Oldenburg|first2=Mark W.|title=Historical Dictionary of Lutheranism|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English|isbn=978-0810874824|page=229|quote=In many Lutheran churches, the Sundays during the Lenten season are called by the first word of their respective Latin Introitus (with the exception of Palm/Passion Sunday): Invocavit, Reminiscere, Oculi, Laetare, and Judica.

Easter falls on the first Sunday following the Paschal Full Moon, the full moon on or after 21 March, taken to be the date of the vernal [[equinox]]. The Western calculation uses the [[Gregorian calendar]], while the Eastern calculation uses the [[Julian calendar]], whose 21 March now corresponds to the Gregorian calendar's 3 April. The calculations for identifying the date of the full moon also differ. See [[Computus]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn Eastern Christianity, Easter can fall between 22 March and 25 April on Julian Calendar (thus between 4 April and 8 May in terms of the Gregorian calendar, during the period 1900 and 2099), so Good Friday can fall between 20 March and 23 April, inclusive (or between 2 April and 6 May in terms of the Gregorian calendar).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n{{Lent_calendar.svg|none{{!}}400px\n}}\n\n==Cultural references==\nGood Friday assumes a particular importance in the plot of [[Richard Wagner]]'s music drama ''[[Parsifal]]'', which contains an orchestral interlude known as the \"Good Friday Music\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/good-friday-music|title=Good Friday Music \u2013 Dictionary definition of Good Friday Music |publisher=Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism from non-observers==\nSome [[Baptist]] congregations,<ref>{{cite web|first=L.

In Old English, the day was called \u201cLong Friday\u201d (\"Langa friged\u00e6g\" {{IPA-ang|\u02c8l\u0251\u014b.\u0261\u0251 \u02c8fri\u02d0.je\u02ccd\u00e6j|}}), and this term was adopted from Old English and is still used in Scandinavian languages and Finnish.<ref>[http://runeberg.org/svetym/0522.html ]</ref>\n\n===Other languages===\nIn Latin, the name used by the Catholic Church until 1955 was ''Feria sexta in Parasceve'' (\"Friday of Preparation [for the Sabbath]\"). In the 1955 reform of Holy Week, it was renamed ''Feria sexta in Passione et Morte Domini'' (\"Friday of the Passion and Death of the Lord\"), and in the new rite introduced in 1970, shortened to ''Feria sexta in Passione Domini'' (\"Friday of the Passion of the Lord\").\n\nIn Dutch, Good Friday is known as ''Goede Vrijdag'', in Frisian as ''Goedfreed''. In German-speaking countries, it is generally referred to as ''Karfreitag'' (\"Mourning Friday\", with ''Kar'' from [[Old High German]] ''kara''\u201a \"bewail\", \"grieve\"\u201a \"mourn\", which is related to the English word \"care\" in the sense of cares and woes), but it is sometimes also called ''Stiller Freitag'' (\"Silent Friday\") and ''Hoher Freitag'' (\"High Friday, Holy Friday\"). In the Scandinavian languages and Finnish (\"pitk\u00e4perjantai\"), it is called the equivalent of \"Long Friday\" as it was in Old English (\"Langa friged\u00e6g\").\n\nIn Greek, Polish, Hungarian, and Romanian it is generally referred to as the equivalent of \"Great Friday\" (''\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5\u03ae'', ''Wielki Pi\u0105tek'', ''Nagyp\u00e9ntek'', ''Vinerea Mare'').

Judas received money ([[30 pieces of silver]]) ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:14\u201316|KJV}}) for [[Bargain of Judas|betraying Jesus]] and told the guards that whomever [[Kiss of Judas|he kisses]] is the one they are to arrest. Following his arrest, Jesus was taken to the house of [[Annas]], the father-in-law of the [[Cohen Gadol|high priest]], [[Caiaphas]]. There he was interrogated with little result and sent bound to Caiaphas the high priest where the [[Sanhedrin]] had assembled ({{Bibleverse||John|18:1\u201324|KJV}}).\n\nConflicting testimony against Jesus was brought forth by many witnesses, to which Jesus answered nothing. Finally the high priest adjured Jesus to respond under solemn oath, saying \"I adjure you, by the Living God, to tell us, are you the Anointed One, the Son of God?\" Jesus testified ambiguously, \"You have said it, and in time you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty, coming on the clouds of Heaven.\" The high priest condemned Jesus for [[blasphemy]], and the [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Sanhedrin concurred with a sentence of death]] ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:57\u201366|KJV}}). Peter, waiting in the courtyard, also [[Denial of Peter|denied Jesus]] three times to bystanders while the interrogations were proceeding just as Jesus had predicted.\n\nIn the morning, the whole assembly brought Jesus to the Roman governor [[Pontius Pilate]] under charges of subverting the nation, opposing taxes to Caesar, and making himself a king ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:1\u20132|KJV}}). Pilate authorized the Jewish leaders to judge Jesus according to their own law and execute sentencing; however, the Jewish leaders replied that they were not allowed by the Romans to carry out a sentence of death ({{Bibleverse||John|18:31|KJV}}).\n\n[[Pilate's court|Pilate questioned]] Jesus and told the assembly that there was no basis for sentencing. Upon learning that Jesus was from Galilee, Pilate referred the case to the ruler of [[Galilee]], [[Herod Antipas|King Herod]], who was in [[Jerusalem]] for the [[Passover]] Feast. [[Jesus at Herod's court|Herod questioned]] Jesus but received no answer; Herod sent Jesus back to Pilate. Pilate told the assembly that neither he nor Herod found Jesus to be guilty; Pilate resolved to have Jesus whipped and released ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:3\u201316|KJV}}). Under the guidance of the chief priests, the crowd asked for [[Barabbas]], who had been imprisoned for committing murder during an insurrection. Pilate asked what they would have him do with Jesus, and they demanded, \"Crucify him\" ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:6\u201314|KJV}}). [[Pontius Pilate's wife|Pilate's wife]] had seen Jesus in a dream earlier that day, and she forewarned Pilate to \"have nothing to do with this righteous man\" ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:19|KJV}}). Pilate had Jesus [[Flagellation of Christ|flogged]] and then brought him out to the crowd to release him. The chief priests informed Pilate of a new charge, demanding Jesus be sentenced to death \"because he claimed to be God's son.\" This possibility filled Pilate with fear, and he brought Jesus back inside the palace and demanded to know from where he came ({{Bibleverse||John|19:1\u20139|KJV|}}).\n\n[[File:Ecce homo by Antonio Ciseri (1).jpg|thumb|left|[[Antonio Ciseri]]'s depiction of ''[[Ecce Homo]]'' with Jesus and [[Pontius Pilate]], 19th century]]\nComing before the crowd one last time, Pilate declared Jesus innocent and washed his own hands in water to show he had no part in this condemnation. Nevertheless, Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified in order to forestall a riot ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:24\u201326|KJV}}) and ultimately to keep his job. The sentence written was \"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.\" Jesus carried his cross to the site of execution (assisted by [[Simon of Cyrene]]), called the \"place of the Skull\", or \"[[Golgotha]]\" in Hebrew and in Latin \"Calvary\". There he was crucified along with two criminals ({{Bibleverse||John|19:17\u201322|KJV}}).\n\nJesus agonized on the cross for six hours.

There was an earthquake, tombs broke open, and the curtain in the Temple was torn from top to bottom. The [[centurion]] on guard at the site of crucifixion declared, \"Truly this was God's Son!\" ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:45\u201354|KJV}})\n\n[[Joseph of Arimathea]], a member of the Sanhedrin and a secret follower of Jesus, who had not consented to his condemnation, went to Pilate to request the body of Jesus ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:50\u201352|KJV}}). Another secret follower of Jesus and member of the Sanhedrin named [[Nicodemus]] brought about a hundred-pound weight mixture of spices and helped wrap the body of Jesus ({{Bibleverse||John|19:39\u201340|KJV}}). Pilate asked confirmation from the centurion of whether Jesus was dead ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:44|KJV}}). A soldier pierced the side of Jesus with a lance causing blood and water to flow out ({{Bibleverse||John|19:34|KJV}}), and the centurion informed Pilate that Jesus was dead ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:45|KJV}}).\n\nJoseph of Arimathea took Jesus' body, wrapped it in a clean linen shroud, and placed it in his own new tomb that had been carved in the rock ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:59\u201360|KJV}}) in a garden near the site of the crucifixion. Nicodemus ({{Bibleverse||John|3:1|KJV}}) also brought 75 pounds of [[myrrh]] and [[aloes]], and placed them in the linen with the body, in keeping with Jewish burial customs ({{Bibleverse||John|19:39\u201340|KJV}}). They rolled a large rock over the entrance of the tomb ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:60|KJV}}). Then they returned home and rested, because [[Shabbat]] had begun at sunset ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:54\u201356|KJV}}).

Also on Great Friday, the clergy no longer wear the purple or red that is customary throughout [[Great Lent]],<ref>There is a wide variety of uses regarding the [[liturgical colors]] worn during Great Lent and Holy Week in the Rite of Constantinople.</ref> but instead don [[black vestments]]. There is no \"stripping of the altar\" on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy and Great Thursday]] as in the West; instead, all of the [[antipendia|church hangings]] are changed to black, and will remain so until the Divine Liturgy on [[Great Saturday]].\n\nThe faithful revisit the events of the day through the public reading of specific [[Psalms]] and the [[Gospel]]s, and singing [[hymn]]s about Christ's death. Rich visual imagery and symbolism, as well as stirring hymnody, are remarkable elements of these observances. In the [[Orthodox theology|Orthodox understanding]], the events of [[Holy Week]] are not simply an annual commemoration of past events, but the faithful actually participates in the death and the [[resurrection of Jesus]].\n\n<blockquote>Each hour of this day is the new suffering and the new effort of the expiatory suffering of the Savior. And the echo of this suffering is already heard in every word of our worship service \u2013 unique and incomparable both in the power of tenderness and feeling and in the depth of the boundless compassion for the suffering of the Savior. The Holy Church opens before the eyes of believers a full picture of the redeeming suffering of the Lord beginning with the bloody sweat in the Garden of Gethsemane up to the crucifixion on Golgotha. Taking us back through the past centuries in thought, the Holy Church brings us to the foot of the cross of Christ erected on Golgotha and makes us present among the quivering spectators of all the torture of the Savior.<ref name=\"Bulg\">{{Cite book\n|last = Bulgakov\n|first = Sergei V.\n|year = 1900\n|title = Handbook for Church Servers|edition= 2nd\n|page = 543\n|chapter = Great Friday\n|place = Kharkov\n|publisher = Tr.

Scattered throughout this [[Matins]] service are twelve readings from all four of the Gospels which recount the events of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] from the [[Last Supper]] through the [[Crucifixion]] and [[Holy Sepulchre|burial]] of Jesus. Some churches have a candelabrum with twelve candles on it, and after each Gospel reading one of the candles is extinguished.\n[[File:Agias Triados frescos cross.jpg|thumb|upright|Good Friday cross from the [[Katholikon|Catholicon]] at Holy Trinity Monastery, [[Meteora]], Greece]]\n\nThe first of these twelve readings {{Bibleverse||John|13:31\u201318:1|KJV}} is the longest Gospel reading of the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical year]], and is a [[concatenation]] from all [[four Gospels]].

This service is also sometimes called ''Jerusalem Matins''. Much of the service takes place around the tomb of Christ in the center of the nave.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nA unique feature of the service is the chanting of the Lamentations or Praises (''[[Encomium|Enk\u014dmia]]''), which consist of verses chanted by the clergy interspersed between the verses of [[Psalm 119]] (which is, by far, the longest [[psalm]] in the Bible). The ''Enk\u014dmia'' are the best-loved hymns of Byzantine hymnography, both their poetry and their music being uniquely suited to each other and to the spirit of the day. They consist of 185 [[tercet]] [[antiphon]]s arranged in three parts (''st\u00e1seis'' or \"stops\"), which are interjected with the verses of Psalm 119, and nine short ''doxastik\u00e1'' (\"[[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloriae]]\") and ''Theot\u00f3kia'' (invocations to the Virgin Mary). The three ''st\u00e1seis'' are each set to its own music, and are commonly known by their initial antiphons: {{lang|grc|\u1f29 \u03b6\u03c9\u1f74 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03ac\u03c6\u1ff3}}, \"Life in a grave\", {{lang|grc|\u1f0c\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af}}, \"Worthy it is\", and {{lang|grc|\u0391\u1f31 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9}}, \"All the generations\".  Musically they can be classified as [[strophic]], with 75, 62, and 48 tercet [[stanza]]s each, respectively. The climax of the ''Enk\u014dmia'' comes during the third ''st\u00e1sis'', with the antiphon \"''\u014c glyk\u00fd mou \u00c9ar''\", a lamentation of the Virgin for her dead Child (\"O, my sweet spring, my sweetest child, where has your beauty gone?\"). The author(s) and date of the ''Enk\u014dmia'' are unknown.

Some churches observe the practice of holding the epitaphios at the door, above waist level, so the faithful most bow down under it as they come back into the church, symbolizing their entering into the death and resurrection of Christ. The epitaphios will lay in the tomb until the Paschal Service early Sunday morning.

These Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ do not involve a petition for a beneficiary, but aim to \"repair the sins\" against Jesus. Some such prayers are provided in the [[Raccolta]] Catholic prayer book (approved by a Decree of 1854, and published by the [[Holy See]] in 1898) which also includes prayers as [[Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12775a.htm|title=Reparation|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia |accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12620a.htm|title=Raccolta|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia |accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref><ref>Joseph P.

During that time, Lutheranism had no restrictions on the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] on Good Friday; on the contrary, it was a prime day on which to receive the Eucharist, and services were often accentuated by special music such as the ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref name=\"GassmannOldenburg2011\"/>\n\nMore recently, Lutheran liturgical practice has recaptured Good Friday as part of the larger sweep of the great Three Days: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Vigil of Easter. The Three Days remain one liturgy which celebrates the death and resurrection of Jesus. As part of the liturgy of the Three Days, Lutherans generally fast from the Eucharist on Good Friday. Rather, it is celebrated in remembrance of the [[Last Supper]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] and at the [[Vigil of Easter]]. One practice among Lutheran churches is to celebrate a [[tenebrae]] service on Good Friday, typically conducted in candlelight and consisting of a collection of passion accounts from the four gospels. While being called \"Tenebrae\" it holds little resemblance to the now-suppressed Catholic monastic rite of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historiclectionary.com/2010/03/a-word-about-tenebrae |title=A Word About Tenebrae &#124; |publisher=Historiclectionary.com |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> The Good Friday liturgy appointed in ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'', the worship book of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, specifies a liturgy similar to the revised Roman Catholic liturgy. A rite for adoration of the crucified Christ includes the optional singing of the Solemn Reproaches in an updated and revised translation which eliminates some of the anti-Jewish overtones in previous versions. Many Lutheran churches have Good Friday services, such as the [[Three Hours' Agony]] centered on the remembrance of the \"Seven Last Words,\" sayings of Jesus assembled from the four gospels, while others hold a liturgy that places an emphasis on the triumph of the cross, and a singular biblical account of the Passion narrative from the Gospel of John.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nAlong with observing a general Lenten fast,<ref name=\"GassmannOldenburg2011\">{{cite book|last1=Gassmann|first1=G\u00fcnther|last2=Oldenburg|first2=Mark W.|title=Historical Dictionary of Lutheranism|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English|isbn=978-0810874824|page=229|quote=In many Lutheran churches, the Sundays during the Lenten season are called by the first word of their respective Latin Introitus (with the exception of Palm/Passion Sunday): Invocavit, Reminiscere, Oculi, Laetare, and Judica.

Easter falls on the first Sunday following the Paschal Full Moon, the full moon on or after 21 March, taken to be the date of the vernal [[equinox]]. The Western calculation uses the [[Gregorian calendar]], while the Eastern calculation uses the [[Julian calendar]], whose 21 March now corresponds to the Gregorian calendar's 3 April. The calculations for identifying the date of the full moon also differ. See [[Computus]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn Eastern Christianity, Easter can fall between 22 March and 25 April on Julian Calendar (thus between 4 April and 8 May in terms of the Gregorian calendar, during the period 1900 and 2099), so Good Friday can fall between 20 March and 23 April, inclusive (or between 2 April and 6 May in terms of the Gregorian calendar).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n{{Lent_calendar.svg|none{{!}}400px\n}}\n\n==Cultural references==\nGood Friday assumes a particular importance in the plot of [[Richard Wagner]]'s music drama ''[[Parsifal]]'', which contains an orchestral interlude known as the \"Good Friday Music\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/good-friday-music|title=Good Friday Music \u2013 Dictionary definition of Good Friday Music |publisher=Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism from non-observers==\nSome [[Baptist]] congregations,<ref>{{cite web|first=L.

This was abandoned after the outbreak of the [[Falklands War]],<ref name=\"Background\" /> and the club returned to blue and white striped tops with blue shorts in the 1980s.

It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. County's kit was supplied by local manufacturer [[Umbro]] who supplied all three of County's kit for the 2013\u201314 season, replacing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], thus making County the only senior club in

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

This was abandoned after the outbreak of the [[Falklands War]],<ref name=\"Background\" /> and the club returned to blue and white striped tops with blue shorts in the 1980s.

It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. County's kit was supplied by local manufacturer [[Umbro]] who supplied all three of County's kit for the 2013\u201314 season, replacing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], thus making County the only senior club in

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

It was founded on 19 April 1973 in the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Bad M\u00fcnstereifel]], by militants from the Portuguese Socialist Action ({{lang-pt|Ac\u00e7\u00e3o Socialista Portuguesa}}). The PS is one of the two [[Major party|major parties]] in Portuguese politics, its rival being the centre-right [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD). The current leader of the PS is [[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], the [[Prime Minister of Portugal]]. The party has currently 108 of 230 seats in the Portuguese Parliament following the [[2019 Portuguese legislative election|October 2019 election]], forming a minority government.\n\nPS is a member of the [[Socialist International]], [[Progressive Alliance]] and [[Party of European Socialists]], and has nine members in the [[European Parliament]] within the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|Socialists & Democrats]] (S&D) Group during the [[9th European Parliament|ninth parliament]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ant\u00f3nio Costa img 6536.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]] since November 2015 and Secretary-General since 2014.]]\n{{Social democracy sidebar}}\nThe Socialist Party (PS) was created at a conference of Portuguese Socialist Action (ASP), at that time in exile, on 19 April 1973, in [[Bad M\u00fcnstereifel]] in [[West Germany]]. The twenty-seven delegates decided to found a party of [[socialism]] and [[Political freedom|freedom]], making an explicit reference to a [[classless society]] and without [[Marxism]], redesigned as a source of principal inspiration.\n\nOn 25 April 1974, the [[Carnation Revolution]] brought down the authoritarian regime of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]], established in 1933, and democracy was restored. The general secretary of the PS, M\u00e1rio Soares, returned to Portugal after being in exile in France, and became [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Portugal)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Almeida Santos]] was appointed Minister of Interjurisdictional Coordination in one of the first provisional governments.\n\nAfter the Revolution, elections were called for 25 April 1975 and the Socialist Party (PS) won the [[1975 Portuguese Constituent Assembly election|1975 election for the Constituent Assembly]] and the [[1976 Portuguese legislative election|1976 elections for the National Assembly]], then losing to the [[Democratic Alliance (Portugal)|Democratic Alliance]] (AD) in the [[1979 Portuguese legislative election|1979 legislative election]].\n\nIn 1980, the PS made an electoral alliance called the [[Republican and Socialist Front]] (FRS), between the Independent Social Democrats (ASDI), led by Sousa Franco, and the [[Leftwing Union for the Socialist Democracy]] (UEDS), led by Lopes Cardoso. The alliance failed to defeat the AD.\n\nThey won the 1983 general election, but without an [[absolute majority]], the Socialists formed a [[grand coalition]] with the centre-right [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD), creating a \"[[Central Block]]\". The new government began negotiations for Portugal to enter the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC). In 1985 the Central Block broke down and the PS at the time led by [[Almeida Santos]], lost the [[1985 Portuguese legislative election|1985 legislative election]]. Cavaco Silva's PSD won the 1985 elections and again in 1987 and 1991 with absolute majority. The PS was in opposition for more than ten years.\n\nIn 1995, the Socialist Party, then led by [[Ant\u00f3nio Guterres]], won a general election for the first time in twelve years, and in 1999, they failed to obtain what would have been an historic [[absolute majority]] for the party by only one MP. In 2001, after a massive defeat in the 2001 local elections, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres resigned as Prime Minister and called for new elections in 2002. The Socialist Party lost the [[2002 Portuguese legislative election|2002 general election]] by a small margin to the PSD, who formed a coalition government with the [[CDS \u2013 People's Party|People's Party]] (CDS\u2013PP).\n\nIn June 2004, the PS won the [[2004 European Parliament election in Portugal|2004 European elections]] by a landslide, and a few weeks later, [[Dur\u00e3o Barroso]], leader of the PSD and Prime Minister, resigned to become President of the European Commission. In December 2004, [[Jorge Sampaio]], President of the Republic, called fresh [[2005 Portuguese legislative election|elections for February 2005]]. These elections resulted in a landslide victory for the PS, winning for the first time since its foundation an absolute majority. [[Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates]], leader of the PS, became Prime Minister.\n\nIn 2009, after four-and-a-half years in power, the PS lost the [[2009 European Parliament election in Portugal|European Parliament elections]] to the PSD. However, they won the [[2009 Portuguese legislative election|general election]] held on 27 September but failed to renew the absolute majority they won in the [[2005 Portuguese legislative election|2005 election]]. The PS later introduced and legislated [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|same-sex marriage]].\n\nThe [[Eurozone crisis|financial crisis of 2011]] hit Portugal very hard, prompting S\u00f3crates' government to impose harsh [[austerity|austerity measures]]. On 23 March 2011, the entire opposition in Parliament said no to new measures proposed by the government. As a result of this, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates resigned as Prime Minister and a [[2011 Portuguese legislative election|snap election took place on 5 June 2011]].\n\nIn the elections, the PS suffered a huge setback, with 28.1% of the vote, ten points behind the PSD, who formed another coalition government with the CDS-PP. S\u00f3crates resigned as General Secretary on election night after the PS's worst result since 1987. On 23 July 2011, [[Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro]] was elected as S\u00f3crates' successor.\n\nThe PS, under the leadership of Seguro, won the [[2013 Portuguese local elections|2013 local elections]] making significant gains over the PSD and the Socialists again won the [[2014 European Parliament election in Portugal|European elections on May 2014]] but this time only just. They won 31.5% of the vote against the almost 28% of the alliance between the PSD and CDS-PP. The result was considered quite a disappointment to many Socialist party members and supporters and on 27 May [[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], the then mayor of Lisbon, announced that he would stand for the leadership of the Socialist Party.<ref name=\"leadership\">{{cite news |title=Ant\u00f3nio Costa avan\u00e7a para a lideran\u00e7a do PS |first1=S\u00e1 Louren\u00e7o |last1=Nuno |newspaper=[[P\u00fablico (Portugal)|P\u00fablico]] |date=27 May 2014 |url=http://www.publico.pt/politica/noticia/antonio-costa-avanca-para-a-lideranca-do-ps-1637636 |accessdate=4 September 2014}}</ref> Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro refused to call a new congress and leadership election and instead called for a [[Portuguese Socialist Party prime ministerial primary, 2014|primary election]], to be held on 28 September, to elect the party's candidate for Prime Minister in the 2015 general elections.<ref name=\"primary\">{{cite news |title=Aprovada a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de elei\u00e7\u00f5es prim\u00e1rias no PS a 28 de setembro |first1=Roque |last1=Telma |newspaper=[[Jornal de Not\u00edcias]] |date=6 June 2014 |url=http://www.jn.pt/PaginaInicial/Politica/Interior.aspx?content_id=3957251 |accessdate=4 September 2014}}</ref> Ant\u00f3nio Costa easily defeated Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro in the primaries by a 67% to 31% margin.\n\nIn the [[2015 Portuguese legislative election|2015 legislative elections]], the PS polled a disappointing second place, capturing just 32% of the votes against the 38.6% of the PSD/CDS-PP coalition called [[Portugal Ahead]]. Despite the victory of the PSD/CDS-PP coalition, the centre-left and left-wing parties achieved a clear majority in Parliament. After the second Passos Coelho cabinet fell in Parliament, with the approval of a no-confidence motion, the PS forged an agreement with [[Left Bloc|BE]] and [[Unitary Democratic Coalition|CDU]] to support a PS minority government. For the first time in Portuguese democracy, the leader of the second most voted political force became [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]].\n\nCosta led a very successful first term as Prime Minister with a growing economy, low unemployment and deficit cuts. In the [[2019 European Parliament election in Portugal|2019 May EP elections]], the PS won a landslide by achieving 33.4%, against the 22% of the PSD. The PS also won the [[2019 Portuguese legislative election|October 2019 general election]] with 36% of the votes, against the 28% of the PSD, but by a closer margin than expected.

It was founded on 19 April 1973 in the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Bad M\u00fcnstereifel]], by militants from the Portuguese Socialist Action ({{lang-pt|Ac\u00e7\u00e3o Socialista Portuguesa}}). The PS is one of the two [[Major party|major parties]] in Portuguese politics, its rival being the centre-right [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD). The current leader of the PS is [[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], the [[Prime Minister of Portugal]]. The party has currently 108 of 230 seats in the Portuguese Parliament following the [[2019 Portuguese legislative election|October 2019 election]], forming a minority government.\n\nPS is a member of the [[Socialist International]], [[Progressive Alliance]] and [[Party of European Socialists]], and has nine members in the [[European Parliament]] within the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|Socialists & Democrats]] (S&D) Group during the [[9th European Parliament|ninth parliament]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ant\u00f3nio Costa img 6536.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]] since November 2015 and Secretary-General since 2014.]]\n{{Social democracy sidebar}}\nThe Socialist Party (PS) was created at a conference of Portuguese Socialist Action (ASP), at that time in exile, on 19 April 1973, in [[Bad M\u00fcnstereifel]] in [[West Germany]]. The twenty-seven delegates decided to found a party of [[socialism]] and [[Political freedom|freedom]], making an explicit reference to a [[classless society]] and without [[Marxism]], redesigned as a source of principal inspiration.\n\nOn 25 April 1974, the [[Carnation Revolution]] brought down the authoritarian regime of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]], established in 1933, and democracy was restored. The general secretary of the PS, M\u00e1rio Soares, returned to Portugal after being in exile in France, and became [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Portugal)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Almeida Santos]] was appointed Minister of Interjurisdictional Coordination in one of the first provisional governments.\n\nAfter the Revolution, elections were called for 25 April 1975 and the Socialist Party (PS) won the [[1975 Portuguese Constituent Assembly election|1975 election for the Constituent Assembly]] and the [[1976 Portuguese legislative election|1976 elections for the National Assembly]], then losing to the [[Democratic Alliance (Portugal)|Democratic Alliance]] (AD) in the [[1979 Portuguese legislative election|1979 legislative election]].\n\nIn 1980, the PS made an electoral alliance called the [[Republican and Socialist Front]] (FRS), between the Independent Social Democrats (ASDI), led by Sousa Franco, and the [[Leftwing Union for the Socialist Democracy]] (UEDS), led by Lopes Cardoso. The alliance failed to defeat the AD.\n\nThey won the 1983 general election, but without an [[absolute majority]], the Socialists formed a [[grand coalition]] with the centre-right [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD), creating a \"[[Central Block]]\". The new government began negotiations for Portugal to enter the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC). In 1985 the Central Block broke down and the PS at the time led by [[Almeida Santos]], lost the [[1985 Portuguese legislative election|1985 legislative election]]. Cavaco Silva's PSD won the 1985 elections and again in 1987 and 1991 with absolute majority. The PS was in opposition for more than ten years.\n\nIn 1995, the Socialist Party, then led by [[Ant\u00f3nio Guterres]], won a general election for the first time in twelve years, and in 1999, they failed to obtain what would have been an historic [[absolute majority]] for the party by only one MP. In 2001, after a massive defeat in the 2001 local elections, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres resigned as Prime Minister and called for new elections in 2002. The Socialist Party lost the [[2002 Portuguese legislative election|2002 general election]] by a small margin to the PSD, who formed a coalition government with the [[CDS \u2013 People's Party|People's Party]] (CDS\u2013PP).\n\nIn June 2004, the PS won the [[2004 European Parliament election in Portugal|2004 European elections]] by a landslide, and a few weeks later, [[Dur\u00e3o Barroso]], leader of the PSD and Prime Minister, resigned to become President of the European Commission. In December 2004, [[Jorge Sampaio]], President of the Republic, called fresh [[2005 Portuguese legislative election|elections for February 2005]]. These elections resulted in a landslide victory for the PS, winning for the first time since its foundation an absolute majority. [[Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates]], leader of the PS, became Prime Minister.\n\nIn 2009, after four-and-a-half years in power, the PS lost the [[2009 European Parliament election in Portugal|European Parliament elections]] to the PSD. However, they won the [[2009 Portuguese legislative election|general election]] held on 27 September but failed to renew the absolute majority they won in the [[2005 Portuguese legislative election|2005 election]]. The PS later introduced and legislated [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|same-sex marriage]].\n\nThe [[Eurozone crisis|financial crisis of 2011]] hit Portugal very hard, prompting S\u00f3crates' government to impose harsh [[austerity|austerity measures]]. On 23 March 2011, the entire opposition in Parliament said no to new measures proposed by the government. As a result of this, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates resigned as Prime Minister and a [[2011 Portuguese legislative election|snap election took place on 5 June 2011]].\n\nIn the elections, the PS suffered a huge setback, with 28.1% of the vote, ten points behind the PSD, who formed another coalition government with the CDS-PP. S\u00f3crates resigned as General Secretary on election night after the PS's worst result since 1987. On 23 July 2011, [[Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro]] was elected as S\u00f3crates' successor.\n\nThe PS, under the leadership of Seguro, won the [[2013 Portuguese local elections|2013 local elections]] making significant gains over the PSD and the Socialists again won the [[2014 European Parliament election in Portugal|European elections on May 2014]] but this time only just. They won 31.5% of the vote against the almost 28% of the alliance between the PSD and CDS-PP. The result was considered quite a disappointment to many Socialist party members and supporters and on May 27 [[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], the then mayor of Lisbon, announced that he would stand for the leadership of the Socialist Party.<ref name=\"leadership\">{{cite news |title=Ant\u00f3nio Costa avan\u00e7a para a lideran\u00e7a do PS |first1=S\u00e1 Louren\u00e7o |last1=Nuno |newspaper=[[P\u00fablico (Portugal)|P\u00fablico]] |date=27 May 2014 |url=http://www.publico.pt/politica/noticia/antonio-costa-avanca-para-a-lideranca-do-ps-1637636 |accessdate=4 September 2014}}</ref> Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro refused to call a new congress and leadership election and instead called for a [[Portuguese Socialist Party prime ministerial primary, 2014|primary election]], to be held on 28 September, to elect the party's candidate for Prime Minister in the 2015 general elections.<ref name=\"primary\">{{cite news |title=Aprovada a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de elei\u00e7\u00f5es prim\u00e1rias no PS a 28 de setembro |first1=Roque |last1=Telma |newspaper=[[Jornal de Not\u00edcias]] |date=6 June 2014 |url=http://www.jn.pt/PaginaInicial/Politica/Interior.aspx?content_id=3957251 |accessdate=4 September 2014}}</ref> Ant\u00f3nio Costa easily defeated Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro in the primaries by a 67% to 31% margin.\n\nIn the [[2015 Portuguese legislative election|2015 legislative elections]], the PS polled a disappointing second place, capturing just 32% of the votes against the 38.6% of the PSD/CDS-PP coalition called [[Portugal Ahead]]. Despite the victory of the PSD/CDS-PP coalition, the centre-left and left-wing parties achieved a clear majority in Parliament. After the second Passos Coelho cabinet fell in Parliament, with the approval of a no-confidence motion, the PS forged an agreement with [[Left Bloc|BE]] and [[Unitary Democratic Coalition|CDU]] to support a PS minority government. For the first time in Portuguese democracy, the leader of the second most voted political force became [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]].\n\nCosta led a very successful first term as Prime Minister with a growing economy, low unemployment and deficit cuts. In the [[2019 European Parliament election in Portugal|2019 May EP elections]], the PS won a landslide by achieving 33.4%, against the 22% of the PSD. The PS also won the [[2019 Portuguese legislative election|October 2019 general election]] with 36% of the votes, against the 28% of the PSD, but by a closer margin than expected. Costa 2nd cabinet was sworn in on 26 October 2019.\n\n==Election results==\n\n===Assembly of the Republic===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:100%; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"50px\"| Election\n! colspan=\"5\"| [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"170px\"| Government\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40px\"| Size\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Leader\n|-\n! width=\"85px\"| Votes\n! width=\"50px\"| %\n! width=\"40px\"| \u00b1[[Percentage point|pp]]\n! width=\"100px\"| Seats won\n! width=\"40px\"| +/\u2212\n|-\n!

A modern [[front-wheel drive]] construction like the [[Fiat 128]] launched concurrently, it was based on the revolutionary [[Autobianchi Primula]], Fiat's first \"experiment\" with the [[transverse engine]] front-wheel-drive setup.<ref name=\"carsfrom\">{{cite web |url=http://www.carsfromitaly.net/others/index.html |title=Autobianchi A111 |website=carsfromitaly.net |accessdate=3 August 2006}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Development===\nIn 1957 Autobianchi produced the [[Bianchina]], an upmarket version of the [[Fiat 500]], and the [[Autobianchi Primula|Primula]] [[small family car]]. Offered both as a [[fastback]] saloon and [[hatchback]], the 1964 Primula was Fiat's first front-wheel drive production car. It had pioneered the [[Transverse engine|transverse-engined]] [[front-wheel drive]] layout with the transmission and clutch to the left of the engine, which today is almost universally used on front-wheel drive cars. The brainchild of [[Dante Giacosa]]{{efn|At the head of Fiat's technical office, Giacosa had been experimentation with transverse-engined front-drive cars since the 1940s.}} this mechanical layout had been developed for the Fiat ''123'', an experimental project undertaken to test various unconventional engine and transmission layouts for a mid-sized [[Fiat 1100|1100]] replacement; when Fiat's management endorsed the traditionally laid out (front-longitudinal engine, rear-wheel drive) [[Fiat 124|124]] instead, it had spawned the innovative Autobianchi Primula.<ref>{{cite book |first=Dante |last=Giacosa |title=I miei 40 anni di progettazione alla Fiat |publisher=Centro Storico Fiat |year=2014 |orig-year=1st pub.

Size-wise, the A111 slotted between Fiat's 128 and 124 sedans, being also significantly bigger than the previously biggest Autobianchi, the said Primula.\n\n===Launch, updates and demise===\nThe Autobianchi A111 was introduced in April 1969,<ref name=\"lastampa 4/1969\">{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,8/articleid,0125_01_1969_0099_0008_24766392/ |first=Ferruccio |last=Bernab\u00f2 |title=Anche l'Autobianchi presenta una novit\u00e0: la berlina \"A 111\" |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |date=27 April 1969 |page=8 |language=it |accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref> and deliveries began in May.<ref name=\"lastampa 5/1969\" />\nThe interior, seating four or five, was rather well-appointed, with a genuine [[wood]] fascia on the dashboard,<ref name=\"lum\" /> individual sliding and reclining front seats, fully carpeted floor, and cloth, cloth-and-leatherette or full leatherette upholstery.\nAutobianchi advertised a top speed of {{convert|155|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"lastampa 4/1969\" />\n\nA lightly revised A111 was introduced at the 52nd [[Turin Motor Show]] in October/November 1970.<ref name=\"lastampa 11/1970\">{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,22/articleid,0134_01_1970_0237_0022_4840749/ |title=Autobianchi: una produzione di alto livello qualitativo |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |date=4 November 1970 |page=22 |language=it |accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref> A distinguishing feature of these \"series 2\" cars were double-stacked tail lamps, of the same design seen on the original A111.<ref name=\"lastampa 11/1970\" /> New bumpers gained rubbing strips but dispensed with the over-riders (bringing overall length to less than four metres), there was new model badging on the tail, and the interior was partly redesigned, including a new centre console and a shorter gear shifter.<ref name=\"lastampa 11/1970\" />\n\nAs the 1970s progressed, Fiat has introduced an increasing number of FWD cars under its own brand, and thus the Autobianchis became redundant.

The brainchild of [[Dante Giacosa]]{{efn|At the head of Fiat's technical office, Giacosa had been experimentation with transverse-engined front-drive cars since the 1940s.}} this mechanical layout had been developed for the Fiat ''123'', an experimental project undertaken to test various unconventional engine and transmission layouts for a mid-sized [[Fiat 1100|1100]] replacement; when Fiat's management endorsed the traditionally laid out (front-longitudinal engine, rear-wheel drive) [[Fiat 124|124]] instead, it had spawned the innovative Autobianchi Primula.<ref>{{cite book |first=Dante |last=Giacosa |title=I miei 40 anni di progettazione alla Fiat |publisher=Centro Storico Fiat |year=2014 |orig-year=1st pub.

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 92 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year. Never having biological children, the couple adopted V\u00e1clav's brother son V\u00e1clav and Marie's sister's daughter Josefa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M93F-QVF|title=United States Census, 1900|last=Konchal|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA significant number of the immigrants share a [[Genetic testing|DNA]] and blood relation via children of the couple Krystof Sramek (1700-1767) and Katerina Hithova (1705-1760) from Klikarov, Vojovice, and [[Lou\u017en\u00e1|Louzna]] in the 18th century.\n\n* Katerina Sramkova (1727-1798) is the ancestor of the Kotesovec's and the Popule's.\n*Dorota Sramkova (1730-1796) is the ancestor of the Protova's, Blazek's, and Vojtech Zeleny (specifically).\n*Ondrej Sramek (1743-) is the great grandfather of the Poustkova sisters.

In 1999, Sir [[Andrew Motion]], [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom]], listed it as the greatest song lyric ever written.\n\nDylan first recorded the song in New York City in November 1965, under the working title of \"Freeze Out\", but was dissatisfied with the results. When the ''Blonde on Blonde'' recording sessions moved to Nashville in February 1966, Dylan attempted the composition again with different musicians, and decided to release this performance. All of the alternate versions of the song have been officially released, but some only on a limited edition collectors set: many of them are November 1965 or later 1966 studio [[outtakes]], and two others are live performances from his [[Bob Dylan World Tour 1966|1966 world tour]].\n\nNumerous artists have recorded [[cover version]]s of the song, including the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Marianne Faithfull]] and [[Robyn Hitchcock]].\n\n==Recording==\n[[Clinton Heylin]] places the writing of \"Visions of Johanna\" in the fall of 1965, when Dylan was living in the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]] with his pregnant wife [[Sara Dylan|Sara]]. Heylin notes that \"in this d\u00e9class\u00e9 hotel\u2026the heat pipes ''still'' cough\", referring to a line from the song.<ref name = \"Heylin273\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|pp=273\u2013279}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Visions of Johanna (Bobdylan.com)}}</ref> [[Greil Marcus]] reports that when the song was first released, \"the story was that the song had been written during the great [[Northeast blackout of 1965|east coast blackout of November 9, 1965]].\"<ref name = \"Marcus\">{{harvnb|Marcus|2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bob Dylan and The Band - 1974.jpg|thumb|left|Dylan performs with [[The Band]] on their [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|1974 tour]]. Dylan's first attempt to record \"Visions of Johanna\" in 1965 was backed by members of this group, known in their earlier incarnation as The Hawks.]]\nDylan first recorded this song, backed by [[The Band#With Bob Dylan|The Hawks]], in the CBS New York recording studio, on November 30, 1965, announcing his new composition with the words: \"This is called 'Freeze Out'.\"<ref name=\"Wilentz110\">{{harvnb|Wilentz|2009|pp=110\u2013113}}</ref> Andy Gill notes that this working title captures the \"air of nocturnal suspension in which the verse tableaux are sketched...full of whispering and muttering.\"<ref name=\"Gill97\">{{harvnb|Gill|1998|pp=97\u201399}}</ref> According to Marcus, Dylan introduced the song in live performances in 1966 with the words, \"Seems like a freeze-out.\"<ref name = \"Marcus\"/>\n\nSome of the New York recordings were uptempo and contain in the fifth verse the additional line \"He examines the nightingale's code\". Historian [[Sean Wilentz]], for his book ''Dylan In America'', listened closely to full studio tapes of the ''Blonde on Blonde'' sessions, and describes how Dylan guided the New York backing musicians through fourteen takes, trying to explain how he wanted \"Visions of Johanna\" played. At one point, Dylan says: \"It's not [[hard rock]], The only thing in it that's hard is [[Robbie Robertson|Robbie]].\" Analyzing the evolution of the song in the New York recording session, Wilentz writes that Dylan \"quiets things down, inching closer to what will eventually appear on ''Blonde on Blonde''\u2014and it is still not right.\"<ref name=\"Wilentz110\"/>  Several complete takes of the song<ref name = \"Heylin277\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|p=277}}</ref> were recorded on November 30, including one with an uptempo rock beat, containing harpsichord accompaniment, and another with a march-like tempo, which was released on ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack]]'' in 2005.<ref>{{harvnb|Gorodetsky|2005}}</ref>\n\n{{Listen|filename=Visions_Of_Johanna.ogg|title=Visions of Johanna|description=Describing \"Visions of Johanna\" as \"Dylan's most haunting and complex love song and his finest poem\", [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]] suggests that Dylan \"constantly seeks to transcend the physical world, to reach the ideal where the visions of Johanna become real\".<ref name=\"Shelton225\">{{harvnb|Shelton|2011|p=225}}</ref>}}\"Visions of Johanna\" fell into place when Dylan was persuaded by his producer, [[Bob Johnston]], to move the recording sessions to [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. During his first day in the CBS Nashville studio, on February 14, 1966, the ''Blonde on Blonde'' version of the song was recorded. In an interview with Andy Gill, [[Al Kooper]] has said that he and guitarist Robbie Robertson became sensitive to the nuances of Dylan's vocal.<ref name=\"Gill97\"/> Kooper added that \"it's very important what [[Joe South|Joe South's]] bass is doing in that\"; Kooper described it as \"this throbbing...rhythmically amazing bass part\".<ref name=\"Gill97\"/> Other backing musicians were [[Charlie McCoy]], guitar, [[Wayne Moss]], guitar, and [[Kenneth Buttrey]] on drums.<ref>{{harvnb|Bj\u00f6rner|2011}}</ref>\n\n==Live performances and studio outtakes==\n[[File:Ginsberg-dylan.jpg|thumb|250px|Dylan plays a song to Allen Ginsberg during the [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] of 1975. Ginsberg's poetic technique has been cited as an influence on Dylan at the time he wrote \"Visions of Johanna\".]]\nDylan first performed \"Visions of Johanna\" in public on December 4, 1965, at the [[Berkeley Community Theatre]]. Present at this concert was [[Joan Baez]], who believed the lyrics referred to her. She said, \"He'd just written 'Visions of Johanna', which sounded very suspicious to me...he'd never performed it before and [[Bobby Neuwirth|Neuwirth]] told him I was there that night and he performed it.\"<ref name = \"Heylin275\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|p=275}}</ref> Heylin suggests that if Dylan performed it for anyone that night it was [[Allen Ginsberg]], who was also present.

Dylan's performance of the song at [[London]]'s [[Royal Albert Hall]] on May 26, 1966, appeared on ''[[Biograph (album)|Biograph]]'', released in 1985. Asked by [[Cameron Crowe]], for the liner notes for ''Biograph'', how he could remember the words of such a complex song in live performance, Dylan responded, \"I could remember a song without writing it down because it was so visual.\"<ref name = \"Crowe\">{{harvnb|Crowe|1985}}</ref> A performance of the song recorded at the [[Manchester]] [[Free Trade Hall]] on May 17, 1966 was released on ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The \"Royal Albert Hall\" Concert|The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966]]'' in 1998.<ref>{{harvnb|Glover|1998}}</ref>  In addition, a May 6, 1966 performance of the song, recorded in Belfast, was included on ''Live 1962-1966: Rare Performances From The Copyright Collections'', released in 2018.\n\nOn November 11, 2016, [[Legacy Recordings]] released a 36-CD boxed set, ''[[The 1966 Live Recordings]]'', which comprises every known recording of Bob Dylan\u2019s 1966 concert tour.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-bob-dylan-1966-live-recordings-20160927-snap-story.html| title = All of Bob Dylan's 1966 live shows in 36-CD box set due Nov. 11| author = Lewis, Randy| date = September 27, 2016| accessdate = September 28, 2016| work = Los Angeles Times}}</ref> The recordings commence with the concert in White Plains, New York on February 5, 1966, and end with the [[Royal Albert Hall]] concert in London on May 27.

Ultimately, for Gill, the song seeks to convey how the artist is compelled to keep striving to pursue some elusive vision of perfection.<ref name=\"Gill97\"/>\n\nClinton Heylin has described what he construes as the strange circumstances surrounding the song. Written around the time of Dylan's marriage to Sara Lownds, Heylin describes it as \"one of the oddest songs ever written by a man who has just tied the knot and is enjoying a brief honeymoon in the city\".<ref name = \"Heylin273\"/> Noting that the song is an elegy for a past lover, Heylin speculates that \"it is awfully tempting to see Johanna as his muse\" who, in the song, is \"not here\". For Heylin, the triumph of the song lies in \"the way Dylan manages to write about the most inchoate feelings in such a vivid, immediate way\".<ref name = \"Heylin273\"/>\n\nDylan critic [[Michael Gray (author)|Michael Gray]] also praises the subtlety of the song. Gray acknowledges that it is difficult to say what this song is \"about\", since it is at once indefinable and precise. For Gray, its principal achievement lies in the way it confuses categories, using language to be simultaneously serious and flippant, delicate and coarse, and mixing up \"abstract neo-philosophy and figurative phraseology\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|2000|pp=154\u2013155}}</ref>\n\nRobert Shelton called \"Visions of Johanna\" one of Dylan's major works. He writes that Dylan's technique of throwing out \"skittering images\" evokes \"a mind floating downstream\"; these \"non-sequential visions\" are the record of a fractured consciousness.<ref name=\"Shelton225\"/> Shelton argues that the song explores a hopeless quest to reach an ideal, the visions of Johanna, and yet without this quest life becomes meaningless. He suggests that the same paradox is explored by [[John Keats|Keats]] in his \"[[Ode on a Grecian Urn]]\".<ref name=\"Shelton225\"/>\n\n[[Mike Marqusee]] situates the song in New York City, \"a flickering, electric, ghostly, cityscape\".<ref name=marqusee206-207>{{harvnb|Marqusee|2005|pp=206\u2013207}}</ref> Dylan describes himself stranded in a fog of detachment which provides a haven, and at the same time is pained by a piercing clarity: an unmediated response that is \"too concise and too clear\". For Marqusee, Dylan describes his predicament, suspended between freedom and slavery, yet hungry for an authentic experience. Johanna and Louise are objects of desire and yearning. \"It is their elusiveness and unreality that's the point.\"<ref name=marqusee206-207/>\n\nGuitarist and critic [[Bill Janovitz]] also emphasizes the urban, unreal quality of \"Visions of Johanna\", calling it a \"sprawling epic\". \"The journey takes Dylan through lofts, the D train, a museum, empty lots, and through snippets of overheard conversation, as well as a discussion with some 'little boy lost', who 'takes himself so seriously', and who is 'so useless and all/muttering small talk at the wall'.\" For Janovitz, this  could \"possibly be a swipe at a critic\".<ref name=\"AllMusicJanovitz\">{{harvnb|Janovitz||}}</ref>\n\nLiterary critic [[Christopher Ricks]], in his study of Dylan's work, pinpoints the emotional effect of these same lines:\n\n::::''He\u2019s sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all''\n::::''Muttering small talk at the wall while I\u2019m in the hall''\n\nRicks writes that the phrase \"and all\" turns a mood of helplessness into a sense of \"aggression and baffled anger\".<ref>{{harvnb|Ricks|2003|pp=487\u2013488}}</ref>\n\nTrying to unravel the mystery of the song, Greil Marcus writes that the song is concerned with internal questions, rather than external ones: \"Line by line, 'Blowin' in the Wind' is pious, or falsely innocent\u2014isn't it obvious that whoever wrote \"Yes, 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail / Before she sleeps in the sand?\" already knows the answer, assuming he, or anyone, can actually bring themselves to care about such a precious question? But 'Visions of Johanna' is asking different sorts of questions. Such as: Where are you? Who are you? What are you doing here?\" Evoking the drugged, urban milieu of the song, Marcus writes of \"People wandering from one corner of a loft to another, doped, drunk, half-awake, fast asleep, no point to the next breath, let alone the next step.\" For Marcus, \"'Visions of Johanna' makes a narrative solely out of atmosphere.\"<ref name = \"Marcus\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe song has been described by several critics as a masterpiece.<ref name = \"Heylin273\"/><ref name=\"Wilentz110\"/><ref name=\"Gill97\"/> In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine placed the song at No.&nbsp;404 on their list of [[the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]],<ref>{{harvnb|500 Greatest Songs of All Time (2004): 401\u2013500}}</ref> commenting that Dylan \"never sounded lonelier than in this seven-minute ballad, cut in a single take on Valentine's Day 1966.\" (When ''Rolling Stone'' updated their list in 2010, the song dropped to No.&nbsp;413.)<ref>{{harvnb|500 Greatest Songs of All Time (2010): #413 \"Visions of Johanna\"}}</ref> In 1999, Britain's Poet Laureate, [[Andrew Motion]], chose it as his candidate for the best song lyric ever written.

In 1999, Sir [[Andrew Motion]], [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom]], listed it as the greatest song lyric ever written.\n\nDylan first recorded the song in New York City in November 1965, under the working title of \"Freeze Out\", but was dissatisfied with the results. When the ''Blonde on Blonde'' recording sessions moved to Nashville in February 1966, Dylan attempted the composition again with different musicians, and decided to release this performance. All of the alternate versions of the song have been officially released, but some only on a limited edition collectors set: many of them are November 1965 or later 1966 studio [[outtakes]], and two others are live performances from his [[Bob Dylan World Tour 1966|1966 world tour]].\n\nNumerous artists have recorded [[cover version]]s of the song, including the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Marianne Faithfull]] and [[Robyn Hitchcock]].\n\n==Recording==\n[[Clinton Heylin]] places the writing of \"Visions of Johanna\" in the fall of 1965, when Dylan was living in the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]] with his pregnant wife [[Sara Dylan|Sara]]. Heylin notes that \"in this d\u00e9class\u00e9 hotel\u2026the heat pipes ''still'' cough\", referring to a line from the song.<ref name = \"Heylin273\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|pp=273\u2013279}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Visions of Johanna (Bobdylan.com)}}</ref> [[Greil Marcus]] reports that when the song was first released, \"the story was that the song had been written during the great [[Northeast blackout of 1965|east coast blackout of November 9, 1965]].\"<ref name = \"Marcus\">{{harvnb|Marcus|2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bob Dylan and The Band - 1974.jpg|thumb|left|Dylan performs with [[The Band]] on their [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|1974 tour]]. Dylan's first attempt to record \"Visions of Johanna\" in 1965 was backed by members of this group, known in their earlier incarnation as The Hawks.]]\nDylan first recorded this song, backed by [[The Band#With Bob Dylan|The Hawks]], in the CBS New York recording studio, on November 30, 1965, announcing his new composition with the words: \"This is called 'Freeze Out'.\"<ref name=\"Wilentz110\">{{harvnb|Wilentz|2009|pp=110\u2013113}}</ref> Andy Gill notes that this working title captures the \"air of nocturnal suspension in which the verse tableaux are sketched...full of whispering and muttering.\"<ref name=\"Gill97\">{{harvnb|Gill|1998|pp=97\u201399}}</ref> According to Marcus, Dylan introduced the song in live performances in 1966 with the words, \"Seems like a freeze-out.\"<ref name = \"Marcus\"/>\n\nSome of the New York recordings were uptempo and contain in the fifth verse the additional line \"He examines the nightingale's code\". Historian [[Sean Wilentz]], for his book ''Dylan In America'', listened closely to full studio tapes of the ''Blonde on Blonde'' sessions, and describes how Dylan guided the New York backing musicians through fourteen takes, trying to explain how he wanted \"Visions of Johanna\" played. At one point, Dylan says: \"It's not [[hard rock]], The only thing in it that's hard is [[Robbie Robertson|Robbie]].\" Analyzing the evolution of the song in the New York recording session, Wilentz writes that Dylan \"quiets things down, inching closer to what will eventually appear on ''Blonde on Blonde''\u2014and it is still not right.\"<ref name=\"Wilentz110\"/>  Several complete takes of the song<ref name = \"Heylin277\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|p=277}}</ref> were recorded on November 30, including one with an uptempo rock beat, containing harpsichord accompaniment, and another with a march-like tempo, which was released on ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack]]'' in 2005.<ref>{{harvnb|Gorodetsky|2005}}</ref>\n\n{{Listen|filename=Visions_Of_Johanna.ogg|title=Visions of Johanna|description=Describing \"Visions of Johanna\" as \"Dylan's most haunting and complex love song and his finest poem\", [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]] suggests that Dylan \"constantly seeks to transcend the physical world, to reach the ideal where the visions of Johanna become real\".<ref name=\"Shelton225\">{{harvnb|Shelton|2011|p=225}}</ref>}}\"Visions of Johanna\" fell into place when Dylan was persuaded by his producer, [[Bob Johnston]], to move the recording sessions to [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. During his first day in the CBS Nashville studio, on February 14, 1966, the ''Blonde on Blonde'' version of the song was recorded. In an interview with Andy Gill, [[Al Kooper]] has said that he and guitarist Robbie Robertson became sensitive to the nuances of Dylan's vocal.<ref name=\"Gill97\"/> Kooper added that \"it's very important what [[Joe South|Joe South's]] bass is doing in that\"; Kooper described it as \"this throbbing...rhythmically amazing bass part\".<ref name=\"Gill97\"/> Other backing musicians were [[Charlie McCoy]], guitar, [[Wayne Moss]], guitar, and [[Kenneth Buttrey]] on drums.<ref>{{harvnb|Bj\u00f6rner|2011}}</ref>\n\n==Live performances and studio outtakes==\n[[File:Ginsberg-dylan.jpg|thumb|250px|Dylan plays a song to Allen Ginsberg during the [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] of 1975. Ginsberg's poetic technique has been cited as an influence on Dylan at the time he wrote \"Visions of Johanna\".]]\nDylan first performed \"Visions of Johanna\" in public on December 4, 1965, at the [[Berkeley Community Theatre]]. Present at this concert was [[Joan Baez]], who believed the lyrics referred to her. She said, \"He'd just written 'Visions of Johanna', which sounded very suspicious to me...he'd never performed it before and [[Bobby Neuwirth|Neuwirth]] told him I was there that night and he performed it.\"<ref name = \"Heylin275\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|p=275}}</ref> Heylin suggests that if Dylan performed it for anyone that night it was [[Allen Ginsberg]], who was also present. Heylin argues Dylan considered Ginsberg to be an important influence on his songwriting at this juncture, and was keen to showcase the song for the [[Beat Generation|Beat poet]].<ref name = \"Heylin275\"/>\n\nAll live versions of the song recorded during Dylan's 1966 tour of England have been released. Dylan's performance of the song at [[London]]'s [[Royal Albert Hall]] on May 26, 1966 appeared on ''[[Biograph (album)|Biograph]]'', released in 1985. Asked by [[Cameron Crowe]], for the liner notes for ''Biograph'', how he could remember the words of such a complex song in live performance, Dylan responded, \"I could remember a song without writing it down because it was so visual.\"<ref name = \"Crowe\">{{harvnb|Crowe|1985}}</ref> A performance of the song recorded at the [[Manchester]] [[Free Trade Hall]] on May 17, 1966 was released on ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The \"Royal Albert Hall\" Concert|The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966]]'' in 1998.<ref>{{harvnb|Glover|1998}}</ref>  In addition, a May 6, 1966 performance of the song, recorded in Belfast, was included on ''Live 1962-1966: Rare Performances From The Copyright Collections'', released in 2018.\n\nOn November 11, 2016, [[Legacy Recordings]] released a 36-CD boxed set, ''[[The 1966 Live Recordings]]'', which comprises every known recording of Bob Dylan\u2019s 1966 concert tour.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-bob-dylan-1966-live-recordings-20160927-snap-story.html| title = All of Bob Dylan's 1966 live shows in 36-CD box set due Nov. 11| author = Lewis, Randy| date = September 27, 2016| accessdate = September 28, 2016| work = Los Angeles Times}}</ref> The recordings commence with the concert in White Plains, New York on February 5, 1966, and end with the [[Royal Albert Hall]] concert in London on May 27.

Ultimately, for Gill, the song seeks to convey how the artist is compelled to keep striving to pursue some elusive vision of perfection.<ref name=\"Gill97\"/>\n\nClinton Heylin has described what he construes as the strange circumstances surrounding the song. Written around the time of Dylan's marriage to Sara Lownds, Heylin describes it as \"one of the oddest songs ever written by a man who has just tied the knot and is enjoying a brief honeymoon in the city\".<ref name = \"Heylin273\"/> Noting that the song is an elegy for a past lover, Heylin speculates that \"it is awfully tempting to see Johanna as his muse\" who, in the song, is \"not here\". For Heylin, the triumph of the song lies in \"the way Dylan manages to write about the most inchoate feelings in such a vivid, immediate way\".<ref name = \"Heylin273\"/>\n\nDylan critic [[Michael Gray (author)|Michael Gray]] also praises the subtlety of the song. Gray acknowledges that it is difficult to say what this song is \"about\", since it is at once indefinable and precise. For Gray, its principal achievement lies in the way it confuses categories, using language to be simultaneously serious and flippant, delicate and coarse, and mixing up \"abstract neo-philosophy and figurative phraseology\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|2000|pp=154\u2013155}}</ref>\n\nRobert Shelton called \"Visions of Johanna\" one of Dylan's major works. He writes that Dylan's technique of throwing out \"skittering images\" evokes \"a mind floating downstream\"; these \"non-sequential visions\" are the record of a fractured consciousness.<ref name=\"Shelton225\"/> Shelton argues that the song explores a hopeless quest to reach an ideal, the visions of Johanna, and yet without this quest life becomes meaningless. He suggests that the same paradox is explored by [[John Keats|Keats]] in his \"[[Ode on a Grecian Urn]]\".<ref name=\"Shelton225\"/>\n\n[[Mike Marqusee]] situates the song in New York City, \"a flickering, electric, ghostly, cityscape\".<ref name=marqusee206-207>{{harvnb|Marqusee|2005|pp=206\u2013207}}</ref> Dylan describes himself stranded in a fog of detachment which provides a haven, and at the same time is pained by a piercing clarity: an unmediated response that is \"too concise and too clear\". For Marqusee, Dylan describes his predicament, suspended between freedom and slavery, yet hungry for an authentic experience. Johanna and Louise are objects of desire and yearning. \"It is their elusiveness and unreality that's the point.\"<ref name=marqusee206-207/>\n\nGuitarist and critic [[Bill Janovitz]] also emphasizes the urban, unreal quality of \"Visions of Johanna\", calling it a \"sprawling epic\". \"The journey takes Dylan through lofts, the D train, a museum, empty lots, and through snippets of overheard conversation, as well as a discussion with some 'little boy lost', who 'takes himself so seriously', and who is 'so useless and all/muttering small talk at the wall'.\" For Janovitz, this  could \"possibly be a swipe at a critic\".<ref name=\"AllMusicJanovitz\">{{harvnb|Janovitz||}}</ref>\n\nLiterary critic [[Christopher Ricks]], in his study of Dylan's work, pinpoints the emotional effect of these same lines:\n\n::::''He\u2019s sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all''\n::::''Muttering small talk at the wall while I\u2019m in the hall''\n\nRicks writes that the phrase \"and all\" turns a mood of helplessness into a sense of \"aggression and baffled anger\".<ref>{{harvnb|Ricks|2003|pp=487\u2013488}}</ref>\n\nTrying to unravel the mystery of the song, Greil Marcus writes that the song is concerned with internal questions, rather than external ones: \"Line by line, 'Blowin' in the Wind' is pious, or falsely innocent\u2014isn't it obvious that whoever wrote \"Yes, 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail / Before she sleeps in the sand?\" already knows the answer, assuming he, or anyone, can actually bring themselves to care about such a precious question? But 'Visions of Johanna' is asking different sorts of questions. Such as: Where are you? Who are you? What are you doing here?\" Evoking the drugged, urban milieu of the song, Marcus writes of \"People wandering from one corner of a loft to another, doped, drunk, half-awake, fast asleep, no point to the next breath, let alone the next step.\" For Marcus, \"'Visions of Johanna' makes a narrative solely out of atmosphere.\"<ref name = \"Marcus\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe song has been described by several critics as a masterpiece.<ref name = \"Heylin273\"/><ref name=\"Wilentz110\"/><ref name=\"Gill97\"/> In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine placed the song at No.&nbsp;404 on their list of [[the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]],<ref>{{harvnb|500 Greatest Songs of All Time (2004): 401\u2013500}}</ref> commenting that Dylan \"never sounded lonelier than in this seven-minute ballad, cut in a single take on Valentine's Day 1966.\" (When ''Rolling Stone'' updated their list in 2010, the song dropped to No.&nbsp;413.)<ref>{{harvnb|500 Greatest Songs of All Time (2010): #413 \"Visions of Johanna\"}}</ref> In 1999, Britain's Poet Laureate, [[Andrew Motion]], chose it as his candidate for the best song lyric ever written.
