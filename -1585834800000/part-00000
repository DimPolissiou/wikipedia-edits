The word ''risali'' (follower of the message) was inspired by the [[Quran|Quranic]] verse: \"[Allah praises] those who convey the ''messages'' of Allah and fear Him and do not fear anyone but Allah. And sufficient is Allah as Accountant.\" [<nowiki/>[[Al-A\u1e25z\u0101b|33]]:39].\n\nBefore the Iranian revolution, the group remained a secret organisation, working on raising religious awareness, however, after the revolution, in 1979, it went public, calling for [[Islamism]] in the [[Middle East|region]], with different aliases across various countries. In Iraq, it was known as the [[Islamic Action Organisation]]. In Saudi Arabia, it was known as the Islamic Revolution of the Arabian Peninsula. In Bahrain, it was known as the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain and headed by his brother [[Hadi al-Modarresi|Hadi]]. But all these groups were identified as the ''risalis'' in the Islamic world.<ref>{{Cite book|last=al-Lobad|first=Adil|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4E5HAQAAIAAJ&q|title=al-Inqilab, Bay'

some [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] activists to support the movement in their writings, this included Dr. Ahmed al-Abyadh of the [[Renaissance (Tunisia)|Renaissance Organisation]] in [[Tunisia]] and various activists from [[Morocco]].\n\nDespite the ''risali'' term being used in Iraq, it really resonated with many activist groups across the Islamic world, transcending differences and any sectarianism that existed in the region.\n\nMany books were issued to propagate the Risali Movement, some of the ones al-Modarresi wrote included:\n\n*''Fi Suluk al-Risali'' (The Ways of a Risali)\n*''Kayfa Nunami al-Fi'at al-Risaliya'' (How We Develop Risali Factions)\n*''al-Masjid Muntalaq al-Thawra al-Risaliya'' (The Mosque Is The Starting Point of The Risali Revolution)\n*''Khalaya al-Muqawama al-Risaliya''

There is also a large theatre hall outside the buildings, with tiered seating, used for lectures, plays, and functions for religious events.

It began with introducing a mandatory [[Persian language|Farsi]] class of 2.5 hours a day. This then was followed by the introduction of a few other lessons like ''al-A'immah al-Ithna Ashar'' by Adil al-Adib.\n\nIn 1990, the seminary was stormed by 10 armed Iranian soldiers, and they began to arrest whoever was in front of them. However, when they noticed that all of those inside were either in black or white turbans, and since it was close to [[Zuhr prayer|Dhuhr]], they were preparing for prayer, the soldiers were surprised. So they told one of the senior teachers; \"We're confused, we were told to break into this seminary because it was infested with Munafeqi Khalq (derogatory name for [[People's Mujahedin of Iran|Mujahedin Khalq]]), not religious people like yourselves.\" The soldiers then left that evening.\n\nA few days later, the seminary was stormed again, under the command of Shaykh Safarian this time. He ordered everyone to leave the seminary immediately. [[Nimr al-Nimr]] (who was known by his code name - Shaykh Jihad - at the time) protested Safarian's command, and said that they will not move until al-Modarresi is phoned and informed of what was happening. When the news reached al-Modarresi, he ordered that nobody leave, unless an official order is issued by [[Ali Khamenei|Khamenei's]] office. It got rather heated between Nimr and Safarian, until the official order from Khamenei's office came in. However it was in Farsi, to which Nimr protested again, and requested it be in Arabic. After much frustration, the Arabic order came in, ordering the vacant possession of the seminary, and that was the last of the seminary.<ref>{{Cite book|last=al-Lobad|first=Adil|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4E5HAQAAIAAJ&q|title=al-Inqilab, Bay' al-Qiyam 'Alal Thaat|date=|publisher=Laila for Publishing & Distributing|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=339-40|language=Arabic|trans-title=Coups, Selling Morals For Ego}}</ref>\n\n'''- Al-Jaafaria Shia Islamic Centre''' - established in 1991, in [[Kogarah, New South Wales|Kogarah, Sydney]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljaafaria.com.au/about-us/|title=About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=Al-Jaafaria Shia Islamic Centre|language=en-AU|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-15|quote=\"Haj Abu Abdallah Alkazemi\" is Faeq al-Kazemi, al-Modarresi's Kuwaiti brother in law, who founded the centre on at the behest of al-Modarresi}}</ref>\n\n'''- al-Qaim School''' - established in 1995, in [[Sayyidah Zaynab|Sayyidah Zaynab, Damascus]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=al-Salehi|first=Abd al-Husayn|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S2BfNjA0lQ8C&pg=PP200|title=al-Hawzat al-Ilmiyyah Fi al-Aqtar al-Islamiyyah|date=2004|publisher=Hussaini Centre for Research|year=|isbn=978-1-908286-68-0|location=London, UK|pages=198|language=ar|trans-title=The Religious Seminaries in the Islamic Realms}}</ref>\n\n'''- al-Husayniya al-Zaynabiya''' - established in 2002, in Gonbad Sabz, [[Mashhad]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.almodarresi.com Official Website]\n*[http://www.almodarresi.com/english/biography.htm English Biography]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Modarresi, Mohammad Taqi}}\n[[Category:Iraqi ayatollahs]]\n[[Category:People from Karbala]]\n[[Category:1945 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Iraqi people of Iranian descent]]\n[[Category:Iraqi expatriates in Iran]]\n[[Category:Iraqi Shia Muslims]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|an Iraqi [[Marja' (Islamic law)|Grand Ayatollah]]|his [[ayatollah]] brother|Hadi al-Modarresi}}[[Grand Ayatollah]] [[Sayyid]] '''Muhammad-Taqi al-Husayni al-Modarresi''' ({{lang-ar| \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u062a\u0642\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u064a}};

And sufficient is Allah as Accountant.\" [<nowiki/>[[Al-A\u1e25z\u0101b|33]]:39].\n\nBefore the Iranian revolution, the group remained a secret organisation, working on raising religious awareness, however, after the revolution, in 1979, it went public, calling for [[Islamism]] in the [[Middle East|region]], with different aliases across various countries. In Iraq, it was known as the [[Islamic Action Organisation]]. In Saudi Arabia, it was known as the Islamic Revolution of the Arabian Peninsula. In Bahrain, it was known as the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain and headed by his brother [[Hadi al-Modarresi|Hadi]].

The seminary was split into two buildings. The first building was previously a women's society building in the time of the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]]. It then became a seminary for the ladies, and accommodation for married students. The second building was one of [[Farah Pahlavi|Princess Farah's]] palaces. The building had three floors, which later, was split into departments for teaching and research as well as more accommodation. There is also a large theatre hall outside the buildings, with tiered seating, used for lectures, plays, and functions for religious events. Near the theatre hall there is a large kitchen, where food is made and prepared. The seminary's library stands to the right of its entrance.

It began with introducing a mandatory [[Persian language|Farsi]] class of 2.5 hours a day. This then was followed by the introduction of a few other lessons like ''al-A'immah al-Ithna Ashar'' by Adil al-Adib.\n\nIn 1990, the seminary was stormed by 10 armed Iranian soldiers, and they began to arrest whoever was in front of them. However, when they noticed that all of those inside were either in black or white turbans, and since it was close to [[Zuhr prayer|Dhuhr]], they were preparing for prayer, the soldiers were surprised. So they told one of the senior teachers; \"We're confused, we were told to break into this seminary because it was infested with Munafeqi Khalq (derogatory name for [[People's Mujahedin of Iran|Mujahedin Khalq]]), not religious people like yourselves.\" The soldiers then left that evening.\n\nA few days later, the seminary was stormed again, under the command of Shaykh Safarian this time. He ordered everyone to leave the seminary immediately. [[Nimr al-Nimr]] (who was known by his code name - Shaykh Jihad - at the time) protested Safarian's command, and said that they will not move until al-Modarresi is phoned and informed of what was happening. When the news reached al-Modarresi, he ordered that nobody leave, unless an official order is issued by [[Ali Khamenei|Khamenei's]] office.

It serves as the central point for the study of the [[history of baseball in the United States]] and beyond, displays baseball-related artifacts and exhibits, honoring those who have excelled in [[baseball positions|playing]], [[manager (baseball)|managing]], and serving the sport. The Hall's motto is \"Preserving History, Honoring Excellence, Connecting Generations.\" The word '''Cooperstown''' is often used as shorthand (or a [[Metonymy|metonym]]) for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, similar to \"Canton\" for the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in [[Canton, Ohio]].\n\nThe Hall of Fame was established in 1939 by [[Stephen Carlton Clark]], an heir to the [[Singer Sewing Machine Company|Singer Sewing Machine]] fortune. Clark sought to bring tourists to a city hurt by the [[Great Depression]], which reduced the local tourist trade, and [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], which devastated the local [[hops]] industry. Clark constructed the Hall of Fame's building, and it was dedicated on June 12, 1939. (His granddaughter, Jane Forbes Clark, is the current chairman of the Board of Directors.) The [[Doubleday myth|erroneous claim]] that [[American Civil War|Civil War]] hero [[Abner Doubleday]] [[Origins of baseball|invented baseball]] in Cooperstown was instrumental in the early marketing of the Hall.\n\nAn expanded library and research facility opened in 1994.<ref name=\"museum history\">{{cite web|url=https://baseballhall.org/media-info/museum-history|title=Museum History|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame|accessdate=2017-10-21|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704214127/https://baseballhall.org/media-info/museum-history|archivedate=4 July 2017}}</ref> [[Dale Petroskey]] became the organization's president in 1999.<ref name=\"Petrosky presidency\">[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080325&content_id=2458145&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb The Official Site of Major League Baseball: News: HOF president Petroskey resigns] from the [[Major League Baseball]] website</ref> In 2002, the Hall launched ''Baseball As America'', a traveling exhibit that toured ten American museums over six years. The Hall of Fame has since also sponsored educational programming on the Internet to bring the Hall of Fame to schoolchildren who might not visit. The Hall and Museum completed a series of renovations in spring 2005. The Hall of Fame also presents an annual exhibit at FanFest at the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]].\n\n==Inductees==\n{{see also|List of members of the Baseball Hall of Fame}}\nAmong baseball fans, \"Hall of Fame\" means not only the museum and facility in Cooperstown, New York, but the pantheon of players, [[manager (baseball)|managers]], [[umpire (baseball)|umpires]], executives, and pioneers who have been enshrined in the Hall. The first five men elected were [[Ty Cobb]], [[Babe Ruth]], [[Honus Wagner]], [[Christy Mathewson]] and [[Walter Johnson]], chosen in 1936; roughly 20 more were selected before the entire group was inducted at the Hall's 1939 opening. {{As of|2020|1}}, 333 people had been elected to the Hall of Fame, including 234 former [[Major League Baseball]] players, 35 [[Negro league baseball]] players and executives, 23 managers, 10 umpires, and 36 pioneers, executives, and organizers. 114 members of the Hall of Fame have been inducted posthumously, including four who died after their selection was announced.

Five years after retirement, any player with 10 years of major league experience who passes a screening committee (which removes from consideration players of clearly lesser qualification) is eligible to be elected by BBWAA members with 10 years' membership or more who also have been actively covering MLB at any time in the 10 years preceding the election (the latter requirement was added for the 2016 election).<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://baseballhall.org/news/hall-of-fame-announces-change-to-bbwaa-voting-electorate |title=Hall of Fame Announces Change to BBWAA Voting Electorate |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum |date=July 28, 2015 |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref> From a final ballot typically including 25\u201340 candidates, each writer may vote for up to 10 players; until the late 1950s, voters were advised to cast votes for the maximum 10 candidates.

In some instances, the screening committee had restored their names to later ballots, but in the mid-1990s, dropped players were made permanently ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration, even by the Veterans Committee.

All seven were inducted into the Hall of Fame.]]\nUnder special circumstances, certain players may be deemed eligible for induction even though they have not met all requirements. [[Addie Joss]] was elected in 1978, despite only playing nine seasons before he died of meningitis. Additionally, if an otherwise eligible player dies before his fifth year of retirement, then that player may be placed on the ballot at the first election at least six months after his death. [[Roberto Clemente]]'s induction in 1973 set the precedent when the writers chose to put him up for consideration after his death on New Year's Eve, 1972.\n\nThe five-year waiting period was established in 1954 after an evolutionary process. In 1936 all players were eligible, including active ones. From the 1937 election until the 1945 election, there was no waiting period, so any retired player was eligible, but writers were discouraged from voting for current major leaguers. Since there was no formal rule preventing a writer from casting a ballot for an active player, the scribes did not always comply with the informal guideline; [[Joe DiMaggio]] received a vote in 1945, for example. From the 1946 election until the 1954 election, an official one-year waiting period was in effect. (DiMaggio, for example, retired after the 1951 season and was first eligible in the 1953 election.) The modern rule establishing a wait of five years was passed in 1954, although an exception was made for Joe DiMaggio because of his high level of previous support, thus permitting him to be elected within four years of his retirement.\n\n{{Quote box|width=15em|border=3px|align=right|bgcolor=#FAF0E6|qalign=center|title=''Lineup for Yesterday''|quote=''Z is for Zenith''<br />''The summit of fame.''<br />''These men are up there.''<br />''These men are the game.''|source= \u2014 [[Ogden Nash]], [[Sport (US magazine)|''Sport'' magazine]] (January 1949)<ref>{{cite web|title=Baseball Almanac|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_line.shtml|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref> }}\nContrary to popular belief, no formal exception was made for [[Lou Gehrig]] (other than to hold a special one-man election for him): there was no waiting period at that time, and Gehrig met all other qualifications, so he would have been eligible for the next regular election after he retired during the 1939 season. However, the BBWAA decided to hold a special election at the 1939 Winter Meetings in Cincinnati, specifically to elect Gehrig (most likely because it was known that he was [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|terminally ill]], making it uncertain that he would live long enough to see another election). Nobody else was on that ballot, and the numerical results have never been made public. Since no elections were held in 1940 or 1941, the special election permitted Gehrig to enter the Hall while still alive.\n\nIf a player fails to be elected by the BBWAA within 10 years of his retirement from active play, he may be selected by the Veterans Committee. Following changes to the election process for that body made in 2010 and 2016, it is now responsible for electing all otherwise eligible candidates who are not eligible for the BBWAA ballot \u2014 both long-retired players and non-playing personnel (managers, umpires, and executives).

These changes also established three separate committees to select other figures:\n* One committee voted on managers and umpires for induction in every even-numbered year. This committee voted only twice\u2014[[2008 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|in 2007 for induction in 2008]] and [[2010 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|in 2009 for induction in 2010]].\n* One committee voted on executives and builders for induction in every even-numbered year. This committee conducted its only two votes in the same years as the managers/umpires committee.\n* The pre\u2013World War II players committee was intended to vote every five years on players whose careers began in 1942 or earlier. It conducted its only vote as part of the election process [[2009 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|for induction in 2009]].<ref name=\"HoF-VC-1942\">{{cite web|author=National Baseball Hall of Fame|title=Rules for election of pre\u2013World War II players|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame|year=2009|url=http://community.baseballhall.org/Page.aspx?pid=391|accessdate=2009-12-23}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Satchel Paige 1949 Bowman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1971 inductee [[Satchel Paige]]]]\nPlayers of the [[Negro League baseball|Negro Leagues]] have also been considered at various times, beginning in 1971. In 2005, the Hall completed a study on African American players between the late 19th century and the integration of the major leagues in 1947, and conducted a special election for such players in February 2006; seventeen figures from the Negro Leagues were chosen in that election, in addition to the eighteen previously selected. Following the 2010 changes, Negro Leagues figures were primarily considered for induction alongside other figures from the 1871\u20131946 era, called the \"Pre-Integration Era\" by the Hall; since 2016, Negro Leagues figures are primarily considered alongside other figures from what the Hall calls the \"Early Baseball\" era (1871\u20131949).\n\nPredictably, the selection process catalyzes endless debate among baseball fans over the merits of various candidates. Even players elected years ago remain the subjects of discussions as to whether they deserved election. For example, [[Bill James]]' 1994 book ''[[Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?]]'' goes into detail about who he believes does and does not belong in the Hall of Fame.\n\n===Non-induction of banned players===\n[[File:Shoeless Joe Jackson by Conlon, 1913-crop.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Shoeless Joe Jackson|\"Shoeless Joe\" Jackson]] in 1913]]\nFollowing the banning of [[Pete Rose]] from MLB, the selection rules for the Baseball Hall of Fame were modified to prevent the induction of anyone on Baseball's \"permanently ineligible\" list, such as Rose or [[Shoeless Joe Jackson|\"Shoeless Joe\" Jackson]]. Many others have been barred from participation in MLB, but none have Hall of Fame qualifications on the level of Jackson or Rose.\n\nJackson and Rose were both banned from MLB for life for actions related to gambling on their own teams\u2014Jackson was determined to have cooperated with those who conspired to intentionally lose the [[1919 World Series]], and for accepting payment for losing, and Rose voluntarily accepted a permanent spot on the ineligible list in return for MLB's promise to make no official finding in relation to alleged betting on the [[Cincinnati Reds]] when he was their manager in the 1980s. (Baseball's Rule 21, prominently posted in every clubhouse locker room, mandates permanent banishment from the MLB for having a gambling interest of any sort on a game in which a player or manager is directly involved.) Rose later admitted that he bet on the Reds in his [[My Prison Without Bars|2004 autobiography]]. Baseball fans are deeply split on the issue of whether these two should remain banned or have their punishment revoked. Writer [[Bill James]], though he advocates Rose eventually making it into the Hall of Fame, compared the people who want to put Jackson in the Hall of Fame to \"those women who show up at murder trials wanting to marry the cute murderer\".<ref>James (1995:358)</ref>\n\n===Changes to Veterans Committee process===\n{{Main|Veterans Committee}}\nThe actions and composition of the Veterans Committee have been at times controversial, with occasional selections of contemporaries and teammates of the committee members over seemingly more worthy candidates.<ref name=\"NYT-2001ChassReform\">{{cite news|last=Chass|first=Murray|title=More Vets Eligible For Hall In Baseball|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2001-08-07|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E7D71E3CF934A3575BC0A9679C8B63&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name=\"TBT-2001Reform\">{{cite web|last=Enders|first=Eric|title=Same Old Story|publisher=Baseball Think Factory|date=2001-08-08|url=http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org/files/primate_studies/discussion/eric_enders_2001-08-08_0/|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name=\"BP-Traven\">{{cite web|last=Traven |first=Neal |title=A Brief History of the Veterans Committee |publisher=[[Baseball Prospectus]] |date=2003-01-14 |url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/20030114traven.shtml |accessdate=2008-09-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101234319/http://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/20030114traven.shtml |archivedate=1 November 2006 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-1988Leo\">{{cite news|last=Leo|first=John|title=Housecleaning Plan for the Hall of Fame|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1988-01-24|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5DE103DF937A15752C0A96E948260&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name=\"BP-Miller\">{{cite web|last=Jaffe|first=Jay|title=Marvin Miller|work=Prospectus Q&A|publisher=Baseball Prospectus|date=2008-06-02|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=7608|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the Veterans Committee was reformed to comprise the living Hall of Fame members and other honorees.<ref name=\"hof-changes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers_and_honorees/veterans/veterans_changes.htm |title=Changes to Veterans Committee Procedures |accessdate=2007-01-06 |work=baseballhalloffame.org |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929063713/http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers_and_honorees/veterans/veterans_changes.htm |archivedate=2006-09-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The revamped Committee held three elections, in [[2003 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2003]] and [[2007 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2007]], for both players and non-players, and in [[2005 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2005]] for players only. No individual was elected in that time, sparking criticism among some observers who expressed doubt whether the new Veterans Committee would ever elect a player. The Committee members, most of whom were Hall members, were accused of being reluctant to elect new candidates in the hope of heightening the value of their own selection. After no one was selected for the third consecutive election in 2007, Hall of Famer [[Mike Schmidt]] noted, \"The same thing happens every year. The current members want to preserve the prestige as much as possible, and are unwilling to open the doors.\"<ref name=\"Walker\"/> In 2007, the committee and its selection processes were again reorganized; the main committee then included all living members of the Hall, and voted on a reduced number of candidates from among players whose careers began in 1943 or later. Separate committees, including sportswriters and broadcasters, would select umpires, managers and executives, as well as players from earlier eras.\n\nIn the first election to be held under the 2007 revisions, two managers and three executives were elected in December 2007 as part of the [[2008 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2008 election process]]. The next Veterans Committee elections for players were held in December 2008 as part of the [[2009 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2009 election process]]; the main committee did not select a player, while the panel for pre\u2013World War II players elected [[Joe Gordon]] in its first and ultimately only vote. The main committee voted as part of the election process for inductions in odd-numbered years, while the pre-World War II panel would vote every five years, and the panel for umpires, managers, and executives voted as part of the election process for inductions in even-numbered years.\n\nFurther changes to the Veterans Committee process were announced by the Hall on July 26, 2010, effective with the [[2011 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2011 election]].<ref name=\"2010 changes\"/>\n\nAll individuals eligible for induction but not eligible for BBWAA consideration were considered on a single ballot, grouped by the following eras in which they made their greatest contributions:\n* Pre-Integration Era (1871\u20131946)\n* Golden Era (1947\u20131972)\n* Expansion Era (1973 and later)\n\nThe Hall used the BBWAA's Historical Overview Committee to formulate the ballots for each era, consisting of 12 individuals for the Expansion Era and 10 for the other eras. The Hall's board of directors selected a committee of 16 voters for each era, made up of Hall of Famers, executives, baseball historians, and media members. Each committee met and voted at the Baseball Winter Meetings once every three years. The Expansion Era committee held its first vote in 2010 for 2011 induction, with longtime [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Pat Gillick]] becoming the first individual elected under the new procedure. The [[Golden Era Veterans Committee|Golden Era committee]] voted in 2011 for the induction class of 2012, with [[Ron Santo]] becoming the first player elected under the new procedure. The Pre-Integration Era committee voted in 2012 for the induction class of 2013, electing three figures. Subsequent elections rotated among the three committees in that order through the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2011|2016 election]].\n\nIn July 2016, however, the Hall of Fame announced a restructuring of the timeframes to be considered, with a much greater emphasis on modern eras. Four new committees were established:\n* Today's Game (1988\u2013present)\n* Modern Baseball (1970\u20131987)\n* Golden Days (1950\u20131969)\n* Early Baseball (1871\u20131949)\n\nAll committees' ballots now include 10 candidates. At least one committee convenes each December as part of the election process for the following calendar year's induction ceremony. The Early Baseball committee convenes only in years ending in 0 (2020, 2030). The Golden Days committee convenes only in years ending in 0 and 5 (2020, 2025). The remaining two committees convene twice every 5 years. More specifically, the Today's Game and Modern Baseball committees alternate their meetings in that order, skipping years in which either the Early Baseball or Golden Days committee meets. This means that the Today's Game committee (having first met in 2016) will meet in 2021, 2023 and 2026, while the Modern Baseball committee (which first met in 2017) will meet in 2019, 2022 and 2024.\n\nThe eligibility criteria for Era Committee consideration differ between players, managers, and executives.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/rules/eras-committees |title=Era Rules for Election |work=Eras Committees |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum |accessdate=July 31, 2018}}</ref>\n* Players: When a player is no longer eligible on the BBWAA ballot (either 15 years after retirement\u2014five-year period and the 10 years after he first becomes eligible to appear on the BBWAA ballot or when the player is not eligible after earning less than five percent of the BBWAA ballot during a year), he will be considered by the respective committee.\n** The Hall has not yet established a policy on when players who die while active or during the standard 5-year waiting period for BBWAA eligibility will be eligible for committee consideration. As noted earlier, such players become eligible for the BBWAA ballot 6 months after their deaths.\n* Managers and umpires who have served at least 10 seasons in that role are eligible 5 years after retirement, unless they are 65 or older, in which case the waiting period is 6 months.\n* Executives are eligible 5 years after retirement, or upon reaching age 70. For those who meet the age cutoff, they are explicitly eligible for consideration regardless of their current position in an organization or their status as active or retired. Before the 2016 changes to the committee system, active executives 65 years or older were eligible for consideration.<ref name=\"2016 changes\"/>\n\n===Players and managers with multiple teams===\nWhile the text on a player's or manager's plaque lists all teams for which the inductee was a member in that specific role, inductees are usually depicted wearing the cap of a specific team, though in a few cases, like umpires, they wear caps without logos. (Executives are not depicted wearing caps.) Additionally, as of 2015, inductee biographies on the Hall's website for all players and managers, and executives who were associated with specific teams, list a \"primary team\", which does not necessarily match the cap logo. The Hall selects the logo \"based on where that player makes his most indelible mark.\"<ref name=\"FAQ-logoSelection\">{{cite web|title=Who decides what team logo will be used on Hall of Fame plaques?|work=Hall of Famers: FAQ|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc.|year=2009|url=http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/faq.jsp#logo|accessdate=2009-07-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213123303/http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/faq.jsp|archivedate=2009-02-13}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Frank Robinson 1961.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Frank Robinson]] with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in 1961]]\n[[File:Carlton Fisk 1976.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Carlton Fisk]] with the [[Boston Red Sox]] in 1976]]\n[[File:Dave Winfield - San Diego Padres.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Dave Winfield]] with the [[San Diego Padres]] c.1977]]\nAlthough the Hall always made the final decision on which logo was shown, until 2001 the Hall deferred to the wishes of players or managers whose careers were linked with multiple teams. Some examples of inductees associated with multiple teams are the following:\n*'''[[Frank Robinson]]''': Robinson chose to have the [[Baltimore Orioles]] cap displayed on his plaque, although he had played ten seasons with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] and six seasons with Baltimore. Robinson won four pennants and two World Series with the Orioles and one pennant with Cincinnati. His second [[World Series ring]] came in the [[1970 World Series]] against the Reds. Robinson also won an [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] award while playing for each team.\n*'''[[Catfish Hunter]]''': Hunter chose not to have any logo on his cap when elected to the Hall of Fame in 1987. Hunter had success for both teams for which he played &ndash; the [[Oakland Athletics|Kansas City/Oakland Athletics]] (his first ten seasons) and the [[New York Yankees]] (his final five seasons). Furthermore, both during and after his career he maintained good relations with both teams and their respective owners ([[Charlie Finley|Charles Finley]] and [[George Steinbrenner]]), and did not wish to slight either team by selecting the other.\n*'''[[Nolan Ryan]]''': Born and raised in Texas, Ryan entered the Hall in 1999 wearing a [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] cap on his plaque, although he spent only five seasons with the Rangers, while raised in the Houston area and having longer and more successful tenures with the [[Houston Astros]] (nine seasons, 1980\u201388 and his record-setting fifth career no-hitter) and [[California Angels]] (eight seasons, 1972\u201379 and the first four of his seven career no-hitters). Ryan's only championship was as a member of the [[New York Mets]] in [[1969 World Series|1969]]. Ryan finished his career with the Rangers, reaching his 5,000th strikeout and 300th win, and throwing the last two of his no-hitters. Ryan later took ownership of the Rangers when they were sold to his Rangers Baseball Express group in 2010. He sold his Rangers interest in 2013 and is now in the Astros' front office.\n*'''[[Reggie Jackson]]''': Jackson chose to be depicted with a Yankees cap over an Athletics cap. As a member of the Kansas City/Oakland A's, Jackson played ten seasons (1967\u201375, '87), winning three World Series ([[1972 World Series|1972]], [[1973 World Series|1973]], [[1974 World Series|1974]]) and the 1973 [[AL MVP|AL MVP Award]]. During his five years in New York (1977\u201381), Jackson won two World Series ([[1977 World Series|1977]]\u2013[[1978 World Series|78]]), with his crowning achievement occurring during [[1977 World Series#Game 6|Game Six of the 1977 World Series]], when he hit three home runs on consecutive pitches and earned his nickname \"Mr. October\".\n*'''[[Carlton Fisk]]''': Fisk went into the hall with a [[Boston Red Sox]] cap on his plaque in 2000 despite playing with the [[Chicago White Sox]] longer and posting more significant numbers with the White Sox. Fisk's choice of the Red Sox was likely because of his being a [[New England]] native, as well as his famous \"Stay fair!\" walk-off home run in [[1975 World Series#Game 6|Game Six of the 1975 World Series]] with which he is most associated.\n*'''[[Sparky Anderson]]''': Also in 2000, Anderson entered the Hall with a Cincinnati Reds cap on his plaque despite managing almost twice as many seasons with the [[Detroit Tigers]] (17 in Detroit; nine in Cincinnati). He chose the Reds to honor that team's former general manager [[Bob Howsam]], who gave him his first major-league managing job. Anderson won two World Series with the Reds and one with the Tigers.\n*'''[[Dave Winfield]]''': Winfield had spent the most years in his career with the Yankees and had great success there, but chose to go into the Hall as a member of the [[San Diego Padres]] due to his feud with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.\n\nIn all of the above cases, the \"primary team\" is the team for which the inductee spent the largest portion of his career except for Ryan, whose primary team is listed as the Angels despite playing one fewer season for that team than for the Astros.\n\nIn 2001, the Hall of Fame decided to change the policy on cap logo selection, as a result of rumors that some teams were offering compensation, such as number retirement, money, or organizational jobs, in exchange for the cap designation. (For example, though [[Wade Boggs]] denied the claims, some media reports had said that his contract with the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] required him to request depiction in the Hall of Fame as a Devil Ray.)<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/hallfame/2005-01-06-boggs-sandberg-questions_x.htm|title=Boggs, Sandberg field queries as new Hall of Famers|accessdate=2008-05-21|work=USA Today|first1=Craig|last1=Muder|date=2005-01-06}}</ref> The Hall decided that it would no longer defer to the inductee, though the player's wishes would be considered, when deciding on the logo to appear on the plaque. Newly elected members affected by the change include the following:\n*'''[[Gary Carter]]''': Inducted in 2003, Carter was the first player to be affected by the new policy.

The 22 fields at Dreams Park currently draw 17,000 players each summer for a week of intensive play; while the complex includes housing for the players, their parents and grandparents must stay elsewhere.

It features environmental video walls and new interactive elements to go along with artifacts from the Museum's collection.\n* The '''Today's Game''' exhibit is built like a baseball clubhouse, with 30 glass-enclosed locker stalls, one for each Major League franchise. In each stall there is a jersey and other items from the designated big league team, along with a brief team history. A center display case holds objects donated to the Hall of Fame from the past year or two. Fans can also look into a room designed to look like a manager's office. Outside is a display case with rotating artifacts.

It serves as the central point for the study of the [[history of baseball in the United States]] and beyond, displays baseball-related artifacts and exhibits, honoring those who have excelled in [[baseball positions|playing]], [[manager (baseball)|managing]], and serving the sport. The Hall's motto is \"Preserving History, Honoring Excellence, Connecting Generations.\" The word '''Cooperstown''' is often used as shorthand (or a [[Metonymy|metonym]]) for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, similar to \"Canton\" for the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in [[Canton, Ohio]].\n\nThe Hall of Fame was established in 1939 by [[Stephen Carlton Clark]], an heir to the [[Singer Sewing Machine Company|Singer Sewing Machine]] fortune. Clark sought to bring tourists to a city hurt by the [[Great Depression]], which reduced the local tourist trade, and [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], which devastated the local [[hops]] industry. Clark constructed the Hall of Fame's building, and it was dedicated on June 12, 1939. (His granddaughter, Jane Forbes Clark, is the current chairman of the Board of Directors.) The [[Doubleday myth|erroneous claim]] that [[American Civil War|Civil War]] hero [[Abner Doubleday]] [[Origins of baseball|invented baseball]] in Cooperstown was instrumental in the early marketing of the Hall.\n\nAn expanded library and research facility opened in 1994.<ref name=\"museum history\">{{cite web|url=https://baseballhall.org/media-info/museum-history|title=Museum History|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame|accessdate=2017-10-21|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704214127/https://baseballhall.org/media-info/museum-history|archivedate=4 July 2017}}</ref> [[Dale Petroskey]] became the organization's president in 1999.<ref name=\"Petrosky presidency\">[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080325&content_id=2458145&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb The Official Site of Major League Baseball: News: HOF president Petroskey resigns] from the [[Major League Baseball]] website</ref> In 2002, the Hall launched ''Baseball As America'', a traveling exhibit that toured ten American museums over six years. The Hall of Fame has since also sponsored educational programming on the Internet to bring the Hall of Fame to schoolchildren who might not visit. The Hall and Museum completed a series of renovations in spring 2005. The Hall of Fame also presents an annual exhibit at FanFest at the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]].\n\n==Inductees==\n{{see also|List of members of the Baseball Hall of Fame}}\nAmong baseball fans, \"Hall of Fame\" means not only the museum and facility in Cooperstown, New York, but the pantheon of players, [[manager (baseball)|managers]], [[umpire (baseball)|umpires]], executives, and pioneers who have been enshrined in the Hall. The first five men elected were [[Ty Cobb]], [[Babe Ruth]], [[Honus Wagner]], [[Christy Mathewson]] and [[Walter Johnson]], chosen in 1936; roughly 20 more were selected before the entire group was inducted at the Hall's 1939 opening. {{As of|2020|1}}, 333 people had been elected to the Hall of Fame, including 234 former [[Major League Baseball]] players, 35 [[Negro league baseball]] players and executives, 23 managers, 10 umpires, and 36 pioneers, executives, and organizers. 114 members of the Hall of Fame have been inducted posthumously, including four who died after their selection was announced. Of the 35 Negro league members, 29 were inducted posthumously, including all 24 selected since the 1990s.

Five years after retirement, any player with 10 years of major league experience who passes a screening committee (which removes from consideration players of clearly lesser qualification) is eligible to be elected by BBWAA members with 10 years' membership or more who also have been actively covering MLB at any time in the 10 years preceding the election (the latter requirement was added for the 2016 election).<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://baseballhall.org/news/hall-of-fame-announces-change-to-bbwaa-voting-electorate |title=Hall of Fame Announces Change to BBWAA Voting Electorate |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum |date=July 28, 2015 |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref> From a final ballot typically including 25\u201340 candidates, each writer may vote for up to 10 players; until the late 1950s, voters were advised to cast votes for the maximum 10 candidates.

In some instances, the screening committee had restored their names to later ballots, but in the mid-1990s, dropped players were made permanently ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration, even by the Veterans Committee.

All seven were inducted into the Hall of Fame.]]\nUnder special circumstances, certain players may be deemed eligible for induction even though they have not met all requirements. [[Addie Joss]] was elected in 1978, despite only playing nine seasons before he died of meningitis. Additionally, if an otherwise eligible player dies before his fifth year of retirement, then that player may be placed on the ballot at the first election at least six months after his death. [[Roberto Clemente]]'s induction in 1973 set the precedent when the writers chose to put him up for consideration after his death on New Year's Eve, 1972.\n\nThe five-year waiting period was established in 1954 after an evolutionary process. In 1936 all players were eligible, including active ones. From the 1937 election until the 1945 election, there was no waiting period, so any retired player was eligible, but writers were discouraged from voting for current major leaguers. Since there was no formal rule preventing a writer from casting a ballot for an active player, the scribes did not always comply with the informal guideline; [[Joe DiMaggio]] received a vote in 1945, for example. From the 1946 election until the 1954 election, an official one-year waiting period was in effect. (DiMaggio, for example, retired after the 1951 season and was first eligible in the 1953 election.) The modern rule establishing a wait of five years was passed in 1954, although an exception was made for Joe DiMaggio because of his high level of previous support, thus permitting him to be elected within four years of his retirement.\n\n{{Quote box|width=15em|border=3px|align=right|bgcolor=#FAF0E6|qalign=center|title=''Lineup for Yesterday''|quote=''Z is for Zenith''<br />''The summit of fame.''<br />''These men are up there.''<br />''These men are the game.''|source= \u2014 [[Ogden Nash]], [[Sport (US magazine)|''Sport'' magazine]] (January 1949)<ref>{{cite web|title=Baseball Almanac|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_line.shtml|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref> }}\nContrary to popular belief, no formal exception was made for [[Lou Gehrig]] (other than to hold a special one-man election for him): there was no waiting period at that time, and Gehrig met all other qualifications, so he would have been eligible for the next regular election after he retired during the 1939 season. However, the BBWAA decided to hold a special election at the 1939 Winter Meetings in Cincinnati, specifically to elect Gehrig (most likely because it was known that he was [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|terminally ill]], making it uncertain that he would live long enough to see another election). Nobody else was on that ballot, and the numerical results have never been made public. Since no elections were held in 1940 or 1941, the special election permitted Gehrig to enter the Hall while still alive.\n\nIf a player fails to be elected by the BBWAA within 10 years of his retirement from active play, he may be selected by the Veterans Committee. Following changes to the election process for that body made in 2010 and 2016, it is now responsible for electing all otherwise eligible candidates who are not eligible for the BBWAA ballot \u2014 both long-retired players and non-playing personnel (managers, umpires, and executives).

These changes also established three separate committees to select other figures:\n* One committee voted on managers and umpires for induction in every even-numbered year. This committee voted only twice\u2014[[2008 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|in 2007 for induction in 2008]] and [[2010 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|in 2009 for induction in 2010]].\n* One committee voted on executives and builders for induction in every even-numbered year. This committee conducted its only two votes in the same years as the managers/umpires committee.\n* The pre\u2013World War II players committee was intended to vote every five years on players whose careers began in 1942 or earlier. It conducted its only vote as part of the election process [[2009 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|for induction in 2009]].<ref name=\"HoF-VC-1942\">{{cite web|author=National Baseball Hall of Fame|title=Rules for election of pre\u2013World War II players|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame|year=2009|url=http://community.baseballhall.org/Page.aspx?pid=391|accessdate=2009-12-23}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Satchel Paige 1949 Bowman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1971 inductee [[Satchel Paige]]]]\nPlayers of the [[Negro League baseball|Negro Leagues]] have also been considered at various times, beginning in 1971. In 2005, the Hall completed a study on African American players between the late 19th century and the integration of the major leagues in 1947, and conducted a special election for such players in February 2006; seventeen figures from the Negro Leagues were chosen in that election, in addition to the eighteen previously selected. Following the 2010 changes, Negro Leagues figures were primarily considered for induction alongside other figures from the 1871\u20131946 era, called the \"Pre-Integration Era\" by the Hall; since 2016, Negro Leagues figures are primarily considered alongside other figures from what the Hall calls the \"Early Baseball\" era (1871\u20131949).\n\nPredictably, the selection process catalyzes endless debate among baseball fans over the merits of various candidates. Even players elected years ago remain the subjects of discussions as to whether they deserved election. For example, [[Bill James]]' 1994 book ''[[Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?]]'' goes into detail about who he believes does and does not belong in the Hall of Fame.\n\n===Non-induction of banned players===\n[[File:Shoeless Joe Jackson by Conlon, 1913-crop.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Shoeless Joe Jackson|\"Shoeless Joe\" Jackson]] in 1913]]\nFollowing the banning of [[Pete Rose]] from MLB, the selection rules for the Baseball Hall of Fame were modified to prevent the induction of anyone on Baseball's \"permanently ineligible\" list, such as Rose or [[Shoeless Joe Jackson|\"Shoeless Joe\" Jackson]]. Many others have been barred from participation in MLB, but none have Hall of Fame qualifications on the level of Jackson or Rose.\n\nJackson and Rose were both banned from MLB for life for actions related to gambling on their own teams\u2014Jackson was determined to have cooperated with those who conspired to intentionally lose the [[1919 World Series]], and for accepting payment for losing, and Rose voluntarily accepted a permanent spot on the ineligible list in return for MLB's promise to make no official finding in relation to alleged betting on the [[Cincinnati Reds]] when he was their manager in the 1980s. (Baseball's Rule 21, prominently posted in every clubhouse locker room, mandates permanent banishment from the MLB for having a gambling interest of any sort on a game in which a player or manager is directly involved.) Rose later admitted that he bet on the Reds in his [[My Prison Without Bars|2004 autobiography]]. Baseball fans are deeply split on the issue of whether these two should remain banned or have their punishment revoked. Writer [[Bill James]], though he advocates Rose eventually making it into the Hall of Fame, compared the people who want to put Jackson in the Hall of Fame to \"those women who show up at murder trials wanting to marry the cute murderer\".<ref>James (1995:358)</ref>\n\n===Changes to Veterans Committee process===\n{{Main|Veterans Committee}}\nThe actions and composition of the Veterans Committee have been at times controversial, with occasional selections of contemporaries and teammates of the committee members over seemingly more worthy candidates.<ref name=\"NYT-2001ChassReform\">{{cite news|last=Chass|first=Murray|title=More Vets Eligible For Hall In Baseball|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2001-08-07|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E7D71E3CF934A3575BC0A9679C8B63&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name=\"TBT-2001Reform\">{{cite web|last=Enders|first=Eric|title=Same Old Story|publisher=Baseball Think Factory|date=2001-08-08|url=http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org/files/primate_studies/discussion/eric_enders_2001-08-08_0/|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name=\"BP-Traven\">{{cite web|last=Traven |first=Neal |title=A Brief History of the Veterans Committee |publisher=[[Baseball Prospectus]] |date=2003-01-14 |url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/20030114traven.shtml |accessdate=2008-09-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101234319/http://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/20030114traven.shtml |archivedate=1 November 2006 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-1988Leo\">{{cite news|last=Leo|first=John|title=Housecleaning Plan for the Hall of Fame|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1988-01-24|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5DE103DF937A15752C0A96E948260&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name=\"BP-Miller\">{{cite web|last=Jaffe|first=Jay|title=Marvin Miller|work=Prospectus Q&A|publisher=Baseball Prospectus|date=2008-06-02|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=7608|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the Veterans Committee was reformed to comprise the living Hall of Fame members and other honorees.<ref name=\"hof-changes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers_and_honorees/veterans/veterans_changes.htm |title=Changes to Veterans Committee Procedures |accessdate=2007-01-06 |work=baseballhalloffame.org |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929063713/http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers_and_honorees/veterans/veterans_changes.htm |archivedate=2006-09-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The revamped Committee held three elections, in [[2003 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2003]] and [[2007 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2007]], for both players and non-players, and in [[2005 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2005]] for players only. No individual was elected in that time, sparking criticism among some observers who expressed doubt whether the new Veterans Committee would ever elect a player. The Committee members, most of whom were Hall members, were accused of being reluctant to elect new candidates in the hope of heightening the value of their own selection. After no one was selected for the third consecutive election in 2007, Hall of Famer [[Mike Schmidt]] noted, \"The same thing happens every year. The current members want to preserve the prestige as much as possible, and are unwilling to open the doors.\"<ref name=\"Walker\"/> In 2007, the committee and its selection processes were again reorganized; the main committee then included all living members of the Hall, and voted on a reduced number of candidates from among players whose careers began in 1943 or later. Separate committees, including sportswriters and broadcasters, would select umpires, managers and executives, as well as players from earlier eras.\n\nIn the first election to be held under the 2007 revisions, two managers and three executives were elected in December 2007 as part of the [[2008 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2008 election process]]. The next Veterans Committee elections for players were held in December 2008 as part of the [[2009 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2009 election process]]; the main committee did not select a player, while the panel for pre\u2013World War II players elected [[Joe Gordon]] in its first and ultimately only vote. The main committee voted as part of the election process for inductions in odd-numbered years, while the pre-World War II panel would vote every five years, and the panel for umpires, managers, and executives voted as part of the election process for inductions in even-numbered years.\n\nFurther changes to the Veterans Committee process were announced by the Hall on July 26, 2010, effective with the [[2011 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2011 election]].<ref name=\"2010 changes\"/>\n\nAll individuals eligible for induction but not eligible for BBWAA consideration were considered on a single ballot, grouped by the following eras in which they made their greatest contributions:\n* Pre-Integration Era (1871\u20131946)\n* Golden Era (1947\u20131972)\n* Expansion Era (1973 and later)\n\nThe Hall used the BBWAA's Historical Overview Committee to formulate the ballots for each era, consisting of 12 individuals for the Expansion Era and 10 for the other eras. The Hall's board of directors selected a committee of 16 voters for each era, made up of Hall of Famers, executives, baseball historians, and media members. Each committee met and voted at the Baseball Winter Meetings once every three years. The Expansion Era committee held its first vote in 2010 for 2011 induction, with longtime [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Pat Gillick]] becoming the first individual elected under the new procedure. The [[Golden Era Veterans Committee|Golden Era committee]] voted in 2011 for the induction class of 2012, with [[Ron Santo]] becoming the first player elected under the new procedure. The Pre-Integration Era committee voted in 2012 for the induction class of 2013, electing three figures. Subsequent elections rotated among the three committees in that order through the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2011|2016 election]].\n\nIn July 2016, however, the Hall of Fame announced a restructuring of the timeframes to be considered, with a much greater emphasis on modern eras. Four new committees were established:\n* Today's Game (1988\u2013present)\n* Modern Baseball (1970\u20131987)\n* Golden Days (1950\u20131969)\n* Early Baseball (1871\u20131949)\n\nAll committees' ballots now include 10 candidates. At least one committee convenes each December as part of the election process for the following calendar year's induction ceremony. The Early Baseball committee convenes only in years ending in 0 (2020, 2030). The Golden Days committee convenes only in years ending in 0 and 5 (2020, 2025). The remaining two committees convene twice every 5 years. More specifically, the Today's Game and Modern Baseball committees alternate their meetings in that order, skipping years in which either the Early Baseball or Golden Days committee meets. This means that the Today's Game committee (having first met in 2016) will meet in 2021, 2023 and 2026, while the Modern Baseball committee (which first met in 2017) will meet in 2019, 2022 and 2024.\n\nThe eligibility criteria for Era Committee consideration differ between players, managers, and executives.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/rules/eras-committees |title=Era Rules for Election |work=Eras Committees |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum |accessdate=July 31, 2018}}</ref>\n* Players: When a player is no longer eligible on the BBWAA ballot (either 15 years after retirement\u2014five-year period and the 10 years after he first becomes eligible to appear on the BBWAA ballot or when the player is not eligible after earning less than five percent of the BBWAA ballot during a year), he will be considered by the respective committee.\n** The Hall has not yet established a policy on when players who die while active or during the standard 5-year waiting period for BBWAA eligibility will be eligible for committee consideration. As noted earlier, such players become eligible for the BBWAA ballot 6 months after their deaths.\n* Managers and umpires who have served at least 10 seasons in that role are eligible 5 years after retirement, unless they are 65 or older, in which case the waiting period is 6 months.\n* Executives are eligible 5 years after retirement, or upon reaching age 70. For those who meet the age cutoff, they are explicitly eligible for consideration regardless of their current position in an organization or their status as active or retired. Before the 2016 changes to the committee system, active executives 65 years or older were eligible for consideration.<ref name=\"2016 changes\"/>\n\n===Players and managers with multiple teams===\nWhile the text on a player's or manager's plaque lists all teams for which the inductee was a member in that specific role, inductees are usually depicted wearing the cap of a specific team, though in a few cases, like umpires, they wear caps without logos. (Executives are not depicted wearing caps.) Additionally, as of 2015, inductee biographies on the Hall's website for all players and managers, and executives who were associated with specific teams, list a \"primary team\", which does not necessarily match the cap logo. The Hall selects the logo \"based on where that player makes his most indelible mark.\"<ref name=\"FAQ-logoSelection\">{{cite web|title=Who decides what team logo will be used on Hall of Fame plaques?|work=Hall of Famers: FAQ|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc.|year=2009|url=http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/faq.jsp#logo|accessdate=2009-07-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213123303/http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/faq.jsp|archivedate=2009-02-13}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Frank Robinson 1961.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Frank Robinson]] with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in 1961]]\n[[File:Carlton Fisk 1976.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Carlton Fisk]] with the [[Boston Red Sox]] in 1976]]\n[[File:Dave Winfield - San Diego Padres.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Dave Winfield]] with the [[San Diego Padres]] c.1977]]\nAlthough the Hall always made the final decision on which logo was shown, until 2001 the Hall deferred to the wishes of players or managers whose careers were linked with multiple teams. Some examples of inductees associated with multiple teams are the following:\n*'''[[Frank Robinson]]''': Robinson chose to have the [[Baltimore Orioles]] cap displayed on his plaque, although he had played ten seasons with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] and six seasons with Baltimore. Robinson won four pennants and two World Series with the Orioles and one pennant with Cincinnati. His second [[World Series ring]] came in the [[1970 World Series]] against the Reds. Robinson also won an [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] award while playing for each team.\n*'''[[Catfish Hunter]]''': Hunter chose not to have any logo on his cap when elected to the Hall of Fame in 1987. Hunter had success for both teams for which he played &ndash; the [[Oakland Athletics|Kansas City/Oakland Athletics]] (his first ten seasons) and the [[New York Yankees]] (his final five seasons). Furthermore, both during and after his career he maintained good relations with both teams and their respective owners ([[Charlie Finley|Charles Finley]] and [[George Steinbrenner]]), and did not wish to slight either team by selecting the other.\n*'''[[Nolan Ryan]]''': Born and raised in Texas, Ryan entered the Hall in 1999 wearing a [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] cap on his plaque, although he spent only five seasons with the Rangers, while raised in the Houston area and having longer and more successful tenures with the [[Houston Astros]] (nine seasons, 1980\u201388 and his record-setting fifth career no-hitter) and [[California Angels]] (eight seasons, 1972\u201379 and the first four of his seven career no-hitters). Ryan's only championship was as a member of the [[New York Mets]] in [[1969 World Series|1969]]. Ryan finished his career with the Rangers, reaching his 5000th strikeout and 300th win, and throwing the last two of his no-hitters. Ryan later took ownership of the Rangers when they were sold to his Rangers Baseball Express group in 2010. He sold his Rangers interest in 2013 and is now in the Astros' front office.\n*'''[[Reggie Jackson]]''': Jackson chose to be depicted with a Yankees cap over an Athletics cap. As a member of the Kansas City/Oakland A's, Jackson played ten seasons (1967\u201375, '87), winning three World Series ([[1972 World Series|1972]], [[1973 World Series|1973]], [[1974 World Series|1974]]) and the 1973 [[AL MVP|AL MVP Award]]. During his five years in New York (1977\u201381), Jackson won two World Series ([[1977 World Series|1977]]\u2013[[1978 World Series|78]]), with his crowning achievement occurring during [[1977 World Series#Game 6|Game Six of the 1977 World Series]], when he hit three home runs on consecutive pitches and earned his nickname \"Mr. October\".\n*'''[[Carlton Fisk]]''': Fisk went into the hall with a [[Boston Red Sox]] cap on his plaque in 2000 despite playing with the [[Chicago White Sox]] longer and posting more significant numbers with the White Sox. Fisk's choice of the Red Sox was likely because of his being a [[New England]] native, as well as his famous \"Stay fair!\" walk-off home run in [[1975 World Series#Game 6|Game Six of the 1975 World Series]] with which he is most associated.\n*'''[[Sparky Anderson]]''': Also in 2000, Anderson entered the Hall with a Cincinnati Reds cap on his plaque despite managing almost twice as many seasons with the [[Detroit Tigers]] (17 in Detroit; nine in Cincinnati). He chose the Reds to honor that team's former general manager [[Bob Howsam]], who gave him his first major-league managing job. Anderson won two World Series with the Reds and one with the Tigers.\n*'''[[Dave Winfield]]''': Winfield had spent the most years in his career with the Yankees and had great success there, but chose to go into the Hall as a member of the [[San Diego Padres]] due to his feud with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.\n\nIn all of the above cases, the \"primary team\" is the team for which the inductee spent the largest portion of his career except for Ryan, whose primary team is listed as the Angels despite playing one fewer season for that team than for the Astros.\n\nIn 2001, the Hall of Fame decided to change the policy on cap logo selection, as a result of rumors that some teams were offering compensation, such as number retirement, money, or organizational jobs, in exchange for the cap designation. (For example, though [[Wade Boggs]] denied the claims, some media reports had said that his contract with the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] required him to request depiction in the Hall of Fame as a Devil Ray.)<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/hallfame/2005-01-06-boggs-sandberg-questions_x.htm|title=Boggs, Sandberg field queries as new Hall of Famers|accessdate=2008-05-21|work=USA Today|first1=Craig|last1=Muder|date=2005-01-06}}</ref> The Hall decided that it would no longer defer to the inductee, though the player's wishes would be considered, when deciding on the logo to appear on the plaque. Newly elected members affected by the change include the following:\n*'''[[Gary Carter]]''': Inducted in 2003, Carter was the first player to be affected by the new policy. Carter won his only championship with the [[1986 World Series|1986]] New York Mets, and wanted his induction plaque to depict him wearing a Mets cap, though he had spent twelve years (1974\u201384, 1992) with the [[Montreal Expos]] and five (1985\u201389) with the Mets.

His greatest successes were with the A's (three pennants and a World Series title in 10 years) and Cardinals (three pennants and two World Series in 16 years).

Maddux believed that both fanbases were equally important in his career, and so the cap on his plaque does not feature any logo.<ref name=\"HoF2014-cap\"/> His biography on the Hall's website lists his primary team as the Braves.\n*'''[[Randy Johnson]]''': Johnson played for six teams in a 22-year career, but spent the bulk of it with the Seattle Mariners (10 seasons) and Arizona Diamondbacks (8 seasons). While enjoying great success with both teams, he had more significant honors with the Diamondbacks. Four of Johnson's five Cy Young Awards (consecutively from 1999 to 2002), his only title (in [[2001 World Series|2001]]), his pitching triple crown ({{mlby|2002}}), and [[Randy Johnson's perfect game|his perfect game]] ({{mlby|2004}}) all came with Arizona.

A 2013 story on ''[[ESPN.com]]'' about the village of Cooperstown and its relation to the game partially linked the reduced attendance with Cooperstown Dreams Park, a youth baseball complex about {{convert|5|mi|km}} away in the town of [[Hartwick, New York|Hartwick]]. The 22 fields at Dreams Park currently draw 17,000 players each summer for a week of intensive play; while the complex includes housing for the players, their parents and grandparents must stay elsewhere.

Now, that room will be taken by just one family for the week, and that family may only go into Cooperstown and the Hall of Fame once. While there are other contributing factors (the [[Great Recession|recession]] and high gas prices among them), the Hall's attendance has tumbled since Dreams Park opened.

It is where the most artifacts are displayed. The Game is set up in a timeline format, starting with baseball's beginnings and culminating with the game we know today. There are several offshoots of this meandering timeline:\n** The '''[[Babe Ruth]] Room'''\n** '''Diamond Dreams''' (women in baseball)\n** '''\u00a1Viva Baseball!''' (a bilingual exhibit, in English and Spanish, that celebrates baseball in Latin America)\n** '''Pride and Passion''' ([[Negro Leagues]] exhibit)\n** '''Taking The Field''' (19th century baseball)\n* '''Whole New Ballgame''', the Museum's newest permanent exhibit, opened in 2015 and is located in the Janetschek Gallery. This exhibit completes the timeline of baseball through the last 45 years into the game we know today. It features environmental video walls and new interactive elements to go along with artifacts from the Museum's collection.\n* The '''Today's Game''' exhibit is built like a baseball clubhouse, with 30 glass-enclosed locker stalls, one for each Major League franchise. In each stall there is a jersey and other items from the designated big league team, along with a brief team history. A center display case holds objects donated to the Hall of Fame from the past year or two. Fans can also look into a room designed to look like a manager's office. Outside is a display case with rotating artifacts. Currently the space is devoted to the [[World Baseball Classic]].\n\n===Third floor===\n* '''Autumn Glory''' is devoted to post-season baseball and has, among other artifacts, replicas of [[World Series ring]]s.\n* '''[[Hank Aaron]]: Chasing the Dream'''\n* A '''theater area''' continually plays the popular [[Abbott and Costello]] routine \"[[Who's on First?]]\" \n* '''One for the Books''' tells the story of baseball's most cherished records through more than 200 artifacts. The exhibit allows fans to search records dating back through baseball history via an interactive Top Ten Tower while giving visitors a look at exciting moments throughout the years via a multimedia wall.\n**'''[[BBWAA]] awards''': Replicas of various awards distributed by the BBWAA at the end of each season, along with a list of past winners.\n** A case dedicated to '''[[Ichiro Suzuki]]''' setting the major league record for base hits in a single season, with 262 in 2004, after [[George Sisler]] had held the record for 84 years with 257.\n** A case full of [[World Series ring]]s from prior years from the 1900s to present.\n** An '''inductee database''' touch-screen computer with statistics for every inductee.\n** '''Programs''' from every [[World Series]].\n* '''Sacred Ground''' is devoted entirely to ballparks and everything about them, especially the fan experience and the business of a ballpark. The centerpiece is a computer tour of three former ballparks: [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston]]'s [[South End Grounds]], [[Chicago White Sox|Chicago]]'s [[Comiskey Park]], and [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn]]'s [[Ebbets Field]].\n\n==Notable events==\n===1982 Unauthorized sales===\nA controversy erupted in 1982, when it emerged that some historic items given to the Hall had been sold on the collectibles market. The items had been lent to the [[Baseball Commissioner]]'s office, gotten mixed up with other property owned by the Commissioner's office and employees of the office, and moved to the garage of [[Joe Reichler]], an assistant to Commissioner [[Bowie Kuhn]], who sold the items to resolve his personal financial difficulties. Under pressure from the New York Attorney General, the Commissioner's Office made reparations, but the negative publicity damaged the Hall of Fame's reputation, and made it more difficult for it to solicit donations.<ref name=\"James-HoFItemSale\">{{cite book|last=James|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill James|title=[[Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?|The Politics of Glory]]|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company|year=1994|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/politicsofgloryh00jame/page/295 295\u2013298]|isbn=0-02-510774-7}}</ref>\n\n===2014 Commemorative coins===\n[[File:National-baseball-hall-of-fame-2014-us-mint-coins.jpg|thumb|right|325px|Examples of the National Baseball Hall of Fame coins produced by the United States Mint]]\nIn 2012, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed a law ordering the [[United States Mint]] to produce and sell commemorative, non-circulating coins to benefit the private, non-profit Hall.<ref>{{USPL|112|152}}</ref><ref name=\"obama\">{{cite web | url=http://baseballhall.org/news/press-releases/national-baseball-hall-fame-commemorative-coin-act-signed-law-president-obama | title=National Baseball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act Signed into Law by President Obama | publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame | work=press release | date=August 3, 2012 | accessdate=June 11, 2014}}</ref> The bill, {{USBill|112|HR|2527}}, was introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] by Rep.

It was written by Moyet and produced by Dave Dix.\n\n==Background==\nHaving recording her second studio album ''[[Raindancing]]'' while living in Los Angeles, Moyet returned to live in England after completing a world tour. Moyet's record company, CBS, wanted her to continue producing pop hits but this left the singer feeling artistically compromised and under pressure to deliver. During the period after returning to England, Moyet began a songwriting partnership with [[Pete Glenister]], who had been Moyet's guitarist for part of the ''Raindancing'' tour. Keen to have more artistic freedom, she suggested to CBS that Glenister should produce her. [[Muff Winwood]] of the label's A&R division granted Moyet permission to record the album she wanted to, with ''Hoodoo'' being released in April 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alisonmoyet.com/?cpt_discography=hoodoo |title=Hoodoo \u2013 |publisher=Alisonmoyet.com |date=1991-04-22 |accessdate=2017-04-01}}</ref><ref>Hoodoo \u2013 2016 deluxe edition CD booklet liner notes</ref>\n\n\"This House\" was released as the album's third single in September 1991.

It was written by Moyet and produced by Dave Dix.\n\n==Background==\nHaving recording her second studio album ''[[Raindancing]]'' while living in Los Angeles, Moyet returned to live in England after completing a world tour. Moyet's record company, CBS, wanted her to continue producing pop hits but this left the singer feeling artistically compromised and under pressure to deliver. During the period after returning to England, Moyet began a songwriting partnership with [[Pete Glenister]], who had been Moyet's guitarist for part of the ''Raindancing'' tour. Keen to have more artistic freedom, she suggested to CBS that Glenister should produce her. [[Muff Winwood]] of the label's A&R division granted Moyet permission to record the album she wanted to, with ''Hoodoo'' being released in April 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alisonmoyet.com/?cpt_discography=hoodoo |title=Hoodoo \u2013 |publisher=Alisonmoyet.com |date=1991-04-22 |accessdate=2017-04-01}}</ref><ref>Hoodoo \u2013 2016 deluxe edition CD booklet liner notes</ref>\n\n\"This House\" was released as the album's third single in September 1991.

He currently drives in the [[Stock Car Brasil]] series, which he won in 2008. Prior to this he raced in several European [[open-wheel racing|single-seater formulae]], winning the [[Spanish Formula Three Championship]] and recording podium finishes in [[International Formula 3000]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Formula Vauxhall/Opel===\nMaur\u00edcio was born in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]. After some time spent [[kart racing]], he moved up to [[formula racing]] in Brazil and won the local [[Formula Ford]] championship in 1995. For 1996, he moved to [[Europe]], where he competed in [[Formula Vauxhall]], finishing fourth in the championship. At the end of the year he took part in the [[1996 EFDA Nations Cup]] for [[Formula Opel]] cars, representing Brazil alongside compatriot [[Wagner Ebrahim]] and taking third place.\n\n===British Formula 3===\nFor [[1997 British Formula 3 season|1997]], Maur\u00edcio drove for the works [[TOM'S]]-[[Toyota in motorsports|Toyota]] team in the [[British Formula 3 Championship]], finishing joint 11th place in the championship with [[Darren Manning]] and just behind [[Kevin McGarrity]], the best-placed driver with a TOM'S chassis. At the end of the season he moved to the [[Alan Docking Racing]] team to compete in the [[Macau Grand Prix]], but failed to finish the race.\n\nHe remained in the championship for [[1998 British Formula 3 season|1998]], driving an ADR-run [[Dallara]] chassis, and improved to seventh place overall, with two podium finishes, well ahead of teammates [[Yudai Igarashi]] and [[Miku Santavirta]]. However, his performance was overshadowed by his compatriots [[Mario Haberfeld]], [[Enrique Bernoldi]] and [[Luciano Burti]], who dominated the championship between them, taking the top three positions in the drivers' standings.<ref>{{cite book | chapter = Formula 3 Review: Super Mario Pick of the Crop | last = Holder | first = Jim | title = [[Autocourse]] 1998-99 | publisher = Hazleton Publishing | isbn = 1-874557-43-8 | pages = 250\u2013251 | year = 1998}}</ref> He switched to champion team [[Paul Stewart Racing]] for the Macau Grand Prix, and finished the race in second place behind [[Peter Dumbreck]].\n\n===Formula 3000===\nMaur\u00edcio moved up to [[International Formula 3000]] for the [[1999 International Formula 3000 season|1999 season]], driving for [[Super Nova Racing|Super Nova]] alongside [[Jason Watt]], but after a difficult start he was dropped after three races in favour of [[David Saelens]]. He moved to the [[Red Bull Junior Team]]-backed team run by [[Helmut Marko]], replacing [[Markus Friesacher]] and partnering Bernoldi. Despite failing to qualify for three of the remaining races in a heavily-oversubscribed field of drivers, he scored his first point at the [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa-Francorchamps]] circuit, placing him 22nd in the championship.\n\nHe stayed with the team alongside Bernoldi for [[2000 International Formula 3000 season|2000]], making up for a seven-race run of retirements at the start of the season by securing his first podium finish in the category at the [[Hungaroring]], improving his final championship position to 17th. He was, however, overshadowed somewhat by Bernoldi, who scored just one more point but lost the lead in two races due to mechanical problems.<ref>{{cite book | chapter = Formula 3000 Review: Bruno Shades it over Ten Rounds | last = Arron | first = Simon | title = [[Autocourse]] 2000-2001 | publisher = Hazleton Publishing | isbn = 1-874557-79-9 | pages = 266\u2013269 | year = 2000}}</ref>\n\nMaur\u00edcio began the [[2001 International Formula 3000 season|2001 season]] without a drive, despite initially being reconfirmed at the Red Bull Junior Team alongside [[Patrick Friesacher]], who replaced the [[Formula One]]-bound Bernoldi.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Formula 3000 grid is forming|publisher=Inside F1|work=grandprix.com|url=http://grandprix.com/ns/ns05565.html|date=2002-01-24|accessdate=2009-08-09}}</ref> The seat was taken by [[Antonio Garc\u00eda (racing driver)|Antonio Garc\u00eda]] for the first four rounds of the championship, but Maur\u00edcio resumed it thereafter, becoming a consistent points-scorer on his way to eighth in the championship, including two more podium finishes.<ref>{{cite book | chapter = F3000 Review: Wilson Walks Tall | last = Arron | first = Simon | title = [[Autocourse]] 2001-2002 | publisher = Hazleton Publishing | isbn = 1-903135-06-0 | pages = 258\u2013261 | year = 2001}}</ref>\n\nMaur\u00edcio remained at the team for [[2002 International Formula 3000 season|2002]], but it was a disappointing season for him as he dropped to ninth in the championship, and was consistently outperformed by Friesacher. The highlight of the year was a podium finish in front of his home fans at the [[Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace|Interlagos]] circuit, where he completed a Brazilian 1-2-3-4 finish with [[Rodrigo Sperafico]], Haberfeld and [[Ant\u00f4nio Pizzonia]]. However, he was best remembered for his large crash at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], in which his car was launched into a series of aerial rolls after running into the back of [[Rob Nguyen]].<ref>{{cite book | chapter = F3000 Review: Bourdais' Pot-Luck Title | last = Arron | first = Simon | title = [[Autocourse]] 2002-2003 | publisher = Hazleton Publishing | isbn = 1-903135-10-9 | pages = 242\u2013245 | year = 2002}}</ref>\n\n===Spanish Formula Three===\nDropped by the Red Bull Junior Team and unable to find an F3000 drive, Maur\u00edcio stepped back to the [[Spanish Formula Three Championship]], where he drove for the [[Racing Engineering]] team, initially sponsored by [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]]. He won the championship, winning six of the thirteen races, ahead of local drivers [[Daniel Martin (racing driver)|Daniel Martin]], [[Borja Garc\u00eda]] and [[Andy Soucek]], and comfortably ahead of a succession of six teammates. However, this series was less prestigious than the F3 championships in other countries, and was not enough to advance his formula racing career any further, despite topping a [[World Series by Renault]] test session during the winter off-season period.\n\n===Stock Car Brasil===\n\n[[File:Ricardo Mauricio 2009 Stock Car Brasil.jpg|thumb|left|Maur\u00edcio driving his [[RC Competi\u00e7\u00f5es]]-run [[Chevrolet Astra]] in the 2009 [[Stock Car Brasil]] season.]]\n\nFor 2004, Maur\u00edcio returned to Brazil to take part in the [[Stock Car Brasil]] championship, a common location for Brazilian ex-single seater drivers. He took part in five races for the [[Kat\u00e1logo Racing]] and [[Andreas Mattheis Motorsport]] teams, finishing 23rd in the championship driving a [[Chevrolet Astra]], taking a podium finish and fastest lap in the process. The following year he committed to a full season in the series, driving a similar car run by the [[L&M Racing]] team.  Another podium finish and fastest lap saw him improve to 16th in the championship.\n\nMaur\u00edcio returned to Kat\u00e1logo for 2006, for whom he drove a [[Mitsubishi Lancer]]. He took his first [[pole position]] in the series and broke into the top ten in the drivers' standings for the first time. In 2007 he returned to Andreas Mattheis and the Chevrolet Astra in the form of the [[WA Mattheis]] team, a new outfit formed by the association of Mattheis and [[William Lube]]. He improved to ninth in the championship, taking his first win in the process.\n\nFor 2008, WA Mattheis switched cars to the [[Peugeot 307]], which Maur\u00edcio took to championship victory with five wins from the twelve races, narrowly beating the Astras of [[Marcos Gomes]] and [[Thiago Camilo]] in the process. It was Peugeot's first championship win in Stock Car Brasil history. In 2009, he moved to the [[RC Competi\u00e7\u00f5es]] team, and once again raced an Astra.  He was unable to successfully defend his championship, losing it to [[Cac\u00e1 Bueno]].\n\nHe remained with RC Competi\u00e7\u00f5es for 2010, driving a [[Chevrolet Vectra]]. He won two races and finished third in the championship, behind teammate [[Max Wilson]] and Bueno.\n\n===Brazilian GT3===\nMaur\u00edcio first competed in the [[GT Brasil|GT3 Brasil Championship]] in 2009, winning four races for [[WB Motorsport]] and finishing fourth in the championship. For 2010, he drove a [[Lamborghini Gallardo]] with [[Bruno Garfinkel]] for the [[Scuderia 111]] team and finished tenth in the championship.\n\n===Other series===\nSince his move into [[stock car racing]], Maur\u00edcio has also made occasional appearances in the [[United States|American]] [[World of Outlaws]] series and the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[TC 2000]] championship, winning the TC 2000's endurance series cup in 2009.\n\n==Racing record==\n\n===Career summary===\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 0 1em 0 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n!

He currently drives in the [[Stock Car Brasil]] series, which he won in 2008. Prior to this he raced in several European [[open-wheel racing|single-seater formulae]], winning the [[Spanish Formula Three Championship]] and recording podium finishes in [[International Formula 3000]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Formula Vauxhall/Opel===\nAfter some time spent [[kart racing]], Maur\u00edcio moved up to [[formula racing]] in Brazil and won the local [[Formula Ford]] championship in 1995. For 1996, he moved to [[Europe]], where he competed in [[Formula Vauxhall]], finishing fourth in the championship. At the end of the year he took part in the [[1996 EFDA Nations Cup]] for [[Formula Opel]] cars, representing Brazil alongside compatriot [[Wagner Ebrahim]] and taking third place.\n\n===British Formula 3===\nFor [[1997 British Formula 3 season|1997]], Maur\u00edcio drove for the works [[TOM'S]]-[[Toyota in motorsports|Toyota]] team in the [[British Formula 3 Championship]], finishing joint 11th place in the championship with [[Darren Manning]] and just behind [[Kevin McGarrity]], the best-placed driver with a TOM'S chassis. At the end of the season he moved to the [[Alan Docking Racing]] team to compete in the [[Macau Grand Prix]], but failed to finish the race.\n\nHe remained in the championship for [[1998 British Formula 3 season|1998]], driving an ADR-run [[Dallara]] chassis, and improved to seventh place overall, with two podium finishes, well ahead of teammates [[Yudai Igarashi]] and [[Miku Santavirta]]. However, his performance was overshadowed by his compatriots [[Mario Haberfeld]], [[Enrique Bernoldi]] and [[Luciano Burti]], who dominated the championship between them, taking the top three positions in the drivers' standings.<ref>{{cite book | chapter = Formula 3 Review: Super Mario Pick of the Crop | last = Holder | first = Jim | title = [[Autocourse]] 1998-99 | publisher = Hazleton Publishing | isbn = 1-874557-43-8 | pages = 250\u2013251 | year = 1998}}</ref> He switched to champion team [[Paul Stewart Racing]] for the Macau Grand Prix, and finished the race in second place behind [[Peter Dumbreck]].\n\n===Formula 3000===\nMaur\u00edcio moved up to [[International Formula 3000]] for the [[1999 International Formula 3000 season|1999 season]], driving for [[Super Nova Racing|Super Nova]] alongside [[Jason Watt]], but after a difficult start he was dropped after three races in favour of [[David Saelens]]. He moved to the [[Red Bull Junior Team]]-backed team run by [[Helmut Marko]], replacing [[Markus Friesacher]] and partnering Bernoldi. Despite failing to qualify for three of the remaining races in a heavily-oversubscribed field of drivers, he scored his first point at the [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa-Francorchamps]] circuit, placing him 22nd in the championship.\n\nHe stayed with the team alongside Bernoldi for [[2000 International Formula 3000 season|2000]], making up for a seven-race run of retirements at the start of the season by securing his first podium finish in the category at the [[Hungaroring]], improving his final championship position to 17th. He was, however, overshadowed somewhat by Bernoldi, who scored just one more point but lost the lead in two races due to mechanical problems.<ref>{{cite book | chapter = Formula 3000 Review: Bruno Shades it over Ten Rounds | last = Arron | first = Simon | title = [[Autocourse]] 2000-2001 | publisher = Hazleton Publishing | isbn = 1-874557-79-9 | pages = 266\u2013269 | year = 2000}}</ref>\n\nMaur\u00edcio began the [[2001 International Formula 3000 season|2001 season]] without a drive, despite initially being reconfirmed at the Red Bull Junior Team alongside [[Patrick Friesacher]], who replaced the [[Formula One]]-bound Bernoldi.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Formula 3000 grid is forming|publisher=Inside F1|work=grandprix.com|url=http://grandprix.com/ns/ns05565.html|date=2002-01-24|accessdate=2009-08-09}}</ref> The seat was taken by [[Antonio Garc\u00eda (racing driver)|Antonio Garc\u00eda]] for the first four rounds of the championship, but Maur\u00edcio resumed it thereafter, becoming a consistent points-scorer on his way to eighth in the championship, including two more podium finishes.<ref>{{cite book | chapter = F3000 Review: Wilson Walks Tall | last = Arron | first = Simon | title = [[Autocourse]] 2001-2002 | publisher = Hazleton Publishing | isbn = 1-903135-06-0 | pages = 258\u2013261 | year = 2001}}</ref>\n\nMaur\u00edcio remained at the team for [[2002 International Formula 3000 season|2002]], but it was a disappointing season for him as he dropped to ninth in the championship, and was consistently outperformed by Friesacher. The highlight of the year was a podium finish in front of his home fans at the [[Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace|Interlagos]] circuit, where he completed a Brazilian 1-2-3-4 finish with [[Rodrigo Sperafico]], Haberfeld and [[Ant\u00f4nio Pizzonia]]. However, he was best remembered for his large crash at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], in which his car was launched into a series of aerial rolls after running into the back of [[Rob Nguyen]].<ref>{{cite book | chapter = F3000 Review: Bourdais' Pot-Luck Title | last = Arron | first = Simon | title = [[Autocourse]] 2002-2003 | publisher = Hazleton Publishing | isbn = 1-903135-10-9 | pages = 242\u2013245 | year = 2002}}</ref>\n\n===Spanish Formula Three===\nDropped by the Red Bull Junior Team and unable to find an F3000 drive, Maur\u00edcio stepped back to the [[Spanish Formula Three Championship]], where he drove for the [[Racing Engineering]] team, initially sponsored by [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]]. He won the championship, winning six of the thirteen races, ahead of local drivers [[Daniel Martin (racing driver)|Daniel Martin]], [[Borja Garc\u00eda]] and [[Andy Soucek]], and comfortably ahead of a succession of six teammates. However, this series was less prestigious than the F3 championships in other countries, and was not enough to advance his formula racing career any further, despite topping a [[World Series by Renault]] test session during the winter off-season period.\n\n===Stock Car Brasil===\n\n[[File:Ricardo Mauricio 2009 Stock Car Brasil.jpg|thumb|left|Maur\u00edcio driving his [[RC Competi\u00e7\u00f5es]]-run [[Chevrolet Astra]] in the 2009 [[Stock Car Brasil]] season.]]\n\nFor 2004, Maur\u00edcio returned to Brazil to take part in the [[Stock Car Brasil]] championship, a common location for Brazilian ex-single seater drivers. He took part in five races for the [[Kat\u00e1logo Racing]] and [[Andreas Mattheis Motorsport]] teams, finishing 23rd in the championship driving a [[Chevrolet Astra]], taking a podium finish and fastest lap in the process. The following year he committed to a full season in the series, driving a similar car run by the [[L&M Racing]] team.  Another podium finish and fastest lap saw him improve to 16th in the championship.\n\nMaur\u00edcio returned to Kat\u00e1logo for 2006, for whom he drove a [[Mitsubishi Lancer]]. He took his first [[pole position]] in the series and broke into the top ten in the drivers' standings for the first time. In 2007 he returned to Andreas Mattheis and the Chevrolet Astra in the form of the [[WA Mattheis]] team, a new outfit formed by the association of Mattheis and [[William Lube]]. He improved to ninth in the championship, taking his first win in the process.\n\nFor 2008, WA Mattheis switched cars to the [[Peugeot 307]], which Maur\u00edcio took to championship victory with five wins from the twelve races, narrowly beating the Astras of [[Marcos Gomes]] and [[Thiago Camilo]] in the process. It was Peugeot's first championship win in Stock Car Brasil history. In 2009, he moved to the [[RC Competi\u00e7\u00f5es]] team, and once again raced an Astra.  He was unable to successfully defend his championship, losing it to [[Cac\u00e1 Bueno]].\n\nHe remained with RC Competi\u00e7\u00f5es for 2010, driving a [[Chevrolet Vectra]]. He won two races and finished third in the championship, behind teammate [[Max Wilson]] and Bueno.\n\n===Brazilian GT3===\nMaur\u00edcio first competed in the [[GT Brasil|GT3 Brasil Championship]] in 2009, winning four races for [[WB Motorsport]] and finishing fourth in the championship. For 2010, he drove a [[Lamborghini Gallardo]] with [[Bruno Garfinkel]] for the [[Scuderia 111]] team and finished tenth in the championship.\n\n===Other series===\nSince his move into [[stock car racing]], Maur\u00edcio has also made occasional appearances in the [[United States|American]] [[World of Outlaws]] series and the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[TC 2000]] championship, winning the TC 2000's endurance series cup in 2009.\n\n==Racing record==\n\n===Career summary===\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 0 1em 0 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n!
