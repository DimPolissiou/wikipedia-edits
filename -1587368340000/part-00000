Her latest letter is to her childhood friend Josh, who is dating her older sister Margot. When Margot moves to college, she breaks up with Josh. Lara Jean has always had a crush on Josh and has to decide if it would be okay to date him.\n\nOne night, while hanging out with her little sister, Kitty, Lara Jean falls asleep on the couch, allowing Kitty to sneak into Lara Jean's room and find her collection of letters. The following Monday at school, Lara Jean is confronted by a former crush of hers, Peter Kavinsky. Peter reveals he was mailed his letter,  causing Lara Jean to faint. After waking up, she sees Josh approaching with a letter of his own, and in a moment of panic, Lara Jean kisses Peter on the school track to throw Josh off before running off.\n\nLara Jean then encounters another recipient of a letter, Lucas, who comes out as gay as she realizes all the letters have been mailed. She then explains to Peter she was merely causing Josh to think she lost interest in him. Peter is surprisingly okay with this and proposes he and Lara Jean fake date each other to make his ex-girlfriend (Lara Jean's ex-best friend and current #1 rival) Gen jealous. She agrees, and the next few months go by with the whole school, along with their respective friends and families, believing the lie.\n\nHowever, when Peter finds Gen actually jealous, he finds himself conflicted on his true feelings. Meanwhile, Lara Jean finds herself jealous at the two. Eventually, the two go on the school ski trip together, where they confront each other about their true feelings. They proceed to kiss while alone in a hot tub. After the trip ends, Gen confronts Lara Jean, revealing Peter spent the night in her room after they kissed and taunting Lara Jean by showing her a scrunchie Peter let her take, that was actually Lara Jean's favorite. Furious, Lara Jean breaks up with Peter and storms home, where she finds Margot has returned home from college. Peter then comes to her house, hoping to explain that nothing happened between him and Gen, but Josh arrives as well. Margot overhears everything, and is visibly upset when she learns of Lara Jean's former feelings for Josh. Things are worsened when after Lara Jean asks Peter to leave, she sees that a video of her and Peter in the hot tub has been put up on [[Instagram]], seemingly showing the two in a sexual act.\n\nLara Jean asks for Margot's help, who calms down and comforts her sister. Kitty then reveals she was the one who sent the letters. While Lara Jean is enraged, Margot calms her down when she asks why the letters had addresses on them. Lara Jean realizes she may have wanted to send them but was too afraid to do so, and the sisters forgive each other before emailing Instagram to get the video taken down.\n\nAfter Christmas break, Lara Jean discovers everyone knows about the video anyway, while Peter tries to tell everyone that nothing happened. Lara Jean confronts Gen about the video, who reveals she tried to sabotage their relationship as she felt betrayed when Lara Jean kissed Peter  during [[spin the bottle]] at a seventh grade party. After talking with her dad and reevaluating the relationships in her life, Lara Jean talks to Josh, who agrees to be friends again. When she hesitates to go to Peter despite having real feelings, Kitty pushes her to do so. Lara Jean goes to see Peter, and he tells her he is in love with her. The two kiss before walking off together.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, a recipient, John Ambrose McClaren, of another of the five Lara Jean's letters arrives at her door with flowers in hand.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:To All the Boys - P.S.

It reached #36 on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Black Singles chart]]. The song gets its name from the first word of the song.\n\n==Subject and interpretation==\n\nThe song implies that the love the singer has for his partner will never diminish, as he says that he will love her until the physically impossible becomes true. The impossible feats include: rainbows burning the stars out in the sky, oceans covering the tops of every mountain, dolphins flying, and parrots living at sea, dreaming of life and life becoming a dream, day becoming night and vice versa, trees and the seas flying away, 8\u00d78\u00d78 equaling 4, this day becoming the last day, the [[Earth's rotation|Earth turning right to left]], the Earth denying itself, [[Mother Nature]] saying her work is through, and \"until the day that you are me and I am you.\"\n\nBy the most straightforward interpretation of the lyrics, this is a lover serenading his beloved.  By another possible interpretation, the lyrics describe endless unconditional love for the listener, sung on behalf of the Abrahamic god. In yet a third interpretation, the song expresses the lyricist's own love for humanity. The verse that begins with \"We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles...\" would seem to preclude the first interpretation, and the second interpretation would seem precluded by the lyric, \"As today I know I'm living but tomorrow, Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear\".\nHi how are you today, I don\u2019t like Wikipedia, hope you are okay during lockdown!\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[Nathan Watts]] \u2013 bass, [[handclaps]]\n*[[Dean Parks]] \u2013 guitar\n*[[Herbie Hancock]] \u2013 Fender Rhodes, handclaps\n*Greg Brown \u2013 drums\n*Stevie Wonder \u2013 lead and background vocal, Fender Rhodes\n*Mary Lee Whitney \u2013 background vocals\n*Dave Hanson, Yolanda Simon, Josette Valentino \u2013 handclaps\n\n==Charts==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1977-78)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100<ref>{{cite book|first= Joel |last= Whitburn |authorlink= Joel Whitburn |year= 1993 |title= Top Adult Contemporary: 1961\u20131993 |publisher= Record Research |page=261}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|36\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening]]<ref>{{cite book|first= Joel |last= Whitburn |authorlink= Joel Whitburn |year= 1993 |title= Top Adult Contemporary: 1961\u20131993 |publisher= Record Research |page=261}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|24\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' [[R&B]]\n|align=\"center\"|36\n|-\n|}\n\n==George Michael and Mary J.

It pissed everyone off at Sony. It pissed George Michael off. It pissed everyone off, but we couldn't make Jay Boberg bend.

It reached #36 on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Black Singles chart]]. The song gets its name from the first word of the song.\n\n==Subject and interpretation==\n\nThe song implies that the love the singer has for his partner will never diminish, as he says that he will love her until the physically impossible becomes true. The impossible feats include: rainbows burning the stars out in the sky, oceans covering the tops of every mountain, dolphins flying, and parrots living at sea, dreaming of life and life becoming a dream, day becoming night and vice versa, trees and the seas flying away, 8\u00d78\u00d78 equaling 4, this day becoming the last day, the [[Earth's rotation|Earth turning right to left]], the Earth denying itself, [[Mother Nature]] saying her work is through, and \"until the day that you are me and I am you.\"\n\nBy the most straightforward interpretation of the lyrics, this is a lover serenading his beloved.  By another possible interpretation, the lyrics describe endless unconditional love for the listener, sung on behalf of the Abrahamic god. In yet a third interpretation, the song expresses the lyricist's own love for humanity. The verse that begins with \"We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles...\" would seem to preclude the first interpretation, and the second interpretation would seem precluded by the lyric, \"As today I know I'm living but tomorrow, Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear\".\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[Nathan Watts]] \u2013 bass, [[handclaps]]\n*[[Dean Parks]] \u2013 guitar\n*[[Herbie Hancock]] \u2013 Fender Rhodes, handclaps\n*Greg Brown \u2013 drums\n*Stevie Wonder \u2013 lead and background vocal, Fender Rhodes\n*Mary Lee Whitney \u2013 background vocals\n*Dave Hanson, Yolanda Simon, Josette Valentino \u2013 handclaps\n\n==Charts==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1977-78)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100<ref>{{cite book|first= Joel |last= Whitburn |authorlink= Joel Whitburn |year= 1993 |title= Top Adult Contemporary: 1961\u20131993 |publisher= Record Research |page=261}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|36\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening]]<ref>{{cite book|first= Joel |last= Whitburn |authorlink= Joel Whitburn |year= 1993 |title= Top Adult Contemporary: 1961\u20131993 |publisher= Record Research |page=261}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|24\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' [[R&B]]\n|align=\"center\"|36\n|-\n|}\n\n==George Michael and Mary J.

Mahadji demanded Rs.63,00,000 from the Jaipur court however these demands were refused upon which Mahadji marched against Jaipur with his army. A part of the Mughal army under Hamdani deserted and defected to the Rajput army before the battle.<ref>Rajasthan Through the Ages pg.222-229</ref> The battle ended after three days, with the retreat of [[Mahadji Shinde]] at [[Tunga River|Tunga]], close to [[Lalsot]].\n\n==Battle==\nThe battle started with cannonade on both sides. The Jaipur army stayed back in a defensive position as they had long range artillery, the cannonade continued till 11 O'Clock,  the Gwalior army faced some casualties as they had light artillery and could not counterattack effectively. The Rathor horsemen of Jodhpur however grew impatient as they found the Jaipur strategy to be cowardly and degrading, around 4000 of them with their chieftains and family heads charged the Gwalior army leaving their general Bhim Singh behind. The Marathas shot the Rathors with artillery and musket fire killing many, however the Rathors undaunted by the casualties charged the Marathas and broke into their left wing, many from the Gwalior side were killed, the Rathors pushed deep into Gwalior lines and attacked De Boigne, forcing him to retreat after a short fight. Rana Khan upon seeing his left wing crumble, sent reinforcements under Shivaji Vithal, Rayaji Patil and Khande Hari, they slowly rallied the fleeing soldiers and fought \"the bloodiest and most obstinate struggle of the day\". The Jaipur army however did not take advantage of this opening created by the reckless charge and held their positions. The Rathors upon seeing no reinforcements, started losing morale as the Gwalior reserves were now approaching them, they were finally pushed back. The right wing of the Gwalior army fared better as they unknowingly killed the Mughal General Muhammad Beg Hamdani when a stray shot from the cannon struck a tree which dropped upon him and causing him to fall off his howdah and ripped half his body open. Hamdani's soldiers made a charge at the Gwalior right wing, but were pushed back. Upon knowing that their general was dead the Mughalias did not make another attempt to attack the Gwalior army. The Rathors did make attempts to capture the Gwalior artillery, they charged the Gwalior army four times but were repelled in all their attempts. The two armies held their positions till midnight and then returned to their camps. Mahadji did not make any advances as he did not know about Muhammad Beg's death. Mahadji also feared that the Rajput and Mughal soldiers in his own army may change sides. There was some cannonade but both sides remained in their camps for the rest of the war.<ref>Fall Of Mughal Empire Vol-3 (hb), Volume 3 By Jadunath Sarkar pg.219-227 [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=_XZh4CF1m2wC&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=fall+of+the+mughal+empire+lalsot&source=bl&ots=hixnmlDHgc&sig=ACfU3U0MdreyERaVsOzSxUCj7hKm8xwvwQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjH04HvtfboAhV27HMBHfl5Ac4Q6AEwB3oECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=fall%20of%20the%20mughal%20empire%20lalsot&f=false]</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nMahadji Scindia was forced to retreat on 1 August 1787. Both sides claimed victory in this battle. However all successive charges by the Rathore cavalry were repulsed and no gunnery of the Marathas could be captured. The Rajputs also had higher casualties, mostly suffered by the Jodhpur army as they lost more than a thousand Rathor horsemen. On the other hand the Marathas did not manage to rout the enemy out of their camps because they were unaware of Hamadani's death until late night. Ultimately Mahadaji Shinde's forces had to retreat owing to treachery and dissensions in his own ranks and the utter failure of provisions.<ref>Fall Of Mughal Empire Vol-3 (hb), Volume 3 By Jadunath Sarkar pg.227-228 [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=_XZh4CF1m2wC&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=fall+of+the+mughal+empire+lalsot&source=bl&ots=hixnmlDHgc&sig=ACfU3U0MdreyERaVsOzSxUCj7hKm8xwvwQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjH04HvtfboAhV27HMBHfl5Ac4Q6AEwB3oECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=fall%20of%20the%20mughal%20empire%20lalsot&f=false]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{MarathaEmpire}}\n\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1787]]\n[[Category:Battles involving the Maratha Empire]]\n[[Category:1787 in India]]\n[[Category:Battles involving the Mughal Empire]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2016}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Battle of Lalsot\n| partof      = [[Imperial Maratha Conquests]]\n| date        = 1787\n| place       = [[Lalsot]]\n| territory   = \n| result      = Rajput victory.<ref name=\"lalsot\"/>\n| status      = \n| combatant1  = [[Gwalior state|Kingdom of Gwalior]]<br>[[Mughal Empire]]<br>Rao of [[Alwar State|Macheri]]\n| combatant2  =[[Jaipur State|Kingdom of Jaipur]]<br>[[Jodhpur State|Kingdom of Marwar]]<br>Mughals under Hamdani\n| commander1  = <ref>Rajasthan Through the Ages pg.233</ref>[[Mahadji Shinde]]<br>[[Beno\u00eet de Boigne|General de Boigne]]<br>Rana Khan<br>Khande Rao Hari<br>Ambaji Ingle<br>Murtaza Khan Barech<br>Ghasi Khan<br>Motigir Gosain<br>Najaf Khan<br>Leseneau<br>Le Vassoult\n| commander2  =  [[Pratap Singh of Jaipur]]<br>Muhammad Beg Hamdani{{KIA}}<br>Bhim Singh\n| strength1   = unknown number under Mahadji<br>25,000 reinforcements under Khande Rao Hari, Boigne and Ambaji Ingle<ref>Rajasthan Through the Ages pg.228</ref>\n| strength2   = 20,000 feudal levies from Jaipur<br>5,000 Rathor horsemen from Jodhpur<br>5,000 Naga infantry from Jodhpur<br>unknown number under Hamdani<ref>Rajasthan Through the Ages pg.226</ref>\n| casualties1 = Unknown\n| casualties2 = Unknown\n| notes       = Unknown\n}}\n\nThe '''Battle of [[Lalsot]]''' was fought between the [[Rajputs]] of [[Jaipur]] and [[Jodhpur]] against [[Mahadji Scindia]] of [[Gwalior]] who as the Mir Bakshi (Regent) of the Mughal Empire was burdened to collect taxes from the Rajput States.

It is the first in the [[video game]] series to Debut for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Wii]] consoles as launch titles and the last one to be released on the [[Game Boy Advance]]. Former [[Seattle Seahawks]] [[running back]] [[Shaun Alexander]] is on the cover. This is the last game to feature [[NFL Europe]] in the series.\n\n==Features==\nJust as in previous titles in the ''Madden NFL'' series, ''Madden NFL 07'' makes a few additions to the general game play.\n\n*'''Lead Blocker Control:''' After selecting a running play, the player will be able to cycle through the offensive players as they get into position at the line. The player can choose the athlete to control when the ball is snapped, and the game camera will zoom in on the fullback, tackle, guard, center, tight end, or wide receiver selected. With this feature, it is now possible for the player to open up a path for a running play, as the computer controls the halfback and tries to slip through the gap created. This feature also appeals to Madden players who do not wish to use computer assistance in any way, shape, or form. This feature allows the player to manually block with their fullback, tackle, guard, center, tight end, or wide receiver and quickly switch to their halfback to manually slip through the gap created, thus eliminating any computer assistance during the gameplay.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Haynes|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/08/22/madden-nfl-07-review-5|title=Madden NFL 07 Review|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]|date=August 22, 2006|accessdate=January 10, 2018}}</ref>\n*'''Highlight Stick:''' Players can now move the right analog stick in any direction to see an animation where the smaller running backs will duck, spin, or squirt out of a tackle. It is also possible to string such evasive moves together, piecing together a juke left with a hop step backwards (down on the right analog stick for PS2 and Xbox or down on the C stick for Gamecube) to elude defenders. The Truck Stick animations still exist for the bigger backs, but also feature more variety of running moves with the addition of the Highlight Stick. For example, using the Highlight Stick with Tiki Barber, a smaller back not known for trucking, utilizes an array of moves to avoid and squirt out of tackles.\n*'''Juking and Spinning:''' Players can now choose two types of both Jukes and Spins to avoid would-be tacklers. For the PS2, players can either do a cut move to the left or right using the L1 or R1 buttons respectively, or a wider juke to the left or right by flicking the Right Analog stick left or right respectively. For a quick spin to elude a tackler the player simply taps the circle button. For a stronger spin which could possibly break a tackle, simply hold down the circle button.\n*'''FreeMotion Controls:''' The [[Wii]] version of ''Madden NFL 07'', which was developed at EA Canada rather than Tiburon, features a unique control scheme that has been completely redone to complement the motion sensing capabilities of the console's Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-07/ps2-811803|title=Madden NFL 07 (PS2)|website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=January 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and Wii versions==\nThe [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation]] version of ''Madden NFL 07'' featured the Superstar Mode and Franchise but the Tony Bruno Show was absent in this game possibly due to a contractual issue, but he was in the [[Wii]] and [[PlayStation 2]] versions. The [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] version also did not allow the player to edit the players appearance or attributes or change the numbers on their jerseys, but the Wii version and PlayStation 2 version did. Though, the [[Xbox 360]] version did allow one to create a player. The franchise mode is not as deep as the previous generation versions, as Owner Mode is not present. Fantasy Draft and Two-Player co-operative play are missing as well.

It is the first in the [[video game]] series to Debut for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Wii]] consoles as launch titles and the last one to be released on the [[Game Boy Advance]]. Former [[Seattle Seahawks]] [[running back]] [[Shaun Alexander]] is on the cover. This is the last game to feature [[NFL Europe]] in the series.\n\n==Features==\nJust as in previous titles in the ''Madden NFL'' series, ''Madden NFL 07'' makes a few additions to the general game play.\n\n*'''Lead Blocker Control:''' After selecting a running play, the player will be able to cycle through the offensive players as they get into position at the line. The player can choose the athlete to control when the ball is snapped, and the game camera will zoom in on the fullback, tackle, guard, center, tight end, or wide receiver selected. With this feature, it is now possible for the player to open up a path for a running play, as the computer controls the halfback and tries to slip through the gap created. This feature also appeals to Madden players who do not wish to use computer assistance in any way, shape, or form. This feature allows the player to manually block with their fullback, tackle, guard, center, tight end, or wide receiver and quickly switch to their halfback to manually slip through the gap created, thus eliminating any computer assistance during the gameplay.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Haynes|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/08/22/madden-nfl-07-review-5|title=Madden NFL 07 Review|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]|date=August 22, 2006|accessdate=January 10, 2018}}</ref>\n*'''Highlight Stick:''' Players can now move the right analog stick in any direction to see an animation where the smaller running backs will duck, spin, or squirt out of a tackle. It is also possible to string such evasive moves together, piecing together a juke left with a hop step backwards (down on the right analog stick for PS2 and Xbox or down on the C stick for Gamecube) to elude defenders. The Truck Stick animations still exist for the bigger backs, but also feature more variety of running moves with the addition of the Highlight Stick. For example, using the Highlight Stick with Tiki Barber, a smaller back not known for trucking, utilizes an array of moves to avoid and squirt out of tackles.\n*'''Juking and Spinning:''' Players can now choose two types of both Jukes and Spins to avoid would-be tacklers. For the PS2, players can either do a cut move to the left or right using the L1 or R1 buttons respectively, or a wider juke to the left or right by flicking the Right Analog stick left or right respectively. For a quick spin to elude a tackler the player simply taps the circle button. For a stronger spin which could possibly break a tackle, simply hold down the circle button.\n*'''FreeMotion Controls:''' The [[Wii]] version of ''Madden NFL 07'', which was developed at EA Canada rather than Tiburon, features a unique control scheme that has been completely redone to complement the motion sensing capabilities of the console's Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-07/ps2-811803|title=Madden NFL 07 (PS2)|website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=January 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and Wii versions==\nThe [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation]] version of ''Madden NFL 07'' featured the Superstar Mode and Franchise but the Tony Bruno Show was absent in this game possibly due to a contractual issue, but he was in the [[Wii]] and [[PlayStation 2]] versions. The [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] version also did not allow the player to edit the players appearance or attributes or change the numbers on their jerseys, but the Wii version and PlayStation 2 version did. Though, the [[Xbox 360]] version did allow one to create a player. The franchise mode is not as deep as the previous generation versions, as Owner Mode is not present. Fantasy Draft and Two-Player co-operative play are missing as well. Also this game would be the last appearance of the [[NFL Europa|NFL Europe]] teams in the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] version, next gen games came without the league teams.<ref>{{cite

{"title_page": "Forensic DNA analysis", "text_new": "{{for|DNA testing for inherited diseases|Genetic testing}}\n{{Distinguish|DNA barcoding|DNA phenotyping}}\n{{Orphan|date=November 2019}}\n\n{{Forensic science|physio|image=DNA double helix horizontal.png}}\n\n'''DNA profiling''' is the determination of a [[DNA profile]] for legal and investigative purposes. DNA analysis methods have changed numerous times over the years as technology improves and allows for more information to be determined with less starting material. Modern DNA analysis is based on the statistical calculation of the rarity of the produced profile within a population.\n\nWhile most well known as a tool in forensic investigations, DNA profiling can also be used for non-forensic purposes. [[DNA paternity testing|Paternity testing]], and human [[Genetic genealogy|genealogy]] research are just two of the non-forensic uses of DNA profiling.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe methods for producing a DNA profile were developed by [[Alec Jeffreys]] and his team in 1984.<ref name=\"Jeffreys\" />\nand the mom\n\n== Methods ==\n\n=== Retired methods ===\n\n==== RFLP analysis ====\n[[File:D1S80Demo.png|thumb|right|Six individuals with different number of repeats at one location in their genome shown on a gel.]]\n{{see also|Restriction fragment length polymorphism}}\n\nThe first true method of DNA profiling was restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The first use of RFLP analysis in forensic casework was in 1985 in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"RFLP1\" /> This type of analysis used [[variable number tandem repeat]]s (VNTRs) to distinguish between individuals. VNTRs are common throughout the genome and consist of the same DNA sequence repeated again and again.<ref name=\"VNTRcommon\" /> Different individuals can have a different number of repeats at a specific location in the genome.<ref name=\"RFLP1\" /> For example, person A could have four while person B could have 5 repeats. The differences were visualized through a process called [[Gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids|gel electrophoresis]]. Smaller fragments would travel farther through the gel than larger fragments separating them out.<ref name=\"Gel\" /> These differences were used to distinguish between individuals and when multiple VNTR sites were run together, RFLP analysis has a high degree of individualizing power.<ref name=\"RFLPind\" />\n\nThe process of RFLP analysis was extremely time consuming and due to the length of the repeats used, between 9 and 100 base pairs,<ref name=\"VNTRcommon\" /><ref name=\"Ashort\" /> amplification methods such as the [[polymerase chain reaction]] could not be used. This limited RFLP to samples that already had a larger quantity of DNA available to start with and did not perform well with degraded samples.<ref name=\"RFLPbad\" /> RFLP analysis was the primary type of analysis performed in most forensic laboratories before finally being retired and replaced by newer methods. It was fully abandoned by the [[FBI]] in 2000 and replaced with STR analysis.<ref name=\"DQdate\" />\n\n==== DQ alpha testing ====\n{{see also|HLA-DQA1}}\n[[File:DQ alpha 1 testing strip.png|thumb|right|A DQ alpha testing strip showing a positive result. The filled in dots represent the allele values for that sample.]]\n\nDeveloped in 1991,<ref name=\"DQdate\" /> DQ alpha testing was the first forensic DNA technique that utilized the polymerase chain reaction.<ref name=\"DQA1\" /> This technique allowed for the use of far fewer cells than RFLP analysis making it more useful for crime scenes that did not have the large amounts of DNA material that was previously required.<ref name=\"DQ vs RFLP\" /> The DQ alpha 1 [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] (or location) was also [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] and had multiple different [[allele]]s that could be used to limit the pool of individuals that could have produced that result and increasing the probability of exclusion.<ref name=\"DQApoly\" />\n\nThe DQ alpha locus was combined with other loci in a commercially available kit called Polymarker in 1993.<ref name=\"Polymarker\" /> Polymarker was a precursor to modern [[Multiplex (assay)|multiplexing]] kits and allowed multiple different loci to be examined with one product. While more sensitive than RFLP analysis, Polymarker did not contain the same discriminatory power as the older RFLP testing.<ref name=\"Polymarker\" /> By 1995, scientists attempted to return to a VNTR based analysis combined with PCR technology called amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AmpFLP).<ref name=\"DQdate\" />\n\n==== AmpFLP ====\n[[File:AmpFLP gel of D1S80 locus.png|thumb|right|An [[Agarose gel electrophoresis|agarose gel]] showing the D1S80 locus ran in multiple lanes using AmpFLP.]]\n{{see also|Amplified fragment length polymorphism}}\n\nAmpFLP was the first attempt to couple VNTR analysis with PCR for forensic casework. This method used shorter VNTRs than RFLP analysis, between 8 and 16 base pairs. The shorter base pair sizes of AmpFLP was designed to work better with the amplification process of PCR.<ref name=\"Ashort\" /> It was hoped that this technique would allow for the discriminating power of RFLP analysis with the ability to process samples that have less template DNA to work with or which were otherwise degraded. However, only a few loci were validated for forensic applications to work with AmpFLP analysis  as forensic labs quickly moved on to other techniques limited its discriminating ability for forensic samples.<ref name=\"AFLPval\" />\n\nThe technique was ultimately never widely used although it is still in use in smaller countries due to its lower cost and simpler setup compared to newer methods.<ref name=\"AmpFLP\" /><ref name=\"FLPsmall\" /> By the late 1990s, laboratories began switching over to newer methods including STR analysis. These used even shorter fragments of DNA and could more reliably be amplified using PCR while still maintaining, and improving, the discriminatory power of the older methods.<ref name=\"DQdate\" />\n\n=== Current methods ===\n\n==== STR analysis ====\n{{main|STR analysis}}\n[[File:Str profile.jpg|thumb|right|A partial [[electropherogram]] produced through STR analysis.]]\n\nShort tandem repeat (STR) analysis is the primary type of forensic DNA analysis performed in modern DNA laboratories. STR analysis builds upon RFLP and AmpFLP used in the past by shrinking the size of the repeat units, to 2 to 6 base pairs, and by combining multiple different loci into one PCR reaction. These multiplexing assay kits can produce allele values for dozens of different loci throughout the genome simultaneously limiting the amount of time it takes to gain a full, individualizing, profile. STR analysis has become the gold standard for DNA profiling and is used extensively in forensic applications.\n\nSTR analysis can also be restricted to just the [[Y chromosome]]. [[Y-STR]] analysis can be used in cases that involve paternity or in [[familial searching]] as the Y chromosome is identical down the paternal line (except in cases where a [[mutation]] occurred). Certain multiplexing kits combine both autosomal and Y-STR loci into one kit further reducing the amount of time it takes to obtain a large amount of data.\n\n==== mtDNA sequencing ====\n{{see also|Mitochondrial DNA}}\n\nMitochondrial DNA sequencing is a specialized technique that uses the separate mitochondrial DNA present in most cells. This DNA is passed down the material line and is not unique between individuals. However, because of the number of mitochondria present in cells, mtDNA analysis can be used for highly degraded samples or samples where STR analysis would not produce enough data to be useful. mtDNA is also present in locations where autosomal DNA would be absent, such as in the shafts of hair.\n\nBecause of the increased chance of contamination when dealing with mtDNA, few laboratories process mitochondrial samples. Those that do have specialized protocols in place that further separate different samples from each other to avoid cross-contamination.\n\n==== Rapid DNA ====\n{{main|Rapid DNA}}\n\nRapid DNA is a \"swab in-profile out\" technology that completely automates the entire DNA extraction, amplification, and analysis process. Rapid DNA instruments are able to go from a swab to a DNA profile in as little as 90 minutes and eliminates the need for trained scientists to perform the process. These instruments are being looked at for use in the offender booking process allowing police officers to obtain the DNA profile of the person under arrest.\n\nRecently, the [[Rapid DNA Act of 2017]] was passed in the United States, directing the FBI to create protocols for the implementation of this technology throughout the country. Currently, DNA obtained from these instruments is not eligible for upload to national DNA databases as they do not analyze enough loci to meet the standard threshold. However, multiple police agencies already use Rapid DNA instruments to collect samples from people arrested in their area. These local DNA database are not subject to federal or state regulations.\n\n==== Massively parallel sequencing ====\n{{main|Massive parallel sequencing}}\n\nAlso known as next-generation sequencing, massively parallel sequencing (MPS) builds upon STR analysis by introducing direct sequencing of the loci. Instead of the number of repeats present at each location, MPS would give the scientist the actual base pair sequence. Theoretically MPS has the ability to distinguish between identical twins as random point mutations would be seen within repeat segments that would not be picked up by traditional STR analysis.\n\n== Profile rarity ==\n\nWhen a DNA profile is used in an evidentiary manner a match statistic is provided that explains how rare a profile is within a population. Specifically, this statistic is the probability that a person picked randomly out of a population would have that specific DNA profile. It is not the probability that the profile [[prosecutor's fallacy|\"matches\" someone]]. There are multiple different methods to determining this statistic and each are used by various laboratories based on their experience and preference. However, likelihood ratio calculations is becoming the preferred method over the other two most commonly used methods, random man not excluded and combined probability of inclusion. Match statistics are especially important in mixture interpretation where there is more than one contributor to a DNA profile. When these statistics are given in a courtroom setting or in a laboratory report they are usually given for the three most common races of that specific area. This is because the allele frequencies at different loci changed based on the individual's ancestry. https://strbase.nist.gov/training/6_Mixture-Statistics.pdf\n\n=== Random man not excluded ===\n{{main|Random man not excluded}}\n\nThe probability produced with this method is the probability that a person randomly selected out the population could not be excluded from the analyzed data. This type of match statistic is easy to explain in a courtroom setting to individuals who have no scientific background but it also loses a lot of discriminating power as it does not take into account the suspect's genotype. This approach is commonly used when the sample is degraded or contains so many contributors that a singular profile cannot be determined. It is also useful in explaining to laypersons as the method of obtaining the statistic is straightforward. However, due to its limited discriminating power, RMNE is not generally performed unless no other method can be used. RMNE is not recommended for use in data that indicates a mixture is present.\n\n=== Combined probability of inclusion/exclusion ===\n\n[[File:Str profile (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|A single source profile showing two allele at the vWA locus.]]\n[[File:STR electropherogram of a three person mixture (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|A three-person mixture showing four alleles at the vWA locus.]]\nCombined probability of inclusion or exclusion calculates the probability that a random, unrelated, person would be a contributor to a DNA profile or DNA mixture. In this method, statistics for each individual locus is determined using population statistics and then combined to get the total CPI or CPE. These calculations are repeated for all available loci with all available data and then each value is multiplied together to get the total combined probability of inclusion or exclusion. Since the values are multiplied together, extremely small numbers can be achieved using CPI. CPI or CPE is considered an acceptable statistical calculation when a mixture is indicated. https://www.promega.com/-/media/files/resources/conference-proceedings/ishi-15/parentage-and-mixture-statistics-workshop/generalpopulationstats.pdf?la=en\n\n==== Example calculation for single source profile ====\n\nProbability of a Caucasian having a 16 allele at {{math|vWA {{=}} .10204}}\n\nProbability of a Caucasian having a 17 allele at {{math|vWA {{=}} .26276}}\n\nProbability of a Caucasian having both a 14 and a 17 allele {{math|(P) {{=}} .10204 + .26276 {{=}} .3648}}\n\nProbability of all other alleles being present {{math|(Q) {{=}} 1 - P}} or {{math|1 - .3648 {{=}} .6352}}\n\nProbability of exclusion for {{math|vWA {{=}} Q<sup>2</sup> + 2Q(1-Q)}} or {{math|.6352<sup>2</sup> + 2(.6352)(1 - .6352) {{=}} .86692096 \u2248 86.69%}}\n\nProbability of inclusion for {{math|vWA {{=}} 1 - CPE}} or {{math|1 - .86692096 {{=}} .13307904 \u2248 13.31%}}\n\n==== Example calculation for mixture profile ====\n\nProbability of a Caucasian having a 14 allele at {{math|vWA {{=}} .10204}}\n\nProbability of a Caucasian having a 15 allele at {{math|vWA {{=}} .11224}}\n\nProbability of a Caucasian having a 16 allele at {{math|vWA {{=}} .20153}}\n\nProbability of a Caucasian having a 19 allele at {{math|vWA {{=}} .08418}}\n\nProbability of a Caucasian having a 14, 15, 16, or 19 allele {{math|(P) {{=}} .10204 + .11224 + .20153 + .08418 {{=}} .49999}}\n\nProbability of all other alleles being present {{math|(Q) {{=}} 1 - P}} or {{math|1 - .49999 {{=}} .50001}}\n\nProbability of exclusion for {{math|vWA {{=}} Q<sup>2</sup> + 2Q(1-Q)}} or {{math|.50001<sup>2</sup> + 2(.50001)(1 - .50001) {{=}} .7500099999 \u2248 75%}}\n\nProbability of inclusion for {{math|vWA {{=}} 1 - CPE}} or {{math|1 - .7500099999 {{=}} .2499900001 \u2248 25%}}\n\n=== Likelihood ratio ===\n\nLikelihood ratios (LR) are a comparison of two different probabilities to determine which one is more likely. When it involves a trial the LR is the probability of the prosecution's argument versus the probability of the defense's argument given their starting assumptions. In this scenario the prosecution's probability is often equal to 1 since the assumption is that the prosecution would not prosecute a suspect unless they were absolutely certain (100%) that they have the right person. Likelihood ratios are becoming more common in laboratories due to their usefulness in presenting statistics for data that indicates multiple contributors as well as their use in [[probabilistic genotyping software]] that predicts the most likely allele combinations given a set of data.\n\nThe drawbacks with using likelihood ratios is that they are very difficult to understand how analysts arrived at a specific value and the mathematics involved get very complicated as more data is introduced to the equations. In order to combat these problems in a courtroom setting, some laboratories have set up a \"verbal scale\" that replaces the actual numeral value of the likelihood ratio.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Jeffreys\">{{cite web | title=Eureka moment that led to the discovery of DNA fingerprinting | last=McKie | first=Robin | date=May 23, 2009 | accessdate=October 29, 2017 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/may/24/dna-fingerprinting-alec-jeffreys | website=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"RFLP1\">{{cite web | title=DNA Typing by RFLP Analysis | publisher=National Forensic Science Technology Center | date=2005 | url=http://www.nfstc.org:80/pdi/Subject01/pdi_s01_m02_01.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103014653/http://www.nfstc.org/pdi/Subject01/pdi_s01_m02_01.htm | archive-date=January 3, 2015 | accessdate=November 10, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gel\">{{cite book | page=240 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hmz797eX5DQC&pg=PA240&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlgf_nnbfXAhVF9IMKHVASCloQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&f=false | title=Techniques of Crime Scene Investigation | last=Fisher | first=Barry A.

DNA analysis methods have changed numerous times over the years as technology improves and allows for more information to be determined with less starting material. Modern DNA analysis is based on the statistical calculation of the rarity of the produced profile within a population.\n\nWhile most well known as a tool in forensic investigations, DNA profiling can also be used for non-forensic purposes. [[DNA paternity testing|Paternity testing]], and human [[Genetic genealogy|genealogy]] research are just two of the non-forensic uses of DNA profiling.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe methods for producing a DNA profile were developed by [[Alec Jeffreys]] and his team in 1984.<ref name=\"Jeffreys\" />\n\n== Methods ==\n\n=== Retired methods ===\n\n==== RFLP analysis ====\n[[File:D1S80Demo.png|thumb|right|Six individuals with different number of repeats at one location in their genome shown on a gel.]]\n{{see also|Restriction fragment length polymorphism}}\n\nThe first true method of DNA profiling was restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The first use of RFLP analysis in forensic casework was in 1985 in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"RFLP1\" /> This type of analysis used [[variable number tandem repeat]]s (VNTRs) to distinguish between individuals. VNTRs are common throughout the genome and consist of the same DNA sequence repeated again and again.<ref name=\"VNTRcommon\" /> Different individuals can have a different number of repeats at a specific location in the genome.<ref name=\"RFLP1\" /> For example, person A could have four while person B could have 5 repeats. The differences were visualized through a process called [[Gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids|gel electrophoresis]]. Smaller fragments would travel farther through the gel than larger fragments separating them out.<ref name=\"Gel\" /> These differences were used to distinguish between individuals and when multiple VNTR sites were run together, RFLP analysis has a high degree of individualizing power.<ref name=\"RFLPind\" />\n\nThe process of RFLP analysis was extremely time consuming and due to the length of the repeats used, between 9 and 100 base pairs,<ref name=\"VNTRcommon\" /><ref name=\"Ashort\" /> amplification methods such as the [[polymerase chain reaction]] could not be used. This limited RFLP to samples that already had a larger quantity of DNA available to start with and did not perform well with degraded samples.<ref name=\"RFLPbad\" /> RFLP analysis was the primary type of analysis performed in most forensic laboratories before finally being retired and replaced by newer methods. It was fully abandoned by the [[FBI]] in 2000 and replaced with STR analysis.<ref name=\"DQdate\" />\n\n==== DQ alpha testing ====\n{{see also|HLA-DQA1}}\n[[File:DQ alpha 1 testing strip.png|thumb|right|A DQ alpha testing strip showing a positive result. The filled in dots represent the allele values for that sample.]]\n\nDeveloped in 1991,<ref name=\"DQdate\" /> DQ alpha testing was the first forensic DNA technique that utilized the polymerase chain reaction.<ref name=\"DQA1\" /> This technique allowed for the use of far fewer cells than RFLP analysis making it more useful for crime scenes that did not have the large amounts of DNA material that was previously required.<ref name=\"DQ vs RFLP\" /> The DQ alpha 1 [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] (or location) was also [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] and had multiple different [[allele]]s that could be used to limit the pool of individuals that could have produced that result and increasing the probability of exclusion.<ref name=\"DQApoly\" />\n\nThe DQ alpha locus was combined with other loci in a commercially available kit called Polymarker in 1993.<ref name=\"Polymarker\" /> Polymarker was a precursor to modern [[Multiplex (assay)|multiplexing]] kits and allowed multiple different loci to be examined with one product. While more sensitive than RFLP analysis, Polymarker did not contain the same discriminatory power as the older RFLP testing.<ref name=\"Polymarker\" /> By 1995, scientists attempted to return to a VNTR based analysis combined with PCR technology called amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AmpFLP).<ref name=\"DQdate\" />\n\n==== AmpFLP ====\n[[File:AmpFLP gel of D1S80 locus.png|thumb|right|An [[Agarose gel electrophoresis|agarose gel]] showing the D1S80 locus ran in multiple lanes using AmpFLP.]]\n{{see also|Amplified fragment length polymorphism}}\n\nAmpFLP was the first attempt to couple VNTR analysis with PCR for forensic casework. This method used shorter VNTRs than RFLP analysis, between 8 and 16 base pairs. The shorter base pair sizes of AmpFLP was designed to work better with the amplification process of PCR.<ref name=\"Ashort\" /> It was hoped that this technique would allow for the discriminating power of RFLP analysis with the ability to process samples that have less template DNA to work with or which were otherwise degraded. However, only a few loci were validated for forensic applications to work with AmpFLP analysis  as forensic labs quickly moved on to other techniques limited its discriminating ability for forensic samples.<ref name=\"AFLPval\" />\n\nThe technique was ultimately never widely used although it is still in use in smaller countries due to its lower cost and simpler setup compared to newer methods.<ref name=\"AmpFLP\" /><ref name=\"FLPsmall\" /> By the late 1990s, laboratories began switching over to newer methods including STR analysis. These used even shorter fragments of DNA and could more reliably be amplified using PCR while still maintaining, and improving, the discriminatory power of the older methods.<ref name=\"DQdate\" />\n\n=== Current methods ===\n\n==== STR analysis ====\n{{main|STR analysis}}\n[[File:Str profile.jpg|thumb|right|A partial [[electropherogram]] produced through STR analysis.]]\n\nShort tandem repeat (STR) analysis is the primary type of forensic DNA analysis performed in modern DNA laboratories. STR analysis builds upon RFLP and AmpFLP used in the past by shrinking the size of the repeat units, to 2 to 6 base pairs, and by combining multiple different loci into one PCR reaction. These multiplexing assay kits can produce allele values for dozens of different loci throughout the genome simultaneously limiting the amount of time it takes to gain a full, individualizing, profile. STR analysis has become the gold standard for DNA profiling and is used extensively in forensic applications.\n\nSTR analysis can also be restricted to just the [[Y chromosome]]. [[Y-STR]] analysis can be used in cases that involve paternity or in [[familial searching]] as the Y chromosome is identical down the paternal line (except in cases where a [[mutation]] occurred). Certain multiplexing kits combine both autosomal and Y-STR loci into one kit further reducing the amount of time it takes to obtain a large amount of data.\n\n==== mtDNA sequencing ====\n{{see also|Mitochondrial DNA}}\n\nMitochondrial DNA sequencing is a specialized technique that uses the separate mitochondrial DNA present in most cells. This DNA is passed down the material line and is not unique between individuals. However, because of the number of mitochondria present in cells, mtDNA analysis can be used for highly degraded samples or samples where STR analysis would not produce enough data to be useful. mtDNA is also present in locations where autosomal DNA would be absent, such as in the shafts of hair.\n\nBecause of the increased chance of contamination when dealing with mtDNA, few laboratories process mitochondrial samples. Those that do have specialized protocols in place that further separate different samples from each other to avoid cross-contamination.\n\n==== Rapid DNA ====\n{{main|Rapid DNA}}\n\nRapid DNA is a \"swab in-profile out\" technology that completely automates the entire DNA extraction, amplification, and analysis process. Rapid DNA instruments are able to go from a swab to a DNA profile in as little as 90 minutes and eliminates the need for trained scientists to perform the process. These instruments are being looked at for use in the offender booking process allowing police officers to obtain the DNA profile of the person under arrest.\n\nRecently, the [[Rapid DNA Act of 2017]] was passed in the United States, directing the FBI to create protocols for the implementation of this technology throughout the country. Currently, DNA obtained from these instruments is not eligible for upload to national DNA databases as they do not analyze enough loci to meet the standard threshold. However, multiple police agencies already use Rapid DNA instruments to collect samples from people arrested in their area. These local DNA database are not subject to federal or state regulations.\n\n==== Massively parallel sequencing ====\n{{main|Massive parallel sequencing}}\n\nAlso known as next-generation sequencing, massively parallel sequencing (MPS) builds upon STR analysis by introducing direct sequencing of the loci. Instead of the number of repeats present at each location, MPS would give the scientist the actual base pair sequence. Theoretically MPS has the ability to distinguish between identical twins as random point mutations would be seen within repeat segments that would not be picked up by traditional STR analysis.\n\n== Profile rarity ==\n\nWhen a DNA profile is used in an evidentiary manner a match statistic is provided that explains how rare a profile is within a population. Specifically, this statistic is the probability that a person picked randomly out of a population would have that specific DNA profile. It is not the probability that the profile [[prosecutor's fallacy|\"matches\" someone]]. There are multiple different methods to determining this statistic and each are used by various laboratories based on their experience and preference. However, likelihood ratio calculations is becoming the preferred method over the other two most commonly used methods, random man not excluded and combined probability of inclusion. Match statistics are especially important in mixture interpretation where there is more than one contributor to a DNA profile. When these statistics are given in a courtroom setting or in a laboratory report they are usually given for the three most common races of that specific area. This is because the allele frequencies at different loci changed based on the individual's ancestry. https://strbase.nist.gov/training/6_Mixture-Statistics.pdf\n\n=== Random man not excluded ===\n{{main|Random man not excluded}}\n\nThe probability produced with this method is the probability that a person randomly selected out the population could not be excluded from the analyzed data. This type of match statistic is easy to explain in a courtroom setting to individuals who have no scientific background but it also loses a lot of discriminating power as it does not take into account the suspect's genotype. This approach is commonly used when the sample is degraded or contains so many contributors that a singular profile cannot be determined. It is also useful in explaining to laypersons as the method of obtaining the statistic is straightforward. However, due to its limited discriminating power, RMNE is not generally performed unless no other method can be used. RMNE is not recommended for use in data that indicates a mixture is present.\n\n=== Combined probability of inclusion/exclusion ===\n\n[[File:Str profile (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|A single source profile showing two allele at the vWA locus.]]\n[[File:STR electropherogram of a three person mixture (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|A three-person mixture showing four alleles at the vWA locus.]]\nCombined probability of inclusion or exclusion calculates the probability that a random, unrelated, person would be a contributor to a DNA profile or DNA mixture. In this method, statistics for each individual locus is determined using population statistics and then combined to get the total CPI or CPE. These calculations are repeated for all available loci with all available data and then each value is multiplied together to get the total combined probability of inclusion or exclusion. Since the values are multiplied together, extremely small numbers can be achieved using CPI. CPI or CPE is considered an acceptable statistical calculation when a mixture is indicated. https://www.promega.com/-/media/files/resources/conference-proceedings/ishi-15/parentage-and-mixture-statistics-workshop/generalpopulationstats.pdf?la=en\n\n==== Example calculation for single source profile ====\n\nProbability of a Caucasian having a 16 allele at {{math|vWA {{=}} .10204}}\n\nProbability of a Caucasian having a 17 allele at {{math|vWA {{=}} .26276}}\n\nProbability of a Caucasian having both a 14 and a 17 allele {{math|(P) {{=}} .10204 + .26276 {{=}} .3648}}\n\nProbability of all other alleles being present {{math|(Q) {{=}} 1 - P}} or {{math|1 - .3648 {{=}} .6352}}\n\nProbability of exclusion for {{math|vWA {{=}} Q<sup>2</sup> + 2Q(1-Q)}} or {{math|.6352<sup>2</sup> + 2(.6352)(1 - .6352) {{=}} .86692096 \u2248 86.69%}}\n\nProbability of inclusion for {{math|vWA {{=}} 1 - CPE}} or {{math|1 - .86692096 {{=}} .13307904 \u2248 13.31%}}\n\n==== Example calculation for mixture profile ====\n\nProbability of a Caucasian having a 14 allele at {{math|vWA {{=}} .10204}}\n\nProbability of a Caucasian having a 15 allele at {{math|vWA {{=}} .11224}}\n\nProbability of a Caucasian having a 16 allele at {{math|vWA {{=}} .20153}}\n\nProbability of a Caucasian having a 19 allele at {{math|vWA {{=}} .08418}}\n\nProbability of a Caucasian having a 14, 15, 16, or 19 allele {{math|(P) {{=}} .10204 + .11224 + .20153 + .08418 {{=}} .49999}}\n\nProbability of all other alleles being present {{math|(Q) {{=}} 1 - P}} or {{math|1 - .49999 {{=}} .50001}}\n\nProbability of exclusion for {{math|vWA {{=}} Q<sup>2</sup> + 2Q(1-Q)}} or {{math|.50001<sup>2</sup> + 2(.50001)(1 - .50001) {{=}} .7500099999 \u2248 75%}}\n\nProbability of inclusion for {{math|vWA {{=}} 1 - CPE}} or {{math|1 - .7500099999 {{=}} .2499900001 \u2248 25%}}\n\n=== Likelihood ratio ===\n\nLikelihood ratios (LR) are a comparison of two different probabilities to determine which one is more likely. When it involves a trial the LR is the probability of the prosecution's argument versus the probability of the defense's argument given their starting assumptions. In this scenario the prosecution's probability is often equal to 1 since the assumption is that the prosecution would not prosecute a suspect unless they were absolutely certain (100%) that they have the right person. Likelihood ratios are becoming more common in laboratories due to their usefulness in presenting statistics for data that indicates multiple contributors as well as their use in [[probabilistic genotyping software]] that predicts the most likely allele combinations given a set of data.\n\nThe drawbacks with using likelihood ratios is that they are very difficult to understand how analysts arrived at a specific value and the mathematics involved get very complicated as more data is introduced to the equations. In order to combat these problems in a courtroom setting, some laboratories have set up a \"verbal scale\" that replaces the actual numeral value of the likelihood ratio.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Jeffreys\">{{cite web | title=Eureka moment that led to the discovery of DNA fingerprinting | last=McKie | first=Robin | date=May 23, 2009 | accessdate=October 29, 2017 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/may/24/dna-fingerprinting-alec-jeffreys | website=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"RFLP1\">{{cite web | title=DNA Typing by RFLP Analysis | publisher=National Forensic Science Technology Center | date=2005 | url=http://www.nfstc.org:80/pdi/Subject01/pdi_s01_m02_01.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103014653/http://www.nfstc.org/pdi/Subject01/pdi_s01_m02_01.htm | archive-date=January 3, 2015 | accessdate=November 10, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gel\">{{cite book | page=240 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hmz797eX5DQC&pg=PA240&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlgf_nnbfXAhVF9IMKHVASCloQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&f=false | title=Techniques of Crime Scene Investigation | last=Fisher | first=Barry A.

Chinese use both black and yellow soybeans to produce [[Douchi|\u8c49]](ch\u01d0) whereas Japanese ''natt\u014d'' only uses yellow soybeans.

''Natt\u014d'' is known to be popular in the eastern [[Kant\u014d region]], but less popular in [[Kansai]]. A 2009 Internet survey in Japan indicated 70.2% of respondents like ''natt\u014d'' and 29.8% do not, but out of the 29.8% who dislike ''natt\u014d'', about half of them eat ''natt\u014d'' for its health benefits.<ref name=\"navi16\"/>\n\n==Production process==\n[[Image:Soybean.USDA.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Soybeans in a plantation]]\n''Natt\u014d'' is made from soybeans, typically ''natt\u014d'' soybeans. Smaller beans are preferred, as the fermentation process will be able to reach the center of the bean more easily. The beans are washed and soaked in water for 12 to 20 hours to increase their size. Next, the soybeans are [[Steaming|steamed]] for 6 hours, although a [[Pressure cooking|pressure cooker]] may be used to reduce the time. The beans are mixed with the bacterium ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'', known as ''natt\u014d-kin'' in Japanese. From this point on, care must be taken to keep the ingredients away from impurities and other [[bacteria]]. The mixture is fermented at {{convert|40|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for up to 24 hours. Afterward, the ''natt\u014d'' is cooled, then aged in a refrigerator for up to one week to allow the development of stringiness.\n\nIn ''natt\u014d''-making facilities, these processing steps have to be done while avoiding incidents in which soybeans are touched by workers. Even though workers use ''B. subtilis natto'' as the starting culture, which can suppress some undesired bacterial growth, workers pay extra-close attention not to introduce [[skin flora]] on to soy beans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.natto.in/koutei.php |title=\u7d0d\u8c46\u304c\u51fa\u6765\u308b\u307e\u3067\u3002\u7d0d\u8c46\u306e\u88fd\u9020\u5de5\u7a0b |publisher=Natto.in |year=2004 |accessdate=2013-09-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201234655/http://www.natto.in/koutei.php |archive-date=2014-02-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nTo make ''natt\u014d'' at home, a bacterial culture of ''B. subtilis'' is needed. ''B. subtilis natto'' is weak in lactic acid, so it is important to prevent lactic acid bacteria from breeding. Some ''B. subtilis natto'' varieties that are closer to odorless are usually less active, raising the possibility that minor germs will breed. [[Bacteriophage]]s are dangerous to ''B. subtilis''.\n\nHistorically, ''natt\u014d'' was made by storing the steamed soybeans in rice straw, which naturally contains ''B. subtilis natto''. The soybeans were packed in straw and left to ferment.\n\n==End product and nutrition==\n{{medref|section|date=June 2019}}\n[[Image:natto boxed.jpg|thumb|''Natt\u014d'' is sold in small containers with small packets of soy sauce and mustard.]]\n\n[[Mass-produced]] ''natt\u014d'' is sold in small [[polystyrene]] containers.

Chinese use both black and yellow soybeans to produce [[Douchi|\u8c49]](ch\u01d0) whereas Japanese ''natt\u014d'' only uses yellow soybeans.

This is called ''hikiwari natt\u014d''.\n\nMany find the taste unpleasant and smelly while others relish it as a delicacy. Natt\u014d is more popular in some areas of Japan than in others. ''Natt\u014d'' is known to be popular in the eastern [[Kant\u014d region]], but less popular in [[Kansai]]. A 2009 Internet survey in Japan indicated 70.2% of respondents like ''natt\u014d'' and 29.8% do not, but out of the 29.8% who dislike ''natt\u014d'', about half of them eat ''natt\u014d'' for its health benefits.<ref name=\"navi16\"/>\n\n==Production process==\n[[Image:Soybean.USDA.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Soybeans in a plantation]]\n''Natt\u014d'' is made from soybeans, typically ''natt\u014d'' soybeans. Smaller beans are preferred, as the fermentation process will be able to reach the center of the bean more easily. The beans are washed and soaked in water for 12 to 20 hours to increase their size. Next, the soybeans are [[Steaming|steamed]] for 6 hours, although a [[Pressure cooking|pressure cooker]] may be used to reduce the time. The beans are mixed with the bacterium ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'', known as ''natt\u014d-kin'' in Japanese. From this point on, care must be taken to keep the ingredients away from impurities and other [[bacteria]]. The mixture is fermented at {{convert|40|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for up to 24 hours. Afterward, the ''natt\u014d'' is cooled, then aged in a refrigerator for up to one week to allow the development of stringiness.\n\nIn ''natt\u014d''-making facilities, these processing steps have to be done while avoiding incidents in which soybeans are touched by workers. Even though workers use ''B. subtilis natto'' as the starting culture, which can suppress some undesired bacterial growth, workers pay extra-close attention not to introduce [[skin flora]] on to soy beans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.natto.in/koutei.php |title=\u7d0d\u8c46\u304c\u51fa\u6765\u308b\u307e\u3067\u3002\u7d0d\u8c46\u306e\u88fd\u9020\u5de5\u7a0b |publisher=Natto.in |year=2004 |accessdate=2013-09-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201234655/http://www.natto.in/koutei.php |archive-date=2014-02-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nTo make ''natt\u014d'' at home, a bacterial culture of ''B. subtilis'' is needed. ''B. subtilis natto'' is weak in lactic acid, so it is important to prevent lactic acid bacteria from breeding. Some ''B. subtilis natto'' varieties that are closer to odorless are usually less active, raising the possibility that minor germs will breed. [[Bacteriophage]]s are dangerous to ''B. subtilis''.\n\nHistorically, ''natt\u014d'' was made by storing the steamed soybeans in rice straw, which naturally contains ''B. subtilis natto''. The soybeans were packed in straw and left to ferment.\n\n==End product and nutrition==\n{{medref|section|date=June 2019}}\n[[Image:natto boxed.jpg|thumb|''Natt\u014d'' is sold in small containers with small packets of soy sauce and mustard.]]\n\n[[Mass-produced]] ''natt\u014d'' is sold in small [[polystyrene]] containers.

One of its cardinal legates was [[Reginald Pole]], around whom there grew up at Viterbo a coterie of friends, [[Vittoria Colonna]] among them, who aroused suspicions of heterodoxy. After 1628 Viterbo was the residence again of a simple governor.\n\nOn 2 May 1936 the diocese of Viterbo e Toscanella gained territory from the suppressed Territorial Abbacy of San Martino al Monte Cimino.<ref>Pius XI, bull [http://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-28-1936-ocr.pdf Bolla \"Ad maius christiani\"], {{in lang|la}} ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' Vol. 28 (Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano 1936), p.&nbsp;394.</ref>\n\n===Restructuring===\n\nThe [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962\u20131965), in order to ensure that all Catholics received proper spiritual attention, decreed the reorganization of the diocesan structure of Italy and the consolidation of small and struggling dioceses. It also recommended the abolition of anomalous units such as exempt territorial prelatures.<ref>In its decree ''Christus Dominus'', section 22, it stated: \"Concerning diocesan boundaries, therefore, this sacred synod decrees that, to the extent required by the good of souls, a fitting revision of diocesan boundaries be undertaken prudently and as soon as possible. This can be done by dividing dismembering or uniting them, or by changing their boundaries, or by determining a better place for the episcopal see or, finally, especially in the case of dioceses having larger cities, by providing them with a new internal organization.... At the same time the natural population units of people, together with the civil jurisdictions and social institutions that compose their organic structure, should be preserved as far as possible as units. For this reason, obviously, the territory of each diocese should be continuous.\"</ref> These considerations applied to Viterbo and the other dioceses governed by its bishop.\n\nOn 18 February 1984, the Vatican and the Italian State signed a new and revised concordat. Based on the revisions, a set of ''Normae'' was issued on 15 November 1984, which was accompanied in the next year, on 3 June 1985, by enabling legislation. According to the agreement, the practice of having one bishop govern two separate dioceses at the same time, ''aeque personaliter'', was abolished. Instead, the Vatican continued consultations which had begun under [[Pope John XXIII]] for the merging of small dioceses, especially those with personnel and financial problems, into one combined diocese.\n\nBy 1986, papal policy in the selection of bishops had concentrated in the person of Bishop Luigi Boccadoro  the [[Diocese of Viterbo e Tuscania]], the diocese of [[Diocese of Acquapendente|Acquapendente]] (since 1951), the diocese of Montefiascone (since 1951), and the Administratorship of the diocese of Bagnoregio (since 1971); he was also the Abbot Commendatory of Monte Cimino. On 27 March 1986, by the bull \"Qui Non Sine\", [[Pope John Paul II]] moved to consolidate these several small dioceses by suppressing them and uniting their territories<ref>\"in unam dioecesim iuridice redigeremus, satis enim eas coeptis, institutis, moribus, mente coaluisse....perpetuo unimus, unione, ut dicunt, exstinctiva; quae proinde adquiret atque comprehendet in suo territorio uniuscuiusque harum Ecclesiarum territorium\"</ref> into the diocese of Viterbo e Tuscania, whose name was changed to the Diocese of Viterbo. There was to be only one cathedral, in Viterbo. The cathedrals in Acquapendente, Montefiascone and Bagnoregio were to become co-cathedrals, and the cathedral Chapters were each to be a ''Capitulum Concathedralis''. There was to be only one diocesan Tribunal, in Viterbo, and likewise one seminary (the regional papal seminary), one College of Consultors, and one Priests' Council. All the priests of all the dioceses were to be incardinated in the diocese of Viterbo.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-78-1986-ocr.pdf ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' Vol. 78] (Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano: Typis polyglottis vaticanis 1986), pp. 906-907.</ref>\n\n===Diocesan synods===\n\nThe [[Fourth Lateran Council]] (1216) decreed that provincial synods should be held annually in each ecclesiastical province, and that each diocese should hold annual diocesan synods.<ref>Capitula, VI.

It also recommended the abolition of anomalous units such as exempt territorial prelatures.<ref>In its decree ''Christus Dominus'', section 22, it stated: \"Concerning diocesan boundaries, therefore, this sacred synod decrees that, to the extent required by the good of souls, a fitting revision of diocesan boundaries be undertaken prudently and as soon as possible. This can be done by dividing dismembering or uniting them, or by changing their boundaries, or by determining a better place for the episcopal see or, finally, especially in the case of dioceses having larger cities, by providing them with a new internal organization.... At the same time the natural population units of people, together with the civil jurisdictions and social institutions that compose their organic structure, should be preserved as far as possible as units. For this reason, obviously, the territory of each diocese should be continuous.\"</ref> These considerations applied to Viterbo and the other dioceses governed by its bishop.\n\nOn 18 February 1984, the Vatican and the Italian State signed a new and revised concordat. Based on the revisions, a set of ''Normae'' was issued on 15 November 1984, which was accompanied in the next year, on 3 June 1985, by enabling legislation. According to the agreement, the practice of having one bishop govern two separate dioceses at the same time, ''aeque personaliter'', was abolished. Instead, the Vatican continued consultations which had begun under [[Pope John XXIII]] for the merging of small dioceses, especially those with personnel and financial problems, into one combined diocese.\n\nBy 1986, papal policy in the selection of bishops had concentrated in the person of Bishop Luigi Boccadoro  the [[Diocese of Viterbo e Tuscania]], the diocese of [[Diocese of Acquapendente|Acquapendente]] (since 1951), the diocese of Montefiascone (since 1951), and the Administratorship of the diocese of Bagnoregio (since 1971); he was also the Abbot Commendatory of Monte Cimino. On 27 March 1986, by the bull \"Qui Non Sine\", [[Pope John Paul II]] moved to consolidate these several small dioceses by suppressing them and uniting their territories<ref>\"in unam dioecesim iuridice redigeremus, satis enim eas coeptis, institutis, moribus, mente coaluisse....perpetuo unimus, unione, ut dicunt, exstinctiva; quae proinde adquiret atque comprehendet in suo territorio uniuscuiusque harum Ecclesiarum territorium\"</ref> into the diocese of Viterbo e Tuscania, whose name was changed to the Diocese of Viterbo. There was to be only one cathedral, in Viterbo. The cathedrals in Acquapendente, Montefiascone and Bagnoregio were to become co-cathedrals, and the cathedral Chapters were each to be a ''Capitulum Concathedralis''. There was to be only one diocesan Tribunal, in Viterbo, and likewise one seminary (the regional papal seminary), one College of Consultors, and one Priests' Council. All the priests of all the dioceses were to be incardinated in the diocese of Viterbo.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-78-1986-ocr.pdf ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' Vol. 78] (Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano: Typis polyglottis vaticanis 1986), pp. 906-907.</ref>\n\n===Diocesan synods===\n\nThe [[Fourth Lateran Council]] (1216) decreed that provincial synods should be held annually in each ecclesiastical province, and that each diocese should hold annual diocesan synods.<ref>Capitula, VI.
