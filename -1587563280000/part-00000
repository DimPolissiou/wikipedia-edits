During the weakening of the authority of the caliphs after 861, their rule in Jibal became increasingly independent of the central government in [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]]. In the last decade of the 9th century, however, they were defeated by the Abbasids who proceeded to reincorporate Jibal into their empire.\n\n==History==\n\nThe Dulafids belonged to the Arab tribe of 'Ejl ibn Lojaym, who was among the vanguard of the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Muslim conquest]] of [[Iraq]].{{sfn|Donner|1995|pp=476\u2013477}} The exact line of descent of the family is disputed among various sources, but the first members that can be reliably dated were the trader Idris and his brother Isa, sons of Ma'qel, residing in [[Kufa]] in the time of the [[Umayyad]] caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] (ruled 724\u2013743).{{sfn|Donner|1995|pp=476\u2013477}} The brothers were imprisoned by the Umayyad authorities, but the exact reason is unclear: either a trade dispute, or, according to [[al-Baladhuri]], support for the [[Abbasid]] cause. Various sources report even that [[Abu Muslim]], the eventual leader of the [[Abbasid Revolution]], was originally a servant of the Dulafids until he was purchased by the Abbasid family, but these claims may well be later inventions to enhance their standing.{{sfn|Donner|1995|pp=476\u2013477}}\n\nIdris eventually amassed some wealth, and later moved to the [[Zagros Mountains|Zagros region]], buying land at Mass near [[Hamadan]] and settling there.{{sfn|Donner|1995|pp=476\u2013477}} His son Isa, however, moved with his sons to [[Isfahan]], where they resorted to highway robbery according to [[al-Sam'ani]]. Eventually, sometime in the reign of [[al-Mahdi]] (r. 775\u2013785), they adopted a more legitimate lifestyle and settled in [[Karahrud|Karaj]]. Over time their holdings around Karaj became extensive, and by the 9th century they possessed large tracts of cultivated land, palaces and fortresses.{{sfn|Donner|1995|pp=476\u2013477}}{{sfn|Marin|1991|p=623}}\n\nThe first Dulafid to become governor of Jibal was Isa's son [[Abu Dulaf al-Ijli]], who was appointed to the position by the caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] (r. 786\u2013809).{{sfn|Donner|1995|pp=476\u2013477}} Abu Dulaf was distinguished for his learning, competence and integrity, so that although he sided with Harun al-Rashid's successor [[al-Amin]] (r. 809\u2013813) in the [[Fourth Fitna|civil war]] against the latter's brother [[al-Ma'mun]] (r. 813\u2013832), and despite his well-known [[Shi'ite]] beliefs, he was pardoned after the defeat of al-Amin and retained his post.{{sfn|Donner|1995|pp=476\u2013477}}{{sfn|Marin|1991|p=623}} He maintained especially good relations with al-Ma'mun's successor [[al-Mu'tasim]] (r. 832\u2013842), serving him both as military commander against the [[Khurramites]] and as governor (with a possible appointment to [[Jund Dimashq|Damascus]]), and even became the Caliph's drinking companion, and dying in [[Baghdad]] in 839/40.{{sfn|Donner|1995|pp=476\u2013477}} His brother Ma'qel was also a member of the Abbasid court, serving as a military commander and earning some distinction as a poet.{{sfn|Donner|1995|pp=476\u2013477}}\n\nAbu Dulaf's long rule firmly established his family's authority in Jibal; the Dulafids received hereditary possession of their domains\u2014known as ''al-Igharayn'', \"the two fiefs\"\u2014in perpetuity, ruling almost independent of the caliphal government, except for an annual tribute, and with the right to coin their own money.{{sfn|Marin|1991|p=623}} After Abu Dulaf's death, his son [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Abu Dulaf|Abd al-Aziz]] succeeded him in his position as governor of Jibal, while another brother, [[Hisham ibn Abu Dulaf|Hisham]], served the caliphal court as a general in ca. 865/66. As Abbasid authority in the peripheral provinces broke down in the 860s during the \"[[Anarchy at Samarra]]\", the Dulafids began to act increasingly as independent rulers, prompting the Abbasid government to launch two punitive campaigns in 867, one of which sacked the Dulafid stronghold of Karaj.{{sfn|Donner|1995|pp=476\u2013477}} The fate of Abd al-Aziz is unclear, but he likely remained in his post until his death in 873/74, after which the Abbasids recognized Abd al-Aziz's son [[Dulaf ibn Abd al-Aziz|Dulaf]], and, after Dulaf's death at Isfahan in 878/9, his brother [[Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz|Ahmad]], as governors.{{sfn|Donner|1995|pp=476\u2013477}}{{sfn|Marin|1991|p=623}}\n\nAhmad had a precarious and ambivalent relationship with the central Abbasid government, and played a major role in its relationship with the rising power of the [[Saffarids]].{{sfn|Donner|1995|pp=476\u2013477}} A subject of the Saffarid ruler [[Amr ibn al-Layth]] since 879, Ahmad sided with the Abbasids after the break between the Saffarids and the Abbasid regent, [[al-Muwaffaq]], in 884/85. He was appointed to the governorships of [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Kirman]], and dealt a heavy defeat onto [[Amr ibn al-Layth]] in 886, but then faced an invasion of his territory by al-Muwaffaq in 889/90, and was defeated by Amr in the next year.{{sfn|Donner|1995|pp=476\u2013477}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1975|pp=118\u2013120}} Later, the new Abbasid caliph, [[al-Mu'tadid]] (r. 892\u2013902) charged him with taking [[Rey, Iran|Rayy]] from the renegade general [[Rafi ibn Harthama]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1975|p=120}}\n\nAfter Ahmad's death in 893, however, al-Mu'tadid swiftly intervened in the succession disputes between Ahmad's sons, Bakr and Umar, to re-establish caliphal authority: in 894, the Caliph visited Jibal in person, and divided the Dulafid territories, giving the governorship of Rayy, [[Qazvin]], [[Qum]] and [[Hamadan]] to his own son [[Ali al-Muktafi]], while confining Umar to the Dulafid core region around Karaj and Isfahan. Finally, in 896 the Dulafids were deposed outright and a caliphal governor, [[Isa al-Nushari]], was installed at Isfahan.
