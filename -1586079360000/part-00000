Areas of influence include diet, writing, industry, education, language, law, lifestyle, politics, philosophy, religion, science and technology, culture, and value systems. More broadly, \"Sinicization\" may refer to policies of [[acculturation]], [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], or [[cultural imperialism]] imposed by [[China]] onto neighboring [[East Asia|East Asian countries]], and [[Ethnic minorities in China|minority ethnic groups]] inside China.  Evidence of this can be seen in the value systems, cuisine, [[Chinese architecture|architectural style]], and lexicons. This is reflected in the histories of [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] for example, in the [[adoption of Chinese literary culture|adoption of the Chinese writing system]] as [[Written Chinese|the script]] of the Han Chinese has long been a unifying feature in the [[Sinosphere]] as the vehicle for exporting Chinese culture to these Asian countries.\n\n==Integration==\nThe integration or assimilation policy is a type of [[nationalism]] aimed at strengthening of the Chinese identity among the population. Proponents believe integration will help to develop shared values, pride in being the country\u2019s citizen, respect and acceptance towards cultural differences among citizens of China. Critics argue that integration destroys [[ethnic diversity]], [[language diversity]], and [[cultural diversity]]. Analogous to [[North America]] with approximately 300 [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] and distinct ethnic groups; in China there are 292 non-Mandarin [[Languages of China|languages]] spoken by native peoples of the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/CN|title=China|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Ethnologue]]|language=en|access-date=2018-12-05}}</ref> There are also a number of [[Immigration to China|immigrant]] languages, such as [[Khmer language|Khmer]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[English language|English]], etc.\n\n==Historical examples of sinicization==\n===Austronesian peoples===\nBefore sinicization, non-Chinese indigenous peoples of [[South China|Southern China]], collectively termed by the Chinese as [[Baiyue]] inhabited the coastline of China from as far north as the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] to as far south as the [[Gulf of Tonkin]].  Analysis of DNA recovered from human remains shows high frequencies of [[Haplogroup O1]] in [[Liangzhu culture]] linking this culture to modern Austronesian populations. It is believed that Liangzhu culture was the ancestral homeland of Proto-Austronesian populations before they [[Austronesian hypothesis|spread to Taiwan]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. Over time, the southward spread of Han Chinese led to the sinicization of most of the Baiyue populations that remained in Southern China, whether in the [[Yangtze River valley|Yangtze Valley]] or in coastal areas from the mouth of the Yangtze to the [[Gulf of Tonkin]].<ref>{{cite book|title= Prehistoric Settlement of the Pacific, Volume 86, Part 5|url= https://books.google.com/?id=XiELAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA137&dq=in+the+southward+spread+of+Han+Chinese+led+to+the+sinicization+of+all+AN-speakers#v=onepage&q=in%20the%20southward%20spread%20of%20Han%20Chinese%20led%20to%20the%20sinicization%20of%20all%20AN-speakers&f=false|isbn = 9780871698650|last1 = Goodenough|first1 = Ward Hunt|year = 1996}}</ref> The remnants of these peoples who were not fully sinicized are now recognized officially as the [[Ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minorities]] of the [[China|PRC]].\n\n===Turkic peoples===\n{{main|Taoyuan County, Hunan#Taoyuan Uyghurs}}\n\nDescendants of [[Uyghurs]] who migrated to [[Taoyuan County, Hunan]] have largely assimilated into the Han Chinese and [[Hui people|Hui]] population and practice Chinese customs, speaking [[varieties of Chinese]] as their language.\n\n===Tang dynasty===\nDuring the 8th and 9th centuries in the [[Tang dynasty]], Chinese male soldiers moved into [[Guizhou]] ([[Chinese postal romanization|formerly romanized as]] Kweichow) and married native non-Chinese women, their descendants being known as ''Lao-han-jen'' (original Chinese), in contrast to new Chinese people who colonized Guizhou at later times.

Other times number names used the Manchu transcriptions of Chinese numbers, as in the name Loi\u0161ici (= Liushi qi, \"sixty-seven\"), Ba\u0161inu (= bashi wu, \"eight-five\").45 Such names, unheard of among the Han, were quite common among the Manchus, an appeared from time to time among Chinese bannermen. Popular curiosity about this odd custom in Qing was partly satisfied by the nineteenth-century bannerman-writer Fu-ge, who explained in his book of \"jottings\" that naming children for their grandparents' ages was a way of wishing longevity to the newly born.46|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&pg=PA243#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=0-8047-4684-2|page=243|title=The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China|edition=illustrated, reprint|author=Mark C.

Areas of influence include diet, writing, industry, education, language, law, lifestyle, politics, philosophy, religion, science and technology, culture, and value systems. More broadly, \"Sinicization\" may refer to policies of [[acculturation]], [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], or [[cultural imperialism]] imposed by [[China]] onto neighboring [[East Asia|East Asian countries]], and [[Ethnic minorities in China|minority ethnic groups]] inside China.  Evidence of this can be seen in the value systems, cuisine, [[Chinese architecture|architectural style]], and lexicons. This is reflected in the histories of [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] for example, in the [[adoption of Chinese literary culture|adoption of the Chinese writing system]] as [[Written Chinese|the script]] of the Han Chinese has long been a unifying feature in the [[Sinosphere]] as the vehicle for exporting Chinese culture to these Asian countries.\n\n==Integration==\nThe integration or assimilation policy is a type of [[nationalism]] aimed at strengthening of the Chinese identity among the population.

It is believed that Liangzhu culture was the ancestral homeland of Proto-Austronesian populations before they [[Austronesian hypothesis|spread to Taiwan]], and [[Southeast Asia]].

The $540 million investment in the Portsmouth facility is one of the largest private investments ever made in Virginia. The Commonwealth of Virginia is currently considering the proposal.\n\n==Governance==\nAs an agency of the Commonwealth, the Virginia Port Authority reports to the Virginia Secretary of Transportation. The Governor of Virginia appoints 11 citizens to form the Virginia Port Authority Board of Commissioners, and the state treasurer is an ''[[ex officio]]'' member of the Board. Commissioners serve staggered five year terms at the pleasure of the Governor, and no commissioner may serve more than two consecutive terms. Law dictates that there must be one, but no more than one, commissioner from [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] or [[Virginia Beach]]; one, but no more than one, commissioner from [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]] or [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]]; and one, but no more than one, commissioner from [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] or [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]].<ref name=\"Code of Virginia\">[https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-129/ Code of Virginia 1950 \u00a762.1-129].

Port operations are paid for using [[revenue]] generated by port activities, predominantly [[trade]]. The Port Authority does, however, receive state transportation money for capital projects, for such things as new wharfs and cranes. The agency receives 4.2 percent of the Commonwealth Transportation Trust Fund, a fund that's generated by fuel taxes, vehicle sales and use taxes, and some sales taxes. Such revenue is invested in maintaining and improving the facilities and in marketing the port to potential clients.\n\n==History {{Anchor|History}}==\n{{more citations needed|date=June 2012}}\n{{original research|date=June 2012}}\nThe Virginia Port Authority had its roots in the Virginia State Ports Authority, an agency of the Commonwealth created in 1952 that was responsible for operating the port terminals in the [[Hampton Roads]] [[harbor]]. Studies commissioned by the [[Virginia General Assembly]] during the 1970s and the early 1980s suggested that the port terminals should be consolidated under a single [[port authority]] that would manage the activities of the terminals while remaining under the authority of the General Assembly. Legislation changed the name of the Virginia State Ports Authority to the Virginia Port Authority to reflect the goal of integrating the ports. Virginia Senate Bill 548 mandated that the Virginia Port Authority complete the unification as swiftly as possible. In addition, the General Assembly revised the VPA's enabling legislation to allow the agency to subordinate local port cities, towns, and other entities; to acquire federal, state, and local property; and to provide for a [[tariff]].\n\nThe VPA purchased the terminals piecemeal. Portsmouth Marine Terminal became the first port to enter the unification program; the City of Portsmouth conveyed the port to the VPA in 1971. Later that same year, Newport News Marine Terminal (NNMT) was transferred to the VPA with the consent of its owner Peninsula Ports Authority (PPAV), its operator [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]], and the cities of Hampton and Newport News. The VPA acquired Norfolk International Terminals from the City of Norfolk in 1972.\n\nIn order to manage the consolidated marine terminal operations, Virginia International Terminals, Inc. was created in 1982. VIT not only systematized operations at the VPA's facilities, but also moved [[cargo]] more efficiently and strengthened the port's marketing program.\n\nTwo pieces of legislation in the 1980s aided the development of The Port of Virginia. The first, the Transportation Trust Fund, became the source for the Commonwealth Port Fund. The Commonwealth Port Fund was created by the General Assembly from a portion of the revenue generated by transportation [[taxes]] and [[fees]], and was transferred to the Board of Commissioners of the VPA to satisfy port capital needs within Virginia.\n\nThe second piece of legislation was the Water Resources Act of 1986, a federal cost-sharing initiative that provided for the [[dredging]] of all major U.S. [[river]] [[Channel (geography)|channels]] and [[waterways]]. The Hampton Roads harbor became the first to begin dredging under the new legislation, with the aim of deepening the outbound navigational channel from 45 to {{convert|50|ft|m}}. The project was completed in 1988 with the help of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]].\n\nIn 1989, the VPA opened the Virginia Inland Port, a $10 million intermodal facility in Front Royal, Virginia. The combination truck-and-rail terminal sits near the intersection of U.S. Interstate 81 and U.S. Interstate 66 and extends the VPA's activities to [[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], [[West Virginia]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref name=\"Port History\">The Virginia Port Authority. \"A History of Port Development, Port Growth, and Port Investment.\" 1995.</ref>\n\n==Norfolk International Terminals==\n[[File:Norfolk International Terminal.jpg|right|thumb|Norfolk International Terminal]]\n\nNorfolk International Terminals is the largest of the four facilities, with a land area of {{convert|648|acre|km2}}. The terminal has fifty-foot-deep entrance channels at the north and south ends. The terminal is serviced by {{convert|89300|ft|m}} of rail track and 11 Suez-class [[containerization|container]] [[crane (machine)|cranes]]. A marginal [[wharf]] measuring {{convert|5730|ft|m}} long provides five [[Berth (moorings)|berth]]s for vessels carrying [[containerization|containerized]], [[break bulk cargo|breakbulk]], and [[roll-on/roll-off]] cargoes. NIT provides 34,219 [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEUs]] of container storage space; {{convert|2340000|sqft|m2}} total of covered [[pier]], dry, and cold storage space; and space for 702 stacked truck [[chassis]]. NIT is accessible via Interstates 64, Insterstate 564, and Terminal Boulevard, and via rail serviced by [[Norfolk Southern Railway]], [[CSX Corporation]], and [[Eastern Shore Railroad]].<ref>The Virginia Port Authority. \"Norfolk International Terminals Cranes and Specifications.\" 2007.</ref>\n\nNIT was originally a surplus [[United States Army|Army]] [[Military base|base]] that the City of Norfolk purchased in 1965. The city outfitted the base with a container crane and put a one-berth container facility in service in addition to the breakbulk capacity already available. A second container berth and two more container cranes were added in the early 1970s.\n\nThe Virginia Port Authority used a $12 million appropriation from the General Assembly to acquire NIT on July 1, 1972. Slightly more than half the money went to pay obligations to the city and terminal; the remainder was dedicated to purchasing a fourth container crane, extending the container berth, and improving support structures.\n\nDuring the 1980s, NIT attracted the business of [[Nissan Motor Company]] and [[Evergreen Marine|Evergreen]]. To meet increasing demand, the VPA [[dredging|dredged]] deeper channels, added a fourth berth, built a {{convert|32000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} warehouse, purchased three high-speed gantry cranes, and paved another container storage area.<ref name=\"Port History\"/>\n\nThroughout the 1990s and 2000s, the VPA continued to expand the facilities, replace old cranes, and add new ones, until it reached its present capacity. On July 16, 2008, the three newest, and largest, cranes were delivered to the terminal.\n\n==Portsmouth Marine Terminal==\nPortsmouth Marine Terminal is the second largest of the four facilities, with a land area of {{convert|219|acre|km2}}. The terminal has a forty-five-foot-deep main channel. The terminal is serviced by {{convert|20100|ft|m}} of rail track, six [[containerization|container]] [[crane (machine)|cranes]], and one [[gantry crane]]. A marginal [[wharf]] measuring {{convert|3540|ft|m}} long provides three [[Berth (moorings)|berth]]s for vessels carrying [[containerization|containerized]], [[break bulk cargo|breakbulk]], and [[roll-on/roll-off]] cargoes. PMT provides 33,786 [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEUs]] of container storage space; {{convert|94471|sqft|m2}} of dry storage space; and space for 260 [[Refrigerated container|reefer]] receptacles. PMT is accessible via U.S. Route 58, which is connected to Interstates 95, 64, and 664; and via rail serviced by [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] and [[CSX Transportation]].<ref>The Virginia Port Authority. \"Portsmouth Marine Terminal Cranes and Specifications.\" 2007.</ref>\n\nMost of PMT was built upon reclaimed land containing [[dredging|dredged]] material from the construction of the [[Midtown Tunnel (Virginia)|Midtown Tunnel]]. The terminal began, in part, as a port owned by a railroad that served Pinner's Point. The Virginia State Ports Authority purchased the facility, but in 1965 leased a portion of it to the City of Portsmouth. Funds from the General Assembly and the city paid for a temporary [[pier]].\n\nBy 1971, PMT had developed into a conventional two-berth general cargo marine terminal. In that year, the VPA bought Portsmouth's interest in the facility for approximately $7,418,000.\n\nIn 1975, an agreement between the VPA and Portsmouth allowed [[Sea-Land Service, Inc.]] to construct a terminal on the property of PMT; the new facility used about one-third of the available space. Sea-Land built a {{convert|600|ft|m|adj=on}} marginal wharf, a paved backup storage area, an office building, a warehouse with 26 loading bays, and a maintenance garage. Sea-Land also purchased a container crane. Sea-Land developed the terminal under a 30-year lease that stipulated that at the end of the lease the land and facility would revert to the VPA.\n\nDuring the early 1990s PMT received another high-speed container crane and a dock extension that joined the existing {{convert|600|ft|m|adj=on}} marginal wharf at the Sea-Land facility with the marginal wharf at the VPA's facility.<ref name=\"Port History\"/>\n\n==Newport News Marine Terminal==\nNewport News Marine Terminal is the smallest of the four facilities, with a land area of {{convert|140.64|acre|km2}}. The terminal has a forty-five-foot-deep main channel. The terminal is serviced by {{convert|42720|ft|m}} of rail track and four [[containerization|container]] [[crane (machine)|cranes]]. Two [[Berth (moorings)|berth]]s handle cruise vessels and [[Break bulk cargo|breakbulk]] cargo. The facility is also capable of handling [[containerization|containerized]] and [[roll-on/roll-off]] cargo. NNMT provides storage space for 790 containers and 1,210 [[chassis]]. NNMT also offers {{convert|394000|sqft|m2}} of covered storage space; {{convert|256000|sqft|m2}} of dry storage space; and {{convert|43|acre|m2}} of open yard storage space. NNMT is accessible via Interstate 64, Interstate 664, and U.S. Route 17. Breakbulk rail service is provided by [[CSX Corporation]]. Containerized cargo is [[drayage|drayed]] to and from NIT when [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]] rail service is necessary.<ref>The Virginia Port Authority. \"Newport News Marine Terminal Cranes and Specifications.\" 2007.</ref>\n\nPrior to the beginning of port unification in 1971, the Peninsula Ports Authority of Virginia (PPAV) owned the terminal and [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] (now CSX) operated it. In the late 1960s, Pier B entered service and construction of Pier C began. When, in 1971, the PPAV and Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad conveyed their rights to NNMT to the VPA, Pier C had not yet been completed. One of the requirements of the contract stipulated that the VPA had to obtain state funding to finish the project. In 1972, the General Assembly appropriated the necessary funds.\n\nChesapeake and Ohio Railroad remained the operator of NNMT until 1982, when the VPA Board of Commissioners authorized VIT to take over the operations. In 1983, the VPA purchased {{convert|22|acre|m2}} of land adjacent to NNMT from CSX, then leased the land back to the railroad company for two years while they built a repair along its tracks.\n\nIn the 1990s, NNMT received a $10 million entrance complex, an interchange, scales, an administration building, {{convert|27|acre|m2}} of paved cargo space, and an extension to Pier C. In 1994, the [[Nissan Motors|Nissan Import Auto Operations]] facility, previously located at NIT, was relocated to a newly developed {{convert|25|acre|m2|adj=on}} space at NNMT.<ref name=\"Port History\"/>\n\n==Virginia Inland Port==\nThe Virginia Inland Port, located in [[Front Royal, Virginia]], is the second smallest of the four facilities, with a land area of {{convert|161|acre|km2}}. The terminal is serviced by {{convert|17820|ft|m}} of rail track that runs adjacent to [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]'s main rail line. VIP is accessible via Interstates 66 and 81.\n\nThe $10 million [[intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] facility opened in 1989, extending The Port of Virginia's operations {{convert|220|mi|km}} inland. VIP provides access to markets in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], [[West Virginia]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[New York (state)|New York]]. The terminal offers a three-door cross dock facility for transferring cargo, a maintenance building, a [[chassis]] pool, [[Refrigerated container|reefer]] [[Engine-generator|gensets]], and shore power. As a [[United States Customs Service|U.S. Customs]]-designated port of entry, VIP supplies a full range of customs functions. [[USDA]] and SGS inspections are also available as needed.<ref name=\"Port History\"/>\n\n==Virginia International Gateway (VIG)==\n\nIn August 2014, the sale of APM Terminals Virginia, in Portsmouth, was finalized. The 576-acre, highly automated container terminal is now owned by Alinda Capital Partners, a U.S. infrastructure investment firm, and Universities Superannuation Scheme Ltd., a pension fund based in the United Kingdom.\n\nDaily terminal operations are unaffected and customers and transportation partners should expect a business as usual approach. The terminal remains under long-term lease to the Virginia Port Authority with Virginia International Terminals, LLC, serving as terminal operator.\n\nIn 2010, the VPA entered into a 20-year lease agreement with Netherlands-based [[APM Terminals]], a global port, terminal and Inland Services operator which is an independent business unit of Danish [[A.P. Moller-Maersk Group]] that effectively gives the agency control over all operations at VIG. Highly automated, the $450 million terminal in Portsmouth located on a {{convert|291|acre|km2|adj=on}} site was the largest investment in a company-owned container terminal in the nation when opened by APM Terminals in 2007.\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joc.com/maritime/virginia-port-authority-signs-apmt-terminal-lease|title=Virginia Port Authority Signs APMT Terminal Lease|website=www.joc.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}</ref> The addition of APM Terminals Virginia terminal meant that all the marine cargo container terminals in the Hampton Roads harbor became united under the VPA's management as of July, 2010.\n\n==Future==\n{{original research|date=June 2012}}\nVPA appears to be making preparations to take advantage of the future traffic potential of marine cargo container traffic in an ever-increasingly global market. The capacity expansion at Norfolk International Terminal, the 20-year lease of the APTM Virginia terminal facilities at Portsmouth and the planning and initial stages of the Craney Island terminal project all are complementary to what others are doing and how various investments are being made in transportation infrastructure improvements. Other entities doing so include the U.S. federal government, other Virginia agencies, other states and their respective local agencies (i.e. [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]]), corporate entities (notably the two [[Class 1 railroad]]s and several [[short line railroad]]s operating in the Hampton Roads region. VPA is even apparently ready to capitalize on developments initiated in other countries, with a particular emphasis on Panama's canal widening project.\n\n===Double stack intermodal with railroads===\nEast coast ports from Wilmington, [[North Carolina]] north to [[New York City]], notably including facilities at Norfolk, Portsmouth and Newport News on the harbor of Hampton Roads, currently receive extensive [[intermodal shipping container]] traffic. Much of the volume is from [[China]] and other points in [[Asia]] and is bound for the eastern 1/3 of the United States. Most containers are then transferred to railroads, and then transported generally as close as possible to final destinations, where they are then moved onto trucks for the final portion of their journeys.\n\nAs this volume has increased in recent years, it has become increasingly clear that there was a need for improved intermodal transfer facilities, both at the ports, and near the final destinations.<ref name=\"economist.com\">{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/16636101?story_id=16636101&fsrc=rss | work=The Economist | title=High-speed railroading | date=22 July 2010}}</ref>  Additionally, the two major [[Class 1 railroad]]s serving this growing traffic, [[Norfolk Southern Corporation]] (NS) and [[CSX Transportation]] (CSX), have each been forced utilize circuitous routing to avoid conflicts with tunnel and bridge clearances when crossing the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] and the [[Allegheny Mountains]].

The line extends from VPA facilities in Portsmouth to [[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]], a location which, due largely to geography of the region, has long been a rail and highway hub in the western portion of [[South Hampton Roads]].

A 15-year-long project, it will double the canal's capacity and allow it to carry the bigger container vessels and bulk ships<ref name=\"economist.com\"/> which have become favored by the shipping lines since the canal first opened in 1914. Such larger craft currently cannot use the port. Instead, much of the shipping container traffic  currently uses West Coast ports such as [[Los Angeles]] and [[Long Beach, California]]. The containers then travel overland via either railroad or by trucking. By coming through the widened [[Panama Canal]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and sailing on to East Coast ports, these vessels will be able to reduce shipping time and expense to reach major U.S. markets along the [[Mississippi River]] basin and the points east of there. Much of such rail traffic now changes at \"gateway\" railhead cities such as [[Chicago]] and [[St. Louis]], from western class 1 railroads such as [[Union Pacific]] and [[BNSF|Burlington Northern Sante Fe Railway]] (BNSF) to other railroads.\n\nBy using the canal and east coast ports, potentially a lot of shipping expense for the rail portion to destinations can be saved. However, keys to shipping via the western versus eastern ports are facilities at the ports, better rail links inland, shipping times, and costs.\n\nVPA's recent lease of the massive APTM intermodal terminal at Portsmouth and its capacity expansion at the Norfolk International Terminal both help Virginia to be positioned favorably, as do the move of the local railroad line, and the planning for even more capacity at [[Craney Island (Virginia)|Craney Island]].\n\nCurrently, according to ''Trains'' magazine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trn.trains.com/not-found|title=YOU'VE BEEN STOPPED BY A 404! - Trains Magazine|website=TrainsMag.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}</ref> Hampton Roads and [[Baltimore]] are the only ones on the U.S. East Coast which can already handle the greater draft (channel depth) of 50\u201355 feet and height clearance (approximately 50 feet) which are needed for the larger ships that would begin coming through the widened canal.

The $540 million investment in the Portsmouth facility is one of the largest private investments ever made in Virginia. The Commonwealth of Virginia is currently considering the proposal.\n\n==Governance==\nAs an agency of the Commonwealth, the Virginia Port Authority reports to the Virginia Secretary of Transportation. The Governor of Virginia appoints 11 citizens to form the Virginia Port Authority Board of Commissioners, and the state treasurer is an ''[[ex officio]]'' member of the Board. Commissioners serve staggered five year terms at the pleasure of the Governor, and no commissioner may serve more than two consecutive terms. Law dictates that there must be one, but no more than one, commissioner from [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] or [[Virginia Beach]]; one, but no more than one, commissioner from [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]] or [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]]; and one, but no more than one, commissioner from [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] or [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]].<ref name=\"Code of Virginia\">[https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/62.1-129/ Code of Virginia 1950 \u00a762.1-129].

Port operations are paid for using [[revenue]] generated by port activities, predominantly [[trade]]. The Port Authority does, however, receive state transportation money for capital projects, for such things as new wharfs and cranes. The agency receives 4.2 percent of the Commonwealth Transportation Trust Fund, a fund that's generated by fuel taxes, vehicle sales and use taxes, and some sales taxes. Such revenue is invested in maintaining and improving the facilities and in marketing the port to potential clients.\n\n==History {{Anchor|History}}==\n{{more citations needed|date=June 2012}}\n{{original research|date=June 2012}}\nThe Virginia Port Authority had its roots in the Virginia State Ports Authority, an agency of the Commonwealth created in 1952 that was responsible for operating the port terminals in the [[Hampton Roads]] [[harbor]]. Studies commissioned by the [[Virginia General Assembly]] during the 1970s and the early 1980s suggested that the port terminals should be consolidated under a single [[port authority]] that would manage the activities of the terminals while remaining under the authority of the General Assembly. Legislation changed the name of the Virginia State Ports Authority to the Virginia Port Authority to reflect the goal of integrating the ports. Virginia Senate Bill 548 mandated that the Virginia Port Authority complete the unification as swiftly as possible. In addition, the General Assembly revised the VPA's enabling legislation to allow the agency to subordinate local port cities, towns, and other entities; to acquire federal, state, and local property; and to provide for a [[tariff]].\n\nThe VPA purchased the terminals piecemeal. Portsmouth Marine Terminal became the first port to enter the unification program; the City of Portsmouth conveyed the port to the VPA in 1971. Later that same year, Newport News Marine Terminal (NNMT) was transferred to the VPA with the consent of its owner Peninsula Ports Authority (PPAV), its operator [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]], and the cities of Hampton and Newport News. The VPA acquired Norfolk International Terminals from the City of Norfolk in 1972.\n\nIn order to manage the consolidated marine terminal operations, Virginia International Terminals, Inc. was created in 1982. VIT not only systematized operations at the VPA's facilities, but also moved [[cargo]] more efficiently and strengthened the port's marketing program.\n\nTwo pieces of legislation in the 1980s aided the development of The Port of Virginia. The first, the Transportation Trust Fund, became the source for the Commonwealth Port Fund. The Commonwealth Port Fund was created by the General Assembly from a portion of the revenue generated by transportation [[taxes]] and [[fees]], and was transferred to the Board of Commissioners of the VPA to satisfy port capital needs within Virginia.\n\nThe second piece of legislation was the Water Resources Act of 1986, a federal cost-sharing initiative that provided for the [[dredging]] of all major U.S. [[river]] [[Channel (geography)|channels]] and [[waterways]]. The Hampton Roads harbor became the first to begin dredging under the new legislation, with the aim of deepening the outbound navigational channel from 45 to {{convert|50|ft|m}}. The project was completed in 1988 with the help of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]].\n\nIn 1989, the VPA opened the Virginia Inland Port, a $10 million intermodal facility in Front Royal, Virginia. The combination truck-and-rail terminal sits near the intersection of U.S. Interstate 81 and U.S. Interstate 66 and extends the VPA's activities to [[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], [[West Virginia]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref name=\"Port History\">The Virginia Port Authority. \"A History of Port Development, Port Growth, and Port Investment.\" 1995.</ref>\n\n==Norfolk International Terminals==\n[[File:Norfolk International Terminal.jpg|right|thumb|Norfolk International Terminal]]\n\nNorfolk International Terminals is the largest of the four facilities, with a land area of {{convert|648|acre|km2}}. The terminal has fifty-foot-deep entrance channels at the north and south ends. The terminal is serviced by {{convert|89300|ft|m}} of rail track and 11 Suez-class [[containerization|container]] [[crane (machine)|cranes]]. A marginal [[wharf]] measuring {{convert|5730|ft|m}} long provides five [[Berth (moorings)|berth]]s for vessels carrying [[containerization|containerized]], [[break bulk cargo|breakbulk]], and [[roll-on/roll-off]] cargoes. NIT provides 34,219 [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEUs]] of container storage space; {{convert|2340000|sqft|m2}} total of covered [[pier]], dry, and cold storage space; and space for 702 stacked truck [[chassis]]. NIT is accessible via Interstates 64, Insterstate 564, and Terminal Boulevard, and via rail serviced by [[Norfolk Southern Railway]], [[CSX Corporation]], and [[Eastern Shore Railroad]].<ref>The Virginia Port Authority. \"Norfolk International Terminals Cranes and Specifications.\" 2007.</ref>\n\nNIT was originally a surplus [[United States Army|Army]] [[Military base|base]] that the City of Norfolk purchased in 1965. The city outfitted the base with a container crane and put a one-berth container facility in service in addition to the breakbulk capacity already available. A second container berth and two more container cranes were added in the early 1970s.\n\nThe Virginia Port Authority used a $12 million appropriation from the General Assembly to acquire NIT on July 1, 1972. Slightly more than half the money went to pay obligations to the city and terminal; the remainder was dedicated to purchasing a fourth container crane, extending the container berth, and improving support structures.\n\nDuring the 1980s, NIT attracted the business of [[Nissan Motor Company]] and [[Evergreen Marine|Evergreen]]. To meet increasing demand, the VPA [[dredging|dredged]] deeper channels, added a fourth berth, built a {{convert|32000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} warehouse, purchased three high-speed gantry cranes, and paved another container storage area.<ref name=\"Port History\"/>\n\nThroughout the 1990s and 2000s, the VPA continued to expand the facilities, replace old cranes, and add new ones, until it reached its present capacity. On July 16, 2008, the three newest, and largest, cranes were delivered to the terminal.\n\n==Portsmouth Marine Terminal==\nPortsmouth Marine Terminal is the second largest of the four facilities, with a land area of {{convert|219|acre|km2}}. The terminal has a forty-five-foot-deep main channel. The terminal is serviced by {{convert|20100|ft|m}} of rail track, six [[containerization|container]] [[crane (machine)|cranes]], and one [[gantry crane]]. A marginal [[wharf]] measuring {{convert|3540|ft|m}} long provides three [[Berth (moorings)|berth]]s for vessels carrying [[containerization|containerized]], [[break bulk cargo|breakbulk]], and [[roll-on/roll-off]] cargoes. PMT provides 33,786 [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEUs]] of container storage space; {{convert|94471|sqft|m2}} of dry storage space; and space for 260 [[Refrigerated container|reefer]] receptacles. PMT is accessible via U.S. Route 58, which is connected to Interstates 95, 64, and 664; and via rail serviced by [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] and [[CSX Transportation]].<ref>The Virginia Port Authority. \"Portsmouth Marine Terminal Cranes and Specifications.\" 2007.</ref>\n\nMost of PMT was built upon reclaimed land containing [[dredging|dredged]] material from the construction of the [[Midtown Tunnel (Virginia)|Midtown Tunnel]]. The terminal began, in part, as a port owned by a railroad that served Pinner's Point. The Virginia State Ports Authority purchased the facility, but in 1965 leased a portion of it to the City of Portsmouth. Funds from the General Assembly and the city paid for a temporary [[pier]].\n\nBy 1971, PMT had developed into a conventional two-berth general cargo marine terminal. In that year, the VPA bought Portsmouth's interest in the facility for approximately $7,418,000.\n\nIn 1975, an agreement between the VPA and Portsmouth allowed [[Sea-Land Service, Inc.]] to construct a terminal on the property of PMT; the new facility used about one-third of the available space. Sea-Land built a {{convert|600|ft|m|adj=on}} marginal wharf, a paved backup storage area, an office building, a warehouse with 26 loading bays, and a maintenance garage. Sea-Land also purchased a container crane. Sea-Land developed the terminal under a 30-year lease that stipulated that at the end of the lease the land and facility would revert to the VPA.\n\nDuring the early 1990s PMT received another high-speed container crane and a dock extension that joined the existing {{convert|600|ft|m|adj=on}} marginal wharf at the Sea-Land facility with the marginal wharf at the VPA's facility.<ref name=\"Port History\"/>\n\n==Newport News Marine Terminal==\nNewport News Marine Terminal is the smallest of the four facilities, with a land area of {{convert|140.64|acre|km2}}. The terminal has a forty-five-foot-deep main channel. The terminal is serviced by {{convert|42720|ft|m}} of rail track and four [[containerization|container]] [[crane (machine)|cranes]]. Two [[Berth (moorings)|berth]]s handle cruise vessels and [[Break bulk cargo|breakbulk]] cargo. The facility is also capable of handling [[containerization|containerized]] and [[roll-on/roll-off]] cargo. NNMT provides storage space for 790 containers and 1,210 [[chassis]]. NNMT also offers {{convert|394000|sqft|m2}} of covered storage space; {{convert|256000|sqft|m2}} of dry storage space; and {{convert|43|acre|m2}} of open yard storage space. NNMT is accessible via Interstate 64, Interstate 664, and U.S. Route 17. Breakbulk rail service is provided by [[CSX Corporation]]. Containerized cargo is [[drayage|drayed]] to and from NIT when [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]] rail service is necessary.<ref>The Virginia Port Authority. \"Newport News Marine Terminal Cranes and Specifications.\" 2007.</ref>\n\nPrior to the beginning of port unification in 1971, the Peninsula Ports Authority of Virginia (PPAV) owned the terminal and [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] (now CSX) operated it. In the late 1960s, Pier B entered service and construction of Pier C began. When, in 1971, the PPAV and Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad conveyed their rights to NNMT to the VPA, Pier C had not yet been completed. One of the requirements of the contract stipulated that the VPA had to obtain state funding to finish the project. In 1972, the General Assembly appropriated the necessary funds.\n\nChesapeake and Ohio Railroad remained the operator of NNMT until 1982, when the VPA Board of Commissioners authorized VIT to take over the operations. In 1983, the VPA purchased {{convert|22|acre|m2}} of land adjacent to NNMT from CSX, then leased the land back to the railroad company for two years while they built a repair along its tracks.\n\nIn the 1990s, NNMT received a $10 million entrance complex, an interchange, scales, an administration building, {{convert|27|acre|m2}} of paved cargo space, and an extension to Pier C. In 1994, the [[Nissan Motors|Nissan Import Auto Operations]] facility, previously located at NIT, was relocated to a newly developed {{convert|25|acre|m2|adj=on}} space at NNMT.<ref name=\"Port History\"/>\n\n==Virginia Inland Port==\nThe Virginia Inland Port, located in [[Front Royal, Virginia]], is the second smallest of the four facilities, with a land area of {{convert|161|acre|km2}}. The terminal is serviced by {{convert|17820|ft|m}} of rail track that runs adjacent to [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]'s main rail line. VIP is accessible via Interstates 66 and 81.\n\nThe $10 million [[intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] facility opened in 1989, extending The Port of Virginia's operations {{convert|220|mi|km}} inland. VIP provides access to markets in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], [[West Virginia]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[New York (state)|New York]]. The terminal offers a three-door cross dock facility for transferring cargo, a maintenance building, a [[chassis]] pool, [[Refrigerated container|reefer]] [[Engine-generator|gensets]], and shore power. As a [[United States Customs Service|U.S. Customs]]-designated port of entry, VIP supplies a full range of customs functions. [[USDA]] and SGS inspections are also available as needed.<ref name=\"Port History\"/>\n\n==Virginia International Gateway (VIG)==\n\nIn August 2014, the sale of APM Terminals Virginia, in Portsmouth, was finalized. The 576-acre, highly automated container terminal is now owned by Alinda Capital Partners, a U.S. infrastructure investment firm, and Universities Superannuation Scheme Ltd., a pension fund based in the United Kingdom.\n\nDaily terminal operations are unaffected and customers and transportation partners should expect a business as usual approach. The terminal remains under long-term lease to the Virginia Port Authority with Virginia International Terminals, LLC, serving as terminal operator.\n\nIn 2010, the VPA entered into a 20-year lease agreement with Netherlands-based [[APM Terminals]], a global port, terminal and Inland Services operator which is an independent business unit of Danish [[A.P. Moller-Maersk Group]] that effectively gives the agency control over all operations at VIG. Highly automated, the $450 million terminal in Portsmouth located on a {{convert|291|acre|km2|adj=on}} site was the largest investment in a company-owned container terminal in the nation when opened by APM Terminals in 2007.\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joc.com/maritime/virginia-port-authority-signs-apmt-terminal-lease|title=Virginia Port Authority Signs APMT Terminal Lease|website=www.joc.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}</ref> The addition of APM Terminals Virginia terminal meant that all the marine cargo container terminals in the Hampton Roads harbor became united under the VPA's management as of July, 2010.\n\n==Future==\n{{original research|date=June 2012}}\nVPA appears to be making preparations to take advantage of the future traffic potential of marine cargo container traffic in an ever-increasingly global market. The capacity expansion at Norfolk International Terminal, the 20-year lease of the APTM Virginia terminal facilities at Portsmouth and the planning and initial stages of the Craney Island terminal project all are complementary to what others are doing and how various investments are being made in transportation infrastructure improvements. Other entities doing so include the U.S. federal government, other Virginia agencies, other states and their respective local agencies (i.e. [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]]), corporate entities (notably the two [[Class 1 railroad]]s and several [[short line railroad]]s operating in the Hampton Roads region. VPA is even apparently ready to capitalize on developments initiated in other countries, with a particular emphasis on Panama's canal widening project.\n\n===Double stack intermodal with railroads===\nEast coast ports from Wilmington, [[North Carolina]] north to [[New York City]], notably including facilities at Norfolk, Portsmouth and Newport News on the harbor of Hampton Roads, currently receive extensive [[intermodal shipping container]] traffic. Much of the volume is from [[China]] and other points in [[Asia]] and is bound for the eastern 1/3 of the United States. Most containers are then transferred to railroads, and then transported generally as close as possible to final destinations, where they are then moved onto trucks for the final portion of their journeys.\n\nAs this volume has increased in recent years, it has become increasingly clear that there was a need for improved intermodal transfer facilities, both at the ports, and near the final destinations.<ref name=\"economist.com\">{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/16636101?story_id=16636101&fsrc=rss | work=The Economist | title=High-speed railroading | date=22 July 2010}}</ref>  Additionally, the two major [[Class 1 railroad]]s serving this growing traffic, [[Norfolk Southern Corporation]] (NS) and [[CSX Transportation]] (CSX), have each been forced utilize circuitous routing to avoid conflicts with tunnel and bridge clearances when crossing the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] and the [[Allegheny Mountains]].

Thus they are often referred to in English-language research as \"[[Viking]] Rus'\". The scholarly consensus <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/viking/the-vikings-at-home/|title=The Vikings at home|website=History Extra}}</ref> is that the Rus' people originated in what is currently coastal [[East Middle Sweden|eastern Sweden]] around the eighth century and that their name has the same origin as [[Roslagen]] in [[Sweden]] (with the older name being ''[[Roden, Sweden|Roden]]'').\n\nBasing themselves among [[Slavs]] and [[Volga Finns]] in the upper [[Volga region]], they formed a diaspora of traders and raiders exchanging furs and slaves for silk, silver and other commodities available to the east and south. Around the ninth century, on the river routes to the [[Black Sea]], they had an unclear but significant role in forming the principality of [[Kievan Rus]], gradually assimilating with local [[Slavic peoples|Slavic populations]]. They also extended their operations much further east and south, among the [[Bulgars]] and [[Khazars]], on the routes to the [[Caspian Sea]]. By around the eleventh century, the word ''Rus{{'}}'' was increasingly associated with the principality of Kiev, and the term ''[[Varangian]]'' was becoming more common as a term for Scandinavians traveling the river-routes.\n\nLittle, however, is certain about the Rus{{'}}. This is to a significant extent because, although Rus{{'}} people were active over a long period and vast distances, textual evidence for their activities is very sparse and almost never produced by contemporary Rus' people themselves. It is believed that writing was brought to the Rus by the Slavs for religious reasons, but this happened long after their early history. The word ''Rus{{'}}'' in the primary sources does not always mean the same thing as it does when used by today's scholars. Meanwhile, archaeological evidence and researchers' understanding of it is accumulating only gradually. As a trading diaspora, Rus' people intermingled extensively with Finnic, Slavic, and Turkic peoples and their customs and identity seem correspondingly to have varied considerably over time and space.\n\nThe other key reason for dispute about the origins of Rus' people is the likelihood that they had a role in ninth- to tenth-century state formation in eastern Europe (ultimately giving their name to [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]]), making them relevant to what are today seen as the national histories of [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Sweden]], [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], [[Finland]] and [[Baltic states]]. \n\n== Key sources ==\n=== Etymology ===\n{{Main|Rus' (name)}}\n[[File:Europe 814.png|right|thumb|300px|[[Europe]] in the 9th century.

This is partly because of a widespread assumption that by identifying the linguistic origin of the name ''Rus{{'}}'', scholars can identify the origins of the people whom it described.

There was no law among them, but tribe rose against tribe. Discord thus ensued among them, and they began to war one against the other. They said to themselves, \"Let us seek a prince who may rule over us, and judge us according to the Law\". They accordingly went overseas to the Varangian Russes: these particular Varangians were known as Russes, just as some are called [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]], and others [[Normans]], [[Angles|English]], and [[Gutes|Gotlanders]], for they were thus named. The Chuds, the Slavs, the Krivichians and the Ves' then said to the people of Rus', \"Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. Come to rule and reign over us\". Thus they selected three brothers, with their kinsfolk, who took with them all the Russes and migrated. The oldest, Rurik, located himself in Novgorod; the second, [[Sineus and Truvor|Sineus]], at [[Beloozero]]; and the third, [[Sineus and Truvor|Truvor]], in [[Izborsk]].

The Varangians (''Varyags'', in [[Old East Slavic language|Old East Slavic]]) are first mentioned by the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' as having exacted tribute from the Slavic and Finnic tribes in 859. It was the time of rapid expansion of the Vikings in Northern Europe; England began to pay [[Danegeld]] in 859, and the [[Curonians]] of [[Grobin]] faced an invasion by the Swedes at about the same date.\n\nIt has been argued that the word ''Varangian'', in its many forms, does not appear in primary sources until the eleventh century (though it does appear frequently in later sources describing earlier periods). This suggests that the term ''Rus{{'}}'' was used broadly to denote Scandinavians until it became too firmly associated with the now extensively Slavicised elite of Kievan Rus. At that point, the new term ''Varangian'' was increasingly preferred to name Scandinavians, probably mostly from what is currently Sweden,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Forte|first1=Angelo|first2=Richard|last2=Oram|first3=Frederik|last3=Pedersen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vEd859jvk0C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Viking Empires|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year= 2005|ISBN= 0-521-82992-5|pages=13\u201314}}</ref> plying the river-routes between the Baltic and the Black/Caspian Seas.<ref>Marika M\u00e4gi, ''In <i>Austrvegr</i>: The Role of the Eastern Baltic in Viking Age Communication Across the Baltic Sea'', The Northern World, 84 (Leiden: Brill, 2018), p. 195, citing Alf Thulin, 'The Rus' of Nestor's Chronicle', ''Mediaeval Scandinavia'', 13 (2000), 70-96.</ref>\n\nDue largely to geographic considerations, it is often argued that most of the Varangians who traveled and settled in the lands of eastern Baltic, modern Russian Federation and lands to the south came from the area of modern [[Sweden]].\n\nThe Varangians left a number of [[varangian runestones|rune stones]] in their native [[Sweden]] that tell of their journeys to what is today Russia, Ukraine, Greece, and Belarus. Most of these rune stones can be seen today, and are a telling piece of historical evidence. The [[Varangian runestones]] tell of many notable Varangian expeditions, and even account for the fates of individual warriors and travelers.\n\nIn Russian history, two cities are used to describe the beginnings of the country: Kiev and Novgorod.<ref name=\"auto9\">Duczko, Wladyslaw. Viking Rus\u202f: Studies on the Presence of Scandinavians in Eastern Europe. The Northern World. Leiden: Brill, 2004.</ref> In the first part of the eleventh century the former was already a Slav metropolis, rich and powerful, a fast growing center of civilization adopted from Byzantium. The latter town, Novgorod, was another center of the same culture but founded in different surroundings, where some old local traditions molded this commercial city into a mighty oligarchic republic of a kind otherwise unknown in this part of Europe. These towns have tended to overshadow other places of a significance that they had acquired long before Kiev and Novgorod. The two original centers of Rus were Staraja Ladoga and Rurikovo Gorodishche, two points on the ends the Volkhov, a river running for 200 km between [[Lake Ilmen]] in the south to [[Lake Ladoga]] in the north<ref name=\"auto9\"/>. This was the territory that most probably was originally called by the Norsemen Gardar, a name that long after Viking Age was given much wider content and become Gardariki, denomination for whole Old Russian State. The area between the lakes was the original Rus, and it was from here its name was transferred to the Slav territories on the middle Dnieper, which eventually became \u201cRuskaja zemlja\u201d.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> The pre-history of the first territory of Rus has been sought in the developments around the mid eighth century, when Staraja Ladoga was founded as a trading place, serving the operations of Scandinavian hunters and dealers in furs obtained in the north-eastern forest zone of Eastern Europe. In the early period (the second part of the eighth and first part of the ninth century) Norse presence is only visible at Staraja Ladoga, and to a much lesser degree at a few other sites in the northern parts of Eastern Europe. The objects that represent Norse material culture of this period are rare outside Ladoga and mostly known as single finds. This rarity continues through the ninth century until the whole situation changes radically during the next century, when historians meet, at many places and in relatively large quantities, the material remains of a thriving Scandinavian culture.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> For a short period of time, some areas of Eastern Europe became as much part of the Norse world as were Danish and Norwegian territories in the West. The culture of the Rus contained Norse elements used as a manifestation of their Scandinavian background. These elements, which were current in tenth century Scandinavia, appear at various places in form of collections of many types of metal ornaments, mainly female but even male, such as weapons, decorated parts of horse bridle, and diverse objects embellished in current Norse art styles.<ref name=\"auto9\"/>\n\n== Debate on the origins of the Rus' ==\nThe historiography of the origins of the Rus' is infamously contentious, due to its perceived importance for the legitimation of nation-building, imperialism, and independence movements within the Slavonic-speaking world, and for legitimating different political relationships between eastern and western European countries.

Lunt offer explanations that go beyond simplistic attempts to attribute 'ethnicity' on first glance interpretation of literary, philological, and archaeological evidence. They view the Rus' as disparate, and often mutually antagonistic, clans of charismatic warriors and traders who formed wide-ranging networks across the North and Baltic Seas.<ref name=\"Pritsak 1981 14\">{{harvtxt|Pritsak|1981|p=14}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Lunt|1975|p=271}}</ref> They were a \"multi-ethnic, multilingual and non-territorial community of sea nomads and trading settlements\" that contained numerous Norsemen\u2014but equally Slavs, Balts, and Finns.<ref name=\"Pritsak 1981 14\"/>\n\nEvidence provided by the ''Primary Chronicle'', written some three centuries later, cannot be taken as an accurate ethnographic account; as tales of 'migration' from distant lands were common literary ''topoi'' used by rulers to legitimise their contemporary rule whilst at the same time differentiating themselves from their \"Baltic\" and \"Slavic\" subject tribes.

This may have produced 'an essentially voluntary convergence of groupings in common pursuit of primary produce exchangeable for artifacts from afar'.<ref>Jonathan Shepherd, 'Review Article: Back in Old Rus and the USSR: Archaeology, History and Politics', ''English Historical Review'', vol. 131 (no. 549) (2016), 384-405 {{DOI|10.1093/ehr/cew104}} (pp. 389-402, quoting p. 397).</ref> This fits well with the image of Rus' that dominates the Arabic sources, focusing further south and east, around the Black and Caspian Seas, the Caucasus and the Volga Bulghars.<ref>Thorir Jonsson Hraundal, 'New Perspectives on Eastern Vikings/Rus in Arabic Sources', ''Viking and Medieval Scandinavia'', 10 (2014), 65\u201369 {{DOI|10.1484/J.VMS.5.1052}} (pp. 70-71).</ref> Yet this narrative, though plausible, contends with the 'top-down' image of state development implied by the ''Primary Chronicle'', archaeological assemblages indicating Scandinavian-style weapon-bearing elites on the Upper Volga, and evidence for slave-trading and violent destruction of fortified settlements.<ref>Jonathan Shepherd, 'Review Article: Back in Old Rus and the USSR: Archaeology, History and Politics', ''English Historical Review'', vol. 131 (no. 549) (2016), 384-405 {{DOI|10.1093/ehr/cew104}} (pp. 389-402).</ref><ref>Thorir Jonsson Hraundal, 'New Perspectives on Eastern Vikings/Rus in Arabic Sources', ''Viking and Medieval Scandinavia'', 10 (2014), 65\u201369 {{DOI|10.1484/J.VMS.5.1052}} (p. 71).</ref>\n\nNumerous artefacts of Scandinavian affinity have been found in northern Russia.

The Rus' appeared to emulate aspects of [[Khazar]] political organization\u2014hence the mention of a Rus' ''[[Khagan|chaganus]]'' in the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] court in 839 (''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'').

Devoid of any silver dirham finds in the 8th century AD, it was situated west of the profitable fur and silver trade networks that spanned from the Baltic to the Muslim lands, via the [[Volga region|Volga]]-[[Kama River|Kama]] basins. At the prime hill in Kiev, fortifications and other symbols of consolidation and power appear from the 9th century, thus preceding the literary appearance of 'Rus' in the middle Dnieper region. By the 10th century, the lowlands around Kiev had extensive 'Slavic' styled settlements, and there is evidence of growing trade with the Byzantine lands. This might have attracted Rus' movements, and a shift in power, from the north to Kiev.<ref>{{harvtxt|Franklin|1996|pp=90\u2013122}}</ref> Thus, Kiev does not appear to have evolved from the infrastructure of the Scandinavian trade networks, but rather it forcibly took them over, as evidenced by the destruction of numerous earlier trade settlements in the north, including the famous [[Staraya Ladoga|Staraja Ladoga]].<ref>Tolochko p. 186</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* ''The Annals of Saint-Bertin'', transl.

Thus they are often referred to in English-language research as \"[[Viking]] Rus'\". The scholarly consensus <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/viking/the-vikings-at-home/|title=The Vikings at home|website=History Extra}}</ref> is that the Rus' people originated in what is currently coastal [[East Middle Sweden|eastern Sweden]] around the eighth century and that their name has the same origin as [[Roslagen]] in [[Sweden]] (with the older name being ''[[Roden, Sweden|Roden]]'').\n\nBasing themselves among [[Slavs]] and [[Volga Finns]] in the upper [[Volga region]], they formed a diaspora of traders and raiders exchanging furs and slaves for silk, silver and other commodities available to the east and south. Around the ninth century, on the river routes to the [[Black Sea]], they had an unclear but significant role in forming the principality of [[Kievan Rus]], gradually assimilating with local [[Slavic peoples|Slavic populations]]. They also extended their operations much further east and south, among the [[Bulgars]] and [[Khazars]], on the routes to the [[Caspian Sea]]. By around the eleventh century, the word ''Rus{{'}}'' was increasingly associated with the principality of Kiev, and the term ''[[Varangian]]'' was becoming more common as a term for Scandinavians traveling the river-routes.\n\nLittle, however, is certain about the Rus{{'}}. This is to a significant extent because, although Rus{{'}} people were active over a long period and vast distances, textual evidence for their activities is very sparse and almost never produced by contemporary Rus' people themselves. It is believed that writing was brought to the Rus by the Slavs for religious reasons, but this happened long after their early history. The word ''Rus{{'}}'' in the primary sources does not always mean the same thing as it does when used by today's scholars. Meanwhile, archaeological evidence and researchers' understanding of it is accumulating only gradually. As a trading diaspora, Rus' people intermingled extensively with Finnic, Slavic, and Turkic peoples and their customs and identity seem correspondingly to have varied considerably over time and space.\n\nThe other key reason for dispute about the origins of Rus' people is the likelihood that they had a role in ninth- to tenth-century state formation in eastern Europe (ultimately giving their name to [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]]), making them relevant to what are today seen as the national histories of [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Sweden]], [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], [[Finland]] and [[Baltic states]]. \n\n== Key sources ==\n=== Etymology ===\n{{Main|Rus' (name)}}\n[[File:Europe 814.png|right|thumb|300px|[[Europe]] in the 9th century. [[Roslagen]] is located along the coast of the northern tip of the pink area marked ''\"Swedes and Goths\"''.]]\n\nThe etymology and semantic history of the word ''Rus{{'}}'' has been a highly contentious topic, on which debate is ongoing.

The Chuds, the Slavs, the Krivichians and the Ves' then said to the people of Rus', \"Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. Come to rule and reign over us\". Thus they selected three brothers, with their kinsfolk, who took with them all the Russes and migrated.

The Varangians (''Varyags'', in [[Old East Slavic language|Old East Slavic]]) are first mentioned by the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' as having exacted tribute from the Slavic and Finnic tribes in 859. It was the time of rapid expansion of the Vikings in Northern Europe; England began to pay [[Danegeld]] in 859, and the [[Curonians]] of [[Grobin]] faced an invasion by the Swedes at about the same date.\n\nIt has been argued that the word ''Varangian'', in its many forms, does not appear in primary sources until the eleventh century (though it does appear frequently in later sources describing earlier periods). This suggests that the term ''Rus{{'}}'' was used broadly to denote Scandinavians until it became too firmly associated with the now extensively Slavicised elite of Kievan Rus. At that point, the new term ''Varangian'' was increasingly preferred to name Scandinavians, probably mostly from what is currently Sweden,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Forte|first1=Angelo|first2=Richard|last2=Oram|first3=Frederik|last3=Pedersen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vEd859jvk0C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Viking Empires|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year= 2005|ISBN= 0-521-82992-5|pages=13\u201314}}</ref> plying the river-routes between the Baltic and the Black/Caspian Seas.<ref>Marika M\u00e4gi, ''In <i>Austrvegr</i>: The Role of the Eastern Baltic in Viking Age Communication Across the Baltic Sea'', The Northern World, 84 (Leiden: Brill, 2018), p. 195, citing Alf Thulin, 'The Rus' of Nestor's Chronicle', ''Mediaeval Scandinavia'', 13 (2000), 70-96.</ref>\n\nDue largely to geographic considerations, it is often argued that most of the Varangians who traveled and settled in the lands of eastern Baltic, modern Russian Federation and lands to the south came from the area of modern [[Sweden]].\n\nThe Varangians left a number of [[varangian runestones|rune stones]] in their native [[Sweden]] that tell of their journeys to what is today Russia, Ukraine, Greece, and Belarus. Most of these rune stones can be seen today, and are a telling piece of historical evidence. The [[Varangian runestones]] tell of many notable Varangian expeditions, and even account for the fates of individual warriors and travelers.\n\nIn Russian history, two cities are used to describe the beginnings of the country: Kiev and Novgorod.<ref name=\"auto9\">Duczko, Wladyslaw. Viking Rus\u202f: Studies on the Presence of Scandinavians in Eastern Europe. The Northern World. Leiden: Brill, 2004.</ref> In the first part of the eleventh century the former was already a Slav metropolis, rich and powerful, a fast growing center of civilization adopted from Byzantium. The latter town, Novgorod, was another center of the same culture but founded in different surroundings, where some old local traditions molded this commercial city into a mighty oligarchic republic of a kind otherwise unknown in this part of Europe. These towns have tended to overshadow other places of a significance that they had acquired long before Kiev and Novgorod. The two original centers of Rus were Staraja Ladoga and Rurikovo Gorodishche, two points on the ends the Volkhov, a river running for 200 km between [[Lake Ilmen]] in the south to [[Lake Ladoga]] in the north<ref name=\"auto9\"/>. This was the territory that most probably was originally called by the Norsemen Gardar, a name that long after Viking Age was given much wider content and become Gardariki, denomination for whole Old Russian State. The area between the lakes was the original Rus, and it was from here its name was transferred to the Slav territories on the middle Dnieper, which eventually became \u201cRuskaja zemlja\u201d.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> The pre-history of the first territory of Rus has been sought in the developments around the mid eighth century, when Staraja Ladoga was founded as a trading place, serving the operations of Scandinavian hunters and dealers in furs obtained in the north-eastern forest zone of Eastern Europe. In the early period (the second part of the eighth and first part of the ninth century) Norse presence is only visible at Staraja Ladoga, and to a much lesser degree at a few other sites in the northern parts of Eastern Europe. The objects that represent Norse material culture of this period are rare outside Ladoga and mostly known as single finds. This rarity continues through the ninth century until the whole situation changes radically during the next century, when historians meet, at many places and in relatively large quantities, the material remains of a thriving Scandinavian culture.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> For a short period of time, some areas of Eastern Europe became as much part of the Norse world as were Danish and Norwegian territories in the West.

Lunt offer explanations that go beyond simplistic attempts to attribute 'ethnicity' on ''prima facie'' interpretation of literary, philological, and archaeological evidence. They view the Rus' as disparate, and often mutually antagonistic, clans of charismatic warriors and traders who formed wide-ranging networks across the North and Baltic Seas.<ref name=\"Pritsak 1981 14\">{{harvtxt|Pritsak|1981|p=14}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Lunt|1975|p=271}}</ref> They were a \"multi-ethnic, multilingual and non-territorial community of sea nomads and trading settlements\" that contained numerous Norsemen\u2014but equally Slavs, Balts, and Finns.<ref name=\"Pritsak 1981 14\"/>\n\nEvidence provided by the ''Primary Chronicle'', written some three centuries later, cannot be taken as an accurate ethnographic account; as tales of 'migration' from distant lands were common literary ''topoi'' used by rulers to legitimise their contemporary rule whilst at the same time differentiating themselves from their \"Baltic\" and \"Slavic\" subject tribes. Tolochko argues \"the story of the royal clan's journey is a device with its own function within the narrative of the chronicle. ... Yet if we take it for what it actually is, if we accept that it is not a documentary ethnographic description of the 10th century, but a medieval ''origo gentis''{{efn|[[Origin myth#Founding myth|founding myth]]}} masterfully constructed by a Christian cleric of the early 12th century, then we have to reconsider the established scholarly narrative of the earliest phase of East European history, which owes so much to the ''Primary Chronicle''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Tolochko|2008|p=184 & 188, resp}}</ref>\n\nArchaeological research, synthesizing a wide range of twentieth-century excavations, has begun to develop what Jonathan Shepard has called a 'bottom up' vision of the formation of the Rus' polity, in which, during the ninth and tenth century increasingly intensive trade networks criss-crossed linguistically and ethnically diverse groups around rivers like the Volga, the Don, the Dnieper. This may have produced 'an essentially voluntary convergence of groupings in common pursuit of primary produce exchangeable for artifacts from afar'.<ref>Jonathan Shepherd, 'Review Article: Back in Old Rus and the USSR: Archaeology, History and Politics', ''English Historical Review'', vol. 131 (no. 549) (2016), 384-405 {{DOI|10.1093/ehr/cew104}} (pp. 389-402, quoting p. 397).</ref> This fits well with the image of Rus' that dominates the Arabic sources, focusing further south and east, around the Black and Caspian Seas, the Caucasus and the Volga Bulghars.<ref>Thorir Jonsson Hraundal, 'New Perspectives on Eastern Vikings/Rus in Arabic Sources', ''Viking and Medieval Scandinavia'', 10 (2014), 65\u201369 {{DOI|10.1484/J.VMS.5.1052}} (pp. 70-71).</ref> Yet this narrative, though plausible, contends with the 'top-down' image of state development implied by the ''Primary Chronicle'', archaeological assemblages indicating Scandinavian-style weapon-bearing elites on the Upper Volga, and evidence for slave-trading and violent destruction of fortified settlements.<ref>Jonathan Shepherd, 'Review Article: Back in Old Rus and the USSR: Archaeology, History and Politics', ''English Historical Review'', vol. 131 (no. 549) (2016), 384-405 {{DOI|10.1093/ehr/cew104}} (pp. 389-402).</ref><ref>Thorir Jonsson Hraundal, 'New Perspectives on Eastern Vikings/Rus in Arabic Sources', ''Viking and Medieval Scandinavia'', 10 (2014), 65\u201369 {{DOI|10.1484/J.VMS.5.1052}} (p. 71).</ref>\n\nNumerous artefacts of Scandinavian affinity have been found in northern Russia. However, exchange between the north and southern shores of the Baltic had occurred since the Iron Age (albeit limited to immediately coastal areas).<ref>{{harvtxt|Franklin|1996|p=9}}</ref> Northern Russia and adjacent Finnic lands had become a profitable meeting ground for peoples of diverse origins, especially for the trade of furs, and attracted by the presence of oriental silver from the mid-8th century AD.<ref>{{harvtxt|Franklin|1996|p=12}}</ref> There is an undeniable presence of goods and people of Scandinavian origin; however, the predominant people remained the local (Baltic and Finnic) peoples.<ref>{{harvtxt|Franklin|1996|pp=22-25}}</ref>\n\nThe increasing volume of trade and internal competition necessitated higher forms of organization. The Rus' appeared to emulate aspects of [[Khazar]] political organization\u2014hence the mention of a Rus' ''[[Khagan|chaganus]]'' in the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] court in 839 (''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]''). Legitimization was sought by way of adopting a Christian and linguistically Slavic ''high culture'' that became the ''Kieven Rus<nowiki>'</nowiki>''.<ref>Pritsak, p. 31</ref> The burials ('chamber' or 'retainer' graves) attributed to the Kievan Rus' have only a superficial resemblance to supposed Scandinavian prototypes\u2014only the grave construction was similar, whilst the range of accompanying artefacts, the inclusion of weapons, horses and slave girls have no parallels in Scandinavia.<ref>Shephard, pp. 122\u20133</ref> Moreover, there is doubt if the emerging Kievan Rus' were the same clan as the \"Rus\" who visited the Carolingians in 839 or who attacked Constantinople in 860&nbsp;AD.<ref>Tolochko, p. 187</ref>\n\nThe rise of Kiev itself is mysterious. Devoid of any silver dirham finds in the 8th century AD, it was situated west of the profitable fur and silver trade networks that spanned from the Baltic to the Muslim lands, via the [[Volga region|Volga]]-[[Kama River|Kama]] basins. At the prime hill in Kiev, fortifications and other symbols of consolidation and power appear from the 9th century, thus preceding the literary appearance of 'Rus' in the middle Dnieper region. By the 10th century, the lowlands around Kiev had extensive 'Slavic' styled settlements, and there is evidence of growing trade with the Byzantine lands. This might have attracted Rus' movements, and a shift in power, from the north to Kiev.<ref>{{harvtxt|Franklin|1996|pp=90\u2013122}}</ref> Thus, Kiev does not appear to have evolved from the infrastructure of the Scandinavian trade networks, but rather it forcibly took them over, as evidenced by the destruction of numerous earlier trade settlements in the north, including the famous [[Staraya Ladoga|Staraja Ladoga]].<ref>Tolochko p. 186</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* ''The Annals of Saint-Bertin'', transl.

Member and regional airlines recognize Star Silver and Gold status, with a few exceptions mostly about airport lounge access. Membership is based on the frequent-flyer programs of the individual airlines. Many members have a premium status beyond Gold, which is not recognized across the alliance.\n\n====Star Alliance Silver====\nStar Alliance Silver status is given to customers who have reached a premium level of a member carrier's frequent-flyer program. Benefits are priority reservation wait-listing and airport stand-by. Some airlines also offer priority airport check-in, lounge access, baggage handling and boarding; preferred seating; an additional checked-luggage allowance, and waived fees for two checked bags.\n\n====Star Alliance Gold====\nStar Alliance Gold status is given to customers who have reached a higher level of a member airline's frequent-flyer program. Benefits are priority reservations wait-listing, airport standby and check-in and baggage handling; an additional checked luggage allowance of 20&nbsp;kg (or one extra piece, where the piece rule applies), and access to designated Star Alliance Gold lounges the day and place of departure with the presentation of a Star Alliance boarding pass. Some airlines also offer preferred seating (an exit seat or a special section of the plane); guaranteed seating on fully booked flights, subject to the booking class code and notice period, and free upgrades in the form of a voucher, certificate or automatic upgrade at check-in. United restricts US lounge access for their Gold Members to long-haul international passengers; Gold members from other carriers are welcome in US lounges run by United on all itineraries.\n\n====Qualifying tiers by airline====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Member and regional airlines recognize Star Silver and Gold status, with a few exceptions mostly about airport lounge access. Membership is based on the frequent-flyer programs of the individual airlines. Many members have a premium status beyond Gold, which is not recognized across the alliance.\n\n====Star Alliance Silver====\nStar Alliance Silver status is given to customers who have reached a premium level of a member carrier's frequent-flyer program. Benefits are priority reservation wait-listing and airport stand-by. Some airlines also offer priority airport check-in, lounge access, baggage handling and boarding; preferred seating; an additional checked-luggage allowance, and waived fees for two checked bags.\n\n====Star Alliance Gold====\nStar Alliance Gold status is given to customers who have reached a higher level of a member airline's frequent-flyer program. Benefits are priority reservations wait-listing, airport standby and check-in and baggage handling; an additional checked luggage allowance of 20&nbsp;kg (or one extra piece, where the piece rule applies), and access to designated Star Alliance Gold lounges the day and place of departure with the presentation of a Star Alliance boarding pass. Some airlines also offer preferred seating (an exit seat or a special section of the plane); guaranteed seating on fully booked flights, subject to the booking class code and notice period, and free upgrades in the form of a voucher, certificate or automatic upgrade at check-in. United restricts US lounge access for their Gold Members to long-haul international passengers; Gold members from other carriers are welcome in US lounges run by United on all itineraries.\n\n====Qualifying tiers by airline====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Despite feeling ill he visited with his family and they traveled around Hong Kong. By the morning of 22 February, he knew he was very sick and walked to nearby [[Kwong Wah Hospital]] to seek treatment. He warned staff that he was very sick and to put him in isolation. He never recovered and died in the Intensive Care Unit on 4 March.\n\nDr. Liu is believed to have been a SARS super-spreader: twenty-three other Metropole guests developed SARS, including seven from the ninth floor. Liu's brother-in-law, who sought treatment in late February, was hospitalized in Kwong Wah Hospital on 1 March and died on 19 March. It is estimated that around 80% of the Hong Kong cases were due to Liu.<ref name=Khan2016>Khan, Ali S. & Patrick, William.

The balcony was completely closed and guarded by the police. The residents of the building were later transferred to the quarantined [[Lei Yue Mun Holiday Camp]] and Lady MacLehose Holiday Village on 1 April because the building was deemed a health hazard.\n\nMost of the cases were linked to apartments with a north-western orientation which shared the same sewage pipe. According to government officials, the virus was brought into the estate by an infected [[kidney]] patient (the type of kidney illness was not specified) after discharge from [[Prince of Wales Hospital]], who visited his elder brother living on the seventh floor. Through excretion, the virus spread through drainage. One theory speculated that the virus was spread by [[airborne transmission]], through dried up U-shaped P-traps in the drainage system which a maritime breeze blew into the estate's balconies and stairwell ventilation. It was confirmed that the virus spread via droplets, but this later outbreak made officials question the possibility that the virus could be spread through the air.\n\n=== April 2003 ===\nOn 1 April, the U.S. government called back non-essential personnel in their consulate office in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. The US government also advised US citizens not to travel to the region.\n\nOn 2 April, Chinese medical officials began reporting the status of the SARS outbreak. China's southern Guangdong province reported 361 new infections and 9 new deaths, increasing the total [[Mainland China]] figures previously reported at end-February. The virus was also detected in Beijing and Shanghai. The WHO also advised travellers to avoid Hong Kong and Guangdong during a press briefing.<ref>[http://www.who.int/csr/sars/press2003_04_01/en/ Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Press briefing] 1 April 2003 ''www.who.int'', accessed 22 January 2020</ref>\n\nOn 3 April, a WHO team of international scientists landed in [[Guangzhou]] from Beijing to discuss with officials, but the team was yet to inspect any suspected origin or any medical facilities on the progress of infection control. Fifteen of the quarantined [[Amoy Gardens]] residents at [[Lei Yue Mun Holiday Camp]] were relocated to the [[Sai Kung Outdoor Recreation Centre]] after an overnight protest on washroom sharing. The first medical worker infected with SARS died in Hong Kong. The doctor's daughter and infected wife survived his illness, even though the wife was also among the quarantined medical workers under intensive care. Hong Kong school closures were extended by two weeks to 21 April.\n\nOn 4 April, the WHO team inspected the first infection case in Foshan County. The male infected four people. But, he did not infect his family. A 40-year-old woman became the first local case in Shanghai. A Chinese health specialist admitted at a press conference of not informing the public early enough about the outbreak. The PRC Health Minister also claimed that the disease has been under control in most parts of mainland China. He also released the names of seven drugs which he claimed to be effective in curing SARS. WHO officials said that the information provided by the PRC about the disease has been \"very detailed\".{{cn|date=January 2020}} US government enforced compulsory quarantine of an infected person.\n\nOn 5 April, the [[Singapore]] government announced that school closures would be extended.

The balcony was completely closed and guarded by the police. The residents of the building were later transferred to the quarantined [[Lei Yue Mun Holiday Camp]] and Lady MacLehose Holiday Village on 1 April because the building was deemed a health hazard.\n\nMost of the cases were linked to apartments with a north-western orientation which shared the same sewage pipe. According to government officials, the virus was brought into the estate by an infected [[kidney]] patient (the type of kidney illness was not specified) after discharge from [[Prince of Wales Hospital]], who visited his elder brother living on the seventh floor. Through excretion, the virus spread through drainage. One theory speculated that the virus was spread by [[airborne transmission]], through dried up U-shaped P-traps in the drainage system which a maritime breeze blew into the estate's balconies and stairwell ventilation. It was confirmed that the virus spread via droplets, but this later outbreak made officials question the possibility that the virus could be spread through the air.\n\n=== April 2003 ===\nOn 1 April, the U.S. government called back non-essential personnel in their consulate office in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. The US government also advised US citizens not to travel to the region.\n\nOn 2 April, Chinese medical officials began reporting the status of the SARS outbreak. China's southern Guangdong province reported 361 new infections and 9 new deaths, increasing the total [[Mainland China]] figures previously reported at end-February. The virus was also detected in Beijing and Shanghai. The WHO also advised travellers to avoid Hong Kong and Guangdong during a press briefing.<ref>[http://www.who.int/csr/sars/press2003_04_01/en/ Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Press briefing] 1 April 2003 ''www.who.int'', accessed 22 January 2020</ref>\n\nOn 3 April, a WHO team of international scientists landed in [[Guangzhou]] from Beijing to discuss with officials, but the team was yet to inspect any suspected origin or any medical facilities on the progress of infection control. Fifteen of the quarantined [[Amoy Gardens]] residents at [[Lei Yue Mun Holiday Camp]] were relocated to the [[Sai Kung Outdoor Recreation Centre]] after an overnight protest on washroom sharing. The first medical worker infected with SARS died in Hong Kong. The doctor's daughter and infected wife survived his illness, even though the wife was also among the quarantined medical workers under intensive care. Hong Kong school closures were extended by two weeks to 21 April.\n\nOn 4 April, the WHO team inspected the first infection case in Foshan County. The male infected four people. But, he did not infect his family. A 40-year-old woman became the first local case in Shanghai. A Chinese health specialist admitted at a press conference of not informing the public early enough about the outbreak. The PRC Health Minister also claimed that the disease has been under control in most parts of mainland China. He also released the names of seven drugs which he claimed to be effective in curing SARS.

Initially, its purpose was to be a \"support\" institute for the promotion of studies aimed at improving maritime economy and naval technology.\n\nIn the 1930s it was further enlarged and improved, and its name was changed to ''Istituto Universitario Navale''. It played a strategic role during [[Italian Fascism|Fascism]]: the University experts elaborated and calculated the exact and best [[air route]]s for the Oceanic trips performed by the Royal Italian Sea Planes, the \"''Trasvolata Atlantica''\". Several [[airplane]]s, leaving their base in [[Orbetello]], arrived to [[New York City]] and, in a second trip, finally come to South America: it was a great technological and political success for the regime. Also, it was at the Istituto Universitario Navale that, during [[World War II]] , some scientist developed and realized the first Italian [[radar]]; unfortunately the political authorities did not understand the importance of such discovery, stopping the development and thus neglecting the possibility to produce such an instrument.\n\n===Notable personalities===\n*[[Federico Cafiero]] (mathematician): worked as [[assistant professor]] to the chair of [[financial mathematics]] in 1944.\n*[[Renato Caccioppoli]] (mathematician): worked as [[professor]] on the chair of [[mathematical analysis]] during the [[academic year]]s 1942/43 and 1952/53.\n*[[Carlo Miranda]] (mathematician): worked as [[professor]] on the chair of [[mathematical analysis]] during the [[academic year]]s 1943/44 and 1955/56.\n*[[Mauro Picone]] (mathematician): worked as [[professor]] on the chair of mathematical analysis during the academic year 1926/27.\n\n==The university campuses==\n\nThe main premises of the \u201cParthenope\u201d University are located directly in the front of the passenger port of Naples.

Initially, its purpose was to be a \"support\" institute for the promotion of studies aimed at improving maritime economy and naval technology.\n\nIn the 1930s it was further enlarged and improved, and its name was changed to ''Istituto Universitario Navale''. It played a strategic role during [[Italian Fascism|Fascism]]: the University experts elaborated and calculated the exact and best [[air route]]s for the Oceanic trips performed by the Royal Italian Sea Planes, the \"''Trasvolata Atlantica''\". Several [[airplane]]s, leaving their base in [[Orbetello]], arrived to [[New York City]] and, in a second trip, finally come to South America: it was a great technological and political success for the regime. Also, it was at the Istituto Universitario Navale that, during [[World War II]] , some scientist developed and realized the first Italian [[radar]]; unfortunately the political authorities did not understand the importance of such discovery, stopping the development and thus neglecting the possibility to produce such an instrument.\n\n===Notable personalities===\n*[[Federico Cafiero]] (mathematician): worked as [[assistant professor]] to the chair of [[financial mathematics]] in 1944.\n*[[Renato Caccioppoli]] (mathematician): worked as [[professor]] on the chair of [[mathematical analysis]] during the [[academic year]]s 1942/43 and 1952/53.\n*[[Carlo Miranda]] (mathematician): worked as [[professor]] on the chair of [[mathematical analysis]] during the [[academic year]]s 1943/44 and 1955/56.\n*[[Mauro Picone]] (mathematician): worked as [[professor]] on the chair of mathematical analysis during the academic year 1926/27.\n\n==The university campuses==\n\nThe main premises of the \u201cParthenope\u201d University are located directly in the front of the passenger port of Naples. Additionally, \u201cParthenope\u201d has acquired classrooms buildings on the [[Posillipo]] coast and in the former church of [[San Giorgio dei Genovesi, Naples|San Giorgio dei Genovesi]], located in the centre of Naples. An additional location is under preparation at the new civic centre, the [[Centro Direzionale (Naples)|Centro Direzionale]]. With the increased extension and completion of main facilities and its final accreditation as a full university, the current student population of the Parthenope University is about 15,000 units.\n\n==Organization==\n\nThe university is divided into 5 departments:\n\n* [[Economics]]\n* [[Engineering]]\n* [[Law]]\n* [[Exercise]] and [[Sports Science]]\n* [[Sciences]] and [[Technology]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Italian universities]]\n* [[Naples]]\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation\n | editor-last =De Angelis\n | editor-first =P.
