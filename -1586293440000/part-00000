It is regarded as the most extreme and complete form of [[authoritarianism]]. In totalitarian states [[political power]] has often been held by [[Autocracy|autocrats]] who employ all-encompassing campaigns  in which [[propaganda]] is broadcast by state-controlled [[mass media]].<ref name=\"reflections2\">{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Conquest|title=Reflections on a Ravaged Century|date=1999|isbn=0-393-04818-7|page=74}}</ref>\n\nTotalitarian regimes are often characterized by extensive [[political repression]], a complete lack of [[democracy]], widespread [[Cult of personality|personality cultism]], [[Command economy|absolute control over the economy]], [[censorship|restrictions on speech]], [[mass surveillance]], and widespread use of [[state terrorism]]. Other aspects of a totalitarian regime include the use of [[concentration camps]], repressive [[secret police]], [[religious persecution]] or [[state atheism]], the extensive practice of [[capital punishment]], [[electoral fraud|fraudulent elections]] (if they take place), and potentially state-sponsored [[mass murder]] and [[genocide]]s. Historian [[Robert Conquest]] describes a totalitarian state as one which recognizes no limit on its authority in any sphere of public or private life and it extends that authority to whatever length is feasible.<ref name=\"reflections2\">{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Conquest|title=Reflections on a Ravaged Century|date=1999|isbn=0-393-04818-7|page=74}}</ref>\n\nThe concept was first developed in the 1920s by both [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] jurist (and later [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] academic) [[Carl Schmitt]] and, concurrently, the [[Italian fascism|Italian fascists]]. Italian fascist [[Benito Mussolini]] said \"Everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state\". Schmitt used the term ''Totalstaat'' in his influential 1927 work on the legal basis of an all-powerful state, ''[[The Concept of the Political]]''.<ref>{{cite book|first=Carl|last=Schmitt|date=1927|title=The Concept of the Political (German: Der Begriff des Politischen)|isbn=0-226-73886-8|edition=1996 University of Chicago Press|publisher=Rutgers University Press|page=22}}</ref> The term gained prominence in Western anti-communist political discourse during the Cold War era as a tool to convert pre-war [[anti-fascism]] into postwar [[anti-communism]].<ref name=\"defty\" /><ref name=\"siegel\" /><ref name=\"guilhot\" /><ref name=\"caute\" /><ref name=\"reisch\" />\n\nTotalitarian regimes are different from other authoritarian regimes. The latter denotes a state in which the single power holder\u2014an individual \"[[dictator]]\", a committee or a [[Military dictatorship|junta]] or an otherwise small group of political elite\u2014monopolizes political power. \"[The] authoritarian state [...] is only concerned with political power and as long as it is not contested it gives society a certain degree of liberty\".<ref name=\"Cinpoes\">Radu Cinpoes, ''Nationalism and Identity in Romania: A History of Extreme Politics from the Birth of the State to EU Accession'', p. 70.</ref> Authoritarianism \"does not attempt to change the world and human nature\".<ref name=\"Cinpoes\" /> In contrast, a totalitarian regime attempts to control virtually all aspects of the social life, including the economy, education, art, science, private life and morals of citizens. Some totalitarian governments may promote an elaborate ideology: \"The officially proclaimed [[ideology]] penetrates into the deepest reaches of societal structure and the totalitarian government seeks to completely control the thoughts and actions of its citizens\".<ref name=\"regime\" /> It also mobilizes the whole population in pursuit of its goals. [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] writes that \"a totalist ideology, a party reinforced by a [[secret police]], and monopoly control of [...] industrial mass society\" are the three features of totalitarian regimes that distinguish them from other autocracies.<ref name=\"Cinpoes\" />\n\n== Pre 1945 uses of the term ==\nThe notion that totalitarianism is \"total\" political power which is exercised by the state was formulated in 1923 by [[Giovanni Amendola]], who described [[Italian Fascism]] as a system which was fundamentally different from conventional [[dictatorship]]s.<ref name=\"regime\">* {{citation | author =Richard Pipes | author-link =Richard Pipes | publication-date = | year =1995 | title =Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime | place =New York | publisher =Vintage Books, Random House Inc. | isbn =0394502426 | page =[https://archive.org/details/russiaunderbolsh00rich/page/243 243] | url-access =registration | url =https://archive.org/details/russiaunderbolsh00rich/page/243}}</ref> The term was later assigned a positive meaning in the writings of [[Giovanni Gentile]], Italy's most prominent philosopher and leading theorist of [[fascism]].

In his essay ''[[Why I Write]]'', he wrote: \"The [[Spanish Civil War|Spanish war]] and other events in 1936\u201337 turned the scale and thereafter I knew where I stood. Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for [[democratic socialism]], as I understand it\".<ref>Orwell, George, [http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0300011h.html#part47 \"Why I Write\"], Gangrel (Summer) 1946.</ref>\n\nDuring a 1945 lecture series entitled ''The Soviet Impact on the Western World'' (published as a book in 1946), the pro-Soviet British historian [[E. H. Carr]] claimed: \"The trend away from individualism and towards totalitarianism is everywhere unmistakable\" and that [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] was by far the most successful type of totalitarianism as proved by Soviet industrial growth and the [[Red Army]]'s role in defeating Germany. Only the \"blind and incurable\" could ignore the trend towards totalitarianism, said Carr.<ref>Laqueur, Walter, ''The Fate of the Revolution'', New York: Scribner, 1987, p. 131.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1945) and ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' (1961), [[Karl Popper]] articulated an influential critique of totalitarianism: in both works, he contrasted the \"open society\" of [[liberal democracy]] with totalitarianism and argued that the latter is grounded in the belief that history moves toward an immutable future in accordance with knowable laws.\n\n== 1946\u20131987 Scholarly proposals criteria ==\n<!--'Anti-totalitarianism', 'Antitotalitarianism', 'Anti-totalitarian', and 'Anti-totalitarian' redirect here-->\nIn ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', [[Hannah Arendt]] argued that [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Communism|Communist]] regimes were new forms of government and not merely updated versions of the old [[tyrannies]]. According to Arendt, the source of the mass appeal of totalitarian regimes is their [[ideology]], which provides a comforting, single answer to the mysteries of the past, present and future. For Nazism, all history is the history of [[race struggle]] and for [[Marxism-Leninism]] all history is the history of [[class struggle]]. Once that premise is accepted, all actions of the state can be justified by [[appeal to nature]] or the [[Historicism|law of history]], justifying their establishment of authoritarian state apparatus.<ref>Dana Richard Villa (2000), ''The Cambridge Companion to Hannah Arendt''. Cambridge University Press, pp. 2\u20133. {{ISBN|0-521-64571-9}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to Arendt, many scholars from a variety of academic backgrounds and ideological positions have closely examined totalitarianism. Among the most noted commentators on totalitarianism are [[Raymond Aron]], Lawrence Aronsen, Franz Borkenau, [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], [[Robert Conquest]], [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]], [[Eckhard Jesse]], [[Leopold Labedz]], [[Walter Laqueur]], [[Claude Lefort]], [[Juan Linz]], [[Richard L\u00f6wenthal]], Karl Popper, [[Richard Pipes]], [[Leonard Schapiro]] and [[Adam Ulam]]. Each one of these describes totalitarianism in slightly different ways, but they all agree that totalitarianism seeks to mobilize entire populations in support of an official party ideology and is intolerant of activities which are not directed towards the goals of the party, entailing repression or state control of business, labour unions, [[non-profit organizations]], religious organizations, and minor political parties.\n\nThe concept became prominent in [[Western world|Western]] [[anti-communist]] political discourse during the [[Cold War]] era as a tool to convert pre-war [[anti-fascism]] into postwar anti-communism.<ref name=\"defty\">{{cite book|first=Brook|last=Defty|date=2007|title=Britain, America and Anti-Communist Propaganda 1945\u20131953|publisher=The Information Research Department|others=Chapters 2\u20135}}</ref><ref name=\"siegel\">Achim Siegel, ''The totalitarian paradigm after the end of Communism: towards a theoretical reassessment'', 1998, p. 200 \"Concepts of totalitarianism became most widespread at the height of the Cold War.

Friedrich and Brzezinski argue<ref>Friedrich, Carl and Brzezinski, Zbigniew ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'' Harvard University Press, 1956</ref> that a totalitarian system has the following six, mutually supportive, defining characteristics:\n# Elaborate guiding [[ideology]].\n# [[one-party state|Single mass party]], typically led by a [[dictator]].\n# [[state terrorism|System of terror]], using such instruments as violence and [[secret police]].\n# Monopoly on weapons.\n# Monopoly on the [[Mass media|means of communication]].\n# Central direction and control of the economy through [[state planning]].\nIn the book titled ''[[Democracy and Totalitarianism]]'' (1968), French analyst [[Raymond Aron]] has outlined 5 criteria for a regime to be considered as totalitarian:\n* 1) a [[one-party state]] where one party has a monopoly on all political activity.\n* 2) A state ideology upheld by the ruling party that is given status as the only authority.\n* 3) State information monopoly that controls [[mass media]] for distribution of official truth.\n* 4) State controlled economy with major economic entities under the control of the state.\n* 5) Ideological terror that turns economic or professional actions into crimes. Violators are exposed to prosecution and to ideological persecution.\n\nTotalitarian regimes in Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union had initial origins in the chaos that followed in the wake of [[World War I]] and allowed totalitarian movements to seize control of the government while the sophistication of modern weapons and communications enabled them to effectively establish what Friedrich and Brzezinski called a \"totalitarian dictatorship\". Some [[Social science|social scientists]] have criticized Friedrich and Brzezinski's '''anti-totalitarian'''<!-- boldface per WP:R#PLA --> approach, arguing that the Soviet system, both as a political and as a social entity, was in fact better understood in terms of [[interest group]]s, competing elites, or even in [[social class|class]] terms (using the concept of the ''[[nomenklatura]]'' as a vehicle for a [[New class|new ruling class]]).<ref>Laqueur, Walter, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) pp. 186\u201389, 233\u201334</ref> These critics pointed to evidence of the widespread dispersion of power, at least in the implementation of policy, among sectoral and regional authorities. For some followers of this [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralist]] approach, this was evidence of the ability of the regime to adapt to include new demands. However, proponents of the totalitarian model claimed that the failure of the system to survive showed not only its inability to adapt, but the mere formality of supposed popular participation.\n\nThe German historian [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], whose work is primarily concerned with Nazi Germany, argues that the \"totalitarian typology\" as developed by Friedrich and Brzezinski is an excessively inflexible model and failed to consider the \"revolutionary dynamic\" that Bracher asserts is at the heart of totalitarianism.<ref name=\"Kershaw, Ian page 25\">Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold; New York p. 25.</ref> Bracher maintains that the essence of totalitarianism is the total claim to control and remake all aspects of society combined with an all-embracing ideology, the value on authoritarian leadership and the pretence of the common identity of state and society, which distinguished the totalitarian \"closed\" understanding of politics from the \"open\" democratic understanding.<ref name=\"Kershaw, Ian page 25\"/> Unlike the Friedrich-Brzezinski definition, Bracher argued that totalitarian regimes did not require a single leader and could function with a [[collective leadership]], which led the American historian [[Walter Laqueur]] to argue that Bracher's definition seemed to fit reality better than the Friedrich-Brzezinski definition.<ref>Walter Laqueur, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'', New York: Scribner's, 1987 p. 241</ref>\n\nIn his 1951 book ''[[The True Believer]]'', [[Eric Hoffer]] argues that mass movements like Stalinism, fascism and Nazism had a common trait in picturing Western democracies and their values as [[decadent]], with people \"too soft, too pleasure-loving and too selfish\" to sacrifice for a higher cause, which for them implies an inner moral and biological decay. He further claims that those movements offered the prospect of a glorious future to frustrated people, enabling them to find a refuge from the lack of personal accomplishments in their individual existence. The individual is then assimilated into a compact collective body and \"fact-proof screens from reality\" are established.<ref>Eric Hoffer, ''The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements'', Harper Perennial Modern Classics (2002), {{ISBN|0-06-050591-5}}, pp. 61, 163</ref>\n\nPaul Hanebrink has also argued that many European Christians started to fear Communist regimes after the rise of Hitler: \"For many European Christians, Catholic and Protestant alike, the new postwar \u2018culture war\u2019 crystallized as a struggle against communism.

The latter reflected a \"revanchist, military-minded conservative nationalism\".<ref>Paul Buhle and Edward Francis Rice-Maximin (1995), ''William Appleman Williams: The Tragedy of Empire''. Psychology Press, p. 192. {{ISBN|0-34-912056-0}}</ref> More recently, [[Enzo Traverso]] has attacked the creators of the concept of totalitarianism as having invented it to designate the enemies of the West.<ref>Enzo Traverso (2001), ''Le Totalitarisme: Le XXe si\u00e8cle en d\u00e9bat''. Poche. {{ISBN|978-2020378574}}</ref> Thus, calling Stalin totalitarian instead of authoritarian has been asserted to be a high-sounding but specious excuse for Western self-interest, just as surely as the counterclaim\u2014that alleged debunking of the totalitarian concept may just be a high-sounding but specious excuse for Russian self-interest. For [[Domenico Losurdo]], totalitarianism is a polysemic concept with origins in [[Christian theology]], and that applying it to the political sphere requires an operation of abstract schematism which makes use of isolated elements of historical reality to place [[fascist]] regimes and the [[USSR]] in the dock together, serving the [[anti-communism]] of [[Cold War]]-era intellectuals rather than reflecting intellectual research. Other scholars, such as [[F. William Engdahl]], [[Sheldon Wolin]] and [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]], have linked totalitarianism to capitalism and liberalism and used concepts, such as [[totalitarian democracy]], [[inverted totalitarianism]] or [[totalitarian capitalism]].\n\nIn the 2010s, Vladimir Tismaneanu, Richard Shorten and Aviezer Tucker argued that totalitarian ideologies can take different forms in different political systems, but all of them focus on utopianism, scientism or political violence. They think that both Nazism and Soviet Communism emphasised the role of specialisation in modern societies and saw [[polymathy]] as \"a thing of the past\"; both claimed to have statistical scientific support for their claims, which led to a strict \"ethical\" control of culture, psychological violence and persecution of entire groups.<ref>Richard Shorten \"Modernism and Totalitarianism: Rethinking the Intellectual Sources of Nazism and Stalinism, 1945 to the Present\", Palgrave, 2012; Vladimir Tismaneanu, \"The Devil in History: Communism, Fascism, and Some Lessons of the Twentieth Century\", University of California Press, 2012; Aviezer Tucker \"The Legacies of Totalitarianism: A Theoretical Framework\", Cambridge University Press, 2015.</ref> Their arguments have been criticised by other scholars due to their partiality and anachronism. For instance, Juan Francisco Fuentes treats totalitarianism as an \"[[invented tradition]]\" and the use of notion of \"modern [[despotism]]\" as a \"reverse anachronism\".

Ord states that Orwell's writings show that Orwell's concern was genuine, rather than just a throwaway part of the fictional plot of ''1984''; for example, Orwell argues in 1949: \"A ruling class which could guard against (four previously enumerated sources of risk) would remain in power permanently\".<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity]]. |author=[[Toby Ord]]| date=2020 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc |isbn=9781526600196 |chapter=Chapter 5: Future Risks}}</ref> [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote in 1949, \"Modern techniques have made possible a new intensity of governmental control, and this possibility has been exploited very fully in totalitarian states\".<ref>Clarke, R.

Other aspects of a totalitarian regime include the use of [[concentration camps]], repressive [[secret police]], [[religious persecution]] or [[state atheism]], the extensive practice of [[capital punishment]], [[electoral fraud|fraudulent elections]] (if they take place), and potentially state-sponsored [[mass murder]] and [[genocide]]s.

The latter denotes a state in which the single power holder\u2014an individual \"[[dictator]]\", a committee or a [[Military dictatorship|junta]] or an otherwise small group of political elite\u2014monopolizes political power. \"[The] authoritarian state [...] is only concerned with political power and as long as it is not contested it gives society a certain degree of liberty\".<ref name=\"Cinpoes\">Radu Cinpoes, ''Nationalism and Identity in Romania: A History of Extreme Politics from the Birth of the State to EU Accession'', p. 70.</ref> Authoritarianism \"does not attempt to change the world and human nature\".<ref name=\"Cinpoes\" /> In contrast, a totalitarian regime attempts to control virtually all aspects of the social life, including the economy, education, art, science, private life and morals of citizens. Some totalitarian governments may promote an elaborate ideology: \"The officially proclaimed [[ideology]] penetrates into the deepest reaches of societal structure and the totalitarian government seeks to completely control the thoughts and actions of its citizens\".<ref name=\"regime\" /> It also mobilizes the whole population in pursuit of its goals.

According to Arendt, the source of the mass appeal of totalitarian regimes is their [[ideology]], which provides a comforting, single answer to the mysteries of the past, present and future. For Nazism, all history is the history of [[race struggle]] and for [[Marxism-Leninism]] all history is the history of [[class struggle]].

Violators are exposed to prosecution and to ideological persecution.\n\nTotalitarian regimes in Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union had initial origins in the chaos that followed in the wake of [[World War I]] and allowed totalitarian movements to seize control of the government while the sophistication of modern weapons and communications enabled them to effectively establish what Friedrich and Brzezinski called a \"totalitarian dictatorship\". Some [[Social science|social scientists]] have criticized Friedrich and Brzezinski's '''anti-totalitarian'''<!-- boldface per WP:R#PLA --> approach, arguing that the Soviet system, both as a political and as a social entity, was in fact better understood in terms of [[interest group]]s, competing elites, or even in [[social class|class]] terms (using the concept of the ''[[nomenklatura]]'' as a vehicle for a [[New class|new ruling class]]).<ref>Laqueur, Walter, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) pp. 186\u201389, 233\u201334</ref> These critics pointed to evidence of the widespread dispersion of power, at least in the implementation of policy, among sectoral and regional authorities. For some followers of this [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralist]] approach, this was evidence of the ability of the regime to adapt to include new demands. However, proponents of the totalitarian model claimed that the failure of the system to survive showed not only its inability to adapt, but the mere formality of supposed popular participation.\n\nThe German historian [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], whose work is primarily concerned with Nazi Germany, argues that the \"totalitarian typology\" as developed by Friedrich and Brzezinski is an excessively inflexible model and failed to consider the \"revolutionary dynamic\" that Bracher asserts is at the heart of totalitarianism.<ref name=\"Kershaw, Ian page 25\">Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold; New York p. 25.</ref> Bracher maintains that the essence of totalitarianism is the total claim to control and remake all aspects of society combined with an all-embracing ideology, the value on authoritarian leadership and the pretence of the common identity of state and society, which distinguished the totalitarian \"closed\" understanding of politics from the \"open\" democratic understanding.<ref name=\"Kershaw, Ian page 25\"/> Unlike the Friedrich-Brzezinski definition, Bracher argued that totalitarian regimes did not require a single leader and could function with a [[collective leadership]], which led the American historian [[Walter Laqueur]] to argue that Bracher's definition seemed to fit reality better than the Friedrich-Brzezinski definition.<ref>Walter Laqueur, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'', New York: Scribner's, 1987 p. 241</ref>\n\nIn his 1951 book ''[[The True Believer]]'', [[Eric Hoffer]] argues that mass movements like Stalinism, fascism and Nazism had a common trait in picturing Western democracies and their values as [[decadent]], with people \"too soft, too pleasure-loving and too selfish\" to sacrifice for a higher cause, which for them implies an inner moral and biological decay. He further claims that those movements offered the prospect of a glorious future to frustrated people, enabling them to find a refuge from the lack of personal accomplishments in their individual existence. The individual is then assimilated into a compact collective body and \"fact-proof screens from reality\" are established.<ref>Eric Hoffer, ''The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements'', Harper Perennial Modern Classics (2002), {{ISBN|0-06-050591-5}}, pp. 61, 163</ref>\n\nPaul Hanebrink has also argued that many European Christians started to fear Communist regimes after the rise of Hitler: \"For many European Christians, Catholic and Protestant alike, the new postwar \u2018culture war\u2019 crystallized as a struggle against communism.

Hough]], William McCagg, [[Robert W. Thurston]] and [[J. Arch Getty]].<ref name=\"Laqueur, Walter pages 225-227\">Walter Laqueur, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) pp. 225\u201327</ref> Though their individual interpretations differ, the revisionists have argued that the Soviet state under [[Joseph Stalin]] was institutionally weak, that the level of terror was much exaggerated and that\u2014to the extent it occurred\u2014it reflected the weaknesses rather than the strengths of the Soviet state.<ref name=\"Laqueur, Walter pages 225-227\"/> Fitzpatrick argued that the Stalin's purges in the Soviet Union provided an increased [[social mobility]] and therefore a chance for a better life.<ref>Laqueur, Walter, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) pp. 225, 228</ref><ref>Fitzpatrick, Sheila, ''Everyday Stalinism: Ordinary Life in Extraordinary Times: Soviet Russia in the 1930s'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999)</ref>\n\nWriting in 1987, [[Walter Laqueur]] said that the revisionists in the field of Soviet history were guilty of confusing popularity with morality and of making highly embarrassing and not very convincing arguments against the concept of the Soviet Union as a totalitarian state.<ref name=\"Laqueur, Walter p. 228\">Laqueur, Walter ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) p. 228</ref> Laqueur argued that the revisionists' arguments with regard to Soviet history were highly similar to the arguments made by [[Ernst Nolte]] regarding German history.<ref name=\"Laqueur, Walter p. 228\"/> Laqueur asserted that concepts such as modernization were inadequate tools for explaining Soviet history while totalitarianism was not.<ref>Walter Laqueur, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) p. 233.</ref>\n\nLaqueur's argument has been criticized by modern revisionist historians, such as [[Paul Buhle]], who claim that Laqueur wrongly equates Cold-war revisionism with the German revisionism. The latter reflected a \"revanchist, military-minded conservative nationalism\".<ref>Paul Buhle and Edward Francis Rice-Maximin (1995), ''William Appleman Williams: The Tragedy of Empire''. Psychology Press, p. 192. {{ISBN|0-34-912056-0}}</ref> More recently, [[Enzo Traverso]] has attacked the creators of the concept of totalitarianism as having invented it to designate the enemies of the West.<ref>Enzo Traverso (2001), ''Le Totalitarisme: Le XXe si\u00e8cle en d\u00e9bat''. Poche. {{ISBN|978-2020378574}}</ref> Thus, calling Stalin totalitarian instead of authoritarian has been asserted to be a high-sounding but specious excuse for Western self-interest, just as surely as the counterclaim\u2014that alleged debunking of the totalitarian concept may just be a high-sounding but specious excuse for Russian self-interest. For [[Domenico Losurdo]], totalitarianism is a polysemic concept with origins in [[Christian theology]], and that applying it to the political sphere requires an operation of abstract schematism which makes use of isolated elements of historical reality to place [[fascist]] regimes and the [[USSR]] in the dock together, serving the [[anti-communism]] of [[Cold War]]-era intellectuals rather than reflecting intellectual research. Other scholars, such as [[F. William Engdahl]], [[Sheldon Wolin]] and [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]], have linked totalitarianism to capitalism and liberalism and used concepts, such as [[totalitarian democracy]], [[inverted totalitarianism]] or [[totalitarian capitalism]].\n\nIn the 2010s, Vladimir Tismaneanu, Richard Shorten and Aviezer Tucker argued that totalitarian ideologies can take different forms in different political systems, but all of them focus on utopianism, scientism or political violence. They think that both Nazism and Soviet Communism emphasised the role of specialisation in modern societies and saw [[polymathy]] as \"a thing of the past\"; both claimed to have statistical scientific support for their claims, which led to a strict \"ethical\" control of culture, psychological violence and persecution of entire groups.<ref>Richard Shorten \"Modernism and Totalitarianism: Rethinking the Intellectual Sources of Nazism and Stalinism, 1945 to the Present\", Palgrave, 2012; Vladimir Tismaneanu, \"The Devil in History: Communism, Fascism, and Some Lessons of the Twentieth Century\", University of California Press, 2012; Aviezer Tucker \"The Legacies of Totalitarianism: A Theoretical Framework\", Cambridge University Press, 2015.</ref> Their arguments have been criticised by other scholars due to their partiality and anachronism. For instance, Juan Francisco Fuentes treats totalitarianism as an \"[[invented tradition]]\" and the use of notion of \"modern [[despotism]]\" as a \"reverse anachronism\". For Fuentes, \"the anachronistic use of totalitarian/totalitarianism involves the will to reshape the past in the image and likeness of the present.\"<ref>Juan Francisco Fuentes, \"How Words reshape the Past: The 'Old, Old Story' of Totalitarianism\", Politics, Religion & Ideology, 2015, p. 15.</ref>\n\n''The Economist'' has described China's developed [[Social Credit System]] to screen and rank its citizens based on their personal behavior as \"totalitarian\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/briefing/2016/12/17/china-invents-the-digital-totalitarian-state |title=China invents the digital totalitarian state |last= |date=17 December 2017 |access-date=14 September 2018 |website=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/china-social-credit-system-punishments-and-rewards-explained-2018-4|title=China has started ranking citizens with a creepy 'social credit' system \u2013 here's what you can do wrong, and the embarrassing, demeaning ways they can punish you|work=Business Insider|access-date=8 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/china-experiments-with-sweeping-social-credit-system/a-42030727|title=China experiments with sweeping Social Credit System |date=4 January 2018 |publisher=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|access-date=8 June 2018}}</ref> China's Social Credit System was first announced in 2014 and aims to introduce the idea that \"Keeping trust is glorious and breaking trust is disgraceful\" according to a government document that guided the ideology of the plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/china-social-credit-system-punishments-and-rewards-explained-2018-4|title=China has started ranking citizens with a creepy 'social credit' system \u2013 here's what you can do wrong, and the embarrassing, demeaning ways they can punish you|first=Alexandra|last=Ma|website=Business Insider|date=30 October 2018|access-date=12 May 2019}}</ref> By 2020, the Social Credit System should be fully operational and mandatory for millions of people across the country.

Ord states that Orwell's writings show that Orwell's concern was genuine, rather than just a throwaway part of the fictional plot of ''1984''; for example, Orwell argues in 1949: \"A ruling class which could guard against (four previously enumerated sources of risk) would remain in power permanently\".<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity]]. |author=[[Toby Ord]]| date=2020 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc |isbn=9781526600196 |chapter=Chapter 5: Future Risks}}</ref> [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote in 1949, \"Modern techniques have made possible a new intensity of governmental control, and this possibility has been exploited very fully in totalitarian states\".<ref>Clarke, R.

It saw action at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras]] and [[Battle of Passchendaele|Ypres]], before moving the the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Front]]. It returned to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] to fight in the German [[Spring Offensive]] and the victorious Allied [[Hundred Days Offensive]].\n\n==Recruitment==\n[[File:30a Sammlung Eybl Gro\u00dfbritannien. Alfred Leete (1882\u20131933) Britons (Kitchener) wants you (Briten Kitchener braucht Euch). 1914 (Nachdruck), 74 x 50 cm. (Slg.Nr. 552).jpg|right|thumb|[[Alfred Leete]]'s recruitment poster for Kitchener's Army.]]\nOn 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular [[British Army]], and the newly-appointed [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Earl Kitchener of Khartoum]] issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'.<ref>Army Council Instructions No 32 (6 August) and No 37 (7 August).</ref><ref>Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 2 & 8; Appendix I.</ref><ref name = Grist53>Grist, p. 53.</ref> A flood of volunteers poured into the recruiting offices across the country and were formed into 'Service' battalions of the county regiments. However, the Bristol Chamber of Commerce considered that the city's response was inadequate and formed a Bristol Citizens' Recruiting Committee under the leadership of the former Lord Mayor, Sir [[Herbert Ashman]], to encourage enlistment. The city's Colston Hall was opened as a recruiting centre on 14 August, and 2274 men enlisted by 2 September. Eighty men calling themselves the Weston Comrades Company also joined from [[Weston-super-Mare]]. It was clear that many of these men wanted to serve together in a special Bristol battalion, similar to other '[[Pals battalion]]s' being formed around the country. The [[War Office]] (WO) gave the committee authority to form the '''Bristol Battalion''', [[Gloucestershire Regiment]], on 30 August. Later in the year it became part of Kitchener's Fifth New Army (K5) and was officially numbered as the '''12th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment (Bristol)''', but the subtitle was usually rendered as 'Bristol's Own'. The recruiting committee encouraged 'mercantile and professional' men to apply, both through reasons of social exclusiveness and with a view to Kitchener's directive that workers in vital industries could not be spared. The first commanding officer (CO) was William Burges, who had retired from command of the 3rd Militia Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment some years before. Several of the other officers appointed had experience in the Regular or Auxiliary forces, and a number of junior officers had been members of their school or university [[Officer Training Corps]].<ref>Marks, pp. 8\u201320, 32\u20133, 39.</ref><ref name = Grist54>Grist, pp. 54\u20135.</ref><ref name = Daniell227>Daniell, p. 227.</ref><ref>Army Council Instructions, October 1914, Appendix VIII; December 1914, Appendix III.</ref><ref name = Frederick>Frederick, p. 102.</ref><ref name = James>James, p. 72.</ref><ref name = TrailGlos>[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/gloucestershire-regiment/ Glosters at Long, Long Trail.]</ref><ref name = GlosCO>[http://www.ww1infantrycos.co.uk/gloucs.html Glosters at Infantry Battalion COs.]</ref>\n\n==Training==\nThe rush of recruits had overwhelmed the Army's ability to absorb them, so the Pals Battalions of K5 were left for some time in the hands of the recruiting committees. Initially the Bristol men lived at home and drilled by squads at Colston Hall in their civilian clothes, distinguished only by a lapel badge bearing the words 'New Bristol Battalion Gloucestershire Regt'. They then began battalion drills at the Artillery Grounds in [[Whiteladies Road]], the headquarters of the [[Gloucestershire Volunteer Artillery|I South Midland (Gloucestershire) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery]] of the [[Territorial Force]]. But in late September the recruiting committee persuaded the WO to buy up the site of the abandoned Bristol International Exhibition in Greville Smyth Park, the buildings of which were converted into barracks by the [[Royal Engineers]] and [[Army Service Corps]]. The 'Weston Comrades' joined the rest of the battalion here in November and were posted to D Company. Some of the battalion's best men were already being posted away, for officer training for example, and on 30 November the WO authorised the recruiting committee to raise a fifth, reserve company (E Company); F Company was raised as a further reserve in April 1915. Old rifles had been issued to the battalion for drill purposes, with just a few modern [[Lee-Enfield|Lee-Enfield]] .303 SMLE rifles for musketry training. Uniforms were finally received in December 1914. In March 1915 the battalion began field training by companies at [[Chipping Sodbury]].<ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Marks, pp. 22\u201331, 40\u201351, 69, 71.</ref>[http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Gloucestershire/TownBristol.htm Bristol at Drill Hall Project.]</ref>\n\nThe locally-raised units to form K5 were assigned to brigades on 10 December 1914: the Bristol Battalion was brigaded with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd [[Birmingham Pals]] (later 14th, 15th and 16th (Service) Battalions, [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]]). The brigade was\ninitially numbered 116th Brigade in 39th Division, but in April 1915 the WO decided to convert the K4 battalions into reserve units to train reinforcements for the K1\u2013K3 units, and on 27 April the K5 divisions were renumbered to take up the designations of the K4 formations. The short-lived 39th Division thus became [[32nd Division (United Kingdom)|32nd Division]] and 116th Brigade became [[95th Brigade (United Kingdom)|95th Brigade]].<ref name = TrailGlos/><ref>Army Council Instruction No 101 (10 December 1914).</ref><ref>Becke, Pt 3b, Appendix I2</ref><ref name = Becke32>Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 21\u201328.</ref><ref>Marks, p. 64.</ref>\n\nIn May 1915 the brigade was to have gathered in [[Shropshire]], but the ground selected at [[Prees Heath Army Camp|Prees Heath]] proved unsuitable for brigade training and on 23 June the 12th Gloucesters left Bristol to join 95th Brigade at [[Wensley, North Yorkshire]]. The two reserve or depot companies joined those of the Birmingham Pals at [[Sutton Coldfield]] to continue training. Brigade training started in earnest at Wensley, and 12th Gloucesters was finally adopted by the WO on 23 June 1915. Previously, most of the shooting had been on miniature ranges with .22 ammunition; now the men began weekly musketry courses (12th Gloucesters at [[Whitburn, Tyne and Wear|Whitburn]]) although many of the rifles were worn and defective. In August 32nd Division gathered on [[Salisbury Plain]] to begin final battle training, with 12th Gloucesters in camp at [[Codford]].<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Marks, pp. 79\u201389.</ref>\n\nThe battalion's strength at this time was about 1550, or more than 50 per cent over establishment; during August a large number of skilled men were transferred to other arms, others went to officer cadet training units, and older or unfit men were sent to the 15th (Reserve) Battalion at Sutton Coldfield into which the depot companies had been absorbed. Now that the battalion was almost ready to go overseas, the 59-year-old Lt-Col Burges was ordered to remain in the UK. He was succeeded in command by Lt-Col [[Martin Archer-Shee]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], a former Regular Army officer who was now [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Finsbury Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Finsbury Central]].<ref name = James/><ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Daniell227/><ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Marks, pp. 89\u201390, 95.</ref>\n\n==Service==\nOn 11 November 1915 32nd Division was ordered to join the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and 12th Gloucesters landed at [[Boulogne]] on 21 November. By 28 November the division had concentrated round [[Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher]], north of the [[Somme (river)|River Somme]]. For its initiation into trench warfare with experienced units of [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Division]], 12th Gloucesters moved into a section of trenches thick with mud at [[Maricourt, Somme|Maricourt]] on 6 December. A Company was with 1st Bn [[East Surrey Regiment]] for instruction, and B Company with 2nd Bn [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]]. 95th Brigade was exchanged with a brigade from 5th Division on 26 December as part of a policy to even-up experience levels between formations. The Pals battalions were scattered among 5th Division's brigades; although 12th Gloucesters remained with 95th Brigade, it was now brigaded with three Regular Army battalions that had been fighting since the beginning of the war.<ref name = Grist54/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Grist, pp. 97\u20138.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 95\u2013106.</ref><ref name = Becke5>Becke, Part 1, pp, 65\u201371.</ref>\n[[File:Daily_Mail_Postcard_-The_High_Street_of_Guillemont.jpg|thumb|right|The high street of Guillemont, captured on 3 September.]]\n===Somme===\n5th Division moved to the [[Arras]] sector in mid-February 1916, and 12th Gloucesters took over dry, well-made trenches with deep dug-outs, and lived in cellars in Arras when out of the line.<ref>Grist, p. 100.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 111\u20135.</ref> Steel helmets began to be issued to British troops early in 1916, but there were great shortages: Lt-Col Archer-Shee used his position as an MP and own observations in the trenches to ask embarrassing questions of the [[Under-Secretary of State for War]].<ref name = Daniell227/>\n\nThe battalion's first real taste of offensive warfare came during the [[Battle of the Somme]]. The offensive had begun on 1 July, and 5th Division took over part of the line in the Delville Wood sector near [[Longueval]] between 18 and 20 July, where 95th Brigade was to deal with German strongpoints in the orchards. When the commander of 95th Brigade, [[Brigadier_(United_Kingdom)#Historical_rank_of_brigadier_general|Brigadier-General]] C.R. Ballard, was wounded on 20 July, Lt-Col Archer-Shee took temporary command until Brig-Gen Lord Esme Gordon-Lennox arrived to take over.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Marks, pp. 118\u20139.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 106\u20137, 141.</ref> From 23 to 26 July the battalion was in the front line and was heavily shelled, with [[High explosive shell|high explosive]], [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] and [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas]], suffering many casualties. It went back into Longueval on 28 July, when the line was advanced to 'Duke Street' without opposition, but shelling was heavier than ever. At 15.30 next day 95th Brigade attacked to complete the capture of Longueval in support of the main attack (the [[Battle of Delville Wood]]). 12th Gloucesters put in two companies on the left of the brigade after a half-hour bombardment, and they successfully advanced the line some {{convert|500|yd|m}} beyond Duke Street. The battalion held these positions until relieved next day.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, pp. 140\u20131.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 119\u201327.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, p. 160.</ref>\n[[File:Glosters_at_Guillemont.png|thumb|right|12th Bn Gloucesters' attack at Guillemont, 3 September 1916.]]\nThe phase of the offensive that began on 22 July culminated in the [[Battle of Guillemont]]. The village of [[Guillemont]] had withstood repeated British attacks, but 5th Division made a new attempt on 3 September. The bombardment began at 08.30 and the attack began at 12.00, with the men advancing behind a [[Creeping barrage]] (a recent innovation) moving at {{convert|50|yd|m}} a minute; the men were instructed to keep within {{convert|25|yd|m}} of the bursting shells. However, a flanking position at Falfemont Farm, which should have been captured in the morning, was still in enemy hands and threatened 95th Brigade's advance. The two leading companies of 12th Gloucesters took their first objective, a sunken lane, and found the [[Dugout_(shelter)#World_War_I|dugouts]] beyond to be unoccupied. But then they came under [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire from a machine gun off to the right in the Falfemont direction, which caused numerous casualties before A Company eliminated it. At 12.50 the battalion moved on to its second objective, the German line between Wedge Wood and the south of Guillemont village, which was taken without too much trouble. It then moved on at 14.50 to the third objective, a sunken lane running north from Wedge Wood towards [[Ginchy]]. Amidst the devastation of the battlefield C Company mistook Leuze Wood for Wedge Wood, got too far ahead and were caught by their own artillery fire. Although no enemy could be seen at Leuze Wood, the battalion was ordered to halt and consolidate its position rather than push into an awkward [[Salient (military)|salient]].<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist151>Grist, pp. 151\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 132\u201340.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 252\u20134; Sketch 32.</ref>\n[[File:The_Battle_of_the_Somme,_July-november_1916_Q4287.jpg|thumb|left|12th Gloucesters moving up in support near Ginchy, 25 September 1916.]]\nThe 12th Gloucesters was now only 300 strong and took no active part in the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette|Flers-Courcelette]] (18\u201322 September) though the battalion was later awarded it as a [[Battle honour]]. Although the battalion had been told that it would not have to go back into the line, it received a draft of 116 reinforcements and was given a role in 95th Brigade's next attack, the [[Battle of Morval|Morval]] on 25 September. The battalion was in support while 1st Bn [[Devonshire Regiment]] and 1st Bn East Surreys suffered heavy casualties taking the first and second objectives. 12th Gloucesters and 2nd [[King's Own Scottish Borderers]] then moved through the village of Morval itself and dug in on the far side. The battalion's casualties were 12 killed and 61 wounded. The next night the battalion was relieved and went into camp in Happy Valley.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist151/><re>Marks, pp. 146\u20138.</ref>\n<ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 373\u20135.</ref>\n\nAccording to Lt-Col Archer-Shee, of the 950 members of 12th Gloucesters who entered the Battle of the Somme, 736 became casualties.<ref>Marks, p. 149.</ref> After the end of the Somme offensive the battalion continued to do duty in the appalling trenches in the area, alternating with tents in devastated [[Mametz, Somme|Mamez Wood]]. 5th Division moved to the [[B\u00e9thune]] sector in October and spent the next six months in this quieter area. On 22 October Lt-Col Archer-Shee returned to the UK for treatment to an old wound and was succeeded on 20 November by Lt-Col Robert Rawson, a Regular officer of the Gloucesters who had commanded 6th [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] for two years. Rawson also acted as 95th Brigade's commander during the winter. Archer-Shee returned to the battalion in January 1917, but resigned his command on 10 February 1917 to devote himself to his parliamentary duties. Rawson returned from Brigade HQ on 18 March and took over full command.<ref>Grist, pp. 182\u20137.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 150\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Arras===\n12th Gloucesters was in reserve to the [[Canadian Corps]] for the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] on 9 April. Then on the night of 4/5 May, as the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras Offensive]] continued, 95th Brigade relieved a Canadian Brigade that had captured [[Fresnoy-en-Gohelle|Fresnoy]]. Because of casualties, 12th Gloucesters was reduced to three companies, so it had two companies of 1st [[Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry]] (DCLI) under its command in order to hold the wood north of the town. During 7 May the British trenches were heavily bombarded, then that night two successive attacks came in. 12th Gloucesters repulsed the first at 03.45 (which may have been an unplanned clash as the German storm troops moved into position) but the battalion was overwhelmed by the second attack at 05.45, which completely broke through the British lines and recaptured Fresnoy. Rawson sent up D Company DCLI and his own C Company to try to restore the situation, followed later by D Company 12th Gloucesters, but all they could do was hold a sunken lane behind the lost positions until relieved at 10.00. The battalion lost 389 casualties, including 94 dead; A and B Companies had completely disappeared, killed or captured, and there were no officers left in the frontline companies.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Falls, ''1917'', Vol I, pp. 520\u20131.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 188\u201393.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 157\u201365.</ref>\n\n===Ypres===\n[[File:Hill-62-Museum-Tranches-Ypres-Belgium.jpg|thumb|right|Preserved trenches at [[Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62]]: when 12th Gloucesters were stationed here it was 'an unimaginably foul and miserable place'. There were no trees left and the battalion was sheltering in shell craters and dugouts.<ref>Grist, p. 213.</ref>]]\nThe battered battalions were slowly built up to strength and trained hard, but 12th Gloucesters did not see major action again until the latter stages of the [[Battle of Passchendaele|Third Ypres Offensive]]. 5th Division moved into [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps']] area on the night of 2/3 October during the [[Battle of Polygon Wood]], then attacked on 4 October (the [[Battle of Broodseinde]]). Launched at 06.00, 95th Brigade advanced {{convert|500|yd|m}} with the help of a tank to deal with German [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]]. 12th Gloucesters had been in reserve to the attacking battalion, 1st [[East Surrey Regiment]], and moved three companies up into the Surreys' forming-up trenches 40 minutes after Zero hour, where they suffered badly from the German counter-barrage. Later in the morning C Company was sent up to help 1st [[Devonshire Regiment]]. The following day the battalion held the captured line, under continuing artillery fire. In preparation for the next attack (the [[Battle of Poelcappelle]] on 9 October), 12th Gloucesters was in [[Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62|Sanctuary Wood]], where it was under observation and artillery fire from the enemy and movement was restricted to duckboard tracks. On 8 October the battalion was split, with two companies providing carrying parties and the other two in the support line behind 1st Bn [[Cheshire Regiment]]. When the attack was delivered, the companies in Sanctuary Wood provided carrying and burial parties, while the two in the support line were pinned by artillery and could not be relieved until 10/11 October. Despite not actually attacking itself, 12th Gloucesters lost 359 casualties (150 from gas), of whom 88 died, in the period 1\u201312 October.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds, ''1917'', Vol II, pp. 314, 334.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 210\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 167\u201370.</ref>\n\nWhile 5th Division continued to attack (the Second Battle of Passchendaele), 12th Gloucesters remained out of the line after Poelcapelle, resting, absorbing a few reinforcements, and training. It spent two short spells holding the line, suffering only light casualties, and then the whole division was pulled out. At the end of October Lt-Col Rawson left the battalion for a six-month tour of duty in the UK and the second-in-command, Maj H.A. Colt, was promoted to succeed him.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, p. 214.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 170\u20131.</ref>\n\n===Italy===\nFollowing the Austro-German breakthrough at the [[Battle of Caporetto]], the BEF was required to release divisions to reinforce the [[Italian Army]]. On 23 November, 5th Division was warned that it would be moved to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]]. Entrainment began at [[Hesdin]] on 27 November, but after A and C Companies were got away, B and D were held back under orders to move at a moment's notice to the [[Cambrai]] sector, where the German counter-attack following the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] threatened to break through. The fighting died down after 3 December, and the two companies were released. 5th Division completed its concentration to the east of the [[Brenta (river)|River Brenta]], not far from [[Padua]], by 20 December. When 5th Division took over part of the line along the [[Piave (river)|River Piave]] on 27 January 1918 12th Gloucesters relieved an Italian unit, and was ordered to wear Italian helmets to conceal the fact that British troops had taken over. The battalion carried out several fighting patrols against the opposing Hungarian units until 5th Division was relieved on 18 March.<ref name = James/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds, ''1917'', Vol II, pp. 352, 391.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 222\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 174\u201380.</ref>\n\n===Spring Offensive===\nThe Germans began their [[Spring Offensive]] on the Western Front on 21 March and achieved rapid successes. On 24 March 5th Division was warned that it would return to France. Entrainment began on 1 April, 12th Gloucesters started on 2 April, and the division completed its concentration between [[Doullens]] and [[Fr\u00e9vent]] on 9 April.<ref name = James/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, pp. 224, 267.</ref><ref>Marks, p. 181.</ref>\n[[File:British_Lewis_gun_team_Battle_of_Hazebrouck_1918_IWM_Q_10902.jpg|thumb|right|A British Lewis gun team at the Battle of Hazebrouck]]\nThe second phase of the Spring Offensive (Operation Georgette, or the [[Battle_of_the_Lys_(1918)|Battle of the Lys]]) had opened on 7 April and 5th Division took up positions from the Lys Canal to the [[Nieppe|Forest of Nieppe]], where it came under immediate attack (the [[Battle_of_the_Lys_(1918)#Battle_of_Hazebrouck_(12\u201315_April)|Battle of Hazebrouck]]). On 13 April 12th Gloucesters held off one German attack for the loss of 76 casualties, including 18 killed. By 15 April the battalion was well dug in and held off another attack. The battalion was out of the line from 16 to 21 April, and then carried out an attack of its own on 22 April. Close behind a creeping barrage it captured Le Vert Bois Farm (later renamed 'Gloucester Farm') without serious opposition, but it took all day to take Le Vert Bois itself. The battalion captured three German machine guns and 39 prisoners. The Germans abandoned Operation Georgette a few days later. <ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, p. 267.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 182\u20135.</ref>\n\nOn 28 June the British launched a limited operation to improve their positions along the edge of the Nieppe Forest. 12th Gloucesters was tasked with capturing Le Cornet Perdu, moving up in darkness to attack at 06.00. It took all its objectives by 09.30, and pushed patrols up to the PLate Becq river, though a handful of German machine guns had caused 164 casualties, of whom 45 died.<ref name = Becke5/> <ref>Grist, p. 270.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 186\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Hundred Days Offensive===\nThe [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] launched their own [[Hundred Days Offensive]] on 8 August 1918, when 5th Division was in reserve. It then came into action at the [[Battle of Albert (1918)|Third Battle of Albert]] on 21 August. This was a three-phase attack, with 5th Division passing through [[37th Division (United Kingdom)|37th Division ]] for the second phase. 95th Brigade led, with 12th Gloucesters as its reserve. Once the second objective had been taken, 12th Gloucesters took over and despite having lost the barrage advanced over a mile of open country with some of 1st East Surreys and just reached the Arras\u2013[[Albert, Somme|Albert]] railway before meeting stronger opposition. Mist now hampered the artillery and tanks and the battalion was unable to push beyond the railway to the final objective. It had lost an officer and 11 other ranks killed, and nearly100 wounded. Next day the battalion consolidated, then drove off a German counter-attack at 17.30, capturing 180 prisoners and five machine guns in the process. On 23 August, reinforced by two companies of 1st DCLI, the battalion launched an attack at 11.00 behind a creeping barrage to capture the railway line itself. The Germans had numerous machine gun nests along it and caused numerous casualties before they were overrun. Having lost the barrage, the battalion was unable to advance beyond the ridge to [[Irles]], and requested reinforcements. Before they arrived, the neighbouring brigade attacked, so Lt-Col Colt led a charge by the remainder of 12th Gloucesters and the DCLI companies to capture the village, though losses were heavy: 30 men were killed and nine officers and 170 men wounded, including Lt-Col Colt (who was awarded the DSO). The previous CO, Lt-Col Rawson, returned to command the battalion.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Edmonds, ''1918'', Vol IV, pp. 191, 229\u201330.</ref><ref name = Grist275>Grist, p. 275.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 189\u201393.</ref> \n\nThe weakened battalion was withdrawn into reserve while the rest of 95th Brigade attacked on 30 August (the [[Battle of the Scarpe (1918)|Battle of the Scarpe]]) and then took over holding part of the front line. 95th Brigade was relieved on 4 September after the conclusion of the [[Second Battle of Bapaume]]. Part of 5th Division went into action at the [[Battle of \u00c9pehy]] on 18 September, and  12th Gloucesters later received the battle honour despite not being engaged.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist275/><ref>Edmonds, ''1918'', Vol IV, p. 363, 493.</ref><ref name = Grist279>Grist, p, 279.</ref>\n\nAll the Allied armies began a rolling offensive all the way along the Western Front on 26 September. The BEF's [[Third Army (United Kingdom)|Third Army]] stormed across the [[Battle of the Canal du Nord|Canal du Nord]] on 27 September, and next morning 5th Division launched a follow-up attack. Because the designated assault brigade ([[13th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|13th Brigade]]) had suffered heavy casualties, 95th Brigade was substituted for it at short notice and only just got to the jumping-off position in time for Zero hour at 02.40. It ran into considerable opposition and 12th Gloucesters found both its flanks were open; 1st DCLI came up on the left later, but the right remained  exposed and isolated German machine gun posts had to be dealt with using [[Rifle grenade|rifle grenades]]. It was not until 08.00 that the first village was taken. The brigade then had to resort to trench warfare methods to work its way up to the second objective on the slopes of Welsh Ridge by evening. 95th Brigade was also hung up when it attacked again next day, finding the pace of the creeping barrage too fast over broken ground. By the time it was relieved on 30 September 12th Gloucesters' casualties amounted to 52, 24 of them fatal, though it had taken about 120 prisoners.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist279/><ref>Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, ''1918'', Vol V, pp. 48, 118.</ref>\n\n==Disbandment==\nWhile 5th Division had been in Italy, the BEF's manpower shortage led to infantry brigades being reduced from four to three battalions. 5th Division's brigades had retained the four-battalion establishment, but by late 1918 the shortage of manpower was critical, and the division had to fall in line. As the only New Army battalion in 95th Brigade, 12th Gloucesters was ordered to disband and the remaining men were drafted to other units. 12th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, (Bristol's Own) commenced disbandment on 19 October 1918 while the [[Battle of the Selle]] was raging. Most of D Company was posted to 14th Warwicks, which became the divisional pioneer battalion. Others went to 1st Devons and 1st DCLI. The war ended less than a month later when the [[Armistice with Germany]] came into effect.<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, ''1918'', Vol V, p. 338.</ref><ref name = Marks194>Marks, p. 194.</ref>\n\nDuring its service the battalion had suffered losses of 32 officers and 754 other ranks killed. Of the original 990 men who landed in France in November 1915, 205 had died with the battalion, and over 100 more after being posted to other units.<ref name = Daniell227/><ref name = Marks194/><ref name = DaniellApp>Daniell, Appendix I.</ref>\n\n==15th (Reserve) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment==\n15th (Reserve) Battalion was formed at Sutton Coldfield on 31 August 1915 from the depot companies of the 12th (Bristol's Own) and 14th (West of England) Battalions of the Gloucesters. The 14th (Service) Battalion was a '[[Bantam (military)|Bantam]]' battalion that had been raised by the Bristol Citizens' Recruiting Committee on 22 April 1915. It moved to [[Chiseldon|Chiseldon Camp]] and joined [[22nd Reserve Brigade]]. The CO from 10 August 1915 to 31 August 1916 was Lt-Col Stephen Willcock. On 1 September 1916 it became 93rd Training Reserve Battalion in 22nd Reserve Bde and on 4 July 1917 it was redesignated 262nd (Infantry) Battalion of the Training Reserve. When the Training Reserve was reorganised in late 1917, the battalion became 51st (Graduated) Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment.<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Grist, p. 56.</ref><ref>[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/royal-warwickshire-regiment/ Warwicks at Long, Long Trail.]</ref>\n\n==Commanding officers==\nThe following commanded the battalion during its service:<ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Marks, p 152 & Appendix I.</ref>\n* Lt-Col William Burges from 1 September 1914 to 12 August 1915\n* Lt-Col [[Martin Archer-Shee]] from 12 August 1915 to 22 October 1916\n* Maj W.A.R.

The city's Colston Hall was opened as a recruiting centre on 14 August, and 2274 men enlisted by 2 September. Eighty men calling themselves the Weston Comrades Company also joined from [[Weston-super-Mare]]. It was clear that many of these men wanted to serve together in a special Bristol battalion, similar to other '[[Pals battalion]]s' being formed around the country. The [[War Office]] (WO) gave the committee authority to form the '''Bristol Battalion''', [[Gloucestershire Regiment]], on 30 August. Later in the year it became part of Kitchener's Fifth New Army (K5) and was officially numbered as the '''12th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment (Bristol)''', but the subtitle was usually rendered as 'Bristol's Own'. The recruiting committee encouraged 'mercantile and professional' men to apply, both through reasons of social exclusiveness and with a view to Kitchener's directive that workers in vital industries could not be spared. The first commanding officer (CO) was William Burges, who had retired from command of the 3rd Militia Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment some years before. Several of the other officers appointed had experience in the Regular or Auxiliary forces, and a number of junior officers had been members of their school or university [[Officer Training Corps]].<ref>Marks, pp. 8\u201320, 32\u20133, 39.</ref><ref name = Grist54>Grist, pp. 54\u20135.</ref><ref name = Daniell227>Daniell, p. 227.</ref><ref>Army Council Instructions, October 1914, Appendix VIII; December 1914, Appendix III.</ref><ref name = Frederick>Frederick, p. 102.</ref><ref name = James>James, p. 72.</ref><ref name = TrailGlos>[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/gloucestershire-regiment/ Glosters at Long, Long Trail.]</ref><ref name = GlosCO>[http://www.ww1infantrycos.co.uk/gloucs.html Glosters at Infantry Battalion COs.]</ref>\n\n==Training==\nThe rush of recruits had overwhelmed the Army's ability to absorb them, so the Pals Battalions of K5 were left for some time in the hands of the recruiting committees. Initially the Bristol men lived at home and drilled by squads at Colston Hall in their civilian clothes, distinguished only by a lapel badge bearing the words 'New Bristol Battalion Gloucestershire Regt'. They then began battalion drills at the Artillery Grounds in [[Whiteladies Road]], the headquarters of the [[Gloucestershire Volunteer Artillery|I South Midland (Gloucestershire) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery]] of the [[Territorial Force]]. But in late September the recruiting committee persuaded the WO to buy up the site of the abandoned Bristol International Exhibition in Greville Smyth Park, the buildings of which were converted into barracks by the [[Royal Engineers]] and [[Army Service Corps]]. The 'Weston Comrades' joined the rest of the battalion here in November and were posted to D Company. Some of the battalion's best men were already being posted away, for officer training for example, and on 30 November the WO authorised the recruiting committee to raise a fifth, reserve company (E Company); F Company was raised as a further reserve in April 1915. Old rifles had been issued to the battalion for drill purposes, with just a few modern [[Lee-Enfield|Lee-Enfield]] .303 SMLE rifles for musketry training. Uniforms were finally received in December 1914. In March 1915 the battalion began field training by companies at [[Chipping Sodbury]].<ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Marks, pp. 22\u201331, 40\u201351, 69, 71.</ref>[http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Gloucestershire/TownBristol.htm Bristol at Drill Hall Project.]</ref>\n\nThe locally-raised units to form K5 were assigned to brigades on 10 December 1914: the Bristol Battalion was brigaded with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd [[Birmingham Pals]] (later 14th, 15th and 16th (Service) Battalions, [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]]). The brigade was\ninitially numbered 116th Brigade in 39th Division, but in April 1915 the WO decided to convert the K4 battalions into reserve units to train reinforcements for the K1\u2013K3 units, and on 27 April the K5 divisions were renumbered to take up the designations of the K4 formations. The short-lived 39th Division thus became [[32nd Division (United Kingdom)|32nd Division]] and 116th Brigade became [[95th Brigade (United Kingdom)|95th Brigade]].<ref name = TrailGlos/><ref>Army Council Instruction No 101 (10 December 1914).</ref><ref>Becke, Pt 3b, Appendix I2</ref><ref name = Becke32>Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 21\u201328.</ref><ref>Marks, p. 64.</ref>\n\nIn May 1915 the brigade was to have gathered in [[Shropshire]], but the ground selected at [[Prees Heath Army Camp|Prees Heath]] proved unsuitable for brigade training and on 23 June the 12th Gloucesters left Bristol to join 95th Brigade at [[Wensley, North Yorkshire]]. The two reserve or depot companies joined those of the Birmingham Pals at [[Sutton Coldfield]] to continue training. Brigade training started in earnest at Wensley, and 12th Gloucesters was finally adopted by the WO on 23 June 1915. Previously, most of the shooting had been on miniature ranges with .22 ammunition; now the men began weekly musketry courses (12th Gloucesters at [[Whitburn, Tyne and Wear|Whitburn]]) although many of the rifles were worn and defective. In August 32nd Division gathered on [[Salisbury Plain]] to begin final battle training, with 12th Gloucesters in camp at [[Codford]].<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Marks, pp. 79\u201389.</ref>\n\nThe battalion's strength at this time was about 1550, or more than 50 per cent over establishment; during August a large number of skilled men were transferred to other arms, others went to officer cadet training units, and older or unfit men were sent to the 15th (Reserve) Battalion at Sutton Coldfield into which the depot companies had been absorbed. Now that the battalion was almost ready to go overseas, the 59-year-old Lt-Col Burges was ordered to remain in the UK. He was succeeded in command by Lt-Col [[Martin Archer-Shee]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], a former Regular Army officer who was now [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Finsbury Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Finsbury Central]].<ref name = James/><ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Daniell227/><ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Marks, pp. 89\u201390, 95.</ref>\n\n==Service==\nOn 11 November 1915 32nd Division was ordered to join the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and 12th Gloucesters landed at [[Boulogne]] on 21 November. By 28 November the division had concentrated round [[Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher]], north of the [[Somme (river)|River Somme]]. For its initiation into trench warfare with experienced units of [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Division]], 12th Gloucesters moved into a section of trenches thick with mud at [[Maricourt, Somme|Maricourt]] on 6 December. A Company was with 1st Bn [[East Surrey Regiment]] for instruction, and B Company with 2nd Bn [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]]. 95th Brigade was exchanged with a brigade from 5th Division on 26 December as part of a policy to even-up experience levels between formations. The Pals battalions were scattered among 5th Division's brigades; although 12th Gloucesters remained with 95th Brigade, it was now brigaded with three Regular Army battalions that had been fighting since the beginning of the war.<ref name = Grist54/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Grist, pp. 97\u20138.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 95\u2013106.</ref><ref name = Becke5>Becke, Part 1, pp, 65\u201371.</ref>\n[[File:Daily_Mail_Postcard_-The_High_Street_of_Guillemont.jpg|thumb|right|The high street of Guillemont, captured on 3 September.]]\n===Somme===\n5th Division moved to the [[Arras]] sector in mid-February 1916, and 12th Gloucesters took over dry, well-made trenches with deep dug-outs, and lived in cellars in Arras when out of the line.<ref>Grist, p. 100.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 111\u20135.</ref> Steel helmets began to be issued to British troops early in 1916, but there were great shortages: Lt-Col Archer-Shee used his position as an MP and own observations in the trenches to ask embarrassing questions of the [[Under-Secretary of State for War]].<ref name = Daniell227/>\n\nThe battalion's first real taste of offensive warfare came during the [[Battle of the Somme]]. The offensive had begun on 1 July, and 5th Division took over part of the line in the Delville Wood sector near [[Longueval]] between 18 and 20 July, where 95th Brigade was to deal with German strongpoints in the orchards. When the commander of 95th Brigade, [[Brigadier_(United_Kingdom)#Historical_rank_of_brigadier_general|Brigadier-General]] C.R. Ballard, was wounded on 20 July, Lt-Col Archer-Shee took temporary command until Brig-Gen Lord Esme Gordon-Lennox arrived to take over.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Marks, pp. 118\u20139.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 106\u20137, 141.</ref> From 23 to 26 July the battalion was in the front line and was heavily shelled, with [[High explosive shell|high explosive]], [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] and [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas]], suffering many casualties. It went back into Longueval on 28 July, when the line was advanced to 'Duke Street' without opposition, but shelling was heavier than ever. At 15.30 next day 95th Brigade attacked to complete the capture of Longueval in support of the main attack (the [[Battle of Delville Wood]]). 12th Gloucesters put in two companies on the left of the brigade after a half-hour bombardment, and they successfully advanced the line some {{convert|500|yd|m}} beyond Duke Street. The battalion held these positions until relieved next day.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, pp. 140\u20131.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 119\u201327.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, p. 160.</ref>\n[[File:Glosters_at_Guillemont.png|thumb|right|12th Bn Gloucesters' attack at Guillemont, 3 September 1916.]]\nThe phase of the offensive that began on 22 July culminated in the [[Battle of Guillemont]]. The village of [[Guillemont]] had withstood repeated British attacks, but 5th Division made a new attempt on 3 September. The bombardment began at 08.30 and the attack began at 12.00, with the men advancing behind a [[Creeping barrage]] (a recent innovation) moving at {{convert|50|yd|m}} a minute; the men were instructed to keep within {{convert|25|yd|m}} of the bursting shells. However, a flanking position at Falfemont Farm, which should have been captured in the morning, was still in enemy hands and threatened 95th Brigade's advance. The two leading companies of 12th Gloucesters took their first objective, a sunken lane, and found the [[Dugout_(shelter)#World_War_I|dugouts]] beyond to be unoccupied. But then they came under [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire from a machine gun off to the right in the Falfemont direction, which caused numerous casualties before A Company eliminated it. At 12.50 the battalion moved on to its second objective, the German line between Wedge Wood and the south of Guillemont village, which was taken without too much trouble. It then moved on at 14.50 to the third objective, a sunken lane running north from Wedge Wood towards [[Ginchy]]. Amidst the devastation of the battlefield C Company mistook Leuze Wood for Wedge Wood, got too far ahead and were caught by their own artillery fire. Although no enemy could be seen at Leuze Wood, the battalion was ordered to halt and consolidate its position rather than push into an awkward [[Salient (military)|salient]].<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist151>Grist, pp. 151\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 132\u201340.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 252\u20134; Sketch 32.</ref>\n[[File:The_Battle_of_the_Somme,_July-november_1916_Q4287.jpg|thumb|left|12th Gloucesters moving up in support near Ginchy, 25 September 1916.]]\nThe 12th Gloucesters was now only 300 strong and took no active part in the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette|Flers-Courcelette]] (18\u201322 September) though the battalion was later awarded it as a [[Battle honour]]. Although the battalion had been told that it would not have to go back into the line, it received a draft of 116 reinforcements and was given a role in 95th Brigade's next attack, the [[Battle of Morval|Morval]] on 25 September. The battalion was in support while 1st Bn [[Devonshire Regiment]] and 1st Bn East Surreys suffered heavy casualties taking the first and second objectives. 12th Gloucesters and 2nd [[King's Own Scottish Borderers]] then moved through the village of Morval itself and dug in on the far side. The battalion's casualties were 12 killed and 61 wounded. The next night the battalion was relieved and went into camp in Happy Valley.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist151/><re>Marks, pp. 146\u20138.</ref>\n<ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 373\u20135.</ref>\n\nAccording to Lt-Col Archer-Shee, of the 950 members of 12th Gloucesters who entered the Battle of the Somme, 736 became casualties.<ref>Marks, p. 149.</ref> After the end of the Somme offensive the battalion continued to do duty in the appalling trenches in the area, alternating with tents in devastated [[Mametz, Somme|Mamez Wood]]. 5th Division moved to the [[B\u00e9thune]] sector in October and spent the next six months in this quieter area. On 22 October Lt-Col Archer-Shee returned to the UK for treatment to an old wound and was succeeded on 20 November by Lt-Col Robert Rawson, a Regular officer of the Gloucesters who had commanded 6th [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] for two years. Rawson also acted as 95th Brigade's commander during the winter. Archer-Shee returned to the battalion in January 1917, but resigned his command on 10 February 1917 to devote himself to his parliamentary duties. Rawson returned from Brigade HQ on 18 March and took over full command.<ref>Grist, pp. 182\u20137.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 150\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Arras===\n12th Gloucesters was in reserve to the [[Canadian Corps]] for the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] on 9 April. Then on the night of 4/5 May, as the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras Offensive]] continued, 95th Brigade relieved a Canadian Brigade that had captured [[Fresnoy-en-Gohelle|Fresnoy]]. Because of casualties, 12th Gloucesters was reduced to three companies, so it had two companies of 1st [[Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry]] (DCLI) under its command in order to hold the wood north of the town. During 7 May the British trenches were heavily bombarded, then that night two successive attacks came in. 12th Gloucesters repulsed the first at 03.45 (which may have been an unplanned clash as the German storm troops moved into position) but the battalion was overwhelmed by the second attack at 05.45, which completely broke through the British lines and recaptured Fresnoy. Rawson sent up D Company DCLI and his own C Company to try to restore the situation, followed later by D Company 12th Gloucesters, but all they could do was hold a sunken lane behind the lost positions until relieved at 10.00. The battalion lost 389 casualties, including 94 dead; A and B Companies had completely disappeared, killed or captured, and there were no officers left in the frontline companies.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Falls, ''1917'', Vol I, pp. 520\u20131.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 188\u201393.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 157\u201365.</ref>\n\n===Ypres===\n[[File:Hill-62-Museum-Tranches-Ypres-Belgium.jpg|thumb|right|Preserved trenches at [[Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62]]: when 12th Gloucesters were stationed here it was 'an unimaginably foul and miserable place'.

Launched at 06.00, 95th Brigade advanced {{convert|500|yd|m}} with the help of a tank to deal with German [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]]. 12th Gloucesters had been in reserve to the attacking battalion, 1st [[East Surrey Regiment]], and moved three companies up into the Surreys' forming-up trenches 40 minutes after Zero hour, where they suffered badly from the German counter-barrage. Later in the morning C Company was sent up to help 1st [[Devonshire Regiment]]. The following day the battalion held the captured line, under continuing artillery fire. In preparation for the next attack (the [[Battle of Poelcappelle]] on 9 October), 12th Gloucesters was in [[Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62|Sanctuary Wood]], where it was under observation and artillery fire from the enemy and movement was restricted to duckboard tracks. On 8 October the battalion was split, with two companies providing carrying parties and the other two in the support line behind 1st Bn [[Cheshire Regiment]]. When the attack was delivered, the companies in Sanctuary Wood provided carrying and burial parties, while the two in the support line were pinned by artillery and could not be relieved until 10/11 October. Despite not actually attacking itself, 12th Gloucesters lost 359 casualties (150 from gas), of whom 88 died, in the period 1\u201312 October.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds, ''1917'', Vol II, pp. 314, 334.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 210\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 167\u201370.</ref>\n\nWhile 5th Division continued to attack (the Second Battle of Passchendaele), 12th Gloucesters remained out of the line after Poelcapelle, resting, absorbing a few reinforcements, and training. It spent two short spells holding the line, suffering only light casualties, and then the whole division was pulled out. At the end of October Lt-Col Rawson left the battalion for a six-month tour of duty in the UK and the second-in-command, Maj H.A. Colt, was promoted to succeed him.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, p. 214.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 170\u20131.</ref>\n\n===Italy===\nFollowing the Austro-German breakthrough at the [[Battle of Caporetto]], the BEF was required to release divisions to reinforce the [[Italian Army]]. On 23 November, 5th Division was warned that it would be moved to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]]. Entrainment began at [[Hesdin]] on 27 November, but after A and C Companies were got away, B and D were held back under orders to move at a moment's notice to the [[Cambrai]] sector, where the German counter-attack following the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] threatened to break through. The fighting died down after 3 December, and the two companies were released. 5th Division completed its concentration to the east of the [[Brenta (river)|River Brenta]], not far from [[Padua]], by 20 December. When 5th Division took over part of the line along the [[Piave (river)|River Piave]] on 27 January 1918 12th Gloucesters relieved an Italian unit, and was ordered to wear Italian helmets to conceal the fact that British troops had taken over. The battalion carried out several fighting patrols against the opposing Hungarian units until 5th Division was relieved on 18 March.<ref name = James/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds, ''1917'', Vol II, pp. 352, 391.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 222\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 174\u201380.</ref>\n\n===Spring Offensive===\nThe Germans began their [[Spring Offensive]] on the Western Front on 21 March and achieved rapid successes. On 24 March 5th Division was warned that it would return to France. Entrainment began on 1 April, 12th Gloucesters started on 2 April, and the division completed its concentration between [[Doullens]] and [[Fr\u00e9vent]] on 9 April.<ref name = James/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, pp. 224, 267.</ref><ref>Marks, p. 181.</ref>\n[[File:British_Lewis_gun_team_Battle_of_Hazebrouck_1918_IWM_Q_10902.jpg|thumb|right|A British Lewis gun team at the Battle of Hazebrouck]]\nThe second phase of the Spring Offensive (Operation Georgette, or the [[Battle_of_the_Lys_(1918)|Battle of the Lys]]) had opened on 7 April and 5th Division took up positions from the Lys Canal to the [[Nieppe|Forest of Nieppe]], where it came under immediate attack (the [[Battle_of_the_Lys_(1918)#Battle_of_Hazebrouck_(12\u201315_April)|Battle of Hazebrouck]]). On 13 April 12th Gloucesters held off one German attack for the loss of 76 casualties, including 18 killed. By 15 April the battalion was well dug in and held off another attack. The battalion was out of the line from 16 to 21 April, and then carried out an attack of its own on 22 April. Close behind a creeping barrage it captured Le Vert Bois Farm (later renamed 'Gloucester Farm') without serious opposition, but it took all day to take Le Vert Bois itself. The battalion captured three German machine guns and 39 prisoners. The Germans abandoned Operation Georgette a few days later. <ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, p. 267.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 182\u20135.</ref>\n\nOn 28 June the British launched a limited operation to improve their positions along the edge of the Nieppe Forest. 12th Gloucesters was tasked with capturing Le Cornet Perdu, moving up in darkness to attack at 06.00. It took all its objectives by 09.30, and pushed patrols up to the PLate Becq river, though a handful of German machine guns had caused 164 casualties, of whom 45 died.<ref name = Becke5/> <ref>Grist, p. 270.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 186\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Hundred Days Offensive===\nThe [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] launched their own [[Hundred Days Offensive]] on 8 August 1918, when 5th Division was in reserve. It then came into action at the [[Battle of Albert (1918)|Third Battle of Albert]] on 21 August. This was a three-phase attack, with 5th Division passing through [[37th Division (United Kingdom)|37th Division ]] for the second phase. 95th Brigade led, with 12th Gloucesters as its reserve. Once the second objective had been taken, 12th Gloucesters took over and despite having lost the barrage advanced over a mile of open country with some of 1st East Surreys and just reached the Arras\u2013[[Albert, Somme|Albert]] railway before meeting stronger opposition. Mist now hampered the artillery and tanks and the battalion was unable to push beyond the railway to the final objective. It had lost an officer and 11 other ranks killed, and nearly100 wounded. Next day the battalion consolidated, then drove off a German counter-attack at 17.30, capturing 180 prisoners and five machine guns in the process. On 23 August, reinforced by two companies of 1st DCLI, the battalion launched an attack at 11.00 behind a creeping barrage to capture the railway line itself. The Germans had numerous machine gun nests along it and caused numerous casualties before they were overrun. Having lost the barrage, the battalion was unable to advance beyond the ridge to [[Irles]], and requested reinforcements. Before they arrived, the neighbouring brigade attacked, so Lt-Col Colt led a charge by the remainder of 12th Gloucesters and the DCLI companies to capture the village, though losses were heavy: 30 men were killed and nine officers and 170 men wounded, including Lt-Col Colt (who was awarded the DSO). The previous CO, Lt-Col Rawson, returned to command the battalion.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Edmonds, ''1918'', Vol IV, pp. 191, 229\u201330.</ref><ref name = Grist275>Grist, p. 275.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 189\u201393.</ref> \n\nThe weakened battalion was withdrawn into reserve while the rest of 95th Brigade attacked on 30 August (the [[Battle of the Scarpe (1918)|Battle of the Scarpe]]) and then took over holding part of the front line. 95th Brigade was relieved on 4 September after the conclusion of the [[Second Battle of Bapaume]]. Part of 5th Division went into action at the [[Battle of \u00c9pehy]] on 18 September, and  12th Gloucesters later received the battle honour despite not being engaged.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist275/><ref>Edmonds, ''1918'', Vol IV, p. 363, 493.</ref><ref name = Grist279>Grist, p, 279.</ref>\n\nAll the Allied armies began a rolling offensive all the way along the Western Front on 26 September. The BEF's [[Third Army (United Kingdom)|Third Army]] stormed across the [[Battle of the Canal du Nord|Canal du Nord]] on 27 September, and next morning 5th Division launched a follow-up attack. Because the designated assault brigade ([[13th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|13th Brigade]]) had suffered heavy casualties, 95th Brigade was substituted for it at short notice and only just got to the jumping-off position in time for Zero hour at 02.40. It ran into considerable opposition and 12th Gloucesters found both its flanks were open; 1st DCLI came up on the left later, but the right remained  exposed and isolated German machine gun posts had to be dealt with using [[Rifle grenade|rifle grenades]]. It was not until 08.00 that the first village was taken. The brigade then had to resort to trench warfare methods to work its way up to the second objective on the slopes of Welsh Ridge by evening. 95th Brigade was also hung up when it attacked again next day, finding the pace of the creeping barrage too fast over broken ground. By the time it was relieved on 30 September 12th Gloucesters' casualties amounted to 52, 24 of them fatal, though it had taken about 120 prisoners.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist279/><ref>Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, ''1918'', Vol V, pp. 48, 118.</ref>\n\n==Disbandment==\nWhile 5th Division had been in Italy, the BEF's manpower shortage led to infantry brigades being reduced from four to three battalions. 5th Division's brigades had retained the four-battalion establishment, but by late 1918 the shortage of manpower was critical, and the division had to fall in line. As the only New Army battalion in 95th Brigade, 12th Gloucesters was ordered to disband and the remaining men were drafted to other units. 12th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, (Bristol's Own) commenced disbandment on 19 October 1918 while the [[Battle of the Selle]] was raging. Most of D Company was posted to 14th Warwicks, which became the divisional pioneer battalion. Others went to 1st Devons and 1st DCLI. The war ended less than a month later when the [[Armistice with Germany]] came into effect.<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, ''1918'', Vol V, p. 338.</ref><ref name = Marks194>Marks, p. 194.</ref>\n\nDuring its service the battalion had suffered losses of 32 officers and 754 other ranks killed. Of the original 990 men who landed in France in November 1915, 205 had died with the battalion, and over 100 more after being posted to other units.<ref name = Daniell227/><ref name = Marks194/><ref name = DaniellApp>Daniell, Appendix I.</ref>\n\n==15th (Reserve) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment==\n15th (Reserve) Battalion was formed at Sutton Coldfield on 31 August 1915 from the depot companies of the 12th (Bristol's Own) and 14th (West of England) Battalions of the Gloucesters. The 14th (Service) Battalion was a '[[Bantam (military)|Bantam]]' battalion that had been raised by the Bristol Citizens' Recruiting Committee on 22 April 1915.

The author was awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 1991 in part due to this paper.\n\n==Summary==\n<blockquote>Given that production could be carried on without any organization, Coase asks, \"Why and under what conditions should we expect firms to emerge?\" Since modern firms can only emerge when an [[entrepreneur]] of some sort begins to hire people, Coase's analysis proceeds by considering the conditions under which it makes sense for an entrepreneur to seek hired help instead of contracting out for some particular task.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://adambrown.info/p/notes/coase_the_nature_of_the_firm|title=Summary of Coase: The nature of the firm -- Adam Brown, BYU Political Science|website=adambrown.info|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional economic theory of the time suggested that, because the market is \"efficient\" (that is, those who are best at providing each good or service most cheaply are already doing so), it should always be cheaper to contract out than to hire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCoase noted, however, that there are a number of [[transaction cost]]s to using the market; the cost of obtaining a good or service via the market is actually more than just the price of the good.

This is a countervailing cost to the use of the firm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCoase argues that the size of a firm (as measured by how many contractual relations are \"internal\" to the firm and how many \"external\") is a result of finding an optimal balance between the competing tendencies of the costs outlined above.  In general, making the firm larger will initially be advantageous, but the decreasing returns indicated above will eventually kick in, preventing the firm from growing indefinitely.\n\nOther things being equal ([[ceteris paribus]]), a firm will tend to be larger:\n\n* the less the costs of organizing and the slower these costs rise with an increase in the transactions organized.\n* the less likely the entrepreneur is to make mistakes and the smaller the increase in mistakes with an increase in the transactions organized.\n* the greater the lowering (or the less the rise) in the supply price of factors of production to firms of larger size.\n\nThe first two costs will increase with the spatial distribution of the transactions organized and the dissimilarity of the transactions. This explains why firms tend to either be in different geographic locations or to perform different functions. Additionally, technology changes that mitigate the cost of organizing transactions across space will cause firms to be larger\u2014the advent of the telephone and cheap air travel, for example, would be expected to increase the size of firms.

{"title_page": "Errors and residuals", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=September 2016}}\n{{Regression bar}}\nIn statistics and optimization, '''errors''' and '''residuals''' are two closely related and easily confused measures of the deviation of an observed value of an element of a statistical sample from its \"theoretical value\". The '''error''' (or '''disturbance''') of an observed value is the deviation of the observed value from the (unobservable) ''true'' value of a quantity of interest (for example, a population mean), and the '''residual''' of an observed value is the difference between the observed value and the ''estimated'' value of the quantity of interest (for example, a sample mean). The distinction is most important in regression analysis, where the concepts are sometimes called the '''regression errors''' and '''regression residuals''' and where they lead to the concept of studentized residuals.\n\n==Introduction==\nSuppose there is a series of observations from a [[univariate distribution]] and we want to estimate the [[mean]] of that distribution (the so-called [[location model (statistics)|location model]]). In this case, the errors are the deviations of the observations from the population mean, while the residuals are the deviations of the observations from the sample mean.\n\nA '''statistical error''' (or '''disturbance''') is the amount by which an observation differs from its [[expected value]], the latter being based on the whole [[statistical population|population]] from which the statistical unit was chosen randomly. For example, if the mean height in a population of 21-year-old men is 1.75 meters, and one randomly chosen man is 1.80 meters tall, then the \"error\" is 0.05 meters; if the randomly chosen man is 1.70 meters tall, then the \"error\" is \u22120.05 meters. The expected value, being the [[arithmetic mean|mean]] of the entire population, is typically unobservable, and hence the statistical error cannot be observed either.\n\nA '''residual''' (or fitting deviation), on the other hand, is an observable ''estimate'' of the unobservable statistical error. Consider the previous example with men's heights and suppose we have a random sample of ''n'' people. The ''[[sample mean]]'' could serve as a good estimator of the ''population'' mean. Then we have:\n* The difference between the height of each man in the sample and the unobservable ''population'' mean is a ''statistical error'', whereas\n* The difference between the height of each man in the sample and the observable ''sample'' mean is a ''residual''.\n\nNote that, because of the definition of the sample mean, the sum of the residuals within a random sample is necessarily zero, and thus the residuals are necessarily ''not [[statistical independence|independent]]''. The statistical errors, on the other hand, are independent, and their sum within the random sample is [[almost surely]] not zero.\n\nOne can standardize statistical errors (especially of a [[normal distribution]]) in a [[z-score]] (or \"standard score\"), and standardize residuals in a [[t-statistic|''t''-statistic]], or more generally [[studentized residuals]].\n\n==In univariate distributions==\n\nIf we assume a [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] population with mean \u03bc and [[standard deviation]] \u03c3, and choose individuals independently, then we have\n\n:<math>X_1, \\dots, X_n\\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\,</math>\n\nand the [[arithmetic mean|sample mean]]\n\n:<math>\\overline{X}={X_1 + \\cdots + X_n \\over n}</math>\n\nis a random variable distributed such that:\n\n:<math>\\overline{X} \\sim N \\left( \\mu, \\frac {\\sigma^2} n \\right).</math>\n\nThe ''statistical errors'' are then\n\n:<math>e_i=X_i-\\mu,\\,</math>\n\nwith [[Expected Value|expected]] values of zero,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Intermediate statistical methods|last=Wetherill, G. Barrie.|date=1981|publisher=Chapman and Hall|isbn=0-412-16440-X|location=London|oclc=7779780|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/intermediatestat0000weth}}</ref> whereas the ''residuals'' are\n\n:<math>r_i=X_i-\\overline{X}.</math>\n\nThe sum of squares of the '''statistical errors''', divided by ''\u03c3''<sup>2</sup>, has a [[chi-squared distribution]] with ''n'' [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]]:\n\n: <math> \\frac 1 {\\sigma^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2\\sim\\chi^2_n.</math>\n\nHowever, this quantity is not observable as the population mean is unknown.  The sum of squares of the '''residuals''', on the other hand, is observable. The quotient of that sum by \u03c3<sup>2</sup> has a chi-squared distribution with only ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 degrees of freedom:\n\n:<math> \\frac 1 {\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n r_i^2 \\sim \\chi^2_{n-1}. </math>\n\nThis difference between ''n'' and ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 degrees of freedom results in [[Bessel's correction]] for the estimation of [[sample variance]] of a population with unknown mean and unknown variance. No correction is necessary if the population mean is known.\n\n===Remark===\n\nIt is remarkable that the [[Squared deviations|sum of squares of the residuals]] and the sample mean can be shown to be independent of each other, using, e.g. [[Basu's theorem]]. That fact, and the normal and chi-squared distributions given above form the basis of calculations involving the  [[t-statistic]]:\n\n:<math> T = \\frac{\\overline{X}_n - \\mu_0}{S_n/\\sqrt{n}}, </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\overline{X}_n - \\mu_0</math> represents the errors, <math>S_n</math> represents the sample standard deviation for a sample of size ''n'', and unknown ''\u03c3'', and the denominator term <math>S_n/\\sqrt n</math> accounts for the standard deviation of the errors according to:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n: <math display=\"block\">\\operatorname{Var}(\\overline{X}_n) = \\frac{\\sigma^2} n</math>\n\nThe probability distributions of the numerator and the denominator separately depend on the value of the unobservable population standard deviation ''\u03c3'', but ''\u03c3'' appears in both the numerator and the denominator and cancels.  That is fortunate because it means that even though we do not know&nbsp;''\u03c3'', we know the probability distribution of this quotient: it has a [[Student's t-distribution]] with ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 degrees of freedom.  We can therefore use this quotient to find a [[confidence interval]] for&nbsp;''\u03bc''. This t-statistic can be interpreted as \"the number of standard errors away from the regression line.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Practical statistics for data scientists : 50 essential concepts|last=Bruce, Peter C., 1953-|others=Bruce, Andrew, 1958-|isbn=978-1-4919-5293-1|edition=First|location=Sebastopol, CA|oclc=987251007|date = 2017-05-10}}</ref>\n\n==Regressions==\n\nIn [[regression analysis]], the distinction between ''errors'' and ''residuals'' is subtle and important, and leads to the concept of [[studentized residual]]s. Given an unobservable function that relates the independent variable to the dependent variable \u2013 say, a line \u2013 the deviations of the dependent variable observations from this function are the unobservable errors. If one runs a regression on some data, then the deviations of the dependent variable observations from the ''fitted'' function are the residuals. If the linear model is applicable, a scatterplot of residuals plotted against the independent variable should be random about zero with no trend to the residuals.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A modern introduction to probability and statistics : understanding why and how|date=2005|publisher=Springer|others=Dekking, Michel, 1946-|isbn=978-1-85233-896-1|location=London|oclc=262680588}}</ref> If the data exhibit a trend, the regression model is likely incorrect; for example, the true function may be a quadratic or higher order polynomial. If they are random, or have no trend, but \"fan out\" - they exhibit a phenomenon called [[heteroscedasticity]]. If all of the residuals are equal, or do not fan out, they exhibit [[homoscedasticity]].\n\nHowever, a terminological difference arises in the expression [[mean squared error]] (MSE). The mean squared error of a regression is a number computed from the sum of squares of the computed ''residuals'', and not of the unobservable ''errors''. If that sum of squares is divided by ''n'', the number of observations, the result is the mean of the squared residuals.

The '''error''' (or '''disturbance''') of an observed value is the deviation of the observed value from the (unobservable) ''true'' value of a quantity of interest (for example, a population mean), and the '''residual''' of an observed value is the difference between the observed value and the ''estimated'' value of the quantity of interest (for example, a sample mean). The distinction is most important in regression analysis, where the concepts are sometimes called the '''regression errors''' and '''regression residuals''' and where they lead to the concept of studentized residuals.\n\n==Introduction==\nSuppose there is a series of observations from a [[univariate distribution]] and we want to estimate the [[mean]] of that distribution (the so-called [[location model (statistics)|location model]]). In this case, the errors are the deviations of the observations from the population mean, while the residuals are the deviations of the observations from the sample mean.\n\nA '''statistical error''' (or '''disturbance''') is the amount by which an observation differs from its [[expected value]], the latter being based on the whole [[statistical population|population]] from which the statistical unit was chosen randomly. For example, if the mean height in a population of 21-year-old men is 1.75 meters, and one randomly chosen man is 1.80 meters tall, then the \"error\" is 0.05 meters; if the randomly chosen man is 1.70 meters tall, then the \"error\" is \u22120.05 meters. The expected value, being the [[arithmetic mean|mean]] of the entire population, is typically unobservable, and hence the statistical error cannot be observed either.\n\nA '''residual''' (or fitting deviation), on the other hand, is an observable ''estimate'' of the unobservable statistical error. Consider the previous example with men's heights and suppose we have a random sample of ''n'' people. The ''[[sample mean]]'' could serve as a good estimator of the ''population'' mean. Then we have:\n* The difference between the height of each man in the sample and the unobservable ''population'' mean is a ''statistical error'', whereas\n* The difference between the height of each man in the sample and the observable ''sample'' mean is a ''residual''.\n\nNote that, because of the definition of the sample mean, the sum of the residuals within a random sample is necessarily zero, and thus the residuals are necessarily ''not [[statistical independence|independent]]''. The statistical errors, on the other hand, are independent, and their sum within the random sample is [[almost surely]] not zero.\n\nOne can standardize statistical errors (especially of a [[normal distribution]]) in a [[z-score]] (or \"standard score\"), and standardize residuals in a [[t-statistic|''t''-statistic]], or more generally [[studentized residuals]].\n\n==In univariate distributions==\n\nIf we assume a [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] population with mean \u03bc and [[standard deviation]] \u03c3, and choose individuals independently, then we have\n\n:<math>X_1, \\dots, X_n\\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\,</math>\n\nand the [[arithmetic mean|sample mean]]\n\n:<math>\\overline{X}={X_1 + \\cdots + X_n \\over n}</math>\n\nis a random variable distributed such that:\n\n:<math>\\overline{X} \\sim N \\left( \\mu, \\frac {\\sigma^2} n \\right).</math>\n\nThe ''statistical errors'' are then\n\n:<math>e_i=X_i-\\mu,\\,</math>\n\nwith [[Expected Value|expected]] values of zero,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Intermediate statistical methods|last=Wetherill, G.

The sum of squares of the '''residuals''', on the other hand, is observable. The quotient of that sum by \u03c3<sup>2</sup> has a chi-squared distribution with only ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 degrees of freedom:\n\n:<math> \\frac 1 {\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n r_i^2 \\sim \\chi^2_{n-1}. </math>\n\nThis difference between ''n'' and ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 degrees of freedom results in [[Bessel's correction]] for the estimation of [[sample variance]] of a population with unknown mean and unknown variance. No correction is necessary if the population mean is known.\n\n===Remark===\n\nIt is remarkable that the [[Squared deviations|sum of squares of the residuals]] and the sample mean can be shown to be independent of each other, using, e.g. [[Basu's theorem]]. That fact, and the normal and chi-squared distributions given above form the basis of calculations involving the  [[t-statistic]]:\n\n:<math> T = \\frac{\\overline{X}_n - \\mu_0}{S_n/\\sqrt{n}}, </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\overline{X}_n - \\mu_0</math> represents the errors, <math>S_n</math> represents the sample standard deviation for a sample of size ''n'', and unknown ''\u03c3'', and the denominator term <math>S_n/\\sqrt n</math> accounts for the standard deviation of the errors according to:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n: <math display=\"block\">\\operatorname{Var}(\\overline{X}_n) = \\frac{\\sigma^2} n</math>\n\nThe probability distributions of the numerator and the denominator separately depend on the value of the unobservable population standard deviation ''\u03c3'', but ''\u03c3'' appears in both the numerator and the denominator and cancels.  That is fortunate because it means that even though we do not know&nbsp;''\u03c3'', we know the probability distribution of this quotient: it has a [[Student's t-distribution]] with ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 degrees of freedom.  We can therefore use this quotient to find a [[confidence interval]] for&nbsp;''\u03bc''. This t-statistic can be interpreted as \"the number of standard errors away from the regression line.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Practical statistics for data scientists : 50 essential concepts|last=Bruce, Peter C., 1953-|others=Bruce, Andrew, 1958-|isbn=978-1-4919-5293-1|edition=First|location=Sebastopol, CA|oclc=987251007|date = 2017-05-10}}</ref>\n\n==Regressions==\n\nIn [[regression analysis]], the distinction between ''errors'' and ''residuals'' is subtle and important, and leads to the concept of [[studentized residual]]s. Given an unobservable function that relates the independent variable to the dependent variable \u2013 say, a line \u2013 the deviations of the dependent variable observations from this function are the unobservable errors. If one runs a regression on some data, then the deviations of the dependent variable observations from the ''fitted'' function are the residuals. If the linear model is applicable, a scatterplot of residuals plotted against the independent variable should be random about zero with no trend to the residuals.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A modern introduction to probability and statistics : understanding why and how|date=2005|publisher=Springer|others=Dekking, Michel, 1946-|isbn=978-1-85233-896-1|location=London|oclc=262680588}}</ref> If the data exhibit a trend, the regression model is likely incorrect; for example, the true function may be a quadratic or higher order polynomial. If they are random, or have no trend, but \"fan out\" - they exhibit a phenomenon called [[heteroscedasticity]]. If all of the residuals are equal, or do not fan out, they exhibit [[homoscedasticity]].\n\nHowever, a terminological difference arises in the expression [[mean squared error]] (MSE). The mean squared error of a regression is a number computed from the sum of squares of the computed ''residuals'', and not of the unobservable ''errors''. If that sum of squares is divided by ''n'', the number of observations, the result is the mean of the squared residuals. Since this is a [[bias (statistics)|biased]]  estimate of the variance of the unobserved errors, the bias is removed by dividing the sum of the squared residuals by ''df'' = ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, instead of ''n'', where ''df'' is the number of [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] (''n'' minus the number of parameters p being estimated - 1).

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost several aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the nine P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they retained three [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-5F and one P2V-3 Neptunes]]. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same armament configuration as the P4Ms, and their dash speed capability came from [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs.

Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA.

This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D.

The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 2000s ===\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost several aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the nine P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they retained three [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-5F and one P2V-3 Neptunes]]. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same armament configuration as the P4Ms, and their dash speed capability came from [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Dean Boys' History of EC-121|url =http://www.dean-boys.com/ec-121.htm|website = www.dean-boys.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf.

The United States launched an assault on the main islands of Kwajalein in the south and Roi-Namur in the north from January 31, 1944, to February 3, 1944.  The Japanese defenders put up a stiff resistance though outnumbered and under-prepared.

Assailed by a tremendous volume of small-arms, mortar and artillery fire as he advanced with one squad of his section in the initial assault wave, Sergeant Cole boldly led his men up the sloping beach toward Airfield Number One despite the blanketing curtain of flying shrapnel and, personally destroying with hand grenades two hostile emplacements which menaced the progress of his unit, continued to move forward until a merciless barrage of fire emanating from three Japanese pillboxes halted the advance. Instantly placing his one remaining machine gun in action, he delivered a shattering fusillade and succeeded in silencing the nearest and most threatening emplacement before his weapon jammed and the enemy, reopening fire with knee mortars and grenades, pinned down his unit for the second time. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation and evolving a daring plan of counterattack, Sergeant Cole, armed solely with a pistol and one grenade, coolly advanced alone to the hostile pillboxes. Hurling his one grenade at the enemy in sudden, swift attack, he quickly withdrew, returned to his own lines for additional grenades and again advanced, attacked, and withdrew. With enemy guns still active, he ran the gauntlet of slashing fire a third time to complete the total destruction of the Japanese strong point and the annihilation of the defending garrison in this final assault. Although instantly killed by an enemy grenade as he returned to his squad, Sergeant Cole had eliminated a formidable Japanese position, thereby enabling his company to storm the remaining fortifications, continue the advance and seize the objective. By his dauntless initiative, unfaltering courage and indomitable determination during a critical period of action, Sergeant Cole served as an inspiration to his comrades, and his stouthearted leadership in the face of almost certain death sustained and enhanced the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.<ref name=USMCWHOSWHO/></blockquote>\n\n===Other honors===\n[[File:USN Arleigh Burke Class Destroyer.JPEG|thumb|right|alt=A modern midsized Naval ship moving through the ocean.

Assailed by a tremendous volume of small-arms, mortar and artillery fire as he advanced with one squad of his section in the initial assault wave, Sergeant Cole boldly led his men up the sloping beach toward Airfield Number One despite the blanketing curtain of flying shrapnel and, personally destroying with hand grenades two hostile emplacements which menaced the progress of his unit, continued to move forward until a merciless barrage of fire emanating from three Japanese pillboxes halted the advance. Instantly placing his one remaining machine gun in action, he delivered a shattering fusillade and succeeded in silencing the nearest and most threatening emplacement before his weapon jammed and the enemy, reopening fire with knee mortars and grenades, pinned down his unit for the second time. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation and evolving a daring plan of counterattack, Sergeant Cole, armed solely with a pistol and one grenade, coolly advanced alone to the hostile pillboxes. Hurling his one grenade at the enemy in sudden, swift attack, he quickly withdrew, returned to his own lines for additional grenades and again advanced, attacked, and withdrew. With enemy guns still active, he ran the gauntlet of slashing fire a third time to complete the total destruction of the Japanese strong point and the annihilation of the defending garrison in this final assault. Although instantly killed by an enemy grenade as he returned to his squad, Sergeant Cole had eliminated a formidable Japanese position, thereby enabling his company to storm the remaining fortifications, continue the advance and seize the objective. By his dauntless initiative, unfaltering courage and indomitable determination during a critical period of action, Sergeant Cole served as an inspiration to his comrades, and his stouthearted leadership in the face of almost certain death sustained and enhanced the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.<ref name=USMCWHOSWHO/></blockquote>\n\n===Other honors===\n[[File:USN Arleigh Burke Class Destroyer.JPEG|thumb|right|alt=A modern midsized Naval ship moving through the ocean.
