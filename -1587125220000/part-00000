The show was hosted by comedian [[Joel McHale]], who provided [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] and [[satire|satirical]] commentary on the various clips.

Originally only to last for one month, the program continued as a live show.\n\nOn November 18, 2015 ''The Soup'' was canceled, the number of episodes that were to be produced was later reduced by one. A decision was made not to air the episode that had been filmed and intended to air the same day as the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]] due to multiple references to \"killing Baby [[Hitler]]\".

The show is broken up into various segments that focus on themes such as reality television shows or shows on E!. The host introduces each clip, which is then played, then comments on the clip before moving on to the next one. There is a live audience on the show, composed of a small group of E! employees, their family, and friends, along with the typical production personnel. The audience is involved in the show, laughing and cheering along with the clips. The 2020 revival includes a second camera position stage right, where the host can present other content on a second auxiliary video display.\n\nAlthough the show is scripted, a large portion of it is ad-libbed.<ref name=\"ew-interview\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20184375,00.html | title=The Q&A: ''Soup'' Guy Joel McHale Answers Your Questions | first=Mandi | last=Bierly | journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=March 14, 2008 | accessdate=March 24, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn April 22, 2008, a blog was started for ''The Soup'' on E!'s website.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.multichannel.com/article/132968-E_Unveils_Revamped_Web_Site.php | title=E!

They include Mankini (a man wearing a bikini top and pants played by Dominic DeLeo, who is also a writer and producer for the show), a dancing maxi pad ([[Tess Rafferty]], a supervising producer and the then-only female writer on ''The Soup''),<ref>{{cite news|last1=Zukey Staff|title=Interview: Tess Rafferty|url=http://zulkey.com/zulkey_test/2012/11/the-tess-rafferty-interview.html|accessdate=November 24, 2016|work=Zukey|date=November 21, 2012}}</ref> two nerds who dress as ''[[Star Wars]]'' characters, an intern named Matt whom McHale shoots with a gun (often with the shooting [[sound effect]] purposefully played out of sync, or even played with other objects or with just fingers), Jewbacca ([[Chewbacca]]'s lawyer), and \"[[Spaghetti Cat]]\", a cat eating spaghetti from ''[[The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet]]''. Additionally, Tom McNamara, The Soup's [[stage manager]] and former stage manager on ''[[Talk Soup]]'', and Kelly Levy (''n\u00e9e'' Andrews), the show's former announcer and a producer, made appearances on the show, with Kelly portraying [[Courtney Stodden]]. Executive producer Edward Boyd's [[chihuahua (dog)|chihuahua]] '''Lou''' appeared regularly in segment openings, most notably the \"Clip of the Week\", and elsewhere in the show. He also appeared with McHale at the show's intro, which showed them watching a different TV show each week until the intro was changed in early 2010.  The replacement intro juxtaposes brief clips introduced by announcer [[Anndi McAfee]] and a \"reaction\" by another clip, wildly out of context.\n\n==Regular features==\n=== 2004\u20132015 episodes ===\nThe show has a number of segments that focus on various genres of television shows. Regular segments include:\n* \"Chat Stew\", which features clips from talk shows. Joel introduces the segment with either, \"Let's have some chat stew, shall we?\" or a reference to the previous clip being used for chat stew. Previously, the intro clip indicates a crockpot showing different talk shows in bubbles inside is shown with a rock intro, then the words CHAT STEW hit the top, cracking it. The  introduction is voiced by producer Kelly Andrews (who also does the show's introduction voice-overs) saying, \"So meaty.\" Audience members sometimes reply with a groan or \"Ew.\" As of 2013, a new intro card shows a kettle sucking up all the TV sets that broadcast different talk shows, then regurgitates them back out. The rock intro and the \"So meaty.\" audios are kept.\n* \"Chicks, Man\" which focuses on female celebrity news. Joel introduces clip with, \"Let's talk about chicks, man.\" and a slightly deep male voice repeats, \"Chicks, man.\" while a picture of baby [[Bird|chicks]] appears on the screen.\n* \"Reality Show Clip Time!\", which features clips from current [[reality television|reality shows]]. Joel introduces a segment with, \"It's reality show clip time.\" (or sometimes total gibberish or other stuff), and the words REALITY SHOW CLIP TIME appear on the screen over a quick rock riff.\n* \"Let's Take Some E!\", a segment featuring clips from other programs shown on E!, jokingly described by McHale as a contractual obligation. The name of the segment (along with its intro) is a reference to the [[party drug]] [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]], which is commonly known as \"E\".\n* The show ends with the \"Clip of the Week\", a clip considered to be the best clip shown on TV in the past week.  After Joel finishes joking about the next-to-last clip, he introduces this one with \"...which brings us to our Clip of the Week.\"\n\n====Other segments====\n''The Soup'' has also featured other recurring segments:\n* \"What's Pissing Off [[Steve Edwards (talk show host)|Steve Edwards]] This Week?\" features clips from [[KTTV]]'s ''[[Good Day L.A.]]'' in which something or somebody makes Steve Edwards upset in the clip. Another episode featured a parody of the segment, \"What's Exciting Rick Dickert This Week?\"\n* \"Tales from Home Shopping\" features clips from home shopping channels such as [[QVC]] or [[Home Shopping Network|HSN]].\n* \"Oprah's Vajayjay\" features clips and or related to Oprah's discussions about the female anatomy.\n* \"What the Kids Are Watching\", whose intro started with a boy and a girl watching TV, and ended with the sound of those children crying uncontrollably, showcases unusual and weird clips from children's shows and commercials aimed at children, such as  ''[[Yo Gabba Gabba!]]''. Two spinoff segments have been produced based on the segment: \"What the Old Folks Are Watching\", which no longer airs, does the same for content geared toward older people, and \"What Your Boyfriend's Looking At\" features clips of shows targeting males with Kelly Andrews asking \"Are you even listening to me?!\" to which a man in the audience nearly always responds with, \"No!\"\n* Segments featuring clips from international programs have also been featured, such as \"Clippos Magnificos\" (which features Spanish programs), \"Souper Fantastic Ultra Wish Time!\" (which features Japanese programs), and the \"International House of Soup.\"\n* \"Cyber Smack\" featured the best viral videos from the internet. This segment eventually spun-off as ''[[Web Soup]]''.\n* \"My Stories\" shows clips from daytime soap operas, such as ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]''. A running gag on the show includes increasingly unrelated and random music being played with the segment's title card.\n* \"The Hollywood Access Extra Inside Entertainment Report\" is an amalgamation of these entertainment news shows ''[[Access Hollywood]]'', ''[[Extra (American TV program)|Extra]]'', ''[[The Insider (TV program)|The Insider]]'', ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]''. At times, Joel would introduce the segment by saying, \"Let's go Inside Extra Access--\" followed by nonsensical gibberish.\n* \"Miley Cyrus News\" documents stories involving [[Miley Cyrus]], which always begins with producer Kelly Andrews yelling \"It's Miley!\" Variations include stories involving [[Britney Spears]] in which a highly modulated voice exclaims, \"It's Britney, bitch!\" or [[Lindsay Lohan]] news in which an overly hoarse and unenthusiastic voice states, \"It's Lindsay\".\n* \"Local Newsbreak\" features embarrassing clips from local newscasts\n* \"Ad Nauseam\" pokes fun at commercials, often with McHale misusing the product after the clip is done.\n* \"The Mail Nurse\" showcases [[viral videos]] found on the Internet and opens with Joel in a nurse's outfit seductively saying \"It's time to check your RAM\" as his nurse's cap clumsily slides off his head.  McHale often comments on how much he hates this intro.\n* \"Stay Out of It [[Nick Lachey]]\" features clips from ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' with cast members saying \"Stay out of it Nick Lachey\"\n* \"Gay Shows\" features clips from [[LGBT]]-related television shows such as ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]''. The segment is introduced with a title card featuring ultra-masculine things such as monster trucks and motorcycles while a heavy rock guitar solo plays. The title card ends with a gruff male voice saying the segment's name.\n* \"Gay Shows: Alaska Edition\" features clips from Alaskan reality shows such as ''[[Gold Rush Alaska]]''. The segment has the same introduction as \"Gay Shows\" except that it has pictures of bears added to the intro.\n* \"Take A Look at Myke Hawke\" involves clips from [[Mykel Hawke]]'s shows.  Typically Joel pronounces his name \"my [[human penis|cock]]\" and make several [[phallic]]-themed jokes while introducing the clip.\n* \"Gavel Bangin'\" is a segment where reality courtroom shows are mocked, especially Nancy Grace's ''Swift Justice''. The title sequence is accompanied with ''The Soup'' voiceover's sexy voice saying, \"All rise.\"\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] News: Features news topics regarding Charlie Sheen. Introduced with a clip of Sheen saying, \"Everything's good, everything's good.\"\n* \"RRRrrr with [[Brian Williams]]\" showcases various clips from Williams' [[NBC]] show \"[[Rock Center with Brian Williams|Rock Center]]\". The segment opens with an angry cat popping up suddenly, and a person imitating the cat growling.\n* \"Unlikely Voice of Reason\" involves a clip in which a much-ridiculed character such as [[Greg Kelly]] or [[Stephanie Pratt]] says something unexpected and intelligent.\n* \"Clippos Magnificos\" which shows clips from the melodramatic [[telenovelas]] shown on Spanish language television. The clips are introduced with an image of a [[pi\u00f1ata]] while [[The Mexican Hat Dance]] plays in the background. The pi\u00f1ata explodes and a man with a strong Spanish accent says \"Are you serious?\". McHale will then mention the name of the show and say \"which I'm pretty sure means...\", then give a ridiculous, comic translation of the show's title in English.\n\n=== 2020\u2013present episodes ===\n{{As of|2020|02|18|df=US}}, the revived series has only aired two episodes, so \"Regular\" is not yet a certainty.\n\n==Recurring jokes==\n\n=== 2004\u20132015 episodes ===\nThe show has a number of recurring jokes and segments. One of the most frequent jokes is Joel McHale making fun of [[Ryan Seacrest]]. He usually comments on Seacrest's height, sexuality, clothing, busy work schedule, income, or demeanor.\n\nJoel has also spoofed other actors, most notably ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' leading man [[David Caruso]], who plays Lieutenant [[Horatio Caine]]. He usually makes fun of the character's tendency to always put on his sunglasses and say corny one-liners at the start of every episode (followed by the first 2\u20133 seconds of the opening sequence). Joel also will sometimes spoof a person after a clip.\n\nJoel also jokes about how self-centered [[Tyra Banks]] is on [[The Tyra Banks Show|her self-titled talk show]].  More jokes are Joel making fun of Spencer Pratt's \"creepy flesh colored beard\" as well as the ages of [[Larry King]] and [[Regis Philbin]] and how they are still alive.  Also, McHale often comically berates or abuses \"interns\" for the show, usually ending with a poorly timed (or sometimes completely out-of-place) audio clip of a gun firing after McHale uses a prop gun on them. McHale has often attempted to \"shoot\" Mankini, but with no effect.\n\nThe [[Spaghetti Cat]] from ''[[The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet]]'' has been used a number of times, usually with a model of the cat rolling in, looking at Joel, and then rolling back out.\n\nJoel has often made fun of [[Bruno Tonioli]]'s flamboyancy while giving comments on ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' stating that he was reading excerpts from his romance novel ''Jazz Hands and Cold Feet''.\n\n''The Soup'' makes jokes at the A&E TV Series, ''[[Steven Seagal: Lawman]]''. Whenever Joel would introduce a clip from the show, a sound clip would say \"That's Right It's Steven Seagal\", followed by Joel drinking a Steven Seagal ''[[energy drink]]'' that would humorously float into frame.\n\nDue to NFL Coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]]'s recent appearance on ''[[Survivor: Nicaragua|Survivor]]'', Joel usually mentions his \"Extenze-enhanced penis\", followed by a clip of Johnson saying, \"I do.\"\n\n====Clips====\nA number of clips have been repeatedly shown on ''The Soup''. One clip features [[Oprah Winfrey]] saying \"My [[vagina|va-jay-jay]] is painin'!\" while hanging from a harness at the Miraval resort.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/fashion/28vajayjay.html | title = What Did You Call It? | work=The New York Times | first = Stephanie | last = Rosenbloom | date = October 28, 2007 | accessdate = March 24, 2008}}</ref> Another clip involves [[Whitney Houston]] yelling \"Kiss My Ass!\" at her husband. McHale has mentioned that this clip is one of his favorites.<ref name=\"ew-interview\" /> Still another clip that is often shown is of ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s news correspondent [[Ann Curry]] starting her report by saying, \"Good morning, good morning everybody, in the news this morning, good morning\", which Olbermann mimicked on his appearance on the July 25, 2008 show. Joel often shows a clip of [[Kendra Wilkinson]] from ''[[The Girls Next Door]]'' laughing. When someone mentions marriage on the show, they will often show a clip of [[Elizabeth Taylor]] screaming \"Marriage?! Noooooo!\" Shorter clips are sometimes used as interjections. Clips of [[Danny Noriega]] (\"I guess some people weren't likin' it!\"), and more recently, [[Tatiana Del Toro]] giggling uncontrollably, have been used as part of McHale's reactions to clips. Recent favorites include [[Gary Busey]] exclaiming \"I'm going to pull your [[endocrine system]] out of your body\", [[Tila Tequila]] yelling out \"A pig's vagina!\", [[Michelle Galdenzi]] from ''[[Scream Queens (2008 TV series)|Scream Queens]]'' saying \"and by record, I mean vagina.\", ''[[Big Brother (U.S.)|Big Brother]]'' contestants [[Big Brother 5 (U.S.)#Jase|Jase Wirey]] and Michelle Costa \"talking\" to one another using animal and computer sounds, respectively; \"[[Tetrazzini|Chicken Tetrazzini]]\" clip from ''[[Maury (TV series)|Maury]]'', Spencer Pratt from ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]'' whispering \"That's the problem\", Billy Bush saying \"It's Gross\", and Kate Gosselin squealing in a chirpy/grating-sounding voice \"Come and Getcher POPcoooooorn!\". Recently, the [[Jeffrey Osborne]] song, \"[[On the Wings of Love (Jeffrey Osborne song)|On the Wings of Love]]\", has been used to mock the current season of ''[[The Bachelor (US TV series)|The Bachelor]]''. Vonda, a woman featured on the [[TruTv]] show ''Over the Limit'' has been featured saying, \"Dunka Doo Balls.\" This clip has become a new favorite. Recently, a clip from ''[[Fantasia for Real]]'' featuring Fantasia's Aunt Bunny saying, \"Gurl Please\", has become a new favorite. Also, a clip of \"Ma\" from TruTV's ''[[Ma's Roadhouse]]'' saying \"He's a douchebag,\" after Joel ask what she thinks of a less than favourable man, such as [[Mel Gibson]], has come into use. Another clip of [[Ryan Seacrest]] saying, \"Hell no, say what\", has been used as reactions to clips. Calvin Tran, a contestant on Bravo's ''[[The Fashion Show (U.S. TV series)|The Fashion Show]]'', has recently been featured in a clip saying, \"Oh, here go Hell Come.\" Frequently following ''Good Day New York'' clips, McHale will ask [[Greg Kelly]] to explain how something works, and this will follow with a clip of Kelly shrugging and saying, \"Science\".\n\n====Edited clips====\n''The Soup'' will often make blatant and obvious edits to clips of shows, often killing off characters (as in their versions of ''[[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County|Laguna Beach]]'' and ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]'') or splicing McHale and other characters into the shows. McHale will often punctuate the clip by saying \"We doctored that.\"  However, if a clip was shown that may have made the audience think that it was edited by ''The Soup'' for broadcast while watching it, McHale would state before hand \"We did not doctor this.\"\n\n====Original content====\nOriginal skits are integrated into the show as responses or jokes to clips. Fake movie trailers and advertisements are created as spoofs to segments or clips. Among the movies spoofed are ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (in reference to McHale's appearance in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]''), '' [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', '' [[Made of Honor]]'', ''[[Righteous Kill]]'', ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia]]'', '' [[Beverly Hills Chihuahua]]'', '' [[Quarantine (2008 film)|Quarantine]]'', (which McHale spoofed with QuaranTween about [[Disney Channel]] celebrities), ''[[Prom Night (2008 film)|Prom Night]]'', ''[[Fast & Furious]]'', and a [[Tyler Perry]] movie.\n\n=== 2020\u2013present episodes ===\n{{As of|2020|02|18|df=US}}, the revived series has only aired two episodes, so  \"Recurring\" is not yet a certainty.\n\n==International broadcasts==\n\n=== 2004\u20132015 episodes ===\n* In Australia, the show aired on the [[E!

Episodes of this nature have been produced on topics such as models and modeling shows, fights on television, and talk shows, two \"Chicks, Man/Ladies, Ladies, Ladies\" specials focusing on reality TV females, a show about love and marriage called \"Love and Other Burning Sensations\", and most recently, a show dedicated to television programs that have had recurring appearances on ''The Soup'' (the \"shows [they] just cannot quit\"). During the holiday seasons, two-part episodes showcasing the best clips of the year are aired (Clipdowns).\n\n==Reception==\nIn 2004, ''The Soup'' started off as a relatively quiet show, but became one of the most popular programs on E!.

The show focused more on celebrity, magazine, and [[fashion industry]] trends, along with style and fashion-related reality programs in more detail, including ''[[Project Runway]]'' and various shows on the shopping channels, [[HGTV]] and [[DIY Network]]. It was canceled on March 20, 2011, two months after the merger of NBC and Comcast was complete. It was thought{{By whom|Reason = Was this press speculation or just Internet chatter?|date=May 2015}} the cancellation was the direct result of former competitors [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]] and [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]] coming under common NBCUniversal ownership with Style; the two networks and their programming had been among the major comedic targets of ''The Dish''.\n\n===''Sports Soup''===\n{{Main|Sports Soup}}\nOn September 15, 2008, E! parent Comcast Entertainment Group announced another spin-off, this time sports-related, of the series, which aired on the group's sports network, Versus (now known as [[NBC Sports Network]] since 2012), called ''[[Sports Soup]]'' and was hosted by [[Matt Iseman]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117992162.html?categoryid=14&cs=1&nid=2565 | work=Variety | title=E! heats up 'Sports Soup' | first=Michael | last=Schneider | date=September 14, 2008}}</ref> Debuted on October 14, the program once aired twice weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

It was canceled on July 15, 2010.\n\n===''Web Soup''===\n{{Main|Web Soup}}\nA third version, airing on G4, titled ''Web Soup'', hosted by [[Chris Hardwick]] debuted June 7, 2009 at 9&nbsp;pm ET. This version is more of a blend of the commentary and reaction portions of ''The Soup'' and two other G4 programs; ''Whacked Out Videos'' and the ''Around the Net'' viral video segment which opens ''[[Attack of the Show]]''. This show ended after its 3rd season on July 20, 2011.\n\n===''Celebrity Soup''===\n{{Main|Celebrity Soup}}\n''Celebrity Soup'' was the British version of the American show hosted by comedian [[Iain Lee]]. Unlike ''The Soup'', ''Celebrity Soup'' airs 19 episodes in a season, instead of year-round like in the United States. It had some of the same features as the original (i.e. \"Chat Stew\"), but also has its own running gags and features. The series had a similar set, with a window overlooking London's [[Big Ben]] instead of Hollywood, as in the U.S. original.\n\n===''The Soup Investigates''===\n{{Main|The Soup Investigates}}\n''The Soup Investigates'' featured most of the same crew, including Joel McHale as the host. In the spin-off, the reporters go looking for potentially funny celebrity news stories.

Originally only to last for one month, the program continued as a live show.\n\nOn November 18, 2015 ''The Soup'' was canceled, the number of episodes that were to be produced was later reduced by one. A decision was made not to air the episode that had been filmed and intended to air the same day as the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]] due to multiple references to \"killing Baby [[Hitler]]\".

The show is broken up into various segments that focus on themes such as reality television shows or shows on E!. The host introduces each clip, which is then played, then comments on the clip before moving on to the next one. There is a live audience on the show, composed of a small group of E! employees, their family, and friends, along with the typical production personnel. The audience is involved in the show, laughing and cheering along with the clips. The 2020 revival includes a second camera position stage right, where the host can present other content on a second auxiliary video display.\n\nAlthough the show is scripted, a large portion of it is ad-libbed.<ref name=\"ew-interview\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20184375,00.html | title=The Q&A: ''Soup'' Guy Joel McHale Answers Your Questions | first=Mandi | last=Bierly | journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=March 14, 2008 | accessdate=March 24, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn April 22, 2008, a blog was started for ''The Soup'' on E!'s website.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.multichannel.com/article/132968-E_Unveils_Revamped_Web_Site.php | title=E!

They include Mankini (a man wearing a bikini top and pants played by Dominic DeLeo, who is also a writer and producer for the show), a dancing maxi pad ([[Tess Rafferty]], a supervising producer and the then-only female writer on ''The Soup''),<ref>{{cite news|last1=Zukey Staff|title=Interview: Tess Rafferty|url=http://zulkey.com/zulkey_test/2012/11/the-tess-rafferty-interview.html|accessdate=November 24, 2016|work=Zukey|date=November 21, 2012}}</ref> two nerds who dress as ''[[Star Wars]]'' characters, an intern named Matt whom McHale shoots with a gun (often with the shooting [[sound effect]] purposefully played out of sync, or even played with other objects or with just fingers), Jewbacca ([[Chewbacca]]'s lawyer), and \"[[Spaghetti Cat]]\", a cat eating spaghetti from ''[[The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet]]''. Additionally, Tom McNamara, The Soup's [[stage manager]] and former stage manager on ''[[Talk Soup]]'', and Kelly Levy (''n\u00e9e'' Andrews), the show's former announcer and a producer, made appearances on the show, with Kelly portraying [[Courtney Stodden]]. Executive producer Edward Boyd's [[chihuahua (dog)|chihuahua]] '''Lou''' appeared regularly in segment openings, most notably the \"Clip of the Week\", and elsewhere in the show. He also appeared with McHale at the show's intro, which showed them watching a different TV show each week until the intro was changed in early 2010.  The replacement intro juxtaposes brief clips introduced by announcer [[Anndi McAfee]] and a \"reaction\" by another clip, wildly out of context.\n\n==Regular features==\n=== 2004\u20132015 episodes ===\nThe show has a number of segments that focus on various genres of television shows. Regular segments include:\n* \"Chat Stew\", which features clips from talk shows. Joel introduces the segment with either, \"Let's have some chat stew, shall we?\" or a reference to the previous clip being used for chat stew. Previously, the intro clip indicates a crockpot showing different talk shows in bubbles inside is shown with a rock intro, then the words CHAT STEW hit the top, cracking it. The  introduction is voiced by producer Kelly Andrews (who also does the show's introduction voice-overs) saying, \"So meaty.\" Audience members sometimes reply with a groan or \"Ew.\" As of 2013, a new intro card shows a kettle sucking up all the TV sets that broadcast different talk shows, then regurgitates them back out. The rock intro and the \"So meaty.\" audios are kept.\n* \"Chicks, Man\" which focuses on female celebrity news. Joel introduces clip with, \"Let's talk about chicks, man.\" and a slightly deep male voice repeats, \"Chicks, man.\" while a picture of baby [[Bird|chicks]] appears on the screen.\n* \"Reality Show Clip Time!\", which features clips from current [[reality television|reality shows]]. Joel introduces a segment with, \"It's reality show clip time.\" (or sometimes total gibberish or other stuff), and the words REALITY SHOW CLIP TIME appear on the screen over a quick rock riff.\n* \"Let's Take Some E!\", a segment featuring clips from other programs shown on E!, jokingly described by McHale as a contractual obligation. The name of the segment (along with its intro) is a reference to the [[party drug]] [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]], which is commonly known as \"E\".\n* The show ends with the \"Clip of the Week\", a clip considered to be the best clip shown on TV in the past week.  After Joel finishes joking about the next-to-last clip, he introduces this one with \"...which brings us to our Clip of the Week.\"\n\n====Other segments====\n''The Soup'' has also featured other recurring segments:\n* \"What's Pissing Off [[Steve Edwards (talk show host)|Steve Edwards]] This Week?\" features clips from [[KTTV]]'s ''[[Good Day L.A.]]'' in which something or somebody makes Steve Edwards upset in the clip. Another episode featured a parody of the segment, \"What's Exciting Rick Dickert This Week?\"\n* \"Tales from Home Shopping\" features clips from home shopping channels such as [[QVC]] or [[Home Shopping Network|HSN]].\n* \"Oprah's Vajayjay\" features clips and or related to Oprah's discussions about the female anatomy.\n* \"What the Kids Are Watching\", whose intro started with a boy and a girl watching TV, and ended with the sound of those children crying uncontrollably, showcases unusual and weird clips from children's shows and commercials aimed at children, such as  ''[[Yo Gabba Gabba!]]''. Two spinoff segments have been produced based on the segment: \"What the Old Folks Are Watching\", which no longer airs, does the same for content geared toward older people, and \"What Your Boyfriend's Looking At\" features clips of shows targeting males with Kelly Andrews asking \"Are you even listening to me?!\" to which a man in the audience nearly always responds with, \"No!\"\n* Segments featuring clips from international programs have also been featured, such as \"Clippos Magnificos\" (which features Spanish programs), \"Souper Fantastic Ultra Wish Time!\" (which features Japanese programs), and the \"International House of Soup.\"\n* \"Cyber Smack\" featured the best viral videos from the internet. This segment eventually spun-off as ''[[Web Soup]]''.\n* \"My Stories\" shows clips from daytime soap operas, such as ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]''. A running gag on the show includes increasingly unrelated and random music being played with the segment's title card.\n* \"The Hollywood Access Extra Inside Entertainment Report\" is an amalgamation of these entertainment news shows ''[[Access Hollywood]]'', ''[[Extra (American TV program)|Extra]]'', ''[[The Insider (TV program)|The Insider]]'', ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]''. At times, Joel would introduce the segment by saying, \"Let's go Inside Extra Access--\" followed by nonsensical gibberish.\n* \"Miley Cyrus News\" documents stories involving [[Miley Cyrus]], which always begins with producer Kelly Andrews yelling \"It's Miley!\" Variations include stories involving [[Britney Spears]] in which a highly modulated voice exclaims, \"It's Britney, bitch!\" or [[Lindsay Lohan]] news in which an overly hoarse and unenthusiastic voice states, \"It's Lindsay\".\n* \"Local Newsbreak\" features embarrassing clips from local newscasts\n* \"Ad Nauseam\" pokes fun at commercials, often with McHale misusing the product after the clip is done.\n* \"The Mail Nurse\" showcases [[viral videos]] found on the Internet and opens with Joel in a nurse's outfit seductively saying \"It's time to check your RAM\" as his nurse's cap clumsily slides off his head.  McHale often comments on how much he hates this intro.\n* \"Stay Out of It [[Nick Lachey]]\" features clips from ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' with cast members saying \"Stay out of it Nick Lachey\"\n* \"Gay Shows\" features clips from [[LGBT]]-related television shows such as ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]''. The segment is introduced with a title card featuring ultra-masculine things such as monster trucks and motorcycles while a heavy rock guitar solo plays. The title card ends with a gruff male voice saying the segment's name.\n* \"Gay Shows: Alaska Edition\" features clips from Alaskan reality shows such as ''[[Gold Rush Alaska]]''. The segment has the same introduction as \"Gay Shows\" except that it has pictures of bears added to the intro.\n* \"Take A Look at Myke Hawke\" involves clips from [[Mykel Hawke]]'s shows.  Typically Joel pronounces his name \"my [[human penis|cock]]\" and make several [[phallic]]-themed jokes while introducing the clip.\n* \"Gavel Bangin'\" is a segment where reality courtroom shows are mocked, especially Nancy Grace's ''Swift Justice''. The title sequence is accompanied with ''The Soup'' voiceover's sexy voice saying, \"All rise.\"\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] News: Features news topics regarding Charlie Sheen. Introduced with a clip of Sheen saying, \"Everything's good, everything's good.\"\n* \"RRRrrr with [[Brian Williams]]\" showcases various clips from Williams' [[NBC]] show \"[[Rock Center with Brian Williams|Rock Center]]\". The segment opens with an angry cat popping up suddenly, and a person imitating the cat growling.\n* \"Unlikely Voice of Reason\" involves a clip in which a much-ridiculed character such as [[Greg Kelly]] or [[Stephanie Pratt]] says something unexpected and intelligent.\n* \"Clippos Magnificos\" which shows clips from the melodramatic [[telenovelas]] shown on Spanish language television. The clips are introduced with an image of a [[pi\u00f1ata]] while [[The Mexican Hat Dance]] plays in the background. The pi\u00f1ata explodes and a man with a strong Spanish accent says \"Are you serious?\". McHale will then mention the name of the show and say \"which I'm pretty sure means...\", then give a ridiculous, comic translation of the show's title in English.\n\n=== 2020\u2013present episodes ===\n{{As of|2020|02|18|df=US}}, the revived series has only aired two episodes, so \"Regular\" is not yet a certainty.\n\n==Recurring jokes==\n\n=== 2004\u20132015 episodes ===\nThe show has a number of recurring jokes and segments. One of the most frequent jokes is Joel McHale making fun of [[Ryan Seacrest]]. He usually comments on Seacrest's height, sexuality, clothing, busy work schedule, income, or demeanor.\n\nJoel has also spoofed other actors, most notably ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' leading man [[David Caruso]], who plays Lieutenant [[Horatio Caine]]. He usually makes fun of the character's tendency to always put on his sunglasses and say corny one-liners at the start of every episode (followed by the first 2\u20133 seconds of the opening sequence). Joel also will sometimes spoof a person after a clip.\n\nJoel also jokes about how self-centered [[Tyra Banks]] is on [[The Tyra Banks Show|her self-titled talk show]].  More jokes are Joel making fun of Spencer Pratt's \"creepy flesh colored beard\" as well as the ages of [[Larry King]] and [[Regis Philbin]] and how they are still alive.  Also, McHale often comically berates or abuses \"interns\" for the show, usually ending with a poorly timed (or sometimes completely out-of-place) audio clip of a gun firing after McHale uses a prop gun on them. McHale has often attempted to \"shoot\" Mankini, but with no effect.\n\nThe [[Spaghetti Cat]] from ''[[The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet]]'' has been used a number of times, usually with a model of the cat rolling in, looking at Joel, and then rolling back out.\n\nJoel has often made fun of [[Bruno Tonioli]]'s flamboyancy while giving comments on ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' stating that he was reading excerpts from his romance novel ''Jazz Hands and Cold Feet''.\n\n''The Soup'' makes jokes at the A&E TV Series, ''[[Steven Seagal: Lawman]]''. Whenever Joel would introduce a clip from the show, a sound clip would say \"That's Right It's Steven Seagal\", followed by Joel drinking a Steven Seagal ''[[energy drink]]'' that would humorously float into frame.\n\nDue to NFL Coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]]'s recent appearance on ''[[Survivor: Nicaragua|Survivor]]'', Joel usually mentions his \"Extenze-enhanced penis\", followed by a clip of Johnson saying, \"I do.\"\n\n====Clips====\nA number of clips have been repeatedly shown on ''The Soup''. One clip features [[Oprah Winfrey]] saying \"My [[vagina|va-jay-jay]] is painin'!\" while hanging from a harness at the Miraval resort.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/fashion/28vajayjay.html | title = What Did You Call It? | work=The New York Times | first = Stephanie | last = Rosenbloom | date = October 28, 2007 | accessdate = March 24, 2008}}</ref> Another clip involves [[Whitney Houston]] yelling \"Kiss My Ass!\" at her husband. McHale has mentioned that this clip is one of his favorites.<ref name=\"ew-interview\" /> Still another clip that is often shown is of ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s news correspondent [[Ann Curry]] starting her report by saying, \"Good morning, good morning everybody, in the news this morning, good morning\", which Olbermann mimicked on his appearance on the July 25, 2008 show. Joel often shows a clip of [[Kendra Wilkinson]] from ''[[The Girls Next Door]]'' laughing. When someone mentions marriage on the show, they will often show a clip of [[Elizabeth Taylor]] screaming \"Marriage?! Noooooo!\" Shorter clips are sometimes used as interjections. Clips of [[Danny Noriega]] (\"I guess some people weren't likin' it!\"), and more recently, [[Tatiana Del Toro]] giggling uncontrollably, have been used as part of McHale's reactions to clips. Recent favorites include [[Gary Busey]] exclaiming \"I'm going to pull your [[endocrine system]] out of your body\", [[Tila Tequila]] yelling out \"A pig's vagina!\", [[Michelle Galdenzi]] from ''[[Scream Queens (2008 TV series)|Scream Queens]]'' saying \"and by record, I mean vagina.\", ''[[Big Brother (U.S.)|Big Brother]]'' contestants [[Big Brother 5 (U.S.)#Jase|Jase Wirey]] and [[List of Big Brother 10 HouseGuests (U.S.)#Michelle|Michelle Costa]] \"talking\" to one another using animal and computer sounds, respectively; \"[[Tetrazzini|Chicken Tetrazzini]]\" clip from ''[[Maury (TV series)|Maury]]'', Spencer Pratt from ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]'' whispering \"That's the problem\", Billy Bush saying \"It's Gross\", and Kate Gosselin squealing in a chirpy/grating-sounding voice \"Come and Getcher POPcoooooorn!\". Recently, the [[Jeffrey Osborne]] song, \"[[On the Wings of Love (Jeffrey Osborne song)|On the Wings of Love]]\", has been used to mock the current season of ''[[The Bachelor (US TV series)|The Bachelor]]''. Vonda, a woman featured on the [[TruTv]] show ''Over the Limit'' has been featured saying, \"Dunka Doo Balls.\" This clip has become a new favorite. Recently, a clip from ''[[Fantasia for Real]]'' featuring Fantasia's Aunt Bunny saying, \"Gurl Please\", has become a new favorite. Also, a clip of \"Ma\" from TruTV's ''[[Ma's Roadhouse]]'' saying \"He's a douchebag,\" after Joel ask what she thinks of a less than favourable man, such as [[Mel Gibson]], has come into use. Another clip of [[Ryan Seacrest]] saying, \"Hell no, say what\", has been used as reactions to clips. Calvin Tran, a contestant on Bravo's ''[[The Fashion Show (U.S. TV series)|The Fashion Show]]'', has recently been featured in a clip saying, \"Oh, here go Hell Come.\" Frequently following ''Good Day New York'' clips, McHale will ask [[Greg Kelly]] to explain how something works, and this will follow with a clip of Kelly shrugging and saying, \"Science\".\n\n====Edited clips====\n''The Soup'' will often make blatant and obvious edits to clips of shows, often killing off characters (as in their versions of ''[[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County|Laguna Beach]]'' and ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]'') or splicing McHale and other characters into the shows. McHale will often punctuate the clip by saying \"We doctored that.\"  However, if a clip was shown that may have made the audience think that it was edited by ''The Soup'' for broadcast while watching it, McHale would state before hand \"We did not doctor this.\"\n\n====Original content====\nOriginal skits are integrated into the show as responses or jokes to clips. Fake movie trailers and advertisements are created as spoofs to segments or clips. Among the movies spoofed are ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (in reference to McHale's appearance in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]''), '' [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', '' [[Made of Honor]]'', ''[[Righteous Kill]]'', ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia]]'', '' [[Beverly Hills Chihuahua]]'', '' [[Quarantine (2008 film)|Quarantine]]'', (which McHale spoofed with QuaranTween about [[Disney Channel]] celebrities), ''[[Prom Night (2008 film)|Prom Night]]'', ''[[Fast & Furious]]'', and a [[Tyler Perry]] movie.\n\n=== 2020\u2013present episodes ===\n{{As of|2020|02|18|df=US}}, the revived series has only aired two episodes, so  \"Recurring\" is not yet a certainty.\n\n==International broadcasts==\n\n=== 2004\u20132015 episodes ===\n* In Australia, the show aired on the [[E!

Episodes of this nature have been produced on topics such as models and modeling shows, fights on television, and talk shows, two \"Chicks, Man/Ladies, Ladies, Ladies\" specials focusing on reality TV females, a show about love and marriage called \"Love and Other Burning Sensations\", and most recently, a show dedicated to television programs that have had recurring appearances on ''The Soup'' (the \"shows [they] just cannot quit\"). During the holiday seasons, two-part episodes showcasing the best clips of the year are aired (Clipdowns).\n\n==Reception==\nIn 2004, ''The Soup'' started off as a relatively quiet show, but became one of the most popular programs on E!.

A six-year reanalysis study by a team of severe convective storm meteorologists found insufficient evidence to make firm conclusions but does conclude that it is likely that the beginning and ending of the path was resultant of separate tornadoes comprising a tornado family. It also found that the tornado began {{convert|15|mi|abbr=on}} to the west and ended {{convert|1|mi|abbr=on}} farther east than previously known, bringing the total path to {{convert|235|mi|abbr=on}}. The {{convert|174|mi|abbr=on}} segment from central [[Madison County, Missouri]] to [[Pike County, Indiana]] is likely one continuous tornado and the {{convert|151|mi|abbr=on}} segment from central [[Bollinger County, Missouri]] to western Pike County, Indiana is very likely a single continuous tornado. Another [[Glossary of tornado terms#S|significant]] tornado was found about {{convert|65|mi|abbr=on}} east-northeast of the end of aforementioned segment(s) of the Tri-State Tornado Family and is likely another member of the family. Its path length of {{convert|20|mi|abbr=on}} over about 20 minutes makes the known tornado family path length total to {{convert|320|mi|abbr=on}} over about 5\u00bd hours.<ref name=\"Johns\">{{cite journal |last = Johns |first = Robert H. |authorlink = Robert H.

The name is inspired by ''[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]'' from [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', and the housemates are continuously monitored during their stay in the house by live television cameras as well as personal audio microphones. Throughout the course of the competition, they are voted out (usually on a weekly basis) until only one remains and wins the cash prize.\n\n{{As of|2019|9|21}}, there have been 448 seasons of ''Big Brother'' in over 54 franchise countries and regions. English-language editions of the program are often referred to by its initials \"BB\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/big-brother/episodes?season=15706http:/www.channel5.com/shows/big-brother/episodes?season=15706|title=Celebrity Big Brother|publisher=Channel 5}}</ref> The title of many Spanish-language editions of the program is translated as ''Gran Hermano'' (GH).\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Premise ==\n[[File:International Logo of Big Brother.png|thumb|250px|The international ''Big Brother'' logo used from 1999 to 2018.]]\nAt regular intervals, the housemates privately nominate a number of their fellow housemates whom they wish to be evicted from the house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.endemol.com/programme/big-brother|title=Big Brother|website=|publisher=[[Endemol]]|url-status=live|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref> The housemates with the most nominations are then announced, and viewers are given the opportunity to [[televoting|vote via telephone]] for the nominee they wish to be evicted or saved from eviction. The last person remaining is declared the winner.\n\nSome more recent editions have since included additional methods of voting, such as voting through social media and smartphone applications. Occasionally, non-standard votes occur, where two houseguests are evicted at once or no one is voted out. In the earlier series of ''Big Brother'', there were 10 contestants with evictions every two weeks. However, the UK version introduced a larger number of contestants with weekly evictions. Most versions of ''Big Brother'' follow the weekly eviction format, broadcast over approximately three months for 16 contestants.\n\nThe contestants are required to do housework and are assigned tasks by the producers of the show (who communicate with the housemates via the omnipresent authority figure known to them only as \"Big Brother\"). The tasks are designed to test their teamwork abilities and community spirit. In some countries, the housemates' shopping budget or weekly allowance (to buy food and other essentials) depends on the outcome of assigned tasks.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Name ===\nThe term ''Big Brother'' originates from [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]],'' with its theme of continuous oppressive surveillance.<ref name=\"Nordicom 1\" /> The program also relies on other techniques, such as a stripped back-to-basic environment, evictions, weekly tasks and competitions set by ''Big Brother'', and the \"Diary Room\" (or \"Confession Room\") where housemates convey their private thoughts to the camera and reveal their nominees for eviction.\n\n=== Creation ===\nThe first version of ''Big Brother'' was broadcast in 1999 on [[Veronica (TV channel)|Veronica]] in the [[Big Brother (Netherlands)|Netherlands]]. In the first season of ''Big Brother'', the house was very basic. Although essential amenities such as running water, furniture, and a limited ration of food were provided, luxury items were often forbidden. This added a [[survivalist]] element to the show, increasing the potential for social tension. Nearly all later series provide a modern house for the contest with a Jacuzzi, sauna, VIP suite, [[loft]], and other luxuries.\n\n=== International expansion ===\nThe format has become an international TV franchise. While each country or region has its own variation, the common theme is that the contestants are confined to the house and have their every action recorded by cameras and microphones and that no contact with the outside world is permitted.\n\nMost international versions of the show remain quite similar to each other: their main format remains true to the original [[fly on the wall]] observational style with the emphasis on human relationships, to the extent that contestants usually are forbidden from discussing nominations or voting strategy. In 2001, the [[Big Brother (American TV series)|American version]] adopted a different format during its second season, where the contestants are encouraged to strategize to advance in the game; in this format, the contestants themselves vote to evict each other. ''[[Big Brother Canada]]'', introduced in 2013, also follows the American format.  In 2011, the [[Big Brother (UK TV series)|UK version]] controversially adapted the discussion of nominations before reversing this rule after a poll by ''Big Brother'' broadcaster [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb13/features/0608/poll-big-brother-2012-housemates-discuss-nominations|title=POLL: Should housemates be able to talk nominations?|author=Scott, Matt|date=8 June 2012|website=|publisher=BBSpy|url-status=live|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nWith the cancellation of the UK edition in 2018 and the 2020 rebooted Australian series expected to follow the American format , ''[[Big Brother Naija]]'' (Nigeria)  is the only English-speaking edition in the franchise that follows the original international format.\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Overview ===\nFrom a sociological and demographic perspective, ''Big Brother'' allows an analysis of how people react<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/psychologist-behind-big-brother/news-story/e193d00b9cc9a23be9917232d1a2e20c|title=Meet the psychologist behind Big Brother|website=news.com.au|access-date=19 March 2019}}</ref> when forced into close confinement with people outside of their [[comfort zone]] (having different opinions or ideals, or from a different socioeconomic group). The viewer has the opportunity to see how a person reacts from the outside (through the constant recording of their actions) and the inside (in the Diary or Confession Room). The Diary Room is where contestants can privately express their feelings about the game, strategy and the other contestants. The results range from violent or angry confrontations to genuine and tender connections (often including romantic interludes).\n\nThe show is notable for involving the Internet. Although the show typically broadcasts daily updates during the evening (sometimes criticized by viewers and former contestants for heavy editing by producers),<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/enforcement/broadcast-bulletins/obb110/issue110.pdf | title=Complaint by Ms Dawn Blake | author=Blake, Dawn | journal=[[Ofcom]] Broadcast Bulletin | date=27 May 2008 | issue=110 | type=PDF}}</ref> viewers can also watch a continuous feed from multiple cameras on the Web in most countries. These websites were successful, even after some national series began charging for access to the video stream. In some countries, Internet broadcasting was supplemented by updates via email, [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] and SMS. The house is shown live on satellite television, although in some countries there is a 10\u201315 minutes delay to allow libelous or unacceptable content (such as references to people not participating in the program who have not consented to have personal information broadcast) to be removed.\n\nContestants occasionally develop sexual relationships; the level of sexual explicitness allowed to be shown in broadcast and Internet-feed varies according to the country's broadcasting standards.\n\n=== Isolation ===\n''Big Brother'' contestants are isolated in the house, without access to television, radio, or the Internet. They are not permitted routine communication with the outside world. This was an important issue for most earlier series of the show. In more-recent series, contestants are occasionally allowed to view televised events (usually as a reward for winning at a task). In most versions of the program, books and writing materials are also forbidden, although exceptions are sometimes made for religious materials such as the Bible, [[Tanakh]] or the [[Qur'an]]. Some versions ban all writing implements, even items that can be used to write (such as lipstick or eyeliner). Despite the housemates' isolation, some contestants are occasionally allowed to leave the house as part of tasks. Contestants are permitted to leave the house in an emergency.\n\nNews from the outside world may occasionally be given as a reward. Additionally, news of extraordinary events from the outside world may be given to the Housemates if such information is considered important, such notable past examples include that of national election results,<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9QD2hSPNT0</ref> the [[September 11 attacks]],<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6omREKjPlo</ref> and the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OxZCXgAOCk</ref>\n\nContestants have regularly-scheduled interactions with the show's host on eviction nights. Throughout each day, the program's producer, in the \"Big Brother\" voice, issues directives and commands to contestants. Some versions of the show allow private counselling sessions with a psychologist. These are allowed at any time and are often conducted by telephone from the Diary Room.\n\n== Format changes and twists ==\n\n=== Regional versions ===\n[[File:Big brother countries.PNG|430px|thumbnail|alt=World map, with different shading for \"Big Brother\" versions|Locations of ''Big Brother'' versions:\n{{legend|blue|With individual franchises}}\n{{legend|#ADFF2F|Part of ''Big Brother Africa''}}\n{{legend|#568203|Part of ''Big Brother Angola e Mo\u00e7ambique''; Also part of ''Big Brother Africa''}}\n{{legend|green|With individual franchises; Also part of ''Big Brother Africa''}}\n{{legend|#ADD8E6|Part of ''Big Brother:'' \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633}}\n{{legend|pink|Part of ''Gran Hermano del Pac\u00edfico''}}\n{{legend|red|With individual franchises; Also part of ''Gran Hermano del Pac\u00edfico''}}\n{{legend|maroon|Part of ''Veliki brat''}}\n{{legend|#FEDF00|With individual franchises; Also part of ''Big Brother'' of Scandinavia}}]]\nDue to the intelligibility of certain languages across several nations, it has been possible to make regional versions of ''Big Brother''. All of these follow the normal ''Big Brother'' rules, except that contestants must come from each of the countries in the region where it airs: ''[[Big Brother (Albanian TV series)|Big Brother Albania]]'' of [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]], ''[[Big Brother Angola & Mozambique|Big Brother Angola e Mo\u00e7ambique]]'' of [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]], ''[[Big Brother Africa]]'' of Africa (includes Angola, [[Botswana]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Liberia]], [[Malawi]], Mozambique, [[Namibia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Rwanda]], [[Sierra Leone]], South Africa, [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]), [[Big Brother: The Boss|''Big Brother:'' \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633]] of the Middle East (includes [[Bahrain]], [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Oman]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Somalia]], [[Syria]] and [[Tunisia]]), ''[[Gran Hermano (Pacific)|Gran Hermano del Pac\u00edfico]]'' of South America (includes Chile, [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]]), ''[[Big Brother (Sweden and Norway)|Big Brother]]'' of Scandinavia (includes [[Norway]] and Sweden) and ''[[Veliki brat 2011|Veliki brat]]'' of the Balkans (includes [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[North Macedonia]]). The British version of the show accepts Irish applicants and was available between 2000 and 2010 as Channel 4 was available; {{as of|2015|lc=yes}} the show returned to Irish screens as TV3 bought the rights from UK broadcaster Channel 5 to air the show.\n\nOn the other hand, some countries have multiple franchises based on language. India has the most regional-based versions Hindi, Marathi, Telugu, Bengali, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam language versions; Canada has French- and English-language versions; and the United States has English- and Spanish-language versions of the show.\n\n=== Twists involving single franchises ===\n\n==== Multiple areas and houses ====\nIn 2001, ''[[Big Brother (Dutch TV series)#Season 3|Big Brother 3]]'' of the Netherlands introduced the \"Rich and Poor\" concept, wherein the house is separated into a luxurious half and a poor half and two teams of housemates compete for a place in the luxurious half. The Dutch version continued this concept until its [[Big Brother (Netherlands)#Season 4|fourth season]]. Other versions later followed and introduced a similar concept, of which some have their own twists: [[Big Brother Africa|Africa]] (in [[Big Brother Africa (season 5)|2010]], [[Big Brother Africa (season 6)|2011]], [[Big Brother Africa (season 7)|2012]] and [[Big Brother Africa (season 8)|2013]]), [[Big Brother (Albania)|Albania]] (in [[Big Brother 3 (Albania)|2010]]), [[Big Brother (Australian TV series)|Australia]] (in [[Big Brother 3 (Australia)|2003]] and [[Big Brother 10 (Australia)|2013]]), [[Veliki Brat|Balkan States]] (in [[Veliki Brat VIP 4|VIP 2010]] and [[Veliki brat 2011|2011]]), [[Big Brother Brasil|Brazil]] (from [[Big Brother Brasil 9|2009]] to [[Big Brother Brasil 20|2020]]), [[Big Brother (Canada)|Canada]] ([[Big Brother 1 (Canada)|2013]]\u2013present), [[Big Brother (Denmark)|Denmark]] (in [[Big Brother (Denmark)#Big Brother 3|2003]]), [[Big Brother (Finland)|Finland]] (in [[Big Brother 2009 (Finland)|2009]] and [[Big Brother 2014 (Finland)|2014]]), France (in [[Secret Story 3 (France)|2009]], [[Secret Story 5 (France)|2011]]\u2013present), [[Big Brother Germany|Germany]] (in [[Big Brother Germany (Season 4)|2003]], [[Big Brother Germany (Season 5)|2004\u201305]], [[Big Brother Germany (Season 6)|2005\u201306]], [[Big Brother Germany (Season 8)|2008]] and [[Big Brother Germany (Season 9)|2008\u201309]]), [[Big Brother (Greece)|Greece]] (in [[Big Brother (Greece)#Season 3|2003]]), [[Bigg Boss|India]] (in [[Bigg Boss 6|2012]] and [[Bigg Boss 7|2013]]), [[HaAh HaGadol|Israel]] (in [[HaAh HaGadol 2|2009]]), [[Grande Fratello|Italy]] (in [[Grande Fratello Season 6|2006]] and [[Grande Fratello Season 7|2007]]), [[Big Brother Norway|Norway]] (in [[Big Brother Norway#Big Brother 3 - Next Generation|2003]]), [[Pinoy Big Brother|Philippines]] (in [[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|2009]], [[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition 3|Teen 2010]] and [[Pinoy Big Brother: Unlimited|2011]]), [[Big Brother (Poland)|Poland]] (in [[Big Brother (Poland)#Season 3|2002]]), [[Big Brother (Portugal)|Portugal]] (in [[Big Brother VIP (Portugal)|VIP 2013]] and [[Secret Story 6 (Portugal)|2016]]), [[Big Brother (Slovakia)|Slovakia]] (in [[Big Brother (Slovakia)|2005]]), [[Big Brother (Slovenia)|Slovenia]] (in [[Big Brother Slovenia Season 2|2008]], [[Big Brother 3 (Slovenia)|2015]] and [[Big Brother 4 (Slovenia)|2016]]), [[Big Brother (Sweden and Norway)|Scandinavia]] (in [[Big Brother (Sweden and Norway)#Season one|2005]]), [[Big Brother (South Africa)|South Africa]] (in [[Big Brother Mzansi 3 (South Africa)|2014]]), [[Gran Hermano (Spain)|Spain]] (in [[Gran Hermano Spain (VIP Season 1)|VIP 2004]], [[Gran Hermano Spain (Season 10)|2008]], [[Gran Hermano Spain (Season 11)|2009\u201310]] and [[Gran Hermano Spain (Season 12)|2010]]), [[Big Brother (UK)|United Kingdom]] (in [[Big Brother (UK series 3)|2002]], [[Celebrity Big Brother (UK series 5)|Celebrity 2007]], [[Big Brother (UK series 9)|2008]], [[Celebrity Big Brother (UK series 11)|Celebrity 2013]] and [[Big Brother (UK series 17)|2016]]) and [[Big Brother (U.S.)|United States]] ([[Big Brother 11 (U.S.)|2009]]\u2013present).\n\nIn 2011\u201312, the [[Gran Hermano Argentina (season 7)|seventh Argentine series]] added ''La Casa de al Lado'' (\"The House Next Door\"), a smaller, more luxurious house which served multiple functions. The first week it hosted 4 potential housemates, and the public voted for two of them to enter the main house. The second week, two pairs of twins competed in the same fashion, with only one pair allowed in. Later, the 3rd, 4th and 5th evicted contestants were given the choice of staying on their way out and they competed for the public's vote to reenter the house. Months later, after one of the contestants left the house voluntarily, the House Next Door reopened for four contestants who wanted to reenter and had not been in such a playoff before. The House Next Door was also used in other occasions to accommodate contestants from the main house for limited periods of time, especially to have more privacy (which of course could be seen by the public).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}<!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP-->\n\nThe [[Big Brother Brasil 9|ninth Brazilian season]] featured the \"Bubble\": a glass house in a shopping mall in Rio de Janeiro where four potential housemates lived for a week. Later in the season, a bubble was built inside the Big Brother house, with another two housemates living in it for a week until they were voted in and the glass house dismantled. The Glass House was reused in the [[Big Brother Brasil 11|eleventh season]], featuring five evicted housemates competing for a chance to join the house again, and in the [[Big Brother Brasil 13|thirteenth season]], with six potential housemates competing for two places in the main house. A dividing wall from the ninth season was reused in the [[Big Brother Brasil 14|fourteenth Brazilian season]], when mothers and aunts of the housemates entered for [[International Women's Day]] and stayed in the house for 6 days, though they could not be seen by the housemates. Every season brings back the glass house. Some editions also featured an all white panic room, where contestants where held until one of them decided to quit the show.\n\nIn the [[Big Brother Canada (season 4)|fourth English-Canadian season]], two house guests were evicted and moved into a special suite where they were able to watch the remaining house guests. A week later, the houseguests were required to unanimously decide which of them to bring back into the house.\n\n==== Evil Big Brother ====\nIn 2004, the [[Big Brother (British series 5)|fifth UK series]] introduced a villainous Big Brother with harsher punishments, such as taking away prize money, more difficult tasks and secret tricks. This concept has also been used in Australia, [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Finland]], Germany, [[Greece]], Italy, the [[Netherlands]], South America,{{clarify|date=November 2017}} [[Scandinavia]],{{clarify|date=November 2017}} [[Serbia]], Spain, [[Thailand]], [[Philippines]] and Mexico.\n\n==== Twin or triplet housemates ====\nIn 2004, the [[Big Brother 5 (American season)|fifth US season]] introduced twins who were tasked with secretly switching back and forth in the house; they were allowed to play the game as individual house guests after succeeding at the deception for five weeks. This twist was reused in the [[Big Brother 17 (U.S.)|seventeenth US season]] with an easier task of successfully changing places for five weeks without being ''evicted''.\n\nThis twin or triplet twist was used in several countries. Some made modifications to this twist; others have had twins in the house together without this element of secrecy. The following are the countries that have featured twins or triplets: Australia (in [[Big Brother (Australian season 5)|2005]]), Germany (in [[Big Brother Germany (season 6)|2005\u201306]]), Bulgaria (in [[Big Brother 3 (Bulgaria)|2006]], [[Big Brother All Stars 2012 (Bulgaria)|2012]] and [[VIP Brother 9|VIP 2017]]), United Kingdom (in [[Big Brother (UK series 8)|2007]], [[Celebrity Big Brother (UK series 8)|Celebrity 2011]], [[Celebrity Big Brother (UK series 9)|Celebrity 2012]], [[Big Brother (UK series 14)|2013]], [[Big Brother (UK series 16)|2015]], [[Big Brother (UK series 17)|2016]] and [[Celebrity Big Brother (UK series 19)|Celebrity 2017]]), France (in [[Secret Story 2007 (France)|2007]], [[Secret Story 2011 (France)|2011]], [[Secret Story 7 (France)|2013]], [[Secret Story 9 (France)|2015]] and [[Secret Story 10 (France)|2016]]), Spain (in [[Gran Hermano Spain (season 9)|2007]] and [[Gran Hermano 14 (Spain)|2013]]), Poland (in [[Big Brother (Poland)#Season 4|2007]] and [[Big Brother (Polish season 7)|2019]]), India (in [[Bigg Boss (Season 2)#Sana Wadiwala|2008]]), Africa (in [[Big Brother Africa (season 4)|2009]]), Balkan Region (in [[Veliki brat 2009|2009]] and [[Veliki Brat VIP 5|2013]]), Philippines (in [[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|2009]], [[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition 4|Teen 2012]] and [[Pinoy Big Brother: All In|2014]]), Portugal (in [[Secret Story 2010 (Portugal)|2010]] and [[Secret Story 3 (Portugal)|2012]]), Israel (in [[HaAh HaGadol 3|2011]]), Ukraine (in [[Big Brother (Ukraine)|2011]]), Argentina (in [[Gran Hermano Argentina (season 7)|2011]] and [[Gran Hermano Argentina (season 9)|2016]]) and Albania (in [[Big Brother 6 (Albania)|2013]] and [[Big Brother 9 (Albania)|2017]]).\n\n==== Pairs competitions ====\nSeveral versions of the program feature variations of the housemates competing in pairs:\n\n* In [[Big Brother 6 (American season)|sixth American season]], each HouseGuest had a secret partner with whom had a pre-existing relationship. While each player was nominated and evicted as an individual, each pair had the goal of reaching being the Final 2 HouseGuests remaining. Should a secret pair succeed in this goal, the prize money awarded to the winner and runner-up would jackpot \u2013 the winner's prize doubling from $500,000 to $1,000,000 and the runner-up's prize quintupling from $50,000 to $250,000. \n* During the tenth week of the [[Big Brother (British series 7)|seventh UK series]], the housemates were paired with their \"best friend\" in the house and had to nominate and face eviction as couples. \n** The [[Big Brother 9 (American season)|ninth American season]] added a romantic theme by pairing up the HouseGuests with their \"Soulmate\" and having them compete as couples. This twist was active for the first 3 weeks of the season. \n** The [[Big Brother 13 (American season)|13th American season]] featured a further twist to the pairs format by introducing the \"Dynamic Duos\" twist, where contestants formed pairs that would be nominated together but evicted separately. The nominee not evicted would be immune from further nomination until there were 10 HouseGuests remaining, at which point the pairs were dissolved.\n*  The second season of the [[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition Plus|Philippine teen edition]] also featured the parents or guardians of the teens staying in the house; if a teen housemate was evicted, the coinciding parent or guardian would also be evicted.  A similar twist was used on the [[Big Brother (Greece)#Season 4 (2005)|fourth Greek season]] was dubbed \"Big Mother\", and featured housemates accompanied by their mothers.\n* In the ninth season of Indian ''Big Brother'', \"Big Boss: Double Trouble\", contestants entered the house tied up in pairs by the waist. They had joint chairs, beds, spoons, and even mugs. The twelfth season of Indian Big Brother \"Bigg Boss 12\" also featured pairs 'jodis' who were Teacher-Student, Policeman-Lawyer, sister-sister, etc.\n* In the [[Big Brother 9 (Albania)|ninth Albania season]] all the housemates wherever were in couples and for the first time in the history of ''Big Brother'', the winner was a couple (Danjel Dedndreaj and Fotini Derxho).\n\n==== Secret missions ====\nSecret missions are a common element of the show since their introduction during the [[Big Brother (UK series 6)|sixth UK series]]. During these missions, one or more housemates are set a task from Big Brother with the reward of luxuries for the household and/or a personal reward if the task is successful. Some versions of Big Brother have secret tasks presented by another character who lives in plain sight of the housemate. Such characters include Marsha the Moose (from BB Canada) and Surly the Fish (from BB Australia).\n\nThe [[Big Brother 8 (U.S.)|eighth US season]] introduced \"America's Player\", where a selected house guest must complete various tasks (determined by public vote) in secret for the duration of their stay in the house in exchange for a cash reward. It was repeated in the [[Big Brother 10 (U.S.)|tenth US season]] for a week. The [[Big Brother 11 (U.S.)|eleventh US season]] featured Pandora's Box, in which the winning head of household was tempted to open a box, with [[unintended consequences]] for the house. The [[Big Brother 12 (U.S.)|twelfth US season]] featured a saboteur, who entered the house to wreak havoc with tasks suggested by viewers. The [[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)|sixteenth US season]] featured \"Team America\", in which 3 houseguests were selected to work as a team to complete tasks (determined by public voting) for a cash reward; this continued for the entire season despite the eviction of a team member.\n\nThe [[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 4|fourth Argentine series]] added a telephone in the living room. This telephone rang once a week for ten seconds, and the person to pick up the receiver was given an order or news from Big Brother (which typically no other housemate could hear). The order could be beneficial or detrimental, but a refused order resulted in nomination for eviction. If nobody picked up the call, the whole house would be nominated for eviction.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}<!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP-->\n\n==== Opening night twists ====\nSince ''[[Big Brother (British series 2)|Big Brother 2]]'', the [[Big Brother (British TV series)|UK series]] has opened with a twist. This has included having three finalists (''Big Brother 2''); public voting for least-favourite housemates, with the housemates choosing between two nominees to evict (''Big Brother 3''); first-night nominations (''[[Big Brother (British series 4)|Big Brother 4]]''); suitcase nominations (''Big Brother 5''); Unlucky Housemate 13 (''Big Brother 6''); Big Brother Hood (''[[Big Brother (British series 7)|Big Brother 7]]''); an all-female house and a set of twins as contestants (''[[Big Brother (British series 8)|Big Brother 8]]''); a couple entering as housemates, who must hide their relationship (''[[Big Brother (British series 9)|Big Brother 9]]''); housemates having to earn housemate status (''[[Big Brother (British series 10)|Big Brother 10]]''); a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] entering the house with an impossible task (''[[Big Brother (British series 11)|Big Brother 11]]''); [[Pamela Anderson]] entering as a guest for 5 days ([[Big Brother (British series 12)|Big Brother 12]]); first-night nominations and a public vote for a wildcard to become a housemate ([[Big Brother (British series 13)|Big Brother 13]]); a professional actor posing as a housemate and a mother and daughter as contestants ([[Big Brother (British series 14)|Big Brother 14]]); one contestant gets a pass to the final ([[Big Brother (British series 15)|Big Brother 15]]); first night eviction ([[Big Brother (British series 16)|Big Brother 16]]); two houses with \"the other house\" featuring enemies from the main house housemates past ([[Big Brother (British series 17)|Big Brother 17]]); [[Jackie Stallone]] entering a house containing her son's ex-wife [[Brigitte Nielsen]] (''[[Celebrity Big Brother (British series 3)|Celebrity Big Brother 3]]''); a non-celebrity in a celebrity edition (''[[Celebrity Big Brother (British series 4)|Celebrity Big Brother 4]]''); a visit from [[Jade Goody]]'s family (''[[Celebrity Big Brother (British series 5)|Celebrity Big Brother 5]]'') and unlocked bedrooms allowing housemates to immediately claim beds<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2009/01/05/celebrity-big-brother-exclusive-la-toya-jackson-s-diva-demands-115875-21016252/ | title=Celebrity Big Brother exclusive: La Toya Jackson's diva demands \u2013 3am & Mirror Online | newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] | date=25 January 2009 | accessdate=15 July 2013 | author=Bryant, Tom}}</ref> with the last housemate becoming the Head of House (''[[Celebrity Big Brother (British series 6)|Celebrity Big Brother 6]]'').\n\nA common opening twist is to only introduce a cast of a single-sex on the premiere of the show while having members of the opposite sex introduced over the next few days. The [[Big Brother (UK series 8)|eighth UK series]] first used this twist with an initial all-female house, adding a male housemate two days later. The same twist was used in the ([[Big Brother 4 (Bulgaria)|fourth Bulgarian series]]), and an all-male premiere was used on ''[[Big Brother Africa (season 4)|Big Brother Africa 4]]''.\n\n==== Fake evictions ====\nThe fifth UK series introduced fake evictions, where Big Brother misleads housemates that eviction has taken place, only for the \"evicted\" housemate to reenter the house sometime later.\n\nIn the eighth UK series, one housemate was evicted, interviewed and sent back into the house.\n\nIn the [[Pinoy Big Brother: All In|fifth Philippine edition]], four housemates were fake-evicted and stayed in a place called ''bodega''.\n\nIn the [[Big Brother (Australian season 10)|tenth Australian season]], Benjamin Zabel was fake-evicted for 24 hours before being returned to the house with immunity from eviction for that week. In the [[Big Brother 11 (Australia)|eleventh Australian season]] Travis Lunardi was fake-evicted and received advice from Benjamin Zabel for 24 hours; Travis returned to the house after a 3-day absence with immunity from eviction for that week.\n\nIn the [[Big Brother Brasil 13|thirteenth Brazilian series]], Anamara Barreira was fake-evicted. She was removed and put into a small private apartment without the other housemates knowing she was still in the house. After 24 hours, she returned to the house as Head of Household and with immunity from eviction that week. In the [[Big Brother Brasil 16|sixteenth Brazilian series]], Ana Paula Renault was similarly fake-evicted, put into a small private apartment, and returned after 48 hours with immunity from eviction that week. In the [[Big Brother Brasil 18|eighteen Brazilian series]], [[Gleici Damasceno]] was similarly fake-evicted, put into a small private apartment, and returned after 72 hours with immunity from eviction and with the power to put someone to eviction.\n\nIn the [[Big Brother T\u00fcrkiye|first Turkish series]], there is a fake eviction in week 10.\n\nThe Indian version ''[[Bigg Boss (franchise)|Bigg Boss]]'' sees frequent fake evictions. In Kannada Bigg Boss season 4, winner Pratham and co-contestant Malavika were kept in secret room after fake eviction for one week and they were both allowed in the Bigg Boss house.\n\nSimilarly in Kannada Bigg Boss season 5, firstly Jaya Srinivasan and Sameer Acharya were put into the secret room after fake eviction for one week and then Sameer Acharya was allowed into the house but Jaya Srinivasan was evicted from the secret room itself. In the same season, the runner up Divakar was put into the secret room after fake eviction for one week.\n\n==== Coaches ====\n[[Big Brother 14 (American season)|The fourteenth US season]] had four house guests from past seasons return to coach twelve new house guests, playing for a separate prize of $100,000. However, in a reset twist, they opted to join the normal game alongside the other house guests.\n\n==== Red button ====\nThe seventh Argentine series incorporated a red button into the Confession Room, which would sound an alarm throughout the house. This button was to be used when a contestant wanted to leave the house voluntarily, and the contestant would be given five minutes to leave the house.<ref name=\"Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre\">{{Citation|title=Anexo:S\u00e9ptima temporada de Gran Hermano (Argentina)|date=2018-06-15|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anexo:S%C3%A9ptima_temporada_de_Gran_Hermano_(Argentina)&oldid=108714582|work=Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre|language=es|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref> A red button is also used in ''[[Secret Story (France)|Secret Story]]'' series, however in this case whoever presses the button will try to guess someone's secret.\n\n==== Legacy rewards or penalties ====\nIn ''[[Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack|Celebrity Hijack UK]]'', evicted housemates were given the opportunity to choose if a \"ninja\" delivered good or bad gifts to the house. Later that year, the [[Big Brother 8 (Australia)|eighth Australian series]] introduced the Housemate Hand Grenade, where an evicted housemate decided which remaining housemate received a penalty. A similar punishment used on ''[[Big Brother Africa]]'' was called the Molotov Cocktail, Dagger or Fuse.\n\n==== Most valuable player ====\nThe [[Big Brother 15 (American season)|fifteenth US season]] allowed viewers to vote for a house guest to be made M.V.P., who then secretly nominates a third houseguest for eviction (in addition to the two selected by the Head of Household).\n\nIn a further twist introduced part-way through the MVP twist, the viewers themselves decided who the third nominee would be, with the HouseGuests still thinking one of their own is the MVP. Like many such twists, this was ended halfway into the season as the pool of contestants shrank.\n\n==== Multiple heads of household ====\nThe [[Big Brother 16 (American season)|sixteenth]] and [[Big Brother 17 (American season)|seventeenth]] US seasons featured two Heads of Household every week and had four houseguests nominated for eviction. There was also a \"Battle of the Block\" competition where the two sets of nominees competed to save themselves; the winning pair not only saved themselves but dethroned the Head of Household who nominated them, who was then vulnerable as a replacement nominee if a veto was used. It is also used in specific weeks in Brazil since [[Big Brother Brasil 16]] where the HOH's have to choose which HoH will get 10 thousand [[Brazilian real|reals]] and who is the one that will win immunity.\n\n==== Multiple winners ====\nIn 2011, ''[[Big Brother Africa (season 6)]]'' was the first season of Big Brother to have two winners, each getting US$200,000. In 2015, the [[Pinoy Big Brother: 737|sixth Philippine season]], also had two winners; one from the teens and one from the regular adults. Each of which received PHP1,000,000.\n\n''[[Bigg Boss 8]]'' (India) ended with a twist, where the top five contestants were crowned 'champions'. The season was extended by 35 days (total 135) as a spin-off called ''Bigg Boss: Halla Bol'', where ex-contestants from previous seasons entered the house to compete with the five champions.\n\n==== Reserve housemates ====\nThe [[Pinoy Big Brother: Unlimited|fourth Philippine season]] introduced the concept of having reserved housemates, those of whom are short-listed auditioners who were given a chance to be a housemate by completing tasks assigned by Big Brother. It was eventually done also in the [[Pinoy Big Brother: Otso|eighth Philippine season]] where the reserved housemates were placed in a camp (a separate House but is just adjacent to the Main House) and a that reserved housemate must compete amongst other reserved housemates while gaining points by participating in various tasks, including those that required the participation of doing such tasks outside of the Big Brother House premises. As the eviction was done weekly, once an official housemate is evicted from the Main House, the housemate(s) with the most points earned for that particular week crossovers to the Main House and becomes an official housemate.\n\nThis reserved housemates twist was also used in Argentina's [[Gran Hermano Argentina (season 7)|seventh season]] and Brazil's [[Big Brother Brasil 9|ninth season]].\n\n=== Twists involving multiple franchises ===\n\n==== Housemate exchanges ====\nIn 2002, the [[Big Brother M\u00e9xico|Mexican]] and Spanish editions ([[Big Brother M\u00e9xico#Big Brother 1|BBM1]] and [[Gran Hermano Spain (season 3)|GH3]]) made temporary housemate exchanges. Mexico's Eduardo Orozco swapped with Spain's Andr\u00e9s Barreiro for 7 days. In 2010, the first 2-housemate exchange was held by Spain and [[Grande Fratello|Italy]] ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 11)|GH11]] and [[Grande Fratello (season 10)|GF10]]). Gerardo Prager and Saray Pereira from Spain were swapped with Carmela Gualtieri and Massimo Scattarella of Italy for 7 days.\n\nIn later years, several housemate exchanges were done around the world: [[Argentina]] ([[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 3|GH3]]) and Spain ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 4)|GH4]]), [[Ecuador]] ([[Gran Hermano (Ecuadorian TV series)|GH1]]) and Mexico ([[Big Brother M\u00e9xico#Big Brother 2|BBM2]]), and Africa ([[Big Brother Africa (season 1)|BBA1]]) and United Kingdom ([[Big Brother (UK series 4)|BB4]]) in 2003; [[Scandinavia]] ([[Big Brother (Sweden and Norway)#Season two|BB2]]) and [[Thailand]] ([[Big Brother Thailand (season 2)|BBT2]]) in 2006; [[Philippines]] ([[Pinoy Big Brother (season 2)|PBB2]]) and [[Slovenia]] ([[Big Brother 1 (Slovenia)|BB1]]), and [[Argentina]] ([[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 5|GH5]]) and Spain ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 9)|GH9]]) in 2007; Africa ([[Big Brother Africa (season 3)|BBA3]]) and [[Finland]] ([[Big Brother 2008 (Finland)|BB4]]) in 2008; [[Finland]] ([[Big Brother 2009 (Finland)|BB5]]) and [[Philippines]] ([[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|PBB3]]) in 2009; [[Finland]] ([[Big Brother 2010 (Finland)|BB6]]) and [[Slovenia]] ([[Big Brother Slavnih|BBS1]]) in 2010; Spain ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 12)|GH12]]) and Israel ([[HaAh HaGadol 3|HH3]]) in 2010\u201311; [[Finland]] ([[Big Brother 2011 (Finland)|BB7]]) and [[Norway]] ([[Big Brother Norway#Big Brother 4|BB4]]) in 2011; [[Argentina]] ([[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 7|GH7]]) and Israel ([[HaAh HaGadol 4|HH4]]) in 2012; and Mexico ([[Big Brother M\u00e9xico 2015 (Season 4)|BB4]]) and Spain ([[Gran Hermano 16 (Spain)|GH16]]) in 2015; Spain ([[Gran Hermano Spain (VIP Season 5)|GHVIP5]]) and Brazil ([[Big Brother Brasil 17|BBB17]]) in 2017.\n\n==== Evicted housemate exchanges ====\nIn 2003, Mexico's Isabel Madow ([[Big Brother M\u00e9xico#Big Brother VIP 2|BB VIP2]]) and Spain's A\u00edda N\u00edzar ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 5)|GH5]]) were swapped for 7 days. This twist was also done between Russia ([[Big Brother (Russia)|BBR1]]) and Pacific (GHP1) in 2005, and Argentina ([[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 4|GH4]]) and Brazil ([[Big Brother Brasil 7|BBB7]]) in 2007.\n\n==== Other exchanges ====\nIn 2009, as part of the casting process for Italy's [[Grande Fratello Season 9|GF9]], Doroti Polito and Leonia Coccia visited Spain's [[Gran Hermano Spain (season 10)|GH10]].\n\nIn 2012, four contestants from Denmark's [[Big Brother 4 (Denmark)|BB4]] visited Sweden's [[Big Brother 2012 (Sweden)|BB6]] and competed in a Viking-themed challenge. The Danish team won and 'kidnapped' Swedish contestant Annica Englund to the Denmark house for the following week.\n\nIn 2012, evicted housemate Laisa Portella of Brazil (from [[Big Brother Brasil 12|BBB12]]) was a guest on Spain's ''[[Gran Hermano 13 (Spain)|Gran Hermano 13]]'' for a week; the following week, non-evicted Noem\u00ed Merino of GH13 stayed in the Brazilian Big Brother house for 5 days.\n\nIn 2016, ''[[Big Brother UK]]'' housemate [[Nikki Grahame]] and ''[[Big Brother (Australian TV series)|Big Brother Australia]]'' housemate Tim Dormer were voted in by Canada to be houseguests on the 4th season of ''[[Big Brother Canada]]''. Similarly, ''[[Big Brother UK]]'' housemate [[Jade Goody]] appeared as a housemate on [[Bigg Boss]] India.\n\n''Big Brother Australia'' (2015) contestant Priya Malik joined ''Bigg Boss 9'' (India) the same year as a wild card.\n\nIn 2017, [[Gran Hermano VIP (season 5)|GHVIP5]] contestant Elettra Lamborghini visited Brazil's [[Big Brother Brasil 17|BBB17]].\n\nIn 2019, the winner of Italy's [[Grande Fratello (season 15)|GF15]], Alberto Mezzetti visited Brazil's [[Big Brother Brasil 19|BBB19]].\n\n==== Evicted housemate visits ====\nAnouska Golebiewski, an evicted housemate from the United Kingdom (housemate from [[Big Brother (British series 4)|BB4]]) visited Australia ([[Big Brother (Australian season 3)|BB3]]) in 2003. In 2005, United Kingdom (Nadia Almada of [[Big Brother (British series 5)|BB5]]) visited Australia ([[Big Brother (Australian season 5)|BB5]]) again. In 2006, United Kingdom ([[Chantelle Houghton]] of [[Celebrity Big Brother (British series 4)|CBB4]]) visited Germany ([[Big Brother Germany (season 6)|BBG6]]). This twist was used in later years by other countries: Africa (Ricardo Ferreira of [[Big Brother Africa (season 3)|BBA3]]) visited Brazil ([[Big Brother Brasil 9|BBB9]]) in 2009; Germany (Annina Ucatis and Sascha Schwan of [[Big Brother Germany (season 9)|BBG9]]) visited the Philippines ([[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|PBB3]]), and Italy (George Leonard and Veronica Ciardi of [[Grande Fratello Season 10|GF10]]) visited Albania ([[Big Brother 3 (Albania)|BB3]]) in 2010; Sweden (Martin Granetoft and Peter OrrmyrSara Jonsson of [[Big Brother 2011 (Sweden)|BB5]]) visited Norway ([[Big Brother Norway#Big Brother 4|BB4]]) in 2011; Brazil (Rafael Cordeiro of [[Big Brother Brasil 12|BBB12]]) visited Spain ([[Gran Hermano 12 (Spain)|GH12]]), and Argentina (Agust\u00edn Belforte of [[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 4|GH4]]) visited Colombia ([[Gran Hermano 2 (Colombia)|GH2]]) in 2012; United States (Dan Gheesling of [[Big Brother 10 (U.S.)|BB10]]/[[Big Brother 14 (U.S.)|BB14]]) visited Canada ([[Big Brother 1 (Canada)|BB1]] and the [[Big Brother 2 (Canada)|BB2]] Jury) in 2013; Canada (Emmett Blois of [[Big Brother 1 (Canada)|BB1]]) visited South Africa ([[Big Brother Mzansi 3 (South Africa)|BBM3]]) in 2014; and Spain (Paula Gonzalez of [[Gran Hermano 15 (Spain)|GH 15]]) visited Mexico ([[Big Brother M\u00e9xico 2015 (Season 4)|BBM4]]) in 2015.\n\nA similar event took place between the United States and Canada in 2014 wherein [[Rachel Reilly]] (from [[Big Brother 12 (U.S.)|BB12]]/[[Big Brother 13 (U.S.)|BB13]]) made a video chat to Canada ([[Big Brother 2 (Canada)|BB2]]). Rachel Reilly also appeared on ''Big Brother Canada''{{'}}s side show, which airs after the eviction episode.\n\n==== Housemates competing in another country ====\nThere were occasions that a former housemate from one franchise participated and competed in a different franchise: Daniela Martins of France (SS3) competed in Portugal (SS1); Daniel Mkongo of France (SS5) competed in Italy (GF12); [[Brigitte Nielsen]] of Denmark (BB VIP) competed in the United Kingdom (CBB3); [[Jade Goody]] of the United Kingdom (BB3, BB Panto, and CBB5) competed in India ([[Bigg Boss 2|BB2]]); Sava Radovi\u0107 of Germany (BB4) competed in the [[Balkan States]] (VB1); Nikola Nasteski of the Balkan States (VB4) competed in Bulgaria (BB All-Stars 1); \u017darko Stojanovi\u0107 of France ([[Secret Story 5 (France)|SS5]]) competed in the Balkan States ([[Veliki Brat VIP 5|VB VIP5]]); \u017deljko Stojanovi\u0107 of France ([[Secret Story 5 (France)|SS5]]) competed in the Balkan States ([[Veliki Brat VIP 5|VB VIP5]]); Kelly Baron of Brazil ([[Big Brother Brasil 13|BBB13]]) competed in Portugal ([[Big Brother VIP (Portugal)|BB VIP]]); [[Lucy Diakovska]] of Bulgaria ([[VIP Brother 4|VIP B4]]) competed in Germany ([[Promi Big Brother (season 1)|PBB1]]); Leila Ben Khalifa of Italy ([[Grande Fratello (season 6)|GF6]]) competed in France ([[Secret Story 8 (France)|SS8]]); Priya Malik of Australia ([[Big Brother 11 (Australia)|BB11]]) competed in India ([[Bigg Boss 9|BB9]]); Tim Dormer of Australia ([[Big Brother 10 (Australia)|BB10]]) and [[Nikki Grahame]] of the United Kingdom ([[Big Brother (UK series 7)|BB7]], [[Ultimate Big Brother|UBB]]) competed in Canada ([[Big Brother Canada (season 4)|BB4]]); Leonel Estevao-Luto of Africa ([[Big Brother Africa (season 4)|BB4]]) competed in Angola & Mozambique ([[Big Brother Angola & Mozambique|BB3]]); [[Frankie Grande]] of the United States ([[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)|BB16]]) competed in the United Kingdom ([[Celebrity Big Brother (UK series 18)|CBB18]]); Fanny Rodrigues of Portugal ([[Secret Story 2 (Portugal)|SS2]]) competed in France ([[Secret Story 10 (France)|SS10]]); and Tucha Anita of Angola ([[Big Brother Angola & Mozambique|BB3]]); Amor Romeira of Spain ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 9)|GH9]]) competed in Portugal ([[Secret Story 6 (Portugal)|SS6]]) and Alain Rochette of Spain ([[Gran Hermano 17 (Spain)|GH17]]) competed in France ([[Secret Story 11 (France)|SS11]]); Despite being American, [[Brandi Glanville]] competed first in the United Kingdom ([[Celebrity Big Brother (UK series 20)|CBB20]]) then later competed in first Celebrity series in the United States ([[Celebrity Big Brother 1 (U.S.)|CBB1]]); A\u00edda Nizar of Spain ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 5)|GH5]] and [[Gran Hermano VIP 5|GHVIP5]]) competed in Italy ([[Grande Fratello (season 15)|GF15]]); Ivana Icardi of Argentina ([[Gran Hermano (Argentinian season 9)|GH9]]) competed in Italy ([[Grande Fratello (season 16)|GF16]]); Giamarco Onestini of Italy ([[Grande Fratello (season 16)|GF16]]) competed in Spain ([[Gran Hermano VIP (season 7)|GHVIP7]]).\n\n=== Multiple-franchise competitions ===\n\n==== Eurovision Song Contest ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:100%; line-height:16px;\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Team and Song\n! colspan=\"4\" | Jury's points\n! colspan=\"5\" | Dates\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Winner\n|-\n!

In some countries, the prize money normally awarded to the winning housemate is donated to a charity, and all celebrities are paid to appear in the show as long as they do not voluntarily leave before their eviction or the end of the series. The rest of the rules are nearly the same as those of the original version.\n\n==== Variations ====\nThe 2006 Netherlands series was entitled ''Hotel Big Brother''. This variation introduced a group of celebrity hoteliers and a Big Boss, who run a hotel and collect money for charity without nominations, evictions or a winner.\n\nAnother variation appeared in the UK in early 2008, entitled ''[[Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack]]''. Instead of being housemates the celebrities became Big Brother himself, creating tasks and holding nominations with the help of Big Brother. The housemates were considered by the producers \"Britain's most exceptional and extraordinary\" 18- to 21-year-olds. The prize for the winner of the series was \u00a350,000.<ref name=\"celebhijack\">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/bb8/news/newsstory.jsp?id=24561|title=BB Celebrity Hijack |website=|publisher=[[Channel 4]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621073443/http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/bb8/news/newsstory.jsp?id=24561|archivedate=21 June 2007|access-date=24 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, ''[[VIP Brother 3]] Bulgaria'' introduced the concept of celebrities competing for charitable causes, which changed each week. Housemates were sometimes allowed to leave the house to raise money for the charity. Ten out of Thirteen seasons of ''[[Bigg Boss]]'' (the Indian version of ''Big Brother'') have been celebrity-only seasons. The 10th season of ''Big Boss'' had celebrities put up against commoners, where a commoner ultimately won.\n\n=== American format===\n{{Details|topic=these Big Brother versions|Big Brother (American TV series)|Big Brother Canada}} \nThe US and Canadian versions of ''Big Brother'' differ from most global versions of the series. The US series began in 2000 with the original Dutch format\u2014i.e., housemates, or HouseGuests, as they are styled in the US, nominating each other for eviction and the public voting on evictions and the eventual winner. But due to both poor ratings and the concurrent popularity of ''[[Survivor (American TV series)|Survivor]]'', a gameplay-oriented format was introduced in the [[Survivor (American TV series)|second season]], with HouseGuests allowed to strategize, politic and form alliances to survive eviction, with evictions being determined by a house vote.\n\nEach week the HouseGuests compete in several competitions in order to win power and safety inside the house, before voting off one of the HouseGuests on during the eviction. The main elements of the format are as follows:\n*'''Head of Household (HoH):''' At the start of each week in the house, the HouseGuests compete for the title of Head of Household, often shortened to simply HoH.<ref name=\"format-ep1\">{{cite episode |title=Episode One |series=Big Brother 12 |serieslink=Big Brother (U.S.) |network=CBS |airdate=July 8, 2010 |minutes=00:25 |season=12 |number=1}}</ref> The Head of Household for each week is given luxuries such as their own personal bedroom and the use of an [[MP3 player]], but is responsible for nominating two of their fellow HouseGuests for eviction. The Head of Household would not be able to compete in the following week's Head of Household competition; this excludes the final Head of Household competition of the season.<ref name=\"Pickard\">{{cite news |last=Pickard |first=Ann |title=Why is Big Brother so big in the US? |work=Guardian.co.uk |date=August 19, 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2009/aug/19/why-big-brother-big-us |accessdate=May 25, 2010 |location=London}}</ref><ref name=\"format-ep2\">{{cite episode |title=Episode Two |series=Big Brother 11 |serieslink=Big Brother (U.S.) |network=CBS |airdate=July 12, 2009 |minutes=35:57 |season=11 |number=1}}</ref><ref name=\"format-ep3\">{{cite episode |title=Episode Three |series=Big Brother 11 |serieslink=Big Brother (U.S.) |network=CBS |airdate=July 14, 2009 |minutes=39:20 |season=11 |number=1}}</ref>\n*'''Power of Veto (PoV):'''  After the nominees are determined, the Power of Veto competition is played, with the winner receiving the Power of Veto. If a HouseGuest chooses to exercise the Power of Veto, the Head of Household is responsible for naming a replacement nominee.<ref name=veto>http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bbcan/features/0301/how-big-brother-canada-works-usa-america</ref> The holder of the Power of Veto is save from being nominated as the replacement nominee.<ref>http://www.tvguide.com/news/big-brother-dumbest-moves-ever/</ref> Only six of the HouseGuests compete for the Power of Veto each week; the Head of Household and both nominations compete, as well as three others selected by a random draw. The PoV was introduced in the third American season\n*'''Eviction:''' On eviction night, all HouseGuests must vote to evict one of the nominees, with the exception of the nominees and the Head of Household. The eviction vote is by [[secret ballot]], with HouseGuests casting their votes orally in the Diary Room. In the event of a tied vote, the Head of Household will cast a tie-breaking vote publicly. The nominee with the majority of the votes is evicted from the house.<ref name=\"format-ep4\">{{cite episode |title=Episode Four |series=Big Brother 11 |serieslink=Big Brother (U.S.) |network=CBS |airdate=July 16, 2009 |minutes=33:20 |season=11 |number=1}}</ref>\n\nBefore the sixteenth US season, HouseGuests competed in a Have/Have-Not challenge similar to the shopping tasks on ''Big Brother UK'' and other international editions. The winners become Haves and enjoy luxury foods, while Have-Nots, who must eat \"slop\" (a fortified oatmeal), sleep in designated uncomfortable beds and take cold showers. In later seasons, the Haves & Have-Nots are determined either by the HoH themself or by the HoH Competition.\n\nWhen only two contestants remain, a jury formed of the most recently evicted HouseGuests (generally seven or nine) votes which of the two finalists wins the grand prize. Beginning in the fourth (2003) US season, jury members were sequestered off-site so that they would not be privy to the day-to-day goings-on in the house. (''Celebrity Big Brother US'' does not currently sequester its jury members\u2014all evicted celebrity HouseGuests vote on the winner.).<ref>{{cite web |last=Powell |first=John |title='Big Brother' twist unveiled |work=JAM!

Once only two HouseGuests remain, the members of the jury cast their votes for who should win the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2012/09/20/big-brother-14-finale-episode-breakdown-ian-quacks-to-500k/|title='Big Brother' 14 Finale Episode Breakdown: Ian Quacks To 500K \u00ab CBS Detroit|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, US and Canadian ''Big Brother'' do not air a live launch show, as is customary in international editions\u2014by the time the network show and live online feeds begin airing, it is not uncommon for at least one HouseGuest to already have been evicted. Also, the North American editions currently air only three times a week, compared with daily or six days a week for the recently cancelled UK franchise. As a result, the TV episodes focus primarily on the main events regarding the gameplay and politics versus the day-to-day goings-on in the house; to see the latter, watching the live feeds is necessary.\n\nIn 2013, English-speaking Canada introduced its own version of the show on the cable channel [[Slice (TV channel)|Slice]]; the series moved to [[Global TV]] for its third (2015) season. The show followed the US format, but with more elaborate twists and greater viewer participation in the game. Secret tasks were introduced, usually presented by the show's mascot, \"Marsha the Moose\"; also, as in most global franchises, Big Brother was a distinct character who interacted with the HouseGuests. The [[Big Brother (Quebecer TV series)|French Canadian version]] mostly followed the US/Anglophone Canadian format, but the public could evict a housemate on some occasions and decided the winner.\n\n''[[Big Brother Brasil]]'' combines the US/Canada and international formats. Brazil votes on evictions and the winner, but housemates compete for HoH, Power of Immunity, and Power of Veto; there is also a weekly shopping competition. HoH nominates one housemate for eviction, while the rest of the house nominates a second housemate. The winner of the Power of Immunity competition gets to choose someone to be safe from nomination. \n\nThe pilot for ''[[Big Brother China: Pilot Season|Big Brother China]]'', which premiered exclusively online in 2015, had housemates voting on evictions but the public voting for the winner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/cbb16/news/1121/big-brother-china-pilot-season-premieres-online-youku-tudou-housemates-lets-stay-together-india-house-bigg-boss|title=Big Brother China launches with twelve-day 'pilot series'|last=bbspy}}</ref> The same format was used for ''[[Big Brother: Over the Top]]'', an online-only spinoff of the US series that ran in 2016.\n\nThe 2020 revival of the Australia ''Big Brother series'' series is also rumoured to adopt the American format \u2013 having previously used the original international format.\n\n=== Other editions ===\nThe ''Big Brother'' format has been otherwise modified in some countries:\n* ''Big Brother: All-Stars'' (Belgium, 21 days; [[Bulgaria]]: Season 1\u20135, 27\u201329 days; United States, 72 days; United Kingdom, 18 days; [[Loft Story (Canadian TV series)#Season 6|French Canada]], 64 days; Africa, 91 days; Spain, 56 days; [[Portugal]] ''Secret Story'': Season 1\u20134, 22\u201350 days): Previous housemates from previous seasons compete.

Portugal was the first country to complete 4 All-Stars seasons (2015). Portugal was the first country to complete 5 All-Stars seasons (2017). Portugal was the first country to complete 6 All-Stars seasons (2018).\n* ''Big Brother: Reality All-Stars'' (Sweden, 6 days; [[Denmark]], 32 days; Spain, 56 days): Contestants from different reality shows, including ''Big Brother'', compete.\n* ''Big Brother: You Decide / Big Brother: Back in the House / Big Brother: Try Out'' ([[Poland]]: Season 1\u20132, 7\u201313 days; [[Norway]], 9 days; [[Serbia]], 7 days): Housemates, new or old, compete for a spot in the next regular season without nominations or evictions.\n* ''[[Teen Big Brother: The Experiment|Teen Big Brother]]'' (United Kingdom, 10 days; [[Philippines]]: Season 1\u20134, 42\u201391 days): Teenagers 13 and older compete.\n* ''[[Pinoy Big Brother: All In|Big Brother: All In]]'' (Philippines: Season 11,13): A mix of teenagers, regular adults, and celebrities compete in one season. A variation, ''[[Pinoy Big Brother: Lucky 7|Big Brother: Lucky 7]]'' and ''[[Pinoy Big Brother: Otso|Big Brother: Otso]]'', has three to four batch of housemates stay inside until a number for each batch is left, and is joined by other members of other batches to form one new batch.\n* ''[[Secret Story (disambiguation)#Television|Secret Story]]'' (France, [[Lithuania]], [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[Peru]] and [[Albania]]): Each housemate has a secret.\n* ''[[Big Brother Panto (UK)|Big Brother Panto]]'' (United Kingdom, 11 days): Housemates from the previous series spent time in the Big Brother House to perform a [[pantomime]] at the series' end.\n* ''[[Big Brother Germany (season 6)|Big Brother \u2013 The Village]]'' (Germany: Season 6, 363 days): The village had a class system of bosses, assistants and servants, living in separate houses, who competed in mixed teams; winning bosses could promote employees, while losing bosses became servants. Cash prizes were awarded weekly in an ongoing contest.\n* ''[[Big Brother Family]]'' (Bulgaria: 81 days): Whole families entered the house with their spouses, children and relatives. They received a salary for their stay and the winning family received a cash prize, a car and an apartment.\n\nThere are also \"test runs\", with a group of celebrities (or journalists) living in the house for several days to test it. There are occasions where people who have auditioned for the show are also put in the house, most notably in the British edition, where many housemates claim to have met before.

April 2000, Castaway, an independent production company, filed a lawsuit against John de Mol and Endemol for stealing the concepts of their own show called ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survive!]]'', a reality television show where contestants are placed on a deserted island and have to take care of themselves alone. These contestants were also filmed by cameras around them.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/720966.stm | title=Geldof's Big Brother battle | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=20 April 2000 | accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref> The court later dismissed the lawsuit filed by Castaway against de Mol and Endemol.

In ''Big Brother South Africa'', a male housemate was accused of assaulting a fellow housemate while she was asleep. The pair were filmed kissing and cuddling in bed before the cameras moved away and the male housemate reportedly claimed to housemates the next day that he had intercourse with the contestant. However, the female housemate was apparently shocked by the claims and informed female housemates that she had not consented to have sex with him. (Under South African law, this act would be constituted as rape.)<ref name=africarape>{{cite web|last1=Paterson|first1=Mark|title=Big Brother's South African rape horror show|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/tv-radio/big-brother/28073/big-brother%E2%80%99s-south-african-rape-horror-show|website=The Week|publisher=Dennis Publishing|accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref> This male housemate was expelled immediately after the allegations surfaced, while the female housemate was removed from the house for her own protection and counselling.\n\nIn ''Big Brother Brasil'', many viewers reported that they watched a male housemate allegedly force himself on a female housemate while she was passed-out drunk after a \"boozy party\".<ref name=brazilrape>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/17/big-brother-brazil-alleged-rape|title=Big Brother Brazil contestant questioned over alleged rape|first=Tom|last=Phillips|date=17 January 2012|accessdate=7 January 2020|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, an incident of sexual assault occurred in the Australian Big Brother house in 2006, during the show's [[Big Brother (Australian season 6)|sixth season]].

The name is inspired by ''[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]'' from [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', and the housemates are continuously monitored during their stay in the house by live television cameras as well as personal audio microphones. Throughout the course of the competition, they are voted out (usually on a weekly basis) until only one remains and wins the cash prize.\n\n{{As of|2019|9|21}}, there have been 448 seasons of ''Big Brother'' in over 54 franchise countries and regions. English-language editions of the program are often referred to by its initials \"BB\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/big-brother/episodes?season=15706http:/www.channel5.com/shows/big-brother/episodes?season=15706|title=Celebrity Big Brother|publisher=Channel 5}}</ref> The title of many Spanish-language editions of the program is translated as ''Gran Hermano'' (GH).\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Premise ==\n[[File:International Logo of Big Brother.png|thumb|250px|The international ''Big Brother'' logo used from 1999 to 2018.]]\nAt regular intervals, the housemates privately nominate a number of their fellow housemates whom they wish to be evicted from the house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.endemol.com/programme/big-brother|title=Big Brother|website=|publisher=[[Endemol]]|url-status=live|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref> The housemates with the most nominations are then announced, and viewers are given the opportunity to [[televoting|vote via telephone]] for the nominee they wish to be evicted or saved from eviction. The last person remaining is declared the winner.\n\nSome more recent editions have since included additional methods of voting, such as voting through social media and smartphone applications. Occasionally, non-standard votes occur, where two houseguests are evicted at once or no one is voted out. In the earlier series of ''Big Brother'', there were 10 contestants with evictions every two weeks. However, the UK version introduced a larger number of contestants with weekly evictions. Most versions of ''Big Brother'' follow the weekly eviction format, broadcast over approximately three months for 16 contestants.\n\nThe contestants are required to do housework and are assigned tasks by the producers of the show (who communicate with the housemates via the omnipresent authority figure known to them only as \"Big Brother\"). The tasks are designed to test their teamwork abilities and community spirit. In some countries, the housemates' shopping budget or weekly allowance (to buy food and other essentials) depends on the outcome of assigned tasks.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Name ===\nThe term ''Big Brother'' originates from [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]],'' with its theme of continuous oppressive surveillance.<ref name=\"Nordicom 1\" /> The program also relies on other techniques, such as a stripped back-to-basic environment, evictions, weekly tasks and competitions set by ''Big Brother'', and the \"Diary Room\" (or \"Confession Room\") where housemates convey their private thoughts to the camera and reveal their nominees for eviction.\n\n=== Creation ===\nThe first version of ''Big Brother'' was broadcast in 1999 on [[Veronica (TV channel)|Veronica]] in the [[Big Brother (Netherlands)|Netherlands]]. In the first season of ''Big Brother'', the house was very basic. Although essential amenities such as running water, furniture, and a limited ration of food were provided, luxury items were often forbidden. This added a [[survivalist]] element to the show, increasing the potential for social tension. Nearly all later series provide a modern house for the contest with a Jacuzzi, sauna, VIP suite, [[loft]], and other luxuries.\n\n=== International expansion ===\nThe format has become an international TV franchise. While each country or region has its own variation, the common theme is that the contestants are confined to the house and have their every action recorded by cameras and microphones and that no contact with the outside world is permitted.\n\nMost international versions of the show remain quite similar to each other: their main format remains true to the original [[fly on the wall]] observational style with the emphasis on human relationships, to the extent that contestants usually are forbidden from discussing nominations or voting strategy. In 2001, the [[Big Brother (American TV series)|American version]] adopted a different format during its second season, where the contestants are encouraged to strategize to advance in the game; in this format, the contestants themselves vote to evict each other. ''[[Big Brother Canada]]'', introduced in 2013, also follows the American format.  In 2011, the [[Big Brother (UK TV series)|UK version]] controversially adapted the discussion of nominations before reversing this rule after a poll by ''Big Brother'' broadcaster [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb13/features/0608/poll-big-brother-2012-housemates-discuss-nominations|title=POLL: Should housemates be able to talk nominations?|author=Scott, Matt|date=8 June 2012|website=|publisher=BBSpy|url-status=live|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nWith the cancellation of the UK edition in 2018 and the 2020 rebooted Australian series expected to follow the American format , ''[[Big Brother Naija]]'' (Nigeria)  is the only English-speaking edition in the franchise that follows the original international format.\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Overview ===\nFrom a sociological and demographic perspective, ''Big Brother'' allows an analysis of how people react<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/psychologist-behind-big-brother/news-story/e193d00b9cc9a23be9917232d1a2e20c|title=Meet the psychologist behind Big Brother|website=news.com.au|access-date=19 March 2019}}</ref> when forced into close confinement with people outside of their [[comfort zone]] (having different opinions or ideals, or from a different socioeconomic group). The viewer has the opportunity to see how a person reacts from the outside (through the constant recording of their actions) and the inside (in the Diary or Confession Room). The Diary Room is where contestants can privately express their feelings about the game, strategy and the other contestants. The results range from violent or angry confrontations to genuine and tender connections (often including romantic interludes).\n\nThe show is notable for involving the Internet. Although the show typically broadcasts daily updates during the evening (sometimes criticized by viewers and former contestants for heavy editing by producers),<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/enforcement/broadcast-bulletins/obb110/issue110.pdf | title=Complaint by Ms Dawn Blake | author=Blake, Dawn | journal=[[Ofcom]] Broadcast Bulletin | date=27 May 2008 | issue=110 | type=PDF}}</ref> viewers can also watch a continuous feed from multiple cameras on the Web in most countries. These websites were successful, even after some national series began charging for access to the video stream. In some countries, Internet broadcasting was supplemented by updates via email, [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] and SMS. The house is shown live on satellite television, although in some countries there is a 10\u201315 minutes delay to allow libelous or unacceptable content (such as references to people not participating in the program who have not consented to have personal information broadcast) to be removed.\n\nContestants occasionally develop sexual relationships; the level of sexual explicitness allowed to be shown in broadcast and Internet-feed varies according to the country's broadcasting standards.\n\n=== Isolation ===\n''Big Brother'' contestants are isolated in the house, without access to television, radio, or the Internet. They are not permitted routine communication with the outside world. This was an important issue for most earlier series of the show. In more-recent series, contestants are occasionally allowed to view televised events (usually as a reward for winning at a task). In most versions of the program, books and writing materials are also forbidden, although exceptions are sometimes made for religious materials such as the Bible, [[Tanakh]] or the [[Qur'an]]. Some versions ban all writing implements, even items that can be used to write (such as lipstick or eyeliner). Despite the housemates' isolation, some contestants are occasionally allowed to leave the house as part of tasks. Contestants are permitted to leave the house in an emergency.\n\nNews from the outside world may occasionally be given as a reward. Additionally, news of extraordinary events from the outside world may be given to the Housemates if such information is considered important, such notable past examples include that of national election results,<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9QD2hSPNT0</ref> the [[September 11 attacks]],<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6omREKjPlo</ref> and the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OxZCXgAOCk</ref>\n\nContestants have regularly-scheduled interactions with the show's host on eviction nights. Throughout each day, the program's producer, in the \"Big Brother\" voice, issues directives and commands to contestants. Some versions of the show allow private counselling sessions with a psychologist. These are allowed at any time and are often conducted by telephone from the Diary Room.\n\n== Format changes and twists ==\n\n=== Regional versions ===\n[[File:Big brother countries.PNG|430px|thumbnail|alt=World map, with different shading for \"Big Brother\" versions|Locations of ''Big Brother'' versions:\n{{legend|blue|With individual franchises}}\n{{legend|#ADFF2F|Part of ''Big Brother Africa''}}\n{{legend|#568203|Part of ''Big Brother Angola e Mo\u00e7ambique''; Also part of ''Big Brother Africa''}}\n{{legend|green|With individual franchises; Also part of ''Big Brother Africa''}}\n{{legend|#ADD8E6|Part of ''Big Brother:'' \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633}}\n{{legend|pink|Part of ''Gran Hermano del Pac\u00edfico''}}\n{{legend|red|With individual franchises; Also part of ''Gran Hermano del Pac\u00edfico''}}\n{{legend|maroon|Part of ''Veliki brat''}}\n{{legend|#FEDF00|With individual franchises; Also part of ''Big Brother'' of Scandinavia}}]]\nDue to the intelligibility of certain languages across several nations, it has been possible to make regional versions of ''Big Brother''. All of these follow the normal ''Big Brother'' rules, except that contestants must come from each of the countries in the region where it airs: ''[[Big Brother (Albanian TV series)|Big Brother Albania]]'' of [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]], ''[[Big Brother Angola & Mozambique|Big Brother Angola e Mo\u00e7ambique]]'' of [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]], ''[[Big Brother Africa]]'' of Africa (includes Angola, [[Botswana]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Liberia]], [[Malawi]], Mozambique, [[Namibia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Rwanda]], [[Sierra Leone]], South Africa, [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]), [[Big Brother: The Boss|''Big Brother:'' \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633]] of the Middle East (includes [[Bahrain]], [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Oman]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Somalia]], [[Syria]] and [[Tunisia]]), ''[[Gran Hermano (Pacific)|Gran Hermano del Pac\u00edfico]]'' of South America (includes Chile, [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]]), ''[[Big Brother (Sweden and Norway)|Big Brother]]'' of Scandinavia (includes [[Norway]] and Sweden) and ''[[Veliki brat 2011|Veliki brat]]'' of the Balkans (includes [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[North Macedonia]]). The British version of the show accepts Irish applicants and was available between 2000 and 2010 as Channel 4 was available; {{as of|2015|lc=yes}} the show returned to Irish screens as TV3 bought the rights from UK broadcaster Channel 5 to air the show.\n\nOn the other hand, some countries have multiple franchises based on language. India has the most regional-based versions Hindi, Marathi, Telugu, Bengali, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam language versions; Canada has French- and English-language versions; and the United States has English- and Spanish-language versions of the show.\n\n=== Twists involving single franchises ===\n\n==== Multiple areas and houses ====\nIn 2001, ''[[Big Brother (Dutch TV series)#Season 3|Big Brother 3]]'' of the Netherlands introduced the \"Rich and Poor\" concept, wherein the house is separated into a luxurious half and a poor half and two teams of housemates compete for a place in the luxurious half. The Dutch version continued this concept until its [[Big Brother (Netherlands)#Season 4|fourth season]]. Other versions later followed and introduced a similar concept, of which some have their own twists: [[Big Brother Africa|Africa]] (in [[Big Brother Africa (season 5)|2010]], [[Big Brother Africa (season 6)|2011]], [[Big Brother Africa (season 7)|2012]] and [[Big Brother Africa (season 8)|2013]]), [[Big Brother (Albania)|Albania]] (in [[Big Brother 3 (Albania)|2010]]), [[Big Brother (Australian TV series)|Australia]] (in [[Big Brother 3 (Australia)|2003]] and [[Big Brother 10 (Australia)|2013]]), [[Veliki Brat|Balkan States]] (in [[Veliki Brat VIP 4|VIP 2010]] and [[Veliki brat 2011|2011]]), [[Big Brother Brasil|Brazil]] (from [[Big Brother Brasil 9|2009]] to [[Big Brother Brasil 20|2020]]), [[Big Brother (Canada)|Canada]] ([[Big Brother 1 (Canada)|2013]]\u2013present), [[Big Brother (Denmark)|Denmark]] (in [[Big Brother (Denmark)#Big Brother 3|2003]]), [[Big Brother (Finland)|Finland]] (in [[Big Brother 2009 (Finland)|2009]] and [[Big Brother 2014 (Finland)|2014]]), France (in [[Secret Story 3 (France)|2009]], [[Secret Story 5 (France)|2011]]\u2013present), [[Big Brother Germany|Germany]] (in [[Big Brother Germany (Season 4)|2003]], [[Big Brother Germany (Season 5)|2004\u201305]], [[Big Brother Germany (Season 6)|2005\u201306]], [[Big Brother Germany (Season 8)|2008]] and [[Big Brother Germany (Season 9)|2008\u201309]]), [[Big Brother (Greece)|Greece]] (in [[Big Brother (Greece)#Season 3|2003]]), [[Bigg Boss|India]] (in [[Bigg Boss 6|2012]] and [[Bigg Boss 7|2013]]), [[HaAh HaGadol|Israel]] (in [[HaAh HaGadol 2|2009]]), [[Grande Fratello|Italy]] (in [[Grande Fratello Season 6|2006]] and [[Grande Fratello Season 7|2007]]), [[Big Brother Norway|Norway]] (in [[Big Brother Norway#Big Brother 3 - Next Generation|2003]]), [[Pinoy Big Brother|Philippines]] (in [[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|2009]], [[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition 3|Teen 2010]] and [[Pinoy Big Brother: Unlimited|2011]]), [[Big Brother (Poland)|Poland]] (in [[Big Brother (Poland)#Season 3|2002]]), [[Big Brother (Portugal)|Portugal]] (in [[Big Brother VIP (Portugal)|VIP 2013]] and [[Secret Story 6 (Portugal)|2016]]), [[Big Brother (Slovakia)|Slovakia]] (in [[Big Brother (Slovakia)|2005]]), [[Big Brother (Slovenia)|Slovenia]] (in [[Big Brother Slovenia Season 2|2008]], [[Big Brother 3 (Slovenia)|2015]] and [[Big Brother 4 (Slovenia)|2016]]), [[Big Brother (Sweden and Norway)|Scandinavia]] (in [[Big Brother (Sweden and Norway)#Season one|2005]]), [[Big Brother (South Africa)|South Africa]] (in [[Big Brother Mzansi 3 (South Africa)|2014]]), [[Gran Hermano (Spain)|Spain]] (in [[Gran Hermano Spain (VIP Season 1)|VIP 2004]], [[Gran Hermano Spain (Season 10)|2008]], [[Gran Hermano Spain (Season 11)|2009\u201310]] and [[Gran Hermano Spain (Season 12)|2010]]), [[Big Brother (UK)|United Kingdom]] (in [[Big Brother (UK series 3)|2002]], [[Celebrity Big Brother (UK series 5)|Celebrity 2007]], [[Big Brother (UK series 9)|2008]], [[Celebrity Big Brother (UK series 11)|Celebrity 2013]] and [[Big Brother (UK series 17)|2016]]) and [[Big Brother (U.S.)|United States]] ([[Big Brother 11 (U.S.)|2009]]\u2013present).\n\nIn 2011\u201312, the [[Gran Hermano Argentina (season 7)|seventh Argentine series]] added ''La Casa de al Lado'' (\"The House Next Door\"), a smaller, more luxurious house which served multiple functions. The first week it hosted 4 potential housemates, and the public voted for two of them to enter the main house. The second week, two pairs of twins competed in the same fashion, with only one pair allowed in. Later, the 3rd, 4th and 5th evicted contestants were given the choice of staying on their way out and they competed for the public's vote to reenter the house. Months later, after one of the contestants left the house voluntarily, the House Next Door reopened for four contestants who wanted to reenter and had not been in such a playoff before. The House Next Door was also used in other occasions to accommodate contestants from the main house for limited periods of time, especially to have more privacy (which of course could be seen by the public).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}<!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP-->\n\nThe [[Big Brother Brasil 9|ninth Brazilian season]] featured the \"Bubble\": a glass house in a shopping mall in Rio de Janeiro where four potential housemates lived for a week. Later in the season, a bubble was built inside the Big Brother house, with another two housemates living in it for a week until they were voted in and the glass house dismantled. The Glass House was reused in the [[Big Brother Brasil 11|eleventh season]], featuring five evicted housemates competing for a chance to join the house again, and in the [[Big Brother Brasil 13|thirteenth season]], with six potential housemates competing for two places in the main house. A dividing wall from the ninth season was reused in the [[Big Brother Brasil 14|fourteenth Brazilian season]], when mothers and aunts of the housemates entered for [[International Women's Day]] and stayed in the house for 6 days, though they could not be seen by the housemates. Every season brings back the glass house. Some editions also featured an all white panic room, where contestants where held until one of them decided to quit the show.\n\nIn the [[Big Brother Canada (season 4)|fourth English-Canadian season]], two house guests were evicted and moved into a special suite where they were able to watch the remaining house guests. A week later, the houseguests were required to unanimously decide which of them to bring back into the house.\n\n==== Evil Big Brother ====\nIn 2004, the [[Big Brother (British series 5)|fifth UK series]] introduced a villainous Big Brother with harsher punishments, such as taking away prize money, more difficult tasks and secret tricks. This concept has also been used in Australia, [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Finland]], Germany, [[Greece]], Italy, the [[Netherlands]], South America,{{clarify|date=November 2017}} [[Scandinavia]],{{clarify|date=November 2017}} [[Serbia]], Spain, [[Thailand]], [[Philippines]] and Mexico.\n\n==== Twin or triplet housemates ====\nIn 2004, the [[Big Brother 5 (American season)|fifth US season]] introduced twins who were tasked with secretly switching back and forth in the house; they were allowed to play the game as individual house guests after succeeding at the deception for five weeks. This twist was reused in the [[Big Brother 17 (U.S.)|seventeenth US season]] with an easier task of successfully changing places for five weeks without being ''evicted''.\n\nThis twin or triplet twist was used in several countries. Some made modifications to this twist; others have had twins in the house together without this element of secrecy. The following are the countries that have featured twins or triplets: Australia (in [[Big Brother (Australian season 5)|2005]]), Germany (in [[Big Brother Germany (season 6)|2005\u201306]]), Bulgaria (in [[Big Brother 3 (Bulgaria)|2006]], [[Big Brother All Stars 2012 (Bulgaria)|2012]] and [[VIP Brother 9|VIP 2017]]), United Kingdom (in [[Big Brother (UK series 8)|2007]], [[Celebrity Big Brother (UK series 8)|Celebrity 2011]], [[Celebrity Big Brother (UK series 9)|Celebrity 2012]], [[Big Brother (UK series 14)|2013]], [[Big Brother (UK series 16)|2015]], [[Big Brother (UK series 17)|2016]] and [[Celebrity Big Brother (UK series 19)|Celebrity 2017]]), France (in [[Secret Story 2007 (France)|2007]], [[Secret Story 2011 (France)|2011]], [[Secret Story 7 (France)|2013]], [[Secret Story 9 (France)|2015]] and [[Secret Story 10 (France)|2016]]), Spain (in [[Gran Hermano Spain (season 9)|2007]] and [[Gran Hermano 14 (Spain)|2013]]), Poland (in [[Big Brother (Poland)#Season 4|2007]] and [[Big Brother (Polish season 7)|2019]]), India (in [[Bigg Boss (Season 2)#Sana Wadiwala|2008]]), Africa (in [[Big Brother Africa (season 4)|2009]]), Balkan Region (in [[Veliki brat 2009|2009]] and [[Veliki Brat VIP 5|2013]]), Philippines (in [[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|2009]], [[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition 4|Teen 2012]] and [[Pinoy Big Brother: All In|2014]]), Portugal (in [[Secret Story 2010 (Portugal)|2010]] and [[Secret Story 3 (Portugal)|2012]]), Israel (in [[HaAh HaGadol 3|2011]]), Ukraine (in [[Big Brother (Ukraine)|2011]]), Argentina (in [[Gran Hermano Argentina (season 7)|2011]] and [[Gran Hermano Argentina (season 9)|2016]]) and Albania (in [[Big Brother 6 (Albania)|2013]] and [[Big Brother 9 (Albania)|2017]]).\n\n==== Pairs competitions ====\nSeveral versions of the program feature variations of the housemates competing in pairs:\n\n* In [[Big Brother 6 (American season)|sixth American season]], each HouseGuest had a secret partner with whom had a pre-existing relationship. While each player was nominated and evicted as an individual, each pair had the goal of reaching being the Final 2 HouseGuests remaining. Should a secret pair succeed in this goal, the prize money awarded to the winner and runner-up would jackpot \u2013 the winner's prize doubling from $500,000 to $1,000,000 and the runner-up's prize quintupling from $50,000 to $250,000. \n* During the tenth week of the [[Big Brother (British series 7)|seventh UK series]], the housemates were paired with their \"best friend\" in the house and had to nominate and face eviction as couples. \n** The [[Big Brother 9 (American season)|ninth American season]] added a romantic theme by pairing up the HouseGuests with their \"Soulmate\" and having them compete as couples. This twist was active for the first 3 weeks of the season. \n** The [[Big Brother 13 (American season)|13th American season]] featured a further twist to the pairs format by introducing the \"Dynamic Duos\" twist, where contestants formed pairs that would be nominated together but evicted separately. The nominee not evicted would be immune from further nomination until there were 10 HouseGuests remaining, at which point the pairs were dissolved.\n*  The second season of the [[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition Plus|Philippine teen edition]] also featured the parents or guardians of the teens staying in the house; if a teen housemate was evicted, the coinciding parent or guardian would also be evicted.  A similar twist was used on the [[Big Brother (Greece)#Season 4 (2005)|fourth Greek season]] was dubbed \"Big Mother\", and featured housemates accompanied by their mothers.\n* In the ninth season of Indian ''Big Brother'', \"Big Boss: Double Trouble\", contestants entered the house tied up in pairs by the waist. They had joint chairs, beds, spoons, and even mugs. The twelfth season of Indian Big Brother \"Bigg Boss 12\" also featured pairs 'jodis' who were Teacher-Student, Policeman-Lawyer, sister-sister, etc.\n* In the [[Big Brother 9 (Albania)|ninth Albania season]] all the housemates wherever were in couples and for the first time in the history of ''Big Brother'', the winner was a couple (Danjel Dedndreaj and Fotini Derxho).\n\n==== Secret missions ====\nSecret missions are a common element of the show since their introduction during the [[Big Brother (UK series 6)|sixth UK series]]. During these missions, one or more housemates are set a task from Big Brother with the reward of luxuries for the household and/or a personal reward if the task is successful. Some versions of Big Brother have secret tasks presented by another character who lives in plain sight of the housemate. Such characters include Marsha the Moose (from BB Canada) and Surly the Fish (from BB Australia).\n\nThe [[Big Brother 8 (U.S.)|eighth US season]] introduced \"America's Player\", where a selected house guest must complete various tasks (determined by public vote) in secret for the duration of their stay in the house in exchange for a cash reward. It was repeated in the [[Big Brother 10 (U.S.)|tenth US season]] for a week. The [[Big Brother 11 (U.S.)|eleventh US season]] featured Pandora's Box, in which the winning head of household was tempted to open a box, with [[unintended consequences]] for the house. The [[Big Brother 12 (U.S.)|twelfth US season]] featured a saboteur, who entered the house to wreak havoc with tasks suggested by viewers. The [[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)|sixteenth US season]] featured \"Team America\", in which 3 houseguests were selected to work as a team to complete tasks (determined by public voting) for a cash reward; this continued for the entire season despite the eviction of a team member.\n\nThe [[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 4|fourth Argentine series]] added a telephone in the living room. This telephone rang once a week for ten seconds, and the person to pick up the receiver was given an order or news from Big Brother (which typically no other housemate could hear). The order could be beneficial or detrimental, but a refused order resulted in nomination for eviction. If nobody picked up the call, the whole house would be nominated for eviction.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}<!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP-->\n\n==== Opening night twists ====\nSince ''[[Big Brother (British series 2)|Big Brother 2]]'', the [[Big Brother (British TV series)|UK series]] has opened with a twist. This has included having three finalists (''Big Brother 2''); public voting for least-favourite housemates, with the housemates choosing between two nominees to evict (''Big Brother 3''); first-night nominations (''[[Big Brother (British series 4)|Big Brother 4]]''); suitcase nominations (''Big Brother 5''); Unlucky Housemate 13 (''Big Brother 6''); Big Brother Hood (''[[Big Brother (British series 7)|Big Brother 7]]''); an all-female house and a set of twins as contestants (''[[Big Brother (British series 8)|Big Brother 8]]''); a couple entering as housemates, who must hide their relationship (''[[Big Brother (British series 9)|Big Brother 9]]''); housemates having to earn housemate status (''[[Big Brother (British series 10)|Big Brother 10]]''); a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] entering the house with an impossible task (''[[Big Brother (British series 11)|Big Brother 11]]''); [[Pamela Anderson]] entering as a guest for 5 days ([[Big Brother (British series 12)|Big Brother 12]]); first-night nominations and a public vote for a wildcard to become a housemate ([[Big Brother (British series 13)|Big Brother 13]]); a professional actor posing as a housemate and a mother and daughter as contestants ([[Big Brother (British series 14)|Big Brother 14]]); one contestant gets a pass to the final ([[Big Brother (British series 15)|Big Brother 15]]); first night eviction ([[Big Brother (British series 16)|Big Brother 16]]); two houses with \"the other house\" featuring enemies from the main house housemates past ([[Big Brother (British series 17)|Big Brother 17]]); [[Jackie Stallone]] entering a house containing her son's ex-wife [[Brigitte Nielsen]] (''[[Celebrity Big Brother (British series 3)|Celebrity Big Brother 3]]''); a non-celebrity in a celebrity edition (''[[Celebrity Big Brother (British series 4)|Celebrity Big Brother 4]]''); a visit from [[Jade Goody]]'s family (''[[Celebrity Big Brother (British series 5)|Celebrity Big Brother 5]]'') and unlocked bedrooms allowing housemates to immediately claim beds<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2009/01/05/celebrity-big-brother-exclusive-la-toya-jackson-s-diva-demands-115875-21016252/ | title=Celebrity Big Brother exclusive: La Toya Jackson's diva demands \u2013 3am & Mirror Online | newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] | date=25 January 2009 | accessdate=15 July 2013 | author=Bryant, Tom}}</ref> with the last housemate becoming the Head of House (''[[Celebrity Big Brother (British series 6)|Celebrity Big Brother 6]]'').\n\nA common opening twist is to only introduce a cast of a single-sex on the premiere of the show while having members of the opposite sex introduced over the next few days. The [[Big Brother (UK series 8)|eighth UK series]] first used this twist with an initial all-female house, adding a male housemate two days later. The same twist was used in the ([[Big Brother 4 (Bulgaria)|fourth Bulgarian series]]), and an all-male premiere was used on ''[[Big Brother Africa (season 4)|Big Brother Africa 4]]''.\n\n==== Fake evictions ====\nThe fifth UK series introduced fake evictions, where Big Brother misleads housemates that eviction has taken place, only for the \"evicted\" housemate to reenter the house sometime later.\n\nIn the eighth UK series, one housemate was evicted, interviewed and sent back into the house.\n\nIn the [[Pinoy Big Brother: All In|fifth Philippine edition]], four housemates were fake-evicted and stayed in a place called ''bodega''.\n\nIn the [[Big Brother (Australian season 10)|tenth Australian season]], Benjamin Zabel was fake-evicted for 24 hours before being returned to the house with immunity from eviction for that week. In the [[Big Brother 11 (Australia)|eleventh Australian season]] Travis Lunardi was fake-evicted and received advice from Benjamin Zabel for 24 hours; Travis returned to the house after a 3-day absence with immunity from eviction for that week.\n\nIn the [[Big Brother Brasil 13|thirteenth Brazilian series]], Anamara Barreira was fake-evicted. She was removed and put into a small private apartment without the other housemates knowing she was still in the house. After 24 hours, she returned to the house as Head of Household and with immunity from eviction that week. In the [[Big Brother Brasil 16|sixteenth Brazilian series]], Ana Paula Renault was similarly fake-evicted, put into a small private apartment, and returned after 48 hours with immunity from eviction that week. In the [[Big Brother Brasil 18|eighteen Brazilian series]], [[Gleici Damasceno]] was similarly fake-evicted, put into a small private apartment, and returned after 72 hours with immunity from eviction and with the power to put someone to eviction.\n\nIn the [[Big Brother T\u00fcrkiye|first Turkish series]], there is a fake eviction in week 10.\n\nThe Indian version ''[[Bigg Boss (franchise)|Bigg Boss]]'' sees frequent fake evictions. In Kannada Bigg Boss season 4, winner Pratham and co-contestant Malavika were kept in secret room after fake eviction for one week and they were both allowed in the Bigg Boss house.\n\nSimilarly in Kannada Bigg Boss season 5, firstly Jaya Srinivasan and Sameer Acharya were put into the secret room after fake eviction for one week and then Sameer Acharya was allowed into the house but Jaya Srinivasan was evicted from the secret room itself. In the same season, the runner up Divakar was put into the secret room after fake eviction for one week.\n\n==== Coaches ====\n[[Big Brother 14 (American season)|The fourteenth US season]] had four house guests from past seasons return to coach twelve new house guests, playing for a separate prize of $100,000. However, in a reset twist, they opted to join the normal game alongside the other house guests.\n\n==== Red button ====\nThe seventh Argentine series incorporated a red button into the Confession Room, which would sound an alarm throughout the house. This button was to be used when a contestant wanted to leave the house voluntarily, and the contestant would be given five minutes to leave the house.<ref name=\"Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre\">{{Citation|title=Anexo:S\u00e9ptima temporada de Gran Hermano (Argentina)|date=2018-06-15|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anexo:S%C3%A9ptima_temporada_de_Gran_Hermano_(Argentina)&oldid=108714582|work=Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre|language=es|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref> A red button is also used in ''[[Secret Story (France)|Secret Story]]'' series, however in this case whoever presses the button will try to guess someone's secret.\n\n==== Legacy rewards or penalties ====\nIn ''[[Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack|Celebrity Hijack UK]]'', evicted housemates were given the opportunity to choose if a \"ninja\" delivered good or bad gifts to the house. Later that year, the [[Big Brother 8 (Australia)|eighth Australian series]] introduced the Housemate Hand Grenade, where an evicted housemate decided which remaining housemate received a penalty. A similar punishment used on ''[[Big Brother Africa]]'' was called the Molotov Cocktail, Dagger or Fuse.\n\n==== Most valuable player ====\nThe [[Big Brother 15 (American season)|fifteenth US season]] allowed viewers to vote for a house guest to be made M.V.P., who then secretly nominates a third houseguest for eviction (in addition to the two selected by the Head of Household).\n\nIn a further twist introduced part-way through the MVP twist, the viewers themselves decided who the third nominee would be, with the HouseGuests still thinking one of their own is the MVP. Like many such twists, this was ended halfway into the season as the pool of contestants shrank.\n\n==== Multiple heads of household ====\nThe [[Big Brother 16 (American season)|sixteenth]] and [[Big Brother 17 (American season)|seventeenth]] US seasons featured two Heads of Household every week and had four houseguests nominated for eviction. There was also a \"Battle of the Block\" competition where the two sets of nominees competed to save themselves; the winning pair not only saved themselves but dethroned the Head of Household who nominated them, who was then vulnerable as a replacement nominee if a veto was used. It is also used in specific weeks in Brazil since [[Big Brother Brasil 16]] where the HOH's have to choose which HoH will get 10 thousand [[Brazilian real|reals]] and who is the one that will win immunity.\n\n==== Multiple winners ====\nIn 2011, ''[[Big Brother Africa (season 6)]]'' was the first season of Big Brother to have two winners, each getting US$200,000. In 2015, the [[Pinoy Big Brother: 737|sixth Philippine season]], also had two winners; one from the teens and one from the regular adults. Each of which received PHP1,000,000.\n\n''[[Bigg Boss 8]]'' (India) ended with a twist, where the top five contestants were crowned 'champions'. The season was extended by 35 days (total 135) as a spin-off called ''Bigg Boss: Halla Bol'', where ex-contestants from previous seasons entered the house to compete with the five champions.\n\n==== Reserve housemates ====\nThe [[Pinoy Big Brother: Unlimited|fourth Philippine season]] introduced the concept of having reserved housemates, those of whom are short-listed auditioners who were given a chance to be a housemate by completing tasks assigned by Big Brother. It was eventually done also in the [[Pinoy Big Brother: Otso|eighth Philippine season]] where the reserved housemates were placed in a camp (a separate House but is just adjacent to the Main House) and a that reserved housemate must compete amongst other reserved housemates while gaining points by participating in various tasks, including those that required the participation of doing such tasks outside of the Big Brother House premises. As the eviction was done weekly, once an official housemate is evicted from the Main House, the housemate(s) with the most points earned for that particular week crossovers to the Main House and becomes an official housemate.\n\nThis reserved housemates twist was also used in Argentina's [[Gran Hermano Argentina (season 7)|seventh season]] and Brazil's [[Big Brother Brasil 9|ninth season]].\n\n=== Twists involving multiple franchises ===\n\n==== Housemate exchanges ====\nIn 2002, the [[Big Brother M\u00e9xico|Mexican]] and Spanish editions ([[Big Brother M\u00e9xico#Big Brother 1|BBM1]] and [[Gran Hermano Spain (season 3)|GH3]]) made temporary housemate exchanges. Mexico's Eduardo Orozco swapped with Spain's Andr\u00e9s Barreiro for 7 days. In 2010, the first 2-housemate exchange was held by Spain and [[Grande Fratello|Italy]] ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 11)|GH11]] and [[Grande Fratello (season 10)|GF10]]). Gerardo Prager and Saray Pereira from Spain were swapped with Carmela Gualtieri and Massimo Scattarella of Italy for 7 days.\n\nIn later years, several housemate exchanges were done around the world: [[Argentina]] ([[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 3|GH3]]) and Spain ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 4)|GH4]]), [[Ecuador]] ([[Gran Hermano (Ecuadorian TV series)|GH1]]) and Mexico ([[Big Brother M\u00e9xico#Big Brother 2|BBM2]]), and Africa ([[Big Brother Africa (season 1)|BBA1]]) and United Kingdom ([[Big Brother (UK series 4)|BB4]]) in 2003; [[Scandinavia]] ([[Big Brother (Sweden and Norway)#Season two|BB2]]) and [[Thailand]] ([[Big Brother Thailand (season 2)|BBT2]]) in 2006; [[Philippines]] ([[Pinoy Big Brother (season 2)|PBB2]]) and [[Slovenia]] ([[Big Brother 1 (Slovenia)|BB1]]), and [[Argentina]] ([[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 5|GH5]]) and Spain ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 9)|GH9]]) in 2007; Africa ([[Big Brother Africa (season 3)|BBA3]]) and [[Finland]] ([[Big Brother 2008 (Finland)|BB4]]) in 2008; [[Finland]] ([[Big Brother 2009 (Finland)|BB5]]) and [[Philippines]] ([[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|PBB3]]) in 2009; [[Finland]] ([[Big Brother 2010 (Finland)|BB6]]) and [[Slovenia]] ([[Big Brother Slavnih|BBS1]]) in 2010; Spain ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 12)|GH12]]) and Israel ([[HaAh HaGadol 3|HH3]]) in 2010\u201311; [[Finland]] ([[Big Brother 2011 (Finland)|BB7]]) and [[Norway]] ([[Big Brother Norway#Big Brother 4|BB4]]) in 2011; [[Argentina]] ([[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 7|GH7]]) and Israel ([[HaAh HaGadol 4|HH4]]) in 2012; and Mexico ([[Big Brother M\u00e9xico 2015 (Season 4)|BB4]]) and Spain ([[Gran Hermano 16 (Spain)|GH16]]) in 2015; Spain ([[Gran Hermano Spain (VIP Season 5)|GHVIP5]]) and Brazil ([[Big Brother Brasil 17|BBB17]]) in 2017.\n\n==== Evicted housemate exchanges ====\nIn 2003, Mexico's Isabel Madow ([[Big Brother M\u00e9xico#Big Brother VIP 2|BB VIP2]]) and Spain's A\u00edda N\u00edzar ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 5)|GH5]]) were swapped for 7 days. This twist was also done between Russia ([[Big Brother (Russia)|BBR1]]) and Pacific (GHP1) in 2005, and Argentina ([[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 4|GH4]]) and Brazil ([[Big Brother Brasil 7|BBB7]]) in 2007.\n\n==== Other exchanges ====\nIn 2009, as part of the casting process for Italy's [[Grande Fratello Season 9|GF9]], Doroti Polito and Leonia Coccia visited Spain's [[Gran Hermano Spain (season 10)|GH10]].\n\nIn 2012, four contestants from Denmark's [[Big Brother 4 (Denmark)|BB4]] visited Sweden's [[Big Brother 2012 (Sweden)|BB6]] and competed in a Viking-themed challenge. The Danish team won and 'kidnapped' Swedish contestant Annica Englund to the Denmark house for the following week.\n\nIn 2012, evicted housemate Laisa Portella of Brazil (from [[Big Brother Brasil 12|BBB12]]) was a guest on Spain's ''[[Gran Hermano 13 (Spain)|Gran Hermano 13]]'' for a week; the following week, non-evicted Noem\u00ed Merino of GH13 stayed in the Brazilian Big Brother house for 5 days.\n\nIn 2016, ''[[Big Brother UK]]'' housemate [[Nikki Grahame]] and ''[[Big Brother (Australian TV series)|Big Brother Australia]]'' housemate Tim Dormer were voted in by Canada to be houseguests on the 4th season of ''[[Big Brother Canada]]''. Similarly, ''[[Big Brother UK]]'' housemate [[Jade Goody]] appeared as a housemate on [[Bigg Boss]] India.\n\n''Big Brother Australia'' (2015) contestant Priya Malik joined ''Bigg Boss 9'' (India) the same year as a wild card.\n\nIn 2017, [[Gran Hermano VIP (season 5)|GHVIP5]] contestant Elettra Lamborghini visited Brazil's [[Big Brother Brasil 17|BBB17]].\n\nIn 2019, the winner of Italy's [[Grande Fratello (season 15)|GF15]], Alberto Mezzetti visited Brazil's [[Big Brother Brasil 19|BBB19]].\n\n==== Evicted housemate visits ====\nAnouska Golebiewski, an evicted housemate from the United Kingdom (housemate from [[Big Brother (British series 4)|BB4]]) visited Australia ([[Big Brother (Australian season 3)|BB3]]) in 2003. In 2005, United Kingdom (Nadia Almada of [[Big Brother (British series 5)|BB5]]) visited Australia ([[Big Brother (Australian season 5)|BB5]]) again. In 2006, United Kingdom ([[Chantelle Houghton]] of [[Celebrity Big Brother (British series 4)|CBB4]]) visited Germany ([[Big Brother Germany (season 6)|BBG6]]). This twist was used in later years by other countries: Africa (Ricardo Ferreira of [[Big Brother Africa (season 3)|BBA3]]) visited Brazil ([[Big Brother Brasil 9|BBB9]]) in 2009; Germany (Annina Ucatis and Sascha Schwan of [[Big Brother Germany (season 9)|BBG9]]) visited the Philippines ([[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|PBB3]]), and Italy (George Leonard and Veronica Ciardi of [[Grande Fratello Season 10|GF10]]) visited Albania ([[Big Brother 3 (Albania)|BB3]]) in 2010; Sweden (Martin Granetoft and Peter OrrmyrSara Jonsson of [[Big Brother 2011 (Sweden)|BB5]]) visited Norway ([[Big Brother Norway#Big Brother 4|BB4]]) in 2011; Brazil (Rafael Cordeiro of [[Big Brother Brasil 12|BBB12]]) visited Spain ([[Gran Hermano 12 (Spain)|GH12]]), and Argentina (Agust\u00edn Belforte of [[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 4|GH4]]) visited Colombia ([[Gran Hermano 2 (Colombia)|GH2]]) in 2012; United States (Dan Gheesling of [[Big Brother 10 (U.S.)|BB10]]/[[Big Brother 14 (U.S.)|BB14]]) visited Canada ([[Big Brother 1 (Canada)|BB1]] and the [[Big Brother 2 (Canada)|BB2]] Jury) in 2013; Canada (Emmett Blois of [[Big Brother 1 (Canada)|BB1]]) visited South Africa ([[Big Brother Mzansi 3 (South Africa)|BBM3]]) in 2014; and Spain (Paula Gonzalez of [[Gran Hermano 15 (Spain)|GH 15]]) visited Mexico ([[Big Brother M\u00e9xico 2015 (Season 4)|BBM4]]) in 2015.\n\nA similar event took place between the United States and Canada in 2014 wherein [[Rachel Reilly]] (from [[Big Brother 12 (U.S.)|BB12]]/[[Big Brother 13 (U.S.)|BB13]]) made a video chat to Canada ([[Big Brother 2 (Canada)|BB2]]). Rachel Reilly also appeared on ''Big Brother Canada''{{'}}s side show, which airs after the eviction episode.\n\n==== Housemates competing in another country ====\nThere were occasions that a former housemate from one franchise participated and competed in a different franchise: Daniela Martins of France (SS3) competed in Portugal (SS1); Daniel Mkongo of France (SS5) competed in Italy (GF12); [[Brigitte Nielsen]] of Denmark (BB VIP) competed in the United Kingdom (CBB3); [[Jade Goody]] of the United Kingdom (BB3, BB Panto, and CBB5) competed in India ([[Bigg Boss 2|BB2]]); Sava Radovi\u0107 of Germany (BB4) competed in the [[Balkan States]] (VB1); Nikola Nasteski of the Balkan States (VB4) competed in Bulgaria (BB All-Stars 1); \u017darko Stojanovi\u0107 of France ([[Secret Story 5 (France)|SS5]]) competed in the Balkan States ([[Veliki Brat VIP 5|VB VIP5]]); \u017deljko Stojanovi\u0107 of France ([[Secret Story 5 (France)|SS5]]) competed in the Balkan States ([[Veliki Brat VIP 5|VB VIP5]]); Kelly Baron of Brazil ([[Big Brother Brasil 13|BBB13]]) competed in Portugal ([[Big Brother VIP (Portugal)|BB VIP]]); [[Lucy Diakovska]] of Bulgaria ([[VIP Brother 4|VIP B4]]) competed in Germany ([[Promi Big Brother (season 1)|PBB1]]); Leila Ben Khalifa of Italy ([[Grande Fratello (season 6)|GF6]]) competed in France ([[Secret Story 8 (France)|SS8]]); Priya Malik of Australia ([[Big Brother 11 (Australia)|BB11]]) competed in India ([[Bigg Boss 9|BB9]]); Tim Dormer of Australia ([[Big Brother 10 (Australia)|BB10]]) and [[Nikki Grahame]] of the United Kingdom ([[Big Brother (UK series 7)|BB7]], [[Ultimate Big Brother|UBB]]) competed in Canada ([[Big Brother Canada (season 4)|BB4]]); Leonel Estevao-Luto of Africa ([[Big Brother Africa (season 4)|BB4]]) competed in Angola & Mozambique ([[Big Brother Angola & Mozambique|BB3]]); [[Frankie Grande]] of the United States ([[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)|BB16]]) competed in the United Kingdom ([[Celebrity Big Brother (UK series 18)|CBB18]]); Fanny Rodrigues of Portugal ([[Secret Story 2 (Portugal)|SS2]]) competed in France ([[Secret Story 10 (France)|SS10]]); and Tucha Anita of Angola ([[Big Brother Angola & Mozambique|BB3]]); Amor Romeira of Spain ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 9)|GH9]]) competed in Portugal ([[Secret Story 6 (Portugal)|SS6]]) and Alain Rochette of Spain ([[Gran Hermano 17 (Spain)|GH17]]) competed in France ([[Secret Story 11 (France)|SS11]]); Despite being American, [[Brandi Glanville]] competed first in the United Kingdom ([[Celebrity Big Brother (UK series 20)|CBB20]]) then later competed in first Celebrity series in the United States ([[Celebrity Big Brother 1 (U.S.)|CBB1]]); A\u00edda Nizar of Spain ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 5)|GH5]] and [[Gran Hermano VIP 5|GHVIP5]]) competed in Italy ([[Grande Fratello (season 15)|GF15]]); Ivana Icardi of Argentina ([[Gran Hermano (Argentinian season 9)|GH9]]) competed in Italy ([[Grande Fratello (season 16)|GF16]]); Giamarco Onestini of Italy ([[Grande Fratello (season 16)|GF16]]) competed in Spain ([[Gran Hermano VIP (season 7)|GHVIP7]]).\n\n=== Multiple-franchise competitions ===\n\n==== Eurovision Song Contest ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:100%; line-height:16px;\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Team and Song\n! colspan=\"4\" | Jury's points\n! colspan=\"5\" | Dates\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Winner\n|-\n!

The rest of the rules are nearly the same as those of the original version.\n\n==== Variations ====\nThe 2006 Netherlands series was entitled ''Hotel Big Brother''. This variation introduced a group of celebrity hoteliers and a Big Boss, who run a hotel and collect money for charity without nominations, evictions or a winner.\n\nAnother variation appeared in the UK in early 2008, entitled ''[[Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack]]''. Instead of being housemates the celebrities became Big Brother himself, creating tasks and holding nominations with the help of Big Brother. The housemates were considered by the producers \"Britain's most exceptional and extraordinary\" 18- to 21-year-olds. The prize for the winner of the series was \u00a350,000.<ref name=\"celebhijack\">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/bb8/news/newsstory.jsp?id=24561|title=BB Celebrity Hijack |website=|publisher=[[Channel 4]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621073443/http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/bb8/news/newsstory.jsp?id=24561|archivedate=21 June 2007|access-date=24 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, ''[[VIP Brother 3]] Bulgaria'' introduced the concept of celebrities competing for charitable causes, which changed each week. Housemates were sometimes allowed to leave the house to raise money for the charity. Ten out of Thirteen seasons of ''[[Bigg Boss]]'' (the Indian version of ''Big Brother'') have been celebrity-only seasons. The 10th season of ''Big Boss'' had celebrities put up against commoners, where a commoner ultimately won.\n\n=== American format===\n{{Details|topic=these Big Brother versions|Big Brother (American TV series)|Big Brother Canada}} \nThe US and Canadian versions of ''Big Brother'' differ from most global versions of the series. The US series began in 2000 with the original Dutch format\u2014i.e., housemates, or HouseGuests, as they are styled in the US, nominating each other for eviction and the public voting on evictions and the eventual winner. But due to both poor ratings and the concurrent popularity of ''[[Survivor (American TV series)|Survivor]]'', a gameplay-oriented format was introduced in the [[Survivor (American TV series)|second season]], with HouseGuests allowed to strategize, politic and form alliances to survive eviction, with evictions being determined by a house vote.\n\nEach week the HouseGuests compete in several competitions in order to win power and safety inside the house, before voting off one of the HouseGuests on during the eviction. The main elements of the format are as follows:\n*'''Head of Household (HoH):''' At the start of each week in the house, the HouseGuests compete for the title of Head of Household, often shortened to simply HoH.<ref name=\"format-ep1\">{{cite episode |title=Episode One |series=Big Brother 12 |serieslink=Big Brother (U.S.) |network=CBS |airdate=July 8, 2010 |minutes=00:25 |season=12 |number=1}}</ref> The Head of Household for each week is given luxuries such as their own personal bedroom and the use of an [[MP3 player]], but is responsible for nominating two of their fellow HouseGuests for eviction. The Head of Household would not be able to compete in the following week's Head of Household competition; this excludes the final Head of Household competition of the season.<ref name=\"Pickard\">{{cite news |last=Pickard |first=Ann |title=Why is Big Brother so big in the US? |work=Guardian.co.uk |date=August 19, 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2009/aug/19/why-big-brother-big-us |accessdate=May 25, 2010 |location=London}}</ref><ref name=\"format-ep2\">{{cite episode |title=Episode Two |series=Big Brother 11 |serieslink=Big Brother (U.S.) |network=CBS |airdate=July 12, 2009 |minutes=35:57 |season=11 |number=1}}</ref><ref name=\"format-ep3\">{{cite episode |title=Episode Three |series=Big Brother 11 |serieslink=Big Brother (U.S.) |network=CBS |airdate=July 14, 2009 |minutes=39:20 |season=11 |number=1}}</ref>\n*'''Power of Veto (PoV):'''  After the nominees are determined, the Power of Veto competition is played, with the winner receiving the Power of Veto. If a HouseGuest chooses to exercise the Power of Veto, the Head of Household is responsible for naming a replacement nominee.<ref name=veto>http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bbcan/features/0301/how-big-brother-canada-works-usa-america</ref> The holder of the Power of Veto is save from being nominated as the replacement nominee.<ref>http://www.tvguide.com/news/big-brother-dumbest-moves-ever/</ref> Only six of the HouseGuests compete for the Power of Veto each week; the Head of Household and both nominations compete, as well as three others selected by a random draw. The PoV was introduced in the third American season\n*'''Eviction:''' On eviction night, all HouseGuests must vote to evict one of the nominees, with the exception of the nominees and the Head of Household. The eviction vote is by [[secret ballot]], with HouseGuests casting their votes orally in the Diary Room. In the event of a tied vote, the Head of Household will cast a tie-breaking vote publicly. The nominee with the majority of the votes is evicted from the house.<ref name=\"format-ep4\">{{cite episode |title=Episode Four |series=Big Brother 11 |serieslink=Big Brother (U.S.) |network=CBS |airdate=July 16, 2009 |minutes=33:20 |season=11 |number=1}}</ref>\n\nBefore the sixteenth US season, HouseGuests competed in a Have/Have-Not challenge similar to the shopping tasks on ''Big Brother UK'' and other international editions. The winners become Haves and enjoy luxury foods, while Have-Nots, who must eat \"slop\" (a fortified oatmeal), sleep in designated uncomfortable beds and take cold showers. In later seasons, the Haves & Have-Nots are determined either by the HoH themself or by the HoH Competition.\n\nWhen only two contestants remain, a jury formed of the most recently evicted HouseGuests (generally seven or nine) votes which of the two finalists wins the grand prize. Beginning in the fourth (2003) US season, jury members were sequestered off-site so that they would not be privy to the day-to-day goings-on in the house. (''Celebrity Big Brother US'' does not currently sequester its jury members\u2014all evicted celebrity HouseGuests vote on the winner.).<ref>{{cite web |last=Powell |first=John |title='Big Brother' twist unveiled |work=JAM!

Once only two HouseGuests remain, the members of the jury cast their votes for who should win the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2012/09/20/big-brother-14-finale-episode-breakdown-ian-quacks-to-500k/|title='Big Brother' 14 Finale Episode Breakdown: Ian Quacks To 500K \u00ab CBS Detroit|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, US and Canadian ''Big Brother'' do not air a live launch show, as is customary in international editions\u2014by the time the network show and live online feeds begin airing, it is not uncommon for at least one HouseGuest to already have been evicted. Also, the North American editions currently air only three times a week, compared with daily or six days a week for the recently cancelled UK franchise. As a result, the TV episodes focus primarily on the main events regarding the gameplay and politics versus the day-to-day goings-on in the house; to see the latter, watching the live feeds is necessary.\n\nIn 2013, English-speaking Canada introduced its own version of the show on the cable channel [[Slice (TV channel)|Slice]]; the series moved to [[Global TV]] for its third (2015) season. The show followed the US format, but with more elaborate twists and greater viewer participation in the game. Secret tasks were introduced, usually presented by the show's mascot, \"Marsha the Moose\"; also, as in most global franchises, Big Brother was a distinct character who interacted with the HouseGuests. The [[Big Brother (Quebecer TV series)|French Canadian version]] mostly followed the US/Anglophone Canadian format, but the public could evict a housemate on some occasions and decided the winner.\n\n''[[Big Brother Brasil]]'' combines the US/Canada and international formats. Brazil votes on evictions and the winner, but housemates compete for HoH, Power of Immunity, and Power of Veto; there is also a weekly shopping competition. HoH nominates one housemate for eviction, while the rest of the house nominates a second housemate. The winner of the Power of Immunity competition gets to choose someone to be safe from nomination. \n\nThe pilot for ''[[Big Brother China: Pilot Season|Big Brother China]]'', which premiered exclusively online in 2015, had housemates voting on evictions but the public voting for the winner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/cbb16/news/1121/big-brother-china-pilot-season-premieres-online-youku-tudou-housemates-lets-stay-together-india-house-bigg-boss|title=Big Brother China launches with twelve-day 'pilot series'|last=bbspy}}</ref> The same format was used for ''[[Big Brother: Over the Top]]'', an online-only spinoff of the US series that ran in 2016.\n\nThe 2020 revival of the Australia ''Big Brother series'' series is also rumoured to adopt the American format \u2013 having previously used the original international format.\n\n=== Other editions ===\nThe ''Big Brother'' format has been otherwise modified in some countries:\n* ''Big Brother: All-Stars'' (Belgium, 21 days; [[Bulgaria]]: Season 1\u20135, 27\u201329 days; United States, 72 days; United Kingdom, 18 days; [[Loft Story (Canadian TV series)#Season 6|French Canada]], 64 days; Africa, 91 days; Spain, 56 days; [[Portugal]] ''Secret Story'': Season 1\u20134, 22\u201350 days): Previous housemates from previous seasons compete. Belgium was the first country to have an All-Stars season (2003). Bulgaria was the first country to complete 3 All-Stars seasons (2014). Portugal was the first country to complete 4 All-Stars seasons (2015). Portugal was the first country to complete 5 All-Stars seasons (2017). Portugal was the first country to complete 6 All-Stars seasons (2018).\n* ''Big Brother: Reality All-Stars'' (Sweden, 6 days; [[Denmark]], 32 days; Spain, 56 days): Contestants from different reality shows, including ''Big Brother'', compete.\n* ''Big Brother: You Decide / Big Brother: Back in the House / Big Brother: Try Out'' ([[Poland]]: Season 1\u20132, 7\u201313 days; [[Norway]], 9 days; [[Serbia]], 7 days): Housemates, new or old, compete for a spot in the next regular season without nominations or evictions.\n* ''[[Teen Big Brother: The Experiment|Teen Big Brother]]'' (United Kingdom, 10 days; [[Philippines]]: Season 1\u20134, 42\u201391 days): Teenagers 13 and older compete.\n* ''[[Pinoy Big Brother: All In|Big Brother: All In]]'' (Philippines: Season 11,13): A mix of teenagers, regular adults, and celebrities compete in one season. A variation, ''[[Pinoy Big Brother: Lucky 7|Big Brother: Lucky 7]]'' and ''[[Pinoy Big Brother: Otso|Big Brother: Otso]]'', has three to four batch of housemates stay inside until a number for each batch is left, and is joined by other members of other batches to form one new batch.\n* ''[[Secret Story (disambiguation)#Television|Secret Story]]'' (France, [[Lithuania]], [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[Peru]] and [[Albania]]): Each housemate has a secret.\n* ''[[Big Brother Panto (UK)|Big Brother Panto]]'' (United Kingdom, 11 days): Housemates from the previous series spent time in the Big Brother House to perform a [[pantomime]] at the series' end.\n* ''[[Big Brother Germany (season 6)|Big Brother \u2013 The Village]]'' (Germany: Season 6, 363 days): The village had a class system of bosses, assistants and servants, living in separate houses, who competed in mixed teams; winning bosses could promote employees, while losing bosses became servants. Cash prizes were awarded weekly in an ongoing contest.\n* ''[[Big Brother Family]]'' (Bulgaria: 81 days): Whole families entered the house with their spouses, children and relatives. They received a salary for their stay and the winning family received a cash prize, a car and an apartment.\n\nThere are also \"test runs\", with a group of celebrities (or journalists) living in the house for several days to test it. There are occasions where people who have auditioned for the show are also put in the house, most notably in the British edition, where many housemates claim to have met before. These series have been televised in [[Argentina]], Bulgaria, the [[Czech Republic]], Germany, Mexico, the Pacific region, the Philippines and Spain. In some cases, it is not broadcast, but in others, such as the US edition, it is used as a promotional tool.\n\n== Versions ==\n<section begin=\"Big Brother series\" />{{As of|2020|04|04}}, ''Big Brother'' has produced 480 winners in over 55 franchises.\n\n:{{color box|#90EE90}} Currently airing (3) \n:{{color box|#E0B0FF}} An upcoming season (10) \n:{{color box|white}} Status unknown (5) \n:{{color box|#FFC0CB}} No longer airing (36)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;

However, the female housemate was apparently shocked by the claims and informed female housemates that she had not consented to have sex with him.

During their stay the HouseGuests share their thoughts on events and other houseguests inside a private room referred to as the Diary Room.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nickiswift.com/108051/untold-truth-big-brother/ |title=The untold truth of Big Brother |last=Bianco |first=Julia |website=NickiSwift.com |language=en-US |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref> Each week, the HouseGuests compete in several competitions in order to win power and safety inside the house. At the start of each week, the HouseGuests compete in the Head of Household (abbreviated as \"HoH\") competition. The winner of the HoH competition is immune from eviction and will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. The winner of the HoH competition is immune from eviction and will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. Then six HouseGuests are selected to compete in the Power of Veto (abbreviated as \"PoV\") competition: the reigning HoH and the nominees are guaranteed to play with the remaining slots being given to other HouseGuests selected by random draw. The winner of the PoV competition wins the right to either revoke the nomination of one of the nominated HouseGuests or leave them as is. If the veto winner uses this power, the HoH must immediately nominate another HouseGuest for eviction. The PoV winner is also immune from being named as the replacement nominee. \n\nOn eviction night, all HouseGuests must vote to evict one of the nominees, with the exception of the nominees and the Head of Household. This compulsory vote is conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room. In the event of a tie the Head of Household will cast the tie-breaking vote in front of all the HouseGuests in the living room. The nominee with the most votes is evicted from the house. The last nine evicted HouseGuests, referred to as the Jury, are sequestered in a separate house following their eviction and ultimately decide the winner of the season. The Jury are not allowed  to watch the show except for competitions and ceremonies that include all of the remaining HouseGuests. They are not shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that may include strategy or details regarding nominations. The viewing public is able to award an additional prize of $25,000 to their favorite HouseGuest of the season. All evicted HouseGuests are eligible to win this award except for those who either voluntary leave or forcibly removed for rule-breaking.\n\n== HouseGuests ==\n{{main|List of Big Brother 21 (American season) houseguests}} {{see also|List of Big Brother (American TV series) houseguests}}\n[[File:Big_Brother_21_Cast_Photo.jpg|thumb|500px|right|<center>'''The cast of the twenty-first season of ''Big Brother'''''</center><hr />'''Top:''' Jackson, Jessica, Cliff, Sam, and Nick<hr />'''Middle:''' Holly, Kemi, Ovi, Isabella, Nicole, Kathryn, Christie, and Tommy<hr />'''Bottom:'''Jack, Analyse, and David]]\n\nOn June 10, 2019, CBS reported that the cast would be revealed on June 17, 2019 on ''Big Brother'' live feeds to viewers with a [[CBS All Access]] subscription.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/official-heres-season-21-cast-220000959.html|title=It's Official: Here's When the Season 21 Cast of Big Brother Will Be Revealed|last=Jean-Philippe|first=McKenzie|date=June 10, 2019|accessdate=June 10, 2019|work=[[Yahoo!

The HouseGuests were told that the Camp Director would receive Immunity for the first week but would have to put the games of other HouseGuests in jeopardy. Michie was elected as Camp Director. He was tasked with \"banishing\" four HouseGuests, who would compete to stay in the house. Michie chose to banish Cliff, David, Jessica and Kemi. David lost the competition. As he was immune, Michie was ineligible to compete in the first Head of Household Competition.\n* {{note|2|Note 2}}: {{Color box|#87CEFA|border=darkgray}} On Day 15, ''Camp Comeback'' was introduced. David returned to the house from sequester and the next three evicted HouseGuests (Ovi, Kemi and Cliff) remained in the house after getting voted out of the game.

Cliff won the competition, while David, Ovi and Kemi were all evicted.\n* {{note|3|Note 3}}: {{Color box|#FBF373|border=darkgray}} Week 7 featured the ''America's Field Trip'' competition.

For finishing last, Christie was nominated as a third nominee (denoted in '''bold'''). Christie's nomination did not require a replacement if the veto was used to save her.\n* {{note|4|Note 4}}: Week 9 was ''Prank Week'' and featured the ''America's Prankster'' power. America voted for Nick to be ''America's Prankster'' and took half of Holly's Head of Household power by anonymously nominating one HouseGuest at the Nomination Ceremony (denoted in '''bold''') and naming a replacement nominee if the Power of Veto is used on his nominee. Nick was not given immunity with his power and could be nominated by Holly.\n* {{note|5|Note 5}}: This week was a double eviction week. Following Jessica's eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of games\u2014including HoH and Veto competitions and Nomination, Veto and Eviction ceremonies\u2014during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second eviction for the week.\n* {{note|6|Note 6}}: During the finale, the Jury members voted for which finalist should win Big Brother.\n</small>\n\n== Reception ==\n''Big Brother 21'' was criticized negatively by critics and fans due to the HouseGuests' discriminatory tendencies.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dehnart |first1=Andy |title=Big Brother 21 racism and awfulness: an update |url=https://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2019/07/big-brother-21-racism-update-bb21/ |website=realityblurred.com |publisher=Reality Blurred |accessdate=25 October 2019 |date=25 July 2019}}</ref> Professor of African American studies and the UCLA Dean of Social Sciences, Darnell Hunt, stated, \"Race is the central axis of social relationships.

The HouseGuests are sequestered in the ''Big Brother House'' with no contact with the outside world. During their stay the HouseGuests share their thoughts on events and other houseguests inside a private room referred to as the Diary Room.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nickiswift.com/108051/untold-truth-big-brother/ |title=The untold truth of Big Brother |last=Bianco |first=Julia |website=NickiSwift.com |language=en-US |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref> Each week, the HouseGuests compete in several competitions in order to win power and safety inside the house. At the start of each week, the HouseGuests compete in the Head of Household (abbreviated as \"HoH\") competition. The winner of the HoH competition is immune from eviction and will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. The winner of the HoH competition is immune from eviction and will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. Then six HouseGuests are selected to compete in the Power of Veto (abbreviated as \"PoV\") competition: the reigning HoH and the nominees are guaranteed to play with the remaining slots being given to other HouseGuests selected by random draw. The winner of the PoV competition wins the right to either revoke the nomination of one of the nominated HouseGuests or leave them as is. If the veto winner uses this power, the HoH must immediately nominate another HouseGuest for eviction. The PoV winner is also immune from being named as the replacement nominee. \n\nOn eviction night, all HouseGuests must vote to evict one of the nominees, with the exception of the nominees and the Head of Household. This compulsory vote is conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room. In the event of a tie the Head of Household will cast the tie-breaking vote in front of all the HouseGuests in the living room. The nominee with the most votes is evicted from the house. The last nine evicted HouseGuests, referred to as the Jury, are sequestered in a separate house following their eviction and ultimately decide the winner of the season. The Jury are not allowed  to watch the show except for competitions and ceremonies that include all of the remaining HouseGuests. They are not shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that may include strategy or details regarding nominations. The viewing public is able to award an additional prize of $25,000 to their favorite HouseGuest of the season. All evicted HouseGuests are eligible to win this award except for those who either voluntary leave or forcibly removed for rule-breaking.\n\n== HouseGuests ==\n{{main|List of Big Brother 21 (American season) houseguests}} {{see also|List of Big Brother (American TV series) houseguests}}\n[[File:Big_Brother_21_Cast_Photo.jpg|thumb|500px|right|<center>'''The cast of the twenty-first season of ''Big Brother'''''</center><hr />'''Top:''' Jackson, Jessica, Cliff, Sam, and Nick<hr />'''Middle:''' Holly, Kemi, Ovi, Isabella, Nicole, Kathryn, Christie, and Tommy<hr />'''Bottom:'''Jack, Analyse, and David]]\n\nOn June 10, 2019, CBS reported that the cast would be revealed on June 17, 2019 on ''Big Brother'' live feeds to viewers with a [[CBS All Access]] subscription.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/official-heres-season-21-cast-220000959.html|title=It's Official: Here's When the Season 21 Cast of Big Brother Will Be Revealed|last=Jean-Philippe|first=McKenzie|date=June 10, 2019|accessdate=June 10, 2019|work=[[Yahoo!

He was tasked with \"banishing\" four HouseGuests, who would compete to stay in the house. Michie chose to banish Cliff, David, Jessica and Kemi. David lost the competition. As he was immune, Michie was ineligible to compete in the first Head of Household Competition.\n* {{note|2|Note 2}}: {{Color box|#87CEFA|border=darkgray}} On Day 15, ''Camp Comeback'' was introduced. David returned to the house from sequester and the next three evicted HouseGuests (Ovi, Kemi and Cliff) remained in the house after getting voted out of the game.

Christie's nomination did not require a replacement if the veto was used to save her.\n* {{note|4|Note 4}}: Week 9 was ''Prank Week'' and featured the ''America's Prankster'' power. America voted for Nick to be ''America's Prankster'' and took half of Holly's Head of Household power by anonymously nominating one HouseGuest at the Nomination Ceremony (denoted in '''bold''') and naming a replacement nominee if the Power of Veto is used on his nominee. Nick was not given immunity with his power and could be nominated by Holly.\n* {{note|5|Note 5}}: This week was a double eviction week.

The series premiered on [[CBS]] on July 8, 2010 and lasted ten weeks until the live finale on September 15, 2010. The twelfth season saw a slight increase in ratings when compared to the past season of the series. The season premiered to a total of 7.35 million viewers, a slight increase from the previous season's launch and the highest for a premiere episode since ''Big Brother 8''. The season finale had a total of 7.89 million viewers, continuing to average slightly above the past season and the highest since the eight edition. In total, the series averaged 7.76 million viewers, higher than that of the previous two seasons and the highest since ''Big Brother 5'' in 2004. ''Big Brother 12'' was initially set to feature a total of 14 HouseGuests, though one HouseGuest left the show before entering the house and was not replaced. The series ended after 75 days, in which HouseGuest [[Hayden Moss]] was crowned the Winner, while Lane Elenburg was crowned the Runner-Up.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''Big Brother 12'' is produced by [[Endemol#Endemol USA|Endemol USA]] and Fly on the Wall Entertainment with [[Allison Grodner]] and Rich Meehan returning as executive producers.
