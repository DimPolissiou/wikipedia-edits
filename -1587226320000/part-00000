Meanwhile, Anurag's father, Shekhar and Taani's father, Bimlendu were also best friends. Bimlendu had cancer and was worried about Taani's future after his death. To reassure Bimlendu, Shekhar has Anurag marry Taani in a private ceremony, promising a public announcement when they grow older. Uncomfortable at first, they slowly start falling for each other. But after the death of Bimlendu the couple is separated for eight years.\n\n===8 years later===\n\nTaani is still in love with Anurag whereas Anurag now loves his mentor's daughter, Nupur. He feels guilty about Taani and finds her with his friend, Sushant. Anurag-Nupur and Taani-Sushant's engagements are scheduled for the same day, but owing to fate, Sushant leaves Taani, dubious of her feelings for Anurag. On the other hand, Nupur also leaves Anurag for a modelling assignment abroad. To save their families, they get engaged and decide to carry on the charade.\n\nMeanwhile, Taani finds out about Ritesh's intentions but Ananya does not believe her and throws her out. Anurag defends her and walks out to establish himself independent of Shekhar's name. Taani helps him get several opportunities and Anurag gradually realises he loves her. Noticing this, Ananya makes Anurag believe Taani loves her childhood friend, Subodh. So, Anurag banishes her. Saddened, Taani thinks Anurag still loves Nupur and goes to convince her to return. Anurag learns of Taani helping him to find work and bringing back Nupur, and vows to woo her again. When he succeeds, Nupur suddenly returns and threatens suicide before Anurag accepts her in urgency, though he still loves Taani. Finally, in a family function, Anurag declares his love for Taani and proposes to her.\n\nAlso, Shekhar's younger son, Robindo reveals he loves their friend, Mauli, who is in love with Taani's brother, Taposh and manages to make her agree for marriage before she finds out about his illegitimate child and marries Taposh, leaving Robindo heartbroken. It then turns out Ritesh has been cheating on Ananya with an illicit worker, Gulabo. Taani and Anurag reveal this to Ananya who is shattered and meets a fatal accident. She hands over her two children to Taani. When Ritesh falsely accuses Anurag of Gulabo's murder and blackmails Taani into marrying him, Anurag interrupts and finally has him arrested. Eventually Anurag and Taani marry. Robindo marries Jonaki, Mauli's sister, as payback, and later also frames Taposh for a gas leak accident before surrendering due to his love for Mauli.\n\nFollowing this, Anurag and Taani have a happy married life, before Ananya's daughter dies in an accident and Taani succumbs to depression. Anurag plans to take Taani to the US but is almost killed by Ritesh on the way. The family thinks he is dead, but a pregnant Taani refuses to believe so.\n\nAfter he recovers, Anurag comes back only to see Sushant taking care of pregnant Taani. He misinterprets the situation and leaves to retire to a mental asylum. Years later, Taani finds him and he returns home, to be with her again. He also finds out he has a daughter with Taani, and the two finally unite.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Harshad and Anupriya.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Harshad Chopda|Harshad Chopra]] and [[Anupriya Kapoor]] played the lead roles|230px]]\n*[[Harshad Chopda]] as Anurag Shekhar Ganguly (2010\u20132011)\n*[[Anupriya Kapoor]] as Taani Bimlendu Banerjee / Taani Anurag Ganguly (2010\u20132011)\n*[[Neha Saxena (TV actress)|Neha Saxena]] as Mauli Sharma / Mauli Taposh Banerjee\u2013 Robindo's former girlfriend, Taposh's wife (2010\u20132011)\n*[[Shakti Arora]] as Taposh Bimlendu Banerjee\u2013 Taani's brother (2010\u20132011)\n*[[Rajat Tokas]] as Robindo Shekhar Ganguly\u2013 Anurag's brother (2010\u20132011)\n*[[Ruchi Savarn]] as Jonaki Sharma / Jonaki Robindo Ganguly\u2013 Mauli's twin sister, Robindo's wife (2010\u20132011)\n*[[Neha Janpandit]]/[[Reshmi Ghosh]] as Nupur Basu\u2013 Ritesh's sister, Anurag's fianc\u00e9e (2010\u20132011)\n*[[Kali Prasad Mukherjee]] as Shekhar Ganguly\u2013 Anurag's father, Bimlendu's friend (2010\u20132011)\n*[[Geetanjali Tikekar]] as Nilanjana Shekhar Ganguly\u2013 Anurag's mother (2010\u20132011)\n*[[Supriya Shukla]] as Laboni Bimlendu Banerjee\u2013 Taani's mother (2010\u20132011)\n*Virendra Singh as Bimlendu Banerjee\u2013 Taani's father, Shekhar's friend (dead) (2010\u20132011)\n*[[Garima Bhatnagar]] as Ananya Shekhar Ganguly / Ananya Ritesh Basu\u2013 Anurag's sister (dead) (2010\u20132011)\n*[[Nikhil Arya]] as Ritesh Basu\u2013 Nupur's brother, Ananya's husband (dead) (2010\u20132011)\n*[[Aadesh Chaudhary]] as Subodh Bhalla\u2013 Anurag and Taani's childhood friend (2010)\n*[[Anurag Sharma (actor)|Anurag Sharma]] as Sushant Mehra\u2013 Anurag's friend, Taani's fianc\u00e9 (2010, 2011)\n*[[Rithvik Dhanjani]] as Partho Rawal\u2013 Anurag's friend (2010)\n*Sangeeta Kapure as Gulabo\u2013 Ritesh's mistress (2010)\n*Prachi Deshmukh as adolescent Taani (2010)\n*Devarsh Thakkar as adolescent Anurag (2010)\n*[[Meghan Jadhav]] as adolescent Subodh (2010)\n*Kritika Sharma as adolescent Mauli (2010)\n\n==Soundtrack==\n\n{{tracklist\n| extra_column= Singer(s)\n| title1      = Tere Liye\n| note1       = Male Version\n| length1     = 5:11\n| lyrics1     = [[Devendra Kafir]]\n| music1      = [[Sunil Singh]]\n| extra1      = Kailash Kher          \n| title2      = Tere Liye\n| note2       = Female Version\n| length2     = 5:11\n| lyrics2     = Devendra Kafir\n| music2      = Sunil Singh\n| extra2      = Himani Kapoor}}\n\n==Awards==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
