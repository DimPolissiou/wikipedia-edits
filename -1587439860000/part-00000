Two weeks later, Broderick was officially declared the new guitarist for Megadeth.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nAs opposed to many drummers, who cross over their sticks to play the hi-hat with their right hand and snare with their left hand, Shawn instead keeps time with his left hand, keeps a ride cymbal on the left side of his set, and relegates his right hand for snare drum hits (similar to [[Gene Hoglan]] and [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]]). Although the role of each hand is reversed.  This is known as \"[[Open handed drumming]]\". Shawn Drover is himself left-handed.\n\nAs of 2015, Shawn Drover was Megadeth's longest-serving drummer, having been a member of the band for just over 10 years, and had the third-longest tenure in the band after only bass guitarist [[David Ellefson]] and guitarist and frontman Dave Mustaine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Megadeth's Ellefson: Mustaine and I are 'Working Diligently' to Find Replacements for Drover, Broderick|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/megadeths-ellefson-mustaine-and-i-are-working-diligently-to-find-replacements-for-drover-broderick/|website=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=January 11, 2015|date=January 10, 2015}}</ref> On November 25, 2014 Drover announced his departure from Megadeth, wanting to pursue his own musical interests.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kaufman|first1=Spencer|title=DRUMMER SHAWN DROVER EXITS MEGADETH|url=http://loudwire.com/drummer-shawn-drover-exits-megadeth/|website=loudwire.com|publisher=loudwire|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}</ref> Following his departure from Megadeth, Drover teamed up with Chris Broderick, who left Megadeth the same day as him, to form [[Act of Defiance]] with vocalist Henry Derek and bassist [[Matt Bachand]].<ref name=NewBand>{{cite web|title=New Band Featuring Former Megadeth and Scar the Martyr Members Settle on Name|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/new-band-featuring-former-megadeth-and-scar-the-martyr-members-settles-on-name/|website=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=January 11, 2015|date=January 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nHe currently resides near {Atlanta, Georgia},{{citation needed|reason=needs reliable citation which doesn't require a sign on|date=January 2012}} has a wife, a daughter, a son, and grandson.
