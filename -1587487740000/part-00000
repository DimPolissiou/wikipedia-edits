This decision was based on an erroneous belief that the Red Sea was {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} higher than the Mediterranean.

In 1830, [[Francis Rawdon Chesney|F. R. Chesney]] submitted a report to the British government that stated that there was no difference in elevation and that the Suez Canal was feasible, but his report received no further attention. [[Thomas Fletcher Waghorn|Lieutenant Waghorn]] established his \"Overland Route\", which transported post and passengers to India via Egypt. [[Louis Maurice Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds|Linant de Bellefonds]], a French explorer of Egypt, became chief engineer of [[Egyptian Public Works|Egypt's Public Works]]. In addition to his normal duties, he surveyed the [[Isthmus of Suez]] and made plans for the Suez Canal. French [[Saint-Simonianism|Saint-Simonianists]] showed an interest in the canal and in 1833, [[Barth\u00e9lemy Prosper Enfantin]] tried to draw [[Muhammad Ali Pasha|Muhammad Ali's]] attention to the canal but was unsuccessful. [[Alois Negrelli]], the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] railroad pioneer, became interested in the idea in 1836. In 1846, Prosper Enfantin's [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tudes du Canal de Suez]] invited a number of experts, among them [[Robert Stephenson]], Negrelli and [[Paul-Adrien Bourdaloue]] to study the feasibility of the Suez Canal (with the assistance of Linant de Bellefonds). Bourdaloue's survey of the isthmus was the first generally accepted evidence that there was no practical difference in altitude between the two seas. Britain, however, feared that a canal open to everyone might interfere with its [[British Raj|India]] trade and therefore preferred a connection by train from [[Alexandria]] via [[Cairo]] to Suez, which was eventually built by Stephenson.\n\n===Construction by the Suez Canal Company===\n[[File:SuezCanalKantara.jpg|thumb|left|Suez Canal, 1869]]\n\n====Preparations (1854\u20131858)====\nIn 1854 and 1856, [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] obtained a concession from [[Sa'id of Egypt|Sa'id Pasha]], the [[Khedive]] of [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt and Sudan]], to create a company to construct a canal open to ships of all nations. The company was to operate the canal for 99 years from its opening. De Lesseps had used his friendly relationship with Sa'id, which he had developed while he was a French diplomat in the 1830s. As stipulated in the concessions, Ferdinand convened the [[International Commission for the piercing of the isthmus of Suez]] (''Commission Internationale pour le percement de l'isthme des Suez'') consisting of 13 experts from seven countries, among them [[John Robinson McClean]], later President of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] in London, and again Negrelli, to examine the plans developed by [[Louis Maurice Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds|Linant de Bellefonds]], and to advise on the feasibility of and the best route for the canal. After surveys and analyses in Egypt and discussions in Paris on various aspects of the canal, where many of Negrelli's ideas prevailed, the commission produced a unanimous report in December 1856 containing a detailed description of the canal complete with plans and profiles.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/percementdelist00lessgoog/page/n401 <!-- pg=377 --> ''Percement de l'isthme de Suez.

As one of the diplomatic moves against the canal, it disapproved of the use of \"slave labour\" of forced workers. The [[British Empire]] was the major global naval force and officially condemned the forced work and sent armed [[Bedouin]]s to start a revolt among workers. Involuntary labour on the project ceased, and the viceroy condemned the corv\u00e9e, halting the project.<ref>Oster (2006)</ref>\n\nAngered by the British opportunism, de Lesseps sent a letter to the British government remarking on the British lack of remorse a few years earlier when forced workers died in similar conditions building the British railway in Egypt.\n\nInitially international opinion was skeptical and Suez Canal Company shares did not sell well overseas. Britain, [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] did not buy a significant number of shares. However, with assistance from the Cattaui banking family, and their relationship with [[James Mayer de Rothschild|James de Rothschild]] of the [[Rothschild banking family of France|French House of Rothschild]] bonds and shares were successfully promoted in France and other parts of Europe.<ref>There is differing information on the exact amounts</ref> All French shares were quickly sold in France. A contemporary British skeptic claimed \"One thing is sure... our local merchant community doesn't pay practical attention at all to this grand work, and it is legitimate to doubt that the canal's receipts... could ever be sufficient to recover its maintenance fee.

It played an important role in increasing [[European colonization of Africa]]. The construction of the canal was one of the reasons for the [[Panic of 1873]], because goods from the Far East were carried in sailing vessels around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and were stored in British warehouses. An inability to pay his bank debts led Said Pasha's successor, [[Isma'il Pasha]], in 1875 to sell his 44% share in the canal for \u00a34,000,000 ($19.2 million) equivalent to \u00a3432 million to \u00a3456 million ($540 million to $570 million) to the government of the United Kingdom.<ref>(\u00a31 in 1875 = \u00a3109\u2013114; 2019 Historical Uk Inflation Rates and Calculator; UK Inflation (CPI) Calculator - What's the Cost)</ref> French shareholders still held the majority.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 24429312|title = Disraeli, Derby and the Suez Canal, 1875: Some Myths Reassessed|journal = History|volume = 97|issue = 2 (326)|pages = 182\u2013203|last1 = Hicks|first1 = Geoffrey|year = 2012|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-229X.2012.00548.x}}</ref>  Local unrest caused the British to invade in 1882 and take full control, although nominally Egypt remained part of the Ottoman Empire.

The revolt went on from 1879 to 1882. As a result of British involvement on the side of Khedive Tewfiq, Britain gained control of the canal in 1882. The British defended the strategically important passage against a major [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[First Suez Offensive|attack]] in 1915, during the [[First World War]].<ref name=\"FWW87\">''First World War'' \u2013 Willmott, H.P.

According to the pre-agreed war plans under the [[Protocol of S\u00e8vres]], Israel invaded the [[Sinai Peninsula]] on 29 October, forcing Egypt to engage them militarily, and allowing the [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Anglo-French]] partnership to declare the resultant fighting a threat to stability in the Middle East and enter the war \u2013 officially to separate the two forces but in reality to regain the Canal and bring down the Nasser government. {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2019}}\n\nTo save the British from what he thought was a disastrous action and to stop the war from a possible escalation, Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs [[Lester B. Pearson]] proposed the creation of the first United Nations peacekeeping force to ensure access to the canal for all and an Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula. On 4 November 1956, a majority at the United Nations voted for Pearson's peacekeeping resolution, which [[Mandate (international law)|mandated]] the UN peacekeepers to stay in Sinai unless both Egypt and Israel agreed to their withdrawal. The United States backed this proposal by putting pressure on the British government through the selling of [[Pound sterling|sterling]], which would cause it to depreciate. Britain then called a ceasefire, and later agreed to withdraw its troops by the end of the year. Pearson was later awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. As a result of damage and ships sunk under orders from Nasser the canal was closed until April 1957, when it was cleared with UN assistance.<ref>''The Other Side of Suez'' (documentary) \u2013 2003</ref> A UN force ([[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF]]) was established to maintain the free navigability of the canal, and peace in the Sinai Peninsula.\n\n===Arab\u2013Israeli wars of 1967 and 1973===\n[[File:Egyptianbridge.jpg|thumb|Egyptian vehicles crossing the Suez Canal on 7 October 1973, during the [[Yom Kippur War]]]]\n[[File:Israeli Tanks Cross the Suez Canal - Flickr - Israel Defense Forces.jpg|thumb|Israeli tank crossing the Suez Canal, 1973]]\n\nIn May 1967, Nasser ordered the UN peacekeeping forces out of Sinai, including the Suez Canal area. Israel objected to the closing of the [[Straits of Tiran]] to Israeli shipping. The canal had been closed to Israeli shipping since 1949, except for a short period in 1951\u20131952.\n\nAfter the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Israeli forces occupied the Sinai peninsula, including the entire east bank of the Suez Canal. Unwilling to allow the Israelis to use the canal, Egypt immediately imposed a blockade which closed the canal to all shipping. Fifteen cargo ships, known as the \"[[Yellow Fleet]]\", were trapped in the canal, and would remain there until 1975.\n\nIn 1973, during the [[Yom Kippur War]], the canal was the scene of [[Operation Badr (1973)|a major crossing]] by the Egyptian army into Israeli-occupied Sinai and a counter-crossing by the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli army]] to Egypt.

The current south of the Bitter Lakes is tidal, varying with the tide at Suez.<ref name=rsp/> The Bitter Lakes, which were hypersaline natural lakes, blocked the migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalised with that of the Red Sea the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonise the eastern Mediterranean.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe Red Sea is generally saltier and more nutrient-poor than the [[Atlantic]], so the Red Sea species have advantages over Atlantic species in the less salty and nutrient-rich eastern Mediterranean. Accordingly, most Red Sea species invade the Mediterranean biota, and only few do the opposite. This migratory phenomenon is called [[Lessepsian migration]] (after Ferdinand de Lesseps) or \"Erythrean invasion\". Also impacting the eastern Mediterranean, starting in 1968, was the operation of [[Aswan High Dam]] across the Nile. While providing for increased human development, the project reduced the inflow of freshwater and ended all natural nutrient-rich silt entering the eastern Mediterranean at the [[Nile Delta]]. This provided less natural dilution of Mediterranean salinity and ended the higher levels of natural [[turbidity]], additionally making conditions more like those in the Red Sea.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nInvasive species originating from the Red Sea and [[introduced species|introduced]] into the Mediterranean by the canal have become a major component of the Mediterranean ecosystem and have serious impacts on the ecology, endangering many local and [[endemism|endemic]] species. About 300 species from the Red Sea have been identified in the Mediterranean, and there are probably others yet unidentified. The Egyptian government's intent to enlarge the canal has raised concerns from [[marine biologist]]s, fearing that this will worsen the invasion of Red Sea species.<ref>Galil and Zenetos (2002)</ref>\n\nConstruction of the canal was preceded by cutting a small fresh-water canal called [[Sweet Water Canal]] from [[Nile Delta|the Nile delta]] along [[Wadi Tumilat]] to the future canal, with a southern branch to Suez and a northern branch to Port Said.

In 1830, [[Francis Rawdon Chesney|F. R. Chesney]] submitted a report to the British government that stated that there was no difference in elevation and that the Suez Canal was feasible, but his report received no further attention. [[Thomas Fletcher Waghorn|Lieutenant Waghorn]] established his \"Overland Route\", which transported post and passengers to India via Egypt. [[Louis Maurice Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds|Linant de Bellefonds]], a French explorer of Egypt, became chief engineer of [[Egyptian Public Works|Egypt's Public Works]]. In addition to his normal duties, he surveyed the [[Isthmus of Suez]] and made plans for the Suez Canal. French [[Saint-Simonianism|Saint-Simonianists]] showed an interest in the canal and in 1833, [[Barth\u00e9lemy Prosper Enfantin]] tried to draw [[Muhammad Ali Pasha|Muhammad Ali's]] attention to the canal but was unsuccessful. [[Alois Negrelli]], the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] railroad pioneer, became interested in the idea in 1836. In 1846, Prosper Enfantin's [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tudes du Canal de Suez]] invited a number of experts, among them [[Robert Stephenson]], Negrelli and [[Paul-Adrien Bourdaloue]] to study the feasibility of the Suez Canal (with the assistance of Linant de Bellefonds). Bourdaloue's survey of the isthmus was the first generally accepted evidence that there was no practical difference in altitude between the two seas. Britain, however, feared that a canal open to everyone might interfere with its [[British Raj|India]] trade and therefore preferred a connection by train from [[Alexandria]] via [[Cairo]] to Suez, which was eventually built by Stephenson.\n\n===Construction by the Suez Canal Company===\n[[File:SuezCanalKantara.jpg|thumb|left|Suez Canal, 1869]]\n\n====Preparations (1854\u20131858)====\nIn 1854 and 1856, [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] obtained a concession from [[Sa'id of Egypt|Sa'id Pasha]], the [[Khedive]] of [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt and Sudan]], to create a company to construct a canal open to ships of all nations. The company was to operate the canal for 99 years from its opening. De Lesseps had used his friendly relationship with Sa'id, which he had developed while he was a French diplomat in the 1830s. As stipulated in the concessions, Ferdinand convened the [[International Commission for the piercing of the isthmus of Suez]] (''Commission Internationale pour le percement de l'isthme des Suez'') consisting of 13 experts from seven countries, among them [[John Robinson McClean]], later President of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] in London, and again Negrelli, to examine the plans developed by [[Louis Maurice Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds|Linant de Bellefonds]], and to advise on the feasibility of and the best route for the canal. After surveys and analyses in Egypt and discussions in Paris on various aspects of the canal, where many of Negrelli's ideas prevailed, the commission produced a unanimous report in December 1856 containing a detailed description of the canal complete with plans and profiles.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/percementdelist00lessgoog/page/n401 <!-- pg=377 --> ''Percement de l'isthme de Suez.

As one of the diplomatic moves against the canal, it disapproved of the use of \"slave labour\" of forced workers. The [[British Empire]] was the major global naval force and officially condemned the forced work and sent armed [[Bedouin]]s to start a revolt among workers. Involuntary labour on the project ceased, and the viceroy condemned the corv\u00e9e, halting the project.<ref>Oster (2006)</ref>\n\nAngered by the British opportunism, de Lesseps sent a letter to the British government remarking on the British lack of remorse a few years earlier when forced workers died in similar conditions building the British railway in Egypt.\n\nInitially international opinion was skeptical and Suez Canal Company shares did not sell well overseas. Britain, [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] did not buy a significant number of shares.

The remaining works were completed only in 1871, and traffic was below expectations in the first two years. De Lesseps therefore tried to increase revenues by interpreting the kind of net ton referred to in the second concession (''tonneau de capacit\u00e9'') as meaning a ship's cargo capacity and not only the theoretical [[net tonnage]] of the \"[[Moorsom System]]\" introduced in Britain by the Merchant Shipping Act in 1854. The ensuing commercial and diplomatic activities resulted in the International Commission of Constantinople establishing a specific kind of net tonnage and settling the question of tariffs in its protocol of 18 December 1873.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/documentsdiplom21trgoog#page/n125/mode/1up Protocol of the Commission] (in Ffrench)</ref> This was the origin of the [[Net Register Tonnage|Suez Canal Net Tonnage]] and the [[Net Register Tonnage|Suez Canal Special Tonnage Certificate]], both of which are still in use today.\n\n=== Company rule after opening ===\n[[File:Suez Canal (ca 1914).jpg|thumb|upright|Suez Canal, c. 1914]]\n\nThe canal had an immediate and dramatic effect on [[Global trade|world trade]]. Combined with the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|American transcontinental railroad]] completed six months earlier, it allowed the world to be circled in record time. It played an important role in increasing [[European colonization of Africa]]. The construction of the canal was one of the reasons for the [[Panic of 1873]], because goods from the Far East were carried in sailing vessels around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and were stored in British warehouses. An inability to pay his bank debts led Said Pasha's successor, [[Isma'il Pasha]], in 1875 to sell his 44% share in the canal for \u00a34,000,000 ($19.2 million) equivalent to \u00a3432 million to \u00a3456 million ($540 million to $570 million) to the government of the United Kingdom.<ref>(\u00a31 in 1875 = \u00a3109\u2013114; 2019 Historical Uk Inflation Rates and Calculator; UK Inflation (CPI) Calculator - What's the Cost)</ref> French shareholders still held the majority.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 24429312|title = Disraeli, Derby and the Suez Canal, 1875: Some Myths Reassessed|journal = History|volume = 97|issue = 2 (326)|pages = 182\u2013203|last1 = Hicks|first1 = Geoffrey|year = 2012|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-229X.2012.00548.x}}</ref>  Local unrest caused the British to invade in 1882 and take full control, although nominally Egypt remained part of the Ottoman Empire.

The revolt went on from 1879 to 1882. As a result of British involvement on the side of Khedive Tewfiq, Britain gained control of the canal in 1882. The British defended the strategically important passage against a major [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[First Suez Offensive|attack]] in 1915, during the [[First World War]].<ref name=\"FWW87\">''First World War'' \u2013 Willmott, H.P. [[Dorling Kindersley]], 2003, Page 87</ref> Under the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]], the UK retained control over the canal. The canal was again strategically important in the 1939\u20131945 [[Second World War]], and Italo-German attempts to capture it were repulsed during the [[North Africa Campaign]], during which the canal was closed to [[Axis powers|Axis]] shipping.  In 1951 Egypt repudiated the treaty and in October 1954 the UK agreed to remove its troops.

According to the pre-agreed war plans under the [[Protocol of S\u00e8vres]], Israel invaded the [[Sinai Peninsula]] on 29 October, forcing Egypt to engage them militarily, and allowing the [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Anglo-French]] partnership to declare the resultant fighting a threat to stability in the Middle East and enter the war \u2013 officially to separate the two forces but in reality to regain the Canal and bring down the Nasser government. {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2019}}\n\nTo save the British from what he thought was a disastrous action and to stop the war from a possible escalation, Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs [[Lester B. Pearson]] proposed the creation of the first United Nations peacekeeping force to ensure access to the canal for all and an Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula. On 4 November 1956, a majority at the United Nations voted for Pearson's peacekeeping resolution, which [[Mandate (international law)|mandated]] the UN peacekeepers to stay in Sinai unless both Egypt and Israel agreed to their withdrawal. The United States backed this proposal by putting pressure on the British government through the selling of [[Pound sterling|sterling]], which would cause it to depreciate. Britain then called a ceasefire, and later agreed to withdraw its troops by the end of the year. Pearson was later awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. As a result of damage and ships sunk under orders from Nasser the canal was closed until April 1957, when it was cleared with UN assistance.<ref>''The Other Side of Suez'' (documentary) \u2013 2003</ref> A UN force ([[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF]]) was established to maintain the free navigability of the canal, and peace in the Sinai Peninsula.\n\n===Arab\u2013Israeli wars of 1967 and 1973===\n[[File:Egyptianbridge.jpg|thumb|Egyptian vehicles crossing the Suez Canal on 7 October 1973, during the [[Yom Kippur War]]]]\n[[File:Israeli Tanks Cross the Suez Canal - Flickr - Israel Defense Forces.jpg|thumb|Israeli tank crossing the Suez Canal, 1973]]\n\nIn May 1967, Nasser ordered the UN peacekeeping forces out of Sinai, including the Suez Canal area. Israel objected to the closing of the [[Straits of Tiran]] to Israeli shipping. The canal had been closed to Israeli shipping since 1949, except for a short period in 1951\u20131952.\n\nAfter the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Israeli forces occupied the Sinai peninsula, including the entire east bank of the Suez Canal. Unwilling to allow the Israelis to use the canal, Egypt immediately imposed a blockade which closed the canal to all shipping. Fifteen cargo ships, known as the \"[[Yellow Fleet]]\", were trapped in the canal, and would remain there until 1975.\n\nIn 1973, during the [[Yom Kippur War]], the canal was the scene of [[Operation Badr (1973)|a major crossing]] by the Egyptian army into Israeli-occupied Sinai and a counter-crossing by the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli army]] to Egypt.

The current south of the Bitter Lakes is tidal, varying with the tide at Suez.<ref name=rsp/> The Bitter Lakes, which were hypersaline natural lakes, blocked the migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalised with that of the Red Sea the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonise the eastern Mediterranean.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe Red Sea is generally saltier and more nutrient-poor than the [[Atlantic]], so the Red Sea species have advantages over Atlantic species in the less salty and nutrient-rich eastern Mediterranean. Accordingly, most Red Sea species invade the Mediterranean biota, and only few do the opposite. This migratory phenomenon is called [[Lessepsian migration]] (after Ferdinand de Lesseps) or \"Erythrean invasion\". Also impacting the eastern Mediterranean, starting in 1968, was the operation of [[Aswan High Dam]] across the Nile. While providing for increased human development, the project reduced the inflow of freshwater and ended all natural nutrient-rich silt entering the eastern Mediterranean at the [[Nile Delta]]. This provided less natural dilution of Mediterranean salinity and ended the higher levels of natural [[turbidity]], additionally making conditions more like those in the Red Sea.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nInvasive species originating from the Red Sea and [[introduced species|introduced]] into the Mediterranean by the canal have become a major component of the Mediterranean ecosystem and have serious impacts on the ecology, endangering many local and [[endemism|endemic]] species. About 300 species from the Red Sea have been identified in the Mediterranean, and there are probably others yet unidentified. The Egyptian government's intent to enlarge the canal has raised concerns from [[marine biologist]]s, fearing that this will worsen the invasion of Red Sea species.<ref>Galil and Zenetos (2002)</ref>\n\nConstruction of the canal was preceded by cutting a small fresh-water canal called [[Sweet Water Canal]] from [[Nile Delta|the Nile delta]] along [[Wadi Tumilat]] to the future canal, with a southern branch to Suez and a northern branch to Port Said.

One of his greatest moments was being part of [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]'s squad, as he helped the team win the [[UEFA Champions League]] in [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|2005\u201306]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Early life===\nLudovic Giuly was immersed in the world of football from an early age since his father, Dominique Giuly, born in the village of [[Zalana]], in [[Corsica]], was a former goalkeeper, who played briefly in professional football for [[SC Bastia|Bastia]] before continuing an amateur career until the age of 32 with several clubs in the suburbs of [[Lyon]]. Ludovic Giuly made his debut in the club in which his father was then active: the ASCMO, now known as [[Monts d'Or Azergues Foot]], in the city of [[Chasselay, Rh\u00f4ne|Chasselay]], located about twenty kilometers from Lyon. He then entered the training center of [[Olympique Lyonnais]]. In 1994, he won the [[Coupe Gambardella]] with their U18 team.\n\n===Olympique Lyonnais===\nGiuly began his career with Lyon in 1994 at age 18, and made his debut for the club in [[Ligue]] 1 on 21 January 1995 against [[AS Cannes|Cannes]] in a 3\u20131 win. The following season, Giuly earned a nicknamed \"the magic elf\", referring to his low height (1.64 metres) and his vivacious character. In the 1996\u201397 season, Giuly finished the season with 16 goals in 37 matches. In 1997\u201398, he played 19 matches with Lyon and scored one goal. He made his last appearance for Lyon on 10 January 1998 in a 1\u20130 loss against [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], where he played 90 minutes.\n\n===AS Monaco===\nGiuly was signed by [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in the winter break in January 1998. The transfer fee was \u20ac7.5&nbsp;million (\u00a36.6&nbsp;million), although the fee was then assessed at 42&nbsp;million [[French francs|francs]], which was a considerable sum at that time.\n\nJust ten days after playing for Lyon against Marseille, Giuly made his Monaco debut against them in a 1\u20131 draw on 20 January 1998. Giuly scored his first goal for Monaco in a 5\u20132 win over [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] in May 1998, on the final day of Ligue 1. In his first half-season with Monaco, he made a total of 12 appearances, scoring once.\n\nIn the 1999\u20132000 season, Giuly proved to be a key member in the Monaco squad on its right side, as he led his team to the Ligue 1 title for the first time since 1997. The next season turned out to be a troublesome campaign, after Monaco finished in 11th place in the league. Giuly scored 7 goals in 30 appearances. In the 2001\u201302 season, Giuly started strongly with two goals against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] and [[RC Lens|Lens]] respectively, before he suffered ruptured ligaments in his right knee which kept him sidelined for almost the entire season and spoiled his chances of playing in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nThe 2002\u201303 season was decisive for Giuly. He made his return from injury in a match against [[Troyes AC|Troyes]] in a 4\u20130 win on 3 August 2003. In the [[2003 Coupe de la Ligue Final]] between Monaco and [[FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard|Sochaux]], Giuly captained the side and scored a brace in a 4\u20131 win to win the Coupe de la Ligue for the first time in the club's history. His good performance at Monaco led him being selected in the FIFA Confederations Cup which France won.\n\nAt the start of the 2003\u201304 season \u2013 Giuly's last with Monaco \u2013 he scored a superb overhead kick during a league match against Lens with an assist from [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rothen]], having suffered an injury that kept him out for a week prior to the game. While the club floundered in the race for the Ligue 1 title, they had a fantastic run in the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] progressing through the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League group stage|group stage]] (where Giuly scored goals at home to [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] and [[Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a]]) and making it through to the knockout stage. Here, Monaco eliminated [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] (in which he scored a brace in the second leg)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/champions_league/3593167.stm |title=Monaco 3\u20131 Real Madrid |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 April 2004 }}</ref> and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

Without Giuly, the club's task of winning the final was even more compromised. Even manager [[Didier Deschamps]] admitted that losing Giuly was a \"big blow\" and said, \"Giuly's injury was not good news for us \u2013 he is a very important player for us on the offensive side.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Deschamps rues inexperience|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/champions_league/3743149.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 May 2004|accessdate=28 April 2012}}</ref> This was Giuly's last appearance for Monaco.\n\n===Barcelona===\n[[File:Ronaldinho Belletti and Giuly 9dec2006.jpg|thumb|right|185px|Giuly celebrating a goal against [[Real Sociedad]] with [[Ronaldinho]] and [[Juliano Belletti]].]]\n[[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] paid about \u20ac7&nbsp;million to Monaco in order to sign Giuly on 28 June 2004, with Giuly signing a three-year contract.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/3847237.stm|title=Barcelona seal Giuly deal |date=28 June 2004 |work=[[BBC Sport]]}}</ref> On 29 August 2004, Giuly scored on his Barcelona debut against [[Racing de Santander]] in a 2\u20130 win and played 90 minutes.

He was the second top scorer for the club with 11 goals. Although his season was disrupted by several muscle injuries, Giuly was able to fulfil his promise to reach double digits in goals in his first year at his new club.\n\nIn [[2005\u201306 FC Barcelona season|2005\u201306]], he helped win the [[2005\u201306 La Liga|Spanish title]] again, as well as capture the second [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] trophy for the Catalan club. Giuly propelled Bar\u00e7a into the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League final]] by scoring the only goal in their semi-final against [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. After the match, Giuly said he had called on his teammates to keep calm and finish the job: \"Ronnie passed me the perfect ball. I attempted a shot from the left, the ball went in, so much the better! Now we've got one foot in the final, we have to remain cool and work hard to try and go all the way.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Giuly urges Barca calm|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11833/2374066/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=18 April 2006|accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nGiuly played the full 90 minutes in [[Paris]] as Barcelona came from a goal behind to defeat [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 2\u20131 at the [[Stade de France]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4773353.stm |title=Barcelona 2\u20131 Arsenal |date=17 May 2006 |work=[[BBC Sport]]}}</ref> Giuly subsequently scored, but the goal was ruled out due to the foul resulting [[Jens Lehmann]] sending off (making him the first player and only goalkeeper to ever be sent off in a Champions League/European Cup final). [[FIFA]] president [[Sepp Blatter]] later said he believed Giuly's goal should have stood.<ref>{{cite news|title=Blatter hits out at Hauge|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11670/2377203/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=18 May 2006|accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2006\u201307 FC Barcelona season|2006\u201307 season]], Giuly, although still a key member of the ''Bar\u00e7a'' squad, eventually lost his starting spot in the team, when [[Lionel Messi]] was promoted from the club's youth ranks. This resulted in Giuly saying his farewell to Barcelona.\n\n===Roma===\nOn 17 July 2007, Giuly signed for [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] on a three-year deal after the club paid a \u00a32.2&nbsp;million transfer fee to ''Bar\u00e7a''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11833_2610191,00.html|title=Roma seal Giuly signing |accessdate=12 July 2011 |work=[[Sky Sports]]}}</ref> A month later, Giuly won his first trophy with his new club, winning the [[Supercoppa Italiana]] against [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] (0\u20131). On 26 August 2007, he made his [[Serie A]] debut for Roma in a 2\u20130 win over [[U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo|Palermo]]. The next match, on 2 September, Giuly scored his first goal in a 3\u20130 win over [[S.S. Robur Siena|Siena]]. In the [[2007\u201308 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League group stage]], Giuly scored and provided assist for [[Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107]] in a 4\u20131 win over Ukrainian side [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] on 27 November. In the second leg of the round of 16 in the [[Coppa Italia]], he also scored and provided two assists for [[Mancini (Brazilian footballer)|Mancini]] and Roma fan favourite [[Francesco Totti]] in a 4\u20130 win over [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] on 16 January 2008.\n\nHowever, Giuly's only season at Roma had him scoring more than many starting players which made him in the top five scorers at the club for the season he spent at [[Stadio Olimpico]].<ref>[http://www.asroma.it/UserFiles/721.pdf Acquisizione del diritto alle prestazioni sportive del calciatore Ludovic Giuly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927040907/http://www.asroma.it/UserFiles/721.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Paris Saint-Germain===\nDesiring to return to France for more playing time, Giuly was coveted by Monaco, Marseille and Lyon, but on 18 July 2008, he signed with Paris Saint-Germain on a three-year contract, with PSG paying a reported \u20ac2.5&nbsp;million transfer fee to Roma.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20080718-psg-sign-ludovic-giuly-football-transfer-roma-paris|title=PSG sign veteran Giuly |date=18 July 2008 |work=[[France 24]]}}</ref> On 9 August 2008, he made his PSG debut against former club Monaco in a 1\u20130 loss. After an early season goal drought, marked by injury, he scored his first goal for PSG during their 1\u20130 win over [[Lille OSC|Lille]] on 10 November. He scored his second goal against [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]] and lead the team to a victory against Lyon, scoring a header against his first club. He scored his first brace of the season on 7 February 2009 against [[FC Nantes|Nantes]]. In his first season at the club, PSG had moderate success in [[2008\u201309 Ligue 1|Ligue 1]], finishing in sixth place and narrowly missing out on European play due to inferior goal difference.\n\nIn his second season ([[2009\u201310 Ligue 1|2009\u201310]]), PSG's league form was much worse and they finished in 13th place. He scored the first goal for the Parisian team against [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]] (1\u20131) on the first day of the championship and scored again in their second fixture against [[Le Mans FC|Le Mans]], as well as in their fifth fixture, against Lyon. That season, PSG won the [[2010 Coupe de France Final|Coupe de France]], defeating his former team Monaco in [[2010 Coupe de France Final|the final]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=780557&sec=europe&cc=5901|title=Coupe de France: Hoarau the hero for PSG|date=2 May 2010|work=[[ESPN soccernet]]}}</ref>\n\nIn his third and final season ([[2010\u201311 Paris Saint-Germain F.C. season|2010\u201311]]), Giuly began by scoring in play-off round of the [[2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]], away at [[Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]].

One of his greatest moments was being part of [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]'s squad, as he helped the team win the [[UEFA Champions League]] in [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|2005\u201306]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Early life===\nLudovic Giuly was immersed in the world of football from an early age since his father, Dominique Giuly, born in the village of [[Zalana]], in [[Corsica]], was a former goalkeeper, who played briefly in professional football for [[SC Bastia|Bastia]] before continuing an amateur career until the age of 32 with several clubs in the suburbs of [[Lyon]]. Ludovic Giuly made his debut in the club in which his father was then active: the ASCMO, now known as  [[Monts d'Or Azergues Foot]], in the city of [[Chasselay, Rh\u00f4ne|Chasselay]], located about twenty kilometers from Lyon. He then entered the training center of [[Olympique Lyonnais]]. In 1994, he won the [[Coupe Gambardella]] with their U18 team.\n\n===Olympique Lyonnais===\nGiuly began his career with Lyon in 1994 at age 18, and made his debut for the club in [[Ligue]] 1 on 21 January 1995 against [[AS Cannes|Cannes]] in a 3\u20131 win. The following season, Giuly earned a nicknamed \"the magic elf\", referring to his low height (1.64 metres) and his vivacious character. In the 1996\u201397 season, Giuly finished the season with 16 goals in 37 matches. In 1997\u201398, he played 19 matches with Lyon and scored one goal. He made his last appearance for Lyon on 10 January 1998 in a 1\u20130 loss against [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], where he played 90 minutes.\n\n===AS Monaco===\nGiuly was signed by [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in the winter break in January 1998. The transfer fee was \u20ac7.5&nbsp;million (\u00a36.6&nbsp;million), although the fee was then assessed at 42&nbsp;million [[French francs|francs]], which was a considerable sum at that time.\n\nJust ten days after playing for Lyon against Marseille, Giuly made his Monaco debut against them in a 1\u20131 draw on 20 January 1998. Giuly scored his first goal for Monaco in a 5\u20132 win over [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] in May 1998, on the final day of Ligue 1. In his first half-season with Monaco, he made a total of 12 appearances, scoring once.\n\nIn the 1999\u20132000 season, Giuly proved to be a key member in the Monaco squad on its right side, as he led his team to the Ligue 1 title for the first time since 1997. The next season turned out to be a troublesome campaign, after Monaco finished in 11th place in the league. Giuly scored 7 goals in 30 appearances. In the 2001\u201302 season, Giuly started strongly with two goals against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] and [[RC Lens|Lens]] respectively, before he suffered  ruptured ligaments in his right knee which kept him sidelined for almost the entire season and spoiled his chances of playing in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nThe 2002\u201303 season was decisive for Giuly. He made his return from injury in a match against [[Troyes AC|Troyes]] in a 4\u20130 win on 3 August 2003. In the [[2003 Coupe de la Ligue Final]] between Monaco and [[FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard|Sochaux]], Giuly captained the side and scored a brace in a 4\u20131 win to win the Coupe de la Ligue for the first time in the club's history. His good performance at Monaco led him being selected in the FIFA Confederations Cup which France won.\n\nAt the start of the 2003\u201304 season \u2013 Giuly's last with Monaco \u2013 he scored a superb overhead kick during a league match against Lens with an assist from [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rothen]], having suffered an injury that kept him out for a week prior to the game. While the club floundered in the race for the Ligue 1 title, they had a fantastic run in the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] progressing through the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League group stage|group stage]] (where Giuly scored goals at home to [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] and [[Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a]]) and making it through to the knockout stage. Here, Monaco eliminated [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] (in which he scored a brace in the second leg)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/champions_league/3593167.stm |title=Monaco 3\u20131 Real Madrid |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 April 2004 }}</ref> and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

Without Giuly, the club's task of winning the final was even more compromised. Even manager [[Didier Deschamps]] admitted that losing Giuly was a \"big blow\" and said, \"Giuly's injury was not good news for us \u2013 he is a very important player for us on the offensive side.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Deschamps rues inexperience|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/champions_league/3743149.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 May 2004|accessdate=28 April 2012}}</ref> This was Giuly's last appearance for Monaco.\n\n===Barcelona===\n[[File:Ronaldinho Belletti and Giuly 9dec2006.jpg|thumb|right|185px|Giuly celebrating a goal against [[Real Sociedad]] with [[Ronaldinho]] and [[Juliano Belletti]].]]\n[[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] paid about \u20ac7&nbsp;million to Monaco in order to sign Giuly on 28 June 2004, with Giuly signing a three-year contract.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/3847237.stm|title=Barcelona seal Giuly deal |date=28 June 2004 |work=[[BBC Sport]]}}</ref> On 29 August 2004, Giuly scored on his Barcelona debut against [[Racing de Santander]] in a 2\u20130 win and played 90 minutes.

He was the second top scorer for the club with 11 goals. Although his season was disrupted by several muscle injuries, Giuly was able to fulfil his promise to reach double digits in goals in his first year at his new club.\n\nIn [[2005\u201306 FC Barcelona season|2005\u201306]], he helped win the [[2005\u201306 La Liga|Spanish title]] again, as well as capture the second [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] trophy for the Catalan club. Giuly propelled Bar\u00e7a into the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League final]] by scoring the only goal in their semi-final against [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. After the match, Giuly said he had called on his teammates to keep calm and finish the job: \"Ronnie passed me the perfect ball. I attempted a shot from the left, the ball went in, so much the better! Now we've got one foot in the final, we have to remain cool and work hard to try and go all the way.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Giuly urges Barca calm|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11833/2374066/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=18 April 2006|accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nGiuly played the full 90 minutes in [[Paris]] as Barcelona came from a goal behind to defeat [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 2\u20131 at the [[Stade de France]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4773353.stm |title=Barcelona 2\u20131 Arsenal |date=17 May 2006 |work=[[BBC Sport]]}}</ref> Giuly subsequently scored, but the goal was ruled out due to the foul resulting [[Jens Lehmann]] sending off (making him the first player and only goalkeeper to ever be sent off in a Champions League/European Cup final). [[FIFA]] president [[Sepp Blatter]] later said he believed Giuly's goal should have stood.<ref>{{cite news|title=Blatter hits out at Hauge|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11670/2377203/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=18 May 2006|accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2006\u201307 FC Barcelona season|2006\u201307 season]], Giuly, although still a key member of the ''Bar\u00e7a'' squad, eventually lost his starting spot in the team, when [[Lionel Messi]] was promoted from the club's youth ranks. This resulted in Giuly saying his farewell to Barcelona.\n\n===Roma===\nOn 17 July 2007, Giuly signed for [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] on a three-year deal after the club paid a \u00a32.2&nbsp;million transfer fee to ''Bar\u00e7a''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11833_2610191,00.html|title=Roma seal Giuly signing |accessdate=12 July 2011 |work=[[Sky Sports]]}}</ref> A month later, Giuly won his first trophy with his new club, winning the [[Supercoppa Italiana]] against [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] (0\u20131). On 26 August 2007, he made his [[Serie A]] debut for Roma in a 2\u20130 win over [[U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo|Palermo]]. The next match, on 2 September, Giuly scored his first goal in a 3\u20130 win over [[S.S. Robur Siena|Siena]]. In the [[2007\u201308 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League group stage]], Giuly scored and provided assist for [[Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107]] in a 4\u20131 win over Ukrainian side [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] on 27 November. In the second leg of the round of 16 in the [[Coppa Italia]], he also scored and provided two assists for [[Mancini (Brazilian footballer)|Mancini]] and Roma fan favourite [[Francesco Totti]] in a 4\u20130 win over [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] on 16 January 2008.\n\nHowever, Giuly's only season at Roma had him scoring more than many starting players which made him in the top five scorers at the club for the season he spent at [[Stadio Olimpico]].<ref>[http://www.asroma.it/UserFiles/721.pdf Acquisizione del diritto alle prestazioni sportive del calciatore Ludovic Giuly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927040907/http://www.asroma.it/UserFiles/721.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Paris Saint-Germain===\nDesiring to return to France for more playing time, Giuly was coveted by Monaco, Marseille and Lyon, but on 18 July 2008, he signed with Paris Saint-Germain on a three-year contract, with PSG paying a reported \u20ac2.5&nbsp;million transfer fee to Roma.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20080718-psg-sign-ludovic-giuly-football-transfer-roma-paris|title=PSG sign veteran Giuly |date=18 July 2008 |work=[[France 24]]}}</ref> On 9 August 2008, he made his PSG debut against former club Monaco in a 1\u20130 loss. After an early season goal drought, marked by injury, he scored his first goal for PSG during their 1\u20130 win over [[Lille OSC|Lille]] on 10 November. He scored his second goal against [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]] and lead the team to a victory against Lyon, scoring a header against his first club. He scored his first brace of the season on 7 February 2009 against  [[FC Nantes|Nantes]]. In his first season at the club, PSG had moderate success in [[2008\u201309 Ligue 1|Ligue 1]], finishing in sixth place and narrowly missing out on European play due to inferior goal difference.\n\nIn his second season ([[2009\u201310 Ligue 1|2009\u201310]]), PSG's league form was much worse and they finished in 13th place. He scored the first goal for the Parisian team against [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]] (1\u20131) on the first day of the championship and scored again in their second fixture against [[Le Mans FC|Le Mans]], as well as in their fifth fixture, against Lyon. That season, PSG won the [[2010 Coupe de France Final|Coupe de France]], defeating his former team Monaco in [[2010 Coupe de France Final|the final]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=780557&sec=europe&cc=5901|title=Coupe de France: Hoarau the hero for PSG|date=2 May 2010|work=[[ESPN soccernet]]}}</ref>\n\nIn his third and final season ([[2010\u201311 Paris Saint-Germain F.C. season|2010\u201311]]), Giuly began by scoring in play-off round of the [[2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]], away at [[Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]].

Vaughan]] was hired to write a screenplay for [[Marvel Studios]] in May 2008, based on his comic book ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]''.<ref name=\"RunawaysMay2008\" /> In April 2010, Marvel hired [[Peter Sollett]] to direct the film,<ref name=\"SollettRunaways\" /> and a month later [[Drew Pearce]] signed on to write a new script.<ref name=\"PearceRunaways\" /> Development on the film was put on hold the following October,<ref name=\"RunawaysHold\" /> and Pearce explained in September 2013 that the ''Runaways'' film had been shelved due to the success of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''; the earliest the film could be made was for Phase Three of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref name=\"PearceRunaways2\" /> In October 2014, after announcing Marvel's Phase Three films without ''Runaways'', Marvel Studios president [[Kevin Feige]] said the project was \"still an awesome script that exists in our script vault ... In our television and future film discussions, it's always one that we talk about, because we have a solid draft there. [But] we can't make them all.\"<ref name=\"Oct2014EventQA\" />\n\n[[Marvel Television]], based at [[ABC Studios]], was waiting for the right [[showrunner]] before moving forward with a television take on the characters. [[Josh Schwartz]] and [[Stephanie Savage]], whose company [[Fake Empire Productions]] had an overall deal with ABC, independently brought up the property during a general meeting with the studio,<ref name=\"TCAJul2017\" /><ref name=\"RunawaysHulu\" /> and, by August 2016, the pair had spent a year conversing with Marvel about turning ''Runaways'' into a television series. That month, it was announced that streaming service [[Hulu]] had ordered a pilot episode and scripts for a full season of ''Runaways'', to be co-produced by Marvel Television, [[ABC Studios#ABC Signature|ABC Signature Studios]], and Fake Empire Productions. Hulu was believed to already have \"an eye toward a full-season greenlight\".<ref name=\"RunawaysHulu\" /><ref name=\"RunawaysHuluVariety\" /> Executive producer [[Jeph Loeb]] felt \"it was an easy decision\" to have Hulu air the series over the other networks Marvel Television works with, because \"[w]e were very excited about the possibility of joining a network that was young and growing in the same way that when we went to [[Netflix]] when it was young and growing on the original side. It really feels like we're in the right place at the right time with the right show.\" Loeb and Marvel Television were also impressed by the success of Hulu's ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'', which helped further justify the decision.<ref name=\"WhyHulu\" /> Schwartz and Savage wrote the pilot, and serve as showrunners on the series, as well as executive producers alongside Loeb and Jim Chory.<ref name=\"RunawaysHulu\" /><ref name=\"RunawaysHuluVariety\" /> In May 2017, ''Runaways'' received a 10-episode series order from Hulu at their annual advertising [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]] presentation.<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" />\n\nFake Empire's Lis Rowinski produces the series,<ref name=\"RunawaysHulu\" /><ref name=\"RunawaysHuluVariety\" /> and Vaughan serves as an executive consultant.<ref name=\"CastAnnounce\" /> On this, Vaughan noted he \"did a little consulting early in the process\", but felt the series \"found the ideal 'foster parents' in Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage \u2026 [who] lovingly adapted [the comics] into a stylish drama that feels like contemporary Los Angeles\". He also praised the cast, crew and writers working on the series, and felt the pilot looked \"like an [[Adrian Alphona]] comic\", referring to the artist who worked with Vaughan when he created the characters.<ref name=\"VaughanMay2017\" /> Loeb said that it had been Schwartz and Savage who had asked that Vaughan be involved, and said that this was something that \"a lot of showrunners don't immediately gravitate towards\". In discussions with Vaughan, Marvel found that he \"really wanted to be involved and make sure that it was done, not just properly, but in a way that it would last 100 episodes\".<ref name=\"EPsColliderSet\" /> On January 8, 2018, Hulu renewed the series for a 13-episode second season.<ref name=\"RunawaysS2\" />\n\nOn March 24, 2019, Hulu renewed the series for a ten-episode third season.<ref name=\"RunawaysS3\" /> That November, it was announced the third season would be the final one for the series.<ref name=\"Cancelled\" />\n\n===Writing===\nSchwartz was a fan of the ''Runaways'' comic for some time, and introduced it to Savage, saying, \"When you're a teenager, everything feels like life and death, and the stakes in this story\u2014really felt like that.\" Loeb described the series as ''[[The O.C.]]'' of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU),<ref name=\"TCAJul2017\" /> which Schwartz said meant \"treating the problems of teenagers as if they are adults\" and having the series \"feel true and authentic to the teenage experience, even in this heightened context\".<ref name=\"ShowrunnersIGNAug2017\" /> Loeb noted that it would deal with modern political issues by saying, \"This is a time when figures of authority are in question, and this is a story where teenagers are at that age where they see their parents as fallible and human. Just because someone is in charge, doesn't mean that they're here to do good.\"<ref name=\"TCAJul2017\" /> The producers did note that the series would explore the parents' perspective as well, with the pilot telling the story from the Runaways' perspective, and the second episode showing the same story from their parents'\u2014the [[Pride (comics)|Pride]]'s\u2014perspective, with the two stories converging midway through the first season.<ref name=\"TCAJul2017THR\" />\n\nSchwartz likened the tone of ''Runaways'' to that of the comics it was based on, calling it \"so distinct\", saying much of the tone Vaughn used when writing the comics overlapped with the tones Schwartz and Savage like to work in.<ref name=\"ShowrunnersIGNAug2017\" /> The pair were excited by the freedom given to them by Hulu over the usual broadcasters they were used to working with, such as allowing the children to swear in the show, not having set lengths for each episode, and being able to explore the parents' story; Hulu wanted \"something that felt broad and where we could push the envelope in places\". Schwartz described the series as a coming-of-age story and a family drama, with focus on the characters that can lead to long stretches of the series not featuring super powers, so \"if you didn't see the show title, you wouldn't know that you were in a Marvel show for long stretches ... That was our aesthetic starting place, but there are episodes where there's some good [Marvel] stuff.\"<ref name=\"EPsColliderSet\" />\n\nSpeaking to the second season, Schwartz felt the series would \"accelerate\" since the season would be following the kids on the run, saying, \"Our focus shifts to these kids and trying to survive in the streets\u2026 there's a greater sense of tension and momentum in keeping with where we are in this part of the story.\" He added that the kids' experience on the run would force them to grow up and make them confront and deal with adult themes quickly.<ref name=\"DeadlineTCA2018\" /> He added that the relationship between Nico and Karolina that began at the end of the first season would be \"the emotional core\" of the second.<ref name=\"NicoKarolinaS2Relationship\" /> As for the parents in the season, Schwartz described them as racing against the clock \"to find their kids before something catastrophic potentially could occur\".<ref name=\"DeadlineTCA2018\" /> Since the kids know about their powers, they are utilized more in the season. Additionally, the hostel the kids move into is a dilapidated mansion under [[Griffith Park]].<ref name=\"THRS2SetVisit\" />\n\nWith the third season being the final one of the series, \"the story [was] said to come to a natural ending point\".<ref name=\"Cancelled\" /> When crafting the season, Schwartz and Savage were unsure if the season would be the last for the series, so they \"wanted to ensure that the finale was as satisfying as possible\" and crafted it as if it was a series finale, while \"hav[ing] the potential for another story out there whether it\u2019s something that we get to see onscreen or something that lives on in the imagination of the audience.\" The final moments of the episode see Alex find a note from his future self, telling him to hide \"Mancha\" and to kill Nico; in the comics, [[Victor Mancha]] was the son of [[Ultron]] who would join the Runaways to become a hero, and Alex betrays his friends. Time travel elements are also featured in the final episode, something teased in the previous seasons, which Savage said was \"in the DNA of the comics so it was something that we wanted to honor\".<ref name=\"EWShowrunnersS3Ending\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Runaways cast at 2017 New York Comic Con.jpg|thumb|Cast of ''Runaways'' at the 2017 [[New York Comic Con]] (L-R:  [[Rhenzy Feliz]], [[Lyrica Okano]], [[Gregg Sulkin]], [[Virginia Gardner]] and [[Ariela Barer]])]]\nIn February 2017, Marvel announced the casting of the Runaways, with [[Rhenzy Feliz]] as [[Alex Wilder]], [[Lyrica Okano]] as [[Nico Minoru]], [[Virginia Gardner]] as [[Karolina Dean]], [[Ariela Barer]] as [[Gert Yorkes]], [[Gregg Sulkin]] as [[Chase Stein]], and [[Allegra Acosta]] as [[Molly Hayes|Molly Hernandez]].<ref name=\"CastAnnounce\" /> Shortly after, Marvel announced the casting of the Pride, with [[Ryan Sands]] as [[Geoffrey Wilder]], [[Angel Parker]] as Catherine Wilder, [[Brittany Ishibashi]] as [[Tina Minoru]], [[James Yaegashi]] as Robert Minoru, [[Kevin Weisman]] as Dale Yorkes, [[Brigid Brannagh]] as Stacey Yorkes, [[Annie Wersching]] as Leslie Dean, [[Kip Pardue]] as Frank Dean, [[James Marsters]] as Victor Stein, and [[Ever Carradine]] as Janet Stein.<ref name=\"PrideCastAnnounce\" /> Loeb praised casting director Patrick Rush, explaining that all of the series regulars for ''Runaways'' were the producers' first choice for the role. The majority of the children are portrayed by \"fresh faces\", which was an intentional choice.<ref name=\"EPsColliderSet\" /> By August 2017, [[Julian McMahon]] had been cast in the recurring role of Jonah.<ref name=\"McMahon\" /> He was promoted to series regular for the second season.<ref name=\"DeadlineS2Trailer\" />\n\nFor the second season, Schwartz noted that \"really popular, exciting characters\" from the comics would appear.<ref name=\"DeadlineTCA2018\" /> In October 2018, it was announced that Jan Luis Castellanos had joined the cast as [[Topher (comics)|Topher]].<ref name=\"Topher\" /> Clarissa Thibeaux was cast as [[Xavin]].<ref name=\"Xavin\"/>\n\nIn June 2019, [[Elizabeth Hurley]] was announced as cast in the role of [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] for the third season.<ref name=\"HurleyCastS3\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming on the pilot began by February 10, 2017,<ref name=\"FilmingStart2\" /> in Los Angeles,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Rugrats'',<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> and concluded on March 3.<ref name=\"PilotFilmingEnd\" /> Director [[Brett Morgen]] was given free rein by Marvel and Hulu to establish the look of the series,<ref name=\"MorgenCollider\" /> and wanted to create a feel that was \"very grounded and authentic\".<ref name=\"EPsColliderSet\" /> He also looked to differentiate between the hand-held, gritty world of the Runaways and the more stylistic world of the Pride. He felt the latter could be explored more in the series moving forward, but was not available to direct any more episodes of the season.<ref name=\"MorgenCollider\" /> Following completion of the pilot and the show's pick-up to series, there was concern among the cast and crew that the impending writers' strike would prevent the series to move forward. However, the strike did not happen, and filming on the rest of the season began at the end of June, again in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"SulkinWizard\" /> Production on the season had concluded by October 21.<ref name=\"SeasonFilmingEnd\" />\n\nProduction on the second season began the week of April 23, 2018, again in Los Angeles under the working title ''Rugrats''.<ref name=\"SulkinS2Filming\" /><ref name=\"S2Filming\" /> Filming on the season continued until late September 2018.<ref name=\"S2Filming\" /><ref name=\"S2FilmingWrap\" /> Filming for the third season began on May 13, 2019.<ref name=\"S3Filming\" />\n\n===Music===\nIn May 2017, [[Siddhartha Khosla]] was hired to compose the music for the series.<ref name=\"Khosla\" /> Khosla said that, due to his history as a songwriter, his scoring process involves \"working on these song-stories and weaving them through different episodes\". He described the ''Runaways'' score as being \"completely synthesized\",<ref name=\"KhoslaJul2017\" /> utilizing analog synthesizers from the 1980s, specifically the [[Roland Juno-60]] and [[Oberheim Electronics]]' synths. Khosla compared the \"alternative feel\" of his score to [[Depeche Mode]], adding \"there is an element of rebellion, so sonically going for something that is a little bit outside the box, non-traditional, I felt was an appropriate approach. I feel like I'm making art on this show.\"<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" /> [[Alex Patsavas]] serves as [[music supervisor]], having done so on all of Schwartz and Savage's previous series.<ref name=\"ShowrunnersIGNAug2017\" /> On January 12, 2018, a soundtrack from the first season consisting of 12 licensed tracks plus two by Khosla, was released digitally.<ref name=\"Soundtracks\" />\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = ''Runaways (Original Soundtrack)''\n| total_length    = \n| extra_column    = Artist(s)\n\n| title1   = Runaways Theme\n| extra1   = [[Siddhartha Khosla]]\n| length1  = 1:13\n| title2   = May I Have This Dance\n| extra2   = [[Francis and the Lights]]\n| length2  = 2:53\n| title3   = Cane Shuga\n| extra3   = [[Glass Animals]]\n| length3  = 3:17\n| title4   = King Charles (Clean)\n| extra4   = [[Yungblud]]\n| length4  = 2:41\n| title5   = [[Drinkee]]\n| extra5   = [[Sofi Tukker]]\n| length5  = 4:59\n| title6   = [[Ocean Eyes (song)|Ocean Eyes (Blackbear Remix)]]\n| extra6   = [[Billie Eilish]]\n| length6  = 3:14\n| title7   = Beat Goes On\n| extra7   = Lizzy Land\n| length7  = 3:40\n| title8   = All My Heroes\n| extra8   = [[Bleachers (band)|Bleachers]]\n| length8  = 3:03\n| title9   = Antidote (Live Arrangement)\n| extra9   = [[Emily Wells]]\n| length9  = 5:43\n| title10  = Fuerza (feat.

The fact that they've found each other and they're going through this mystery together at the moment is what we're concerned about, not what [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] is doing.\" The showrunners considered the series' connection to the MCU to be \"liberating\", as it allowed them to set the series in a universe where superheroics and fantasy are already established and do not need to be explained to the audience.<ref name=\"WrapMCU\" /> Schwartz said they  \"were very capable of telling the story that we wanted to tell independent of any of the other Marvel stories that are out there.\"<ref name=\"ShowrunnersIGNAug2017\" /> Initially, Loeb had said that there were no plans to crossover across networks with the similarly themed ''[[Cloak & Dagger (TV series)|Cloak & Dagger]]'' on [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]], as Marvel wanted the series to find its footing before further connecting with other elements of the universe, though \"You'll see things that comment on each other; we try to touch base wherever we can... things that are happening in L.A. are not exactly going to be affecting what's happening in New Orleans [where ''Cloak & Dagger'' is set]...

Vaughan]] was hired to write a screenplay for [[Marvel Studios]] in May 2008, based on his comic book ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]''.<ref name=\"RunawaysMay2008\" /> In April 2010, Marvel hired [[Peter Sollett]] to direct the film,<ref name=\"SollettRunaways\" /> and a month later [[Drew Pearce]] signed on to write a new script.<ref name=\"PearceRunaways\" /> Development on the film was put on hold the following October,<ref name=\"RunawaysHold\" /> and Pearce explained in September 2013 that the ''Runaways'' film had been shelved due to the success of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''; the earliest the film could be made was for Phase Three of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref name=\"PearceRunaways2\" /> In October 2014, after announcing Marvel's Phase Three films without ''Runaways'', Marvel Studios president [[Kevin Feige]] said the project was \"still an awesome script that exists in our script vault ... In our television and future film discussions, it's always one that we talk about, because we have a solid draft there. [But] we can't make them all.\"<ref name=\"Oct2014EventQA\" />\n\n[[Marvel Television]], based at [[ABC Studios]], was waiting for the right [[showrunner]] before moving forward with a television take on the characters. [[Josh Schwartz]] and [[Stephanie Savage]], whose company [[Fake Empire Productions]] had an overall deal with ABC, independently brought up the property during a general meeting with the studio,<ref name=\"TCAJul2017\" /><ref name=\"RunawaysHulu\" /> and, by August 2016, the pair had spent a year conversing with Marvel about turning ''Runaways'' into a television series. That month, it was announced that streaming service [[Hulu]] had ordered a pilot episode and scripts for a full season of ''Runaways'', to be co-produced by Marvel Television, [[ABC Studios#ABC Signature|ABC Signature Studios]], and Fake Empire Productions. Hulu was believed to already have \"an eye toward a full-season greenlight\".<ref name=\"RunawaysHulu\" /><ref name=\"RunawaysHuluVariety\" /> Executive producer [[Jeph Loeb]] felt \"it was an easy decision\" to have Hulu air the series over the other networks Marvel Television works with, because \"[w]e were very excited about the possibility of joining a network that was young and growing in the same way that when we went to [[Netflix]] when it was young and growing on the original side. It really feels like we're in the right place at the right time with the right show.\" Loeb and Marvel Television were also impressed by the success of Hulu's ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'', which helped further justify the decision.<ref name=\"WhyHulu\" /> Schwartz and Savage wrote the pilot, and serve as showrunners on the series, as well as executive producers alongside Loeb and Jim Chory.<ref name=\"RunawaysHulu\" /><ref name=\"RunawaysHuluVariety\" /> In May 2017, ''Runaways'' received a 10-episode series order from Hulu at their annual advertising [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]] presentation.<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" />\n\nFake Empire's Lis Rowinski produces the series,<ref name=\"RunawaysHulu\" /><ref name=\"RunawaysHuluVariety\" /> and Vaughan serves as an executive consultant.<ref name=\"CastAnnounce\" /> On this, Vaughan noted he \"did a little consulting early in the process\", but felt the series \"found the ideal 'foster parents' in Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage \u2026 [who] lovingly adapted [the comics] into a stylish drama that feels like contemporary Los Angeles\". He also praised the cast, crew and writers working on the series, and felt the pilot looked \"like an [[Adrian Alphona]] comic\", referring to the artist who worked with Vaughan when he created the characters.<ref name=\"VaughanMay2017\" /> Loeb said that it had been Schwartz and Savage who had asked that Vaughan be involved, and said that this was something that \"a lot of showrunners don't immediately gravitate towards\". In discussions with Vaughan, Marvel found that he \"really wanted to be involved and make sure that it was done, not just properly, but in a way that it would last 100 episodes\".<ref name=\"EPsColliderSet\" /> On January 8, 2018, Hulu renewed the series for a 13-episode second season.<ref name=\"RunawaysS2\" />\n\nOn March 24, 2019, Hulu renewed the series for a ten-episode third season.<ref name=\"RunawaysS3\" /> That November, it was announced the third season would be the final one for the series.<ref name=\"Cancelled\" />\n\n===Writing===\nSchwartz was a fan of the ''Runaways'' comic for some time, and introduced it to Savage, saying, \"When you're a teenager, everything feels like life and death, and the stakes in this story\u2014really felt like that.\" Loeb described the series as ''[[The O.C.]]'' of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU),<ref name=\"TCAJul2017\" /> which Schwartz said meant \"treating the problems of teenagers as if they are adults\" and having the series \"feel true and authentic to the teenage experience, even in this heightened context\".<ref name=\"ShowrunnersIGNAug2017\" /> Loeb noted that it would deal with modern political issues by saying, \"This is a time when figures of authority are in question, and this is a story where teenagers are at that age where they see their parents as fallible and human. Just because someone is in charge, doesn't mean that they're here to do good.\"<ref name=\"TCAJul2017\" /> The producers did note that the series would explore the parents' perspective as well, with the pilot telling the story from the Runaways' perspective, and the second episode showing the same story from their parents'\u2014the [[Pride (comics)|Pride]]'s\u2014perspective, with the two stories converging midway through the first season.<ref name=\"TCAJul2017THR\" />\n\nSchwartz likened the tone of ''Runaways'' to that of the comics it was based on, calling it \"so distinct\", saying much of the tone Vaughn used when writing the comics overlapped with the tones Schwartz and Savage like to work in.<ref name=\"ShowrunnersIGNAug2017\" /> The pair were excited by the freedom given to them by Hulu over the usual broadcasters they were used to working with, such as allowing the children to swear in the show, not having set lengths for each episode, and being able to explore the parents' story; Hulu wanted \"something that felt broad and where we could push the envelope in places\". Schwartz described the series as a coming-of-age story and a family drama, with focus on the characters that can lead to long stretches of the series not featuring super powers, so \"if you didn't see the show title, you wouldn't know that you were in a Marvel show for long stretches ... That was our aesthetic starting place, but there are episodes where there's some good [Marvel] stuff.\"<ref name=\"EPsColliderSet\" />\n\nSpeaking to the second season, Schwartz felt the series would \"accelerate\" since the season would be following the kids on the run, saying, \"Our focus shifts to these kids and trying to survive in the streets\u2026 there's a greater sense of tension and momentum in keeping with where we are in this part of the story.\" He added that the kids' experience on the run would force them to grow up and make them confront and deal with adult themes quickly.<ref name=\"DeadlineTCA2018\" /> He added that the relationship between Nico and Karolina that began at the end of the first season would be \"the emotional core\" of the second.<ref name=\"NicoKarolinaS2Relationship\" /> As for the parents in the season, Schwartz described them as racing against the clock \"to find their kids before something catastrophic potentially could occur\".<ref name=\"DeadlineTCA2018\" /> Since the kids know about their powers, they are utilized more in the season. Additionally, the hostel the kids move into is a dilapidated mansion under [[Griffith Park]].<ref name=\"THRS2SetVisit\" />\n\nWith the third season being the final one of the series, \"the story [was] said to come to a natural ending point\".<ref name=\"Cancelled\" /> When crafting the season, Schwartz and Savage were unsure if the season would be the last for the series, so they \"wanted to ensure that the finale was as satisfying as possible\" and crafted it as if it was a series finale, while \"hav[ing] the potential for another story out there whether it\u2019s something that we get to see onscreen or something that lives on in the imagination of the audience.\" The final moments of the episode see Alex find a note from his future self, telling him to hide \"Mancha\" and to kill Nico; in the comics, [[Victor Mancha]] was the son of [[Ultron]] who would join the Runaways to become a hero, and Alex betrays his friends. Time travel elements are also featured in the final episode, something teased in the previous seasons, which Savage said was \"in the DNA of the comics so it was something that we wanted to honor\".<ref name=\"EWShowrunnersS3Ending\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Runaways cast at 2017 New York Comic Con.jpg|thumb|Cast of ''Runaways'' at the 2017 [[New York Comic Con]] (L-R:  [[Rhenzy Feliz]], [[Lyrica Okano]], [[Gregg Sulkin]], [[Virginia Gardner]] and [[Ariela Barer]])]]\nIn February 2017, Marvel announced the casting of the Runaways, with [[Rhenzy Feliz]] as [[Alex Wilder]], [[Lyrica Okano]] as [[Nico Minoru]], [[Virginia Gardner]] as [[Karolina Dean]], [[Ariela Barer]] as [[Gert Yorkes]], [[Gregg Sulkin]] as [[Chase Stein]], and [[Allegra Acosta]] as [[Molly Hayes|Molly Hernandez]].<ref name=\"CastAnnounce\" /> Shortly after, Marvel announced the casting of the Pride, with [[Ryan Sands]] as [[Geoffrey Wilder]], [[Angel Parker]] as Catherine Wilder, [[Brittany Ishibashi]] as [[Tina Minoru]], [[James Yaegashi]] as Robert Minoru, [[Kevin Weisman]] as Dale Yorkes, [[Brigid Brannagh]] as Stacey Yorkes, [[Annie Wersching]] as Leslie Dean, [[Kip Pardue]] as Frank Dean, [[James Marsters]] as Victor Stein, and [[Ever Carradine]] as Janet Stein.<ref name=\"PrideCastAnnounce\" /> Loeb praised casting director Patrick Rush, explaining that all of the series regulars for ''Runaways'' were the producers' first choice for the role. The majority of the children are portrayed by \"fresh faces\", which was an intentional choice.<ref name=\"EPsColliderSet\" /> By August 2017, [[Julian McMahon]] had been cast in the recurring role of Jonah.<ref name=\"McMahon\" /> He was promoted to series regular for the second season.<ref name=\"DeadlineS2Trailer\" />\n\nFor the second season, Schwartz noted that \"really popular, exciting characters\" from the comics would appear.<ref name=\"DeadlineTCA2018\" /> In October 2018, it was announced that Jan Luis Castellanos had joined the cast as [[Topher (comics)|Topher]].<ref name=\"Topher\" /> Clarissa Thibeaux was cast as [[Xavin]].<ref name=\"Xavin\"/>\n\nIn June 2019, [[Elizabeth Hurley]] was announced as cast in the role of [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] for the third season.<ref name=\"HurleyCastS3\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming on the pilot began by February 10, 2017,<ref name=\"FilmingStart2\" /> in Los Angeles,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Rugrats'',<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> and concluded on March 3.<ref name=\"PilotFilmingEnd\" /> Director [[Brett Morgen]] was given free rein by Marvel and Hulu to establish the look of the series,<ref name=\"MorgenCollider\" /> and wanted to create a feel that was \"very grounded and authentic\".<ref name=\"EPsColliderSet\" /> He also looked to differentiate between the hand-held, gritty world of the Runaways and the more stylistic world of the Pride. He felt the latter could be explored more in the series moving forward, but was not available to direct any more episodes of the season.<ref name=\"MorgenCollider\" /> Following completion of the pilot and the show's pick-up to series, there was concern among the cast and crew that the impending writers' strike would prevent the series to move forward. However, the strike did not happen, and filming on the rest of the season began at the end of June, again in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"SulkinWizard\" /> Production on the season had concluded by October 21.<ref name=\"SeasonFilmingEnd\" />\n\nProduction on the second season began the week of April 23, 2018, again in Los Angeles under the working title ''Rugrats''.<ref name=\"SulkinS2Filming\" /><ref name=\"S2Filming\" /> Filming on the season continued until late September 2018.<ref name=\"S2Filming\" /><ref name=\"S2FilmingWrap\" /> Filming for the third season began on May 13, 2019.<ref name=\"S3Filming\" />\n\n===Music===\nIn May 2017, [[Siddhartha Khosla]] was hired to compose the music for the series.<ref name=\"Khosla\" /> Khosla said that, due to his history as a songwriter, his scoring process involves \"working on these song-stories and weaving them through different episodes\". He described the ''Runaways'' score as being \"completely synthesized\",<ref name=\"KhoslaJul2017\" /> utilizing analog synthesizers from the 1980s, specifically the [[Roland Juno-60]] and [[Oberheim Electronics]]' synths. Khosla compared the \"alternative feel\" of his score to [[Depeche Mode]], adding \"there is an element of rebellion, so sonically going for something that is a little bit outside the box, non-traditional, I felt was an appropriate approach. I feel like I'm making art on this show.\"<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" /> [[Alex Patsavas]] serves as [[music supervisor]], having done so on all of Schwartz and Savage's previous series.<ref name=\"ShowrunnersIGNAug2017\" /> On January 12, 2018, a soundtrack from the first season consisting of 12 licensed tracks plus two by Khosla, was released digitally.<ref name=\"Soundtracks\" />\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = ''Runaways (Original Soundtrack)''\n| total_length    = \n| extra_column    = Artist(s)\n\n| title1   = Runaways Theme\n| extra1   = [[Siddhartha Khosla]]\n| length1  = 1:13\n| title2   = May I Have This Dance\n| extra2   = [[Francis and the Lights]]\n| length2  = 2:53\n| title3   = Cane Shuga\n| extra3   = [[Glass Animals]]\n| length3  = 3:17\n| title4   = King Charles (Clean)\n| extra4   = [[Yungblud]]\n| length4  = 2:41\n| title5   = [[Drinkee]]\n| extra5   = [[Sofi Tukker]]\n| length5  = 4:59\n| title6   = [[Ocean Eyes (song)|Ocean Eyes (Blackbear Remix)]]\n| extra6   = [[Billie Eilish]]\n| length6  = 3:14\n| title7   = Beat Goes On\n| extra7   = Lizzy Land\n| length7  = 3:40\n| title8   = All My Heroes\n| extra8   = [[Bleachers (band)|Bleachers]]\n| length8  = 3:03\n| title9   = Antidote (Live Arrangement)\n| extra9   = [[Emily Wells]]\n| length9  = 5:43\n| title10  = Fuerza (feat.

The fact that they've found each other and they're going through this mystery together at the moment is what we're concerned about, not what [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] is doing.\" The showrunners considered the series' connection to the MCU to be \"liberating\", as it allowed them to set the series in a universe where superheroics and fantasy are already established and do not need to be explained to the audience.<ref name=\"WrapMCU\" /> Schwartz said they  \"were very capable of telling the story that we wanted to tell independent of any of the other Marvel stories that are out there.\"<ref name=\"ShowrunnersIGNAug2017\" /> Initially, Loeb had said that there were no plans to crossover across networks with the similarly themed ''[[Cloak & Dagger (TV series)|Cloak & Dagger]]'' on [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]], as Marvel wanted the series to find its footing before further connecting with other elements of the universe, though \"You'll see things that comment on each other; we try to touch base wherever we can... things that are happening in L.A. are not exactly going to be affecting what's happening in New Orleans [where ''Cloak & Dagger'' is set]...

The actor was asked to audition for the role in 2014, while he was working in the United States. After winning the role, Burns relocated to Australia. ''Neighbours'' marks Burns' first Australian television acting job. He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 6 February 2015. Burns left the cast in late 2017, and Tyler made his on-screen departure on 27 February 2018. He made a brief return from 16 October 2018, and again on 3 April 2019.\n\nTyler was introduced as the younger brother of established character [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]). He is portrayed as an impulsive, cocky \"badboy-with-a-heart\". Burns said that Tyler was untidy and relaxed, which was the exact opposite of Mark. Tyler had a short-lived romance with [[Imogen Willis]] ([[Ariel Kaplan]]), before switching his attentions to her half-sister [[Paige Smith]] ([[Olympia Valance]]).\n\nOne of Tyler's longest running story arcs focused on his involvement with [[Dennis Dimato]]'s (David Serafin) stolen car ring. Tyler eventually realised that he was in too deep and made a confession to Mark, which resulted in his arrest. Tyler and Mark's brother [[Aaron Brennan|Aaron]] (Matt Wilson) and father [[Russell Brennan|Russell]] ([[Russell Kiefel]]) were also introduced in 2015. Russell's introduction marked the start of a \"controversial\" domestic violence storyline, as it emerged that he had abused Tyler when he was younger.\n\n==Casting==\nOn 30 October 2014, the serial's official website announced that actor and model Travis Burns had been cast as Tyler Brennan, the younger brother of established character [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]).<ref name=\"BigBrother\">{{cite web|url=http://tenplay.com.au/channel-eleven/neighbours/show-news/scott-takes-on-big-brother-role|title=Scott takes on big brother role...|date=30 October 2014|publisher=[[Tenplay.com.au]]|accessdate=3 November 2014}}</ref> Burns was working in the United States when he was asked to audition for the part in early 2014.

Daniel Robinson and Paige Smith accuse Tyler of assaulting Imogen and they fight, causing them to be arrested. At the station, Tyler is reunited with his brother Mark. He moves in with Mark and gets a job at the local garage. Needing money to pay the rent, Tyler contemplates selling his bike, but is offered a job by Dennis Dimato. He is tasked with stripping Imogen's stolen car for parts, but he returns it anonymously, after agreeing to do a favour for Dimato. Tyler bonds with Imogen and he kisses Paige, but after she calls out his brother's name, they agree to be friends. Tyler steals a car for Dimato, but it is tracked by the police and Tyler is forced to hide while Dimato is arrested. Dimato purchases the garage to continue his operations and then flees the country. His partner Michelle Kim takes over his business and makes Tyler steal more cars. Imogen and Tyler go on a couple of dates, and Imogen decides to lose her virginity to him, but soon changes her mind.\n\nPaige's brother Bailey takes one of the stolen cars and when it is reclaimed, Michelle demands Paige and Tyler get her $8,000 or another car. Michelle also blackmails Paige into working with Tyler at the garage. Tyler develops feelings for Paige, but she is still in love with Mark; however, when he catches them working late at night, they are forced to tell him they are dating. Paige and Tyler try to make the garage a legitimate business in order to pay off their debts. Joey Dimato leaves them a bag of money that needs to be dropped off. Not wanting to be caught with it, they throw it down a well and retrieve it later. They discover some of the money has been stolen and Tyler is beaten. He refuses to go to the hospital and Paige gets him some painkillers. He tells his brother that he came off his bike. Tyler becomes dependent on the painkillers and steals Karl Kennedy's prescription pad to get more, causing tension between him and Nate Kinski. Mark contacts their brother Aaron and asks him to visit, knowing that he and Tyler are close.\n\nKarl discovers the missing prescriptions and Tyler confesses to taking them. He also admits to Mark that he has been working for Dimato. Mark arrests Tyler and asks him to leave the house. Nate persuades Karl to let Tyler stay with him. Tyler agrees to wear a wire and meet with Michelle, in return for the charges against him being dropped. When the wire is damaged, a second sting is organised, but Dimato returns and takes Tyler to a meeting at a warehouse. Tyler attempts to run away, but is quickly caught. Before he is harmed, Mark and the police arrive to arrest Dimato and his accomplices. Tyler attempts to tell Paige that he has feelings for her, but soon learns that she and Mark are back together. He befriends Karl's grandson Ben, but when Ben skips school to spend the day with him, Karl and [[Susan Kennedy|Susan]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]) tell Tyler to be more responsible. He decides to move home, but when he spots his father, Russell, in the street, he stays at the Men's Shed. Tyler then admits to Karl that Russell used to beat him. Russell eventually apologises to Tyler for his actions.\n\nTyler and Russell spend the day with Ben, and they bond when they play practical jokes on him. But when Russell loses his temper with Ben, Tyler is reminded of their past. Russell later goads Tyler and Tyler punches him. He then tells Mark about the abuse he endured when he was younger, and his brothers ask Russell to leave. Ben accidentally leaves the garage unlocked, leading to the theft of tools and Tyler's bike. Paige helps Tyler to find the stolen items and he kisses her, but Paige assures him that she loves his brother. Tyler helps Mark arrest the thief and he later meets the new owner of the garage [[Lucas Fitzgerald]] ([[Scott Major]]), who keeps him on as manager. Tyler is tasked with hiring another mechanic for the garage and he offers the job to [[Stephanie Scully]] ([[Carla Bonner]]). He later discovers Steph kidnapped Lucas' son while suffering from a psychotic break. Steph convinces him and Lucas she has changed and keeps her job. Tyler manipulates Paige and Mark into talking about having children, knowing Mark wants to be a father, but Paige is not ready. Aaron confronts him on his behaviour, realising he is trying to break them up. Tyler is trapped in a lift with Paige when a fire breaks out at Erinsborough High. He confesses his love for her, before passing out due to smoke inhalation. Paige gets Tyler breathing again and they are rescued by Mark. At the hospital, Tyler tells Paige that he plans to move on from her.\n\nTyler befriends [[Piper Willis]] (Mavournee Hazel) when she turns to him for advice. Piper develops a crush on Tyler and kisses him. He tells her nothing can happen, as she is too young for him. Piper's parents also warn him to stay away from her, after learning about the kiss. Imogen arranges a date with Tyler to get over Daniel. Piper admits that she has feelings for Tyler, but he tells her he would only bring her trouble and he begins dating [[Courtney Grixti]] (Emma Lane). They break up when Tyler feels that Courtney is trying to run his life. Imogen develops feelings for Tyler, so Tyler propositions her, as a ploy to get her to realise she wants to be with Daniel. Tyler confesses to the police that his interference with the Lassiter's boiler may have caused the explosion, but he is soon cleared as he did not touch the gas valve. Piper and Tyler grow closer and admit their feelings for each other. Tyler tells Piper that if they want to date, they need her parents' permission. Piper tells Tyler that Brad has given his blessing, and they agree to keep their relationship a secret, until [[Terese Willis|Terese]] ([[Rebekah Elmaloglou]]) gives hers. However, when Terese learns Piper plans to have sex with Tyler on the night of the school formal, she bans them from attending the dance together. Tyler breaks up with Piper, and he and Paige soon start a casual relationship.\n\nTyler and Piper become close again when he takes her to the beach to celebrate her birthday. He later rejects a kiss from her, before deciding that they should be together. However, he soon learns that she spent the night with [[Angus Beaumont-Hannay]] ([[Jai Waetford]]). Piper later tells Tyler that she is done with him. He then takes [[Tim Collins (Neighbours)|Tim Collins]]'s ([[Ben Anderson (actor)|Ben Anderson]]) car from the garage and crashes it. [[Simone Bader]] (Kahli Williams) offers to take the blame and Tyler agrees. He gives her $600 and lets her stay at the Men's Shed. He later tells Paige and Jack that he took the car and hands himself into the police. Tyler sells his half of the house to Mark to pay for the repairs to Tim's car. Tim asks Tyler to do a job for him in return for him not pressing charges, but Tyler refuses. He later learns Tim has changed his mind, as Piper has blackmailed him. Tyler and Piper reconcile at Brad and Lauren's wedding. Brad and Terese refuse to support the relationship, due to Piper's age. When Brad attacks Tyler, he and Piper drive off together. Mark and Ned find them at a motel in Glenrowan, and Tyler persuades Piper to return home. Tyler loses his job at the garage. [[Leo Tanaka]] (Tim Kano) invites him and Piper to move into his backpackers hostel. They struggle financially, until Tyler gets a job at a bar in the city. Weeks later, he is fired, but he manages to convince Lucas to give him his job back at the garage.\n\nTyler feels insecure when he sees Piper bonding with backpacker [[T-Bone (Neighbours)|T-Bone]] (Des Flanagan) and later fights with him. Piper is injured after a ute crashes into the hostel and Tyler initially believes T-Bone was responsible. With [[Mishti Sharma]]'s (Scarlet Vas) help, he finds T-Bone in the city and attacks him. Piper decides to return home while she recovers, while Tyler moves back in with his brothers. Their mother [[Fay Brennan]] ([[Zoe Bertram]]) comes to visit, and she apologises to Tyler for leaving him and his brothers with Russell and for the abuse he suffered. Fay later tells Tyler, Mark and Aaron that their father, Russell is seriously ill and wants to see them. However, before they set off for the airport, Fay learns that Russell has died. Mishti strikes Tyler with her car, leaving him with severe bruising. Shortly after returning from Russell's funeral, Sheila tells Mark, Aaron and Tyler that one of them is not Russell's son. Fay then returns to explain that Tyler was born after she had an affair with [[Hamish Roche]] (Sean Taylor). Tyler struggles with the revelation. Hamish soon comes to Erinsborough to meet Tyler, who is encouraged to spend time with him by Mark. Hamish persuades Tyler and Aaron not to sell the boat they inherited from Russell, and asks Tyler to repair it.\n\nTyler is fired from the garage when a car engine falls on [[Amy Williams (Neighbours)|Amy Williams]] ([[Zoe Cramond]]). His relationship with Mark suffers when Mark is accused of hurting Hamish. He later breaks up with Piper when T-Bone returns to town and he thinks she is cheating on him. Hamish's body is later found in the Cannings' spa. Tyler admits to his brothers that he argued with Hamish about his recent actions and involvement in Russell's death. He then struck him with a garden gnome, but Hamish was alive when Tyler left him. Tyler reunites with Piper and supports her through her panic attacks, following an incident on the boat, in which she was pushed overboard. Tyler confesses to the police about hitting Hamish and he is charged with manslaughter, but the charge is later upgraded to murder. The Brennans agree to sell the boat to pay for Tyler's legal defence, and various Ramsay Street residents buy shares in it. Tyler is approached by [[Adrian Snyder]] (Michael Vice), who explains that he is there on behalf of Philip Banks, an inmate at the prison Tyler will be sent to, who will make Tyler's arrival easy, but only if he did something in return. Adrian asks Tyler to seduce Philip's wife, [[List of Neighbours characters (2018)#Verity Banks|Verity]] (Simone Amman), to check that she is being unfaithful. Tyler goes through with the plan, but Verity knows that it is a trap as Philip has done it before. Verity tells Tyler that Mark was the police officer who had put her husband in prison.\n\nSnyder later poisons Piper's cat, Clementine and Tyler agrees to do another job. Snyder asks him to cut out a hole in the bottom of a van, so Banks can escape prison. However, Tyler fails to carry out the job when he finds Aaron has collapsed at the gym. Snyder dumps broken glass in the swimming pool at the Brennans' house, leading to Ben cutting his foot. The night before Tyler's trial, Piper arranges for them to stay in a hotel in the city. She then persuades him to go on the run with her, and they change their appearances. After hearing the police are on their way to them, Tyler and Piper go up to the roof and Tyler realises that he can jump over to the next building. He tells Piper that he has to leave her behind, but she tries to follow him and ends up hanging from the edge of the building. Tyler and a detective save her, and they are both arrested. At his trial, Tyler pleads guilty to murder. The judge sentences him to 20 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of ten years. When Piper visits him the following day, Tyler breaks up with her. After learning Banks is being released from solitary confinement, Tyler is persuaded to request a transfer and he says goodbye to his brothers, before being moved to a prison in Adelaide.\n\nAfter months of no contact, Piper receives a letter from Tyler, declaring his continued love for her but encouraging her to move on. She begins dating [[Cassius Grady]] (Joe Davidson), but it later emerges that Cassius is Tyler's half-brother, and the true killer of their father Hamish. When Cassius confesses, Tyler is transferred back to Melbourne for a hearing and granted release from prison. Piper and Tyler contemplate their future, but she admits that she is still in love with Cassius. Tyler visits Cassius and unleashes his anger at his half-brother, accusing him of stealing months of his life; soon after, Cassius is attacked by a fellow prisoner and Piper asks whether Tyler organised the attack, which he denies. Piper later apologises to Tyler and they kiss. But he tells her that too much has happened and he is not the same person anymore. Tyler decides to move to Adelaide for a fresh start.

Daniel Robinson and Paige Smith accuse Tyler of assaulting Imogen and they fight, causing them to be arrested. At the station, Tyler is reunited with his brother Mark. He moves in with Mark and gets a job at the local garage. Needing money to pay the rent, Tyler contemplates selling his bike, but is offered a job by Dennis Dimato. He is tasked with stripping Imogen's stolen car for parts, but he returns it anonymously, after agreeing to do a favour for Dimato. Tyler bonds with Imogen and he kisses Paige, but after she calls out his brother's name, they agree to be friends. Tyler steals a car for Dimato, but it is tracked by the police and Tyler is forced to hide while Dimato is arrested. Dimato purchases the garage to continue his operations and then flees the country. His partner Michelle Kim takes over his business and makes Tyler steal more cars. Imogen and Tyler go on a couple of dates, and Imogen decides to lose her virginity to him, but soon changes her mind.\n\nPaige's brother Bailey takes one of the stolen cars and when it is reclaimed, Michelle demands Paige and Tyler get her $8,000 or another car. Michelle also blackmails Paige into working with Tyler at the garage. Tyler develops feelings for Paige, but she is still in love with Mark; however, when he catches them working late at night, they are forced to tell him they are dating. Paige and Tyler try to make the garage a legitimate business in order to pay off their debts. Joey Dimato leaves them a bag of money that needs to be dropped off. Not wanting to be caught with it, they throw it down a well and retrieve it later. They discover some of the money has been stolen and Tyler is beaten. He refuses to go to the hospital and Paige gets him some painkillers. He tells his brother that he came off his bike. Tyler becomes dependent on the painkillers and steals Karl Kennedy's prescription pad to get more, causing tension between him and Nate Kinski. Mark contacts their brother Aaron and asks him to visit, knowing that he and Tyler are close.\n\nKarl discovers the missing prescriptions and Tyler confesses to taking them. He also admits to Mark that he has been working for Dimato. Mark arrests Tyler and asks him to leave the house. Nate persuades Karl to let Tyler stay with him. Tyler agrees to wear a wire and meet with Michelle, in return for the charges against him being dropped. When the wire is damaged, a second sting is organised, but Dimato returns and takes Tyler to a meeting at a warehouse. Tyler attempts to run away, but is quickly caught. Before he is harmed, Mark and the police arrive to arrest Dimato and his accomplices. Tyler attempts to tell Paige that he has feelings for her, but soon learns that she and Mark are back together. He befriends Karl's grandson Ben, but when Ben skips school to spend the day with him, Karl and [[Susan Kennedy|Susan]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]) tell Tyler to be more responsible. He decides to move home, but when he spots his father, Russell, in the street, he stays at the Men's Shed. Tyler then admits to Karl that Russell used to beat him. Russell eventually apologises to Tyler for his actions.\n\nTyler and Russell spend the day with Ben, and they bond when they play practical jokes on him. But when Russell loses his temper with Ben, Tyler is reminded of their past. Russell later goads Tyler and Tyler punches him. He then tells Mark about the abuse he endured when he was younger, and his brothers ask Russell to leave. Ben accidentally leaves the garage unlocked, leading to the theft of tools and Tyler's bike. Paige helps Tyler to find the stolen items and he kisses her, but Paige assures him that she loves his brother. Tyler helps Mark arrest the thief and he later meets the new owner of the garage [[Lucas Fitzgerald]] ([[Scott Major]]), who keeps him on as manager. Tyler is tasked with hiring another mechanic for the garage and he offers the job to [[Stephanie Scully]] ([[Carla Bonner]]). He later discovers Steph kidnapped Lucas' son while suffering from a psychotic break. Steph convinces him and Lucas she has changed and keeps her job. Tyler manipulates Paige and Mark into talking about having children, knowing Mark wants to be a father, but Paige is not ready. Aaron confronts him on his behaviour, realising he is trying to break them up. Tyler is trapped in a lift with Paige when a fire breaks out at Erinsborough High. He confesses his love for her, before passing out due to smoke inhalation. Paige gets Tyler breathing again and they are rescued by Mark. At the hospital, Tyler tells Paige that he plans to move on from her.\n\nTyler befriends [[Piper Willis]] (Mavournee Hazel) when she turns to him for advice. Piper develops a crush on Tyler and kisses him. He tells her nothing can happen, as she is too young for him. Piper's parents also warn him to stay away from her, after learning about the kiss. Imogen arranges a date with Tyler to get over Daniel. Piper admits that she has feelings for Tyler, but he tells her he would only bring her trouble and he begins dating [[Courtney Grixti]] (Emma Lane). They break up when Tyler feels that Courtney is trying to run his life. Imogen develops feelings for Tyler, so Tyler propositions her, as a ploy to get her to realise she wants to be with Daniel. Tyler confesses to the police that his interference with the Lassiter's boiler may have caused the explosion, but he is soon cleared as he did not touch the gas valve. Piper and Tyler grow closer and admit their feelings for each other. Tyler tells Piper that if they want to date, they need her parents' permission. Piper tells Tyler that Brad has given his blessing, and they agree to keep their relationship a secret, until [[Terese Willis|Terese]] ([[Rebekah Elmaloglou]]) gives hers. However, when Terese learns Piper plans to have sex with Tyler on the night of the school formal, she bans them from attending the dance together. Tyler breaks up with Piper, and he and Paige soon start a casual relationship.\n\nTyler and Piper become close again when he takes her to the beach to celebrate her birthday. He later rejects a kiss from her, before deciding that they should be together. However, he soon learns that she spent the night with [[Angus Beaumont-Hannay]] ([[Jai Waetford]]). Piper later tells Tyler that she is done with him. He then takes [[Tim Collins (Neighbours)|Tim Collins]]'s ([[Ben Anderson (actor)|Ben Anderson]]) car from the garage and crashes it. [[Simone Bader]] (Kahli Williams) offers to take the blame and Tyler agrees. He gives her $600 and lets her stay at the Men's Shed. He later tells Paige and Jack that he took the car and hands himself into the police. Tyler sells his half of the house to Mark to pay for the repairs to Tim's car. Tim asks Tyler to do a job for him in return for him not pressing charges, but Tyler refuses. He later learns Tim has changed his mind, as Piper has blackmailed him. Tyler and Piper reconcile at Brad and Lauren's wedding. Brad and Terese refuse to support the relationship, due to Piper's age. When Brad attacks Tyler, he and Piper drive off together. Mark and Ned find them at a motel in Glenrowan, and Tyler persuades Piper to return home. Tyler loses his job at the garage. [[Leo Tanaka]] (Tim Kano) invites him and Piper to move into his backpackers hostel. They struggle financially, until Tyler gets a job at a bar in the city. Weeks later, he is fired, but he manages to convince Lucas to give him his job back at the garage.\n\nTyler feels insecure when he sees Piper bonding with backpacker [[T-Bone (Neighbours)|T-Bone]] (Des Flanagan) and later fights with him. Piper is injured after a ute crashes into the hostel and Tyler initially believes T-Bone was responsible. With [[Mishti Sharma]]'s (Scarlet Vas) help, he finds T-Bone in the city and attacks him. Piper decides to return home while she recovers, while Tyler moves back in with his brothers. Their mother [[Fay Brennan]] ([[Zoe Bertram]]) comes to visit, and she apologises to Tyler for leaving him and his brothers with Russell and for the abuse he suffered. Fay later tells Tyler, Mark and Aaron that their father, Russell is seriously ill and wants to see them. However, before they set off for the airport, Fay learns that Russell has died. Mishti strikes Tyler with her car, leaving him with severe bruising. Shortly after returning from Russell's funeral, Sheila tells Mark, Aaron and Tyler that one of them is not Russell's son. Fay then returns to explain that Tyler was born after she had an affair with [[Hamish Roche]] (Sean Taylor). Tyler struggles with the revelation. Hamish soon comes to Erinsborough to meet Tyler, who is encouraged to spend time with him by Mark. Hamish persuades Tyler and Aaron not to sell the boat they inherited from Russell, and asks Tyler to repair it.\n\nTyler is fired from the garage when a car engine falls on [[Amy Williams (Neighbours)|Amy Williams]] ([[Zoe Cramond]]). His relationship with Mark suffers when Mark is accused of hurting Hamish. He later breaks up with Piper when T-Bone returns to town and he thinks she is cheating on him. Hamish's body is later found in the Cannings' spa. Tyler admits to his brothers that he argued with Hamish about his recent actions and involvement in Russell's death. He then struck him with a garden gnome, but Hamish was alive when Tyler left him. Tyler reunites with Piper and supports her through her panic attacks, following an incident on the boat, in which she was pushed overboard. Tyler confesses to the police about hitting Hamish and he is charged with manslaughter, but the charge is later upgraded to murder. The Brennans agree to sell the boat to pay for Tyler's legal defence, and various Ramsay Street residents buy shares in it. Tyler is approached by [[Adrian Snyder]] (Michael Vice), who explains that he is there on behalf of Philip Banks, an inmate at the prison Tyler will be sent to, who will make Tyler's arrival easy, but only if he did something in return. Adrian asks Tyler to seduce Philip's wife, [[List of Neighbours characters (2018)#Verity Banks|Verity]] (Simone Amman), to check that she is being unfaithful. Tyler goes through with the plan, but Verity knows that it is a trap as Philip has done it before. Verity tells Tyler that Mark was the police officer who had put her husband in prison.\n\nSnyder later poisons Piper's cat, Clementine and Tyler agrees to do another job. Snyder asks him to cut out a hole in the bottom of a van, so Banks can escape prison. However, Tyler fails to carry out the job when he finds Aaron has collapsed at the gym. Snyder dumps broken glass in the swimming pool at the Brennans' house, leading to Ben cutting his foot. The night before Tyler's trial, Piper arranges for them to stay in a hotel in the city. She then persuades him to go on the run with her, and they change their appearances. After hearing the police are on their way to them, Tyler and Piper go up to the roof and Tyler realises that he can jump over to the next building. He tells Piper that he has to leave her behind, but she tries to follow him and ends up hanging from the edge of the building. Tyler and a detective save her, and they are both arrested. At his trial, Tyler pleads guilty to murder. The judge sentences him to 20 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of ten years. When Piper visits him the following day, Tyler breaks up with her. After learning Banks is being released from solitary confinement, Tyler is persuaded to request a transfer and he says goodbye to his brothers, before being moved to a prison in Adelaide.\n\nAfter months of no contact, Piper receives a letter from Tyler, declaring his continued love for her but encouraging her to move on. She begins dating [[Cassius Grady]] (Joe Davidson), but it later emerges that Cassius is Tyler's half-brother, and the true killer of their father Hamish. When Cassius confesses, Tyler is transferred back to Melbourne for a hearing and granted release from prison. Piper and Tyler contemplate their future, but she admits that she is still in love with Cassius. Tyler visits Cassius and unleashes his anger at his half-brother, accusing him of stealing months of his life; soon after, Cassius is attacked by a fellow prisoner and Piper asks whether Tyler organised the attack, which he denies. Piper later apologises to Tyler and they kiss. But he tells her that too much has happened and he is not the same person anymore. Tyler decides to move to Adelaide for a fresh start. Months later, Piper turns up on Tyler's doorstep after leaving Erinsborough.\n\n==Reception==\nThe character has received a positive reception from television critics for being aesthetically pleasing.
