It consists of nine [[canto]]s and is exceptional in Bengali literature both in terms of style and content.

To thisthe  King  Porus answered that he wanted to be treated like a King.\n\nKing Porus A Legend Of Old is  based upon the true incident from history of India.There are 6 stanzas in this long na rrative poem . The first stanza begins with the image of raging storm., The poem ends with the images of volcano and earthquake.These images suggest that it is a wide scale tragedy.It brings forth issues that form a kind of moral to the tale.\nThe Queen  of Delhi's Dream is a tragic  poem by Michael Madhusudan Dutt. It  has been taken from ''The Captive Ladie'' (1849). It tells the story of the Rajput King [[Prithviraj Chauhan]]. In this  poem, the poet presents the  story of King's  abduction of the daughter of the  King of Kanauj and his unsuccessful battle with the  Muslim  invader [[Muhammad  Ghori]]. The poem ends with the  death of the King and his Queen.\n\n==Early life and education==\nHe was born in Sagordari, a village in [[Keshabpur Upazila]], [[Jessore District]] of [[Bengal|Undivided Bengal]] (now [[Bangladesh]]). His father was Rajnarayan Dutt, a pleader in the [[Sadr Diwani Adalat|Sadar court]],<ref name=\":4\" /> and his mother was Jahnabi Devi. He was an exceptionally talented student. Since his childhood, Dutt was recognised by his teachers and professors as being a precocious child with a gift of literary expression. He was very imaginative. Early exposure to English education and European literature at home and in [[Kolkata]] inspired him to emulate the English in taste, manners and intellect. An early influence was his teacher at [[Hindu College, Calcutta]], [[David Lester Richardson]]. Richardson was a poet and inspired in Dutt a love of English poetry, particularly [[Lord Byron|Byron]].\n\nDutt began writing English poetry aged around 17 years, sending his works to publications in England, including ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' and ''[[Bentley's Miscellany]]''. They were, however, never published.<ref name=\":12\"/> It was also the time he began correspondence with his friend, [[Gour Das Bysack]], which today form the bulk of the source on his life.\n\nAs a young student, Dutt was influenced by the thoughts and actions of the [[Young Bengal]] - a movement by a group of illustrious former students of the Hindu College (now [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Presidency College]]) in [[Calcutta]] (now Kolkata) against the atrocities, blind beliefs and customs they held as illogical, prevalent in the Hindu society of 19th century Bengal. Dutta, a student of Hindu College himself, aspired to be an English poet and longed to travel to England to gain fame. When his father, concerned by these trends, arranged his marriage, he rebelled. One aspect of his rebellion involved conversion to Christianity.\n\n===In his own words===\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\n\"Where man in all his truest glory lives,\nAnd nature's face is exquisitely sweet;\nFor those fair climes I heave impatient sigh,\nThere let me live and there let me die\".<ref name=\"Chakrabarty2001\">{{cite book|author=Dipesh Chakrabarty|title=Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference (New Edition)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqDa4tGENvYC&pg=PA33|accessdate=9 October 2012|date=15 February 2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13001-9|pages=33\u2013}}</ref>\n</poem>\n\nMadhusudan embraced Christianity<ref name=bpedia>{{cite book |last=Bhowmik |first=Dulal |year=2012 |chapter=Dutt, Michael Madhusudan |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Dutt,_Michael_Madhusudan |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> at the Old Mission Church in spite of the objections of his parents and relatives on 9 February 1843.

The Captive Ladie was published in 1849 and like Derozio's The Fakeer of Jungheera this is a long narrative poem in which it is difficult to sustain one's interest. In The Anglo- Saxon and the Hindu(1854), an essay in florid, even purple, prose which has references to and quotations from almost the whole of Macaulay's shelf of European books. He was greatly influenced by the works of [[William Wordsworth]] and [[John Milton]]. Dutt was a spirited [[bohemian]] and [[Romanticism|Romantic]].\nIn the fakeer of Jungheera the priest glorifies the custom of Sati and praise the widow who is going to burn herself with her dead husband.However,if we consider the chorus in the context of the complete narrative this as well as the chorus is steeply.\n\nDuring his stay in Madras, he published such works as ''King Porus'', ''The Captive Ladie'' (1849) - centered around [[Prithviraj Chauhan|King Prithviraj]]'s elopement with the princess of [[Kannauj|Kannuaj]]- and ''Visions of the Past.'' The Hurkaru, a prominent periodical at the time gave the self-published ''The Captive Ladie'' unfavourable reviews, and was in Madhusudan's own words, \"''was somewhat severe''\". [[John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune]], the then President of the Council of Education, was full of praise for the octosyllabic in his letter to [[Gour Das Bysack|Bysack]], and advised Dutt to \"employ the taste and talents, which he has cultivated by the study of English, in improving the standard, and adding to the stock of the poetry of his own language.\"\n\nUnder the [[pseudonym]], Timothy Penpoem, he published his poems in the periodicals he edited.\n\n=== Calcutta Years (1858-1862)<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> ===\nThe period during which he worked as a head clerk and later as the Chief Interpreter in the court, marked his transition to writing in his native Bengali, following the advice of [[John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune|Bethune]] and [[Gour Das Bysack|Bysack]]. He wrote 5 plays:  ''Sermista'' (1859)'', Padmavati'' (1859)'', Ekei Ki Boley Sabyata'' (1860), ''Krishna Kumari'' (1860) ''and Buro Shaliker Ghare Ron'' (1860). Then followed the narrative poems: ''Tilottama Sambhava Kavya'' (1861), ''Meghnad Badh Kavya'' (1861), ''Brajagana Kavya'' (1861) and ''Veerangana Kavya'' (1861). He also translated three plays from Bangla to English, including his own ''Sermista.''\n\n''[[Meghnad Badh Kavya]], The Slaying of Meghnad,'' the story of the final fight and demise of [[Meghnad Indrajit|Meghnad]], the eldest son of [[Ravana]], is unanimously hailed as his magnum opus, although his journey to publication and recognition was far from smooth. However, with its publication, he distinguished himself as a serious composer of an entirely new genre of heroic poetry, that was [[Homeric]] and [[Dante]]sque in technique and style, and yet so fundamentally native in theme. To cite the poet himself: \"''I awoke one morning and found myself famous''.\"  Nevertheless, it took a few years for this epic to win recognition all over the country.\n\n=== Final years (1866-1873)<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> ===\nA volume of his Bangla sonnets was published in 1866. His final play, ''Maya Kannan'', was written in 1872.

He composed a poem in honour of the poet, translated it into French and Italian, and sent it to the king of Italy.

It consists of nine [[canto]]s and is exceptional in Bengali literature both in terms of style and content. He also wrote poems about the sorrows and afflictions of love as spoken by women.\n\nDutta is widely considered to be one of the greatest poets in [[Bengali literature]] and the father of the Bengali [[sonnet]]. He pioneered what came to be called 'Amitrakshar chhanda' ([[blank verse]]). Although his first love remained poetry, Dutt showed prodigious skill as a playwright. He was the first to write Bengali plays in the English style, segregating the play into acts and scenes. He was also the pioneer of the first satirical plays in Bengali \u2013 ''Buro Shaliker Ghare Rnow'' (Bengali - \u09ac\u09c1\u09a1\u09bc\u09cb \u09b6\u09be\u09b2\u09bf\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u0998\u09be\u09a1\u09bc\u09c7 \u09b0\u09cb\u0981) and ''Ekei Ki B\u00f4le S\u00e4bhy\u00f4ta?''

Here Satan's beauty is stressed but obviously it is a faded beauty<br />\"King Poru\" is one of the well known poems based on a legendary  episode from  Indian history. The King Poru was caught by the military of King Alexander after winning the battle of the Hydaspes River. Alexander asked Porus how he wanted ueto be treated. To thisthe  King  Porus answered that he wanted to be treated like a King.\n\nKing Porus A Legend Of Old is  based upon the true incident from history of India.There are 6 stanzas in this long na rrative poem . The first stanza begins with the image of raging storm., The poem ends with the images of volcano and earthquake.These images suggest that it is a wide scale tragedy.It brings forth issues that form a kind of moral to the tale.\nThe Queen  of Delhi's Dream is the a tragic  poem by Michael Madhusudan Dutt. It  has been taken from ''The Captive Ladie'' (1849). It tells the story of the Rajput King [[Prithviraj Chauhan]]. In this  poem, the poet presents the  story of King's  abduction of the daughter of the  King of Kanauj and his unsuccessful battle with the  Muslim  invader [[Muhammad  Ghori]]. The poem ends with the  death of the King and his Queen.\n\n==Early life and education==\nHe was born in Sagordari, a village in [[Keshabpur Upazila]], [[Jessore District]] of [[Bengal|Undivided Bengal]] (now [[Bangladesh]]). His father was Rajnarayan Dutt, a pleader in the [[Sadr Diwani Adalat|Sadar court]],<ref name=\":4\" /> and his mother was Jahnabi Devi. He was an exceptionally talented student. Since his childhood, Dutt was recognised by his teachers and professors as being a precocious child with a gift of literary expression. He was very imaginative. Early exposure to English education and European literature at home and in [[Kolkata]] inspired him to emulate the English in taste, manners and intellect. An early influence was his teacher at [[Hindu College, Calcutta]], [[David Lester Richardson]]. Richardson was a poet and inspired in Dutt a love of English poetry, particularly [[Lord Byron|Byron]].\n\nDutt began writing English poetry aged around 17 years, sending his works to publications in England, including ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' and ''[[Bentley's Miscellany]]''. They were, however, never published.<ref name=\":12\"/> It was also the time he began correspondence with his friend, [[Gour Das Bysack]], which today form the bulk of the source on his life.\n\nAs a young student, Dutt was influenced by the thoughts and actions of the [[Young Bengal]] - a movement by a group of illustrious former students of the Hindu College (now [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Presidency College]]) in [[Calcutta]] (now Kolkata) against the atrocities, blind beliefs and customs they held as illogical, prevalent in the Hindu society of 19th century Bengal. Dutta, a student of Hindu College himself, aspired to be an English poet and longed to travel to England to gain fame. When his father, concerned by these trends, arranged his marriage, he rebelled. One aspect of his rebellion involved conversion to Christianity.\n\n===In his own words===\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\n\"Where man in all his truest glory lives,\nAnd nature's face is exquisitely sweet;\nFor those fair climes I heave impatient sigh,\nThere let me live and there let me die\".<ref name=\"Chakrabarty2001\">{{cite book|author=Dipesh Chakrabarty|title=Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference (New Edition)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqDa4tGENvYC&pg=PA33|accessdate=9 October 2012|date=15 February 2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13001-9|pages=33\u2013}}</ref>\n</poem>\n\nMadhusudan embraced Christianity<ref name=bpedia>{{cite book |last=Bhowmik |first=Dulal |year=2012 |chapter=Dutt, Michael Madhusudan |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Dutt,_Michael_Madhusudan |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> at the Old Mission Church in spite of the objections of his parents and relatives on 9 February 1843.

The Captive Ladie was published in 1849 and like Derozio's The Fakeer of Jungheera this is a long narrative poem in which it is difficult to sustain one's interest. In The Anglo- Saxon and the Hindu(1854), an essay in florid, even purple, prose which has references to and quotations from almost the whole of Macaulay's shelf of European books. He was greatly influenced by the works of [[William Wordsworth]] and [[John Milton]]. Dutt was a spirited [[bohemian]] and [[Romanticism|Romantic]].\nIn the fakeer of Jungheera the priest glorifies the custom of Sati and praise the widow who is going to burn herself with her dead husband.However,if we consider the chorus in the context of the complete narrative this as well as the chorus is steeply.\n\nDuring his stay in Madras, he published such works as ''King Porus'', ''The Captive Ladie'' (1849) - centered around [[Prithviraj Chauhan|King Prithviraj]]'s elopement with the princess of [[Kannauj|Kannuaj]]- and ''Visions of the Past.'' The Hurkaru, a prominent periodical at the time gave the self-published ''The Captive Ladie'' unfavourable reviews, and was in Madhusudan's own words, \"''was somewhat severe''\". [[John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune]], the then President of the Council of Education, was full of praise for the octosyllabic in his letter to [[Gour Das Bysack|Bysack]], and advised Dutt to \"employ the taste and talents, which he has cultivated by the study of English, in improving the standard, and adding to the stock of the poetry of his own language.\"\n\nUnder the [[pseudonym]], Timothy Penpoem, he published his poems in the periodicals he edited.\n\n=== Calcutta Years (1858-1862)<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> ===\nThe period during which he worked as a head clerk and later as the Chief Interpreter in the court, marked his transition to writing in his native Bengali, following the advice of [[John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune|Bethune]] and [[Gour Das Bysack|Bysack]]. He wrote 5 plays:  ''Sermista'' (1859)'', Padmavati'' (1859)'', Ekei Ki Boley Sabyata'' (1860), ''Krishna Kumari'' (1860) ''and Buro Shaliker Ghare Ron'' (1860). Then followed the narrative poems: ''Tilottama Sambhava Kavya'' (1861), ''Meghnad Badh Kavya'' (1861), ''Brajagana Kavya'' (1861) and ''Veerangana Kavya'' (1861). He also translated three plays from Bangla to English, including his own ''Sermista.''\n\n''[[Meghnad Badh Kavya]], The Slaying of Meghnad,'' the story of the final fight and demise of [[Meghnad Indrajit|Meghnad]], the eldest son of [[Ravana]], is unanimously hailed as his magnum opus, although his journey to publication and recognition was far from smooth. However, with its publication, he distinguished himself as a serious composer of an entirely new genre of heroic poetry, that was [[Homeric]] and [[Dante]]sque in technique and style, and yet so fundamentally native in theme. To cite the poet himself: \"''I awoke one morning and found myself famous''.\"  Nevertheless, it took a few years for this epic to win recognition all over the country.\n\n=== Final years (1866-1873)<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> ===\nA volume of his Bangla sonnets was published in 1866.

In the human [[embryo]], the [[hepatic diverticulum]] is the tube of endoderm that extends out from the foregut into the surrounding mesenchyme. The mesenchyme of septum transversum induces this endoderm to proliferate, to branch, and to form the glandular epithelium of the liver. A portion of the hepatic diverticulum (that region closest to the digestive tube) continues to function as the [[Biliary tract|drainage duct]] of the liver, and a branch from this duct produces the [[gallbladder]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Gilbert SF | title = Developmental Biology | edition = 6th | publisher = Sinauer Associates | year = 2000 | location = Sunderland (MA) | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10107/#A3752 | access-date = 2017-09-04 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171218061140/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10107/#A3752 | archive-date = 2017-12-18 | url-status = live }}</ref> Besides signals from the septum transversum mesenchyme, [[fibroblast growth factor]] from the [[Heart development|developing heart]] also contributes to hepatic competence, along with [[retinoic acid]] emanating from the [[lateral plate mesoderm]].

The liver bud separates into the lobes. The left [[umbilical vein]] becomes the [[ductus venosus]] and the right [[Vitelline veins|vitelline vein]] becomes the [[portal vein]]. The expanding liver bud is colonized by [[Hematopoietic stem cell|hematopoietic cells]]. The bipotential hepatoblasts begin differentiating into [[Cholangiocyte|biliary epithelial cells]] and [[hepatocyte]]s. The biliary epithelial cells differentiate from hepatoblasts around portal veins, first producing a monolayer, and then a bilayer of cuboidal cells. In ductal plate, focal dilations emerge at points in the bilayer, become surrounded by portal mesenchyme, and undergo tubulogenesis into intrahepatic bile ducts. Hepatoblasts not adjacent to portal veins instead differentiate into hepatocytes and arrange into cords lined by sinudoidal epithelial cells and bile canaliculi. Once hepatoblasts are specified into hepatocytes and undergo further expansion, they begin acquiring the functions of a mature hepatocyte, and eventually mature hepatocytes appear as highly polarized epithelial cells with abundant [[glycogen]] accumulation. In the adult liver, hepatocytes are not equivalent, with position along the portocentrovenular axis within a [[Lobules of liver|liver lobule]] dictating expression of metabolic genes involved in drug metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, ammonia detoxification, and bile production and secretion. [[Wnt signaling pathway|WNT/\u03b2-catenin]] has now been identified to be playing a key role in this phenomenon.<ref name=\"pmid21337461\"/>\n\nAt birth, the liver comprises roughly 4% of body weight and weighs on average about {{convert|120|g|oz|0|abbr=on}}. Over the course of further development, it will increase to {{convert|1.4|\u2013|1.6|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}} but will only take up 2.5\u20133.5% of body weight.<ref>{{cite book | title=Anatomy a Regional Atlas of the Human Body | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | author=Clemente, Carmin D. | year=2011 | location=Philadelphia | page=243 | isbn=978-1-58255-889-9}}</ref>\n\n===Fetal blood supply===\nIn the growing fetus, a major source of blood to the liver is the [[umbilical vein]], which supplies nutrients to the growing fetus. The umbilical vein enters the abdomen at the umbilicus and passes upward along the free margin of the falciform ligament of the liver to the inferior surface of the liver. There, it joins with the left branch of the portal vein. The [[ductus venosus]] carries blood from the left portal vein to the left hepatic vein and then to the [[inferior vena cava]], allowing placental blood to bypass the liver.\n\nIn the fetus, the liver does not perform the normal digestive processes and filtration of the infant liver because nutrients are received directly from the mother via the [[placenta]]. The fetal liver releases some blood stem cells that migrate to the fetal [[thymus]], creating the [[T-cells]] or T-lymphocytes. After birth, the formation of blood stem cells shifts to the red [[bone marrow]].\n\nAfter 2\u20135 days, the umbilical vein and ductus venosus are completely obliterated; the former becomes the [[round ligament of liver]] and the latter becomes the [[ligamentum venosum]].  In the [[medical disorder|disorders]] of [[cirrhosis]] and [[portal hypertension]], the umbilical vein can open up again.\n\n==Functions==\nThe various functions of the liver are carried out by the liver cells or hepatocytes. The liver is thought to be responsible for up to 500 separate functions, usually in combination with other systems and organs. Currently, no [[artificial organ]] or device is capable of reproducing all the functions of the liver.  Some functions can be carried out by [[liver dialysis]], an experimental treatment for [[liver failure]]. The liver also accounts for about 20% of resting total body oxygen consumption.\n\n===Blood supply===\n[[File:Liver veins.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Liver veins]]\nThe liver receives a dual blood supply from the hepatic portal vein and hepatic arteries. The hepatic portal vein delivers around 75% of the liver's blood supply and carries [[venous blood]] drained from the [[spleen]], [[gastrointestinal tract]], and its associated organs. The hepatic arteries supply arterial blood to the liver, accounting for the remaining quarter of its [[blood flow]]. Oxygen is provided from both sources; about half of the liver's oxygen demand is met by the hepatic portal vein, and half is met by the hepatic arteries.<ref name=\"isbn1-55009-364-9\">{{cite book |author1=Shneider, Benjamin L. |author2=Sherman, Philip M. |title=Pediatric Gastrointestinal Disease |publisher=PMPH-USA|location=Connecticut |year=2008 |page=751 |isbn=978-1-55009-364-3 }}</ref> The hepatic artery also has both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors; therefore, flow through the artery is controlled, in part, by the splanchnic nerves of the autonomic nervous system.\n\nBlood flows through the liver sinusoids and empties into the central vein of each lobule.  The [[Central veins of liver|central veins]] coalesce into hepatic veins, which leave the liver and drain into the inferior vena cava.<ref name=Human/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Biliary flow===\n{{Main |Enterohepatic circulation}}\n[[File:Diagram showing the position of the perihilar bile ducts CRUK 357.svg|thumb|240px|Biliary tract]]\nThe [[biliary tract]] is derived from the branches of the bile ducts. The biliary tract, also known as the biliary tree, is the path by which bile is secreted by the liver then transported to the first part of the small intestine, the [[duodenum]]. The [[bile]] produced in the liver is collected in [[bile canaliculi]], small grooves between the faces of adjacent hepatocytes. The canaliculi radiate to the edge of the liver lobule, where they merge to form bile ducts. Within the liver, these ducts are termed intrahepatic bile ducts, and once they exit the liver, they are considered extrahepatic. The intrahepatic ducts eventually drain into the right and left [[hepatic duct]]s, which exit the liver at the [[Porta hepatis|transverse fissure]], and merge to form the [[common hepatic duct]]. The [[cystic duct]] from the gallbladder joins with the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct.<ref name=Human/> The biliary system and connective tissue is supplied by the hepatic artery alone\n\nBile either drains directly into the duodenum via the common bile duct, or is temporarily stored in the gallbladder via the cystic duct. The common bile duct and the pancreatic duct enter the second part of the duodenum together at the hepatopancreatic ampulla, also known as the [[ampulla of Vater]].\n\n===Synthesis===\n{{Further|Proteins produced and secreted by the liver}}\nThe liver plays a major role in carbohydrate, protein, amino acid, and lipid metabolism.\n\nThe liver performs several roles in [[carbohydrate metabolism]]: The liver synthesizes and stores around 100 g of [[glycogen]] via [[glycogenesis]], the formation of glycogen from glucose. When needed, the liver releases glucose into the blood by performing [[glycogenolysis]], the breakdown of [[glycogen]] into [[glucose]].<ref name=\"Phys\">{{cite book|title=Human Anatomy & Physiology + New Masteringa&p With Pearson Etext|date=2012|publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Pub Co|isbn=9780321852120|page=939}}</ref> The liver is also responsible for [[gluconeogenesis]], which is the synthesis of glucose from certain [[amino acid]]s, [[lactic acid|lactate]], or [[glycerol]]. Adipose and liver cells produce glycerol by [[lipolysis|breakdown of fat]], which the liver uses for gluconeogenesis.<ref name=Phys/>\n\nThe liver is responsible for the mainstay of protein [[metabolism]], synthesis as well as degradation. It is also responsible for a large part of [[amino acid synthesis]]. The liver plays a role in the production of clotting factors, as well as red blood cell production. Some of the proteins synthesized by the liver include [[coagulation factors]] [[fibrinogen|I]] (fibrinogen), [[thrombin|II]] (prothrombin), [[factor V|V]], [[factor VII|VII]], [[factor VIII|VIII]], [[factor IX|IX]], [[factor X|X]], [[factor XI|XI]], [[factor XII|XII]], [[factor XIII|XIII]], as well as [[protein C]], [[protein S]] and [[antithrombin]]. In the first trimester [[fetus]], the liver is the main site of [[red blood cell]] production. By the 32nd week of [[gestation]], the [[bone marrow]] has almost completely taken over that task. The liver is a major site of production for [[thrombopoietin]], a [[glycoprotein]] hormone that regulates the production of [[platelet]]s by the [[bone marrow]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jelkmann |first1=Wolfgang |title=The role of the liver in the production of thrombopoietin compared with erythropoietin |journal=European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology |volume=13 |issue=7 |pages=791\u2013801 |year=2001 |pmid=11474308 |doi=10.1097/00042737-200107000-00006}}</ref>\n\nThe liver plays several roles in [[lipid]] metabolism: it performs [[cholesterol]] synthesis, [[lipogenesis]], and the production of [[triglyceride]]s, and a bulk of the body's lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver.\n\nThe liver plays a key role in digestion, as it produces and excretes [[bile]] (a yellowish liquid) required for emulsifying fats and help the absorption of vitamin K from the diet. Some of the bile drains directly into the duodenum, and some is stored in the gallbladder.\n\nThe liver also produces [[insulin-like growth factor 1]], a [[polypeptide]] [[protein]] hormone that plays an important role in childhood growth and continues to have [[anabolism|anabolic effects]] in adults.\n\n===Breakdown===\nThe liver is responsible for the breakdown of [[insulin]] and other [[hormone]]s. The liver breaks down [[bilirubin]] via [[glucuronidation]], facilitating its excretion into bile.\nThe liver is responsible for the breakdown and excretion of many waste products. It plays a key role in breaking down or modifying [[toxic]] substances (e.g., [[methylation]]) and most medicinal products in a process called [[drug metabolism]]. This sometimes results in [[toxication]], when the metabolite is more toxic than its precursor. Preferably, the toxins are [[Xenobiotic conjugation|conjugated]] to avail excretion in bile or urine. The liver converts [[ammonia]] into [[urea]] as part of the [[urea cycle]], and the urea is excreted in the urine.<ref name=Anatomy/>\n\n=== Blood reservoir===\n{{Unsourced section|date=January 2020}}\nBecause the liver is an expandable organ, large quantities of\nblood can be stored in its blood vessels. Its normal blood\nvolume, including both that in the hepatic veins and that in\nthe hepatic sinuses, is about 450 milliliters, or almost 10 percent of the body's total blood volume. When high pressure\nin the right atrium causes backpressure in the liver, the liver\nexpands, and 0.5 to 1 liter of extra blood is occasionally stored\nin the hepatic veins and sinuses. This occurs especially in cardiac failure with peripheral congestion. Thus, in effect, the liver is a large, expandable,\nvenous organ capable of acting as a valuable blood reservoir\nin times of excess blood volume and capable of supplying\nextra blood in times of diminished blood volume\n\n=== Lymph production===\nBecause the pores in the hepatic sinusoids are very permeable and allow ready passage of both fluid and proteins into the spaces of Disse, the lymph draining from the liver usually has a protein concentration of about 6 g/dl, which is only\nslightly less than the protein concentration of plasma. Also,\nthe high permeability of the liver sinusoid epithelium allows\nlarge quantities of lymph to form. Therefore, about half of\nall the lymph formed in the body under resting conditions\narises in the liver.\n\n===Other===\n* The liver stores a multitude of substances, including glucose (in the form of [[glycogen]]), [[vitamin A]] (1\u20132 years' supply), [[vitamin D]] (1\u20134 months' supply){{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}, [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] (3\u20135 years' supply),<ref>{{cite web|title=If a person stops consuming the vitamin, the body's stores of this vitamin usually take about 3 to 5 years to exhaust|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders-of-nutrition/vitamins/vitamin-b-12|access-date=2016-06-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623000150/http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders-of-nutrition/vitamins/vitamin-b-12|archive-date=2016-06-23|url-status=live}}</ref> [[vitamin K]], [[iron]], and [[copper]].\n* The liver is responsible for immunological effects&nbsp;\u2013 the [[mononuclear phagocyte system]] of the liver contains many immunologically active cells, acting as a 'sieve' for antigens carried to it via the [[Hepatic portal system|portal system]].\n* The liver produces [[albumin]], the most abundant protein in [[Blood plasma|blood serum]]. It is essential in the maintenance of [[oncotic pressure]], and acts as a transport for [[fatty acid]]s and [[steroid hormone]]s.\n* The liver synthesizes [[angiotensinogen]], a hormone that is responsible for raising the [[blood pressure]] when activated by [[renin]], an enzyme that is released when the [[juxtaglomerular apparatus|kidney]] senses [[Hypotension|low blood pressure]].\n* The liver produces the enzyme catalase in order to break down hydrogen peroxide, a very toxic substance due to it being a powerful oxidising agent, into water and oxygen.\n\n===With aging===\nThe oxidative capacity of the liver decreases with aging and therefore any medications that require oxidation (for instance, [[benzodiazepines]]) are more likely to accumulate to toxic levels. However, medications with shorter [[half-life|half-lives]], such as [[lorazepam]] and [[oxazepam]], are preferred in most cases when benzodiazepines are required in regard to geriatric medicine.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n\n===Disease===\n{{Main|Liver disease}}\n[[File:Big Liver Tumor.JPG|right|thumb| Left lobe liver tumor]]\n\nThe liver is a vital organ and supports almost every other organ in the body.

This can lead to scarring ([[fibrosis]]) and [[cirrhosis]]. Cirrhosis increases the resistance to blood flow in the liver, and can result in [[portal hypertension]]. [[Portacaval anastomosis|Congested anastomoses]] between the [[portal venous system]] and the systemic circulation, can be a subsequent condition.\n\nMany diseases of the liver are accompanied by [[jaundice]] caused by increased levels of [[bilirubin]] in the system. The bilirubin results from the breakup of the [[Haemoglobin|hemoglobin]] of dead [[red blood cell]]s; normally, the liver removes bilirubin from the blood and excretes it through bile.\n\nThere are also many pediatric liver diseases, including [[biliary atresia]], [[alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency]], [[alagille syndrome]], [[progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis]], [[Langerhans cell histiocytosis]] and [[cavernous liver haemangioma|hepatic hemangioma]] a [[benign tumour]] the most common type of liver tumour, thought to be congenital. A genetic disorder causing multiple cysts to form in the liver tissue, usually in later life, and usually asymptomatic, is [[polycystic liver disease]]. Diseases that interfere with liver function will lead to derangement of these processes. However, the liver has a great capacity to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] and has a large reserve capacity. In most cases, the liver only produces symptoms after extensive damage.\n\n[[Hepatomegaly]] refers to an enlarged liver and can be due to many causes. It can be [[palpated]] in a [[liver span]] measurement.\n\nLiver diseases may be diagnosed by [[liver function tests]]\u2013blood tests that can identify various markers. For example, [[Acute-phase protein|acute-phase reactants]] are produced by the liver in response to injury or inflammation.\n\n===Symptoms===\nThe classic symptoms of liver damage include the following:\n* Pale stools occur when [[stercobilin]], a brown pigment, is absent from the stool. Stercobilin is derived from bilirubin metabolites produced in the liver.\n* Dark urine occurs when bilirubin mixes with urine\n* Jaundice (yellow skin and/or whites of the eyes) This is where [[bilirubin]] deposits in skin, causing an intense [[itch]]. Itching is the most common complaint by people who have liver failure. Often this itch cannot be relieved by drugs.\n* [[Ascites|Swelling of the abdomen]], and [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of the ankles and feet occurs because the [[Hypoalbuminemia|liver fails to make albumin]].\n* Excessive fatigue occurs from a [[Deficiency (medicine)|generalized loss of nutrients]], [[dietary mineral|minerals]] and vitamins.\n* [[bruise|Bruising]] and easy bleeding are other features of liver disease. The liver makes [[Coagulation|clotting factors]], substances which help prevent bleeding. When liver damage occurs, these factors are no longer present and severe bleeding can occur.<ref>[http://www.ccfa.org/info/about/complications/liver Extraintestinal Complications: Liver Disease] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121034708/http://ccfa.org/info/about/complications/liver |date=2010-11-21 }} Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America.

Most transplants are done for chronic liver diseases leading to [[cirrhosis]], such as chronic [[hepatitis C]], [[alcoholism]], and autoimmune hepatitis. Less commonly, liver transplantation is done for [[fulminant hepatic failure]], in which liver failure occurs over days to weeks.\n\nLiver [[allograft]]s for [[organ transplantation|transplant]] usually come from donors who have died from fatal [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injury]]. [[Living donor liver transplantation]] is a technique in which a portion of a living person's liver is removed ([[hepatectomy]]) and used to replace the entire liver of the recipient.  This was first performed in 1989 for pediatric liver transplantation.  Only 20 percent of an adult's liver (Couinaud segments 2 and 3) is needed to serve as a liver allograft for an infant or small child.\n\nMore recently,{{when|date=August 2018}} adult-to-adult liver transplantation has been done using the donor's right hepatic lobe, which amounts to 60 percent of the liver.  Due to the ability of the liver to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]], both the donor and recipient end up with normal liver function if all goes well. This procedure is more controversial, as it entails performing a much larger operation on the donor, and indeed there were at least two donor deaths out of the first several hundred cases.

The liver bud separates into the lobes. The left [[umbilical vein]] becomes the [[ductus venosus]] and the right [[Vitelline veins|vitelline vein]] becomes the [[portal vein]]. The expanding liver bud is colonized by [[Hematopoietic stem cell|hematopoietic cells]]. The bipotential hepatoblasts begin differentiating into [[Cholangiocyte|biliary epithelial cells]] and [[hepatocyte]]s. The biliary epithelial cells differentiate from hepatoblasts around portal veins, first producing a monolayer, and then a bilayer of cuboidal cells. In ductal plate, focal dilations emerge at points in the bilayer, become surrounded by portal mesenchyme, and undergo tubulogenesis into intrahepatic bile ducts. Hepatoblasts not adjacent to portal veins instead differentiate into hepatocytes and arrange into cords lined by sinudoidal epithelial cells and bile canaliculi. Once hepatoblasts are specified into hepatocytes and undergo further expansion, they begin acquiring the functions of a mature hepatocyte, and eventually mature hepatocytes appear as highly polarized epithelial cells with abundant [[glycogen]] accumulation. In the adult liver, hepatocytes are not equivalent, with position along the portocentrovenular axis within a [[Lobules of liver|liver lobule]] dictating expression of metabolic genes involved in drug metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, ammonia detoxification, and bile production and secretion.

The umbilical vein enters the abdomen at the umbilicus and passes upward along the free margin of the falciform ligament of the liver to the inferior surface of the liver. There, it joins with the left branch of the portal vein. The [[ductus venosus]] carries blood from the left portal vein to the left hepatic vein and then to the [[inferior vena cava]], allowing placental blood to bypass the liver.\n\nIn the fetus, the liver does not perform the normal digestive processes and filtration of the infant liver because nutrients are received directly from the mother via the [[placenta]]. The fetal liver releases some blood stem cells that migrate to the fetal [[thymus]], creating the [[T-cells]] or T-lymphocytes. After birth, the formation of blood stem cells shifts to the red [[bone marrow]].\n\nAfter 2\u20135 days, the umbilical vein and ductus venosus are completely obliterated; the former becomes the [[round ligament of liver]] and the latter becomes the [[ligamentum venosum]].  In the [[medical disorder|disorders]] of [[cirrhosis]] and [[portal hypertension]], the umbilical vein can open up again.\n\n==Functions==\nThe various functions of the liver are carried out by the liver cells or hepatocytes. The liver is thought to be responsible for up to 500 separate functions, usually in combination with other systems and organs. Currently, no [[artificial organ]] or device is capable of reproducing all the functions of the liver.  Some functions can be carried out by [[liver dialysis]], an experimental treatment for [[liver failure]]. The liver also accounts for about 20% of resting total body oxygen consumption.\n\n===Blood supply===\n[[File:Liver veins.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Liver veins]]\nThe liver receives a dual blood supply from the hepatic portal vein and hepatic arteries. The hepatic portal vein delivers around 75% of the liver's blood supply and carries [[venous blood]] drained from the [[spleen]], [[gastrointestinal tract]], and its associated organs. The hepatic arteries supply arterial blood to the liver, accounting for the remaining quarter of its [[blood flow]]. Oxygen is provided from both sources; about half of the liver's oxygen demand is met by the hepatic portal vein, and half is met by the hepatic arteries.<ref name=\"isbn1-55009-364-9\">{{cite book |author1=Shneider, Benjamin L. |author2=Sherman, Philip M. |title=Pediatric Gastrointestinal Disease |publisher=PMPH-USA|location=Connecticut |year=2008 |page=751 |isbn=978-1-55009-364-3 }}</ref> The hepatic artery also has both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors; therefore, flow through the artery is controlled, in part, by the splanchnic nerves of the autonomic nervous system.\n\nBlood flows through the liver sinusoids and empties into the central vein of each lobule.

The biliary tract, also known as the biliary tree, is the path by which bile is secreted by the liver then transported to the first part of the small intestine, the [[duodenum]]. The [[bile]] produced in the liver is collected in [[bile canaliculi]], small grooves between the faces of adjacent hepatocytes. The canaliculi radiate to the edge of the liver lobule, where they merge to form bile ducts. Within the liver, these ducts are termed intrahepatic bile ducts, and once they exit the liver, they are considered extrahepatic. The intrahepatic ducts eventually drain into the right and left [[hepatic duct]]s, which exit the liver at the [[Porta hepatis|transverse fissure]], and merge to form the [[common hepatic duct]]. The [[cystic duct]] from the gallbladder joins with the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct.<ref name=Human/> The biliary system and connective tissue is supplied by the hepatic artery alone\n\nBile either drains directly into the duodenum via the common bile duct, or is temporarily stored in the gallbladder via the cystic duct. The common bile duct and the pancreatic duct enter the second part of the duodenum together at the hepatopancreatic ampulla, also known as the [[ampulla of Vater]].\n\n===Synthesis===\n{{Further|Proteins produced and secreted by the liver}}\nThe liver plays a major role in carbohydrate, protein, amino acid, and lipid metabolism.\n\nThe liver performs several roles in [[carbohydrate metabolism]]: The liver synthesizes and stores around 100 g of [[glycogen]] via [[glycogenesis]], the formation of glycogen from glucose. When needed, the liver releases glucose into the blood by performing [[glycogenolysis]], the breakdown of [[glycogen]] into [[glucose]].<ref name=\"Phys\">{{cite book|title=Human Anatomy & Physiology + New Masteringa&p With Pearson Etext|date=2012|publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Pub Co|isbn=9780321852120|page=939}}</ref> The liver is also responsible for [[gluconeogenesis]], which is the synthesis of glucose from certain [[amino acid]]s, [[lactic acid|lactate]], or [[glycerol]]. Adipose and liver cells produce glycerol by [[lipolysis|breakdown of fat]], which the liver uses for gluconeogenesis.<ref name=Phys/>\n\nThe liver is responsible for the mainstay of protein [[metabolism]], synthesis as well as degradation. It is also responsible for a large part of [[amino acid synthesis]]. The liver plays a role in the production of clotting factors, as well as red blood cell production. Some of the proteins synthesized by the liver include [[coagulation factors]] [[fibrinogen|I]] (fibrinogen), [[thrombin|II]] (prothrombin), [[factor V|V]], [[factor VII|VII]], [[factor VIII|VIII]], [[factor IX|IX]], [[factor X|X]], [[factor XI|XI]], [[factor XII|XII]], [[factor XIII|XIII]], as well as [[protein C]], [[protein S]] and [[antithrombin]]. In the first trimester [[fetus]], the liver is the main site of [[red blood cell]] production. By the 32nd week of [[gestation]], the [[bone marrow]] has almost completely taken over that task. The liver is a major site of production for [[thrombopoietin]], a [[glycoprotein]] hormone that regulates the production of [[platelet]]s by the [[bone marrow]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jelkmann |first1=Wolfgang |title=The role of the liver in the production of thrombopoietin compared with erythropoietin |journal=European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology |volume=13 |issue=7 |pages=791\u2013801 |year=2001 |pmid=11474308 |doi=10.1097/00042737-200107000-00006}}</ref>\n\nThe liver plays several roles in [[lipid]] metabolism: it performs [[cholesterol]] synthesis, [[lipogenesis]], and the production of [[triglyceride]]s, and a bulk of the body's lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver.\n\nThe liver plays a key role in digestion, as it produces and excretes [[bile]] (a yellowish liquid) required for emulsifying fats and help the absorption of vitamin K from the diet. Some of the bile drains directly into the duodenum, and some is stored in the gallbladder.\n\nThe liver also produces [[insulin-like growth factor 1]], a [[polypeptide]] [[protein]] hormone that plays an important role in childhood growth and continues to have [[anabolism|anabolic effects]] in adults.\n\n===Breakdown===\nThe liver is responsible for the breakdown of [[insulin]] and other [[hormone]]s. The liver breaks down [[bilirubin]] via [[glucuronidation]], facilitating its excretion into bile.\nThe liver is responsible for the breakdown and excretion of many waste products. It plays a key role in breaking down or modifying [[toxic]] substances (e.g., [[methylation]]) and most medicinal products in a process called [[drug metabolism]]. This sometimes results in [[toxication]], when the metabolite is more toxic than its precursor. Preferably, the toxins are [[Xenobiotic conjugation|conjugated]] to avail excretion in bile or urine. The liver converts [[ammonia]] into [[urea]] as part of the [[urea cycle]], and the urea is excreted in the urine.<ref name=Anatomy/>\n\n=== Blood reservoir===\n{{Unsourced section|date=January 2020}}\nBecause the liver is an expandable organ, large quantities of\nblood can be stored in its blood vessels. Its normal blood\nvolume, including both that in the hepatic veins and that in\nthe hepatic sinuses, is about 450 milliliters, or almost 10 percent of the body's total blood volume. When high pressure\nin the right atrium causes backpressure in the liver, the liver\nexpands, and 0.5 to 1 liter of extra blood is occasionally stored\nin the hepatic veins and sinuses. This occurs especially in cardiac failure with peripheral congestion. Thus, in effect, the liver is a large, expandable,\nvenous organ capable of acting as a valuable blood reservoir\nin times of excess blood volume and capable of supplying\nextra blood in times of diminished blood volume\n\n=== Lymph production===\nBecause the pores in the hepatic sinusoids are very permeable and allow ready passage of both fluid and proteins into the spaces of Disse, the lymph draining from the liver usually has a protein concentration of about 6 g/dl, which is only\nslightly less than the protein concentration of plasma. Also,\nthe high permeability of the liver sinusoid epithelium allows\nlarge quantities of lymph to form. Therefore, about half of\nall the lymph formed in the body under resting conditions\narises in the liver.\n\n===Other===\n* The liver stores a multitude of substances, including glucose (in the form of [[glycogen]]), [[vitamin A]] (1\u20132 years' supply), [[vitamin D]] (1\u20134 months' supply){{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}, [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] (3\u20135 years' supply),<ref>{{cite web|title=If a person stops consuming the vitamin, the body's stores of this vitamin usually take about 3 to 5 years to exhaust|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders-of-nutrition/vitamins/vitamin-b-12|access-date=2016-06-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623000150/http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders-of-nutrition/vitamins/vitamin-b-12|archive-date=2016-06-23|url-status=live}}</ref> [[vitamin K]], [[iron]], and [[copper]].\n* The liver is responsible for immunological effects&nbsp;\u2013 the [[mononuclear phagocyte system]] of the liver contains many immunologically active cells, acting as a 'sieve' for antigens carried to it via the [[Hepatic portal system|portal system]].\n* The liver produces [[albumin]], the most abundant protein in [[Blood plasma|blood serum]].

[[Portacaval anastomosis|Congested anastomoses]] between the [[portal venous system]] and the systemic circulation, can be a subsequent condition.\n\nMany diseases of the liver are accompanied by [[jaundice]] caused by increased levels of [[bilirubin]] in the system.

Diseases that interfere with liver function will lead to derangement of these processes. However, the liver has a great capacity to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] and has a large reserve capacity. In most cases, the liver only produces symptoms after extensive damage.\n\n[[Hepatomegaly]] refers to an enlarged liver and can be due to many causes. It can be [[palpated]] in a [[liver span]] measurement.\n\nLiver diseases may be diagnosed by [[liver function tests]]\u2013blood tests that can identify various markers. For example, [[Acute-phase protein|acute-phase reactants]] are produced by the liver in response to injury or inflammation.\n\n===Symptoms===\nThe classic symptoms of liver damage include the following:\n* Pale stools occur when [[stercobilin]], a brown pigment, is absent from the stool. Stercobilin is derived from bilirubin metabolites produced in the liver.\n* Dark urine occurs when bilirubin mixes with urine\n* Jaundice (yellow skin and/or whites of the eyes) This is where [[bilirubin]] deposits in skin, causing an intense [[itch]]. Itching is the most common complaint by people who have liver failure. Often this itch cannot be relieved by drugs.\n* [[Ascites|Swelling of the abdomen]], and [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of the ankles and feet occurs because the [[Hypoalbuminemia|liver fails to make albumin]].\n* Excessive fatigue occurs from a [[Deficiency (medicine)|generalized loss of nutrients]], [[dietary mineral|minerals]] and vitamins.\n* [[bruise|Bruising]] and easy bleeding are other features of liver disease.

In the [[Romance languages]], the anatomical word for \"liver\" ([[French language|French]] ''foie'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''h\u00edgado'', etc.) derives not from the [[Latin language|Latin]] anatomical term, ''jecur'', but from the culinary term ''ficatum'', literally \"stuffed with [[figs]],\" referring to the livers of geese that had been fattened on figs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Foie |url=https://larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/foie/34366?q=foie#34314 |website=Larousse.fr |accessdate=2019-04-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612002718/http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/foie/34366?q=foie#34314 |archive-date=2018-06-12 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nLiver can be baked, boiled, broiled, fried, [[Stir frying|stir-fried]], or eaten raw (''asbeh nayeh'' or ''sawda naye'' in [[Lebanese cuisine]], or liver [[sashimi]] in [[Japanese cuisine]]). In many preparations, pieces of liver are combined with pieces of meat or kidneys, as in the various forms of Middle Eastern [[mixed grill]] (e.g. ''[[meurav Yerushalmi]]''). Well-known examples include [[liver p\u00e2t\u00e9]], [[foie gras]], [[chopped liver]], and [[leverpastej]]. Liver [[sausage]]s such as [[Braunschweiger (sausage)|Braunschweiger]] and [[liverwurst]] are also a valued meal. [[Liver sausage]]s may also be used as spreads. A traditional [[South Africa]]n delicacy, [[skilpadjies]], is made of minced lamb's liver wrapped in ''netvet'' (caul fat), and grilled over an open fire.\n\nAnimal livers are rich in iron, [[Retinol|vitamin A]] and [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]]; and [[cod liver oil]] is commonly used as a [[dietary supplement]].  Traditionally, some fish livers were valued as food, especially the [[Common stingray|stingray]] liver. It was used to prepare delicacies, such as poached skate liver on toast in England, as well as the ''beignets de foie de raie'' and ''foie de raie en croute'' in [[French cuisine]].<ref>{{cite book\n|author= Schwabe, Calvin W.\n|title= Unmentionable Cuisine\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SiBntk9jGmoC&pg=PA313\n|date= 1979\n|publisher= University of Virginia Press\n|isbn= 978-0-8139-1162-5\n|pages= 313\u2013\n|access-date= 2015-06-27\n|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151026160044/https://books.google.com/books?id=SiBntk9jGmoC&pg=PA313\n|archive-date= 2015-10-26\n|url-status= live\n}}</ref>\n\n===Possible psychoactivity of giraffe liver===\n[[File:ESCAYRAC(1853) p454 Planche VIII.jpg|thumb|19th century drinking scene in [[Kordofan]], home to the [[Humur|Humr]] tribe, imbibers of a drink prepared from [[giraffe]] liver. Plate from ''Le D\u00e9sert et le Soudan'' by [[Stanislas d'Escayrac de Lauture]] ]]\nThe [[Humur|Humr]], one of the tribes in the [[Baggara]] ethnic grouping, native to southwestern [[Kordofan]] in [[Sudan]] and speakers of [[Shuwa Arabic|Shuwa]] or [[Chadian Arabic]], prepare a ( non-alcoholic ) drink from the liver and [[bone marrow]] of the [[giraffe]] which they call ''umm nyolokh'', and which they claim is intoxicating  ( Arabic  \u0633\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0646  ''sakran'' ), causing dreams and even waking [[hallucination]]s.<ref name = \"Rudgley Psychoactive\">Rudgley, Richard ''The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Substances'' , pub. Abacus 1998 {{ISBN|0 349 11127 8}} pps. 20-21.</ref> Anthropologist [[Ian Cunnison]], who accompanied the Humr on one of their giraffe-hunting expeditions in the late 1950s, notes that:\n\n<blockquote>It is said that a person, once he has drunk ''umm nyolokh'', will return to giraffe again and again. Humr, being [[Ansar (Sudan)|Mahdists]], are strict [[Khamr|abstainers]] [ from alcohol ] and a Humrawi is never drunk ( ''sakran'' ) on [[liquor]] or beer. But he uses this word to describe the effects which ''umm nyolokh'' has upon him.<ref name = \"Cunnison Giraffe\">Cunnison, Ian 1958 ''Giraffe Hunting among the Humr Tribe'', SNR 39, pps. 49-60.</ref></blockquote>\n\nCunnison's remarkable account of an apparently psychoactive mammal found its way from a somewhat obscure scientific paper into more mainstream literature through a conversation between [[Wendy James (anthropologist)|Dr. Wendy James]] of the Institute of Social and Cultural [[Social anthropology|Anthropology]] at the [[University of Oxford]] and specialist on the use of [[hallucinogen]]s and intoxicants in society [[Richard Rudgley]], who considered its implications in his popular work ''The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Substances''. Rudgley hypothesises that the presence of the hallucinogenic compound [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] might account for the putative intoxicating properties of ''umm nyolokh''.<ref name = \"Rudgley Psychoactive\"/>\n\nCunnison himself, on the other hand, had found it hard fully to believe in the literal truth of the Humr's assertion that their drink was intoxicating:\n\n<blockquote>I can only assume that there is no intoxicating substance in the drink and that the effect it produces is simply a matter of convention, although it may be brought about [[placebo|subconsciously]].<ref name = \"Cunnison Giraffe\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe study of [[entheogen]]s in general - including entheogens of animal origin ( e.g. [[hallucinogenic fish]] and [[Colorado River toad|toad venom]] ) - has, however, made considerable progress in the sixty-odd years since Cunnison's report and the idea that some intoxicating principle might reside in giraffe liver no longer seems as far-fetched as it was in Cunnison's day, although conclusive proof ( or disproof ) will have to await detailed analyses of the animal organ  in question and the drink prepared therefrom.<ref name = \"Rudgley Psychoactive\"/>\n\n===Arrow/bullet poison===\n[[File:Shirokogoroff s m 1929.jpg|thumb|[[S.

Russian anthropologist [[S. M. Shirokogoroff|Sergei Mikhailovich Shirokogorov]], revered as one of the greatest scholars of Tungusic studies,{{fact|date=October 2019}} notes that : <blockquote>Formerly the using of poisoned arrows was common. For instance, among the Kumar\u010den, [ a subgroup of the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]] ] even in recent times a poison was used which was prepared from decaying liver. * ( Note ) This has been confirmed by the Kumar\u010den. I am not competent to judge as to the chemical conditions of production of poison which is not destroyed by the heat of explosion. However, the Tungus themselves compare this method [ of poisoning ammunition ] with the poisoning of arrows.<ref>[[S. M.

Its form varies considerably in different species, and is largely determined by the shape and arrangement of the surrounding organs.

Contemporary authors identify differing lists of surnames to be included as families associated with Melungeons. The English surname [[Gibson (surname)|Gibson]] and Irish surname [[Collins (surname)|Collins]] appear frequently; [[genealogist]] Pat Elder calls them \"core\" surnames.<ref name=elder>Elder, Pat Spurlock (1999). ''Melungeons: Examining an Appalachian Legend'', Blountville, Tennessee: Continuity Press</ref> Vardy Collins and Shep Gibson had settled in Hancock County, and they and other Melungeons are documented by land deeds, slave sales and marriage licenses.<ref name=\"Price\"/> \nThe original meaning of the word \"Melungeon\" is obscure (see Etymology below). From about the mid-19th to the late 20th centuries, it referred exclusively to one tri-racial isolate group, the descendants of the multiracial Collins, Gibson, and several other related families at Newman's Ridge, Vardy Valley, and other settlements in and around Hancock and Hawkins counties, Tennessee.<ref name=\"Estes\"/>\n\n==Origins==\nAccording to the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'', which Virginia incorporated into law in 1662, children born in the colonies were assigned the social status of their mother, regardless of their father's ethnicity or citizenship. This meant the children of enslaved African or African-American women were born into slavery. But it also meant the children of free white or mulatto women, even if fathered by enslaved African men, were born free. The free descendants of such unions formed the majority of ancestors of the [[free people of color|free families of color]] listed in the 1790 and 1810 US censuses. Early colonial Virginia was very much a \"melting pot\" of peoples, and before slavery hardened as a racial caste, white and black working-class people often lived and worked in close quarters and formed relationships and marriages. Some of these early multiracial families were ancestors of the later Melungeons. Each family line has to be traced separately. Over the generations, most individuals of the group called Melungeon were persons of mixed European and African descent, sometimes also with Native American ancestry, whose ancestors had been free in colonial Virginia.<ref name=\"Heinegg\"/>\n\nEdward Price's dissertation on ''Mixed-Blood Populations of the Eastern United States as to Origins, Localizations, and Persistence'' (1950) stated that children of European and free black unions had intermarried with persons of Native American ancestry. These conclusions have been largely upheld in subsequent scholarly and genealogical studies. In 1894, the U.S. Department of the Interior, in its \"Report of Indians Taxed and Not Taxed,\" noted that the Melungeons in Hawkins County \"claim to be [[Cherokee]] of mixed blood\".<ref name=\"TenEnc\"/> The term Melungeon has since sometimes been applied as a catch-all phrase for a number of groups of mixed-race ancestry.\n\nIn 1995, Paul Heinegg published ''Free African American Families in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware''.<ref>[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com Paul Heinegg, ''Free African American Families in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'' (1995-2005), available online</ref> He found that the great majority of free people of color in the 1790 and 1810 censuses had ancestors going back to colonial Virginia and unions between free white women and free, indentured or enslaved African or African-American men. Similarly, in 2012, the genealogist Roberta Estes and her fellow researchers reported that the Melungeon lines likely originated in the unions of black and white indentured servants living in Virginia in the mid-1600s before slavery became widespread.<ref name=\"Estes\"/> They concluded that as laws were put in place to prevent the mixing of races, these family groups intermarried with each other. They migrated together, sometimes along with white neighbors, from western [[Virginia]] through the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont frontier]] of [[Province of North Carolina|North Carolina]], before settling primarily in the mountains of [[East Tennessee]].<ref name=\"loller\">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/24/melungeon-dna-study-origin_n_1544489.html Travis Loller (AP), \"Melungeon DNA Study Reveals Ancestry, Upsets 'A Whole Lot Of People'\"], ''Huffington Post'', 24 May 2012, accessed 14 February 2013</ref>\n\n===Evidence===\n[[Free people of color]] are documented as migrating with European-American neighbors in the first half of the 18th century to the frontiers of Virginia and North Carolina, where they received land grants like their neighbors. For instance, the Collins, Gibson, and Ridley (Riddle) families owned land adjacent to one another in [[Orange County, North Carolina]], where they and the Bunch family were listed in 1755 as \"free Molatas ([[mulatto]]es)\", subject to taxation on tithes. By settling in frontier areas, free people of color found more amenable living conditions and could escape some of the racial strictures of Virginia and North Carolina [[Tidewater (geographic term)|Tidewater]] [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] areas.<ref name=\"Estes\"/><ref>[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/Church_Cotanch.htm Paul Heinegg, \"Church and Cotanch Families\"], ''Free African Americans'' (1995)</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Jack D. Forbes]] has discussed laws in South Carolina related to racial classification:\n\n<blockquote>In 1719, South Carolina decided who should be an \"Indian\" for tax purposes since American [Indian] slaves were taxed at a lesser rate than African slaves. The act stated: \"And for preventing all doubts and scruples that may arise what ought to be rated on [[M\u00e9tis|mustees]], [[mulatto]]es, etc. all such slaves as are not entirely Indian shall be accounted as negro.<ref name=\"forbes\"/> </blockquote>\n\nForbes found this to be significant. He said that at the time, \"mustees\" and \"mulattoes\" were considered persons of part Native American ancestry. He wrote,\n<blockquote>My judgment (to be discussed later) is that a mustee was primarily part-African and American [Indian] and that a mulatto was usually part-European and American [Indian]. The act is also significant because it asserts that part-American [Indians] with ''or without'' [emphasis added] African ancestry could be counted as Negroes, thus having an implication for all later slave censuses.<ref name=\"forbes\">Jack D. Forbes, \"The Use of Racial and Ethnic Terms in America: Management by Manipulation\", ''Wicazo SA Review/The Red Pencil Review'', Fall 1995, Vol. XI No. 2, pp. 55,58-59.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBeginning about 1767, some of the ancestors of the Melungeons reached the frontier [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]] area, where they are listed on tax lists of [[Montgomery County, Virginia]], in the 1780s. From there they migrated south in the Appalachian Range to [[Wilkes County, North Carolina]], where some are listed as \"white\" on the 1790 census. They resided in a part that became [[Ashe County, North Carolina|Ashe County]], where they are designated as \"other free\" in 1800.<ref name=\"pricegeo\"/>\n\nThe Collins and Gibson families (identified as Melungeon ancestors) were recorded in 1813 as members of the Stony Creek Primitive Baptist Church in [[Scott County, Virginia]]. They appear to have been treated as social equals of the white members. The earliest documented use of the term \"Melungeon\" is found in the minutes of this church (see Etymology below). While there are historical references to the documents, the evidence has come from transcribed copies.<ref name=\"Estes\"/>\n\nFrom the Virginia and North Carolina frontiers, the families migrated west into Tennessee and Kentucky. The earliest known Melungeon in what is now northeast Tennessee was Millington Collins, who executed a deed in [[Hawkins County, Tennessee|Hawkins County]] in 1802. However, there is some evidence that Vardy Collins and Shep Gibson had settled in Hawkins (what is now [[Hancock County, Tennessee|Hancock County]]) by 1790.<ref name=\"Price\"/> Several Collins and Gibson households were listed in [[Floyd County, Kentucky]] in the 1820 census, where they were classified as \"[[free persons of color]]\". On the 1830 censuses of Hawkins and neighboring [[Grainger County, Tennessee]], the Collins and Gibson families are listed as \"free-colored\".  Melungeons were residents of the part of Hawkins that in 1844 was organized as Hancock County.<ref name=\"HancockCounty\">[http://www.rootsweb.com/~tnhancoc/ Hancock County, Tennessee Genealogy], Rootsweb</ref>\n\nBy 1830, the Melungeon community in Hawkins County numbered 330 people in 55 families; in adjoining Grainger County, there were 130 people in 24 families. According to Edward Price, \"Because of them, Hawkins County had more free colored persons in the 1830 census than any other county in Tennessee except [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson]] (which includes [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]) and more free colored families named Collins than any other county in the United States.\"<ref name=\"pricegeo\">[Price, Edward T.

As in Virginia, if a free person was mostly white (one-eighth or less black), he was considered legally white and a citizen of the state:\n\n<blockquote>Persons that are known and recognized by the Constitution and laws of Tennessee, as free persons of color are those who by the act of 1794 section 32 are taken and deemed to be capable in law to be certified in any case what is in, except against each other or in the language of the statute \"all Negroes, Indians, Mulattoes, and all persons of mixed blood descended from Negro or Indian ancestors to the third generation inclusive though one ancestor of each generation may have been a white person, white bond or free.\"... That if the great grandfather of Plaintiff was an Indian or Negro and he is descended on the mother's side from a white woman, without any further Negro or Indian blood than such as he derived on the father's side, then the Plaintiff is not of mix blood, or within the third generation inclusive; in other words that if the Plaintiff has not in his veins more than 1/8 of Negro or Indian blood, he is a citizen of this state and it would be slanderous to call him a Negro.<ref>[http://jctcuzins.org/pam/perkins/jury.html \"PERKINS Trial: Instructions to the Jury\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130716010358/http://jctcuzins.org/pam/perkins/jury.html |date=2013-07-16 }}, 1 July 1858, \"Original History of Johnson County\" website, American Local History Network</ref></blockquote>\n\nDuring the 19th century, due to their intermarriage with white families, Melungeon-surnamed families were increasingly classified as white on census records.<ref name=\"Heinegg\"/>  In 1935, a Nevada newspaper anecdotally described Melungeons as \"mulattoes\" with \"straight hair.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091028085441/http://www.geocities.com/ourmelungeons/nevada.html ''Nevada State Journal''], Nov 10, 1935, p.6</ref>\n\n===Assimilation===\n[[Ariela Gross]] has shown by analysis of court cases, the shift from perceptions of an individual as \"[[mulatto]]\" to \"[[White American|white]]\" was often dependent upon appearance and, especially, community perception of a person's activities in life: who one associated with and whether the person fulfilled the common obligations of citizens. Census takers were generally people of a community, so they classified people racially as they were known by the community.<ref name=\"Ariela Gross 2007\">[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/25.3/gross.html Ariela Gross, \"Of Portuguese Origin\": Litigating Identity and Citizenship among the 'Little Races' in Nineteenth-Century America\"], ''Law and History Review'', Vol. 25, No. 3, Fall 2007, accessed 22 June 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512143936/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/25.3/gross.html |date=May 12, 2008 }}</ref>  Definitions of racial categories were often imprecise and ambiguous, especially for \"mulatto\" and \"free person of color\". In the British North American colonies and the United States at times in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, \"mulatto\" could mean a mixture of African and European, African and Native American, European and Native American, or all three. At the same time, these groups intermarried.\n\nThere were questions about which ethnic culture individuals identified with and often there were differences between how people identified themselves and how others identified them. Because of slavery, colonial and state laws were biased toward identifying multiracial people of partial African origin as African or 'black,' although persons of mixed African and Native American descent might identify and live culturally as Native Americans. Many Native American tribes were organized into [[matrilineal]] kinship systems, in which children were considered born into the mother's clan and took their social status from her people; inheritance and descent was figured through the maternal lines.\n\nBecause of the loose terminology and social attitudes to mixed-race persons, remnant non-reservation American Indians in the Upper South were generally not recorded separately as Indians. They were often gradually reclassified as mulatto or free people of color, especially as generations intermarried with neighbors of African descent. In the early decades of the 20th century, [[Virginia]] and some other states passed laws imposing the [[one-drop rule]], requiring all persons to be classified as either white or black: those of any known African ancestry were to be classified as black, regardless of appearance, and how they self-identified or were known in the community.<ref name=\"heite\"/>\n\nAfter Virginia passed its [[Racial Integrity Act]] of 1924, officials went so far as to alter existing birth and marriage records to reclassify as \"colored\" some mixed-race individuals or families who identified as and had been recorded as Indian; this destroyed Indian communities' documented continuity of identity. The historical documentation of continuity of self-identified Native American families was lost. This process of loss of historical and cultural continuity appeared to have happened also with some of the non-reservation remnant [[Lenape]] Indians of [[Delaware]].<ref name=\"heite\">[http://www.heite.org/Invis.indians1.html Dr. Louise Heite, \"Delaware's Invisible Indians\", Heite Consulting, Inc.

Six such tribes in Virginia received federal recognition as tribes in 2018 through the passage of a law by Congress. \n\n===Acceptance===\nThe families known as \"Melungeons\" in the 19th century were generally well integrated into the communities in which they lived, though they may still have been affected by racism. Records show that on the whole, they enjoyed the same rights as [[White American|whites]]. For example, they held property, voted, and served in the Army; some, such as the Gibsons, owned slaves as early as the 18th century.<ref>[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/Gibson_Gowen.htm Paul Heinegg (1999\u20132010), \"Gibson and Gowen Families\", in ''Free African Americans'']</ref>\n\n[[File:Mahala-mullins-cabin-porch-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Porch of the restored Mahala Mullins Cabin, originally located in Vardy, Blackwater Creek]]\nUnder the first [[Tennessee]] constitution of 1796, free people of color (males only) were allowed to vote. Following fears raised by the 1831 [[Nat Turner]] slave rebellion in Virginia, Tennessee and other southern states passed new restrictions on free people of color. By its new constitution of 1834, Tennessee [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] free people of color, reducing them to second-class status.<ref name=\"Gross\"/>\n\nIn this period, several Melungeon men were tried in [[Hawkins County, Tennessee|Hawkins County]] in 1846 for \"illegal voting\", under suspicion of being [[African American|black]] or free men of color (and thereby ineligible for voting). They were acquitted, presumably by demonstrating to the court's satisfaction that they had no appreciable black ancestry. Standards were not as strict as under the later laws of the \"one drop rule\" of the 20th century. As in some other cases, this was chiefly determined by people testifying as to how the men were perceived by the community and whether they had \"acted white\" by voting, serving in the militia, or undertaking other common citizens' obligations available to white men.<ref name=\"Gross\">[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/25.3/gross.html Ariela Gross, \"'Of Portuguese Origin': Litigating Identity and Citizenship among the 'Little Races' in Nineteenth-Century America\"], ''Law and History Review'', Vol.25, No.3, Fall 2007, accessed 22 June 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512143936/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/25.3/gross.html |date=May 12, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Law was involved not only in recognizing race, but in creating it; the state itself helped make people white.

The white Democrat-dominated state legislatures passed [[Jim Crow laws]]. But issues of race were often brought to court as a result of arguments about money.  \n\nFor example, in 1872, a widowed woman's Melungeon ancestry was assessed in a trial in [[Hamilton County, Tennessee]]. The case was brought by relatives of her late husband, who challenged her inheritance of money from him after his death. They questioned the legitimacy of a marriage between a white man and a woman known to be Melungeon, and argued the marriage was not legitimate because the woman was of black ancestry. Based on the testimony of people in the community, the court decided the woman in the case was not of African ancestry, or not recently enough to matter.<ref name=\"Gross\"/>\n\nModern [[anthropological]] and [[sociological]] studies of Melungeon descendants in [[Appalachia]] have demonstrated that they have become culturally indistinguishable from their \"non-Melungeon,\" white neighbors: they share a [[Baptist]] religious affiliation and other community features.  With changing attitudes and a desire for more work opportunities, numerous descendants of the early Melungeon pioneer families have migrated from Appalachia to other parts of the United States.\n\n==Legends==\nIn spite of being culturally and linguistically similar to their European neighbors, these multi-racial families were of a sufficiently different physical appearance to provoke speculation as to their identity and origins. In the first half of the 19th century, the pejorative term \"Melungeon\" began to be applied to these families by local white (European-American) neighbors. Local \"knowledge\" or myths soon began to arise about these people who lived in the hills of [[Eastern Tennessee]]. According to Pat Elder, the earliest of these was that they were \"[[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]]\" (more specifically, \"[[Cherokee]]\").<ref name=\"elder\"/>  The Melungeon descendant and researcher, Jack Goins, states that the Melungeons claimed to be both Indian and [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. An example was \"Spanish Peggy\" Gibson, wife of Vardy Collins.\n\nA few ancestors may have been of mixed [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] ([[Spanish people|Spanish]] and/or [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]) and African origin. Historian [[Ira Berlin]] has noted that some early slaves and free blacks of the charter generation in the colonies were \"Atlantic Creoles\", mixed-race descendants of Iberian workers and African women in slave ports in Africa.  Their male descendants grew up bilingual and accompanied Europeans as workers or slaves.<ref>Ira Berlin, ''Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press, 1998, pp. 27\u201332</ref> The majority of Melungeon early ancestors, who had migrated from Virginia over time, are northern European and African, given the history of settlement in late 17th\u2013early-18th century eastern Virginia. Later generations in [[Tennessee]] intermarried with descendants of [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]] immigrants who arrived in the mid- to late-18th century and settled in the backcountry before the [[American Revolution]].\n\nGiven historical evidence of Native American settlement patterns, [[Cherokee Nation]] descent is highly unlikely for the original Melungeon ancestral families, who were formed during the colonial era in the [[Tidewater region|Virginia Tidewater]] areas, which were not Cherokee territory. Some of their descendants may have later intermarried with isolated individuals of Cherokee or other Native American ancestry in East Tennessee. Melungeons in [[Graysville, Tennessee]] claimed Cherokee ancestors.  [[Anthropologist]] E. Raymond Evans wrote (1979) regarding these claims:\n\n<blockquote>In Graysville, the Melungeons strongly deny their Black heritage and explain their genetic differences by claiming to have had Cherokee grandmothers. Many of the local whites also claim Cherokee ancestry and appear to accept the Melungeon claim ...<ref>Evans, E. Raymond (1979). \"The Graysville Melungeons: A Tri-racial People in Lower East Tennessee\", ''Tennessee Anthropologist'' IV(1): 1\u201331.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe historian, C. S. Everett, hypothesized that John Collins (the [[Saponi|Sapony]] Indian recorded as being expelled from [[Orange County, Virginia]] about January 1743), might be the same man as the Melungeon ancestor John Collins, classified as a \"mulatto\" in 1755 North Carolina records.<ref>C. S. Everett, \"Melungeon History and Myth,\" ''Appalachian Journal'' (1999)</ref>  But Everett has revised that theory after having discovered evidence that these were two different men named John Collins. Only descendants of the latter man, identified as mulatto in the 1755 record in North Carolina, has any proven connection to the Melungeon families of eastern Tennessee.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/Church_Cotanch.htm | title=Paul Heinegg, '&#39;Free African Americans,'&#39; '&#39;op.cit.'&#39;, Church and Cotanch Families |publisher=Freeafricanamericans.com |accessdate=2013-08-21}}</ref>\n\nOther peoples frequently suggested as Melungeon ancestors are the [[Black-Dutch]] and the [[Powhatan|Powhatan Indian]] group. The Powhatan were an [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]]-speaking tribe who inhabited eastern Virginia when the English first arrived.\n\nSpeculation about Melungeon origins continued during the 19th and 20th centuries. Writers recounted folk tales of shipwrecked sailors, lost colonists, hoards of silver, and ancient peoples such as the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] or Phoenicians. With each writer, new elements were added to the mythology surrounding this group, and more surnames were added to the list of possible Melungeon ancestors. Journalist [[Will Allen Dromgoole]] wrote several articles on the Melungeons in the 1890s.<ref>Dromgoole, Will Allen (1890). \"Land of the Malungeons\", ''Nashville Daily American'', under the name Will Allen, August 31, 1890: 10, reproduced at Melungeon Heritage Association.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.melungeon.org/?BISKIT=1427106366&CONTEXT=cat&cat=10013 |title=Melungeon Heritage Association Website |publisher=Melungeon.org |accessdate=2013-08-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727080135/http://www.melungeon.org/?BISKIT=1427106366&CONTEXT=cat&cat=10013 |archivedate=2011-07-27 }}</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, amateur researchers suggested that the Melungeons' ethnic identity may include ancestors who were [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Sephardi]] (Iberian) Jews. The writers David Beers Quinn and Ivor Noel Hume theorize that the Melungeons were descended from Sephardi Jews who fled the Inquisition and came as sailors to North America. They also say that [[Francis Drake]] did not repatriate all the Turks he saved from [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias (1586)|the sack of Cartagena]], but some came to the colonies.<ref name=quinn>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DvA0Az4owikC&pg=PA343 David Beers Quinn, ''Set Fair for Roanoke''], p. 343]</ref>  But Janet Crain notes that there is no written documentation to support this theory.<ref>[http://historical-melungeons.blogspot.com/2012/05/melungeon-myth-of-drake-dropping-off.html \"Myth of Drake Dropping off Passengers\"], Historical Melungeons</ref>  The paper on the Melungeon DNA Project, published by Paul Heinegg, Jack Goins, and Roberta Estes in the ''[[Journal of Genetic Genealogy]]'', shows that ancestry of the sample is primarily European and African, with one person having a Native American paternal [[haplotype]]. There is no genetic evidence to support the Turkish or Jewish ancestry theories.<ref name=\"Estes\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThere are many hypotheses about the etymology of the term ''Melungeon''.  One plausible explanation favored by linguists and many researchers on the topic, and found in several dictionaries, is that the name derives from the [[French language|French]] ''m\u00e9lange'', meaning mixture, or perhaps ''[nous] m\u00e9langeons'' meaning \"[we] mix/mingle\". As there were [[French Huguenot]] immigrants in Virginia from 1700, their language could have contributed a term.\n\nJoanne Pezzullo and Karlton Douglas speculate that a more likely derivation of ''Melungeon'', related to the English culture of the colonies, may have been from the now obsolete English word ''malengin'' (also spelled ''mal engin'') meaning \"guile\", \"deceit\", or \"ill intent.\" It was used by [[Edmund Spenser]] as the name of a trickster figure in his epic poem, ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' (1590\u20131596), popular in Elizabethan England.<ref>[http://www.melungeons.com/articles/morm032002.htm Joanne Pezzullo and Karlton Douglas, \"Melungeon or Malengin?\"], Melungeon Heritage Association Website</ref>  The phrase, \"harbored them Melungins,\" would be equivalent to \"harbored someone of ill will\", or could mean \"harbored evil people\", without reference to any ethnicity.\n\nA different explanation traces the word to ''malungu'' (or ''malungo''), a [[Portuguese Africans|Luso-African]] word from [[Angola]] meaning shipmate, derived from the [[North Mbundu language|Kimbundu]] word ''ma'luno'', meaning \"companion\" or \"friend\".<ref>Hashaw, Tim (July/August 2001) [http://www.eclectica.org/v5n3/hashaw.html Tim Hashaw, \"Malungu: The African Origin of the American Melungeons\"], ''Eclectica Magazine''</ref><ref>Hashaw, Tim (2007) ''The Birth of Black America: The First African Americans and the Pursuit of Freedom at Jamestown'', New York: Basic Books.</ref>  The word, spelled as ''Melungo'' and ''Mulungo'', has been found in numerous Portuguese records.  It is said to be a derogatory word that Africans used towards people of Portuguese or other white ancestry.  It could be assumed the word was brought to America through people of African ancestry.<ref>Quote: \"In view of the explanations offered by the Melungo (white man),\" The chief replied, \"this affair is at an end.  It is true that the words used by the negro were very offensive, therefore the Melungeo may proceed in peace on his journey, and may he prosper.  On your return, if you desire to pass through the lands where I am chieftain, you have my [[kraal]]s at your command, and I shall be very happy to receive you, because I see that the Melungo is a Oanuna (brave man).\"  Melungo [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006801243 Diocleciano Fernandes das Neves, ''A Hunting Expedition to the Transvaal''], 1879, p. 28</ref>\n\nKennedy (1994) speculates that the word derives from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''melun can'' (from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''mal`un jinn'' \u0645\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0646 \u062c\u0646\u0651), which purportedly means \"damned soul.\" He suggests that, at the time, the (condemned soul) was a term used by Turks for Muslims who had been captured and enslaved aboard Spanish [[galleons]].<ref>Kennedy (1994)</ref>\n\nSome writers try to connect the term ''Melungeon'' to an ethnic origin of people designated by that term, but there is no basis for this assumption.  It appears the name arose as an [[exonym]], something which neighboring people, of whatever origin, called the multi-racial people.\n\nThe earliest known written use of the word ''Melungeon'' is in an 1813 [[Scott County, Virginia]] record at Stony Creek Primitive Baptist Church:\n\n<blockquote>Then came forward Sister Kitchen and complained to the church against Susanna Stallard for saying she harbored them Melungins.  Sister Sook said she was hurt with her for believing her child and not believing her, and she won't talk to her to get satisfaction, and both is 'pigedish', one against the other.  Sister Sook lays it down and the church forgives her.</blockquote>\n\nOn October 7, 1840, the polemical ''[[Brownlow's Whig]]'' of [[Jonesborough, Tennessee]], published an article entitled \"Negro Speaking!\"  The publisher referred to a rival Democratic politician with a party in [[Sullivan County, Tennessee|Sullivan County]] as \"an impudent Malungeon from Washington City a scoundrel who is half Negro and half Indian,\"{{sic}} then as a \"free negroe\".  In this and related articles, he does not identify the Democrat by name.<ref>[http://www.historical-melungeons.com/whig.html Melanie Sovine, \"The Mysterious Melungeons: A Critique of the Mythical Image\"], 1982, at Historical Association of Melungeons; accessed June 15, 2011</ref>\n\n==Modern identity==\nThe term ''Melungeon'' was traditionally considered an insult, a label applied to Appalachians who were by appearance or reputation of [[mixed-race]] ancestry, though who were not clearly either \"black\" or \"Indian\".  In southwest Virginia, the term ''Ramp'' was similarly applied to people of mixed race.  This term has never shed its pejorative character.<ref name=\"Sovine\">Sovine, Melanie L. \"The Mysterious Melungeons: a Critique of the Mythical Image.\" University of KY PHD dissertation, 1982</ref> In December 1943, Virginia State Registrar of Vital Statistics, [[Walter Ashby Plecker]], sent county officials a letter warning against \"colored\" families trying to pass as \"white\" or \"Indian\" in violation of the [[Racial Integrity Act of 1924]] and mentioned by county specific surnames, including: \"Lee, Smyth and Wise: Collins, Gibson, (Gipson), Moore, Goins, Ramsey, Delph, Bunch, Freeman, Mise, Barlow, Bolden (Bolin), Mullins, Hawkins (chiefly Tennessee Melungeons)\".<ref name=\"plecker\">[http://www.virginiamemory.com/online_classroom/shaping_the_constitution/doc/plecker_letter Plecker Letter of December 1943] at Virginia Memory, Library of Virginia.</ref>  ([[Lee County, Virginia]] borders Hancock County, Tennessee.) He directed the offices to reclassify members of certain families as black, causing the loss for numerous families of documentation in records that showed their continued identification as Native American.<ref name=\"plecker\"/>\n\nDifferent researchers have developed their own lists of the surnames of core Melungeon families, as generally, specific lines within families have to be traced. For example, DeMarce (1992) listed [[Hale (surname)|Hale]] as a Melungeon surname.<ref>DeMarce, Virginia E. (1992). \"Verry Slitly Mixt': Tri-Racial Isolate Families of the Upper South \u2013 A Genealogical Study\", ''National Genealogical Society Quarterly'' 80 (March 1992): pp. 5\u201335, Historical-Melungeons</ref>\n\nBy the mid-to-late 19th century, the term Melungeon appeared to have been used most frequently to refer to the multi-racial families of Hancock County and neighboring areas.<ref name=\"melungeon\"/>  Several other uses of the term in the print media, from mid-19th to early 20th century, have been collected at the Melungeon Heritage Association Website.<ref name=\"melungeon\">{{cite web | url=http://www.melungeon.org |title=Melungeon Heritage Association Website |publisher=Melungeon.org |accessdate=2013-08-21}}</ref> The spelling of the term varied widely, as was common for words and names at the time. Eventually, the form \"Melungeon\" became standard.\n\nSince the late 1960s, \"Melungeon\" has been increasingly adopted by individuals who are identifying with the ethnic group. This shift in meaning may have resulted from the popularity of ''Walk Toward the Sunset'', a drama written by playwright Kermit Hunter and produced outdoors.<ref name=\"ivey\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20091028085441/http://www.geocities.com/ourmelungeons/drama.html Ivey, Saundra K. ''Oral, Printed & Popular Culture Traditions Related to the Melungeons of Hancock County, TN''], Indiana University dissertation, 1976, accessed 18 February 2013</ref> The play was first presented in 1969 in [[Sneedville, Tennessee|Sneedville]], the county seat of Hancock County. Making no claim to historical accuracy, Hunter portrayed the Melungeons as [[indigenous people]] of uncertain race who were mistakenly perceived as black by neighboring white settlers.  As the drama portrayed Melungeons in a positive, romantic light, many individuals began for the first time to self-identify by that term. Hunter intended for his drama \"to improve the socio-economic climate\" of Hancock County, and to \"lift the Melungeon name 'from shame to the hall of fame'.\"<ref name=\"Price\" />  The play helped revive interest in the history of Melungeons. The civil rights movement and social changes of the 1960s further contributed to wider acceptance of members of the group.  Research in social history and genealogy has documented new facts about people identified as Melungeons.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, popular interest in the Melungeons has grown tremendously, although many have left the area of historical concentration. Writer [[Bill Bryson]] devoted a chapter to them in his ''[[The Lost Continent: Travels in Small-Town America|The Lost Continent]]'' (1989). N. Brent Kennedy, a non-specialist, wrote a book on his claimed Melungeon roots, ''The Melungeons: The Resurrection of a Proud People'' (1994). With the advent of the internet, many people are researching family history and the number of people self-identifying as having Melungeon heritage has increased rapidly, according to Kennedy.<ref name=kennedy>{{cite book | last=Kennedy |first=N.

Others believe they have certain \"characteristic\" physical traits or conditions or assume that a multi-racial heritage means they are Melungeon.\n\nFor example, some Melungeons are allegedly identifiable by [[shovel-shaped incisors]], a dental feature more commonly found among, but not restricted to, Native Americans and Northeast Asians.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.um.u-tokyo.ac.jp/publish_db/Bulletin/no26/no26004.html |title=Yuji Mizoguchi, \"Shovelling: A Statistical Analysis of Its Morphology\", U. of Tokyo, Bulletin No.26, Feb 1985 |publisher=Um.u-tokyo.ac.jp |accessdate=2013-08-21}}</ref> A second feature attributed by some to Melungeons is an enlarged external [[occipital bun|occipital protuberance]], dubbed an \"Anatolian bump\", after an unsubstantiated hypothesis, popularized by N.

The 'Mediterranean look' of my own family ...\"</ref>  Academic historians have not found any evidence for this thesis, nor is it supported by results from the [[Melungeon DNA Project]], which shows an overwhelming northern European and African ancestry of the Melungeon lines.\n\nInternet sites promote the anecdotal claim that Melungeons are more prone to certain diseases, such as [[sarcoidosis]] or [[familial Mediterranean fever]].

The professional genealogist and historian, [[Virginia E. DeMarce]], reviewed his 1994 book and found that Kennedy's documentation of his Melungeon ancestry was seriously flawed. He had a very indistinct definition of Melungeons, although the group had already been extensively studied by other researchers.  She criticized Kennedy for trying to include people who might have had other than northern European ancestry and said that he did not properly take account of existing historical records or recognized genealogical practice in his research. He claimed to have ancestors who were persecuted for racial reasons. However, she found that his named ancestors were all classified as white in records, held various political offices (which showed they could vote and were supported by their community), and were landowners.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.geocities.com/ourmelungeons/demarce.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028045242/http://www.geocities.com/ourmelungeons/demarce.html |archivedate=2009-10-28 |title=Dr. Virginia DeMarce, Review Essay: The Melungeons, '&#39;National Genealogical Quarterly'&#39;, Vol. 84, No. 2, June 1996, pp. 134\u2013149 |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2013-08-21}}</ref> Kennedy responded to her critique in an article of his own.<ref>[http://underonesky.org/SEKMIE_PDF/SEKMIE3A.pdf \"Dr. Brent Kennedy Responds to Virginia DeMarce\", ''Southeastern Kentucky Melungeon Information Exchange]</ref>\n\nThe [[Ridgetop Shawnee|Ridgetop Shawnee Tribe of Indians]] in Kentucky, which is not federally recognized as an Indian tribe, claims that most families in its area who are commonly identified as Melungeon are of partial Native American descent. The Ridgetop Shawnee say their ancestors migrated to the region in the late 18th and early to mid-19th centuries. Most families claimed the Ridgetop Shawnee heritage to explain their dark skin and Indian features and to avoid racial persecution.

There is evidence for connections between some of them, going back to common ancestry in colonial Virginia. For example, the Goins surname group in eastern Tennessee has long been identified as Melungeon. The surname Goins is also found among the [[Lumbee]] of southern North Carolina, a multi-racial group that has been recognized by the state as a Native American tribe. In most cases, the multi-racial families have to be traced through specific branches and lines, as not all descendants were considered to be Melungeon or other groups.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Melungeon DNA Project]]\n* [[List of topics related to the African diaspora]]\n* [[Vardy Community School]]\n* [[Pardo]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Ball, Bonnie (1992).

Contemporary authors identify differing lists of surnames to be included as families associated with Melungeons. The English surname [[Gibson (surname)|Gibson]] and Irish surname [[Collins (surname)|Collins]] appear frequently; [[genealogist]] Pat Elder calls them \"core\" surnames.<ref name=elder>Elder, Pat Spurlock (1999). ''Melungeons: Examining an Appalachian Legend'', Blountville, Tennessee: Continuity Press</ref> Vardy Collins and Shep Gibson had settled in Hancock County, and they and other Melungeons are documented by land deeds, slave sales and marriage licenses.<ref name=\"Price\"/> \nThe original meaning of the word \"Melungeon\" is obscure (see Etymology below). From about the mid-19th to the late 20th centuries, it referred exclusively to one tri-racial isolate group, the descendants of the multiracial Collins, Gibson, and several other related families at Newman's Ridge, Vardy Valley, and other settlements in and around Hancock and Hawkins counties, Tennessee.<ref name=\"Estes\"/>\n\n==Origins==\nAccording to the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'', which Virginia incorporated into law in 1662, children born in the colonies were assigned the social status of their mother, regardless of their father's ethnicity or citizenship. This meant the children of enslaved African or African-American women were born into slavery. But it also meant the children of free white or mulatto women, even if fathered by enslaved African men, were born free. The free descendants of such unions formed the majority of ancestors of the [[free people of color|free families of color]] listed in the 1790 and 1810 US censuses. Early colonial Virginia was very much a \"melting pot\" of peoples, and before slavery hardened as a racial caste, white and black working-class people often lived and worked in close quarters and formed relationships and marriages. Some of these early multiracial families were ancestors of the later Melungeons. Each family line has to be traced separately. Over the generations, most individuals of the group called Melungeon were persons of mixed European and African descent, sometimes also with Native American ancestry, whose ancestors had been free in colonial Virginia.<ref name=\"Heinegg\"/>\n\nEdward Price's dissertation on ''Mixed-Blood Populations of the Eastern United States as to Origins, Localizations, and Persistence'' (1950) stated that children of European and free black unions had intermarried with persons of Native American ancestry. These conclusions have been largely upheld in subsequent scholarly and genealogical studies. In 1894, the U.S. Department of the Interior, in its \"Report of Indians Taxed and Not Taxed,\" noted that the Melungeons in Hawkins County \"claim to be [[Cherokee]] of mixed blood\".<ref name=\"TenEnc\"/> The term Melungeon has since sometimes been applied as a catch-all phrase for a number of groups of mixed-race ancestry.\n\nIn 1995, Paul Heinegg published ''Free African American Families in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware''.<ref>[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com Paul Heinegg, ''Free African American Families in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'' (1995-2005), available online</ref> He found that the great majority of free people of color in the 1790 and 1810 censuses had ancestors going back to colonial Virginia and unions between free white women and free, indentured or enslaved African or African-American men. Similarly, in 2012, the genealogist Roberta Estes and her fellow researchers reported that the Melungeon lines likely originated in the unions of black and white indentured servants living in Virginia in the mid-1600s before slavery became widespread.<ref name=\"Estes\"/> They concluded that as laws were put in place to prevent the mixing of races, these family groups intermarried with each other. They migrated together, sometimes along with white neighbors, from western [[Virginia]] through the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont frontier]] of [[Province of North Carolina|North Carolina]], before settling primarily in the mountains of [[East Tennessee]].<ref name=\"loller\">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/24/melungeon-dna-study-origin_n_1544489.html Travis Loller (AP), \"Melungeon DNA Study Reveals Ancestry, Upsets 'A Whole Lot Of People'\"], ''Huffington Post'', 24 May 2012, accessed 14 February 2013</ref>\n\n===Evidence===\n[[Free people of color]] are documented as migrating with European-American neighbors in the first half of the 18th century to the frontiers of Virginia and North Carolina, where they received land grants like their neighbors. For instance, the Collins, Gibson, and Ridley (Riddle) families owned land adjacent to one another in [[Orange County, North Carolina]], where they and the Bunch family were listed in 1755 as \"free Molatas ([[mulatto]]es)\", subject to taxation on tithes. By settling in frontier areas, free people of color found more amenable living conditions and could escape some of the racial strictures of Virginia and North Carolina [[Tidewater (geographic term)|Tidewater]] [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] areas.<ref name=\"Estes\"/><ref>[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/Church_Cotanch.htm Paul Heinegg, \"Church and Cotanch Families\"], ''Free African Americans'' (1995)</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Jack D. Forbes]] has discussed laws in South Carolina related to racial classification:\n\n<blockquote>In 1719, South Carolina decided who should be an \"Indian\" for tax purposes since American [Indian] slaves were taxed at a lesser rate than African slaves. The act stated: \"And for preventing all doubts and scruples that may arise what ought to be rated on [[M\u00e9tis|mustees]], [[mulatto]]es, etc. all such slaves as are not entirely Indian shall be accounted as negro.<ref name=\"forbes\"/> </blockquote>\n\nForbes found this to be significant. He said that at the time, \"mustees\" and \"mulattoes\" were considered persons of part Native American ancestry. He wrote,\n<blockquote>My judgment (to be discussed later) is that a mustee was primarily part-African and American [Indian] and that a mulatto was usually part-European and American [Indian]. The act is also significant because it asserts that part-American [Indians] with ''or without'' [emphasis added] African ancestry could be counted as Negroes, thus having an implication for all later slave censuses.<ref name=\"forbes\">Jack D. Forbes, \"The Use of Racial and Ethnic Terms in America: Management by Manipulation\", ''Wicazo SA Review/The Red Pencil Review'', Fall 1995, Vol. XI No. 2, pp. 55,58-59.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBeginning about 1767, some of the ancestors of the Melungeons reached the frontier [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]] area, where they are listed on tax lists of [[Montgomery County, Virginia]], in the 1780s. From there they migrated south in the Appalachian Range to [[Wilkes County, North Carolina]], where some are listed as \"white\" on the 1790 census. They resided in a part that became [[Ashe County, North Carolina|Ashe County]], where they are designated as \"other free\" in 1800.<ref name=\"pricegeo\"/>\n\nThe Collins and Gibson families (identified as Melungeon ancestors) were recorded in 1813 as members of the Stony Creek Primitive Baptist Church in [[Scott County, Virginia]]. They appear to have been treated as social equals of the white members. The earliest documented use of the term \"Melungeon\" is found in the minutes of this church (see Etymology below). While there are historical references to the documents, the evidence has come from transcribed copies.<ref name=\"Estes\"/>\n\nFrom the Virginia and North Carolina frontiers, the families migrated west into Tennessee and Kentucky. The earliest known Melungeon in what is now northeast Tennessee was Millington Collins, who executed a deed in [[Hawkins County, Tennessee|Hawkins County]] in 1802. However, there is some evidence that Vardy Collins and Shep Gibson had settled in Hawkins (what is now [[Hancock County, Tennessee|Hancock County]]) by 1790.<ref name=\"Price\"/> Several Collins and Gibson households were listed in [[Floyd County, Kentucky]] in the 1820 census, where they were classified as \"[[free persons of color]]\". On the 1830 censuses of Hawkins and neighboring [[Grainger County, Tennessee]], the Collins and Gibson families are listed as \"free-colored\".

According to Edward Price, \"Because of them, Hawkins County had more free colored persons in the 1830 census than any other county in Tennessee except [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson]] (which includes [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]) and more free colored families named Collins than any other county in the United States.\"<ref name=\"pricegeo\">[Price, Edward T.

Census takers were generally people of a community, so they classified people racially as they were known by the community.<ref name=\"Ariela Gross 2007\">[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/25.3/gross.html Ariela Gross, \"Of Portuguese Origin\": Litigating Identity and Citizenship among the 'Little Races' in Nineteenth-Century America\"], ''Law and History Review'', Vol. 25, No. 3, Fall 2007, accessed 22 June 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512143936/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/25.3/gross.html |date=May 12, 2008 }}</ref>  Definitions of racial categories were often imprecise and ambiguous, especially for \"mulatto\" and \"free person of color\". In the British North American colonies and the United States at times in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, \"mulatto\" could mean a mixture of African and European, African and Native American, European and Native American, or all three. At the same time, these groups intermarried.\n\nThere were questions about which ethnic culture individuals identified with and often there were differences between how people identified themselves and how others identified them. Because of slavery, colonial and state laws were biased toward identifying multiracial people of partial African origin as African or 'black,' although persons of mixed African and Native American descent might identify and live culturally as Native Americans. Many Native American tribes were organized into [[matrilineal]] kinship systems, in which children were considered born into the mother's clan and took their social status from her people; inheritance and descent was figured through the maternal lines.\n\nBecause of the loose terminology and social attitudes to mixed-race persons, remnant non-reservation American Indians in the Upper South were generally not recorded separately as Indians. They were often gradually reclassified as mulatto or free people of color, especially as generations intermarried with neighbors of African descent. In the early decades of the 20th century, [[Virginia]] and some other states passed laws imposing the [[one-drop rule]], requiring all persons to be classified as either white or black: those of any known African ancestry were to be classified as black, regardless of appearance, and how they self-identified or were known in the community.<ref name=\"heite\"/>\n\nAfter Virginia passed its [[Racial Integrity Act]] of 1924, officials went so far as to alter existing birth and marriage records to reclassify as \"colored\" some mixed-race individuals or families who identified as and had been recorded as Indian; this destroyed Indian communities' documented continuity of identity. The historical documentation of continuity of self-identified Native American families was lost. This process of loss of historical and cultural continuity appeared to have happened also with some of the non-reservation remnant [[Lenape]] Indians of [[Delaware]].<ref name=\"heite\">[http://www.heite.org/Invis.indians1.html Dr. Louise Heite, \"Delaware's Invisible Indians\", Heite Consulting, Inc.

Six such tribes in Virginia received federal recognition as tribes in 2018 through the passage of a law by Congress. \n\n===Acceptance===\nThe families known as \"Melungeons\" in the 19th century were generally well integrated into the communities in which they lived, though they may still have been affected by racism. Records show that on the whole, they enjoyed the same rights as [[White American|whites]]. For example, they held property, voted, and served in the Army; some, such as the Gibsons, owned slaves as early as the 18th century.<ref>[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/Gibson_Gowen.htm Paul Heinegg (1999\u20132010), \"Gibson and Gowen Families\", in ''Free African Americans'']</ref>\n\n[[File:Mahala-mullins-cabin-porch-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Porch of the restored Mahala Mullins Cabin, originally located in Vardy, Blackwater Creek]]\nUnder the first [[Tennessee]] constitution of 1796, free people of color (males only) were allowed to vote. Following fears raised by the 1831 [[Nat Turner]] slave rebellion in Virginia, Tennessee and other southern states passed new restrictions on free people of color. By its new constitution of 1834, Tennessee [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] free people of color, reducing them to second-class status.<ref name=\"Gross\"/>\n\nIn this period, several Melungeon men were tried in [[Hawkins County, Tennessee|Hawkins County]] in 1846 for \"illegal voting\", under suspicion of being [[African American|black]] or free men of color (and thereby ineligible for voting). They were acquitted, presumably by demonstrating to the court's satisfaction that they had no appreciable black ancestry. Standards were not as strict as under the later laws of the \"one drop rule\" of the 20th century.

The white Democrat-dominated state legislatures passed [[Jim Crow laws]]. But issues of race were often brought to court as a result of arguments about money.  \n\nFor example, in 1872, a widowed woman's Melungeon ancestry was assessed in a trial in [[Hamilton County, Tennessee]]. The case was brought by relatives of her late husband, who challenged her inheritance of money from him after his death. They questioned the legitimacy of a marriage between a white man and a woman known to be Melungeon, and argued the marriage was not legitimate because the woman was of black ancestry. Based on the testimony of people in the community, the court decided the woman in the case was not of African ancestry, or not recently enough to matter.<ref name=\"Gross\"/>\n\nModern [[anthropological]] and [[sociological]] studies of Melungeon descendants in [[Appalachia]] have demonstrated that they have become culturally indistinguishable from their \"non-Melungeon,\" white neighbors: they share a [[Baptist]] religious affiliation and other community features.  With changing attitudes and a desire for more work opportunities, numerous descendants of the early Melungeon pioneer families have migrated from Appalachia to other parts of the United States.\n\n==Legends==\nIn spite of being culturally and linguistically similar to their European neighbors, these multi-racial families were of a sufficiently different physical appearance to provoke speculation as to their identity and origins. In the first half of the 19th century, the pejorative term \"Melungeon\" began to be applied to these families by local white (European-American) neighbors. Local \"knowledge\" or myths soon began to arise about these people who lived in the hills of [[Eastern Tennessee]]. According to Pat Elder, the earliest of these was that they were \"[[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]]\" (more specifically, \"[[Cherokee]]\").<ref name=\"elder\"/>  The Melungeon descendant and researcher, Jack Goins, states that the Melungeons claimed to be both Indian and [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. An example was \"Spanish Peggy\" Gibson, wife of Vardy Collins.\n\nA few ancestors may have been of mixed [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] ([[Spanish people|Spanish]] and/or [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]) and African origin. Historian [[Ira Berlin]] has noted that some early slaves and free blacks of the charter generation in the colonies were \"Atlantic Creoles\", mixed-race descendants of Iberian workers and African women in slave ports in Africa.  Their male descendants grew up bilingual and accompanied Europeans as workers or slaves.<ref>Ira Berlin, ''Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press, 1998, pp. 27\u201332</ref> The majority of Melungeon early ancestors, who had migrated from Virginia over time, are northern European and African, given the history of settlement in late 17th\u2013early-18th century eastern Virginia. Later generations in [[Tennessee]] intermarried with descendants of [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]] immigrants who arrived in the mid- to late-18th century and settled in the backcountry before the [[American Revolution]].\n\nGiven historical evidence of Native American settlement patterns, [[Cherokee Nation]] descent is highly unlikely for the original Melungeon ancestral families, who were formed during the colonial era in the [[Tidewater region|Virginia Tidewater]] areas, which were not Cherokee territory. Some of their descendants may have later intermarried with isolated individuals of Cherokee or other Native American ancestry in East Tennessee. Melungeons in [[Graysville, Tennessee]] claimed Cherokee ancestors.  [[Anthropologist]] E. Raymond Evans wrote (1979) regarding these claims:\n\n<blockquote>In Graysville, the Melungeons strongly deny their Black heritage and explain their genetic differences by claiming to have had Cherokee grandmothers. Many of the local whites also claim Cherokee ancestry and appear to accept the Melungeon claim ...<ref>Evans, E. Raymond (1979). \"The Graysville Melungeons: A Tri-racial People in Lower East Tennessee\", ''Tennessee Anthropologist'' IV(1): 1\u201331.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe historian, C. S. Everett, hypothesized that John Collins (the [[Saponi|Sapony]] Indian recorded as being expelled from [[Orange County, Virginia]] about January 1743), might be the same man as the Melungeon ancestor John Collins, classified as a \"mulatto\" in 1755 North Carolina records.<ref>C. S. Everett, \"Melungeon History and Myth,\" ''Appalachian Journal'' (1999)</ref>  But Everett has revised that theory after having discovered evidence that these were two different men named John Collins. Only descendants of the latter man, identified as mulatto in the 1755 record in North Carolina, has any proven connection to the Melungeon families of eastern Tennessee.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/Church_Cotanch.htm | title=Paul Heinegg, '&#39;Free African Americans,'&#39; '&#39;op.cit.'&#39;, Church and Cotanch Families |publisher=Freeafricanamericans.com |accessdate=2013-08-21}}</ref>\n\nOther peoples frequently suggested as Melungeon ancestors are the [[Black-Dutch]] and the [[Powhatan|Powhatan Indian]] group. The Powhatan were an [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]]-speaking tribe who inhabited eastern Virginia when the English first arrived.\n\nSpeculation about Melungeon origins continued during the 19th and 20th centuries. Writers recounted folk tales of shipwrecked sailors, lost colonists, hoards of silver, and ancient peoples such as the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] or Phoenicians. With each writer, new elements were added to the mythology surrounding this group, and more surnames were added to the list of possible Melungeon ancestors. Journalist [[Will Allen Dromgoole]] wrote several articles on the Melungeons in the 1890s.<ref>Dromgoole, Will Allen (1890). \"Land of the Malungeons\", ''Nashville Daily American'', under the name Will Allen, August 31, 1890: 10, reproduced at Melungeon Heritage Association.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.melungeon.org/?BISKIT=1427106366&CONTEXT=cat&cat=10013 |title=Melungeon Heritage Association Website |publisher=Melungeon.org |accessdate=2013-08-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727080135/http://www.melungeon.org/?BISKIT=1427106366&CONTEXT=cat&cat=10013 |archivedate=2011-07-27 }}</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, amateur researchers suggested that the Melungeons' ethnic identity may include ancestors who were [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Sephardi]] (Iberian) Jews. The writers David Beers Quinn and Ivor Noel Hume theorize that the Melungeons were descended from Sephardi Jews who fled the Inquisition and came as sailors to North America. They also say that [[Francis Drake]] did not repatriate all the Turks he saved from [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias (1586)|the sack of Cartagena]], but some came to the colonies.<ref name=quinn>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DvA0Az4owikC&pg=PA343 David Beers Quinn, ''Set Fair for Roanoke''], p. 343]</ref>  But Janet Crain notes that there is no written documentation to support this theory.<ref>[http://historical-melungeons.blogspot.com/2012/05/melungeon-myth-of-drake-dropping-off.html \"Myth of Drake Dropping off Passengers\"], Historical Melungeons</ref>  The paper on the Melungeon DNA Project, published by Paul Heinegg, Jack Goins, and Roberta Estes in the ''[[Journal of Genetic Genealogy]]'', shows that ancestry of the sample is primarily European and African, with one person having a Native American paternal [[haplotype]]. There is no genetic evidence to support the Turkish or Jewish ancestry theories.<ref name=\"Estes\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThere are many hypotheses about the etymology of the term ''Melungeon''.  One plausible explanation favored by linguists and many researchers on the topic, and found in several dictionaries, is that the name derives from the [[French language|French]] ''m\u00e9lange'', meaning mixture, or perhaps ''[nous] m\u00e9langeons'' meaning \"[we] mix/mingle\". As there were [[French Huguenot]] immigrants in Virginia from 1700, their language could have contributed a term.\n\nJoanne Pezzullo and Karlton Douglas speculate that a more likely derivation of ''Melungeon'', related to the English culture of the colonies, may have been from the now obsolete English word ''malengin'' (also spelled ''mal engin'') meaning \"guile\", \"deceit\", or \"ill intent.\" It was used by [[Edmund Spenser]] as the name of a trickster figure in his epic poem, ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' (1590\u20131596), popular in Elizabethan England.<ref>[http://www.melungeons.com/articles/morm032002.htm Joanne Pezzullo and Karlton Douglas, \"Melungeon or Malengin?\"], Melungeon Heritage Association Website</ref>  The phrase, \"harbored them Melungins,\" would be equivalent to \"harbored someone of ill will\", or could mean \"harbored evil people\", without reference to any ethnicity.\n\nA different explanation traces the word to ''malungu'' (or ''malungo''), a [[Portuguese Africans|Luso-African]] word from [[Angola]] meaning shipmate, derived from the [[North Mbundu language|Kimbundu]] word ''ma'luno'', meaning \"companion\" or \"friend\".<ref>Hashaw, Tim (July/August 2001) [http://www.eclectica.org/v5n3/hashaw.html Tim Hashaw, \"Malungu: The African Origin of the American Melungeons\"], ''Eclectica Magazine''</ref><ref>Hashaw, Tim (2007) ''The Birth of Black America: The First African Americans and the Pursuit of Freedom at Jamestown'', New York: Basic Books.</ref>  The word, spelled as ''Melungo'' and ''Mulungo'', has been found in numerous Portuguese records.  It is said to be a derogatory word that Africans used towards people of Portuguese or other white ancestry.  It could be assumed the word was brought to America through people of African ancestry.<ref>Quote: \"In view of the explanations offered by the Melungo (white man),\" The chief replied, \"this affair is at an end.  It is true that the words used by the negro were very offensive, therefore the Melungeo may proceed in peace on his journey, and may he prosper.  On your return, if you desire to pass through the lands where I am chieftain, you have my [[kraal]]s at your command, and I shall be very happy to receive you, because I see that the Melungo is a Oanuna (brave man).\"  Melungo [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006801243 Diocleciano Fernandes das Neves, ''A Hunting Expedition to the Transvaal''], 1879, p. 28</ref>\n\nKennedy (1994) speculates that the word derives from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''melun can'' (from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''mal`un jinn'' \u0645\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0646 \u062c\u0646\u0651), which purportedly means \"damned soul.\" He suggests that, at the time, the (condemned soul) was a term used by Turks for Muslims who had been captured and enslaved aboard Spanish [[galleons]].<ref>Kennedy (1994)</ref>\n\nSome writers try to connect the term ''Melungeon'' to an ethnic origin of people designated by that term, but there is no basis for this assumption.  It appears the name arose as an [[exonym]], something which neighboring people, of whatever origin, called the multi-racial people.\n\nThe earliest known written use of the word ''Melungeon'' is in an 1813 [[Scott County, Virginia]] record at Stony Creek Primitive Baptist Church:\n\n<blockquote>Then came forward Sister Kitchen and complained to the church against Susanna Stallard for saying she harbored them Melungins.  Sister Sook said she was hurt with her for believing her child and not believing her, and she won't talk to her to get satisfaction, and both is 'pigedish', one against the other.  Sister Sook lays it down and the church forgives her.</blockquote>\n\nOn October 7, 1840, the polemical ''[[Brownlow's Whig]]'' of [[Jonesborough, Tennessee]], published an article entitled \"Negro Speaking!\"  The publisher referred to a rival Democratic politician with a party in [[Sullivan County, Tennessee|Sullivan County]] as \"an impudent Malungeon from Washington City a scoundrel who is half Negro and half Indian,\"{{sic}} then as a \"free negroe\".  In this and related articles, he does not identify the Democrat by name.<ref>[http://www.historical-melungeons.com/whig.html Melanie Sovine, \"The Mysterious Melungeons: A Critique of the Mythical Image\"], 1982, at Historical Association of Melungeons; accessed June 15, 2011</ref>\n\n==Modern identity==\nThe term ''Melungeon'' was traditionally considered an insult, a label applied to Appalachians who were by appearance or reputation of [[mixed-race]] ancestry, though who were not clearly either \"black\" or \"Indian\".  In southwest Virginia, the term ''Ramp'' was similarly applied to people of mixed race.  This term has never shed its pejorative character.<ref name=\"Sovine\">Sovine, Melanie L. \"The Mysterious Melungeons: a Critique of the Mythical Image.\" University of KY PHD dissertation, 1982</ref> In December 1943, Virginia State Registrar of Vital Statistics, [[Walter Ashby Plecker]], sent county officials a letter warning against \"colored\" families trying to pass as \"white\" or \"Indian\" in violation of the [[Racial Integrity Act of 1924]] and mentioned by county specific surnames, including: \"Lee, Smyth and Wise: Collins, Gibson, (Gipson), Moore, Goins, Ramsey, Delph, Bunch, Freeman, Mise, Barlow, Bolden (Bolin), Mullins, Hawkins (chiefly Tennessee Melungeons)\".<ref name=\"plecker\">[http://www.virginiamemory.com/online_classroom/shaping_the_constitution/doc/plecker_letter Plecker Letter of December 1943] at Virginia Memory, Library of Virginia.</ref>  ([[Lee County, Virginia]] borders Hancock County, Tennessee.) He directed the offices to reclassify members of certain families as black, causing the loss for numerous families of documentation in records that showed their continued identification as Native American.<ref name=\"plecker\"/>\n\nDifferent researchers have developed their own lists of the surnames of core Melungeon families, as generally, specific lines within families have to be traced. For example, DeMarce (1992) listed [[Hale (surname)|Hale]] as a Melungeon surname.<ref>DeMarce, Virginia E. (1992). \"Verry Slitly Mixt': Tri-Racial Isolate Families of the Upper South \u2013 A Genealogical Study\", ''National Genealogical Society Quarterly'' 80 (March 1992): pp. 5\u201335, Historical-Melungeons</ref>\n\nBy the mid-to-late 19th century, the term Melungeon appeared to have been used most frequently to refer to the multi-racial families of Hancock County and neighboring areas.<ref name=\"melungeon\"/>  Several other uses of the term in the print media, from mid-19th to early 20th century, have been collected at the Melungeon Heritage Association Website.<ref name=\"melungeon\">{{cite web | url=http://www.melungeon.org |title=Melungeon Heritage Association Website |publisher=Melungeon.org |accessdate=2013-08-21}}</ref> The spelling of the term varied widely, as was common for words and names at the time. Eventually, the form \"Melungeon\" became standard.\n\nSince the late 1960s, \"Melungeon\" has been increasingly adopted by individuals who are identifying with the ethnic group. This shift in meaning may have resulted from the popularity of ''Walk Toward the Sunset'', a drama written by playwright Kermit Hunter and produced outdoors.<ref name=\"ivey\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20091028085441/http://www.geocities.com/ourmelungeons/drama.html Ivey, Saundra K. ''Oral, Printed & Popular Culture Traditions Related to the Melungeons of Hancock County, TN''], Indiana University dissertation, 1976, accessed 18 February 2013</ref> The play was first presented in 1969 in [[Sneedville, Tennessee|Sneedville]], the county seat of Hancock County. Making no claim to historical accuracy, Hunter portrayed the Melungeons as [[indigenous people]] of uncertain race who were mistakenly perceived as black by neighboring white settlers.  As the drama portrayed Melungeons in a positive, romantic light, many individuals began for the first time to self-identify by that term. Hunter intended for his drama \"to improve the socio-economic climate\" of Hancock County, and to \"lift the Melungeon name 'from shame to the hall of fame'.\"<ref name=\"Price\" />  The play helped revive interest in the history of Melungeons. The civil rights movement and social changes of the 1960s further contributed to wider acceptance of members of the group.  Research in social history and genealogy has documented new facts about people identified as Melungeons.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, popular interest in the Melungeons has grown tremendously, although many have left the area of historical concentration. Writer [[Bill Bryson]] devoted a chapter to them in his ''[[The Lost Continent: Travels in Small-Town America|The Lost Continent]]'' (1989). N. Brent Kennedy, a non-specialist, wrote a book on his claimed Melungeon roots, ''The Melungeons: The Resurrection of a Proud People'' (1994). With the advent of the internet, many people are researching family history and the number of people self-identifying as having Melungeon heritage has increased rapidly, according to Kennedy.<ref name=kennedy>{{cite book | last=Kennedy |first=N.

Others believe they have certain \"characteristic\" physical traits or conditions or assume that a multi-racial heritage means they are Melungeon.\n\nFor example, some Melungeons are allegedly identifiable by [[shovel-shaped incisors]], a dental feature more commonly found among, but not restricted to, Native Americans and Northeast Asians.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.um.u-tokyo.ac.jp/publish_db/Bulletin/no26/no26004.html |title=Yuji Mizoguchi, \"Shovelling: A Statistical Analysis of Its Morphology\", U. of Tokyo, Bulletin No.26, Feb 1985 |publisher=Um.u-tokyo.ac.jp |accessdate=2013-08-21}}</ref> A second feature attributed by some to Melungeons is an enlarged external [[occipital bun|occipital protuberance]], dubbed an \"Anatolian bump\", after an unsubstantiated hypothesis, popularized by N.

The 'Mediterranean look' of my own family ...\"</ref>  Academic historians have not found any evidence for this thesis, nor is it supported by results from the [[Melungeon DNA Project]], which shows an overwhelming northern European and African ancestry of the Melungeon lines.\n\nInternet sites promote the anecdotal claim that Melungeons are more prone to certain diseases, such as [[sarcoidosis]] or [[familial Mediterranean fever]]. Academic medical centers have noted that neither of the diseases is confined to a single population.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.genome.gov/12510679 |title=\"Learning About Familial Mediterranean Fever\", National Human Genome Research Institute |publisher=Genome.gov |date=2011-11-17 |accessdate=2013-08-21}}</ref>\n\nKennedy's claims of ancestral connections to this group have been disputed. The professional genealogist and historian, [[Virginia E. DeMarce]], reviewed his 1994 book and found that Kennedy's documentation of his Melungeon ancestry was seriously flawed. He had a very indistinct definition of Melungeons, although the group had already been extensively studied by other researchers.  She criticized Kennedy for trying to include people who might have had other than northern European ancestry and said that he did not properly take account of existing historical records or recognized genealogical practice in his research. He claimed to have ancestors who were persecuted for racial reasons. However, she found that his named ancestors were all classified as white in records, held various political offices (which showed they could vote and were supported by their community), and were landowners.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.geocities.com/ourmelungeons/demarce.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028045242/http://www.geocities.com/ourmelungeons/demarce.html |archivedate=2009-10-28 |title=Dr. Virginia DeMarce, Review Essay: The Melungeons, '&#39;National Genealogical Quarterly'&#39;, Vol. 84, No. 2, June 1996, pp. 134\u2013149 |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2013-08-21}}</ref> Kennedy responded to her critique in an article of his own.<ref>[http://underonesky.org/SEKMIE_PDF/SEKMIE3A.pdf \"Dr. Brent Kennedy Responds to Virginia DeMarce\", ''Southeastern Kentucky Melungeon Information Exchange]</ref>\n\nThe [[Ridgetop Shawnee|Ridgetop Shawnee Tribe of Indians]] in Kentucky, which is not federally recognized as an Indian tribe, claims that most families in its area who are commonly identified as Melungeon are of partial Native American descent. The Ridgetop Shawnee say their ancestors migrated to the region in the late 18th and early to mid-19th centuries. Most families claimed the Ridgetop Shawnee heritage to explain their dark skin and Indian features and to avoid racial persecution.

There is evidence for connections between some of them, going back to common ancestry in colonial Virginia. For example, the Goins surname group in eastern Tennessee has long been identified as Melungeon. The surname Goins is also found among the [[Lumbee]] of southern North Carolina, a multi-racial group that has been recognized by the state as a Native American tribe. In most cases, the multi-racial families have to be traced through specific branches and lines, as not all descendants were considered to be Melungeon or other groups.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Melungeon DNA Project]]\n* [[List of topics related to the African diaspora]]\n* [[Vardy Community School]]\n* [[Pardo]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Ball, Bonnie (1992).

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

It became known as the Armory Gardens after park superintendent [[Theodore Wirth]] created a formal design that included a [[U.S. National Guard]] armory (Kenwood Armory) for Spanish War volunteers.\n\nWorking as a civic and cultural center, in 1913 a floral convention transformed the land into floral gardens, which it remained for the next 50 years.  In 1934, six years after the Walker Art Gallery opened across the street, the Armory was demolished for its instability, and a new Armory built in downtown Minneapolis, turning the Armory Gardens over to the Minneapolis Park Board.

It became known as the Armory Gardens after park superintendent [[Theodore Wirth]] created a formal design that included a [[U.S. National Guard]] armory (Kenwood Armory) for Spanish War volunteers.\n\nWorking as a civic and cultural center, in 1913 a floral convention transformed the land into floral gardens, which it remained for the next 50 years.  In 1934, six years after the Walker Art Gallery opened across the street, the Armory was demolished for its instability, and a new Armory built in downtown Minneapolis, turning the Armory Gardens over to the Minneapolis Park Board.
