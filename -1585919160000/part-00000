It was the culmination of an offensive up the [[Virginia Peninsula]] by [[Union Army|Union]] [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George B. McClellan]], in which the [[Army of the Potomac]] reached the outskirts of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].\n\nOn May 31, [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] General [[Joseph E. Johnston]] attempted to overwhelm two Federal corps that appeared isolated south of the [[Chickahominy River]]. The Confederate assaults, although not well coordinated, succeeded in driving back the [[IV Corps (Union Army)|IV Corps]] and inflicting heavy casualties. Reinforcements arrived, and both sides fed more and more troops into the action. Supported by the [[III Corps (Union Army)|III Corps]] and Maj. Gen. [[John Sedgwick]]'s division of Maj. Gen. [[Edwin V. Sumner]]'s [[II Corps (Union Army)|II Corps]] (which crossed the rain-swollen river on Grapevine Bridge), the Federal position was finally stabilized. Gen. Johnston was seriously wounded during the action, and command of the Confederate army devolved temporarily to Maj. Gen. [[Gustavus Woodson Smith|G.W. Smith]]. On June 1, the Confederates renewed their assaults against the Federals, who had brought up more reinforcements, but made little headway. Both sides claimed victory.<ref name=NPS/>\n\nAlthough the battle was tactically inconclusive, it was the largest battle in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]] up to that time (and second only to [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]] in terms of casualties thus far, about 11,000 total). Gen. Johnston's injury also had profound influence on the war: it led to the appointment of [[Robert E. Lee]] as Confederate commander. The more aggressive Lee initiated the [[Seven Days Battles]], leading to a Union retreat in late June.<ref>Miller, p. 25.</ref> Seven Pines therefore marked the closest Union forces came to Richmond in this offensive.\n\n==Background==\nJohnston withdrew his 75,000-man army from the Virginia Peninsula as McClellan's army pursued him and approached the Confederate capital of Richmond. Johnston's defensive line began at the [[James River]] at [[Drewry's Bluff]], site of the recent Confederate [[Battle of Drewry's Bluff|naval victory]], and extended counterclockwise so that his center and left were behind the Chickahominy River, a natural barrier in the spring when it turned the land to the east of Richmond into swamps. Johnston's men burned most of the bridges over the Chickahominy and settled into strong defensive positions north and east of the city. McClellan positioned his 105,000-man army to focus on the northeast sector, for two reasons. First, the [[Pamunkey River]], which ran roughly parallel to the Chickahominy, offered a line of communication that could enable McClellan to get around Johnston's left flank. Second, McClellan anticipated the arrival of the [[I Corps (Union Army)|I Corps]] under Maj. Gen. [[Irwin McDowell]], scheduled to march south from Fredericksburg to reinforce his army, and thus needed to protect their avenue of approach.<ref>Salmon, p. 88; Eicher, pp. 273\u201374; Sears, pp. 95\u201397.</ref>\n\nThe Army of the Potomac pushed slowly up the Pamunkey, establishing supply bases at Eltham's Landing, Cumberland Landing, and White House Landing. White House, the plantation of [[William Henry Fitzhugh Lee|W.H.F. \"Rooney\" Lee]], son of General [[Robert E. Lee]], became McClellan's base of operations. Using the [[Richmond and York River Railroad]], McClellan could bring his heavy siege artillery to the outskirts of Richmond. He moved slowly and deliberately, reacting to faulty intelligence that led him to believe the Confederates outnumbered him significantly. By the end of May, the army had built bridges across the Chickahominy and was facing Richmond, straddling the river, with one third of the Army south of the river, two thirds north.<ref>Salmon, p. 90; Sears, pp. 104\u201306.</ref>\n\n==Opposing forces==\n\n===Union===\n\n{{main|Seven Pines Union order of battle}}\n\n{| style=\"align:left; margin-left:1em\"\n!bgcolor=\"#99ccff\"|Key Union Commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:George B McClellan - retouched.jpg|<center>Maj.

There were three corps north of the river, protecting the Union railroad supply line: the [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]] under [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Fitz John Porter]]; the [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI Corps]], under Brig. Gen. [[William B. Franklin]]; and the [[II Corps (Union Army)|II Corps]], under Brig. Gen. [[Edwin V. Sumner]]. South of the river were the [[IV Corps (Union Army)|IV Corps]], under Brig. Gen. [[Erasmus D. Keyes]], in a position far forward and close to the Confederate lines; and the [[III Corps (Union Army)|III Corps]], under Brig. Gen. [[Samuel P. Heintzelman]]. At the start of the battle on May 31, McClellan was confined to bed, ill with a flare-up of his chronic [[malaria]].<ref>Eicher, pp. 276\u201377.</ref>\n\n===Confederate===\n{{main|Seven Pines Confederate order of battle}}\n\n{| style=\"align:left; margin-left:1em\"\n!bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"|'''Key Confederate Commanders'''\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Joseph Johnston.jpg|<center>General<br/>[[Joseph E.

Magruder]]</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nJohnston had 60,000 men in his [[Army of Northern Virginia]] protecting the defensive works of Richmond in eight divisions commanded by Maj. Gen [[James Longstreet]], Maj.\nGen [[D.H. Hill]], Maj. Gen [[Benjamin Huger (general)|Benjamin Huger]], Maj. Gen [[Gustavus Woodson Smith|Gustavus Smith]], Maj. Gen [[A.P. Hill]] (who had just gotten command of a brand-new division on May 27), Maj. Gen [[John B. Magruder]], Brig. Gen [[David Rumph Jones]], and Maj. Gen [[Lafayette McLaws]]. Just prior to the battle, Johnson appointed Longstreet, Smith, and Magruder as wing commanders. Longstreet had the right wing, consisting of his own division, D.H. Hill's, and Huger's. Smith had the left wing, consisting of his division and A.P. Hill's, while Magruder had his division, Jones, and McLaws in the reserve wing. Brig. Gen [[Richard H. Anderson]] and Brig. Gen [[William H.C. Whiting]] had operational command of Longstreet and Smith's divisions.<ref>Eicher, p. 276.</ref>\n\n==Johnston's plan==\n[[File:Peninsula Campaign March 17 - May 31, 1862.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Peninsula Campaign, map of events up to the Battle of Seven Pines\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n\nJohnston, who had retreated up the Peninsula to the outskirts of Richmond, knew that he could not survive a massive siege and decided to attack McClellan. His original plan was to attack the Union right flank, north of the Chickahominy River, before McDowell's corps, marching south from [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]], could arrive. However, on May 27, the same day the [[Battle of Hanover Court House]] was fought northeast of Richmond, Johnston learned that McDowell's corps had been diverted to the [[Shenandoah Valley]] and would not be reinforcing the Army of the Potomac. He decided against attacking across his own natural defense line, the Chickahominy, and planned to capitalize on the Union army's straddle of the river by attacking the two corps south of the river, leaving them isolated from the other three corps north of the river.<ref>Salmon, pp. 20\u201321.</ref>\n\nIf executed correctly, Johnston would engage two thirds of his army (22 of its 29 infantry brigades, about 51,000 men) against the 33,000 men in the III and IV Corps. The Confederate attack plan was complex, calling for the divisions of A. P. Hill and Magruder to engage lightly and distract the Union forces north of the river, while Longstreet, commanding the main attack south of the river, was to converge on Keyes from three directions: six brigades under Longstreet's immediate command and four brigades under D. H. Hill were to advance on separate roads at a crossroads known as Seven Pines (because of seven large pine trees clustered at that location); three brigades under Huger were assigned to support Hill's right; Whiting's division was to follow Longstreet's column as a reserve. The plan had an excellent potential for initial success because the division of the IV Corps farthest forward, manning the earthworks a mile west of Seven Pines, was that of Brig. Gen. [[Silas Casey]], 6000 men who were the least experienced and equipped in Keyes's corps. If Keyes could be defeated, the III Corps, to the east, could be pinned against the Chickahominy and overwhelmed.<ref>Sears, pp. 118\u201320; Miller, p. 21; Salmon, pp. 91\u201392.</ref>\n\nThe complex plan was mismanaged from the start. Johnston chose to issue his orders to Longstreet orally in a long and rambling meeting on May 30. The other generals received written orders that were vague and contradictory. He also failed to notify all of the division commanders that Longstreet was in tactical command south of the river. (This missing detail was a serious oversight because both Huger and Smith technically outranked Longstreet.) On Longstreet's part, he either misunderstood his orders or chose to modify them without informing Johnston. Rather than taking his assigned avenue of advance on the Nine Mile Road, his column joined Hill's on the Williamsburg Road, which not only delayed the advance, but limited the attack to a narrow front with only a fraction of its total force. Exacerbating the problems on both sides was a severe thunderstorm on the night of May 30, which flooded the river, destroyed most of the Union bridges, and turned the roads into morasses of mud.<ref>Sears, p. 120; Miller, pp. 21\u201322; Downs, pp. 675\u201376; Salmon, p. 92.</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Seven Pines.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Battle of Seven Pines]]\n\nThe attack got off to a bad start on May 31 when Longstreet marched down the Charles City Road and turned onto the Williamsburg Road instead of the Nine Mile Road. Huger's orders had not specified a time that the attack was scheduled to start and he was not awakened until he heard a division marching nearby. Johnston and his second-in-command, Smith, unaware of Longstreet's location or Huger's delay, waited at their headquarters for word of the start of the battle. Five hours after the scheduled start, at 1 p.m., D.H. Hill became impatient and sent his brigades forward against Casey's division.<ref>Miller, p. 22; Eicher, p. 276; Sears, pp. 121\u201323.</ref>\n\nHill's division, some 10,000 men strong, came charging out of the woods. The 100th and 81st New York regiments had been placed up front as heavy skirmish lines, and Hill's assault rolled completely over them. Casey's line, manned by inexperienced troops, buckled with some men retreating, but fought fiercely for possession of their earthworks, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. The Confederates only engaged four brigades of the thirteen on their right flank that day, so they did not hit with the power that they could have concentrated on this weak point in the Union line. Casey sent a frantic request for help, but Keyes was slow in responding. Eventually the mass of Confederates broke through, seized a Union redoubt, and Casey's men retreated to the second line of defensive works at Seven Pines. During this period, both of the high commanders were unaware of the severity of the battle. As late as 2:30&nbsp;p.m., Heintzelman reported to McClellan, still sick in bed, that he had received no word from Keyes. Johnston was only 2\u00bd miles from the front, but an [[acoustic shadow]] prevented him from hearing the sounds of cannons and musketry and he and his staff did not know the battle had begun until 4 p.m. Hill, whose four brigades had been fighting alone for almost four hours, sent a message to Longstreet requesting reinforcements, but Longstreet sent forward only Richard Anderson's brigade. Brig. Gen [[Robert Rodes]] went down wounded in the desperate fighting around Seven Pines. Col. [[John B. Gordon]] of the [[6th Alabama Infantry|6th Alabama]], a future major general, took over command of Rodes's brigade. Most of the officers in the 6th Alabama went down, although Gordon himself survived the battle without an injury despite his clothing and canteen being pierced by several bullets. Gordon also glimpsed his 19-year-old brother Augustus, a captain in the regiment, laying among a pile of dead and dying men with a chest wound, but with the battle raging, had no time to stop and tend to him (Augustus Gordon ultimately survived his injury). Rodes' brigade in total lost more than 50% of its strength. Also wounded was Brig.\nGen [[Gabriel Rains]], a few days shy of his 59th birthday and one of the oldest officers in the Army of the Northern Virginia. Command of his brigade devolved on Col. [[Alfred Colquitt]] of the 6th Georgia, who would eventually be appointed permanent commander of the brigade.<ref>Eicher, p. 277; Salmon, p. 93.</ref>\n\n[[File:Brady - Balloon ascension of Thaddeus Lowe at Seven Pines HD-SN-99-01888.JPEG|thumb|left|Prof. Lowe ascending in the ''Intrepid'' to observe the Battle of Seven Pines]]\nThe Army of the Potomac was accompanied by the [[Union Army Balloon Corps]] commanded by Prof. [[Thaddeus S. C. Lowe]], who had established two balloon camps on the north side of the river, one at Gaines's Farm and one at Mechanicsville. Lowe reported on May 29 the buildup of Confederate forces to the left of New Bridge or in front of the Fair Oaks train station.<ref name=Lowe133>Lowe, p. 133.</ref> With constant rain on May 30 and heavy winds the morning of May 31, the [[aerostat]]s ''Washington'' and ''Intrepid'' did not launch until noon.

Gen. [[Darius N. Couch]], and Brig. Gen. [[Philip Kearny]]'s division from Heintzelman's III Corps. Hill organized a flanking maneuver, sending four regiments under Col. [[Micah Jenkins]] from Longstreet's command to attack Keyes's right flank. The attack collapsed the Federal line back to the Williamsburg Road, a mile and a half beyond Seven Pines. Meanwhile, another of Longstreet's brigades under Col. [[James L. Kemper]], arrived on the field and charged the Union lines, but artillery fire forced them to retreat. The fighting in that part of the line died out by 7:30&nbsp;p.m. During the evening, Longstreet himself arrived on the field along with the remaining four brigades of his division, as well as the three brigades of Huger's division. On the Union side, Brig. Gen Israel Richardson's division of the II Corps arrived on the field,\nalong with Joe Hooker's division of the III Corps (minus one brigade and the division artillery which were left guarding the bridges over White Oak Swamp).<ref>Miller, p. 23; Eicher, pp. 277\u201378; Salmon, p. 94.</ref>\n\nJust before Hill's attack began, Johnston received a note at approximately 4:00 pm from Longstreet requesting that he join the battle, the first news he had heard of the fighting. Johnston went forward on the Nine Mile Road, with a five brigade division led by Brig. Gen. William Chase Whiting. Hours earlier that day, Whiting had been elevated into command of Maj. Gen. Gustavus Smith's division. As the lead regiment of the division, led by Col. Dorsey Pender, 6th NC, reached the railroad crossing artillery guns opened on Pender's advance. This opened the segment of the Battle of Seven Pines to be known as the Battle of Fair Oaks Station. The guns were a part of Brig. Gen John Abercrombie's brigade of Couch's division and they began to put up a stiff resistance. Whiting advanced his former brigade, commanded by Col. [[Evander Law]], to attack the Union artillery off to his left, but was stopped by Abercrombie's brigade and his four artillery pieces. Meanwhile, the commander of the II Corps, Brig. Gen [[Edwin V. Sumner]], had brought his command into action from its entrenchments north of the Chickahominy. When told that crossing the rain-swollen river was impossible, Sumner replied \"Impossible!? Sir, I tell you I can cross. I am ordered!\" The first II Corps brigade to arrive on the field was Brig. Gen [[Willis Gorman]]'s brigade of Brig. Gen [[John Sedgwick]]'s division, which contacted the attack of Col. [[Evander Law|Evander Law]]'s brigade. Law's attack was initiated by Col. William Dorsey Pender of the 6th NC and was later assisted by the brigades of Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew and Col. Wade Hampton III. The three brigades experienced no success as Sumner brought forth two additional brigades and another battery of artillery from Sedgwick's division. During the final attack, Confederate Brig. Gen. [[Robert H. Hatton|Robert Hatton]], one of the Army of Virginia's newest brigadiers, having just been promoted from colonel of the [[7th Tennessee Infantry|7th Tennessee]] on May 23, 1862, was shot in the head leading his brigade into action and died instantly. Hampton meanwhile was shot in the ankle. Brig. Gen [[J. Johnston Pettigrew]] gravely wounded and left for dead on the field, later being taken prisoner by Sedgwick's division. The repeated assaults on Sedgwick's line were unsuccessful, as the latter's artillery also pounded Whiting's troops, who had no artillery to answer back. A final surge by Whiting's four brigades resulted in a heavy loss of casualties as Sumner mounted a counter attack that drove the Confederate force from the field. It was after this counter attack that Pettigrew was discovered and sent to a Union field hospital for the care of his wounds. Shortly before Sumner's counter attack, Johnston received two wounds and was removed from the field. Command of the army transferred to Maj. Gen. Gustavus Smith. With darkness approaching, over 1200 casualties, and most of his officers killed or wounded, Whiting called off the attacks. Sedgwick's division had lost less than 400 men. Two of Magruder's brigades reached the field at dusk, but had no involvement in any of the fighting.\nWhiting's fifth brigade, the famous Texas Brigade of Brig. Gen [[John B. Hood]], had not fought either; it had been sent off to reinforce Longstreet and was stationed in the woods some distance to the west of Fair Oak Station.<ref>Eicher, p. 278; Sears, pp. 136\u201338, 143; Miller, p. 23; Salmon, p. 94.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Fair Oaks Meagher.jpg|thumb|left|General [[Thomas Francis Meagher]] at the Battle of Fair Oaks, June 1, 1862]]\nThe most historically significant incident of the day occurred around dusk, when Johnston was struck in the right shoulder by a bullet, immediately followed by a shell fragment hitting him in the chest. He fell unconscious from his horse with a broken right shoulder blade and two broken ribs and was evacuated to Richmond. G.W. Smith assumed temporary command of the army. Smith, plagued with ill health, was indecisive about the next steps for the battle and made a bad impression on [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] and General [[Robert E. Lee]], Davis's military adviser. After the end of fighting the following day, Davis replaced Smith with Lee as commander of the Army of Northern Virginia.<ref>Sears, pp. 145; Miller, p. 24; Salmon, p. 94.</ref>\n\nDuring the night of May 31-June 1, scouts in Israel Richardson's division reported two Confederate regiments camped only about 100 yards away. Richardson declined to make a risky night attack, but had his troops form a line of battle just in case. By daybreak however, the enemy regiments had withdrawn from their exposed location. At 6:30 AM, the Confederates resumed their attacks. Two of Huger's three brigades, commanded by Brig. Gens [[William Mahone]] and [[Lewis Armistead]] (the third under Brig. Gen [[Albert G. Blanchard]] was held in reserve) assaulted Richardson's division and momentarily drove part of it back, but Richardson's men rallied. They were reinforced by Brig. Gen [[David B. Birney]]'s brigade of Kearny's division, which had not been engaged the previous day as Birney had accidentally taken the wrong road and gotten lost. He was arrested by Heintzelman for disobeying orders and the brigade was temporarily commanded by Col. [[J. H. Hobart Ward]] of the [[38th New York Infantry|38th New York]] (Heintzelman attempted to have Birney court-martialed, but a military tribunal cleared him of all charges and he was restored to command of his brigade two weeks later). After fierce fighting, Huger's division was forced to retreat. In his official report of the battle, Mahone stated his casualties at 338 men. Armistead's report did not give a casualty figure, but his losses were undoubtedly heavy as well. On the Union side, total losses in Richardson and Birney's outfits numbered 948 men, including Brig. Gen [[Oliver O. Howard]], whose right arm was shattered by a Minie ball, necessitating an amputation that kept Howard out of action for months. Approximately 60% of Richardson's total casualties came from Howard's brigade. Pickett's brigade, to the right of Armistead, lost 350 men. To the south, the brigades of Roger Pryor and Cadmus Wilcox were attacked by Hooker's division. Although both brigades resisted stubbornly, the order was given to retreat, which they did with some reluctance. By mid-morning, the Confederates withdrew to Casey's earthworks west of Seven Pines and the fighting ended.<ref>Sears, pp. 142\u201345.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Aftermath of Seven Pines.jpg|thumb|Burying the dead and burning dead horses after the battle]]\nBoth sides claimed victory with roughly equal casualties, but neither side's accomplishment was impressive.  George B. McClellan's advance on Richmond was halted and the Army of Northern Virginia fell back into the Richmond defensive works. Union casualties were 5,031 (790 killed, 3,594 wounded, 647 captured or missing) and Confederate 6,134 (980 killed, 4,749 wounded, 405 captured or missing), making it the largest and bloodiest battle of the war to date after [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]] eight weeks earlier.<ref name=Sears147/> The battle was frequently remembered by the Union soldiers as the Battle of Fair Oaks Station because that is where they did their best fighting, whereas the Confederates, for the same reason, called it Seven Pines. Historian Stephen W. Sears remarked that its current common name, Seven Pines, is the most appropriate because it was at the crossroads of Seven Pines that the heaviest fighting and highest casualties occurred.<ref>Sears, p. 149.</ref> A contemporary map drawn by private Julius Honore Bayol of the 5th Alabama Infantry Regiment,<ref>WorldCat, Battlefield of 31st May and 1st June, 1862.

He wrote to his wife, \"I am tired of the sickening sight of the battlefield, with its mangled corpses & poor suffering wounded! Victory has no charms for me when purchased at such cost.\"<ref>Eicher, p. 279.</ref> He redeployed all of his army except for the V Corps south of the river, and although he continued to plan for a siege and the capture of Richmond, he lost the strategic initiative. Casey's division was unjustly blamed for the near-disaster, and McClellan had Casey removed from command. The hapless division would play no further role in the campaign, being relegated to guard duty at Harrison's Landing along the James River, and was left behind permanently on the peninsula after the Army of the Potomac returned to Washington D.C. in early August. An offensive begun by the new Confederate commander, Gen. Robert E. Lee, would be planned while the Union troops passively sat in the outskirts of Richmond. The [[Seven Days Battles]] of June 25 through July 1, 1862, drove the Union Army back to the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] and saved the Confederate capital.<ref>Miller, pp. 25\u201360.</ref>\n\nAfter taking command, Robert E. Lee embarked on a reorganization of the Confederate army, breaking up and reassigning some brigades, nominating replacements for dead and wounded officers, and removing two brigadiers, [[Albert G. Blanchard]] and [[Raleigh Colston]], who had failed to get their units into action during the battle and generally delivered a below-average performance. The change in leadership of the Confederate Army in the field as a result of Seven Pines had a profound effect on the war. On June 24, 1862, McClellan's massive Army of the Potomac was within {{convert|6|mi|km}} of the Confederate capital of Richmond; Union soldiers wrote that they could hear church bells ringing in the city. Within 90 days, however, Robert E. Lee had driven McClellan from the Peninsula, [[John Pope (military officer)|Pope]] had been soundly beaten at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], and the battle lines were {{convert|20|mi|km}} from the Union capital in Washington. It would take almost two more years before the Union Army again got that close to Richmond, and almost three years before it finally captured it.\n\nAdditionally, the battle is notable for being where [[Henry Wirz]] lost the use of his right arm, after being shot by a [[Minie ball]] while fighting as a [[Private (rank)|private]] of the Confederate army. He was taken out of combat duty, eventually becoming the [[commandant]] of [[Camp Sumter]], a Confederate [[prisoner-of-war]] camp notorious for its terrible conditions where nearly 13,000 Union detainees died. The camp became one of the best known horrors of the Civil War, and Wirz was later one of only two men tried and executed for [[war crimes]] during the war.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|American Civil War}}\n* [[Troop engagements of the American Civil War, 1862]]\n* [[Peninsula Campaign]] and [[Siege of Yorktown (1862)]]\n* [[List of costliest American Civil War land battles]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n<ref name=cwsac>[http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/CWSII/VirginiaBattlefieldProfiles/Sappony%20Church%20to%20Spotsylvania%20Court%20House.pdf CWSAC Report Update]</ref>\n}}\n\n==References==\n* Downs, Alan C. \"Fair Oaks/Seven Pines.\" In ''Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History'', edited by David S.

It was the culmination of an offensive up the [[Virginia Peninsula]] by [[Union Army|Union]] [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George B. McClellan]], in which the [[Army of the Potomac]] reached the outskirts of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].\n\nOn May 31, [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] General [[Joseph E. Johnston]] attempted to overwhelm two Federal corps that appeared isolated south of the [[Chickahominy River]]. The Confederate assaults, although not well coordinated, succeeded in driving back the [[IV Corps (Union Army)|IV Corps]] and inflicting heavy casualties. Reinforcements arrived, and both sides fed more and more troops into the action. Supported by the [[III Corps (Union Army)|III Corps]] and Maj. Gen. [[John Sedgwick]]'s division of Maj. Gen. [[Edwin V. Sumner]]'s [[II Corps (Union Army)|II Corps]] (which crossed the rain-swollen river on Grapevine Bridge), the Federal position was finally stabilized. Gen. Johnston was seriously wounded during the action, and command of the Confederate army devolved temporarily to Maj. Gen. [[Gustavus Woodson Smith|G.W. Smith]]. On June 1, the Confederates renewed their assaults against the Federals, who had brought up more reinforcements, but made little headway. Both sides claimed victory.<ref name=NPS/>\n\nAlthough the battle was tactically inconclusive, it was the largest battle in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]] up to that time (and second only to [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]] in terms of casualties thus far, about 11,000 total). Gen. Johnston's injury also had profound influence on the war: it led to the appointment of [[Robert E. Lee]] as Confederate commander. The more aggressive Lee initiated the [[Seven Days Battles]], leading to a Union retreat in late June.<ref>Miller, p. 25.</ref> Seven Pines therefore marked the closest Union forces came to Richmond in this offensive.\n\n==Background==\nJohnston withdrew his 75,000-man army from the Virginia Peninsula as McClellan's army pursued him and approached the Confederate capital of Richmond. Johnston's defensive line began at the [[James River]] at [[Drewry's Bluff]], site of the recent Confederate [[Battle of Drewry's Bluff|naval victory]], and extended counterclockwise so that his center and left were behind the Chickahominy River, a natural barrier in the spring when it turned the land to the east of Richmond into swamps. Johnston's men burned most of the bridges over the Chickahominy and settled into strong defensive positions north and east of the city. McClellan positioned his 105,000-man army to focus on the northeast sector, for two reasons. First, the [[Pamunkey River]], which ran roughly parallel to the Chickahominy, offered a line of communication that could enable McClellan to get around Johnston's left flank. Second, McClellan anticipated the arrival of the [[I Corps (Union Army)|I Corps]] under Maj. Gen. [[Irwin McDowell]], scheduled to march south from Fredericksburg to reinforce his army, and thus needed to protect their avenue of approach.<ref>Salmon, p. 88; Eicher, pp. 273\u201374; Sears, pp. 95\u201397.</ref>\n\nThe Army of the Potomac pushed slowly up the Pamunkey, establishing supply bases at Eltham's Landing, Cumberland Landing, and White House Landing. White House, the plantation of [[William Henry Fitzhugh Lee|W.H.F. \"Rooney\" Lee]], son of General [[Robert E. Lee]], became McClellan's base of operations. Using the [[Richmond and York River Railroad]], McClellan could bring his heavy siege artillery to the outskirts of Richmond. He moved slowly and deliberately, reacting to faulty intelligence that led him to believe the Confederates outnumbered him significantly. By the end of May, the army had built bridges across the Chickahominy and was facing Richmond, straddling the river, with one third of the Army south of the river, two thirds north.<ref>Salmon, p. 90; Sears, pp. 104\u201306.</ref>\n\n==Opposing forces==\n\n===Union===\n\n{{main|Seven Pines Union order of battle}}\n\n{| style=\"align:left; margin-left:1em\"\n!bgcolor=\"#99ccff\"|Key Union Commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:George B McClellan - retouched.jpg|<center>Maj.

There were three corps north of the river, protecting the Union railroad supply line: the [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]] under [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Fitz John Porter]]; the [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI Corps]], under Brig. Gen. [[William B. Franklin]]; and the [[II Corps (Union Army)|II Corps]], under Brig. Gen. [[Edwin V. Sumner]]. South of the river were the [[IV Corps (Union Army)|IV Corps]], under Brig. Gen. [[Erasmus D. Keyes]], in a position far forward and close to the Confederate lines; and the [[III Corps (Union Army)|III Corps]], under Brig. Gen. [[Samuel P. Heintzelman]]. At the start of the battle on May 31, McClellan was confined to bed, ill with a flare-up of his chronic [[malaria]].<ref>Eicher, pp. 276\u201377.</ref>\n\n===Confederate===\n{{main|Seven Pines Confederate order of battle}}\n\n{| style=\"align:left; margin-left:1em\"\n!bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"|'''Key Confederate Commanders'''\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Joseph Johnston.jpg|<center>General<br/>[[Joseph E.

Gen [[James Longstreet]], Maj.\nGen [[D.H. Hill]], Maj. Gen [[Benjamin Huger (general)|Benjamin Huger]], Maj. Gen [[Gustavus Woodson Smith|Gustavus Smith]], Maj. Gen [[A.P. Hill]] (who had just gotten command of a brand-new division on May 27), Maj. Gen [[John B. Magruder]], Brig. Gen [[David Rumph Jones]], and Maj. Gen [[Lafayette McLaws]]. Just prior to the battle, Johnson appointed Longstreet, Smith, and Magruder as wing commanders. Longstreet had the right wing, consisting of his own division, D.H. Hill's, and Huger's. Smith had the left wing, consisting of his division and A.P. Hill's, while Magruder had his division, Jones, and McLaws in the reserve wing. Brig. Gen [[Richard H. Anderson]] and Brig. Gen [[William H.C. Whiting]] had operational command of Longstreet and Smith's divisions.<ref>Eicher, p. 276.</ref>\n\n==Johnston's plan==\n[[File:Peninsula Campaign March 17 - May 31, 1862.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Peninsula Campaign, map of events up to the Battle of Seven Pines\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n\nJohnston, who had retreated up the Peninsula to the outskirts of Richmond, knew that he could not survive a massive siege and decided to attack McClellan. His original plan was to attack the Union right flank, north of the Chickahominy River, before McDowell's corps, marching south from [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]], could arrive. However, on May 27, the same day the [[Battle of Hanover Court House]] was fought northeast of Richmond, Johnston learned that McDowell's corps had been diverted to the [[Shenandoah Valley]] and would not be reinforcing the Army of the Potomac. He decided against attacking across his own natural defense line, the Chickahominy, and planned to capitalize on the Union army's straddle of the river by attacking the two corps south of the river, leaving them isolated from the other three corps north of the river.<ref>Salmon, pp. 20\u201321.</ref>\n\nIf executed correctly, Johnston would engage two thirds of his army (22 of its 29 infantry brigades, about 51,000 men) against the 33,000 men in the III and IV Corps. The Confederate attack plan was complex, calling for the divisions of A. P. Hill and Magruder to engage lightly and distract the Union forces north of the river, while Longstreet, commanding the main attack south of the river, was to converge on Keyes from three directions: six brigades under Longstreet's immediate command and four brigades under D. H. Hill were to advance on separate roads at a crossroads known as Seven Pines (because of seven large pine trees clustered at that location); three brigades under Huger were assigned to support Hill's right; Whiting's division was to follow Longstreet's column as a reserve. The plan had an excellent potential for initial success because the division of the IV Corps farthest forward, manning the earthworks a mile west of Seven Pines, was that of Brig. Gen. [[Silas Casey]], 6000 men who were the least experienced and equipped in Keyes's corps. If Keyes could be defeated, the III Corps, to the east, could be pinned against the Chickahominy and overwhelmed.<ref>Sears, pp. 118\u201320; Miller, p. 21; Salmon, pp. 91\u201392.</ref>\n\nThe complex plan was mismanaged from the start. Johnston chose to issue his orders to Longstreet orally in a long and rambling meeting on May 30. The other generals received written orders that were vague and contradictory. He also failed to notify all of the division commanders that Longstreet was in tactical command south of the river. (This missing detail was a serious oversight because both Huger and Smith technically outranked Longstreet.) On Longstreet's part, he either misunderstood his orders or chose to modify them without informing Johnston. Rather than taking his assigned avenue of advance on the Nine Mile Road, his column joined Hill's on the Williamsburg Road, which not only delayed the advance, but limited the attack to a narrow front with only a fraction of its total force. Exacerbating the problems on both sides was a severe thunderstorm on the night of May 30, which flooded the river, destroyed most of the Union bridges, and turned the roads into morasses of mud.<ref>Sears, p. 120; Miller, pp. 21\u201322; Downs, pp. 675\u201376; Salmon, p. 92.</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Seven Pines.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Battle of Seven Pines]]\n\nThe attack got off to a bad start on May 31 when Longstreet marched down the Charles City Road and turned onto the Williamsburg Road instead of the Nine Mile Road. Huger's orders had not specified a time that the attack was scheduled to start and he was not awakened until he heard a division marching nearby. Johnston and his second-in-command, Smith, unaware of Longstreet's location or Huger's delay, waited at their headquarters for word of the start of the battle. Five hours after the scheduled start, at 1 p.m., D.H. Hill became impatient and sent his brigades forward against Casey's division.<ref>Miller, p. 22; Eicher, p. 276; Sears, pp. 121\u201323.</ref>\n\nHill's division, some 10,000 men strong, came charging out of the woods. The 100th and 81st New York regiments had been placed up front as heavy skirmish lines, and Hill's assault rolled completely over them. Casey's line, manned by inexperienced troops, buckled with some men retreating, but fought fiercely for possession of their earthworks, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. The Confederates only engaged four brigades of the thirteen on their right flank that day, so they did not hit with the power that they could have concentrated on this weak point in the Union line. Casey sent a frantic request for help, but Keyes was slow in responding. Eventually the mass of Confederates broke through, seized a Union redoubt, and Casey's men retreated to the second line of defensive works at Seven Pines. During this period, both of the high commanders were unaware of the severity of the battle. As late as 2:30&nbsp;p.m., Heintzelman reported to McClellan, still sick in bed, that he had received no word from Keyes. Johnston was only 2\u00bd miles from the front, but an [[acoustic shadow]] prevented him from hearing the sounds of cannons and musketry and he and his staff did not know the battle had begun until 4 p.m. Hill, whose four brigades had been fighting alone for almost four hours, sent a message to Longstreet requesting reinforcements, but Longstreet sent forward only Richard Anderson's brigade. Brig. Gen [[Robert Rodes]] went down wounded in the desperate fighting around Seven Pines. Col. [[John B. Gordon]] of the [[6th Alabama Infantry|6th Alabama]], a future major general, took over command of Rodes's brigade. Most of the officers in the 6th Alabama went down, although Gordon himself survived the battle without an injury despite his clothing and canteen being pierced by several bullets. Gordon also glimpsed his 19-year-old brother Augustus, a captain in the regiment, laying among a pile of dead and dying men with a chest wound, but with the battle raging, had no time to stop and tend to him (Augustus Gordon ultimately survived his injury). Rodes' brigade in total lost more than 50% of its strength. Also wounded was Brig.\nGen [[Gabriel Rains]], a few days shy of his 59th birthday and one of the oldest officers in the Army of the Northern Virginia. Command of his brigade devolved on Col. [[Alfred Colquitt]] of the 6th Georgia, who would eventually be appointed permanent commander of the brigade.<ref>Eicher, p. 277; Salmon, p. 93.</ref>\n\n[[File:Brady - Balloon ascension of Thaddeus Lowe at Seven Pines HD-SN-99-01888.JPEG|thumb|left|Prof. Lowe ascending in the ''Intrepid'' to observe the Battle of Seven Pines]]\nThe Army of the Potomac was accompanied by the [[Union Army Balloon Corps]] commanded by Prof. [[Thaddeus S. C. Lowe]], who had established two balloon camps on the north side of the river, one at Gaines's Farm and one at Mechanicsville. Lowe reported on May 29 the buildup of Confederate forces to the left of New Bridge or in front of the Fair Oaks train station.<ref name=Lowe133>Lowe, p. 133.</ref> With constant rain on May 30 and heavy winds the morning of May 31, the [[aerostat]]s ''Washington'' and ''Intrepid'' did not launch until noon.

On June 1, Lowe reported that the Confederate barracks to the left of Richmond as being free from smoke.<ref>Lowe, pp. 135\u2013137.</ref> McClellan did not follow up on this information with a counterattack by his corps north of the Chickahominy River.<ref>Sears, pp. 149\u2013150.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Seven Pines, or Fair Oaks.png|thumb|''The Battle of Fair Oaks, Va.'' by Currier and Ives (1862)]]\nAround 4:40&nbsp;p.m., Hill, now strengthened by the arrival of Richard Anderson's brigade, hit the secondary Union line near Seven Pines, which was manned by the remnants of Casey's division, the IV Corps division of Brig. Gen. [[Darius N. Couch]], and Brig. Gen. [[Philip Kearny]]'s division from Heintzelman's III Corps. Hill organized a flanking maneuver, sending four regiments under Col. [[Micah Jenkins]] from Longstreet's command to attack Keyes's right flank. The attack collapsed the Federal line back to the Williamsburg Road, a mile and a half beyond Seven Pines. Meanwhile, another of Longstreet's brigades under Col. [[James L. Kemper]], arrived on the field and charged the Union lines, but artillery fire forced them to retreat. The fighting in that part of the line died out by 7:30&nbsp;p.m. During the evening, Longstreet himself arrived on the field along with the remaining four brigades of his division, as well as the three brigades of Huger's division. On the Union side, Brig. Gen Israel Richardson's division of the II Corps arrived on the field,\nalong with Joe Hooker's division of the III Corps (minus one brigade and the division artillery which were left guarding the bridges over White Oak Swamp).<ref>Miller, p. 23; Eicher, pp. 277\u201378; Salmon, p. 94.</ref>\n\nJust before Hill's attack began, Johnston received a note from Longstreet requesting that he join the battle, the first news he had heard of the fighting. Johnston went forward on the Nine Mile Road with four brigades of Whiting's division and encountered stiff resistance from Brig. Gen Charles Devens brigade of Couch's division. Meanwhile, the commander of the II Corps, Brig. Gen [[Edwin V. Sumner]], had brought his command into action from its entrenchments north of the Chickahominy. When told that crossing the rain-swollen river was impossible, Sumner replied \"Impossible!? Sir, I tell you I can cross. I am ordered!\" The first II Corps brigade to arrive on the field was Brig. Gen [[William W. Burns]]'s brigade of Brig. Gen [[John Sedgwick]]'s division, which contacted Brig. Gen [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]]'s brigade. After Hampton managed some initial success in forcing back Burns, the latter was quickly reinforced by the other two brigades of Sedgwick's division. Brig. Gen. [[Robert H. Hatton|Robert Hatton]], one of the Army of Northern Virginia's newest brigadiers, having just been promoted from colonel of the [[7th Tennessee Infantry|7th Tennessee]] a few weeks earlier, was shot in the head leading his brigade into action and died instantly. Hampton meanwhile was shot in the ankle, and Brig. Gen [[J. Johnston Pettigrew]] gravely wounded and left for dead on the field, later being taken prisoner by Sedgwick's division. Repeated assaults on Sedgwick's line were unsuccessful, and the latter's artillery also pounded Whiting's troops, who had no artillery to answer back. Hampton was forced to stretch his brigade's line to near breaking point to prevent his left flank from being overlapped. Meanwhile, Whiting's brigade, commanded by Col. [[William D. Pender]], attempted to attack the Union artillery off to the right, but was cut off by Sedgwick's infantry. With darkness approaching, over 1000 casualties, and most of his officers killed or wounded, Whiting called off the attacks. Sedgwick's division had lost less than 400 men. Two of Magruder's brigades reached the field at dusk, but had no involvement in any of the fighting.\nWhiting's fifth brigade, the famous Texas Brigade of Brig. Gen [[John B. Hood]], had not fought either; it had been sent off to reinforce Longstreet and was stationed in the woods some distance to the west of Fair Oak Station.<ref>Eicher, p. 278; Sears, pp. 136\u201338, 143; Miller, p. 23; Salmon, p. 94.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Fair Oaks Meagher.jpg|thumb|left|General [[Thomas Francis Meagher]] at the Battle of Fair Oaks, June 1, 1862]]\nThe most historically significant incident of the day occurred around dusk, when Johnston was struck in the right shoulder by a bullet, immediately followed by a shell fragment hitting him in the chest. He fell unconscious from his horse with a broken right shoulder blade and two broken ribs and was evacuated to Richmond. G.W. Smith assumed temporary command of the army. Smith, plagued with ill health, was indecisive about the next steps for the battle and made a bad impression on [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] and General [[Robert E. Lee]], Davis's military adviser. After the end of fighting the following day, Davis replaced Smith with Lee as commander of the Army of Northern Virginia.<ref>Sears, pp. 145; Miller, p. 24; Salmon, p. 94.</ref>\n\nDuring the night of May 31-June 1, scouts in Israel Richardson's division reported two Confederate regiments camped only about 100 yards away. Richardson declined to make a risky night attack, but had his troops form a line of battle just in case. By daybreak however, the enemy regiments had withdrawn from their exposed location. At 6:30 AM, the Confederates resumed their attacks. Two of Huger's three brigades, commanded by Brig. Gens [[William Mahone]] and [[Lewis Armistead]] (the third under Brig. Gen [[Albert G. Blanchard]] was held in reserve) assaulted Richardson's division and momentarily drove part of it back, but Richardson's men rallied. They were reinforced by Brig. Gen [[David B. Birney]]'s brigade of Kearny's division, which had not been engaged the previous day as Birney had accidentally taken the wrong road and gotten lost. He was arrested by Heintzelman for disobeying orders and the brigade was temporarily commanded by Col. [[J. H. Hobart Ward]] of the [[38th New York Infantry|38th New York]] (Heintzelman attempted to have Birney court-martialed, but a military tribunal cleared him of all charges and he was restored to command of his brigade two weeks later). After fierce fighting, Huger's division was forced to retreat. In his official report of the battle, Mahone stated his casualties at 338 men. Armistead's report did not give a casualty figure, but his losses were undoubtedly heavy as well. On the Union side, total losses in Richardson and Birney's outfits numbered 948 men, including Brig. Gen [[Oliver O. Howard]], whose right arm was shattered by a Minie ball, necessitating an amputation that kept Howard out of action for months. Approximately 60% of Richardson's total casualties came from Howard's brigade. Pickett's brigade, to the right of Armistead, lost 350 men. To the south, the brigades of Roger Pryor and Cadmus Wilcox were attacked by Hooker's division. Although both brigades resisted stubbornly, the order was given to retreat, which they did with some reluctance. By mid-morning, the Confederates withdrew to Casey's earthworks west of Seven Pines and the fighting ended.<ref>Sears, pp. 142\u201345.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Aftermath of Seven Pines.jpg|thumb|Burying the dead and burning dead horses after the battle]]\nBoth sides claimed victory with roughly equal casualties, but neither side's accomplishment was impressive.  George B. McClellan's advance on Richmond was halted and the Army of Northern Virginia fell back into the Richmond defensive works. Union casualties were 5,031 (790 killed, 3,594 wounded, 647 captured or missing) and Confederate 6,134 (980 killed, 4,749 wounded, 405 captured or missing), making it the largest and bloodiest battle of the war to date after [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]] eight weeks earlier.<ref name=Sears147/> The battle was frequently remembered by the Union soldiers as the Battle of Fair Oaks Station because that is where they did their best fighting, whereas the Confederates, for the same reason, called it Seven Pines. Historian Stephen W. Sears remarked that its current common name, Seven Pines, is the most appropriate because it was at the crossroads of Seven Pines that the heaviest fighting and highest casualties occurred.<ref>Sears, p. 149.</ref> A contemporary map drawn by private Julius Honore Bayol of the 5th Alabama Infantry Regiment,<ref>WorldCat, Battlefield of 31st May and 1st June, 1862.

He wrote to his wife, \"I am tired of the sickening sight of the battlefield, with its mangled corpses & poor suffering wounded! Victory has no charms for me when purchased at such cost.\"<ref>Eicher, p. 279.</ref> He redeployed all of his army except for the V Corps south of the river, and although he continued to plan for a siege and the capture of Richmond, he lost the strategic initiative. Casey's division was unjustly blamed for the near-disaster, and McClellan had Casey removed from command. The hapless division would play no further role in the campaign, being relegated to guard duty at Harrison's Landing along the James River, and was left behind permanently on the peninsula after the Army of the Potomac returned to Washington D.C. in early August. An offensive begun by the new Confederate commander, Gen. Robert E. Lee, would be planned while the Union troops passively sat in the outskirts of Richmond. The [[Seven Days Battles]] of June 25 through July 1, 1862, drove the Union Army back to the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] and saved the Confederate capital.<ref>Miller, pp. 25\u201360.</ref>\n\nAfter taking command, Robert E. Lee embarked on a reorganization of the Confederate army, breaking up and reassigning some brigades, nominating replacements for dead and wounded officers, and removing two brigadiers, [[Albert G. Blanchard]] and [[Raleigh Colston]], who had failed to get their units into action during the battle and generally delivered a below-average performance. The change in leadership of the Confederate Army in the field as a result of Seven Pines had a profound effect on the war. On June 24, 1862, McClellan's massive Army of the Potomac was within {{convert|6|mi|km}} of the Confederate capital of Richmond; Union soldiers wrote that they could hear church bells ringing in the city. Within 90 days, however, Robert E. Lee had driven McClellan from the Peninsula, [[John Pope (military officer)|Pope]] had been soundly beaten at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], and the battle lines were {{convert|20|mi|km}} from the Union capital in Washington. It would take almost two more years before the Union Army again got that close to Richmond, and almost three years before it finally captured it.\n\nAdditionally, the battle is notable for being where [[Henry Wirz]] lost the use of his right arm, after being shot by a [[Minie ball]] while fighting as a [[Private (rank)|private]] of the Confederate army. He was taken out of combat duty, eventually becoming the [[commandant]] of [[Camp Sumter]], a Confederate [[prisoner-of-war]] camp notorious for its terrible conditions where nearly 13,000 Union detainees died. The camp became one of the best known horrors of the Civil War, and Wirz was later one of only two men tried and executed for [[war crimes]] during the war.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|American Civil War}}\n* [[Troop engagements of the American Civil War, 1862]]\n* [[Peninsula Campaign]] and [[Siege of Yorktown (1862)]]\n* [[List of costliest American Civil War land battles]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n<ref name=cwsac>[http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/CWSII/VirginiaBattlefieldProfiles/Sappony%20Church%20to%20Spotsylvania%20Court%20House.pdf CWSAC Report Update]</ref>\n}}\n\n==References==\n* Downs, Alan C. \"Fair Oaks/Seven Pines.\" In ''Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History'', edited by David S.

Reykjavik and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is [[high island|volcanically]] and [[Geothermal gradient#Heat flow|geologically active]]. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and [[lava field]]s, [[mountain]]s, and [[glacier]]s, and many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the [[Gulf Stream]] and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the [[Arctic Circle]]. Its high latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly, with most of the [[archipelago]] having a [[polar climate]].\n\nAccording to the ancient manuscript ''[[Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k]]'', the [[settlement of Iceland]] began in 874 AD when the [[Norway|Norwegian]] chieftain [[Ing\u00f3lfr Arnarson]] became the first permanent settler on the island.<ref name = tomasson/> In the following centuries, [[Norwegians]], and to a lesser extent other [[Scandinavia]]ns, emigrated to Iceland, bringing with them [[thrall]]s (i.e., slaves or serfs) of [[Gaels|Gaelic]] origin.\n\nThe island was governed as an [[Icelandic Commonwealth|independent commonwealth]] under the [[Althing]], one of the world's oldest functioning legislative assemblies. Following a [[Age of Sturlungs|period of civil strife]], Iceland acceded to Norwegian rule in the 13th century. The establishment of the [[Kalmar Union]] in 1397 united the kingdoms of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. Iceland thus followed Norway's integration into that union, coming under Danish rule after Sweden's secession from the union in 1523. Although the Danish kingdom introduced [[Lutheranism]] forcefully in 1550, Iceland remained a distant semi-colonial territory in which Danish institutions and infrastructures were conspicuous by their absence.\n\nIn the wake of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Iceland's struggle for independence took form and culminated in [[Danish\u2013Icelandic Act of Union|independence in 1918]] and the founding of a [[Founding of the Republic of Iceland|republic in 1944]].  Although its parliament (Althing) was suspended from 1799 to 1845, the island republic has been credited with sustaining the world's oldest and longest-running parliament.\n\nUntil the 20th century, Iceland relied largely on subsistence fishing and agriculture. Industrialisation of the fisheries and [[Marshall Plan]] aid following [[World War II]] brought prosperity and Iceland became one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world. In 1994, it became a part of the [[European Economic Area]], which further diversified the economy into sectors such as finance, biotechnology, and manufacturing.\n\nIceland has a [[market economy]] with relatively low taxes, compared to other [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/60/0,2340,en_2649_34533_1942460_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=OECD Tax Database |website=Oecd.org |accessdate=26 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125144548/http://www.oecd.org/document/60/0%2C2340%2Cen_2649_34533_1942460_1_1_1_1%2C00.html |archivedate=25 January 2010  }}</ref> as well as the [[Trade_union#Prevalence_worldwide|highest trade union membership in the world]].<ref name=\"ILO Density\">{{cite web |title=Industrial relations |url=http://www.ilo.org/ilostat/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pagehierarchy/Page3.jspx?MBI_ID=9 |publisher=ILOSTAT |accessdate=9 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190813123619/http://www.ilo.org/ilostat/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pagehierarchy/Page3.jspx%3FMBI_ID%3D9 |archive-date=13 August 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It maintains a [[Nordic model|Nordic social welfare system]] that provides [[universal health care]] and [[tertiary education]] for its citizens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.borg.hi.is/ChildWelfare |title=The Icelandic Welfare State and the Conditions of Children |last=\u00d3lafsson |first=Stef\u00e1n |date=12 May 2004 |website=borg.hi.is |accessdate=22 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050818131819/http://www.borg.hi.is/ChildWelfare |archivedate=18 August 2005 }}</ref> Iceland ranks high in economic, [[Democracy Index#Democracy Index by country (2017)|democratic]], social stability, and [[List of countries by inequality-adjusted HDI|equality]], currently ranking third in the world by [[List of countries by wealth per adult#List of countries by median and mean wealth per adult (USD)|median wealth per adult]].

J\u00f3hannesson]].\n\nThe cabinet is appointed by the president after a general election to the Althing; however, the appointment is usually negotiated by the leaders of the political parties, who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how to distribute its seats, under the condition that it has a majority support in the Althing. Only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves within a reasonable time span does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet personally. This has not happened since the republic was founded in 1944, but in 1942 regent [[Sveinn Bj\u00f6rnsson]], who had been installed in that position by the Althing in 1941, appointed a non-parliamentary government. The regent had, for all practical purposes, the position of a president, and Sveinn would later become the country's first president in 1944.\n\nThe governments of Iceland have always been coalition governments, with two or more parties involved, as no single political party has ever received a majority of seats in the Althing throughout the republican period. The extent of the political power possessed by the office of the president is disputed by legal scholars{{which|date=June 2016}}, in Iceland; several provisions of the constitution appear to give the president some important powers, but other provisions and traditions suggest differently.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} In 1980, Icelanders elected [[Vigd\u00eds Finnbogad\u00f3ttir]] as president, the world's first directly elected female head of state.

In recent times, Iceland has produced many great writers, the best-known of whom is arguably [[Halld\u00f3r Laxness]], who received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1955 (the only Icelander to win a Nobel Prize thus far). [[Steinn Steinarr]] was an influential modernist poet during the early 20th century who remains popular.\n\nIcelanders are avid consumers of literature, with the highest number of bookstores per capita in the world. For its size, Iceland imports and translates more international literature than any other nation.<ref name = \"autogenerated60\"/> Iceland also has the highest per capita publication of books and magazines,<ref>{{cite web|url = https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3396.htm|title = Cultural Achievements|publisher = State.gov|date = 15 June 2012|accessdate = 12 October 2012}}</ref> and around 10% of the population will publish a book in their lifetimes.<ref>[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 61.</ref>\n\nMost books in Iceland are sold between late September to early November.

Several other Icelandic men and women artists studied at [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] at that time, including [[\u00c1sgr\u00edmur J\u00f3nsson]], who together with \u00de\u00f3rarinn created a distinctive portrayal of Iceland's landscape in a romantic naturalistic style. Other landscape artists quickly followed in the footsteps of \u00de\u00f3rarinn and \u00c1sgr\u00edmur. These included [[J\u00f3hannes Sveinsson Kjarval|J\u00f3hannes Kjarval]] and [[J\u00fal\u00edana Sveinsd\u00f3ttir]]. Kjarval in particular is noted for the distinct techniques in the application of paint that he developed in a concerted effort to render the characteristic [[volcanic rock]] that dominates the Icelandic environment. [[Einar H\u00e1konarson]] is an expressionistic and figurative painter who by some is considered to have brought the figure back into Icelandic painting. In the 1980s, many Icelandic artists worked with the subject of the new painting in their work.\n\nIn the recent years artistic practice has multiplied, and the Icelandic art scene has become a setting for many large scale projects and exhibitions. The artist run gallery space Kling og Bang, members of which later ran the studio complex and exhibition venue Klink og Bank, has been a significant part of the trend of self-organised spaces, exhibitions and projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://this.is/klingogbang/text.php?lang=en&|title=Kling & Bang Gallery, This.is|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> [[The Living Art Museum]], Reykjav\u00edk Municipal Art Museum, [[Reykjav\u00edk Art Museum]] and the [[National Gallery of Iceland]] are the larger, more established institutions, curating shows and festivals.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"center\">\nThorarinn thingvellir.jpg|''[[\u00deingvellir]]'' by [[\u00de\u00f3rarinn B. \u00deorl\u00e1ksson]]\nThorfinn Karlsefni 1918.jpg|Statue of [[Thorfinn Karlsefni]] by Icelandic sculptor [[Einar J\u00f3nsson]] in [[Philadelphia]]\nLaxness portrett einar hakonarson 1984.jpg|The writer [[Halld\u00f3r Laxness]] by [[Einar H\u00e1konarson]], 1984\nGrassodenh\u00e4user.jpg|Traditional [[Icelandic turf house]]s.

Notable Icelandic music acts include medieval music group [[Voces Thules]], alternative and indie rock acts such as [[The Sugarcubes]], [[S\u00f3ley]] and [[Of Monsters and Men]], jazz fusion band [[Mezzoforte (band)|Mezzoforte]], pop singers such as [[Hafd\u00eds Huld]], [[Emil\u00edana Torrini]] and [[Bj\u00f6rk]], solo ballad singers like [[Bubbi Morthens]], and [[post-rock]] bands such as [[Amiina]] and [[Sigur R\u00f3s]]. [[Independent music]] is strong in Iceland, with bands such as [[m\u00fam]] and solo artists.\n\nTraditional Icelandic music is strongly religious. Hymns, both religious and secular, are a particularly well-developed form of music, due to the scarcity of musical instruments throughout much of Iceland's history. Hallgr\u00edmur P\u00e9tursson wrote many Protestant hymns in the 17th century. Icelandic music was modernised in the 19th century, when Magn\u00fas Stephensen brought pipe organs, which were followed by [[Pump organ|harmoniums]]. Other vital traditions of Icelandic music are epic alliterative and rhyming ballads called r\u00edmur. R\u00edmur are epic tales, usually [[a cappella]], which can be traced back to [[skald]]ic poetry, using complex metaphors and elaborate rhyme schemes.<ref>Cronshaw, Andrew. (1999) \"Iceland\". In ''World Music: The Rough Guide''. London: Rough Guides Ltd. pp.&nbsp;168\u201369.</ref> The best known r\u00edmur poet of the 19th century was [[Sigur\u00f0ur Brei\u00f0fj\u00f6r\u00f0]] (1798\u20131846). A modern revitalisation of the tradition began in 1929 with the formation of I\u00f0unn.{{Clarify|reason = What is I\u00f0unn?

Seafood is central to most Icelandic cooking, particularly [[cod]] and [[haddock]] but also [[salmon]], [[herring]], and [[halibut]]. It is often prepared in a wide variety of ways, either smoked, pickled, boiled, or dried. Lamb is by far the most common meat, and it tends to be either smoke-cured (known as ''[[hangikj\u00f6t]]'') or salt-preserved (''saltkj\u00f6t''). Many older dishes make use of every part of the sheep, such as ''[[sl\u00e1tur]]'', which consists of [[offal]] (internal organs and entrails) minced together with blood and served in sheep stomach.

Reykjavik and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is [[high island|volcanically]] and [[Geothermal gradient#Heat flow|geologically active]]. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and [[lava field]]s, [[mountain]]s, and [[glacier]]s, and many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the [[Gulf Stream]] and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the [[Arctic Circle]]. Its high latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly, with most of the [[archipelago]] having a [[polar climate]].\n\nAccording to the ancient manuscript ''[[Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k]]'', the [[settlement of Iceland]] began in 874 AD when the [[Norway|Norwegian]] chieftain [[Ing\u00f3lfr Arnarson]] became the first permanent settler on the island.<ref name = tomasson/> In the following centuries, [[Norwegians]], and to a lesser extent other [[Scandinavia]]ns, emigrated to Iceland, bringing with them [[thrall]]s (i.e., slaves or serfs) of [[Gaels|Gaelic]] origin.\n\nThe island was governed as an [[Icelandic Commonwealth|independent commonwealth]] under the [[Althing]], one of the world's oldest functioning legislative assemblies. Following a [[Age of Sturlungs|period of civil strife]], Iceland acceded to Norwegian rule in the 13th century. The establishment of the [[Kalmar Union]] in 1397 united the kingdoms of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. Iceland thus followed Norway's integration into that union, coming under Danish rule after Sweden's secession from the union in 1523. Although the Danish kingdom introduced [[Lutheranism]] forcefully in 1550, Iceland remained a distant semi-colonial territory in which Danish institutions and infrastructures were conspicuous by their absence.\n\nIn the wake of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Iceland's struggle for independence took form and culminated in [[Danish\u2013Icelandic Act of Union|independence in 1918]] and the founding of a [[Founding of the Republic of Iceland|republic in 1944]].  Although its parliament (Althing) was suspended from 1799 to 1845, the island republic has been credited with sustaining the world's oldest and longest-running parliament.\n\nUntil the 20th century, Iceland relied largely on subsistence fishing and agriculture. Industrialisation of the fisheries and [[Marshall Plan]] aid following [[World War II]] brought prosperity and Iceland became one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world. In 1994, it became a part of the [[European Economic Area]], which further diversified the economy into sectors such as finance, biotechnology, and manufacturing.\n\nIceland has a [[market economy]] with relatively low taxes, compared to other [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/60/0,2340,en_2649_34533_1942460_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=OECD Tax Database |website=Oecd.org |accessdate=26 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125144548/http://www.oecd.org/document/60/0%2C2340%2Cen_2649_34533_1942460_1_1_1_1%2C00.html |archivedate=25 January 2010  }}</ref> as well as the [[Trade_union#Prevalence_worldwide|highest trade union membership in the world]].<ref name=\"ILO Density\">{{cite web |title=Industrial relations |url=http://www.ilo.org/ilostat/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pagehierarchy/Page3.jspx?MBI_ID=9 |publisher=ILOSTAT |accessdate=9 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190813123619/http://www.ilo.org/ilostat/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pagehierarchy/Page3.jspx%3FMBI_ID%3D9 |archive-date=13 August 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It maintains a [[Nordic model|Nordic social welfare system]] that provides [[universal health care]] and [[tertiary education]] for its citizens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.borg.hi.is/ChildWelfare |title=The Icelandic Welfare State and the Conditions of Children |last=\u00d3lafsson |first=Stef\u00e1n |date=12 May 2004 |website=borg.hi.is |accessdate=22 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050818131819/http://www.borg.hi.is/ChildWelfare |archivedate=18 August 2005 }}</ref> Iceland ranks high in economic, [[Democracy Index#Democracy Index by country (2017)|democratic]], social stability, and [[List of countries by inequality-adjusted HDI|equality]], currently ranking third in the world by [[List of countries by wealth per adult#List of countries by median and mean wealth per adult (USD)|median wealth per adult]].

J\u00f3hannesson]].\n\nThe cabinet is appointed by the president after a general election to the Althing; however, the appointment is usually negotiated by the leaders of the political parties, who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how to distribute its seats, under the condition that it has a majority support in the Althing. Only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves within a reasonable time span does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet personally. This has not happened since the republic was founded in 1944, but in 1942 regent [[Sveinn Bj\u00f6rnsson]], who had been installed in that position by the Althing in 1941, appointed a non-parliamentary government. The regent had, for all practical purposes, the position of a president, and Sveinn would later become the country's first president in 1944.\n\nThe governments of Iceland have always been coalition governments, with two or more parties involved, as no single political party has ever received a majority of seats in the Althing throughout the republican period. The extent of the political power possessed by the office of the president is disputed by legal scholars{{which|date=June 2016}}, in Iceland; several provisions of the constitution appear to give the president some important powers, but other provisions and traditions suggest differently.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} In 1980, Icelanders elected [[Vigd\u00eds Finnbogad\u00f3ttir]] as president, the world's first directly elected female head of state.

In recent times, Iceland has produced many great writers, the best-known of whom is arguably [[Halld\u00f3r Laxness]], who received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1955 (the only Icelander to win a Nobel Prize thus far). [[Steinn Steinarr]] was an influential modernist poet during the early 20th century who remains popular.\n\nIcelanders are avid consumers of literature, with the highest number of bookstores per capita in the world. For its size, Iceland imports and translates more international literature than any other nation.<ref name = \"autogenerated60\"/> Iceland also has the highest per capita publication of books and magazines,<ref>{{cite web|url = https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3396.htm|title = Cultural Achievements|publisher = State.gov|date = 15 June 2012|accessdate = 12 October 2012}}</ref> and around 10% of the population will publish a book in their lifetimes.<ref>[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 61.</ref>\n\nMost books in Iceland are sold between late September to early November.

Several other Icelandic men and women artists studied at [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] at that time, including [[\u00c1sgr\u00edmur J\u00f3nsson]], who together with \u00de\u00f3rarinn created a distinctive portrayal of Iceland's landscape in a romantic naturalistic style. Other landscape artists quickly followed in the footsteps of \u00de\u00f3rarinn and \u00c1sgr\u00edmur. These included [[J\u00f3hannes Sveinsson Kjarval|J\u00f3hannes Kjarval]] and [[J\u00fal\u00edana Sveinsd\u00f3ttir]]. Kjarval in particular is noted for the distinct techniques in the application of paint that he developed in a concerted effort to render the characteristic [[volcanic rock]] that dominates the Icelandic environment. [[Einar H\u00e1konarson]] is an expressionistic and figurative painter who by some is considered to have brought the figure back into Icelandic painting. In the 1980s, many Icelandic artists worked with the subject of the new painting in their work.\n\nIn the recent years artistic practice has multiplied, and the Icelandic art scene has become a setting for many large scale projects and exhibitions. The artist run gallery space Kling og Bang, members of which later ran the studio complex and exhibition venue Klink og Bank, has been a significant part of the trend of self-organised spaces, exhibitions and projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://this.is/klingogbang/text.php?lang=en&|title=Kling & Bang Gallery, This.is|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> [[The Living Art Museum]], Reykjav\u00edk Municipal Art Museum, [[Reykjav\u00edk Art Museum]] and the [[National Gallery of Iceland]] are the larger, more established institutions, curating shows and festivals.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"center\">\nThorarinn thingvellir.jpg|''[[\u00deingvellir]]'' by [[\u00de\u00f3rarinn B. \u00deorl\u00e1ksson]]\nThorfinn Karlsefni 1918.jpg|Statue of [[Thorfinn Karlsefni]] by Icelandic sculptor [[Einar J\u00f3nsson]] in [[Philadelphia]]\nLaxness portrett einar hakonarson 1984.jpg|The writer [[Halld\u00f3r Laxness]] by [[Einar H\u00e1konarson]], 1984\nGrassodenh\u00e4user.jpg|Traditional [[Icelandic turf house]]s.

Notable Icelandic music acts include medieval music group [[Voces Thules]], alternative and indie rock acts such as [[The Sugarcubes]], [[S\u00f3ley]] and [[Of Monsters and Men]], jazz fusion band [[Mezzoforte (band)|Mezzoforte]], pop singers such as [[Hafd\u00eds Huld]], [[Emil\u00edana Torrini]] and [[Bj\u00f6rk]], solo ballad singers like [[Bubbi Morthens]], and [[post-rock]] bands such as [[Amiina]] and [[Sigur R\u00f3s]]. [[Independent music]] is strong in Iceland, with bands such as [[m\u00fam]] and solo artists.\n\nTraditional Icelandic music is strongly religious. Hymns, both religious and secular, are a particularly well-developed form of music, due to the scarcity of musical instruments throughout much of Iceland's history. Hallgr\u00edmur P\u00e9tursson wrote many Protestant hymns in the 17th century. Icelandic music was modernised in the 19th century, when Magn\u00fas Stephensen brought pipe organs, which were followed by [[Pump organ|harmoniums]]. Other vital traditions of Icelandic music are epic alliterative and rhyming ballads called r\u00edmur. R\u00edmur are epic tales, usually [[a cappella]], which can be traced back to [[skald]]ic poetry, using complex metaphors and elaborate rhyme schemes.<ref>Cronshaw, Andrew. (1999) \"Iceland\". In ''World Music: The Rough Guide''. London: Rough Guides Ltd. pp.&nbsp;168\u201369.</ref> The best known r\u00edmur poet of the 19th century was [[Sigur\u00f0ur Brei\u00f0fj\u00f6r\u00f0]] (1798\u20131846). A modern revitalisation of the tradition began in 1929 with the formation of I\u00f0unn.{{Clarify|reason = What is I\u00f0unn?

Seafood is central to most Icelandic cooking, particularly [[cod]] and [[haddock]] but also [[salmon]], [[herring]], and [[halibut]]. It is often prepared in a wide variety of ways, either smoked, pickled, boiled, or dried. Lamb is by far the most common meat, and it tends to be either smoke-cured (known as ''[[hangikj\u00f6t]]'') or salt-preserved (''saltkj\u00f6t''). Many older dishes make use of every part of the sheep, such as ''[[sl\u00e1tur]]'', which consists of [[offal]] (internal organs and entrails) minced together with blood and served in sheep stomach.

In 743, the brothers placed [[Childeric III]] on the throne to curb separatism in the periphery. He was the last Merovingian king. Carloman resigned office in 746, preferring to enter the church as a monk. Pepin brought the question of the kingship before [[Pope Zachary]], asking whether it was logical for a king to have no royal power. The pope handed down his decision in 749, decreeing that it was better for Pepin to be called king, as he had the powers of high office as Mayor, so as not to confuse the hierarchy. He, therefore, ordered him to become the ''true king''.<ref name=\"France/Pippin\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/40284/Pippin-III |title=France :: Pippin III \u2013 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=24 April 2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 750, Pepin was elected by an assembly of the Franks, anointed by the archbishop, and then raised to the office of king. The Pope branded Childeric III as \"the false king\" and ordered him into a monastery. The Merovingian dynasty was thereby replaced by the [[Carolingian]] dynasty, named after Charles Martel. In 753, [[Pope Stephen II]] fled from Italy to Francia, appealing to Pepin for assistance for the rights of St. Peter. He was supported in this appeal by Carloman, Charles' brother<!---should this be Pepin's brother?- Apparently not; Pepin's brother only left the monastery (Monte Cassino), to plead that Pepin NOT provide aid to Stephen II, and was then imprisoned. Carloman, son of Pepin and brother to Charles, supported Stephen II, and was named along with his father and brother as kings.-->. In return, the pope could provide only legitimacy. He did this by again anointing and confirming Pepin, this time adding his young sons Carolus (Charlemagne) and Carloman to the royal patrimony. They thereby became heirs to the realm that already covered most of western Europe. In 754, Pepin accepted the Pope's invitation to visit Italy on behalf of St. Peter's rights, dealing successfully with the [[Lombards]].<ref name=\"France/Pippin\" /><ref>The background relies heavily on {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Years 745\u2013755}}</ref>\n\nUnder the Carolingians, the Frankish kingdom spread to encompass an area including most of Western Europe; the east-west division of the kingdom formed the basis for modern [[History of France|France]] and [[History of Germany|Germany]].

Plan of This Work}}}}\n\n===Ambiguous high office===\n{{further|Mayor of the Palace}}\n\nThe most powerful officers of the Frankish people, the Mayor of the Palace (''Maior Domus'') and one or more kings (''rex'', ''reges''), were appointed by the election of the people. Elections were not periodic, but were held as required to elect officers ''ad quos summa imperii pertinebat'', \"to whom the highest matters of state pertained\". Evidently, interim decisions could be made by the Pope, which ultimately needed to be ratified using an assembly of the people that met annually.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=1. The Merovingian Family}}\n\nBefore he was elected king in 751, Pepin was initially a mayor, a high office he held \"as though hereditary\" (''velut hereditario fungebatur''). Einhard explains that \"the honour\" was usually \"given by the people\" to the distinguished, but Pepin the Great and his brother Carloman the Wise received it as though hereditary, as had their father, [[Charles Martel]]. There was, however, a certain ambiguity about quasi-inheritance. The office was treated as joint property: one Mayorship held by two brothers jointly.<ref>The ''Annales'' uses maiores domus, a plural followed by a singular: one house, two chief officers. {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 742}}</ref> Each, however, had his own geographic jurisdiction. When Carloman decided to resign, becoming ultimately a Benedictine at [[Monte Cassino]],{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Years 745, 746}} the question of the disposition of his quasi-share was settled by the pope. He converted the mayorship into a kingship and awarded the joint property to Pepin, who gained the right to pass it on by inheritance.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=6. Lombard War}}\n\nThis decision was not accepted by all family members. Carloman had consented to the temporary tenancy of his own share, which he intended to pass on to his son, Drogo, when the inheritance should be settled at someone's death. By the Pope's decision, in which Pepin had a hand, Drogo was to be disqualified as an heir in favour of his cousin Charles. He took up arms in opposition to the decision and was joined by [[Grifo]], a half-brother of Pepin and Carloman, who had been given a share by Charles Martel, but was stripped of it and held under loose arrest by his half-brothers after an attempt to seize their shares by military action. Grifo perished in combat in the Battle of [[Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne]] while Drogo was hunted down and taken into custody.{{sfn|Collins|1998|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nOn the death of Pepin, 24 September 768, the kingship passed jointly to his sons, \"with divine assent\" (''divino nutu'').{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=3. Charlemagne's Accession}} According to the ''Life'', Pepin died in Paris. The Franks \"in general assembly\" (''generali conventu'') gave them both the rank of a king (''reges'') but \"partitioned the whole body of the kingdom equally\" (''totum regni corpus ex aequo partirentur''). The ''annals''{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 768}} tell a slightly different version, with the king dying at [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|St-Denis]], near Paris. The two \"lords\" (''domni'') were \"elevated to kingship\" (''elevati sunt in regnum''), Charles on 9 October in [[Noyon]], Carloman on an unspecified date in [[Soissons]]. If born in 742, Charles was 26 years old, but he had been campaigning at his father's right hand for several years, which may help to account for his military skill. [[Carloman I|Carloman]] was 17.\n\nThe language, in either case, suggests that there were not two inheritances, which would have created distinct kings ruling over distinct kingdoms, but a single joint inheritance and a joint kingship tenanted by two equal kings, Charles and his brother Carloman. As before, distinct jurisdictions were awarded. Charles received Pepin's original share as Mayor: the outer parts of the kingdom bordering on the sea, namely [[Neustria]], western [[Aquitaine]], and the northern parts of [[Austrasia]]; while Carloman was awarded his uncle's former share, the inner parts: southern Austrasia, [[Septimania]], eastern Aquitaine, [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], Provence, and [[Swabia]], lands bordering [[Italy]]. The question of whether these jurisdictions were joint shares reverting to the other brother if one brother died or were inherited property passed on to the descendants of the brother who died was never definitely settled. It came up repeatedly over the succeeding decades until the grandsons of Charlemagne created distinct sovereign kingdoms.\n\n===Aquitainian rebellion===\n====Formation of a new Aquitaine====\n{{main|Aquitaine}}\n\n[[Aquitaine]] under Rome had been in southern [[Gaul]], Romanised and speaking a [[Romance language]]. Similarly, [[Hispania]] had been populated by peoples who spoke various languages, including [[Celtic language|Celtic]], but the area was now populated primarily by Romance language speakers. Between Aquitaine and Hispania were the [[Basques|Euskaldunak]], Latinised to [[Vascones]], or [[Basques]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=32}} living in Basque country, Vasconia, which extended, according to the distributions of place names attributable to the Basques, most densely in the western [[Pyrenees]] but also as far south as the upper [[Ebro River]] in Spain and as far north as the [[Garonne River]] in France.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=105}} The French name, [[Gascony]], derives from [[Vasconia]]. The Romans were never able to entirely subject Vasconia. The parts they did, in which they placed the region's first cities, were sources of legions in the Roman army valued for their fighting abilities. The border with Aquitaine was [[Toulouse]].\n\nAt about 660, the [[Duchy of Vasconia]] united with the [[Duke of Aquitaine|Duchy of Aquitaine]] to form a single realm under [[Felix of Aquitaine]], governing from Toulouse. This was a joint kingship with a Basque Duke, [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus I]]. ''Lupus'' is the Latin translation of Basque Otsoa, \"wolf\".{{sfn|Douglass|Bilbao|2005|pp=36\u201337}} At Felix's death in 670 the joint property of the kingship reverted entirely to Lupus. As the Basques had no law of joint inheritance but practised [[primogeniture]], [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus]] in effect founded a hereditary dynasty of Basque rulers of an expanded Aquitaine.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=100}}\n\n====Acquisition of Aquitaine by the Carolingians====\n{{further|Umayyad conquest of Hispania}}\n[[File:Al-Andalus732.jpg|thumb|Moorish Hispania in 732]]\n\nThe Latin chronicles of the end of [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Hispania]] omit many details, such as identification of characters, filling in the gaps and reconciliation of numerous contradictions.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|2004|pp=130\u201331}}, \"The sequence of events...has not been assisted by the tendency of the historians to take all the information...from all the available sources and combine it to produce a single synthetic account...As a rule of thumb, reliability, and also brevity of narrative, are usually in direct proportion to chronological proximity.\"</ref> Muslim sources, however, present a more coherent view, such as in the ''Ta'rikh iftitah al-Andalus'' (\"History of the Conquest of al-Andalus\") by [[Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya]] (\"the son of the Gothic woman\", referring to the granddaughter of [[Wittiza]], the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania, who married a Moor). Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya, who had another, much longer name, must have been relying to some degree on family oral tradition.\n\nAccording to Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya{{sfn|James|2009|p=49}} [[Wittiza]], the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania died before his three sons, Almund, Romulo, and Ardabast reached maturity. Their mother was [[queen regent]] at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], but [[Roderic]], army chief of staff, staged a rebellion, capturing [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He chose to impose a joint rule over distinct jurisdictions on the true heirs. Evidence of a division of some sort can be found in the distribution of coins imprinted with the name of each king and in the king lists.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=131\u201332}} Wittiza was succeeded by Roderic, who reigned for seven and a half years, followed by Achila (Aquila), who reigned three and a half years. If the reigns of both terminated with the incursion of the [[Saracens]], then Roderic appears to have reigned a few years before the majority of Achila. The latter's kingdom is securely placed to the northeast, while Roderic seems to have taken the rest, notably modern [[Portugal]].\n\nThe Saracens crossed the mountains to claim Ardo's [[Septimania]], only to encounter the Basque dynasty of Aquitaine, always the allies of the Goths. [[Odo the Great]] of [[Aquitaine]] was at first victorious at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]] in 721.{{sfn|Douglass|Bilbao|2005|p=40}} Saracen troops gradually massed in Septimania and in 732 an army under Emir [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]] advanced into Vasconia, and Odo was defeated at the [[Battle of the River Garonne]]. They took [[Bordeaux]] and were advancing towards [[Tours]] when Odo, powerless to stop them, appealed to his arch-enemy, [[Charles Martel]], mayor of the Franks. In one of the first of the lightning marches for which the Carolingian kings became famous, Charles and his army appeared in the path of the Saracens between Tours and [[Poitiers]], and in the [[Battle of Tours]] decisively defeated and killed al-Ghafiqi. The Moors returned twice more, each time suffering defeat at Charles' hands\u2014at the River Berre near Narbonne in 737{{sfn|Einhard|2007|p=24}} and in the [[Dauphin\u00e9]] in 740.<ref name=\"Lewis2009\">{{cite book|first=David Levering |last=Lewis|title=God's Crucible: Islam and the Making of Europe, 570\u20131215|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=NwA7mQEACAAJ|page=177}}|date=2009|publisher=W.W.

However, Odo had ambiguously left the kingdom jointly to his two sons, Hunald and Hatto. The latter, loyal to Francia, now went to war with his brother over full possession. Victorious, Hunald blinded and imprisoned his brother, only to be so stricken by conscience that he resigned and entered the church as a monk to do penance. The story is told in [[Annales Mettenses priores]].<ref name=\"Freeman1904\">{{cite book|first=Edward Augustus |last=Freeman|title=Western Europe in the Eighth Century & Onward: An Aftermath|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5HCIvgAACAAJ|page=74}}|year=1904|publisher=Macmillan and Company, limited| page=74}}</ref> His son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] took an early inheritance, becoming duke of Aquitaine and ratified the alliance with Lombardy. Waifer decided to honour it, repeating his father's decision, which he justified by arguing that any agreements with Charles Martel became invalid on Martel's death. Since [[Aquitaine]] was now Pepin's inheritance because of the earlier assistance that was given by Charles Martel, according to some the latter and his son, the young Charles, hunted down Waifer, who could only conduct a guerrilla war, and executed him.{{sfn|Russell|1930|p=88}}\n\nAmong the contingents of the Frankish army were [[Bavaria]]ns under [[Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria]], an [[Agilofing]], the hereditary Bavarian ducal family. [[Grifo]] had installed himself as Duke of Bavaria, but Pepin replaced him with a member of the ducal family yet a child, Tassilo, whose protector he had become after the death of his father. The loyalty of the Agilolfings was perpetually in question, but Pepin exacted numerous oaths of loyalty from Tassilo. However, the latter had married [[Liutperga]], a daughter of [[Desiderius]], king of [[Lombardy]]. At a critical point in the campaign, Tassilo left the field with all his Bavarians. Out of reach of Pepin, he repudiated all loyalty to Francia.{{sfn|McKitterick|2008|pp=118\u201325}} Pepin had no chance to respond as he grew ill and died within a few weeks after Waifer's execution.\n\nThe first event of the brothers' reign was the uprising of the Aquitainians and [[Gascony|Gascons]], in 769, in that territory split between the two kings. One year earlier, Pepin had finally defeated [[Waifer of Aquitaine|Waifer]], [[Duke of Aquitaine]], after waging a destructive, ten-year war against Aquitaine. Now, [[Hunald II]] led the Aquitainians as far north as [[Angoul\u00eame]]. Charles met Carloman, but Carloman refused to participate and returned to Burgundy. Charles went to war, leading an army to [[Bordeaux]], where he set up a fort at Fronsac. Hunald was forced to flee to the court of Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupus&nbsp;II of Gascony]]. Lupus, fearing Charles, turned Hunald over in exchange for peace, and Hunald was put in a monastery. Gascon lords also surrendered, and Aquitaine and [[Duchy of Vasconia|Gascony]] were finally fully subdued by the Franks.\n\n===Marriage to Desiderata===\nThe brothers maintained lukewarm relations with the assistance of their mother Bertrada, but in 770 Charles signed a treaty with Duke [[Tassilo III of Bavaria]] and married a Lombard Princess (commonly known today as [[Desiderata, wife of Charlemagne|Desiderata]]), the daughter of King [[Desiderius]], to surround Carloman with his own allies. Though [[Pope Stephen III]] first opposed the marriage with the Lombard princess, he found little to fear from a Frankish-Lombard alliance.\n\nLess than a year after his marriage, Charlemagne repudiated Desiderata and married a 13-year-old Swabian named [[Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne|Hildegard]]. The repudiated Desiderata returned to her father's court at [[Pavia]]. Her father's wrath was now aroused, and he would have gladly allied with Carloman to defeat Charles. Before any open hostilities could be declared, however, Carloman died on 5 December 771, apparently of natural causes. Carloman's widow [[Gerberge, wife of Carloman|Gerberga]] fled to Desiderius' court with her sons for protection.\n\n==Italian campaigns==\n\n===Conquest of the Lombard kingdom===\n[[File:Charlemagne and Pope Adrian I.jpg|thumb|The Frankish king Charlemagne was a devout Catholic and maintained a close relationship with the papacy throughout his life.

Instead, Desiderius took over certain papal cities and invaded the [[Pentapolis]], heading for Rome. Adrian sent ambassadors to Charlemagne in autumn requesting he enforce the policies of his father, Pepin. Desiderius sent his own ambassadors denying the pope's charges. The ambassadors met at [[Thionville]], and Charlemagne upheld the pope's side. Charlemagne demanded what the pope had requested, but Desiderius swore never to comply. Charlemagne and his uncle [[Bernhard, son of Charles Martel|Bernard]] crossed the Alps in 773 and chased the Lombards back to [[Siege of Pavia (773\u201374)|Pavia, which they then besieged]].<ref name=\"Kohn2006\">{{cite book|first=George C. |last=Kohn|title=Dictionary of Wars|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=OIzreCGlHxIC&|page=125}}|year=2006|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-2916-7|pages=125\u2013}}</ref> Charlemagne temporarily left the siege to deal with [[Adelchis]], son of Desiderius, who was raising an army at [[Verona]].

There he confirmed [[Donation of Pepin|his father's grants of land]],<ref name=Campaigns>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/106546/Charlemagne/256620/Military-campaigns Charlemagne], Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica</ref> with some later chronicles falsely claiming that he also expanded them, granting [[Tuscany]], [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], Venice and [[Corsica]]. The pope granted him the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]''. He then returned to Pavia, where the Lombards were on the verge of surrendering. In return for their lives, the Lombards surrendered and opened the gates in early summer. Desiderius was sent to the [[abbey]] of [[Corbie]], and his son Adelchis died in [[Constantinople]], a patrician. Charles, unusually, had himself crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] and made the magnates of Lombardy pay homage to him at Pavia. Only Duke [[Arechis II of Benevento]] refused to submit and proclaimed independence. Charlemagne was then master of Italy as king of the Lombards. He left Italy with a garrison in Pavia and a few Frankish counts in place the same year.\n\nInstability continued in Italy. In 776, Dukes [[Hrodgaud of Friuli]] and [[Hildeprand of Spoleto]] rebelled. Charlemagne rushed back from [[Saxony]] and defeated the Duke of Friuli in battle; the Duke was slain.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=6. Lombard War}} The Duke of Spoleto signed a treaty. Their co-conspirator, Arechis, was not subdued, and Adelchis, their candidate in [[Byzantium]], never left that city. Northern Italy was now faithfully his.\n\n===Southern Italy===\nIn 787, Charlemagne directed his attention towards the [[Duchy of Benevento]],{{sfn|Hodgkin|1889}} where [[Arechis II of Benevento|Arechis II]] was reigning independently with the self-given title of [[Princeps]]. Charlemagne's siege of [[Salerno]] forced Arechis into submission. However, after Arechis II's death in 787, his son [[Grimoald III of Benevento|Grimoald III]] proclaimed the Duchy of Benevento newly independent. Grimoald was attacked many times by Charles' or his sons' armies, without achieving a definitive victory.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1889|pp=85\u201386}} Charlemagne lost interest and never again returned to [[Southern Italy]] where Grimoald was able to keep the Duchy free from Frankish [[suzerainty]].\n\n==Children==\n[[File:Karl der Grosse - Pippin der Bucklige.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Charlemagne (left) and [[Pepin the Hunchback]] (10th-century copy of 9th-century original)]]\n\nDuring the first peace of any substantial length (780\u2013782), Charles began to appoint his sons to positions of authority. In 781, during a visit to Rome, he made his two youngest sons kings, crowned by the Pope.{{efn|From 781 Adrian began dating papal documents by the years of Charlemagne's reign, instead of the reign of the [[Byzantine Emperor]].<ref>Asimov, I.

Lombard War}}<ref name=Campaigns /> (not to be confused with Charlemagne's eldest, possibly illegitimate son, [[Pepin the Hunchback]]). The younger of the two, [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], became [[King of Aquitaine]]. Charlemagne ordered Pepin and Louis to be raised in the customs of their kingdoms, and he gave their regents some control of their subkingdoms, but kept the real power, though he intended his sons to inherit their realms. He did not tolerate insubordination in his sons: in 792, he banished Pepin the Hunchback to [[Pr\u00fcm Abbey]] because the young man had joined a rebellion against him.\n\nCharles was determined to have his children educated, including his daughters, as his parents had instilled the importance of learning in him at an early age.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hbnY8GTet_kC}}|title=Charlemagne |last=Gelfand|first=Dale Evva|date=2003|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1438117850|language=en}}</ref> His children were also taught skills in accord with their aristocratic status, which included training in riding and weaponry for his sons, and embroidery, spinning and weaving for his daughters.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=bQlJP9O9hKkC}}|title=Daily Life in the Age of Charlemagne|last=Butt|first=John J.|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313316685|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe sons fought many wars on behalf of their father. [[Charles the Younger|Charles]] was mostly preoccupied with the Bretons, whose border he shared and who insurrected on at least two occasions and were easily put down. He also fought the Saxons on multiple occasions. In 805 and 806, he was sent into the B\u00f6hmerwald (modern [[Bohemia]]) to deal with the Slavs living there (Bohemian tribes, ancestors of the modern [[Czech people|Czechs]]). He subjected them to Frankish authority and devastated the valley of the Elbe, forcing tribute from them. Pippin had to hold the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar]] and Beneventan borders and fought the [[Slavs]] to his north. He was uniquely poised to fight the [[Byzantine Empire]] when that conflict arose after Charlemagne's imperial coronation and a [[Venetia (region)|Venetian]] rebellion. Finally, Louis was in charge of the [[Spanish March]] and fought the Duke of Benevento in southern Italy on at least one occasion. He took [[Barcelona]] in a great siege in 797.\n\n[[File:Charlemagne et Louis le Pieux.jpg|thumb|Charlemagne instructing his son [[Louis the Pious]]]]\n\nCharlemagne kept his daughters at home with him and refused to allow them to contract [[marriage#Marriage and religion|sacramental marriages]] (though he originally condoned an engagement between his eldest daughter Rotrude and [[Constantine VI]] of Byzantium, this engagement was annulled when Rotrude was 11).<ref>Runciman, Steven. \"The Empress Irene the Athenian.\" Medieval Women.

However, he tolerated their extramarital relationships, even rewarding their common-law husbands and treasuring the illegitimate grandchildren they produced for him. He also, apparently, refused to believe stories of their wild behaviour. After his death the surviving daughters were banished from the court by their brother, the pious Louis, to take up residence in the convents they had been bequeathed by their father. At least one of them, Bertha, had a recognised relationship, if not a marriage, with [[Angilbert]], a member of Charlemagne's court circle.{{sfn|Becher|2005|p=122}}{{sfn|McKitterick|2008|p=91}}\n\n==Carolingian expansion to the south==\n{{See also|Abbasid\u2013Carolingian alliance}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Vasconia and the Pyrenees===\nThe destructive war led by Pepin in Aquitaine, although brought to a satisfactory conclusion for the Franks, proved the Frankish power structure south of the [[Loire]] was feeble and unreliable.

He took refuge with the ally Duke [[Lupus II of Gascony]], but probably out of fear of Charlemagne's reprisal, Lupus handed him over to the new King of the Franks to whom he pledged loyalty, which seemed to confirm the peace in [[Duchy of Vasconia|the Basque area]] south of the [[Garonne]].<ref name=Lewis>{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Archibald Ross |year=1965 |title=The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society 718\u20131050 |publisher=University of Texas Press |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nWary of new Basque uprisings, Charlemagne seems to have tried to contain Duke Lupus's power by appointing [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin]] as the Count of Bordeaux (778) and other counts of Frankish background in bordering areas ([[History of Toulouse#768\u2013877: Carolingian Franks and the Kingdom of Aquitaine|Toulouse]], [[County of F\u00e9zensac]]). The [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basque]] Duke, in turn, seems to have contributed decisively or schemed the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] (referred to as \"Basque treachery\"). The defeat of Charlemagne's army in Roncevaux (778) confirmed his determination to rule directly by establishing the Kingdom of Aquitaine (ruled by [[Louis the Pious]]) based on a power base of Frankish officials, distributing lands among colonisers and allocating lands to the Church, which he took as an ally. A Christianisation programme was put in place across the high [[Pyrenees]] (778).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\n[[File:771 CE, Europe.svg|thumb|Europe in 771]]\nThe new political arrangement for Vasconia did not sit well with local lords. As of 788 [[Adalric of Gascony|Adalric]] was fighting and capturing [[Torson of Toulouse|Chorson]], Carolingian Count of Toulouse. He was eventually released, but Charlemagne, enraged at the compromise, decided to depose him and appointed his trustee [[William of Gellone]]. William, in turn, fought the Basques and defeated them after banishing Adalric (790).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\nFrom 781 ([[County of Pallars|Pallars]], [[County of Ribagorza|Ribagor\u00e7a]]) to 806 ([[Pamplona#Early Middle Ages|Pamplona]] under Frankish influence), taking the County of Toulouse for a power base, Charlemagne asserted Frankish authority over the Pyrenees by subduing the south-western marches of Toulouse (790) and establishing vassal counties on the southern Pyrenees that were to make up the [[Marca Hispanica]].{{sfn|Lewis|1965|p=40}} As of 794, a Frankish vassal, the Basque lord Belasko (''al-Galashki'', 'the Gaul') ruled [[\u00c1lava]], but Pamplona remained under Cordovan and local control up to 806. Belasko and the counties in the Marca Hisp\u00e1nica provided the necessary base to attack the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusians]] (an expedition led by [[William of Gellone|William Count of Toulouse]] and Louis the Pious to capture Barcelona in 801). Events in the Duchy of Vasconia (rebellion in Pamplona, [[Aznar Gal\u00edndez I|count overthrown in Aragon]], Duke Seguin of Bordeaux deposed, uprising of the Basque lords, etc.) were to prove it ephemeral upon Charlemagne's death.\n\n===Roncesvalles campaign===\nAccording to the Muslim historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Diet]] of [[Paderborn]] had received the representatives of the Muslim rulers of [[Zaragoza]], [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Huesca]]. Their masters had been cornered in the [[Iberian peninsula]] by [[Abd ar-Rahman I]], the [[Umayyad]] [[emir of C\u00f3rdoba|emir of Cordova]]. These \"Saracen\" ([[Moorish]] and [[Muladi]]) rulers offered their homage to the king of the Franks in return for military support. Seeing an opportunity to extend [[Christendom]] and his own power and believing the Saxons to be a fully conquered nation, Charlemagne agreed to go to Spain.\n\nIn 778, he led the Neustrian army across the Western [[Pyrenees]], while the Austrasians, Lombards, and Burgundians passed over the Eastern Pyrenees. The armies met at Saragossa and Charlemagne received the homage of the Muslim rulers, Sulayman al-Arabi and Kasmin ibn Yusuf, but the city did not fall for him. Indeed, Charlemagne faced the toughest battle of his career. The Muslims forced him to retreat. He decided to go home since he could not trust the [[Basques]], whom he had subdued by conquering [[Pamplona]]. He turned to leave Iberia, but as he was passing through the Pass of [[Roncesvalles]] one of the most famous events of his reign occurred. The Basques attacked and destroyed his rearguard and baggage train. The [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]], though less a battle than a skirmish, left many famous dead, including the [[seneschal]] Eggihard, the count of the palace Anselm, and the [[wikt:warden|warden]] of the [[Breton March]], [[Roland]], inspiring the subsequent creation of the [[Song of Roland]] (''La Chanson de Roland'').\n\n===Contact with the Saracens===\n[[File:Harun-Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Harun al-Rashid]] receiving a delegation of Charlemagne in [[Baghdad]], by [[Julius K\u00f6ckert]] (1864)]]\n\nThe conquest of Italy brought Charlemagne in contact with the [[Saracen]]s who, at the time, controlled the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Charlemagne's eldest son, [[Pepin the Hunchback]], was much occupied with Saracens in Italy. Charlemagne conquered [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]] at an unknown date and in 799 the [[Balearic Islands]]. The islands were often attacked by Saracen pirates, but the counts of [[Genoa]] and Tuscany ([[Boniface I of Tuscany|Boniface]]) controlled them with large fleets until the end of Charlemagne's reign. Charlemagne even had contact with the [[caliph]]al court in [[Baghdad]]. In 797 (or possibly 801), the caliph of Baghdad, [[Harun al-Rashid]], presented Charlemagne with an [[Asian elephant]] named [[Abul-Abbas]] and a [[clock]].<ref name=\"Heck2007\">{{cite book|first=Gene W. |last=Heck|title=When Worlds Collide: Exploring the Ideological and Political Foundations of the Clash of Civilizations|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=dtAyMXqaozwC|page=172}}|year=2007|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-5856-4|pages=172\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Wars with the Moors===\n\nIn [[Hispania]], the struggle against the Moors continued unabated throughout the latter half of his reign. Louis was in charge of the Spanish border. In 785, his men captured Girona permanently and extended Frankish control into the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] littoral for the duration of Charlemagne's reign (the area remained nominally Frankish until the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]] in 1258). The Muslim chiefs in the northeast of [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] were constantly rebelling against Cordovan authority, and they often turned to the Franks for help. The Frankish border was slowly extended until 795, when Girona, [[Cardona, Spain|Cardona]], [[Ausona]] and [[County of Urgell|Urgell]] were united into the new [[Spanish March]], within the old duchy of [[Septimania]].\n\nIn 797, [[Barcelona]], the greatest city of the region, fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against Cordova and, failing, handed it to them. The [[Umayyad]] authority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis of Aquitaine marched the entire army of his kingdom over the [[Pyrenees]] and besieged it for two years, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated. The Franks continued to press forward against the [[emir]]. They took [[Tarragona]] in 809 and [[Tortosa]] in 811. The last conquest brought them to the mouth of the [[Ebro]] and gave them raiding access to [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], prompting the Emir [[al-Hakam I]] to recognise their conquests in 813.\n\n==Eastern campaigns==\n\n===Saxon Wars===\n{{Further|Saxon Wars}}\n[[File:Frankish Empire 481 to 814-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|A map showing Charlemagne's additions (in light green) to the Frankish Kingdom]]\n\nCharlemagne was engaged in almost constant warfare throughout his reign,<ref>France, John, \"The Composition and Raising of the Armies of Charlemagne\", in Journal of Medieval Military History, ed. B. Bachrach (2002), pp. 63\u201365</ref> often at the head of his elite ''[[scara]]'' bodyguard squadrons. In the [[Saxon Wars]], spanning thirty years and eighteen battles, he conquered [[Old Saxony|Saxonia]] and proceeded to convert it to Christianity.\n\nThe [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Saxons]] were divided into four subgroups in four regions. Nearest to [[Austrasia]] was [[Westphalia]] and furthest away was [[Eastphalia]]. Between them was [[Engria]] and north of these three, at the base of the [[Jutland]] peninsula, was [[Nordalbingia]].\n\nIn his first campaign, in 773, Charlemagne forced the Engrians to submit and cut down an [[Irminsul]] pillar near [[Paderborn]].<ref>Revised annals of the kingdom of the Franks, ed. and trans. King, Sources, p. 110</ref> The campaign was cut short by his first expedition to Italy. He returned in 775, marching through Westphalia and conquering the Saxon fort at [[Sigiburg]]. He then crossed Engria, where he defeated the Saxons again. Finally, in Eastphalia, he defeated a Saxon force, and its leader [[Hessi]] converted to Christianity. Charlemagne returned through Westphalia, leaving encampments at Sigiburg and [[Eresburg]], which had been important Saxon bastions. He then controlled Saxony with the exception of Nordalbingia, but Saxon resistance had not ended.\n\nFollowing his subjugation of the Dukes of Friuli and Spoleto, Charlemagne returned rapidly to Saxony in 776, where a rebellion had destroyed his fortress at Eresburg. The Saxons were once again defeated, but their main leader, [[Widukind]], escaped to Denmark, his wife's home. Charlemagne built a new camp at [[Karlstadt am Main|Karlstadt]]. In 777, he called a national diet at Paderborn to integrate Saxony fully into the Frankish kingdom. Many Saxons were baptised as Christians.\n\nIn the summer of 779, he again invaded Saxony and reconquered Eastphalia, Engria and Westphalia. At a diet near [[Lippe]], he divided the land into missionary districts and himself assisted in several mass baptisms (780). He then returned to Italy and, for the first time, the Saxons did not immediately revolt. Saxony was peaceful from 780 to 782.\n\n[[File:Ary Scheffer, Charlemagne re\u00e7oit la soumission de Widukind \u00e0 Paderborn, (1840).jpg|thumb|left|Charlemagne receiving the submission of [[Widukind]] at [[Paderborn]] in 785, painted c.&nbsp;1840 by [[Ary Scheffer]]]]\n\nHe returned to Saxony in 782 and instituted a code of law and appointed counts, both Saxon and Frank. The laws were draconian on religious issues; for example, the ''[[Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae]]'' prescribed death to Saxon pagans who refused to convert to Christianity. This led to renewed conflict. That year, in autumn, Widukind returned and led a new revolt. In response, at [[Verden, Germany|Verden]] in Lower Saxony, Charlemagne is recorded as having ordered the execution of 4,500 Saxon prisoners by beheading, known as the [[Massacre of Verden]] (\"Verdener Blutgericht\"). The killings triggered three years of renewed bloody warfare. During this war, the [[East Frisia]]ns between the [[Lauwers]] and the [[Weser]] joined the Saxons in revolt and were finally subdued.<ref>Oebele Vries, \"Friesland\", ''Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia'' (Routledge, 2001), pp. 252\u201356.</ref> The war ended with Widukind accepting baptism.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yW-GfElbafQC&pg=PA368|title=Encyclopedia of Barbarian Europe: Society in Transformation|first=Michael|last=Frassetto|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003 |isbn=9781576072639|chapter=Widukind|page=368}}</ref> The Frisians afterwards asked for missionaries to be sent to them and a bishop of their own nation, [[Ludger]], was sent.

Subsidia, '''13''', 1\u201315.</ref>\n\nThereafter, the Saxons maintained the peace for seven years, but in 792 Westphalia again rebelled. The Eastphalians and Nordalbingians joined them in 793, but the insurrection was unpopular and was put down by 794. An Engrian rebellion followed in 796, but the presence of Charlemagne, Christian Saxons and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] quickly crushed it. The last insurrection occurred in 804, more than thirty years after Charlemagne's first campaign against them, but also failed. According to Einhard:\n{{quote|\nThe war that had lasted so many years was at length ended by their acceding to the terms offered by the King; which were renunciation of their national religious customs and the worship of devils, acceptance of the sacraments of the Christian faith and religion, and union with the Franks to form one people.\n}}\n\n===Submission of Bavaria===\n[[File:Charlemagne Agostino Cornacchini Vatican 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Equestrian statue of Charlemagne (Cornacchini)|Equestrian statue of Charlemagne]]'' by [[Agostino Cornacchini]] (1725), [[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican City]].]]\n\nBy 774, Charlemagne had invaded the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Kingdom of Lombardy]], and he later annexed the Lombardian territories and assumed its crown, placing the [[Papal States]] under Frankish protection.<ref name=\"autogenerated30\">Historical Atlas of Knights and Castles, Cartographica, Dr Ian Barnes, 2007 pp.30&31</ref> The [[Duchy of Spoleto]] south of Rome was acquired in 774, while in the central western parts of Europe, the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] was absorbed and the Bavarian policy continued of establishing tributary [[marches]], (borders protected in return for tribute or taxes) among the [[Slavs|Slavic]] Serbs and Czechs.

Charlemagne was preoccupied with other matters until 790 when he marched down the [[Danube]] and ravaged Avar territory to the [[Gy\u0151r]]. A Lombard army under Pippin then marched into the [[Drava]] valley and ravaged [[Pannonia]]. The campaigns ended when the Saxons revolted again in 792.\n\nFor the next two years, Charlemagne was occupied, along with the Slavs, against the Saxons. Pippin and Duke [[Eric of Friuli]] continued, however, to assault the Avars' ring-shaped strongholds. The great Ring of the Avars, their capital fortress, was taken twice. The booty was sent to Charlemagne at his capital, [[Aachen]], and redistributed to his followers and to foreign rulers, including King [[Offa of Mercia]]. Soon the Avar [[tudun]]s had lost the will to fight and travelled to Aachen to become vassals to Charlemagne and to become Christians. Charlemagne accepted their surrender and sent one native chief, baptised Abraham, back to Avaria with the ancient title of [[khagan]]. Abraham kept his people in line, but in 800, the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] under [[Krum|Khan Krum]] attacked the remains of the Avar state.\n\nIn 803, Charlemagne sent a Bavarian army into [[Pannonia]], defeating and bringing an end to the [[Avar Khaganate|Avar confederation]].<ref name=\"Rogers\">{{cite book|first1=Bernard S. |last1=Bachrach|author2=Clifford J.

The Slavs ultimately submitted, led by their leader Witzin. Charlemagne then accepted the surrender of the [[Veleti]] under Dragovit and demanded many hostages. He also demanded permission to send missionaries into this pagan region unmolested. The army marched to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] before turning around and marching to the Rhine, winning much booty with no harassment. The tributary Slavs became loyal allies. In 795, when the Saxons broke the peace, the Abotrites and Veleti rebelled with their new ruler against the Saxons. Witzin died in battle and Charlemagne avenged him by harrying the Eastphalians on the Elbe. Thrasuco, his successor, led his men to conquest over the Nordalbingians and handed their leaders over to Charlemagne, who honoured him. The Abotrites remained loyal until Charles' death and fought later against the Danes.\n\n===Southeast Slav expeditions===\n[[File:Europe around 800.gif|thumb|Europe around 800]]\n\nWhen Charlemagne incorporated much of Central Europe, he brought the Frankish state face to face with the Avars and Slavs in the southeast.<ref name=\"Bruce Ross\">{{cite journal | last=Bruce Ross | first=James | pages=212\u201335 | jstor=2854596 | title=Two Neglected Paladins of Charlemagne: Erich of Friuli and Gerold of Bavaria Speculum, Vol. 20, No. 2 | journal=Speculum | volume=20 | issue=2 |date = April 1945| doi=10.2307/2854596 }}</ref> The most southeast Frankish neighbours were [[Croats]], who settled in [[Duchy of Pannonian Croatia|Pannonian Croatia]] and [[Dalmatian Croatia]].

Einhard, ''Vita Karoli Magni'',&nbsp;28.</ref> but that debate obscured the more significant question of ''why'' the Pope granted the title and why Charlemagne accepted it.\n\n[[Roger Collins|Collins]] points out \"[t]hat the motivation behind the acceptance of the imperial title was a romantic and antiquarian interest in reviving the Roman empire is highly unlikely.\"{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=147}} For one thing, such romance would not have appealed either to Franks or Roman Catholics at the turn of the ninth century, both of whom viewed the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] heritage of the Roman Empire with distrust. The Franks took pride in having \"fought against and thrown from their shoulders the heavy yoke of the Romans\" and \"from the knowledge gained in baptism, clothed in gold and precious stones the bodies of the holy martyrs whom the Romans had killed by fire, by the sword and by wild animals\", as [[Pepin the Short|Pepin&nbsp;III]] described it in a law of 763 or 764.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}}\n\nFurthermore, the new title\u2014carrying with it the risk that the new emperor would \"make drastic changes to the traditional styles and procedures of government\" or \"concentrate his attentions on Italy or on Mediterranean concerns more generally\"\u2014risked alienating the Frankish leadership.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=149}}\n\nFor both the Pope and Charlemagne, the Roman Empire remained a significant power in European politics at this time. The [[Byzantine Empire]], based in [[Constantinople]], continued to hold a substantial portion of Italy, with borders not far south of Rome. Charles' sitting in judgment of the Pope could be seen as usurping the prerogatives of the Emperor in Constantinople:\n\n{{quote|By whom, however, could he [the Pope] be tried?

In normal circumstances the only conceivable answer to that question would have been the Emperor at Constantinople; but the imperial throne was at this moment occupied by [[Irene of Athens|Irene]]. That the Empress was notorious for having blinded and murdered her own son was, in the minds of both Leo and Charles, almost immaterial: it was enough that she was a woman. The female sex was known to be incapable of governing, and by the old Salic tradition was debarred from doing so. As far as Western Europe was concerned, the Throne of the Emperors was vacant: Irene's claim to it was merely an additional proof, if any were needed, of the degradation into which the so-called Roman Empire had fallen.|[[John Julius Norwich]]{{sfn|Norwich|1992b|p=378}}|}}\n\n[[File:Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld (German - The Coronation of Charlemagne - Google Art Project.jpg|alt=|thumb|Coronation of Charlemagne, drawing by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]\nFor the Pope, then, there was \"no living Emperor at that time\"{{sfn|Norwich|1992b|p=379}} though [[Henri Pirenne]]{{sfn|Pirenne|2012|p=234n}} disputes this saying that the coronation \"was not in any sense explained by the fact that at this moment a woman was reigning in Constantinople\". Nonetheless, the Pope took the extraordinary step of creating one. The papacy had since 727 been in conflict with Irene's predecessors in Constantinople over a number of issues, chiefly the continued Byzantine adherence to the doctrine of [[iconoclasm]], the destruction of Christian images; while from 750, the secular power of the Byzantine Empire in central Italy had been nullified.\n\n[[File:Couronnement d'un prince - Sacramentaire de Charles le Chauve Lat1141 f2v.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Coronation of an idealised king, depicted in the Sacramentary of [[Charles the Bald]] (about 870)]]\n\nBy bestowing the Imperial crown upon Charlemagne, the Pope arrogated to himself \"the right to appoint&nbsp;... the Emperor of the Romans,&nbsp;... establishing the imperial crown as his own personal gift but simultaneously granting himself implicit superiority over the Emperor whom he had created.\" And \"because the Byzantines had proved so unsatisfactory from every point of view\u2014political, military and doctrinal\u2014he would select a westerner: the one man who by his wisdom and statesmanship and the vastness of his dominions&nbsp;... stood out head and shoulders above his contemporaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Popes: A History|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=978-0701182908|location=|pages=55}}</ref>\n\nWith Charlemagne's coronation, therefore, \"the Roman Empire remained, so far as either of them [Charlemagne and Leo] were concerned, one and indivisible, with Charles as its Emperor\", though there can have been \"little doubt that the coronation, with all that it implied, would be furiously contested in Constantinople\".{{sfn|Norwich|1992a|p=3}}\n\n[[Alcuin]] writes hopefully in his letters of an ''Imperium Christianum'' (\"Christian Empire\"), wherein, \"just as the inhabitants of the [Roman Empire] had been united by a common Roman citizenship\", presumably this new empire would be united by a common Christian faith.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}} This writes the view of Pirenne when he says \"Charles was the Emperor of the ''ecclesia'' as the Pope conceived it, of the Roman Church, regarded as the universal Church\".{{sfn|Pirenne|2012|p=233}} The ''Imperium Christianum'' was further supported at a number of [[synod]]s all across Europe by Paulinus of Aquileia.<ref name=\"Butler1995\">{{cite book |chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XIEAD2MC1YkC|page=74}} |title=Butler's Lives of the Saints: New Full Edition |first=Alban |last=Butler |first2=David |last2=Hugh Farmer |chapter=St Paulinus of Aquileia, Bishop (c. 726\u2013804) |pages=74\u201375 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-86012-250-0}}</ref>\n\nWhat is known, from the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p= 153}} is that Charlemagne's reaction to his coronation was to take the initial steps towards securing the Constantinopolitan throne by sending envoys of marriage to Irene, and that Irene reacted somewhat favourably to them.\n\n[[File:Raphael Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|''[[The Coronation of Charlemagne]]'', by assistants of [[Raphael]], c. 1516\u20131517]]\n\nIt is important to distinguish between the universalist and localist conceptions of the empire, which remain controversial among historians. According to the former, the empire was a universal monarchy, a \"commonwealth of the whole world, whose sublime unity transcended every minor distinction\"; and the emperor \"was entitled to the obedience of Christendom\". According to the latter, the emperor had no ambition for universal dominion; his realm was limited in the same way as that of every other ruler, and when he made more far-reaching claims his object was normally to ward off the attacks either of the Pope or of the Byzantine emperor. According to this view, also, the origin of the empire is to be explained by specific local circumstances rather than by overarching theories.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269851/Holy-Roman-Empire |title=Holy Roman Empire |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Ohnsorge, for a long time, it had been the custom of Byzantium to designate the German princes as spiritual \"sons\" of the Romans. What might have been acceptable in the fifth century had become provoking and insulting to the Franks in the eighth century. Charles came to believe that the Roman emperor, who claimed to head the world hierarchy of states, was, in reality, no greater than Charles himself, a king as other kings, since beginning in 629 he had entitled himself \"Basileus\" (translated literally as \"king\"). Ohnsorge finds it significant that the chief wax seal of Charles, which bore only the inscription: \"Christe, protege Carolum regem Francorum [Christ, protect Charles, king of the Franks], was used from 772 to 813, even during the imperial period and was not replaced by a special imperial seal; indicating that Charles felt himself to be just the king of the Franks. Finally, Ohnsorge points out that in the spring of 813 at Aachen Charles crowned his only surviving son, Louis, as the emperor without recourse to Rome with only the acclamation of his Franks. The form in which this acclamation was offered was Frankish-Christian rather than Roman. This implies both independence from Rome and a Frankish (non-Roman) understanding of empire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clc-library-org-docs.angelfire.com/charlemagne.html |title=Ohnsorge, Werner, ''Das Zweikaiserproblem im fr\u00fcheren Mittelalter.

When the family of Charles ceased to produce worthy heirs, the Pope gladly crowned whichever Italian magnate could best protect him from his local enemies.

The council was not recognised by Charlemagne since no Frankish emissaries had been invited, even though Charlemagne ruled more than three provinces of the classical Roman empire and was considered equal in rank to the Byzantine emperor. And while the Pope supported the reintroduction of the iconic veneration, he politically digressed from Byzantium.<ref name=Becher2011/> He certainly desired to increase the influence of the papacy, to honour his saviour Charlemagne, and to solve the constitutional issues then most troubling to European jurists in an era when Rome was not in the hands of an emperor. Thus, Charlemagne's assumption of the imperial title was not a usurpation in the eyes of the Franks or Italians. It was, however, seen as such in Byzantium, where it was protested by Irene and her successor [[Nikephoros I]]\u2014neither of whom had any great effect in enforcing their protests.\n\nThe East Romans, however, still held several territories in Italy: Venice (what was left of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]), [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]] (in [[Calabria]]), [[Otranto]] (in [[Apulia]]), and [[Naples]] (the ''[[Ducatus Neapolitanus]]''). These regions remained outside of Frankish hands until 804, when the Venetians, torn by infighting, transferred their allegiance to the Iron Crown of Pippin, Charles' son. The ''[[Pax Nicephori]]'' ended. Nicephorus ravaged the coasts with a fleet, initiating the only instance of war between the Byzantines and the Franks. The conflict lasted until 810 when the pro-Byzantine party in Venice gave their city back to the Byzantine Emperor, and the two emperors of Europe made peace: Charlemagne received the [[Istria]]n peninsula and in 812 the emperor [[Michael I Rangabe]] recognised his status as Emperor,<ref>''eum imperatorem et basileum appellantes'', cf.

The Danevirke protected Danish land and gave Godfred the opportunity to harass [[Frisia]] and [[Flanders]] with pirate raids. He also subdued the Frank-allied Veleti and fought the Abotrites.\n\nGodfred invaded Frisia, joked of visiting Aachen, but was murdered before he could do any more, either by a Frankish assassin or by one of his own men.

Pursuing his father's reforms, Charlemagne abolished the monetary system based on the gold {{lang|fr|[[solidus (coin)|sou]]}}. Instead, he and the [[Anglo-Saxon monarchs|Anglo-Saxon King]] [[Offa of Mercia]] took up Pippin's system for pragmatic reasons, notably a shortage of the metal.\n\nThe gold shortage was a direct consequence of the conclusion of peace with Byzantium, which resulted in ceding Venice and Sicily to the East and losing their trade routes to Africa. The resulting standardisation economically harmonised and unified the complex array of currencies that had been in use at the commencement of his reign, thus simplifying trade and commerce.\n\n[[File:Charlemagne denier Tours 793 to 812.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Denier from the era of Charlemagne, [[Tours]], 793\u2013812]]\nCharlemagne established a new standard, the {{lang|fr|[[French livre|livre carolinienne]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|libra]]}}, the modern [[pound (currency)|pound]]), which was based upon a pound of silver\u2014a unit of both money and weight\u2014worth 20 sous (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]}} [which was primarily an accounting device and never actually minted], the modern [[shilling]]) or 240 {{lang|fr|[[denier (coin)|deniers]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[denarius]]}}, the modern [[penny]]). During this period, the {{lang|fr|livre}} and the {{lang|fr|sou}} were counting units; only the {{lang|fr|denier}} was a coin of the realm.\n\nCharlemagne instituted principles for [[accountancy|accounting practice]] by means of the [[Capitulare de villis]] of 802, which laid down strict rules for the way in which incomes and expenses were to be recorded.\n\nCharlemagne applied this system to much of the European continent, and Offa's standard was voluntarily adopted by much of England. After Charlemagne's death, continental coinage degraded, and most of Europe resorted to using the continued high-quality English coin until about 1100.\n\n===Jews in Charlemagne's realm===\nEarly in Charlemagne's rule he tacitly allowed Jews to monopolise money lending. At the time, lending of money for interest was proscribed in 814 because it violated Church law.

His reign is often referred to as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] because of the flowering of scholarship, literature, art and architecture that characterise it.

Joanna Story, (Manchester University Press, 2005), 195.</ref> and Lombard Italy) due to his vast conquests.

At the same time, at the urging of their king, scholars were producing more secular books on many subjects, including history, poetry, art, music, law, theology, etc. Due to the increased number of titles, private libraries flourished. These were mainly supported by aristocrats and churchmen who could afford to sustain them. At Charlemagne's court, a library was founded and a number of copies of books were produced, to be distributed by Charlemagne.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Charlemagne's court library revisited|journal=Early Medieval Europe|year=2003|volume=12|issue=4|pages=339\u201363|doi=10.1111/j.0963-9462.2004.00141.x}}</ref><ref name=\"Anderson2013\" /> Book production was completed slowly by hand and took place mainly in large monastic libraries.

Indeed, the earliest manuscripts available for many ancient texts are Carolingian.

The deepening of the spiritual life was later to be seen as central to public policy and royal governance. His reform focused on strengthening the church's power structure, improving clergy's skill and moral quality, standardising liturgical practices, improvements on the basic tenets of the faith and the rooting out of paganism. His authority extended over church and state. He could discipline clerics, control ecclesiastical property and define orthodox doctrine.

Charlemagne then reconsidered the matter, and in 813, crowned his youngest son, Louis, co-emperor and co-King of the Franks, granting him a half-share of the empire and the rest upon Charlemagne's own death.

Wives and their children\n! Concubines and their children\n|-\n| c.768\n| His first relationship was with [[Himiltrude]]. The nature of this relationship is variously described as [[concubinage]], a legal marriage, or a [[Friedelehe]].<ref>Charlemagne's biographer [[Einhard]] (Vita Karoli Magni, ch. 20) calls her a \"concubine\" and [[Paulus Diaconus]] speaks of Pippin's birth \"before legal marriage\", whereas a letter by [[Pope Stephen III]] refers to Charlemagne and his brother Carloman as being already married (to Himiltrude and [[Gerberga, wife of Carloman I|Gerberga]]), and advises them not to dismiss their wives. Historians have interpreted the information in different ways. Some, such as [[Pierre Rich\u00e9]] (''The Carolingians'', p.86.), follow Einhard in describing Himiltrude as a concubine. Others, for example Dieter H\u00e4gemann (''Karl der Gro\u00dfe. Herrscher des Abendlands'', p. 82f.), consider Himiltrude a wife in the full sense. Still others subscribe to the idea that the relationship between the two was \"something more than concubinage, less than marriage\" and describe it as a [[Friedelehe]], a form of marriage unrecognised by the Church and easily dissolvable. Russell Chamberlin (''The Emperor Charlemagne'', p. 61.), for instance, compared it with the English system of common-law marriage. This form of relationship is often seen in a conflict between Christian marriage and more flexible Germanic concepts.</ref> (Charlemagne put her aside when he married Desiderata.)

In 743, the brothers placed [[Childeric III]] on the throne to curb separatism in the periphery. He was the last Merovingian king. Carloman resigned office in 746, preferring to enter the church as a monk. Pepin brought the question of the kingship before [[Pope Zachary]], asking whether it was logical for a king to have no royal power. The pope handed down his decision in 749, decreeing that it was better for Pepin to be called king, as he had the powers of high office as Mayor, so as not to confuse the hierarchy. He, therefore, ordered him to become the ''true king''.<ref name=\"France/Pippin\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/40284/Pippin-III |title=France :: Pippin III \u2013 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=24 April 2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 750, Pepin was elected by an assembly of the Franks, anointed by the archbishop, and then raised to the office of king. The Pope branded Childeric III as \"the false king\" and ordered him into a monastery. The Merovingian dynasty was thereby replaced by the [[Carolingian]] dynasty, named after Charles Martel. In 753, [[Pope Stephen II]] fled from Italy to Francia, appealing to Pepin for assistance for the rights of St. Peter. He was supported in this appeal by Carloman, Charles' brother<!---should this be Pepin's brother?- Apparently not; Pepin's brother only left the monastery (Monte Cassino), to plead that Pepin NOT provide aid to Stephen II, and was then imprisoned.

He did this by again anointing and confirming Pepin, this time adding his young sons Carolus (Charlemagne) and Carloman to the royal patrimony. They thereby became heirs to the realm that already covered most of western Europe. In 754, Pepin accepted the Pope's invitation to visit Italy on behalf of St. Peter's rights, dealing successfully with the [[Lombards]].<ref name=\"France/Pippin\" /><ref>The background relies heavily on {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Years 745\u2013755}}</ref>\n\nUnder the Carolingians, the Frankish kingdom spread to encompass an area including most of Western Europe; the east-west division of the kingdom formed the basis for modern [[History of France|France]] and [[History of Germany|Germany]].

Plan of This Work}}}}\n\n===Ambiguous high office===\n{{further|Mayor of the Palace}}\n\nThe most powerful officers of the Frankish people, the Mayor of the Palace (''Maior Domus'') and one or more kings (''rex'', ''reges''), were appointed by the election of the people. Elections were not periodic, but were held as required to elect officers ''ad quos summa imperii pertinebat'', \"to whom the highest matters of state pertained\". Evidently, interim decisions could be made by the Pope, which ultimately needed to be ratified using an assembly of the people that met annually.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=1. The Merovingian Family}}\n\nBefore he was elected king in 751, Pepin was initially a mayor, a high office he held \"as though hereditary\" (''velut hereditario fungebatur''). Einhard explains that \"the honour\" was usually \"given by the people\" to the distinguished, but Pepin the Great and his brother Carloman the Wise received it as though hereditary, as had their father, [[Charles Martel]]. There was, however, a certain ambiguity about quasi-inheritance. The office was treated as joint property: one Mayorship held by two brothers jointly.<ref>The ''Annales'' uses maiores domus, a plural followed by a singular: one house, two chief officers. {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 742}}</ref> Each, however, had his own geographic jurisdiction. When Carloman decided to resign, becoming ultimately a Benedictine at [[Monte Cassino]],{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Years 745, 746}} the question of the disposition of his quasi-share was settled by the pope. He converted the mayorship into a kingship and awarded the joint property to Pepin, who gained the right to pass it on by inheritance.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=6. Lombard War}}\n\nThis decision was not accepted by all family members. Carloman had consented to the temporary tenancy of his own share, which he intended to pass on to his son, Drogo, when the inheritance should be settled at someone's death. By the Pope's decision, in which Pepin had a hand, Drogo was to be disqualified as an heir in favour of his cousin Charles. He took up arms in opposition to the decision and was joined by [[Grifo]], a half-brother of Pepin and Carloman, who had been given a share by Charles Martel, but was stripped of it and held under loose arrest by his half-brothers after an attempt to seize their shares by military action. Grifo perished in combat in the Battle of [[Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne]] while Drogo was hunted down and taken into custody.{{sfn|Collins|1998|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nOn the death of Pepin, 24 September 768, the kingship passed jointly to his sons, \"with divine assent\" (''divino nutu'').{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=3. Charlemagne's Accession}} According to the ''Life'', Pepin died in Paris. The Franks \"in general assembly\" (''generali conventu'') gave them both the rank of a king (''reges'') but \"partitioned the whole body of the kingdom equally\" (''totum regni corpus ex aequo partirentur''). The ''annals''{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 768}} tell a slightly different version, with the king dying at [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|St-Denis]], near Paris. The two \"lords\" (''domni'') were \"elevated to kingship\" (''elevati sunt in regnum''), Charles on 9 October in [[Noyon]], Carloman on an unspecified date in [[Soissons]]. If born in 742, Charles was 26 years old, but he had been campaigning at his father's right hand for several years, which may help to account for his military skill. [[Carloman I|Carloman]] was 17.\n\nThe language, in either case, suggests that there were not two inheritances, which would have created distinct kings ruling over distinct kingdoms, but a single joint inheritance and a joint kingship tenanted by two equal kings, Charles and his brother Carloman. As before, distinct jurisdictions were awarded. Charles received Pepin's original share as Mayor: the outer parts of the kingdom bordering on the sea, namely [[Neustria]], western [[Aquitaine]], and the northern parts of [[Austrasia]]; while Carloman was awarded his uncle's former share, the inner parts: southern Austrasia, [[Septimania]], eastern Aquitaine, [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], Provence, and [[Swabia]], lands bordering [[Italy]]. The question of whether these jurisdictions were joint shares reverting to the other brother if one brother died or were inherited property passed on to the descendants of the brother who died was never definitely settled. It came up repeatedly over the succeeding decades until the grandsons of Charlemagne created distinct sovereign kingdoms.\n\n===Aquitainian rebellion===\n====Formation of a new Aquitaine====\n{{main|Aquitaine}}\n\n[[Aquitaine]] under Rome had been in southern [[Gaul]], Romanised and speaking a [[Romance language]]. Similarly, [[Hispania]] had been populated by peoples who spoke various languages, including [[Celtic language|Celtic]], but the area was now populated primarily by Romance language speakers. Between Aquitaine and Hispania were the [[Basques|Euskaldunak]], Latinised to [[Vascones]], or [[Basques]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=32}} living in Basque country, Vasconia, which extended, according to the distributions of place names attributable to the Basques, most densely in the western [[Pyrenees]] but also as far south as the upper [[Ebro River]] in Spain and as far north as the [[Garonne River]] in France.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=105}} The French name, [[Gascony]], derives from [[Vasconia]]. The Romans were never able to entirely subject Vasconia. The parts they did, in which they placed the region's first cities, were sources of legions in the Roman army valued for their fighting abilities. The border with Aquitaine was [[Toulouse]].\n\nAt about 660, the [[Duchy of Vasconia]] united with the [[Duke of Aquitaine|Duchy of Aquitaine]] to form a single realm under [[Felix of Aquitaine]], governing from Toulouse. This was a joint kingship with a Basque Duke, [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus I]].

Evidence of a division of some sort can be found in the distribution of coins imprinted with the name of each king and in the king lists.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=131\u201332}} Wittiza was succeeded by Roderic, who reigned for seven and a half years, followed by Achila (Aquila), who reigned three and a half years. If the reigns of both terminated with the incursion of the [[Saracens]], then Roderic appears to have reigned a few years before the majority of Achila. The latter's kingdom is securely placed to the northeast, while Roderic seems to have taken the rest, notably modern [[Portugal]].\n\nThe Saracens crossed the mountains to claim Ardo's [[Septimania]], only to encounter the Basque dynasty of Aquitaine, always the allies of the Goths.

However, Odo had ambiguously left the kingdom jointly to his two sons, Hunald and Hatto. The latter, loyal to Francia, now went to war with his brother over full possession. Victorious, Hunald blinded and imprisoned his brother, only to be so stricken by conscience that he resigned and entered the church as a monk to do penance. The story is told in [[Annales Mettenses priores]].<ref name=\"Freeman1904\">{{cite book|first=Edward Augustus |last=Freeman|title=Western Europe in the Eighth Century & Onward: An Aftermath|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5HCIvgAACAAJ|page=74}}|year=1904|publisher=Macmillan and Company, limited| page=74}}</ref> His son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] took an early inheritance, becoming duke of Aquitaine and ratified the alliance with Lombardy. Waifer decided to honour it, repeating his father's decision, which he justified by arguing that any agreements with Charles Martel became invalid on Martel's death. Since [[Aquitaine]] was now Pepin's inheritance because of the earlier assistance that was given by Charles Martel, according to some the latter and his son, the young Charles, hunted down Waifer, who could only conduct a guerrilla war, and executed him.{{sfn|Russell|1930|p=88}}\n\nAmong the contingents of the Frankish army were [[Bavaria]]ns under [[Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria]], an [[Agilofing]], the hereditary Bavarian ducal family. [[Grifo]] had installed himself as Duke of Bavaria, but Pepin replaced him with a member of the ducal family yet a child, Tassilo, whose protector he had become after the death of his father. The loyalty of the Agilolfings was perpetually in question, but Pepin exacted numerous oaths of loyalty from Tassilo. However, the latter had married [[Liutperga]], a daughter of [[Desiderius]], king of [[Lombardy]]. At a critical point in the campaign, Tassilo left the field with all his Bavarians. Out of reach of Pepin, he repudiated all loyalty to Francia.{{sfn|McKitterick|2008|pp=118\u201325}} Pepin had no chance to respond as he grew ill and died within a few weeks after Waifer's execution.\n\nThe first event of the brothers' reign was the uprising of the Aquitainians and [[Gascony|Gascons]], in 769, in that territory split between the two kings. One year earlier, Pepin had finally defeated [[Waifer of Aquitaine|Waifer]], [[Duke of Aquitaine]], after waging a destructive, ten-year war against Aquitaine. Now, [[Hunald II]] led the Aquitainians as far north as [[Angoul\u00eame]]. Charles met Carloman, but Carloman refused to participate and returned to Burgundy. Charles went to war, leading an army to [[Bordeaux]], where he set up a fort at Fronsac. Hunald was forced to flee to the court of Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupus&nbsp;II of Gascony]]. Lupus, fearing Charles, turned Hunald over in exchange for peace, and Hunald was put in a monastery. Gascon lords also surrendered, and Aquitaine and [[Duchy of Vasconia|Gascony]] were finally fully subdued by the Franks.\n\n===Marriage to Desiderata===\nThe brothers maintained lukewarm relations with the assistance of their mother Bertrada, but in 770 Charles signed a treaty with Duke [[Tassilo III of Bavaria]] and married a Lombard Princess (commonly known today as [[Desiderata, wife of Charlemagne|Desiderata]]), the daughter of King [[Desiderius]], to surround Carloman with his own allies. Though [[Pope Stephen III]] first opposed the marriage with the Lombard princess, he found little to fear from a Frankish-Lombard alliance.\n\nLess than a year after his marriage, Charlemagne repudiated Desiderata and married a 13-year-old Swabian named [[Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne|Hildegard]]. The repudiated Desiderata returned to her father's court at [[Pavia]]. Her father's wrath was now aroused, and he would have gladly allied with Carloman to defeat Charles. Before any open hostilities could be declared, however, Carloman died on 5 December 771, apparently of natural causes. Carloman's widow [[Gerberge, wife of Carloman|Gerberga]] fled to Desiderius' court with her sons for protection.\n\n==Italian campaigns==\n\n===Conquest of the Lombard kingdom===\n[[File:Charlemagne and Pope Adrian I.jpg|thumb|The Frankish king Charlemagne was a devout Catholic and maintained a close relationship with the papacy throughout his life.

Instead, Desiderius took over certain papal cities and invaded the [[Pentapolis]], heading for Rome. Adrian sent ambassadors to Charlemagne in autumn requesting he enforce the policies of his father, Pepin. Desiderius sent his own ambassadors denying the pope's charges. The ambassadors met at [[Thionville]], and Charlemagne upheld the pope's side. Charlemagne demanded what the pope had requested, but Desiderius swore never to comply.

The pope granted him the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]''. He then returned to Pavia, where the Lombards were on the verge of surrendering. In return for their lives, the Lombards surrendered and opened the gates in early summer. Desiderius was sent to the [[abbey]] of [[Corbie]], and his son Adelchis died in [[Constantinople]], a patrician. Charles, unusually, had himself crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] and made the magnates of Lombardy pay homage to him at Pavia. Only Duke [[Arechis II of Benevento]] refused to submit and proclaimed independence. Charlemagne was then master of Italy as king of the Lombards. He left Italy with a garrison in Pavia and a few Frankish counts in place the same year.\n\nInstability continued in Italy. In 776, Dukes [[Hrodgaud of Friuli]] and [[Hildeprand of Spoleto]] rebelled. Charlemagne rushed back from [[Saxony]] and defeated the Duke of Friuli in battle; the Duke was slain.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=6. Lombard War}} The Duke of Spoleto signed a treaty. Their co-conspirator, Arechis, was not subdued, and Adelchis, their candidate in [[Byzantium]], never left that city.

Charlemagne's siege of [[Salerno]] forced Arechis into submission. However, after Arechis II's death in 787, his son [[Grimoald III of Benevento|Grimoald III]] proclaimed the Duchy of Benevento newly independent. Grimoald was attacked many times by Charles' or his sons' armies, without achieving a definitive victory.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1889|pp=85\u201386}} Charlemagne lost interest and never again returned to [[Southern Italy]] where Grimoald was able to keep the Duchy free from Frankish [[suzerainty]].\n\n==Children==\n[[File:Karl der Grosse - Pippin der Bucklige.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Charlemagne (left) and [[Pepin the Hunchback]] (10th-century copy of 9th-century original)]]\n\nDuring the first peace of any substantial length (780\u2013782), Charles began to appoint his sons to positions of authority. In 781, during a visit to Rome, he made his two youngest sons kings, crowned by the Pope.{{efn|From 781 Adrian began dating papal documents by the years of Charlemagne's reign, instead of the reign of the [[Byzantine Emperor]].<ref>Asimov, I.

Lombard War}}<ref name=Campaigns /> (not to be confused with Charlemagne's eldest, possibly illegitimate son, [[Pepin the Hunchback]]). The younger of the two, [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], became [[King of Aquitaine]]. Charlemagne ordered Pepin and Louis to be raised in the customs of their kingdoms, and he gave their regents some control of their subkingdoms, but kept the real power, though he intended his sons to inherit their realms. He did not tolerate insubordination in his sons: in 792, he banished Pepin the Hunchback to [[Pr\u00fcm Abbey]] because the young man had joined a rebellion against him.\n\nCharles was determined to have his children educated, including his daughters, as his parents had instilled the importance of learning in him at an early age.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hbnY8GTet_kC}}|title=Charlemagne |last=Gelfand|first=Dale Evva|date=2003|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1438117850|language=en}}</ref> His children were also taught skills in accord with their aristocratic status, which included training in riding and weaponry for his sons, and embroidery, spinning and weaving for his daughters.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=bQlJP9O9hKkC}}|title=Daily Life in the Age of Charlemagne|last=Butt|first=John J.|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313316685|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe sons fought many wars on behalf of their father. [[Charles the Younger|Charles]] was mostly preoccupied with the Bretons, whose border he shared and who insurrected on at least two occasions and were easily put down. He also fought the Saxons on multiple occasions. In 805 and 806, he was sent into the B\u00f6hmerwald (modern [[Bohemia]]) to deal with the Slavs living there (Bohemian tribes, ancestors of the modern [[Czech people|Czechs]]). He subjected them to Frankish authority and devastated the valley of the Elbe, forcing tribute from them. Pippin had to hold the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar]] and Beneventan borders and fought the [[Slavs]] to his north. He was uniquely poised to fight the [[Byzantine Empire]] when that conflict arose after Charlemagne's imperial coronation and a [[Venetia (region)|Venetian]] rebellion. Finally, Louis was in charge of the [[Spanish March]] and fought the Duke of Benevento in southern Italy on at least one occasion. He took [[Barcelona]] in a great siege in 797.\n\n[[File:Charlemagne et Louis le Pieux.jpg|thumb|Charlemagne instructing his son [[Louis the Pious]]]]\n\nCharlemagne kept his daughters at home with him and refused to allow them to contract [[marriage#Marriage and religion|sacramental marriages]] (though he originally condoned an engagement between his eldest daughter Rotrude and [[Constantine VI]] of Byzantium, this engagement was annulled when Rotrude was 11).<ref>Runciman, Steven. \"The Empress Irene the Athenian.\" Medieval Women. Ed. Derek Baker.

However, he tolerated their extramarital relationships, even rewarding their common-law husbands and treasuring the illegitimate grandchildren they produced for him. He also, apparently, refused to believe stories of their wild behaviour. After his death the surviving daughters were banished from the court by their brother, the pious Louis, to take up residence in the convents they had been bequeathed by their father. At least one of them, Bertha, had a recognised relationship, if not a marriage, with [[Angilbert]], a member of Charlemagne's court circle.{{sfn|Becher|2005|p=122}}{{sfn|McKitterick|2008|p=91}}\n\n==Carolingian expansion to the south==\n{{See also|Abbasid\u2013Carolingian alliance}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Vasconia and the Pyrenees===\nThe destructive war led by Pepin in Aquitaine, although brought to a satisfactory conclusion for the Franks, proved the Frankish power structure south of the [[Loire]] was feeble and unreliable. After the defeat and death of [[Waiofar]] in 768, while Aquitaine submitted again to the Carolingian dynasty, a new rebellion broke out in 769 led by Hunald II, a possible son of Waifer. He took refuge with the ally Duke [[Lupus II of Gascony]], but probably out of fear of Charlemagne's reprisal, Lupus handed him over to the new King of the Franks to whom he pledged loyalty, which seemed to confirm the peace in [[Duchy of Vasconia|the Basque area]] south of the [[Garonne]].<ref name=Lewis>{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Archibald Ross |year=1965 |title=The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society 718\u20131050 |publisher=University of Texas Press |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nWary of new Basque uprisings, Charlemagne seems to have tried to contain Duke Lupus's power by appointing [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin]] as the Count of Bordeaux (778) and other counts of Frankish background in bordering areas ([[History of Toulouse#768\u2013877: Carolingian Franks and the Kingdom of Aquitaine|Toulouse]], [[County of F\u00e9zensac]]). The [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basque]] Duke, in turn, seems to have contributed decisively or schemed the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] (referred to as \"Basque treachery\"). The defeat of Charlemagne's army in Roncevaux (778) confirmed his determination to rule directly by establishing the Kingdom of Aquitaine (ruled by [[Louis the Pious]]) based on a power base of Frankish officials, distributing lands among colonisers and allocating lands to the Church, which he took as an ally. A Christianisation programme was put in place across the high [[Pyrenees]] (778).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\n[[File:771 CE, Europe.svg|thumb|Europe in 771]]\nThe new political arrangement for Vasconia did not sit well with local lords. As of 788 [[Adalric of Gascony|Adalric]] was fighting and capturing [[Torson of Toulouse|Chorson]], Carolingian Count of Toulouse. He was eventually released, but Charlemagne, enraged at the compromise, decided to depose him and appointed his trustee [[William of Gellone]]. William, in turn, fought the Basques and defeated them after banishing Adalric (790).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\nFrom 781 ([[County of Pallars|Pallars]], [[County of Ribagorza|Ribagor\u00e7a]]) to 806 ([[Pamplona#Early Middle Ages|Pamplona]] under Frankish influence), taking the County of Toulouse for a power base, Charlemagne asserted Frankish authority over the Pyrenees by subduing the south-western marches of Toulouse (790) and establishing vassal counties on the southern Pyrenees that were to make up the [[Marca Hispanica]].{{sfn|Lewis|1965|p=40}} As of 794, a Frankish vassal, the Basque lord Belasko (''al-Galashki'', 'the Gaul') ruled [[\u00c1lava]], but Pamplona remained under Cordovan and local control up to 806. Belasko and the counties in the Marca Hisp\u00e1nica provided the necessary base to attack the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusians]] (an expedition led by [[William of Gellone|William Count of Toulouse]] and Louis the Pious to capture Barcelona in 801). Events in the Duchy of Vasconia (rebellion in Pamplona, [[Aznar Gal\u00edndez I|count overthrown in Aragon]], Duke Seguin of Bordeaux deposed, uprising of the Basque lords, etc.) were to prove it ephemeral upon Charlemagne's death.\n\n===Roncesvalles campaign===\nAccording to the Muslim historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Diet]] of [[Paderborn]] had received the representatives of the Muslim rulers of [[Zaragoza]], [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Huesca]]. Their masters had been cornered in the [[Iberian peninsula]] by [[Abd ar-Rahman I]], the [[Umayyad]] [[emir of C\u00f3rdoba|emir of Cordova]]. These \"Saracen\" ([[Moorish]] and [[Muladi]]) rulers offered their homage to the king of the Franks in return for military support. Seeing an opportunity to extend [[Christendom]] and his own power and believing the Saxons to be a fully conquered nation, Charlemagne agreed to go to Spain.\n\nIn 778, he led the Neustrian army across the Western [[Pyrenees]], while the Austrasians, Lombards, and Burgundians passed over the Eastern Pyrenees. The armies met at Saragossa and Charlemagne received the homage of the Muslim rulers, Sulayman al-Arabi and Kasmin ibn Yusuf, but the city did not fall for him. Indeed, Charlemagne faced the toughest battle of his career. The Muslims forced him to retreat. He decided to go home since he could not trust the [[Basques]], whom he had subdued by conquering [[Pamplona]]. He turned to leave Iberia, but as he was passing through the Pass of [[Roncesvalles]] one of the most famous events of his reign occurred. The Basques attacked and destroyed his rearguard and baggage train. The [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]], though less a battle than a skirmish, left many famous dead, including the [[seneschal]] Eggihard, the count of the palace Anselm, and the [[wikt:warden|warden]] of the [[Breton March]], [[Roland]], inspiring the subsequent creation of the [[Song of Roland]] (''La Chanson de Roland'').\n\n===Contact with the Saracens===\n[[File:Harun-Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Harun al-Rashid]] receiving a delegation of Charlemagne in [[Baghdad]], by [[Julius K\u00f6ckert]] (1864)]]\n\nThe conquest of Italy brought Charlemagne in contact with the [[Saracen]]s who, at the time, controlled the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Charlemagne's eldest son, [[Pepin the Hunchback]], was much occupied with Saracens in Italy. Charlemagne conquered [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]] at an unknown date and in 799 the [[Balearic Islands]]. The islands were often attacked by Saracen pirates, but the counts of [[Genoa]] and Tuscany ([[Boniface I of Tuscany|Boniface]]) controlled them with large fleets until the end of Charlemagne's reign. Charlemagne even had contact with the [[caliph]]al court in [[Baghdad]]. In 797 (or possibly 801), the caliph of Baghdad, [[Harun al-Rashid]], presented Charlemagne with an [[Asian elephant]] named [[Abul-Abbas]] and a [[clock]].<ref name=\"Heck2007\">{{cite book|first=Gene W. |last=Heck|title=When Worlds Collide: Exploring the Ideological and Political Foundations of the Clash of Civilizations|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=dtAyMXqaozwC|page=172}}|year=2007|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-5856-4|pages=172\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Wars with the Moors===\n\nIn [[Hispania]], the struggle against the Moors continued unabated throughout the latter half of his reign. Louis was in charge of the Spanish border. In 785, his men captured Girona permanently and extended Frankish control into the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] littoral for the duration of Charlemagne's reign (the area remained nominally Frankish until the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]] in 1258). The Muslim chiefs in the northeast of [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] were constantly rebelling against Cordovan authority, and they often turned to the Franks for help. The Frankish border was slowly extended until 795, when Girona, [[Cardona, Spain|Cardona]], [[Ausona]] and [[County of Urgell|Urgell]] were united into the new [[Spanish March]], within the old duchy of [[Septimania]].\n\nIn 797, [[Barcelona]], the greatest city of the region, fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against Cordova and, failing, handed it to them. The [[Umayyad]] authority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis of Aquitaine marched the entire army of his kingdom over the [[Pyrenees]] and besieged it for two years, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated. The Franks continued to press forward against the [[emir]]. They took [[Tarragona]] in 809 and [[Tortosa]] in 811. The last conquest brought them to the mouth of the [[Ebro]] and gave them raiding access to [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], prompting the Emir [[al-Hakam I]] to recognise their conquests in 813.\n\n==Eastern campaigns==\n\n===Saxon Wars===\n{{Further|Saxon Wars}}\n[[File:Frankish Empire 481 to 814-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|A map showing Charlemagne's additions (in light green) to the Frankish Kingdom]]\n\nCharlemagne was engaged in almost constant warfare throughout his reign,<ref>France, John, \"The Composition and Raising of the Armies of Charlemagne\", in Journal of Medieval Military History, ed. B. Bachrach (2002), pp. 63\u201365</ref> often at the head of his elite ''[[scara]]'' bodyguard squadrons. In the [[Saxon Wars]], spanning thirty years and eighteen battles, he conquered [[Old Saxony|Saxonia]] and proceeded to convert it to Christianity.\n\nThe [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Saxons]] were divided into four subgroups in four regions. Nearest to [[Austrasia]] was [[Westphalia]] and furthest away was [[Eastphalia]]. Between them was [[Engria]] and north of these three, at the base of the [[Jutland]] peninsula, was [[Nordalbingia]].\n\nIn his first campaign, in 773, Charlemagne forced the Engrians to submit and cut down an [[Irminsul]] pillar near [[Paderborn]].<ref>Revised annals of the kingdom of the Franks, ed. and trans. King, Sources, p. 110</ref> The campaign was cut short by his first expedition to Italy. He returned in 775, marching through Westphalia and conquering the Saxon fort at [[Sigiburg]]. He then crossed Engria, where he defeated the Saxons again. Finally, in Eastphalia, he defeated a Saxon force, and its leader [[Hessi]] converted to Christianity. Charlemagne returned through Westphalia, leaving encampments at Sigiburg and [[Eresburg]], which had been important Saxon bastions. He then controlled Saxony with the exception of Nordalbingia, but Saxon resistance had not ended.\n\nFollowing his subjugation of the Dukes of Friuli and Spoleto, Charlemagne returned rapidly to Saxony in 776, where a rebellion had destroyed his fortress at Eresburg. The Saxons were once again defeated, but their main leader, [[Widukind]], escaped to Denmark, his wife's home. Charlemagne built a new camp at [[Karlstadt am Main|Karlstadt]]. In 777, he called a national diet at Paderborn to integrate Saxony fully into the Frankish kingdom. Many Saxons were baptised as Christians.\n\nIn the summer of 779, he again invaded Saxony and reconquered Eastphalia, Engria and Westphalia. At a diet near [[Lippe]], he divided the land into missionary districts and himself assisted in several mass baptisms (780). He then returned to Italy and, for the first time, the Saxons did not immediately revolt. Saxony was peaceful from 780 to 782.\n\n[[File:Ary Scheffer, Charlemagne re\u00e7oit la soumission de Widukind \u00e0 Paderborn, (1840).jpg|thumb|left|Charlemagne receiving the submission of [[Widukind]] at [[Paderborn]] in 785, painted c.&nbsp;1840 by [[Ary Scheffer]]]]\n\nHe returned to Saxony in 782 and instituted a code of law and appointed counts, both Saxon and Frank. The laws were draconian on religious issues; for example, the ''[[Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae]]'' prescribed death to Saxon pagans who refused to convert to Christianity. This led to renewed conflict. That year, in autumn, Widukind returned and led a new revolt. In response, at [[Verden, Germany|Verden]] in Lower Saxony, Charlemagne is recorded as having ordered the execution of 4,500 Saxon prisoners by beheading, known as the [[Massacre of Verden]] (\"Verdener Blutgericht\"). The killings triggered three years of renewed bloody warfare. During this war, the [[East Frisia]]ns between the [[Lauwers]] and the [[Weser]] joined the Saxons in revolt and were finally subdued.<ref>Oebele Vries, \"Friesland\", ''Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia'' (Routledge, 2001), pp. 252\u201356.</ref> The war ended with Widukind accepting baptism.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yW-GfElbafQC&pg=PA368|title=Encyclopedia of Barbarian Europe: Society in Transformation|first=Michael|last=Frassetto|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003 |isbn=9781576072639|chapter=Widukind|page=368}}</ref> The Frisians afterwards asked for missionaries to be sent to them and a bishop of their own nation, [[Ludger]], was sent.

The Eastphalians and Nordalbingians joined them in 793, but the insurrection was unpopular and was put down by 794. An Engrian rebellion followed in 796, but the presence of Charlemagne, Christian Saxons and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] quickly crushed it. The last insurrection occurred in 804, more than thirty years after Charlemagne's first campaign against them, but also failed. According to Einhard:\n{{quote|\nThe war that had lasted so many years was at length ended by their acceding to the terms offered by the King; which were renunciation of their national religious customs and the worship of devils, acceptance of the sacraments of the Christian faith and religion, and union with the Franks to form one people.\n}}\n\n===Submission of Bavaria===\n[[File:Charlemagne Agostino Cornacchini Vatican 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Equestrian statue of Charlemagne (Cornacchini)|Equestrian statue of Charlemagne]]'' by [[Agostino Cornacchini]] (1725), [[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican City]].]]\n\nBy 774, Charlemagne had invaded the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Kingdom of Lombardy]], and he later annexed the Lombardian territories and assumed its crown, placing the [[Papal States]] under Frankish protection.<ref name=\"autogenerated30\">Historical Atlas of Knights and Castles, Cartographica, Dr Ian Barnes, 2007 pp.30&31</ref> The [[Duchy of Spoleto]] south of Rome was acquired in 774, while in the central western parts of Europe, the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] was absorbed and the Bavarian policy continued of establishing tributary [[marches]], (borders protected in return for tribute or taxes) among the [[Slavs|Slavic]] Serbs and Czechs.

Charlemagne was preoccupied with other matters until 790 when he marched down the [[Danube]] and ravaged Avar territory to the [[Gy\u0151r]]. A Lombard army under Pippin then marched into the [[Drava]] valley and ravaged [[Pannonia]]. The campaigns ended when the Saxons revolted again in 792.\n\nFor the next two years, Charlemagne was occupied, along with the Slavs, against the Saxons. Pippin and Duke [[Eric of Friuli]] continued, however, to assault the Avars' ring-shaped strongholds. The great Ring of the Avars, their capital fortress, was taken twice. The booty was sent to Charlemagne at his capital, [[Aachen]], and redistributed to his followers and to foreign rulers, including King [[Offa of Mercia]]. Soon the Avar [[tudun]]s had lost the will to fight and travelled to Aachen to become vassals to Charlemagne and to become Christians. Charlemagne accepted their surrender and sent one native chief, baptised Abraham, back to Avaria with the ancient title of [[khagan]]. Abraham kept his people in line, but in 800, the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] under [[Krum|Khan Krum]] attacked the remains of the Avar state.\n\nIn 803, Charlemagne sent a Bavarian army into [[Pannonia]], defeating and bringing an end to the [[Avar Khaganate|Avar confederation]].<ref name=\"Rogers\">{{cite book|first1=Bernard S. |last1=Bachrach|author2=Clifford J.

The Slavs ultimately submitted, led by their leader Witzin. Charlemagne then accepted the surrender of the [[Veleti]] under Dragovit and demanded many hostages. He also demanded permission to send missionaries into this pagan region unmolested. The army marched to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] before turning around and marching to the Rhine, winning much booty with no harassment. The tributary Slavs became loyal allies. In 795, when the Saxons broke the peace, the Abotrites and Veleti rebelled with their new ruler against the Saxons. Witzin died in battle and Charlemagne avenged him by harrying the Eastphalians on the Elbe. Thrasuco, his successor, led his men to conquest over the Nordalbingians and handed their leaders over to Charlemagne, who honoured him. The Abotrites remained loyal until Charles' death and fought later against the Danes.\n\n===Southeast Slav expeditions===\n[[File:Europe around 800.gif|thumb|Europe around 800]]\n\nWhen Charlemagne incorporated much of Central Europe, he brought the Frankish state face to face with the Avars and Slavs in the southeast.<ref name=\"Bruce Ross\">{{cite journal | last=Bruce Ross | first=James | pages=212\u201335 | jstor=2854596 | title=Two Neglected Paladins of Charlemagne: Erich of Friuli and Gerold of Bavaria Speculum, Vol. 20, No. 2 | journal=Speculum | volume=20 | issue=2 |date = April 1945| doi=10.2307/2854596 }}</ref> The most southeast Frankish neighbours were [[Croats]], who settled in [[Duchy of Pannonian Croatia|Pannonian Croatia]] and [[Dalmatian Croatia]].

Einhard, ''Vita Karoli Magni'',&nbsp;28.</ref> but that debate obscured the more significant question of ''why'' the Pope granted the title and why Charlemagne accepted it.\n\n[[Roger Collins|Collins]] points out \"[t]hat the motivation behind the acceptance of the imperial title was a romantic and antiquarian interest in reviving the Roman empire is highly unlikely.\"{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=147}} For one thing, such romance would not have appealed either to Franks or Roman Catholics at the turn of the ninth century, both of whom viewed the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] heritage of the Roman Empire with distrust. The Franks took pride in having \"fought against and thrown from their shoulders the heavy yoke of the Romans\" and \"from the knowledge gained in baptism, clothed in gold and precious stones the bodies of the holy martyrs whom the Romans had killed by fire, by the sword and by wild animals\", as [[Pepin the Short|Pepin&nbsp;III]] described it in a law of 763 or 764.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}}\n\nFurthermore, the new title\u2014carrying with it the risk that the new emperor would \"make drastic changes to the traditional styles and procedures of government\" or \"concentrate his attentions on Italy or on Mediterranean concerns more generally\"\u2014risked alienating the Frankish leadership.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=149}}\n\nFor both the Pope and Charlemagne, the Roman Empire remained a significant power in European politics at this time. The [[Byzantine Empire]], based in [[Constantinople]], continued to hold a substantial portion of Italy, with borders not far south of Rome. Charles' sitting in judgment of the Pope could be seen as usurping the prerogatives of the Emperor in Constantinople:\n\n{{quote|By whom, however, could he [the Pope] be tried? Who, in other words, was qualified to pass judgement on the Vicar of Christ? In normal circumstances the only conceivable answer to that question would have been the Emperor at Constantinople; but the imperial throne was at this moment occupied by [[Irene of Athens|Irene]]. That the Empress was notorious for having blinded and murdered her own son was, in the minds of both Leo and Charles, almost immaterial: it was enough that she was a woman. The female sex was known to be incapable of governing, and by the old Salic tradition was debarred from doing so. As far as Western Europe was concerned, the Throne of the Emperors was vacant: Irene's claim to it was merely an additional proof, if any were needed, of the degradation into which the so-called Roman Empire had fallen.|[[John Julius Norwich]]{{sfn|Norwich|1992b|p=378}}|}}\n\n[[File:Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld (German - The Coronation of Charlemagne - Google Art Project.jpg|alt=|thumb|Coronation of Charlemagne, drawing by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]\nFor the Pope, then, there was \"no living Emperor at that time\"{{sfn|Norwich|1992b|p=379}} though [[Henri Pirenne]]{{sfn|Pirenne|2012|p=234n}} disputes this saying that the coronation \"was not in any sense explained by the fact that at this moment a woman was reigning in Constantinople\". Nonetheless, the Pope took the extraordinary step of creating one. The papacy had since 727 been in conflict with Irene's predecessors in Constantinople over a number of issues, chiefly the continued Byzantine adherence to the doctrine of [[iconoclasm]], the destruction of Christian images; while from 750, the secular power of the Byzantine Empire in central Italy had been nullified.\n\n[[File:Couronnement d'un prince - Sacramentaire de Charles le Chauve Lat1141 f2v.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Coronation of an idealised king, depicted in the Sacramentary of [[Charles the Bald]] (about 870)]]\n\nBy bestowing the Imperial crown upon Charlemagne, the Pope arrogated to himself \"the right to appoint&nbsp;... the Emperor of the Romans,&nbsp;... establishing the imperial crown as his own personal gift but simultaneously granting himself implicit superiority over the Emperor whom he had created.\" And \"because the Byzantines had proved so unsatisfactory from every point of view\u2014political, military and doctrinal\u2014he would select a westerner: the one man who by his wisdom and statesmanship and the vastness of his dominions&nbsp;... stood out head and shoulders above his contemporaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Popes: A History|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=978-0701182908|location=|pages=55}}</ref>\n\nWith Charlemagne's coronation, therefore, \"the Roman Empire remained, so far as either of them [Charlemagne and Leo] were concerned, one and indivisible, with Charles as its Emperor\", though there can have been \"little doubt that the coronation, with all that it implied, would be furiously contested in Constantinople\".{{sfn|Norwich|1992a|p=3}}\n\n[[Alcuin]] writes hopefully in his letters of an ''Imperium Christianum'' (\"Christian Empire\"), wherein, \"just as the inhabitants of the [Roman Empire] had been united by a common Roman citizenship\", presumably this new empire would be united by a common Christian faith.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}} This writes the view of Pirenne when he says \"Charles was the Emperor of the ''ecclesia'' as the Pope conceived it, of the Roman Church, regarded as the universal Church\".{{sfn|Pirenne|2012|p=233}} The ''Imperium Christianum'' was further supported at a number of [[synod]]s all across Europe by Paulinus of Aquileia.<ref name=\"Butler1995\">{{cite book |chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XIEAD2MC1YkC|page=74}} |title=Butler's Lives of the Saints: New Full Edition |first=Alban |last=Butler |first2=David |last2=Hugh Farmer |chapter=St Paulinus of Aquileia, Bishop (c. 726\u2013804) |pages=74\u201375 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-86012-250-0}}</ref>\n\nWhat is known, from the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p= 153}} is that Charlemagne's reaction to his coronation was to take the initial steps towards securing the Constantinopolitan throne by sending envoys of marriage to Irene, and that Irene reacted somewhat favourably to them.\n\n[[File:Raphael Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|''[[The Coronation of Charlemagne]]'', by assistants of [[Raphael]], c. 1516\u20131517]]\n\nIt is important to distinguish between the universalist and localist conceptions of the empire, which remain controversial among historians. According to the former, the empire was a universal monarchy, a \"commonwealth of the whole world, whose sublime unity transcended every minor distinction\"; and the emperor \"was entitled to the obedience of Christendom\". According to the latter, the emperor had no ambition for universal dominion; his realm was limited in the same way as that of every other ruler, and when he made more far-reaching claims his object was normally to ward off the attacks either of the Pope or of the Byzantine emperor. According to this view, also, the origin of the empire is to be explained by specific local circumstances rather than by overarching theories.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269851/Holy-Roman-Empire |title=Holy Roman Empire |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Ohnsorge, for a long time, it had been the custom of Byzantium to designate the German princes as spiritual \"sons\" of the Romans. What might have been acceptable in the fifth century had become provoking and insulting to the Franks in the eighth century. Charles came to believe that the Roman emperor, who claimed to head the world hierarchy of states, was, in reality, no greater than Charles himself, a king as other kings, since beginning in 629 he had entitled himself \"Basileus\" (translated literally as \"king\"). Ohnsorge finds it significant that the chief wax seal of Charles, which bore only the inscription: \"Christe, protege Carolum regem Francorum [Christ, protect Charles, king of the Franks], was used from 772 to 813, even during the imperial period and was not replaced by a special imperial seal; indicating that Charles felt himself to be just the king of the Franks. Finally, Ohnsorge points out that in the spring of 813 at Aachen Charles crowned his only surviving son, Louis, as the emperor without recourse to Rome with only the acclamation of his Franks. The form in which this acclamation was offered was Frankish-Christian rather than Roman. This implies both independence from Rome and a Frankish (non-Roman) understanding of empire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clc-library-org-docs.angelfire.com/charlemagne.html |title=Ohnsorge, Werner, ''Das Zweikaiserproblem im fr\u00fcheren Mittelalter.

The council was not recognised by Charlemagne since no Frankish emissaries had been invited, even though Charlemagne ruled more than three provinces of the classical Roman empire and was considered equal in rank to the Byzantine emperor. And while the Pope supported the reintroduction of the iconic veneration, he politically digressed from Byzantium.<ref name=Becher2011/> He certainly desired to increase the influence of the papacy, to honour his saviour Charlemagne, and to solve the constitutional issues then most troubling to European jurists in an era when Rome was not in the hands of an emperor. Thus, Charlemagne's assumption of the imperial title was not a usurpation in the eyes of the Franks or Italians. It was, however, seen as such in Byzantium, where it was protested by Irene and her successor [[Nikephoros I]]\u2014neither of whom had any great effect in enforcing their protests.\n\nThe East Romans, however, still held several territories in Italy: Venice (what was left of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]), [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]] (in [[Calabria]]), [[Otranto]] (in [[Apulia]]), and [[Naples]] (the ''[[Ducatus Neapolitanus]]''). These regions remained outside of Frankish hands until 804, when the Venetians, torn by infighting, transferred their allegiance to the Iron Crown of Pippin, Charles' son. The ''[[Pax Nicephori]]'' ended. Nicephorus ravaged the coasts with a fleet, initiating the only instance of war between the Byzantines and the Franks. The conflict lasted until 810 when the pro-Byzantine party in Venice gave their city back to the Byzantine Emperor, and the two emperors of Europe made peace: Charlemagne received the [[Istria]]n peninsula and in 812 the emperor [[Michael I Rangabe]] recognised his status as Emperor,<ref>''eum imperatorem et basileum appellantes'', cf.

Pursuing his father's reforms, Charlemagne abolished the monetary system based on the gold {{lang|fr|[[solidus (coin)|sou]]}}. Instead, he and the [[Anglo-Saxon monarchs|Anglo-Saxon King]] [[Offa of Mercia]] took up Pippin's system for pragmatic reasons, notably a shortage of the metal.\n\nThe gold shortage was a direct consequence of the conclusion of peace with Byzantium, which resulted in ceding Venice and Sicily to the East and losing their trade routes to Africa. The resulting standardisation economically harmonised and unified the complex array of currencies that had been in use at the commencement of his reign, thus simplifying trade and commerce.\n\n[[File:Charlemagne denier Tours 793 to 812.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Denier from the era of Charlemagne, [[Tours]], 793\u2013812]]\nCharlemagne established a new standard, the {{lang|fr|[[French livre|livre carolinienne]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|libra]]}}, the modern [[pound (currency)|pound]]), which was based upon a pound of silver\u2014a unit of both money and weight\u2014worth 20 sous (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]}} [which was primarily an accounting device and never actually minted], the modern [[shilling]]) or 240 {{lang|fr|[[denier (coin)|deniers]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[denarius]]}}, the modern [[penny]]). During this period, the {{lang|fr|livre}} and the {{lang|fr|sou}} were counting units; only the {{lang|fr|denier}} was a coin of the realm.\n\nCharlemagne instituted principles for [[accountancy|accounting practice]] by means of the [[Capitulare de villis]] of 802, which laid down strict rules for the way in which incomes and expenses were to be recorded.\n\nCharlemagne applied this system to much of the European continent, and Offa's standard was voluntarily adopted by much of England. After Charlemagne's death, continental coinage degraded, and most of Europe resorted to using the continued high-quality English coin until about 1100.\n\n===Jews in Charlemagne's realm===\nEarly in Charlemagne's rule he tacitly allowed Jews to monopolise money lending. At the time, lending of money for interest was proscribed in 814 because it violated Church law. Charlemagne introduced the ''[[Capitulary for the Jews]]'', a prohibition on Jews engaging in money-lending due to the religious convictions of the majority of his constituents, in essence banning it across the board, a reversal of his earlier recorded general policy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldology.com/Europe/early_dark_ages_3.htm |title=Charlemagne created a peaceful environment for Jews in his kingdom.

Carolus Magnus.jpg|thumb|Charlemagne in a copper engraving of the 16th-century by Giovanni Battista Cavalieri]]\n\nPart of Charlemagne's success as a warrior, an administrator and ruler can be traced to his admiration for learning and education. His reign is often referred to as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] because of the flowering of scholarship, literature, art and architecture that characterise it. Charlemagne came into contact with the culture and learning of other countries (especially Moorish Spain, Anglo-Saxon England,<ref>''Charlemagne and Anglo-Saxon England'', Joanna Story, ''Charlemagne: Empire and Society'', ed. Joanna Story, (Manchester University Press, 2005), 195.</ref> and Lombard Italy) due to his vast conquests. He greatly increased the provision of monastic schools and scriptoria (centres for book-copying) in Francia.\n\nCharlemagne was a lover of books, sometimes having them read to him during meals. He was thought to enjoy the works of [[Augustine of Hippo]].<ref name=\"onlinelibrary.wiley.com\">{{cite journal |last=Bullough |first=Donald A. |authorlink=Donald A.

Due to the increased interest of intellectual pursuits and the urging of their king, the monks accomplished so much copying that almost every manuscript from that time was preserved. At the same time, at the urging of their king, scholars were producing more secular books on many subjects, including history, poetry, art, music, law, theology, etc. Due to the increased number of titles, private libraries flourished. These were mainly supported by aristocrats and churchmen who could afford to sustain them. At Charlemagne's court, a library was founded and a number of copies of books were produced, to be distributed by Charlemagne.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Charlemagne's court library revisited|journal=Early Medieval Europe|year=2003|volume=12|issue=4|pages=339\u201363|doi=10.1111/j.0963-9462.2004.00141.x}}</ref><ref name=\"Anderson2013\" /> Book production was completed slowly by hand and took place mainly in large monastic libraries.

Indeed, the earliest manuscripts available for many ancient texts are Carolingian. It is almost certain that a text which survived to the Carolingian age survives still.\n\nThe pan-European nature of Charlemagne's influence is indicated by the origins of many of the men who worked for him: [[Alcuin]], an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] from [[York]]; [[Theodulf]], a [[Visigoths|Visigoth]], probably from [[Septimania]]; [[Paul the Deacon]], Lombard; [[Italians]] [[Peter of Pisa]] and [[Saint Paulinus II|Paulinus of Aquileia]]; and Franks [[Angilbert]], Angilram, [[Einhard]] and [[Waldo of Reichenau]].\n\nCharlemagne promoted the [[liberal arts]] at court, ordering that his children and grandchildren be well-educated, and even studying himself (in a time when even leaders who promoted education did not take time to learn themselves) under the tutelage of Peter of Pisa, from whom he learned grammar; Alcuin, with whom he studied rhetoric, dialectic (logic), and astronomy (he was particularly interested in the movements of the stars); and Einhard, who tutored him in arithmetic.{{sfn|Dutton|2016}}\n\nHis great scholarly failure, as Einhard relates, was his inability to write: when in his old age he attempted to learn\u2014practising the formation of letters in his bed during his free time on books and wax tablets he hid under his pillow\u2014\"his effort came too late in life and achieved little success\", and his ability to read\u2014which Einhard is silent about, and which no contemporary source supports\u2014has also been called into question.{{sfn|Dutton|2016}}\n\nIn 800, Charlemagne enlarged the hostel at the [[Muristan]] in [[Jerusalem]] and added a library to it.

The deepening of the spiritual life was later to be seen as central to public policy and royal governance. His reform focused on strengthening the church's power structure, improving clergy's skill and moral quality, standardising liturgical practices, improvements on the basic tenets of the faith and the rooting out of paganism. His authority extended over church and state. He could discipline clerics, control ecclesiastical property and define orthodox doctrine. Despite the harsh legislation and sudden change, he had developed support from clergy who approved his desire to deepen the piety and morals of his subjects.<ref name=britannica>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/106546/Charlemagne |title=Charlemagne |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date= 2012 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 809\u2013810, Charlemagne called a church council in [[Aachen]], which confirmed the unanimous belief in the West that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (''ex Patre [[Filioque]]'') and sanctioned inclusion in the [[Nicene Creed]] of the phrase ''Filioque'' (and the Son).

[[Carolingian minuscule]] was created partly under the patronage of Charlemagne. [[Alcuin]], who ran the palace school and [[scriptorium]] at Aachen, was probably a chief influence.\n\nThe revolutionary character of the Carolingian reform, however, can be over-emphasised; efforts at taming Merovingian and Germanic influence had been underway before Alcuin arrived at Aachen. The new minuscule was disseminated first from Aachen and later from the influential scriptorium at [[Tours]], where Alcuin retired as an abbot.\n\n===Political reforms===\nCharlemagne engaged in many reforms of Frankish governance while continuing many traditional practices, such as the division of the kingdom among sons.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The rise of the medieval world, 500\u20131300: a biographical dictionary|last=Schulman|first=Jana K.|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0313011085|location=Westport, CN|page=xx}}</ref>\n\n====Divisio regnorum====\nIn 806, Charlemagne first made provision for the traditional division of the empire on his death.

Louis received Aquitaine, the Spanish March and [[Provence]]. The imperial title was not mentioned, which led to the suggestion that, at that particular time, Charlemagne regarded the title as an honorary achievement that held no hereditary significance.\n\nPepin died in 810 and Charles in 811. Charlemagne then reconsidered the matter, and in 813, crowned his youngest son, Louis, co-emperor and co-King of the Franks, granting him a half-share of the empire and the rest upon Charlemagne's own death. The only part of the Empire that Louis was not promised was Italy, which Charlemagne specifically bestowed upon Pippin's illegitimate son [[Bernard of Italy|Bernard]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LUCPcwybApIC&pg=PA10&dq=Bernard+of+Italy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4mIyl-5PXAhVCOyYKHUBcD6oQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=Bernard%20of%20Italy&f=false Noble, Thomas F.

In addition, he had a grandson ([[Bernard of Italy]], the only son of his third son, [[Pepin of Italy]]), who was illegitimate but included in the line of inheritance. Among his descendants are several royal dynasties, including the [[Habsburg]], [[Capetian]] and [[Plantagenet]] dynasties. By consequence, most if not all established European noble families ever since can genealogically trace their background to Charlemagne.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Start date\n! Wives and their children\n! Concubines and their children\n|-\n| c.768\n| His first relationship was with [[Himiltrude]]. The nature of this relationship is variously described as [[concubinage]], a legal marriage, or a [[Friedelehe]].<ref>Charlemagne's biographer [[Einhard]] (Vita Karoli Magni, ch. 20) calls her a \"concubine\" and [[Paulus Diaconus]] speaks of Pippin's birth \"before legal marriage\", whereas a letter by [[Pope Stephen III]] refers to Charlemagne and his brother Carloman as being already married (to Himiltrude and [[Gerberga, wife of Carloman I|Gerberga]]), and advises them not to dismiss their wives. Historians have interpreted the information in different ways. Some, such as [[Pierre Rich\u00e9]] (''The Carolingians'', p.86.), follow Einhard in describing Himiltrude as a concubine. Others, for example Dieter H\u00e4gemann (''Karl der Gro\u00dfe. Herrscher des Abendlands'', p. 82f.), consider Himiltrude a wife in the full sense. Still others subscribe to the idea that the relationship between the two was \"something more than concubinage, less than marriage\" and describe it as a [[Friedelehe]], a form of marriage unrecognised by the Church and easily dissolvable. Russell Chamberlin (''The Emperor Charlemagne'', p. 61.), for instance, compared it with the English system of common-law marriage. This form of relationship is often seen in a conflict between Christian marriage and more flexible Germanic concepts.</ref> (Charlemagne put her aside when he married Desiderata.)

Its physical features vary greatly from the [[Mixedwood Plains Ecozone (Canada)|Mixedwood Plains]] in the southeast to the [[Taiga|boreal forests]] and [[tundra]] in the north.  Ontario borders Manitoba to the west,  [[Hudson Bay]] and [[James Bay]] to the north, [[Quebec]] to the east, and the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[United States]] to the south.   The province is named for Great [[Lake Ontario]], an adaptation of the [[Iroquois]] word ''Onitariio'', meaning \"beautiful lake\", or ''Kanadario'', variously translated as \"beautiful water\". There are approximately 250,000 lakes and over {{convert|100,000|km|mi}} of rivers in the province.\n\nAlmost 94% of the population is concentrated within [[Southern Ontario]], where the population was over 12,100,000 in the 2006 census.

To its north is the [[Boreal Shield]], the largest provincial ecozone, extending from south-central Ontario to cover most of northern Ontario, where it abuts the [[Hudson Plains]]. The [[Northwestern Ontario]] portion of this area is part of the [[Midwestern Canadian Shield forests]] ecoregion of [[boreal forest]] that spreads west through [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]]. The plains that cover the heartland of Ontario are a transitional ecozone characterized by boreal features in the south and [[tundra]] landscapes in the north. This extends the entire range of the northern coast of Ontario with [[Hudson Bay]] and [[James Bay]], at which numerous [[wetland]]s act as [[Staging area (birds)|staging]] and nesting grounds for [[Bird migration|migratory birds]]. The waters of the two bays are in the [[Arctic Archipelago Marine]] ecozone, forming its southern, subarctic extent.\n\n===Geology===\nOntario, owing to its size, has diverse geology that varies in structure, age, and lithology.

The boundary follows a small portion of land south of the Ottawa River until it meets the [[Saint Lawrence River]] near [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]].\n\nOntario also shares borders with several [[U.S. state]]s.  From west to east, the [[Minnesota]] border consists of the [[Lake of the Woods]], [[Rainy River (Minnesota\u2013Ontario)|Rainy River]], [[Rainy Lake]] and its tributaries.  The border then includes the only 1&nbsp;km of land of its entire 2,700&nbsp;km U.S. border, the [[Height of Land Portage]], which divides the [[Arctic Ocean]] and [[Nelson River]] watershed from that of the [[Saint Lawrence River|St Lawrence River]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  The U.S./Minnesota border then follows tributaries of the [[Pigeon River (Minnesota\u2013Ontario)|Pigeon River]] to its mouth at Lake Superior.   Ontario borders [[Michigan]] across [[Lake Superior]], the [[St. Marys River (Michigan\u2013Ontario)|Saint Mary's River]], [[Lake Huron]], the [[St. Clair River]], [[Lake St. Clair]], the [[Detroit River]], and [[Lake Erie]].  The province also borders [[Ohio]] and [[Pennsylvania]] across Lake Erie.  The 309&nbsp;km boundary with [[New York (state)|New York]] includes [[Lake Ontario]], the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence]] and [[Niagara River|Niagara]] rivers.\n\n===Elevation===\n\nAn extensive amount of land along the south and west shores of [[James Bay]] and [[Hudson Bay]] is low and swampy. The land in the North-east and North-west, generally north of [[Lake Superior]], is the [[Canadian Shield]] where most of Ontario's highest points are found.\n\nFurther south, many hilltops of the Algonquin, Haliburton and Madawaska Highlands, which are also part of the shield that covers much of the north, surpass altitudes of 500m (1640').\n\nThe highest areas in the southern portion of the province are found in [[Dufferin County|Dufferin]], [[Grey County|Grey]] and the western side of [[Simcoe County|Simcoe]] counties, where the elevation ranges from 430m (1,400') to 540m (1,750'). Much of the higher land sits atop the [[Niagara Escarpment]] in a generally flat area known as the Dundalk Highlands. Just to the south, in [[Wellington County, Ontario|Wellington County]] and [[Waterloo Region, Ontario|Waterloo Region]], general elevations are from 300m (1,000') to 400m (1,300'). A striking topographical feature of the Niagara Escarpment is its limestone cliff face, in general between 80m (250') and 100 (330') above the surrounding land, extending from the Niagara peninsula northwest to the [[Bruce Peninsula]].<ref name=\"bookreference\">Book: A conspectus of the Province of Ontario</ref>\n\nThe flattest areas of the province can be found in the lowlands of the far north, and in southwestern and eastern Ontario.\n\n===Water===\n[[Image:Niagara Falls and Maid of the Mist 2005.JPG|280px|right|thumb|[[Niagara Falls]], one of Ontario's most noted tourist destination and a source for hydroelectricity]]\nOntario is known for the large number of lakes and rivers it contains. About one-fifth of the world's fresh water can be found in Ontario.<ref name=\"freshwateralot\">[https://www.ontario.ca/en/about_ontario/ONT04_020887 Water Geography information.]</ref> Ontario is also known for being the only province in Canada that touches the [[Great Lakes]]. Ontario touches four of the Great Lakes: [[Lake Huron|Huron]], [[Lake Ontario]] (the province is named after the lake), [[Lake Erie|Erie]] and [[Lake Superior|Superior]].\n\nOntario's vast rivers and lakes originally opened the province for exploration and have made possible hydroelectric power, mills and various forms of industrialization. Most of Ontario is fed by rainfall, and in most parts [[snow]] is relied on. Precipitation is most common in the southern and central parts of Ontario where variations among the seasons are not especially great; but winter and spring are less aqueous than in northern and northwestern Ontario.<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1SEC875403]{{dead link|date=July 2017}} The Canadian Encyclopedia, Geography information of Ontario.</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Ontario K\u00f6ppen.svg|300px|thumb|K\u00f6ppen climate types of Ontario]]\nThe climate of Ontario varies by season and location.<ref name=EC>{{cite web |url = http://www.on.ec.gc.ca/canada-country-study/intro.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130323131703/http://www.on.ec.gc.ca/canada-country-study/intro.html |archivedate = March 23, 2013 |title = The Canada Country Study: Climate Impacts and Adaptation: Ontario Region Executive Summary |publisher = Environment Canada |accessdate = January 29, 2013}}</ref> It is affected by three air sources: cold, dry, arctic air from the north (dominant factor during the winter months, and for a longer part of the year in far northern Ontario); Pacific polar air crossing in from the western Canadian Prairies/US [[Northern Plains]]; and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.<ref name=UBCgeo>{{cite web |first1 = David |last1 = Baldwin |first2 = Joseph |last2 = Desloges |first3 = Lawrence |last3 = Band |url = http://www.ubcpress.ca/books/pdf/chapters/ecology/chapter2.pdf |title = Physical Geography of Ontario |publisher = UBC Press |accessdate = March 25, 2013 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217184751/http://www.ubcpress.ca/books/pdf/chapters/ecology/chapter2.pdf |archivedate = December 17, 2007 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> The effects of these major air masses on temperature and precipitation depend mainly on latitude, proximity to major bodies of water and to a small extent, terrain relief.<ref name= UBCgeo/> The surrounding Great Lakes greatly influence the climatic region of southern Ontario.<ref name=\"EC\"/> During the fall and winter months, heat stored from the lakes is released, moderating the climate near the shores of the lakes.<ref name=EPA>{{cite web |url = http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/atlas/glat-ch2.html |title = Natural Processes in the Great Lakes |publisher = US Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate = March 25, 2013 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130202002550/http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/atlas/glat-ch2.html |archivedate = February 2, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> This gives some parts of southern Ontario milder winters than mid-continental areas at lower latitudes.<ref name= EPA/> In general, most of Ontario's climate is classified as [[humid continental]].<ref name= UBCgeo/> Ontario has three main climatic regions:\n\n===Southern Ontario===\n\nAlmost all of southern Ontario is [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] Dfb, including the cities of [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa]], [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] and [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]. The region has warm, humid summers and cold, usually moist winters. Extreme heat and cold usually occur for short periods. It is considered a temperate climate when compared with the remainder of continental Canada.  In the fall and winter, temperatures are moderated by the delayed cooling of the Great Lakes; this effect is reversed in spring and summer when afternoon warming is tempered. The lakes' moderating effects allow for a longer growing season than areas at similar latitudes in the continent's interior; some areas exceed 200 frost-free days and have an annual mean temperature of 10&nbsp;\u00b0C (50&nbsp;\u00b0F). Both spring and fall generally consist of mild days and cool nights but are prone to drastic temperature changes over a short timespan. Annual precipitation ranges from 75 to 110&nbsp;cm (30\u201343&nbsp;in) and is well distributed throughout the year with a usual summer peak. Upland areas in this region have cooler conditions, generally more precipitation (especially snowfall), putting them into the Dfb climate scheme. Most of this region lies in the lee of the Great Lakes, making for abundant snow in some areas (London, [[Goderich, Ontario|Goderich]] for example) receive an average of over 2 m (80\"), while some other areas are not in the direct snowbelt and receive closer to an average of 1 m (40\") of snow per year. Also included in the Dfb climate are the southern reaches of Northern Ontario, including the cities of Sudbury and North Bay, which have a more severe humid continental climate. This region has warm and sometimes hot summers with cold, longer winters with roughly equal annual precipitation to the south. Along the eastern shores of Lake Superior and Lake Huron (including [[Georgian Bay]]), frequent heavy lake-effect snow squalls increase seasonal snowfall totals upwards of 3 m (120&nbsp;in). Such conditions and the absence of long stretches of brutal cold make for excellent winter recreation. K\u00f6ppen climate  Dfa is represented in the southwestern tip of Ontario including the city of Windsor and a small area of the Golden Horseshoe region. This regions climate has similarities to that of the lower Great Lakes portion of the [[Midwestern United States]].\n\n===Northern Ontario===\n\nK\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfc: The northernmost parts of Ontario\u2014primarily north of 50\u00b0N and with no major cities in the area\u2014have a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen) with long, severely cold winters and short summers, with dramatic temperature changes possible in all seasons. In summer, hot weather occasionally reaches even the northernmost parts of Ontario for brief periods, although humidity is generally lower than in the south. With no major mountain ranges blocking sinking Arctic air masses, temperatures of \u221240&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u221240&nbsp;\u00b0F) are not uncommon. The snow stays on the ground much longer here than in other regions of Ontario; snow cover is usually present to some extent between October and May.\n\n===Severe weather===\n\nSevere and non-severe thunderstorms peak in frequency from June through August but can occur at any time. Thunderstorms form from daytime convective heating and frontal activity; in the south, lake breeze convergences also intensify storms. Another severe type of thunderstorm is known as a [[Mesocyclonic Convective Complex]] or [[Derecho]], which is a larger cluster-type thunderstorm mass with a more or less circular shape, often with a pronounced bow shape at its front or leading edge. During periods of hot weather in summer, they often develop in the afternoon west of the Great Lakes then strike Southern and Central Ontario at night with great forward motion, bringing severe straight-line winds over wide areas resulting in damage to forests, power interruption and infrastructure damage. The areas with the highest severe weather frequency in the province are Southwestern (Windsor, Chatham, Stratford corridor) and Central Ontario (Simcoe County including the city of Barrie, [[Lake Simcoe]] and the [[Kawartha Lakes]] region), both areas often getting amplified storms resulting from the Lake Breeze Front convergence. London has the most lightning strikes per year in Canada, averaging 34 days of thunderstorm activity per year. In a typical year, Ontario averages 15 confirmed tornado touchdowns, but this number has recently been increasing. These tornadoes, however, are rarely destructive (the vast majority are classified as EF0 or EF1 on the Enhanced Fujita scale). In Northern Ontario, some tornadoes go undetected by ground spotters because of the sparse population and remote landscape; they are often discovered after the fact by aircraft pilots, where aerial observations of damaged forest confirm occurrences. All of Northern Ontario north of a line from [[Lake Nipigon]] to [[Timmins]] has no weather radar coverage by [[Environment Canada]] making it difficult to detect tornadoes in far northern Ontario when they occur. Tropical depression remnants can cause copious rains and winds in the south, but are rarely deadly. A notable exception was [[Hurricane Hazel]] in October 1954.\n\n===Climate charts===\n\n{{climate chart\n| Windsor\n|-7.3 |-0.3 |62.1\n|-6.3 |1.1 |62.2  \n|-2.2 |6.7 |70\n|3.7 |14.1 |83 \n|9.5 |20.4

It is Canada's second largest province in total land area.  Its physical features vary greatly from the [[Mixedwood Plains Ecozone (Canada)|Mixedwood Plains]] in the southeast to the [[Taiga|boreal forests]] and [[tundra]] in the north.  Ontario borders Manitoba to the west,  [[Hudson Bay]] and [[James Bay]] to the north, [[Quebec]] to the east, and the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[United States]] to the south.   The province is named for Great [[Lake Ontario]], an adaptation of the [[Iroquois]] word ''Onitariio'', meaning \"beautiful lake\", or ''Kanadario'', variously translated as \"beautiful water\". There are approximately 250,000 lakes and over {{convert|100,000|km|mi}} of rivers in the province.\n\nAlmost 94% of the population is concentrated within [[Southern Ontario]], where the population was over 12,100,000 in the 2006 census.

To its north is the [[Boreal Shield]], the largest provincial ecozone, extending from south-central Ontario to cover most of northern Ontario, where it abuts the [[Hudson Plains]]. The [[Northwestern Ontario]] portion of this area is part of the [[Midwestern Canadian Shield forests]] ecoregion of [[boreal forest]] that spreads west through [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]]. The plains that cover the heartland of Ontario are a transitional ecozone characterized by boreal features in the south and [[tundra]] landscapes in the north. This extends the entire range of the northern coast of Ontario with [[Hudson Bay]] and [[James Bay]], at which numerous [[wetland]]s act as [[Staging area (birds)|staging]] and nesting grounds for [[Bird migration|migratory birds]]. The waters of the two bays are in the [[Arctic Archipelago Marine]] ecozone, forming its southern, subarctic extent.\n\n===Geology===\nOntario, owing to its size, has diverse geology that varies in structure, age, and lithology.

The boundary follows a small portion of land south of the Ottawa River until it meets the [[Saint Lawrence River]] near [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]].\n\nOntario also shares borders with several [[U.S. state]]s.  From west to east, the [[Minnesota]] border consists of the [[Lake of the Woods]], [[Rainy River (Minnesota\u2013Ontario)|Rainy River]], [[Rainy Lake]] and its tributaries.  The border then includes the only 1&nbsp;km of land of its entire 2,700&nbsp;km U.S. border, the [[Height of Land Portage]], which divides the [[Arctic Ocean]] and [[Nelson River]] watershed from that of the [[Saint Lawrence River|St Lawrence River]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  The U.S./Minnesota border then follows tributaries of the [[Pigeon River (Minnesota\u2013Ontario)|Pigeon River]] to its mouth at Lake Superior.   Ontario borders [[Michigan]] across [[Lake Superior]], the [[St. Marys River (Michigan\u2013Ontario)|Saint Mary's River]], [[Lake Huron]], the [[St. Clair River]], [[Lake St. Clair]], the [[Detroit River]], and [[Lake Erie]].  The province also borders [[Ohio]] and [[Pennsylvania]] across Lake Erie.  The 309&nbsp;km boundary with [[New York (state)|New York]] includes [[Lake Ontario]], the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence]] and [[Niagara River|Niagara]] rivers.\n\n===Elevation===\n\nAn extensive amount of land along the south and west shores of [[James Bay]] and [[Hudson Bay]] is low and swampy. The land in the North-east and North-west, generally north of [[Lake Superior]], is the [[Canadian Shield]] where most of Ontario's highest points are found.\n\nFurther south, many hilltops of the Algonquin, Haliburton and Madawaska Highlands, which are also part of the shield that covers much of the north, surpass altitudes of 500m (1640').\n\nThe highest areas in the southern portion of the province are found in [[Dufferin County|Dufferin]], [[Grey County|Grey]] and the western side of [[Simcoe County|Simcoe]] counties, where the elevation ranges from 430m (1,400') to 540m (1,750'). Much of the higher land sits atop the [[Niagara Escarpment]] in a generally flat area known as the Dundalk Highlands. Just to the south, in [[Wellington County, Ontario|Wellington County]] and [[Waterloo Region, Ontario|Waterloo Region]], general elevations are from 300m (1,000') to 400m (1,300'). A striking topographical feature of the Niagara Escarpment is its limestone cliff face, in general between 80m (250') and 100 (330') above the surrounding land, extending from the Niagara peninsula northwest to the [[Bruce Peninsula]].<ref name=\"bookreference\">Book: A conspectus of the Province of Ontario</ref>\n\nThe flattest areas of the province can be found in the lowlands of the far north, and in southwestern and eastern Ontario.\n\n===Water===\n[[Image:Niagara Falls and Maid of the Mist 2005.JPG|280px|right|thumb|[[Niagara Falls]], one of Ontario's most noted tourist destination and a source for hydroelectricity]]\nOntario is known for the large number of lakes and rivers it contains.

Ontario touches four of the Great Lakes: [[Lake Huron|Huron]], [[Lake Ontario]] (the province is named after the lake), [[Lake Erie|Erie]] and [[Lake Superior|Superior]].\n\nOntario's vast rivers and lakes originally opened the province for exploration and have made possible hydroelectric power, mills and various forms of industrialization. Most of Ontario is fed by rainfall, and in most parts [[snow]] is relied on. Precipitation is most common in the southern and central parts of Ontario where variations among the seasons are not especially great; but winter and spring are less aqueous than in northern and northwestern Ontario.<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1SEC875403]{{dead link|date=July 2017}} The Canadian Encyclopedia, Geography information of Ontario.</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Ontario K\u00f6ppen.svg|300px|thumb|K\u00f6ppen climate types of Ontario]]\nThe climate of Ontario varies by season and location.<ref name=EC>{{cite web |url = http://www.on.ec.gc.ca/canada-country-study/intro.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130323131703/http://www.on.ec.gc.ca/canada-country-study/intro.html |archivedate = March 23, 2013 |title = The Canada Country Study: Climate Impacts and Adaptation: Ontario Region Executive Summary |publisher = Environment Canada |accessdate = January 29, 2013}}</ref> It is affected by three air sources: cold, dry, arctic air from the north (dominant factor during the winter months, and for a longer part of the year in far northern Ontario); Pacific polar air crossing in from the western Canadian Prairies/US [[Northern Plains]]; and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.<ref name=UBCgeo>{{cite web |first1 = David |last1 = Baldwin |first2 = Joseph |last2 = Desloges |first3 = Lawrence |last3 = Band |url = http://www.ubcpress.ca/books/pdf/chapters/ecology/chapter2.pdf |title = Physical Geography of Ontario |publisher = UBC Press |accessdate = March 25, 2013 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217184751/http://www.ubcpress.ca/books/pdf/chapters/ecology/chapter2.pdf |archivedate = December 17, 2007 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> The effects of these major air masses on temperature and precipitation depend mainly on latitude, proximity to major bodies of water and to a small extent, terrain relief.<ref name= UBCgeo/> The surrounding Great Lakes greatly influence the climatic region of southern Ontario.<ref name=\"EC\"/> During the fall and winter months, heat stored from the lakes is released, moderating the climate near the shores of the lakes.<ref name=EPA>{{cite web |url = http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/atlas/glat-ch2.html |title = Natural Processes in the Great Lakes |publisher = US Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate = March 25, 2013 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130202002550/http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/atlas/glat-ch2.html |archivedate = February 2, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> This gives some parts of southern Ontario milder winters than mid-continental areas at lower latitudes.<ref name= EPA/> In general, most of Ontario's climate is classified as [[humid continental]].<ref name= UBCgeo/> Ontario has three main climatic regions:\n\n===Southern Ontario===\n\nAlmost all of southern Ontario is [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] Dfb, including the the cities of [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa]], [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] and [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]. The region has warm, humid summers and cold, usually moist winters. Extreme heat and cold usually occur for short periods. It is considered a temperate climate when compared with the remainder of continental Canada.  In the fall and winter, temperatures are moderated by the delayed cooling of the Great Lakes; this effect is reversed in spring and summer when afternoon warming is tempered. The lakes' moderating effects allow for a longer growing season than areas at similar latitudes in the continent's interior; some areas exceed 200 frost-free days and have an annual mean temperature of 10&nbsp;\u00b0C (50&nbsp;\u00b0F). Both spring and fall generally consist of mild days and cool nights but are prone to drastic temperature changes over a short timespan. Annual precipitation ranges from 75 to 110&nbsp;cm (30\u201343&nbsp;in) and is well distributed throughout the year with a usual summer peak. Upland areas in this region have cooler conditions, generally more precipitation (especially snowfall), putting them into the Dfb climate scheme. Most of this region lies in the lee of the Great Lakes, making for abundant snow in some areas (London, [[Goderich, Ontario|Goderich]] for example) receive an average of over 2 m (80\"), while some other areas are not in the direct snowbelt and receive closer to an average of 1 m (40\") of snow per year. Also included in the Dfb climate are the southern reaches of Northern Ontario, including the cities of Sudbury and North Bay, which have a more severe humid continental climate. This region has warm and sometimes hot summers with cold, longer winters with roughly equal annual precipitation to the south. Along the eastern shores of Lake Superior and Lake Huron (including [[Georgian Bay]]), frequent heavy lake-effect snow squalls increase seasonal snowfall totals upwards of 3 m (120&nbsp;in). Such conditions and the absence of long stretches of brutal cold make for excellent winter recreation. K\u00f6ppen climate  Dfa is represented in the southwestern tip of Ontario including the city of Windsor and a small area of the Golden Horseshoe region. This regions climate has similarities to that of the lower Great Lakes portion of the [[Midwestern United States]].\n\n===Northern Ontario===\n\nK\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfc: The northernmost parts of Ontario\u2014primarily north of 50\u00b0N and with no major cities in the area\u2014have a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen) with long, severely cold winters and short summers, with dramatic temperature changes possible in all seasons. In summer, hot weather occasionally reaches even the northernmost parts of Ontario for brief periods, although humidity is generally lower than in the south. With no major mountain ranges blocking sinking Arctic air masses, temperatures of \u221240&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u221240&nbsp;\u00b0F) are not uncommon. The snow stays on the ground much longer here than in other regions of Ontario; snow cover is usually present to some extent between October and May.\n\n===Severe weather===\n\nSevere and non-severe thunderstorms peak in frequency from June through August but can occur at any time. Thunderstorms form from daytime convective heating and frontal activity; in the south, lake breeze convergences also intensify storms. Another severe type of thunderstorm is known as a [[Mesocyclonic Convective Complex]] or [[Derecho]], which is a larger cluster-type thunderstorm mass with a more or less circular shape, often with a pronounced bow shape at its front or leading edge. During periods of hot weather in summer, they often develop in the afternoon west of the Great Lakes then strike Southern and Central Ontario at night with great forward motion, bringing severe straight-line winds over wide areas resulting in damage to forests, power interruption and infrastructure damage. The areas with the highest severe weather frequency in the province are Southwestern (Windsor, Chatham, Stratford corridor) and Central Ontario (Simcoe County including the city of Barrie, [[Lake Simcoe]] and the [[Kawartha Lakes]] region), both areas often getting amplified storms resulting from the Lake Breeze Front convergence. London has the most lightning strikes per year in Canada, averaging 34 days of thunderstorm activity per year. In a typical year, Ontario averages 15 confirmed tornado touchdowns, but this number has recently been increasing. These tornadoes, however, are rarely destructive (the vast majority are classified as EF0 or EF1 on the Enhanced Fujita scale). In Northern Ontario, some tornadoes go undetected by ground spotters because of the sparse population and remote landscape; they are often discovered after the fact by aircraft pilots, where aerial observations of damaged forest confirm occurrences. All of Northern Ontario north of a line from [[Lake Nipigon]] to [[Timmins]] has no weather radar coverage by [[Environment Canada]] making it difficult to detect tornadoes in far northern Ontario when they occur. Tropical depression remnants can cause copious rains and winds in the south, but are rarely deadly. A notable exception was [[Hurricane Hazel]] in October 1954.\n\n===Climate charts===\n\n{{climate chart\n| Windsor\n|-7.3 |-0.3 |62.1\n|-6.3 |1.1 |62.2  \n|-2.2 |6.7 |70\n|3.7 |14.1 |83 \n|9.5 |20.4 |89.3   \n|15.3 |25.8 |86.1 \n|17.9 |28.1 |89.2 \n|17.1 |26.9 |72.6 \n|12.8 |22.9 |93.9 \n|6.7 |15.8 |72.6 \n|1.4 |8.8 |79.6 \n|-4.3 |2.0 |74.1\n|float  = left\n|clear  = none\n|source = <ref>[https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?searchType=stnName&txtStationName=windsor&searchMethod=contains&txtCentralLatMin=0&txtCentralLatSec=0&txtCentralLongMin=0&txtCentralLongSec=0&stnID=4716&dispBack=0 Canadian Climate Normals 1981-2010 Windsor Airport]</ref>\n}}\n\n{{climate chart\n| Toronto\n| -6.7 | -0.7 | 62\n| -5.6 |  0.4 | 55\n| -1.9 |  4.7 | 54\n|  4.1 | 11.5 | 68 \n|  9.9 | 18.4 | 82\n| 14.9 | 23.8 | 71\n| 18.0 | 26.6 | 64 \n| 17.4 | 25.5 | 81 \n| 13.4 | 21.0 | 85\n|  7.4 | 14.0 | 64\n|  2.3 |  7.5 | 84 \n| -3.1 |  2.1 | 62 \n|float  = left\n|clear  = none\n|source = <ref>[https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?searchType=stnProv&lstProvince=ON&txtCentralLatMin=0&txtCentralLatSec=0&txtCentralLongMin=0&txtCentralLongSec=0&stnID=5051&dispBack=0(Toronto) Canadian Climate Normals 1981-2010 (Toronto City)]</ref>\n}}\n\n{{climate chart\n| Ottawa\n|-14.4 |-5.8 |62.9 \n|-12.5 |-3.1 |49.7\n|-6.8 |2.4 |57.5 \n|1.5 |11.4 |71.1 \n|8 |19 |86.6\n|13.3 |24.1 |92.7  \n|15.7 |26.6 |84.4\n|14.5 |25.4 |83.8 \n|10.1 |20.5 |92.7\n|4 |12.8 |85.9 \n|-1.5 |5.5 |82.7 \n|-9.2 |-2 |69.5 \n|float  = left\n|clear  = none\n|source = <ref>[https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?searchType=stnName&txtStationName=ottawa+&searchMethod=contains&txtCentralLatMin=0&txtCentralLatSec=0&txtCentralLongMin=0&txtCentralLongSec=0&stnID=4333&dispBack=0 Canadian Climate Normals 1981-2010 (Ottawa City)]</ref>\n}}\n\n{{climate chart\n| Sudbury\n|-17.9 |-8 |62.2\n|-16 |-5.5 |51.1\n|-10.2 |0.4 |65.9\n|-1.7 |9.2 |65.7 \n|5.2 |17 |83.4 \n|10.7 |22.2 |80.3 \n|13.4 |24.8 |76.9\n|12.4 |23.4 |85.4 \n|7.8 |18.1 |101.1\n|1.7 |10.3 |90.9 \n|-4.7 |2.6 |78.5\n|-12.7 |-4.4 |67.5\n|float  = left\n|clear  = none\n|source = <ref>[https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?searchType=stnName&txtStationName=ottawa+&searchMethod=contains&txtCentralLatMin=0&txtCentralLatSec=0&txtCentralLongMin=0&txtCentralLongSec=0&stnID=4333&dispBack=0 Canadian Climate Normals 1981-2010 (Sudbury)]</ref>\n}}\n\n{{climate chart\n| Thunder Bay\n|-21 |-9 |31.3\n|-18 |-6 |24.9\n|-11 |0 |41.6\n|-3 |9 |41.5\n|3 |16 |66.5\n|7 |21 |85.7\n|11 |24 |89\n|10 |23 |87.5\n|5 |17 |88\n|-1 |10 |62.6\n|-8 |2 |55.6\n|-17 |-6 |37.5\n|float  = left\n|clear  = none\n|source = <ref>[http://climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=4055&lang=e&dCode=0&StationName=THUNDERBAY&SearchType=Contains&province=ALL&provBut=&month1=0&month2=12 Canadian Climate Normals 1971-2000 (Thunder Bay)]</ref>\n}}\n\n{{climate chart\n| Moosonee\n|-27 |-14.2 |33.9\n|-25.7 |-11 |22.7\n|-19.1 |-4.2 |31.7\n|-8.6 |3.7 |39\n|-0.3 |12.7 |53.7\n|5 |18.8 |71.1\n|8.5 |22.2 |101.3\n|7.9 |20.8 |75.8\n|4.1 |14.6 |90\n|-0.8 |7.6 |73.3\n|-8.6 |-0.8 |54.3\n|-21.7 |-10.8 |34.7\n|float  = left\n|clear  = none\n|source = <ref>[http://climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=4168&prov=&lang=e&dCode=3&dispBack=1&StationName=Moosonee&SearchType=Contains&province=ALL&provBut=&month1=0&month2=12 Canadian Climate Normals 1971-2000 (Moosonee)]</ref>\n}}\n\n{{climate chart\n| Big Trout Lake\n|-29 |-18.5 |23\n|-26.7 |-14.2 |20.6\n|-20.8 |-6 |27.9\n|-9.4 |3.2 |32.2\n|-0.3 |12 |37.8\n|6.6 |17.4 |74.3\n|11.2 |21.2 |90.9\n|10.2 |19.5 |87.8\n|4 |11.7 |83\n|-1.8 |4.4 |52.7\n|-12.5 |-5.6 |50.1\n|-24.9 |-15.7 |28.8\n|float  = left\n|clear  = none\n|source = <ref>[http://climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=3914&lang=e&dCode=0&province=ONT&provBut=&month1=0&month2=12 Canadian Climate Normals 1971-2000 (Big Trout Lake)]</ref>\n}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Geography|Canada}}\n*[[Geology of Ontario]]\n*[[Geography of Canada]]\n*[[Demographics of Ontario]]\n*[[List of islands of Ontario]]\n*[[Southern Ontario]]\n*[[Ontario Peninsula]]\n*[[Northern Ontario]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.ontario.ca/en/about_ontario/EC001032.html?openNav=geography Geography of Ontario at www.ontario.ca]\n\n{{Ontario}}\n{{Subdivisions of Ontario}}\n{{Canada Geography}}\n\n[[Category:Geography of Ontario| ]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Ontario"}

The film tracks the attempts of Bobby Taylor to become a successful actor and the mental and external roadblocks he encounters, represented through a series of interspersed vignettes and fantasies.  Produced, directed, and co-written by [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]], the film is semi-autobiographical, reflecting Townsend's experiences as a black actor when he was told he was not \"black enough\" for certain roles.<ref>Scheer, Laurie. \"The Eighties and Nineties.\" Creative Careers in Hollywood. New York: Allworth, 2002. 33. Print.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nBobby Taylor ([[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]]) is a young black man aspiring to become an actor.  He practices his lines in the bathroom, with his younger brother Stevie (Craigus R. Johnson) watching him play a \"jive\" character as he prepares to audition for a part in ''Jivetime Jimmy's Revenge'', a movie about street gangs which is so full of stereotypes that the light-skinned black actors who audition are cast as [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] gang members and have to speak with cartoonish [[Spanish language|Spanish]] accents. Bobby's grandmother ([[Helen Martin]]) overhears the \"[[jive talk]]\" and expresses disapproval. His mother (Starletta DuPois) is more supportive, and Bobby assures her that if he lands the part, their lives will change for the better.\n\nAfter the audition, Bobby talks with his boss Mr. Jones ([[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]]), who questions Bobby's dedication to his job at Jones's restaurant, Winky Dinky Dog, because Bobby frequently makes excuses to miss work so he can attend auditions and casting calls. A limousine arrives, and its passenger is B. B. Sanders (Brad Sanders), a famous black actor who plays a stereotypical comedy character, Batty Boy, in the popular sitcom ''There's a Bat in My House''. Ecstatic to meet a potential role model, Bobby asks Sanders how to determine whether a role is a good one. Sanders tells him that if his character does not die, then it's a good part. Sanders says that acting is not about art, it's about making money -- \"the [[sequel]]\", merchandising, etc.\n\nBobby gets a call from his agent and learns that his audition went well, and he got a [[Audition#Musical theatre|callback]], but the producers want an \"[[Eddie Murphy]]-type\". That night, he has a nightmare in which the director ([[Eugene Robert Glazer]]), writer ([[Dom Irrera]]), and casting director (Lisa Mende) hound him to become Eddie Murphy, using terms including \"Murphy-esque\" and \"Murphonic\". Waiting in line with a group of Eddie Murphy clones, Bobby starts turning into Eddie Murphy himself and then wakes up in shock.\n\nThe next day, Bobby's Winky Dinky Dog co-workers, Donald and Tiny ([[Keenen Ivory Wayans]] and Lou D. Washington), belittle his acting, telling him that he will never succeed, so Bobby quits Winky Dinky Dog.  Later that night, he visits his uncle Ray (David McKnight), a singer who gave up on his chance at stardom in order to work at a \"real\" job to provide for his family. Bobby expresses doubts about continuing to pursue acting, but Ray encourages Bobby to follow his dreams. During his callback, the director, writer, and casting director are thrilled at Bobby's performance, calling it \"very black\", and he wins the lead role.  He then begins to experience attacks of conscience that manifest as daydreams based on what people around him are saying or doing, including one (\"Black Acting School\") where white coaches teach black performers how to act \"more black\", and one (\"Sneaking into the Movies\") where two young black men gain entry to a theater without paying and review films that spoof popular titles \u00e0 la ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|At the Movies]]'', including ''Amadeus Meets Salieri'', ''Chicago Jones and the Temple of Doom'', ''Dirty Larry'', and ''Attack of the Street Pimps''.\n\nAt home, Bobby is celebrating with his girlfriend Lydia ([[Anne-Marie Johnson]]) when his grandmother comes home and the three watch a [[film noir]].  Bobby has another fantasy about playing the lead in his own film noir, ''Death of a [[breakdancing|Breakdancer]]''. That night, Bobby dreams of the roles that he wants to play, from a [[Shakespearean]] king, to a black superhero, to a black version of [[John Rambo|Rambo]] (\"Rambro\"). His final dream depicts him winning his fifth [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]. Bobby returns to the studio the next day to start filming ''Jivetime Jimmy's Revenge'' with his family in attendance. His guilt about playing such a stereotypical character finally overwhelms him, and Bobby quits in the middle of the shoot. Another cast member who previously complained about the stereotypical film hypocritically takes over Bobby's part, but Bobby and his family leave the set with their pride intact.\n\nIn the closing scene, Bobby is completing preparations on a different set for an on camera scene that's about to begin. In an echo of his grandmother's previous admonition that there's always honest work at the post office, ''Hollywood Shuffle'' ends with Bobby filming a TV commercial for the [[US Postal Service]].\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]] as Bobby Taylor, an aspiring young black actor who dreams of making it big in Hollywood.

During the 1930s he moved on from journalism and poetry to publishing novels and collections of short stories.

He was with the ''[[News Review]]'' from 1948 to 1950, and as a director and literary adviser at the publishing houses Evans Brothers, Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. His later poetry, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967), took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic. Of his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''.\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married Crystal Selwyn Herbert, the daughter of [[A. P. Herbert]], the [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] [[Member of Parliament]]. They had two daughters and a son, but were divorced. In 1955 he married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967. That process became a subject for his writing. In 1976 he developed cancer of the throat from which he died a year later in much pain. He wrote about his illness unflinchingly in his autobiographical ''Thank Goodness for Cake'', posthumously published in 1978.<ref name=dnb/> His grandson [[Toby Perkins]] is the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Chesterfield]].\n\n==Works==\n\n===Poetry===\n*Spring Encounter (1933)\n*Open the Sky ([[Boriswood]] 1934)\n*Dispersal Point and other Air Poems (1942)\n*The Grass Grew All Round (1942)\n*Beyond This Disregard (1943) poems\n*South of Forty (1943) poems\n*Ten Summers: Poems 1933-1943 (1944)\n*Almanack of Hope: Sonnets (1944)\n*Air Force Poetry (1944) (anthology, edited with Henry Treese)\n*Flight above Cloud (1944)\n*World Still There (1945)\n*Selected Poems (1946)\n*Low Life (1947)\n*Commemorations (1948)\n*Collected Poems (1957)\n*Spill Out: Poems and Ballads (1967)\n*Spandrels : Poems and Ballads (1969)\n*Take This Orange: Poems and Ballads (1971)\n*Selected Poems 1967-1973 (1973)\n*Living in a One-Sided House (1976) poems\n*Writers' Workshop, poetry anthology publication, editor with [[Norman Hidden]] and [[Michael Johnson (editor)|Michael Johnson]] (from 1967)<ref>Durham University.

However, it was the advent of the [[Second World War]] that enabled Pudney to find his subject - the effect that war has on the lives of ordinary people - and with it, his audience.<ref name=times>''The Times'' obituary, 11 November 1977, p 17</ref> In 1940 he was commissioned into the [[Royal Air Force]] as an intelligence officer and as a member of the [[Air Ministry]]'s Creative Writers Unit. It was while he was serving as squadron intelligence officer at [[RAF St Eval]] in Cornwall that Pudney wrote one of the best-known poems of the war.<ref name=dnb/> ''For Johnny'' evoked popular fellow-feeling in the London of 1941. Written during an air raid, it was published first in the ''News Chronicle'', and featured significantly in the film ''[[The Way to the Stars]]'':\n\n<poem>\nDo not despair\nFor Johnny-head-in-air;\nHe sleeps as sound\nAs Johnny underground.\n\nFetch out no shroud\nFor Johnny-in-the-cloud;\nAnd keep your tears\nFor him in after years.\n\nBetter by far\nFor Johnny-the-bright-star,\nTo keep your head,\nAnd see his children fed.\n</poem>\n\n==Later Career==\nIn the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|UK General Election of July 1945]], Pudney stood as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate for [[Sevenoaks (UK Parliament constituency)|Sevenoaks]], polling 14,947 votes, or 36 per cent.<ref>''The International Who's Who'' (Europa Publications Limited, 1963) p. 857</ref><ref>[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge45/i17.htm UK General Election results July 1945] at keele.ac.uk, accessed 10 January 2009</ref>\n\nAfter the war he continued to write and worked as an editor and in publishing. He was with the ''[[News Review]]'' from 1948 to 1950, and as a director and literary adviser at the publishing houses Evans Brothers, Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. His later poetry, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967), took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic. Of his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''.\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married Crystal Selwyn Herbert,<ref>[http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/ww2/pudney/ John Pudney (1909 - 1977) - The War Poets Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417054114/http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/ww2/pudney/ |date=17 April 2013 }}</ref> the daughter of [[A.

In 1955 he married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967. That process became a subject for his writing. In 1976 he developed cancer of the throat from which he died a year later in much pain. He wrote about his illness unflinchingly in his autobiographical ''Thank Goodness for Cake'', posthumously published in 1978.<ref name=dnb/> His grandson [[Toby Perkins]] is the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Chesterfield]].\n\n==Works==\n\n===Poetry===\n*Spring Encounter (1933)\n*Open the Sky ([[Boriswood]] 1934)\n*Dispersal Point and other Air Poems (1942)\n*The Grass Grew All Round (1942)\n*Beyond This Disregard (1943) poems\n*South of Forty (1943) poems\n*Ten Summers: Poems 1933-1943 (1944)\n*Almanack of Hope: Sonnets (1944)\n*Air Force Poetry (1944) (anthology, edited with Henry Treese)\n*Flight above Cloud (1944)\n*World Still There (1945)\n*Selected Poems (1946)\n*Low Life (1947)\n*Commemorations (1948)\n*Collected Poems (1957)\n*Spill Out: Poems and Ballads (1967)\n*Spandrels : Poems and Ballads (1969)\n*Take This Orange: Poems and Ballads (1971)\n*Selected Poems 1967-1973 (1973)\n*Living in a One-Sided House (1976) poems\n*Writers' Workshop, poetry anthology publication, editor with [[Norman Hidden]] and [[Michael Johnson (editor)|Michael Johnson]] (from 1967)<ref>Durham University.
